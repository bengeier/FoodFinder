{"text":"Well, place went downhill very fast. Drinks are extremely watered down. Plus, they pour cheap liquor in expensive bottles. I've ordered a shot of Patrone the other night and it tasted nothing like it."}
{"text":"Great spot to stop in for some drinks as we live next door. Bartenders are always nice and the atmosphere is pretty laid back."}
{"text":"Kristina the bar tender is really cool!  We had a great time.  The place has a great, easy, breezy vibe.  Drinks are well made and affordable.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"They do not ID you unless you order a drink at the bar so 50% of the crowed looks underaged and too \"screamy\" and wasted for 10:30pm. The atmosphere is odd and the music is not loud enough to cover for it.. There are plenty of tables and comfortable chairs but no one is available to serve you, only a rude, nervous and really busy bartender. For a Saturday night and $5 Michelobs that you have to go order at the bar and then sit back at your table, I was expecting a nicer atmosphere."}
{"text":"Such a cool bar, too bad it's in a hotel!  I came on a Friday around 6:30pm for happy hour and it was dead...maybe because there was a wedding at the hotel at that time but still...EMPTY!  Sadness!  It's sleek and modern with outdoor seating which is awesome, but the lack of crowd threw me off a little bit.  Whatever, I made the best of it and enjoyed a glass of wine on the patio.  I would've given W XYZ a 4-star review, but my issue was that Yelp said if you check in, you get a cocktail 50% off.  When we checked in, the manager said the check-in offer is no longer valid and they don't know why the company doesn't update the Yelp.  Personally, I think it should've been honored but hey, I'm not the manager."}
{"text":"When we first got here we told each other one drink and were out. That was at 9 oclock. Its almost 2 am now and we are still here. Why? Phil. Bartender Phil. He kept us here and is such an amazing asset to this hotel. You can not put a price on sheer excellence. Excellence from his mixology, salesmanship, and personality. He was amazing! A lot of bartenders in this area, and beyond, could learn a lot from him!"}
{"text":"I stayed at the aloft for a few days and had to stop by for happy hour.....Josh and Justin took very good care of all the patrons....very attentive and excellent customer service.....it seemed that many of the guests knew them.....very enjoyable experience and kudos to both gentlemen....."}
{"text":"This bar is inside the Aloft Hotel. Sometimes you have people working on their laptops in the lobby of the bar area so it's got an interesting vibe, definitely not your typical bar. They also have live music so you can come and listen to some good music (today was an acoustic duet) while you drink your gin and tonic.   They also have outdoor seating, but I'm not sure if they allow you to take your drinks out there or not.   Overall not a bad place! Not sure about the prices, I didn't drink anything, just enjoyed the show."}
{"text":"Josh, the bartender is an amazing mixer. He is the DJ of drinks. Make sure you go during happy hour. It's a relaxing environment in the lobby of the aloft hotel. Beautiful experience."}
{"text":"I was interested based on other reviews and the high rating. Be aware this is a hotel lobby bar. Zero ambiance. Limited menu. Big feature was a growler refill. After checking it out I decided to move on. I think the description is somewhat misleading."}
{"text":"Shout to Ruben for making Friday nite at Wxyz a great time. It's Friday, I had nothing to do, and Ruben got me high! LOL..one of my favorite lines from the movie Friday! Ruben, drink connoisseur, eye candy, inviting personality, effortlessly earned the tip. Definitely a reason to return to the bar."}
{"text":"The drinks were really not that impressive. Maybe it was lack of good quality spirits or the fact that we got a bit of push-back when we tried to use the check-in offer.  It's the only cocktail bar nearby so it served its purpose I suppose."}
{"text":"Sorry I'm not sorry--I'm a major fan of this hip new lounge in CLE.   Not only have I been waiting for what seems like forever for a new, boutique hotel in downtown Cleveland, but I've also been waiting for a non-sleazed out, upscale lounge with delicious cocktails and zero dance-club vibe. These two things just happened to come together in one package, which I adore.   First off, this lounge is in the lobby of the new Aloft Hotel and honestly, you feel a little like an out-of-towner when you're here--in the best way possible. It's trendy without the douche-factor that almost every CLE lounge eventually gets. It boasts modern, high-end decor and interesting guest. I admit, I haven't been back in a little over 2 months, but when I was there I was so relieved to find reprieve from booty-grinding 22 year olds and overly tanned Affliction shirt-wearing gym rat dudes. Thank you, Jesus.   Yes, Cleveland. We can have a nice, classy cocktail lounge without it becoming completely ruined by drunken idiots, inappropriate behavior and pucker shots. At least that's my hope for this spot.   Secondly--the balcony connected to W XYZ is fantastic. It's not huge, but in the summer it is really cool to stand out there, sip a cocktail and watch boats on the Cuyahoga, lit up bridges, the Rapid zipping by and the slow rebuild of The Flats. Again, you start to feel like you're out of town.  There's also tons of lounge space indoors with trendy, comfy seating and a late night menu that brags gourmet grilled cheese and tomato soup, veggie flatbreads and other delicious-looking items. I haven't eaten here, yet, but I intend to.     If you're looking for a change of pace from brewpubs, hipster bars, townie traps, dives, douchey dance clubs, cover charges and carbon copies of the same places--I'd check out W XYZ at Aloft."}
{"text":"This place is a wreck.   No cocktail toothpicks? Just go ahead and dump some of those nasty olives in the martini glass...   Red Zin stored in the refrigerator...  Bartenders looking up recipes for staple cocktails...  If you're going to ask crazy high hotel prices, maybe you can offer service to back it up?"}
{"text":"I came down here while I was staying one night at the hotel.  Yes, the bar area isn't all that fantastic, but it's more than enough, in my opinion. I sat up at the bar and had a few local beers, which were a good price. I did look at the food menu, and it was minimal.. so I went ahead and just ordered another beer.   It was a perfect way to unwind after a very long day. The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"This place is really awesome.  The lobby is super cool looking and the bar has live music on Tuesday and Saturday nights.  The drinks are affordable, there are 3 TVs and one is a big screen.  The bar has Board games, a pool table, and plenty of seating.   Check it out, you'll like it here!"}
{"text":"Cool looking modern bar. I suppose not a bad place to meet for drinks, or if your staying at the hotel.  Met group of friends here for a drink the other night. It is located in the  Aloft. Service was not great. My Martini was way too salty. When I ordered a second one I asked for just a little bit of olive juice and it was still too salty. I could not finish either one. Bartender did not offer new glasses.   ."}
{"text":"I love this place! Like Jessica said, you don't expect much from the outside, but once you step in, its a complete 180. I live across the parking lot at the Grigio, so going here to pre-game before going out is a great option. I would have no problem staying all night, but they usually close by 12AM. They'll stay open later, but only if it's busy enough."}
{"text":"Why the hell are you closed at 10pm ?!?!   Helllooooo.   So weird to me!  Ur a bar!!!!  Bars close at 2:30am :/ but the 3 stars are for the kind staff guy breaking bar down and the attractive level of that place.  I LOVE hotel bars!"}
{"text":"Good times with my friend Jeannie..  i think we stopped in here late one day and it was an average bar .."}
{"text":"Last night we met friends for dinner and drinks down in the Flats. First, these are not your father's Flats! The whole scene has been completely rejuvenated and it is so much fun to see this rebirth in the CLE. We had dinner near their hotel (they were staying in aloft) and then popped in to W XYZ bar for drinks. The bar was very upscale, with an awesome view of the Flats, and had an excellent selection of bevvies! We chose to play a little Cards Against Humanity while lounging and sipping. (Who doesn't love a party game for horrible people?!) We'll be back, for shizzle."}
{"text":"My Overview- I went there with my boyfriends for a couple of drinks before we actually went out for the night. Not really sure what to expect, we were very surprised to see how cool and \"ultra\" it was , from the out side it reminds me of a basic everyday hotel but stepping inside its like walking into a hip vegas hotel. As I spend a lot of time at The W in Scottsdale , it reminded me of a sister to it! So we checked out the place , nice furniture , patio with fire, whoo hooo! BE sure to order the Bubbletini ! We had such a good time we ended up staying the whole night! Awesome times! Hidden fun  that I hope people discover!"}
{"text":"If u can ignore whatever scent they r pumping thru the lobby. This is a cool place. Good place to work, live music, pool table, but God I am chocking on this \"fragrance\" they r pumping into lobby. It's 100% disgusting"}
{"text":"I stay at the Aloft just about every time that I come to PHX. The Wxyz is a great little in house bar. The bartenders are polite, professional, friendly and good! I had a classic Manhattan prepared by new guy, Ben. Josh, the Senior Bartender was doing the training. My cocktail was perfect.  Nice work gentlemen!"}
{"text":"Stayed here at the aloft hotel, stopped here at wxyz.. Hands down best cocktails I had all Labor Day weekend out here!!! Are wonderful bartender, Naziree, we asked her to go off her radar: aka bar menu, and create something of her own! Mmmmm wonderful .. She's an awesome mixologist! Check it out!"}
{"text":"Excellent bartender who knows his stuff! Whether wine or tequila, he was able to navigate customers towards what would be good for them.   The food was decent also, however, having a salad or two in the menu would be quite a good addition. The decor is funky and pretty cool also. I really liked the color changing lights embedded in the bar.   We had a fun and relaxing time staying in this hotel and it was nice to unwind with a glass of wine at the end of a long day."}
