Better than doritos or what not, but more expensive than the mass produced stuff"}
{"text":"Spudniks is one of my favourite places to visit at crossiron. Their chips are made fresh and favours are fantastic. I especially enjoy the spicy thai chilli and jalapeño ones. However this is not the reason why I want to write this review. Their service is so horrible that I made a yelp account just to complain about their unacceptable customer service. Generally speaking, their employees are excellent. I just want to complain about this particular one. He is asian and worked there on April 26th Sunday closing. When I was there, it was quite busy and it was closing time so I was prepared to be patient and wait for my turn. My understanding is that when there is a line up, you are supposed to serve one customer at a time. Being a seasoned customer, I am quite familiar with their process. However, after I requested to sample a flavour, he pretty much chucked it to me and before i could ask to purchase any, he quickly turned around and started serving other customers. I was ok with it still because it was busy. However, he did this several times!! What pissed me off the most is when I asked to purchase 3 bags, he just quickly shoved some chips into each bag and handed them to me without sealing or labelling the bags. I was confused and asked him if he could seal the bags for me. He just ignored me and started serving the next customer!! The next customer was nice enough to tell him to finish my part of the service before moving on to the next customer. This is when he turned to me and quickly sealed the bags and labelled them. He did all this without weighing the chips. I know the chips should be 160g per bag and every time I purchased chips from Spudniks, they were weighed to ensure I was getting the accurate amount. I was a bit irritated but was planning to let it go anyways. It was closing time so my friends, my bf and I left quickly. Placing too much trust on the employee, it was not until after I got home that I noticed he gave me the wrong flavored chips!! I ordered jalapeño and he gave me sour cream and onion!!.. To sum up, the mistakes made by this employee are:

1. bypassing me several times and serve other customers
2. ignoring my requests and coming back to us only when the other customer mentioned it to him
3. not weighing the chips 
4. not sealing the chips
5. giving me the wrong flavoured chips! 
6. worse of all: HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! 

This is just my particular experience with Spudniks on April 26th at around closing time. I usually try my best to sympathize with the employees because they are busy. However this time I cannot tolerate it anymore because of all of those factors mentioned above. Will I go back to buy chips from them in the future? Yes, because their chips are delicious. However, I sincerely hope that this employee should go through training again and learn to finish each transaction before moving onto the next one."}
{"text":"Nice place for a snack that's far from the food court and less busy. The kids always like samples and decided to choose chips for their mall snack. Ketchup flavour was awesome...as usual. Many flavours to choose from.  

The bags look large on display, but when you receive the chips, it's disappointing and a quarter full. Seems a bit pricey for what you get...however at the same time...it is the mall and food is generally more pricey."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a snack while you wander the gallows of Crossiron Mills this is the place to go. They make the chips fresh every day. 

There's almost a dozen flavours to choose from and you can ask for a sample chip before you buy. They sell bags of chips that you can take home also to fill your movie or big game snack needs.

My personal fav is sour cream and onion, but the Mexican jalapeño runs a close second."}
