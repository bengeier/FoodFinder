{"text":"This is an excellent authentic Mexican restaurant. The waiters didn't really speak or understand English, but the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"This it's one of the worst restaurants in town 
I will not recommend no one to this restaurant 
The sewer water was all over the floor 
After I talk to couple employees they confirm the owner knows about several issues 
And the score it's 85 so gross 
STAY AWAY from this place"}
{"text":"Love they're food especially la bandeja pisa. Some of There waitresses are rude but overall the food is great"}
{"text":"Plenty of seating, full bar, great flavor in their Salvadoran steak, and all their food in general looks very, very good. They are reasonable in my opinion and the service is pretty good. No complaints, only compliments. Keep it up, Morazan!"}
{"text":"Best way to sum this experience? \"zOMG delicious\" 

The food is so flavorful. It feels like someone's in the back making it with love. 

The sanitation score was a 92% and yet it's worth the risk. 

Just imagine you're stopping by a sketchy food cart with amazing chiropollo. 

I'm a huge meat lover and yet the salad, rice, and beans are my favorite! 

I can't properly explain that. Just go see for yourself."}
{"text":"Service was ok place it's spacious but can use some cleaning tables are sticky and floors sticky . My friend asked the waitress why the bench was dirty and she said\" cause the customers don't know how to eat !\" Hello clean it up for next customers . Food was pretty decent good portions but service was not so great only reason I did not give it a 4 and of course place being a bit clean."}
{"text":"It was very bright and not very welcoming. The food was just ok, nothing to make you want to return. It was somewhat difficult ordering as the servers didn't speak English very well but they were nice. The menus need to be cleaned."}
{"text":"True authentic Mexican and salvor durian food
Staff was nice and food was excellent 
Looks like neighborhood hangout 
Would come back to eat and looks like cold beer if your thirsty"}
{"text":"Giving them a 1 star simply because I am a regular customer at Morazan & Lempira on south Blvd but this location on Archdale is TERRIBLE. I was there yesterday & the waitress sat my fiancé, daughter & I on the Add on extension they recently made. There were SO MANY ANTS CRAWLING ON THE TABLE. The floors were dirty, walls filthy. The food was extremely disappointing. I got a breakfast #10. Which comes with fried beef which had a terrible low quality meat taste. The cheese looked like it was going bad. The egg omelette had absolutely no salt or taste. The rice was mushy & plantains undercooked. I will definitely not return here. Unsanitary place & rude employees . Stay away from here , save your time and money & go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great Mexican & Honduran food! The staff is friendly and they have a full bar. The prices are great and the portions are huge."}
{"text":"Comida excelente pero hay personal que da lastima con las ganas que trabaja. Espero vean sus empleados (no es de años trabajando si no de servicio bien mostrado)"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible!! I've been here in the past and the food was good. It has gone down hill, service was awful the girl got our order wrong and kept on forgetting or/and bringing us the wrong thing. Cheese dip was hard and cold. There was a spider that landed on our table. Overall it wasn't a pleasant experience. WILL NOT RETURN"}
{"text":"Loved the food, really good service. Place is nice. Just Love it and recommend it. Worth ever dollar spent."}
