{"text":"The flavor is amazing.... the people is great and friendly! Totally recommended!! It will come back next week!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, the waffles! They're amazing. The atmosphere is lovely and it's always very quiet. I've been in Toronto for a few months and so far this place is my very favourite."}
{"text":"First visit to E.L. Ruddy = success!  Cute-as-a-button (anti) hole-in-the-wall veg*n cafe on Dundas W is a great place to eat.  In a world where everyone with a debit card thinks they can outfit a restaurant, this Value Village done right spot is amazing value in the heart of Little Portugal.  Young, hip kids sit at the Formica tables chatting about their horrible lives, while other singles read copies of 'Harpers', 'Wired' or 'UTNE Reader' that are available on the shelves.  Ate:  Mexican Bean Soup: Nothing special, a little under seasoned for my liking, but almost exactly what I expected, which was good.  Vegan Grilled Cheese: Really good.  Super thick house made grilled bread with correct amount of Daiya cheese.  Didn't have one, but I saw a cappuccino that looked like it came straight from Second Cup circa 1996.  (Stay away).  Server was very nice with good recommendations.   Excellent value, good food, nice spot.  Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"the Toronto Lover system: 5 stars = Must visit! 4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here. 3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go. 2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary. 1 star = Do not visit!    E.L. Ruddy's has delicious food, lovely coffee, and one of the quaintest atmospheres you can imagine. They offer terrific vegetarian dishes. Go for breakfast, and try the eggs, beans, and cornbread. Most breakfasts hover around $10. The decor is a one room arrangement that feels a bit like someone's living room, but it's someone you know well. This is a really nice place that gets overshadowed, only in hype, by some of the more trendy breakfast joints in the area.  4 stars"}
{"text":"best brunch of my life. friendly service, delightful attention to detail in regards to both the food and the atmosphere. sure my (delicious, inexpensive) breakfast took half an hour to hit the table, but who cares when you're reading a selection of cafe magazines and listening to Shocking Blue on the stereo?   I could pretty much just eat here every day. go, try everything, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"this is a classic veggie/vegan diner that's been around a while. their food is great and the booze is affordable. friendly servers and quick service! what more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Love this place so much.  The food is incredible cheap, good, vegan/veg fare, and the owner and servers are so kind and friendly.  Great beer on tap, lots of seating at this small neighbourhood bar, always a pint/shot deal, and good playlist!"}
{"text":"It's sad that I have to write this review because I actually usually like this place. I went for brunch on Sunday we came in a bit later than usual, there weren't any other customers. First off it took 35+ minutes for us to receive our food, with no apology from the server. When we finally got it, the orders were completely screwed up. Mine was suppose to be vegan and my friends not but they had switched them around. The server and cook laughed at this,barley apologized and said it would be another 15 minutes before we would get our fixed orders. The server probably should have offered our meal to be on the house as most restaurants do but that would have been too gracious for her so we just walked out. No biggie for them I guess."}
{"text":"Get over yourself... Bad service, the server made us feel like she was doing us a favor. Bad coffee, served with no cream or sugar. After waiting 5 mins then asking for cream, it was served with a rusty spoon, literally(see photo). I didn't notice at first until I had bits of metal in my mouth... Yummy :). After all that I had an over priced shot of O.J. Then waited over an hour for my food. That all said, the food is good."}
{"text":"We (4 of us) visited L.R. Ruddy for dinner on Saturday October 27, 2012. Over all, we were disappointed. Although the food was tasty, the service was very unfriendly. In very small restaurants like this one, there is usually more of a connection between customer and restaurant staff. Unfortunately, our server was neither interested in us nor made us feel welcome. One could possibly understand a situation like this in a busy restaurant, but there was only one other group in the restaurant while we were there, and they left well before we did. Is it too much to ask for one smile from your server while you're there?? We go out for dinner most Saturday evenings together and this is the first time we've written a (negative) review of a restaurant. We were also disappointed with the 'wine' glasses (they weren't wine glasses, but not a problem for us though) because they were more akin in size to over-sized shot glasses. We estimated that we received about 3 oz of wine. The kicker was that their price was no different than that at most restaurants. Usually, we have a couple of drinks each, but because of the amount of wine we had received, we stopped after only having one. We then proceeded to drink water until our server suddenly took our glasses away without asking. Later, the server's friends came and she spent the rest of our time there, except to bring our bill and collect our money, talking and laughing with them. As we prepared to leave, our server made no attempt to say anything to us, so we shouted out a friendly thank you as we exited. Afterwards, while we were having some drinks at a nearby establishment, we wondered why we had just given our server at L.R. Ruddy our usual +15% tip before taxes. At any rate, we won't be returning."}
{"text":"Was visiting the area with my BF and we found ourselves barhopping the area. We walked into EL Ruddy at about 11pm on a Saturday. There were a few other guests at the bar, but we snagged two seats and the bartender greeted us right away. He recommended some drinks for us and took the time to explain them. We really got a nice, welcoming feeling from the workers and crowd here. It was refreshing as we really had no idea where the good bars were located in the area (we had no wifi while traveling since we're from US) and we felt lucky to stumble into this cute little bar. The drinks matched the service. I ordered a rusty nail, which is not usually something I'd drink but I seriously enjoyed it. By the time we were finishing our drinks, a few large crowds came in and the place really filled up. The bartender was attentive to all guests. I'm very impressed and next time I'm in town I'll be sure to pay another visit."}
{"text":"Went for brunch. Summed up all the things that are stereotypically lousy about brunching in Toronto.  Bummed-out, spacey server - hung over? Underdone potatoes, oily greens, cafeteria eggs, smallish portions, $12.   Decor in the space seemed unfinished and inconsistent. Quaint is fine but the tables and my chair were super rickety. I appreciate the intent to help out vegan folks and folks with dietary restrictions but the execution was unfortunate."}
{"text":"Food is decent, but the service is snail pace. The staff don't seem to pay attention to when people come in, essentially adding to the general snail vibes.   No dice guys."}
{"text":"I've got two words for you right now that will blow your mind: vegan omelette.  Sorry I had to do that to you.  No doubt you're experiencing some kind of heightened emotional state right now. Maybe you're angry; \"Vegan omelette is a contradiction!\" you say. I say, life is full of contradictions, and unless you're a super-logical machine that explodes when it sees contradictions, you gotta learn to deal with it. Maybe you're frightened; \"If vegan omelettes exist, has mankind and his technological prowess finally gone too far?\" To you I say, fear not the march of progress! Maybe you, like myself, are elated; \"Name the tyrannical lord whose bidding I must perform that I may bask in the godly gifts of which you speak.\" To you I say, rest now my friend, and simply walk to E L Ruddy Co, and give the person some money, and get yourself a vegan omelette. I never liked actual eggs. I always had a very low threshold for how \"eggy\" something could be before it made me wanna throw up. Omelettes, naturally, fell into the hyper-eggy category. Yet strangely, this fine mix of ground tofu, flours, and spices, topped with Daiya cheese-like stuff, sided with a simple but tasty green salad, home fries (yes yes yes), and toast - this thing on my plate, dear friends, is reason enough to fall in love with this place, the people within it, and the walls that contain it.  Lots of character and charm resonate through the walls, the decor, the staff. I really like that this place is a short walk from my house. Vegan brunch lives at E L Ruddy."}
{"text":"This is our favourite place in the neighbourhood. We love the atmosphere and the service is wonderful. It feels like a place where you could hang out all day. I just wish they would serve a little bit of meat since I am not a vegetarian. If they did I'd probably be there every day."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. The venue is rustic and intimate; a little gem you could pass by everyday (and regret those days once you walk in!). The wonderful women who have cooked for and served us are engaging and so so sweet. And the vegan omelette - to die for. The portions are huge, fresh and a tastebud dance party. Soul food. I've only had their vegan breakfasts but my partner had the egg omelette and was hooked, too. A diamond in the rough. And their mango hot sauce made in house, even if you aren't into spice, you'll probably want to drown your meal in it, anyway. Delicious magic."}
{"text":"Great food great bartenders and great local crowd..and it's all in a cozy shack that's reminiscent of a bar by the beach.. I can see why it's always packed. Keep it up!"}
{"text":"We had the tofu scramble with the sausages. No complaints at all. Best vegan scramble in town. Not oily, clean tasting. Excellent food and service BUT two things. The wait was very long, so if you're in a hurry, not the place. The seating is for little people, and I mean small. No leg room. The bathroom was mediocre with a naked Prince theme in both. Too bad, because the food and preparation was great. And by the way...I will come again."}
{"text":"We went there for Veggielicious and I was impressed! For $22 we got a app (pickles or olives), a main (vegan pulled pork or beet burger) with a side (soup, salad or chili), a pint, and dessert (brownie or banoffee pie). The food was excellent and the service was great! We'll be back."}
{"text":"EL Ruddy is a great vegan cafe/bar/restaurant on Dundas West. I have been coming here for years and love the laid back attitude, reasonable prices, great food and friendly service.   While I would definitely recommend the food, if you're a carnivore you won't be wowed. I am not vegan but appreciate the fact that they have a wide selection of dishes that are. I usually order a simple grilled cheese which is always tasty and hits the spot. The chilli cheese fries are also pretty great. Everything is homemade by the owner Helena, and tastes great.   In terms of drinks, they have an extensive liquor menu and a variety of rotating taps. My go to is a pint of Beaus but they always have a tall can special, and they carry Loose Lips Lager in cans which is one of my favourites.  The only issue can be finding somewhere to sit as it's a pretty popular place. There is more seating at the back but I much prefer sitting at the bar where you can chat with patrons and the bar staff.  There are many decent bars in the area, but EL Ruddy is a firm favourite of mine!  Note: Cash only!"}
{"text":"E.L. Ruddy is a small, cozy cafe on Dundas St. W. with lo-fi charm. It takes it's name from the business that use to be located here back in the day. In fact the left wall use to be the outside wall to what was E.L. Ruddy, you can see the outer building lettering on the inside of this cafe, cool. I really like establishments that work a concept harmoniously with their surroundings, so big thumbs up to this cafe.   The staff are friendly, service is good. I've only had coffee here but I look forward to trying their veggie fair (might have to sneak bacon in my pockets). The coffee in question  is Ideal espresso. Not a big fan of Ideal but it's OK.   Really love the ambiance of the place with its retro knick-knacks on display, the old E.L. Ruddy on the wall,  the 60's diner furniture. Low key and unpretentious I recommend dropping in for coffee or a veggie meal."}
{"text":"Nice neighbourhood spot.  We are not vegetarians, but it still hits the spot.  Always good food.  People seem chill.  Definitely grab breakfast here if you can."}
{"text":"E.L. Ruddy is absolutely charming - I dare you to walk in the door and not gasp at its adorableness!  This cosy cafe out on Dundas West feels a little out of the way, but it's well worth the visit. From the mismatched vintage furniture and sugar pots to the shelves of books and nick-knacks lining the bare brick walls, the decor and atmosphere feels like you're just popping into a friend's place for a bite to eat. [Bonus points for the old signmaker's logo still showing on the wall - from which E.L Ruddy cafe took their name!]  There's a small menu - all-day breakfasts and a few salads & mains - but it keeps it simple for a small little cafe like this. Lots of vegan and gluten free options on offer, and a nice range of breakfasts. I opted for a vegan omelette, which was delicious & came with healthily sized sides of salad, home fries & GF toast. You even get a petite little bowl of fruit as an 'appetiser' with your breakfast. *Too* adorable!  I feel like E.L Ruddy's pretty much smack bang in the middle of the vego diner/cafe spectrum, equidistant from (the now defunct) Calico and Sadie's diner. Friendly service, delicious home-cooked options that won't grease you out entirely, and a very homey feeling means that I can't wait to get back and spend some quality time in this lovely cafe and try more of the menu (although those breakfasts will definitely be a lure in the future!)."}
{"text":"Their vegan grilled cheese is awesome and they serve PBR in mason jars. That's all you need to know."}
{"text":"E.L. has quickly become the favourite brunch spot for the beau and me. They serve brunch until 4pm and they make the most heavenly vegan omelette you'll ever taste. Seriously, no one other restaurant place in Toronto comes close rivaling this.   While I love the sweet & savoury version on the menu that features roasted sweet potatoes, I often get the special and have never been let down. From beets to broccoli cream, I can't help but feeling like I'm eating a really healthy breakfast that tastes and satisfies the same way an eggy, cheesy omelette would - but without the eggy stink! The omelette comes with roasted potatoes, which are always soooo good, housemade bread and a small salad.  The service is great! There's a guy and a girl who work there regularly and he is always good at remembering to clarify that we want the vegan omelette since we've gotten into such a groove, we sometimes forget they can't read our minds and that, heaven forbid, there could be any other version than my beloved tofomelette!  Speaking of other versions, I would be ever so tickled if one day they offered vegan waffles. I so love waffles and their strawberry compote here is amazing in the summer. I bet if they did make vegan waffles, they would be awesome. Plllllease try!  Some other wonderful things to note: Open for dinner and LICENSED. Yes, you can enjoy a glass of wine or a bottle of beer at a charming, little hippiester vegetarian cafe on a breezy summer evening. For some reason this is a real novelty in Toronto, vegetarian places that serve. The selection is short and sweet, just like the menu. The dinner items include gems like the burrito (vegan option with all the fixins, right down to sour cream), risotto, and pasta.  More loveliness: the coffee, the tea, the sucanat, the charming decor, walking through the kitchen to use the loo, the book shelves, the vintage bar which is part of the new set up, the music, the pantry items they sell *including* vegan Worcestershire sauce, and watching the sunset on Dundas in the early winter after a late, late meal.  Cash only. Not open Monday or Tuesday and no food service between 4-5pm.  5 star - I give my top marks to the charming El Ron Hubbarby, as it is known in my home."}
{"text":"Really mediocre. As a vegetarian I was looking forward to checking the place out. I won't be going back. I ordered the huevos yelapas- eggs with refried beans, salsa and corn bread. The refried beans tasted like they were straight from an old el paso can- no spice or flavour. The cornbread was too heavy to be nice, nothing wrong with it, but nothing right either. The salsa was a thimble full of anemic tomatoes with salt and the hash browns were just plain potatoes fried.  Everything was edible and fine, but  with so many good brunch spots in the area (what up Lakeview?) don't waste your time or money going here."}
{"text":"It is located a far bit away from the Ossington energy so it was a fair bit of walking for us to find it. We had no idea what to expect but I found this place using my trusty go to...the Yelp App! After walking for awhile we stopped to look at this place and realized that it was the E L Ruddy Co Cafe! I have to say the interior is very small...and not quite what I expected. Maybe because we were coming in at 9pm and it seemed darker then usual. Washroom is downstairs through the kitchen..I couldn't help feel that I was violating their space by going into the kitchen but I gotta do what I gotta do. Their menu is very straight forward sandwiches, soups and chilis. My friend ordered beet burger and chili (side) and I ordered burrito and lentil/spinach soup. The waitress never brought us any water so I got up and poured us some.   We got our food and it was very delicious, it took time to prepare because it didn't come out in 4 mins. More around 10 mins I'd say. I really found that the portions and flavour really was worth the money and I'd definitely come back. It was exactly what we needed on the cold fall night.  ALSO CASH ONLY. Kind of sucks that they don't take card."}
{"text":"I really want to give it 5 stars, I really do, but morally, I just can't. It goes against my self.  SO ANYWAYS  One morning, in my sober state yesterday, I was suffering from alcohol withdrawal and somehow the evil tricksters Roma + Val + Andrew + Sara convinced me to come to the corner of hipster and hippietown for some \"breakfast\"  Inside though, it was mad cute. Water bottles on the table w ere actually repurposed beer + san pellegrino bottles. Kinda hipster. Also the tables and chairs were mad hipster.   There was a library right next to us. So hipster.  ANYWAYS.  Let's get to the noms.  I had the vegan omelette special of the day. When in rome right?  I was served a lentil-chickpea flour patty that reminded me of something my mom would make. Think like a lentil dosa. It was different, and totally delicious. The toppings were mushrooms and something else I forgot. Woops. AND DAIYA CHEESE.  I think the Daiya has given me an epiphany. See...I love cheese. But it makes my tummy go NO. (Cuz I'm lactose intolerant, duh) BUT THAT SHIT WAS CRAY. SO DELICIOUS AND SO NON DAIRY!  Also served with some rabbit food (lettuces and pine nuts) and some delicious roasted potatez.  Sara KP had a mimosa and I hate her.    I might go back.  But don't tell anyone."}
{"text":"I really liked my experiences at E.L Ruddy.   This place is small and Antique Store-ish. They have cool store copies of all kinds of magazines, interesting books, Art done by Children for sale, and all kinds of Vintage things...A kind of European Cafe that sells pertinent items for the Vegan Cook, an cooks pertinent items for the Vegan. I love this place for so many reasons, I think the fact that they make amazing omelette's from Vegan Batter, instead of scramble is #1.   I am picky about Vegan food, as I am a fairly decent cook. I was impressed to say the least. I like that they serve a salad with the usual breakfast items. They bake their own bread on-site... AMAZING tasting, and also vegan. The Food Deserves a 5, but I couldn't do that because of something atmospheric.   My Photos speak for themselves in regard to the amazing food they are serving at very reasonable prices. The Service is great, and the ladies who work there are pretty accommodating, and recommend items on the menu. The ladies never know the special, and often have to go to the kitchen if you ask, but I am happy they're asking if they don't know.   I have a Singular Complaint, and it is because it could easily be corrected. It is VERY hot in this restaurant and the air is still, be it a fan or AC this would make eating there an even more pleasant experience.   The owner is amazing, and I will re-review them if they figure out a way to make the air a little less heavy. Dyson Fan Here we come!   I recommend this place for breakfast foods & good conversation. Occasionally the Lily Allen Music is WAY too loud, but that was only once...  PS: They have a communal table, HOW COOL... Many Photo's Included."}
{"text":"Went to E.L Ruddy's last night with no expectations. I am a recently converted vegetarian, so I am always on the lookout for delicious veggie options. Me and my boyfriend ordered a simple ginger ale (it was delicious) and a bruschetta app (small, but delicious). He got the Fennel Risotto (beautiful presentation, served with a side of salad and asparagus), and I got the soup and mini burrito combo (lentil soup was to die for,  the mini burrito was not so mini after all, filled me up perfectly!).   The reason why this review is not a 5/5 is because unfortunately the wait time is quite long, however, the food is prepared with care, and you will be happy you waited.   The atmosphere is very unusual, you wouldn't expect such good quality food in such a small, grungy space, but alas, the food is spectacular and the waitress was absolutely lovely!"}
{"text":"Was here for brunch a while back and it was really great! HOWEVER, have tried a couple of times since then to go back (around noon/1pm on the weekend), and it's been close both times. I think the hours might need updating."}
{"text":"Stopped by this spot with the bf for brunch on a recent Sunday afternoon.  Had been meaning to try it for a long while since it seemed to have vegan options and positive reviews, but I always prefer being able to scope out a menu before making a trip.  This \"blind date\" was most definitely worthwhile though!    Very small/intimate space consisting of a long bar area up front, a small seating area a few steps down in the back, and a slightly larger back courtyard patio.  The bartender/server was very friendly and came out shortly after we grabbed a table on the patio to give us menus and ask about drinks.  Grabbed a $5 mimosa and bf got a pint of something tasty and local, which I think was equally well priced.    Pretty well everything on the menu could be made vegan, but non-vegetarians don't fret...there are options for you too!  I got the vegan breakfast burrito and it was deeelicious!  Tofu scramble, sauteed veggies, vegan sour cream and melted daiya cheese.  I was also really amazed by the unique dressing on the accompanying green salad, and the house made hot sauce.  Bf had the granola bowl with yoghurt, bananas and quinoa flakes.  It was quite a large portion, filling and also tasted great.  Our meal including drinks came to about $33 with tax.  Very good price to quality & portion ratio.  This spot is ideal for grabbing food, a few drinks or both with a small group of friends. Will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended trying E.L. Ruddy for brunch this past weekend. It's new so I hadn't heard about it! I was excited because I am so sick of vegan friendly places like Sadie's for brunch - so disappointing, but that's another review. E.L. Ruddy is cute, quaint, and vegan and vegetarian. Oh ya, and delicious. I get WAY too excited when I can eat nearly everything on a restaurants menu. I want to order it all or take it to go so I can try it later in the day when I'm hungry again. Alas, I didn't do that here, but I will be going back soon.   I had the huevos yelapa, which apparently is the most popular brunch dish. In fact, I and my 3 other friends ordered it! You can still get eggs at this place, but I had the vegan version with 2 very flavorful marinated tofu steaks. The corn bread is to die for. I want more. Now. They have 4 selections of soup on the menu that sound incredible... cashew cream tomato... all of which are vegan and g/f. And there are 4 main lunch/dinner dishes that I cannot wait to try. A vegan shepards pie and a risotto dish, just to get you drooling.  Service was great and my favorite part was the establishment itself. It's so cozy and eclectic I felt like I was in a house. Being that this is the first review I ENCOURAGE you to try this place and then let us know what you think. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had wanted to go to E.L.Ruddy for a long time now, since having read Val G.'s raving review. Being east-enders, my sister and I weren't too interested in wandering to the west end. However, we actually ended up coming here on a rainy Saturday afternoon while looking for Vietnamese wedding gowns on Dundas. We peeked in and thought, \"Hmmm, E.L. Ruddy. That name sounds familiar ... wait! We've always wanted to come here!\"  E.L. Ruddy has a small, licensed little bar, and a long wooden table by an open window. Multiple signs screaming \"cash only\" are littered around the front door.   And brunch even at 2 pm?! Yes, please!  I'm just glad I didn't order one plate for myself, because the portions are very generous! My sister and I shared the vegan omelette with balsamic cherry tomatoes. It came with fresh, young arugula, sprinkled with pumpkin seeds and a light dressing. There were also panned roasted potatoes, more than the two of us could eat! The omelette itself was pretty solid, with Daiya cheese sprinkled on top (I would have preferred it melted on the inside).   Also a large tea menu - there's a whole separate page for it, including three types of roibos! The teas were listed as $2.75, but for some reason, we were charged $3 each. Oh well, no biggie. They were delish.  Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"The way I review it is if you are better value for money in all criteria, then you have 5 star. If you are value for money but good - 4 stars, if you are A-OK then A-OK.  This is what Fresh was 10 years ago. Indie with character and passion  This place is value for the money. Great ambiance, Awesome food (I wish I could get vegetarian and vegan food like this all the time). I had the tomato and cashew soup. Creamy and yummy as good as any cream of tomato and the sliders were also super YUM.  The service and the alcohol prices left a little to be desired. The price for food was a little on the pricey side for what you get but that is probably what good ingredients cost. The coffee and snacks are right on the money though.  The owner cooks with passion and is around so Go and support them!"}
{"text":"We got there for late breakfast, me and my friend. The girl at the bar told us to sit wherever as the place was pretty amply. The place is small and cozy ..and very very vintage which i loved :) I noticed right away a sign \"cash only\" -suck for me i only have debit on me. Grumpy lady at the bar telling me theres an ATM \"Around the corner \" . didn't find it. my friend went.she came back with cash. fine. finally sitting. the coffee is cold and un tasty . she never asked. never refilled it. We got what we ordered it was the vegan burrito and my friend got the vegan omelette . It was OK not to die for.  don't know if ill run there next time I'm hungry :\"}
{"text":"Our favorite little neighbourhood bar. Have not tried the food yet because we are meet eaters but Helena carries only local beer on tap and the company of the staff is a very \"at home\" feeling. This place is one of the places that make dundas west one of the top areas in toronto!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time to experience some Veggielicious http://www.veggielicious.ca/restaurants/ love and El Ruddy definitely delivered.  The word cozy does not even begin to explain the charm and casual warmth of this place.  The interior was a rustic yet effortlessly kitsch mash-up with clothes lined independant magazines and quaint little tchotchkas strewn about!  I loved that the bar table we sat at was an old glass window shutter that played off nicely with cool circa 1950's soda joint bar stools.    The food we ate here is honest-to-goodness, unpretentious, simple yet delicious and on top of all that, vegan!  Can we say AWESOME!  For starters we had the Cashew Yam Tomato soup with a corn muffin and it was the perfect bowl of pureed veggie warmth we needed.  My main entree was the Burritto, and the presentation was beautiful, with avocado slices neatly lined atop and an amazingly fresh Pico de Gallo along with vegan sour creme. Every bite was buritto bliss, with stringy Daiya cheesiness and even my salad was delightful with a nice crunch from the roasted pumpkin seeds. Hubby had the fennel Pea Risotto, and was so stuffed and impressed that a vegan meal could fill him with such heartiness, he almost had to un-buckle his belt!  We didn't think we had room for more, but saying no to dessert is criminal, so to finish I had the Mexican Chocolate Mousse which was smooth with bits of cocoa and a nice sting of cinnamon, and hubby had the rice pudding.  By the end you could stick us with a fork, 'cuz boy were we fully done!  The service we had was amazing, friendly and down-to-earth and the Doobie Bros, R.E.M and Prince tunes we're being played with CD's & vinyl, gotta love analogue! All this love and our bill (including a Liberty Ale) came to around $50 including tips.  Please note El Ruddy's accepts cash only.   Note to self : DEFINITELY must to return to El Ruddy's for brunch."}
{"text":"I probably would have rated EL Ruddy Co higher if I was in fact, vegan. I'm not, I love meat, but that is not quite the reason for just a three star rating.  This is a tiny place and only seats around 15 people or so. I ordered a plain omelette with a side salad. It was probably my fault for ordering something a bit boring, but the food was just that - quite bland and boring. My dining companions were a bit more adventurous and seemed to enjoy their food moreso than I did.  The hipster waitstaff here were very, very nice and friendly. Coffee was topped up often so I kept well caffeinated which is never a bad thing.  The bathrooms downstairs were quite grody and there was a giant dandy long legs staring at me as I peed, but it added to the charm and character of this cafe."}
{"text":"E L Ruddy Co Cafe is a tiny bar/restaurant west of Dundas and Ossington with a Mexicanny vibe. It's a cool, tiny place you'd totally miss if you didn't know it was there. We came here early in our pub crawl and it was a nice quiet place around maybe 8:30 pm on a Friday evening.   The barmaid was attentive and very pleasant. Drinks were generously poured and about $6.50 for a beer/spirit. The decor was very quaint and I do recommend sitting at the bar to soak in the atmosphere. It's quirky and makes you feel like you're having drinks at a friend's kitchen. Love the wooden bar tabletop.  Pro-tip: Perfect for groups of 2. Bad for groups of 4, unless you sit at the bar."}
{"text":"E L Ruddy is small. So small it reminds of someone house. Their kitchen is so small, smaller than most household kitchen and with one cook, the wait for food can be long and painful.   I would suggest order one of their drink specials, it will make the wait more bearable and they are so so delicious!   I tried Roobis Ginger Tea with Honey & Spiced Rum ($7) and Steamed Apple Cider with Ginger & Lemon ($5). Fresh chopped ginger tasted so good, and you can add a shot of bourbon for an extra $2.50.   When our drinks almost finished then the food arrived:  Omelettes - Vegan on a House Made Tofu-Veggie Patty with Daiya ($12)+Sweet Potato ($2) - The daiya cheese is surprising delicious and so was the tofu based omelette  Yelapa - Two Scrambled Eggs, Home Fries, Refried Beans, Fresh Salsa and House Made Corn Bread ($12) - love the refried beans, it is quite spicy too! Unfortunately the fresh salsa lack any taste aside from the freshness of the tomato...  E L Ruddy is a good choice to dine with Vegan and Vegetarian friends. As for me, I definitely will be coming back for some cocktails. I think I will be start making my tea at home with spiced rum!"}
