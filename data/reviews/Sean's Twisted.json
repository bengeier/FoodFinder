{"text":"I live very close by. I've been there to eat about 3 times. I would not recommend. Everything tasted pretty average. Food you could easily make at home."}
{"text":"Went in when empty and ordered a cheeseburger. Took 19 minutes to get the burger.  Price on the menu did not match the price I was charged. The prices in their computer did not match the price on their menu so I advise you double-check before you pay.  BTW. The burger patty was burnt.  Hopefully they are still working out the kinks of being a new business."}
{"text":"This place has some great food and prices are good . Have eaten here many times and have never left here disappointed . The chicken mayo is great as well as the beef stew . There are fancier places around as this place feels like the local watering hole but Sean is a great cook who can create different things with simple ingredients and not charge crazy prices.  The locals who come in and have beer and watch the leafs always seem friendly.  Look forward to trying new things on his menu"}
