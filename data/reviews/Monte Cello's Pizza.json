{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere for a family.  Very good value!"}
{"text":"This is a pizza place, first and foremost. But one would expect everything Italian to be good here. Personally we like their pizza. Nothing super specific, just regular old pizza. The ingredients are always fresh and I love the crust. It's crispy on the outside and soft inside. On a whim we got the cannolis, bad idea lol. There inside of the cannoli was fresh but the taste of the entire thing? Well. I'll just put it this way, those store bought cannolis with the pre-made shells and filling are like 50x better than these cannolis at Monte cellos. Sorry guys but you missed the mark!"}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight, must of had a lapse in judgement and ordered ravioli stuffed with crab, what was I thinking this is a pizza joint. They must have worked relentlessly to screw up their recipe on this one, this is so bad take if off the menu. If you know food this place is not for you in fairness to monte cellos they offered to take it off the bill but I told them not to do so. The cost was fourteen dollars not nearly enough to make something worthwhile ( what was I thinking) Finale thoughts if must go here keep it basic pizza, hoagies and salads"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have tried just about every pizza place in the Wexford/Allison Park area. This is by far our favorite. Can't go wrong with the calzones or pizza. He usually gets an individual deep dish and I'll get my own regular. SO GOOD and full of flavor. A lot of the other places we tries all tasted the same. Can't go wrong with Monte Cello's!"}
{"text":"Won't be back. I was hoping for some decent Italian food and they failed miserably. First off, I asked if they had a wine list. The server acted like it was a pain to go and retrieve it. My husband ordered a beer, and could taste that they don't clean their beer lines. The pasta I ordered was so gross I didn't eat it. The server was MIA until she brought the check. She seemed shocked that I didn't want a to-go box, so I replied that I didn't care for it. She tried to explain that their sauce is homemade. I surely hope not because it was just bad. We waited forever to get the check while the owner sat at a table behind us talking like a bigshot and caring less about his guests and the quality of food they are being served."}
{"text":"My young family just moved to the area and we ordered to celebrate our move in. There were tons of fresh toppings -- and by fresh I mean peppers and mushrooms still wet and not cooked  -- so less probably would have been more on this pie. As it was, the undercooked, mushy crust could not support the toppings. Was there sauce? I couldn't tell. A huge, tasteless disappointment for a surprisingly expensive pizza."}
{"text":"First off I have to say I would Never go or recommend this  place to anyone. The girl in the front was very rude and disrespectful she had a real attitude for no reason and bad customer service. The food was not the best especially for what I paid would not be returning really bad experience especially it being my first time going there. I would give it zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"This place was a favorite of mine growing up. moving back to the area, we ordered here a bunch or times over the past 8 years. However, in the past few years the quality of the food and service have gone way down, especially for delivery. It arrives always very late after given delivery estimates and frequently is the wrong order. For example, just this past week, a friend and I ordered calzone, a 1/2 sub, and side salads. The bread on the sub (which was made and charged as a whole) was completely soaked and the veggies on the lettuce seemed to be cooked. It was inedible. The calzone which had modifications was wrong. The side salads were fine. Management did credit my friend's account back, which is the only reason this review is 2 stars. It definitely wasn't worth the 1 hour 45 minute wait. Sadly, I'm done."}
{"text":"I live in California but if I could come to Pittsburgh more often to visit more often I would because this is my favorite place ever. I've been eating here since I was a kid and even used to work here when I moved out to Wexford for a year. Never disappoints! Also get a large pep with an Italian hoagie and a side of buffalo wings! Very family friendly and best pizza ever!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give negative stars. We ordered 7 pizzas for my sons birthday party to be delivered at 5:30 pm. We called at 5:40 to check on it. We were told the driver was on the way. 20 minutes later, still no pizza. We called back. My husband was told again that the pizza was on the way. He asked the employee on the phone to call the driver to find out exactly where he was. He was put on hold for a few minutes. Then the employee got back on the phone and said he just spoke with the driver and he is a few minutes away. 10 minutes later, still no pizza. I called and was told they just got hit with a huge snow storm (I was 5 minutes away, no snow where I was). The manager then got on the phone and told me the pizzas just went in the oven and had a million excuses for why they mixed it up. The mix up is understandable but the lies are not!!! We ended up having cake before the pizza and then eating pizza real fast when it arrived because we had to be out of the location the party was held. We had 20 hungry kids and their parents. It was very embarrassing!! The pizza wasn't even good when it finally did arrive."}
{"text":"A staple to the North Hills area, Monte Cellos has been dedicated to their customers for many years, I can remember how much of a treat going here was as a kid. The recent renovations of the facility have kept it current with the change occurring in Wexford. Excellent lunch buffet for under $10. Best traditional pizza in the Wexford area, if you are looking for a specialty pizza you won't find another pizza comparable to the buffalo chicken pizza. Excellent portions of quality food, I have never seen anything come out of that kitchen that didn't make me salivate.   My personal recommendations would extend to the fried zucchini and pepperoni rolls. There is nothing like them. Nice, quiet bar to watch the games at and the bartenders are always friendly. Plenty of parking, easy to find."}
{"text":"Have ordered take out two times from this location. Both times the orders were wrong. The first time one of our ordered items was a regular steak salad - they gave us a steak Caesar salad.  We live 10-12 minutes away so it wasn't worth calling, my husband just added tomatoes and other items from home.  Wasn't in a hurry to order again but here we are months later and we thought we'd try. Only ordered one pizza and a few appetizers. They package everything in brown cardboard containers so you can't check your order before you leave. Everything is taped shut. My husband asked if everything was in the bag. Girl says yes and walks away. So after unpacking the bag we are missing an item. A 9.50$ item. We call and she says 'we have a credit book, we'll write your name in it and next time you come in we'll credit your order' what?? Seriously? You screw up so much you have to have a 'credit book'?? Nah, doesn't sit with me - so my husband is on his way back to get our money back for the missing item. Why would I go back for a third time when it's going to be wrong again?? Ugh. Skip this place for take out for sure. Can't say how dining in is, haven't eaten in there for many years."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and ordered a pizza. Wasn't great, and wasn't even cooked all the way through. Almost nothing else on the menu looked edible, and the buffet looked terrible. Would not repeat this."}
{"text":"I've eaten at the Downtown Monte Cello's on many occasions.  Like the Downtown location, the Wexford Monte Cello's is a simple, solid three-star performer.   I stopped in here recently with some friends and co-workers after a morning's hiking.  I don't remember what the others ordered, but my 1/2 Italian hoagie and my cup of wedding soup were both very good.  Believe me, I love a good soup and 1/2 sandwich combo.  So Monte Cello's won't set the world on fire.  That's okay--it doesn't need to.  It's good basic food that really fills the bill."}
{"text":"This is your average pizza joint.  Food pizza always busy.....but I have no idea why people are coming back.  The service is so bad. I was sitting there for fifteen minutes before any employee asked if I were dining in.  Then they forgot my order then had to retake my order..... 20 minutes later. Then as we though the place couldn't get any worse, they have us the wrong bill!  Just go to some other place!  Yes, it is pizza but even better pizza can be found at whole foods!"}
{"text":"Sooooooo good!  We get the margarita and steak and ranch pizzas, excellent!!!!!  I wish they delivered but worth the drive!!!!"}
{"text":"Well we were hungry , thats all.   I think this pizza would be tasty for kids. The taste is not high quality for a foodie . The Sicilian crust  tasted like stale bread. It looked like the pizza crust you buy sealed on grocers shelves   The thin crust was better but pretty low quality.   It isn't a hand tossed pizza . We did like the toppings and gave the crust to the dogs .toppings were generous and visible, unlike large plain ,........  The sauce is kind of jar tasting, certainly not homeade like mama Lucias . It looks like ragu. It's a bit sweet and thickened looking.  I will say this. Wexford is a family place, not upscale or childfree. I think that's why the food is lower quality. We wouldn't order their pizza again but may try the eggplant parm or something else , but my expectations are low.  This isn't lawrenceville or penn avenue"}
{"text":"I've been to Monte Cello's before - it's one of my staples for good Italian food.   Tonight, my parents went for dinner around 6pm. We got seated right away in the main dining room. It was busy and noisy because there were multiple family birthday parties going on. Once those parties left, it was quiet and relaxing.   We started with the zucchini appetizer. I was assuming it would be the normal zucchini planks, but they were zucchini fries. It was an generous amount of zucchini. The zucchini was delicious.   For my entree, I ordered the chicken parmigiana. You get two sides - I chose a cup of wedding soup and side of penne pasta. The wedding soup was amazing - there were so many meatballs in each cup.   My chicken parmigiana was perfect- however, Monte Cello's has decreased their portions recently. The last time I went there - I got two pieces of chicken. This time, I only received one piece. The chicken was fresh - not frozen and I didn't have any gummy edges.    I'll definitely be back and I'll order the chicken Parm again soon."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Monte Cello's in the Pittsburgh area, and it a staple.  It's not the best pizza ever, but it's pretty good for Pittsburgh.  There isn't really any atmosphere, and there is always a kids baseball team in here celebrating a win.  The service is standard, but the food is good.  Food thoughts:  Buffalo Chicken Pizza:  My favorite take on this pizza.  It's spicy and tangy, but it's not so spicy that you can't eat multiple pieces.  Just the right amount of spicy.  The chicken is decent quality, but it's mostly little shredded pieces.  Meatballs:  My dad always orders a side of meatballs, and they're really good.  Lunch Buffet:  Good on a busy day.  Sometimes there aren't many people so the pizza sits a bit, but I still like it.  They have really good brownies on the buffet too. Mmm.  Essentially, I've never had anything bad here, and I've tried pretty much everything once.  It's a family style pizza place, and it's a good option in the area."}
{"text":"Monte Cellos has been a staple for my family for more than 20 years.  The recent renovations to the dining room give the restaurant a much warmer and more cozy feel.  The service is always friendly and the food is always fresh.    Must Try:  Steak Onion Ranch Pizza, Any Calzone, The Pittsburgh Chicken Salad, the Fried Zucchini and their Chicago Style Pie.   Awesome place."}
{"text":"Really good food but avoid this place AT ALL COSTS on Friday nights during the school year. We were quite disappointed to see the children from the nearby North Allegheny high school treat fellow patrons and the wait staff so disrespectfully. I'm sure that my wife and I spent more than two tables full of these kids. I can't see how this works for Monte Cellos. It definitely didn't provide a good experience for us and will not be good for you either. Friday night = No Monte Cellos."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local pizza places, Monte Cello's is a 'staple of Wexford life' as the previous reviewer said. The food isn't 'outstanding, omg best pizza ever' but it'll get the job done and is tasty.   I'd normally give it 4-stars, but the service is sometimes lacking and could use a little boost in customer service training."}
{"text":"I've only ever eaten at this Monte Cellos but I'm a huge fan of their Chicago style. With extra tomatoes it's even better!   I hardly ever drive out here and there's usually nothing but chains in the area so this is definitely a better option than most things in this area."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped to get drinks and food around 7pm on a Friday night. We were planning to sit at the bar but there were no seats. We walked over to the hostess stand to have them get us a booth in the bar and the hostess went right over to clear the dirty table. As she went back to get rid of the dishes, a woman sat down at the booth that was just cleared for us. We waited at the hostess stand (because the sign says wait to be seated in the bar) and we're expecting the hostess to ask the lady to move from the table. Unfortunately, the hostess noticed the lady sitting there and said to us \"oh, someone is sitting there now?\" She proceed to laugh at us and then say \"That sucks\". We were then told we could be put on a waiting list to get another table, but we decided to leave instead. If we were given that kind of service at the front door, what other bad service would we get at the table? We were looking forward to the food and drinks as the food smelled amazing before we even walked in. We will not be returning to this location again."}
{"text":"The parents love them some buffets so they booked an appointment with \"the kids\" for this specific Monte Cello's.  Not any Monte Cello's, and not the one closest to the ol' homestead: in their opinions it had to be this one.  I had called the day before to verify that they indeed do have a pizza buffet (yes), the hours (11-2), and the price ($7.99 per person).  This matched the parents' information so off we went, arriving at 1pm.  The parents are slow, methodical buffet eaters, so they wound up with a superior experience to the other half of \"the kids\" and myself, who shamelessly gobble our food and then (gasp) stop when we are full, even if we haven't tried everything.  Why this didn't work out well for myself or the other half is that the buffet was poorly stocked when we got there.  I understand it was 1pm, but they had a full hour to go and other buffet diners, so they should have hustled a little bit more.  Other half took just about all the salad that was left.  There were dregs of Italian wedding soup, which greatly distressed the parents who are obsessive followers of Italian wedding soup.  There was cheese, pepperoni, buffalo chicken, and Sicialian pizza with canned tomatoes, a few pieces of each.  I tried to pace myself, hoping things would get better.  I started with salad and 2 small slices.  Round 2 was the same (thankfully they refilled the salad).  The pizza tasted better than expected but was extremely greasy.  The first new pizza appeared around 1:30 and had veggies and sausage.  I ate some of there and stopped, however heretical that was.  The other half kept going.  It was only the intrepid parents that got to partake of the fresh pot of Italian wedding soup that appeared at 1:45pm and some of the new pizzas that were set out just after.  I sat on my hands and resisted it.  So who's fault was it?  Theirs or mine?"}
{"text":"I'll keep this review short and sweet. I ordered the \"Chicago Style\" deep dish with pepperoni: my go-to pie. Yah, I know I'm super original. I've eaten pizza in Chicago several times in my life and not once has it sucked. In this regard, my pizza was very Un-Chicago Style. Let me put it this way: I go back for seconds with average pizza. I paid $18 for this pie and I kinda just wanna throw the rest away. And then give it the finger."}
{"text":"18:19 the Monte Cello parking Lot was full so we assumed that it is a good sign.  My wife and I walked in and five people in the receiving area did not even acknowledge us.  We were the only ones at that point in time.  The awkwardness was heightened when no one paid attention as I was looking for someone to seat us.  We finally decided to leave when I asked why it seemed that they were complacent.  I could not believe it when one of the gentlemen said it's been slow time if the night.  Mind you, a full parking lot tables seem very occupied from the window.  I am speculating the we are not welcome and they prefer a certain genotype of customer.   We went off to Bistro 9101 which we will review later.  Aviva has better service and great pizza and alike."}
{"text":"I love Monte Cellos. They have the best chicken parm in town and they are always reasonably priced. My family eats there often."}
{"text":"I like their bacon pizza, stuffed shells, and wedding soup. But the item that I really loved was their Garlic Bread.  Their pizza crust is also very soft. (A good thing) But,  their sauce was a little thin,  but some folks prefer it that way! This restaurant all depends on people's point of views and opinions. I liked my pizza but my dad didn't! They have an interesting variety of desserts. Featuring the \"Connley Cookie\" and ho ho cake.  Mmm..."}
{"text":"Besides great food, the staff are just awesome!  We came on a Friday night with a large group and they took great care of us.  Check out the spinach and feta pizza. Friends who moved to Virginia make it a point to stop in and get some whenever they're in town and our teenagers go nuts over the Conley Cookie."}
{"text":"This is a Friday night staple in my family. I was raised in Wexford, so I've been ordering from Monte Cello's for as long as I can remember. The cheese sticks are among my all time favorite (my wife & I used to rate who had the area's best fried cheese). I've never in all my years strayed from ordering either a calzone or the pizza. It's always good. I know they have meals and salad there but that to me is like Norm walking in to Cheers and trying the merlot. Is it the best pizza ever...no. But it is good, the service has always been great, even delivery.  Also, they offer wheat crust, which while I know doesn't make pizza healthy, it does make it ever so slightly less bad, which not all pizza restaurants offer."}
{"text":"Delivery was faster than they said it would be. Got a regular with green peppers and pepperoni. Also got a Sicilian, which is a thick crust square delight. Both were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of cheese and there was no skimpin on the toppings. It was fast and friendly and yummy too."}
{"text":"'Scuse me.  Excuse me.  This place is the staple of Wexford life.  You either have it delivered to your door or you come here, you get a crappy iceberg lettuce salad and then you gorge yourself with their perfect pizza.  If you're me then Dad orders a beer or two and Mom drives home.  You chortle in the backseat with your sister.  End of story."}
