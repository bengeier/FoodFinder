{"text":"I didn't eat at the restaurant. I ordered delivery. 

I had the truffle mac and cheese and added lobster for an extra $10. While the mac itself was delicious, the lobster was disappointing. The $10 got me 3 extremely tiny pieces of lobster. They really shouldn't have bothered putting any lobster in.

It was definitely a disappointment and not worth the money. 

Won't be eating/ordering from here ever again"}
{"text":"So disappointed in this restaurant. My friend and I were very excited and looking forward to this lobster focused restaurant, so focused on lobster, they only have four dinner items on their menu.  Unfortunately, they were out of half of their menu!! On a Friday night no less.  And if you only have four items, one of the things you most definitely shouldn't be out of is the lobster dinner itself. 

Oh and when we inquired about dessert, turns out, there is only 1 dessert item and guess what?  Out. Ridiculous. Would not recommend this place and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Tried the walk-up window first because we were early.
Couldn't find the menu, as we didn't think to look on the floor because, you know, who looks on the floor for a menu. Possibly the dumbest idea ever. Then again, we hadn't been inside yet. Service was slow, which at least delayed my having to taste the horrible beverage. But it's Sam James coffee! So even if you don't like your drink, you'll get a free side of pretension. 

Slow being sat, despite the reservation. Slow being acknowledged at our table. 
We knew the menu ahead of time (thank goodness), but allowed the poor server to mumble through it, barely heard above the background music, anyways. What a stupid idea (and what in the world has this restaurant against menus?). I wonder how many times a server has to repeat his/her self. For us it was agony. Good luck when you're required to inform the customer of dietary or nutritional content. 

Ordered a standard cocktail and a moderately priced bottle of wine. Took 20 minutes for it to reach our table, along with the 'sommelier' owner who obviously can't get over the sound of his own voice. Learned he had tasted the wine before dropping it off. Good for him. I'm pretty sure I know what corked wine tastes like, but as long as he enjoyed drinking my wine without my permission I guess he's doing his 'job'. 

Our dishes didn't come out together, but that would have been ok if they both weren't terrible. The quarter-pound lobster was rubbery/chewy with a side of sour. The lobster roll was small, the bun was a glorified wonderbread hot dog bun seemingly pickled in oil, and our fries were a salt bomb. 

And about those salt mine fries. If I hadn't asked I wouldn't have known or been told, about the fact that the fries are made...in lard. That's right. Rendered pork fat. Like it or not, I wouldn't have known. And that's a problem. See, that's the good thing about menus. Because if they had menus, people who perhaps wouldn't want to eat pork or can't, would know this. But instead they are in the hands of idiotic restaurateurs and twenty-nothing fashion student servers. I can't wait for the inevitable complaint to the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal about this one.  

At least the salads were salads. Slow clap. But, you know, we left feeling lucky because the table next to us couldn't order the quarter-pound lobster because they ran out. 

They. Ran. Out.

I'm sorry, my bookstore ran out of books. My shoe store doesn't have any shoes. 
Unbelievable. 

At least they had one terrible dessert for us to choose from. 

Who in their right mind would need to open up a restaurant where every facet of it contains some gimmicky pointless try-hard grasp at originality (that ultimately fails horribly)? The people responsible for this disaster of a 'restaurant'. That's who.

Save your time and money. This place does not have a single redeeming point to it. Also I'm never reading Toronto Life again. I have no idea what they must be smoking."}
{"text":"I read about Lbs. on Buzzfeed and it seemed like a great spot. When I arrived I found the decor a little upscale compared to the food I was anticipating. This place doesn't have a written menu, instead you get a choice of lobster roll, quarter lobster, or bacon cheeseburger with sides (fries and salad) and a special (tonight was lobster poutine). The choices were told to us by the waitress. They have an extensive and inventive written cocktail menu. We ordered the burger to share, it was very good. It had peameal bacon and a melted white cheese (havarti possibly?). My friend got the quarter lobster, it was good. It's broken down for you allowing for easy eating, my friend prefers to break apart her own lobster but said this was probably an easier way for most patrons. I ordered the poutine, pretty basic with very little lobster. I found the gravy to be way too salty and the cheese is not a traditional curd, rather a salty cheese tasting similar to a manchego. I thought the cheese or the gravy could have been less salty (or both), but putting them together ruined the balance. I ended up giving most to my friend. Great cocktails, amazing service, amazing burgers, good lobster. I'd suggest sticking to the regular menu options, it seems they have had more time to perfect them."}
{"text":"Similar experience to Sam W. below.... major disappointment for us.. went for fiancee's birthday dinner./.. 120$ later for two people and so not worth it ...   Manager was nice enough to comp two drinks when we waited around 80 minutes for our entrees...ridiculous ..... food is O-K....
Drinks were nice
Fiancee enjuoyed his oysters.... 

then the entrees....
and the LOONG ass wait


 they forgot half my fiancee's surf and turf....THE manager HIMSELF delivered the plate after we complained about the wait...... and there was a problem -WHERE was the surf? 

--- how did he NOT see the tiniest portion of lobster that was plated ???? sorry but if you're delivering it to a table yourself because of a prior screw-up (absurdly LONG wait) , you'd think you'd CHECK the plate pretty well...  

I'd understand the 80 minute wait if the restaurant was rammed and SO so busy.. it was NOT .....and ambience was mediocre... not a place for a Saturday night romantic dinner--great for a Bay street lunch of dudes in suits I'm sure.... 


stick to Wah sing for lobster and bang for your buck along with fast service !! !"}
{"text":"Entering the establishment was an enjoyable experience. Music was modern electronic without being too overbearing. 

Service was adequate. Servers came quickly and were attentive to all our needs.

Drinks: raspberry lime pop made in house was spot on, not too sweet but flavorful and pleasant with a meal. 

Appetizers: lobster mac and cheese could have used a bit more lobster for the size but pasta was good. Oysters were fresh but a little too much liquid sitting in the shell for my liking. 

Entree: steak and lobster with fries. Fries weren't hot when they arrived and a little soggy but salted just right. Steak was cooked to a medium rare that kept me wanting more, with the lobster cut appropriately for easy access to meat. Salad was made with a good amount of dressing that wasn't overbearing.

Dessert: ice cream cookie peanut butter and marshmallow. Peanut butter was eh, but marshmallow was fluffy and surprising didn't taste too much like gelatin.

Overall experience was great, but not extraordinary."}
{"text":"So I know it was winterlicious but our bill was still $350 for 3 people and everything was pretty horrible. Crab cakes were mush like baby food and mostly tasted like potatoes. The worst I have ever had. Lobster was seriously over cooked, chewy and cold. Obviously previously frozen ( is the only explanation of how you could screw up lobster that bad) and the \"ice cream sandwich \" was pathetic. Such a waste of money."}
{"text":"I was surprised this place only had a 3-star rating, but after going to Winterlicious for dinner I think I get why. 

The ambience and decor is definitely nice, we were packed a little tightly but I guess that's to be expected for Winterlicious. Coat check was a plus. 

I ordered the crab cakes, lobster, and panna cotta. The crab cakes were decent but a little soft and mushy in terms of texture, also wished the salad came in a larger portion. The lobster was quite bland, and the vegetables were weirdly spicy, but also kind of bland and needed more salt. My friend ordered the soy steak, and said the texture was really good and that the steak was well cooked, but it was too salty. Panna cotta was pleasant to eat, the meringues were tasty. 

I feel like some of their menu items definitely would be worth ordering, but a lot of the flavours we had last night were quite weird and unbalanced."}
{"text":"4 choices - $22 price fixed menu. Service was blah, food was super salty and no flavour. We left and were still hungry. We had the 1.25lb lobster (shell and head included in weight) and the lobster roll. Can't imagine they are going to stay in business much longer."}
{"text":"good lobster salad. Great service. Nice surroundings. Toronto you are paying too much for your dining.  Price plus tax plus tip????"}
{"text":"It was ok. Went for lunch with a group of people from work and I knew it would mostly be for the ambience. The interior is beautiful and worth the mark-up on the food that they serve. 

I had the lobster roll. I read a Toronto Life review that said it had 4 ounces of lobster so the price seemed reasonable. When I talked to the server about it, she said it was 3 ounces so either Toronto Life doesn't fact-check or lbs has paired down the portion since the article was published. The roll tasted great. The fries were great. 

The SALAD came in a small bowl, whole leaves with the dressing on top. Clearly this salad is meant to be eaten last because how else are you supposed to cut your own salad unless you dump out the whole leaves onto your empty plate? I expected more than to have to cut my own damn salad leaves for the price.

Wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"Love the name.

Décor, ambience. Nice.

Food  - was good, but not mind blowing. I found the prices to be a bit strange. $4.00 for a small dipping sauce? Hmm...
For lunch I got the burger that came with fries and a salad. 

Service - was very good. Attentive and got us our food quick and easy.

I would return again to try seafood on their list next time."}
{"text":"Awful!!! They ran out of everything at an 8 o'clock reservation!  One dessert and they were out of it!  Then the owner didn't even apologize. Worst experience ever! And I eat out a lot!
I will never go back and the owner definitely didn't seem like he cared."}
{"text":"Food experience here was pretty good. With just 4 items or so main courses it's pretty easy to narrow down your options - I had the lobster, which along with the fries and salad did fill me. It was very fresh and tasty. I sprung $4 for the extra lobster gravy and it was worth it, especially to dip the fries in. It's not a lot quantity-wise though.

The fries are MAD SALTYYY. I should've listened to the reviews here and asked for no salt/salt it yourself. The salad dressing was also on the sour side but it's nice to get some greens, without having to choose between fries or salad. (And actually I don't think I'd be full if I only got one side.)

Logistically, this place definitely has some issues to sort out. I seem to have had the same issues with others regarding not being sat down at empty tables. I arrived at close to 6 with my group, and found out they lost our reservation made via the phone. 

So...we ended up sitting at the bar, even though the vast majority of tables were empty and remained empty. It made catching up with old friends rather difficult when you have 4 people sitting side-by-side but we made do. (For that reason, we also opted to skip dessert here.)

Also, don't expect your food to come out all at once.

The bartender was luckily very friendly, though he did ask like five times whether we were ready to order. The cocktail drinks we got were really good...and strong. A little on the pricey side (~$15 range for most), but it is what it is, for the financial district anyway. Expect a mix of people eating at the bar and the Bay Street crew standing around with drinks in the middle of the week. 

Overall verdict: good food overall but if you're worried things might go wrong (and they likely will) I'd wait a few months to let the place work out the kinks before coming. If you're feeling adventurous I'm sure you'd be fine."}
{"text":"Talk about mixed reviews! 

I will say I had a positive experience at lunch time. Great decor, love the ambiance, good service, and I enjoy the concept of their simplistic menu. 

All 4 items on the menu are the same price at $22 with the option of adding on flavoured butters and sauces which I did not opt for.  

I ordered the 1.25lb lobster served with fries and salad. For this price, it was definitely a steal! Why would anyone opt for a tiny $22 lobster roll instead? Anyway, my lobster was super tender and juicy and was cooked to absolute perfection. I really can't complain about anything with my experience!"}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious, wanted to add on top of the meal with some drink and special.

Daily Special? A table can't have double promotion.
Yelp Check in to get $5 off a drink?  A table can't have double promotion.

Basically, you are only allowed ONE discounted item a sitting. This was explained personally by the manager.

We had the seafood winterlicious menu, and ordered off the REGULAR menu for the seafood platter, fried chicken and an ice cream sandwich.

The winterlicious ice cream sandwich was better then the regular menu
The seafood platter was alright - but there's better alternative in Toronto.

Our table was glad we came on a \"discounted\" meal.  We will spend our money elsewhere for seafood next time. We were not wowed by food, options, nor service."}
{"text":"We tried this place a few weeks back. It is a small, yet beautiful venue. We started with some oysters and then ordered the lobster roll, Brussels sprouts and the lobster corn donuts. 

The lobster corn donuts were sweet and savory and just delicious fried goodness. It had a light drizzle of parsley sauce on top and to dip in which cuts through the grease.

The lobster roll was ok. Decent portions but a bit too expensive ($35) for the portion size. Also, it was missing something to bring it together. Overall, I've had better. As for Brussels sprouts, it was tasty but nothing spectacular. 

Overall, a 3.5!"}
{"text":"Came here for the winterlicious lunch menu as my friend is a big lobster fan. It's probably one of the more classy style seafood places that are not overly kitschy if you know what I mean. They do get the financial district crowd so make sure to make a reservation even on a weekday. The food was great. The portions was pretty good, my salad came with a decent amount of flakes fish which had a perfectly smoked Flavour. I can't remember the type of fish it was but for someone that doesn't really like fish this is saying a lot. We of course got the lobster roll that comes with a side of fries. Really nice fresh tasting lobster. I got the pan a cotta as dessert."}
{"text":"We were in town for 3 nights staying very near lbs.  I had not planned on going there but our hotel's concierge (The Adelaide) recommended it and boy were we glad he did!

The food as well as the service was excellent.  I had the Berkshire pork chop and it was stunning it was so good - and an excellent pork chop is much harder to find than an excellent steak.  It was perfectly done with a wonderful sauce.

My wife had the tuna tartare and she said it was wonderful as well.

They have a fairly new chef, who we met.  Very nice guy.  Point is - don't read to much into older reviews - give this place a chance.

Service was friendly - all in a great experience."}
{"text":"All the items on their menu (burger, lobster and salad) are $22! Loved the decor in this restaurant. I had the lobster and it was quite good, i liked the fact that they practically deshell most of it for you so it's easy to eat! The salad was good, the fries were super crispy but a tad bit on the salty side. I would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a cheaper alternative for a lobster dinner !"}
{"text":"Came here with the intentions of Winterlicious, ended up ordering off the regular menu. 

Between the two of us, we ordered the lobster mac and cheese, oysters, fries, and brussel sprouts. 

The lobster mac and cheese's pasta was cooked perfectly, not too soft but not too chewy. It came with large chunks of lobster mixed in and a large lobster claw to top it off. The cheese was creamy yet light. The dish wasn't heavy, compared to other mac and cheese dishes, but it was certainly filling enough for two people. 

The oysters were fresh, nothing too outstanding, but I enjoyed them. I heard they do buck a shuck on Thursdays so I'll have to come back for that another time... 

The brussel sprouts were crispy and slightly sweet with the sauce. There were large juicy chunks of \"bacon\" incorporated. I thoroughly enjoyed and loved this dish and the way it was executed. 

On the other hand, the fries was the only dish that was lacking. I felt there was something to be desired, perhaps a little more seasoning or bite. 

Overall, the food was amazing and the service was great. 10/10 would come back"}
{"text":"It's a gorgeous looking restaurant but with mediocre food and snotty service, I won't be coming back. I got the 1.25lb lobster meal - my lobster was actually decent but the side fries were bland and the salad was soggy from the dressing."}
{"text":"I've passed by lbs several times and because I absolutely love seafood (and lobster), I've been meaning to try out their food for some time. Also, I love controversy and there was recently some controversy on how lbs kill their lobsters. 

So, even though lbs's specialty is lobsters, their Summerlicious lunch menu lacked ANY lobster. I don't even think their dinner menu had lobster. But it's okay because it's SuMMerLicIOUS. 

I came here with a friend during my lunch break around 11:45. The interior of the restaurant is very nice and way fancier than I thought it would be. (I mean, it's located in the PATH and across a Pizzaiolo). It had a nice blue and white kind of wash, which is very expected of a seafood restaurant, but I loved it. Great ambience. It got super packed around 12:30 and there was no wonder why I had to make reservations two days in advance.  

I ordered: 
Appetizer - Smoked fish rillets
This was good! The bread was really crumbly and melted in your mouth. I could have eaten more and more of this. 

Entree - Fried chicken
NOT a fan of this dish. The djon mustard overpowered the cabbage way too much and it had a wasabi/spicy kind of after-taste. The fried chicken was alright. Honestly, I only ordered this because I didn't think their other seafood dishes would be filling. I REALLY wanted to order the PEI mussels because I've been to PEI and binge ate ALL THE MUSSELS, but I was quite hungry and not in a mood for tasty but not filling. 

Dessert - Strawberry shortcake ice cream sandwiches 
My friend joked, \"Straight out of the freezer\" because these sandwiches were really hard. The sandwiches were made out of, I don't know, seemed like a pie crust that was hardened in the fridge. It was pretty good, although I imagined \"strawberry shortcake ice cream sandwiches\" as fresh strawberries and vanilla ice cream in between \"sandwiches\". But it wasn't. It was a vanilla ice cream in between sandwiches with a strawberry coulis at the bottom of the plate. 

Overall, I think I set myself up for failure and I'm kind of disappointed in myself for not ordering those PEI mussels. I WANT THOSE PEI MUSSELS NOW. I'm not sure if lbs should have chosen a better menu for their Summerlicious because I don't think it was at all representative or a taste of what their real menu was like. 

Meh, oh well. If there is a next time, I will order some lobster.  

TLDR; If you go to a seafood restaurant, don't order non-seafood stuff."}
{"text":"Had a chance to check out this place with a few friend and it was quite good. Although very pricey - it was kinda expected at a seafood restaurant in the heart of Financial District.

The Restaurant itself is very bright (great for photos) even though I came at night - I can tell because of floor to ceiling windows haha  great modern decor and seatings - good for a business lunch or dinner - or even a fancy date.

They have an extensive drinks menu and I thoroughly enjoyed the scotch selection from Highlands to Macallan to Dalmore 

The seafood is extremely fresh and the mussels were really good! But the star of the show was the Pistachio crusted Rack of Lamb. Oh lawdy it was cooked perfectly medium rare and I died.

The fish we had was actually over cooked... not sure what to say about that but - get the lamb."}
{"text":"We came here for Winterlicious, which admittedly is probably not the best time to showcase what a restaurant can do. It was busy, and the wait staff did the best that they could with the crowds. I had the crab cakes as the app. It was decent, but not memorable. The 1 lb lobster was mushy (lots of reasons for that if you Google it). The yummy donut ice cream sandwich, heralded online as being one of the better ones in Toronto, was underwhelmingly small."}
{"text":"A well-rounded take on seafood; on one hand, you have your traditional oyster platters and such, the other you have entire fish deep fried. Coming in for lunch on a weekday it was not busy at all and we were quickly seated in a spacious area. The waitresses and hostess were extremely polite and friendly, never failing to answer any questions regarding the menu. We ordered the shrimp pasta which had well-prepared pasta that was covered in a rich tomato sauce with a number of shrimp. My only complaint was the lack of flavour in the tomato sauce; it honestly had that jar tomato sauce taste which was disappointing considering the cost and expectation for the utmost quality. We ordered the seasonal fish which was prepared lightly fried and with a variety of sauces to adorn the fish. The preparation of the whole fish was well done, and major props for the amazing sauces that were true to their unique flavours. One was a caper and butter mix, the other was dill and lemon. Overall, a great seafood resturant! It is a little bit on the pricey end, but for the service and quality of food, its definitley worth a try and return!"}
{"text":"First, I wanted to try this restaurant on the thursday before a long weekend (june 30) at 9pm. It was no where close to full and they wouldnt seat us because they said they were full with reservations. I made a point that it was 9pm and half empty but they wouldn't seat us still.

Tried calling over the weekend and left a voicemail but never received a callback. Turns out they close on long weekends but didn't bother to put signage on the door.

Made reservations on July 5 easily for friday night (july 8) at 8pm for 2. Ordered a standard cocktail and a speciality cocktail to go with the pound and a half lobster and lobster roll that both come with a side of salad and fries. The drinks were great, but that was the best part of the meal.

The pound and a half lobster was sour and seemed a tad undercooked. You wouldn't notice if you dunked it in butter. The lobster roll was tasteful but wasn't filling. We sent back the fries twice because it was way too salty. Third time was a charm.

Ive been to burger and lobster in london which is similiar in concept, but far better in quality. Probably wont come back here unless their quality improves. They also ran out of pound and a half lobsters by 9PM which prompted the table next to us to walk out (didn't help that they weren't acknowledged by a server 10 mins into sitting down) and the restaurant didnt get a burger order right for the table on the other side.

A table of 2 complained that a lobster restaurant shouldn't run out of lobster and was able to get a free glass of champagne for each of them.

Not the greatest start to a restaurant,  but if they work through their issues could be a great spot in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised coming to this place.

Décor: 5/5

They décor was lovely very high end, elegant and modern feel to it. I love their chairs and the tables were a stone or marble table top and the booths were very comfy. The glassware also looked very expensive. They have cool looking round lights.

Atmosphere: 3/5

The place had a very elegant and posh feel to it. Which was a bit at odds with their menu, where the mains were priced at $22. But overall liked to ambiance of the place. For a Tuesday night it was relatively quiet.

Service: 4/5

Staff and waitress were attentive. The food arrived promptly and they were very good on the timing between each of the different courses.

Food: 4/5 

We came on Tuesday when they had a $1 oysters. Highly recommend coming here if you like oysters. The oysters were fresh and ranged in size from small to medium. They were well cleaned, and I loved the horse radish that came with the oysters. It wasn't too strong. For appetizers we also ordered the lobster poutine which was delicious. There was a good amount of lobster, and the cheese was nicely melted. It wasn't too salty and fries were shoe string fries.  

My husband ordered the 1.25 lbs lobster, which is a decent size and priced well. It also included salad and fries. The lobster wasn't as sweet as others that I've tried, but it was good. Overall the lobster was cooked well except for the lobster claws, which were slightly undercooked. The great thing is that they prepped and cracked the lobster so it was relatively easy to eat. The fries were nice and crispy and the salad was fresh. The salad although simple, was done well. I liked to Boston bib lettuce with the radish and the dressing that it came with was nice and refreshing. I ordered the lobster roll, which also come with fries and salad. The bread was soft, but nicely toasted. The lobster had a creamy sauce/mayo, but didn't over power the lobster. The fries were hot, nice and crispy, and not overly salted. I liked this, but next time I would get the whole lobster instead. 

The lobster bisque was delicious and really good. Highly recommend it. It had a nice smooth creamy texture, and had nice lobster flavour. It also came with bits of lobster, which was a nice touch.

Make sure to get dessert you won't regret it! For dessert we got the ice cream. The burnt marshmallow ice cream was to die for! It was so good! It was creamy, but not only sweet, with bits of caramel and marshmallow in it. The best part is that is actually like burnt marshmallow. This was probably the best burnt marshmallow ice cream that I've ever tried. If you are looking for something more tart I recommend the lemon meringue. The lemon meringue was nice a refreshing, and also had a nice smooth creamy texture. At $4 a scoop it's reasonably priced.

I enjoyed my meal here and would be back again."}
{"text":"Given the ratings on here, I was hesitant before I came here, but I was pleasantly surprised. 

Our waitress was nice and patient, despite how long it took us to order. She brought over a sommelier when we were trying to pick a bottle of wine. 

We ordered the mac and cheese to share and the 1.25lb Nova Scotia lobster for our mains. I wouldn't say the mac and cheese was anything too special - there was the truffle that added a nice touch for sure. For $22, you get a whole lobster, a salad and some fries. The part that disappointed me was the \"house salad\", which was essentially some whole lettuce leaves and a few slices of beets. I really like the thin, crispy fries though. I don't think you can get a whole lobster at a nice restaurant for anything less than this price, so I do think it's a better deal than anything else on the menu. 

I would say that the service speed was normal, a little on the slow side if you take into account the fact that the restaurant wasn't very full. At least, I hope, that means all my food was freshly cooked? 

The price of that 1.25lb lobster is the highlight for me and because of that pricing, I'm going to give this place a 4 star rating. Also...it's right on Yonge street in the middle of the core financial district - so take that into account when you evaluate its pricing."}
{"text":"Went here to enjoy a winterlicious menu over the weekend. 

Overall I have it a 3 because I think it's a solid average place.

Interior/service- very nice interior and the music is alternative and nice and the service is great. They checkup on you regularly and refil water and change your cutlery for each dish. So yes service was very nice.
Took me a while to find parking so if you're going make sure to go early to find street parking nearby 

Food- I got the seafood chowder came with sourdough toast. By far my favourite item I tried and was quite hearty and lots of seafood. Got the 1 lb lobster as main with vegetables. Pretty average I mean lobster is lobster. And g it panacotta for dessert. It was alright nothing wrong worth trying. 

My wife got the crab cake which was a little bland. She said she much more likes the one from elsewhere. She also got the clam pasta which she found delicious with ample clams. And for dessert she got a coffee ice cream sandwich which was in a pastry like sandwich. That was also delicious and unique however slightly small side. 

So in summary food was fine. Ambience is good with lots of seating. Parking is a bit tough to find but that's downtown for ya. Definitely better seafood places out there for far cheaper that'll fill you up far better. I then went and got a hotdog. But that's just me."}
{"text":"If you're like me and love food with big flavours, this may not be the place for you.  I found the dishes we ordered to be on the bland side, mind you it was a whole lobster with butter, so i wasn't expecting a punch of flavour.  However the lobster was slow steamed which meant that it was served luke warm and texturally soft almost raw tasting.  The lobster itself had zero taste but I've been to PEI and had lobster there which was amazing.  Since the lobster was from Nova Scotia I did hope it was a repeat of PEI but I was disappointed!  Other things we ordered were tuna tartare (interesting but wouldn't order it again), steak (had better for sure), maple syrup brussel sprouts (these were killer good!) and the donut ice cream sandwich (simple but so good).  They don't care much for pretty plating.  I kinda expected to eat with my eyes since I was paying $200 for our meal.  All in all I wouldn't go back anytime soon.  I had to ask them to re-steam my lobster which they gladly did for me.  Service was great but thats about it.  Would I recommend this place?  Probably not. There are much better places for $200!"}
{"text":"Came here for the winterlicious dinner menu.

We ordered the crab cakes and seafood chowder for appetizers, the lobster for the main course, and the panna cotta and ice cream sandwich for dessert. 

The seafood chowder was mediocre and a bit bland. The crab cakes were flavorful but I have a sneaking suspicion that it's because it was salty. The lobster was also mediocre, not especially fresh or flavorful. It lacked that sweetness that came with fresh seafood. For a seafood restaurant, the seafood was not fresh at all. The dessert was good, but it's hard to screw up dessert. Though I do recommend the ice cream sandwich over the pan a cotta, which could have been creamier. We also tried the lbs cocktail and it was pretty good.

Overall, the service at the restaurant was great and the ambience was great for date night. The cocktails were definitely better than the food. I would come back for the cocktails but probably not for the food."}
{"text":"Came here for Winterlicious. Just a short walk north from King and Yonge.  Had reservations with my friend to sit at the bar.  We assumed it would be more of a restaurant with the usual bar table but lbs seems to be more of a place for \"after work drinks\".  Half of the seating is around the bar (square bar area).  Nice decor.  Everyone was dressed nicely (suits, office clothes).

My friend and I got pretty much the same thing for Winterlicious ($44 dinner): seafood chowder, 1lb lobster, and I got a pannacotta (she got the ice cream sandwich)

Chowder was tasty but not amazing. Decent portion and you could taste/feel bits of seafood in it. Came with two slices of toasted bread (mine was a little burnt)

Lobster was ok. Cooked just right and sliced up and cracked so I had to do minimal work to open it up. Came with some melted butter on the side and some spicy rapini (it was a little too spicy for me so I didn't touch it). 

Pannacotta was nicely presented in a glass dish. Wasn't very sweet (in comparison to pannacottas that I've had at other places). Came with strawberry jam or compote on top.

My friend enjoyed her ice cream sandwich (it was kinda like a churro ice cream sandwich)

There was a woman sitting a few spots away from me and she got the steak option for Winterlicious and it didn't look very good (small portion and it didn't look very appetizing... Looked like a brown gravy mess on mashed potatoes).  She asked why her steak dinner didn't looked like some other guy's dinner (she pointed across the bar to some other meal) and the bartender said that the guy's order was from the regular menu and not the Winterlicious menu (his food looked good... Looked like a proper steak and had a side of veggies and potatoes).

Server was attentive and friendly.  All in all, a decent meal. Not the best seafood dinner I've had but it was ok."}
{"text":"Ibs. is a chic and posh restaurant with a menu devoted to lobster, crab and other fresh seafood. The service is attentive as is to be expected at an upscale restaurant such as Ibs. 

To start, we had a few cocktails. The cocktails were creative and delicious - a great way to start an evening.

While all of the dishes were excellent, there were three standouts: (1) fried chicken; (2) the lobster; and (3) seafood pasta. It may seem odd for me to praise the fried chicken dish for a review of a seafood restaurant. However, the fried chicken (which was loaded with maple syrup sriracha and served with brussels sprout) was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. It was incredibly flavourful. The lobster meat was sweet, savoury and succulent.  The pasta was perfectly cooked.

lbs. is on the pricier side. You are paying for the atmosphere, service and quality of food. If you are looking for reasonably priced seafood with no bells and whistles - lbs. is not the place to go. Ibs. is a great option for seafood if you are looking for a restaurant to impress."}
{"text":"You would think a place with only three items on the menu (Lobster Burger Salad) would have spent the effort to make them outstanding.   You would be wrong.

Lobster (tasteless)
Burger (too salty)
Salad (not attempted,  but the couple next to me seems to have an issue with its dressing)

I guess I should have known, when I visited the washroom and noticed the soap dispenser was a portable one leaning off the towel dispenser.  Frankly, I suspected.  A planner who doesn't pay attention to minor details may not be capable of it.

I liked the concept and was rooting for it.  I suspect that it will only stay in business if it can learn to adapt or lucks out with the nice location."}
{"text":"I went to Lb for lunch and ordered the 1.25 lb lobster. The name was catchy and I've read about it online so I decided to give it a try. 
It was nice that all the shells were cracked in advanced, even the tiny parts and it made it easier to eat. I didn't think the lobster was cooked right, as a result it affected the texture and flavour of the lobster. I reminded myself this is not the normal lobster that I usually have when I travel to Halifax. However, I did like the truffle aioli.
The speciality soda was refreshing and nice ambiance."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me here for my birthday dinner. The restaurant is gorgeous, definitely Instagram-worthy. Unfortunately, the food was less than mediocre. We ordered mussels and the surf & turf for 2. The mussels were good but the lobster and steak was cold and bland. The rapini was really gross too. The 3 stars is only because our server was really nice and we thought she did a great job"}
{"text":"Whoa. I stopped here on the way home from a client visit and was wary based on some of low star reviews. First things first, ignore those reviews because this place is incredible. INCREDIBLE! This, coming from someone who has a lot of seafood restaurant experience in San Francisco and this place is just miles above. 

Let's start with the service: attentive, thoughtful, and detailed from the hostess who accommodated my admittedly high maintenance request to Sit alone (lol) at the bar and the bartender who crafted beautiful house cocktails for me. 

I ordered the pei oysters to start , followed by the seafood platter and French fries with truffle oil aioli.i ended the night with a pannacotta and drip coffee. 

My favorite were the house sauces - jalepeno and habenero based for the oysters. The best was the quail egg on the oysters. Goodness. I may need to take up quail hens the eggs were so good. 

I will come here every time I visit Toronto. Beautiful experience for a lone business traveler but i can easily see how this is a great place for a date, special occasion or just to get together with good friends."}
{"text":"The 3/5 rating across the board for lbs. is very accurate. The service here is outstanding. All the servers are attentive and friendly. Unfortunately the food is mediocre. They recently changed up the menu so the lobster poutine is no longer on there. The halibut was on the dry side. I would have loved if the mains came with sides (ex: fries or salad) instead of being at an extra cost. 
Tip: go on a Thursday for the buck a shuck. The oysters were good.  Don't forget to check in for a free dessert!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple times for lunch, for both their regular and winterlicious menus. 

Signature Lobster roll: it wasn't bad, but I thought it was a bit oily and the lobster wasn't as good as the one I've tried at Front Street Foods during the summer. 

Tacos: this dish was a bit disappointing. The food was a bit cold, but I got this from their winterlicious menu (maybe for this reason). I didn't finish the food.. and will probably not order this dish again. 

Lobster Mac & Cheese: this was pretty filling as an appetizer! We enjoyed this dish more than the others."}
{"text":"First time here last night. I thought the decor and set up were beautiful. Also enjoyed the music. 

Their cocktail list is amazing with a ton of different options for around $12-$15 ish depending. They also have beer and wine for standard prices, $7-$10 ish. 

I had the burger for dinner and thought it was awesome. Medium rare cook was perfect and all of the dressings and condiments were great together.

Would definitely come back to try the lobster. All meals are priced at $22, which I thought was pretty fair"}
{"text":"I have been walking by this spot for a while now salivating at the mere sound of the name - after all, who doesn't love lobster, burgers and salad?! It's a cute place... modern decor (I love the mirrors!), it was clean and the service was fast and friendly. We got seated right away on a Saturday night and didn't have to wait long for the food. 

My friend got the fried chicken (long story) and I got the 1.25lb of Nova Scotia lobster. I kind of wish I had looked at the menu a little more but my heart was set on that before I even walked into the place. When I ordered, the server asked if I also wanted fries with it...I guess this is where I went wrong. She didn't explain that if I said no (which I did) the lobster would come with nothing but maybe a tablespoon of \"salad\". I also just assumed (lesson learned) that based on the pictures found here by other reviewers, that my lobster would come with an actual salad... or another side in replace of the fries...or I would have just gotten the fries. Basically, I kind of feel ripped off comparing my meal to the meals of others posted here. Next time, just say yes to the fries.

The food itself was pretty good. The lobster fell right out of its shell, the necessary butter was present and the tablespoon of \"salad\" was okay. My friend said his chicken was a little burnt but maybe that's what you get for ordering chicken in a lobster restaurant. He also hated his dark and stormy cocktail....which coming from a bartender myself, didn't quite look or taste like one. The server did say they have their own version of it when he ordered it but I guess she should have clarified that it wasnt really like the real one at all.

I would go back to lbs but I will definitely order more in order to avoid stopping at McDonalds on the way home...lol."}
{"text":"I came here on a Tuesday afternoon for lunch with a friend. The place was almost empty so we essentially had the restaurant to ourselves.
The restaurant decor is lovely and gives off a very nice vibe. 
The servers and staff were also very accommodating when it came to seating us and serving our food.
For the starter, I ordered the bitter greens salad with the smoked white fish.The fish was delicious but as for the bitter greens, it wasn't my favourite thing to eat. It was way too bitter for me and the portion was too big.
As for the main meal, I ordered the pasta with clams and tomato sauce. It was pretty good and there was a good amount of clams in the pasta. My only criticism is that it was very salty.
For dessert, I ordered the panna cotta which was perfect end to the meal. It wasn't too heavy and was the perfect bite to finish the 3 course meal!
One more thing: When we received our bill, we noticed that the waitress charged us $5.00 for still water ($2.50 for me and $2.50 for my friend). If you do not want to pay for water, I assume you have to specify that you want tap water."}
{"text":"I got delivery. 
Kale salad and lobster bisq. 

Soup had 3 pieces of lobster total 
I added lobster to my kale salad for 10$ and it came with a  laughable portion. It's soggy and the kale is poor quality no texture at all. 

So unimpressed for a $45.00 lunch"}
{"text":"$25 (incl tax) Price fix menu with your choice of 1.25lb lobster, lobster roll, lobster poutine, brisket burger or dinner sized lobster salad. The meal come with fries and a salad.
I ordered the lobster roll meal to go. It took some time to get the meal and I only noticed later that they had forgot to pack the salad.
The lobster itself was juicy and nice. The roll on the other hand was greasy as if it were deep fried. The overall size of the roll was small. The fries were burnt soggy and salty as hell.
I was not given a physical menu, only a verbal menu which i felt was really bad as it is really hard to make a decision and to recall details.
Overall, I do not think $25 for a small roll and small soggy fries is worth coming back."}
{"text":"To begin, the service is a 10/10 (!!) and this doesnt happen often at all. The staff here are helpful and friendly. Our server made sure we never had to put our hands on the wine bottle to fill our glasses. NOT EVEN ONCE.  My glass of water was always full and it's not because I didnt drink any. The bartender recommended a wine that was PERFECT for both steak and seafood, which was what we ordered. We stayed almost two hours after closing and the staff still did not rush us. The server didnt even want to tell us what time they actually closed and just that \"we close whenever you are done\". This alone was really impressive. 

My favourite was the lbs platter - clams, oysters, scallop ceviche, lobster tail, and trout tartare with spicy chips. The seafood was extremely fresh. We also ordered 1.5 lb lobster and the NY striploin with fries. Everything was delicious. I was celebrating my birthday with my best friend and we got TWO desserts on the house. It was extremely sweet of them. The dessert was amazing. I usually dont have room for dessert but i finished mine! I cant remember what it was called but it was like a churro ice cream sandwich - the ice cream was vanilla and burnt marshmallow. My vanilla one was so refreshing.

Food (Taste): 4/5
Food (Presentation): 4/5
Service: 5/5
Ambiance: 5/5"}
{"text":"Came here for my friend's birthday celebration during lunch. The atmosphere is great here, nicely decorated with great lighting and seating.  Since this restaurant is known for their seafood, my friend and I order the regular lobster roll, the jumbo lobster roll and a lobster poutine (yes we had a lobster feast!).

Food took awhile to come but once arrived, they are displayed nicely. The smaller lobster roll also comes with side salad and fries. Lobster meat portion seems decent but I though the fries were a little over-fried.

My jumbo lobster was huge, although the bun it used is the exact same size as the regular one, but the jumbo has lobster meat overflow! But they used a little too much butter as eating it got a little messy.

Lobster poutine was interesting.  It was good portion but for some reason, the gravy was a little sour.  It didn't tasted bad, but it was very interesting as I never had sour gravy before (I hope it's not because it turned bad, but I didn't get a stomach ache from it).

Price is on the higher end considering we were eating lobster rolls only.  Overall, the food was okay, atmosphere was great but price is a little high. 3/5."}
{"text":"Chose this place for Valentines. At the time of booking (one week ago), I do notice they have a 'Valentines' menu that is $95/$140 pp. to be honest I was going to get that anyways. One day before my reservation I got a call and they told me now I am ONLY restricted to ordering from the Valentines menu. Like I previously mentioned, I was going to any way but I can see how that will be a turn off for some people who would prefer to order a la carte.

As for the actual meal, there wasn't much of a meal. I arrived 10mins prior to my reservation so I was offered to be seated at the bar. After two drinks and 40mins, I grew impatient and had to remind the staff that I am still waiting to be seated. First reminder they told me I will be seated soon. After another 15mins I felt a bit fed up and asked for an update. This time the hostess told me they thought I wanted to be seated at the bar.

Finally I got seated and this is where I felt even more frustrated. Food was coming out incredibly slow. Now I have service industry experience but the wait time was unbearable (keep in mind it is now almost 10pm. I am ONLY having my appetizer.

By the time my entree was served it was 10:15pm and I lost all appetite to eat so I asked for the entree to be packed and left.

I don't think I'll ever visit this restaurant again because of this experience. If it is expected to be a busy night, they should do a better job in preparation."}
{"text":"dropped in for lunch with some co-workers and had the Seafood Po-boy, which I enjoyed. It came with a side of lobster flavoured chips, which didn't taste particularly like lobster, but that's fine since I'm allergic to lobster anyways. the overall decor was nice, and the service was very good. The general knock on lbs is the price point, which admittedly is a bit high for what you get."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to come here for a long time and wanting to try a lobster roll for even longer!  

As you can probably predict, I got the lobster roll which came with a side house salad AND a side of fries.  The portions were a nice size, even for lunch.  I enjoyed the house salad which used boston lettuce and radishes.  It was a nice change from the typical spring mix you get at most restaurants.  The fries were tasty, but were much better with the truffle aioli (which you had to pay an extra $3 for, but so worth it!).  The lobster roll itself was good, but it didn't wow me.  I think the bun would have been better if it was garlic bread (though maybe not if you're going back to work afterwards!).  The lobster salad inside the roll was tasty and warm, but it just didn't pack the punch I was hoping for.  

I had a bite of my friend's lobster mac and cheese.  It was so good!  It may be too \"fishy\" for some, but I thought it tasted great.  I like that it comes in a small portion in case you wanted to pair it with something else.  

I got a huge scoop of ice cream as a check in treat.  They had a number of flavours but I ordered the almond coffee which reminded me of my favourite ice cream \"Mocha Almond Fudge\"  It was delicious and a great dessert to share with someone if you just want a bit of sweet.  

The service was nice.  The hostess even remember two people from my group from the week before.  They also have a convenient coat check service.  The decor had a beautiful, summery and clean looking feel."}
{"text":"Use the free ice cream yelp coupon!

Yelp seems so divided on LBS. For what it's worth I will throw in my two cents based on dinner here. 

Service was excellent, friendly staff and quite attentive. The ambience of the place is great, classy and fits in well with the area.

In terms of price I've seriously spent close to this $amount at dinner at Red Lobster so not sure what's with the complaints about it being too expensive. I mean if you think you can find a place to eat lobster on the cheap show me the place i'll go there every single day.

On to the food:

Oysters: they had a good selection, we tried the west coast oysters and they had a nice clean taste. I enjoyed the dropper bottles that allowed for precise control when adding the various sauces to the oysters.

Jumbo classic lobster roll: this is the hot lobster roll, super buttery and the 6 oz of lobster goes a long way. There was actually alot of meat, flavour wise around as good as an average place in Boston. It's not Neptunes boston (which gives a godly amount of lobster meat and fries) but for TO it's pretty good. Only issue is it doesn't come with fries or like any sides for $31.

Ice cream sando: this had a very good taste and super sweet. They used a different donut than some of the other pics I've seen.

They also have a good selecion of beer, and from what I saw the wine as well.

Overall, I'm going to say try it, the reviews on yelp almost made me not want to go here but I feel it was much better than the current scores indicate."}
{"text":"Came here for winterlicious 2018 and we all left hungry! The caesar salad was good but nothing special it had kale, bacon and lots of cheese. The panacotta was amazing that is highly recommended! My one complaint is that the entrees were not complete meals. My friends had the lobster and it was just lobster and rapini. My steak was just steak, sauce, and mash. The lobster was missing a carb and the steak was missing a veggie. When I go to a restaurant for a three course meal I expect it to be enough to fill my tummy but we all left hungry. Overall it was a well cooked meal but it didnt feel complete and not worth the price."}
{"text":"Long story short, if you're coming here, get the lobster poutine! We came here for dinner around 7 PM on a Wednesday with a reservation for a table of four. The restaurant wasn't super busy, and we were seated promptly. Service was great! Our waitress was super attentive to our needs and was great about explaining their menu. My friend ordered a cocktail and it wasn't to her taste, so they waived it from our bill.

I ordered the Lobster poutine, while my friends ordered the lobster roll (x2) and the lobster. The special butter sauces are an extra $4, so we decided not to get it. My lobster poutine was a relative highlight - for $20, a good amount of lobster, cheese curds (that weren't squeaky, but oh well), and a mountain of fries drenched in lobster-flavoured gravy. My friends, on the other hand, were a bit disappointed by the relatively diminutive size of the lobster roll, and the fries were, as others have noted, overly salty. My friend who ordered the lobster itself said it was decent, but there was a part of the lobster that may have been undercooked.

I think this place would be better if they made refined their menu so that patrons feel like their $22 are well spent on any item on the prix-fixed menu. I've noticed this theme in restaurants that have been opening around the city this year. I felt like my $20 was well spent on my Lobster poutine, but at the same time, it's not something that I would go back for regularly. 

I guess the one upside is that the walk up/down Yonge has a lot of Pokestops :P"}
{"text":"Gorgeous interior, fabulous service. Loved the whole aura of lbs. However, our Summerlicious dinner wasn't as delicious as I expected it to be.

We knew we wanted to order from their fixed price menu, but there was also a Tuesday special, where you can get three types of shrimp and a glass of house white for $22. The sauce (some sort of horseradish mayo) was delicious, and complimented this appetizer perfectly. Forgot to take a photo of this sampler, but definitely the best part of the meal.

From the Summerlicious menu, I ordered:

I. Musk melon gazpacho with bacon and basil
 
This was a lot thicker than other gazpachos I've had. It was almost like a vegetable smoothie, and I was under the impression that the broth should be quite viscous. In addition, I'm not sure the flavours complimented each other that well.

II. Rainbow trout with toasted faro and sweet peas, mint and parsley broth 

Loved the trout - there was a nice crispy layer on the bottom, and it was cooked well throughout. The toppings seemed strange at first, but I ended up liking the amalgamation of all the other ingredients.

III. Ice cream float
A refreshing end to the meal, though I think the caramel cruller would have been a better choice.

I know lbs. is more known for lobster and other seafood, so I hope those dishes are better than what was offered on the Summerlicious menu."}
{"text":"Had the winterlicious dinner, got attracted bc they hv the whole steam lobster for main entree.  I ordered the salad for starter and penna cotta for dessert.  My bf ordered the seafood crowder to start, steak for main, and ice cream sandwich for dessert.  To be honest, the food lacks flavour.  It is ok only!  Well maybe bc it is winterlicious as most places lower their quality to match the prices."}
{"text":"Was just okay. We got the lobster roll and the truffled lobster mac and cheese.

Lobster roll was decent, but nothing to rave about. the fries it came with were tiny and soggy and the salad's dressing wasn't great. 

Truffled lobster mac and cheese was disappointing. Not as saucy and cheesy as you'd like. 

The service was slow, but nice decor. 

Would not recommend"}
{"text":"I'm a little surprised by the low rating for lbs. here, since I thought the food was (mostly) very good. But I will admit the pricing is a little on the high side, so perhaps that's the issue people are having. (I doubt I would ever return due entirely to those high prices.)

Anyway, I decided to order the Lobster Roll (\"butter bun + lemon + old bay + mayo + fries + house salad\"). At first glance, the lobster roll itself is very, very small. It's not even the length of a 6\" sub, but, as I soon discovered, it's bursting with large pieces of lobster. The lobster is basically allowed to speak for itself, as the old bay seasoning is sparsely applied. It's delicious, undoubtedly. The butter bun is a perfect vehicle and I enjoyed the heck out of this thing.

The fries are quite good, too. Crunchy without being crispy, they arrived to the table piping hot and heavily salted. The salad was the weakest link here, to be sure. It's got these huge, leafy greens that are awfully difficult to comfortably eat, while the dressing is so simple and so subtle that it's almost non-existent.

So yeah, I enjoyed my meal quite a bit. But at $23 for a lunch portion, the pricing is just too prohibitively expensive to really justify a hearty recommendation."}
{"text":"The food was okay here and the ambiance was good but the service was terrible. We went on a Thursday for the buck a shuck and ordered 2 dozen oysters. After ordering the oysters and a bottle of prosecco, the server immediately takes away our menus and automatically assumes we were not going to order anything else. One of us later ordered a lobster bisque and the server asks us if we knew that lobster bisque is a soup and can't be shared among three people although we had no intention of sharing the lobster bisque. Overall for the level of service we got and the fact the food wasn't extraordinary, I won't go back here."}
{"text":"It's probably unfair to review a restaurant at Winterlicious however there was nothing about my experience that would make me return. My clam chowder was without any apparent flavour. The toast with it was cold stale and burnt. The crab cakes were bland and devoid of crab flavours. The lobster was served without the tomalley- which the waitress checked and the kitchen say they remove as some people don't like it. If you want it you have to ask! The linguine Vongole was only passable but with a heavy hand on the salt. The pasta was al dente ybut not much of it. And only a few clams. The noise level - particularly heavy bass thumps made talking tiring and difficult. My iPhone dB meter showed a peak of 92 dB and an average of just over 80db. Hearing is impaired at exposure to 90db for 8 hours. They did have a nice South African Shiraz but I had the very last glass it seems. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I had a pleasant experience at lbs.  Had reservation on a Friday night for seven people.  I ordered the 1.25lb Nova Scotia lobster which came with fries and Ce salad.  The lobster was already cracked so it was easy to eat.  It also came with butter for the lobster.  Fries tasted a tad sour like there's vinegar in it but I enjoyed it.  Ceasar salad was your typical ceasar salad.  Total of my food was $22 tax exclusive.  

I also checked in on Yelp and got a free coffee-almond ice cream.  Yum!  Delicious dessert to end my meal.  Will def consider coming back."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a Friday night at 9:00 by myself. It wasn't busy at all in the restaurant, but the service was TERRIBLE.
- I walked up the hostess stand, she asked \"do you need something?\" Yeah, a table, otherwise I wouldn't be here.
- I was seated pretty quickly, but no one came to acknowledge me, or offer me any water, until 15 minutes after I was seated. I already decided what I wanted, so I was just on my phone for 15 minutes. You'd think they'd notice that.
- Finally when the server came, she took my order, but forgot my water. It took her another 15 minutes to bring water.
- Food came pretty quickly, and it was quite standard. The lobster was steamed and tasted fresh. The salad was pretty basic, and the fries tasted like McD fries. I learned from others to order fries unsalted, so it wasn't salted, but it was kind of soggy. For $22 for a whole lobster, I'm okay with not-so-great fries.
- Our server only had 3 or 4 tables, so she would spend most of her time at the server station folding the napkins, but I noticed she checked on one table more than the others, and it was the table coincidentally that sat two Caucasians. I'm Chinese, and the other table she was taking care of was seated full of Chinese people too, so I'm not sure what this was about.
- The restaurant was pretty empty, as in it was only about 30-40% full. I noticed that myself and the other table next to me were the only Chinese table in the restaurant, and we were seated next to each other, in the very back of the restaurant next to the kitchen. I don't know if this was deliberate, or maybe I'm thinking too much into it. Regardless, made me a bit uncomfortable, especially when attached to the bad service.
- After I finished my food, I waited another 10 minutes for the bill. Again, server was folding napkins, and she would look over at the table with the Caucasian couple every few minutes, but she never looked at me. I was looking at her the whole time because I wanted to catch her attention, but she never looked my way.

Overall, decent food, bad service, and probably won't return."}
{"text":"The preceding Yelp reviews were not very kind to lbs, therefore I went in with low expectations when I was invited to join for a dinner outing at this venue. However; a lot of the reviews were on their winterlicious offering. I'm not a big fan of winterlicious (no matter the restaurant), so I took it all with a grain of salt. 

I have to say; I was pleasantly surprised!  I sampled the following items:

ceviche - yellow fin tuna + avocado + mustard seed
brussels sprouts - maple syrup sriracha + bacon lardon
nova scotia lobster - 1 lb, drawn butter
bisque - lobster + toasted sourdough
lobster roll - cold with kewpie mayo or hot with drawn butter + Fries

It was ALL delicious, especially the sprouts and the bisque (1 order is enough to split between two people). Although I would not recommend the Lobster Roll. Order the one pound Lobster instead and eat it proper!

Lastly - I can say enough about the service, it was impeccable..."}
{"text":"I checked out Lbs. Restaurant on their grand opening day. The restaurant decor is very sleek and classy looking. The staff were all very gracious and friendly. Their menu revolves mainly around seafood and it was pretty good. We tried the lobster salad, the lobster roll, fresh 1 and a 1/4 pound lobster and the burger. Everything was very tasty. My favourite was of course the lobster the the lobster roll. The lobster is at a fix price of $22, which is pretty good. I found that their burger was a bit more regular. They have an amazing donut ice cream. It kind of reminded me of Tiny Tom donuts but a bit bigger in size. As for the drinks, we sampled a few cocktails but the alcohol flavour was a bit too strong for my taste. Overall though, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Winterlicious Review*** 

While lbs is in a great location with a cool vibe and great service, we weren't impressed with the food. Upon arrival we were disappointed to find that on arrival they aren't offering any of there regular specials with the Winterlicious menu. We had specifically gone on a Thursday to take advantage of the buck-a-shuck, but were told this wasn't offered at the same time. If this had been advertised somewhere we wouldn't have been disappointed, however this information was nowhere to be found. 

I agree with previous reviewers that for the price, the Winterlicious menu isn't much food. My girlfriend and I ordered the chowder, crab cakes, lobster, clam spaghetti and ice cream sandwiches between us. The clam chowder was the highlight of the night. The crab cakes were well seasoned, but lacked any real texture. The lobster was a decent portion, however the rapini on the side was laughable. My clam spaghetti had a good number of clams, but was so salty it was almost inedible. Finally, the ice cream sandwiches were tasty, but tiny. 

While I can see why this is a hit with the financial crowd, it's hard to justify the prices at this place. With some of the most ridiculous wine mark-ups I've seen ($64 for a $21 bottle of riesling), I would spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Got to try this place last night as take out and thought it was very mediocre at best. All items on the menu apparently come with fries and a salad for a fixed price of $22+tax. We really just wanted to try the lobster roll, but couldn't just order that.

So we got our take out bag, paid, and went to another place to eat. There were two containers in our bag, one for fries and the other for the lobster roll. Where was our salad??? We didn't realize this until we had already paid and left...

The lobster roll was okay, the meat was very fresh tasting, I'll give them that. But man, the bread it was sandwiched in was so greasy, honestly felt like they drenched it in butter and toasted it very slowly on the pan. The portion of the lobster roll? About the size of a hot dog, which was not very filling. And the fries were garbage (soggy, salty, and burnt). This place will leave a person hungry and disappointed."}
{"text":"I don't understand why people are so critical of this resto. It's a beautiful resto with a simple concept - quality good at a reasonable price. The menu is not complicated, total of 4 items and everything is $22. Can't get any more complicated than that. Despite wanting to order everything on the menu, I settled on the 1.25 lb lobster since it's only lunch and I don't want to fall asleep at my desk after. My lobster was fresh and had abundance of meat so I'm a happy camper. I like crispy fries which mine weren't but hey, to each it's own. Plus at $22 for lobster and 2 sides, I'm not complaining.  The service was also good so I would definitely go back and try the lobster roll and pouting next time around."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant in a convenient location right by Yonge & Adelaide. Food and drink is a bit on the pricier side but I guess you pay for location. I wanted to try the lobster but didn't feel like it was worth it at $27 so settled on sharing a lobster poutine and a burger. The poutine was... poutine. With a few small pieces of lobster. The burger was actually pretty good but extremely messy and a bit greasy. Tasty nonetheless and enjoyed the fries too. Overall, a decent option for after work drinks in the downtown core but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit (or return)."}
{"text":"The only reason this place is not one star is because it is nice inside. I came here for winterlicious but the problems likely extend to the regular menu.

I put this before the food review because it's scammy, underhanded BS. You get asked if you want still or sparkling water and \"still\" water means filtered, refilled bottles which cost $2.50 per person. You are not made aware of this. IDGAF about the $2.50, but the way it's charged is bull and fully intentional. 

The crab cakes have too much spices in them and you can't taste any crab. They are slathered in sauce which makes this worse. The spaghetti with clams was way too mushy and overcooked. The tomato sauce tasted like it came out of a can. The clams were good but again overcooked. I also ate most of the teriyaki steak which was way too salty. It cames with two tablespoons of mashed potatoes and no veggies. I tried all thee deserts because nobody else wanted to eat them.  The ice cream sandwich was a bit of ice cream in the middle of a soggy undercooked doughnut shaped like a churro. The panna cotta lacked any sugar, although the strawberry sauce on top was good. The sherbet was the best and was the highlight of my meal; it was not too sour and has just enough citrus taste. The berries it came with were good. 

Overall, mediocre in terms of food and service. For $70, you can much, much better. Do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"The decor of this place was absolutely stunning.  Came here today for lunch with my co-worker.  There's a take-out section which I've been to before but first time in the restaurant.

The menu is very limited at lunch.  It would be great if they had some lunch special.  We got the Jumbo Lobster roll for $35 and the seafood Po'boy sandwich for $20 and a side of fries with truffle aioli  for $7 to share.  Although the lobster roll was a little pricey, it was filled with 6 ounces of lobster that was really tasty.  It would have been nice if they just at least included some fries on a side.  They do have a smaller lobster roll filled with 3 ounces of lobster that comes with fries and salad for $25.  As for the seafood po'boy, it was filled with deep fried seafood but it was a bit dry and I couldn't really taste what kind of seafood was in it.  Maybe fish and/or oyster - not sure?

I'll definitely be back if I'm craving for lobster but may just get it from their take-out section."}
{"text":"I loved the food, the service was good but not amazing.  Our server seemed annoyed that we asked her for anything.  Our dinner took about 3 hrs for about 12 of us."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Great wine. A bit pricey for the quality of food you get.  I got the lobsters salad and I was still hungry after I was done my meal. Location is close to work and less then a min walk from king station."}
{"text":"Pretty cute decor but the food sadly isn't that great. Came by on a weekday lunch - interiors were bright, modern and comfy, and the coat check was a nice touch in the winter. Service was friendly and efficient but the food just didn't deliver. I got the Lobster Roll ($23) and though it was decent tasting there wasn't much filling inside. The side salad and fries were a bit over dressed. My friend was also disappointed with his 1.25lb Lobster ($27) - overcooked and didn't have the \"sweetness\" of a fresh lobster. 

The price would be alright if the dishes were good quality or a good portion but unfortunately they were neither. I think the concept of the menu works well for the finance district but the execution needs a bit more work to gain repeat customers."}
{"text":"This place is great, but just your average seafood/lobster joint with really pretty decor. Great for work lunches or meet up with friends. Recommend for lunch."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch.  I ordered the lobster roll, my friend got the lobster salad and we had the lobster poutine.  

The lobster poutine was okay. There were nice hunts of lobster in it but I think they were a bit overcooked.  My lobster roll came with a small salad and fries.  For $22, it was a bit overpriced for lunch.  My friend's lobster salad, however, looked amazing but again, $28 for lunch is a bit pricy.  

I debated giving lbs 4 stars because the lobster roll WAS good, but the price and the poutine made me less likely to make lbs a *usual* lunch spot."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and shared the lobster roll (regular sized) and the lobster pasta (that I can't pronounce or recall the exact name of) with the coworker I came with. Both were amazing. The roll was buttery and had a good amount of lobster in it. It came with a side of fries and a (super simple) small salad. I thought the fries were a little too salty or had too much vinegar.. so if you're debating between the larger lobster roll (which doesn't come with fries or salad) and the regular, I'd say go with the large because the sides aren't worth having. The pasta was amazing- from the chewy noodles to the sauce and lobster. No complaints.

We also ordered dessert and got the ice cream donut sandwich and the chocolate cake. The donut was nice and warm, which made the ice cream pairing extremely good. Not gonna lie, could've been a bit more generous with the ice cream as portion didn't edge out all the way to the side as you'd expect it to. The chocolate cake was not too sweet, which was great!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't bad... but the service definitely broke my friends and my experience at this restaurant.

We booked a table on OpenTable for 8:30pm on a Saturday night 2 weeks prior. When we went to the maitre d he said our table wasn't ready and walked us to the bar as only 2 of 3 of us were in. As he walked us to the bar, we saw 2 empty tables - one with 3 place settings. I was pretty sure that was our table but since we were waiting for our friend I didn't mention anything to him. The restaurant wasn't very busy but it wasn't empty either.

The bartender was quite friendly and recommended us drinks. My friend got the slushy and I got the hollywood. I quite liked mine but she said hers was too bitter (but to the bartender's defence he did warn her). Our last member of the group came at 8:45pm and joined us at the bar. Since it's been 15 min past our reservation time and our entire party was present I asked the bartender if the table was ready. He said it wasn't so we continued to wait.

At 9:16pm we were seated at our table - which was the empty table of 3 I saw upon entering. At this point was a little disappointed that we made reservations in advanced and yet had to wait 46 min to be seated at an empty table. We all ordered at 9:20pm as we were hungry! We all ordered the 1.25lbs Nova Scotia Lobster with a side of truffle aioli and 2 of us upgraded our butter to the lobster butter (don't do it - the butter isn't worth the extra $4). 

Since it's lobster we expected the food to come pretty quickly. We were wrong. We were served at 9:50pm after asking for our food. The waitress never came by to check on us while the food was being prepared. I feel like the waitress not noticing her table's food hasn't arrived in a timely manner is inattention on her part. My friend's lobster came and was raw! When we finally got the attention of the waitress she commented on how they cook the tails and the claws separately and that the tails were meant to be undercooked... We proceeded to compare our tails with my friend's tail. Ours was white and hers was clear. Was this normal? The waitress replied yes and proceeded to convince my friend to eat it as is. My friend was really uncomfortable with the undercooked lobster and requested it to be sent back. When she finally got her lobster back it was around 10:20pm. We finished dinner at around 11pm and waited 30 min before the bill was brought to us upon our request again.

Despite the wait, the food wasn't too bad. The lobster came all pre-cracked so it eliminated the need for crackers which was nice. The fries were a little soggier than I would have liked (love crunchy frites) and the salad was quite peppery. The truffle aioli was worth it for the fries (order 1 per table and share). I did like the lobster butter but I wouldn't say its worth the extra $4. I would also recommend just getting one for the table and sharing it. My friend preferred the regular butter. 1.25 lbs lobster wasn't big enough for each of us though and we left pretty hungry still. It's quite small as I think the head and the shell components were included in the 1.25 lbs weight.

I won't return to this restaurant unless a friend had a birthday party here or if the restaurant manages to survive a year or two (which is my general indication that their time management and service improved). It's a shame because $22 for a lobster dish is not a bad price at all.

If the restaurant does read this and they would like proof of times I listed above, I am more than happy to send print screens of the timestamp on the photos I took."}
{"text":"Awesome lobster!!! The roll was excellent. The lobster chips weren't really lobstery, but I don't know what I was expecting with those."}
{"text":"Extremely overpriced. Ordered their lobster roll (listed on their entree list) and honestly my friend and I did a double take when it arrived.   (She even offered me some of her own dinner when she saw mine lol) Not only it was the sole thing on my plate, it was tiny and taste wise nothing special. Quite dry actually. Nice looking spot for an expensive drink but that's all i would recommend."}
{"text":"Oysters were good. Lobster was okay. Service was terrible!
There were 4 different people serving my table, we were also told by a confused waitress that there is a promotion for 2 lb lobster which is $30 and when we got the bill they charged us for two lobsters so $60. My friend was also receiving dirty looks by a weirdly dressed (manager or who knows what she does) for no reason which is highly unprofessional and childish. The main manager was also rude and did not talk to us seriously. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"**Winterlicious review**

TBH I picked this restaurant because it had a dairy free dessert option and most winterlicious menus did not (I'm lactose intolerant). 

I ordered the bitter greens salad, lobster roll, and berries & sorbet. The bitter greens salad was interesting with candied orange zest but not one of the better tasting salads I've had. It was a lot of salad though, I ended up taking more than half home for leftovers! 

They were accommodating with my lactose intolerance, which I didn't expect with a fixed winterlicious menu! They offered the lobster roll on lettuce instead of the regular bun that contained dairy. The portion of lobster was pretty small though. 

The service speed wasn't the best, as we came during a weekday lunch and I was hoping the lunch would only be an hour, but we ended up waiting a while for the bills."}
{"text":"Known for their lobster, so I had to try their famous lobster poutine and lobster. The poutines gravy was definitely different from you're regular gravy. It's not as rich and complimented the lobster quite well. The lobster itself was average"}
{"text":"Truth be told, this place has great ambiance but just not worth the price.  We started with shrimp cocktails (4 shrimp = $20).  It was good but nothing to dance about.  My friend and I had the lobster salad.  Lettuce, a few veggies and some lobster meat plunked on top.  Way too much Green Goddess dressing though.  It was relatively filling but honestly not worth the $30 price tag.  The guys had black cod & Arctic char.  The cod was \"swimming\" in cilantro broth making it somewhat not pleasant to eat.  The Arctic char was the tastier of the two fish.

Dessert was cake and two types of ice cream.  The Chocolate bumble cake was sort of like bread pudding but really needed some ice cream to accompany it - not whipped cream.  Chocolate toffee ice cream was yummy

The atmosphere was very cool, nice music but not the most informed staff.  Yes, they were very pleasant but when you are spending almost $100 for dinner, you'd expect a different calibre of service."}
