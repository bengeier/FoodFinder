{"text":"Update: based on our previous experience here we decided to come back here with more friends and family and introduce them to good food. we were right, the food was amazing again, and i was able to find the channa masala i had been craving for weeks. this place is a must try for a food lover....truly impressive and i cant wait to back here again."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed. Shahi Tandoor food is identical to its original restaurant Tandoori Style - I think the chef spent many years working there. The recipes are exactly the same. I disagree with Roger C., the only thing different about Shahi Tandooi is that the customer service is terrible. The hostess/owner is very rude and arrogant. I would not go back to this place. Although the food taste good, its equally as good if not better at Tandoori Style."}
{"text":"I am really happy that we found this place. It is right around the corner of our office and we drop by for lunch at least once per week. The food is very reasonably priced and delicious. I personally would recommend the chicken karahi, the tikka masala and of course the butter chicken. My friends from India said that this was authentic food from the area. Any friends I have brought here agree that the food is delicious. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I would definitely recommend dropping by for a visit."}
{"text":"I am very picky about food AND service. This is one place I go back to over and over again. A friend had invited us to dinner here and we were veryyy pleased with how the evening went.  The owner is a VERY sweet lady, and very accommodating. we have since been back with other friends and family, all have loved it! We will now be catering from them for an upcoming event.  You will NOT be disappointed!"}
