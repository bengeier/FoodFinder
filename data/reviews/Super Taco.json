{"text":"One of the best taco places in town. The place for taco lovers. Delicious, clean and very friendly.Yum!"}
{"text":"Food is OK.  They lure customers in with promises of deals and coupons and then refuse to honor them. Then they give you a guilt trip for paying with a credit card.  Also they are always out of forks."}
{"text":"I've been living 7 years and this the best place by far for Tacos in Montreal. I recommend the Pastor (Marinated pork) or the Tongue tacos with some Chipotle salsa."}
{"text":"Authentic mexican tacos, you can`t get enough. Good job guys !"}
{"text":"The store is clean and big enough to dine in. Foods are cheap. I think anybody can be full for no more than $10. I don't eat Mexican food very much so can't judge the flavor. I like it anyway."}
{"text":"This place is dirty and food was not good at all. Don't bother going you will be sorry. Sat outside had window washer washing over our head while we were waiting for our food . Owner or employee fixing door,  it was around 7pm on a Thursday night.  Really, really, really unbelievable no sense of business filthy unorganized mess."}
{"text":"I always order vegetarian sopes, and I love them. My favorite ones in town. I also really like their salsa."}
{"text":"Tried coming here at least 5x and always closed. Musta been Monday's. Pastor tacos are delicious!!! They come with roasted pineapples like they do in Mexico. You feel transported to east LA or the mission. You can't beat 4 tacos for $6. Now these are how tacos need to be. They got it down but they need to get beers in there!"}
{"text":"This Food is terrible. We won't be coming back.:(  Update: I ended up getting violently ill that night after eating at this place.   I had the chicken fajita quesadilla, and their cheese is not cheese. It is a white slimy sticky substance used to glue everything together. I literally ate about 5 bites of it, and threw the rest out. My daughter, who eats anything, got the super nachos and threw those out too.   These people need to do a complete menu overhaul."}
{"text":"Tacos are very small here, it tastes good but not filling. I would say this place is good for a quick snack. The place is small too, staffs are nice but nothing more."}
{"text":"In the past year I've eaten here twice. The first time I went I expected to pay one dollar per taco. However you have to buy a three dollar soda.  Maybe I'm slow learning. However I came back after a year because they still have a sign outside that says $1.20 per taco. I forgot to buy a drink again. Six tocos cost me $12 Without a drink. Two nights ago I was at dos reales and had a full plate of food and one HUGE  Amber beer with lime and a bowl of cheese dip for $16.  And free chips.  Sorry but I know why all the tables are empty at Super Tiny Taco.."}
{"text":"Promotion on Wednesday is ok. I only tried Pastor tacos and they were good. The place did not look very clean and I am very peaky about it."}
{"text":"Petit resto de quartier sympathique. Les tacos sont simples mais économiques 4/6$. Ils vendent également quelques sortes de bonbons. Le service est chaleureux."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican tacos at very reasonable prices from courteous, amiable staff. No $10 for 2 hipster tacos here - 4 for $6 with music, telenovelas and futbol. We will certainly return!"}
{"text":"Ordered Chimichangas, Nachos, and some Guacamole on the side. It's the best Mexican food I've had in a long while. I recommend this to anyone in the area looking for fresh ingredients, fresh corn tortilla chips, and perfectly prepared meals.  Definitely going once more within the next month."}
{"text":"The only good taco I ate there is the chorizo, the gorditas were really greasy and with almost non meat, the carnitas are stupidly bad I´ve in Mexico and those are not carnitas, the restaurant is tacky  and it seems unsanitary. I went to the bathroom and its HORRIBLE!!!! also you thinks you are getting a good deal but the tacos are sooooooo tiny that you end up eating 10 so isnt as cheap as you think it is. They dont have beer, who doesnt  love a beer with tacos???? there are way better taco places in Montreal."}
{"text":"The food is good but the people working there are awful! I stopped going there about 6 months ago and decided to give it another try and I will not be back. I asked for a side of chips and salsa and they told me they didn't have time, and got my whole meal wrong. They also charged me $20 and I wouldn't know what they charged me for because they didn't give me a receipt. You call and ask to speak to a manager and they put you on hold then hang up. If I could give zero stars I would."}
{"text":"Siri can you let the yelp know that the chicken is cubed now and not shredded so I don't think it's a good place to go to have tacos cause is that shredded chicken anymore it's cute so that's a bad thing thank you"}
{"text":"Like most, I visited Super Taco (FKA Impactaco) for $1 tacos on Wednesdays (regular price is $5 for 4). Was not disappointed! They've since changed owners but quality has not suffered. With the increased popularity of taco joints around the city where else can you get tacos at this price? PS the other items are yummy too."}
{"text":"Although a little expensive, these are the best tacos in town!!  My friend took me there and the tacos, although small, have amazing flavor.  I loved them so much, we went back the next day for more.  Alas, I could not convince my friend and his family to go back for lunch a third day in a row.  Their corn tortillas rock, don't bother with the flower ones.  You need about six to fill u but it is awesome!!  Very fresh and their guacamole is very good as well.  I have only had the steak but my friends swear by the chicken and Mexican sausage."}
{"text":"Great place and definitely worth the money. They have extremely reasonable prices on authentic tacos with corn tortillas and lots of cilantro! Love it. And they're open till 11pm. What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"My favorite place for authentic cheap tacos. Al Pastor is the best and they have a small terrasse in the summer. Service is super fast and food great, fresh."}
{"text":"Cheap way to fill your belly. Quick service. No tips to a server. Free drink refills.   Clean.   Friendly employees."}
{"text":"Took my daughter and her friend here Saturday. We ordered tacos. When I picked the order up I asked for mild taco sauce and was handed a bottle. I gave it to the girls and they put it on their tacos. They took one bite and my daughter threw the taco down and started spitting it out and crying about how hot it was. Her friend, who can eat hot sauce with the best of them, said it was hot too. She took another bite and her eyes started to water. She then threw her taco down too and said she couldn't eat it either. I on the other hand did not put taco sauce on my taco. I took one bite and grease oozed out of it! That was enough for me to throw down my taco too. Needless to say all of the tacos were thrown away and we left never to return again.  I did try the taco sauce the girls were handed and it was extremely hot. I don't know if it was given to us as some kind of mean joke or if it was a mistake. But either way it was a very bad experience for all of us."}
{"text":"We love this place. We come here often and we have not had any of the problems described in the poor reviews. Food is great, price is good and they are always friendly. Salsa has always been on point too. The chorizo and pastor may talk back a bit but...hello it's generally a greasier meal so it's to be expected. We loved the fajitas (bisteak and pollo), and it's food for days! The young one gets the hamburger....I know, I know BUT she always takes home a patty for the dog (it comes with 2) and she loves it. I think this place is great and we will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"I stopped in for a late lunch after shopping on the Plaza St-Hubert. I was welcomed warmly and invited to sit out on the patio, which was surprisingly cool on this hot, humid day.  Four tacos for $6 plus a Mexican grapefruit soda = one perfect summer lunch. My food came really quickly and was served with a mouth-on-fire (SO GOOD) salsa verde.  It's not the most elegant of places but the food was delicious, the service was quick and friendly, and I got to read the paper en español.  I've got to go back and try the tongue next time."}
{"text":"Ordered tacos today, meal came out, I took a bite, almost spit it out, something was so off with the meat. Looked a bit closer, meat was a funny grayish-green color. Cheap food, just praying I don't get food poisoning from it. Ended up throwing it away, and going somewhere else."}
{"text":"Stumbled up on this place looking for a bite to eat in the area and they had everything I needed. Cheap flavourful tacos and friendly service. I had no idea they were closing and when I offered to leave they offered a menu item instead. The tacos came quickly accompanied by their delicious salsas at varying levels of hotness.   Came back a year later with the BF and was impressed!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the staff seems to speak English, French and Spanish.  It was my first time here today thanks to yelp!  Its about a 15 minute drive from my house downtown but I will definitely be driving back!    I honestly haven't had good tacos in almost a year.  Last place I really enjoyed was La Taqueria in Vancouver but now I finally have an east coast taco joint worthy of praise!  The food is amazing, and if you like authentic tacos you MUST try this place!  I would give it 4 stars for the food but their prices are just too great so I had to bump it up to the coveted five stars!  Go try it now! You will be back again and again and again guaranteed!"}
{"text":"Good cheap food. Fast for being a Sunday night with seemingly only one guy working. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food! My wife and I were really spoiled by all the good Mexican food while we lived in Texas and we were pretty disappointed with the selection of Mexican restaurants when we moved to Champaign, until today!"}
{"text":"This was a surprise. A taqueria with the look and feel of a McDonald's. The place is very clean and service quick. The menus are in both English and Spanish, so no worries there, but some of the signs about specials were in Spanish only. We arrived just before noon and there was a very short line.   I ordered three tacos de lengua for 5.50, but they can be had for .99 each when they have specials. They were prepared quickly and were delicious. The tortillas probably were not made there, although I am not sure.  They were, however, very fresh and soft. There was ample chopped tongue topped with onions and cilantro. The tongue was delicious and they do not skimp on the quantity.  Other meat choices included chorizo, ground beef, chicken, pork, steak, pastor, and fish (for ten cents more). No complimentary chips and salsa (but you can order them). Of course, it's competing with Taco Bell, not sit down Mexican.  Our food came on real plates and they have real silverware (as well as plastic, if you want it to go). That alone puts them above their fast food competition.    My companion tried the grilled steak and veggies. It was served steaming hot with beans, rice, lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, guacamole, and tortillas.  Almost a fajita dinner, it was way too much to eat!  Everything was delicious, however. The steak was nicely seasoned and still tender, and sliced into thin strips. The veggies, heavy on the onions and peppers but included some squash and other things, also were nicely seasoned. She took some home, but said that everything was good.  We'd definitely go back.  By about ten after 12 the place was packed and the line stretched to the door. It appeared to move quickly, however, excepting for one person who appeared to need a lot of guidance about what to order. Several flat screen TVs were showing Mexican soap operas when we visit, but it appears they also show a lot of soccer judging from comments we heard.  Super Taco does have a bit of an identity complex. It looks and feels like a fast food place. But the menu also includes dinner items costing as much as $12 and would appear to come on several plates.  Plus, their location, across from Menards in the North Prospect area doesn't seem to make them a casual stop; I probably will visit (maybe often) when I am in that area, but I rarely go to that area. The food is very good, quite comparable to El Charro (in town). In fact, I think that El Charro and Super Taco are the only places around always having de lengua, cabeza, tripas available as tacos, burritos, etc.  Maybe Maize does too, but I don't recall for certain.  In any event, despite the odd location this place does a lot of business and serves very tasty food. The specials are extremely reasonable, but nothing here is really very expensive, especially given the quality and quantity of food they served us.  They have several hot sauces to choose from, but they are not on the table and don't appear to be advertised, but ask for hot, medium, chipotle, or verde at the counter and they will give you a bottle for your table.  I'll also add that as they get crowded they get noisier, and you will have to listen for your number to be called. No big deal if you are prepared for it."}
{"text":"Was walking in the neighborhood and had started to build a little appetite. Well lucky for me, thanks to the bookmarks on my handy Yelp app, I saw that I had a few places nearby that I had been wanting to check out. The difficult part was deciding between Los Planes and Super Taco, but eventually settled on the latter, as my quest to find a respectable taco in this town continued (I'm coming back for you Los Planes!). Super Taco is small and cute, and we caught them during a slow time, easily finding a nice window table. The have a few things on the menu, but we were focused on tacos, of which they have a sensible deal for four (tacos) at $5. If you do so happen to get one of these plates, you can only pick one filling, so I went for the carnitas (with an horchata - tasty!) while she went for the al pastor (with a pineapple Jarritos soda). The tacos, as with all the tacos I've had so far in Montreal, only feature one tortilla (where I'm from - California - tacos usually have two). That said, the meat was tasty, especially with the salsa verde y rojo provided by the very nice server. Of course, a couple of our tacos fell apart because why? That darned one tortilla thing. Nevertheless, the price point, taste, ambience, and kind service won us over I'd say. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Je suis assez déçue quand même.... Plusieurs facteurs ont contribué à ma déception: 1) la nourriture: assez fade, aucun assaisonnement. J'ai pris des tacos de steak, des tacos de langue, et une gringa (une sorte de quesadilla épaisse avec de la viande et du fromage). Que dire? Limite: aucune notion d'assaisonnement: tout juste de la coriandre hachée et un peu d'oignon dessus pour les tacos, la sauce piquante  d'accompagnement masque un peu l'aspect fade, mais je ne veux pas \"masquer\" les goûts, je veux que la viande soit goûteuse! Ou du moins une sauce d'accompagnement qui ait une autre dimension que le piquant. Sinon pour la gringa: bof, steak haché fromage, avec un gros tas d'une sorte de mayo/queso/crème sûre dessus, aucun intérêt, aucun assaisonnement, aucun goût relevé. De plus, pour un mercredi soir (soirée en spécial chez eux), quelques choix de viandes du menu n'étaient disponibles. 2) le service: En plus, le service est pas top: la serveuse a l'air perdue, ne parle presque ni français ni anglais, j'ai dû poser mes questions moitié français moitié espagnol pour comprendre le menu et passer ma commande. 3) la salle: ouais. Ça n'a pas l'air très propre (la table ne l'était pas en tout cas). Ambiance ni folklorique ni moderne, de vieilles photos délavées du mexique, lumière blanche. Mauvaise expérience. Je ne retournerai jamais dans cet endroit."}
{"text":"I come here regularly and get the chorizo enchladas with beans and rice. So good. Place is unassuming and usually not crowded. People are friendly. Hot salsa is hot, but not to an extreme, which I've definitely had. I think the folks who have freaked out about it are overexaggerating, or just not at all used to it."}
{"text":"Came here for taco Tuesday. Ordered food for my coworkers. It looks fine but they charge an extra .50 cents on to go orders. They also don't offer a vegetarian taco for toco Tuesday.  If you want to oder that it is $2 a piece ! Never coming here again. Extra changes and not vegetarian friendly! Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Simply love this hole in the wall. Very authentic. People super friendly.  Tacos are awesome."}
{"text":"I was craving tacos so my boyfriend and I decided to visit this place. The staffs were very welcoming and friendly.   We decided to order carnitas(pork), cabeza(beef's head), lengua(beef's tongue) and chorizo with piña and guava jarritos. You get 4 tacos (same meat) for $5. The tacos were so good ! My favourite one is the carnitas, juicy and tender pieces of pork topped with onions and you have a choice between two sauces. They're both equally spicy but I preferred the green one which is slightly tastier than the red one.  Wish I tried the churros but I didn't realize they have them til I was driving home. We will definitely visit again ! Thank you Super Taco!"}
{"text":"A quaint little spot for authentic Mexican food. The menu is very basic. The food is good, but there's better soft-shell tacos out there. The prices are excellent if you are on a small budget. $5 for 4 tacos. and everything else is around $6. Good and affordable."}
{"text":"On a random night, the boyfriend and I decided to get some cheapie bites. Since it was 9:30pm on a Wednesday, most restaurants or shops are already closed since we live in the east end. Luckily, we found Super Taco on Yelp and decided to drive over there. Boy, was that a good decision!  Good: The food was prepared quick, I had called in advance to let them know I will be coming in to make a take out order and they were nice about it. We also found out that on Wednesday, it's $1 taco night (but you have to order 4 of the same at a time)! BEST DOLLAR TACOS, especially if you're going on a budget. I had the vegetarian one and it was really tasty with the perfect stuffing to tortilla ratio. I think 3 orders between two people is sufficient, but if you're going to pig out, $1 taco is the night! Othewise it's $5 for 4 tacos on regular days.  Bad: The take out sauce packets come in little plastic craft bags so it's a bit messy to serve, but it's not a deal breaker. The pork taco was a bit dry and slightly underseasoned, so I wouldn't be ordering that again. Also, they actually close at 9:45pm, despite the hour written at 10pm.  Bottom Line: 10/10 would recommend a friend, it's as good as the street tacos I've had in Mexico."}
{"text":"I've only been once, but I'm glad I tried it despite the negative reviews. I had a chorizo burrito to go with extra cilantro and jalapenos and it was awesome. The price was awesome, too. It was a huge serving, enough for two meals, and under $6."}
{"text":"Service is sweet and food came out decently fast. But I'm rating on food. I had the 4 for $5, Tacos are basic and not that great tbh. I had the pastor tacos which is pork and pineapple, meh. Burrito was bland and textually was all smush because it's just beans and meat. Their hot sauce is spicy but I wish they gave a spicy and mild one to balance the two.  Overall, I wouldn't return and would not recommend. I'm still in search for my to go taco joint and this is definitely not the place for me."}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Some of these negative reviews are totally out of left field. This might be the *best* non-chain fast food currently in town.  This is a great taco joint, the kind of taqueria someone visits who knows what tacos are supposed to taste like. The place is immaculately clean, service is fast, and they follow all of the most important rules:  Tacos have onion and cilantro and two tortillas. Chorizo is well seared and a little crispy. Beef tacos, while not so traditional, have an amazing tomato base that makes this place Taco Tuesday destination dining. Mexican coke. Three salsas of varying heat, all delicious. I agree that the steak tacos are a little firm, chicken is OK. They have all the other stuff like burritos and quesadillas too, but this is fundamentally a great taco joint.  Really, for these prices, quality, a parking lot, and proximity to campus (about 3.5 miles) this is future destination dining for the University of Illinois students after a few drinks. There's nothing this good by campus, and in a bad food town such as C/U this place deserves a lot of attention."}
{"text":"Great food. I love the chicken tacos on dollar tacos on Taco Tuesday. And for all the dummies forgetting a drink it says on the signs with purchase of drink! How do you eat 3-4 tacos without a drink anyways?"}
{"text":"Super Taco--the wrong name for here.    The staff is rude and could care less.  I went there and was rudely treated as I attempted to place my order.  Find another place."}
{"text":"I had the carne asada tacos. The tacos themselves were pretty standard. The variety of sauces makes every bite a new experience if you try them all. The rice and beans were disappointing and dry. My friend had the toastada and baby burrito combo and enjoyed it. This place is relatively cheap, clean and decent food."}
{"text":"Authentic mexican cuisine. Reasonable prices. Good flavor."}
{"text":"I have been waiting for years for a place like this in mtl to open. Cheap and fresh tacos, totally authentic (which is impossible to find in this town) and amazing salsas. They do make great veggie tacos if you ask. This is def now my fav spot in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Super Taco used to be 5 stars for me but it has really changed over the last 1-2 years. I used to look forward to coming here for sopes, tortas, and the fajita special with my order being taken by enthusiastic staff.   But at some point, I noticed a new cashier and it seems like the food and service both took a giant hit. The steak became randomly chewy. I was suddenly told I couldn't substitute beans for pico de gallo (really? They're both dirt cheap). They gave me attitude when I asked to just take out the beans in an order because I said it AFTER I ordered (even though t changes nothing in the receipt). They forgot to give me any tortillas for my fajitas and when I drove back to tell them, they said \"oh yeah, here it is\" and didn't apologize or attempt to reconcile.   In addition, the atmosphere is nonexistent and they are sometimes closed randomly for private parties. Sorry but there are way too many other good Mexican places nearby for me to keep giving Super Taco more second chances."}
{"text":"Good simple tacos. I liked the burrito a lot too. Both sauce options are spicy for people with low tolerance."}
{"text":"Ok so this calls out for an update. I was here recently with some friends for some tacos, we also splurged and got some gorditas and a burrito. Everything was going fine, the el pastor tacos were as totally delicious as I'd remembered and the service was low key but charming, and the place was as haphazard looking as I remembered.  And then a parrot flew out from the kitchen and landed on the back of an unsuspecting customer. She stayed remarkably cool as the owner/chef came up, told her the bird was friendly, then picked it up and put it on his shoulder. Later the bird walked around on the tables. We kind of just stared and tried to keep our shit together and then laughed all the way home and hoped not to get bird flu.   I mean in other news, the burrito was a little heavy and bacony, the gorditas were greasy and delicious, and we ate piles of food for a totally wildly affordable sum. I dunno. Just seems a bit crazy to have a freaking bird walking around a restaurant. I just don't know what to do with that."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an afternoon bite. I had the 4tor5.00 taco. The mini tacos have a nice flavor and quite simple. Both the beaf and beaf tong are good. The tong is just more tender obviously. There spicy source gives it flavor and a nice kick.  The service was quick (well the place where as empty) and friendly. Don't expect to full with or even two orders. I'd go back and try the choices in the menu."}
{"text":"Great Tacos at a Great price.  Service is very friendly and fast. If you're shopping in the area. Stop by for some tacos."}
{"text":"eye heart super taco! holy guacamole 1 dollar taco wednesday kicks everyone elses taco asséz!!!! Also gotta love the grapefruit soda and bovine tongue delicacies ."}
{"text":"I think they got their name inspiration from super niros across the street. I had the chorizo tostada, chicken quesadilla and chicken tamale. All were tasty for the price! Chicken quesadilla wasnt substantial, howeber doused in the sauce it was tasty. By the time I had the tamale, my mouth was on fire from their extra hot sauce. Everything was well cooked, clean and fair for the price.  Horchata didn't taste syrup made and the restaurant was clean overall. Everyone was really friendly and the Tabasco sauce wallpaper fit well despite not serving Tabasco sauce in the store.   Good for the price, try it out! Will be back to try the mahi mahi tacos  Also they have a \"super burrito\" which is 20 inches  long... What."}
{"text":"Tacos are small but so affordable. I would recommend the tongue or vegetarian. If you want to spend a little more get the ford it's! The sauces that they serve you at the table are HOT so watch out! The atmosphere is relaxed. Futbol is always on in the corner, the kitchen is fully visible behind the register, and the servers are very sweet and polite. Fun place to come on any night of the week to enjoy a small meal"}
{"text":"With their menu saying tacos, the way you would get them in Mexico, I would expect their other food to be more authentic. I ordered the chorizo quesadilla and  a tamale. The quesadilla was made with American cheese and had a slice melted on top even.... yuck. It was just cheese and chorizo, I am used there being crema, quest fresco, and sometimes some veggies as well when getting a real authentic quesadilla.  The tamale wad ok. The chicken was a bit dry, and the sauce it was in had no flavor. The tamale itself was a but large and the corn part in some spots was a bit thick."}
{"text":"I love the soft chicken tacos here so much that I occasionally crave them! I haven't tried anything else here so I'm not going to go full five stars. The tacos aren't so much in the American style and are made with meat, cilantro, onions. The soft ones are wrapped in two thin corn tortillas, my preferred tortilla.  The thing that sets this place apart for me is the hot sauce. If you like heat, you have to try theirs. It's hot and has amazing flavor. I wish they sold bottles of it! The service is good. There is some wait while they prepare your food but that's normal, of course. You can call ahead and pick up if you prefer to carry out quickly. The place seems clean and there's plenty of seating if you decide to dine in. I never have. I always get a bag of tacos to go with as much hot sauce as I can get!"}
{"text":"I tried this place today for a nice lunch, I walked into the small resto and it had a nice Mexican authentic feel to it. The menu is very limited ,I took the 4 tacos for 5$, I took the chorizo and it was very flavourful but I was sort of taken back by how small they were, the size of your palm, but they tasted great. They put 2 sauces in the table and there both spicy, I suggest u be careful with them if your not into spicy food.  I was still hungry after the 4 tacos so I took a burrito, it had meat cooked with pineapple, the name doesn't come to mind but it was also very good. I also took a lemonade, tasted homemade, not to sweet very refreshing. The service was quick and efficient, and they were very friendly. I enjoyed it, I will try it again."}
{"text":"Great tacos, price is reasonable and quality always consistent. The hot salsa is very good too.  Usually give one cup of salsa per taco on to go orders."}
{"text":"I was on my way to run errands and realized I hadn't eaten all day, so I went there to get a gordita con todo for $5, it did not disappoint. Filling and so flavourful, the meat was well seasoned and the cilantro and onions were just the right amount to balance it all perfectly. The girl who worked the front that night was so nice and service was fast. There's many places that do tacos in the area, but these ones will charge you more for a gordita and it won't be as good as the one from Super Taco (FKA Impactaco)."}
{"text":"Best Tacos I've had in the area thus far.   Service is fast and friendly.   Wide array of beverages from Mexico plus standard Pepsi products.  Always clean and usually not crowded."}
{"text":"The food is always consistently good & authentic. Authenticity is important to me in foreign cuisines, and having lived in Mexico, I know the difference all too well.  Pros Authentic Freshly cooked Full of al pastor versus being stingy with meat   Neutral You fill your own cups with ice, not a big deal, but that's about the only neutral thing I can think of.   Cons No delivery A bit overpriced per taco    I read another review complaining about the mild sauce being too hot.  When eating foreign cuisine, it would be best to remember that you mild & their mild may vary quite a bit.  It's always best to try a little at a time."}
{"text":"This place is one of our go-tos. The tacos (especially the al pastor and chorizo) are delicious! Service is great and friendly, prices are good, and the tacos are (according to my latino boyfriend) very authentic. The terrasse in the summer is also very lovely. Makes for a wonderful lunch. Strongly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Third time, love it more each time. Good food, priced right. I skip the big Mexican places for this little dive every time in Champaign."}
{"text":"First time at Super Taco and I was very happy with the food and the price. I got 2 soft chicken tacos, 1 cheese enchilada and a large bottle of coke (import from Mexico) all for only $6.94!! I will definitely be back. Other than their vast selection of authentic Mexican dishes, they have more import soda flavors from Mexico than I've ever seen in a Mexican restaurant. Definitely a casual dress place, you order at the counter and they call you when your food is ready and you go get it."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service. We ordered a bunch of different tacos with the hot salsa, ....and it was HOTT!!!  Cant wait to go back!"}
