{"text":"I spotted the home-made sign saying 'Nettie's Cafe now Open!' at the corner of the block while I was driving to work this week, and stopped in for lunch today. This is a new restaurant in a location where a previous one had been - and burned down - last year. The place is all newly refurbished, down to the walls due to this. 

I dropped in for lunch today, and was very pleased with what I got - a hot roast beef and cheddar sandwich with home made horseradish sauce, on GLUTEN FREE Bread. They have a rotating menu it seems, but will be focused on local foods, and fairly healthy fare. Menu included vegetarian, vegan, meaty, gluten free items. They have a nice new coffee machine for your high end coffee drinks, fountain soda, bottled soda, and real Mexican coke! (Sugar!). Salad bar had home made dressings, coleslaw, and nifty marinated cucumber salad. 

Summery -
Hurray for Gluten Free! Only a small surcharge for fake bread, and it was a good brand of it (Udis)
A place the vegetarian here at work can eat too!
Nice tables, big back room for groups. They said they were keen on games too for back there.
Good coffee
Prices were good, and portion sizes were sensible.
Healthy fare - nothing fried. (but there was a deliciously large amount of cheese on my beef and cheddar sandwich, so not TOO healthy)
Hours bracket my workday at least 6:30am to 7pm M-F.

Edit: - They said they'd just gotten their phone hooked up, they number is not on the little single page menu I grabbed. But there is one!"}
{"text":"Nettie's is the BEST cafe in TOWN!!!! Everything is fresh! Best salad bar you'll ever try! Sandwiches are melt in your month good! Reasonably priced. CLEAN and relaxxxing environment!! The staff is VERY friendly and wonderful! :) 

I have been working in the area for the past 15 years and I've probably been in the place a millions times for lunch at varies restaurants that were there and let me tell ya the fire their last year really helped the old (dumpy) place. As you can tell I said CLEAN and I mean CLEAN. Everything is brand new! The place even feels and smells brand new. 

On a side note...even the bathrooms are new!!!! I had trouble working/finding the light and opening the door in the old bathroom

Everyone should really try it! It's the BEST!!! :)"}

{"text":"This place is a gem.  They feature a tasty salad bar, a stable \"favorites\" menu of breakfast and lunch fare, and a selection of weekly specials.  They stock Stella's Bakery breads for sandwiches, too.

The food and service haven't been less than excellent in all my visits.  I really can't recommend this place enough."}
