{"text":"Great food family atmosphere and  reasonable  prices what else could want.the hostess was very friendly and our waitress was very attentive . We will definitely be back often!"}
{"text":"I stopped at this paticular restaraunt some time back in the fall of 2016 and customer service was horrible. I ordered my drink and the lady who placed me and my daughter at our table had a nasty rude attitude and the waitress forgot to give me my drink. I ordered my food but they served me my bacon and eggs cold so I complained about everything to the owners wife and her reply was that I don't know what else you expect from me other then an apology which I never really got and that this is a family owned business. Pete is a nice looking restaraunt but something seemed dark and cold about this place as well. Anyway I don't think too many African American people dine in at this restaraunt!  #iwillnevereathereagain ( :"}
{"text":"Not a fan.  I went with a friend for dinner and tried the fish fry and was very disappointed.  The fish was very think and tasteless.  My friend ordered a chicken dish which looked really weird and barely had any chicken in it.  The lemon meringue pie was still frozen when served.  Perhaps their breakfasts are better."}
{"text":"It's a cafe on the east side...enough said. Is it really on the same review level as Luckys in tremont? I don't think so!"}
{"text":"I did not even know this place existed. But I am glad that I found it. The food was really good, good prices. Awesome desserts! The cheesecake hand me at pumpkin :)"}
{"text":"For what it is, this restaurant is good at it.  Hot food, served quickly, priced well and tasting pretty good.  This place beats the hell out of Denny's or IHOP or any chain breakfast joint.  I would've given them four stars if the review was just for mom-and-pops style restaurants.

I like the fact they didn't put butter all over the bread they give me but put it at the table so I could put on the amount that I wanted.  Small things mean a lot.

The coffee was more robust than most restaurants which is good because Usually what you get is watered-down nastiness that was not worth the money.  In the 20 minutes I was there they asked me if I wanted refills about for five times.

I'm a pretty big guy and I could not finish The bacon and cheese omelette/home fries  they gave me.  The Home fries were a little mushy for my tastes but they were still good.  The omelette was huge and fluffy with quite a bit of bacon inside.  

The restaurant was full of people and the staff was very helpful and friendly but busy as it should be on a Sunday morning.  The prices seemed fair for everything on the menu and the plates I saw coming out of the kitchen were all loaded full.

Looks like a great place to bring your family and have a fairly decent meal for a good price.  I'll be back again."}
{"text":"Good place to go for that diner vibe. Not a fan of their healthy choices as there really aren't any if you're looking for a salad or something. Decent food and friendly service though."}
{"text":"Great service and very good food.  Came for breakfast, had a corned beef and swiss omelet that was the best I've ever had!  Everything was cooked perfectly and of very high quality I would recommend this place to anybody that wanted a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Good simple food - dinners include soup, salad and dessert.  The wedding soup is very good.  Have eaten there twice this week while visiting family - both meals very good.  Friendly and efficent service.  The beef liver was tender and not overcooked.  Turkey and dressing was very good - especially good grean beans - fresh and cooke al dente."}
{"text":"We really liked Peties. Friendly workers, owner dressed so nicely. Clean & active environment. Wedding soup excellent. The spinach/bacon omlette was stuffed. Mushroom, swiss burger very good. You'll be glad you stopped."}
{"text":"Stopped for breakfast this morning on my way from Erie to Columbus. I had a mushroom and Swiss omelette, which for me, was overdone. It was browned on the outside - I know some people prefer their eggs this way, I like them softer and fluffier. Home fries could have been browned a little more, on the other hand. Eggs over medium with bacon for her. They were cooked perfectly. The place was fine, just geared toward a little older clientele, I think."}
{"text":"A wonderful neighborhood dive.  Hot roast turkey sandwiches made with freshly roasted turkey.  Homemade mashed potatoes - fresh green beans with a bit of a snap for a side.  On top of that they offer you soup, a salad and dessert - all for about $8.00.  I think this restaurant designed their menu for factory workers, because most folks couldn't eat all this food in one meal.  On another visit, I had the reuben - fabulous - piled high with corned beef and just the right amount of cheese and saurkraut - dressing on the side - I could only eat half.  Next thing to try at Petie's is breakfast, and I hear it's wonderful.  Yay for locally owned neighborhood restaurants."}
{"text":"I haven't been there in a while since they added a full bar and flat screens but before all of that the food was the ONLY thing that ever really mattered and it still should when you go there. It was nothing more than down-home moms kitchen cooking that just hit the \"spot.\" Need I say more? I shouldn't because the prices speak for themselves. It might be tough to find for a first timer since it's located within a shopping plaza but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Always quick service! Lots of breakfast options. Tons of unique omelettes or breakfast bowls. Waffles are good, berry yogurt with granola is my favorite! Have not had lunch or dinner here yet but it looks like plenty of options for that. It's like your typical breakfast / lunch diner food options, but with a twist. Everything is fresh and they use good quality ingredients. Yum!"}
{"text":"A very nice, modern and clean diner with great service and quality food. Mom and I went for an early dinner and our server Lizzy was top notch. 

She got the prime rib dinner that came with fresh bread, soup, salad and mashed potatoes. It was cooked to her well done wish without being dried out. It was so good that we ordered an additional prime rib dinner to go!

I ordered the eggplant Parmesan dinner with pasta, soup, salad and rice pudding. The eggplant cutlets were crispy and flavorful which is a nice change from the usual soggy mess I receive from other places. 

You get a lot of bang for your buck there! And they have a beautiful, drool worthy dessert case at the front counter.  Lots of cakes and cheesecakes in there, but you can pretend that they're just faux plastic foods if you're on a diet. I'll be frequenting this place for years to come! Bravo and great job guys!"}
{"text":"$.99 cent menu. Ala carte like 2 eggs, 2 bacon, among other items"}
{"text":"It's my hometown restaurant . Eat here when I need a place that makes me feel at home. Great food great people great prices!"}
{"text":"Talking about hospitality. Warm, friendly staff. Nice atmosphere. Clean.Huge menu selection. Large portions, daily specials and fast service. I cant wait until i can try the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, large portions, clean floors and bathroom what else do you want? Went here today with my kids and another family and we had a blast. Sunday 1230, 2 minute wait for a table and waitress was all over us.  She brought drinks quickly and took our orders at the appropriate time. Food was delicious and came relatively quick and we got to meet the owner who was super friendly. We all had breakfast stuff including pancakes, waffles and corned beef hash w eggs my favorite! Along with various sides including mozzarella sticks as an app.   My water was filled 5x in one hour even!
Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time in over 4 years and I was very impressed. They updated the whole restaurant and it looks great. Our waitress was extremely friendly and quick with our food. Their omelettes are HUGE and so good! Hands down my favorite thing to get here. This is a very nice family restaurant and I especially love it for breakfast."}
{"text":"This restaurant is close to my new apartment and came highly recommended as a low cost working class diner. It didn't disappoint.  At around 7 dollars for sandwiches, and 12$ for a dinner you cannot go wrong. One nice thing is that all dinners include dessert also! The service was a bit slow but the food was reputable diner food. This is the kind of place you could eat at daily.

This place also does a killer breakfast too I'm told, but haven't tried it personally. I got the simple cheeseburger and fries and it tasted like something you'd get at a summer picnic. It was very pleasant. The onion rings were especially notable. There were 5 to a plate, but each ring is the size of your hand!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. They have a variety of breakfast options. I normally get an omelette and French toast.  The cinnamon swirl and crunch French toast are bomb! The atmosphere is very chill and quiet. The servers are also ways attentive and friendly.  The prices are great.  I've been here many times and never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"Food is good we go here all the time for breakfast all day. I have never had anything that's wasn't good. Omelettes are always fresh. My husband got a sandwich one time and they come with homemade chips.. nice family place"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places. Good variety of food. Breakfast all day. They have the best omelets. Deserts are amazing.  Staff are always very friendly. Prices are excellent."}
{"text":"Old school with big portions, breakfast all day, pie big enough to share and great prices."}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant several times and we really enjoy it.  Large servings, good service and very friendly wait staff.  Service was fast and the food is good.  Nice when you don't feel like cooking at home.  We'll be going again."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I've been back since they had a fire.  They cleaned it up with new decor. Service is still the same, being consistent and thorough. Food is good as is coffee. I can't complain."}
{"text":"Family Restaurant. Yep. I know you're thinking that these good reviews are all based on this notion of a down home family restaurant sort of thing -- like, it's a family kind of place and everyone's so nice, it's usually pretty cheap, and it's all comfort food but it's not great food but the reviewers are gonna give it 5 stars because they just feel bad scoring it lower. 

Not so here. 

Dude, the food is good. Great in some instances, solidly good in others. I've never been truly disappointed in anything I've eaten here, and I've been honestly surprised at JUST how good some of it is. 

The Italian wedding soup is perfect. Every time. The burgers are good. The gyro meat is delish, the omelets are ginormous. Breakfast, lunch, dinner -- it's ALL good. 

If they have the banana split cheesecake when you're there, yes. Just, yes. 

And on top of that, you DO get the super nice family restaurant thing too. I was so sad when the fire shut them down for a while. They really did a fantastic job with remodeling and it's such a pleasant environment. And I can say this with some definitive authority, as I had to spend a good deal of time here recently when an extended power outage and internet outage meant I could not work from home, where I do normally. Not only did they not have a problem with me camping in a corner spot and plugging in and using their internet, they were absolutely GRACIOUS about it. No weird looks for me being here for 4 hours. No side eye even. (Yes, of course, I made a point of making sure my servers were taken care of, but they didn't know that was going to be the case yet, and they were SUPER nice!)

We normally get takeout from here - but I'm gonna insist we come here to eat inside more often. 

Petie's is the top of the top."}
{"text":"A weekly favorite for breakfast. All of the
Menu is great but the breakfast... to die for. Everything is always cooked perfectly, staff is friendly and quick."}
{"text":"The best local place.  Home cooked meals. Really good.  Love it     Greek family that takes pride in their business"}
{"text":"I was just here after birthday shopping for my dad. I wanted to get something to eat I walked in got seated. The girl who sat me was sweet gave me my drink and menu. I knew what I wanted. Well I waited 20 minutes no one came around. An older man got seated and had his starter when he came in after me. I waited 20 minutes and no service. I walked out didnt pay for my drink since they weren't busy at all and everyone else was get served im beyond pissed that i got up and walked out dont care. If they're going to be petty about me not paying for a drink thats on them"}
{"text":"Pretty standard breakfast place, especially for this part of town. Our waiter was extremely friendly and attentive, even offering additions/condiments for my meal that I wouldn't have thought of. I thought that was a nice touch!

As far as the food goes, I thought it was pretty ordinary. Then again, I got something that you really can't mess up - overeasy eggs, sausage patties, home fries (kinda chunky, eh) and toast. It wasn't bad but there wasn't anything to make it stand out from other restaurants.

The atmosphere was bustling and busy. Lots of families with kids and old lady groups all around. Not too loud though. I have a feeling they have a lot of Willowick regulars that fill this place up daily!"}
{"text":"I live in the area, and we eat here frequently. The cook is tremendously lazy with omelettes - he drops a 1\" cube in the center of the omelette, and lets heat do the rest. Unfortunately, you get an omelette with a 1\" cube of cheese in the center, and none even a half-inch away from the center. We have asked the waitress to tell the cook NOT to do this, and he does it anyway, so I no longer order the omelettes here. Go for the tuna melt."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times for breakfast and once for lunch and definitely plan to go again! The first time around I got a bacon and cheese omelet and my better half got the meat lover's. I was taken aback by the portions! HUGE and for such a great price! The omelets were great, the home fries were a little bland, but some salt & pepper and/or ketchup solved that. This time around I got the biscuits and gravy combo and HOLY COW it was BIG! It was also very, very tasty and inexpensive! He got the Greek omelet and I just had to try some. Next time we go I'll be ordering that! It was very flavorful and well prepared. The wait staff is also very friendly and attentive. I'm officially never going to Denny's again! I wasn't entirely impressed with lunch there, but go for breakfast! It's amazing! And they seem to have really good dinner specials."}
{"text":"He wanted breakfast. I wanted lunch. So we set out to find a place that offered the best of both. The early afternoon crowd didn't cause the service to slow down at all. We were seated quickly and the waitress came to see about us right away. I ordered the fish and chips. It was filling and delicious. You get 3 sides with the meal so you won't leave hungry! The kids menu has a nicer variety than some other diners and it certainly filled up my hungry boy. This was my first time here but it will not be the last."}
{"text":"Love this place!   Friendly service,  huge portions,  great prices,  and yummy food!  Order breakfast on the weekdays, and you'll be shocked at how inexpensive it is.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"Petie's is back open and better than ever!  Both the menu and service is top notch.  They just reopened 6/7/16 after having to remodel because of a fire.  Don't waste anymore time, get to Petie's!"}
{"text":"Peties is a great local family owned restaurant.  We love to meet here with family and friends. The food is great, pricing is very reasonable and staff are always friendly."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times now. Excellent service- EXCELLENT FOOD and huge menu to choose from. Awesome huge breakfasts- best I've ever had! Great dinners- everything homemade and delicious. Can't go wrong with one of their many omelettes for breakfast, or Fried cod for dinner was a favorite also! Don't forget dessert- their homemade rice pudding is not to be missed!"}
{"text":"I take everyone I know to Petie's now. Since I found it with my husband and it's right down the street, I've taken my parents and friends. The food is delicious and is definitely the right price. My favorite thing about the whole place is the service. Every different person who has waited on me has been pleasant, cheerful, and gracious. You can't find that anywhere these days. The people actually seem happy to be there early on a Saturday morning. You just can't beat good service AND good food."}
{"text":"Grew up in the area and Petie's is a neighborhood gem! Always stop for breakfast when I'm in town. 

This time I got the crazy omelet - outrageously huge but perfect when you can't decide what you want :) it's really shareable. From what I remember the menu is updated and they had a ton of waffles that look sinful (cannoli!). 

Will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Been there few times. Tonight is the worst night of all. We went in as usual. Not very busy at all. We were seated and waited for a long time. No one came in for drinks or acknowledge us. After about 10 minutes with no one serving our table , I just walked out. 

All the employees were gathering at the back of the house and not really serving the tables. on the big section there were about 5 table tops. Only our table and another table just got seated almost the same time."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first visit at Petie's. The scrod was delish, the steamed string beans and carrots were yummy too. The service was really good, the meal came with soup and salad and dessert was only $ .50 more. The only thing I didn't care for was the coffee. It was bitter. All in all a good meal for only $9.99. You can't beat that!"}
{"text":"First time back since the fire, pleasant surprised, updated decor. Food was really good and prices are great, will return"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite secret spots. I shouldn't say secret but it's a hidden gem tucked in a strip mall in willowick. I love supporting family owned place and have been frequenting this place since testing week of my junior year of high school when we got a delayed start to make sure we are breakfast. So 12 years of this amazing place and I moved next door! After the fire they rebuilt and came back with a vengeance. It's still the same amazing family owned place with the best of family recipes and delicious food but it's updated the atmosphere. It's packed weekend mornings but their food is never sub-par. I've tried most of their meatless breakfasts, love veggies hashes, omelettes and pancakes. My boyfriend swears but the meatier hashes. We don't often go for lunch or dinner, but the one time we did it was great, breakfast was just better!! We also occasionally stop in for dessert to go. Wait til you see their cake case. It's a beautiful display case full of cakes and pies and it is impossible to resist. Their portions are so large I never have room for dessert there but I highly suggest getting it to go!"}
{"text":"I have to say this place took us by surprise!! Defiantly bigger than we expected. The service was outstanding. Our server plus other servers were very attentive and checked on all tables during our visit.
Great selection and choices for breakfast!!
They have pancakes just about anyway you want them.
We will visit here again....."}
{"text":"Good food large portions.
$5 burger night on Tuesday. Man are they good too.
Keep trying different breakfast here they all are good.."}
{"text":"We love Petie's. We have enjoyed their top notch service that aims to please. FOH is very attentive and prompt during our visits. The space is clean and the ambience is very nice, especially with the nice B&W photos hung on the walls. We've come here for breakfast a few times and Best really likes their huge omelettes :)

I just want to mention the syrup on our visit ran a bit thin in consistency on this visit, and our waffles and pancake (although still good) were not as soft or buttery as previous visits..those still get a 3 star (good). That being said, we recommend their french toast as our fave in the carb category. 

Excellent service, clean (lovely) ambience, and a yummy menu of wide selections gets them a 4 star rating."}
{"text":"This place has been here forever it seems. I visit this shopping plaza quite often, and I'm mad I never stopped in here earlier! We tried their breakfast. I had the country fried steak and eggs and my companion had banana crunch pancakes. Everything came out fresh and was cooked perfectly. The servers are very friendly and attentive. My only negative would be the decor. It needs an update."}
{"text":"I am giving peties four stars because it is a nice little place. Not five star cause it's kind of average... But what I usually get is there wedding soup, a quart to go. Try their wedding soup! Maybe you like it."}
{"text":"I lived in Euclid for five years and somehow never discovered this place. If I still did I'd be here every week. GET THE WEDDING SOUP. Get some to take home too. The Sparta burger was the bomb but it looked like everything was. Wish I had time this visit to come for breakfast. Service was absolutely top notch too."}
{"text":"This is your typical family \"greasy spoon\" kind of place but with a Greek twist.  I had the Greek omelet and it was very yummy.  The service was friendly and fast and it feels like the kind of place where they get a lot of regulars so everyone knows each other."}
