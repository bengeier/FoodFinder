{"text":"Looking for a place for great Greek food in Montreal - this is your place.  Kalimera has comforting greek food with large portion all for a decent price.  I was here last night for a family dinner and we all enjoyed our meal.  For 4 of us, the dinner came to under $100 and we even had leftovers to take home.  I highly recommend this place if you are in the Cote des Neige area."}

{"text":"For the last 15 years since I was introduced to Kalimera I have returned every time I visit Montreál.  It's just that good.  It is a wonderful family owned and operated restaurant. You can tell the Hurtado family takes great pride in what they do.  I have been for both lunch and for dinner numerous times over the years, and every single time it has been a delight in every way.    This is a Greek restaurant, but offers a wide variety of amazing entrées from various kinds of seafood, to steak, to chicken, lamb, even escargot... on this last visit I had some mixed seafood ceviche which was awesome.  Their salmon or shrimp are absolutely delicious.  One of my favorites is the grilled chicken shish kebab (brochette).   Of course, their gyro is classic Greek goodness!   Everything I have ever tried here has been cooked perfectly, steaks done to order, all served hot and fresh.  The salads and deserts are also wonderful!   The service I have received is consistently impeccable, professional, and friendly regardless of how busy it is.  And believe me, it can get busy as it is a favorite among locals!  The staff, all family members, speak French, English, Spanish and Chinese!    The ambience is casual.  They have outside dining as well as a two level dining room.  There are large pictures of scenes from Greece to help set the mood.    Can you tell I really love this place!?  I do!  I so wish we had a restaurant like this in the Texas Rio Grande Valley where I live."}
