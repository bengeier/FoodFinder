{"text":"Favorite place for bagels in the Cleveland area.  Great spreads, good prices.  We go very often."}
{"text":"THE place in Solon for bagels & best deli items.  Love the everything bagels with lite veggie cream cheese.  Free coffee refills. They will start serving dinner mid-January 2013!"}
{"text":"Awesome bagels!! These bagels are huge with just the right chewy texture. I especially love the jalapeño cream cheese...the cream cheese sort of cancels out the spiciness for a really good flavor. Also, the owner is always pleasant and friendly. Their new site is right next to Planet Fitness in the shopping plaza behind their former store."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwiches are awful.  The egg is rubbery and cold.  The bagels are flavorless.   The hash browns are overly oily.   I hate to say it but Dunkin Donuts has better bagels."}
{"text":"Great inexpensive breakfast restaurant! This place specializes in bagels, but has tons of other options for breakfast.  Their cream cheese selection is the best! There is plenty of room to sit and eat your meal or have a cup o' Joe.  I also like the friendly staff and quick service."}
{"text":"Best bagels around and pretty darn good. Try the lox. Sandwiches are great. Try the Triple Play. Best sandwich I've had in a long time. I added bacon to mine. Wow. Call ahead to have it ready. Great service."}
{"text":"I love D&R's bagels, especially their egg sandwiches!  Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, with gooey cheese, egg, and corned beef- you can't get any better than that.  My favorite are their egg bagels!  The cream cheese selection is also mouthwatering."}
{"text":"No  bagels hmmmm? Bagel shop? Hmmm? Thats what happens when you don't watch your business....  please have bagels on Sunday...."}
{"text":"I was in Solon for a car appointment and was planning on heading to Starbucks to get breakfast/coffee when I stumbled upon D & R. I LOVE bagels so couldn't resist.   It reminded me a little of Barry Bagels in Toledo (though nothing compares to Barry's). They have a wide selection of bagels, sandwiches, and spreads. Give it 3 because the staff wasn't overly friendly, and the bagel was a little too bread-y for me. I like a denser bagel. Overall though, my breakfast sandwich was pretty delicious. Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"Bagel was a little disappointing, I had an everything bagel with veggie cream cheese.  The cream cheese was good but the Bagel was tough and dry, kind of a bummer.  I wish there was a place in the area that sold bagels of the quality of Einstein or Brugers. I'll keep looking."}
{"text":"Tasty bagels?  Yes. Dietz & Watson meats?  Yes. Good employees?  NO.  I get frustrated by places that serve good food but have incapable employees that translate into bad service.  What is up with hiring a bunch of high schoolers who screw around and take a long time and still don't get your order correct?  One didn't know which bagels they had.  The other didn't know what was on a Turkey Club.  And when I asked for an everything bagel I ended up getting an onion bagel.  I left so frustrated with the place."}
{"text":"Good bagels, ok service, somewhat dirty coffee creamer station considering a bunch of workers were standing around.  Lack luster artificial sweetener choices as well.   Probably would visit again bc it's close, but wouldn't go out of my way."}
{"text":"Great food and a longstanding part of the Solon community- great bagels, sandwiches, and more. New location is larger/more open, and MUCH cleaner. Only downside is slow-ish service, depending on the time of day. Overall, a great pick for an inexpensive morning meal!"}
{"text":"Stop to meet my business partner and another contractor.  Great coffee and bagels.  The meeting went smooth and wasn't bothered by anyone"}
{"text":"Really cute bagel shop right in the Plaza. I work in the Plaza so it's nice to have such great bagels to eat when I work so early! Bagels are fantastic & breakfast sandwiches are really great too! It's inexpensive & the employees work efficiently."}
{"text":"Food is amazing here, and the services is pretty friendly too. Get the Greek Omelet! Tip the staff because they deserve it"}
{"text":"Called to place a pick up order and got hung up on.  Figured it was just an accident.  Called back and was told hang on I cannot hear you, was put on hold.  Finally gave up.  Must be too busy I guess to take phone calls or large group pickup orders.  Glad they are doing well enough that they can turn away business and customers.  Plenty of other competitors I can go to that I am sure would appreciate the business... Calling Jim's O.K. , always had friendly results there and no hang ups."}
{"text":"Authentic bagels and delicious cream cheese in Solon."}
{"text":"Bagels are fresh, coffee is unique and delicious! For breakfast you can get a plate of 2 eggs and hash browns for $1.75. Really great spot for breakfast and lunch! Parking is plentiful."}
{"text":"Been going here for YEARS but never thought to review it as I figured it was already done, not a fan of the grocery items but the deli and sammiches are  hand made and fresh. Best freaken Lox in the world too...And they make their own corned beef hash...Oops...Secrets out I s'pose....."}
{"text":"I have eaten bagels at a lot of different places across the country, and without a doubt D&R is the best I've ever had (maybe except for New York). They are served fresh with an incredibly soft inside and a great firm, crispy outside. Every time I find myself back in Cleveland I pick up a dozen and literally haul it through the airport to take it back home. The staff is also very friendly and the restaurant is clean. I will be coming back to D&R for years and years to come."}
{"text":"The last time I went to this place, they were in their old location. It was dumpy, dirty and the bagels were 1 tick above Lenders bagels. Today, I visited their new location in the adjacent plaza and had a wonderful experience. The new location is clean and very nice looking. I bought a toasted Asiago bagel with jalapeño cream cheese. This was the best bagel I have had in years. They slathered on the cream cheese like the old Broadway Bagels did 15 years ago. I didn't realize they serve many other breakfast items such as pancakes, French toast, and omelettes. They also serve deli sandwiches for lunch. And best of all they are open on Sundays."}
{"text":"This place is by far one of the highlights of our trips to Ohio. A water boiled bagel abs deli shop that rivals any in NY!  Simply love it!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 10 stars!  I have been to this place many times and always had a wonderful experience.  This morning, I visited the restaurant and was warmly greeted by a young man.  He was gracious, friendly and helpful.   Ordered a dozen bagels. My wife & I have been to New York City many times and these bagels remind us of the bagels we get in NYC.  Delicious bagels!  We also love the unique variety of cream cheeses.  I am looking forward to my next visit to this outstanding bagel shop!"}
{"text":"Cheap eats but he breakfast is that great. Probably decent if you are just getting bagels which I've never done. The food is really cheap which is good. It's counter service, so there's no wait staff."}
{"text":"Awful service. Food tasted genetic. Didn't even toast the bagel. Breakfast sandwich wasn't even melted. Returned  everything. Didn't even refund our money. What a waste."}
{"text":"Used to be better. They moved to a prettier store front, but they hire really inexperienced and slow kids, who don't know the menu,  aren't trained, and frequently make mistakes. I got the wrong sandwich again this morning, even though the counter person wrote it down.  I give up with these guys. Too bad. I been coming here since 98. Bite for bite, Einsteins in Chagrin has better bagels."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised. Food was great. Good value for the money. Asiago bagel was delicious! Service was fast and friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic bagels! Traveled here from south Florida and tried D&R.   Got a bialy with nova and tomato. Is was fantastic!! My friend got a cinnamon raisin and loved it.  Very clean and great fresh tasting. Made onsite daily!  Clean! Staff very friendly. Highly recommend trying!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place .. I cannot seem to find anyone that offers a rye bagel anymore & these guys do & it is fantastic .. their whipped cream cheese offerings are delicious & their cheese danish has gotta be on the best I have ever tasted .. I have a co-worker who brings these in to work every so often & had he not I may never have known about this joint"}
{"text":"As a former New Yorker (born and raised in the Bronx, lived in Manhattan for 20 years), I'm not easily impressed by bagels beyond the Hudson River. The bagels at D & R are practically as good as New York bagels. They make very good bialys too (which are very hard to find outside the Five Boroughs, regardless of the quality). I highly recommend D & R."}
{"text":"Watch the address - they moved locations in 2015 and they are now in a strip mall in Solon.  Still making the best bagels ever!"}
{"text":"It was exactly what I expected -- nothing more, nothing less. I gave it four stars because there are very few bagel shops in this area so it gets points for distinctiveness, but if this were in a city, I'd give it a 3."}
{"text":"i stumbled on this deli on the way to another donut shop.  i haven't regretted it! i get a dz bagels with smears and everything is gone in minutes.  the bagels are fresh and the prices is reasonable.  there's also lunch items but i haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"5-stars for bagels. Selection and quality are great.  2-stars for eat-in food and service. Takes longer than you'd expect. If you're ordering for more than one person, there is a good chance one of you will be eating cold food. Just OK."}
{"text":"Whoooooooa, bagels.  Nobody was more surprised than I when I found a bagel place that was actually as good as my favorite bagel spot. I can rarely make it to my 'unnamed favorite bagel spot' due to proximity to my house and work and thought D&R at least deserved a chance.  Seriously good bagels, sandwiches and cream cheese. I could not have been more pleased.  Maybe they're still figuring out the logistics (they just moved into this location), but it seems like food preparation is done in too many spots. They do a lot of running to the back.  However, my food has always taken a reasonable amount of time to be made and I think the price is a good value.  THIS is my new favorite spot and I will be back here. Repeatedly. Thrice weekly. Til they kick me out."}
{"text":"Everybody needs a bagel shop in their life, and I was afraid I wasn't going to have one after moving from Toledo, but guess what! I found one.  D&R was previously in a different location, and they traded up and into the plaza.  I have only been to the new location.  I have to assume they had a system and layout that was already in place and carried it over to the new store because it's pretty awkward and cramped when ordering and getting your food.  It goes 1) Bagels 2) Order 3) Electronic menus 4) registers and waiting area 5) cream cheese and 6) lunch meats, which is pretty illogical, as is their layout for the menu.  Couple hundred bucks to a graphic designer would clean up one of those issues.  The bagels are pretty great.  They have a great selection.  You can get a lot of different combinations on them.  If they displayed the beautiful cream cheese anywhere near the bagels, you might be more tempted to branch out of \"regular\".  I've only been for lunch and the breakfast sandwiches are beyond what you can get at Starbucks, Dunkin, McDonalds, etc so it does have its place in our hearts.  I haven't been for lunch, so that's probably the next step.  I haven't really been tempted for lunch based on the menu layout and they don't have \"signature\" sandwiches."}
{"text":"I think I found one of the only other places in the city to find a decent bagel outside of Bialy's. My friend and I were driving around Solon for lunch and he recommended D & R Bagels. I saw Boars Head deli meats in the case. The menu is expansive and very cheap. I had a turkey sandwich on multi-grain with muenster cheese. It was delicious. The meat was shaved and piled high. I prefer this arrangement because the texture of the meat is way better than Subway style frisbee-ish cold cuts. My friend had the pastrami and corned beef. He said it was good. I decided to only eat half the sandwich and try a bagel. This was one of the best ideas I have had in a while. The half a sandwich served as dinner tonight. The bagel was delicious. It is prepared the proper way bagels should be done. They boil them then finish them off in the oven. Nothing like a Panera Bread \"bagel\" that people always buy for work functions. Panera bagels are just big ass pieces of bread. I am pretty pumped to find this place!"}
{"text":"Not a bad little shop. Will be back to try a sandwich! Menu looks awesome. Opened at 4:30. Door was locked at 4:31. She walked over to turn on the \"open\" sign at 4:33 and walked away. I tried the door again, and now it's unlocked. Like dang, you could have opened the door for me?!  Tons of fresh bagels!!! Ordered a dozen for work. Nice and fresh! Cinnamon and sugar was the favorite! Smeared up with cream cheese! Delicious! Little disappointed in the blueberry. As someone at work put it \" looks like a smurf fart\" it's blue and swirly inside but no blueberry flavoring.  All and all good experience.  Closest I've had to real New York bagels. Will be back to try other menu items."}
{"text":"The best bagels this side of NYC. Fair prices too! Everything on the menu is awesome but I'm usually there for a bagel on my way to work in Solon. I'm partial to the scallion cream cheese but the Lox cream cheese rocks! The friendly faces are wonderful to see and they never disappoint my yawning stomach! Their new location is beautiful and perfectly situated. I am always smiling when I'm going in or coming out, no matter what lovely snack I have tucked into the white bag!"}
{"text":"Decent spot to go and have a quick breakfast/lunch. I would recommended the lox sandwich on a bagel w/ a cup of matzo ball. Nothing special but always consistent."}
