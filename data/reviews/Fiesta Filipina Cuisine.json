{"text":"Came in for an early dinner before catching a flight out.  Had pinakbet (my fav veggie dish) and bistek with onions.  Food was pleasantly warm which is normally unusual for a turo-turo place.  Good food for a quickie bite!  Will return..."}
{"text":"Yummy Filipino food. Since I don't know how to cook that many Filipino dishes, Fiesta Filipino is the place to go. It's not quite like home cooking but close enough. I just love their Crispy Pata, probably one of my favorite dishes they make. I have been here a few times and finally got to try their Kare-Kare, it was just okay they over cooked the beef because it was dry and tasted a little burnt."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely delicious and prices are reasonable! I definitely like coming here for my Filipino food fix.."}
{"text":"Best bbq pork stick in town!!   Tried it at many location but nothing come even close to fiesta. The bbq pork is pack with flavor and very tender. Whenever we throw a party at the house we usually order a tray of 50 sticks, that's how good they are.       I love the way fiesta look on the inside, nicely decorated make you feel like your in phillipines. Fiesta has 2 location, both places serve good food but I prefer the one down south on ST. ROSE, its alot closer to the house. Overall good filipino food with ok service."}
{"text":"Good food just like the other 2 stores on jones and in Henderson. I also thought the service was great until today when they let someone cut in front of me. I was already good to go and check out but then the heavy set worker insisted that the man right behind me got to check out first because he ordered less items. And when they were checking him out he decided to order more food and I had to wait longer. I was ready to walk out but instead I held my composure. They should've checked me out first like how all normal businesses would no matter how many items a customer purchases. Instead they made me feel like my business there was less appreciated even though I go there all the time and spend a good amount of money. I guess I'll take my business back to jones where they always appreciated my business."}
{"text":"What can I say, first of all thanks to Rey and Alma who took care of us when we went there Thanksgiving week.  Not only did we go once, we went back for the second time. :).  My sister also recommended us to go here. She was right.  They have lots of variety and most of all my favorite Lechon Kawali and the Halo Halo.  We were stuffed and it's only a dish with rice and two sides.   I highly recommend this place.   Thank you again Rey and Alma!! Mabuhay from Virginia."}
{"text":"This is my regular Filipino restaurant while I am in Vegas.irs not quite like my mothers home cooking but it is very fresh & delicious every time"}
{"text":"I was planning on hitting up another Filipino fast food joint on sahara and found this instead.  It was definitely a blessing because this is the best one yet in Vegas."}
{"text":"Place is nice and clean and have that Filipino restaurant ambience . Restroom was clean too. Now for the food , it's mediocre. We ordered adobo ,not so good and looks like mixed from other recycled adobo. Lechon kawali was dry and BBQ was not the traditional way cooked on charcoal. It was soaked it sauce and again just not a delicious choice. Maybe if they change their cook this will be a fantastic dining place."}
{"text":"Just ok for me - saves me the drive to Vegas if I crave Pinoy food. One suggestion: why can't they publish their daily menu online? It's always a guessing game everytime I go there. Or maybe they can offer online ordering for busy folks like me? PS: Why do you keep on pushing turons at the end of the line at the cashier?"}
{"text":"Amazing authentic Filipino food! Best place we have ate in Las Vegas, end of story! It is great for everyone and will fill you up without breaking your wallet."}
{"text":"What a wonderful surprise.  This is my first time trying Filipino food.  If you like Chinese, Indian, Thai, and Spanish food you'd love Filipino food as much as I did. The decor, the servers, the cook, even the clients seemed to be very Filipino.   I Tried the Lumpiang Shanghai (similar to spring rolls), Beef Caldereta (super soft beef in tomato sour stew), and Sinigang na Baboy ( lime based soup with super soft chunks of pork)  I'm definitely coming back..."}
{"text":"I hate rice, but there's is awesome!!!! Awesome food and so cheap $7.11 for two items of meat, two big scoops of rice and a can of pop!"}
{"text":"I ordered pansit with barbeque. They gave very small portion of the noodles.  And I confronted  the old lady who served me why the portion is very little, she didn't say anything.  Its always like this when she serves but the other server are ok. I don't recommend this place and I'm not going back."}
{"text":"The reason Fiesta Filipina is expanding is because they always put out fresh food. I have been to a lot of pinoy turo turo joints that have shut down or been replaced due to not having fresh food on display. Fiesta Filipina also has the best made to order crispy pata in town.   They have three locations in the valley and i hope they open more. Summerlin and north las vegas area would welcome them with many repeat customers."}
{"text":"This place is my go to when I crave Filipino food cuz I can't cook it.. Lol. Food is always fresh . Workers there are always smiling and friendly . Great prices.. Love the new location since its just down the street!! Definitely try this play out! We usually get the pork BBQ stick, pancit, Kare Kare, bistek, lechon, and they give you sinigang soup on the side.. All I can say is YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"This is the place I go for pinoy food....i have tried several places and this place is always clean and the staff is always helpful. I go here at least 5 times a month and we always cater for our parties. Everyone so far that we take here loves the food."}
{"text":"As soon as you walk in you feel like you are in the PI! The staff is super nice and pleasant! I like that the food is good and not super expensive! It's near home and my office so it's conveniently located for me. I like the turon, halo-halo, okoy, and their combination plates. When I crave for Filipino food I come here!"}
{"text":"This is the only Filipino food place that my mom would eat from. My mom is the best cook ever when it comes the Filipino cuisine. She very particular about where I get food from. I've tried many many places and this is the only place she actually request certain foods from. She loves their Kare Kare. It's really delicious. They also make really good Pinakbet. I love the Turon for desert. I recently tried the Fresh Lumpia and it's delicious. A go to place if you want great tasting Filipino food and you don't feel like cooking at home. 4 happy stars:)"}
{"text":"I must say I've never given a 1 star rating to any business until now, but I just had to this time for this restaurant. We went there on Sunday July 17, 2011. The food was actually pretty good, we ordered the pork and chicken barbecue, mongo, pork adobo, halo halo, lechon, and a few other dishes.   I was with a group of 6 people, and after we ate here 5 out of 6 of us got sick from the food. Diarrhea, Fever, Chills, and puking. I rarely get food poisoning from restaurants, so something must of been seriously wrong with their cleanliness. We also noticed that most of the food we ordered was cold, (except for the rice) we think that was the reason we got food poisoning. It's highly possible that the cold food had some sort of parasites causing us to get ill. Luckily my pregnant wife was the only one who did not get sick, even our 1 year old niece got sick, so NOT worth it.  I will NEVER go back to this place. Fiesta Filipina Cuisine, please heat your food properly otherwise you are a health hazard."}
{"text":"We went this past sunday, and had BBq chicken, ginataan, pinakbet, & pancit. Serving size is good! Their pinakbet is the best so far. TFC & NBA on TV, plenty of seats, space for the kids, lots of desserts. We were going to make a 2nd trip but, Called today, Hours changed, open til 8pm. I've bought turon here for potlucks, good & priced right."}
{"text":"Best Filipino food in town. Lots of space to hangout, and their sticky rice balls on a stick are to DIE for."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing!!! We ordered pinacbet, pancit, lechon kawali, kare kare and the chicken on a stick. Everything tasted great! The staff here is very friendly as well! Overall, it was a great experience and I will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch this place was a good find. 2 scoop of rice with a choice of two dishes for $6 + almost all the food that we ordered were cleaned up. Turon is crunchy and yummy, halo-halo is not bad .The food  tastes like a home cooked food. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"I was more than excited when I heard there's a location near hm that serves pata. I've been in search for a place that serves pata and couldn't wait to try it out.   I came in on a Monday and was surprised they're busy for being a weekday before lunch hour. I ordered a pata which was $17.99 and a few vegetable items. The food was kept in a warmer similar to fast food joints. I added rice for an additional fee. It's served fast food style. The employees here needs to be more helpful since I don't speak their language. I feel like I'm treated with less respect than their people. The employees here are extra nice to the philipino's that walk through the door and I get the stare.  The food came out cold and the pata wasn't hot to order as claimed. Seemed like they went in back to the kitchen to bring out an order of pata that was cooked earlier and re heated. I was disappointed cause my pata was flavor less, cold, and greasy.   It took me 15 minutes to wave the employees down to get a togo box. Another 5 minutes to get it. 15minutes to get my desert which was another disappointment.   I paid $5 for a cup of halo halo. A cup of 90% ice and 10% mixed crap to be exact. I wonder if giving this place 3 stars is being over generous."}
{"text":"Today was the second time me & my husband came here to eat. We will never come back here again! The older employees are RUDE! They don't even acknowledge you. They leave you hanging there as if its such a hassle to serve you. Their food is not even great! It's so oily and no taste and expensive! Thank goodness Nanay Gloria's just opened a block away from this place."}
{"text":"This filipino restaurant is in a really good location. In between two hospitals (St. Rose and Southern Hills) which you know there's filipino nurses and doctors working there haha! All jokes aside, food is really good. For me, it's the typical filipino food you eat at a filipino party. Lumpia, bbq on a stick, adobo, kaldareta, bisteak, turon, etc. They also do carry snacks just like the Sari-Sari store such as Sarsi, C2, cheez curls, cheese-o's, clover chips and many more. Staff is friendly and fluent in both English and Tagalog. I also must say, their bathroom signs are legit! Maganda for Women's, Pogi for Men's! Haha it's so rad! Definitely a place you can go to get your home-cooked meal fix!"}
{"text":"I can't believe some of these reviews. This place reminds me of home. The portions were more than generous and the food was absolutely delicious. Any chance I get to come and eat even tbough it's a drive, i will and i have."}
{"text":"Grand opening was busy but I have to say it was really organized. Food was and always grinds!   So happy that there is another Filipino Restaurant to choose from."}
{"text":"The filipino decor of this place is very welcoming!  The workers are friendly and the place is overall clean.  The food there is \"turo-turo style\" meaning \"to point\".  All the food is layed out on warmers and you just tell the worker what you want.   My favorite food there is their BBQ sticks!  There's just something about filipino BBQ sticks that just make them the best ever!  They have either pork or chicken.    I have noticed that this restaurant has too many pork dishes, more than any other type of meat.  I was hoping for chicken adobo but they usually only have pork, or pork sinigang instead of beef sinigang.  Also, I personally am a bit picky with where I get my dinaguan but decided to try it here one day.  It was a bit soup-y, where as I like the texture kinda thick, and there was not as much meat in it, it was whatever the thin, hard part of the pig is.      Overall, I am still a fan of this place.  But I will admit, I do mainly go here specifically for their BBQ sticks!"}
{"text":"If there was a 0 rating I would do it because that cashier is still there and she is still rude!!!!  - don't they know customer service??"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time I've been here and they ran out of BBQ sticks and Lechon Kawali by 5:30pm.  It's a popular item so they should continuously have it available from opening till close.  What a disappointment = \"}
{"text":"Wow.  Just wow. Their adobo  is worth the price. The piece is dirt cheap and you can eat like a king.  A Def must try. The service is great too."}
{"text":"I've haven't been to this place and despite the reviews I don't plan to especially after my experience over the phone. I called to get a quote for a tray of pancit and lumpia for 50 people. Got quoted $32.99 for 100 pieces which seems to be the going rate but $85 for pancit!!  Really!??  Don't think so. I got quoted $50-55 at other places. The girl who me quoted must be delusional or thinks I can't do simple math and reasoning and basically trying to rip me off And for that reason, I took my business elsewhere which is too bad for them because where I work, we order a lot of food for parties and we have a lot of parties; However, I work with people with integrity. So if you plan to have Filipino food catered, don't go here."}
{"text":"We're in Vegas a few times a year and we usually stick to the strip hotels and try the various buffets, but this time we wanted to try something more \"local\".  We found this place on Yelp when looking for gems in Vegas and were not disappointed.  Our wonderful experience began with great customer service - we were greeted nicely and the waiter (owner?) seemed really interested in getting to know us.  He immediately helped us feel very welcomed.  The food was fantastic - we ended up ordering too much because we saw what others were ordering and had to try what they had on their tables.  I loved the crispy para, lechon kawali, garlic fried rice, and fried bangus. My wife and kids had a good time dining here so we'll definitely coming back on our next trip out."}
{"text":"My only previous experience with Filipino food was when a co worker used to make it for the office- for two years I feasted on home made pancit at least once a week- Thank you Charo!! and I never forgot how yummy it was. For several years and through several cities- SAN Diego, Atlanta even, I have not found pancit as good as my friends home made- UNTIL NOW! So when my sister and I found this place by accident, I was so happy. And they did not disappoint! From the minute we stepped inside, we were treated like family. Because I am in poor health, my sister seated me at a table and ran back and forth taking my order and bringing me samples! One of the cooks, Mike, was on a break and struck up a conversation with me and when he heard my Pancit search story, he offered to special make me a small pancit to go so that I could have some for the next day!! AT NO CHARGE!!!! We also had the bar b Que on a stick, a sticky dessert, spinach and a beef dish with white rice.  I ate my fill and then we ordered some to take home PLUS I had Mike's Pancit- two days later I was back . I had to give it a rest for a while (I have pancreatic cancer and it messes with my appetite). But maaaan! This place is the TRUTH! Plus they are so very nice and helpful- explained all the dishes to us too!"}
{"text":"When this location first opened, this was the place to go for Filipino food in the area. The food always looked fresh and appetizing.  I've been here twice in the last month and the food looked like it was leftovers that have been reheated way too many times. Not sure how this could possibly pass any health inspection.  This used to be my go-to place for fast Filipino take out. Not anymore. A few other places have popped up in the area, and although they might be a bit pricier, I'm fine as long as the quality of the food is better."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, the problem with this restaurant is that everything is precooked.  Went for dinner around 5:30 pm and the pancit was starting to dry out and the pork skewers were so hard and dry we had to wrestle them by hand trying to get them off the skewer.  Those were the only two things we had and we were very disappointed.  This place could be a lot better if dishes were made to order and unless they change we will not go back."}
{"text":"Wow...everytime i go to Vegas i always stop by to this place. Their food is tremendous and excellent. So yummy especially their Krispy Pata and bbq. Most of all, d service is really good."}
{"text":"I was such a fan of the restaurant on Jones and used to go there everyday for lunch. My office moved and it became out of the way, that's why I was so excited once they opened this one on Rose Parkway. Everything from the Lumpia to the Halo-Halo is amazing. I love pretty much all the items on the menu so it's difficult to choose each time I go. I get the Barbecue A LOT! So Good!! We threw a retirement party there for my co-worker last month, the staff was so accommodating and made sure everything was perfect. They treat you like family if you've been there once or a hundred times. If you are looking for authentic Filipino food and fantastic service, look no further, this is the place."}
{"text":"My Mom introduced me to this place.  I had Beef Caldereta & it's the best I've ever had for a long time.  The Palabok is wonderful.   The dining area ambience is nice... great way to introduce filipino food to friends/family who have not tried it.  It's wonderful a good Filipino eatery/take-out opened near Anthem and Seven Hills area (& not have to drive up north).  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Nice decent place to enjoy Filipino food. Good provincial ambience. Great reasonably priced food. Restrooms nice and clean (very un-asian). Just hoping they would use ceramic or vinyl plates and inexpensive silverwares rather than paper plates and plastic spoons and forks to show better respect for Philippine Cuisine."}
{"text":"Tried the crispy pata, lumpia shanghai, dinuguan, chicken adobo and bbq sticks. So good!  Friendly service and affordable menu items."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a good Filipino food place since I've moved to Vegas (having refused to learn how to cook it properly myself).   This place is like a rebound SO; it won't replace your true love, but it helps ease the sting of not having them. Their food wasn't just like home cooking, but tasted close enough that I would come back.  For my first visit, I went very basic: Lumpia shanghai: Good recipe, but they need to either cook smaller batches or keep them warmer b/c lukewarm definitely decreases taste.  Sinigang beef: Nice moderate tamarind flavor that will be easily tolerated by the masses (my ideal sinigang is super sour, so I'm not going to knock points off because this one wasn't). Beef was very tender and fell right off the bones.   Turon: Same as the lumpia (need to keep these puppies warmer!). Also, would have liked to see some jackfruit mixed in to up the sweetness level.   Pancit bihon: Nice consistency to the noodles (not too soggy).   Nice ambiance inside too with the ABS-CBN blaring from a nice flatscreen. People unfamiliar w/ Filipino food beware: it's buffet style service a la Panda Express, but without the helpful placards telling you what the dishes are."}
{"text":"This place is really great compared to the other Filipino restaurants in the area. The staff is very nice an attentive. I absolutely love the \"made to go\" section as it is fast and painless especially since I am always on the go! Check out this place!"}
{"text":"The food's amazing. I got crispy pata, grilled pork ribs, beef stew, pork adobo and a cantaloupe juice drink. The people are really cool. They explained what everything was and gave me samples. Will definitely go back. A lot."}
{"text":"Got homesick in the office this afternoon, and had a real hankering for some authentic Filipino food.  Luckily for me, it's right around the corner from my work.  Walked in, and  was actually impressed by the clenliness and decoration of the establishment.  They had a great selection on the steam table, and none of the food looked like it had been there for three days.  Got the sinigang, and they make it just how I love it, sour.  Will make this a regular lunch spot for sure."}
{"text":"When I have that craving for Filipino BBQ, fried banana rolls, or ginataan, I go here and my tummy is satisfied.  Their crispy pata is worth the wait (10 min)."}
{"text":"Came here in need of some good Filipino food. It was good, good priced, very clean inside. I would 5 star but there's a big problem with having pineapples in my afritada. Almost all the meats were sweet. I personally find it disgusting that my meals taste like desserts. I had to find out which ones were not sweet meats. I almost 1 starred this place because my afritada was loaded with pineapples. Stop! First Filipino spot that does it, at least make the original one as an option. The service was great, place was super clean. Thank u for a comfy dine in experience."}
{"text":"I had a craving for Filipino food after work, so I decided to finally make a visit to Fiesta Filipina Cuisine. I have been driving past this place and I was curious to try it.   I walked in and first noticed the shelves full of baked Filipino goods. I was really tempted to pick up several packages of kutchinta (orange sticky rice flour cake) or puto (white rice cake), but I had to refocus and remind myself why I was there.  I was there for fast, to-go Filipino food. And that is what I got. I was immediately greeted by the friendly lady behind the counter and she knew what I wanted. \"Combination platter?\" Yes, please.  Out of the 12 or so dishes, I chose my usual favs: kare kare (peanut sauce stew with oxtail/beef) and sinigang (a tamarind sour soup with beef and vegetables). I also got suckered into a large piece of toron (fried banana egg roll).  The food overall was pretty good. I can't help but compare it to my mom or lola's cooking. The sinigang was the best of it all. I'd go back for that alone. I was kind of disappointed that the kare kare didn't have tripe in it, but I can't blame them keeping it out for mainstream purposes. And the toron was a little burnt, but the taste wasn't bad.  In the end, I would return here to fulfill a spontaneous Filipino craving and to purchase some of those desserts on the shelves. I also saw that they have crispy pata, which really excites me. I wanted to order it then, but I couldn't justify buying that large delicious hunk of fried crispy pork all for myself. ...or can I?"}
{"text":"Haven't ever had Filipino food but all my classmates suggested this place and when we went for lunch they ordered for me, they got me some chicken kabob, pancit and some mini egg roll things!!! The food was amazing, in fact I went back for more pancit the next day but they had sold out (it was like 6pm tho)!!!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. This place was right across the street from where I worked and I be never been here. When I first walked in it made me instantly have a smile on my face and excited because you can see all the food there. There were plenty of tables for us to sit there and eat or we could have it packed to go. There were so many choices of dishes to choose from. The workers there were very efficient and super friendly. I asked them 20 questions regarding the dishes in front of me and they were more than happy to explain and suggest.  I ordered rice with two sides, chicken curry and beef stew. Both of the dishes were a little bland for my personal taste but very flavorful so I just added a dash of there condiments. The fried banana wrapped in lumpia wrap was to die for. I will definitely come back for lunch"}
{"text":"Went here twice during my most recent Vegas trip. The staff is friendly and the place is very clean. The atmosphere is great - I love the decor.   I've noticed some reviewers saying that the food probably isn't fresh. In my two visits, I arrived in the morning for breakfast so I can't say anything about the freshness of the food throughout the day. The food was definitely good and fresh when I was there. I had pansit, garlic fried rice, longanisa, adobo, barbecue, a coconut pork dish (ugh! I'm sorry I don't know the name right now), and some fish. So unhealthy (not something Filipino food is known for so whatever!), but so yummy. Oh! And I cannot forget the delicious melon juice which is packed with melon.  There is also some self-service water and coffee. Coffee was good, but the water tasted off to me. This wasn't the only time in Vegas I tasted 'meh' water (the other times were at buffets at the Strip).."}
{"text":"We went to the other location and it was good so we were excited to have it actually on this part of town also and took a few people from the Philippines for their first try. Unfortunately, everything was bad. The lichon was rock hard, the bistek was incredibly salty, the machado bowl was literally a bone with no meat and for some reason the pork chop then they barely put any in the container.   Needless to say it was a very poor first impression for our guests and probably the worst Fiesta meal we've had. Hopefully a competitor comes around because this area needs a good Filipino restaurant."}
{"text":"When I want to satisfy my cravings in Filipino Food. I would always go to this place. Foods are really authentic. Feels like home."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!!!! Adobo was on point! Bonus points for being nxt door to our new place. And it's pretty cheap."}
{"text":"Very good food. Was recommended by a friend when I asked where they got their bbq sticks. Needless to say I will be frequenting this place to get my bbq chicken fix. The bbq chicken skewers have a lot of meat and are very good. Everybody loves them"}
{"text":"Awesome Quality Food.   Great price.  Staff was helpful and even ask if I want to sample a few things since it was our first time having Filipino food."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite fast food Filipino food. And really, just in general for that matter. I don't really do fast food too often but I will be coming back to this spot often. It's really inexpensive too, like 7 bucks I think for two items and rice. It's similar to like Panda express where most stuff is already prepared. But the flavors of what I bought were just off the hook. Been here twice, the second time I had a little accident and my tray dropped all of my stuff on the floor. I was at fault completely but there was no hesitation by the workers to replace everything I ordered without even the slightest of attitude. Honestly though, that has nothing to do with my review. The flavors of the food here are my style. Love it."}
{"text":"Very rude servers! They all look very unhappy and mad. Food is okey for the price but the customer service is horrible."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another shot and the food seems to have gotten better.. Maybe they just got a bad shipment of beef that day.. Check your supplier guys.."}
{"text":"Another great place to get filipino food in Henderson. Food is very good and the place is nice and clean. A great alternative if you're not feeling like having a buffet (from the other filipino restaurant down the street). Prices are fair and staff is friendly. But the dish to get here is the CRISPY PATA! (Deep Fried Pork Hock--it may sound unappetizing, but don't knock it until you try it) If you need to get your pata fix, this is the place."}
{"text":"This is my go to place if I'm craving Filipino food. Quick easy & reasonably priced. Friendly service too. Dont go very late as there's not much to choose from."}
{"text":"Great filipino food. Their krispy pata is definitely the best in town. Everything else i've ever had has been top quality."}
{"text":"I dont often have Filipino food because my mom lives in California. It's the only time I really have filipino food. But now I have found Fiesta Filipina. Our favorite is the lechon manok and that is to die for! I am a comfort food kind of girl so I always pick your quintessential filipino dishes... such as mongo, on a cold day this is the best over a plate of hot rice. Their palabok is good too. Their lumpia is also pretty good. On a summery day or if you just want to quench your thirst their Melon juice is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Filipino cuisine in a very fair price. However this is a turo-turo style restaurant. You eat with styrofoam dishes and plastic forks."}
{"text":"They answer the phone, then set it down and let you hear them taking other peoples orders for 15 minutes..."}
{"text":"I only put 1 stars because the server was so rude. He was in a hurry to go somewhere I suppose? I arrived around 2pm. I ordered pork and chicken bbq sticks. NOT enough flavor, and they were COLD. Which mean the warmers that they are using are not hot enough to keep the food at the correct temperature. I was going to purchase some sweet bread, but they looked old and the bread was already hard. So why sell something that's old? I would be so embarrass if I was the owner of this restaurant. You represent Filipino cuisine in Henderson...take pride in your business. Perhaps then more then 4 people will be eating in your restaurant and you wouldn't have so much leftovers to reheat and serve again....Needless to say, I will NOT be back, nor would dare take a friend or family member here to eat. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with our order for take out yesterday.  A half a tray of miki-bihon pansit and two crispy pata.  The pansit had uncooked noodles which we were surprised since we've had this before with no issue.  The crispy pata was so hard it looked like it was reheated/or fried twice (previously fried and reheated for our order).  We've always come here and order party trays, but for us, now it's a waste since the quality of the food is not the same.  It's too bad since we've enjoyed the food before....."}
{"text":"Yelp indicated this restaurant opens at 08:00. The hours are actually 10:00-20:30. The restaurant looks nice and inviting. The decor made me feel like I'm in my province with the exception of loud TV.   I got here around 09:30 hoping to get breakfast, tapsilog, bansilog, tucinolog, etc. apparently they don't serve breakfast and only what's in the turo-turo table. I ended up having milkfish and beefsteak. I've had better milkfish. The milkfish at Chowking is better compared to this one. The dipping sauce they have me was not typical spiced vinegar. It's more like sweetened-soy-sauce-vinegar combination. It's almost like finadene (Chamorro dipping sauce). They have the typical patis, soy-sauce, and vinegar. Venegar was plain. I usually like vinegar with chopped garlic, black pepper, a bit of onion, and salt.   I agree with the other reviews about the rice, it didn't seem like a typical Jasmine rice. I think it might be from old crop boxed rice. The beefsteak was good. It exceeded my expectations. The other selections from the turo-turo looks pretty good. I guess I'll try them next time to see if their tasty.   Next time, if I want tapsilog I'd go to Chowking. I will come back to this restaurant to try the other selections. My overall rating of the food is medium/average since I wasn't impressed with the milkfish and rice but, above average beefsteak."}
{"text":"I love this place. Always my go to when craving my countrys food! One of my familys fav quick service restaurants."}
{"text":"Your typical Filipino restaurant. Nothing too special about it. It is obvious that they serve left overs from the previous day. Maybe if they didn't serve them in such big batches, they wouldn't have to. The place itself is pretty big for a Filipino restaurant. Probably the biggest I've been in here in Vegas. For my first visit, I tried their dinuguan and lechon kawali. The dinuguan had hair in it. And the lechon kawali was very cold. I also tried their cantaloupe juice which was way too sweet. I wanted to add water but they only had water with lemons in it. I don't think it would have been a good idea to mix it with my juice. I was craving some pickled peppers when I went there as it normally compliments filipino food but they didn't have any at the time although I'm not sure if this is something that they normally serve. Anyways you're probably better off going to an AYCE Filipino buffet such as Nanay Glorias or Kusina ni Lorraine as this place is pretty pricey for their low quality food."}
{"text":"Another new Filipino restaurant on the SW side of town. It's right behind the Chase Bank on Durango and Warm Springs. You can't miss it. Just look for colorful flags.  Since its new, everything is clean. I love clean restaurants! Once you walk in there's a sign that has you walk to the right and you will she a variety of Filipino dishes. They are best know for their BBQ sticks. I love their pork BBQ sticks but since then trying to cut down on my pork consumption and eat more chicken.  If your hungry expect to pay more for more food because portions are a little on the small side.   I got the usual rice with chicken BBQ stick. I got the combo which only came with two sticks of BBQ. Each stick counts as one item.   The other item was pinakbet. I love veggies! I just didn't like that there wasn't enough greens. They loaded it with a bunch of eggplants and squash.   Overall, it's ok if your craving for Filipino food."}
{"text":"Fiesta Filipina is another good Filipino restaurant gone bad.  I was in love with this place when it first opened!  Everything about this restaurant was legit, from the theme, food and decor. Not baduy, or bakya at all, looking classy with all the Filipino paintings/decor. After more trips, and a few months later it went down the same horrible path as other Filipino restaurants.  Shit service and a shittier smell.   The service is always good, unless you get the female worker.   Beware of the female worker!!!  Trust, she is not hard to spot.  She's the cashier queen.  -Tore up from the floor up -Caked up face thicker than the earths crust. -The most vibrant, electric, blinding eyeshadow.   Whenever she takes our order, or rings us up she always rushes.  Rushing leads to confusion, confusion leads to pissed off customers and bad reviews.  She kept on saying \"extra charge for credit,  so i give turon .50 cents, .50 cents!!\" In her mind that means, I'll say the charge is .50 cents, but its really a few bucks, and I wont give you any turon- ___-     I felt raped, robbed and broke after leaving the restaurant.  The food was shit too.   -Barbecue is good. But  DONT use the same brush you use to baste raw meat, to baste the cooked ones too :) Big mistake and health hazard.   -Carioka was hard, tough to chew and over priced.  -Ukoy was (excuse my language) the worst fucking shit ever. Honestly, do yourselves a favor and never make it again.  Paste is what it is, thick pasty batter that was slightly fried.  -Puto was pasty, and a few were rotten, before the sell by or expire date.  I guess if you need a Filipino food fix, come to this place early, and stick to simple dishes."}
{"text":"We had a pot luck @ work the other night for a girl transferring to a different campus. My co-worker Elrod brought in a pan of chicken skewers & had sent me a text after he left early telling me to make sure I grabbed some. So I went back to the break room right away to grab some & ended up taking a bit before I wrapped some up.......OMG!!! Best chicken ever!! I texted Elrod right away & asked him \"where did you get the chicken from?\" he replied \"I made them.\" Now this I knew wasn't true, he doesn't cook! lol He ended up telling me about this place, that this is where he got the chicken & the location. I was super excited when I learned how close to home it is.   So one day after running errands & building up an appetite I decided to stop by here & grab something for dinner. I walked in to find this place kinda set up like a buffet except the pans with the food are behind the glass counter & they serve you. I found the chicken right away & was greeted by a nice guy names Josh ( I believe?). I told him I've never been there before & he actually grabbed me a few samples of their dishes to let me try. Not to bad. But I was there to purchase some chicken but was glad I was able to try other dishes for a future visit.   Only thing I have to say that's not great is their prices. They are kinda over priced/expensive & some dishes are too small. I could of gotten a side of white rice & only 1 chicken skewer that has apx. 4 pieces of chicken on it as a dish. I wanted more then 1 chicken skewer & I didn't need the rice so I was able to buy them individually for apx. $3-4 per one. I ended up getting 6 due to sharing them with a friend, found some rice balls on my way towards the cash register that they said taste like donuts. They weren't too bad. Once I was home & was ready to eat one I wasn't sure if I was suppose to heat them up or eat them @ room temperature???? So I ate them @ room temp. They were tasty, though they did kinda have a burnt taste to them due to some type of sauce on the outside & I did get a slight taste of coconut, which is not one of my favorite taste. I also picked up a side of some type of bread that had a bean filling. OMG these were very sweet & yummy! My total came to apx. $25.00. Yikes!! $$$$$  I definitely will go back but this will not be a place I will frequent a lot due to their high prices. Unfortunately due to their prices I rated it a 3/5. :-("}
{"text":"Over- priced for filipino food.  $17 for crispy pata, $2 for a BBQ stick."}
{"text":"Made to order pancit palabok is excellent. Lumpia is excellent. Pancit is excellent.  Wish they had a better selection of vegetable dishes. Love Filipino bbq sticks but dont care much for their marinade. Its too red saucy which i guess is ketchup or banana ketchup. Wish they would adjust it and do without it. Service is very friendly except for this one person who never smiles. Place is pretty clean."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious, but why do I end up paying so much? Not sure. A lot of places will wait until you're done ordering then combine everything in to combos to get the most bang for your buck. I feel like maybe that isn't done here. There are just so many places we can go for Filipino food and pay half as much, for the same quality of food. What most places don't have is the BBQ sticks at Fiesta's quality, they are definitely what keeps me going back. Food is fresh, service is decent, but my wallet no likey."}
{"text":"Better service at this location than any other one I've been too. Everyone working here was super nice and quick. I've been dieting for about a month so haven't had any Filipino food. I just got some pancit and a chicken BBQ stick (because their BBQ sticks are BOMB). It was a very large serving on pancit, and I couldn't eat much of it. My tummy just isn't used to all the grease anymore. When I moved the pancit to a to go box, there was so much grease leftover on my plate. That's the only reason I knocked down a star.. So much grease isn't necessary for a delicious pancit! But it tasted good anyway. My auntie wasn't happy with the taste in the diniguan that day, so she requested to switch it out for beef steak and they happily obliged and apologized that it wasn't to her liking."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! Be honest guys when asked about a status of the delivery, say it's not done on time or will be delayed instead of lying! Do we have to wait for nothing while all the visitors are starving? We paid for the delivery, we ordered so many, gave you my phone numbers, why not make a phone call instead of us calling you 3 times and you said it is \"probably\" on the way to find out after few hours late, food are still sitting in the restaurant. I was not happy with the service and the quality of food as well, seems like going downhill! We ended up picking up the foods, what a hassle!!"}
{"text":"I'm from Cali here on vacay, heard about this place from some friends who live out here. Jon greeted us the second we walked thru the door and the staff was very quick, professional, and happy! The food was hands-down one of the best I've had in a long time and the place was cute and clean. The BBQ chicken, taro leaves, cantelope juice, and halo halo were my favs!!! One of the employees even stopped by our table to ask how our food was and if we needed anything. I will def b stopping by here every time I'm in town!!! Def a must GO!"}
{"text":"I have been to Fiesta Filipina Cuisine a few times and enjoy it each time I go. They usually switch up some of the foods they make, but they always have the main Filipino dishes like adobo, pancit and lumpia. They make this really good melon juice with fresh juice, shaved ice, and sugar. It is mainly what I come to this restaurant for! They are always very nice, and the inside is decorated nice with TFC playing in the background. I definitely get a Filipino vibe when I'm here.   The only reason I couldn't give this restaurant five stars is because the amount of oil they use in their dishes. Their corn beef hash has so much oil I have to let it pour out of my spoon before I eat it. Every dish has a ton of oil in it. I don't feel that they need that much oil to cook these dishes either! They would taste just as good without the excess oil!  Overall it is a must try if you live in the area. It is a great place to try several Filipino dishes, if you are new to Filipino food."}
{"text":"Delicious food with so much to choose from. One of the best in town even my mom who's Filipino agrees."}
{"text":"Very good food, taste great, large variety. And affordable.  Just a bit hot in there, need ac.  I recommend this place if you're looking for comfort food.  This is not a restaurant type of place, but restaurant quality taste, food are already cooked and displayed.   Definitely bookmarked this place for next time I come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for several years now. It's your typical Filipino restaurant with all the menu options you find at other places which makes it mediocre. My family owns a Filipino restaurant and a mini grocery store in New Jersey. So, I know how much work owning a restaurant is like.  Anyway, for me Fiesta Filipina is hit or miss. I usually order food I don't normally make at home. Food are sometimes too salty and other days they are perfectly seasoned. Some of the dishes are floating with grease than others. It would be nice if they can filter out the fats/oil.   I ordered the 2 combo with bikol express and the caldereta. The bikol express didn't taste the same when I was here the last time. I was disappointed because that's one of my favorite entree. Anything mixed in with coconut milk I am likely to order. I ordered the caldereta and it wasn't too salty and it has a great tomato base flavor with great garnish peppers and olives. I prefer my meat cut a little thinner rather than serving it as thick chunks, but the meat is always tender.   Overall, this is one of the many places around town I would rather go to eat Filipino food. I just wish they can be more consistent in how their food actually taste. I can see how non Filipino diners will be confused when they are not accustomed to the cuisine. However, the lumpia shanghai and pancit are always great! I dine here quite often because it's between my 2 job locations when I miss eating Filipino dishes."}
{"text":"This was the last place I went with my family on my Vegas visit and it was perfect cause I needed some good Filipino food in my life.  I got more than what I bargained for cause when I walked in the door I got hit with the full-on Filipino experience. It brought me back to when I was a kid, getting out of the family minivan, sauntering up to an auntie's (who's not blood related) house. The air was a mix of a cozy home and heartful home-cooked meals. And of course, TFC was playing, like a soundtrack to the merienda we were about to have.  Merienda, the light meal, was palabok. It was pretty good but it could've been saucier in my taste. I was still feeling full from the earlier meal but I kept on going. We took home some kare-kare and barbecue skewers to go and boy, they came through on those!  Kare-kare was peanutty enough and the meat was plentiful. Barbecue skewers weren't too fatty and weren't tough to bite through. Seems like this place is the fams' go-to when they don't want to cook... And when I visit again, I hope we can come back here for a quick, home-cooked meal."}
{"text":"Service improved and cleanliness maintained.  Variety of food to choose from.  Price is just right for a 2 entry combo.  I like their kare kare and dinuguan, just a few to mention that it takes time to make at home."}
{"text":"This one star review was for the customer service. The wifey and I came in for a quick breakfast and grab some lunch to go. The food server, Geraldine, was the one who was attending to us. Quiet frankly she was rude during the ordering process. She was sarcastically rude to the wifey, and we felt rush throughout our ordering. She tried to pass us off to a different server because she said had \"something\" else to do, hence the rushing. Honestly, if your having a bad day or have \"something\" to do, do not take it out on the customers. Stay your ass home then."}
{"text":"I had a recommendation from a work colleague and stopped by after work this evening. Super polite staff - big shout out to Alma who was super knowledgeable and helpful. The food recommended based on what I wanted to try was great and I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"A friend to our staff here for lunch and there was so much to choose from. Be prepared to have a difficult time making your choices. The price was reasonable, especially if someone else is paying. Gave it 3-stars as it seemed a bit unclean. May have to return and try it again."}
{"text":"Just left from there. Was very disappointed. Went in a little bit after 8:00pm ordered my food the guy bagged my food and rang me up. I ordered 2 combination the total was probably around 15$ handed the guy a 100$ bill he marked the bill 4X handed over the bill to probably the old ass b.... owner or whoever the f... she was they spoke in there native tongue.. she continues to check the 100$ bill out.. asked me if I had anything smaller?? No I didn't if I did I would have given it to you. She tells me sorry we can't accept it we just cashed our drawer out. Left there with no food and my business. Will never step foot in a horrible business. Will make sure I tell everyone. I wished they had less than 1 star"}
{"text":"If zero stars was an option I would do it.  Being Filipino you expect Filipinos to treat you the same way. Respectful and welcome you with open arms. This location has the LAZIEST staff members in the world. They also have poor attitudes. I have never been so disrespected by a fellow Filipino until coming here. The girl who's usually the cashier has the worst attitude of all.  Does smile, hands over change in a rude way, and no thank you is said. Seriously?!  On top of that the Filipino food isn't even great and it's below temperature. I've gone to some dirty Filipino restaurants here in Vegas and not only do they serve better tasting food but they have the true Filipino attitude of being respectful and humble. They tend to have a wait for white rice some times and even then the white rice is super wet and not even worth eating. The BBQ is super hard and mostly fat and most dishes are drowning in oil.  Also don't order from their catering menu. They always mess it up and they never have enough food to meet the demand.  If they can't meet the demand they they'll call you late in the day to only tell you that they ran out. Utter BS.   This location isn't even worth being called a Filipino restaurant. Don't bother even coming here!"}
{"text":"BAD customer service, very Unfriendly!! the workers at this restaurant are the worst people I ever seen in the restaurant business. They are arrogant , Over priced food, small portion!!!!!! I would never ever go back to this place'"}
{"text":"So this was my first visit and sadly this place is typical of most Filipino restaurants. Slow service, unattractive workers and semi-good food. The food looked somewhat fresh except for the kawali, which I came for. I ended up buying other items that I didn't intend to because of that. I will say that their prices are decent and to my surprise so was the food.  The attendants were gossiping and talking trash to each other while getting my food together. I hate this! Stop yaking and putting saliva on the food!  If this place could learn to be more attentive, make the food more appealing and shut up I would go back."}
{"text":"Nice people, small but dining area was clean. There are some cooked to order items but it's mainly food served up from heating trays, not sure how long it's been sitting out  either.    Got 3 items off the buffet sat down to eat, took a bite of pancit and it tasted a little off like noodles were spoiled, it smelled that way too. Ended up  throwing away my meal and walking out . I don't think I'll  be back..eww no."}
{"text":"Loved the food & waitress was very nice. The lechon & the bangus was delicious ! The service & ambiance was lovely!! If your looking to enjoy some Filipino food this is a nice place to eat."}
{"text":"Crispy Pata's a hit or miss. But on a good day, it's the best Ive ever tasted. The previous one's were overcooked almost burnt. Overall it's super good!"}
{"text":"Only had takeout that my friend would bring over, but never stopped in here.  Very chilly inside that night, not sure why the a/c was running so high, but when my friend finally showed up, the other dining area was blocked off with chairs and we couldn't sit there.  FF is like a Filipino Panda Express, where you point and choose.  The Laing (taro leaf, coconut milk, meat) was nicely done with a spicy kick.  Not sure what my other dish was, but it was a tasty combination of onions, pimentos, green olives, beef braised in a tomato-based sauce.  The requisite steamed rice was hot and fresh, the pancit passable.  Reason for two stars? If I hadn't been starving, I probably would have walked in and walked right back out. The place REALLY needs a good cleaning--people, just close for a day and freaking declutter and steam clean the whole place!!"}
{"text":"For a very casual dining restaurant this place is good. This is not sit down,order off the menu place ( as are most Filipino restaurants in the valley), but more of you order a combo plate.   I usually come here just to order to go. My family has eaten inside as well and we do enjoy it. The atmosphere is casual and the place is clean.   They always have a pretty good variety of food. My husband (who isn't filipino) doesn't mind coming here at all since they always have BBQ."}
{"text":"Best crispy pata here hands down, out of the 3 FF branches. They serve authentic Filipino food. Clean restaurant area, clean restrooms. Above average dishes! They have two more locations. One in henderson and one in west side durango but this location is the best of the three in terms of flavor."}
{"text":"Got here at lunch at first it wasn't that busy, everything was smooth, service was ok at first when they handed our food but when we reach and we had to pay and started getting busy the cashier was so rude.. We definitely not coming back they just ruin our lunch after we experience that."}
{"text":"Being Filipino, I can't live without my rice and \"ulam\" (main course)... so for those days that I want to reminisce about my lola's \"kaldereta\" or some great \"sinigang', I will go to Fiesta Filipina.  When you first walk in you glance at the TV and hear the \"TFC\" channel playing in the background... it has a great \"\"homely\" feel with bamboo-style decor.    This place is awesome when you are super hungry and are craving rice, and don't want to wait for your food to come.  It is \"buffet\" style behind the counter, meaning you point and pick what you want.  They always have a stack of barbecue sticks waiting for you.  But if you like, they also have dishes you can have made to order, like \"palabok\".  Awesome place to go and pick up food if you have relatives or friends in town and don't feel like cooking. ;)  You can order a la carte, or by combo; prices are affordable and reasonable, and the food is really good here.  So overall, 4 stars! =)"}
{"text":"We absolutely love the food here. Every selection is awesome. The BBQ pork, empenadas and fried banana desert are the bomb"}
{"text":"Noticed this on the way home from 168 Market, located down North and across the street. Place was decorated with native style furniture and bamboo accents. Typical Filipino Buffet style entrees. They got a good selection of tradtional Filipino eats and fairly priced combos/to go containers..  Sinigang na pork (soup/stew with vegetables and pork):  Good amount of pork with just the right amount of sour and salty broth flavor that's so heart-warming!  Caldereta (beef stew based on tomato sauce): Tender and Tasty pieces of Beef with its Succulent sauce makes for a Very Successful rendition of this dish!   Beef Steak (stir fried / boiled beef slices and onions): Explosive Flavors of garlic, lemon/ycitrusy sweet and soy sauce infused within the thin fall apart beef slices and sauteed onions. Extremely Tasty!  Crispy Pata (deep fried pig): How could this not taste good.. Crunchy, Chewy and Porky! Dip it in the soy/vinegar sauce and Enjoy!  2 Thumbs Up!! Pretty Good Filipino Restaurant!"}
{"text":"The portions were huge, the food was delicious, and the prices were cheap. There were only two people working behind the counter, but we came in rather early so service moved quickly. The employees were super nice about letting us sample the food before we made our decisions, as it was our first time really having Filipino food. We tried chicken adobo and the other meat adobo (maybe it was beef?) in addition to the pork belly and pork BBQ skewers. Our plates were HEAPED with food, definitely enough for 2 meals if not more, and it was only $10 each.  My only complaint is that the soy sauce contained wheat, which admittedly is always kind of a toss up at Asian restaurants, but I still enjoyed my food before my allergies kicked in. The place was very clean and spacious. Most people seemed to get the food to go, so even when the crowds picked up a bit later, there were still only a couple tables occupied.   I would definitely recommend Fiesta Filipina, especially for take out for a large family."}
{"text":"If you are still wondering whether Knorr cubes has msg or not, then try eating in this cafeteria-style restaurant i.e. you queue up and point the food on the tray you want to be served.  I can make an argument that there's a VERY good reason the food here is tasty and appetizing, and that's because they uses a \"secret\" flavor-enhancer (hint it is not Knorr but very similar). I found that out while waiting for my turn and watching the server pour that magic dust to the dish. Congratulations in advance if you really like the food here, because I'm telling you you will keep coming back."}
{"text":"I've never had Filipino food, and once we walked in to the basic menu and tons of unlabeled food on display, BF confessed it had been years and he had no idea what to order. Which of course just means that we ordered nearly everything: two of their two-meat plates with rice, and a bunch of other added-on take out containers of sauces and stews, plus this and that from their appetizers and desserts section, and we were out the door with a gigantic bag of food for  $25.   I have only a vague idea of what each item was, but it was ALL delicious! The pork adobo and a beef stew dish were probably my favorites, the crispy pata was too indulgent for me, the lumpia were downright sinful and had surprisingly little grease, the grilled skewers of chicken and beef were both very flavorful and not overly charred or burned, and the fried intestines were super salty for my tastes- but BF loved everything that I had the slightest hesitation about. There was a vegetable and shrimp crispy pancake thing that was just alright to me, but BF raved about, and I felt that way about the dessert we had- a skewer of round balls that looked like donut holes, had a chewy center, and a slight maple-syrup-like aftertaste.  Not only did we pig out, but there were lots of leftovers. Knowing what we like here now will likely make future trips much cheaper- two 2-meat plates with rice for under $11 is amazing pricing for the portions given here."}
{"text":"Don't even go here. Spend your money somewhere else!!! What a waste of my money. The food was not tasty at all. Anyone can cook better. Service was terrible. The workers don't even smile or say hi or thank you. Avoid this place!!!"}
{"text":"Compare to neighboring filipino restaurant weve been to during our Vegas vacation, this restaurant is better than other. I like their turon and egg pie and also the the carioca. Their food are also delicious. There are alot of options. Its a very clean restaurant. Even their restroom was very clean. Im.glad to find this restaurant wjen i was craving for filipino food. The only thing we dont like is theDinuguan is a bit salty.  I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've decided to take out my lunch after shopping at Homegoods across the same parking lot. So many choices to choose from. The Pata is done to perfection....tender on the inside and skin crisp to perfection. The lichon is so delicious, I took home and dipped with a garlic chili sauce just like we eat Chinese roast pork. The fried banana lumpia was still warm and has a nice caramelized skin. It didn't made it home as I devoured it on my drive home!"}
{"text":"If you want masarap na Filipino food then you need to go to Fiesta Filipina.  From the  barbecue to the pansit to the crispy pata, everything here tastes really good.  It also helps that the staff is always warm and welcoming, you are treated like family.  We go to Fiesta Filipina at least once a week and the food is consistently great tasting."}
{"text":"Their food is good. I bought 3 combos and and some extra side and They charged me separate for everything. Not cool .  I always eat at the fiesta in Henderson and as much as we buy food there I never come out Paying almost 100.00. Not coming back. Horrible customer service from the same guy"}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch and it was ok. This place for me is usually a four but today when I went to the back section to eat where I usually do, every table but one was not wiped down. Hopefully next time I come back it won't be like that"}
{"text":"Been there two times. First time was the bomb, younger guy heck of nice.  2nd time not so great younger gal kind of rude. Food is great but need to work on customer service. :("}
{"text":"I love to try different cuisines of food. My buddy Andrew is Filipino, and told me this place is authentic and delicious. We planned to hang out one night after work, so he offered to pick up some food for us. I have only ever tried lumpia so I told him to get whatever. For a 2 item combo, depending what you get, it is like $6-7 and comes with white rice. We both had combos, and then he ordered lumpia and pancit! There was so. much. food. He came home with:  Lumpia shanghai Pancit Pork Adobo Beefsteak Bbq chicken skewer  Beef stew (this has a proper name but I don't know what it is)  My favorite things were the lumpia and the bbq chicken skewers. The lumpia are bite sized, and come with a tasty sweet chili dipping sauce. They are seriously sooo delicious I couldn't stop popping them into my mouth. The bbq chicken was really good too. You get 2 skewers of chicken that is marinated in 7-up and other spices and seasonings  I did not care for the beefsteak. It was very gelatinous and there were chunks of fat swimming around in the bowl. I did like the pancit, which is similar to chow mein but has a much different flavor. I was soooo full after all that food and went into a food coma for about 4 hours. The price was amazing too! He got all that food for around $25 and we had plenty of leftovers.  I was really looking forward to trying the crispy pata, but they were all out. I also want to try the Halo Halo which is like a sweet shaved iced, and turon, which is a sweet lumpia roll. As Arnold says, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Pretty good Filipino food. They have a good variety of dishes. I recently had the Kare Kare and was in looooooove. Also, I hadn't eaten Filipino food in a while so I guess I was overdue.  The only gripe I have about this place is that sometimes service can be a bit slow especially with the way the assembly line is set up. Also, there is a 50 cent charge on credit cards for purchases under $10.  All in all, I would come back. It's in a good location off Warm Springs and Durango right behind the Walgreens. And the staff gave me a free turon one time. Who doesn't love free turon?"}
{"text":"I work right next door to this place, I gotta tell yah my dislikes are the fact that they are tooooo pricey for filipino food.  lower your cost people.  I do love your halo-halo and chicharron bulaklak though."}
{"text":"OMG!!!! Love this place! Lumpia is made perfect and the Jersey is amazing. Also the staff is very friendly and reliable. I have tried numerous places around town and this one seems to be the best, plus I can walk to it."}
{"text":"Having been to the Philippines working on U.S. Military projects, I was used to ethnic Filipino cuisines while I was there decades ago.  I came to know that an old professional colleague of mine is now a Las Vegas resident and was quite surprised to received my unexpected call. With his directions, we eventually met at this Filipino restaurant for a quick lunch, for I intended to be driving back to LA afterwards that day.  However, the quick lunch turned out into a seemingly endless feast of Filipino cuisines and delicacies, as we talked about old times, the best of times, as well as the worst ones in the Philippines and in various countries we've been while deployed overseas.  I was glad I relented coming to Fiesta Filipina, instead of insisting for my friend to come over for buffet at the restaurant in my hotel.  Incidentally, the word \"Fiesta\" in Filipino language means feast, and that was really a sumptuous feast we had.  The next time I'll be in Vegas, I'll definitely come by this place near the southeast corner of Jones and Desert Inn.  And indeed, just like aged fine wines, old time friends are certainly considered the best."}
{"text":"Was super excited about this new Filipino spot by my house. Was in awe of the wide variety of choices they offered. Frequent this place often. Unfortunately, the service offered here is far below acceptable. Sadly, we have experienced the same lack of customer service each time. Other than that, the food is still good."}
{"text":"I grew up Filipino...or at least I tried to.  For $6 for a one scoop rice and 2 choice of items, it's pretty cheap. I had quite a few items from here before. Dinuguan, longanisa, kaldereta, and bistek. I would not get these again, why? It's so damn oily! Seriously, you can see the oil on top of it. Gross. I remember my parents making this kind of food for dinner and it wasn't oily at all.  I also had the pancit palabok and pancit guisado. Ehhh...it was just dry as if it was sitting waiting to be eaten since they've open.  Bottom line: aight Filipino food. I wouldn't come back here unless if I was desperate to get high blood pressure."}
{"text":"First off all I have to say thanks to Ellen F, a fellow yelper who introduce me to this establishment.    The restaurant it self is laid out like a buffet style eaterie were you point to  what you want and pay, so service will depend on how many people are in line. But they do also have other selections of food that is cook to order only.  My final thought is that this place brings back memories of living in the Philippines."}
{"text":"First time to eat here .im not fun of Filipino Cuisine since there's lots of different  food n places to go . But I need to  give this place credit as you walk in it's very clean you'll see the trays of food in the warmers very fresh n appetizing . Prizes reasonable ,portions good  amount to have. Definitely will recommend this place to friends looking for Filipino Cuisine. Try their Chicken BBQ , quinataan Lanka for 6.99 great food for the prize ."}
{"text":"This was my first experience eating Filipino food.  I found the staff to be very helpful and were happy to describe various dishes to me.  The food ended up being delicious and was very reasonably priced.  I will go back soon."}
{"text":"This place is an amazing place to get your Filipino fix.  They have great kari kari, and caldereta.  The huge heaps of rice are appreciated but certainly not necessary.  They also have a small selection of baked goods at the front.  I personally do not care for this brand of pandesal but the kutsinta was pretty good.  If you like filipino food, or are just looking for something different try this place.  They are super friendly, and will explain what each dish is"}
{"text":"Food not as good as it used to be, and food is not kept at the appropriate temperatures. I would stay away and try another restaurant."}
{"text":"Filipino food always sounds good to me and I don't always feel up to cook. My bf chose this place nearby, I was hesitant.  Lots of people in and out. This was a good sign. Walking in I was reminded of back home with family, comfortable smell of Filipino food. It was pretty busy. You line up and choose the items you'd like before you pay and take your food to sit down and eat. I wanted a little bit of everything.  I chose Fried Bangus (milkfish) around $11. I had that with rice and a small order of lumpia shanghai (7 pieces). They have a table with all of the necessary condiments available from banana ketchup, vinegar, fish sauce to name a few. Everything I needed was there. Overall the food was average, but satisfying.  The lumpia wasn't really crispy.  I drank calamansi juice just because it isn't something I have everyday.  It was good, a little sweet.  My boyfriend and I felt comfortable and cozy watching The Filipino Channel playing on one of their many tvs. Luckily there was English subtitles (why didn't I use subtitles as a kid?). This was great because I am Americanized and my boyfriend is Vietnamese so we both needed the translation.  We enjoyed the drama that was playing on TV.  Before leaving we ordered halo halo.  It was wonderful!   The ube(taro) ice cream, the wafer it was a good finish to my meal.  Would come back."}
{"text":"Turon was good. Their paksiw na Isda?  Oh my gosh, was that sweet-sour-salty Isda?  Couldn't understand why they used the recipe for paksiw na pata for the fish. Their chicken BBQ sticks lacked taste. The pinakbet veggies were so-so. The veggies were super half cooked to the point of uncooked. Wouldn't go back there. :("}
{"text":"Ok so my hubby decided to eat out for dinner tonight as the food he was cooking would not be ready for quite some time and we were both hungry.  Since our last visit to a filipino restaurant was lacking the flavors he is used to he wanted to go to Fiesta for a redemption on the steak and onions that he last had at another filipino restaurant.  The following is what we ordered:  Steak and Onions: The steak was thinly cut and tender while the onions  freshly laid on top.  Some of the onions had been marinating in the sauce so it was a tad soggy.  The sauce was just right and exactly how he liked it.  Lechon: small a la carte is enough to feed two people so it was a good sized portion for both of us.  Some pieces were a little too well done as it had a burnt taste.  Pork Adobo:  Now this was one oily, greasy dish!  The server put so much oil with the pork that looking at it made me nauseas.  Beef Calderetta (sp?): This is always my favorite and tonight was no different.  The beef was tender and fell apart to the touch.  The potatoes, carrots and red bell peppers were also just right as they hadn't been sitting there for too long.  Turon: overly sweet.  Seemed like it had been soaking in sugar and then fried.  The wrapper was covered in carmelized sugar.  I've had turon before and a good turon does NOT need to be drenched in sugar...my 4 year old liked it...maybe because he thought it was candy.  Overall our experience here is average.  The service is so so.  Wish they would give more rice as it seems their scoop is extra small...and you know you need rice with every filipino dish!  Will definitey be going back there again."}
{"text":"Took my fam from Utah here bc they were missing some Filipino food- and they LOVED it! The BBQ skewers, lumpia, calderetta, and chocolate baboy were all delicious! We even had 2 Halo Halo that everyone fought over! Ha!"}
{"text":"Filipino food super close to my house in Henderson... shooooooot.  i even took my boy from manilla here, and we went nuts on some pretty good pinoy grub.  the GRUB: - chicken adobo... salty, soury, peppery chicken stew... a good version of a very philippine food staple... mix the sauce in your rice with a little patis for the real deal. - chicken bbq stick... red like tocino or char siu sauce, sweet and charred over fire... very tasty - they dont have Sisig on the line up ever (because you have to order it in advanced only) but they do have lechon kawali - fried pork belly - which is pretty dang awesome with hot white rice and mang thomas sauce - lumpia (shanghai) was standard fare - dip in the spicy jufran for a kick - my friend ordered chicharon bulaklak and mung-go beans... and said it reminded him so much of home... it was that good - HIGHLIGHT: CRISPY PATA !!! nothing like the picture on the wall... made to order (done in like 5 mins) - but a deliciously deep fried pig hip with crispy chicharon skin, soft roasted-like pork meat on the inside, and on the bone w tendon attatched for extra eats - so much flavor... it is accompanied with a house dipping sauce of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic and hot chilis... so awesome. - turon (banana fritter), babinka especial (rice cake with cream cheese), leche flan (caramel custard), halo halo (filipino shaved ice and ice cream sundae), and calimansi or ube or mango shake... all yummy choices for dessert - they have canned soda only (booooooo!!!) - but at least they have sarsi soda... or the fresh cantaloupe juice drink.  the JOINT: - best comment from my manilla friend: \"ferds, this might be the cleanest pilipino restaurant ive been to here in the states... actually, anywhere for that matter.\" - plenty of seating, plenty of light - very filipino decor... including a small seating section that looks like a backyard (barrio) fiesta / straw islander hut / hawaiian lanai - there should be alot of available parking in the strip mall - 3 46\" LCDs - usually showing TFC, but i have seen sports on too - like the NFL playoffs (49ers) or NBA games (Lakers)  the SQUEEZE: - about $9 for the combo and the drink - $14 for the crispy pata - but i think it feeds a family of 4 - ha! - everyone if very helpful and friendly - cash and card is accepted  FINAL SAY: for Henderson, especially right off of Eastern and St Rose Pkway... this is a great find... and probably a good place to meet single pinay nurses on lunch break from the Hospital across the street. ha!"}
{"text":"Beef Kaldereta: 2/5.  Other than beef, the only other ingredient they used was carrots.  How about some peas or green/red peppers?  Milk fish with vegetables:  4/5.  They had a good mix of ingredients, which blended well and made the fish taste pretty good.  Lumpia Shanghai:  3/5.  I doubt their lumpia shanghai is homemade.  You can go to Chinatown and fry up your own (usually around $10 for 30 pieces) and it'll taste just as good.  Chicharon Bulaklak (pork ruffle fat) : 4/5.  I love this appetizer.  Unfortunately, they don't always have it.  Summary:  Fiesta Filipina is a decent option if you're in the area and  starving for filipino food."}
{"text":"Glad they have brown rice! Clean place, nice staff and good service. Great atmosphere and delicious food. Will be back!"}
{"text":"My wife is Filipina, but I'm not a huge fan of Filipino food. I usually only like the Filipino food she cooks. However, I have to say that I really liked my food from Fiesta Filipina. My wife got pancit with BBQ and I got a two item combo. She sent me off to get it. I think I was the only non-Filipino there. I didn't recognize all of the items, so I had to point at things and ask what they were. I decided on banana leaves in coconut milk and kind of like a pork stew. I also got us fresh melon juice and some garlic peanuts.  Everything was very good. I have been to many Filipino restaurants with my wife, and this is hands down my favorite. The prices are very reasonable too. My wife is glad that I have found a Filipino restaurant I actually want to go back to."}
{"text":"Avg filipino fast food. I grew up eating real filipino so the food is ok when u want something really quick and you dont want to cook urself"}
{"text":"It's not awful and it's not jaw dropping amazing, but if you're in the mood for some Filipino food that you would rather not cook yourself, then this is the place to be!   The set up is nice and so are the four TV's to watch basketball! Heehee   Their pancit palabok was my favorite and their crispy pata was pretty darn good. The turon, for $1, seemed too overpriced for something that tasted ehhh and withOUT jackfruit. The saba con yellow's bananas tasted old, as if it had been stored for awhile. Their manga tasted watery, but their nilaga was pretty good.   Definitely one of the better Filipino restaurants in the area, just a couple of cons."}
{"text":"I love going here for lunch. It's authentic, but fast. Set up buffet style big glass and you point at what you'd like to eat. They have to go boxes and package everything for you to where it doesn't spill on your drive. My favorites: bbq chicken skewer, caldereta(beef stew), and pancit(noodles). They have sweet bread on the side you can also purchase. Great service every time."}
{"text":"Fiesta Filipina is one of my go to spots for Filipino food whenever I'm in Vegas.  I like the location, selection of food and overall atmosphere of the place.  Most Filipino restaurants in Vegas are on Maryland Parkway but this one is located on Jones Blvd. It's in at the corner of a small strip mall. I like this location because it's easy to find and get to. It's also not too crowded.  The place is small and cute. Their decor is very Filipino with welcome and goodbye signs in Tagalog. They have kawayan bamboo wood decor around. Their back wall has a neat collage of Filipino celebrities who have frequented the restaurant. There are flat screen TVs on both ends of the restaurant where people can enjoy the latest sport game on cable or something on  the Filipino channel.  This place is not a buffet, instead it is turo- turo (Tagalog for point point). There is a display of food ready to eat and you point to which dish you want. They have a vast selection of traditional Filipino foods like kare-kare (meat in peanut butter broth), caldereta (beef stew), Filipino bbq skewers (chicken and beef), beef steak (beef with onions), menudo (pork stew), sinagang ns isda (sour fish soup) and lumpia (Filipino egg rolls).  If you don't want anything from the ready made dishes,  they do have some items that you can order and they can prepare especially for you like crispy pata (fried pork). For drinks, they have Filipino cantaloupe juice and various sodas. They offer dessert too! They have halo halo (Filipino shaved ice) and turon (Filipino banana egg rolls).   On my last visit here, I tried the kare-kare, the chicken skewers,  the beef steak and the turon. The kare kare broth on top of the white rice was a winner. I also liked the tender chicken skewers that surprisingly had a spicy kick to it. The beef steak had lots of shredded beef with onions. This one was good but a bit oily. The turon was a nice treat at the end. Crispy and sweet, the turon is a good deal for a $1. Like my previous visits, I left happy and full! I also had plenty of left over to take to-go.  This is a good spot to go to for Filipino food in Vegas!"}
{"text":"They're not as generous with their servings as DJ Bibingkahan was (or other places); it's subpar. Btw, my order was a \"to-go\".   Ratings: 5/5 caldereta (must try, it was pretty good) 4/5 laing 2/5 lechon (they served us so little, and it was almost all fat)   ... It's an okay place if you're tired of cooking at home."}
{"text":"Love that this is in a more convenient location for us. We really like Fiesta Filipina on St. Rose. Our favorite thing to get at Fiesta Filipina on St. Rose is the BBQ chicken and pork skewers.   Unfortunately, the BBQ skewers at this location does NOT taste the same as the ones on St. Rose. The pork taste like pig (I know sounds weird haha) and the chicken is just not the same. Please use the same recipe and technique to make this because it's what keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"So aside from the soggy rice, I do come here when craving filipino food. I've tried most of the filipino resturants and none of them make me come back. Except for this place, especially for Crispy Pata best in town.   Service is always friendly and the make you feel like home. The food is almost always presented well and clean."}
{"text":"The 5 stars is for the chicken bbq skewers.  The best ever!!!!  We order them in bulk Everytime we have guests and they all love it as much as we do."}
{"text":"Didn't expect much since I'm always comparing with my grandmothers cooking. But I was very surprised and glad to have come by.  Had the pancit and the chicken bbq at my first visit  By now I've been to the restaurant 10-15 times since its opening.  Even had my sons first bday there and I'm a huge fan."}
{"text":"My go-to place during the holidays, especially for Noche Buena (Christmas Eve). They have a Holiday Special for $139 consisting of:   30 pcs Veg Lumpia or 100 Lumpia Shanghai 20 pcs BBQ Pork or Chicken Pancit or Palabok (half tray) 3 pcs Boneless Bangus or 2 Crispy Pata 10 pcs Turon or Veg Lumpia  I've ordered this many times over the years and the family always look forward to it. This year we ordered two specials since my brother's family spent Christmas with us. More than enough for a group of 13 and mostly satisfied with all the food this year. I say mostly cause I have to say that the Palabok lacked sauce, but other than that, no complaints."}
{"text":"These guys are also fast and excellent when I order takeout food. Their lumpia shanghai platter is not only cheaper than at Goldilock's but is also cheaper."}
{"text":"When yo out gave cravings for Filipino food but they all close early on Sundays!  Found this place on Yelp and have it a try.  Tucked away in the back of the shopping center on Eastern and Saint Rose.  You can find this place in the same shaping centered of Lowe's.  First impression when pulling up was how cute their little set up if table and decorative items outside.  When you walk in, they have two dining area.  On the other side they have ready made food.  The food looked cold like it had been sitting for awhile.  I was hesitant to try this place.    We did anyway and prayed to the food God's that we don't get punished later with food poisoning.  We picked our choices and one of them have been sitting in a foam bowl which they served just like that.  We go had to ask if they could heat is up.  The meat was burnt to the point you can't chew it.  We switched it out for something else.  Overall I don't think I will be returning.  I like my food fresh and hot."}
{"text":"I like the ambiance, the cleanliness, how they label all the different sauces and the bathroom is clean, has a toilet sit cover and air freshener.  But the ride generic and cold.  Food is no good.  Tinolang manok are cut small and has a lot of bones.  Tortang talong  is covered with flour and is oily.  Inihaw na pork belly is with sauce and bell pepper and is salty.  I'm dissapointed about this place.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place for a long time so I checked it out today for lunch!   Walked in, clean and nice... You order from a buffet line. Not knowing Filapina food, its a bit difficult to look and order.   So I ordered what looked familiar, BBQ and pancit (stir fry noodle)  I also order a fried patty that had bean sprouts, carrots and a shrimp in the middle. Not sure of the name, but I am always open to trying new things.   The BBQ pork was tasty along with the noodles. The fried patty was cold, and chewy. They did offer a vinegar sauce which was good on it.   The staff was very friendly. I look forward to going back again and trying something else."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch.  Had an order of beef machado and bistek.  Both had good flavor and worth getting again. The only problem I had with this place was small selection they had.   I will have to go back and get an order of palobok."}
{"text":"I LOVE FIESTA FILIPINA. me and my plus 1, went 3 days in 1 week once! i they're setup is buffet line and you pick and choose your selections. each menu item may be a different price, but they also have combination plates. had different selections every time i went and thats what fun about this place, every time you come try something different! pork bbq sticks are juicer and have more flavor than chicken bbq sticks. rice of course and sinagang (soup) they make it just like how my grandma use to make it! the soup itself is complimentary so ask for just the broth and soak your rice! the other times, we ordered fried fish and he ordered fried pork.. i'm not a fan of fried pork but fried fish with the soy sauce/ lemon tasted so good! their palabok (white noodle, orange sauce) i was very disappointed in. dry and not enough flavor, there wasn't chicaron (pork grinds) to add on top of the dish, which usually gives the noodle dish a crunch. some must have: sinagang, pancit (dried noodles), and turon (jackfruit and banana glazed eggroll) =) it's great that they open this location in henderson. my parents are pleased that this cuisine is bringing out the filipino in me!"}
{"text":"food is good but i dread coming in here because its slow as molasses. 2day i came in and same things.... i counted 12 people in line and two people working the counter.....u serious??? the owner too cheap to hire more staff?...quit lining ur pockets w cash and hire some more employees buddy.....most ur bad reviews are because of \"customer service\" ...wake up!!!  i always tell myself thisnis the last time in here but i know ill be back lol..... if the customer service was decent id probably be there 3-4times a week....  see u in another 3-4 weeks!!"}
{"text":"Too oily for my taste... Yes, Filipino food tends to be oilier than other foods BUT my meat should not be drowning in oil. I was hoping it would be good since it's close to work. It's like fast food filipino style, since it's not all made-to-order. Being I'm far from home, I was looking for something like my mom's cooking. I'll keep looking."}
{"text":"We always come to this place. Love their BBQ pork, pancit and calderita! Good food and great service! This restaurant is like our \"go to place\" whenever we feel like not cooking. Maybe it's because we live near the area."}
{"text":"I came here just for the halo halo. They give a good size but I wasn't impressed. The shave ice was more icy instead of flaky. More jello is placed in the halo halo. It was sprinkled with corn flakes which is ghetto. I was hoping for more ube ice cream and coconut shreds. There version of halo halo is ghetto. So disappointed. Will not return."}
{"text":"Food is great here if you want actual fillipino food. Gave this place 2 stars because of the customer service that was given, the cashier lady asked me and my fiance if we wanted anything else, and we asked what were the sizes for the chicharon bulaklak, and she rudely told us \"ok let me help the people behind you\", like really? You asked us if we wanted anything else and when we decide to ask what were pricing ranges for something we get brushed off to the side and this was our first time here, first impressions go a long wa. Smh."}
{"text":"Only ate their Halo-Halo and was very satified. Plan on going back for a sit-down lunch very soon.  Actually went there last night in hopes of getting some pork sisig to eat during the Pacquioa fight. Was too late, as it was all gone."}
{"text":"Horrible experience. I showed up just to find out they ran out of food. I ended up still getting food. My husband had chicken and rice and he us to turn it back in because it was cold. Good thing is they did refund his money w out any problem   I ordered lumpia and they only gave me 8 of them because they \"ran out of it\" they still charged me the plate for full price and on top of that  The girl said the kitchen was closed and they would only prepare food if it's for a big party.  I won't be stopping here again. I'm very upset. So instead of having what I've been craving for month I'll settle for a sandwich shop in the same shopping center   They can have my money, hey just lost a good costumer"}
{"text":"The restaurant appeared a lot cleaner with no clutter than most Filipino restaurants I have been to.  When I went in I wanted to order some pancit, but I noticed that it was mixed with rice and wheat noodles.  I prefer rice noodles.  They were out of lumpia and didn't have chicken skewers.  Plus there was an attitude from behind the counter. I have to say this place was a miss for me.  Maybe in the future I might re-try but I highly doubt it."}
{"text":"food here is pretty good. Have to go with someone that knows there Filipino food or you wont know what your getting. Small place all homemade and fresh. Items on the menu that they carry are the fast moving items. You can sit inside and eat as well as take out.    we dined in and saw the place fill up twice, like line out the door. Not that many people dined in that night we were there.    I would go back just for the BBQ Pork and Adobo. very good."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick cheap meal. If your new to Filipino food, I would start off with the barbecue and pancit. If you're feeling more adventurous, try the dinuguan (blood stew) or balut (fertilized duck egg), if available. My mom still makes better dinuguan and pancit but this place is pretty good for price and convenience. I prefer to get take-out because sometimes they play terrible and depressing Filipino dramas on their TVs. The constant crying in the background is not appetizing."}
{"text":"The place looks nice and clean and service is pretty good. The food was ok. We had beef stew with rice which was delicious. Also had the fried noodle with barbecue sticks and that was ok. We paid a little extra for the other kind of bbq stick but they actually tasted the same. My husband loves boba tea. They forgot to make it and he had to go ask them to make it. When he got it I took a sip and it was like pure syrup. It was so sweet even I who is the ultimate sweet tooth cannot drink it at all. We will be trying another place next time."}
{"text":"My gf loved this place! We have been looking for food like this for a long time! I like the water jug they have. Food was delicious and well worth the drive. We will be going back many times and are looking forward to it! I had the skewers and they were some of the best skewers I have ever had! Seriously go try them!"}
{"text":"I'm half Filipina and, growing up, my mom's friend owned a turo turo restaurant. This is the stuff my childhood dreams are made of!  My favorite thing in the whole world is adobo pusit (squid sautéed in garlic and squid ink and whatever else makes it amazing). They have it but I have to call and see (I don't think it's daily).   I got bangus and it had NO BONES (what the what? ) I was able to eat while driving with my hands (not proud of that particular moment, but it happened, so there).   The Lechon is literally the best I've ever had, ever. Takes me back to the days of family parties and a giant roast pig on the table with an apple in its mouth, feeling slightly sorry for it, but standing right by and eating its back with my hands. Sorry, tmi.   I host my daughter's bday party once a year and they cater and deliver. Everyone raves about the skewers. BBQ Chicken or pork. No matter how many skewers or lechon or lumpia I order, I run out. Which is bad, but yay. Means they enjoyed. I order food for 100 people and have a party for 50, those babies will be gone. And everyone asks where I got the food.   So yeah. It's not fancy, and, like my own Filipino family, they're very matter of fact...but it's my fav in town."}
{"text":"I had my daughter's 1st birthday party catered by Fiesta Filipina.  I've had some bad Filipino food in Las Vegas so I almost gave up on the idea, but I wanted to incorporate my culture into her birthday.  A friend recommended this place, so I gave it a shot.  It was soooooooooooooo delicious!  Being half Filipina myself, I grew up on this food.  But, a lot of my friends in Las Vegas are multi-cultural (most are not Filipino), so I ordered what I thought more \"white\" people would enjoy.  Lumpia BBQ pork skewers BBQ chicken skewers Pancit Chop suey (in case there were any vegetarians) Lechon (my favorite indulgence)  Everything was outstanding!  Even the guests were raving about it and asking where I got it.  Definitely will go back for a regular meal.  It's a drive for me, but worth it!"}
{"text":"I already wrote a review for their other location.  You can read it if you like.  Basically, I grew up on Filipino food and this is the best in Vegas, in my opinion.  It's the only place I've ever had cater my parties.  The lumpia are the best I've had in town.  They don't always have pusit (squid sauteed in onions and its own ink) but when they do, it takes me back to childhood.  I've had too much bad Filipino food in town so when I find the real deal I just have to shout it from the rooftops!"}
{"text":"I was not planning on coming back to this restaurant but a Filipino friend of  mine was in town and she wanted to try it. The food was good, as it was the last time I was there, the service was even better. The stone faced cashier was not there. It was nice friendly guy this time and it made the experience a lot better. The people dishing out the food seemed nice this time around too."}
{"text":"My wife got medium size dinuguuan and beef kaldereta to go and both were really good. We ate them for two days. Their dinuguan is authentic unlike the dinuguuan at Island Pacific which consists of fatty pork belly and not the internal organs that it should be. Their pork and chicken BBQ is always good but sometimes not warm enough. Their beef tapa is the best. Their staff are friendly."}
{"text":"Out of all the buffet style Filipino Restaraunts in Vegas, Filipina Fiesta is my favorite.  Its clean, it smells good, the employees speak better english than other restaraunts, the decor is more appealing and the food presentation is wonderful.  I especially come to this location for the Sinigang, which is better than grandmas. Yes i said it, \"better than grandmas!!!\"  It's SUPER sour and filled with vegetables and meat.  The portions are worth more than the $5 it costs and they are not stingy on the rice!"}
{"text":"Ordered food 2 weeks in advance. Pick up time was set up. Today, we were going to be late for pick up so we tried calling them 5 minutes earlier. No answer til 20 minutes past the set time. And when they finally answered first thing they say is they're already closing they already disposed of the order.  20 minutes past pick up time and nobody even bothered calling back their customer. They just went ahead and threw everything in the trash. What's the use of taking the customer's phone number if you're not going to use it.   Way to ruin your customer's day guys! Thanks a lot"}
{"text":"My stepmom is Filipina and always finds the best buffets/restaurants to go to.   We bought longanisa sausage (she used to cook this for me growing up for breakfast), BBQ chicken, jeprox fish, and a few of their chicken dishes.   This place offers an assortment of yummy sauces and free lemon water :)   It's usually never empty here - have not gone during the evening time."}
{"text":"Pls!guys don't oder this fiesta Filipina Cuisine in Jones or any location.the service its really2x bad,and also the employee they are Rude. I never ever come back this place ever again or ordering this place again.they don't know how to handle the customers. no respect at all."}
{"text":"Pork Adobe was literally swimming in grease! My hubby got sick to his stomach an hour after eating. Everything very greasy!"}
{"text":"I love that I can pick and choose! I'm Filipino so this place is a 10 for me! Don't wanna miss out"}
{"text":"First time here and I was pleasantly surprised! I'm Filipino but haven't had filipino cuisine for some time as I'm partial to my family's style of cooking back in Hawaii, and it hasn't fit my personal lifestyle and fitness goals for a couple years.  It's hard to tell which restaurant would satisfy my palette because I'm a little picky with filipino food.  But because the restaurant serves Papangpangan (sp?) style cuisine made me trust it a bit more. The Kare Kare, pork adobo, chicken BBQ sticks were delicious!  Not overly salty or greasy is a plus. Pinakbet was ok because it's not my dad's, so...lol...They didn't serve sari sari that day or I'd have picked that instead for a veggie type dish. Altogether, I'd recommend this place for your filipino fill. Lots of variety to choose from that's ready to plate and go if you choose not to dine in. Ordered the 2 choice special which comes with rice, added a side of BBQ sticks and a medium sized container of Kare Kare plus 2 banana Turon for us. Plenty of food for 2 - could very well feed 3...for under $15. I could've eaten the Kare Kare by myself but I had to share. Ang Sarap!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed it even more on our second trip! Think it will be among our go-to bookmarked spots! The two item combo with rice is only $5.99 and is plenty for one... We each get one with different items and share. Love the BBQ pork!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I work in the area and stop in for lunch. Everything always looks good but I always get the beef in brown gravy sauce because I'm addicted. It's actually oxtail with the bones and everything and the sauce it's made of tastes like my Mom's cooking. And I'm West Indian!  I tried the bbq pork skewers and they were juicy and delicious. I also like the fried banana snack.   Only wish they had other rice options like brown rice and red beans or even fried rice. Not a big fan of unsalted white rice but you can throw your gravy over it for flavor."}
{"text":"I love this place. I used to live right down the street from it and would always get my food from them whenever I crave for Filipino food. I'm a Kapampangan, and early in life I was taught what good food taste like. Does this place taste like my grandma's legendary cooking? I've been working in professional kitchens for the past 6yrs, under really great chefs, and no one came close to my grandma. But their food is good enough, better than others actually. They specialize in Kapampangan food, and theirs are the most authentic Kapampangan food I've had in Vegas, aside from the ones we cook at home of course.   They have really good crispy pata, pancit bihon, bicol express, bistek, and lechon kawali. They even have karioka which my mom loves. The only negative thing I can say about this place is that they need to stick with the traditional Kapampangan halo-halo with pastillas and macapuno, instead of the Tagalog version, and  their pancit luglug/palabok needs more consistency and flavor; they need to readjust their sauce recipe and put more shrimp in it. Otherwise, it's a good place to go introduce your foreign friends to our cuisine and also to satisfy your Filipino food cravings,"}
{"text":"Fast and delicious food. Nothing compares to home cooking, but this comes close. I've had a lot of really disappointing Filipino food in Vegas, because I'm very particular about my food. I ordered food to go, and by the time I got home it was still tasty.   Pancit was good. BBQ on a stick is so yummy. I personally am a fan of the pork BBQ, but my son and husband love the chicken best... But can't go wrong with either choice. Lumpia was very good, and crispy just like I want. I always get disappointed if I bite into a soggy one, but that wasn't the case here. Lechon was good, but could use some salt.    Definitely coming back again!"}
{"text":"Here right now and its 6:30pm. Male server, VERY RUDE! my mom was inquiring re this vegetable lumpia, very simple question, he rudely responded \"no one was available to wrap them anymore!\" With an attitude like my mom was an annoying customer-- can i just say, first of all, SHE WASN'T TALKING TO YOU!   The way he was acting like they were about to close in 30 mins or we were actually delaying them to close. THEY CLOSE 8:30pm! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!   He was rude to me & my husband already when he got our order earlier and reason why my mom went back re the lumpia was bec she craved for it aswell so she wanted to see if she could order it for to go. But got turned off & she just acted that she didn't hear that mans comment.  We come here often especially when my mom craves filipino food but tonight - bec of that man, service is horrible.  I rarely post negative reviews but this man pissed me off"}
{"text":"Very very good.  Had the BBQ pork with a side of lumpias. Price was extremely reasonable and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I usually turn to the panceit at this location and for some reason they never have the Adobo for some reason everytime I come in! So I usually just settle for the chicken skewers. At the south west location they always have Adobo which is so good, tender chunks marinated in  a fairly spicey sauce! What's not to like. Another fun thing to pick up here is some of the Asian snacks. I love the buttered biscoti and usually grab a bag when I'm in."}
{"text":"BBQ pork or chicken on a stick, you can't go wrong! The goat was kinda bony and oily. The squid adobo was decent. The banana filled pastry and the Halo Halo were super. The TV's had Filipino cartoons on. You know a Filipino food place is good when there are tons of Filipinos eating there :)"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious it's very clean the people are so polite my only complaint is that use styrofoam cups and boxes which are not good for the environment I would hate to stop coming here because of that."}
{"text":"So while waiting to get my moms car service, we decided to eat Filipino food at Fiesta. We ordered and ready to pay, I'm in the military but I didn't ask for a discount. But my mom did ask \"do you have Military discount\"? The owner/manager was around the cashier and said rudely \"NO, did you just get here from the Philippines? That's only in the Philippines and it's 20% off?\" The food is okay cuz I was really hungry, and the rice we ordered had to be returned because it was halfway done. All she had to say is \"sorry we don't\" and don't have to be disrespectful!"}
{"text":"Good food and very friendly staff. Been here a lot of times and was never disappointed.  Ang babait ng mga tao."}
{"text":"I really thought I liked dish place prom when I used to go here. I'd like to gib it dat extra star but shumting ish holding me back.  I take the girl here for an after the gym treat. SMART. I got that itch that Filipinos get when they haven't eaten anything unhealthy in a minute. I talk her into going here so we can munch on chicharon bulaklak (deep fried pork intestines), lechon kawali (deep fried pork), and sinigang na baboy (a soup with pork and veges in a sour tamarind base). The bulaklak was ok. I had trouble finding the vinegar. Usually restaurants have a seasoned vinegar sauce ready to go. I had to make my own with whatever sauces and makings that they had on this small table. I had trouble looking for the secret sauce that makes all lechon just that much better. Mang Tomas!?! Where the pho'k are you?! I find it in a  weird container. The sinigan was up to par but wasn't nearly as good as the other restaurants around the way. Both me and the girl only liked the sinigan there.   Maybe it was an off day today or maybe I better get my eats at the other spots around the way. I'll give it one more try on these main items. Allthough their crispy pata is pretty on point here. I will give them that.  With that said, because of their crispy pata....  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"They have bangus sisig.. that's my favorite. It's \"Turo-turo\" style Filipino food. I definitely prefer them than the other places on this side of town, whose food looks really old. Theirs looks a bit fresher than the other places. Just a bit. Their boba drinks are really powdery though. Not good at all. Stick with the food."}
{"text":"*New Location* Durango &  Warm Springs! Idk if they're from the same owners or not. Super close to us  this place beats the rest in the area for sure. Friendly, clean, and great tasting Filipino cuisine! My husby & I stuffed ourselves w/ all kinds of authentic goodness. Pics won't do it justice."}
{"text":"My favorite Filipino restaurant here in Vegas!! Love the crispy pata the dipping sauce is the bomb! The pork BBQ is my daughter favorite! Karioka is my daughter favorite as well! They have a lot of Filipino dish to be choose for! Definitely my favorite Filipino restaurant"}
{"text":"My favorite is the BBQ chicken skewers with sauce on the rice! Can't go wrong with the lumpia as well. One of my fav places to eat! Owners are super sweet people as well."}
{"text":"This place had a variety of dishes to choose from, some that ice never seen before.   The food was pretty good.   I gave it a 3-star for the slow service, as two people were helping a family of 3. Always expect slow service at a Filipino establishment. Ever heard of Filipino time?   I also gave them 3-stars because it was too hot to eat in there. As soon as I walked in, I knew I was going to take it to go. It's hot in Vegas at this time, so I would expect food establishments would be a lot cooler. While I was waiting, I pulled out and unfolded my fan. I'm sure winters will be a lot better.   In any case, I'll be frequenting this place to get my weekly Filipino fix."}
{"text":"This place was good. Kind of a point and click place but they sure fill your plates and the pricing is not bad."}
{"text":"Fiesta filipina is the best when it comes to pilipino food. It's clean, the people greet you promptly and nicely  when you come. The owners  really take care and make you feel at home. The portions are big and they have everything down so that quality and the taste is consistent in both of their restaurants. I recommend  their Crispy Pata, sisig na bangus, and their famous barbecue. The halo halo is also very  good loaded with all the best ingredients topped with Leche flan and ube ice cream. I use to drive to their  Jones location and I am so glad that they now have the Henderson store. A big bonus is the price too. Where can you buy good food at a very reasonable  Price?  Only at Fiesta."}
{"text":"Service could be better.  One of the food servers  wiped his nose with his hands and proceeded to serve food to customers.  Gross!   The food looks like it sits all day.  Better to eat there in the morning, when its fresh.  The bbq is soaked in a sauce that is quite disgusting.  They think it keeps the meat moist, what keeps the meat moist is to not burn the meat and dry it out.  I ordered bbq today and it was burned, dry and full of carcinogens. My total was under $6.40 and they charge a $.50 fee for debit purchases under $10.  Which is fine, but the lady charged me $7.00. Is it really that difficult to punch in $6.90?  Wow, nickel and diming people.  It sucks this is the only Filipino restaurant on this side of town.   I am Americanized and if you don't respond in Tagalog they tend to give you an unpleasant attitude.  I hate that, I don't control where I was born or raised.  Get over it.  #hater"}
{"text":"Food was great!  Plenty of variety .  Make sure to order the crispy pata."}
{"text":"Very good value for good Filipino food. Cafeteria style - prepared food they serve in to-go containers and pay at the counter. Friendly staff & very fast food!"}
{"text":"Walking into the resturaunt, you are reminded of some of the \"nicer\" ulam shop style eateries in the Philippines. We ate there pretty close to closing and the food tasted pretty fresh. Not badly priced, 5.99 for white rice and two meat dishes. The place is nicely decorated and clean. The food could have been a bit warmer. The food is pretty much authentic so the meat dishes will contain chunks of fat. We will likely be back again."}
{"text":"It was my dad's fave (before he passed).  In fact, he celebrated his birthday/father's day lunch.  As a result, we drop by often for the pansit, ukoy, BBQ sticks, & lumpia Shanghai...shumai (when available)...almost forgot the taro boba was pretty tasty as well for the price in relation to the amount.  It's worth the drive from the NW.  :)"}
{"text":"This place is my go to when I crave for kare-kare (made from a base of stewed oxtail,pork hocks, pork feet, tripe and vegetables with a thick savory peanut sauce) and their pancit when I'm lazy to cook lol. They have good variety of foods to choose to. Place is family oriented. So anyway, Went here yesterday with my co worker at 7:30pm to buy food for the potluck, female server VERY RUDE!!! We we're asking how much is a box of pancit she answered \"$6.99\" and gave us a look like we were an annoying customer. The way she acted like they're gonna close in 30 mins or we were delaying them to close (can you not give us few minutes to decide what else to get?). They close at 8:30!!- - - she just put half of the pancit in the box like srsly?? Even the dinuguan we bought was so messy because she was just wrapping without looking if it's already spilling or not. I'm gonna give 5 stars for the food but customer service is . The only one who is nicer is the lady in the cashier."}
{"text":"I came back for more, but this time, they ran out of what I really wanted to eat or don't have what I've been looking for.  Binagoongan-this is pork in salted shrimp paste.  I really wanted to eat this dish, but they didn't cook it today either.  They did recommend me something that is kinda similar and gave me a taste of it but since there is a peanut butter taste, I didn't like too much.  Ok, that's fine, so I wanted the lechon, but they ran out :(  So for my two items with rice, I chose the safe route and got the pork adobo.  Yum yum like the first time.  For the second item, I asked the guy there whether the fried fish or intestine taste better, and he said the intestine.  It was kind of salty.  I kinda stayed away from this after a few bites.  These fried intestines could definitely be made with less salt.  Their lumpia shanghai was good.  Nice little appetizer to munch on.  I tried the melon cooler this time, and it was pretty decent.  I will order it again.  So lesson learned, call them prior to making a visit to see what they got cooking.  Service is still awesome."}
{"text":"Food is just ok.. It used to be good but somehow the quality of their food is not great. Service is AWFUL when managers and owners are not around. I never felt welcome here."}
{"text":"The ladies at Fiesta Filipina were very patient with me. As I pointed to something they described what it was.  I was very pleased with my selections.   I have had Pancit and Lumpia, so I was able to try something new.  I'm sorry but I don't know the names of the dishes, but I will do my best to try and explain what I got.  I got something like beef stew, w/ rice that was very good, along with some pork with gravy w/ rice, this was a little salty, but it was still good.   The lumpia was OK, and I loved the pancit.   I also got the fried banana's wasn't my cup of tea, I liked it without the bananas   I thought for all the food I got it was very reasonable!"}
{"text":"Took em down a star for their rude azz f*ck pushy attitudes behind the counter. I told you already, I don't want them old azz lumpias that been sitting there all day! Sheesh.  Since Kucina Ni Lorraine Express opened up on Bermuda I've been taking my azz there instead lately."}
{"text":"Their food has the closest taste to my mom's cooking (Kapampangan Style), so I'm glad they opened one on this side of town.  The owner & their onsite manager are great to work with & have even worked with my family on our family events held at their restaurant.  Their price is a little more than their Eastern location, but that doesn't stop me from eating here =)"}
{"text":"What a rip off... 2 longinisa, 2 cooper rice, 1 chix bbq and 1 egg...$10!!! It's Filipino food and it should be cheap. I didn't order any shrimp or fish lol. Aysus I don't get it.  Never ever coming back here again. Smh"}
{"text":"Just picked up some crispy pata and a side of beef in some type of gravy with some steamed rice.   All I can say is WOW!  These place is doing something right.  I came in 1 hr before they closed. I gotta admit, I was skeptical at first.  This is the second time we order from here and they don't disappoint.   The pata was crispy on the outside & moist and tasty on the inside.  I will not be trying another Filipino place unless these guys drop the ball."}
{"text":"Ahhh-haaaaa. A Filipino restaurant, actually, close to me!  So close that I've eaten here for lunch 4 days in a row.   I always seem to come here right before noon; and because of that I always catch them in the makings of my favorite item there: BBQ PORK BELLY!!!!!!!!!!  Mmmmm, just thinking about it makes my mouth water. Because I come here as they're making it, they always seem to remember me. I guess have my cute nephew with me is, also, hard to forget.  This spot, also, had thee best crispy pata. Crispy Pork! I just love the sauce they have with it, too. It's a vinegar, soy sauce, chili goodness that I love to dip anything into.  Took my mom here 3/4 times and another friend the last time. My mom now requires me to take her here when I'm off.  My nephew LOVES their cantaloupe juice. And my haole friend loves it, too.  Excited to live closer to this spot. Although, I'm sure I'll have to buy bigger sized jeans because of it."}
{"text":"Past 2 times I've come to this place around 10am in the morning they stopped serving eggs with the silog dishes...WTF!!!! McDonald's stops a 11am!!!  Yet...their food counter had all the silogs and garlic fried rice...that's just BLASPHEMY!!! You lost paying customers twice already for this reason.  If you fix this situation, please let me know. I'm Filipino and I love my Filipino Food...but that is just wrong."}
{"text":"Be still my Filipino foodie heart!  Almost as good as Lola's cooking. Pancit with just enough spice and the pusit was so good! I've missed dinuguan and the dish here hit the spot. It's a pick and choose kind of place where you can select the dish and the serving size. The medium pancit was more than enough for 5 adults to share with 3 other dishes. Try the atchara, great sweet pickled flavor that's a perfect palate cleanser, if you will, between trying all the delicious food! Finished with a halo halo which did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I was shocked and excited to see the different dishes and bakery items here they also have all my favorite desserts and halo halo! Omg yum! They also have it decorated In wood or wicker furniture which reminded me of when I would visit the Philippines when I was little it took me way back loved it def recommend."}
{"text":"Thought the service was excellent! Tried the lumpia, pancit, and pork adobo. Loved it all! Will definitely come back here again. Also price is great."}
{"text":"Great new Filipino restaurant SW of the strip! Great tasting food with lots of choices. \"Turo turo\" style dinning with other dishes made to order. Clean restaurant, friendly staff and a typical Filipino atmosphere. (TFC all day!) lol"}
{"text":"Crispy pata a must in this place! if you have party they can cater to your needs."}
{"text":"The best Filipino restaurant in town. I've been to so many of them every time I visit Vegas. This by far is the best.  Geraldine is very accommodating to all. Very friendly staff , clean environment and most all great food. Please open one in San Diego:)"}
{"text":"Really good Filipino food in Henderson. Service is quick and they are really friendly. I'm part Filipina and am not familiar with all of the dishes and anything that I have asked what it is they are always happy to let me sample.   My go to dishes are the pork and chicken skewers, Shanghai lumpia, pancit, and the beef stew. The melon drink is so refreshing and sweet, especially on a hot summer Vegas day.   Quick and filling lunch with friendly service and decent pricing."}
{"text":"It's clean most of the time I go there...but the other times I just get so disgusted out. The tables aren't cleaned properly and there's still so much mess from the previous person sitting there. However, the thing that keeps me going back is their pork BBQ and their crispy pata. Always cooked to perfection when I get it."}
{"text":"I've been going here for the past year and I absolutely LOVE this place for my beefsteak fix....yeah i know it's not spelled that way, but that's how i say it and that's how i'm gonna spell it! lol. I've tried other items, but nothing has come close to what I'm used to with my mom's cooking, so I stick to the best of the best of their items - the beefsteak. Thinly sliced meat with onions in the oh-so tasty lemon/soy sauce concoction.  Everytime we go here, this is all i ever order - that is until I saw a sign for a new item they have - lechon manok.  mmmmm.....ok, this is a must try for me - along with the crispy pata which i've been lagging on trying. So, I could be wrong, maybe one of these items will move up to take the reign! Cute restaurant - love the little hut decor that separates their dining area. Was just there yesterday and going back today after work to pick up one of them rotisserie chickens (lechon manok). Not sure if there is new management, but kudos to Fiesta Filipina for responding to sub-par reviews and attempting to provide better customer satisfaction - nice touch, because even though you might not know it, yelp customers do check to see if restaurants do acknowledge or even make changes to address issues that are brought up and looks like Fiesta Filipina is doing just that!  Keep up the good work...   6/29 - just wanted to update that we tried the lechon manok and it's an easy pass.  Costco and Wal-Mart have way better rotisserie chicken.  Still a great place though."}
{"text":"This place is consistently good!  My husband loves the bar b q and cantaloupe drink.   I love everything else :).  My daughter is also a fan of Fiesta in Jones Blvd.  You can also call to get a to-go order so that you can just pick up if you are in a hurry.  Parking is also not bad at this place."}
{"text":"of all filipino restaurants, this one of the few that i like. its pricier than most filipino fast food places but its still reasonable. they have cool filipino decor and their bbq is AMAZING. love love their bbq and fried banana lumpia. i think theyre always nice too so i'm not sure why some people had bad service lol overall, i think their quality is always consistent."}
{"text":"I can't agree with the consensus here.  I visit Vegas like 10x/year, usually with my mom, and one of our traditions is going to Filipino food right of the plane.  Lady at the car rental counter suggested Fiesta because of their multiple locations and consistency.  Had a combo with bbq, bistek, pancit, mongo, and lumpia sariwa.  It just wasn't that good.  The food seemed old, and their microwaved the lumpia to heat the sauce.  Nice enough people at the counter, but I'd pass on going again."}
{"text":"They have the best Bangus Sisig I've ever had!!! Truly the BEST Filipino restaurant in Las Vegas and Henderson!!!!  I tried a lot  of other places for the past 6 years I've been here and this is our favorite Filipino restaurant. Worth the drive if you want quality Filipino food, reasonable price, clean, and great ambience.  Friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Once in a while, I like to venture off and try a different cuisine. This mom and pop place is tucked in a small plaza on Jones and Dessert Inn, in the same plaza as Escape and Jojo's jerky. My visit left me stuffed, yet unsatisfied.  Setup is similar to Panda Express, but with array of traditional Filipino dish from lumpia to chicken adobo. I am not too familiar with Filipino cuisine so I just pointed at whatever looked good. Everything looked good on the display that I was probably drooling as I was browsing through the display...mmh, yes I will take that one. And that one. Oh, and that one too.   Dined in and they put all the food on a plastic plate. I'm assuming it's for their convenience so they don't have to deal with dirty plates but would be nice to have a more decent plate. Of course they only have plastic utensils. Felt like I was at some sort of family gathering. Ha.   Some dishes we got were luke warm, and some were cold. I guess this is what happens when you have a display without a heat lamp. Everything was way too salty for me. Perhaps I'm not used to Filipino cuisine? Though the noodles they had were pretty tasty, everything else we got were just ok.   Left here stuffed but visit was easily forgettable."}
{"text":"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised as soon as I walked in on 4/27/16. I loved the Filipino decor that reminded me of the furniture my family had growing up. They have a pretty good variety of foods in a turo turo style buffet and it's very affordable. I had been craving bistek so I ordered 2 servings of it with rice (2 item combo is $7.50). It was pretty good and I enjoyed the sinigang too. Another Yelper said the bistek was too salty but I don't agree with that at all. I wanted to try more food, especially halo-halo since it's my favorite but I was very full after I finished my food. As full as I was, I still had an entire serving of bistek left over so I was happy about that. So we ended up taking home some desserts they sell from a Kapampangan bakery :)  The staff is also really nice. I will definitely be back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try out this restaurant, based from the reviews. I have to admit the food was delicious and the place clean. I give them big credit for that.The reason for the two stars is that one is made to eat meals in their cheap and flimsy plates and utensils and cups. Secondly, as i stood alone, waiting for the ladies bathroom to free up, Out came this well dressed middle aged gentleman from an office facing the bathrooms. He neither said hello, nor showed any kind of hospitality. He came back out of the kitchen, back to his office, suspiciously eyeing me as he was punching the security code to his office door, again without acknowledging my lonesome presence. A little nod or a little hello would've made the difference to me, as a paying patron. I guess he didn't need my return business anymore. I'll be happy to take my business elsewhere, where a nod or a Smile would've gone a long, long, long way. My family and i come to Vegas annually. Never again in this snotty place. Kusina ni Lorraine, in all its humble existence, always goes out of their way to welcome their patrons.  My wallet and i will go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love the first Filipina on jones.. so as soon as I heard they were building one on my side of town I had to try it. I went, and it has all the classic dishes you grew up with. I was a little confused on how to order because I did not see any signs on what kind of orders you could get so I just asked. I got a two item combo with rice, came out to about $8! Not too bad. My only complaint was that it wasn't hot when I ate it, not even my sinigang. Other than that, super good, quick, and cheap!"}
{"text":"I love this place! My family has been going here for years. If you want traditional Filipino food, then come here. It's affordable, it's yummy, and I really feel like I'm back at Lola's house on fermin street in manila. Thanks again fiesta! The only complaint I have is there is no air conditioning.. Only a fan so it's hot (but I feel like I'm back in the Philippines again! Lol)"}
{"text":"2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE - Contender #8  We found ourselves at Fiesta Filipina for our 8th Halo-Halo taste test.  I can't believe that we just started this challenge last week and we are now only 2 contenders away from completing this challenge.    Terri and I met up with Ian A for this challenge.  We had some eats, but our primary reason for this stop was obvious...how is their Halo-Halo? Fiesta Filipina has a regular Halo-Halo for $3.99 and their special for $4.99.  The only difference between the two is ube ice cream.  Since we are maximizing our craving, we decided on the special of course.   So, what's in this special Halo-Halo.  You get ube ice cream (two scoops), condensed milk, shave ice, nata de coco, macapuno, pinipig, azuki (red beans), white beans, and some legit ube.  This is our only 2nd stop that had real ube in it.  What's missing is the flan and lanka.  After mixing my Mix-Mix and sampling it, I already knew that Fiesta's Halo-Halo is ranking up there in my book.  The ice was just right, taste superb, and the mix was almost perfect.  I stress almost perfect because flan was the one missing ingredient that I was looking for.  By the way, you can order flan on the side (about $5) and add to it if flan is a must have in your Halo-Halo.  On a side note, I did have some food here too.  The ambiance of this restaurant reminds me of the Flip joints in SF, SoCal, and Daygo.  I loved it and felt at home.  But I wasn't too impressed with the food.  The food is cheap and for $5.29 you can get two Chicken BBQ Sticks with rice. Sounded and looked appealing, but I'm no fan of rubbery chicken.   Overall, I am a fan of their Halo-Halo and see myself coming back just that. Food...well, that's a different story.  PS:  One thing I learned during this quest for our favorite Halo-Halo in the valley is that real spoons (not the flimsy plastic ones) are ideal when mixing your Halo-Halo. These plastic spoons work like catapults when you're mixing your Halo-Halo. Last thing I want is an ube shot in the face.  Stay hungry, my friends.    2013 HALO-HALO CHALLENGE: Contender #1 (Elena's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/elenas-restaurant-las-vegas-2#hrid:66pT_yQvZudRThxlGl74Qw Contender #2 (Jollibee):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/jollibee-las-vegas-2#hrid:ZSJzziWEVLyOF3DHfn1MaA/src:self Contender #3 (Cafe Cebu):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/caf%C3%A9-de-cebu-las-vegas#hrid:5iu3U4zoZWQISOSO7BMsGQ Contender #4 (Salo-Salo):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/salo-salo-grill-las-vegas#hrid:Wgtkj97v8-l9MnNuyj-QxQ/src:self Contender #5 (Thelma's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/thelmas-filipino-restaurant-henderson#hrid:wzGAlZyBNi1UtDRM0t0oXw Contender #6 (Andrea's):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/andreas-las-vegas#hrid:idKe5bOeuIwnyzcamgeUDg Contender #7 (Chow King):  http://www.yelp.com/biz/chow-king-las-vegas-2#hrid:3FzhPzAaF7_OE6i0Nau5WA"}
{"text":"This was the first Filipino restaurant Ive tried since I moved here to Vegas from Houston. This food reminded me of home-cooked meals on Christmas' cooked with my Family! The Pancit was amazing it tasted like my mom's when she cooked it from scatch and at home on our own stove, with Fresh Veggies and all, I hadnt had Longanisa since I was a child, and it tasted like it was made as straight from the heart, everything was just great... The staff was homey feeling, nice and warm, and helpful... Great Service and Great Food always keep me coming back it was quite the experience I loved it!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. It's always clean, everything I've had is incredible. You must try the cantaloupe drink!   I first found out about this place years ago when they had their small location, they were so welcoming and lovely. This specific location is much closer to home and always filled with customers every time I come in. Take out is available and well wrapped! They also cater your parties with a fantastic price for all that is offered."}
{"text":"This was our first time checking this place out and we were so pleased by the friendliness of the staff, the affordable prices and the food is excellent! We certainly will be back."}
{"text":"This place just opened up near my house so one day the BF and I stopped by for a snack: -2 Chicken Barbecue Sticks- Good but I think I would prefer it if my stick wasn't double dunked in the sauce- sauce overload but good -Lumpia (eggrolls)- Salty Good (I like salty, better than bland) The lumpia was good I look forward to trying the pancit and veggie eggrolls The inside is clean and service is fast- I can't stand the smell though- not a typical bad smell just a strong food smell- so I will take my food to go"}
{"text":"The food is really good; especially the turon. The TFC didn't really work though, so I didn't get to watch."}
{"text":"This is a small mom and pop restaurant and you can tell they love what they do, the food is very good. The caldereta is a family favorite and the lumpia and bbq is a go-to for our kids as well. They have 2 other locations and I have visited the one in Henderson which is just as good."}
{"text":"The Longinisa is my favorite the quantity is a lot I couldn't finish my plate and the service is very fast as all the food is ready to go, but It is a little greasy"}
{"text":"Crisy Pata FTW!!!! We always have to order a large for the table or for home along with whatever combos we get.  Its a must try.  Dip with the soy sause that they provide or the lechon sauce."}
{"text":"One of the best places to get home cooked Filipino food! I always get the lechon kawali with pinakbet. OMG literally the best combo ever!"}
{"text":"always consistent! good food with matching friendly staff. we always love coming here bec the food is delicious. newly renivated so more space. ample parking.  food faves: caldereta bistek lechon kawali  special order crispy pata  tip: ask for soup broth with your combo meal for free"}
{"text":"This is a new branch located close to my office, its clean and the ambiance is very Pinoy! Love their dried fish (even though it stinks haha), tinola, chicken BBQ, caldereta, and their melon drink! Price is just right, and you dont have to wait 20-30 minutes for your food to come since its a buffet-style place. (Called \"carinderia\" in Filipino)"}
{"text":"When I'm craving for filipino (carinderia style) food, I come here to eat BBQ and soup (sinigang is the best!)"}
{"text":"This is good FIlipino food.  Friendly, louder atmosphere - two competing tv stations on four screens.   It is your typical turo-turo style filipino restaurant.  2 scoops of rice and 2 dishes.  Fiesta lacks a little consistency, but when it is good - the Mungo is really good, the BBQ and the caldereta. They had a case of mango yesterday that had more wrinkles than old elephants arse.  Skip the bakery goods and produce - they do not understand fresh rotations.  Keep them FRESH!"}
{"text":"Great Crispy Pata - Best in town.  BBQ, Mungo, battered bangus is all top notch!!! Cheap prices, tasty Filipino food that is well worth the drive.  Decor and seating - needs a little freshening up.  Paper plates and plastic utensils fit the ambiance, but food is EXCELLENT!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what's worse, their food or service? We ordered the holiday special a week in advance. When we got there the food was not ready. Okaaaay? Not too mention the ladies upfront are rude. Maybe because I don't speak their language or I might not be too Filipino enough for them. All their differ types of pancit sucks. Their crispy pata is just ok. If recommend you spend ur money else where."}
{"text":"not coming back. tables are dirty, not maintained after customer leaves. food looks very fatty compared to other filipino restaurants. I couldn't even eat my kare kare because the ox part they gave me was all fat. this place is low quality."}
{"text":"This place is decent, I've had The opportunity to have authentic Filipino food before this, so my expectations were perhaps a little too high! Thought this place does have a variety of popular Filipino food. I had the lechon with white rice, chicken barbecue skewers, and these little vegetable rolls that were delicious with sweet and spicy sauce.  The atmosphere at this place was fun and they had an assortment of Filipino goodies to be purchased in the front of the restaurant. It was pretty busy around dinner time enough to hear other person conversations which was a little awkward. But that may be due to how close together the tables were to each other."}
{"text":"This place is our go to for when we crave filipino food. When my bestie arrived here in Vegas from Toronto last Saturday, May 26,2018, I suggested this place in a heartbeat. Mother and son were satisfied and they even ordered to go their pork sisig. We served the sisig the next day for lunch at home and so disappointed to find this ... a plastic part of probably a condiment ... dirty dining would love to look into this. Management should re organize their kitchen system, someone could have swallowed this."}
{"text":"READ THIS-Food is tasty but do take out.   *Key to happiness when eating here.   Cook rice before you leave the house, their rice is soggy."}
{"text":"There is nothing sadder when one has a bad experience in a food place.  The first time could be a fluke.  But for another incident......it will be the last time I go there. *The first time was when I chose their griled squid.  I don't remember if it was to be stuffed or not.  But when we got home- it was stuffed all right!!!!  Stuffed still with it's guts/innards and as I cut into it....it leaked out some greenish black liquid.  That was so gross and c/u the place to let 'em know.  I think they just said bring in the receipt and they will give me a refund.  I've given them a couple chances and it was ok.   **But now......that was the last time we will be going there.  I ordered a Taro Boba Drink but no pearls avail.  Which is ok BUT........as we were driving home...I kept smelling like this garlic scent.  Then as the ice melted in my mouth...I feel this garlic piece on my tongue.  FRICKIN' GROSS!!!!  Just to make sure I squished it between my fingers and it was FRESH GARLIC.   Now I don't know if maybe the garlic fell in the ice or the dude (which for now remains nameless-depends on  what the manager says tomorrow when I complain since he is not there right now)  if maybe the dude just smooshed garlic before making my drink.  Regardless of any situation......it is just plain GROSS.    I will update my review after I speak with the manager tomorrow.   I am furious since the place is quite a drive.    Now I gotta find another FILIPINO EATERY."}
{"text":"The BBQ pork skewers are BOMB. Perfectly salty, sweet and meaty. There's a little bit of fat for those who don't like that but I personally like some fat so it's not too meaty. The sauce is great with the rice, The service is great and the restaurant is really clean and big. 10/10 would come here again."}
{"text":"I think the food is great, but the server is not. We went there yesterday, ordered 100 pcs.pork bbq and 50 pcs.shanghai. When the server gave us the tray of bbq, I asked for a vinegar. Her response was \"we don't give vinegar for bbq.\" I was surprised by her response and was actually thinking what kind of a Filipino are you if you don't eat bbq with vinegar. So anyway, I asked for container instead so I can put vinegar in it. She gave me 1 small container so I asked for another one. She said \"we only give one container per customer.\" So I told her \"we ordered worth $100+ of food from you and you can't give me more than 2 containers for the condiments?!\" What the hell?! What kind of response and service is that!? I wonder either they have vinegar shortage, or container shortage. Either way, that's really stupid and dumb. Shame."}
{"text":"There seems to be a lot of choices in the area, but if you feel like authentic, good tasting food, visit this place. I was very pleased with both the service, look and absolutely the taste of the food. The kabobs, which is what me and my little cousin had were so juicy and delicious . The whole fried fish was a good choice and also my grandmother had no adobo to spare ....that's all I'm saying."}
{"text":"Thought I'd try a new Filipino restaurant in town, but I left very disappointed.   Arrived at the restaurant and was immediatley greeted by the staff. We ordered the two meat plate wth pancit, pork adobo, and rice. When we asked for lumpia, we were told there was none left and to try again during lunch time. Next problem was that my girlfriend's pancit was cold, so the lady asked us if we wanted it microwaved. When we answered no she threw it in the trash, and gave us some more. The pancit was slightly warmer, but not much. The pork adobo was tasty, but all of the floating fat made me lose my appetite a bit. Rice was a little mushy but the banana lumpia was delicious! I also appreciate the lady not charging me the credit card fee to buy water.  The restaurant had plenty places to sit but there were some serious sanitary issues. When I went to throw our food away, I noticed both trash cans were overflowing with garbage! I could not believe it. And being honest, I had to use the restroom before I left. Unfortunately for me I had to go #2 and there was no toilet seat! Unacceptable!  Fiesta is a lot closer to me than other restaurants, with cheap prices and big portions. However, with all the sanitary issues we noticed, I'm skeptical."}
{"text":"Quite greasy but cheap, easy, and in company of the ever incredible Mr. San Miguel!"}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in, we instantly got the \"your not filipino\" look.  This was followed up with a 5 minute wait of me just waiting there and being ignored. There were 3 people working on this Friday afternoon.  Two workers that seemed to be in charged of cooking and preparing the food, and what I would assume is the supervisor, all whom looked like they weren't busy.  After looking at the food selections (I had 5 minutes of being ignored) I looked at my wife and said \"Should we just leave.\" This was when the \"supervisor\" decided to help us. Got my order, everything was fine and then i made a comment about their pig blood meal.  I knew exactly what it was and called it by it's name, \"dinuguan\" At this point the supervisor decided to give us a chance and start to ask us all these questions about how filipino we were.   My wife said \"my mom is filipino\" she replied \"you don't look it\" Once again that age old tradition of \"you not filipino, no service for you\".   The food was okay... not the best but to deal with that kinda of service,  I'll go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Sooooo yummy! Really like the shanghai rolls & free  serve yourself water!!! Its cafeteria style."}
{"text":"It was my sons baptism after party and we needed some quick filipino food that wouldn't take all day. I heard great thing about this place and its right down the street. We ordered two orders of krispy pata, an order of pancit, an order of kalderata and all there turrone. It was 15 minutes, hot and tasty. Food was delicious and service was friendly.  Many filipino restaurants that I've experienced have really bland tasting food. That is probably made in huge, huge pots. But there are a couple great tasting filipino restaurants in LV and I'm glad. I am a fan. Thank you."}
{"text":"The people here are so AMAZING, including the customers. I have never had a bad experience with the food or staff here. The food is so yummy you can't stop eating until you are ready to pop. The Adobe is one of my favorite with the lumpia. I now can say I have all my coworkers hooked on going here throughout the week."}
{"text":"This place falls squarely in the A-OK range. The food we had ranged from decent to subpar. Specifically, the Adobo was pretty bad. The Kare Kare, Bopis, and Kaldereta were decent. At least the people were mostly friendly and they put up with our large and somewhat loud family group (because kids).  I'm mostly going with A-OK because I've had better food at the other Fiesta Filipina locations. This one really was just OK."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today. The place is brand new; they are still setting up all their decorations. Well, maybe that's their Christmas stuff.  Anyway, it's your standard Filipino buffet-style layout. It was $5-something for two items with rice. I went with Menudo and Sinigang. I'm a bit of a quail egg addict, so when I saw all those quail eggs on top of the Menudo, I was sold. Unfortunately, I only got one. Boo. Both of the items were as good as I would hope. I also got their Melon drink (cantaloupe) and it was delicious.  I like the decor of the place. It feels friendly, inviting, and clean! They have a couple of TVs in the back - one for you to get your TFC or GMA or whatever fix and the other was playing ESPNews.  I like this place enough to return. It's a good drive from work, but it's on my lunch list.  3.5 stars (Sorry Teri C... I'm going to start biting your style... when necessary)"}
{"text":"My go-to dishes are the pork sinigang, pancit, lechon, mungo beans, and pinakbet. In that order. The dishes tend to be a bit on the greasy side, but the overall flavor of the dish is still there. They tend to speak to you in Tagalog if you look Filipino, so if you're Ilocano, brace yourself. The food lines goes by pretty quickly, unless you order something that's from the kitchen. They recently expanded the front area so there are more seats."}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge * 94/100  Cantaloupe juice.   Can you say thirst quencher?  I've been to other location before for when our Filipino food cravings kicked in but have to admit I like this one better. It just seemed brighter and more authentic. The colors and decos gave the buffet-style restaurant a more festive atmosphere.   My friend and I didn't get a chance to stay too long. We were in a hurry to get to a dry cleaning place and get some clothes so we basically had our orders in - 2 cantaloupe juices! - and made a run for it. The drink felt like summer in my mouth with a touch of sugar to compliment the natural fruit flavors.   Just so you know, this was hand made and it was not the only option. There was also calamansi and lychee juices! Guyabano and buco (coconut) were packaged in a drink box so I'd assume they're sweeter with added artificial flavors.   Couldn't forget how great the place smelt as we walked out to the door! Hoping to come back for a real meal one day!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Food is good and the price is reasonable. When I order over the phone for pick up, they're ready right away."}
{"text":"This local spot is decent if you're looking for some Filipino food on this side of town.  I came for lunch and had the two item combo with a side order of pancit to share with the group.  The BBQ chicken was not bad, it had a pretty good flavor to it.  The stir fry vegetables were okay, it was pretty salty for my taste.  You do get a decent portion of rice, about two scoops.  As for the pancit, it was pretty good and not too oily.  The dining area itself was pretty clean and lots of room to sit to eat.  Overall the experience here was decent, but nothing memorable that stood out.  A good spot to come to when I'm craving Filipino food in this area."}
{"text":"BS +  We ordered the HALO-HALO Special here and boy was it HUGE! It was enough to be shared by 3 people.  It had all the stuffings and fillings.  My only qualm with this place is that they give it in a cup that is hard to mix and you end up dropping all the corn flakes and other yummy on the table.  Not cool!!!!! NOOOOO!!! MY ICE CREAM!! Either way this place has a good repertoire for their food.  I didn't bother tasting anything because the waitress behind the counter was super pushy with us buying food and it turned me off.  I understand you are trying to sell your food but calm down lady! All I want is my halo-halo! They have a lot of other take out options as well as desserts by the front door.  This place is big enough for parties.  It's worth a try.  Maybe I will come back for other foods but from what I see I think I'll just come back for more halo-halo but this time I'll bring my own salad bowl.  Location is CLEAN, PROFESSIONAL. ORGANIZED Staff are SMILEY but PUSHY! Parking lot is SHARED and SMALL Restrooms CLEAN  * Boomsauce scale. BW = Dis $@% is BASURA! (Garbage). Not recommended. BS = it's just O.K. (experience) BS+ = Yo! I like this place. BS++= That's Whoa! This place good. BS+++= Dayumm! This place is fkn DOPE!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure - I'm not Filipino. However, my girlfriend is and I have eaten plenty of Filipino food over the years and I adore the food and the culture.  WOW. I have to say, I was really impressed with the food at this restaurant. I was quite impressed with the selection of traditional Filipino dishes.   Food: I got the Pork BBQ, Crispy Pata (deep fried pork leg), Sinigang and the fish chips of course. The serving sizes were very generous, affordable prices and most importantly DELICIOUS Filipino food!  Service: The staff was very nice and the owner made me feel like family.   Décor:  Is very cozy with that homey touch.  I can't wait to come back to this place (when I'm back in Vegas) for some good Filipino food. Scrumdiddlyumptious!!!!   A must try!"}
{"text":"My wife ordered food at noon for a baby shower and told them we need it by 4:30pm. I come to pick up the food at 4:40pm, and they haven't even started it yet. I asked an employee how long it would take... her response after looking lost and walking around was \"I'm sorry sir, do you have any errands to run?\" Really? No, my errand is to pick up your food so I can feed people. I was already annoyed with this place, but I think this is the last time I go here."}
{"text":"Sorry to only give two stars.  Our primary home is in San Diego and we go to Erlinda's (previously Conching's) and their Filipino food is excellent with healthy portions and very consistent delicious recipes (we know as we go there often).  Fiesta Filipina Cusine  pales significantly to Erlinda's.  First of all, they a bit stingy with portions not only on rice, but with their \"ulam\".  Their prices are higher with very small portions.  We didn't mind initially about the portions but when we returned a 3rd time, their adobo (both chicken and pork) did not taste like adobo.  They doused it with sugar along with some tomato base--almost like a menudo more than adobo,,.it was very undesirable for the palate.  After this incident, we decided not to go back.  We are now looking for a better place to go.  Sorry, but we cannot recommend."}
{"text":"I've gone a few times craving something like KARE KARE or pata etc.... Always reheated, or not available you get the \"stare\" and the prices for each thing sucks! I give it two stars because at least they tried to establish something decent but fail to follow through with quality product."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, not that much of a selection though. Just your ordinary favorite Filipino dishes and then some. Nothing too different that will blow you away.  I would recommend this restaurant to people who definitely miss some good ole Filipino food.   And or for people that if it's their first time trying Filipino food. I would start here for sure.  Pretty good service when I went and it wasn't too crowded so there were a lot of empty seats to seat my family and I and just enjoy.  Pricing is pretty decent and affordable.   Definitely going back sometime in the future."}
{"text":"Pretty good pork sticks. They put a lot of meat on the sticks. They aren't made to order, so they lose some of their crispy and caramelized meaty and fatty bits if you were to eat them freshly grilled.  Get the two bbq sticks and and rice combo for $4 and some change. A decent way to get full when you are strapped for cash.  The lumpia I got was a little over fried with not a lot of fulling in it.  Cheap and pretty decent cafeteria Filipino food."}
{"text":"This review will solely reflect the customer service I received. After getting ready to pay for my food, I realized  soup should've been included in my meal. I kindly asked, and the lady at the cash register called to the other employee who had been helping me. Here's where it took a not so polite turn. The lady who had helped me muttered something to the effect of \"Really? She wants soup too?\" In my knee-jerk reaction, I looked at the cashier and apologized! She was obviously stunned I understood and responded with \"No it's ok, she's crazy.\" She (annoyed employee) was clearly agitated after hearing my request. Oh and yes, she was saying this in Tagalog. Clearly, she didn't realize I understood. I may not look Filipino (but I am) and I may not speak the language, but I can understand every word. Here's a tip... before you complain about a customer in Tagalog, please make 110% sure they don't understand, or better yet, don't complain about a customer. Not sure I want to come back.."}
{"text":"Omg yes! I love this place, been living down the street from Fiesta forever. Glad I decided to stop here, the food is delicious and the price is super affordable. Ate here 3 times this week already"}
{"text":"Growing up in San Diego, Ca.. Specifically in National City, I was spoiled with having MANY options to get good Filipino food.  Fiesta Filipina Cuisine has a typical ambiance of a Filipino restaurant. They have a decent selection. Service is typical of Filipino toro toro style restaurant. Not the greatest, but it'll do for those cravings I may get for Filipino food."}
{"text":"This is a great place for filipino food. The prices are fair and they are always busy at lunch. I have always come at odd times so I avoid the line as much as possible. I come here for the BBQ chicken kabobs and lumpia. They are really to die for. My whole family consumes them like candy. The only problem I ever have is that there are no signs indicating what each vat of meat and sauce could be. For a non-asian like myself, its be hard to know what these dishes are just by sight. Unfortunately when you ask and are told what it is, I still don't know what it is.   Regardless, this place is my top filipino food find and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good meal."}
{"text":"I normally do not like going to filipino restaurants because I've been to many and it just isn't like home cooked food.    I decided to go to Fiesta Filipina because it's just a block away from my work and I had to have that filipino food fix.  OMG, this is the first time I had filipino food that tasted like it was home cooked.  I loved it!  The sinigang was awesome!  The BBQ Pork was to die for!  The pork adobo was yummy!  I loved it!  The only problem I have is it's too close to my work and I now I'm going to be craving filipino food more often.  Gotta try it!"}
{"text":"We had the pinakbet, kaldereta, and fried chicken. Pretty good, though I've tasted better. This place is better than Kusina ni Lorraine in my opinion though.  Only complaint is the service. The lady serving us was giving off a bad vibe and was muttering under her breath when we told her we wanted our food to go. Felt like we were an inconvenience to her."}
{"text":"I tried this place out because one of our friends ordered party trays at their party of the Pork Adobo, and it was a hit!  We wanted to see and try this place.....  Location -  very interesting - tucked away and not easiest to find  Decoration  - very simple, but comfortable and large enough to have large parties.  Food - more buffet based, what is cooked is in the large aluminum trays on heaters, so this is what is available. If you go at wrong times, you are not going to get what you may want.  Menu - Good Selection, but based on what is already cooked.  Checked out the selection of baked goods available for sale too.    Service - You are served at the food line and they know their stuff and will let you try some things. Ask questions and they are very helpful.  Overall, nice place to try out filipino food, and the food quality is good for sure.  I just found it to be very salty for my taste, and a bit on the expensive side.  However, I will try it again for sure."}
{"text":"Came in to grab something to eat before I start my long shift .. It's already made for you but yet takes 15 mins to get my halo halo? Like are you serious ?? I finish eating and I still don't have my desserts smh .."}
{"text":"The flavor was good. We order Barbecue Pork and Barbecue chicken, Pancit,  and little fried egg roll looking things. All were tasty, however the chicken was cold. Not didn't stay warm on the drive home, cold. All felt like it was left over from yesterday.  One bite I took had a sour, off taste. My tummy a been weird for a couple weeks so I can't blame the food, but it does hurt tonight.  Luckily we were taking it home because it was ICE COLD in that place! Really freezing like a walk in.  So now I'm confused. Not sure I'll go back, but enjoyed the flavor. It was early but we were the only ones anywhere near the building.  There's so many places nearby, I'll try some of those before risking ptomaine poisoning."}
{"text":"Very nice staff. I like the place it's nice and big. The food was great specially the palabok and turon. They do take credit cards so need to worry if you don't have a cash."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot because it was close to my house, the food was pretty decent, and the employees were friendly. In the past year, the quality of the food went downhill. First, certain food items are more watery than it used to be. Also, the food does not taste as fresh. The one thing that made me stop coming here was because the last three times I ate here, I experienced bad stomachaches. Also, their portions are small for the amount they charge. Be careful when you order things that have bones such as caldereta. They will give you a couple of pieces of meat with large pieces of bone......and that's the only thing that would fit in that small container. Its a rip-off!! It's so not worth coming here."}
{"text":"So so good! Great hearty food that will sate any craving, great prices too! We got 4 BBQ skewers, chicken curry, and beef mushroom with a whole box of the noodles for $25, enough food for 2 with leftovers! Super friendly and helpful staff as well, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This probably is the best Filipino restaurant I've been too. Usually, I don't really crave or want Filipino food because the other places I've tried have been alright. I always thought it was more appetizing to look at but lacks in taste when you actually eat it.   This is a fast food type restaurant where most of the food is already prepared sitting under heat lamps. Some stuff looked very adventurous and exotic but I recognized the staples like lechon, pork and chicken skewers, adobo, Pancit etc.  I got the combo with a beef stew and lechon. My friends ordered a bunch of different things and we all shared. We also ordered the crispy pork Patta. I loved the lechon here. The skin is so crispy!!  The pork is a good mixture of fatty and juicy. People who don't like fat won't appreciate it but I definitely do!  The beef stew I got was really good too. It was flavorful, although a bit oily, but the meat was tender and not stringy or dry at all. Loved it. I also liked their Pancit and meat skewers too. The Patta was huge!  It was really crispy and comes with various sauces. I prefer the Lechon better because the skin was crispier and the meat is more tender.   What I didn't like was all the food was super oily, and the halo halo was a big disappointment. The ice was shaved very corse and they didn't put a lot of condensed milk so it was like eating ice with jelly in between bites. Could have done without it.   All in all I would definitely come back for the lechon!"}
{"text":"Wow! New favorite Filipino restaurant. The food is great! Strongly suggest the chicken and beef adobo! Shanghai lump is are great as well. The staff is SO friendly to top it off, I can see myself as a regular here. Mmmmm"}
{"text":"Ok.... So being Filipino myself, I was expecting a home cooked meal. I came here long time ago with family so its been a while since I ate here. Let me tell you my experience just recently since we came back with family. The staff is awesome but the food could have been better. Let me just say....to my disappointment, I found a hair in my longanisa. I was already diving into my 2nd one and before I could put the piece in my mouth, I saw it dangling from my spoon. (BARF) I lost my appetite after that. The whole reason why we came there also was my Mom was craving Ginatan. They ran out and all that was left was whatever they had sitting in the pan (which wasn't much) but it was like it was just sitting out all day. (This has happened before because my brother goes there and ordering the ginatan is a hit and miss) We ordered it BTW, my mom was pretty dissapointed. Also, the Turon seemed like it was a day old, It didn't taste fresh but my son loved eating it anyway lol  I think this place could have some potential. I just wish they didn't run out of food and it tasted fresh."}
{"text":"If you like poor customer service, dirty restaurant, and bad food then this your place! I can't believe this place is still open. Their cashier is so rude and is always giving her customers attitude and dirty looks. If they have been in the business for a long time, then they should know that their customers are the only reason why they are still in business! So why treat them with such disrespect? SMH! Oh, and don't even get me started on the food. Their beef Caldereta is filled with fats, and no meat. If there was 0 star, then this place for sure deserves it."}
{"text":"Food are good...your typical Pinoy Food...clean and decent space...but Pricey...what I mean is...they give very little amount...ate here...the sinigang was literally 2 spoon full and 2 cubes of meat in a little styrofoam bowl...like I said food is good..your typical pinoy food...but stingy and pricey..."}
{"text":"Today was the first time I've visited Fiesta Filipina.  A friend at work suggested we try this place for lunch and being that I'm Filipino, I thought, well why not?!  When we got here, I noticed that there was a huge spread of food behind the counter.  Reminded me of some Panda Express, Filipino style.  I saw a lot of my favorites, like Pinakbet (most common pork \"stew\" with fish sauce and veggies such as bitter melon, eggplant, okra, tomatoes, etc.), Sari Sari (what I'm used to is similar to pinakbet without the bitter melon and add small dried shrimp), Dinaguan (blood sausage) and Adobo (today's choice was chicken).  They offer a  2 choice combo with rice for around $6-$7.  Here's what I got:  Choice 1:  Lechon- Crispy fried pork chunks.  To me, food is better when there's more marbleization.  In this case, lechon is PACKED with fat.  I think it's a great thing, but if you're not used to it, might be a turn off.  The lechon has a very crispy skin with lots of fat, topped off with tender pork meat.  They serve this choice with a sweet lechon dipping sauce which ties the meal very nicely together :)  Choice 2: BBQ Pork skewers.  Sliced pork, kabob style, grilled and drenched in a red, sweet BBQ type sauce.  This was great choice because of the BBQ/Grill combination.  They have a chicken skewer if you choose that route.    AMBIANCE:  The place is packed with food.  Food everywhere.  Desserts, snacks, business cards.  Everywhere you look there's something new.  A little busy in my opinion, but something I expect from my heritage LOL.  There's a back part of the restaurant that looks like a very cheesy bamboo hut with the words, \"mabuhay!\"  Must we be so cliche?! LOL.  For the price and the amount of food you get, it's definitely worth it.  I haven't even begun to crack the surface on the amount of the choices they offer.  I will definitely be back to sample more delicious entrees."}
{"text":"I went here once around lunch and it was not bad. I had some BBQ skewers and kare kare and both were cooked right. Definitely hit the spot and was quality.  However, I don't think it's good to grab later on in the day....a few days ago I stopped in starving...since I needed to get groceries at 168 and I'd pass out before I can make it home to make dinner. It was at night maybe around 7-8 and I don't think the food has been changed at all and didnt look fresh so I walked out and went to a sit down Chinese spot instead. Bummer. I have been craving filipino food, but not when it's not fresh.   So if I'm around early, I'll stop in for turo turo....if its late at night I'll have a go only on their cook to order crispy pata.....mmmm always a wonderful heart clogging treat and made to order palabok."}
{"text":"Love the food over here at this location. Mostly getting to go orders when theres no cooked food at home. I love their specialties like the crispy pata and sisig bangus! Those are my favorite! must try! Staff is friendly and never had any problems with everything."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!! As authentic as you can get!!!  Atmosphere is family oriented and the staff is fabulous!! If you want great Food this is your place!!"}
{"text":"Anytime were craving crispy pata this is where we come. Huge shanks of pork deep fried and served with a soy vinegar sauce. It's super yummy but not something we eat all the time so when we eat it this out favorite spot to get it at. They also serve typical Filipino dishes you can order a plate or ala carte. They also cater so you can order trays for your party's or gatherings. Perfect for when you don't want to be standing by a deep fryer frying lumpia all day. Just make sure you gets some bbq on a stick with some pancit. That's my fav ;)"}
{"text":"Recently move here in Las Vegas. Been to a few Filipino restaurants and this one thus far the best tasting."}
{"text":"Fiesta Filipina is a great restaurant to try filipino food.. When I am here i usually order the BBQ pork with rice for only $5.95 and i usually get a side Lumpia Shanghai for like an extra 4.95.. If you dont like those they have all kinds of filipino dishses form veggies to pork, beef, to longanisa.. I really love this place cause its a quick in and out place and love how its located near my house. This place is located across St. Rose Hospital on the corner of St. Rose parkway and Eastern..  Try now if your interested in tryinging filipino food!"}
{"text":"What happened, this place went down hill after they opened another branch in Durango. Durango is wonderful, but this place ...... first wanted the BBQ stick at least warm, it was cold, I bought my daughter a snow cone but it was hard as a rock, gave it back to the new cashier and she didn't even refund or exchange it. $2.15 , didn't really care about money but employees are starting to be shady and bad customer service. Where are the old employees. Oh by the way my daughter birthday. She just wanted to get some snack here. Well karma will probably hit them back. Durango has better food and better customer service."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. The service was awful. The servers were not friendly. The food was cold and most of the food (\"their specialties\") aren't even available! I've been to a lot of Filipino restaurants in Vegas but this is just disappointing."}
{"text":"I was stoked when my sister in law mentioned that a new Filipino restaurant opened so close to home. We decided to check it out last night. I haven't visited their other locations so I wasn't aware this place is \"turo-turo\" (cafeteria) style, basically you just \"point\" or tell them the food items you want from the ready made entrees they have. Selection was plentiful from the popular lumpia shanghai (eggrolls) to pork and chicken bbq, kare-kare, dinuguan, pinakbet, beef steak etc. Of course they had lechon which was really good. Great meat to fat ratio and crispy skin, nothing worst than a fatty and soggy lechon. Even at near closing time, the food all tasted as if they were just cooked not too long ago. But what excited me the most was they had Jeprox, what is that you ask? As my husband describes it, an abomination! Lol it's those dried fishes that they fry and are so stinky but ohhhh so good! You can't get any more authentic and local than that!   They have several combo variations but the most popular one is the 2 entrée with rice for $6.99 which is comparable to most Filipino places. They also have items you can order ala carte like Sisig and Crispy Pata. An order of Lumpia is $5.99 for 15 pieces. For dessert they have Halo-Halo, Turon (banana lumpia) $0.99 among others.  The place is clean and inviting, much like dining in your own home. The staff is friendly, courteous and efficient in taking orders. It's nice to finally have an option close by when you're craving Filipino food but mama isn't in the mood to cook. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Family and I came in today for halo halo - I've got to say WORST halo halo ever. We had to ask them for sugar to add because it tasted like water.  The lady that brought us the sugar threw it at us. My sister had to ask her if there was a problem, lady said no my face just looks like this all the time. She never asked us what the problem was or if there was anything she could do to make us happy.  I am very disappointed at this place and won't be coming back. There are way too many Filipino places in town to put up with this kind of service."}
{"text":"They microwaved my chicken BBQ and pancit in plain sight. I have no idea how long it has been sitting there. But I've been here previously and the BBQ was cold. Either way is gross compared to freshly grilled BBQ."}
{"text":"This by far is the best Pinoy restaurant I have ever been to.  The selection is great, and everything was fresh.  I definitely recommend the pork bbq skewers.  Also the Halo-Halo is delicious."}
{"text":"Everything is pre cooked and dry.. Its crazy most Filipino people are used to very cheap ingredients and they don't know quality. The food was disgusting. I've eaten at least 20 different Filipino families homes this is not even mediocre."}
{"text":"Love this place! Doesn't feel like some typical Vegas spot.  The vibe is chill and the ambiance is equally chill.  I stopped in for some takeout.  We ordered chicken skewers and Shanghai lumpia.  Let me tell you, both items we ordered are AWESOME!  Perfectly flavored and prepared as one would expect.  This restaurant is more of s mom and pop place and I like that.  The food is prepared and set out almost like a buffet style.  The staff on the other side serves it up and then you pay.  Very efficient system.    They don't have drinks on a fountain so it's either in cans or bottles."}
{"text":"Crispy pata 5 stars! Sisig Bangus 3.5, lechon kawali 5 stars! BBQ was awesome! Ginataan yummers! Services very fast, location perfect for Henderson ;D"}
{"text":"As much as I love this place and their food they need to ADD another cashier pls pls as it's super slow and I've been waiting for 30 minutes in line to pay for my food!  I mean it's 2018....pls pls add another cashier and they shouldn't be touching food if their handling $$$ they will be fined by the inspector soon!"}
{"text":"Better than average Filipino fast food place. Only thing sucks is that Filipino food is always over priced. For 2 ppl my mom and I spend almost $30 for lunch on a 2 item combo with a spring roll.  Food was really good though.  Flavor was good not to salty."}
{"text":"If you've had great home-cooked Filipino food growing up, this is eh to ok. Sorry but I rather have the ilocano way of cooking then this style of cooking, tagalog or visayan? Who sweetens their broth for bangus (sp?)?! The adobo was too oily, the pancit was eh and the chicken papaya was ok. Sorry maybe because it was new year's eve and they were cranking out food like crazy,  but the only thing good was the rice and banana lumpia. Sorry I've tried bite after bite hoping it'll get better but it didn't. Maybe I'll try the pinakbet or balatong next time."}
{"text":"If you need a quick bite of Filipino food this is the place to go. Clean dining area quick service from my visits there. Had the dinuguan it was a little too salty for my taste. Veggie lumpia was delicious. I recommend to come early when the food is fresh."}
{"text":"Not bad for cheap and quick meals. Place was pretty empty when we ate dinner. Food was ok. Yes, just ok. Nothing crazy and nothing compared to home cooked Filipino food but good enough for a lazy meal to have. They have a few items for sale (chips) and honestly it was very overpriced.   You can get a 2 entree with 2 scoops meal for $6.99. Portion was good for two people."}
{"text":"Fiesta Filipina is a hidden gem in Henderson. It just happened that we decided to spend a couple of nights here before we check in to an extended stay hotel in Las Vegas during our recent move from TX. So my mom was craving some good Filipino food near the end of our road trip. Fiesta Filipina was the closest to the hotel so there we went.   The place was a decent size if you compare it to a typical \"turo-turo\" restaurant. Plenty of chairs and a couple of TVs were seen airing local Philippine news and soap operas. Nice inviting traditional decor. Plenty of parking as well. The staff behind the counter greeted us with warm smiles and asked us what we want in rapid fire Tagalog. I can understand why non-Filipinos can be a bit intimidated upon entering the premises. There was a Caucasian couple behind us who couldn't decide what they want right away, and the staff quickly shifted gears to explain the dishes as best as they can.   (On that note: I can't understand why they don't provide a sign next to the dish so it'll save them the time and trouble explaining things to those who are unfamiliar with Filipino food? I've lived in California for nearly 8 years and nobody ever does this! A simple index card with basic ingredients can be a quick solution)  Let's move on to the food. Crispy pata (roasted pig) - flavorful, crispy, delicious.This is a good dish to share with a group of people.  Pansit (rice stick noodles w/ pork belly strips, veggies, and shrimp) - good flavor, the veggies were not soggy and just enough saltiness Dinuguan (pork blood stew) - I don't eat this but my husband had rave reviews. Pork/Chicken BBQ skewers - great flavor w/ good amount of meat on the sticks Lumpia (fried pork spring rolls) - decent, only because my husband makes the best homemade lumpias :-) Sinigang (tamarind soup) - above average; sour enough with generous servings of (your choice of fish or meat here) Ginisang Munggo (sauteed mung beans w/ pork belly & other veggies) - yummy! Kare-kare (oxtail soup w/ peanut sauce) - very good  The prices are more than fair. We recently brought our aunt and her friends here visiting from Maryland and for a group of 10 people you can expect to pay $120 including drinks with plenty of leftovers to take home. If you liked the soups, you can always ask them for a complimentary second serving (without the meat) just like we do in the Philippines (\"Kuya, pahingi pa po ng sabaw!\"). I thought the overall ambiance was excellent, and they checked in on us once or twice to see how everything was. There is also a pastry/bread cart by the entrance where you can try various sweets such as pastillas (sweet milk candies), polvoron, mamon (french sponge cake) and yema.   If someone would ask me where to go for a taste of good Filipino cuisine, I would not hesitate one bit to point them to Fiesta Filipina. It is the next best thing to home cooked Filipino meals."}
{"text":"If you need a quick Filipino fix and you're in this area, this is the place to go. They have the typical Filipino dishes like lumpia, pork or chicken BBQ, pancit, lechon kawali, chicharon, etc. For braver souls, they have dinuguan and goat caldereta - I'm not one them. If you have a sweet tooth, try their mais con hielo, halo-halo, turon, fresh cantaloupe juice, boba tea, etc.  They also have pre-packed snacks and desserts like corn nuts, cracker nuts, shrimp chips, Filipino junk food, maja blanco, puto and many others. What I normally get include chicken/ pork BBQ, lechon kawali, lumpiang Shanghai, and mais con hielo. You can also special order roasted chicken (lechon manok...manok = chicken) which is pretty good.  I only like getting food here to-go. They have the TV on Filipino channel and it's pretty loud and annoying. It's nothing fancy. The decor is cheesy."}
{"text":"Some of the best Filipino food in Vegas! Super authentic and awesome tasting dishes. They have such a huge selection of entrees and desserts and their Halo-Halo is one of the best I've ever had. We were undecided as to what to have for dinner so I'm so glad this place is right down the street from us. Basically 5 minutes away! Their portions are generous and their staff is very polite and welcoming."}
{"text":"If you're looking to get some authentic Filipino food, then Fiesta Filipina should be on your list of Pinoy places to try out.  The decor was quaint, wooden, and very reminiscent of traditional Phillipine household decor. I really liked the vibe of this place; the staff was all friendly and ordering went smoothly.   It's a turo-turo place (tagalog translation: to point), so you basically point to the dish you want to order and then you pay at the end of the line. It's an easy way to try a lot of different foods in one place, to be honest. Don't expect super fancy dining either, what you see is what you get -- traditional Filipino dishes.   I had the two item combo plate which comes with steamed rice and two choices of entrees. I picked the sinigang na bangus (milkfish in a soup that has a tamarind base) and the classic Filipino beefsteak. What a good deal because it was under $10!  The portioning for the sinigang na bangus was one fish steak with some soup, but they could've thrown in some veggies other than ginger. It had the superb sour taste, which means they put the right amount of sampalok (tamarind) in the soup.  The beefsteak was PERFECT! It had the strong kalamansi taste (more citrusy) which went well with the tenderness of the beef and sweetness of the white onion. It really was marinated to the right taste... It's making my mouth water just thinking about it! It's THE perfect pairing to your steamed rice. The steamed rice, however, was a little more on the wet side, which isn't ideal but still good to eat.  This is a good showcase of Filipino heritage. The kind of food they have out is the kind of food you actually have to (and want to!) try within the Filipino food realm.  Oh, and they have good BBQ skewers! Ang sarap!"}
{"text":"We always come here to eat in or eat out. Not much of vegetable selections but their food taste great. Will be back here often."}
{"text":"Ventured out since we're into the neighborhood.  Pansit is different than I'm used to but I eat it up.  A little greasy for me but so are the Chinese chow mein nowadays.   Food is not served hot but again it's like getting to your friends house a few minutes late.  Ha.ha. Will be back again.  I always prefer my wife's home cooking but today it's a break.  Another ha. Ha."}
{"text":"The food is delicious, its like they have captured a couple of filipina grandmas and got them locked up in the kitchen.. LOL I say yes to all the dishes, very delicious, you have to try the food here. Thanks for coming out to the south west side of town FIESTA!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few more times since my previous review and I am still a fan of this restaurant. The staff is nice and I love that they speak to me in English now when I walk in. In the past, when they spoke to me in Tagalog, I would feel a little awkward because I didn't understand. Yay, no more awkwardness for me!  The food has always been consistently good. I can say that I've never had a bad experience such as a stomach ache after eating food from here and that is what keeps me coming back. I always get my usual which is the rice with two barbecue chicken, pancit, and shanghai lumpia. I thought that the lumpia was a little overcooked on my last visit but the barbecue chicken and pancit were perfect.  I usually come around 2 pm and I noticed that it's not super busy but they do get a steady stream of patrons."}
{"text":"The Panda Express of Filipino food......not bad but not extremely good...but hits the spot when you are in a hurry and want some not so healthy food =)  It's a pick and choose your meal type of place with an assortment of things I honestly can't identify.  My go to generally is the pancit (rice noodles) with bbq skewer(either pork/chicken)...just the way I like it low on vegetable, high on protein!  Other items that are good...the beef stew, some days much more tender than other days...so consistency is definitely a little off.    They have a huge assortment of fried goods....make sure you ask before you order...one onion-ring looking item turned out to be fried intenstine...phew....good thing I asked instead of frontin' like I knew what it was ;)  I like the turon....what is there not to like about a fried banana egg roll with a sugary glaze on top."}
{"text":"After my recent trip to the Philippines, I can say this deafly feels like home, with the cleanliness level. 3rd world atmosphere  but with an amazing third will taste. Just wish the had the same smiles  they had in the Philippines."}
{"text":"This place is quite aways from the Strip but it was well worth the drive. Food was very good but a couple dishes were not to our liking, that is the reason for four star rating.       The service was very friendly and helpful. Restaurant was very clean, especially when compared to other Filipino restaurants I have been to..  BBQ chicken kabobs were the best as well as Lentil beans."}
{"text":"I'm so glad that this location opened up. As much as I loved going to the original one in Chinatown, this location on Durango and Warm Springs is a lot bigger and cleaner.   The staff is always so friendly, and the food is amazing. My only gripe is that they only give you one stick of BBQ if you order it as part of your combo. Sometimes a girl needs at least 2! And as much as I love their kare kare, I wish it had a better meat-to-tripe ratio. There have been a couple of times when I only had all tripe in my kare kare. Other than that, I love coming to this location whenever I am having a craving for Filipino food and am too lazy to make it myself."}
{"text":"Fantastic Pilipino cuisine! Extensive variety. Multiple locations in Las Vegas area. Great customer service."}
{"text":"I always come here for the Caldareta (best in town)! The Pancit Palabok is great too and don't forget to try their Halo-Halo for dessert. I also recommend this for a quick take-out but sometimes the line can be busy."}
{"text":"Instead of cooking filipino food stop by here and get your fix.  Whenever I am needing some home comfort filipino food I just stop by Fiesta real quick and satisfy my cravings for whatever I was in the mood for.  Their diniguan is always on point and they always have so many choices to choose from.  Check daily cuz some items change and aren't always there."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go to when I'm craving for Filipino food, and I'm not quite yet ready to head home from school.   I always get their 2-Item Combo since it's really cheap (around $6) for a lot of yummy food! I've tried their sinigang (ask for some soup on the side!), chicken/pork adobo, chicken & pork bbq, bistek, lumpiang shanghai, beef calderata, crispy pata, and their chicharon bulaklak. I've always left happy and full whenever I ate here or ordered food from here. The food does end up on the oily side though -- which is why this place only gets 4 stars.  My favorite here has GOT to be the crispy pata. Good for the tummy, bad for the arteries. Haha! I love eating crispy pata with just rice. Yum, yum, yum! I always bring my out-of-town peeps here!   Their place is clean and obviously their ambiance is very Filipino (duh!). I felt very \"at home\" here and their service is always nice and friendly.  Definitely going in for some more.. And more.. And more! :)"}
{"text":"Because of Nelson Q's review of Chow King with a picture of halo-halo a few days ago, I knew I had to try this dessert. I couldn't get my sister with me to try it after school, so I was going to need to find a place in Henderson that served this stuff.   After my bizarre experience at Goldilocks, I remembered that there was a Filipino place I had wanted to try by Saint Rose - Fiesta Filipina. With my 5 & 7 year old siblings in tow, we headed on over.   Although my mom lived in the Philippines with my grandparents and I'm a very adventurous eater,  these kids don't eat very \"ethnic\" foods. My parents don't expose them to ethnic foods so I try to be very encouraging when it comes to trying new things. I ordered one halo-halo for the three of us to split. The people behind the counter were very accommodating, and made sure we got our order in.   There's a $.50 charge for using your debit card if your transaction is less than $10. That's probably the only thing I didn't like. The place is clean, and I like the layout. My siblings were watching some Filipino soap opera that was on - I didn't care as long as they sat down and weren't loud. They told me they liked the chairs \"because they are bamboo.\" Okay. :)  Ah, one thing I wish is that I ordered the halo-halo sans azuki beans. I know from eating them at Matsumoto's in Hawaii that regardless of the type, I hate beans, including jelly beans. This one came with both azuki and some sort of white bean - which were left at the bottom of the glass. Other than that, and the fact that the red and green gelatin had no discernible flavor, my brother and I liked the dish. My sister only liked the ube ice cream. They both wanted me to buy more of just the ice cream portion, but I'm not sure they offer that.   I asked my sister if she wanted any of the other desserts. I was planning on getting an ube pie for $5.99, but she couldn't make up her mind so we left. If I knew I wasn't going to have to pay another surcharge for using my debit card, I probably would have bought it.   Will I be back? Yes. Although judging by the dirty halo-halo bowls above the trash can, you can tell it's a much bought item, I'd like to try some of the actual dishes next time."}
{"text":"I love Dinuguan. I've had my fair share of different recipes, explored countless restaurants and have yet to try one that made me stop what I was doing and write a yelp review until now.   *pause (eating more food)  The Turon, the Halo halo... AWESOME!  Ladys and gentlemen, I have found my new favorite place. Fiesta Filipina is a step ahead of every Filipino eatery in the Las Vegas area period.   *back to eating"}
{"text":"Not really my fav place to go but it is decent. My taste in Filipino food is different whenever i eat here. Other filipino restaurants style of cooking their food appeals more to me."}
{"text":"I didn't have a good first experience here but I was on the way home and stopped by for pancit. It was very good with a lot of noodles and meat. I also had 2 very tasty banana desserts and the customer service experience is great and they are all very friendly and accomodating. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"What a great place to satisfy cravings for Filipino comfort food!  I had the guinataang lanka and the laing with a pork barbecue on the side. So so good! Everything was so flavorful with the taste that rekindles fond memories of excellent home cooked Pinoy cuisine. Special mention to the laing which had really good vegetable \"al dente\" texture. Best laing I've ever had! This is definitely my go to place in Vegas for Philippine food. Prices were reasonable too!"}
{"text":"The rice today was a bit undercooked, but they were quick to rectify the problem. The upo was delicious as expected, although it could have been more, the pancit tasty, dinuguan was wet Tagalog style, there was ample meat in the BBQ pork skewer. The Halo halo was great. MORE SERVINGS would make us come more often."}
{"text":"The people who works here sucks! My daughter didn't want water with lemon so I ask the cashier lady if I can get water with no lemon she told us that I have to buy a bottled water.. seriously? They serves cold food!!"}
{"text":"They don't serve breakfast. You don't see my face right now, but tears are flowing. Why? Because I live and breathe off of silogs. Especially after a night of barely any sleep, the comfort of eating a filipino breakfast with garlic fried rice, eggs, and tocino will bring you back to life. I'm not even exaggerating.  And being 15 minutes from the strip, I think I would advise that they add breakfast to the menu. HOWEVER, I was still satisfied with my meal. I ordered the inihaw la liempo and a crispy bangus off of their 2-item deal. You get a hefty amount of rice along with it for only $6.99. So cheap!   I hear their crispy pata is to die for, but we had so much food already we chose not to order it. So do me a favor? Please try it for me."}
{"text":"Wtheck happened to this place?!  :(  Been going here since I was a teen and I always make sure I visit when I am in town. Why because I loveee their chicken BBQ stick, kare kare, and turon. Lets just say the quality of food has gone DOWN!! The rice is so watery or in other words MALATA. This on its own makes you lose your appetite. My kare kare was full of bones! I mean come on!!! Now the turon is just ok but not as good as I remember. Truly sad that they have changed..oh well what can you do =\"}
{"text":"Good stuff nuff said. I never leave this place with out a happy belly. =)"}
{"text":"Food: The typical stews and stir-fry's are good, but I have to recommend the Barbecue. You can see them grill it behind the counter. The meat is tender, and the BBQ sauce is really good.  Service: Cafeteria style. Don't expect much.  Ambience: Typical Filipino fast-food asthetic: tacky."}
{"text":"Been going to this place many times & I really love their foods.  BUT, an incident occurred last week that made me change my mind about this place.  A customer behind me complained that his BBQ chicken stick is cold.  He brought his whole plate to the counter and the server took the BBQ chicken out of the plate. She placed it back in the pan full of sauce with the other BBQ chicken sticks (ewww)! My sister & I looked at the server w/disgust!  Instead, of throwing the BBQ chicken stick that the customer probably touched and bit (how else would you know it's cold, right?), she mixed it up with rest of the chicken that other customers will order not knowing what just happened!  I never thought this food chain will be unsanitary!  We told them they should throw it away but they didn't do such. My sister & I will never eat here again!  Talk about cheap; they're being thrifty!!!"}
{"text":"Very good and inexpensive! It's a small authentic place where everyone is kuya and ate. You'll get all your fav Filipino dishes here! Good stuff!"}
{"text":"It's a hot or miss here.  The adobo, pancit, beef  dishes are fairly decent.  Sometimes, you'll get a scoop of boney meat and hardly any protein to keep one satiated.  Just under $8, I can get a 2 dish combo with rice good for a decent lunch.    I would advise against any seafood items they have to offer here.  It's just not a good idea for seafood to sit for long periods in warmers.  I have tried the squid and again stay away.    Per usual, the meats on skewers are too sweet to my liking, but the majority would beg to differ.    They charge a nominal fee if the order is under $10 or $20. Not a big deal if you're ordering a larger meal. Conveniently located in the same plaza as Dogsupplies.com and Home Goods, there's plenty of parking."}
{"text":"I saw some good review and bad review on this place, therefore, I took my family to try out the place. I was a bit disappointed to the quality of food. I ordered palabok and it was cold, and it does not look freshly made and seems like it was made last night and placed in the fridge.The dinuguan is not great, but just ok because I have tasted better on some other place. Lastly, even the rice is mediocre, for the price of the food, I expected more. One more thing, their pancit is sooooo dry."}
{"text":"Disclaimer:  This review is written by a non-Filipino....  I have eaten at Fiesta Filipina three times now.  The first time I was there, the pancit was the best I'd ever eaten, and the BBQ chicken was just marvelous.  I am a sucker for pancit, so I ate it the next 2 times I was there...but something had changed.  The 2nd time, it was so full of big celery chunks, that's about all that was in it.  The noodles were a lot thinner than before (and clumped together), and I literally had 2 small pieces of chicken in it.  The 3rd time it was better than the 2nd, but still not as good as the first time....I guess it depends on who makes it.  Also on our 3rd visit, my BBQ chicken was very cold.  My husband likes their lechon (sp?), and has had it twice.  He has also had the sinigang, and I tasted some.  (Honestly, I like my hubby's better, but he said it was good).  The fried plaintains (not sure the proper name for them) are wonderful!  Overall, I think (other than the pancit), that their portion size is just a bit on the small size.  Taste:  Pretty good, but some consistency issues.  The place looks very nice, although we have always gotten our food to go, so I cannot comment on how comfortable it is.  Will definitely go again.....but am losing patience on the consistency of their pancit."}
{"text":"It's our first time staying in Henderson and found this restaurant. Very very accommodating!!! Happy tummy!! Delicious food and excellent service. Thank you Ms. Alma and Sir Rey. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"My first time to try Fiesta, We ordered 2 small tray pansit palabok and it came out great and the price are better than others, The palabok is goood !"}
{"text":"Food is good for me, what is lacking is good customer service.  Could use a little hello or good morning, goes a long way peeps.    I'll give it another try as I want to support our kababayans."}
{"text":"Fiesta Filipina (compared to 2 or 3 other Filipino food places we ate at in Vegas) turned out to be 1 of the better restaurants to go to in Vegas, for Pinoy food. I felt that the taste of the food here was 'closest' to home. I ordered fried milkfish with rice, & it tasted like the milkfish we eat in Pinas :) We went on a Sunday & most of the people eating there were Pinoy. It was packed, just like any other food place (on a Sunday) in Manila."}
{"text":"Nothing beats homemade Filipino food and Fiesta Filipino fits the bill! Food was fresh and not overly salty. Portions were generous and prices are very fair. Kare Kare had real ox tails in it, not the fake beef bones that some restaurants use. Pancit was fresh, nilaga had lots of veggies and meat, the eggplant torta was cold (my only complaint) but it was still good. The turon was crispy and full of banana and we even ordered Halo Halo for dessert. Everything was in point and I can't wait to go back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The best place to get Filipino food!!!  Been coming for the past 7-8 years when we're in town!  They now serve Lechon Liempo my favorite.  Their Lechon is the best I've tasted since the Philippines!!!  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurants sits at the corner of St Rose Pkwy and Eastern.  It has decent Filipino food and the staff is friendly.  I like the fact that they have decent and clean accomodations where to eat and that TFC is playing on all the big screens around the establishment.  You have to spend at least 10 dollars to use your CC but if you are with more than one person, that shouldn't be an issue.  I haven't tried their catering but their lechon and bistec were on the money."}
{"text":"I was first introduced to Filipino food by a friend of mine back then. Then I resumed my interest on it after my girlfriend.   So when it comes to a Filipino buffet, I think, this is by far the most flavorful joint. They also have a bigger variety compared to others at a fairly low price. I'm hooked.   My favorite entrees to get are the corned beef, fried bangus, steak bangus, chicken curry, beef steak, lumpiang shanghai, and turon. I can see why my girlfriend would feel nostalgic every time she's here because it seems a tad bit like home. The servers are generally friendly as they're eager to serve you similar to that of someone who is inviting you to eat their home cooked meal.   At the same time, all the meals I've tried were flavorful to taste. I'm told they're not the best per se. I guess Filipino food is one of those meals you really have to eat home cooked-style? Apparently this culture is very big on it. Nonetheless, I can't complain because I keep returning from time to time even if it's just a bite for a turon. Yum!"}
