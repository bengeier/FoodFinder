{"text":"I've been going to Ming Cheng since the mid-90s, and it's barely changed in that time.  I've rarely ventured from my standards because every time I've ordered something different I haven't liked it as much.  Pork lo mein, pork fried rice, egg rolls, and wonton soup can't be beat (just get the combo).  The fried wontons are worth an extra hour at the gym the next day.  A friend swears by the pork egg foo yung (with pork fried rice of course).  They're not heavy-handed with the soy sauce, and you can often see someone cutting up fresh vegetables and meat at the back of kitchen.  With that, it is what it is - it's a strip mall Chinese take-out place.  Portions are very generous, prices are low, ingredients are fresh, flavors have been consistent for a long time even with new cooks rotating in and out.  No, the owner isn't friendly, but she keeps the cooks on task and gets you your food quickly and correctly"}
{"text":"Not the most exceptional of cuisine (this is a strip-mall, Americanized take-out place... what do you expect??), but consistent, quick, and nicely priced. I have been coming here with my husband since 2009 fairly consistently, and I have never had to wait for more than 10 minutes or had to correct any mistakes with the order. I am a vegetarian, and they have a small but decent selection of vegetable-based dishes (tofu as well, if you're in the mood). The presumed owner (the woman who seems to be staffing the counter 12 hours a day, 7 days a week) is not the warmest of individuals, but she is definitely efficient. Maybe it's because I am not originally from the midwest, but I don't think it is necessary for every person in the service industry to be over the top nice/friendly. That being what it is, she has come to recognize my husband and I. She even smiles when she sees us now (I SWEAR!), and is friendly about giving us extra sauces, etc. So, not the fanciest of places, but a definite regular on the Kent dining rotation."}
{"text":"So it was late, it was raining, and my boyfriend and I wanted Chinese food. After calling several places who were not willing to drive five minutes to deliver, we decided on this place. It was a pretty dismal experience. I've had my fair share of bad cheap food...I used to eat at a place called \"Tasty Goody\" and god forbid when you're desperate and hungry it was BOMB. Tasty Goody is questionable and grease-laden but leagues better than this place.  This place might be cheap, but you still pay too much for what this is. I don't even know what it is. I have never eaten food before and legitimately worried that the meat was something they found in the alley until now. I guess it was chicken but it tasted like fish and had a really unsettling texture. I was worried I would be sick after eating this because it looked that shady.   We had a lot of leftovers and I usually like leftovers, but this time it was just a chore that took up fridge space and got tossed a few days later. It was truly dismal. I picked at the mu shu chicken which was the most palatable thing we ordered, but even that made me nervous. All of the food had so much grease and oil in that it turned into a gelatinous mold once put in the fridge. I didn't expect much, but I didn't think it would be that bad. I wouldn't eat here again if you paid me."}
{"text":"Food was awful, I ordered the orange chicken for carry out got it home and my chicken was sitting in a pool of water. Also my white rice was undercooked, why does Kent not have any good Chinese?"}
{"text":"Not very friendly. I ordered from them before and got food that had hair in it. I asked for a refund and they gave me a lot of crap about it."}
{"text":"They have good food that is well worth the wait... My wife and I get the garlic chichen :-D. I will say that you just have to be patient for it. They have also improved on their customer service providing better customer interaction."}
{"text":"Food sucks now after the authentic Chinese place opened last year in Kent, they basically gave in. People are nice though."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, and good food. This place is actually quite popular. That may be attributed to the food being cheap, made fairly quickly, and tasting pretty good. For a quick bite of Chinese food, it's not bad, it won't blow your taste buds away by any means, but it's serviceable. I personally like to order their fried dumplings when I'm in a hurry. They are huge, size and potion wise. Definitely worth it for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Not a very good place to get Chinese food. The taste is okay but not as rich as I expected.."}
{"text":"Came here to the complex for haircut.. just wanted to give a shot for Chinese cuisine.. I've ordered wings which were like average.. not as we expect in other places.. and even ordered chicken fried rice.. never in my life I had such fried rice.. rice was totally drenched in soy sauce.. not satisfied!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Chinese food in town. I myself am a huge fan of the crab rangoon. I don't know what it is about those things but I love them. Their General Tso's and Shrimp with Lobster sauce is also to die for."}
{"text":"Ming cheng isn't even worth 1 star. First of all, they're incredibly rude. I understand that they probably get their share of rude college kids so they're a little cranky with the rest of us, but they act like everything you do is a burden to them. The food quality is also extremely questionable. I'm not a picky customer, but on 2 separate occasions we ordered chicken that tasted like fish. It's very affordable but that's the only thing even remotely positive that I can say about it"}
{"text":"Horrible food... Doing laundry at Laundry 101 and decided Chinese food sounded great after seeing it as I walked in.  First experience, the lady, who I assume was the owner, was on her iPhone in a what must've been a very interesting conversation to ignore a customer for 5 minutes as they just stand there.  I got fired rice and a vegetable chow mein and they were both disgusting.  $9 wasted on overpriced chow mein that looked and tasted like vomit.  Do yourself a favor and go to Subway instead."}
{"text":"this place is authentic, the ingredients are fresh, and the food is hot. i always get chicken and broccoli and it's delicious"}
{"text":"Great for take out Chinese and always extra delicious. Sometimes the service is abrubt but it doesn't seem to be unfriendly - just cultural. Good size portions and you can order your food, get a treat at the Acme and get back to pick up the food in 15 minutes.  If you call to place a pick up order, give them your phone number - it's all they need. You can dine in - it's a very small cafeteria-style place so groups would be a bit much."}
{"text":"Best crab rangoon I've ever had.  It is called \"fried crab cheese\" on their menu and it is cream cheesy-crabby goodness in a crunchy fried wonton wrapper. Mmmm...yes please! Their Lo Mein is also pretty fantastic.  Vegetable Lo Mein and General Tso's are my go-tos!  I've tried some other dishes and just never liked any of them but I don't need variety from Ming Cheng when my go-to options are good!"}
{"text":"I really liked the food and it was fast. I had the sweet and sour chicken and the fried wontons. I loved it all except the sauce for the sweet and sour chicken. I thought it was going to be a little bit better"}
{"text":"I got delivery and ordered sweet & sour chicken. The chicken was the standard chicken that all Chinese delivery places have, but the sweet and sour sauce was like warm orange jello that tasted like water. No joke. When I called to order, their phone was buzzing which made it even harder to understand the lady who was already hard to understand. Next time I'm just going to make an effort and just go to Evergreen for Chinese food because this stuff was gross. I feel super gross and sick now. #Regrets"}
{"text":"I've had the take-out here a few times. Nothing terrible, but definitely not that great. Just a humble Chinese take out joint located in a grocery store plaza."}
{"text":"This is one of those, you get what you pay for situations. I'll admit, all I ordered was the won-ton soup & it wasn't bad but it wasn't worth making the out of the way trip for either. The woman behind the counter is definitely not friendly but my food was hot , and fresh so I really can't complain."}
{"text":"Their general tso's is fantastic, their soups are fantastic, they have the type of crab rangoon I like (Come here if you like cheesy kind more than sweet kind), their egg rolls that come with the meals are fantastic... it's typical chinese fast food, cheap and plentiful, and their pork fried rice lasts a day as long as you don't refrigerate it and dry it out.  If you're on a budget and want chinese, one could REASONABLY eat 3-4 times off one special that has fried rice and an eggroll included.  If you're a little more voracious like myself you only eat 2-3 times though..."}
