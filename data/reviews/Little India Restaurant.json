{"text":"I have to say that me and my friend liked the food a lot, but the service was really bad.  There was a nice couple from the Cayman Islands and they also were commenting on the service.  The servers pretty much ignore you until you practically throw yourself in front of them for attention.  But even though the service was horrible, the food was really tasty!  Try the \"Meat Combination\" for 2!  Def give this place a try.  This was a great place to eat, for my first time in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I love this place....It is always my first choice when I'm in the area. My favorites are the vindaloo and the palek paneer but everything I've tried has been delicious.  The service is great.  They are always busy when I've been there but the food comes quickly, and if you let the guys know if you need anything they will help you out."}
{"text":"Some of the best Indian I have ever had! This place was excellent. The ambiance was inviting and cozy, the service was great, and the food was delicious! I had the vegetarian combo and all of the dishes were yummy. Some of the best eggplant I have ever had. I haven't been to any of the other Indian places on Queen Street, but I admit that it will be a hard sell to get me to try anywhere but this place now!"}
{"text":"Food was decent but the delivery guy was a total creep. When I called to order he was sounding very strange on the phone making moaning noises. When the food arrived I made my boyfriend go to the door to get the food and he was asking how the pretty girl was doing tonight etc.   This was the first time we had ordered from there so I'd never met any of the employees - it was just plain weird. Certainly enough to never order from there again.   GO TO or CALL TRIMURTI next door - the food is fabulous, best samosas I've ever had and they also deliver. Dal Makhani is also a winner."}
{"text":"Health hazard... with terrible service.   1. The Chicken Tikka served was RAW. The inside was beyond pink. I'm shocked it was served it was so clearly undercooked.  2. The water glass on our table was broken and sharp  3. Half my plate was dirty from the previous meal 4. Asked and waited repeatedly for wine. You'd think after the above incidents we'd never be without beverages...  Concerned this place lacks quality control. I'm scared what would be found in the kitchen.  Visited Feb 20 2016"}
{"text":"If you are a fan of Indian food you MUST try this place. One of Toronto's most popular Indian food spots; they are often lined up out the door and onto the street for their lunch buffet (11:30am to 3:30pm). The food is truly amazing - every dish is a flavor experience. In fact be warned that once you've tried their fabulous butter chicken, no other restaurant will ever compare!!! I would go here repeatedly for the food alone, but as an added bonus, their staff is the most friendly and courteous that I've encountered in my 8 years of living in Toronto."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST Indian I've ever had. A friend and I discovered this place after wandering around for 2 hours trying to find something good and without a massive line. We hit the jackpot.   I ordered chicken tikka. She ordered butter chicken. We split rice and naan. (They do not come with the food automatically). After ordering a waiter passed by with the most amazing smelling, sizzling dish. To the wrong table. We were actually saying how much we wanted the dish.  Guess what - it was my chicken tikka!  The food was so flavourful and moist. The chicken in both was nothing short of perfection. The naan and rice were obviously good as well. But well, I would (almost) like to see a place screw those up!  The service was spot on too. Never have I been greeted by so many members of staff.  I'll be back during my next trip for sure!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had just gotten back from a day on the island we were starving and looking for somewhere to eat, having heard some good reviews of little India we decided to try it out ourselves. I have never written a food review or felt the need to until now. This place is AWFUL, do not go here, march yourself right out the door and deal with the hunger and try and find somewhere else to eat, but god man whatever you do- do NOT eat here!  To begin with our server kept looking at the back of the resto every time he was talking to us, not once making eye contact. My girlfriend was asking him some questions about the menu which he would shrug off or answer with a \"ya mm hmm\" which lead to some very misleading ideas to what we were going to order. We ordered the meat combo for 1 and an order of the Malai Kofta and an extra nan. For the price of everything the portion was mediocre, and the quality was lacking in every way possible. The lamb was so over cooked that I thought I was eating cartilage, extremely tough and sand dry. The Butter Chicken was a joke. The chicken was only white meat and was once again over cooked, my girlfriend pointed out to me that the sauce for this dish tasted exactly like it was made from Cambell's tomato soup, same deep red colour and ketchup-like sweetness. It tasted like a college student drunkenly tried to make yesterdays chicken, tomato soup and his whatever spices he could find. The Malai Kofta was literally flavourless! This is normally one of my favourite dishes that is super rich in flavour and spice and packs a bit of a punch heat wise. This was so mild, the flavour was pretty much obsolete and the dish just became a texture, but even that was somehow mangled, what are usually round or oval shape holding dumplings were instead doughy mushy and indistinguishable from the gravy of the dish. For $40 bucks you're better off taking your business to somewhere like Banjara or Moti mahal."}
{"text":"This was our fourth time ordering from Little India.  Even though the vegetable pakora and the onion bahja are soaked in grease, and there is too little papadam and it always arrives broken up into little pieces - the entrees are so good that we overlook those shortcomings.  We mainly choose to order from this restaurant however because the price is about $20 cheaper overall then the average Toronto restaurant.  Unfortunately next time I'll be ordering from the pricier Bombay Palace or Indian Hut - these are places that are tried tested and true - plus you won't have to deal with the hassle of Little India's terrible customer service. On a snowy night it took 2 hours for our food to arrive, which we understood. However, when it did we discovered that our chutney and pickles had been forgotten (but we had been charged). We called the restaurant right away, and I asked the man who answered if the driver could come back to deliver those items while he was still in the area. The man stuttered, said that the driver couldn't come back and that we had to call Justeat. I knew that the notion that it was Justeat's fault was ridiculous as the items were clearly on the bill. If I was in this man's shoes, I might have offered an unhappy repeat customer a credit. This man offered nothing. Since he didn't, I told him that we wanted what we paid for to be delivered, or we would be sharing our poor experience online. He said to go ahead if I wanted, because they were doing the best they could. I'm assuming that this wasn't the restaurant owner I was speaking with, as this man didn't seem to know much about customer service or accountability. Too bad, as Little India will now be losing about 2 orders a month from this customer. If this is Little India's \"best\" - well, perhaps some Customer Service training is in order... Or I suppose they'll lose the customers who don't appreciate their \"best\". Spend the extra $20 and order from Bombay Palace or Indian Hut, and save yourself the hassle!!"}
{"text":"Service : ok (one waiter was very helpful, polite and responsive, other waiter had to be reminder couple of times)  Place : ok (nothing too fancy, fairly good ambiance, A/C working overtime - most people wearing jackets)  Prices : ok (around $25 per pers. with a beer)  Food : Below average (meet was too dry, butter chicken was probably the most indifferent I have tried, veggies the same, best thing were the appetizers)  Overall: if you are hungry and passing by, why not, drop in. If you think of making reservation better try something else. We had left overs and did not bother to take them home. (I could only comment on the a la carte menu)"}
{"text":"I love indian food theres alot of flavour and spice in every dish! I would recommend trying their lunch buffets for 11.99 i believe. Also, the naan goes very quickly. Grab a couple while you can! And mango lassi :)   Happy eating!"}
{"text":"First visit   started with onion bhajia which were served with a tamarind sauce. Very tasty, the best I have had in Toronto, but the ones I get in Montreal are better.  For mains we went with chicken Vindaloo and lamb Rogan Josh.  I like hot and the Vindaloo  was hot, probably at my limit , but still  very tasty  with lots of chicken pieces. The lamb was very good with a very rich sauce.  We had garlic Nan with the meal that was very nice, flavourful without being too greasy.  We will be back.   supper for 2  including two beer for $50."}
{"text":"Yum.  Ordered the vegetarian combo and the meat combo and the food was waaay too much for two people.  However, we did give it the old college try. Each of the dishes was flavourful and delicious.  The staff is always quick to refill your glass of water."}
{"text":"Service: Friendly staff and they were patient in answering my questions.   Ambiance: Restaurant is made up of two room packed with tiny tables, but still cozy and warm.   Food: There were 3 of us so we ordered the Meat Combo for Two with some extra Naan. The waited allowed us to switch the Butter Chicken with the Vindaloo ( but we actually ended up ordering butter chicken later on as well, just to try it).  The Sizzler: The meat was delicious! My favourite was the shrimp and reshmi kebab! The flavour permeated the shrimp and it was insanely tender, and the kebab was well cooked and seasoned.   The rice pulao was nothing worth noting. The naan was really good- and according to one of the guests the highlight of the meal.   Our vegetarian option was chickpea curry, which was mediocre. The curry lacked dimension, maybe a squeeze of lime would have helped. Mind you, I am indian and also comparing it to the chickpea curry I get at home.   The chicken currys were the real disappointment, both of the curries were overwhelmingly sweet. The vindaloo was way too sweet to be called a vindaloo, and also the flavour profile was very similar to butter chicken. The butter chicken, was also like dessert, resembled the vindaloo, just with added cream. Both currys were just alright, but a disappointment for a highly rated restaurant.   Probably will go back if I am with someone who is trying indian food for the first time and we are in the area as the restaurant offers safe choices, but never for myself or with my family."}
{"text":"I've been to the lunch buffet twice, and the food has been consistently good.  I appreciate the fact that they make some entrees actually spicy and some mild to appeal to a broader audience, and that their food is not overly salty.  There are enough items for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.  My favourite was the saag paneer, which was fresh with good texture. Naan was good as well.  Nice dessert selection with traditional items (gulab jamun was not too sweet!), and 4 ice cream flavours to choose from. Butter chicken was way too sweet for me.  I strongly dislike it.  Why add so much sugar to chicken?  Overall, it was good fresh food and good value for the price.  We will return after we recover from this food coma."}
{"text":"The BEST lentils I ever had!!!   We ordered other stuff... it was all very good...  But after eating the lentil I just can't remember what else we had.   Soooooooooooo Goooooooood!!!!"}
{"text":"its not the best but it was ok i did not enjoy their butter chicken too sweet for some reason"}
{"text":"I stopped by one day after a Jays game for their chicken vindaloo. I was a bit hungry so I ordered the It After all, The Naan and briyani were nice and light and had a delicious taste with buttermilk cream."}
{"text":"Great Indian food, loved the buffet. I definitely plan to keep coming back, but I do find the menu on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Food was decent. Good menu. Service was lousy - waiter kept forgetting things. It's a busy place, which means the food must be keeping people happy - but my food came out too fast to really be fresh. The stuffed man though was excellent."}
{"text":"came back here after a few months and have to say its as good as ever, maybe even better if its possible. the lunch buffet is the best thing on a cold day, service is amazing, so are the prices. i cant stop going back!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to for Indian food here in Toronto. Really, you can divide this place up into 2 categories: The Buffet, and The Dinner.  I've done the buffet more than a dozen times, and the dinner only once.  Buffet:  Everything you'd want from an all-you-can-eat buffet.  Their flavours are typically fantastic, with a variable menu to keep things interesting, but strong attention to keeping the core basics (salads, butter chicken, saag, pilaf, pakoras, naan).  It's seriously good, and the waiters don't have much to do here, so they're typically just filing water and being polite and courteous-- which is something they excel at.  The Dinner:  It was super busy that night, including hosting a wedding on the first and second floors, and thusly we were seated on the third floor.  They were obviously under pressure, but we didn't mind waiting a little extra time as the place smelled incredible and everyone was very kind.  Within 10 minutes we had appetizers, and within 35 minutes, we had our enormous orders of nearly everything on the menu.  For three people we really went overboard, but it didn't break the bank.  The food quality was very high, the flavours rich and the aroma was splendid.  I've never done the dessert outside of a few pieces of fresh fruit, but everything I've had there has ranged from  good to great.  While it may not be the best indian food I've ever enjoyed, it certainly is some of the best indian food I've experienced here in Toronto.  If you're debating going, give it a shot.  It's a great place that should have you coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Meh-meh food, therefore 3 stars. Good ambience, good to sit down and have a conversation. Complimentary poppadoms were soggy. I ordered chicken biryani which had good presentation but it was soo mehh. Naans were hot, steamy and fresh though. They got their naans right!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant.  I go there all the time and bring everyone I know and they all love it.  The food is spectacular, the service incredible (you will not go more than 2 minutes with an empty water glass) and the price is excellent.  On the weekends they offer a special for 2 for $32, how can you go wrong? I always get this and I always have leftovers for the next day.  If you've never been, try it and you will never go to another Indian restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to Little India Restaurant with a friend on a Friday night. There was a small wait (not even five minutes) and the place was busy. The food on every plate looked amazing.   Wait times and service were a little delayed for our food, but it was completely worth it. I had the vegetarian Thaili with three vegetarian curries, all were fantastic, and my friend was fighting me for my raita! She had the Chicken Korma and assured me it was just the right blend of curry and sweet. It smelled FANTASTIC.   This is a good, consistent restaurant. You won't have a bad meal."}
{"text":"Definitely my favourite Indian place. It smells absolutely delightful and you will not find better service anywhere. The servers are unbelievably polite and attentive.  Your water glass will never be below half full, which I appreciate when eating food with a little kick to it.  That being said, most dishes are sweeter and less spicy than other Indian food, making it friendly to people who aren't used to spice. Pricing is very fair, especially if you order the combos/platters, which have large portions.   The ambiance is quaint with very interesting art on the walls. Very clean and welcoming. This would be a great place to introduce someone to Indian food if they had been so unfortunate as to somehow avoid it thusfar."}
{"text":"My coworker and I were starving after a day of flying from SFO to Toronto, and we decided to walk over from the Westin Harbour Castle to one of a few Indian options.  We walked over to another place, but finding that to be more of a quick meals kind of place we opted for Little India instead (we were expensing the meal, so we figured we go for something that looked nicer).  I love Indian food, and I figured that with a decent sized South Asian population in the city we would get some Indian food.    Keep in mind that we were both starving, but we were underwhelmed.  My coworker ordered the mutton rolls and the combo meat platter.  I ordered a mulagatawny soup and a chicken saag.  The mulagatawny was tasty - kind of like a Middle Eastern lentil soup, but with chicken and spice.  Everything else was only ok - not as flavorful as I'm used to getting in San Francisco.  Somewhat bland actually.  And the mango lassi I had was watery - more like mango juice with some ice in it.  The service was good though."}
{"text":"Although the service and ambience was satisfactory, the food was not so amazing. The butter chicken was very sweet for some reason, something I am not accustomed to in this typically savoury dish. I personally did not enjoy it. The peas and potato vegetable curry was great though, nice and spicy and full of flavour. Perhaps my expectations were too high in the quest for authenticity?"}
{"text":"Food is delicious! We ordered the meat combo and everything was perfectly spiced and cooked well. The best grilled tandoori chicken I've had in Toronto, yet. The service was pretty good even though they were about 40mins away from closing when we arrived.  Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Went here last night.  By far the worst Indian food I have ever tried.  Its not authentic food.  The butter chicken is extremely sweet and does not taste like butter chicken.  The parotta roti is awful and not really roti.  The paneer is bland.  Everything seems to be for non-indians who have no idea what anything should taste."}
{"text":"Long time customer ..been a fan for at least 14 or so years. I always went to lunch early when I worked nearby because there were always line ups. Went back for the first time in years and took my 8 and 11 year old the quality of the food is the same they have expanded their space and the service is still quick. The kids and I make the trip down town a few times a year and this is their favorite restaurant. The best thing is the spicy food is spicy and wonderful. The kids are in love with the butter chicken."}
{"text":"worst india buffet i've ever tried. everything was extremely watered down. maybe it's because i had the lunch buffet during rush hour.."}
{"text":"This resturant was my very first Indian food I have ever tried and I loved it and I've gone back once more. Both times I have gone are for dinner, and the resturant was completely dead. Having no people there made the dining experience more romantic in a way, but I couldn't help to wonder why nobody wanted to eat here.  The service is beyond great, and it is the reason why I have gone back.  I have never had such nice service, ever. They take their time to explain to you the items on the menu and reccomend you plates to your preferances.  The waiter never lets your glass reach even half empty, and they seem like very hard working people. They deserve good tips.   We ordered the dinner for two and it was amazing! So much food we could barely walk afterwards. Very good deal.   To be honest, I have never really eaten at any other Indian cuisines, but even if others taste better or whatever, I think this place gets a 5 star for their excellent service."}
{"text":"This little place is BIG in taste! Get a reservation because this place is small for the number of people it gets every night (yes, even weekdays). The first time my friend brought me, we waited for 2 hours for a table on a Saturday night... it was very hard, but TOTALLY WORTH IT.  I've been there for the lunch buffet a few times, dinner a couple times and even brought my family for my birthday dinner.   The service is incredibly friendly (though they fill your water a little TOO often). For my birthday, a table of 8, they made ordering super easy and offered up just baskets of all the naan flavours (I still like the plain naan though), and all their rice flavours too! All of it was fantastic! Everyone loved their food! Also, my friend goes so often they never fail to give him and his guests a free dessert!   Their butter chicken is yummy and a little on the sweet side, their pakoras are decent (little greasy), their vegetable korma is yummy... Actually, I haven't really found anything that isn't great. Well, aside from their ice cream...that was a little disappointing but usually you don't have space for it anyway.  The price for dinner is a bit pricey but the buffet makes up for it!  Overall, amazing."}
{"text":"Food is very bland with no notable amount if spice. The chicken was like chewing gum. The place is very crowded but only because of lack of local options and low price. Service was okay..."}
{"text":"This is the best Indian food in the gta.I haven been going here for the last ten years. Try the butterchicken and chicken madras. If you are not sure just try the lunch buffet. 5 star for Sri the owner."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and thought might as well try this place. Everyone said it was amazing... Well we didn't agree.  We (non-Indians) have been eating Indian food for all our lives. We ordered samosas and two main dishes and found them to be bland and lacking spices. After explaining that it was lacking flavor the waiter started defending the food and saying that not everyone likes it strong. The service was not amazing either. So definitely would walk 100 meters further and go to the other place which was better in the best."}
{"text":"Great food at a decent price. Four of us ate for $70, which included a price fixe special and a couple extra dishes. Hearty tomato butter chicken, rich aloo gobi, great matak paneer all made for an interesting filling meal.   The atmosphere was a little dark for my liking but that is quite usual for the cuisine I've found in this city.  The service was extremely diligent and the wait staff was prompt and friendly. I would definitely recommend this to people who aren't too picky about their flavors, as the tastes are not strictly authentic. But it definitely is delicious and that counts more than anything."}
{"text":"In my opinion this place has the best Indian buffet in Toronto. Good location, great food and price, the ambiance is decent and the only problem is that sometimes there is a line up and you have to wait a little, however it's worth the wait as this place is very good. Highly recommended ."}
{"text":"Ok, this is the BEST Indian buffet I've been to.  I live in Southern California where we have lots of great Indian restaurants but they aren't this good.  The food is very fresh and very good.  The restaurant is clean and the staff friendly.  DON'T MISS IT!  It cost $11.95 and is well worth it."}
{"text":"The servers were very polite, attentive, and accomodating, but unfortunately that's about the only redeeming factor. I ordered the Lamb Rogan Josh ($13.50) and Naan ($2.50), as an order of naan or rice not included in the price.  I may have been spoiled with too much good Indian food from spending a summer in Delhi, but objectively tasting, this dish was subpar. There have been other positive reviews from Yelpers so this could be a one-off experience or just not their best dish. They also messed up several of our bills, adding items we hadn't ordered or mixing up different orders. We were a group of 10 and paid separately, but I have rarely found that to be too large to manage! Overall it was a little disappointing and too disorganized for my preference. I was glad to be out of there after the meal; the heating, dim lighting and burgundy walls just didn't cut it for me."}
{"text":"Palak Paneer was flavourless and contained almost no paneer. Butter chicken was the worst I've ever had - covered in really sugary tomato sauce. Rogan Josh was good. There are many great Indian restaurants in Toronto. This is not one of them."}
{"text":"One of the worst restaurants I've ever been to! The food tastes like crap, and was cold. Very bad service, and all staff are clueless and careless. Never going back and advise you to not come anywhere near this shit hole."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet here is fantastic! The decor is comprised primarily of red and gold, and showcases a lot of Indian influence (yes, it's strange to say, but I've been to other Indian restaurants where the decor was not so reflective of the cuisine/culture). The seating can be a little cramped here, as it is a small place.   The food is fantastic, I love it. The lunch buffet has a great number and variety of dishes. The palak paneer (my favourite dish) was really tasty as was many of the other curries. They were also good at not letting any of the items go empty.  The service was wonderful, friendly and patient. As an example, during my girlfriend and my lunch, a group of six came in. A waiter asked us very politely (and apologetically) if we wouldn't mind moving to another table so he could combine our table to accommodate the group. We agreed to move and not long after we sat down at our new table he brought us both a complimentary mango lassi. We didn't care about moving and weren't expecting to get a drink, but we really appreciate the attention he paid to us.  I really like this place as it has a comfortable atmosphere, and the lunch buffet is opened a half hour longer than the other Indian lunch buffets around! (Be prepared to forgo dinner after having the lunch buffet!)"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant because of the great reviews, unfortunately it wasn't as we expected.  we ordered the spring rolls, was a good portion about 6 peaces for 5$ and it was good but I think you cant mess up spring rolls! For the mains we ordered the prawns tandoori (dry).A lamp karahi tasted like a leaver. vegetable baryani was not fluffy as an indian rice should be. The service was ok I guess .  The place smelled like some aromatic herbs but I think a restaurant shouldn't smile like any thing but food or clean scent ."}
{"text":"Little India is a little gem of a place right in the heart of Queen Street West. The restaurant expanded when they bought out their next-door neighbor India Palace. So now there is even more seating available. We've eaten here on a number of occasions and the food was always delicious. We usually start with a few sides to get our appetite going. One of our favorites is Eggplant Bharta, which is a tasty blend of eggplant, tomatoes and onions in Indian spices. This dish is simply amazing. I never even knew I liked eggplant so much but after tasting this dish I'm completely sold. Our other favorite side dish is Aloo Gobhi which is a blend of cauliflower and potatoes cooked in a tomato sauce flavored with ginger, garlic and Indian spices. This is another hit. Little India's Chana Masala is also amazing. It's a chickpea dish that's cooked with spicy tomato ginger sauce. This is always my go to dish.   For our main dish we usually opt for Chicken Tikka, Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala or Butter Chicken. All of the mains are so flavorful they literally melt in you mouth. Chicken Tikka is our absolute favorite. The way the chicken is prepared just infuses it with that distinctive Indian flavor. The Tandoori Chicken just falls off the bone and into your mouth. Chicken Tikka Masala is a great combination of that flavorful chicken tikka with the gorgeous and aromatic masala sauce. India Palace's Butter Chicken is exactly what you would expect; a buttery goodness. And to complement our dishes we usually get some rice, naan or garlic naan. You also receive a complimentary serving of Indian Papadum, which is a thin, light and crispy seasoned fried dough. It's lovely as well. And if we still have room after all that, the sweet delight of the Gulab Jamun may seduce us further. It's an Indian dumpling served in sweet and sticky sugar syrup. Yum Yum Yum! We keep going back for more and more. And we always try to bring a friend or two along so they too can experience fine Indian cuisine. This place prepares dishes with loving care and it shows in their satisfying portions and flavor.   My only criticism would be that service could sometimes be a bit slow. On other occasions service was prompt. But we won't hold it against them. Little India is our favorite Indian restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"Went with a larger group (approx 7 people) and was not disappointed. While the restaurant looks small, the dining space is larger than expected. The dim lighting, comfortable seating and friendly staff made for a great first experience! We weren't entirely sure what to order so we tried a few different items: butter chicken, tandoori chicken and both veg and non-veg  platters. Flavours were great, although we did find everything (aside from the butter chicken) to be even spicier than expected. We'd definitely go back though!"}
{"text":"I love Indian food(and basically any spicy food in general). The interior is very nice(i think this is an important component of any restaurant). I had palak paneer and tandori chicken(which I felt was a little too rich). Please keep in mind, they dont take debit and is a bit noisy at times. All in all, I would say its a nice place just nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"I finally came here during non-buffet hours for dinner. Originally, I've given Little India Restaurant 5 stars, but it lost one star due to my dinner experience here.  Dinner time: The place was clean and the service was great as always. However, I wasn't too impressed with the food, it was okay. I tried the saag chicken (spinach with chicken) with naan bread, mango lassi (mango and yogurt drink) and their rasmalai for dessert (sweet cheese balls in sugary milk). The portions for everything were small, and the price was okay. The spinach in my saag chicken was spiced perfectly and tasted great, but the chicken was a tad bit dry. My mango lassi had too much ice in it. I never had a lassi with ice; it just waters it down and doesn't taste the same. The naan bread could use a little butter, it was a little stiff, but tasted alright. The rasmalai was delicious! The sweet cheese balls were topped off with crushed pistachio and the milk wasn't milky, it was very creamy and perfect.  Also, the lights in the restaurant were too dimmed while it was dark out. Thankfully I had a table by the window, the street lights from outside allowed me to see the food on the table.   The dinner experience wasn't horrible, but I've had better. I think I'll stick to the amazing buffet this restaurant offers earlier in the day."}
{"text":"Long time customer - over 25 years - so it's time to give them the review they deserve. Very friendly and welcoming staff that have been there from the beginning. The butter chicken is the best I've ever had - and I've tried a number since moving out of the city. The basmati is perfectly cooked, palak paneer smooth. Fish curry has lots of spice and they will spice it up even more to the way you like it. The naan is addictive"}
{"text":"there are, i think, THREE Indian buffets on this small block alone, but this is my favourite. they don't have a huge selection, but make my favourite butter chicken in town, best pakoras and fantastic service, polite and friendly. $12 a person for lunch, such a deal!"}
{"text":"Good and near place to try Indian food; however, it small and can't fit a large number of people."}
{"text":"Besides the fact that they placed me at the worst table in the whole restaurant, because I was by myself, the food and the service was actually quiet good. I had a mixed vegetarian platter with all kinds of goodies.  I enjoyed the meal and went across the street to the Rex to see a friends band play afterwards."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in town!OMG,the flavor is actually inside of the food!and great price!"}
{"text":"The food is great - authentic Indian, spicier than we were used to in the UK. The service was good as well, however the restaurant itself desperately needs some renovation. It wasn't the cleanest of places but the food made up for it."}
{"text":"This place is special to me as I ate here the first night I arrived in Toronto on my working holiday visa!  It's not just nostalgia that keeps me coming back here, however. This restaurant serves excellent quality Indian food, at reasonable prices, in an absolutely fantastic location near Queen & University. The portions are extremely generous and the staff friendly and very efficient.  The ambience is inviting and relaxing and there is great variety on the menu, tempting you to try something new each time.  I actually don't think I have been to any other Indians in Toronto - that says it all!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is the busiest out of all the other Indian restaurant in the neighborhood. Reasonable price for an Indian buffet. I love the food, because they're fresh. I've only been here for lunch. Went here at 2 pm on Saturday and there was a lineup (I thought I eat late lunch).  Food tasted really good, except their butter chicken is way too sweet for my liking. I've never tasted butter chicken that sweet before. Everything else is awesome :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in just for a quick snack. Ordered the non-veg mixed platter appetizer which came with Chicken Pakora, Veg Pakora, Veg  Samosa and sheesh kebab. Also ordered  aloo paratha and peas pulao rice. Everything was tasty. Nice portions! Flavors and spice levels were perfect  This snack turned out to be enough for a meal for us both.   They have a beer/wine/cocktail list, not extensive, but you can definitely find something. We opted for the Mango Martinis, which were very tasty and made with fresh mango purée.   The business is family owned and operated, and several of the staff stopped and chatted with us. Very friendly atmosphere.   Will definitely return when we are in the area, and if you are and want some good Indian food, give them a try."}
{"text":"I come here for the lunch buffet whenever I feel like having Indian food. They have a decent selection for the lunch buffet. My favourite are the pakoras and some of the curries. The tandoori chicken is a bit on the dry. The butter chicken is unfortunately the worst that I've had. It is too sweet. The palak paneer (goat cheese with spinach) is alright but the cheese bits were a little rubbery texture-wise.   I do not like Indian sweet desserts but they have a good selection of fruits. They also have ice-cream (mango, choc, vanilla). Service is decent. The single tables are a bit too close to one another for my liking.   Price is reasonable - $12.95++.   Be sure to come earlier. The buffet closes at 3.30pm, which is later than most restaurants. The food was still fresh but when I came once at 3pm, some items were already gone and they didn't refill."}
{"text":"Ordered take-out last night. While it got here SUPER fast the food was mediocre. The butter chicken was so disgustingly sweet, it tasted like they had put a half cup of sugar in it. The palak paneer was good but maybe had 4-5 cubes of paneer in the entire dish! The naan and rice was okay though. Never again!"}
{"text":"Food was quite bland. Chicken madras was like chicken korma. Prawn masala was like chilli prawns totally overwhelmed with green peppers. Wouldn't recommend or go back."}
{"text":"Food- ordered half tandoori chicken (indian version of bbq chicken) and non-vegetarian appetizer platter.  Tandoori chicken- 3/5, good but dry. A bit overpriced of $12 for half chicken with NO sides or naan. Literally just a chicken.  Appetizer platter- 3/5 good for $8. Comes with one tiny shish kabob, a vegetarian samosa (i didn't like this as much due to the fact it's very different from the usual ones i get. Their samosas are loaded with peas and corns and very little potatoes or spices. Also came with two vegetable pakora (again wasn't the greatest), and one chicken pakora (which literally was just chicken in colouring deep fried. Everything was deep-fried so of course it was good but meh. I'll probably skip this stuff and buy it for much cheaper and flavourful at the indian grocer.  Overall it was good but I don't think i'll be coming again for the price and food portions. There are plenty of other food options within minutes."}
{"text":"more like little fn paradise.   this is the only place that I don't mind consistently treats me like shit because there goddamn food is such a treat. the samosas come with a small red dipper that they could tell me is made of their chefs saliva and belly hair and I'd still triple dip cause it tastes so dang lovely. like seriously. what is that wonderful crap?   terrible service at sit down and over priced if u order delivery. but I always go back with a smile... like the beaten husband I am."}
{"text":"This place is located in the busy Queen St W. area. There's another Indian restaurant (that has better reviews than this place) next door, but it was packed and my friend and I needed our Indian food fix asap! So, we decided to just go to Little India. The service is incredibly slow!!! The appetizers (somosas) came out quickly, but we waited over 45 minutes for our meals to arrive!!! The food was decent; nothing to rave about though. The waiters were really attentive and kept refilling our glasses of water as we waited.   Also, they didn't accept debt when I was there! Cash and visa only!"}
{"text":"I am completely baffled as to why this restaurant appears to be crowded all the time. My personal experience would not allow me to recommend this restaurant to others. The lentil soup (Dal) was way too spicy, they brought me rice instead of the Nan that I ordered, and when they finally brought the bread it was so soft, almost mushy, that it wasn't appealing. The Tandoori prawns were super dry and extremely rubbery, and ultimately the Chai masala tea that I ordered never, ever came.  I wanted to believe that they were short-staffed, but the restaurant is small and there were plenty of people running about, so it make me wonder why they can't get it together!"}
{"text":"The best butter chicken I have tasted. Service is efficient and polite. Atmosphere was great. We both had a good time. Now a nice walk otherwise I am going to have food coma."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a treat! We ordered the veggie combo that was a special for Asian Food fest, and absolutely everything was delicious. Service was very attentive. There was a line to get in. We were the third group in line, and it took no more the 15 minutes for us to be seated. With dessert and lassis, the total cost was about CA$50, including tip. We will absolutely go back next time we're in Toronto."}
{"text":"I really loved little India, and I ordered from them quite often. However, the last delivery was a big disappointment. Naan was burnt outside and dough was raw inside. Chicken was barely cooked and my palak paneer tasted burn. Overall, I feel like they started to make everything more spicy but less seasoned.  I don't know if they changed the cook, but the food went downhill. Apparently, they don't have any quality control."}
{"text":"Cuisine très savoureuse et excellent rapport qualité prix. Le menu du jour était vraiment un bon choix."}
{"text":"Absolutely delightful and delicious.  My date and I had the chefs special of the night and at $42.95 for two we ate our fill and there was food leftover.  I eat Indian often and this restaurant stood out enough that I sent my compliments to the chef through our servers. I will be eating here again. It was an excellent dining experience.  Often Indian food is greasy and salty and bitter. This was not the case at Little India. The food was amazing.  All the servers were very polite, sometimes being heavily tattooed I experience bad attitude from servers but not here. There is also a lot of seating and very nice art on the walls."}
{"text":"I will go as far as saying that this is probably the best Indian lunch buffet in Toronto, or at least in the top 3. Everything tastes amazingly fresh and there is a good selection of vegetarian and non vegetarian options. Before I became vegetarian a few years ago, this was my favorite place to go to get butter chicken.  The vegetarian fare is very satisfying as well, and the Naan is always fresh in my experience. If you love Indian food or want to try it for the first time, definitely try the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"This is completely passable Indian.  Not the best but far from the worst I've had in Toronto.  The restaurant had good ambiance with dim lighting, and cozy seating.  We did the vegetarian and non-vegetarian sampler appetizers.  They were virtually identical so if you're open to it, I'd go with the veg option."}
{"text":"So, this is my first ever review. Mostly cause I'm quite lazy about writing food reviews - but today I feel pushed to write a review because my favourite Indian dish (I'm Indian, and this is probably most Indian folks' favourite dish) - Biryani, was thoroughly ruined that I thought I should share the experience with Toronto's general public in order to emphasize that this is not how Biryani is supposed to taste, and most definitely not how it does in India. There are many versions, types, flavours of Biryani depending on which part of the country you're located at, somewhat identified as a classic dish for every special occasion (where meat is permitted). It's a spice flavoured rice, slow cooked with tender meat, could include veggies, herbs and more spices to garnish.. its delicious and spicy. I can go on.. about todays Biryani: The rice was bland, basmati probably mixed with some curry that could've been any curry really, chunks of chicken that just tasted like boiled chicken placed in the biryani as an afterthought.. okay I'll stop here. I paid $13 for this - thats not much, but its just one dish, and if you're an Indian restaurant, you gotta get this one right. Sorry, not going back for this again!"}
{"text":"Good quality and worth the price for a buffet.. hospitality was also good. Loves all items from the starters to desert... everything was good.. authentic indian"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend after hearing really good reviews from D.M about their Butter Chicken, and when it comes to Butter Chicken, I only trust his opinion. Anyway we came in and sat down for their lunch menu at a very reasonable value of $10.95/person. Although the place is a bit of a hole in the wall, boy were we in for a treat! Everything tasted great, and yes so did the Butter Chicken: deliciousness.  I would definitely recommend Little India's Lunch Buffet!"}
{"text":"Is it the best Indian food out there? No. But come with a friend, order the vegetable thali and meat combo for one and share them both for a tasty, varied, inexpensive dinner.  The lunch buffet is an unbeatable value (and a great hangover remedy), but is not always consistent with respect to quality.  The servers are earnest but not perfect.  If I didn't live and work in the area, I don't know if I'd make the trip, but as it stands, it's one of my most reliable spots to meet a friend to catch up."}
{"text":"Loved the saag. Not the best I've ever tried, but very adequate."}
{"text":"Little India rocks. Plain and simple. Have you ever realized you're hungry, hopped on a streetcar heading West down Queen, and decided to just go with the flow and see what you can find? It was an adventure of that sort that brought me to Little India late yesterday afternoon.   Not a huge fan of international cuisine, I would normally skip a restaurant like this in favour of something like The Java House or Shanghai Cowgirl, both nearby.  But I had a craving for butter chicken and naan bread so I \"what-the-hell-why-notted\" and dove in.  The food was delicious. My friend and I ordered the daily special for two and were not disappointed. We got:  -something to snack on while we waited -a delicious appetizer (vegetable pakora) -TWO chicken dishes (one was butter chicken with a sweet kick, yum) -a vegetable dish -a huge plate of rice (well cooked, not sticky or overly starchy) -a substantial basket of naan bread -dessert (maybe the weakest element of the meal, but still tasty) -and coffee or tea!  It came to a grand total of 40 bucks, including tip. For both of us! Wowza!  Our water was constantly replenished (it would have to be, Indian can be spicy for us North American folk) and the food arrived quickly and still sizzling. Great service.   Restaurant itself was simple but warm, inviting and, most importantly, clean and organized. Clean washroom as well. The lower dining room was very full for a Sunday afternoon. Obviously a well loved local gem.   Go. You won't be disappointed, I promise."}
{"text":"Went on dinner time after ferry ride with friends,  this small India restaurant appeared busy but it was just bad organization of the servers. While waiting for a table I observed 1 server refilling the drinks, 2 cleaning the table, anothet 1 bringing out the food, every server was doing their own thing and no one was paying attention to the lady who need assistance,  they all just pretty much ignored her (poor girl).  Luckily the wait wasn't long,  2 tables was cleaned and we got seated after 5min wait.  But after seating,  no menus, no drinks, the servers went on and do their own things again.  About 12 tables with 4 servers,  they shouldn't be running around like flies.  Anyway,  the food was great,  the taste is unique,  I always liked India dishes.  Ordered the soup and the meat combo,  prize for value was good.  Atomposhere was neat.  Overall good experience, 2 stars taken out for sevice"}
{"text":"This place is little and between a row of many Indian Restaurants on Queen St. :)  The buffet can get crowded, tucked in the corner area of the restaurant.   The dishes are all prepared fresh. I especially liked the Chicken Curry, Beef Curry, Chick Pea Curry, Tandoori Chicken, Flat Naan, Rice Pudding, Fruit and Custard, honey desert balls.These were exceptionally good. Only let down was the butter chicken, this was too sweet. Too much Ragu and sugar. Maybe that how people like it but not me.   Service was spot on, fast and friendly. Will go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I have been going here for years...it really is the best Indian buffet for it's price in the area.  The butter chicken is divine, the service is always good.  However, the last time I was here, I noticed something crawling on the floor out of the corner of my eye - it was a dreaded cockroaches.  I quickly signaled the waiter, and he saw it, then hissed and eye signaled to his co-waiter who was right near the bug, just as she was showing in a large group of people.  She continued to talk to her group, but as she was walking she stepped a little wide, squashed it with a very practiced gesture, did a little side step to kick it under a table, all without stopping her explanation about the food in the buffet.  It was all just too pat for me - they have dealt with many a cockroach.  The bill arrived without a word about the cockroach - it was as if it had never happened.  Last. visit. ever."}
{"text":"Great Indian food! I really liked the place and the atmosphere. The prices are very reasonable, especially compared to other restaurants that I've visited in the area."}
{"text":"This is place is awesome! When it comes to Indian food I am very particular because I am of Indian descent. I have tried a number of Indian places in Toronto and have found only two others that I really like. I need the food to be authentic and delicious while having a unique flavour and taste. I was not disappointed at all. The food was so well done and the service was fantastic.  If you go you must try the chicken stuffed naan and shrimp pakoras. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The best indian buffet :) love this place and will definitely recommend to anyone who wants to discover indian taste."}
{"text":"Needed a curry fix whilst in Toronto and was close by this restaurant - so called in for lunch. I was going to order a la carter but the buffet looked so good I opted for this option. Boy was it good, with the star of the meal being the beef curry, really tender beef and delicately spiced. All the other items were good but I still remember the beef."}
{"text":"Came for the lunch buffet with family while visiting Toronto. Large selection of both veg and non veg. Food was fresh and spicy!"}
{"text":"Great place for Indian lunch Buffett. I keep coming back for their chicken pakoras. I tried many Indian buffets but never found another place with better pakoras.   Great friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times after my boyfriend introduced me to this place. I mainly come for their lunch buffet but once in a while I'll get the set dinner.   The buffet is pretty amazing.. Ive never not seen a line up the 10 times or so I've been here. There's about 25 items from appetizers to desserts. My favorites are the butter chicken, spinach with cottage cheese (I always forget the name of this dish), tandoori chicken, naan, and their rice. As mentioned, this place gets really busy but they refill the food quite often so it's always fresh. They also have an upstairs level which they only open if they have too many customers, but I prefer to sit on the main floor.  They offer a dinner special too, but I don't remember the pricing nor the menu offer. My boyfriend and I order to orders, and it's always way too much food for us."}
{"text":"Little India with Big flavors.  There's a line up at weeknights so you know it's gotta be good.  There are a few places we return to regularly.  Little India is one of those places.  The scrumptious and flaky samosas are really good here.  I'm a fan of the chutney that comes with it.  So flavorful.  It has the right balance of sweetness and sourness that I can't get enough of.  Everything I have tried, Tikka Masala, Vindaloo, or Madras, are bursting with the right amount with spices.  One of my favorite dish here is their South Indian specialty - the egg Kothu Roti.  In my opinion, it's a perfect compliment to all spicy curry dishes.  Little India prepares this chopped roti just the way I like it.  Attentive service and delicious food are the reasons I return time and time again."}
{"text":"Food is good but delivery usually takes 2+ hours even on slow nights.  Usually when you get your food, you're so hungry you don't realize there are items missing.  Then wait another 40 min to an hour for them to delivery it, if they deliver it.  This has happened to me so many times and their \"fixes\" or discounts are non-existent because they forget who you are when you order the next time and then argue with you about it.  Love the food but not worth the hassle anymore, I'm done."}
{"text":"For indian food its very bland and definitely the price you pay isnt reflected in the taste of the food."}
{"text":"Food was great. Portions were good, however I felt that I was being ripped off since they combined both lamb and chicken tikka onto one regular sized skillet after waiting 35 to 40 mins. Service was great at first and the waiters were super nice, but they seemed to stop caring after, nor did they bother to check up on us either. But I guess I'd give it a second try, just cause the flavours were good."}
{"text":"Servers were very polite. Nice selection of options however every dish was spicy with the exception of the spinach dish. I do enjoy spicy but when everything tastes spicy it takes away from the quality of the food.  May go back in the future but until then I will keep searching for other Indian buffets to call my favourite."}
{"text":"Restaurant: Little India Restaurant Cuisine: Indian Location: Entertainment District Address: 255 Queen St W Price Range: $10-15  1: Poor 2: OK 3: Good 4: Very Good 5: Excellent  Food: 3 Service: 4 Ambiance: 2 Overall: 3  Extra information:  Specialize in Indian food Daily Lunch Buffet for $11.95 Buffet hour from 11:30am - 3:30pm Open 7 days a week Vegetarian Option Avail Extra seating upstairs Regular menu avail for Dinner   Little India is a well known and often rated/reviewed about Indian Restaurant located in the Entertainment District. They've won many awards and have been featured in various magazine.    They don't really have a waiting area, so unless you are the first 2~3 waiting, you will most likely have to wait outside. I went around 12:30PM and waited for about 10 minute or so. If you are seated, you are ready to go! The buffet table isn't that big but you get so much variety of Indian curry/dishes to choose from.  MAIN DISH starting with rice. There is the regular white rice and the red rice. I liked the pulao rice but to be honest they both tasted to the same to me.   I tried:  Butter Chicken 3/5 This had big chicken pieces in it and it was very creamy, perfect to eat with rice or dip the nann breads in. The curry was a little too sweet for my likings and what I am originally used to, but I guess it's their way of making it more westernized.  Shrimp Curry 3/5 This was also good, it's more of a brownish color and has little shrimps in it (if you can find it). This curry has much more complex flavor compared to the Butter Chicken and it's a much spicier.  Nann Bread 2/5 This was just average, some pieces were too burnt and thin but some pieces were alright. It was overall kind of dry but you can balance it out by dipping it in the curry sauce.  Chicken Pakora 4/5 This was something I tried for the first time and I really enjoyed it. It's basically depp fried chicken with red batter and it reminded me of Korean/Chinese chicken dishes. I think there is seasoning in the batter which made it tasty even without any sauce.  Palak Paneer 3/5 This was a another thing I tried for the first time. It's a dish made with mashed spinach and cottage cheese. It looks like dark green slime and doesn't look very appetizing but it was mild and creamy, almost reminding me of creamy spinach you get at steak places. This was good with rice.  For dessert I tried the rice pudding and the deep-fried dough thing. I completely forgot what it's called but it's round and dunked in this gooey syrup. I first thought they were apples but now that I look at it again, WHY?! HOW?! Anyways, rice pudding was just average and this deep fried dough thing was delish! It does get a little too sweet near the end so keep that in mind. They also have icecream which I did not even go near because I was so full from eating other stuff.  The bill came to $42.49 for 3 people (including 1 pop)  Service was excellent at Little India. I found it a little odd how everyone that was working there are mid-aged Indian men but they were quick to take away our dirty dishes and constantly refilling our water. That's the best service you can get at a Buffet.  Summary: I can't say I know basics of Indian food but for what it's worth, I liked how I could try variety of Indian dishes that I was too afraid to order off of a regular menu. Yes I know it's prob westernized and not 'authentic', but if I am craving butter chicken? I am def going back."}
{"text":"Twenty-two dollars for two people for a lunch buffet? Yes, please.  It's the perfect way to sample a little bit of everything. The butter chicken was delicious and I had to stop myself from shoveling all of it on my plate. They're also good about refilling the food even though we came in a little close to the end of lunch time. I'm still trying to find an Indian restaurant in SF that's comparable to the price and quality of Little India."}
{"text":"My friend brought me here when I had never tried Indian food, and this place definitely made me love Indian food. I have been craving butter chicken every day since! We went for the buffet and it was DELICIOUS, decent variety of food from my limited experience, and I liked pretty much every single thing I tried. I loved the naan, the butter chicken, and the service- I only wish there was a tiny bit more variety in desserts. Will definitely go here again."}
{"text":"Great service. Tasty Indian. We had the vegetable Thalis.  This provided a great variety for 16.95 each. The curries were great. The rice and raita were also flavourful. The restaurant is cozy. They insisted that the two of us sit at a table for four as the spots for couples were near the door (and closer to the cold air). They also do a mean takeout. On a Sunday evening, they had at least 8 delivery people come in to pickup food during our dinner. It was more interesting than distracting. Love it, will go back"}
{"text":"The best Indian food I have ever eaten! The decor was beautiful and the buffet was exquisite!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch buffet with my workplace and the food was pretty good. I absolutely love their naan bread but I wish they would restock their buffet trays more frequently. Sometimes the meat curries only had the curry left and no matter how long you poked into it hoping there was meat, there was none."}
{"text":"The worst indian food experience I have ever had. Ordered takeout through uber eats. I am a HUGE butterchicken fan. This was not butter chicken. Literally think they used tomato paste from a can. Super sweet and just tasted nothing like the butter chicken ive had elsewhere. Also the cheese desert was prepared nothing like ive tasted at all the other fine indian establishments in this city."}
{"text":"I had a huge craving for malai kofta for lunch one day at the office, so some colleagues and I ended up ordering food from this place since they deliver.  The food was good, pretty standard, but definitely not bad. We ordered rotis, but they were a bit thick compared to standard roti chapathi you'd get anywhere else.   In terms of price, it's a bit grossed up compared to other indian restaurants I've been to, but it's probably because of the location. You can get away with anything being \"cultural\" or \"trendy\" on Queen."}
{"text":"Love this place. We came to it while on vacation, I wanted to eat at an Indian restaurant that was not too expensive and came across this with a cousin of mine. No regrets because it was a great looking restaurant and the food was good. There was not much selection at the buffet but the meals that were there tasted great. The service was good. I recommend this location if you are in the downtown Toronto area and you want something good, healthy and cheap for lunch."}
{"text":"I always order Saag Chicken, Lamb Rogan Josh, vegetable Jalfrezi and Zeera rice. You can't go wrong with those imo. As long as you filter out a bit of oil from Rogan Josh, they become pretty healthy I think. Big fan of Indian cuisines that are healthy with little to no cream. No butter chicken etc. Wish the portions are a bit large though because it has drastically decreased over time. Their website delivery system is a bit wonky so I just tend to go for a pickup order (10% discount)."}
{"text":"Hit and miss - the butter chicken sauce was great  but there wasn't any chicken in the vat, so.. huh? Pekoras were good but cold and greasy. Papadams were crispy but nothing special. I liked the lemon rice and the beef dish.   Overall it was pretty cheap for an Indian buffet and I might go again in hopes to have better luck with the butter chicken!"}
{"text":"Tasty, inexpensive indian food on Queen.  Was positively famished so we ordered: chicken korma, lamb tikka, rice, butter naan and kashmiri naan - and a glass of house white to wash it down.  Had a fair amount leftover to take home and dinner was about 40 bucks for the two of us.  The food is well spiced and the sauce on the korma was rich and delicious. The menu seems North Indian but that's just a guess based on the appearance of beef on the menu."}
{"text":"Good food good price not so good service.  There were two of us we ordered Thali it arrived quickly but that was the last we saw of a server.  It appears all servers help each other but they do not communicate to each other.  I had to call a server over to refill our water glasses after ten mins. into our meal.  Then we waited 20 mins. after we were done to have SOME of our dishes removed.  Then another 10 before the rest were cleared.  They almost forgot our dessert which is included in the price.  I have to say they are very friendly as they spent a lot of time talking to their regular guests."}
{"text":"Amazing Indian food with good variety... lunch buffet available... definitely a must go place... recommended"}
{"text":"I recently went to Little India to try their daily lunch buffet.  I had been to the restaurant one other time a few years ago and remember liking it.  Given the low price for an all you can eat lunch buffet, you get your money's worth.    My favorite items in the buffet were the saag paneer, the pakoras and the curry shrimp.  They have a good selection of vegetarian options.   The food alone, it is not spectacular, but in general it is tasty and there is a lot of variety.  The service is also notable which increases the star value.  The multiple waiters that checked up on my friend and I while we were there were friendly and warm.  When my friend accidently left his hat at the place, one of the employees came running out to give it to us, much appreciated : ) ... good, cozy place worth checking out.  price: $12.95 for the lunch buffet"}
{"text":"Best Indian buffet I have ever had. It's got some spice to it and the food is always hot. You can hear the water boiling inside the steam table.  I love their mango salad...slightly underripe mangoes sliced thin and tossed with shredded green leaf lettuce and a light sweet dressing.  Their spinach is incredible...it is cooked until it has totally fallen apart but it still has its color. Their yellow daal reminds me of paripou, the staple curry in Sri Lanka.  There is always fresh fruit, lots of salads, and various flavors of scoop your own ice cream...including mango!  Hubs loved the gulab jamun. They were springy, not mushy.  Great food all around."}
{"text":"Living in downtown Toronto I hate that every time I crave good authentic Indian food I have to go to Mississauga, Brampton or Scarborough. So I was pretty pleased to see so many '+ve' reviews for this place and thought to give it a try.  It was average. Not bad, but average. We tried a mutton dish along with paneer and both were ok. I can see why people would want to come here, its in downtown, it has decent prices and a buffet system for lunch. But if you are trying Indian food for the first time, I suggest going to a better place. If you have tried it before and just want to try it again without spending much, then this will do."}
{"text":"I dined here two times with different crowd of friends. The first time, I had a meal combo with lamb and also a butter chicken meal. The lamb tasted old, dry and hard to bite, I was very disappointed in what i got when i wanted to spend extra $$ on my meal for celebration.  The second time, I was invited by a friend for a surprise. I ordered butter chicken was so so... still...disappointed. We didn't finish every dishes that came to our table. Well, no complains for their food quality and cleanliness of the restaurant. The service was just okay~....."}
{"text":"We ordered food online. It came warm and nice We asked for hot and spice level 7 but it was very sweet Chicken pieces in chicken tikka masala was hard not edible  Samosa ( big and lots of stuffing)was better. Paneer makhni was very sweet. Naan was good"}
{"text":"MY FAVOURITE INDIAN RESTAURANT! Enough said!"}
{"text":"This was one of my most favorite restaurant in Toronto. Since 2000 I was one of their fans . But with last two visits I got so disappointed.   Not because of their service . The taste of India is completely gone and it become nowhere taste . We got zeeree polo with such a disgusting taste .maybe ruined Gee butter or so ... I never go back there and tell my friends not to waste money . This star is only for the waitters ."}
{"text":"Clean, good decor, conveniently located west of Osgoode station.  Good variety of food with chicken, beef as meat dishes.  Good value for a lunch buffet."}
{"text":"We ordered:  Meat platter for two ($40)   Checked in to yelp and also got chicken pakoras! Yay!   Anyway - we got our food and we definitely over ordered - this was enough for 3! We both found the butter chicken sweet. It's not supposed to be super sweet, but it was. The actual tandoor platter was great, lots of of options.   What irked me the most is that they gave us cold naan. I didn't notice this till mid way through the meal because everything else was delicious. It was charred and flaky when it's supposed to be fluffy and soft. I think they gave us leftover naan from lunch because we went for a very early dinner. I'm annoyed. If I noticed at the beginning, I would've told them but it was already halfway though the meal.   I look at some of the other tables around us and theirs wasn't charred at all."}
{"text":"Stopped in here today based purely on smelling indian food about a block south and wondering where it came from - a good sign. Had the lunch buffet. Was hot, fresh, not oily and good quality ingredients. $16.95 for lunch is a slight premium perhaps but can't argue with the portions or quality. With Banjara steadily going downhill the past few years, this buffet was already enough to put L.I. at the top of my indian list for Toronto and I will certainly come back and try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Just tried the buffet and came our pretty satisfied. I'm no expert on Indian cuisine so a buffet style meal is just the perfect choice to be able to sample the different flavours the cuisine has to offer. Especially for someone as clueless as I am.  chicken curry, butter chicken, tandoori chicken, shrimp curry, deep fried breaded fish, salads, dessert, etc. etc.. they have everything covered. While I wasn't particularly amazed at any dish, I wasn't disappointed either. It was a better than expected dining experience for only 11.99.   *service was quite excellent"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch, the food was quite good. Left the restaurant stuffed."}
{"text":"I'm quite fond of what India has to offer on the culinary side. Little India, being around the corner of where I reside, was the first Indian restaurant I gave a chance in Toronto. I have been a frequent visitor since and they haven't disappointed me with their food yet.   The service might be inconsistent and Indian awkwardness is never far away. However, their chicken tikka and madras and vindaloo dishes make up for it. Order a plain paratha on the side and some pakora's and samosa's to get started and you won't be starving that day.   Four stars, because three and a half is not an option and Little India definitely outscores the other places on the Indian strip on Queen West."}
{"text":"Little India was recommended by a local, so we went. On a Friday night. Without a reservation. No problem. We were on the late side of the dinner rush and were seated immediately. The place smells great. We ordered a round of Kingfishers and started the negotiations. After much back and forth we had the onion bhaji to start (angels sang) the the chana masala, vindaloo chicken, a lamb curry of some sort (sorry, I can't remember which one), naan, and rice. And more Kingfishers. The flavours were fantastic. We got everything \"medium\" and it was quite hot enough; our gums and tongues were tingling. A delicious meal; there were no leftovers. The place does steady business in dine-in and takeaway. Washrooms are respectable. Wine list is short, but beer and tea are usually a better choice with food that could be incendiary. We'll go again."}
{"text":"Love this place. I go here for the takeout buffet often. Great portions for the price. I get two meals out of it."}
{"text":"Excellent. Excellent. Excellent.  This place is the house of tremendous taste and flavor, but also raised to god-like awesomeness because it is also the best value for a meal in town. Period.  Period I said! Damn it, stop reading and get your ass to this place already!"}
{"text":"Having gone back recently, the food here doesn't seem quite as impressive as it did before.  We got the bhuna beef again and this time around, it tasted like a can of campbell's chunky soup with some spices added to it.  Pass on this one for me."}
{"text":"Little India is my favourite Indian restaurant in Toronto. Their lunch buffet is THE best Indian lunch buffet I have ever had in my entire life.   For ~$10, you will dine like royalty with their buffet. With tonnes of fresh and pipin' hot items, I guarantee you will need to be rolled out the door.   If you are planning on going over for the lunch buffet, get there early. It's no surprise to see a line up going out the door during peak hours. This place is *that* good.   Also, be sure to try their raita and eggplant bharta. They are my favourite two dishes and I have NEVER had these dishes taste better ANYWHERE else in the world. Good God, I'm drooling.   This family owned and operated business has been serving Torontonians since 1995 and if I have any say in the matter, they will continue to do so until my final days.   I love Little India and you will too. Take your taste buds on a trip to heaven - you can thank me later."}
{"text":"We came here for the AYCE lunch. Nothing extraordinary but decent for AYCE. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Bad service, the worst naan I've ever had (hard, cold, rubbery)...overall unpleasant experience."}
{"text":"Little India on Queen St. West has been a fixture for so long I half expected to find a wiki when googling it. Restaurants that survive for this long have some kind of chemistry right and Little India is no exception. Sure the butter chicken isn't what the hardcore know and love, but this isn't Brampton, and one look outside through a spotless picture window onto Queen St. will remind you where you are. The Rex almost right across the street, and pedestrians hurrying, cars getting the hook from a tow truck, so what can you expect? Consistency is the key to long term happiness, and one such institution is the lunch buffet with fluffy naan and sweet desserts to compliment the crispy on the outside, yet moist on the inside tandoori chicken. But evenings are different here, mainly because of the crush of customers darkening the doorway extending the dark and moody colours onto the sidewalk. There is no room for the buffet with their galley style layout. In the past there were two Indian restaurants side-by-side but it appears Little India bought out the neighbours so the restaurant is divided by a long wall with two dining rooms and one usable entrance. When it's freezing cold out and you need some spice to warm you up, this is the ideal layout in To. We ordered the meat combo for two, and the veg combo along with come chicken pakora for the free app using the Yelp check-in offer. (The offer had expired last year but they still honoured it). Everything was delicious with one of my fav's being the prawns. How do they get the sauce to permeate the meat like that, yet not have it turn into a rubber ball? Just fantastic! What a nice combo meat array served on a sizzling hot cast iron platter. Like other fixtures downtown, Little India delivers."}
{"text":"Two words: butter. chicken."}
{"text":"Little India. Big on flavors!  When i say \"Big on flavors\" I really mean it.  Their food is always hot & fresh. The Butter Chicken is amazing, the best I've had in a while! Their Buffet Price is average and worth every penny! Everything in their buffet tasted very good! The service is good as usual!   The Decoy is very modern & classy. This is one of the biggest Indian Restaurant on Queen Street! Give this restaurant a try when your around the area!"}
{"text":"I've been eating at this restaurant for about as long as I've lived in Toronto, maybe 15 years, and it's pretty much always been good. The people who work there are really nice, the last time we went there they gave us desert free, without us ordering it. One time someone we were with insisted Babur's next door was better so we ate there and  I promptly got some form of food poisoning. It may look nicer inside than Little India, but Little India has proven itself over the long haul. The buffet is a great deal. Some of the curry veg has been based on frozen mixes, so they are perhaps best avoided. Some days I've gone and the food is so spicy you gasp as you fork the food into your mouth, other times it is much milder."}
{"text":"Buffet isn't the way to go here. Ordering off of the menu is much better. The samosa's are huge and delicious. Really enjoyed a few of the chicken dishes, but again avoid the buffet."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal. 5 stars for food, service, and prices. Best Indian I've tried in the city."}
{"text":"Pretty disappointing.  My butter chicken was way too sweet and tomato-y.  It tasted like chicken and rice swimming in ketchup."}
{"text":"My favourite Indian downtown, hands down. The mutter paneer is spiced well, but not too spicy. Naan is soft and delicious!  Quick for takeout too, as long as you order over the phone"}
{"text":"I tried Little India a few days after Trimurti, I like both but i think that Little India just shades Trimurti in overall choice and ambience.   It took a little longer than I would like to get our order taken , but once that happened the food , a hell of a lot of it in big portions came fast and furious."}
{"text":"I liked this place a lot. It was busy and we went on a Wednesday night around 830, which was a good sign. The service was great, and the food came really quickly. I've tried a lot of Indian in Toronto and I'm comparison the food was ready faster the most Indian places. We ordered butter chicken, chicken tiki masala, mater paneer, lamb vindaloo, eggplant Bharta, naan and rice. The naan was really nice, chewy and crispy and fresh. The standout was the eggplant, best I've had in Toronto. The butter chicken was a bit too sweet and reminded me of canned tomato soup so it wasn't the best, the tikka masala was nice but the mater paneer was really good. The vindaloo had a good kick. Overall I enjoyed it and would return, it definitely satisfied our Indian food craving very nicely!!"}
{"text":"Very good Indian place on Queen West. Came here two weeks ago for delicious dinner. We had the share platter for two which included popadums, curries carrots, pakoras, butter chicken and tandoori chicken and naan. What a feast! I'm getting hugry again just describing what I ate. I think it is $45 for this meal. Compared to what other yelper are describing as the regular prices, this deal really seems like the way to go."}
{"text":"The best Indian cuisine I have had so far. If you like Indian food, you must try it. Generous portions! Took the rest to go for lunch today. Fast friendly service. Would definitely eat there again and again."}
{"text":"Butter chicken tasted sweet as if it's filled with sugar and the chicken tasted old as if it's cooked yesterday. Non vegans mix platter was tasteless. Ppl run away not worth the money."}
{"text":"Don't tell my Indian grandmother this, but it was the best Indian food I've ever had.  My boyfriend and I arrived just before they opened for lunch, but they let us in early and grab food as it came out for the buffet.  They had the biggest variety of any Indian buffet I've been to - somewhere around a dozen meat dishes, plenty of vegetarian items, the first palak paneer I actually liked (loved, in fact - I went back for fourths).  Plus a salad bar, tons of desserts and ice cream.  It was a little pricey at, if I recall correctly, $13.95, but well worth it for the variety and excellent service.  Thank goodness I don't live in Toronto, because I'd be there on a daily basis."}
{"text":"Little India is one heck of a great restaurant.  Firstly, their decor is beautiful. They have a number of exquisite Indian paintings on the walls, and some other Indian pieces of art spread around the restaurant. I really love how this place has a classy Indian feel to it.  The servers at Little India are some of the best I've seen anywhere. They are both extremely friendly and efficient.  They also tend to have a high level of cleanliness here as well. They are always checking the buffet to make sure that all is well. Moreover, they continually clean the handles of the tongs. My only complaint is that sometimes you will get a fork or a spoon that isn't as clean as it could be. But overall, this place is exceptionally clean.  The food here is also great. Their buffet consists of a number of dishes (both meat and veggie) to choose from. Also, you will never see a dish run out that won't be refilled almost instantly. Furthermore, even though it's a buffet, their food tends to be fresh and of a high quality. The only difficult part is having enough room in your stomach to try everything.  To sum it up, this place is pretty good!"}
{"text":"I ordered Uber eats delivery from Mother India tonight. Although the quality of the food was good, the butter chicken dish ($17) had 4 SMALL pieces of chicken in it. Paying $17 for cream and spices is extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"Excellent service Ex! Cel! Lent! food. As we were out of towners, this place came as a recommendation from a random local. It was VERY crowded upon our arrival on a weekend evening, but that having been said, the wait was not long. When a party of 6 showed up after us and tried to squeak past claiming to have a reservation they didn't make, the wait staff promptly sent them to the back of the line. My boyfriend and I each ordered dishes off of their vegetarian menu including Samosas and Papadam as appetizers.  Everything was De! Lish! Ous! From the starter salad to the Kheer, the servers were prompt, very pleasant and very accommodating in a wonderfully relaxing atmosphere. Make Little India Restaurant in Toronto a stop you make when you're in the area and you're in for a scrumptious treat!"}
{"text":"Staple in my life. Dinner is 5 stars all the way. They always have chef selections and tasting menu for $55 the pair. Cozy, sweet place."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service, we had a great evening and we will definitely come again soon!"}
{"text":"Not a place to go if you want to try real Indian food. Butter chicken turns out to be a dessert. It's not supposed to be sweet. The okra was undercooked. The naan was cold(and I ordered from the a large cart menu!) And the portions are really small compared to other Indian places. I wouldn't recommend this place to any Indian missing some good Indian food."}
{"text":"Simply put, this place is amazing! I've been here a number of times trying different dishes and was always impressed! Their lamb and beef biryani dishes are a delight! Service has always been friendly too! Watch out though, this place is always packed!"}
{"text":"Made the long trek by foot to get there and it was Well worth it. Although the place was packed it was worth the small wait. The staff was courteous and we were never low on water in our glasses. The chicken tikka masala was delicious as is the naan. We ordered another chicken dish but the name is escaping me at the moment. Nonetheless, it also was delicious. Took a but to get our bill but we were in no hurry. Other entrees going out to other patrons looked incredible. So glad we dined there."}
{"text":"I would rate this place a 3.5 but the service was really good and the food was very tasty, so 4 it is! The place was very dim, chairs were kind of dirty and the place is cluttered. But, the portions are big and flavours were really nice. I will definitely return as I'll crave the app platter and the lamb vindaloo."}
{"text":"One of the last standing Indian restaurants standing in the area. Was amazing when I was here a few years ago but seems things are going down hill from there.  The restaurant is beautiful and classy, service is pleasant.   We order the Meat Combo for one to share, also checked in to get a free appetizer.   The Tandoori chicken was extremely dry, the lamb was very tough, the butter chicken was on the sweet side - looking at other reviews saying the same too. Tasted like curry creamy ketchup. When I asked about it, the server said that's how the people around here like it.  *shrug  The appetizer was okay - Cocktail Sheekh Kebab. It was the same meat they used to put on the Meat Combo. So I wouldn't order it again.  We sat front table by the door and under the AC so our food got cold real quick. The naan bread got hard fast and not that appetizing - well when dipped into super sweet butter chicken that is..  We also tried to order a lamb curry, but the server forgot to put the order in. We ended up cancelling it and left. Unsatisfied.  The search for good Indian food continues.  3/5 Food 4/5 Service 4.5/5 Ambience 5/5 Location"}
{"text":"Second night in Toronto, we popped in for some Indian, as I was craving samosas and saag.   The samosas definitely didn't disappoint. I might even go so far as to say that I think they were the best I've had in years! My saag, however was a little on the bland side. The naan was hot and fresh and our service was good, despite the restaurant being very busy.   If I lived a few hundred miles closer, I'd definitely be back to stock up on more samosas and check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Expensive for portion.   Ordered the Palak Paneer, which is spinach and cheese cubes. It tasted like every other version of it I've ever had, but was a little denser and more viscous.   For $14, all you get is a small, shallow dish of the paneer, which means you have to order rice or naan too. Even for downtown, it's two or three times too expensive. My neighbours' butter chicken portions were similarly sized.   In terms of fullness, it's enough because it's heavy food. But it's far overpriced."}
{"text":"We found what we think is an elastic in our chicken madras, along with numerous hairs in the briyani. It wasn't the first time we ordered, and previous times it was fine. But we can't really get past this one."}
{"text":"I always order the same dish at Indian restaurants - shahi paneer !  It's usually very flavourless and full of Indian spices. I also order garlic naan and rice on the side.   This was my first time trying Little India downtown. I ordered for take out, and was told it would take 20 minutes. 25-30 minutes later, my food is finally ready and I head home.   To say the least, the food was disappointing. I was expecting lots of flavour, but the small portion of shahi paneer was quite bland and boring.   I've ordered this dish at multiple other Indian restaurants, for half the price and double the portions. Nothing makes me want to try any other dishes, so I'll never be back."}
{"text":"This is a yummy as it gets for Indian lunch buffet!  We've been coming here for many years since they opened and haven't been disappointed EVER!  Granted we only come here for lunch buffet it just can't be beat for $10.  It's a small restaurant on the main floor and the buffet table isn't huge but what it has to offer is quality!   There are appetizers with chutneys and other delectables, salads, fruit, a soup, dessert and of course, main fares.  Butter chicken, curry chicken, curry potato, mattar paneer and the fresh naan get my thumbs up!  Even our baby (16 months old) loves their food.  Speaking of which, if you're visiting with a stroller, room is very limited so keep that in mind because it is very cramped in there.  They do have a high chair so that's convenient.  Service is just lovely and the wait staff are so attentive.  We'll be back again (as usual)!"}
{"text":"Aside from the fact that they apparently don't answer their phone, this place is pretty good! I wanted to order take out but since no one picked up (after trying four times) I just went in and placed my order. I got an order of mulligatawny soup, naan bread and beef vindaloo and requested it be made extra spicy.  The soup was thicker than I had anticipated, but still quite tasty with generous amounts of chicken and cilantro included. The naan was fresh and the vindaloo was a really good consistency and they actually honoured my request to make it extra spicy. I was sweating! Again, a generous amount of meat was included in the vindaloo and they also give me some pickled carrots on the side. Not sure if they do that for all take out orders, but I wasn't charged for it.  The only thing is that they forgot to include utensils. I had to get the hotel I was staying in  to bring some to my room.   Dining in would have been interesting as the layout of the restaurant isn't really conducive for eat-in diners. People picking up take out have to walk to the back of the restaurant, past all the customers and I could say that getting annoying really quickly if I was eating in. Also it's quite dark inside.  But the food is great and I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I'm out of town and my friend who is from Toronto brought me here. It is small so some of the tables you do sit close to the next people. It got full quick so you should go just before the supper rush or make a reservation.  Everything I had was delicious! If you like to try new things, check this place out!"}
{"text":"Bring a sleeping bag with you if you're heading back to work after eating here 'cause you're going to AYCE yourself into a coma.  Things I like about Little India: - $10.95 buffet - Three floors of food troughs - Food is always hot - People don't stare while I shovel food into my face - They let me come back even though I'm their loss leader.  Solid south Asian eats in the core for peanuts. Because of it's so popular, the chafing dishes are always being replenished, so the food is always hot and, as far as my brain tells me, the food is good.  It's by no means the best you're ever going to have, but if you have a hankering and you're in the core, do it, but find yourself a nice nook quickly, because you're no match for the carb doom chasing you down."}
{"text":"This seems to be a South Indian restaurant that offers a lot of Northern Indian cuisine, probably because the general population know and like it more. The problem I find with these type of joints is that if you eat a lot of Indian food, you can tell the difference.  I order Benghan Bharta almost anytime I eat Indian food. Mostly because I love the dish, but also it helps me gauge the quality and taste of the food. So, I order my favorite dish and it's really bitter and too dark, which I think contributes to the bitterness. The naan was dry and flavorless.  This was my first trip to Toronto and I enjoyed it so much, but I will not be back to this spot."}
{"text":"You cannot go wrong with this place! I've been here many times and tried out a lot of different dishes -  have never been disappointed.   This is not a grand restaurant but perfect for a night of delicious comfort Indian food for affordable prices. Some of my favourite dishes are the mutton roll, veg spring roll, chicken korma (it's so creamy and had a mild sweet taste), malai kofta, beef bhuna, beef vindaloo, the okra dish, garlic naan.   This is a must try for anyone who wants \"good\" Indian food."}
{"text":"After trying 3 Indian lunch AYCE buffets in one week I givet his one runner-up to only Trimurtri.  I know people like this place the best on Indian-buffet row- but really, it doesn't compare- I won't go into it too much but you can read my review of the gold medal winner here: http://www.yelp.ca/biz/trimurti-indian-cuisine-toronto#hrid:tcuV_zkmDVb5lpdU8x-0Ew  So the good things about this place?  -the naan is fresh and tasty -the fruit bar is massive.  and delicious.  and the salad bar is big. and delicious. -the options are amazing.  so if you are new to indian food its cool to try a little bit of everything. -the rice options are nicer than the other places on teh strip. - service is obviously excellent  cons:  -the chicken @ the buffet is dry and uneventful -the dishes are boviously fromt he night before- they taste a bit like the night before.   -the crispy tortilla things are a bit spongey and less than tasty  *NOTE that if you go for dinner NONE of the cons are true because everything is fresh and so so delicious  Other than that, i'm a fan, but if I go for all-you-can-eat lunch, for the crazy cheap deal- I'll choose Trimirti"}
{"text":"It was just ok. I came with a friend for the lunch buffet. The smell of incense was very strong and there wasn't that much variety with the buffet. I thought the curries were a bit bland and the butter chicken was really sweet. I liked the naan and chicken pakoras though. The servers  were very nice and the place was busy with the lunch time rush but the turn over was quick since people just came, ate and left."}
{"text":"We went there once and never again. I have tried good Indian food before and their dishes did not convince me. The pakora was ok but I tried their palak paneer and it was tasteless. No flavour, no nothing. The butter chicken was ok but not the best either.  Their dishes seem to be a VERY light version of real Indian food (most likely intentionally) and I dare to say that it may be a tourist trap and yet they always seem to be busy.   I guess some people like it and some don't.  Still, I recommend to try other Indian places.  Note: I have never been to India."}
{"text":"I have tried every Indian restaurant in Toronto that everyone says is good and this is truly the best one.  For those of us who like sweet butter chicken, this one is unbelievable.  Anyone who complains about the wait time is probably getting there right at 12pm or 7pm.  It's not a huge place, and it gets busy.  I don't understand why people complain about busy restaurants.  Here's a clue for you:  If it's a meal time, there's no one eating there, and no line, it probably isn't a very good restaurant!  Food: 5/5  Delicious Pakoras and other apps. Amazing butter chicken, veggie/vegan curries, beef and lamb curries, etc.  Incredible dinner for 2 options.  Fantastic lunch buffet, especially if you get there when everything is coming out (around 11ish).  Highly recommend.  Very affordable, too.  Best value for your money of any restaurant I've tried.    Service: 3/5  Very friendly servers.  There aren't always enough, but I've never been upset.  Your water glass is always full.  Ambience: 4/5  Can be tight space-wise, but very nice.  I love the smells, music, and decor."}
{"text":"One of the better Indian places I've had in the downtown core. Once you enter the restaurant, you can smell and see the authenticity. I'm not one to judge its authenticity, but all I'm saying is, it felt nice and quaint, without being tacky. We got a bunch of dishes to share and even my Indian friend approved of the taste, so that's something! My favourite was still the vindaloo dishes, but that's because sometimes I torture myself with spice. The mango lassi is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Worst meal ever!  Although, the portion size is quite commendable hence why I rated it with two stars.  However, the food itself was horrible. I ordered for a very spicy lamb vindaloo, rice and naan. The lamb wasn't spicy at all and very tasteless, I had to add salt, rice was extremely sticky but the naan was perfect.   My delivery came in two hours and a few minutes after I ordered it and it was unnecessarily expensive. And even though I was paying in cash, the delivery man supposedly didn't have my $20 change for me for a meal of $30. I ended up paying $50 for something I didn't even enjoy. Even though when I called I told them I was paying $50 in cash and I'd need a $20 change.   If not because I was really hungry, I wouldn't have accepted that meal or even paid.   My whole experience has been horrible, nothing else can go below this, I don't think. Never recommending this place to anyone   P.S I'm a lover of south Asian cuisine, and I've tried all sorts if not every. But this place, NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"I only had this for delivery one time, but I really felt this was just fantastic Indian food, some of the best in Toronto. I loved their naan, chicken masala, pakoras, veg korma. It is pricey, but I felt satisfied that the quality justified the prices."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere of this place! A great place for dates with the dim lighting and red decor. The restaurant has that formal dining room look bit for a great price. And the food tastes great! It's not oily like many other Indian restaurants. The staff is friendly and welcoming. I had samosas, and the aloo gobi."}
{"text":"On the advice of all you yelpers I visited Little India for the lunch buffet a few weeks ago.  Do not fear if the ground floor is packed - there's a calmer floor upstairs, and I think there might be a third stacked up there.    Service is attentive, which I love.  I think restaurants with spicy food get used to refilling water glasses every thirty seconds.  I could get used to this; I hate having to spend ten minutes trying to catch a waiter's eye when I want dessert or another beer.  As so many other reviewers have said, the food is excellent, with lots of fresh buffet options.  I got  in over my head on the first plate, so never got to try the desserts, but I'll be back some day.    One small cloud: why is the butter chicken sweet?  It isn't as sweet as the same dish at Savera, but it's still weirdly sugary."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for the lunch buffet ($12.99 + tax) and once for dinner. Buffet items are hit and miss, but our dinner set meal was made fresh and really good.  Here's my review of the lunch buffet items:  Likes: Vegetable pakora Curry chicken Cauliflower appetizer in the orange sauce Tandoori chicken Saag (spinach)  Dislikes: Naan - too bready Butter chicken - way too sweet Mango ice cream - didn't taste like mango"}
{"text":"This place is lovely. You can certainly find cheaper Indian food of the same quality elsewhere. But part of the Indian cuisine's charm is in the atmosphere. This place delivers.   A meat feast for 2 will set you back about $40 + tip, which is fairly reasonable considering what you get. We got a basket of naan bread, a sizzling plate of bbq food, butter chicken, and a veggie curry. We barely finished.   Taste wise, it's not that much different from your standard Indian place. On the BBQ I thought some of the meat was a bit rough, but I like the smokiness level. Service is professional."}
{"text":"I skipped lunch today, and then played Badminton for two hours, so I was pretty darn hungry by the time we finally made it to the Little India Restaurant.  This was one of the very few times that Yelp has failed me.  Four stars with 51 reviews. In general, this is going to mean we're in for a good meal. Thanks to Yelp, I typically only eat at 4+ star restaurants, but will occasionally frequent a 3.5 star.  I had a half order of Tandoori Chicken, all white meat, along with a garden salad.  My friends ordered the meat thali. This included butter chicken, tandoori chicken, lamb/mystery meat kabob, goat (not 100%) and a vegetable curry.  To my disbelief, the only thing really edible on the table was my garden salad!   The Tandoori chicken was perhaps the most flavourless, dry and mealy that I've ever had. Ravenously hungry, I made a valiant attempt to eat it, finishing just slightly less than half a breast.  The rest of the meat described above were all dry as well.    The butter chicken was way too sweet and tasted like tomato sauce.  It looked like it too - very red in colour.  The vegetable curry was disgusting as well.  It's very rare that I will actually say anything in the restaurant, but this was a travesty. I sent my food back, which is something I've done less than five times in my life.    This would be a one-star review, however the restaurant basically comped my  meal and discounted the meals for my friends.   This is some of the worst Indian food I've ever experienced."}
{"text":"Visited on a Friday night, party of 2. We only ordered 3 items and it was more than enough food. We had the vegetable pakoras, daal soup, and the meat combo. I'm not sure exactly what's in these dishes, but they all tasted good. The only thing I didn't like was that the meat combo come on several plates, and it took up the entire table. Luckily we had a table for 4 and we had the space to lay everything out. I typically don't like spicy food, but indian is one of the exceptions. It wasn't too busy on a Fri night, I would definitely come back again. Since there are other indian restaurants in the area, our friends recommended this one because he remembered the elephant on the sign. Service was really fast!"}
{"text":"Not bad, great service, the food absolutely great. And I ate like there was no tomorrow. Yum"}
{"text":"Food here is great, but felt that the waiters and waitresses were super pushy to get the orders down quickly. But this also meant our food came out quickly, and waters refilled promptly.  I had the lamb kothu roti and enjoyed it. Be ware- the portion sizes are massive, and probably meant for sharing. I would recommend a group or even two people sharing a bunch of items off the menu."}
{"text":"Little India is always full of people, and always quick to serve.  Great place to split a couple dishes. Had the butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, pilao and naan. Our waiter was extremely friendly and was quick to let us up the spice on their typical butter chicken dish. (Although my boyfriend couldn't handle the spice upgrade) they were extremely accomodating and helped laughed off his eighth glass of chugged water."}
{"text":"Best Indian buffet in Toronto. Best variety, taste and price.   Service hospitality is satisfactory. They only have buffet at lunch time, and menu order at dinner. Order menu is still fantastic!  Their naan service at table is very nice. Butter chicken, beef curry and the chilli paste are my fav. And among the veggie dishesh, i love the chana masala.  Every single friend i took there, they ended up taking their family there after.  A very good authentic indian restaurant. Must try!"}
{"text":"I hate buffets and I hate feeling pressured to eat the buffet. But I ate the buffet, and much of it was good. Palak paneer (spinach and cheese) was surprisingly not one of the offerings that was good. Rather, it was pretty mediocre. This saddened me, so I felt the need to drown my sorrows in chutneys, which were much better. Now my sorrows are sufficiently spicy."}
{"text":"Good tasty Indian food near Nathan Philips square in Toronto. We had gone there on Sunday, the 12th June 2016 with 6 couples who had come from India, lead by Ajit Mota of Mota chips"}
{"text":"Okay the food is very good, and the servers are polite, but the service as far as time management is terrible. We had to wave the waitress or waiter down every time we needed something because they just wouldn't come by the table. When we finally got to ask them for something, it would take them a while to get back to us. Only come here if you have a lot of time."}
{"text":"The food and service were good, but a little bit overpriced for curry."}
{"text":"Unreal Indian food. Came here with a friend and we were both blown away. Great service. Authentic decor with interesting art (we sat next to a picture of a woman with a mustash).  I got the chicken Masala and my friend get the tandoori chicken. Got regular Naan and rice to go with our dishes.  Just wikkid food. A bit pricey but it is in the middle of Toronto. Perfect amount of spice. Can't wait to bring my boyfriend here.  Definitely the best Indian I've had in toronto and I've eaten quite a bit of Indian."}
{"text":"I had the most awkward experience here with one of the waitstaff - appeared to be the head waitstaff of the evening. Let me preface my review by saying that I've been going to this restaurant for several years - and in the last year, the quality seems to be going downhill.  I was particularly embarrassed tonight because I had brought a friend along to the restaurant - hoping to introduce her to some decent Indian food. I ordered the Paneer Tikka Masala (cottage cheese curry dish). When the dish came, I dived in and noticed immediately that there were some dark pieces in the curry- as the lighting is dim - I assumed maybe they included eggplant in the curry. However, upon closer inspection, I realized that several pieces of the paneer were badly BURNT! I attempted to break the piece - paneer normally has a really nice semi-firm but smooth and creamy taste to it. These were tough and chewy! When I called over the waiter - I explained to him that it appeared that several pieces of the paneer was burnt. At this point - I was still \"okay.\" However, the response from the waiter completely threw me off and turned it into a very awkward situation!   First, he stared blankly at me and said: \"ok....so...do you want me to bring you another piece?\"   me: \"uh well...no not really...its not like i need another piece, but i just wanted to let you know that it's burnt\"   and then he attempted to justify it: \"well...you know they have to grill the paneer first so.....\"   the trailing off of his sentences, blank stares, and justifications completely threw me off. He then said to me \"okay...give me the piece...i can see what i can do. its okay\"   his tone made me feel like - it was somehow MY FAULT - as if I was trying to \"get something\" out of the burnt dish. I immediately told him \" i dont need another piece...and just so you know it's not 'okay'...and you should probably apologize for the state of this dish\"   They ultimately offered me 25% off - but honestly, all i wanted was an apology and an acknowledgement that the dish was completely unacceptable. I am someone who has worked several years in customer service - I was being incredibly reasonable and humble - and frankly, I am shocked as to the response that i received. I will not be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends and had some dishes to share. The staff was friendly, the food was great and the overall experience was very nice. I would definitely come here again  What we shared: 1. Rogan Josh lamb dish: 9/10. We really enjoyed this dish, it was so flavorful. 2. Butter chicken: 7.5/10. I thought this was good but not great. The first was definitely much better. 3. Vegetable korma: 7/10. I found this good too.   I'm hoping to visit again to try some of the other dishes which I'm sure will be amazing."}
{"text":"We spent approximately 15 minutes in a chilly stairwell waiting to be seated at the eminently popular Little India Restaurant (LIR) in bustling downtown Toronto.  And it was during those precious few moments of pause--so rare in our busy lives--when the lovely Canadian locals shined, the staff apologizing repeatedly for the wait (\"sorry!\") and the patrons stopping to smile and chat in the brisk air before heading inside.   It wasn't long before we, too, found ourselves inside, basking in the warmth and gazing upon several mysterious adornments including a heavily clothed Ganesh in a deeply recessed niche, a 3D horse & carriage scene, and even a sequined picture (?).  There wasn't much time for examination, however, as our dinner was efficient--not only temporally, but also spatially: the naans and rices were combined to save table real estate!  Clearly reasonable, considering the high density urban environs.   The meal began, as many do, with (free) crispy, well salted papad, followed quickly by decently crunchy veggie pakora ($4) that was nicely spiked with cumin, and both mango and rose lassis (each $3.5); the viscosity and flavor of the mango was acceptable, but the rose was quite impressive, and intensely rosy.  The various naans were a bit doughy, and the Kashmiri naan may have had traces of pie filling; however, the garlic naan was exceptionally tasty.   The meaty mains were fine: beginning with the lamb vindaloo ($12) and the goan fish curry ($13), the latter of which was impressively spicy!  But didn't have all that much taste...  Things improved slightly with the aloo gobhi ($8.5), which had excellent cookitude, even considering the large pieces of aloo and gobhi.  Unfortunately, as seem to be all too common with the eigendish, taste was still lacking.  However, the other veggie entrées were both reasonably priced and outstanding: the mattar paneer ($8.5) had a fantastic sauce, and the eggplant bharta ($8.5) was beautifully creamy and almost sweet.   Overall, the combination of pleasant, positive ambiance and tasty fare warrant a four-samosa rating, at two-rupee rates that were surprisingly reasonable for Canada's most populous city.  Next time you're north of the border, give LIR a try: you most certainly won't be \"sorry\"!"}
{"text":"I felt like Indian buffet and found this place listed as #1 on blogto and scored high ratings here so I went in for lunch today.  I've been to the other Indian buffet on Queen before, e.g. Trimurti and India Palace, but I don't know why for I never came into this one until today.  Based on today's lunch, I agree why it earned the top score for it's category (maybe there are other great places outside of the downtown core, but for this area, this is pretty good).  All the food were super delicious and tasty. Trays are constantly replenished with hot, freshly cooked items. I think the items next door were a bit bland and items such as tandoori chicken could be dry. At Little India here, no meats were dry. The flavours for all are just right. Some items are a bit spicy, but it's not killer spicy, just tasty spicy, with a kick and as long as your tongue can take it, you will be fine. I think the spice level was out of my expectation at first because I had the more bland versions at Trimurti and India Palace. I loved mostly everything: curry beef, curry chicken, curry shrimp, fried fish, and butter chicken. I think different places have their own recipe for butter chicken and I like how they cooked theirs here. I don't know how to describe the difference but it's good. I think anything that fried was done well, e.g. fish and this other veggie item, moist inside, not over-fried and tough like some other places. I also liked their eggplant and spinach paneer, which were great with their fresh batches of naan and rice (forgot the names, but I find the yellow rice much tastier than the white rice).  Ambiance, the place is clean and cozy. Walk space is a bit tight between tables and I sometime worry about accidentally tripping over someone's table and dropping my plate of food :) But you do get your space and the place fills up very quickly for lunch.  Service wise, A+ like most reviewers here claimed. Very friendly and attentive. Not only does good food matter but service is big for me too. I really like to feel appreciated as a customer when I choose one establishment over another and I felt sincere appreciation here today. Nothing over the top that gets annoying like abruptly cutting your conversation constantly to ask how's everything. It was all in the gentle tone and mannerism.  I think Little India will be my regular choice for Indian buffet on Queen Street West."}
{"text":"Seeing all those Toronto awards hanging in their window could only mean that the kitchen is clean and Torontonians share the same love for Little India.  I admit, its a good place for Indian fare. I had the meat combo for two which consisted of many of their meat menu items plus one vegetarian dish. Rice and naan are included.  The food was good, with lots of flavour and great aroma. For the price, you get a lot. A doggy bag may be necessary unless both you and guest are starving.   The buffet is good too. Probably one of the best I've had in Toronto, but I haven't been to too many Indian buffets. The assortment is enough and the price is very reasonable. All I really need are naan, butter chicken, pakoras, maybe samosas and some creamed spinach.   The service is friendly but the seating is a little cramped to my liking.  Overall, with the waft of fragrant aromas, assortment of dishes and the staples done right, Little India deserves it's awards. The price certainly justifies its quality and portions."}
{"text":"Delivery time was a touch long. 1 hr and 10 mins, even tho they said 45. Seems to be the standard operating policy set by the Indian food guild of metropolitan centers worldwide. The meat combo for two is $60 with tips, delivery, hst. Not the bestest deal. Naan is phenomenal and massive. Like a blankie. You could make a fort! That you can eat. The vegetable curry was out of this world. The butter chicken was mislabeled- it should be aylmer brand ketchup nicely emulsified on over cooked white chicken. It was absolutely not butter chicken, it was tomatoes and vinegar and just why bother?!?!?! Horrible. The mixed prawns,  lamb and chicken Tandoori was fine. Peas paloa  (sping?) Was fine. Overall the place was fine. Fine. K. It's fine."}
{"text":"Ordered this off uber eats and it was the WORST Indian I've had In Toronto ... sorry to say but the butter chicken was really bad and the portions are very small for the price"}
{"text":"Not only was today my first taste of Little India Buffet Restaurant, but also of Indian food altogether. I would be lying if I said I was not having my doubts and felt out of my element just thinking about the fact I would venture into new food territory, but my good friend nudged me towards the \"oh-so famous\" butter chicken and I thought to myself, \"why not try new things?!\"  Thank goodness I did, this place was amazing!  Such a cute little place in amidst the chaos of Toronto's core, well decorated and scented with incense from far away land...it was like an overload of taste and smell I had never experienced in my life. I imagined myself in India....And then the plate was empty and I got up for some more...  The bottom line- this place is great even for begginers like me (they label everything) and why not try something new? Lunch was only $11.99! I must also add- the service was impeccable! I don't remember the last time a waiter treated every customer with kindness and courtesy. It was like they LIKED their job....I must really mention this : the service was EXCEPTIONAL!  If you are already an indian food fan...head over to this place, there's a reason why they get the BEST reviews! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Affordable buffet with a surprising amount of options for how small the buffet line was! While the restaurant was filled up and a comfortable environment to enjoy lunch, it was kind of hard to get around the cramped space and made for enjoying the whole meal a bit hard!  The owners of the establishment positions the buffet where it's sort of a pain to get your meal.  Needless to say, the meal was well worth the wait.  Despite going during hte last hour, the food was pleasantly fresh (including all the veggies) and it had a respectable kick to it without being too spicy!  I would definitely make my way over to there sometime soon if I have a craving"}
{"text":"We came here for the menu but ended up getting the buffet. It was O.K, the butter chicken was way too sweet! That was different for me. The naan was not as soft as I had expected it to be but it was alright. I would go here again but maybe without doing the buffet. Also they don't accept debit, I found that weird!"}
{"text":"Worst Indian restaurant I have been in outside India. Food was sweet!! I mean I can understand that normal spice level is low in America but it cannot be just sweet. The food had no finesse and taste. Service was pathetic it was like a tea and samosa roadside shop!! Tables are too close so Everytime u eat a bite u feel your neighbor is looking into your plate. This place is always packed though so it might give you an impression that it is really good but imo it is doing business because there are very few Indian restaurants in Toronto downtown. I would not recommend you to go here and water your money!"}
{"text":"Little India is pricier than AYCE indian buffets but is definitely a big notch higher in quality. I asked them to give me \"Indian spicy\" and they did. It was glorious. I would recommend their Masala and Vindaloo curries if you like a kick. Otherwise, stick with Chicken Korma.  The butter chicken here wasnt the best though - thus the one mark deduction. Kind of similar to creamy ketchupy taste. Not that bad either.  There are two stories and usually line ups out the door for dinner hours on Fridays/Weekends so call ahead or go a bit earlier.  Would recommend."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant. A little bit pricey but worth. They can  accommodate  the menu according to your envy. The staff very nice and the food amazing."}
{"text":"This past Friday I decided to have dinner at Little India for the first time around 6:30pm. My friend and I were seated upstairs since downstairs was completely full.   I decided to order the $17.95 dinner special and my friend ordered just the saag paneer. The special comprised of chicken pakoras, something along the lines of a chicken kebob, butter chicken, eggplant, rice and naan and kheer (indian rice pudding). I also noticed there were a lot of awards on their walls.  Here is my review.  Food: The chicken kebabs were really good: moist, juicy and flavourful.  The chicken pakoras along with the eggplant were just average.  The item that they really failed on was their butter chicken, the sauce was way too sweet, I'm not sure if they are trying to cater towards their demographics but butter chicken should not be that sweet.  Also the naan bread was a miss, it was way over toasted and not soft enough.  Service: This is the area they really excel on, someone always came around on a regular basis to fill your water and the waiter was quite attentive but not interrupting. The service is really good overall, especially considering, the waiter upstairs was juggling 8-10 tables.  Overall, the food doesn't warrant all the accolades it gets on this site or the awards it has received but the service is definitely top notch."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped in for dinner and had the dinner special for two. For just $31 there was more food than you could possibly eat and it included a great sampling of the menu. We'll definitely  come back !!"}
{"text":"This is probably the best Indian place I've ever been to.  Everything was very good, and they have a good selection of meat and vegetarian dishes.  The lunch buffet was 13$ after tax and tip and the waiters were very kind. Can't ask for much except maybe a larger seating area. I shared my table with an old couple, but I didn't care, it was a good time"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with lab. very busy place, but we were able to get a table quickly. Food: Generally good. Not over the top.  Appetizer section is quite small: papdi chat (not crisp; too sweet); pakoras (good) and tandoori chicken (probably the best item in the place) Vegetarian sabjis are alright. too many sabjis, I feel, for lunch time, especially given the clientele. Strange selection too: eggplant, mixed vegetable (Bland), palak paneer (not enough pieces). chole were good; Bombay aloo? nice flavor but too sweet meat dishes were alright as well: chicken curry was good, didn't try the shrimp curry (couldn't see any shrimp pieces); butter chicken was overwhelmingly sweet. Naan is fairly soft.  Gulab jamun is good. Overall, the taste of the food is highly variable...some items are good, most are only ok.  Heard a lot about this place, but for someone who's gone to indian buffets dozens of times, including some good ones, this was quite average."}
{"text":"Expect to wait for a table at this popular restaurant. The food is excellent and the staff are very friendly and courteous. The lamb rogan josh melts in the mouth and the chicken saag is also very good. For meat lovers the meat combo is highly recommended. Living in the US it is difficult to find good Indian food, so this was a real treat for us British ex-pats."}
{"text":"I've been to Little India twice - once for the lunch buffet and once for dinner - and both times I had a lovely experience.   I've lived in India and am married to an Indian, so I can get pretty picky about Indian food and both times I thought the dishes were very tasty and uniquely cooked, with a lot and different flavours from dish to dish. Loved the butter parathas too - perfect balance of fluffy and crispy!  What I appreciated most however was that the staff is very friendly, accommodating and calm even on very busy nights like tonight. Thank you, we will be back."}
{"text":"We went to Little India for dinner. While it is a bit of a walk from a subway station, it has a lot of seating. It can be a good spot for a date night or group meal.   We ordered the meat combo for one at $16.95. It came with tandoori chicken, lamb tikka, reshmi kebab, tandoori prawn, dhal curry, and pulao rice, and naan. We also ordered a gulab jamun (an Indian sweet) as well as a mutton roll (which is a spicy mutton dumpling).   The meat combo is a great dish if you want to try different types of food. I thought the tandoori chicken was subpar as it was pretty dry. The dish did come with this spinach sauce which gave it a nice twist. I didn't like the butter chicken because it was too sweet. The lamb tikka was okay. I liked the reshmi kebab and prawn. The kebab went well with that spinach sauce. I absolutely loved the dhal curry (the one with the chicken peas). It went really good with the naan and had the right amount of spice.  Overall, very good quantity and variety for the price. My guest and I split the meal for one as we weren't that hungry.   I also loved the mutton roll. I was surprised that it was available here. It had the right amount of spice and came with a sweeter sauce in case you couldn't handle the spice. The gulab jamun was also 10/10 because the syrup wasn't extremely sweet and the texture wasn't chunky. It hit the hotspot for sure.    They also had the kingfisher beer which I hadn't tried before. In case you are looking for new beers to try it. It was a fairly light beer.    Overall, I'd consider revisiting and trying other things. I think it is pretty good quality for downtown."}
{"text":"Was visiting Toronto for the first time and looking for a restaurant in the neighborhood where I was staying, and Little India came up on my Yelp as 4 stars.  After eating there, I wondered how it got 4 stars, and quickly realized that none of the reviewers must have been South Asian.  The food was okay, but was highly disappointed in the Chicken Biryani, which was basically chicken mixed up with some rice - that's it.  (Sorry, simply adding chicken to rice does not a biryani make!)  The prices were decent.  I should have hauled myself to Gerard Street for some real quality Indian fare."}
{"text":"3 for the food, but +1 star for the service.  The restaurant has 2 rooms: the first room was super packed when we came in, but because there was a second, much larger room, we didn't have to wait a long time for a seat despite not having reservations.  To start, they gave us a small dish of curried/spiced carrots and some fried chips (I have no idea what these were, but they were like fried, thin rice cakes?). The carrots had good heat, and still retained their sweetness.   I ordered the palak paneer ($13.50) and an order of naan ($2.50 - 2 pieces). However, the waiter took my order incorrectly (he thought I said butter chicken). After realizing his error, he apologized profusely (like, a lot) and ran back to the kitchen to correct the mistake. When my food was ready, he, quite literally, ran back to the table with my food since my friends were already eating. I really appreciated how much effort he took into making sure I wasn't too irritated (and I wasn't!). I also liked the frequent water filling."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with few friends and while the service was alright, the food was really meh.  $13-$15 for a small dish of their chicken, lamb, shrimp with Indian sauces. They all had maybe 5pieces of meat and all sauce.  The price was definitely not worth the food and I got sick after eating here.  Not recommended at all."}
{"text":"First off...very good and unobtrusive service.  These guys are professionals  Best suggestion is to eat as a pair and order the meat feast for 2 $40  Naan, pulao rice with a cherry on top, butter chicken, veggie curry, 2 tandoori breasts of chicken, 2 hunks of lamb, 2 shrimps, 2 mutton and veggies  It's spiced a notch above the standard fare but you will have no room for dessert  Great stuff from the Taj Mahal"}
{"text":"I really like this place! I'm a fan of Indian food (although I've been told that the owner/the food served is Sri Lankan?) and this is my favorite downtown core (Queen St) sit-down Indian restaurants that isn't borderline hole-in-the-wall (e.g. Saffron) or too fancy for just wanting to pig out (e.g. Aroma). It's a little tight inside the restaurant although there are 2 rooms, but does get quite loud since groups tend to come here (as well as couples and individuals). The interior is very warm (literally) and beautiful with white and red tablecloths and many cultural decorations.  The menu has lots of options, many of which I consider to be comfort foods. The mains' portion sizes are not very big at all, but since everything is seasoned so well and there's plenty of use of butter and cheeses you will not leave hungry. The presentations of the dishes here aren't what I would describe as classy/delicate btw - again, the focus here seems to be on taste and comfort :) There are also plenty of vegetarian options (not as much luck for vegans though) Naan/rice do need to be ordered separately unless you order a combo. If you do order a combo, I recommend the vegetarian thali (comes with lots of rice and naan as well as gulab jamun for dessert).  Service is also great! Your table will often have multiple waiters and they are all very attentive, fast, and nice. I've never made a reservation here before, but was always seated immediately even at peak times (i.e. Saturday night). But if you are coming with a group I recommend making a reservation in advance because the restaurant does fill up.   Overall, wonderful lunch (they have a buffet) or dinner spot for a group or something more intimate if you wish to explore Indian/Sri Lankan comfort foods and don't mind a bit of noise.  Lastly, this restaurant isn't super children-friendly at dinner because of the lack of space and dim lighting.  Food 4.5/5 Value 4/5 - for the portion sizes and environment vs price it's pretty good Service 5/5 venue 4/5"}
{"text":"This place is the best Indian you'll find around this area. Flavourful food, and with tons of veggie options!"}
{"text":"After my first time here last week, I still can't stop thinking about how amazing the butter chicken is. It's just the right amount of sweet.  I visited on an empty stomach, so naturally I wanted to load up on healthy stuff first. Which of course, this place satisfied the criteria. The house salad and dressing was delish (light balsamic-style with flavours of onion) and the oranges were nicely sliced into thin  discs. And the pineapple was good too!  Then I moved onto the veggie dishes -- curried peas, green beans, etc. Sorry, I can't remember much of this...blame it on the butter chicken. It was the headliner.   And for $11.99? C'mon, what more can you ask for. They've been getting accolades for years now!  I will be back. With guests. With an emptier stomach."}
{"text":"Little India used to be my go to for Indian food, but recently the quality of the food has been declining. Also, they seem to be misreading online orders... I would recommend going somewhere else. There are a lot of other nice Indian restaurants in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"Decided to have some AYCE Indian lunch buffet at noon on a Saturday. During our 2 hour meal the restaurant filled up really quickly. The price was really good for an AYCE buffet located downtown and the service was great - very attentive and quick. The food was really flavourful and really comparable to one that is said to be well known in the Markham area. My boyfriend had been there a couple of times before, and noticed that they had increased their food selections there. I would definitely go back to Little India restaurant if I'm around the area and craving Indian food."}
{"text":"Hit with a wicked Indian craving my friend and I decided to try out Little India, primarily because of the Lunch buffet for $10.95. We both have wheat related allergies, so we were happy when we confirmed the only buffet item with gluten and/or wheat was the naan (obviously it has wheat).  I loaded up my plate with a good sampling of their vegetarian dishes plus a curry chicken, and pappadums which I love. The food was really good, very rich, one plate was much too much. I was impressed with the food, tastes delicious, I will warn it is very rich so make sure not to over indulge.   The dessert buffet was pretty much just fruit and tapioca which was about all either of us could eat.  My only complaint was the lack of samosas. I will reinforce the warning about overindulgance - personally I ate way too much and was lethargic for the next 3 hours."}
{"text":"Little India is a quality Indian restaurant, with a nice decor and good tasting food. I had the chicken tikka masala which came with plenty of chicken but could have been a bit larger for the price. I added a side of naan bread which was well worth it. A friend of mine ordered the biryani and couldn't finish half because of the spice. (A few tears were shed). The restaurant is dimly lit which actually made the restaurant seem fancier than it was. I would return."}
{"text":"BIG PORTION!!  We ordered a meat combo for two, and it can easily feed three or even four people!! Such a good deal, so you wouldn't regret of ordering this combo.  You get to try a variety of meats, seafood, butter chicken, and veggie curry of the day, pulao rice, and naan. Like seriously, almost everything you wish you could order at any Indian places! Food tasted good too. Not too spicy but still flavorful.   I have tried many Indian places in Toronto downtown, and this is one of my go-to places when I crave for Indian food."}
{"text":"We arrived here after seeing the Cavalcade of Lights, so there was a bit of a line ahead of us and the restaurant was quite busy. One of the workers was bringing some of the people in line to their other location next door, which helped with the wait time.  We were eventually seated after 10 minutes or so. The place is small, cozy, and dimly lit. After much deliberation, we settled on butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, naan, and pulao rice.   The food arrived quickly and the service was prompt. The butter chicken was extraordinarily sweet, in a jarring way. The portion size was also quite small. I wouldn't order it again. The lamb vindaloo, however, was definitely the highlight of the meal -- very bold flavours with a lot of spice. So much in fact we were sweating! Very enjoyable nonetheless.  Overall the food wasn't too bad, and the service was great. But you could probably find better for the same price."}
{"text":"Went for the lunch buffet earlier today, as I was craving Indian food. In terms of size, I've seen some bigger buffets out there, but there are a solid number of selections. Among the offerings were the standard chicken tandoori, plus butter chicken, chicken vindaloo, yellow daal, spinach, chicken and vegetable pakoras, chickpeas, and a number of salad dishes, plus multiple desserts (I enjoyed the gulab jamun and rice pudding) and quite a few chutneys. While many buffets tend to be bland, this one actually had some spicier dishes, which was nice to see. The servers were friendly, and dirty dishes were cleared promptly. They were also good about intercepting a woman who tried to go back up with a dirty plate. Is it the best Indian food I've ever had? No. But it was good, plentiful, and reasonably priced, all served by nice people in a comfortable environment. Perhaps on a food level I'd call it 3.5 stars, but the intangibles make it worthy of rounding up. I'd go back if I were in town again and craving an Indian buffet lunch."}
{"text":"Recommended by our hotel concierge we decided to have dinner here last night. Dinner is not a buffet but lots of dishes and combos to choose from that let you taste several dishes. After a long day of travel the service was prompt and very friendly but the atmosphere is nothing special. My rating really relates to food and service.   We started with the vegetarian appetizer platter that had four different items and one of the best veggie samosas I've ever tried. The pastry was light and not greasy and filled full with veggies and spices.  For dinner we had the vegetarian platter featuring samples of several dishes, vegetable pulao rice, raita and really fresh hot naan bread. Everything had good flavor but if I had to rate the least impressive the palak paneer was only OK. Definitely worth a try when you are looking for Indian food."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today during lunch hour and maaannnnn, the place smelled like mad incense (to diffuse the strong food smell am assuming) and spices mushed together once we got in. I have no problem with it but its just something to keep in mind for those picky with places that prefers a scent free environment.  The food was also really good and I was particularly fond of their Butter chicken. Love it. Even my hubby loved every single item on the buffet area and he was all about the naan which he said was really good.  You have to try this place when you can. Go during the buffet hours (lunch time) so you can try whatever type of food and see for yourself. The selections arent so extensive but its great flavour nonetheless. I guess we paid around almost $30 not incl. tip for the two of us so its a dang good price if you ask me.   And I just want to say that the servers here are all so awesome. Very nice staff all around and so honest too.. and I say honest because my hubby left his phone in there when we left and once we realized it, we came all the way running back and they gave it back to him right away. Such good people I tell you!  I recommend coming here if your into trying indian food or love the food for that matter. And we will be back soon as well!"}
{"text":"Food was really good, service was very nice too even the place was packed we had everything on time and the waiters were nice. The meat combo for two was really big we had to take some stuff home. The kheer was delicious really creamy and it tastes fresh. I will definitely come back for food only. The reason that i gave 4 stars is because the butter chicken was super sweet yuck, the rasmalai had that refrigerator taste so it was not fresh and i got instant coffee ewwwwww."}
{"text":"Tandoori chicken was a little too salty. Have definitely had better. Paneer makhni was excellent and would come back just for this dish. Naans were very good (ask for them to be buttered). Chicken pakora app was good but nothing special. Mango lassi was very good. Waiter (older aged) wasn't very friendly. Younger staff were more friendly. Food is on the pricey side so be prepared to pay."}
{"text":"If you are looking for Indian food that will knock your socks off please go to little india.   Little India is an incredible restaurant in toronto. Frankly, it has zero competition and will remain one of the best restaurants in toronto.   I love their veggie pakoras, onion bhajia, and samosas!  IMO the best thing I've had here is the lamb rogan josh. Incredible.  I've had the butter chicken, chicken korma,  chicken tikka masala,  and the tandoori meats. They are all delicious too. But my heart remains with the rogan josh.  Naan and rice is great. I look forward to having all the vegetarian dishes in one sitting in the near future. I love you Little India"}
{"text":"Review by a vegan.   Mediocre food.  Bharta tasteless and old. Pakoras greasy and a bit dry. The dal was not puréed lentil but a dal makhani that lacked flavour. Aloo Gobi nicely prepped with fresh tomatoes but seasoned with cinnamon and cardamom which is not my thing, though it would be good if it were yours. The salad tasted of Indian soap and needed a wash. If you like garlic, fresh ginger, coriander, nigella, fresh cilantro etc then this is not the place for you either. I paid $70 for delivery of the above and it was so not worth it."}
{"text":"We just ordered over $50 of take out for two people, we had the Pulao Rice, Butter Chicken, Tandoori Chicken, Vegetable Korma and Paneer Makhani. WORST INDIAN FOOD EVER! I love Indian food and have eaten my fair share. This doesn't taste authentic at all, but not only that it's barely edible.The butter chicken tastes as though they took tomato paste (or even ketchup) and added a tiny bit of spice and about a half a bag of sugar. It was WAY too sweet. Ick. They used this same yucky sauce for the Paneer Makhani. The Tandoori chicken was dry. And the vegetable korma was just a bag of frozen veg thrown into some curry sauce, that was again way too sweet. I don't know what the cooks predilection to over sweeten everything is all about, but it's bad. There is no balance of flavours in any of the dishes.The best part of the meal was the plain rice. It was sad. I will never order from there again as a bottle of butter chicken sauce from the grocery store blows this place out of the water, and thats not saying much. AVOID."}
{"text":"This has been the go to Indian place for me for a while, just because of convenience. After today, I will not be going back. We have had a few issues with freshness, but it's the terrible service that really stands out. There are better options in Toronto!"}
{"text":"After walking along Queen W for awhile I started to feel the hunger pains creep in so i decided to rest my old feet and feed my stomach here.  I've been here before and had their lunch buffet but since I was here after lunch but before the typical dinner time it was choice from menu.  I kept it simple and ordered the papadams (lentil like crackers is the easiest way to describe it) and my usual love - chicken biryani.    The chicken biryani was delicious - fragrant and spicy and the chicken was nice and moist.  The portion is big enough for 2 people to split as a smaller meal (but good for me cuz it means I have leftovers for dinner tonight!)  The restaurant is actually prtty big - there is another room on the side for additional seating.  The service is quick and pleasant and they have more than enough staff to accommodate the diners.     The lunch buffet is of course their big hit - having had it before you can obviously try various curries etc - great option for someone not too familiar with Indian food.  They serve various regions of Indian food here - north, south - so you can choose to your heart's delight!  The lunch menu also has a veggie and a meat platter dish so you can try a variety of items as well.  I would have gone with this but it would be too much for one person and I didn't want to end up in a food coma afterwards as I still had some shopping left to do.  Little India is definitely big on pleasant service and food."}
{"text":"Went today for the $10.99 lunch buffet, and they had THE BEST BUTTER CHICKEN I think I've ever had!  At many places, the butter chicken can be bland or very mild in flavor. Not here -- this is butter chicken with personality, a distinctive and delicious taste that's all flavor without the hotness.  Everything else was high-quality, and the curry chicken was definitely different than normal, making for a nice change of pace."}
{"text":"Mediocre Indian food - not much different than any other Indian restaurant you come too. Unfortunately due to dietary restrictions some of the better deals (like the thali) were out of the question. I would have recommended this!   I ordered the eggplant ban gain and my bf had some sort of chicken curry. I was sad to see the treatment of the eggplant, this dish is usually not so creamy! But it was still ok, didn't get much of the eggplant flavour though. The naan was ok, could have been softer.   Service is pretty good, waiters are very knowledgable about the food (good because we had lots of questions!) the food came out very fast as well, I think we waited about 10 minutes!"}
{"text":"Sorry folks, but I ate here last night for dinner with the hubby and ordered the Chef Tasting Menu for $16.95 per person and it was mediocre at best.  Smokey tandoor flavored cottage cheese was our starter - meh.   Butter chicken, saag paneer, rice, naan, and the most hysterical part of our main dish array was the sizzling plate that came out which was lamb chops on top of slices of onion.  I expected the lamb to be hot, but it was tepid and it made me laugh to hear the plate sizzle so much but the food be cold.  The dessert disappointed me completely - it tasted like melted orange sherbet ice cream.  I'd much rather have those cottage cheese fried balls with rosewater.  Quality of the food is not great - I've had better.  MUCH better - like at Amaya on Bayview.  Or Babur, further down Queen West.  We were seated upstairs b/c it was totally packed - I didn't even know this place had an upstairs till last night!  LOL...service was fair but due to the fact that I didn't find the quality up to snuff, I don't think we'll be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet at $11.95 is reasonable. Comfortable environment, fresh naan supplied, tasty tandoori chicken. The demerit is insufficient salad selection and each salad is mixed with syrup."}
{"text":"Super cute restaurant, really good Indian food, not very much options but the portions are big ad the quality of the food is great so overall it's pretty good.   I definitely recommend it if your in the area!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Butter Chicken and Raita that I've had in my life. The Butter Chicken was so incredibly sweet as well as the Raita. It was like they dumped a ton of sugar in it. It's so sweet it made me sick, like I was going into diabetic shock. The garlic kulcha and Kashmiri naan were good. The man on the phone taking my carry out order was very nice and polite. Great customer service, he even gave me carrots and 10% off my bill for no reason. Won't be ordering from here again.   My boyfriend says that it was decent. He felt that it was a little too sweet at first, but he enjoyed the spicy after taste. He enjoyed the naan. He wouldn't order it again."}
{"text":"Little India is one of my favourite Indian restaurants in downtown.  Opt for Lunch not Dinner. The lunch buffet is plentiful and you can choose what you like. It is the same price as ordering a la carte. My favourite is the Shrimp Jalfrezi Curry, Butter Chicken, Chicken Pakoras and Garlic Naan. You even get ice-cream.  If you check in on yelp, you get a free appetizer. We order two dishes and some naan. For two people, that is waaayyyyyy too much food. Also the Shrimp Jalfrezi is a way smaller version at dinner. The lamb biryani is so aromatic and flavourful."}
{"text":"My go to indian food place. Been to the location a few times and ordered delivery over 10 times.  The vindaloo curry is amazing. But its really spicy, I usually get it with chicken and it's so good with their naan. Their naan is also so tasty and is a massive size naan. You will want to keep eating.  Also tried their lamb curry gosht and it's not spicy but very flavourful and has some potato and veg also.    My favourite app is the veggie pakora, 6 pieces and its so crispy and delicious it's really hard to stop eating. But I also enjoy the samosa which is packed with veggie filling and are large in size.  Also tried their chicken biryani and its a good portion and slightly spicy but very flavourful."}
{"text":"Seems to be a popular place, it was quite busy. The lunch buffet goes until 3:30 whereas most places go to 2:30. The food was just OK, I've had better. The Tandoori chicken was very dry and not much flavor, as well a lot of the items on the buffet were dry from being out too long. Another annoyance was that they do not accept payment by debit - only credit or cash. However, the service was very good and the staff friendly. The locals seemed to really like it but I don't think I would go back."}
{"text":"Have received confirmation by an Indian friend that this place is the real deal, and as an outsider, I would like to agree. Absolutely the best butter chicken I've ever had, and served with the plain paratha, is a perfect Sunday night staple.  Have tried spicier fare that did not disappoint, but it's hard to break my pattern here."}
{"text":"\"The best butter chicken recipe and worth the price of the buffet\"  So here's the thing. Been going to this place since I was a student at the University of Toronto because of the value. To be fair, MOST of the food is very mediocre at best. The buffet layout is very \"greasy spoon\" and most of it is generic or different than traditional Indian recipes.  Atmosphere is a bit crowded and tight but they've done so well that they've assimilated a few of the neighbouring properties for space and have an upstairs as well.    The reason I rate it 4 out of 5, is that the butter chicken they cook. The recipe specifically is just a little \"different\" than the way most Indian places do it or how my mother makes it. I think they add a bit more tomato paste or something a little sweeter that makes the sauce just a tad bit more delicious.   For $11.95, its worth it from the buffet, or you can buy it to go for the same price I believe. Nice flavours, and good selection. It's not true Indian food, but it's a good spin and twist and is a good selection if you're looking for something like this for lunch or take out. Heck throw in dinner too."}
{"text":"Delicious. Excellent service. Great staff. Sweet tasty butter chicken. Free appetizer.  This place is awesome. I was craving some good ol' butter chicken to warm myself up on a cold winter day. I haven't been to a lot of Indian restaurants; this place served ONLY butter chicken for 15.95. No rice or naan along with it. Pretty expensive in my opinion. I ended up also ordering a naan on the side which paired with the butter chicken perfectly. It's tastefully sweet, just the way I like it as I can't eat spicy very well. The service was absolutely amazing. Servers are great.   It was worth every dollar. I'll have to go searching for other cheaper options but if this is the best it gets, I'm willing to come back!"}
{"text":"This review is about their buffet only:  Meat dishes are mediocre at best. Vegetarian dishes are good. Service is OK. Last several times I went there for lunch I spent the the afternoon in the bathroom. I am avoiding this place for now. :("}
{"text":"This is a take away review, haven't eaten at the restaurant itself.  I've tried indian restaurants in many parts of Toronto, and I personally think this place does the best creamier curry dishes, like butter chicken, in Toronto.  The naan bread they do tends not to get so burnt like other places.   5 stars for the sauces they can produce.  Their appetisers seem to be a little better/crunchier/fresher than other indian restaurants in the downtown area, but that might just be personal preference.  The portions really are a good size for takeaway (and they seem to throw in some free papadums with take out unlike some competitors in the area)."}
{"text":"They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder, I guess taste runs along the same lines. Anyone who gives this place less than 4 stars needs help. This is authentic Indian cuisine with a large selection of very different dishes. I see some people complaining that the butter chicken was too sweet. Well, I don't have diabetes, so it wasn't a problem for me. In fact, I loved it. Some Indian restaurants make their butter chicken savoury/spicy, while some make it sweet. Every dish I've eaten here is excellent. Their meat/kabab platter, Lamb Roginjosh, Prawns, Shrimp Vindaloo, Tandoori Chicken. There's another Lamb dish they make as well which is excellent. The food is awesome. Price is extremely reasonable, especially considering how expensive eating out in Toronto can be."}
{"text":"Cheap Indian buffet, if you just want quantity, you'll get it here despite the very limited dish selections. The butter chicken is not bad, but everything else did not seem worth getting.   The service was average, I think we came on a bad day. We witnessed the manager of the place lecturing the employees to work properly.  Some plates were not clean, utensils had weird stains on them as well.  Overall, it's not a bad place to fill your stomach for a decent price, considering its located downtown."}
{"text":"We had intended to go to Babur (base off a recommendation) for lunch  but they weren't open yet so we stopped here. It was a good alternative. A nice buffet of interesting food that was well prepared. Pretty good selection of food.  The butter chicken was good but a little on the sweeter side.  Service was excellent for the buffet...Staff were friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Namaste butter chicken haven. You want authentic Delhi Butter Chicken - sweetish, red in color as opposed to the orange-ish North American variant, fresh? This resraurant will serve you it and more with soft white rice and let's not forget to order the fluffy naans. And I've never had better. This is coming from someone who has lived in Delhi, so take my word for it.  For an Indian food first timer, I highly suggest opting for the meat combo ($16.95 for one/ $31.95 for two). It's a platter of Tandoori chicken (think dry bbq chicken), Reshmi Kebab (soft kebabs), Lamb Tikka, Tandoori prawn (dry), Butter Chicken (the best, you'll want more), pulao rice, vegetable curry, and naan bread. My boyfriend and I ordered \"for one\" since we weren't too hungry and I'll tell ya this, it was quite the feast. He wanted to try some different types of Indian food, hence the order. Else, I'd just order rice, naan and a large portion of butter chicken.   Apart from the food, the restaurant is small but immaculate and classy in appearance. The prices are hard to beat. It's perfect for a affordable romantic dinner. As for a verdict, I am totally coming back; although I'd like to try the two restaurants adjacent to it as well, both Indian, Trimurti and India Palace."}
{"text":"Visited this place a few  days ago. Coming back from lndia just a few weeks back, me and my friend wanted to try Canadian-lndian culinary creations. We booked the reservation a day ahead, since the place is relatively busy. Nice ambience, but tables seem to be squeezed a bit to accomodate the  customers( who needs to hear other customers chatting etc?) There is quite a few dishes to choose from, but we choose vegetarian thali. We did not wait too long, the waiter brought us the meal. Looked nice, but not warm enough, and is was just a bit \" neutral\" spicy..lol That was not exactly a thali as we know from lndia, it was just 3 \"samples\" to try, with some veggies on the side ( quite tasty), with good carrot pickle as well. Raita...could be so much better, parathas on the other hand were quite tasty, freshly made. We ordered a dessert which was tasty ( not too sweet), and mango lassi-but tasted like from the conventrated pulp. Staff was polite and accomodating. Overall it was an average experience. Maybe we will come again to try meat dishes."}
{"text":"I'm not from Toronto but when I visit I always go to Little India Restaurant. I'm still looking for an Indian restaurant where I live that lives up to the bar set by this restaurant.   I've tried numerous items form the menu, each one was unforgettable but I usually get Chicken Vindaloo. It's incredibly spicy but the white rice and naan help cool your mouth down. Definitely try the mango juice you won't regret it! The staff is really friendly. I've never had a bad experience here."}
{"text":"God bless gulab jamun, those delicious sugary balls of honey flavoured goodness. When I asked the guy at Little India what the mysterious brown balls were called he said, \"Those? Those are the drugs.\"   And man, he is correct!  In terms of the rest of the food, it's also really tasty and plentiful. The butter chicken is spicy but sweet like it should be, the mango lassies are fantastic and the price is right. I would give the restaurant four stars, but the gulab jamun! It bumps it up to a five."}
{"text":"Good food overall. I ordered paneer tikka and kuthu parantha. I liked the paneer tikka but the kuthu parantha was super super spicy. I am usually a good spice eater but this one was way too over that I had to return it back. Waiter was nice and he didn't charge me as well and that is why 4 Stars."}
{"text":"Great authentic Indian Food. Loved the chicken korma and beef vindaloo, they recently added mutton rolls to the menu-AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a while so while in the downtown core one day, decided to give it a go.  Upon entering the restaurant, there's two options.....take the stairs up to the 2nd floor or enter the main floor restaurant. There's a sign once you come in saying \"Please wait to be seated\"..which is only if you want to use the main floor dining lounge. Otherwise, you can just go right upstairs.  Food is served buffet.....its a small selection but enough to fill your boots. As with other reviews, I found the butter chicken a bit on the sweet side, but other dishes were excellent.  The curry chicken had a nice heat to it, as did the Chana Masala.  Tandori chicken was meaty..the person I dined with got a full breast (unheard of)..and the nan bread was very good.  Male staff member on the 2nd floor was friendly.  Reasonably priced buffet for quality"}
{"text":"I had just returned from India and figured I could experience good Indian meals while on business in Toronto. Not so. My meal at Little India was the most expensive and the worst. Very far removed from what is served in India, which I expected, but not to that extent. Stay away if you have a trained palate."}
{"text":"After being here a few times, I've decided the food isn't good enough to warrant the pretty terrible service."}
{"text":"Little India is one of my favourite Indian restaurants in the downtown core.   I recommend ordering a la carte as opposed to getting the buffet. The buffet is not terrible, but when you order a la carte the food is much more fresh. I feel as though it has a different taste when you get it from the buffet.   The prices are very reasonable. If I am eating with someone who eats meat, I normally get the veggie thali. That plate is good for dinner, and also for leftovers the next day. My counterparts usually get the meat thali. Warning- you WILL leave this restaurant smelling strongly like curry. My partner refuses to come here before we go out.   The service is very good. I usually always get the same waiter(s) every time, and I have been coming here for more than 8 years, so that says something.   My parents also enjoy this restaurant immensely, even my mom who is very very picky about her East Indian food. We are all East Indians btw, and my mom is an excellent cook.   Some of my favourite dishes; baingan bharta and vegetable jalfrezi.   Overall a good dining experience, and a cozy setting (though a bit cramped). I would recommend it for a date (as long as you enjoy the smell of curry afterwards)."}
{"text":"Review is based on the lunch buffet, which was a decent, reasonably priced experience, but nothing special.  Place was somewhat busy for a Monday lunch, but plenty of tables available (especially with their next-door expansion). Service was pleasant and we were seated promptly.  The buffet offers most of your standard to-be-expected options: random salad, lentil soup, chana masala, some aloo gobi, a paneer dish or two, pakora, chicken madras, tandoori chicken, and a few other items I can't recall off the the top of my head. It was disappointing that they did not have palak/saag paneer in the buffet; one of my favourite dishes. Also disappointing, though not overly surprising, is the lack of a lamb option (e.g. lamb vindaloo), but oh well. Apparently they change the buffet everyday so it's possible I was just unlucky. Naan was decently fresh and served as a part of the buffet, though I prefer places where the naan is made to order (even if it is a buffet). As far as overall flavours were concerned, everything was OK and nothing stood out as overly bad or good. It was pretty average tasting Indian food as far as I know.  For $15 the lunch buffet is quite reasonably priced given the downtown location. You would be hard pressed to find a more filling meal anywhere else at this price.  All being said, I wouldn't mind coming back!"}
{"text":"Very tasty and well-prepared Indian food, though definitely not upscale or gourmet in quality.   What we did enjoy about this place was the very generous portions at very reasonable prices.  Decor is a bit shopworn, but service was excellent.  Appetizers were tasty but would have liked to have seen a few things that weren't deep fried.    For $4.95, the generous sampler is a very good buy.  My lamb biryani was rather mild, but the lamb was tasty and tender.  My partner was satisfied with his chicken madras too.  Side orders here like chutney and raita are very reasonable, unlike the huge markups of some Indian restaurants.  I have not  been to their lunch buffet but would like to try it.  All in all, a good choice for reasonable dining in the Queen West area."}
{"text":"Butter chicken tasted vaguely of ketchup. Chicken korma was bland. Lamb vindaloo was OK but it was all topped off by pretty expensive prices. I'd look elsewhere."}
{"text":"The place was packed when I went for lunch - a good sign! Probably the best Indian buffet I've had in Toronto! The lunch buffet costs $10.95.   Great if you want a taste of everything. Not quite as good as some al a carte  but what do you expect from buffets??"}
{"text":"Came here for a lunch buffet on Thursday with a party of twelve people.  The restaurant is pretty spacious and have two sections for dining.  The food was delicious - moderate selections of vegetarian and meat dishes.  The meat dishes were only chicken - pakora chicken, tandoori chicken and butter chicken.  Veggies consist of lentil, chick peas, spring rolls, veggie pakora and spinach. Too bad they didn't have aloo gobi cause that's my favorite veggie dish!  They have a selection of salad, fruits and desserts.  As well as four flavours of ice cream (mango, vanilla, chocolate and strawberry)"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with a few friends. The food was great and service was ok. Price is also reasonable. We had the korma, paneer, eggplant and egg roti. I would recommend the paneer and korma. We had ordered this hot sizzling meat dish but it never came. For that I am only giving them a 4. The waiter was not really totally all there."}
{"text":"It was this desire to eat spicy which drove us to this Indian restaurant. It was recommended from a local colleague. The interior decoration is simple but nice. They have a lunch buffet too. The food was spicy and tasty. We enjoyed it. The cooked rice quality was high and that's a good sign. The service was friendly and for the food you get, it's a cheap restaurant."}
{"text":"Only been here for the lunch buffet which has risen in price from $13 to $17 since I first went here. On the outside it looks really small and the buffet table looks tiny compared to other buffet restaurants but I think they cover all the basic Indian dishes and is fairly reasonably priced for downtown Toronto. Some of the dishes are: Chaat papri, butter chicken (a bit sweeter than what I am used to), palak paneer, samosas, pakora, aloo gobi, tandoori chicken, dal, lamb curry. As well as the usual rice, naan, salads and chutneys. Dessert options are more limited with usually just gulab jamun and a couple ice cream flavours but to be honest, I have usually stuffed myself too much at the buffet to be able to eat dessert.  It really depends what food you are looking for, with buffets you get quantity over quality and that is definitely the case here. But still if you order off the menu the food is basically the same to me, yes a little more fresh and more variety but in the end it's all pretty generic and what I would probably call \"Indian fast food\". Probably not the place if you want truly authentic Indian food but still good enough to satisfy a craving every once in a while for me."}
{"text":"Open buffet Tandoori Chicken! Found this place through Yelp, walking distance from where I stay. Very nice place, totally Indian. A little shabby but it's okay. They have the best price for open buffet Indian food. You need to go a little early for lunch as it is a quite busy place."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Little India.  I ordered a dish that offered several types of meat and I ordered an okra to go along with it.  The meat plate came with butter chicken and a variety of lamb and chicken pieces.    The food was very dry and over cooked.  The food that should have been hot and spicy was mild and the butter chicken was very spicy.  A very confusing meal.  They were able to accommodate me by providing some gluten free options.  I had to drink a lot of water to get the tandoori chicken down.  It was drier than the napkin.  I might give this place a second try, but it was not one of the better experiences I have had with Indian food."}
{"text":"Excellent service and decent food. I loved their onion bhaji and pakora. The food was fresh and flavourful. Dim lights and cozy environment make it perfect for dinner."}
{"text":"Great menu, lots of choice and very tasty at an affordable price.  The Buffet at the weekend isn't as off putting as I thought it would be.  Food was kept fresh and warm.   Staff are friendly and it's been busy each time I've been."}
{"text":"Great food with just the right amount of spice.  Very friendly And polite staff giving a  higher than average service. The place is a little cramped. and it might be hard to get the smell out of you cote later on. Next time I will do take out just because of smell"}
{"text":"Little India is the last man standing. Ten years ago there were three Indian restaurants within the same small block, including my favourite Trimurti.   It's a compact restaurant but with two floors of space, and a buffet on each one. I came for the lunch buffet special.   Overall a pleasant Indian lunch experience. Butter chicken was sweet and not spicy. Palak paneer was fine. I enjoyed the dessert selection. Only plain basmati rice.  Naan was flat and not great.   Not too much to choose from and food was fairly standard. But it's by default the best Indian in the area. I'll come to get my fix but not exactly anything memorable at lunch.   3 stars out of 5.   Jimmy's Yelp Ratings Scale for Food: [*] Disappointing. Just...no.  [**] Not very good. Will not return.  [***] It is what it is. Go enough times and you'll break even on quality.  [****] My go-to place. Rarely disappoints.  [*****] Everything on menu is good. Every time."}
{"text":"Given that their average rating is better than the one I gave them, I'm guessing that they must specialize in South Indian cuisine - at least not North Indian. First of all you must know that the smoke from the incense they were burning was very thick, and you will smell like smoke when you leave. Anyway the butter chicken was reminiscent of ketchup but with a slightly spicy finish. Very dark and very sweet. Not like traditional butter chicken sauce at all. Shahi paneer was so bland I had to ask for salt just to pep it up a bit. Rice is not included with entrees - have to purchase it a la carte. Naan and rice were okay - nothing special. The mango lassi was the best thing we had. It was good, but we've had better."}
{"text":"Best Indian food downtown!!! I'm a carnivore so the meat platter is what I get all the time. Great service as well. Only down side is that the place is small."}
{"text":"Scammy business model!!  I ordered from the tasteaway website in which there is a mandatory delivery charge.  When the driver arrives, he stood their awarkly expecting a tip.  After informing me that he only gets a \"PORTION\" of the delivery charge, I ended up tipping the guy.  I normally don't tip when there is a delivery fee, but I felt guilty when the restaurant rips him off.  So what's going on exactly?  Little india is pocketing a portion of the delivery charge even though they do nothing on their end to deliver the food.  Why should I have to pay a delivery fee AND make up the difference with tips for the driver.    This sort of practice should be banned.  This restaurant is obviously making the driver and the customer its victims."}
{"text":"It started off okay when we arrived.  We were seated and given menus ASAP, but we didn't get water until after a long time.  The restaurant was busy, but I felt that the service was a lot slower than it should be that even our water was not filled for long stretches.  I ordered chicken vindaloo medium spicy level and my friend ordered a beef dish and asked for it to be extra spicy.  Guess what?  Mine was like \"fire\" and my friend's was not very spicy, but she was okay without making a fuss about her dish.  Mine was even too spicy for her to switch so after a long time I got a waiter's attention and told him they probably mistakenly switched up the wrong spice levels, but he was adamant that vindaloo's spicy so I must be wrong and there was no offer to help me except that I was persistent so he offered yogurt, but when I asked if it would change the taste (which I knew it would) he brought my dish to the kitchen see what they could do.  When the waiter returned, my dish looked like a lighter colouring instead of red like how vindaloo should be and it tasted sweet.  It was really late so I just ate the dish, but when he came to check, I advised him that it tastes and looks like butter chicken instead of vindaloo and told him that I know what vindaloo should taste like since I've eaten it before, and my friend vouched for me since she grew up with Indian cuisine.  Eventually, it was nice that they gave me a half portion of vindaloo when we were finished eating.  I would not return again and go to somewhere like Dhabba or Bombay Palace where I use to go regularly.  If it weren't for the mix up and especially for the lack of good customer service skills and \"lying to me\" than I would give a better rating, but with poor service they don't deserve a higher rating.  After tax and tip, I paid $19 to get the wrong dish that they tried to claim was the right dish and then they fixed it by giving me an unexpected half portion when we were finished dinner.  Too little too late."}
{"text":"I always enjoyed going to Little India but faced an unrealistic situation. One of my friends came from out of town and I wanted her to try some good food in Toronto and decided to take her to Little India..But little did i know..They embarassed me so much and I wouldnt want to go there again. My friend asked them if their meat was halal as i recalled that this place offered that. But when she asked to see the certificate (she explained later that in many countries that she visited, many places would claim that but wouldnt be able to prove it) and they got all funny on us and rude and defensive. my friend was trying to calm down the weightier as he was freaking out. That really bothered me of how they dealt with this situation and i asked him to calm down. But he was extremely rude to the point i got up from my seat and wanted to leave. I asked politely for then to apologize to my friend for the bad conduct but that went in vein.  I always enjoyed the food there but embarrassing me and lying about your certifications isnt professional at all. P.S the certificate turns out to be back from 2010 and they haven't renewed it since then. So them claiming they are halal, is bullcrap. There needs to be a check for these restaurants to see if they are in compliance to what they advertise."}
{"text":"I came here for the lunch buffet. I'd been told it was really great by a friend of a friend. There was a nice amount of variety, more then I'm used to at a buffet, and everything was solid. It also just wasn't great and the price was a bit high. There is so much great Indian food in Toronto, I can't imagine coming back here."}
{"text":"Food tasted great. Buffet is the way to go, come hungry! Not sure how it compares with the restaurants in little India on Gerard Street"}
{"text":"Little India serves your standard Indian fare, typically what's expected and with great service.  Two of us shared a vegetable thali entree ($12) and a vegetarian appetizer set ($5); including a glass of mango lassi, the total only came to $24 and we were both stuffed!  I enjoyed the palak paneer and most of the sides were not overly salty or greasy (at least not in terms of Indian cuisine).  Even though we had only ordered one entree, the staff decided to be generous and gave us two desserts.  Mmmm, the gulab jambu here really sealed the deal for me!"}
{"text":"I came here based on the reviews on Yelp. I order the dinner vegetable combination plate and my brother had the dinner meat combination plate. Both were delicious and the service as very good. The place is a bit small and it's definitely busy, as other patrons were asked to upstairs for food service when the downstairs filled up.  I thought the naan was good, but a little bland.  Otherwise, it was a great meal."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times since it's really close to my house. I've tried the butter chicken, palak paneer, chicken tikka masala, and today I had the chicken korma. I agree with what others have said about the butter chicken- it's super sweet (not my cup of tea). The rest of the dishes are all okay-not the best Indian I've ever had, but not the worst. Most of the dishes just aren't super flavourful, the palak paneer in particular. My favourite items, though, are the chicken korma and garlic naan. Also, when you get takeout, they always throw in some pappadums, yum!"}
{"text":"Just came back from dinner here with my family and my in-laws, who are in town.  Not as good as I expected.  There were 8 of us, but I don't think that meant we had to wait 30 minutes for our appetizer and then another 20 or so minutes for 5 dishes.  Tandoori Chicken - I liked it; juicy and flavorful Little India Fish Curry - Crispy fish, tasty sauce Butter Chicken - too sweet for my liking; I've had better Bhuna - very tasty  I prefer Bombay Bhel over this place.  However, I'm a firm believer in second chances so perhaps one day I'll try the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"I walked by this restaurant in one afternoon and decided to give it a try.  I am disappointed to their curry. The curry is bland and the chicken is not fresh. It tastes like it have been sitting in the fridge for a long time.  It is not authentic but a Western indian restaurant.  It is like you want to eat good Chinese food and you found out you are actually in Mandarin.  I would not recommend people to get their curries from here."}
{"text":"I was passing by Queen Street with my friends on a Saturday evening and saw this place. It was one of the restaurants that I read about in a local newspaper, so I was excited to try this place.  We read over the menu (on the window) and noticed that there was a daily special for $12 (includes one samosa, butter chicken, aloo ghobi(vegetarian), naan bread, rice, and dessert(sweet ball)). That hooked us right in!  Food: Butter chicken and Aloo Ghobi came in small containers. Don't be fooled by their small size. My friend and I were full after eating them both with rice! We really loved warm naan breads and rice with a bit of spice. The dessert(sweet ball) was also yummy, but was very sweet, so eating one was enough.  Service: The waiter took our orders, came by occasionally to remove empty dishes on the table, and fill more water.  The only thing that I didn't like was: the waiter removed some of the dishes too quick, so I had to ask him to let us keep them on the table.  I would come by here again!"}
{"text":"As everyone has already stated the butter chicken was the worst I've ever had. It was like someone poured very sweet spaghetti sauce over chicken. I couldn't even finish it.  The palak paneer was...  Okay, wouldn't get it again. Everything was quite expensive for the quality of food. I won't order from here again."}
{"text":"I would rate this place 3.5 stars. Pros: - Location is great - Butter chicken had only white meat - Waiters were friendly - Food was served in less than 10 min. Cons: - Butter chicken was very sweet and too spicy for my taste. Our waiter explained that their butter chicken is not spicy so we ordered it mild. When the waiter brought it to the table, he said \"not spicy\", however, it was. We were later told that the spiciness is masked with sweetness... but some people complain that this dish is too sweet. Oh, well, I actually though that sugar was added but the waitress said that it's pure tomatoes. If so many people complain that it's so sweet, then why do you keep making it sweet? :) - You have to order rice separate and it's not cheap! Little rice portion that is not enough for the amount of butter chicken sauce cost $3.25 (so I suggest to order naan, as well) Overall I think that this restaurant is pricy but the food was okay. I would come back to try other dishes. And I wish their BC was not so sweet because it's my fav dish on the planet, but I won't order it here again."}
{"text":"Bad food at absurd prices delivered by sloppy staff.  I'm disappointed that this is the highest rated Indian restaurant in downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"I've come to realize that Little India is my favorite restaurant in Toronto. I chose it as the scene of my birthday dinner in October, and just had my farewell dinner there last weekend. The reason? I know I'll never be disappointed. Their service is remarkable and their food is amazing. I could eat an entire serving of chana masala myself, but never will because there's so many other delicious choices! The butter chicken's sauce is to die for and perfect for dipping your naan in. I don't even eat rice with Indian, because I think it's a filler and there's more tasty things to fit in your stomach.   It's always a good idea to make a reservation if you're going for dinner because the place is small, but they told me they're renovating to hold more people soon.   I love you, Little India."}
{"text":"Definitely the best Indian food in the city. I always get butter chicken, tandoori chicken, onion bhajia, and garlic naan. I can't handle spicy foods so it can get a little too spicy for me. They also make the best mango lassi (I try mango lassis at every Indian restaurant I go to for the first time, and nothing compares). I've introduced a few friends to Little India and every single one of them said they LOVED the food."}
{"text":"Some of my friends have had not stellar experiences here, but I've done the lunch buffet about five times and it's always been amazing. I crave it. I think the price went up a buck lately but still worth it."}
{"text":"First things first... All you can eat lunch buffet for less than 13$? Even at its worst I would be excited. The fact that it is amazing is what I really want everyone to know about! The food is full of flavor and there are so many options it would be hard to NOT find something you love! Plus delicious ice cream to end it all! Mmmmm! The service is limited, as it is serve yourself, but the small things like keeping your drink filled and clearing your plates quickly is great. As I only went at lunch I can speak to the dinner service but the free app with check in is a bonus!!  The space is a little cramped, so you may be closer to the people next to you than you like but once you start eating you forget about any of this. So go ahead and get \"curried\" away!"}
{"text":"I went here for a lunch buffet. The food is really bad for vegetarians. I would recommend staying away."}
{"text":"Little India is probably one of the first indian places that I have tried in downtown Toronto. It looks like a pretty large and worn down restaurant from the outside, but the interior is your cozy, traditional Indian style. Love it.   After trying dozens of indian restaurants in Toronto and GTA, and coming back for it couple times, I have to say the food here is average. The naan is nothing special, your typical Indian naan with options of original, butter, garlic, etc. The curries all came with decent amount of meat, but it wasn't exceptional. There are plenty Indian restaurants that load your curry bowls with sauce and meat. They are also not spiced enough for me to say OH WOW THIS IS GREAT INDIAN FOOD. If you're a noobie to Indian food and don't want to go hardcore mode on pure Indian style, Little India is nice."}
{"text":"This place serves pretty average, but OK, food. Nothing particularly memorable, but definitely nothing bad or offensive.   I do agree that the price is right, especially given the location."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet here is perfectly acceptable. 'OK' suits it. I hear that it's the best of the three on this block of Queen West, and it's super close to my apartment, so it seemed like a reasonable choice when I didn't feel like cooking the other day.   The veggie dishes were solid - especially liked the channa - but when I went the aloo gobi was kind of a grotesque, mushy looking dried-up mass in the steam tray. So I passed on that. Spinach pakoras also good, although I prefer onion bhajis, but that's just a matter of taste. I need the greens anyway, I'm sure. They also had weird chicken pakoras that were more like General Tao chicken than any meat pakora I've had before. But... OK.  The meats were rather weak though. Beef was chewy and occasionally gristly, and the chicken a bit ... 'assorted.' Certainly not a big problem if you like dark meat in your curries, though. Doesn't really bother me if the sauce is good enough.  But I want to moan a bit about butter chicken. The butter chicken on the buffet here is not even as good as the one at Gandhi, but OK in terms of what butter chicken normally looks like here in Toronto.   Yet I have unresolved issues with this, which I must vent. All the Indian places in town which I've tried seem to serve a butter chicken which is basically chicken bits in sickly sweet tomato sauce with a touch of spice. I'm used to having it made with tandoori chicken pieces in a thinner, more orange sauce, less sweet but more, well, buttery... I really miss this kind. (I couldn't tell if the one here was made with tandoori, but it may have been.)   Alas, there is such a thing as regional variation, and perhaps I just haven't found the places serving the good butter chicken. Perhaps people around here have grown to enjoy this tomato-ey version, just as I have my orangey, buttery one. But in any case, on this particular lunch buffet, the butter chicken went from being my single favourite item - the one where I would cover my plate with the sauce and mop it up with naan - to being a dish that I didn't feel like finishing.  edit: I just looked through a few of the pictures here and the one of the buffet looks amazing. It certainly didn't look like that when I was there... seeing that photo though makes me want to give this place another try!"}
{"text":"Little India made my spice-cautious girlfriend like Indian food, so that's a testament to this place itself.  Been here several times and always have an enjoyable meal, a quality experience, and incredibly fresh Naan that just goes so so well with our meals.  If you're going here with someone who is new to Indian food, perhaps give a shot at the Chicken tikka masala. It's not too spicy, kind of sweet, but very flavourful. I've had an assortment of the other dishes and they've always been fabulous. I've never been for the buffet but the dinner menu is great and well priced, easily feeding a couple for about $35 (this includes side purchases of Naan and rice)  Also, if you like Samosas then get them here! They are huge and a great appetizer to start. Fair warning, they will fill you up unless you split them between two.  The service is great. Very friendly, quick and great at answering questions. It's a small restaurant with a quaint atmosphere and a nice scent throughout. Get there early or an off-day or you may not get a seat. However, for where it is, you can easily find something else in the neighbourhood if it's too full.  Little India gets 5 stars for the food, the atmosphere, and the service. Hope I'm never disappointed by it."}
{"text":"As usual, brought there by a group of Indian co-workers. As usual, they were less than impressed and explained me that everything should have been way better (I know guys - that's ok! :-))  The place is rather small and usually packed - which is a testament to its popularity. Location obviously adds to that - right on a very busy street.  In my personal opinion the food was decent, even enjoyable. No nasty surprises, all as expected. Atmosphere and service were common for the rest of the Indian restaurants (sorry - buffets) I've been to. So overall I would say that for me 3/5 sounds reasonable, but I am not an expert by any means...  Would I return there? I did a couple of times and can certainly repeat the feat, no problem. :-)"}
{"text":"The restaurant is lovely, great staff, yummy Nan bread (garlic kulcha), but the butter chicken and the paneer (I think it was Shahi paneer) - oh man, it was horrible. Wayyyyyyyy too sweet! :("}
{"text":"Honestly i came to eat at India Palace but found out it was closed. So me and my assistant decided to eat here. we were scared at first cause the restaurant mascot is an elephant but we soon came over our fear and entered (2 weeks later). We finally entered the restaurant and were greeted by Sri Lankans ( Not Indians, probably shipped in the wrong people). The Sri Lankan man who claimed to be indian sat us both down. We wanted to order off the menu but he hassled us into getting the lunch buffet at 7 pm Eastern Aquatic Time. So i went for the butter chicken but after i had my first bite i could tell that they use Margarine but not actual butter. My assistant started crying and she soon ran out screaming \"this isn't india palace, you promised\". So we ran into the sunrise (7pm), and ended up eating at Ginger right across the street which was surprisingly good."}
{"text":"This by far is my favourite indian restaurant.  3 1/2 STARS for the restaurant: its clean, but very small. There are always line ups.  5 STARS for the food: the food is amazing. The butter chicken is by far the greatest EVER!!!  The prices are so reasonable. I would recommend going for lunch when they have the buffet. Its a pretty small buffet, but it has all the main dishes. The quality of the food is great!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  Best chicken Korma I have had in a long time:)  All three of us loved our dishes, the other two had Chicken Vindaloo and Butter chicken.  An excellent variety of flavours and everything seemed to be cooked fresh.  Great Naan:) we only ordered one order of Naan and rice to share between three of us. Service was great even though we arrived half an hour before closing. Parking is tough, but to be expected in the area.  Definitely will be back:)"}
{"text":"No complaints about the food at Little India apart from their butter chicken which is consistently atrocious. WTH is the cloyingly sweet, alarmingly orange sauce that they use for their butter chicken? Butter chicken should be creamy NOT sweet and yellowish NOT tangerine orange.  At its price point the food is decent, though I prefer their immediate neighbor. Little India's meal for two is a great bargain except for the terrible butter chicken. The portions are good, their service is good, but the interiors could use brighter lighting!"}
{"text":"Great little spot with some decent beers, authentic indian dishes and best of all... some Sri  Lankan dishes like kottu  roti and chinese rolls! The chai is pretty good too. It's our new go to Indian spot in the down town core."}
{"text":"Just had this tonight!  Great service, great food!  Really happy :)!  We had 2 butter chicken, mango lassi, naan, and onion bhaji (sorry about spelling).  Anyways it was GREAT.  About $41....What I would change is I would've gotten their special meal for 2. SOOO full we couldn't even move.   Anyways great great great!"}
{"text":"So we ordered online.  Nice layout, but no details about the specials or combos. onlar? geç...  Butter chicken times 2,  Delivery charges downtown core are at least 3 or 4 bucks.  40 dollars for 2 butter chickens, delivery charge, not including tip.  A bit pricey.  We waited about an hour after the online transaction confirmed. I had to call to make sure food was on its way.   Now. The butter chicken...  Was delicious, i loved it. Not worth the wait though."}
{"text":"Always enjoyed the food here. Service is up to the standards. All you can eat is also high in quality and variety. One of the better Indian restaurants to eat at around the Downtown area. Pricing is also very reasonable."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time for lunch when I was in school, but it had been over 5 years since I had been back. Last Saturday I had a huge Indian food craving and talked my bf into joining me here for a late lunch. I was apprehensive about dining so close to the end of their buffet, but was happy to see that there was plenty of fresh food available to choose from, though I was not keen on the price - on weekdays it's $16 per person and on weekends it's $17 (5 years ago I was paying $12 or so - though 5 year is a long time! I know).   Most of the food options were chicken focused, and there was one beef curry available. Unfortunately they did not have one of my favorite dishes available - Aloo Gobi Masala, but almost every item I tried was delicious.   In sum:   The food was abundant, fresh and tasty! And the naan was amazing!  The service was spot on and not overbearing The price was decent for what you got - fresh food that tasted good  The only reason I am only giving my experience 4/5 stars is because the cucumber tasted dry and rancid and the pickles did not taste fresh and clean like I remember them tasting in the past. The green chutney in particular was dry and disappointing which was heartbreaking as I am a huge fan.   All in all, I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I ate here when I was doing graduate work at UT about 15 years ago - they were good then, and good now as well.  My daughter and I were doing the grand tour of Toronto this past weekend (I live in the States, she lives in Taiwan, and we were reliving my mispent youth). We came here for an early dinner.  The clientel were mostly Indian, which I took as a good sign.  We ordered  Chicken Tikka Masala and Lamb Ghosht, with plain nan and onion kulcha .  Everything was delicious, the breads were fresh and were just the right al dente texture.  My masala tea was cooked with milk, as it should be, and not too sweet.  All in all, excellent.  By the time we left ( about half past six) the place was packed - obviously it has a well deserved reputaion."}
{"text":"Happened to stop by today for a buffet lunch and the food was very good for the most part.  The sauces for 1 or 2 of the curries wasn't the best and I didn't like they carrot pickle but everything else was tasty.  It was also very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"I try Indian food for the first time in Decades. It was delicious and love the ambience. The service was amazing and they are super attentive. Love all the dishes they brought to us."}
{"text":"A modest little buffet for Indian food lovers. As someone who struggles with spice and has little knowledge of Indian cuisine, this place had a nice variety of picks for different palettes.  Small location - would not recommend for groups over 4. Buffet area can be a little cramped... so wait your turn!   I could definitely be persuaded to go back."}
{"text":"Shared the meat combo for two. I enjoyed the flavour of the Tandoori Chicken and Lamb Tikka, although it could be improved if it was more moist. The vegetable curry was also good. The Butter Chicken is definitely the worst of the combo... as other reviewers have said, it is very sweet and bland. However, it was a decent meal, maybe a little boring in flavour overall. I loved the ambience and the server was polite. I don't know if I will come back to give this restaurant another shot, but definitely not for the butter chicken."}
{"text":"I've been in love with this buffet for years. In the last few years, they have expanded by taking over the space next door and it's even better now. More room, a second spread, less busy that way. Everything is highly delicious and the service is very friendly."}
{"text":"Though this place isn't located in the best area of Toronto it is definitely worth checking out.  Inside was nice and romantic looking but slightly small.  Food was delicious but the chicken Vinadloo was very spicy but delicious.  Pricing was very fair also, for two meals is around 35 dollars.  Overall very nice place"}
{"text":"Yes, sometimes you're going to wait to get in here---but it's totally worth it. Attentive waitstaff, although the gentleman waiting on me and my husband yesterday had a puss on, and amazing fish curry. Seriously, I dream about it (I ate my leftovers for breakfast)."}
{"text":"Biraz geç geldik. Saat 21:30 da kapan?yor.  Buna ra?men bize servisi aksatmadan karn?m?z? doyurduk.  Çok be?endik"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my hotel staff, and I came to this Indian place. It is my first time to have a dinner in an Indian eatery. The food is a bit spicy and rich,  just as Chinese food. I ordered some fish, however they brought shrimp. The dish was good, so I did not bother to change. The light was dim though."}
{"text":"If you order the vindaloo, be aware that it will be incredibly spicy. They warned me, yet I wasn't prepared for how incredibly spicy it was. I could tell the food was delicious, but frankly I couldn't taste it with my burned taste buds.  No joke."}
{"text":"FOOD:  PRO: First time I came here I thought the food was great, all were tasty and bursting with flavor.   CON: Food taste is inconsistent. The next time I tried it again, their Butter Chicken became too sweet, not spicy at all. The other dishes tastes okay only the second time I ate here. How disappointing. Butter chicken shouldn't be that sweet, it became like a desert coz of the sweetness.  PRICE:  CON: Inexpensive but you won't get the value of the money you paid.  AMBIANCE :  PRO: They play Indian music and the design is good (as if you're dining in India). CON: Tables are too small, and the gap between the other customers' table from your table are very less. When you try to stand up and get more food, you have to move slowly so as not to bump into their tables while they're eating."}
{"text":"Ordered here from Ubereats. Disappointed at the butter chicken with it being too sweet. The tika masala chicken was okay but both platters barely had any chicken pieces. Mostly sauce. The rice wasn't the best either. The bread that comes with the butter chicken was overly toasted that it became like a dorito chip. It wasn't edible anymore. I don't think I'll being ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Think I had the worst butter chicken ever.  It was just sweet. I've never had butter chicken that was sweet. The place had bad ventilation and smelled really strongly of everything. I will not go back. There's another Indian restaurant that's much better down the street."}
{"text":"Shared a meat platter for 2 here with Eric L.  The portion size was absolutely freaking ridiculous. It could have easily fed 3-4 girls and only cost $32.   It came with two large pieces of tandoori chicken, some kind of grilled meat sausage, a tandoori lamb piece, a couple tandoori shrimps, an order of butter chicken, one vegetable curry dish, a LOT of naan bread and basmati rice.   I was super impressed at the quantity. The quality was just average - the butter chicken was really nice and a couple of the grilled meats were okay, but some others did not really impress.   Service was OK. Nothing particularly great about the decor either."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that the name of this restaurant can be a little deceiving, because when my friend suggested we go to \"Little India\" for lunch I thought we were going to an Indian neighborhood, like Little Italy or China Town.    The value is incredible!  $12.99 for an all you can eat buffet is a great deal - I definitely got my money's worth.  They have a nice selection which they replenish frequently.  My favorite part was the butter chicken, but who doesn't like butter chicken?  The only disappointment for me was they didn't have any Saag Paneer, another great Indian dish."}
{"text":"The lunch buffet is a great deal for the price. I LOVE butter chicken, and for ~$15, I can eat as much as I want!   I've also ordered food off their menu and it's all been good. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome service and amazing food at really good prices... some of the best indian cuisine ive had in a while."}
{"text":"Best Indian food in Toronto AT LEAST. Their butter chicken is bar none the best I have ever had, as well as their pakora and tamarind sauce (I could legit drink it). Service is impeccable and they are super friendly. Food and service are always consistent."}
{"text":"Service is excellent, but food is underwhelming.  We came here for dinner and got the Saag Chicken and Chicken Korma. The Saag chicken was too salty, while the Chicken Korma was too sweet.   Not much else to say about this place. It's pretty busy and popular, but i've had better Indian food. It's not bad, but it's not great. I like it when indian food explodes in my mouth, and it didnt."}
{"text":"Ran in here last week and had a quick dinner. Ordered up the Meat Combo (impressed with the Tandoori and the butter chicken; like the kebab and prawn). Also had a half order of the Tikka Masala for good measure that I thought was meh.  I don't know how this isn't a 4 star spot in anyone's book. The food quality varies from solid to excellent while the prices are relatively low given that the portions are generous.  Perfect atmosphere for a low-key Indian restaurant and great service."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a friend to celebrate my birthday. I enjoyed the overall vibe of the restaurant and the aunethic atmosphere. I also enjoyed how the servers were always coming around filling up water glasses especially mine because I drink a lot of water.   It was a lunch buffet when I went and the food was good. I wish the food was a bit hotter and fresh. The food I got was just warm. Overall it's a nice quaint spot and pretty cheap as well."}
{"text":"Had a horrible time at this restaurant.  If you are looking for authentic Indian good please do not spend your money here. Every dish we tried was really bland and had no spices. For some reason every thing we had from the butter chicken and malai kofta tasted sweet."}
{"text":"Mmmm....Little India is good. We ended up here after debating which of the three restaurants to go to. I'd been to Trimurti before, but was interested in the middle one. That one was empty, and being in empty restaurants weirds me out for some reason, so we went to look in Trimurti's window. Then one of the wait staff came out and was trying to get us to go inside. Kinda sad. Sooo Little India won our choice by being the least desperate.  But the lack of desperation here wasn't the only good part. Service was so so speedy! The staff were really nice and efficient, which I can determine since my water glass never went empty. Our food came out pretty fast, it was delicious, and cheap. I got a vegetable Thali platter, which had chana masala, saag paneer, something with eggplants, and another dish with mixed vegetables, along with rice and a different type of naan for $12. My boyfriend got the masala chicken, which was SO spicy I almost died. But also delicious so I kept having more and then crying about how hot it was.  After my experience at Little India, I'm coming to the realization that all of the Indian restaurants in this strip are good. But if you're still unsure, you'll be guaranteed a good experience and great food at Little India."}
{"text":"Place is not that great. Price is attractive but food is not up to par. Definitely not on the same level with the other Indian restaurants in downtown Toronto. Butter chicken and tandoori chicken tasted off. Service was ok. Dessert was not bad. Will not return."}
{"text":"The food quality is ok.The vegetable snacks and samosa are awesome but tandoori and meat is not good.The dine in service is extremely slow and for take away also they delay it even if you have placed the order hours before. The place is very dark and looks grim"}
{"text":"Typical but delicious Indian/Pakistani food. The buffet is the highlight, expect to wait at lunch time, though they have a lot of tables. Ordering from the menu gets you a LOT of food of much higher quality than the buffet.  Dal (lentils) was the black kind (urad dal) in a creamy, rich curry with kidney beans and spices. THE DAL IS YUMMY.  Basmati rice here is also yummy due to the oil. Quite clean though. Very good companion for the dal.  Naan was a rubbery mess. Avoid.  Papadum had the consistency of styrofoam but the flavor was good.  Overall: Delicious! Will be back and will continue ordering from the menu."}
{"text":"Food 3/5 - this is a Buffet. It is POP food NOT authentic Indian. Very average.  Service 4/5 - friendly, normal service. Nothing personal or engaging.   Price 4/5 - $24 regular buffet price  -=WARNING=- Plastic clip from bread package found inside cooked samosa!   Will NOT be back!"}
{"text":"Tandoori chicken very fresh but breast was bit dry. Sauces were tasty such as saag chicken. Meat platter nice combo esp sausage. Busy place but service is quick."}
{"text":"Much like Ambiance of India, Little India has a great lunch buffet. Slightly pricier, but just as tasty. has a diverse selection of curries, meats, sauces, and even ice cream. definitely try it out if you're downtown and into Indian food."}
{"text":"Let me state for the \"record\" that I am a fan of Little India's buffet. Their full house at lunch and dinner is a testament to their delicious offerings. But I ordered take out the other night and just want to share this warning: don't get the daily special.  It serves me right for trusting a static JPEG on their website featuring \"Today's Special.\" That image has probably been there since someone's nephew built the site 5+ years ago. But feeling lazy about looking through a menu (yes, I am this lazy sometimes) I picked the easy option. On the plus side, a $16.95 dinner-for-one will EASILY feed two people. But it's not really that awesome-tasting. You get:  Pakoras and chutney - delicious Carrot pickle - not much to report Butter chicken - ZZZZZZ Chicken tikka - an absolute disgrace(!) Aloo gobi - pretty good Two papadums - tasted stale A single gulab jamun - this was very good, actually Rice and naan - tasted like they were made yesterday  Perhaps my order was placed just they were culling old ingredients from the fridge, but I'm used to a higher level of quality from this place. I'll stick to the buffet from now on.  Obligatory Title Pun: Fell a LITTLE short.  Menu Readability: Total MS Paint job.  Need to mention: They take credit cards and debit.  What this place teaches me about myself: The dithering on the JPEG really should have clued me in. What am I, a n00b?"}
{"text":"My friend wanted to eat some Indian food and due to yelp we found this place.  The place looked really nice so I didn't know if I dressed appropriately I was let in.  I had shorts and a Tshirt on.  We opted for the buffet and oh my word.  It was amazing! There are a ton of choices anywhere from healthy salad to fried chicken cooked Indian style.  I would definitely suggest checking this place out as it is a hidden gem over all the other restaurants in the area.  For the buffet, tax and tip I paid $20 for myself. It was definitely worth the price.  He restaurant wasn't packed right at 11:30 but a little after the place was packed and it was hard to get around.  I suggest getting there early just in case."}
{"text":"This is my go to Indian restaurant. Convenient location, friendly service, cheap lunch buffet and delicious food!  If you are in the area for lunch, definitely try to swing by for their buffet lunch. For $15 you get a lot of variety and good quality food.   For dinner, it's a bit pricier. Each dish was $10 and was slightly small in portion. The spice tea is delicious though, would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This was a spur-of-the-moment stop for dinner & it turned out pretty well.  Vegetable pakoras, chana masala and vegetable korma - as well as some rice & naan.  It was definitely more than enough food.  The chana masala had a flavorful kick to it.  The vegetable korma was tasty but was more sauce than vegetables so I probably wouldn't re-order it.  Someone commented that they take debit but I was told that they didn't - only Visa, Mastercard, & cash.  Just an FYI in case people want to play it safe."}
{"text":"One of the best Indian buffets I have had.  We were in Toronto for a day, and based on Yelp reviews we decided to check this place out, and we are glad we did.  The place is a little crammed and it was busy when we got there during lunch hour.  But they quickly accommodated us.  The food was phenomenal.  Except for tandoori chicken all of their meats were very tender.  My favorite was chicken curry and chicken pakora.    If I ever visit Toronto again, I am definitely going back here."}
{"text":"Meh. I am really not sure what the hype is about.  The service was awful, so much so that I forewent dessert because we hadn't seen our waiter for about 30 minutes. The food was mediocre Indian fare at best.  Nothing bad, per se (though, the naan was very dry), but not worth the price and nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Ate here last night and loved it!   Ordered the evening special for one and received more food than I could finish. This is a great deal!  Paratha and onion bhaji to start, then a sizzling plate of chicken tikka, aloo gobi, butter chicken and delicious rice. All very tasty and all favourites... a great selection.   Too full to take advantage of the dessert offering and tea, so I'll have to return with an emptier stomach.  Service was attentive without being intrusive. Only downside are the stairs to get to the washrooms, but not much to do about that. Great spot!"}
{"text":"I've been trying to duplicate Little India's Chana Masala for close to five years now. No other chana masala comes close to it. I wish they'd disclose their recipe, if only so I could enjoy it more often.  The servers are incredibly friendly and accommodating, even during the busy lunch hour.  Of the three Indian buffet restaurants that are located on the strip of Queen between University and John Street (Little India, Trimurti and whatever the other one is called), Little India is definitely the best.  At lunch you can take away buffet for $10.10 including tax. They have an impressive selection of veg and meat items and their sweet naan is heavenly!  They don't have debit - cash or credit only."}
{"text":"Little India has been a staple to my Dinner dates. This place is romantic and cozy that I love bringing dates here. The decor is amazing and its like stepping into a whole new world when you first enter the kitchen.  Of course, it is busy and there is a mixture of different ethnic groups here that you will never have that uncomfortable feeling when it is only one culture group that eats at a restaurant and they all stare at you when you walk in.  I ordered my usual Mutton Rolls to share with my date, Beef Biriyani and a Chai Tea. There is a David's Tea in the area, but it does not compare to the Chai Tea here. For dessert, sometimes we try the desserts but its not something I like too much of.   Overall wonderful experience and staff!  Though side note, take out delivery is very slow. It took 1 hr and a half for food to arrive. The website warns 1 hour, but it definitely took longer. I would not recommend this take out place."}
{"text":"tl;dr Ordered online for butter chicken and 2 naan. Food was subpar. Had to wait almost 2 hours for my food to arrive.  --- After tax, I paid $18.02 for butter chicken and $9.60 for 2 naans. Portion of butter chicken was big for 1 person but not enough when shared between 2 person, which was displeasing considering that hefty price tag ($9 for a person can get you a nice meal elsewhere).  Overall, food was okay - butter chicken was quite sweet and naan were slightly bland. To make it worse, nothing warranted my 1 hour 50 mins wait even though I live less than 2km from the restaurant and I ordered during non-rush hour weekday."}
{"text":"we went today and ordered vegetarian platter , veggie biryani and veggie thali. So thali comes with 4 veggie specialties as per menu. So I asked is it me going decide what I can choose or it's prefixed , it took two servers and 15 to let me know how it works, first they told me it's not 4 specialities although it was written in menu , then they rudely asked me what I want and I asked what are my options. After all this I finally changed my order to malai kofta with butter naan.  Servers were arrogant , I could literally feel the food was thrown on my table.  And yes I also ordered Masala Chai which is spiced Tea. they gave it to me without even asking when I want it usually in other restaurants they ask how I prefer tea with food or after, but I did not mind it until I realized the tea was without sugar and they did not even provided me with sugar on side.  After all this experienced I asked for bill and requested if they could pack the food for me as I only ate a bit. So server came in and left us with containers for 5 minutes I was thinking should I pack it by myself or they will do it until server came in to pack it for us on the table and left the container opened while packing. We realized it when we came out and we were walking to know the our food is leaking. It was not my first visit there, I usually go there as it's steps away from my place, but after this horrible experience I would definitely find another place to eat. And that's the reason I felt like to share my experience to have them some changes \" hopefully\"."}
{"text":"The venue is a little crowded, but that is expected from a downtown location. The food, however, blew me away. Everything was amazing: the best falafel, the best butter chicken, the best paneer. It was all so flavourful. Combine that with the fact that is is an all you can eat buffet is just the best thing ever.  My coworkers and I plan on going at least twice a month, it is just that good.  Food -5 Service -3 Venue -3 Vibe -4"}
{"text":"This was a miss for me, which is too bad!  I'd been meaning to try this place for a long time because it looks nice from the outside and it always seems busier than the other two Indian restaurants nearby.  I came here for the buffet lunch at noon on a Saturday.  I was lucky to get seated right away because it got really busy after!  The food was...really disappointing.  The butter chicken, which is my favourite dish and always the one I'm most eager to try, was SUPER sweet!  It was like eating curry syrup!  The rice was good, the pappadum could've been crispier, the naan, though fresh, could've been thinner.  I tried a bit of everything else - shrimp curry, saag paneer, aloo gobi - and I think the other curries were quite bland.  I think they were probably toned down to suit local tastes.  The only dish I liked was the chicken curry but unfortunately for me, I was already full on the other stuff I liked less by the time I took a bite of that.  The chicken pakora was not bad, thought kinda dry.  The tandoori chicken was also dry but spiced nicely.  The salad was very fresh though, and the fruit was miraculously super sweet.  Every single kind.  It made me wonder if they were sweetened - but even if they were, they were delicious.  The service was good.  For that, and for the variety - it was a good selection even if I only liked one dish - I give this place two stars.  Part of me is considering coming back and ordering things a la carte to see if it would be better..."}
{"text":"Good spot, decent prices good food! Maybe a little too much perfume in the place though :)"}
{"text":"Good price but the food was very westernized. Definitively had much more authentic Indian food before."}
{"text":"Best Indian food. Our family travels from all over the GTA for all holiday get together a to come eat here.   It's authentic, delicious, and has kind, generous staff.  Some suggestions are: the butter chicken, onion appetizers, the meat platter, pakoras, lamb vindaloo and every other item on that menu.  Go!"}
