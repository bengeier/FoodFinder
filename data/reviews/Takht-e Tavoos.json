{"text":"There aren't many options when it comes to Persian brunch but this place offers one of the best breakfast/lunch dishes you can find anywhere in this city. 

Try Kalehpacheh if you feel adventurous. If you are Persian, you probably know what it is and you either love it or hate it. If it's the latter, then this is the place where you will fall in love with Kalehpacheh **100% GUARANTEED**"}
{"text":"Really enjoy the food here, nice clean and healthy food, all with interesting and impossible to pronounce names. And lovely pot of tea for the cold weather, really cozy place to have a bite to eat."}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely delicious, and a nice change from the usual Toronto brunch fare.

That said, the service is atrocious. We had to wait by the door for a long time before being acknowledged and seated (there were at least 3 open tables.) After being seated, we were ignored for a while more; we finally had to ask for menus. They also didn't bother bringing some of the food we ordered.

It's hard to enjoy the tasty food here when the service is so bad. I was surprised, because the service at Pomegranate is quite good."}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Toronto. The tea has the perfect taste and tastes just like the one my grandma makes back home. 

The breakfast is also FULL of flavour. Love everything on this menu. 
This chain is just amazing in general.

Try to go on weekdays so you can sit on the takht... But the weekend has more options on their menu. 

I don't even know how to phrase this review properly because thinking of this restaurant is making me so excited and hungry, I can't focus."}
{"text":"Waiting 45 minutes to get seated was well worth it! They have amazing quality of food which was prepared quite fast. Professional and friendly staff, and very beautiful Persian decor. The chandeliers, vases, calligraphy, colours, kettles and the whole environment will take you (back) to the East. Prices are worth it. One can go to the local Nora's or another breakfast restaurant and pay the same price OR go to Takht-e Tavoos and have the most delicious Eastern breakfast! 

Definitely visiting back! Thank you Takht-e Tavoos :)"}
{"text":"Ate brunch here and was very disappointed. Did not meet my expectations at all. Every dish was soaked in oil and the eggs I asked for to be cooked through came completely runny. The server never came by to ask how everything was and at the end when we finally tracked another server down for the bill and ours brought it over she did not ask why my meal was untouched. Seems obvious I was unsatisfied since my meal was untouched but she didn't seem to care at all. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Beautiful little cozy place with nice staff. every single dish on that menu that comes out of the kitchen looks goerges and delicious. Prices are very reasonable. I'm so glad to find Takht-e Tavoos  I wish I could order every thing at once, it's hard to choose sometimes lol Overall I continue to spend my Saturday or Sunday morning there!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch on Sunday around 1pm. Waited for an hour which is not surprising based on the size of the place. Line up did not ebb until about 3pm. Traditional Persian food was really good, very similar to Pomegranate: great dips - recommend the pomegranate/olive one. The more breakfast-type plates (anything with eggs) were decent but nothing to write home about. Service left a little something to be desired: the 2 girls serving were friendly at first but increasingly frustrated with the never-ending line up and questions / requests from guests. 

All in all, would recommend but would not stand in line again. Especially since we (party of 4) ended up dining on the bed-like installation in the middle of the restaurant. After an hour of standing in line, we took what we could get but it's a killer on your back and a pain to eat with your legs all over the place."}
{"text":"Terrible service and terribly cooked food. I've been here before and it was amazing. This time we had to wait over an hour for a table when we were promised 20 minute wait. We were basically forced to leave  and were promised a call and then they totally forgot about us and I had to come back and ask to remind them. By then we were starving and I pretty much begged the waitress for bread and some quick starters like the feta cheese plate. 40 minutes later and nothing had come to the table... Not even water!!! Apparently they ran out of kettles and glasses. Fast forward and the apps and water come but  with missing items and no bread. We had to finish the starters without bread. The when we asked for it we found out it was sitting at the bar for a while and nobody thought to put it on our table. Then the food arrived. Sunnyside eggs were over cooked with solid yolks and rubbery whites and over medium was undercooked with runny whites. I know, this sounds like it's impossible but they managed to do it. We had to send a plate back and it took forever to replace all with no apologies or anything. Then i went to pay and was telling my friend that we would split the bill later and the waitress got super offensive and asked that we go back to our table because she doesn't want us fist fighting over the bill in front of her. Overall one of my worst brunch experiences. This place has all the right pieces and a great menu but the staff is bringing it down. Cooks that can't cook the most basic (eggs) dish properly and waitresses that will have you wait 40 minutes and wait for you to complain before they get you water. If this was my place I'd fire them all."}
{"text":"Best brunch, nice traditional decoration and music. Halim was excellent, best Halim I ever had. Tea was very good. Parking was very easy to find right in front of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I probably eat out about four times a week. one of those times is always brunch. this brunch was the best one I ever had. EVER. forget your shitty overpriced diner food and your fake southern whatever and branch out, people. Tavoos is a magicall culinary adventure.

we started with light, refreshing chai and an amazing smoked eggplant dip that was so fresh and flavorful that I would have just eaten a bowl of that and died a happy woman.

my partner had the Serious Lunch. he is usually the most serious luncher I know but this dish almost had its way with him. sheep bits stewed for hours in a stone pot. first course: bread soaked in the drippings. second course: meat mashed with vegetables and eaten on bread with yogurt and spicy relish. it took him like 45 minutes to finish it and will probably take him two weeks to stop looking at me with longing in his eyes and mewling \"sheeeeeeep.\" 

I had some eggs on some tomatoes with some olives that blew my mind. these dishes all have nice names but my mind was blown so I can't remember them.

although they were getting slammed all the servers but especially the dude were awesome and took the time to explain everything and make suggestions.

cannot wait to come back again and again and try everything."}
{"text":"Best Iranian restaurant in Toronto so far! I had my best Kalepache last weekend and I still remember the good taste! Awesome place and very friendly staff. I give 5 stars to food, staff and place. Nice and clean.
I only wish they could have Sangak bread too. Thats all. Good job, thank you all."}
{"text":"Awesome cozy place , amazing tasty food and especially the Kalleh Pacheh ... You can't go wrong with it.
Staff are amazing and we always do some customization to the order by removing and adding items and they always try their best to do it."}
{"text":"Just finished lunch here. Holy cow that was amazing! I had the lunch special, and it was one of the most delicious meals I've had in a long time. Plus it was big enough that I don't think I'll have to eat dinner (and maybe even breakfast tomorrow). What a gem in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I love this place! so much! and Their other two places. I must say that the food and decor are fantastic! Sheherzade, Pomegranate and Tavoos are my favorite restaurants in Toronto. I definitely give 5 stars for the food and restaurant itself, but have to give it 3 stars due to customer service. Actually, it is only one girl who is always extremely rude and not professional whatsoever. She deserves -1 star. 
She worked this morning ( Oct 9, 2014 at 11am ), and i see her sometimes working at pomegranate, ALWAYS very bad service, almost like she dreads being there. not sure if she is family, but such a beautiful place should not keep staff who give it a bad name. 
She would only nod when we asked her about food options and specials, - it seemed like she didn't want to be bothered with extremely  very snobby attitude.
When i asked her for milk with my chai she replied ' seriously ' ? 
Seriously? 
After i confirmed, she rolled her eyes, and this behavior kept persisting towards us and others in the restaurant until we had left. She always has negative vibe. 
I've been going to all 3 restaurants for years and She hasn't changed a bit. 
I don't get how nobody notices that. It will do damage to their business, and i hope they replace her with people like others working for them. 
Everyone else seems lovely, - but every time she is there i have a negative experience with her . My friends as well. Every time we plan a visit we joke how we wish she wouldn't be working. But in reality - we are being serious. :)
The only reason i see why someone of such careless, pretensions, and impolite attitude would still have a job in customer service is that they are somehow related to the owners. 
Please value your customers and replace this girl with a nice, polite and caring staff member."}
{"text":"I joined some friends here for brunch for the first time today. 

I had the chai which was light and flavourful but not to be confused with the Indian version. 

I also had the paneer dish which came with eggs (scrambled or sunnyside up), paneer cheese some olives (it looked like meat on the plate but it was not and was delicious), crisp flat bread and a small sliver of smoked salmon. It was a very satisfying combination of flavours and I would definitely have it again on my next visit."}
{"text":"Very interesting breakfast option.
Enjoyed the combination of egg, dates, walnuts, herbs and yogurt.
Takes you away to another place."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and the food is delicious - full of surprises. I love this place!"}
{"text":"Love it, best breakfast ever! I have been there few time and i love all their dishes, Kalepacheh or dizi are the best, More like lunch though because they are a bit oily. Well priced also."}
{"text":"Simply delicious! First visit here. Shared the Dizi Sangi, which is a hot two-course lamb stew served with fresh flatbread. Perfect brunch for a cold day.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"What an amazing brunch experience. Friendly staff with a \"homey\" and unique ambience. The service was excellent with a very attentive waitress. The menu items are limited but the food is truly delicious. I tried the dizi sangi and my wife had the Bandari and both were lovely. I'm planning on going back and will definitely try to haleem next time."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for a weekend brunch in Toronto. Not only is the food delicious & authentic (says my Persian friend who I always go with), you also get to eat breakfast ON A DAMN CARPET. And what makes this place #1 is that there's hardly ever a line, especially if you go around 10-11. 

My go-to here is the haleem, porridge with falling-apart lamb shreds, cinnamon and sugar on top. I never would have realized meat & cinnamon sugar would go so well together...but they do! As far as all the other dishes go, I've yet to have a bad one come under my nose. The eggs with smoked salmon are notably delicious. My one complaint was that I found the dizi undersalted, but what do I know about dizi. What I do know is that Takht-e-Tavoos has a gorgeous space, great food, and nice service."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this place and it was wonderful. The food was tasty, delicious and pretty traditional. Service was fast and friendly. The Halim was absolutely superb. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a justifiably acclaimed restaurant, and makes a big contribution to Toronto's food scene.
I went there with a friend after a workshop at nearby FoodShare, and we were both delighted -- with everything from the knowledgeable and talkative server to the decor.
To me, these factors add a lot to the meal experience and help transport me to a different food world.
My big food politics issue these days is food waste and how we throw away so much food that is delicious just because it doesn't look or sound right. So my eyes lit up when I saw Kaleh Pacheh, a soup or stew built around the juice of hoof and brain. Talk about not wasting any part of the animal! I believe this is one of the hallmarks of genuine folk cuisine, shows something about a people who haven't always been able to eat \"high on the hog,\" as it were.
The dish wasn't only environmentally correct. It was delicious, especially with a spritz of fresh lemon and the addition of a few whole garlic cloves. Bring breath mints and enjoy!
The flat bread, also a welcome alternative to commercial yeast-based brads, went perfectly with the soup -- though I noticed next day on the scales that it didn't take any weight off me.
So this is a great way to learn about Persian food and culture, which, in my mind, is a big part of the mission of great restaurants -- to promote food literacy and social understanding by addressing the brain through the tastebuds. 
That is the argument I make in my e-book, Food for City Building, which is premised on the multifunctionality of food and its ability to fulfil many goals.
You'll even learn that the Persian word for tea is what led to the Indian name for chai tea -- all part of the fascinating history lesson we get at a good ethnocultural restaurant.
Padon the suggestion, but why not act on the educational mission of  restaurants by having a page inserted in the menu that says a few words about the tradition leading to the food we're about to enjoy?"}
{"text":"was there for brunch and loved it
all 3 of my friends meals were perfect and we loved the atmosphere and decor
very very good"}
{"text":"Be there at 10 on weekends, otherwise you will not get a chance to eat witout waiting too much. Halim and kale acheg was very good"}
{"text":"Takht-e Tavoos was my first foray into Persian cuisine. I've become a fan ever since! 

With that said, Tavoos' focus is on Persian breakfast including eggs, salads and stews. For those looking for Persian dinner fare, including rice and kabobs, I would suggest looking at their sister restaurants Sheherzade and Pomegranate. 

Tavoos is a cute little restaurant located at College and Dufferin in the Brockton Village area. The interior is nicely decorated with ceramic vases, paintings and ceramic tile giving the restaurant an intimate feel.

The Kashk-e Badenjaan is a must try. It's a sauteed eggplant dish mixed with mint, whey and caramelized onion. Think baba ganoush on steroids. It might be my favorite dip ever and Tavoos does it great. For $7.95, it's a good sized dish and a great appetizer. 

We also ordered the Maast o Khiar which is a yogurt dish consisting of cucumbers, walnuts, raisins, mint and rose petals. It's a cool, palate-cleansing dish that is refreshing on a hot day, You must be a fan of yogurt to enjoy the dish though, but it does go nicely with the Barbari bread. 

Finally for our main, we shared the Dizi Sangi which was a lamb stew cooked with chickpeas, white beans, potato, onion and tomatoes. This is the a truly unique dish consisting of two parts: strained broth and stew. The interesting part is that the dish comes with a mortar
and pestle used to puree the stew so that it can be served on the flatbread. It's actually a lot of work to eat the dish, but it's worthwhile, as the product is complex and flavorful. It's also kind of fun and makes the meal experience more memorable. 

Overall, Tavoos is an excellent Persian restaurant with some unique menu items I have never seen before. This speaks volumes about its authenticity. I also like how they focus on Persian breakfast foods in particular. I am definitely planning to return for another meal."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast with great staff. Unpretentious and all-around lovely experience. Within a minute of placing my coffee order, the waitress returned with one of the nicest drip coffee's I've had. The flavours of the Persian food was refreshing and delicious. Will certainly go back."}
{"text":"Ambience: 4/5  
Food: 4/5 
Service: 3.5/5 (Friendly)
Value: 4/5 
Repeat: Certainly will.

One of my favourite brunch spots."}
{"text":"Love Tavoos. Just great homestyle Persian food at very reasonable prices. Everything is good here but I always gravitate to the dizi, great filling meal. I know Maha's is Egyptian but they share Mediterranean flavours...Tavoos just has much more unique dishes, better value, and has way more comfortable seating (IMHO Maha is just not worth the 2 hr for eggs with a twist)."}
{"text":"I was there in saturday for a business meeting, and the food was amazing. I'm Persian and I'm a foodie I love cooking and eating :) 
I can tell you that I haven't had halim like this since I left Iran (Except at home). Great service and great food. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"If you like to try traditional Persian breakfast/lunch this is the place! Haleem is the best. We also tried sosis bandari, Shahrudi and Kaleh Joosh. Service was great. You need to come early for less line up."}
{"text":"If you want to get a sense of Persian food, you are at the right place; great food, nice decoration and excellent service!"}
{"text":"We came here last weekend with another couple for brunch on Sunday. I'd heard good things, but didn't realize quite how long the wait would be. The food was fabulous, but I'm taking a star because the wait time was grossly underestimated (they said 45 minutes, when we waited an hour and half) and once we were in they took more than 15 minutes to take our order and never brought us the tea we ordered.

The reason it still gets a 4 rather than a 3 given the points above is because the food is amazing. We had several dishes including the eggs with halloumi, the Persian susages and eggs, the lamb and potato thing that you mash up w/ broth and feta, olives, and a sauteed eggplant dish. I had the eggplant which was amazing - and a big enough postion size with the other snack-y bits we got I ended up taking some home. The homemade barbary bread is awesome too. The price point was very good as well.

I'd definitely go back, but try to go earlier (we went at noon) or just be prepared for a long wait."}
{"text":"where there is ruin...

Jimmy never tells me where we're going. It's always a surprise and as much as I don't like surprises, he's always opened my eyes to the culture in food. Far west on College, where I rarely venture, he showed me there is a treasure. Takht-e Tavoos, an Iranian gem is the sister restaurant to The Pomegranate and Sheherzade, both of which are further east, at College and Bathurst.

Restaurants in Dufferin Grove are rarely elaborate, not that Tavoos is. It's actually pretty simple, but you feel a lot of culture in the little things like murals, beautiful pottery and 'Persian' rugs.

Jimmy insisted we go picnic - so I took a seat on the 'Persian' rug. It was  awkward in a dress, but I managed, and it was so comfy I could have taken a little nap post-brunch.

Tavoos is only brunch, and it's really good. 

Highlights:

The olives are delightful - coated in a walnut and pomegranate paste. 
The bread is really good - crispy and chewy.
The feta is divine - creamy, oh so creamy and less salty than most - my preferred feta.
Jimmy had a pair of sunny-side-up eggs on a bed of crispy fried potatoes, topped with creamy homemade feta,olives and bread:

Same as Jimmy's minus potatoes plus smoked salmon and plus sauteed haloumi.
Remember, I f*cken love haloumi. The only thing I didn't like on the plate were the greens. Mint and parsley. Blech. Mint in mojitos? Okay. Otherwise? Blech. I feel the same way about parsley. If it's chopped up like garnish and therefore too tedious to pick out, I'll eat it. Otherwise? Blech.

Greens aside, Tavoos is a bit of tradition to go with your morning eats. Even if you're not one for ceremony, you've got to like eggs and good eats?

Sidebar: Iranian tea. Beautiful glassware, warm, light and inviting."}
{"text":"We love this place! THE OLIVES!  Such a welcome to the neighbourhood with wonderful food great service and a perfect all day vibe."}
{"text":"The dizy or ab goosht was excellent!  Definitely one of my new favorite spots for a mid day meal!"}
{"text":"Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars, but in the end I had to trust my gut and go with 3.

The good:
We had No wait time to be seated. 
The bad:
Once sat, we waited almost ten minutes for menus.

The good:
Food portions and prices were good.
The bad:
They accidentally gave me mackerel (usually an extra $3.50), and instead of just leaving it, they took my plate away and removed the mackerel, even after asking me if I just wanted to keep it. 

The good:
The Persian chai tea was yummy and warm.
The bad:
No spoons to stir in the sugar. Tea tastes like rose tea, so the name is A bit misleading

The halloumi cheese was really salty. Eggs cooked very well. Service not friendly (towards us). 

I'd go back, but I'd NEVER wait, so maybe not worth the risk."}
{"text":"It's impossible to bring into words my appreciation to the owner of this place which I don't know who He/She is but I do know they own difference other restaurant like Shahrzad as well in Toronto! 

In both places I ordered several items and tried all of them. Every single item is amazing me! You can hardly see such an extensive quality among all foods in the menu in other places. 

It would be great if I get a chance to see the owner and chef and pass my blessings in person. Traveling here from warm Florida and dealing with this cold weather; definitely such warm and cozy place s like Takht Tavoos or Shahrzad are great things to have in Toronto. 

I wish you all the best with your business and your restaurants are always additional reason for me to visit Toronto again!"}
{"text":"I went there for my mom's BDay.  We loved it..  The only reason for 1 star deduction..  They seem not fully organized...  We ordered 4 dishes Dizi,  kaleh pacheh,  haliem, paneer boghrah yummy.  Coffee was Meh(persian don't traditionally drink coffee) , but tea was awesome hit the spot..  For desert we ordered sholeh zard,  Dammnnn that was good.. Will definitely come back...  Decore looks good"}
{"text":"Had brunch here with my good Persian friend, she had the egg breakfast and had the lamb's head soup.  Both were delicious.  With a full pot of tea, we had a great time--the decor is cool, the vibe is relaxed.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Wow! If I could give this place more than 5 stars, I would. This is a cute little restaurant with attentive, sweet and fabulous staff and astounding food. We walked in on a sunny Saturday morning and the restaurant was very busy. Yet, we were seated within minutes and the servers were super nice, patient and sweet.  

We ordered the Gulsavah and holy smokes. It was delicious. Two perfectly cooked sunny side up eggsin butter with loads of dates, apricots, nuts and other dried fruits. There was a side of creamy, warm feta and a lentil dish. The food was iconic, fresh and bursting with layers of flavour. My mouth waters thinking about it! 

We also got the Dizi Sangi which was had a lamb stew with beans in a cute clay pot that you could pound into a paste. There was also a soupy broth of lamb that you could dip your bread into. This was extraordinary. The lamb was cooked to perfection, the broth was thick, flavourful and so comforting. Amazing! We finished our meal with a firni which I said reminded me of home. Topped with berries, nuts and cardamoms, the firni was the perfect ending to an amazing meal. This place has stolen our hearts and is quiet possibly our new favourite brunch spot! :)"}
{"text":"If you like the Persian restaurant Pomegranate on College you will like this too! Open daily at 10am and I came here on a weekend morning and a weekday morning. A bit of line up on weekend and there's weekend breakfast special. Highly recommend the one with sausages. The regular breakfast menu has a dish that has paneer which is so good too. The bread here is fantastic too. Also you could dine on the traditional bed (limited seating though)!"}
{"text":"It's an amazing experience here. The food is prepared more like art than food, in terms of taste and presentation. The decor is beyond amazing, as is the staff and service. 

Wait times can be high, especially Sunday mornings. But that only shows how popular it is...

Try the Halim."}
{"text":"This place is the best Persiam restaurant in town. There is no place like this in Canada. The menue is so unique and special. The quality of food is unbelievable. This place every time makes me happy. Dizi, Haleem, Kale pache, their brunch menu,  Nargesi, Bandari are amazing. I am Persian and  this place is highly ranked for it's interior, food and culture."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness..... this place is amazing. I can't believe after all these years of living in Toronto this is the first time I've been!
The food is incredible and exciting. Those olives are to die for, I even brought more to bring home! Will definitely be coming back !"}
{"text":"Great food! They have limited space so it took a while to get a seat. But once we sat down the service was quick. Totally going back again!"}
{"text":"Somehow I wound up inside this little Persian nook on a drizzly November day and entrusted the fate of my stomach to the kitchen and recommendation of the hostess. I am now in fact entrusting the hostess with all my future life decisions. 

The restaurant interior is nothing fancy, but pleasant and inviting. As you sit down with the menu and after placing an order, you'll have time to admire the unique Iranian relics and tiling, and if you're lucky, you might even be comfortably nested amongst the pillows in the traditional dining area. Be charmed by soothing Persian tones over the speakers. Arriving close to opening time on a weekday is a good bet if you don't like to wait, as there were only three parties (including myself) enjoying our meals.

It being a cold, rainy, early winter morning in Toronto, the hostess recommended the Haleem (my other choice, Guisaveh, was also vouched for but ultimately vetoed). I got mine with a small side of Yogurt (topped with rose petals and cardamom). Anyone who is a fan of conjee, gruel, porridge, and the like should prepare to have their taste buds collectively explode. The top layer of Haleem is a sweet, buttery, cinnamon-spiced membrane, but just beneath is a savory concoction of oh-so-tender lamb and barley. I noted some salt and pepper as well as a large bowl of sugar on each table, so it seems like spice-layering is common practice. It was several bites in when I remembered that I also had two pieces of Barbari bread, which are good by themselves or dipped quickly into the Haleem. The bowl was big - I don't think I could have finished such a hearty meal without the tartness of the yogurt to cut the rich Haleem. 

I practically skipped across the street to the TTC stop after paying - no excuses if you don't have a car. No complaints from me or my stomach, and I certainly left feeling like no amount of gloomy weather could stop me from enjoying the rest of my day."}
{"text":"Great brunch and also crazy busy on Sundays!!
Stuff is great and helpful. Love it!!
Went there few times and prefer going a bit earlier before gets crazy."}
{"text":"Love this place! Been here a few times and the food and service are consistently good. Great value and nice change from the usual brunch.  I highly recommend the tumeric potatoes. Only thing I would change about this place is that's it always really busy and the waits can take some time.  However, it is really quick once seated!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and both times absolutely loved my meal. It's not an extensive menu but that's when you know it's going to be good. The breakfast comes with a Persian Chai tea or coffee if you prefer. The portion is just right in my opinion and you definitely leave feeling satisfied and happy. If you ever have to wait, trust me, it's worth it."}
{"text":"You have not hit the Toronto food scene if you haven't been to Takht-e Tavoos.  I diamond of a find I suspect it never disappoints.  We enjoyed brunch.  This is a *do not miss* experience. We enjoyed the Guisavah, Paneer Boroshteh, Haleem, Kash-e Badenjaan and Sabzi Khordan.  I wish we were here for lunch we would have attached the Kalleh Pacheh .... - standing ovation for this amazing culinary art"}
{"text":"We love to eat food from around the world, and have tried so many things we had started to itch for something new - we wanted new flavours, new textures.  Tavoos did not disappoint. In fact we enjoyed our lunch there so much, we returned the next day to try their breakfasts.

ATMOSPHERE:
Tavoos is what you would expect of a breakfast/lunch spot. Nothing fancy, but well laid out with simple wooden tables for most patrons and lots of sunlight pouring through the south facing windows. A unique feature is two areas set aside for those who wish to sit on a Persian rug-covered floor with cushions scattered about. We sat at a regular table on our first visit, but took advantage of this cozy arrangement the next time we visited. Finally, the staff are very friendly, taking time to explain - when asked - the complexities of the many unique dishes on offer. They tend not to have a lot of waiters on staff, so service may slow down if there's a rush of people coming in.

FOOD
Not surprisingly, the menu focuses on both breakfast dishes (mostly involving delicious sunny side up eggs as a theme) as well as unique lunch offerings. On our first visit we arrived in the early afternoon so chose dishes from the lunch portion of the menu.

Dizi Sangi -  a stew of lamb shank and rib with chick peas, white beans, potato, onion and spices. The broth is separated and served in a soup bowl, meant to be sipped or eaten by soaking bread in the broth. The remainder of the ingredients arrive in a tall clay container (the Dizi) accompanied by a metal mallet. You use the mallet to pound the meat and beans into a coarse purée at your table. We threw in lots of the tarragon that was served in the side, then spooned it onto bread and topped it with pickled vegetables and yoghurt. A miraculous combination of flavors! And SO filling!

Kalleh Pacheh - a Persian lamb head and hooves stew.  The hooves are rendered into the stew, providing a thickness to the soup that is almost creamy. Delicious tender cheek meat, and a whole tongue with a fascinating melt in your mouth texture. Served with pickled garlic and bread. Fresh lemon juice really brightens the dish up. Truly magnificent and utterly unique!

Guisavah - two sunnyside up eggs, sautéed in butter with chopped dates,  walnuts, and black nigella seeds (a flowering plant, the black seeds taste like toasted onion), served with creamy feta, and ardeh shireh (sweet tahini). Lots of parsley on the side. Our dinner the previous night was so good we had to come back for breakfast. We could not imagine dates and walnuts with eggs, but with the tahini, parsley and salty feta it made for a decadent and extraordinarily unique breakfast!

Hallumi Eggs - 2 sunnyside up eggs sautéed in butter, cooked over fresh halloumi cheese fried crisp with a lovely garlicky flavor (halloumi is a semi-hard, unripened brined cheese made from a mixture of goat's and sheep's milk). Olives marinated in pomegranate molasses and walnut paste and smoked salmon are served on the side, along with a bowl with stewed tomatoes and veggies. On the side is creamy feta cheese and lots of parsley! The way the flavours combined provided a complex and melodious dance of tastes. Truly something special and unique!"}
{"text":"My second time here for weekend lunch, to my surprise there was NO lineup when I came at 11:30 on a Saturday. Last time I had to wait for an hour.

I got the same thing as last time-- paneer boroshteh and the haleem. My opinion of it has changed slightly, but I guess like most places, the second time isn't as good as the first!

Paneer boroshteh tasted and looks the same as the last time, so good consistency. The only difference this time is that everything much saltier than I remember!

I raved about the haleem the first time I got it. Getting it the second time was a little letdown because I didn't taste much butter or spices in it. It tasted more like I was eating oats, texture is still like I remember though. The barbary bread is amazingly soft, crispy and fluffy-- so fresh."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to brunch in the area. Authentic and absolutely delicious. Wish they were open earlier and more often."}
{"text":"Love this brunch spot, been there multiple times. Wait can be as long as an hour but the food makes t worth it. Most recently I had Bandari, it was a weekend special. It has spicy halal sausages in a tomato garlic purée mixed with roasted potatoes with two sunny side up garnished with some feta cheese and marinated olives. I definitely recommend this brunch spot."}
{"text":"As you can judge from the other reviews the food and service are great at this place but I want to share a rather personal experience we had here. Takht-e Tavoos, Pomegranate, and Sheherzade are all managed by the same team and I was an avid customer of all while living in Toronto. I was back in Toronto for a visit and we went to takht-e tavoos on a Sunday morning. The food was great as always and we all enjoyed our time there. When we left the restaurant, someone in our party left behind an important medication that she had to take on a daily basis and only noticed that much later around 6pm. At this point takht-e tavoos was closed but we called the other restaurants and were able to get a hold of the owner. This man was nice enough to meet us outside the restaurant at 1am to give us back the medication even though he had people visiting him from overseas. We need more people like him in this world and I wish him all the best and success. I will be a customer for life and I'll visit his restaurants any chance I get."}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated restaurant (I'm a turquoise fan).  The food was delicious, can't order the wrong dish. Presentation/plating was elegant, and you can tell that attention to detail is a key value in their concept. 

That lamb stew dish is heavy, but delicious (can probably be shared by two people)."}
{"text":"I love this place so much! All of the ingredients taste so good! My favorite item is the halloumi egg dish, it's so good scrambled. The olives and lentils on the side are incredible as well. I also love getting a pot of chai. Try as much as possible! The sharing plates are awesome.  I try to go as close to 10am as possible to avoid a line and it usually works!"}
{"text":"I was in search of something different I have never tried for brunch, and I found this place! 
It was cold this morning, so both my bf and I ordered something hot served in bowls. I got one of their weekend specials called Eshkeneh aka Persian onion soup. It was def something different, packed with exotic spices and richness from oil and cooked eggplant. A complimentary Persian flatbread as crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My bf ordered Kalleh Pacheh aka Persian lamb soup. Melt-in-your-mouth meat was the highlight of that soup. Both soups were filling. All of their items on the menu sounded intriguing and delicious. I would go back to try something different. Service was friendly as well. Soups were more expensive than their breakfast dishes with eggs, but it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Paneer Boroshteh - two sunnyside up eggs cooked over fresh halloumi cheese and garlic, sautéed in butter topped with nigella seeds, served with marinated olives, tomatoes, herbs and potatoes, from Port Anzali - as a huge fan of halloumi cheese, that description was enough to brave the Toronto snow and walk down 30 minutes, and wait another 25! 

This is a really cute Persian place, with nice traditional decor. I got to sit one one of their traditional carpets (as opposed to a table, see pic!). The hot Persian tea was welcome given the weather, but the paneer boroshteh - wow!! Probably the tastiest brunch I've had in recent times :)"}
{"text":"Persian food for brunch at Takhte-Tavoos...a brilliant idea. We went there as a big group and tried many different dishes from the menu. I had the kaleh-pacheh and it was perfect. The tongue was not lamb though, it was beef. Kaleh-pacheh is a persian delicacy but not everyone might like it. It is a stew with lamb organs. They do have other non-exotic and vegetarian dishes as well and they are all very good. Similar to the other locations by the owners (Anar and Shahrzad), the decoration and atmosphere is very nice and cozy and the staff is very friendly. If you have never had Persian food before, you won't be disappointed. Would definitely go there again.

Food: 4.5/5
Atmosphere and service: 4.5/5
Price: 4/5
Overall: 4.5/5"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a break from traditional breakfast, this is your place.

I like their decor and all the traditional art, but the seating is kinda cramped, if you are lukcy you may get to sit on the takht and have an even more traditional experience.

Now the food here is creative to say the least, some people might even find it weird.
I love eggs and i love dates, so i had the eggs date breakfast, and I was left wondering why has nobody thought of this before? SOOO GOOOD! it goes perfectly together, and there some cheese on the side to balance the overpowering sweetness of dates (I drool as i write).

My friend got a dizi, there is a certain way to eat it and the server walks you through it. It is interesting to it, tasty, but extremely heavy!! The guy beside our table warned us that this is sleep inducing, and he wasn't wrong, ran for a coffee right after that.

Don't miss out on the tea they serve, very flavourful and authentic persian tea, could use some of that to get the food settled down.

Service: our server was nice, but there is only two of them and the place is very busy on weekends, need more servers.

Have a good persian morning."}
{"text":"This is absolutely a must go to place for anyone looking to experience super authentic Persian food. Be prepared to wait but it's so worth it."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfasts. The line ups are pretty long but honestly , it worth it. Try to go in before 11am. 
I can recommend a specific food. THEY ALLLLLL GOOD"}
{"text":"Omg. Omg. Omg. BEST BRUNCH EVARRRR. 

Ok so now that I got that off my chest, time for the deets. Husband I went for brunch/lunch on a Saturday around 1pm. We had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a table. The place was PACKED. The decor was beautiful - chandeliers, Persian poetry lining the wall, and lots of blue, turquoise and topaz all around. 

Service was a little slow, but there were only three girls serving (what it seemed like) 100 people, so they get a pass. They were super nice and had a smile throughout each one of our conversations. 

The food of choice for me was Dizi Sangi. It was incredibly delicious! It was perfect for a breezy fall day. The broth warms your soul. The flatbread is fluffy and a perfect compliment to the meat/potato/bean purée. The condiments are fantastic even with the bread on its own. 

My husband had the egg + tomato braised sausage and absolutely loved it as well. 

We got a pot of Persian tea - SO WORTH IT! 

Cannot wait to go again! And I'm bringing all my favorite people in the world because it's just that awesome."}
{"text":"Loved the decoration! Beautiful Persian rugs and teapots. It seems to be there are very few Persian restaurants near downtown Toronto so you can expect a line up for weekend brunch. We waited about an hour but the food was plentiful and full of flavour. We had their weekend special Eshkeneh and Dizi. The Eshkeneh is an egg drop mint soup, which was served with picked garlic, olives and Persian sticky rice. The picked garlic and olives had amazing flavour. The dizi sangi is a mutton stew with chickpeas, similar to Indian goat curry. It was served with flatbread, torch (pickled vegetables) and yogurt.  If you go definitely get the chai ($4 for the pot, $1.50 per cup)!"}
{"text":"Search this place out.  It's not that hard to find but its more than worth it. 

We went for brunch on a Saturday and arrived about 10:30am.  By the time we had eaten the line up was outside the door. So I'd recommend going earlier if you are going on a weekend. 

I had eggs over spicy lamb sausage with halumi and Barbary bread. The flavours were fresh and crisp.

My daughter had eggs over halumi.  

Both dishes looked brilliant and tasted fresh. 

After our brunch we headed to the Aga Khan museum so I felt that my brunch was the perfect starter."}
{"text":"Amazing Persian brunch place.

Budget lots of time to get seated because this place gets busy.

The Dizi Sangi is my favourite and it is a very generous portion which can be shared. 

We always finish off our meal with the korma-ardeh. I highly recommend this with tea - its dates filled with a sesame paste and some ginger!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch spots while I was in Toronto. Prepare for a wait on the weekend but it's worth it, all of the dishes I tried were delicious, the wait staff were quick but thorough based on how packed it can get, I also came with my partner who is lactose intolerant and we were able to order some dishes that were dairy free"}
{"text":"Today was my second time eating here, and each time, I was happy with almost everything, especially the food. 
There is a good variety of flavourful traditional Iranian dishes to choose from the menu, plus, they usually have day specials. Haleem is my fav dish served here, perfectly thick in texture and adequately rich in flavour. Their tea, Chaee, tastes and smells authentic as well.
My only hesitation to give this place a full star is the line up and the waiting time to get seated. Also, the arrangement of tables makes guests a bit uncomfortable as some of them are placed very close to each other. Other than that, everything, including the food, the service, the price, is great, and you won't regret giving this place a chance."}
{"text":"Nice place for a Persian style brunch. Tasty dishes and affordably priced."}
{"text":"This place is the real deal. Decor, service and food are all well above average. Owners are a couple with several other successful Persian restaurants. Each restaurant is a distinct menu and concept. I had the spinach and egg (nargesi).  I have been attempting to recreate this (and modify) ever since. Great sides too. We sat cross legged on a platform with rug and cushions. Very special!"}
{"text":"Very good Kalehpache and great ambiance, authentic persian restaurant :)"}
{"text":"If u haven't, u MUSTbeautiful humble & cozy decor, very welcoming., amazing food their famous for their Dizzy, but plenty other delicious entree to devour, I had paneer boroshteh, and took halim home. I heard there are 3 sister restaurant so we're already planning our trip back for pomegranate restaurant"}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is well priced and very authentic. I've been here twice for brunch and both meals were great experiences. 

The names of the dishes are hard to remember, but I would recommend the eggplant starter dish if you want an appetizer.

My girlfriend likes tomatoes so she is into their tomato dish. Their olives and cheeses are tasty and fresh.

I would recommend to anybody who can appreciate good Persian food."}
{"text":"If you want try something new, you should try the Persian Breakfast. They have one of the best cultural Persian breakfast. Sometimes they have a line. However, they are pretty fast. The food is fantastic. Wanna try Persian culture and Persian food, this is the place.Love the atmosphere. Really feel you have a breakfast in Iran :)"}
{"text":"The food is good, but tgey need to work on the service. The servers are slow and an annoying thing is that when you go there as a group, they can't do separate bills, they just bring the total amount to the table which as i mentioned is very enoing and irritating. But all in all its a nice place and the food is good and will recommend this place"}
{"text":"I remember trying to hit Takht-e Tavoos a while back on a Saturday morning but the place was absolutely jam-packed.

It wasn't until this morning that I had the opportunity to return, and though the place was busy, we were easily able to get a seat (next to a table with a fussy toddler, naturally).

I wasn't in the mood for something breakfasty, so I decided to go with the intriguing Dizi Sangi (\"a stew of lamb shank, lamb rib, chickpeas, white beans, potato, onion, tomato and spices cooked for over 4 hours\"). The dish also comes with a lamb-broth soup, a small bowl of yogurt, a small bowl of a spicy relish, and a couple pieces of fresh bread.

It's a lot of food, certainly. The presentation is also quite interesting. The stew comes in a stone pot and you're meant to mash it (with the included masher) until it becomes a paste and you can eat it with your bread.

I mashed it a little but mostly I ate it with a spoon. It's quite tasty and the dish is absolutely packed with soft, tender pieces of lamb. And while the flavors are extremely subtle, the unusual dish is quite enjoyable (and extremely filling)."}
{"text":"Takhte Tavoos is such an awesome find, I'm glad it's one of the new places that has popped on in  my neighbourhood! 
I went there with a friend who had walked by and noticed the pretty outside decor and the inside is just as beautiful. Not that that's the most important thing with a restaurant of course but it helps create atmosphere.
My pal was adventurous and tried the sheep head soup-which she said was delicious and which smelled tasty from across the table-whereas I got one the the egg dishes, which had walnuts and dates cooked in and was very tasty, and the feta on the side balanced the sweetness nicely.
I definitely recommend getting a chai tea with your dish. They have coffee too but you can get that anywhere and the chai is lovely.
Service seemed good to me--they were super nice (if a little harried seeming. It was super busy that day and as someone who used to serve I felt lots of empathy for them but it seemed like they were doing their best) and they explained things really well when we asked questions.
I've been to the Pomegranate before and love it and am happy that they have branched out even further and it makes me happy to read everyone's positive reviews here (except for the one. I get protective of family-run places that I like. Um, reservations for brunch? Don't they not even take reservations?)!"}
{"text":"Just had a delicious \"ladies who lunch\" brunch here. This was a very unique and worthwhile experience. We reclined on beautiful Persian rugs and pillows, and sipped our chai in style. All of the food was tasty. I had the tomato narguesi with scrambled eggs - mmmmmmmmm. I'm not usually an egg person, but this blew me away. The sesame bread and yogurt with cucumber and rose petals was also a delicious treat. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fat guy in a little suit!!! Da da da daa!! That was me and my boyfriend after leaving here from sunday brunch!!! It feels soo great to go to somewhete"}
{"text":"Went here on my second trip to Toronto, and it is my favorite place to eat in this city, hands down. 

Our party of 5 sat at a really unique seating area, where we sat on beautiful rugs with our food and teas in the center. The food is incredible -- we ordered a variety of dishes to share, and none of them disappointed. It was such a great atmosphere, and we had a wonderful time brunching here. Definitely get the chai tea, goes great with the food. The spinach narguesi and paneer boroshteh are very similar, and I would recommend the latter because the halloumi cheese is just so good! I got the smoked salmon, but I recommend just skipping it -- you get such a small portion. The beets in yogurt sauce was unexpectedly delicious, and the olives they serve with every dish were mind blowing!! I know it sounds strange, but they are an explosion of flavor. We also got an eggplant dish that was on the specials, which I would highly recommend if they have it again."}
{"text":"OMG where do I start!!  My first Persian experience!!!!  It was absolutely divine!!
Lot of the items were hard to pronounce and I made notes on my phone before I went so I knew what I needed to order.  The gentleman working there was calm, graceful, and so nice to even teach me how to pronounce them!

First off, for this much labor and love that goes into making this food, it should cost more.  If dizi sangi was served in NYC, it would probably go for at least $28.  

The kashk-e badenjaan ($7.95), sautéed and mashed eggplant w/ Persian whey, walnuts, caramelized onion was like eating silky panties drizzled with liquid gold.  The flatbread was so fresh and good I wanted to cry sesame seeds.  And it came warm inside a basket covered in Persian cloth napkin with tassels on them!!!!! Tassels!!!! Oh, c'mon!!!!!!! Ahhhhhhhh  (For those of you that never ate at Byblos on Duncan St, their $11 organic house lebneh also comes with barbari bread which is to DIEEEE for, just sayin)

My friend ordered the kalleh pacheh ($15.95), soup made with sheep's head and hooves with flatbread.  Because, c'mon folks.  Where and when are you ever gonna have chance to try sheep's face and feet????  He ate that soup up like his life depended on it.  

Of course, I had to order the dizi sangi ($14.50) and omg, it's a HUGE portion!  And it comes with pickled puréed vegetables, yogurt, and more flatbread.  I'm glad I didn't order the yogurt app because I got to taste some with this dish and it was heavenly. Thick, luscious, and tangy, you'll be saying Greek what??  Chobani, Oikos who??  The stewed lamb, chickpeas, and potato is strained (broth served separately) and it comes in a beautiful mortar and you take the pestle and smoosh everything together to spread it onto the flatbread.  I thought the interactiveness of this dish alone was worth ordering.  After couple of times of pestling, I just ate the chunks of meat straight out of the mortar.  Just shoved everything into my mouth.  Mmm! Meaty goodness!!!!

The lovely Persian chai tea, I believe came with our meal.  The tea kettle was authentic, Persian, and hand painted.  Ugh, can this get any better!!!

They had 2 Persian rugged flat beds (no cushions unfortunately) that you can sit on instead of a table, the entire experience was amazing and so memorable.  And it only costed us $46 bones.

If you can get your butt over here, you must at once.  It's one of those flavors that'll stay with you for a life time."}
{"text":"3 star service and pricing.
5 star food and ambience
All the unique dishes are authentic and tasty"}
{"text":"Great breakfast! The dishes fundamentally aren't different from a typical breakfast (eggs, bread, potatoes) but the Persian-style tweaks create a completely unique meal. 

Food was great and we didn't have to wait very long for a table. I'll definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"I love myself a good brunch place but I was tired of the same ordeal for breakfast. This place definitely is not your standard eggs and bacon type place. Tavoos is a small Persian restaurant on college, past Dufferin. I went on Sunday morning right when it opened, and I am glad I did not sleep in. The place gets crowded very quickly. 

I got the Guisavah, which has two sunny side up eggs with dates and walnuts. The combination was superb. It is so simple yet so good! I love sweet and savoury. I found that the bread that was served was not warm. If you ask for more bread, they give a basket of warm bread and that made all the difference! It was a satisfying and filling brunch that was reasonably priced. The food included either persian chai tea or coffee. And there are refills!

If you love brunch, you gotta check out this place!"}
{"text":"The food is perfect but poor service and they don't do separate bills and give you a bill with details so every time I over charged for my food  because we have to split it evenly. This Sunday my food was 10.99$ and I ended up with 24$ because they can't separate the bill properly and every time it happens so this time I ordered separately to get the separate bill but they brought my food 30 min before others so when their food came I was almost done (poor service) but at the end they didn't give a separate bill. Disappointing for a restaurant with this food quality."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday morning and had the dizi. Tip: Rip up one piece of bread and just toss it all in the broth to soak, it tastes fantastic. I was dipping the bread and sipping the broth as soup before my Persian friend told me how to do it right. I also helped my friend finish his haleem since it was supposedly very filling. Everything that I had was great.

Service is friendly and the place is clean, can't really ask for more on that front.

I really wish there were more Persian restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"Great place for getting Persian brunch/ lunch. The ambiance is beautiful and the food is absolutely yummy. The waiting can sometimes be long which get annoying but it worths waiting for:)"}
{"text":"Another addition to the Pomegranate/Scherezade family, this is a great little addition in little portugal.

The food is great - more traditional Iranian dishes like Dizi, Kashk, and so on. The flavours are rich, garlicy, yoghurty and delicious. They do have some interesting lunch/brunch items that could be categorized as fusion.

The service is as warm and friendly as is at the other restaurants in the family. A unique draw is the floor seating tables x 2 in the restaurant. 


I highly recommend this place, especially as a brunch place on sunday."}
{"text":"Everything is super delicious. My only concern is that they don't have enough people. I have been there 3 times and every time scenario was the same. They have 2,3 servers for all people on a Saturday-Sunday brunch. How is  this ever possible? Everything gets super slow then, although all servers are super nice."}
{"text":"The food is great and I like to travel all the way to have a healthy brunch here. However, the waiting time is too long if you are not in by 10. The policy is to let people sit unlimited even after 40 mins of not ordering anything."}
{"text":"\"We drank tea on the meadow of the table, I opened the door: a piece of sky fell into my glass I drank the sky down with the water.\" With a statement as such on the wall, yes the ambiance is indeed as one fell in Persian heaven as they entered the restaurant!

And this feeling of drinking the sky down with water follows you to your table and onto your tastebuds. Although the wait for a table is lurking around 45 minutes it's worth every second to taste the dishes...

I went all authentic with this ahhhmazing dish Haleem, sweet melodies of wheat berries, minced lamb, cinnamon, in a hot bowl transcends you straight through Persia.... The Persian tea, and a dish called Bandari with halal sausages are hard to pass and we enjoyed them thoroughly...

With total including tip coming at under $35.00 this is indeed a destination spot with the taste to remember!!!"}
{"text":"What a welcome change of pace for brunch.  I was skeptical at first being offered the traditional (takhte) table where you sit on the ground with lots of pillows.   If you are offered this table then trust me and take it!   Nothing like lounging on nice pillows stretched out and eating away.  If it wasn't for the fact that I was wearing pants this is just as comfortable as eating on my couch!

Food is fantastic.  Im not used to the Kalepacheh served this way, buy it was very good and the egg dishes where fantastic - simple and fresh

Prices are very reasonable with tab for 3 coming up to less than $50"}
{"text":"This is a very cozy restaurant with cool Persian decorations. Food is great and tastes like authentic Iranian food. Staff are nice and prompt. Could not ask for better even in Iran"}
{"text":"Unexpectedly great meal!  Service was great and good was very different and super tasty. Will definitely come back for brunch or lunch again. I got the serious lunch and it was good enough for two people. Hidden gem."}
{"text":"The food quality here is amazing. Lots of flavour, you can tell it's been cooked with love! Fresh bread is amazing with their dips. It's a great brunch spot

I really enjoyed my experience here. The ambiance especially the floor seating and beautiful rugs create such a unique experience compared to other restaurants."}
{"text":"Really lovely brunch here, as everyone has mentioned.

Don't be fooled by the line up, as it generally moves quickly. The hostess told us 45 minutes but we only waited 10!

Worth the awkward location to have some unique brunch foods. I tried the tomato/onion dish with eggs, served with the Persian style bread and some marinated olives. Free coffee or tea to go with your meal. There is a heavier lamb stew dish which seemed popular with the men.

Reasonable prices too, my dish was $11 including the coffee, can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I would go as far as to say that if I knew I had only one meal left, I would head to this restaurant and order the eggs. Eggs, you are thinking, how can eggs be so good? But with spinach and fresh basil and soft, warm seeded bread, and feta, and roasted tomatoes, and marinated olives, and with fried onions on top, this is as close to heaven as it gets.  You can get your eggs sunny side up, or scrambled, I opted for the scramble, and your delectable breakfast feast will come with either Persian chai or coffee. Extra points for a space that is so serene it could double as a meditation center.  Seriously, this place is the best of the best."}
{"text":"Are you Paarrsssiaeen?! Wow. What a gem. Love the decor. Fun place to be. West college west west looks a lot further east when you're in the joint. Seemed authentic. Lots of cool flavours and textures to be tried. They have a fairly standard egg type dish that was very well done. Killer bread, but be careful not to fill up on it. The dessert was nutty good (and contained nuts, as does most of the food, so nut allergies beware!)"}
{"text":"If you are looking to have a traditional Persian / Iranian dish, you'd better head to Takht-e-Tavoos. This restaurant is open only till 3 pm, so you'd better hurry up. There is usually a line up if you get there around 10AM. I do recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a brunch place and you are OK to eat meat. You won't find good vegetarian option there.

The price was not bad either. In general, it was a nice food, nice interior design, the service could be better and the location is so far away from down town core. It is worth going when there is no line up.

{"text":"I live in U.S. and visited Toronto last weekend and this will be my 2nd time in the past year visiting Toronto and Takht Tavoos and loved it each time more than the last. Here are few tips: 1- It's open only for brunch from 10am-4pm 2- The place is super small (sitting for no more than 20-25) so it's almost guaranteed that you have to wait, so pop-in put your name on the list go walk around and come back 3- Unless you really want egg dishes and craving it (and their egg based dishes are to die for) I would try the other items on the menu 4- Here are few items I definitely recommend you to try in this order: Dizi, Haleem, and Kaleh Pache (for you non-Persians that's the stew that includes beef tongue, brain, and other body parts) and their special of the week is always good. You almost cannot go wrong with any dish here, I just wished we had them here in the U.S. and don't forget to have some hot Persian tea!"}
{"text":"Yes, it's that good.

Top-10 in 2013 by Globe & Mail critic Christopher Nuttall-Smith....the legacy lasts."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a breakfast-like lunch. 

The servers are friendly and attentive and the portions are filling,  without being excessive. 

The price point is appropriate and the flavour profile of their \"sweet breakfast\" is very unique and complex while being highly addictive and tasty. 

Very nice atmosphere as well, with traditional seating arrangements available along with nice Irani decor."}
{"text":"I haven't stopped thinking about my meal here. Fried eggs with dates and walnuts was so AMAZING! I tried my friends curry, and it was also AMAZING!

Such nice decor, perfect atmosphere, spot on prices, and (you guessed it) AMAZING FOOD!!!"}
{"text":"One of the most difficult things to deal with as a Persian gal living in Downtown Toronto rather than Richmondhill, is to find decent Persian food. Especially Persian brunch food. I was super excited to try Takh-e Tavoos for their lambs head soup which is a delicacy back home and it's pretty darn hard to find here in Toronto and they have it. Not only do they have it, but they make it damn well. Now I know it doesn't sound as delicious to non adventurers button those of you looking for something new and spectacular to try, well this is it! The soup comes with two lamb tongues and meat from lamb hooves and it is to die for. We also tried the Kashk bademjan and Naz khatoon as appetizers which are both roasted eggplant dishes which were both super delicious. The fact that I can walk here is possibly dangerous for my relationship with the scale but oh so worth it. If you're looking for a dinner spot offering fabulous Persian food you should try the two sister restaurants to Takht-e Tavoos, Sheherzade and Pomegranate both amazing."}
{"text":"Chill atmosphere and beautiful Persian decor.

The Haleem is amazing! The quality and authenticity match the ones in Iran."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing!  Best Persian breakfast experience!  Nice ambiance, friendly staff and more importantly reasonably priced.  Looking forward to go back!"}
{"text":"Lovely restaurant, great food! The dates dessert is a must try."}
{"text":"Came by Takht-e Tavoos on a Saturday around noon with a party of 4. Although the restaurant was busy, we did not have to wait for a table. Once seated, the waitress provided us with menus and water. Once we had all made up our minds about our orders, food shortly arrived after that.

I ordered a weekend special (I don't quite remember what it's called) with eggplant in a tomato paste, 2 fried eggs, and rice. The others ordered what I believe is called the bandari and we all shared a chai tea. Don't be fooled by the pictures you see online, the portions were  big and filling! I had trouble finishing my dish even though everything was delicious.

Overall, great casual atmosphere to catch up with friends over brunch with friendly and attentive service."}
{"text":"We went to this place twice in 2 days. That's how good it was. Traditional Persian breakfast with a little bit western twist. Highly recommend it. We almost ordered everything on the menu."}
