{"text":"Initially wanted to try this place because it looked clean and modern.
Pricing: Cheap for poutines at 5.99 each.

Service: Overheard them saying that the fries take too long to make.... ? It took 10-15 minutes to make though they apologized for the wait. Other than that, the servers were courtious.
The order: Ordered the original poutine and chili poutine.
The taste: Fries were dry and overcooked. The flavour was off and the poutine tasted nothing like actual gravy but more like rosemary and starch mixture. Tasted like turkey stuffing. Extremely underwhelming.

The verdict: Would not go back."}
{"text":"Pure garbage!!

Why waste words when I can just say it's not worth it. 
My wife actually said \"we are never going there again\" and I tend to agree.

Sorry guys, should have worked out the kinks before you opened and not after."}
{"text":"Second time visit this time 5 of us. I wasn't hungry that just ordered sweet potato fries and salad. Despite the others' feeling about their burger as I have no right to express their feeling. While just about my Sweet potato fries and salad. They are terrible...
The sweet potato fries wasn't cheap at all but the serving may be approximately 10-15oz? So little that I almost wanna cry...
And the salad...it was a joke...maybe that was my fault that ordered salad at a burger place. My sister in-law and me both ordered salad which I had a goat cheese and she had a Caesar salad but they look 95% the same!  A plastic bowl filled with small portion of head lettuce( which is the same green used on the burger). Topped with few bread cubes or little goat cheese. 
We end up didn't finish it as we felt like we were a goat that being fed with grass.
We felt like being mis-treated and being cheated. 
I know they tried hard to create a energetic and welcoming atmosphere in order to build a sharp impression for customers. However, food is the key. I felt zero passion on their food neither from me nor them. 
Goodbye."}
{"text":"My wife decided to try this place out and bring me home a \"Hole-e Smoke\" burger (spelling may be off as I never saw the menu). It was the pulled pork topped burger. I thoroughly enjoyed it! I will definitely be visiting in the near future!

I can't add anything on pricing as I wasn't there to choose the burger. I'm assuming it's on the higher end but worth it."}
{"text":"I used to love the food here when it first opened a few years ago and went often. Ownership has clearly changed. I won't be going back. The service isn't nearly as friendly. The amazing Chipotle turkey burger has disappeared.  The burgers I ordered today were chewy and overcooked with hard white things inside. No taste. The fries were dry and tasted like old oil. The worst by far was the gravy. I don't now what it was made of but it was orange and smelt terrible. I could not stomach eating any of it. I actually questioned whether or not it was actually gravy at first. Looked more like thousand island dressing mixed with tomato soup. Even my children didn't finish their meals. I used to recommend the burger place to people all the time. Highly disappointed that such a great place initially has taken such a dive downhill. Disappointing to lose good food options in our neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Ate here this past weekend, had seen signs and wanted to try it out.  My partner and I split the \"two-can-dine\" meal which includes two burgers, two fries, and two drinks for under $20.  I added cheese and pretty much every free topping - I enjoy a messy burger.
We both really enjoyed the burgers; well seasoned, really nice 'crust' from the flat top, the bun was soft without being squishy, and held up to my indulgently topped burger.
I'm looking forward to trying some of their signature burgers and the piri-piri chicken.
The only negative that I saw was that their fries were a bit under-salted for my tastes, but they were seasoned with a bit of pepper which was quite nice."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointed with the service at the cox well location! I felt rushed by the lady serving may 26 at 7:08 (according to my reciept) I ordered 2 can dine to go. Two upgrades to the smoke burger. A sweet potato fries and a poutine.  I got home looking forward to our meal after a crappy day. One burger was correct and the other wasn't even close. The other is two patties with hot peppers. A slice of tomato and a slice of onion. I didn't get the poutine either! So I had plain fries and I gave my dogs the patties from the burger I didn't order. I called and complained and was told to drive all the way back after I got home to relax. Needless to say I didn't go back. Very poor customer service!"}
{"text":"Yummy \"REAL\" burgers. I've had several skirt burgers (real cheddar cheese) and a few smoke burgers (add pulled pork, caramelized onions and BBQ sauce, - yum!). Would I drive across town for one? ..... maybe not, but this Hole E Burger located at Coxwell and O'Connor has added a wonderfully tasty option to local fast food dining options. Oh, love the Sweet Potato Fries too!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience. Used the online order feature on the website. Went smoothly. was told to pick up in 20-30min. arrived at restaurant and they had not prepared the order. Apparently the online order feature is new and they don't check for incoming orders. So I had to wait an additional 15min at least for my order to be completed. The food was mediocre. Nothing to write home about. Fries were grease-soaked and soggy. The paper bag and fry boxes were soaked through with grease, top and bottom. It looked like they scooped the fries out of the fryer with the box. Definitely will go back. Cashier/server was apologetic, but it really was her fault that the order wasn't received. And no attempt to compensate me for their glaring error. Definitely would not recommend."}
{"text":"Went to this place with my family for a quick bite one Friday night. The place is brand new and beautifully renovated, the menu is easy to read and clear. 
We all ordered separately because we all couldn't decide what we wanted at the same time. I ordered the bacon cheese burger (comes with fries) and the deep fried dill pickles. My bill was about $20 bucks, a little hefty for a burger combo but these days burgers joints are jacking up the prices so I waited it out to see how it tasted.
The fries were epic, nice and crispy, a good amount of salt, I was very impressed. The burger - which is what you pay for right??- was just ok. It was really nothing special I actually could probably make it myself at home. I don't know if it was worth $20. My dad got the pulled pork burger which he really enjoyed so perhaps I could have gotten something a little more fancy. I have no clue how my mom's was more expensive then mine, she got a chicken burger and poutine for my sister and it was $25, she agreed it was nothing special. Overall it wasn't a bad experience, the staff was very friendly and the place was spotless which I appreciated but the food in general was just meh. I might return again if I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Tried one evening cause we were close.. Looked like a nice clean place to eat. We love our burgers but seems they have a bit to go to master it. Seems we compare all them to five guys, cause all these other burger joins haven't measured up yet."}
{"text":"We wen't to this place last night for dinner. The service was wonderful and the atmosphere was great. We looked online at the menu before we went over to get an idea of what we would order. We ordered a Canadian Burger, a Meat & Potato burger, a poutine, mac & cheese and fried pickles. We spent about 50 dollars but wanted to try a bit of everything. First off the burgers were so disappointing. The Meat & potato burger was supposed to have  a crisp potato patty on it with gravy. Instead i got runny mashed potatoes mixed with gravy slopped on the burger. The Canadian burger should have had pea-meal bacon on it and from the description and photo online, several slices. When we received the burger it had one small slice and a glob of grainy mustard on it. This was quite sad since the actual meat of the burger and the bun are very tasty. The poutine we ordered was terrible. The fries were terribly burnt and the box was only half full. There was hardly any gravy on it. We threw most of it out in the trash. The mac & cheese was tasteless and was pretty much just warm cream poured over noodles. The fried pickles were very good. Over all, the meat of the burger and the bun were good, not great. WE won't return."}
{"text":"I have visited this establishment three times in hopes to give my local burger joint a chance... I will never return. I have ordered the veggie sandwich, goat cheese salad, poutine, and burgers. Each time my boyfriend and I have been horribly disappointed. The fries are drenched in salt. The poutine has next to no gravy or cheese, the burgers and incredibly greasy. Also, the veggies on the vegetarian sandwich were extremely over cooked and had no flavour. 

The owner was extremely friendly however, he is very, very unorganized. The grill and prep line is \"controlled\" ciaos. The kitchen and sitting area are very clean however, with the high prices and quality of food I will never go back."}
{"text":"Man.  What a shame.  This place is gone.  I mean. It sucked.   But I wonder if the guy checked these reviews....and if he did WHY wouldn't he reach out to reviewers like me who were willing to offer so much feedback....it's like they would rather watch their life savings go down the drain, but keep the ego intact.   Crazy.   And unfortunate.  The guy seemed like he was probably a nice guy."}
{"text":"Review Update,
Wanted some burger and fries action early April
 Headed to Hole E, place was empty (7pm on a Friday, doesn't bode well). Was ignored by the 'staff member' who walked from a back room, and into the kitchen twice, without acknowledging our presence. After standing for over 2 minutes in the empty store we left.  We will not return. 

Original review below: 


Middle E of the Road

Went for a second visit last week, was greeted loudly by the owner who declared they were the \"best burgers in Toronto, as voted by you\" I replied I hadn't voted for them. 

The pricing is a little on the steep side, and although I am not averse to paying close to $10 for a decent burger, I would say these burgers are close but not quiet worth it.


We got the special, 2 burger combos (basic burger, not a special burger, fries and a small fountain pop) for $18.  The burger seemed a little dry (similar to first visit), and they had mixed up our order (put the burgers on the wrong buns).  

The worst part about both visits was the owner sitting out front smoking a cigarette. Not something I would recommend to entice people. Owner did seem to have a lot of *sniff* energy when we  were there during a World Cup game."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed after how it was hyped up. 

First, the good things - The mac and cheese is the bomb dot com. Its amazing and I cannot rant more about it.

Mediocre things - I've had a poutine there and it ended up tasting quite soggy and there was practically no cheese.
Crappy choice of beer and it's expensive. I got what was on tap and it tasted watered down. The pop is also pretty expensive for fountain pop but that's what you pay in today's society.

Bad things - My best friend got terribly sick after eating a burger there, and it was the only thing she had ate all day. She thought one of her toppings had gone bad - not the actual burger.
Also, don't even try to eat in there if you're a big person. It's not big person friendly. The tables are close together with uncomfortable seats - or you have the fun task of trying to sit at a tall bar-esque chair.

I continue to go back - but solely for the mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Tried this place with their groupon and ordered the skirt burger with fries. The presentation was top notch, burger ensembled neatly with all toppings present.  The helping of fries were generous.  The burger patty itself was a bit dry, but I think that's due to the lack of fat content in their ground beef ratio and not the cook. The brioche bun was soft and tasty, the skirt cheese was crisp and chewy, perfect.  Lettuce, tomatoes, pickle, jalapeños were fresh. The fries were fresh cut and crispy
Although I paid $11 groupon price for combo I would go back again.  
Bottom line-The meat was a bit dry, but for everything else they got right, I'd order another"}
{"text":"Dam! I got agree with Colin. I dont see why this place has an average 3 star to me that's meh it's alright vibe but dam I found a great burger place.

I decided to test their signature burger Hole E Smokes and their poutine. For good reason, Being their signature it should be an actual tasting of their food. Now I'm not a poutine guy but I have had my fair share of it anyways. Usually it's a flaw I see so I had to see if that we good.


Lets start with poutine. I give them points for a good portion for a good price, the gravy and cheese wasn't lacking and on mark. The only thing I can knock it down for are the fries, not enough crispy crunch but all and all 4/5.

Now onto the burger. It was a pull pork burger top with coleslaw with it was saucey tender pork. Add meaty juicy patty and we got a winner.

So I give this place a great rating. Location isn't the most convenient but meh I Will travel for that. Still got more to try."}
{"text":"I was eager to try their Almighty Veggie sandwich...there was nothing almighty about this...very disappointed. It contained 1 small Portobello mushroom , 2 small zucchini rounds and a small amount of roasted pepper and onions...and oh goat cheese...I think (couldn't hardly taste it) . All this for 9.00, ?.. This sandwich wasn't even worth 5.00.  The only thing I will give this sandwich is the bun. This Almighty sandwich has potential to be pretty good if only they aren't cheap on the ingredients!  I certainly will not be returning to this place....not worth it."}
{"text":"Just came from there and was pleasantly surprised. I had the American Dream with fries, onion ring ketchup and a flavourful cheese (not sure which one it was).The patty was seasoned nicely and cooked well enough to not be pink in the middle, but not overcooked. Very flavourful! Bun was very soft. Fries were good enough. The first time I came here it wasn't that great but things have certainly changed. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I really like this place! I don't eat carbs, so the lettuce wrap is DELICIOUS and makes my burger feel much more burger like. Love the fountain pop, burger toppings, yum. Slightly pricey, but we really enjoy it."}
{"text":"The owner messaged me about my review which usually infuriates me. Owners have a way of making excuses and trying to tell me why I'm wrong. This guy was really apologetic and seemed genuine. He invited me in to give them a second chance so I said what the hell and headed over again.

When I got there I had a brief conversation with him about my previous experience and he told me that the place was new, a lot of their employees are new to the work force or trying to re-enter, etc. and said a lot of things like there was \"no excuse\" and \"you shouldn't have to suffer for that\". It was nice.

I ordered the Hole E Skirt burger and the macaroni and cheese again. The burger was amazing. I finally found out that the \"skirt\" is cheese burned on the flattop around the burger. My first skirt burger didn't have that which had me thinking a skirt burger is just a cheeseburger. The meat was cooked medium which I really hope isn't a mistake. It's hard to find any pink in a burger in Toronto. It was delightful. And the bun was an entirely different experience, soft but sturdy. Not like the cracker I was served on my first visit.

As for the mac and cheese, when it arrived I was concerned. I took a bite and it was obviously pasta with plain bechamel. I didn't complain at first as I thought maybe it's just a really, really bad dish and I didn't want to look like a jack ass. When the owner approached my table to see how everything was I did ask if the macaroni and cheese should have cheese in it. He looked at it and immediately ran it back to the kitchen. A couple minutes later he brought it back and it was perfect. Seriously, this is THE macaroni and cheese of LIFE! The best I have ever eaten. He said it was a new cook that night and he forgot to add the cheese... I'm a forgiving guy, whatever. Oh yeah, they also top the dish with bacon and little chunks of cheese that's been melted and burned like on the skirt burger. Mmmm..... I'll be back for this again so soon.

Most of my fears have been resolved. I think this place will probably be five stars by July. Great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I am not really a burger fan so this probably would not have been a place I would try alone. My SO loves burgers and diner fare so when I saw a Groupon for this place we decided to go here on a whim before my work. There is parking along the plaza strip, along with other food places to choose from as well. We walked in and it was empty probably because it was just hitting lunch time. I redeemed the voucher easily and we ordered a pulled pork burger for my SO and a steak burger for myself. This also came with 2 large fries and 2 large fill yourself fountain drinks. Food took about 10 mins and I was able to request some toppings on mine. I enjoyed my burger... It was an actual piece of steak medium rare like I requested. The vegetable toppings tasted really fresh and not mushy/stale. My SOs pulled pork burger fell out so we ate it with the fries. The fries tasted fresh and was plentiful. The manager or owner not sure, was very nice and checked in with us to see how everything tasted. What I'd like to see from them hopefully: loyalty program?,  brunch fare, ice cream floats/pies, frings, better buns for certain burgers such as the pulled pork so it won't get mushy, whole wheat/whole grain bun option, and tator tots! I would like to try their signature burgers, onion rings, and desserts. It was a very good experience and a convenient location."}
{"text":"Place is really nice, clean and lots of space.  The servers were incredibly friendly, chatting with everyone, laughing, they gave the place a relaxed vibe.  Has a mini patio which is cool they also serve beer which is nice :)
Burger was really good, cooked medium, juicy but not messy.  Nice range of toppings.  Rating just on the previous I'd go with 4, but the fries were a disaster.  Half were partially raw and the ones that weren't were meh, and those little Popsicle stick forks?  Also not much parking.  If you go at a busy time you'll spend a good chuck searching for somewhere to park."}
{"text":"Delicious! Their portion sizes are enormous. Definitely worth the groupon. 
Will definitely come back again! Especially for that free scoop of ice cream I got from checking in on Yelp ;)"}
{"text":"Service was great but buns were dry and didn't seem fresh. Burger was ok, nothing spectacular. A bit pricey for the quality. I had the skirt burger which came to about $10 w/ tax."}
{"text":"I came back around 2 weeks after for lunch with my husband.  It had a lot of take out orders, which is good!  I noticed 3 highchairs (yay!), but didn't bother checking the bathrooms, but I believe that they have installed change tables already.

My husband ordered the smoke burger and I had the chipotle turkey burger.  It took at least 15 minutes (I think due to the number of take out orders) which was the time they told us, but the results were better than last time!

The chipotle turkey burger was cooked well and the guacamole was flavrourful, and you got a nice kick from the chipotle!  I tried a bite of the smoke burger and it was good, and flavourful with the pulled pork inside.  The husband was happy.

I have yet to retry the poutine, and skirt burger but will do so another time.  I will return!  I just need to make sure to allocate a lot of time, as the burger turnaround isn't the fastest."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night, the place was so empty that no one came out to take our order for what seemed too long. 

We ordered the skirt burger & the classic. I think I took 1.5 bites before I had to send it back. I've NEVER sent food back. So dry, so sad, worst date night ever. I didn't even ask for my money back. The girl offered to make us fries or something else, but I just couldn't trust this joint. 

The place looks clean and nice inside, but the burgers aren't edible. Not sure if there's a hole in the burger bc I couldn't swallow this. 

Full of disappointment! I wish I could forget how bad they were. :(

Don't waste your time, ya'll."}
{"text":"Checked out Hole E burger on Coxwell and i must say i was a little underwhelmed.  

In these days of burger joints upping the \"steaks\" i was prepared to be wowed.  
Not so much - ordered the Hole E Smoke (patty, pulled pork, slaw) and found it so so.  The patty didn't seem to have the right consistency (chuck/sirloin ratio) and was pretty well done which didn't help 
The pulled pork was fairly bland and the slaw didn't pop with that acidic yum that it should.  

Nowhere near as good as NoBull's Smoke in a direct comparison.

Burgers Priest beats them all with no need for fancy toppings.  Deep fried Jalapenos and Cheese are the only toppings you need.

The fries were pretty solid.

Nice decor and layout, friendly staff.
Just not what you expect these days from a Burger joint (they're so en vogue) as the bar already sits pretty high."}
{"text":"Went here because my boyfriend had picked up a Groupon for two burgers, fries and drinks. I was really impressed with the quality of the burger, it tasted exactly like a great homemade burger would. The fries were awesome as well. I definitely would head back there Groupon or not, as the price was great for the quality!"}
{"text":"I was getting a sub last night at Mr. sub two doors down on Coxwell and someone told me the whole e burger made their own onion rings and I had such a craving. Well they deep-fried them that was fine . Have them to me in a big box. It was $7 that was ok. My God only one side of the rings were coded in there batter which all I can figure was mostly baking powder. Tasteless. The inside of the ring was hard cooked to death. The second worst onion rings I've had in my life. The first word when KFC brought them out they no longer carry them"}
