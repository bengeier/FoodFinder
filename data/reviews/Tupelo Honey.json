{"text":"Portions are terrible, and the price reeks of pretentiousness. 

4 people with no booze can't get out of there for less than 100 bucks with tip. I've never been so underwhelmed in my life. I've been to the one in Asheville and, for some reason, this one pales in comparison. 

I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This was a disappointing first visit to Tupelo Honey of Charlotte. We arrived around 4:45pm on a Saturday...so, not slow but definitely not what I would call busy. We were seated immediately and as far as service is concerned, we had no problems. The food was another story. My husband and I decided to go with the Easter dinner menu (three courses, $25 per person). Our appetizers arrived with our food. Disappointing, but we didn't make a big deal aside from mentioning it to our server (her response was, \"I don't know what the kitchen was doing.\") Unfortunately, I think our apps were the best part of the meal (goat cheese medallion and fit to be tied pickled & fried). I had the southern steak frites...completely flavorless and also cold. The potato cracklins were the star of the dish which is sad. My husband had the porterhouse pork chop, which he said was \"just ok.\" Dessert was also just ok. I left feeling like I should have gone to Cracker Barrel where I could've had mediocre food and biscuits for half the price (no offense to CB). There are so many great restaurants in Charlotte, I doubt we will be back to waste our time and money here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Their \"small plates\" option is not actually that \"small\". We ordered 4 small plates and it was a lot of food! I love the portions and the food was delicious! Service was awesome."}
{"text":"I absolutely hate driving into the South End area, but I love, love, love this place.  They do biscuits right! I have had great service each time I've been here.  There can be a bit of a wait, but that is the case with any decent restaurant.

EDIT: I still love the food at this restaurant, however, try to pay cash if you can. I had to remove a star because I used a particular credit card here (and had only used that particular card there) and within 2-3 weeks had several fraudulent charges between $200-$300 each at grocery stores.  Not necessarily accusing anyone, but I will say the waitress went out of her way and into the back for a while before coming back with a receipt to sign...  Use cash if you can."}
{"text":"3 of us came here on a Friday night.  It was difficult to find a parking spot and didn't realize the restaurant was on the second floor.  We got drinks and there's plenty of alcohol.  Didn't care for the lemon one, it was way too tart, but our server offered to replace it.  The biscuits are really excellent. The fried chicken was absolutely AMAZING and the gravy that came with it was awesome !  I got the NC trout, which was good but I didn't care for the dry breadcrumbs in the middle.  One person got the blackened catfish which was probably the healthiest option, but nothing special.  The brussel sprouts were fabulous.  Didn't care for the potato cracklings. We got the Smores chocolate lava cake for dessert.  It was really good but would have been better with white chocolate sauce instead of chocolate on chocolate.  For Xmas, peppermint in the white chocolate would be really good !  We'll definately be back."}
{"text":"Was excited about this place but found the food very heavy.  The flavors were underwhelming (in fact my dish was not even good), the offerings unappealing.  Service was very slow.  Probably would appeal to people into substantial, comfort foods. And definitely not a dieter destination!"}
{"text":"Had a group of six people, were told an hour and a half wait. That turned into a 3hour plus wait. We were seated and it took 10 minutes to get waters and even longer to get food orders in to the waitress whom it was clear had no desire or training for this job. The food came out wrong and took excessive time to get and then was mediocre at best. Just an overall terrible experience and I will never go there again. To any of the locations. It's just not up to the hype. Or price. 

If I could give less stars I would."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of this place even though it's a chain. The balcony is really nice to sit on, and even though our server seemed extremely scattered on our last visit, the meal came out just as ordered and it was one of the best plates of biscuits and gravy with chicken that I ever had. It hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Lunch with a friend today.  Their genuine country breakfast was great.  Biscuits arrived almost immediately accompanied by jam and real Tupelo honey.  Breakfast for the two of us with tip: $28.  I will return and recommend highly.

My additional comments are based only on eating there around 12:30 to 1:30 p.m."}
{"text":"Biscuits are amazing, what a great appetizer. I much prefer their breakfast/brunch menu over their lunch/dinner. Their seems to always be a wait, but it's a great restaurant. I love the eggs betty sandwich!"}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed this time.  My 3rd visit and it's nothing like my first experience, even my second...not getting better.  Southern food?...I don't think so.  Biscuits should be fluffy, not dense...these biscuits are so thick and heavy....Please lighten them up.  Green beans were described as basil and butter on the menu...I tasted NO basil whatsoever...they were way too al dente, very very bland...can someone please add some SALT to these dishes.  The fried tomatoes were the worse I've ever had...way too under-ripe...very hard and lacked seasoning.
The service needs some improving...the wait for an appetizer is way too long.  The cocktail lacked alcohol.  Probably my last visit."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good a good lamb dish anywhere,  but this was awesome!  The banana pudding was the best ever, not your usual potluck fare.  Karlee was an excellent, patient and pleasant server.  Thanks to everyone."}
{"text":"Good food but pricey for the type of food on the menu. Good southern fare with a creative punch. However, if you're craving southern food, go to Dish, it's a far better value."}
{"text":"Love this place! Fried chicken is incredible, and BLT, and BBQ is superb. I love to order the fried veggies as an app. We always have great service, - thanks William!"}
{"text":"Awesome southern food. I eat here often and it is definitely the place to go for brunch."}
{"text":"Love this place! I had two buddies in town and we wanted a good brunch menu with some drinks, so we checked it out. Great location, awesome seating on the porch and the food was out of control. We had Jonathan as a server...very cool cat, informative, shot the breeze. Good times, definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I went to tupelo Honey Cafe last night and the food was so fresh and the flavors were just so different the small plate chicken wings were so good, i had fried shrimp with the kale slaw so amazingly good i also had quinoa with feta and arugula it was good but a lot i really with they had one in long island New York ooooooh baby id be there a lot!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food here's AAAAmazing!! Fried green tomatoes are delish! Sweet potato pancakes, home fries, goat cheese grit poppers and more, whatever you order you're sure to be more than satisfied. Even more awesome is the customer service, we had Karlee helping us today, and she's just the best! Love Tupelo honey cafe!!"}
{"text":"The wings were amazing. The mac and cheese was amazing. Really enjoyed this place and can't wait to eat here again. 

Everyone on the staff was very friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Meh. After all the glowing reviews I decided to try this place. Overall the food is fine but rather ordinary. Tried the chicken BLT, the Shoo mercy grilled cheese and the onion bisque. You could certainly reproduce these easily at home and save the $25 bucks. The staff was very nice though and the restaurant itself is comfortable. It's fine to try but I won't go back. Also take the stairs because the elevator sounds like it's about to fall apart."}
{"text":"We were first timers, and the food was awesome! Karlee was awesome! Sent us home with extra biscuits. SO GOOD!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed this restaurant. We sat outside on the deck at sunset and I had the salmon and she had the shrimp and grits. I like my salmon well done and they obliged. The food was fresh and hot. We split the s'mores cake for dessert which was very good but a little pricey. It's $8.75 plus $2.25 for a scoop of ice cream so $11 for a dessert. They close at 10pm on Saturday nights which is a bit early and they locked the door at 9:58pm when I was there when I tried to go to the ladies room before leaving. 300 East Restaurant is around the corner and is a comparable restaurant for less money. 

PROS: Good food quality, nice outside deck, convenient location and parking
CONS: Price and early closing time"}
{"text":"Wonderful selection of 'small' plate' options, especially for two to share.  Right near the Light Rail, in a very nice part of the city.  Staff is attentive and very nice.  Would highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is great! Charlotte is in need of good brunch spots and this fits the bill. No bad eggs here. The mimosas are gigantic and the bloodies are AMAZING. Arrive hungry! 

Expect a wait or shoulder in for a table at the bar area. Usually more than an hour on Sundays. The parking lot is packed so be prepared to wait for a spot if you go during brunch. There is a train stop right there so if possible that would be way easier.

Special request? Weekday breakfast! Seems a little odd that you can't catch a before work biscuit if you want. 

I would make a food recommendation but it's all good. Order what you want."}
{"text":"In a nutshell: decent food, expensive and a bit overhyped. Super friendly and prompt service, even though we went on Sunday afternoon - their busiest time. Atmosphere is wonderful. Complimentary biscuits and jam are amazing (and I don't care for biscuits). We were a party of 6 - three \"good\", and three \"meh\". Hush puppies were very, very salty. My Southern breakfast bowl was lukewarm at best, and just not that appealing. The goal cheese grits were great, though. Likewise for the chopped salad - lackluster, tough chicken, and so-so greens. The bacon (on any dish) is fabulous. Service was slammed, but our waiter apologized and brought us extra biscuits. Very nice craft beer selection. Will try again when it's not so busy."}
{"text":"I took my mother and neither of us thought the food was that tasty. We both took recommendations from the waiter so we were quite disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow, the best biscuits ever to pass my lips!!  I was there for breakfast, and arrived as soon as they opened, so, it was not very crowded."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times now and have always been pleased. The breakfast bowl is unique and tasty. Black eyed peas and a homemade salsa really set it apart from typical fare and it works."}
{"text":"Had some OK but not great  experiences here but today was arguably the worst dining experience I ever had. 

We arrived at 1040 and were told the wait was about 45 minutes. We were finally seated after an hour... annoying but I can let that slide. 

But after ordering we waited, and waited, and waited. 45 minutes in the waitress came to apologize. A few minutes later the manager came to apologize. Said the kitchen was behind. Another 15 minutes go by and I complain... more apologies but still no food. No offer of free drinks. Nothing. 

After another 10 minutes with no food we get up to leave. Manager sprints out and asks us to wait a few more minutes and he will box our food and give it to us for free. So I wait. Another 5 minutes pass and he finally comes out. He was able to get 2 of our 3 dishes boxed but one was still missing. He gave it to us for free but at this point we had been there for way more than 2 hours and still didn't have all of our food. 

There's no way this should be considered acceptable. If you are that backed up, fine, stop seating people so you can catch up. Offer free drinks or free future meals. Make some effort. We were calm, we were polite, and we were understanding for the most part. But no place is good enough to warrant a wait and poor service like this. 

I can't imagine I will ever go back. Shame. The food is good. But the place is poorly run."}
{"text":"Not as impressive as I thought it would be.  The food was ok.  My uncle and husband said their food was great.  It looked like a rice bowl.  I had the kale salad and was not that impressed.  Typical chain, service was slow but nice."}
{"text":"Was really excited to eat here after reading the menu but the comfort food didn't materialize. Had the meatloaf and it was unfortunately dry. Mac n Cheese was very run of the mill and didn't appear to be baked. The pulled pork egg roll app was good though. $50 for two drinks, app, entree and tip. Wish it was better than it was. Place could be great!"}
{"text":"After writing a scathing review of another restaurant, we figured we had to give props where props were due. 
We went into the bar yesterday afternoon just to have a drink and ended up having a great time. The manager came over almost right away and after talking to us for a bit, told us to order an appetizer on him to celebrate our little \"staycation\".  The staff in the bar was very friendly and fun to chat with and very accommodating with any of our requests. The appetizer we ordered - chips with pimento cheese dip - was excellent. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was a welcome treat! Plus met some great people while there! I will be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Such a good place to eat. Had a couple good drafts and the wings were fantastic. As good as the food was our service was even better. Cesar went over the top all evening for our group and we had a great time. Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere 
Delicious Southern food with a twist
Our server, William, was wonderful!!
Save room for the Banana Pudding - OH MY!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants. The food and service was excellent! My friends and I will definitely be returning! The atmosphere was pleasant and relaxing along with the good food and service I could not have asked for a better evening!Highly recommend you give them a try!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  My first visit to the Charlotte location but I've been to several out of town. In traditional Tupelo Honey fashion, there was a wait. But hey it was Labor Day and yes the food is good so I didn't mind. The good thing was they said 45-1 hr but it was only about 30. I love the fried green tomatoes and grits so that was my starter and it never disappoints. For my meal, I had the smoked jalapeño fried egg BLT. I opted for the jalapeño aioli on the side because I don't like things spicy. It was good and not too much kick. The sandwich was good and the potatoes on the side were seasoned great. My only complaint was my bread was too greasy. Not greasy enough that I wouldn't make another visit. I'd definitely give them another try. Next time, I'd see if it's consistently greasy or just request it without the buttered bread. Awesome place!!!

P.S. The $3 mimosas were great too!!!"}
{"text":"Brunch was on point this morning, Jalapeno Bloodies, Shoo Mercy Omelette and Shrimp & Grits were amazing.  Service was a 10/10 as well, ask to sit at one of Jonathan's tables... he is worth it!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of our favorite places, but they have changed the menu so much recently and I think it has gotten away from what made it great in the first place. They used to have this amazing fish dish with pickled tomatoes and risotto that was my absolute favorite, then one day it was gone, since then I just haven't found anything on the menu that is as good.
It's fine, there's nothing wrong with it, but I think it has lost some of it's quirky, original, local flair that made it what it is today.
We go on occasion, but not nearly as much as we used to."}
{"text":"Jonathan was awesome!  Best staff in town.  Thanks for the soy sausage in my omelette."}
{"text":"Food was ok. Server was great. Poor communication with seating waited over an hour with a group of thirteen only to try to seat all of us in two booths totally unacceptable"}
{"text":"Great food and great service! We sat in the bar area and Tiara at the bar is a fantastic mixologist and we wanted her to sit down and join us at girls night! Well worth it. Be back soon!"}
{"text":"We just had brunch at tupelo honey cafe and it was incredible. The food was amazing and our server Jonathan was wonderful. Jonathan was extremely helpful and answered all of our questions. He was genuinely friendly and you could tell he enjoyed his job. Can't wait to start bring people here."}
{"text":"The food is good, but overpriced, and in my opinion the restaurant is a bit overrated. The ambiance is cute, and the service is good. The biscuits are awesome! There are other breakfast/brunch places in Charlotte that I would choose to visit over Tupelo Honey."}
{"text":"Any time we've had the chance to eat here it has been great. The original in Asheville is where it's at but this comes in close without having to drive to the mountains. The portions are large so I'd suggest ordering less than you think you want. The fried avocado and shrimp & grits are delicious."}
{"text":"This is perhaps my favorite lunch spot in Charlotte. The food is always amazing and today was no different. If you want great southern style food this is the place. The bus quits and macaroni and cheese are to die for. Our server today was William and he was an absolute pleasure to work with. Courteous and helpful are understatements. William was on top of things as soon as we walked in and didn't stop till we left. One last thing if you like Bloody Mary's they have delicious one here. Must try it!!!! I already look forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Breakfast...no wait...brunch...no wait, lunch. Ah, what the heck some of it all! Tasty, unique and amazing service. Thanks Jonathan for the culinary tour and guidance!  We'll be back! 

Friendly service. Unique and tasty wholesome food with southern twist. Wow on the unique Bloody Mary mixes. 
Place gets busy, and there's a reason why!"}
{"text":"It is the perfect place for a perfect southern brunch! It was our first time at Tupelo and Jonathan was a real delight indeed - he told us how all the food is made from scratch and materials sourced locally. When I told him I am a vegetarian, he walked me through the menu and offered me additional options as well. The food was delicious and the \"okra obsession\" is easily my new favorite dish! Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Shoo mercy.  One of my favorite tracks except for the chaotic parking.  Kickin Chicken salad is highly recommended.   Not quite the homey feel of the original Asheville location, by a Charlotte treat none the less.  Make reservations ahead of time as brunch wait can be super long."}
{"text":"Whats good about Tupelo Honey: Their Bar!
I had a great experience the few times I've dined there with bartenders and some craft cocktails and beer. 
The menu looks and sounds scrumptious, but every thing I've eaten is just ok.  Not bad, but not the best I've had either.  The food just falls flat.  I've had the Skirt Steak, Potato Cracklins, and Green Tomato Chow Chow. The steak wasn't cooked properly and wasn't seasoned at all. The Potato Cracklings were just a disappointment.  I've also got the pork chops which were just ok.
I can only speak about the bar service and it was great - thus a three start review versus two stars.  I may go back when in the area for drinks, but I can't say I'll pay for another disappointing meal."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch once a while back. I had the southern breakfast bowl and enjoyed it. We've been meaning to return"}
{"text":"This place will definitely be in our regular rotation. We got here about 600 on Friday night, which was just in time to beat the big crowds.  Service was extremely attentive and prompt. 
I ordered my 4 year old daughter a grilled cheese sandwich and fruit along with our apps and she literally ate the entire plate of food, plus a biscuit, which is very unusual! I can only assume it was great!! And those biscuits. Soooooo yummy. Flaky and buttery and hot!! I could have eaten 10! They may be my favorite biscuit from a restaurant. Fried green tomatoes were nice; I'm not really a connoisseur of these so will defer to others, I thought they were good but only the second time I've ever eaten them. For dinner, I got the crab cakes, which looked a little bready, so I was concerned, but were delicious with lots of crab. They had a hard crust vs most with a soft crust, but I liked them a lot. And the Swiss chard and asparagus mix on the side was yummy. I wished there were more of it. I tried my husband's pulled pork and it was super yummy and a HUGE portion. We had a table of 8 and everyone seemed very happy with their food. We eat out a lot so we will definitely be back. 

One piece of advice, we ordered so many apps that we were totally full after entrees. Next time I will skip some so we can try the desserts!

Only downer is parking but I can't knock the restaurant for that. The parking sucks though. Be prepared to walk a block unless you want to run up your blood pressure looking for a space in the tiny adjacent lot."}
{"text":"Everything was delicious!!! From the opening biscuits and blueberry spread to the praline bacon and the eggs betty! Everything we had was so so yummy! Big plates! We ordered too much as we often eat with our eyes. The pancakes in rum sauce are delicious but a hefty plate and slightly overwhelming if not sharing. Would definitely recommend and would return here."}
{"text":"Just ok. The craft drinks were really good but the food was just ok."}
{"text":"A bit over-priced, but good food and unique concepts."}
{"text":"The food here is unique and yet still has that home cooked flavor and ambience. Good service and a casual but well appointed atmosphere. It is a small chain that seems to have found the secret to making each restaurant location as good as the original...No cheap copies here!"}
{"text":"After all the food that I consumed there I had food coma.. it was that good! The goat cheese grits mmmm... it was DELISH! The fried chicken and biscuits... every bite was just too good!  After walking up all those stairs just to get there was well worth it!"}
{"text":"I don't know what is up with Charlotte lately, but this will be my second bad review in a week. My husband and I came here on Sunday for brunch. Having been to the Asheville location he was excited to try this one. I have been to this location once with my girlfriends and knew that there would obviously be a wait. When we arrived sure enough there was a 35-40 minute wait. Okay sounds fine and we were informed that we could sit in the bar if a table opened up. As luck would have it (or so we thought) a table opened up! Sure! Take our beeper for our table! We already have one in the bar area! BIG MISTAKE! After waiting about 15 minutes to get someone's attention we were finally able to get some water and coffee. At the same time we ordered our food as we didn't know when we would e able to get her again. However, there was no sugar and after going to the bar several times and telling our waitress it finally arrived about ten minutes later. Just in time to have my coffee be cold before even tasting it. So, 25 minutes to enjoy a coffee. And we waited for our food.... And waited.... And waited.... All during this time to see other people who were seated after us in the bar area enjoy their food. After trying to get our waitress' attention (looking directly at us and us about to speak she literally would ignore us and go onto the next table! Not even acknowledge that we needed anything!) when we finally got her attention (after sitting down for an hour and about 50 minutes or so since we ordered our food) we asked her where our food was. She said the kitchen was backed up yada yada yada. But, if that was the case how come at least two other tables before us were served promptly and AFTER we had sat down. About an hour and 20 minutes after sitting down we got our food and basically not even an apology or wanting to comp so much as our coffee. It got so bad that my husband and I were about to walk out right before they sat our food down. It takes a lot for my husband to be upset with service to not come back somewhere and to be honest I don't know if we will ever come back to this location... At least not for Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Inspired menu, my first thought was \"southern comfort/euro-cuisine fusion\". There are some very original dishes. Chicken fried saltimbocca ... whaaaat!? Can I get a \"yum\"?!

Ask for the \"Chef's Table\", it's a counter really but you can enjoy watching all the action on the line as they prepare all that delicious food which is entertaining. Plus you get to preview what the other dishes look like!"}
{"text":"Had a reservation for brunch with my mom.  We were seated pretty quickly on the patio, which is great.  Karlee was our waitress and she was great.  I had the Honeysuckle Lavender Flip to sip along with my brunch, which she recommended, and it was delicious.  Service was courteous and the food and drinks were great.  I'll definitely return for happy hour some time. The small plates and martini specials look too good to miss."}
{"text":"I've had dinner here before and it was excellent. Today we went to Tupelo for brunch and it was even better. Amazing Bloody Marys, and the Shrimp N Grits will make you want to slap yo Momma! Really - one of the most delicious meals in Charlotte, and the team has such great personality it makes it a fun environment. 

The only thing it needs is more scale. There was a good 1 hour wait at 11am on a Saturday. But that just gave us an excuse to sit on the balcony and enjoy a cocktail from the bar!"}
{"text":"As expected, Tupelo Honey Charlotte did not disappoint! Even for their first night open to the public, the front of house and back of house did a fantastic job!!  Our party of four could not have been happier with our evening or more thrilled that they're now in our backyard!

Our favorites? Of course, the incredible biscuits with blueberry spread and honey, Appalachian Egg Rolls (amazing BBQ pork egg rolls), Fried Green Tomatoes, Shoo-mercy Shrimp and Grits, Chicken Saltimbocca and Grilled Cheese (cheddar and havarti, please!) with fantastic Tomato Bisque. You'll want to go back again and again!

Everything you love about the Asheville locations will now be a shining star in Charlotte! If you've never been, by all means GET THERE!! Delicious food and attentive, friendly staff. What more do you need?!?"}
{"text":"This place... where do I began. I am a self-proclaimed amateur chef, so when I dine out, I'm very selective. I look for digs n dines that can \"burn\" it better than I can.  I first visited this place in Asheville and when I found out that a location was just sitting there.. minutes away from my house in Charlotte.. I caught the Holy Ghost.  I had the home fries, bacon, goat cheese grits, scrambled eggs w/ cheese and unlimited buttermilk biscuits.  The food was *standing ovation*. The ambiance was... the epitome of urban oasis.  My only complaint was that eventually... I had to go home.  A hearty, savory meal  w/ a charming atmosphere... all for under 10 bucks! I've dined and gone to heaven :)"}
{"text":"My friend took me for my birthday lunch here. It was my first time and it was awesome!!  The fried chicken blt was excellent and it was hard to decide which side dish! I did what our very attentive and personable waiterJonathan suggested and added Havarti cheese and advocada to the sandwich! Delicous!! Thanks JONATHAN!!!"}
{"text":"Wife and I were out for a Monday date night.  They have a good selection of draft beer for $2.00 on Monday. We had the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer. There were 4 slices for nearly $8.00 and they were not tart enough to have a good flavor.  My wife got the nut crusted chicken and she enjoyed it but did not enjoy the sweet potatoes.  I had the Charleston Chicken Sandwich. The bread was too saturated in butter and had to be removed. The grilled chicken was about 4 ounces and was plain.  I did get the Southern Greens as a side and they were very good. Dinner was around $53.00 for the two of us with tip.  In all I expect more for this price."}
{"text":"The first time I visited the food and service was great. Went back for the second time recently and the service was beyond awful. The server didn't acknowledge us for a while. The food took about an hour to come out and they forgot one of our dishes. By the time they brought out the dish we had already eaten and we're ready to leave. Never going back."}
{"text":"I have never eaten at Tupelo Honey before but have been told by many people that I absolutely had to.
First of all it is really cute inside, I definitely felt like the decor went along with the Southern style they were going for.
Our server was incredible.  He walked us through all of the different options we had and gave us great suggestions.  He actually ordered my friend's entire meal!
I had the Shoo Cheese grilled cheese sandwich and the flavor was wonderful but I wouldn't have really been able to eat it because the bread was super toasted and hard, but dipping it in my soup, the way I eat it anyway, made it much better,  My friend got the black bean burger and it was AWESOME!!  She also got the creamy onion soup with croutons, which are made from the AMAZING biscuits, and that was delicious too,  'We had a wonderful experience and will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Had bruch at tulipo honney Got the southern pooting scramber yum!  Egg, bacon, granvy and toaat. Even got a binscuit with jame! Good momosa too wow! There bar has ice on it and keep glase cold what a great idea! Also like the cheerwire finger paints of #3 \"dale \" junior johnson go nascar go tulip honey"}
{"text":"My husband and I took my siblings on the first Saturday Tupelo Honey was open and we loved it! I also want to give the manager big kuddos for personal service. My little brother is a type 1 diabetic and started getting low while we were waiting on a table, I asked the manager if we could order a biscuit for him to nibble on while we waited. The manager was super friendly and quickly brought out a biscuit and refused to accept payment. Tupelo Honey was such a wonderful expereince. The staff was super friendly and the food amazing!"}
{"text":"Jenna is great. Brian does a great job. We always have a good time here. Great food and service!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Solid brunch and lunch. I've gotten the grit bowls and a variety of salads at lunch time. Moderately priced. Get a reservation if you want to go for Saturday or Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"William was awesome! He made our morning and made great suggestions. The fried okra was out favorite appetizer."}
{"text":"I hated to give this 3 stars because I loved this place when I was in Asheville and to be honest the food was just as great as it was there BUT! The service today was soooooo sloooow 
It must've been an off day for them. The A/C was very cold and people were complaining about that and there was no soap in the men's restroom and posted above the sink was a sign stating \"all employees must wash their hands.\" That was a little unsettling. I think, if the management would tighten everything up a bit, this place would be deserving of 4 or 5 stars because as I stated before, the food and options are terrific."}
{"text":"Went here last night to eat and the service was poor. No silverware when seated, drinks took a while. The pimento dip was skimped on. I order the veggie grits and a side of soysage. The soysage came out after my check was delivered. Not good enough for the hassle and nothing like the Asheville location."}
{"text":"Topeka honey is the best it has great service and great food I love the food
 My favorite is the biscuits and gravy they are so so so good  it is my favorite breakfast place in the world"}
{"text":"What a really nice evening. We sat outside for dinner on a beautiful evening. The avocado toast points were good and the fried green tomatoes with seasoned grits were outstanding. Hubby had the trout and I had the catfish. Both meals were very good; flavorful and reasonably priced. Yummy biscuits with honey and blueberry preserves. Happy hour pricing on apps. Service was great. Would love to return when back in the area."}
{"text":"Asheville has a Tupelo Honey Café.  It was delicious there and good here too!  Great place for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Yummy BBQ sandwich.  Free pint glass via email signup.  Ice strip on the bar (more cool than functional but whatever, it's cool!  Ha!).  If I remember correctly, it has a fairly large dining area.  The hostess was one of those typical HS kids that couldn't care less and was only minimally helpful/pleasant.  Good help is hard to find, I guess.  The bartender was nice and attentive.  The honey was meh and the biscuit was meh but that sammich!  Yummy."}
{"text":"The Shoo Mercy pancake was amazing! Jonathan was a awesome waiter, gave useful suggestions and made our time great. Thanks Jonathan!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great service! I was a little disappointed in the jam. When I ate at the one in Asheville last year, they gave out blackberry jam, which was amazing. This one in Charlotte gave out a mediocre blueberry. Overall, a great dinner. The outdoor seating is beautiful with lights strung. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Really great and wholesome food. All of their ingredients are organic and delicious. The service is nice and quick. We were surprised by the free appetizer of biscuits with fresh blueberry jam. I would recommend to anyone looking for a fresh and tasty restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food and great customer service, banana pancakes where awsome and my wife loved the pork belly appetizer, and the biscuits and jelly are the best. Our server lauren was really nice and attentive."}
{"text":"We stopped in here while we were in Charlotte after a wedding. Food was very comforting and drinks were good. The only thing that was bad was the long wait without a reservation."}
{"text":"I'm definitely not from the south, but really liked the Tupelo.  The food was of course extremely healthy if healthy meant a 2000+ calorie meal loaded with carbs, saturated fat and more fat :)

Seriously, don't worry about your calorie count when you come here and just enjoy the fried chicken with the thick white gravy, biscuits and pancakes on the side.  Oh and don't forget to overdose on their sweet tea before, during and after your belly busting meal :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in town and asked a friend for r commendations. She suggested we check out this place. Being self proclaimed foodys we enjoy good quality food. The location was very easy to find. The atmosphere was fun and relaxing. We chose to eat outside as we are from New York and wanted to soak up as much sun as possible. The wait staff was great. Always asking how we were doing and keeping up on the water refills. My wife went with a fresh grilled chicken salad and I chose the grilled salmon. Both choices were excellent. I would highly recommend this place as it has options to suit anyone's pallet."}
{"text":"I've been to the one in Asheville and was excited to try the Charlotte location. Worst service I have ever received in my life. Will not ever be going back."}
{"text":"This place is excellent ! The space is open enough so that even on a busy Saturday, the environment is not loud or stressful. The food is to die for and a great price for locally sourced food with no fillers. We had the shop mercy pancake and the shoo mercy burger. TO DIE FOR. The only thing that I might say is even better than the food was the service that we got from our server, Jonathan. We've recently moved to Charlotte and he was very inviting and helpful not to mention incredibly knowledgable of the menu and friendly. We definitely will be back here."}
{"text":"We had the worst service. We're ignored for 20 minutes at the bar waiting for a drink. Never got biscuits despite asking 4 times. Out server seemed to neglect us while spending more time with other tables. One of our members didn't get her food until 20 minutes after the rest of us. The food we got was cold. We finally asked for a manager who only made excuses for his restaurants poor service. Apparently there was a \"circus\" in town and \"little people\" took over the restaurant at 4pm so they started the night in a rush and so by 630p they were too behind to recover, according to him. Our server then dropped off our bills without saying a word and waiting 15 minutes before picking them up again. We love other locations but we will not be back to this one. We finally had to get the same excuse ridden manager to run our checks. Absolutely terrible"}
{"text":"The Shoo mercy pancake it's a must! Beyond any chicken and waffle, these sweet potato pancakes and fried chicken easily take you to another galaxy of flavor!"}
{"text":"Awesome tasty menu that has good quality fresh ingredients and awesome atmosphere! I had the good country breakfast . Cool decor."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate a late lunch here on a Saturday and the place was PACKED so we sat by the kitchen bar since there was no wait and we loved the seats because we got to see how the cooks make the food and how they plate and all that jazz. All I can say is that those boys can make some great food and they go 100 miles per hour! 

Our sever was very nice and she was really busy so I appreciate good service when the place is packed. 

The food was so good! I ordered a black bean burger and fried okra. We also got biscuits with honey and jam and they were amazing. Next time I go I want to try their breakfast. They do serve breakfast all day which is nice.

There were a lot of tables with kids and families so this place is kid friendly too."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch!! Most unusual combination of eggs and such. Homemade blackberry jam. Good coffee and the drinks looked awesome."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on a trip to Charlotte. I loved the pulled pork egg rolls and my friend's fried chicken sandwich and brussels sprout salad looked amazing. I didn't love the fried avocado but would definitely come back here!"}
{"text":"Don't bother and ignore the hype.  This was terrible.  It took an hour to get our food.  It was ice cold when it arrived.  So we sent back some of it (our kids were starving so they are it anyway) and ours never came back.  26 minutes later and our grilled cheese still didn't arrive.  No one seemed to be caring.  The waitress said it was the kitchen.  There were at least three 'manager-ish' guys around but they seemed much more concerned with getting more people seated than getting the food right.  Not ONE of them noticed that no food was getting out.  Then I got the bill and they took 40% off but still charged me for the food I didn't even get.  One manager was the guy who said 'I'll have your food remade' but never bothered to make sure we actually received it.  He also said 'I can give a discount or take off the food, but not both.'   This was pretty disappointing.  I think I'd be less annoyed if anyone gave a hoot after it was screwed up and made sure it was fixed.  But they didn't.  No one took ownership, not once, and -- new restaurant or not -- someone needs to be paying attention."}
{"text":"Great space and good food! The Chicken & Biscuits at my choice today.  ask for butter to go with ur free biscuit with compote"}
{"text":"Super busy but this place is a well oiled machine. The food was fabulous! Our server Kimberly was tops! We couldn't have asked for a better brunch. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Breakfast here is delicious. The biscuits they bring you to start are buttery and soft. I had the BLT with smoked jalapeno aioli and home fries with pimento cheese. Soooo good, great flavor from both. My husband had the fried chicken and biscuits, which he devoured. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals that I'd ever had. I definitely wouldn't recommend this restaurant. It was very busy, which is why I excused some of the service. But as we settled into our table, I started to feel invisible there. My daughter and I didn't even eat our meal. The pancakes were favor-less. The best part was the biscuits."}
{"text":"We were thrilled to hear THC was openin in Charlotte!!  Great food!!!  No question at all!!!   Service? Not so much.  Having a late lunch. 5 tables seated. 7 wait staff. And still incredibly slow. They are out of soda products. And they just cleared the table next Tonys where the mom had simply taken her younger son to the restroom. Obviously check had not been paid, but they still cleared the table. We've been waiting 15 mins & still jo food.  Hope they work the kinks out soon.  We want them to survive!!!"}
{"text":"Haven't even ordered and I'm disappointed.  Twenty five minute wait for outdoor seating at 230 in the afternoon.  So I sat at the bar, the only place with no wait.  After ten munutes, The bartender is interacting and I got my drink fast but the bar is dirty and there is a check still sitting next to me from the last patron."}
{"text":"We decided to try brunch at Tupelo on Christmas Eve prior to the Panthers game in Charlotte  (South End). I can't remember having a more spot on eating experience. Our waiter was friendly and on time. The cook times were incredibly fast. And the food....Our party of four was stopping just short of high fives at the quality and flavor of our dishes. Eggs Betty, a slight variation of a classic Benedict was the best I've ever had. For dessert we split some sweet potato pancakes- phenomenal. Tupelo Honey brings a southern tilt to old classics and new trends as well.  Thumbs up all around. Thank you for a great Christmas Eve family event."}
{"text":"I give Tupelo's Brunch specifically 5 stars as I argue it's one of the best in town. Great food choices, I've had the shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles and challah French toast, all amazing. Great coffee, great cocktails. 
 Be warned, make a reservation in advance for this place as it gets crazy on the weekends"}
{"text":"Service well short of food quality.  Nothing more irritating than being rushed and bullied out in order for restaurant to turn tables.  Server (and trainee) threw check in front of me less than halfway through meal, then proceeded to pace back and forth awaiting payment.  Mind you Tupelo was half empty at time.  Never even offered dessert, so desperate were they to seat the next party of 4.  Except there was no one waiting to be seated.  If I wanted the rushed and surly treatment, any fast food franchise would have sufficed."}
{"text":"The food, service and location were very good.  I don't have anything that I would necessarily say was wrong....I just don't see it on my short list of favorite go to spots!"}
{"text":"Adorable decor. LOVE the ceiling fans and old frame window/door collection. Fried okra, lamb meatballs oh so yummy. Tad bit too much salt finish on the okra for my liking but hey, didn't stop me ...portions were HUGE. Thank you from all who enjoy leaving a restaurant completely satisfied. Shrimp and grits were creamy and plentiful with shrimp and chorizo. Fried chicken was crispy yet moist. Bone in pork chop was tasty, tender and cooked to perfection. 
Great atmosphere. Pleasant staff. Friendly greeting and departing."}
{"text":"Only open a couple of weeks but not a good experience. Waited over an hour to receive our food. Waitress was nice but had way too many tables. Food was just ok.
I normally do not write reviews but felt like I should share."}
{"text":"What an amazing experience! Not only was the food exceptional, but our service might have been the best we've ever had. Thank you to Ernesto for making our lunch extremely special. I wish there was one in Florida! We'll have to make a trip back! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Service was great! Swift! Genuinely friendly! Such a charming atmosphere! Both warm and inviting from the moment you walk upstairs. Had the Orange Sesame Greens with Spiced Shrimp! Absolutely delightful."}
{"text":"I visited this place once and it was really awesome. I will definitely go back. Biscuits are so buttery and fresh. The meatloaf was yummy."}
{"text":"We sat outside and had an enjoyable meal. The food was very good and the service excellent. We liked the small plate choices, fried green tomatoes, goat cheese with dates, and fried avocado. Bread pudding and pecan pie, wow!"}
{"text":"Updated review:  Hit or Miss.  The only thing consistent about this place is its inconsistency.  Been here several times after my initial review and the food wasn't as good and the service was absolutely awful.  The wait for the food was at least an hour and our server would disappear constantly.  When we finally got our food, the food was cold and was either overlooked or undercooked.  It was a mess.  It's a terrible experience if it's busy.  Decent experience after the lunch rush or the brunch rush.  I would not recommend going on the weekend unless you go early.  On the upside, the manager discounted our bill since we had such bad service and our food was cold.  She really tried to make things right, but it was too late.  We were hungry and ate the food cold."}
{"text":"Great food the biscuits are great and our waiter Johnathan was fabulous. He knew the menu,made suggestions,knew how the restaurant got it start and was just an all arpund great guy. Wondering if he could  be spared to teach all the waiters every where about customer service."}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner there recently. Had been for breakfast in the past. Everyone's meal (sweet potato pancakes, friend chicken, grilled cheese, pasta) was tasty. Little pricey $80 for family but good location and fun to go to."}
{"text":"Tupelo honey is great!! 1/2 price wine on Wednesday! Go see Tiara at the bar! Great mixologist and super nice and friendly!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. I have been looking forward to trying this well rated resturant. I was turned away when I asked for seating for 1 on the patio. I was told they didn't have seating for just one. No, \"it will be a xx minute wait.\" Just no. So I went across the street to Liberty and guess what, I got a table, for 1, on the patio."}
{"text":"I just don't understand how a \"MEGAmosa\" is served in a regular wine glass. This drink used to come in a pint glass and one was plenty per person, however this is no longer the case. And this drink is $10. The waiter even questioned it. Overpriced for sure. Why has this changed? Our food was awesome as well as our waiter, but very disappointed by the mimosas."}
{"text":"Two of us stopped in for lunch around 11:30 and were seated in the bar area although the restaurant wasn't crowded.  The bartender/waiter took our drink/meal order but 40 minutes later we were still waiting.  I waived at him and he acknowledged me but never came back to the table.  We finally walked out.

Aside from the poor service (bartenders should tend the bar - not wait tables), their menu is new and it offers very little for the price.

I will not be going back!"}
{"text":"I really want this place to be five stars.  I love the menu, food, concept and decor.

We ate here last Saturday for a late lunch and had great food but mediocre service.  Waitress was really bad about refills and forgot several things we requested on our order.  Very little personality.

The labor market must be terrible in Charlotte for servers or management here does not know how to hire.  Second visit and second time I felt the staff belonged at Denny's."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in charlotte. Their biscuits are hands down the best biscuits I've ever eaten, and they bring them to you before every meal. So delicious. Their fried green tomatoes are great, as are their veggie offerings. I usually get the veggie bowl which has goat cheese grits, black eyed peas, sautéed greens, okra, and some sort of salsa on top. It's huge and amazing. Haven't been for brunch yet but have heard wonderful things."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place on a business trip. It was Sunday and brunch was in full swing!  We started with Queen Bloody Mary. Everything about it was perfection!  Celery, okra, pickled green bean, jalapeño, bacon and pimento stuffed olive. Amazing!  Our server, Alicia, was the BEST. She went over the whole menu and made recommendations. She cracked us up the whole time. Sweet potato pancakes with fried chicken filled us up. Flaky home style biscuits made Mama's fingers stick together!  Such a blast. Make sure you come hungry!"}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago for the weekend and heard great reviews about Tupelo. We finally decided to check it out prior to our departure and it was well worth it. The food and drinks were good but what made our dining experience spectacular was our waiter, William, he was the best!!! Very attentive and showed us that southern hospitality. Next time I'm in NC, I will definitely be coming back. Not only for the food but for William's professionalism, expertise and charm. He was the icing on top of the cake. 5 stars for Tupelo and 10 stars for William."}
{"text":"Love the omelets and Cobb salad here. Jenna was really attentive and made sure that everything was fine with my meal!"}
{"text":"Had heard good things about Tupelo Honey, but unfortunately, this was a pretty disappointing visit. We got there at 5 pm on a Friday because my sister has a young child and they tend to eat on the earlier side and because we needed to be out of there relatively quickly. Although the restaurant was almost completely empty, we had to wait almost 15 minutes to get a table (and that was after we finally asked if we could be seated soon because we had to be somewhere).

Lots of credit to our server who was great with my 2 year old nephew and brought his food out ASAP.  To be honest, my nephew's sweet potato pancake that I stole a bite of was probably the best out of everything we ordered. Unfortunately, the vegetarian options for the adults were just weak (I think they just rolled out a new menu?) and we basically had to order a bunch of sides. Not impressed.  There wasn't even a veggie sandwich option.

Mac and cheese came out cold so we had to send it back. The edamame was a bit soggy and just didn't taste that fresh. We ordered the pimiento cheese appetizer but it didn't come out until after we got the main course (it was clear they forgot about it). 

I hear they are opening up a branch in Arlington, Virginia soon, so hopefully that branch will get its act together (and actually have some good vegetarian options too)."}
{"text":"I love southern food and this place did not disappoint. They serve classic southern dishes but in a refined way. They served us biscuits with blueberry jam before our meals arrived. The blueberry jam was amazing! I need to know if they sell that in a jar. I had the fried chicken with fried okra and shaved brussel sprouts salad. The chicken and okra were great but the brussel sprouts stole the show. Great ambiance and vibe. Definitely a must for a date night. 

BTW our waiter was the most attentive waiter ever! I've been to several restaurants where I had to flag down our waiter/waitress to get more water. But at Tupelo, I've never been so hydrated in my life."}
{"text":"Holy cow, it was good. Jonathan took excellent care of us, from menu recs to advice on local points of interest. Ordered off brunch menu, our group tried the shrimp & cheese grits, fried chicken & biscuits, and the sweet potato pancake with fried chicken and bacon. Not to mention the sweet tea, Applewood Blvd. cocktail, and banana pudding for dessert. Don't judge me. You'll understand if you make the stop."}
{"text":"I had brunch at 10am on Sunday. This was my first time at Tupelo. My server, Ashley, struck the balance between attentiveness and allowing my party to enjoy our time. She did a great job. The food is locally sourced southern cuisine. The portions are GENEROUS, feel free to split an entree or eat half and box the rest for later. The next time I am in the Charlotte area, I hope to return."}
{"text":"Likes: Great southern-inspired comfort food! Great bloody marys! Good beer selection.

Gripes: Wish that they took reservations all the time because the wait can be really long!

Bottom line: I would highly recommend but be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"I think I let all the write-ups and talk set my expectation.  This is mediocre at best.  Bland.  Very bland."}
{"text":"This place is so different from all the restaurants around the city and is simply great. The menu is different and interesting. The food is super delicious, the interior decor is different and beautiful and the service is friendly. Fried okra was terrific. The prices are reasonable too. Overall, a unique experience. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wow!!!  I visited this place today with my new colleague.  I was so impressed with the service (William-Waiter Extraordinaire) & the General Manager (David-True Culinary Wizard).  It was very balmy out, so we decided to sit in side.  There was a buzz in the air!  We were greeted by a very nice hostess who sat us promptly.  Our Waiter-William has such engaging personality.  He was very knowledgeable about the menu.  What was so important to me was that he listened so attentively to my dietary needs (Gluten and Dairy Allergies). I ordered the Salmon(Grilled) was served with carrot and kale slaw with avocado lime vinaigrette.  I also ordered the Appalachian Corn Soufflé.  William came back to our table with David and they shared with me that the Soufflé was not dairy free. I was so impressed by the professionalism and detail to my dietary need.  David said he would make me String Beans with Garlic.  This most definitely should be on the menu! The string beans were flavorsome.  It was an explosion in my mouth.  First, you have the crispiness of the beans, next the fresh basil ribbon, the sweetness of the garlic, and the garlic oil left us talking about throughout the meal.  I shared with my new colleague.  The Salmon was so very fresh, very light, grilled to perfection.  This is the best meal I have had in Charlotte.  William, our waiter was so very accommodating, amazing service, and a pleasure to speak with. My colleague had Fried Chicken Salad.  He said it was delicious.  After our meal, I visited with David and shared with him this was by far \"The Best Honey Tupelo's\".  He visited our table one more time and I asked what was the secret to the string beans.  He said with smile, it was a secret.  We thanked him and William brought our check.  We left with a big smile!  We were walking to our car and we see David runs to us.  He caught up to us in the parking lot and presented me with this beautiful cookbook based on the recipes and secrets of Honey Tupelo.  I was really taken back.  All I can say is make this priority and visit them both.  I would definitely ask for William the server.  Say hello to David, he definitely made my day!  This truly is the \"VERY BEST HOSPITALITY\"!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Tupelo Honey Cafe!  Excellent customer service, our waiter Jonathan was amazing!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"While we all know the food is phenomenal and Sunday brunch will be packed, if you make a reservation for 11:30, seated by 11:45 (all good), but don't get your food until after 1pm, something in the kitchen isn't quite right. Hope they can improve."}
{"text":"Good southern food.  They try to give it a bit of a twist.  Location is fun.  But would I be back? Ehhhh probably not.  Food was good but not great.  Solid.  Nothing on the menu jumped out at me and the taste was good but not exceptional."}
{"text":"Great Service. Great Food.  Cesar was a terrific waiter.  Very attentive and cheerful.   Don't miss this place for Sunday breakfast."}
{"text":"This was a perfect lunch spot and the food was great if you like southern dishes! The fried okra and Mac'n'cheese were better than you'd expect and they were running a drink special so we could take home souvenir glasses!"}
{"text":"My husband brought me here for my birthday the end of August. Let me start by saying that you know that you can have fantastic food, but poor wait staff service and I will never return to your establishment. I know this is true for me and what's also true is that I may be the most analytical person alive. 
Now let's get to the review for TUPELO HONEY and EMERSON! If you've been here you know their food is delicious. It's a southern twist with a beautiful ambience. We would have dined outside, but it was raining so we opted to dine in. We started with the Pimento Cheese Nachos as an appetizer. They were seasoned to perfection and were so delicious. While waiting on the appetizer, Emerson brought out some biscuits and blueberry preserves!  The biscuits were good but the preserves, all I can say is Shoo Mercy( when you visit you be saying the same thing). For our main course, we had Shoo Mercy Shrimp And Grits and Shoo Mercy Pancakes. It's was amazing! The Shoo Mercy Shrimp and Grits was recommended by our waiter. And he was right, it made me say Shoo Mercy! Lol the Shoo Mercy Pancakes was one of his recommendations as well, it had potato pancakes and southern fried chicken. Such an amazing combination. Shoo Mercy, once again! 
Now, what really made our experience so unforgettable was our waiter, EMERSON! This guy gets 5 STARS. He was knowledgable from the menu selection to the history of \"Shoo Mercy\".  Most of all he had energy and made us feel like it was his pleasure to make our dinning experience pleasurable. It was my birthday dinner and although he wasn't aware,  he made my birthday dinner one that will never be forgotten. His customer service and just his attentiveness was unprecedented for that level of dining. You would expect his customer service level at maybe The Fig Tree Restaurant. We will return and will definitely ask to be seated in Emerson's area. Thanks Emerson!"}
{"text":"The service is AWFUL but the food is good.  Ive been sitting here waiting on someone to take my order for 20 minutes now......and counting."}
{"text":"Very pleasant experience!  Their fried green tomatoes were delicious as was the entire we chose.  A ltltle noisy but a very nice dining experience"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner with friends. The food was all delicious and the drinks were just as great. Our waiter was kind and helpful. I wish we had one in Columbus, Ohio! We took two small children with us and they were welcomed and it was a friendly atmosphere for them."}
{"text":"Best shrimp and grits I've ever eaten. Amazing food all the way around. CARLEY seriously was the best waitress ever. She was honest, told me what she didn't like and helped make my first ever experience here perfect!"}
{"text":"Jonathan was absolutely awesome! He was a wonderful server and really made us feel at home and comfortable and excited to feed our faces!!! He wads very helpful in helping us decided on what we were in the mood to eat because Tupelo has SOOOO many things...good things to choose from!!! He came to our table with excitement and a smile!!! Love this restaurant and we will request Jonathan the next time we come in! Thanks so much Jonathan!"}
{"text":"Tupelo Honey Cafe is by far my favorite place to eat in Charlotte. Not only is the food creative and consistently delicious, but the service is impeccable as well. From the Charleston chicken sandwich, to the shrimp and grits, to vegetarian options, there truly is something for everyone. I always leave happy and impressed by the staff and the food. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"William did an amazing job and the food was great. The French toast was superb! Everyone at our table loved their dishes. William was funny and we enjoyed having him take care of us for our last brunch together!"}
{"text":"We visited Tupelo Honey after only a week of being open. The staff was incredibly helpful and friendly on a very busy Friday night. It was their first Friday night. We enjoyed a nice bottle of Cabernet at a reasonable price and found a seat in the bar in about 15 minutes. The service was impeccable, the food was somewhere between average and below, yes it was ...we are very sorry to say. We tried the Pimento Cheese dip appetizer which was pretty good but the chips were not. At best the chips were the ones you do not pick up in the grocery. My guy had the meatloaf which was somewhat dry, way over salted. His mac and cheese was just okay. I had the black bean burger, it was fine...not great, not awful. I ordered the greens for a side which tasted as if they had been sauteed in lard, perhaps rancid lard. We will go back for drinks because everyone was so nice, but we are both pretty sure we will not dine there again unless things change. All of this for an easy $80.00 is a little tough to swallow in Dilworth where we have so many other good choices."}
{"text":"Recommended by a local friend, Tupelo Honey Cafe exceeded our expectations! A few of us went for lunch at the end of March, but since then I have constantly been taking about the food and service with my friends and family. I tried the Queen Mary which was a unique drink and very delicious, followed by the Shoo Mercy pancakes, a meal I have bragged about to all my friends. The sweet potato pancakes were on point, the fried chicken breast was very juicy, and the bacon, pecans, powdered sugar, and maple syrup sent me into brunch heaven.

To top things off, our server Lynn was extremely sweet, very energetic, and made great recommendations for us visiting for the first time.  Coming from the food industry myself, there are those servers who are good at their jobs, then there are servers like Lynn who take the dining experience to the next level. Thank you Lynn and hope you treat yourself with a Queen Mary!"}
{"text":"The food was unreal as usual, but Jonathan made it over the top good. Can't recommend this place or this server enough."}
{"text":"We are in town from Omaha for the day.....looked on Yelp.....review looked interesting......never heard of this place.  YOU ARE CRAZY IF YOU DON'T GO HERE!  Cedric and his staff did a great job...I'M TELLING YOU.......CRAZY!

{"text":"Just ate at Tupelo Honey Cafe and food was really great.  I have been to the Raleigh location in the past and visited the Charlotte location this time.  Loved being able to eat outside.  This was my husband's first time at Tupelo and he loved it.  Johnathan was our waiter and he was great.  He was full of energy, attentive, and very knowledgeable.   Will be back!"}
{"text":"Had an incredible meal!  What a fun place to come for breakfast or brunch in Charlotte. A new favorite!

Had a few issues because they were extremely busy, but the management handled the situation well and were only interested in our satisfaction. 

Definitely coming again"}
{"text":"This place is great! Food was wonderful - and William kept the coffee coming!  Great service and kid friendly!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent! A lighter taken on southern food, which is always a plus. I went with a group of 15 and the service was very fast, however the wait staff was not very friendly."}
{"text":"Drove in from Columbia for my daus birthday....we really enjoyed our food! Tasty meal and nice presentation!"}
{"text":"The food and service were incredible! Great atmosphere, really laid back and comfortable. We got the fried chicken with Mac and cheese and the pecan pie. It was delicious!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went for brunch this past Saturday and our experience was less than stellar. We made reservations and since I came to catch up with a friend, we obviously started chatting. Our waiter asked us if we wanted any alcoholic drinks, we declined and his demeanor got odd. 

Our waiter was obviously in a hurry to get us in and out as he stopped by our table three times before we even had a chance to look at a menu. 

We had just sat down and already had the feeling like we needed to leave. Nobody spends $14 on avocado toast to shove it down their throats and leave. 

We also heard about these famous biscuits and jam and we didn't receive any, so of course that was disappointing as well. 

As we were eating and catching up, multiple times our waiter would jump from behind us and say \"HOWS IT GOING!\" like he was trying to be funny and scare us. It was bizarre behavior, happened multiple times, and made me extremely uncomfortable. 

What really takes the cake, though, is at the end he told us to give him a five star review on Yelp so he could win a free meal. I think it's pretty ironic that he ruined our brunch and had the nerve to ask for a five star review. Travesty."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience at Tupelos this past Sunday. The food was delicious and service was fast. I wish I lived a bit closer so I could go more often. Price was most reasonable too! 
I am a big trout lover. My fish was of good size,tender and flavorful. Mashed sweet potato, yummy!  Mimosa mmmm good.  I tries the fried chicken and will definitely get that next time.  Husbands shrimp and grits very flavorful with a bit of a kick. 
Couldn't have asked for a better experience all around."}
{"text":"So first off, this place is very unique, but in a good way! Me and friend went here for her birthday as we heard great things about this place. We went on a Thursday night and it was crazy packed! So we were like wow ok this place must be great. 

I wanted to try the \"southern popcorn\" of which is the fried okra appetizer. It was a super huge serving and I was excited. If you love fried okra, well you have hit the jackpot because it was good. The biscuits that come out are so good and fluffy! The warm honey and yummy preserves were awesome as well. I killed that biscuit! We both got the southern chicken piccata with jumbo shrimp and lemon cherry pepper cilantro beurre blanc. And OMG the sauce was excellent. I could have eaten another serving of that! The entree was very tasty and had lots of flavor. 

The drinks were very unique and different as well. I had a drink called \"cool as a cucumber\" and it packed a nice lil punch. And my friend had \"blueberry fields forever\" and it was good too. I would definitely try this place out again and taste something different."}
{"text":"The food here was great!  I had the sweet potato pancakes and could not believe how good they were!"}
{"text":"Not a fan of the new lunch/dinner menu, removed breakfast items for lunch. Less gluten-free options. Bring back the breakfast bowls and I'll come back."}
{"text":"I have no idea why THC has 3.5 stars. I'd like to think of this review as 4.5.

Let me preface this with the disclaimer: THC is pretty expensive. There's a lot of reasons why - it's a chain from asheville, they're in south end, etc. But they also serve some pretty amazing food so I'd still consider it worth it.

I've been to THC 3 times, and I consider that enough to be able to rate its consistency. Portion sizes are generous, the biscuits + blueberries are TO DIE FOR, and the menu has a solid mix of old and new. Some notes on tastes for those who are wondering what to order:

* The greens are heavy on the soy, and are kale rather than traditional southern choices like mustard or collards. I enjoyed them but I consider them a poor departure from tradition. Lola's greens are far superior
* The grits use goat cheese. Of course it says this on the menu but if you're used to gouda in your grits keep it in mind. Personally I'm going to put goat in my next batch if I get a chance.
* The nut chicken is supposedly a fan favorite but when their traditional batter is so incredibly fantastic I don't see why you'd do it.
* The meatloaf was recommended to me over the chicken piccata which was a disappointment. Personally I think there could be a lot more here - the mushroom gravy used on other dishes would go MUCH better with it than the watery tomato one they throw on.
* Get the chicken piccata. Seriously. Don't ask, just do it.

Service has been excellent so far. We had one hiccup with an incredibly long serving time for their top-of-the-line margarita. Turns out they were short staffed at the bar and our server had to cut some of the vegetables. Plus it was missing the shrimp it was supposed to have : (

When I get the check I always sigh a little because I have to tip at least 20% on top of a $35+ tab (poor me right?) but then I sign it anyway because THC is a great place to go for high end southern."}
{"text":"Food is good, service is just average. A little pricey. Every time we have gone we made a reservation but still had to wait for a table. What is the point of a reservation if I am still going to have to wait?"}
{"text":"I love the ambiance in this place. The hardwood floors and eclectic decor make it so cozy and comfortable. The menu is creative and everything I've had is really tasty. The manager is very friendly and comes around to check on people. He is very knowledgable and accommodating. This would be a great brunch spot. We've gone for lunch only so far, but will be back."}
{"text":"I've tried this restaurant a few times with friends and it is so disappointing every time. I'm no longer interested in giving them a shot. The food is sub-par at best and the prices are too high. 

Case in point, I ordered pancakes and I don't know how it's possible to mess up a pancake, but they were able to do just that. Who serves a pancake with cayenne pepper all over it and doesn't warn a customer who orders it?! Food allergies, anyone?! That's just not smart. It was beyond gross as well. They never even offered to replace the pancakes or bring anything else as a substitute. When I asked for a small biscuit, they told me, \"they wouldn't charge me this time.\" Is that a threat?! Please.... Go back to Asheville. You can keep this place. I'm not sure Charlotte wants to embrace you and I can tell you that I surely won't."}
{"text":"Get. The. Biscuits. Pour honey on your plate. Dip biscuits in honey. Enjoy. You're welcome! Also love the fried chicken - certainly appropriate for 2 to share."}
{"text":"Our server William at Tupelo honey in Charlotte was great! Super friendly, great recommendations, and amazing food. It's one of my favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"Great southern fare, delicious cocktails, fun environment. If they don't bring you biscuits when you sit down (breakfast lunch or dinner), ask for them! and for warm honey and blackberry jam. to DIE for! Also the popcorn okra and that magic sauce for an appetizer. Soo glad this place made it's way to the queen city!"}
{"text":"Hah!  Like Giannabrie, I too kinda drink the THC Kool Aid and have been salivating for the restaurant to open since the Charlotte location annoucement was made a few months ago.  Let's just say if you're a fan of the Asheville location, this location IS different, but won't disappoint.  

The food is very similar, and I believe consistent to what you find at the original.  (Pillowy biscuits and blueberry jam packed with whole fruit...those famous sweet potato pancakes the size of your head with crunchy pecans...oh yeah!) 

What won me over were the servers and bar staff who knew exactly what each menu item included and weren't afraid to make recommendations. The staff is very friendly and even with a packed house on two occasions, we still felt attended to, and our needs met.  (Once, I was on a time crunch of an hour, and despite a completely full bar area, our server made sure our food came out quickly, and our bill taken care off within that 60 minute window.) 

Note:  No reservations taken under I believe it is 6 or 8 people.  Their first week they also didn't accept phone carry-out orders...you had to go in and order in person, and wait at the restaurant.  That was a bit irritating.

Note 2: Parking can be tricky during peak hours, (Liberty is in the same plaza, along with other businesses) so plan accordingly. 

Bottom Line:  If you're a fan of the other locations...and enjoy their style of Southern cuisine, put this on your list.  It's a great go-to for Breakfast, lunch or dinner. I also think it's a good place to take out-of-town guests for a real taste of the Carolinas."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,Great Service and very good food. One of my favorite spots! The Okra obsession was awesome!"}
{"text":"My cousin and I were driving down the street looking for a place to eat before we both perished from hunger.  We pulled into the lot and went into the place across the street.  We kept looking to see where all the fun we were hearing was coming from and behold it was across the street.  We changed venues and ordered at THC. The food was great and the service amazing.  I loved it, she loved it and we both ate entirely too much.  The lemonade was fantastic!"}
{"text":"LAWD have Mercy those Shoo Mercy Shrimp and Grits are SOOOOOOO GOOD! The combo is so appealing to the palate!
I had that dish Sunday and came back on Tuesday for the Sautéed Shrimp! Everything was awesome and our servers Amber (Sunday) and Cesar (Tuesday) were attentive along with the various other servers and hostesses. The biscuits with the blueberry jam/ compote with the honey was also great. Next time I'm in the area I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great food/atmosphere - fried okra is my fave
Lunch/Dinner is great, Brunch selection is more limited

Does not take reservations for groups less than 8 people which is annoying
Usually has a very long wait & bar is always packed"}
{"text":"I was excited to go since I love the Asheville store but just did not have the same eclectic feel. Which I really wouldn't have thought too much about if the food was great. But it wasn't. I ordered a basic breakfast since I wasn't too hungry but just got a plate of sodium. I ordered eggs with bacon and grits. Instead I got potatoes which was ok but then the potatoes were very salty. Then my eggs were very salty and had equal amounts of black pepper. Plus bacon is salty. So I think I met my max of salt for the week. I'll go back back it won't be my go-to."}
{"text":"The concept and atmosphere was nice but they totally missed the mark on culinary execution. I ordered the strawberry shortcake dessert which was basically a biscuit with strawberries and plain yogurt. the brussel sprouts were ok, but i've had way better. The flavors of the sweet potato pancake were a bit overpowering and the piece of chicken that came with it was on the small side. The lavender limeaide was good though hardly lavender, and the bacon was good. Def disappointed."}
{"text":"As a vegan, it's sometimes difficult to find a good restaurant that caters to vegans as well.  The tofu hot wings are absolutely delicious! The black bean burger, however, is bland.  It's served without any type of sauce, just pickles lettuce tomato on a crap bun.  I added some wing sauce and yellow mustard to try to liven it up. The sweet potato fries are excellent. Wine selection is nice.  Atmosphere is great on the patio and loud and freezing in the building. Our waitress, Jessie, was a sweetheart.  Would ask for her again if she was on the patio"}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and in search of bottom less mimosas.. this restaurant appears in the results. No bottomless mimosas HOWEVER! This food is amazing. My friends and I sat at the bar and Lauren was amazing! She made stellar drinks, her food recommendations were on point and her service was superb! She was very attentive and kind even when we asked annoying questions! I will go here each and every time I'm in Charlotte and specifically asks her Lauren!"}
{"text":"Come in for brunch. Get here early as the morning goes on the wait time increases and can be pretty packed by Noon on the weekends. The pancakes are great. I also have tried the omelets which I found very greasy, I believe because of the caramelized onions  had a lot of excess oil. Tip, to the left is the bar area and you may be able to grab a seat quickly if you come during busy hours."}
{"text":"Today was our first time visiting tupelo.  We had brunch.

I really wanted to like this place, especially given the 40min wait.  

Pros: biscuits served with fresh jam, and the mega mimosas were fabulous.  Our server, Carrie was kind, too.

Cons: hair in food.  I ordered the smoked salmon with goat cheese grits.  The grits were actually a fried grit cake/patty, which was cool - until I cut into it.  After the second bite, I unfortunately found two long black hairs (not mine) tangled in the grit cake.

Server was apologetic, and brought out a different dish within minutes. My second meal was the chicken and biscuits.  It was tasty, but I had pretty much lost my appetite by then.

This place has potential. Perhaps the kitchen staff needs a refresher course on health, safety and sanitation policies."}
{"text":"The 
Mac & Cheese alone is one of their better dishes, adding shrimp is icing on the cake. Had this dish with steamed chopped greens ooooh lala!"}
{"text":"We were craving Cracker Barrel, but the closest one is by the airport and last time we went to that location my wife broke one of the rocking chairs. We looked for a similar option, and thought of Tupelo Honey. We had heard great things about their brunch, but it was already 8:00 pm so we decided to go for dinner instead.  Parking was available but not convenient, and when we realized we had to climb stairs we almost just walked to Nan and Byrons. Nonetheless, we ended up sticking with the original plan and before we knew it the two of us were sitting at a table with four chairs (all of the booths were occupied). 

Did our waitress know the menu? Yes.  Could she pair drinks with dishes? Yes, but only because the menu did it for her. I looked at the beer menu, and nothing really caught my attention, so I asked for a tap water, lite on the ice with an orange slice. My wife asked for the same, and the waitress was back momentarily with two waters, each containing 3 ice cubes and an orange slice and a plate of biscuits with a delicious honey spread.  

Took a glance at the appetizers, and nothing was appealing.  We love fried red tomatoes, and order them whenever we can.  However, we DO NOT eat tomatoes before they are ripe. That ruled out the fried green tomatoes.  The Appalachian Shrimp were tempting, but we decided against them as we had never tried fresh water shrimp before. We asked the waitress for her recommended entrees, and she described the Carolina Mountain Trout.  We had been eyeing this item before, but her description made it sound TERRIBLE.  We almost left, but it was already 8:40 and Nan and Byrons seemed like quite the hike.  After another quick glance at the menu, I ordered two Fried Chicken and Biscuits plates before the waitress could ruin them for us.  We already knew we liked the restaurant's biscuits, and we figured its pretty difficult to mess up fried chicken.  We were right! The chicken was very above average, as was the gravy that accompanied it.  There were ups and downs during our visit to Tupelo Honey, but chicken and biscuits were delectable."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch!  Lots of different traditional brunch items with a different spin on them.  The Eggs Betty and goat cheese grits hit the spot, along with the bloody.  Service was slightly slow, but not too bad!"}
{"text":"The location is in Charlottes more recent trendy section and is reminiscent of the old south. The menu is what I'd call new south eclectic. I have no complaints and am sure we'll return soon. All in all a very nice experience with great food."}
{"text":"Ummm... so this place is my jam! I first encountered Tupelo at their original spot in downtown Asheville. I could tell you what all is good with detail, but honestly everything I have ever had here is flippin' fantastic. I'm talking waddling out the door with a food baby good. I've taken a couple groups of folks here and they have all thoroughly enjoyed it as well. This could be a great place to introduce out-of-towners to southern cuisine being that it has some classics along with some modern interpretations. Tupelo is a local spot and honors seasonal foods which means the menu is always changing and the food is always fresh.

In Essence:
+ Amazing food! (local, fresh, seasonal)
+ Fun cozy atmosphere
+ Friendly Staff
+ Great pricing
+ Group friendly/Good for visitors
-Parking challenges at times, but at least it's free."}
{"text":"Seriously overhyped, the food seriously isn't what everyone is rating. Maybe it was just the dinner entrees, haven't tried breakfast yet. The only good thing worth going back for are those biscuits and the blueberry jam"}
{"text":"I was midly disappointed when I learned brunch was served all day with the exception of any poached eggs including the eggs benedict!! Overall, there is a lot of variety to pick from and the portions are huge (or maybe I've lived in NY too long and they are normal?).  Good value, although nothing really blew my mind in terms of taste.  Service is a little slow but very friendly.  Would like to come back to try the full breakfast offerings!"}
{"text":"Delicious dinners and awesome service.  Emma was our server and she knows her menu.  Every recommendation was spot on.  Our faves: fried chicken, pork shoulder steak, crispy brussels, potato crackling and banana pudding were the best!!  Great meal, the best server and family for company.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Visited previously and will be joining again next week, love the authenticity of their food, the quality and the service. Highly recommended for those that eat healthy and love to dine out."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite for Eggs Benedict in Charlotte!  Bloody Mary is yummy and biscuits are to die for!  However, for me the table situation brought it down 1 star because getting a table can be painful.  The bar area is 1st come/1st serve which can get ugly and annoying to those that are seated and being stalked by the hungry.  But, food is so good!"}
{"text":"This Yankee really loved this place. Led here by Yelp reviews and a desire for southern cuisine, we were very happy with the choice. Fried green tomatoes, shrimp and grits, pimento cheese, great beer selection - can't wait to move down here so we can come back. Yum!"}
{"text":"It tries really hard to get us to like it.  I mean, yeah, it's good and all, but the bottom line is that is a pseudo-upscale diner.  It's slightly pricey for what it is.  

Bottom line: three stars means it's decent.  I'll go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I were able to sneak away for lunch and we're so disappointed in our visit to Tupelo Honey. Our waitress was very nice and brought us drinks and took our order right away. 

We ordered Brussel Sprouts, my husband ordered the Chicken Salad and I had the avocado toast and eggs.

Our entrees took at least 30 minutes to come out and we were just sitting there - the manager said the kitchen was backed up but he did hurry in to get them for us as we had to get back to work.

Unfortunately my avocado was not at all ripe - I couldn't even cut through it. At this point we had to go but they did offer to bring me another plate - the next attempt was a bit better but still had some super hard chunks. If the kitchen doesn't have any ripe avocados, they should probably take the avocado toast off the menu for the day. 

There was no offer to comp food or make up for the delays or entree issues.

We had to hurry out and unfortunately don't know that we'll return."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, and usually have good service, however today my husband and I made the mistake of sitting in the bar because our table near the door was too cold. The service was so slow we finally asked for our food be changed to a to-go order. The biscuits and jam were delicious. So, yes, you should visit  Tupelo Honey. Just bring a coat if it's cold and sit in the dining room not the bar."}
{"text":"We've lived in Charlotte for almost three years & we FINALLY found Our Place. The okra is just like Mom's but better. The fried chicken was steak-tender. The shrimp & grits are by far my husband's favorite. Rachael, our kind barkeep & waitress, was a great guide to what was good & her favorites on the menu. Thank you, Rachael - job well done! Oh, and the banana pudding...yeah...you'll lick the spoon & the enamel off the bowl if no one is looking!"}
{"text":"We're fans of the Asheville location and were thrilled when Tupelo Honey came to Charlotte!  It did not disappoint.  The hostesses were great and greeted us with a smile, even though the wait was long (Saturday at lunch took about 40-45 minutes for our table of 4  to be seated.  Which we expected, it just opened!)
Lunch was fabulous.  I love their kids' menu--their philosophy is that kids can eat the same offerings as the grown-up menu, and my four year old had fried okra, sweet potato fries, and honey glazed fruit salad.  Maybe not the healthiest, but better than processed nuggets and greasy fries!
The rest of us loved it.  The open-faced Mamie's veggie sandwich was good, my husband enjoyed the Shoo grilled cheese, and my oldest girl loved her chicken and biscuits--With a side of Brussels sprouts because you always need something green!  We finished off the meal with a Cheerwine float and banana pudding.  This was a real treat, and I can't wait to go with friends!
(They do have an elevator for those that need it, but we just took the stairs.)"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. 

Came early Saturday evening, around 5:30, and it was packed.  Wait for a table for 2 was 45 mins. You can't make reservations despite what their (infuriating and confusing) automated answering machine said.

Ok, no problem.  I'm willing to wait for good food and to try a new place.  Luckily, we snagged two seats at the bar within 10 mins.  It was all downhill from here...

Cocktails were awful.  They don't carry Tito's, so I went with a Stoli (up with a twist).  Not good.  The perfect vodka martini should be ice cold with shards of ice crystals and citrus oils.  Mine was cold-ish... and had a thick awkward corkscrew of rind balanced on the rim.  Whatever.  We moved on to the specialty \"cockytails.\"  DIABETES. seriously. we tried the blueberry skinny tea and cool as a cucumber and they both tasted like sugar water.  The one/only good thing was the jalapeno bacon moonshine.  We took shots of that and I would recommend.  Very jalapeno-y and bacon-y and... yah, first time I've had a savory shot and I liked it.

Food was mediocre to awful.  We were about to order the fried okra when the people next to us said it was bad.  My friend tried some of the neighbor's  -- mushy and bland and gross.  Biscuit was undercooked and unimpressive. Appalachian egg rolls were dripping with oil, yet not crispy (I imagine the oil wasn't hot enough), and just meh.  Shrimp and grits were fine... but nothing special.  The fried egg and bacon sandwich with home fries were also fine... but it was no different from what I could have made in 5 mins. on any given weekend morning.

Service was obviously lacking because the place was slammed and we were at the bar.  Let's go with \"N/A\" here.

We opted to skip dessert.  I just don't get how there's so much hype surrounding this place.  

TL;DR -- Wait for table is long; cocktails will give you diabetes; food is mediocre."}
{"text":"I wanted to be a fan of Tupelo Honey... firstly as a good replacement to the Pewter Rose and for the great reputation that Tupelo has in Asheville. Instead, I was left wanting more. 

In my books, Tupelo is more of a 3.5 than a 4, but not a 3. Bottom line is they have staff issues. It almost feels to me that they were not properly trained to meet the demand of being the new kid on the block with high expectations. They did a great job of building excitement on Facebook and I think Charlotte residents were hoping for another great brunch spot on Sunday afternoons. 

Here are my issues from a customer point of interaction: 

Parking - always has and continues to be a challenge at this location. Not much can be done here. 

Customer Service - warm greeting when entering... and we were lucky enough to be seated relatively quickly. 

Wait Staff - friendly, but a little forgetful with long periods of time between receiving food and receiving service. 

Food - Food is good. I expected more in terms of flavor. It wasn't bad and it wasn't great... but not memorable. 

I want to love you Tupelo... I want to be a fan, but adjustments have to be made in order for me to become a returning customer and one that recommends you. 

I'll be giving you a try in Asheville soon!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here late afternoon on a Monday.  We have been wanting to try the pace but the fact that dogs are allowed made the decision easy to make. 
Our server,  Dylan, was the best.  He had great recommendations for all aspects of the menu including cocktails. He explained that the establishment is farm to fork including non-hormone or genetically enjeneered foods and that all of the food is made onsite. 
Everything we had was outstanding; the bloody mary, the Margarita,  the complimentary biscuits and our entrées.  Yum. 
Thanks Dylan for making it a great meal experience! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Food: Their sweet potato pancake is everything other reviewers have said and more. Thick but fluffy, and decadent and delicious. Just be prepared to eat something twice the size of your head. Topped with nuts and whipped cream (or was it butter?) the pancakes are a perfect blend of sweet and spice - hint of cinnamon. The fried buttermilk chicken was good, but really, the pancakes were the star of the show. I don't remember anything else we ate. 

Service: regular, friendly, and polite. 

Environment: went for Sat brunch on a sunny day, and everyone, from the staff to the families and groups of friends, were happy. The space is airy and light, with tall windows and high ceilings. It's a large space, so the acoustics can work against conversation - it's kind of loud there."}
{"text":"Very very good meal. The salmon was cooked perfect. Tierra was the best bartender/ waitress. She was the best!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here today and I've never posted a review but this place was just too amazing not to review. The food is truly a treat- however what really made our experience was the service. Jonathan was our server and made two Chicagoans not feel so lost when we had no idea what to order. We had never had grits and he brought us a tiny sample so we could feel good about what we were ordering and made us feel so comfortable. He was attentive on a morning where we had to wait an hour and just completely made our experience. He is the reason people should be servers and any place would be lucky to have him. We had to wait an hour that morning for our table and it was an hour well spent. Well worth the wait."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there last night for our 17th anniversary. For $18 I was looking forward to the buttermilk chicken and it was AWFUL  wasn't no flavor and it wasn't crispy at all. For $18 you get a chicken breast and two sides and I was expecting a lot more for that price. I must admit the fries and macaroni and cheese was great and that's about it.  Too much hype for that place."}
{"text":"Good place for dinner.
Their chicken and salmon dishes were very good though some of the side items tend to be extremely salty.  So ask before ordering if you are sensitive to sodium. 
We also like the warm biscuits and honey they provide with the order. 
Also a good place for doing happy hour at their bar. Good selection of cocktails.
Price wise a little higher but no too far of the mark. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"When I first got there the staff was very helpful and friendly we did have to wait but it was worth it I got the Fried Chicken and Biscuits it was a great portion but it was amazing chicken I do think the basil died it down just a bit but still good The lemonade had rosemary in it I felt like it was too strong I wouldn't get it again but I would go there again"}
{"text":"Been to this place a few times. I usually get the saltimbocca or one of their chicken dishes. Biscuits are ok, but I prefer the ones in the Knoxville restaurant."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch. The sweet potato pancake was great, but not worth the wait. I liked that they had biscuits when you sit down."}
{"text":"Good, dependable Southern cooking.   I would give this place more stars but the wait is always an issue. I went on a Saturday night and it was an hour and a half wait.  Best to plan ahead and make a reservation.  

The biscuits are out of this world! I think they're the best I've ever had! Fried okra is a favorite and it does not disappoint here!  Love the fried green tomatoes and all the \"sides!\"  

They have a new appetizer...fried avocado. It is great but portion is skimpy. You cannot share that."}
{"text":"Great brunch!! If you're able to get a reservation, take advantage! 

Their menu is vast and their cocktails are so good.. and very strong! 

Love Tupelo Honey! The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is the wait."}
{"text":"wah wah. It was ok, not incredible. Next time we'll walk a little further to Nan and Bryon's."}
{"text":"I am from Asheville and am very familiar with the original location. I am pleasantly surprised and eager to say the Charlotte location is up to par! Of course, this is a different experience but great nonetheless! 

service - excellent! we were attended to right away with frequent service, friendliness and attention to detail.

drinks - delicious! cocktails were tasty all around. 

food - biscuits are smaller than in Asheville but had their own buttery flavored goodness. Appetizer of fried okra was awesome and I recommended the Brussels sprouts as a side to any sandwich. 

It was crowded and busy which is a good sign in my book! I am craving some breakfast right now."}
{"text":"Yesterday I had the pleasure of having lunch here which is one of my favorite spots! The weather was great as we sat outside and the food was exceptionally great! Our server Melissa was extremely helpful and made great recommendations. I ordered my favorite; the spinach, mushroom, havarti melt which was delicious as always! I love Tupelo Honey and its truly a Charlotte gem!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday at 1:00 for lunch. It was very crowded, but we (party of 2) were seated quickly. The ambiance was a lot louder than I would like, definitely not the place for a quiet lunch. We ordered food shortly after being seated - and 45 minutes later - our food arrived. The food was nothing above average, and not what I expected for the price. We did not complain about the wait, however the manager came over and removed the meals from our bill. Even with that nice gesture, I would not return."}
{"text":"I'm always searching for new breakfast spots on the weekend, and went there per a friend's suggestion.  When arriving, I was excited to see complimentary valet - but upon pulling up to the station, the attendant just stared at us.  Didn't move.  After enduring a strange staring contest, and no service, we proceeded to park ourselves.  

Upon walking in, I knew immediately this was a 5-star place.  The interior was awesome and I love the little bee paintings and artwork.  We were seated pretty straightaway, and that's when my mental star-rating went down.  

- They don't have espresso; it's my belief that if you're going to be a breakfast spot, you should have this all-important a.m. beverage.
- We told the server that one of us had an egg allergy.  He takes our order, puts it in, and as the order is being delivered informed us that it had eggs.  Uhm... shouldn't you have told us that when we ordered?  He takes the plate back to the kitchen, then brings it back saying that it didn't have eggs.  Seriously?!  Get it together.  
- The wait time for the food was ridiculous.  The place was only half filled, and we had a screaming toddler.  The appetizer biscuits didn't come to our table for 40 minutes, and the actual food (only two plates) arrived in 85 minutes.
- The menu options are nice, but really limited.  If you do have an egg allergy, there are no real alternatives.  And if you're not into omelets, fried chicken or shrimp and grits, there are no other viable options - so if you're plain like me, you're SOL.

I left leaving a bit disappointed because I arrived so excited and full of hope.  From the lazy valet, the incompetent server, the long food waiting period, and lack of menu options, I'm sad to say that we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had read reviews and gathered that the food was great but the service left room for improvement..... Well they must have taken the comments to heart as we had fast and friendly service!! 

The food was also really good, but calorie laden.... If that bothers you. I had their grilled cheese and it was delicious but I must be honest and say although the food is delicious, it is a bit yuppy like.

I would go back though to try some of the other dishes as it was hard to decide on one of the many interesting offerings!!"}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times and always have a good meal. Last time I went I had the Charleston Chicken sandwich and it was delicious. I've had the nutty fried chicken a few times too and that is really good. My husband loves the shrimps and grits. Of course, the biscuits are delicious, too, nice and fluffy and I love the blueberry jam they serve with it. I don't think you can go wrong here, just go hungry!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I had the fried chicken and shrimp & grits. Both were great! I love the culture and love for sustainable resources to make their unique dishes. Try the breaded mac & cheese and the apple cider collards with your fried chicken supper plate. Oh, and ask for Dylan to be your server!"}
{"text":"Wait for table: This is the second time I have attempted to go here for Sunday brunch. The first time there was an 1 1/2 hour wait and people were standing all over the place waiting on a table. I left!! The second time, I waited 45 mins. Normally they have free coffee for people who are waiting but today they decided to NOT refill the coffee. 

Service: First of all, the service is horrible!!! Once we sat down, the waiter tried to take our order before we could read the menu. We order coffee/water then asked to look at the menu. He came back with just the coffee, took our order, and never came back for 20 mins. We sat there with empty coffee cups until we called over the manager to get a refill and find out about our food. 

Food: We ordered the crab scrabble and the sweet potato pancakes which were both cold once we got them. The food tasted fine but I could have made a better brunch at home. I was surprised because I really loved Tupelo Honey in Asheville. 

In my opinion, I probably would not return here for Sunday brunch. I would just go around the corner to Crispy Crepe or 300East...they both have good service and brunch!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great experience here today with my wife. Even though they were super packed for Easter the food was amazing as always. The Service could not have been better. Jonathan was punctual, funny, and always had a smile on his face. He also had great menu suggestions when asked. The fried chicken is great but our favorite thing was the southern egg rolls. Cheers and thanks for the experience."}
{"text":"Delicious biscuits with jalapeño jelly, bacon, and whipped cream. Seriously, so gooood. Staff was curious and helpful. I visited for a Yelp event and was pleasantly surprised at the new brunch foods that we sampled. I will be returning for a full brunch."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte. If you can, sit at the bar when Mel is there. Makes fantastic drinks, very attentive, and very personable. My favorite dish has to be the Shoo Grilled Cheese with the tomato soup. The Appalachian Egg Rolls are by far one of my favorite apps in the city. Been to the Asheville downtown location, but the service and location here in the Queen City takes the cake...or the pecan pie...whatever you're into!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Charlotte for the weekend and met up with 4 friends. One of them recommended Tupelo so we all met there for brunch. The biscuits were amazing. I could have eaten a plate of those and left happy. The drinks were delicious and the decor is really fun. Our waiter, William, was really fun. He was attentive even though the place was packed. We can't wait to come back again."}
{"text":"I went here in March 2016 and it was excellent.  I returned in April 2017 and it wasn't very good.  The menu had changed and they were boasting a new chef, but I wasn't impressed.  Also, even though we went at 2PM on a Saturday, we could only order from the brunch menu which I found odd.  They apparently don't start serving from their full menu until dinner on the weekends, and I just don't want eggs in the afternoon.  The service was OK, but I had to keep asking for my tea to get refilled even though she was refilling everyone else's drinks at my table, so that was kind of weird."}
{"text":"Sorry but this is not southern cooking.  This is NY or LA's idea of southern. Expensive, uncomfortable, and staff with an attitude.  Enjoy the trendiness, but save your taste buds for something else."}
{"text":"Let me just say the general manager was a delight to interact with; I BELIVE his name was Cedric Castro. There was some mix ups with the food in our party but he took care of everything plus some. From the wings, to the shrimp, to the greens, fish, mac n cheese, and the biscuits man oh man it was really good. 

Now as I talk about this next dish I might cry; now I never ever eat Banana Pudding but we had a choice between that and pecan pie as our free desert curiosity of Mr. Castro. At first I ordered the Pecan Pie because like I said I do not eat Banana Pudding but as the desert came out and my sister got Banana Pudding I decided to taste hers. OMG IT WAS SO DEVINE THAT I ASKED TO SWITCH OUT MY DESERT. Omg this is by far THEE BEST BANANA PUDDING EVERRRRR. It was cold and everything had a little bit of everything in ever layer. I want more NOW.........
Please do not leave this place without trying the BANANA PUDDING. I will be back very very soon...."}
{"text":"We had shrimp and grits, apple cider glazed salmon, fried Brussels sprouts, fried avocado, and banana pudding for dessert. All superb..plus the biscuits and jam are to die for. I would've given it 5 stars, but our waitress did not seem like she wanted to be there at all. Maybe she was just having a bad night...."}
{"text":"Geez this place is so good! Went here this past Saturday to experience the amazingness of Tupelo Honey. We have been to the Asheville location many times and couldn't wait to try it out.

We walked here from our apartment.....yes, lucky us! So, I can't comment on the ease of parking but the parking lot looked extremely full when we left.

We arrived around 5:45 and was told that it was a 30 minute wait. I saw an empty table in the bar area and asked the hostess if the bar area was first come first serve. It was, so we sat there. Just a warning, the bar area fills up super fast (especially now that it is cold outside and no one wants to wait out doors). So, if you want a quiet, non-crowding meal, you may just wanna wait for a table. 

Drinks- We both ordered the Tupelo Honey Rye Ale. It was delicious and decently priced. Their craft brew selections were pretty good, especially those within the state.

Biscuits- The biscuits are like a slice of heaven! The come with a thng of blackberry jam and some of their honey (of course!) I split mine in half so I could have one half with jam and one half with honey....best of both worlds!

Food- I ordered the grilled cheese (pimento and havarti) with a cup of tomato soup and my husband ordered the fried chicken with a mushroom sauce and mashed cauliflower. Both meals were very good. Some of the best pimento cheese I have ever had! The tomato soup is a little on the sweeter side. My husbands chicken was the winner though, soooooo tasty. The cauliflower side was a little off....I don't know, maybe not enough cheese or something. But the chicken, man that chicken!

All in all, we will absolutely return. Just come super early or at weird times to avoid a wait because, yes, there will 100% be a good wait there."}
{"text":"Taking the Lynx to downtown Charlotte, I spotted the yellow sign at the East/West Blvd Station through the trees. While Van Morrison's song title got me in the door for lunch, I didn't expect anything other than standard Southern fried fare. This standard often translates into too much of everything: too much butter, too much grease, heaping portions. For an expat Southerner now living on the West Coast, this oversizing isn't necessarily a good thing. 

Surprise! This place got it right. 

I was served a bit buttery biscuit as an appetizer that came with blackberry jam and tupelo honey, but I could actually taste the fruit instead of just sugary jelly. I opted for the veggie plate. The black eyed peas had a nice kick and weren't just boiled bland mush, the brussels sprouts were tender, and the highlight--the fried okra was lightly breaded, allowing the full taste to come through. This is how veggies should be prepared and Tupelo Honey Cafe proves not just my Grandma can do it! 

They even have a Gluten Free Menu. 

Forget Paula's place further down, bring your out-of-town guests here!"}
{"text":"Good service, DELICIOUS biscuits and jam with every meal, entrees were all awesome, fair prices, good vibe....deserves the hype!"}
{"text":"Simply not as good as the Asheville location. Food doesn't seem to be made with the same kind of love. I've been to this location several times and on more than one occasion they've gotten our food wrong. Service isn't as warm, either."}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting Tupelo Honey and I couldn't be more pleased!  William, our server, was funny and very attentive.   He added to our entire experience.   The food was delicious and the service was exceptional!   I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Always good food here! Great southern comfort food at its finest!"}
{"text":"We ordered fried green tomatoes and pimento cheese nachos off the HH menu. Our table was a fan of the nachos. I had the shrimp and grits for my entree. The dish definitely had some bold flavors. I enjoyed the shrimp, but the goat cheese in the grits was a little too overpowering for me. One of my favorite items of the night was, surprisingly, my mom's side of potato cracklins. I've had a lot of potatoes in my lifetime, but I've never seen them cooked quite that way before and they were delicious. Would I come again? Probably not, but it's worth trying once."}
{"text":"Love this place for breakfast. The 4 stars instead of 5 are because they are a bit pricey. Good food just expensive for the simplicity of the dishes they create."}
{"text":"We have always had a great meal here!  Mel, our bartender raises the bar for every other bartender. She makes killer drinks of course but more importantly she is so personable and knowledgeable about the menu and the area that we enjoyed our time with her so much that we always come back!!  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and they are always busy.  Needless to say I expected to wait and when I was told it was 45 minutes I was OK with that.  Well, 45 minutes came and when I asked they said not yet.  Then I asked at 60 minutes and they said not yet.  Then at 1 hour 15 minutes I asked and they said that they had called us 30 minutes ago and when we didn't come up they crossed us off the list.  When I told the hostess that we had been sitting 10 feet away the whole time and I had asked twice she had the nerve to tell me I was lying.  NEVER AGAIN.  We left without eating and I will never go back or recommend this over hyped place again.  Better options with way better service."}
{"text":"What an amazing lunch. We are visiting Charlotte UPTOWN on the rail for the first time from Buffalo NY. We ordered the fried green tomatoes, the fried chicken with Brussels and fries, along with When's great recommendation for the apple and thahini dip. She was the most pleasant and on top of it waitress we've had in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious brunch. And just went there for lunch and hit the southern belle grilled cheese. I don't know how a grilled cheese could be that delicious but it was the best. And the service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"This places has excellent food and service. The fried chicken and biscuits are delicious. I recommend trying this place however for brunch it tends to get crowded so be prepared to wait"}
{"text":"Used to be great - The last 3 times I've been, the food has been pretty bad.  The last one was brunch, and I've had better eggs at McDonalds.  It was disgusting and all they did was comp an $8, cold, soggy avocado toast. Not going back and not recommending it to my customers. I work at the Charlotte airport and have recommended this restaurant to hundreds. I won't do it again."}
{"text":"Very good quality food but just a bit on the pricey side - great service"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant with great service and food! Loved the biscuits and blueberry spread. I tried the pimiento & fried pickle burger and also the pulled pork grilled cheese. Both were great. Fries were \"boring regular old soggy fries, would love to see sweet potato fries on the menu!"}
{"text":"We have always loved going here.  It was disappointing from the start.  Our waitress suggested the TH Rye Ale, then said they were out of it, they had it, but not really.  She offered us happy hour specials, but then it was \"just kidding\", it's Friday.  The biscuits were just different, not soft and melt in your mouth.  The fried chicken definitely tasted different too.  Everything was just so-so, not amazing like we were accustomed to.  We did see a sign about a new chef and new menu, so maybe that's to blame."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us to the South End neighborhood of Charlotte to Tupelo Honey Café which is located on the second floor in a renovated historic building near Charlotte's light rail. The interior is a mix of industrial and rustic with lots of wood, exposed brick walls, and high ceilings.

Dora here. Don't you just love the interior? This is my kinda place. Parking around noon on Saturday was non-existent in the lot behind the restaurant, but no worries. There's free on-street parking on the other side of the light rail. Also, the 35-minute wait only ended up being 15 minutes. Another score!

Rather than table bread, Tupelo serves scratch-made biscuits with blueberry jam. These biscuits were great, crispy and buttery and warm, and the blueberry jam was the perfect pairing. We would have preferred to eat ours prior to the meal, but with a packed dining room, they came out with our meal. Dora here. I don't care what time they got to the table. I could've stuffed myself with these biscuits! The food did seem to take awhile, but service was very attentive and gracious.

I chose the Tupelo Farm Fresh Burger with cheddar cheese, lettuce, house-made pickles and a secret sauce along with fried okra and tomatoes. The burger was outstanding, grilled perfectly, tasty, and the secret sauce brought it all together. The okra and tomatoes were fresh, lightly battered with just the right amount of crunch. 

Dora here. So many choices! But I finally decided on the Charleston Chicken Sandwich, a marinated grilled chicken breast with lettuce, Havarti cheese on sourdough wheat bread with a side of mac-n-cheese. Doesn't that sound great? The chicken was oh-so-tender and juicy, and I really liked the cranberry flavored mayo. First time eating sourdough wheat bread, and I liked it. The mac-n-cheese was creamy with just the right amount of firmness and kick. 

I would rate this restaurant 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food. Definitely worth a return visit!

{"text":"Tupelo Honey Cafe lives up to its hype.  My girl friend and I arrived on a weekday early evening and had no problems getting a seat.  Apparently this place is hot as a brunch spot.  Plenty of space inside, though outside was packed since it was nice out.  This place serves up some serious Southern fare.  Service was very nice and we were attended to most of the evening.  Don't come here if you're looking for anything close to healthy, by the way.

Fried Green Tomatoes - deliciously crispy on the outside and slightly tangy (as it should be) on the inside.  Served over their signature goat cheese grits.  Delicious - a must get!

Crispy lemon brussel sprouts - if anything, I would pass on these.  Very fried and not enough lemon flavor, or any flavor at all, really.  Not good if you hate brussel sprouts.

Baked mac and cheese - legit mac and cheese.  What more can I say?  Good ratio of cheese to macaroni.

Tupelo shrimp and grips (added chorizo) - y'all.  The chorizo does it here.  Absolutely worth the extra $3 as it gives the whole thing even more flavor and kick.  The grits, which are the same as in the fried green tomatoes.  The shrimp are large, juicy, plump, well-seasoned, and oh-so-delicious.  This was our favorite dish of the evening, hands down.  But - you have to add the chorizo!

Shoo mercy pancake - basically fried chicken (breast) and sweet potato pancake.  This thing was massive.  The sweet potato pancake was awesome and went very well with the peach butter and of course, maple syrup.  I don't care for thick cut special bacon... just prefer the normal boring Oscar Mayer stuff, so if this is your jam, you'd love the copious amounts of bacon on here.  The fried chicken breast was juicy and crispy and goes well with hot sauce and honey (trust me). This comes pretty close to the shrimp and grits.

Biscuits with homemade jam and tupelo honey - for some reason they never brought these out til halfway through our meal.  YAAAAAAAAS these are amazing, especially with the tupelo honey (the best!) and homemade berry jam.

Pecan pie - skip.  I've had better elsewhere.  Or maybe we were just too full.

Solid place for good service, great Southern food, and groups (on weekday evenings)."}
{"text":"I had an absolutely marvelous experience at this restaurant. Jonathan our waiter was great!! The food was excellent and the service was even better. What a great Easter Sunday!"}
{"text":"holy cow! The shoo mercy shrimp and grits is sooooooo goooood but sooooo pricey. I believe it was around 26 dollars for just that plate but it makes sense why it's expensive since they use shrimps the size of baseballs!!! (Exaggeration but they're jumbo shrimps) lol. I haven't been here for dinner but brunch here is pretty good. But they recently change the way they make their biscuits and I'm not a fan. Bring back the old biscuit recipe!! !"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about tupelo honey cafe. Their mini biscuits are delicious. I ordered the avocado toast, which is much bigger than I expected, and the granola. The granola is AMAZING. It's topped with a local yogurt and it's the best yogurt I've ever had."}
{"text":"Hands down the best food around! I had the Nutty Chicken with Sweet potatoes & asparagus and it was amazing! I have also had the tomato soup and grilled sandwich and it was delicious!!! Great atmosphere and friendly staff. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Such a disappointment from a place I once really liked.  I remember when Tupelo Honey first opened, and the wait was two hours for a table.  Sadly, I don't think that's the case any longer.

We went for a birthday dinner - reservations for a large party at 7:00 - and were seated promptly.  Our server was friendly and funny, but clearly overworked by having to serve our large party, as well as other nearby tables (perhaps they were short-staffed this particular night??).  That being said, the service was abysmally slow - from drink orders to hot biscuits to the actual dinner to bringing our checks.  The restaurant was not that crowded, but it was clear that the kitchen was slammed - and the managers I observed were spending more time chastising their staff than being helpful (and this was in very plain sight).

My food (burger) was quite good, but I heard several comments from others that their food was just okay.  One guest ordered the roasted beet salad, which, when it arrived, had only about three tiny pieces of  beet in and zero goat cheese.  He very quietly and calmly requested the server take it back and send out the salad as described on the menu.  He got his new salad all right, but he also got a manager with what I perceived as an attitude - questioning him about why he sent it back in a very antagonistic tone.  Not well played, Tupelo Honey, not well played.

We arrived at 7:00 and left at 9:30 - not because we were having so much fun (although we were) but because the service was so very slow - the wait to get our checks and, once we had them, the wait to have them picked up and returned for signatures, was totally ridiculous. 

I think I will only return to Tupelo Honey if someone I particularly care for insists that no other place will do - and, even then, I will try to change their minds!"}
{"text":"This place makes my heart happy because brunching here is perfect. Expect to wait, but they have plenty of seats on their outside porch so it's hardly a bother. 

When you get seated, you get warm southerner biscuits with blueberry jam  

The menu has about a thousand and one amazing things you have to try. I had eggs, Brussels, and Mac n cheese. Unfortunately the Brussels were a disappointment. Brussels are my favorite thing in the world but even I can cook them better than that. The mac n cheese though .. That was heavenly. Cooked to perfection. My eggs came out cold which was a bit of a bummer but we're still yummy. 

Everything from the burgers to waffles looked amazing as it came out of the kitchen. Definitely want to go back and try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"We dined here for lunch today and we both ordered the buttermilk chicken with mac and cheese with the greens at the recommendation of the server. The menu was completely different from when I had been before, so that was unexpected. We got our chicken and it was dry. The mac and cheese was the best part of our lunch.  A worker filling water glasses asked how our meals were. My coworker shared how dry the chicken was and we were told that they were having problems with the supplier and not being able to cook it consistently.  With the changes to the menu, we won't be back. I was given a banana pudding to take with me, but the cookies were still crunchy."}
{"text":"I've wanted to visit the Asheville location for years, but never have. Having read a few mixed reviews of the Charlotte location, I wasn't sure what to expect. Overall, I thought this restaurant was great!!!

We were a party of 6 on a Saturday night, and although it was crowded, we were seated within 20 minutes. All of our drinks were great; we had wine, margaritas and other mixed drinks. The drinks were strong enough for the price and well sized.

Everything you read about the biscuits is true: they are AMAZING. Best biscuit I've had in a long time; possibly in forever :)

For entrees we tried the Chicken Piccata w/shrimp, Shrimp and Grits, Grilled Cheese and soup, the Veggie Bowl and the Veggie platter. Portion sizes were great and the food was excellent!! We laughed because there was literally not a single crumb left on any of the six plates. Other than licking them clean, we each ate every last bite!!

For dessert we ordered the banana pudding: it's EXCEPTIONAL!!!! Seriously, between the biscuits, entree and dessert, we left very full!

Best part was the bill; $76 for 2 people including 4 drinks, 2 entrees, dessert and tax. To me, that's a great value in Charlotte!

Thanks for the wonderful night out: we will be back (next time for breakfast) :)"}
{"text":"Best Sunday brunch experience we've had in Charlotte! The large mimosa was splendid- great champagne to OJ ratio, which is one of the most (if not the most) important factors for a great brunch. I had the sweet potato pancakes with fried chicken and it was fantastic- and huge! My husband had the chicken and biscuits and he loved it. We plan on making tupelo our go-to brunch spot!"}
{"text":"I so wanted to love this place...but I dont...
Their biscuit they give you at the beginning is super yummy! but...thats about it. 
We tried eating here two times but probably won't be coming back. First time I had the soup (tomato) and salad. and I did NOT like their tomato soup. Such a disappointment because my fav food to eat is tomato and I almost always try tomato soups at any restaurant that carries it. I just really did not like the soup here. and the salad was meh...My husband had the meatloaf and he thought it was normal (not exceptional but not bad either)

My husband said its not fair to judge a restaurant by their soup and salad ( Yea..hes right. ) so we decided to come try it again. 
This time I had the Sweet potato pancakes and my husband had the Nuttty fried chicken. They were both \"meh\" . 
I don't think we would be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Jonathan gave us the best service ever. Best bloody Mary I've ever had awesome lunch cannot think of where else I'd rather go"}
{"text":"Tuesday, June 9, 2015, a party of approximately 30 adults had reservations at this site for 7pm.  We were seated as planned.  We waited for 5+ minutes before ONE server arrived to take drink orders.  As drink orders were delivered, another server tells one partron, \" I'm the last to know, we are out of the wine you ordered.\"  

ONE server began to take orders and was 1/3 finished, when finally, the server who had made the former comment about a wine, joined to take orders.  When MOST of the meals had been delivered, this same server tells another patron, \"I'm the last to know, we are out of meatloaf.\" Is this the only comment the server knows?  How come the kitchen is not keeping servers informed about supply?

As to the meals.  The cauliflower side was cold and had to be replaced with hot cauliflower side.  The fried green tomatoes were over-breaded and the sauce unremarkable.  The Mac n cheese was awful, as it is seasoned with so much CHERRY pepper sauce, you cannot taste the cheeses.  Most of those who ordered Mac n cheese did not eat it.  The burgers were under-cooked.  Those who had a dish with some form of seafood, seemed to be ok with the outcome.  Most said after leaving, they would not be back.

This is one patron who will never return.  This place lacks both in service and food."}
{"text":"You see that yellow heavily garnished drink in the pictures? That's the queen Mary (Bloody Mary) sounds great on the menu, looks great in the pic, but unfortunately I recommend staying away from it. The food and service are still awesome... Fried egg BLT rocks!"}
{"text":"Been there twice, first with my wife, really good experience. Then when I our friends came to town from Mi. for a visit, this is where we chose to take them. Again excellent experience! Good southern cooking, unique dishes, good friendly service, and when weather is nice outdoor patio seating. Keep up the excellent experience's!"}
{"text":"OMG-worthy, fantastic Southern food!!

Came to Tupelo Honey Cafe for a work team outing & we were immediately impressed with the lovely decor of the place - very industrial yet homey.  Lots of window panes and ceiling fans

Team ordered a bit of everything - the true standouts were the Fried Green Tomatoes - thick tomatoes w/ a crunchy thick breading & all sitting on top of a wonderful layer of goat cheese grits, beet salad was super-yummy w/ huge dollops of goat cheese & lots of candied pecans

Others indulged in brussles sprouts - but veggies beware, they're made w/ bacon but the table ended up ordering an extra serving, chicken wings, spicy potato cubes & all out appetizer plates were cleaned, clear

Entrees included Shrimp & grits, Shrimp tacos, Fried Chicken - we ran the southern gamut & it was delish!

Drinkys included a Peach Wheat Ale which was deemed delish as was my Pumpkin Bourbon Mule - nice southern, country spin on the classic Moscow Mule & loved the wintry spices.....served in the classic copper mug of course

Would come back here in a heartbeat!!"}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!
We went for brunch on sunday and it was outstanding!! We were greeted by a welcoming staff and a wonderous aroma of an extremely diverse menu. We sat near an open kitchen(some would find this to be a negative but not us) that allowed us to see many of the fabulous options before we made our decisions. Chef Justin F. (friendly and engaging) was more than happy to answer all of our questions about the various plates being delivered to other tables. I decided on the Shrimp and grits......it was amazing!!! Truly a slice of heaven in a bowl!! I can't wait until next week so I can try something else! Great staff, great food! This is our new sunday ritual!!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what all the buzz is about.  Went with a work group and even though everyone was very polite, no one actually finished their meal nor raved about the food.   Maybe we went on a bad day, but don't think I'd go back."}
{"text":"I need something, anything, to get rid of the lingering taste of disappointment. Half of a pack of Altoids didn't do the trick.  The worst of it is HOW MUCH I was looking forward to finally getting to eat here... We sat down (the two of us) and were looking over the drink menu when we were approached by our server, who was pleasant enough.  We hadn't made up our mind yet, so water was offered and graciously accepted. The beer menu was decent enough, so we both decided on a beer.  Ten to fifteen minutes later, our two beers arrive and they were quickly followed by a biscuit and blueberries. The biscuit was good, albeit room temperature.  We elected the chicken wings to start- they were quite good, both in size and flavor. I was even more excited for my meal! 

I ordered the buttermilk fried shrimp, the french green beans in brown butter with basil and the parmesan shoestring fries with BBQ seasoning.  My boyfriend opted for the meat loaf with benne asparagus and mac-n-cheese.  My first bite was a crispy shoestring fry...... Not one shaving of parm on the pile of slivered potatoes. Not a lick of BBQ season on a single fry on the plate.  Not even a grain of salt! My brown butter green beans with basil had no basil, no salt, no brown butter, and no flavor.  They tasted like canola oil and the green beans you steam in the bag.  The jumbo buttermilk fried shrimp had the ability to be quite tasty. Unfortunately they decided to squirt lemon mayo all over the five shellfish I received. Aioli it was not.  They could have at least used Dukes.  The mac-n-cheese tasted like boiled pasta.  Unsalted boiled pasta, the same consistency of Stouffers but less flavor. The asparagus was to be \"benne asparagus.\" We found and counted ONE single sesame seed on his plate.  The meatloaf was as cold as the seedless asparagus.

I like beer. Especially when I go out.  I can run up a bar tab.  Not an issue here. My beer glass sat empty as did my water, and not once was I offered more of either beverage. 

I will not be returning.  Next time I want southern flavor and don't feel like cooking it myself, I'll go back to the Cajun Yard Dog. Those folks know how to do it right, and they are deliciously consistent."}
{"text":"I had a coworker take me here for lunch the day I flew into Charlotte and ordered the Wicked Chicken Sandwich.  It was very good and the meal came out hot and well prepared.  My coworker had a problem with the biscuits that came at the beginning of the meal.  He was raving about these biscuits and when they came out he ate one bite and said they did not taste right.  When he sent them back to the kitchen, the sous chef came out and explained the dough was not mixed right that morning and she would make us a fresh batch as soon as she could.  We continued on with our meal and when we were finished, the biscuits came out.  They were wrapped up to go.  I have worked in the kitchen of many restaurants in my days and I understand that things do happen.  When they do happen, it is how you handle it that matters and I appreciate the way the Sous chef handled the issue. Kudos to the chef and the staff.  I will revisit this establishment again for sure.  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Jonathan is the best server!! He is so knowledgeable, kind, and funny!!We got seated on the patio and it's so nice out here! We were a little late for our reservations but, they accommodated us. The service is just all around AWESOME!!"}
{"text":"Unique and delicious food. Ask for Jonathan as you're server, he is GREAT at his job and will take excellent care of you. One of the best servers we've ever had at any restaurant! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The service was great, the food was just okay but the drinks amazing!!!
I'm in love with the bluberry splash punch and the fried okra. I ordered shrimp and grits with chorizo. The dish was a bit greasy and needed a kick of something (insert hot sauce). The menu sounds great so Im definitely going back."}
{"text":"Anyone should be able to cook eggs but the biscuits are where it's at! A little expensive but won't break the bank. Sundays get crowded so go early. Wish I could get the almond cranberry granola  pancake with orange maple syrup like in Asheville."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! My fiancé and I stopped here twice on our vacation because our first time here was incredible. I like a place where I leave happy knowing I have given my business to ones that really deserve it. 

The food was absolutely delicious both times and we definitely enjoyed the mimosas and bloody Mary's! (I recommend getting the larger size)

I tried the southern Poutine scramble and loved it! Definitely enjoyed the kale slaw they served with it. Second time around I went with the fried chicken and biscuits with an added fried egg-so filling but soo tasty! The potato Cracklins were definitely a great side although I wish I got to try the Brussels sprouts too. 
My fiancé got the shoo mercy pancakes with fried chicken and the steak and eggs-he loved both!
Oh and can't forget about the great biscuits with blueberry jam and honey! Have to be careful not to fill up on that!

We also visited the Asheville location - not as spacious as the Charlotte location but sitting at the counter meant we got to see just how hard the employees work. The food was still really good here!

We hope to come back to North Carolina soon and stop here again!"}
{"text":"Karlee was an amazing waitress. She explained the menu well and she was very pleasant during our afternoon Sunday brunch. This is my new favorite restaurant in Charlotte. The food was so good! Thanks Karlee for your courteous service today !"}
{"text":"I went to Tupelo for brunch on a Saturday while my dad was in town. I wanted to take him to a new concept with a different style of breakfast options. Staff was was very friendly and accommodating. We got the complementary biscuits and in house made blueberry jam. The biscuit itself was delicious the blueberry jam was not our favorite but we are partial to strawberry. 
We ordered the chicken and biscuits with an egg, the Shoo Mercy Pancakes and the southern breakfast bowl. The white gravy and biscuits had a great flavor with the basil. The fried chicken was over cooked making it dry and tough to chew. The chicken on my dads pancakes was the same and he did not eat but two bites of chicken. The massive sweet potato pancake was bursting with sweet sugary flavor. I would highly recommend the pancake with the side of bacon combo. My girlfriend's southern bowl was mediocre with eggs, black eye peas, bacon, grits and salsa verde with chorizo added to it. The bowl itself was watery maybe from thin grits and the salsa and the flavor seemed to be lacking. To be completely honest i generally like a more traditional breakfast style with meat eggs and a carb. It is fast easy to make and cheap with good flavor and Tupelo really was none of those for us."}
{"text":"?
Looking at these reviews, I have to ask myself what in the name of God do you people eat on a regular basis that elevates this garbage to the 4 star level?  

I will start with the good, but don't worry it will be brief. The regular, no frills Bloody Mary I had while waiting at the bar was pretty good and I really liked the sitting area outside.  Ok, so that rounds out the good.  Let's move on to the drubbing Tupelo Honey deserves.

I don't even know where to start other than to say this place is a beacon of mediocrity placed on a pedestal by the simpleminded masses.

1. The Queen Mary.  This was really the crown jewel of the meal.  In the sense that it cost a kings ransom and then didn't deliver. On top of the terrible flavor it was so thick it was almost impossible to drink.

2. The goat cheese grit's are a good idea in theory, but even the greatest grits in the world are not good cold.

3. The Shoo Mercy Omelet was truly egregious.  Nothing like a crepe thin, flavorless egg mix crammed full of way too much, of way too many things.  It's supposed to be big and caloric and unwieldy, that's the whole point. However, instead of inserting entire fried green tomatoes and other intact chunks of filling, you have to break it up a little. Instead of using what was almost certainly 2 milk stretched eggs... you should be using at least 4-6 unmolested ones if you really want to do it right..and season them with something, please. It barely had any pimento cheese in it and what it did have was in one bite.  Run of the mill bacon and ham that had recently seen the likes of a peel-able plastic enclosure. It was incredibly disappointing and I only finished half of it, as I refuse to eat 2000+ calories of complete and utter crap.

4.  The grilled cheese my girlfriend ordered literally did not have cheese on it.  Don't really know what else to say about that. 

5.  Everything tastes the same.

Tupelo Honey, to me, is an exemplar of paradoxical dining patterns and preferences in our society.  Bottom-line: it's big box, watered down southern BS with a smile, yall.  Something along the lines of Bubba Gump Shrimp Company having a bastard child with Bob Evans."}
{"text":"Food is good, but not worth the prices. Especially when you consider the sub-standard service you receive there. I've been there twice now and have had issues with really complicated things like, getting a glass of water and clearing dirty dishes off the table. Servers also act like we're a nuisance for disturbing their evening. If you expect me to pay $20 for pork, you should at least have your servers smile when they take my order. Not going back."}
{"text":"Loved the artistic use of space. This used to be a mill. I think I just am not into real fatty foods and this place is a caloric heaven! But good! Wait staff was very helpful and friendly and my trout was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch the other weekend. I had the Lavender Honey Flip and Bloody Mary for drinks. The Lavender Honey Flip is refreshing and not sweet at all. The Bloody Mary is on point and has just the right amount of spice. I ordered the fried chicken meal for my entree and got the shaved brussel sprout salad as my side. Can I just say the biscuits are AMAZING with the blueberry jam that they served?! The fried chicken was great, a good ratio between breading and chicken. The kale and carrot side (that comes standard with entrees) and the brussel sprout side were both refreshing and tasty. One of my friends ordered the hash browns which came out a little too salty. Our server was kind enough to take it off the menu. Great atmosphere and love the food and staff!"}
{"text":"The Mimosas stole my heart immediately. The wait was very long but oh so worth it once seated. The menu was the most eclectic southern brunch menu I've encountered and I settled with Macaroni & Cheese, fried potatoes and French toast. Delicious choices!"}
{"text":"The Shoo Mercy pancakes are ridiculously good. I consider myself a food snob and the pancakes at Tupelo were on point for flavor, fluffy, and moist. Tupelo is a delicious spot for any occasion with indoor/outdoor space and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a cute spot for brunch/lunch/dinner. It truly is a Charlotte gem."}
{"text":"Wish I could remeber her name, I want to say..Roseanne or something like that, anyhow, she was a super friendly server that made our brunch pleasant. Our coffees and waters were never in need. 
Friend and I had the breakfast grits bowl ($10) from the brunch menu, appreciated the soysauge substitute in place of bacon without charge. Goat cheese grits always hits the spot. Wished it had a bit less pinto beans a bit more of the cucumber salsa. We both had a bit of pinto beans left over in the bowl at the end.
Other friend had one of the bloody Marys that came with a whole strip of bacon and chicken and biscuit. I didn't try any but empty cup and plate at end of the meal could only mean satisfaction.

Planning on visiting back for dinner soon."}
{"text":"Dinner was way better than I expected! Great ambiance and even more amazing food. This place was a great surprise"}
{"text":"Expect a significant wait but quick turnaround between ordering and receiving your food. 

We arrived around 10AM on a Sunday and were quoted 45-60 minutes for indoor seating and 15-20 minutes for outdoor seating. Bar seating is available but minimal -  expect for people to gather around the bar as they grab a drink while waiting for their tables. We opted for outdoor seating and the time quote was accurate.

What we ordered: 
- Blueberry champagne short stack (free with email signup) - worth an email sign up to try it, but the pancakes are kid-sized haha 
- Southern shakshuka - you can't go wrong ordering this! A good balance of grits, egg, tomatoes and avocado
- Apple cider pork belly hash - essentially potatoes + 2 eggs. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious and well made, but I don't think it was substantial enough to be considered an entree. It would be a great appetizer though! I'd recommended it as something to share, not something to order for yourself only."}
{"text":"Tupelo is a long time favorite. When I learned it was moving to Charlotte I was stoked! Though it has been no replacement for the real deal in Asheville, it's been pleasant to have Tupelo here. 

Yesterday for Mother's Day our family went for lunch as we did last year. They did a great job with the reservation and the people we're pleasant but that's about the end of it.

We were very disappointed in every other aspect of our long journey. I first noticed the menu was not what I was accustomed to, seemed more limited and less of the southern \"Tupelo\" vibe we love.(When did Guacamole Toast become a Southern Food and Carolina Mountains tradition?) While we were seated on time, once we ordered our meal it took over an hour to actually get the food. I understand being busy but an hour for our order is ridiculous. Meanwhile the AC was freezing us out, but we had plenty of time to go outside and thaw, despite our several requests to turn the AC back. Once the food did arrive there were a several misses from what was ordered but after waiting an hour we ate what we could and got out if there. What we did eat was not great and a couple of us had digestive \"challenges\" that evening. I've never said that about Tupelo.

Afterwards we saw the sign outside about a new chef. Not sure if that's the reason for the not so Southern menu changes and poor execution but something is definitely off. 

I really want Tupelo to do well but it seems things are going downhill after comparing our experience with some of the recent reviews. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. PLEASE BRING BACK THE TUPELO WE LOVED."}
{"text":"One word...YUCK! Ordered Eggs Betty.  Gelatinous eggs and hard tasteless potatoes.  Biscuits are dense and not fresh...no butter served...just honey and weird liquid blueberries. The fried ochre was good.  Coffee dreadful.  Sweet iced tea over sweetened.  The staff is friendly and efficient. Cute atmosphere and decor."}
{"text":"Early afternoon on a Friday, we ate at Tupelo's. We enjoy sitting at the tables in the bar and the food is always good, especially the biscuits. However, service is a different story. On this Friday afternoon Tupelo was not crowded. We ordered and it seemed to have taken an unusually long time for our food to arrive. We ate and then sat and sat and sat as we waited and watched our server chatting with someone else, checking her cell phone and disappear behind the swinging doors. I asked another server for a to go box. I asked one of the managers if we could get our check. We paid, left and will think twice about going back. Customers should not put up with lack of service."}
{"text":"What a Wonderful Addition to Southend Charlotte! We frequent this place quite often. All of the dishes are freshly prepared and has a Great environment. Defiantly great for any occasion. Hint, get there early it's always packed!! Absolutely love the Okra and the Chicken BLT sandwich!"}
{"text":"Tupelo is amazing southern comfort food that makes me feel like I'm in Charleston all over again. I recommend the Bloody Mary and Mimosas. The Mac and cheese is amazing and the Chicken BLT was over the moon perfect. We did appetizers when we went as a group of 6 and they were all so good. Only drawback is they don't normally take reservations but the wait hasn't been too long past 20 minutes anytime I've gone. Also complimentary valet makes my life so much easier because the parking can be tight and very packed."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, food extraordinary and the environment was fun. My favorite menu items were the biscuits with honey and definitely the fried green tomatoes. Would have went to Tupelo Honey again if our visit to Charlotte was longer. I Highly recommend eating here!!"}
{"text":"Lunch on a rainy day, but greeting was welcoming and warm.  Servers (trainee and regular) were attentive and informed. Food was very good - fresh and well presented. Had a glitch on one item and server was quick to make the necessary adjustments. Very accommodating on some food restrictions for one in our party. Overall very nice dining experience."}
{"text":"Favorite brunch I've ever had! Yes there are long waits on the weekends, like anywhere. But if you plan ahead it is worth the wait. Our server (I'm sorry I forget his name!) was wonderful and so friendly and accommodating. The biscuits are a very nice and appreciated touch. Out of the 8 people at our table everyone raved about their meals. I had the moonshine Bloody Mary and the Shashuka and we shared the crisped potatoes. Can't wait to return now that it's warm and sit outside."}
{"text":"My girlfriend liked it but I wasn't impressed. We went for brunch on Valentine's Day. Having a reservation was definitely a good idea. I recommend it. The fried chicken BLT was decent but the Mac and cheese side was very bland and had no flavor. Service was ok seeing how we had a first time server. He did a good job for his first time on the floor. My girlfriend had the eggs Benedict and she really enjoyed that. I had high expectations since we had heard of long lines and people talking about how they wanted to come here. I'm willing to give it another shot but not impressed so far."}
{"text":"The place is extremely overrated. Do not know where all 5 star reviews came from. 
My martini was the best part of the experience. Diner quality food which is overpriced. 
Service was ok. 
Will not come back or recommend."}
{"text":"Food was worse then any of the other 5 Tupelo's I've been to. I always order the Charleston Chicken Sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese. While the sandwich was alright, the Mac and cheese was horrible! I honestly felt as if I were eating boxed Mac and cheese, little flavor and very dry. My partner got his usual Chicken Biscuits & Gravy and was very dissatisfied himself. For a $36.00 ticket the food should be enjoyable.  



Also, they were out of soft drinks! What restaurant doesn't have soft drinks? 

I plan to continue going to the one in Asheville or Johnson City. This was the worst experience for me."}
{"text":"Beautiful outdoor seating, pleasant courteous service and yummy breakfast!

Great (complimentary) biscuits served with warm honey and blueberry compote.  We ordered Chicken and Biscuits and the Breakfast Bowl - both VERY delicious.  Would definitely go here again..."}
{"text":"Tupelo is one of my favorite spots. The one in Knoxville and Asheville are awesome. For some reason this South Charlotte location didn't send me home with the same feeling. The service was average at best (we sat in the bar, which was nearly empty) and the hostess was not friendly. She brought us into the bar and sat us at a table that needed to be wiped down. When we asked if someone could do so she seemed appalled we ask for such a thing to be done. Not the normal service their other locations pride themselves on. 

Meanwhile, my food was pretty good. I had the BBQ pork, which was downed in sauce, The black eyed peas were awesome, but the mashed sweet potatoes were average. They looked like they came out of a ice cream scooper, much different than what I had at the other locations. My cousin had the shrimp and grits. They were presented well, but tasted average, she said. 

Still I believe Tupelo is a great place for lunch or dinner. And, I'm guessing had we sat in the dining area we would have gained a different experience. Hopefully, you will."}
{"text":"Off their game today (12/6/15)

In short, a really long wait for ok food.  Initial estimate was 35-45 minute wait for a two top that was about 1:15 before we were sat.  Then a ticket time around 45 minutes for ok food at best.  One of the chicken sandwiches seemed like it had been sitting on the expo stand for at least 15 minutes, long enough the lettuce to begin to wilt under the heat lamps.

Just overall not an enjoyable experience probably centered around the kitchen's issues."}
{"text":"I'd say this is more of a morning drink spot then a good food spot. Food is pretty greasy, and it didn't blow me away as much as I would have thought (given the long wait). The pictures make it look tastier than it actually is.

I will say their biscuits are on point! Sadly, the free biscuits are more delicious than the entree you pay for."}
{"text":"I had heard many good things about the brunch at Tupelo Honey. This was my first time at this restaurant and I was less than impressed. It took a long time to get our drinks and when we finally did, some were missing. To get this corrected took an extra 10-15 minutes. 2 of 7 food orders came out incorrect, and no one in my party was overly pleased with their meal, especially for the price.. Lastly, the bathrooms were disgusting. There was trash all over the floor of the womens room, and there was no toilet paper or paper towels available. They appeared to not have been cleaned in days. It seems that this restaurant is severely understaffed and the quality of service does not align with the prices you are paying for food. Parking is a nightmare as well. I will not rush back to eat here again and I think the 6 other women I went with would say the same.


Oh, and.. the hostesses were less than pleasant. There were a large number of customers waiting for a table with not much room to stand and wait. When trying to get past us we were given a rude \"excuse me\" in a snarky tone of voice - almost yelling, 3 different times in 5 minutes. I understand you are busy and perhaps we are in your way, but I don't think that is an appropriate way to address a customer who made a reservation days in advance and still had to wait 15 minutes for the table."}
{"text":"Awesome southern inspired cooking with their own twist. You can't go wrong with much of anything on the menu, but it is a little pricey. The staff is great, ask for Johnny if he is working."}
{"text":"Okay.  So I love their little biscuits they serve you in the little wooden bowls with the honey and homemade jam.  That's awesome.  The only thing is that the two times I've visited the one on South Blvd, the wait staff usually is in some weird pretentious mood which is strange because they're based out of Asheville.  I love the food.  I'm just okay with the staff which is the thing that's prevented me from making frequent visits.  Food is delicious though and I still recommend you at least try it.  Who knows? You may have a much better experience than I did the first couple of times."}
{"text":"Say Tup-helloooo to one of the best southern twist brunches ever!

The biscuits are to die for! The wicked chicken biscuit sandwich is so yummy but not very spicy. Loved loved loved the signature the salad because the the dressing was so tasty & fat filled (almost bought until I read the label...not so healthy) but so worth it. That bacon chicken pancake was glutinous heaven in my mouth. I never had anything like it. I also really liked the jalapeño corn slaw. Our server Jonathan was great & very helpful when ordering.  

Definitely a must go back soon kinda place."}
{"text":"Opening weekend seemed to be a success so I decided to go today for the 2nd time, to celebrate my birthday. I was very excited to bring a group of co-workers with me. We waited 20 minutes for a seat but since we arrived during the lunch rush, we were patient. Just as before the biscuits, jam & honey were amazing but unfortunately that was the extent of my good experience. We waited a long time for our food (we're at about an hour in at this point) and once it came so did the requests. Mayo, dressing for a friends salad, etc. our waitress seemed young and a bit inexperienced to handle multiple requests as she would bring one item out at a time. After my burger sat getting cold for another 10 minutes I asked again for mayo and was told \"it's coming!\". At that point I'm losing my appetite because of her attitude and service but it was my birthday lunch after all so I was going to enjoy this burger....or was I? Nope, my med well burger was med RARE at best once I cut into it and at that point the rest of my party was more than 1/2 way through their meal. I was done. The manager said she would comp my meal, give me a gift card (which she never gave me) and bring me something else from the menu but seemed like she honestly didn't care that my birthday lunch was ruined...and they still brought me the check for the \"comped\" grilled cheese sandwich I had to choke down. 

This did not seem like the same place I had dinner opening weekend. Had it only been issues with the food & had I not been disrespected by the staff, I might have returned once they get the kinks worked out. 

Tip: the wood floors are EXTREMELY slippery (hold the wax, folks) and an elderly lady fell flat on her back while we were there. I was wearing heels and almost slipped myself. Be aware of that & wear shoes with some sort of traction or be very cautious when walking on them."}
{"text":"Today, November 21st, was our first visit to the Tupelo Honey Café in Charlotte.  We had an early lunch, arriving a few minutes after they opened at 11am.  Great experience.  Excellent service by \"D\".  Food was fabulous.  Husband had the pork shoulder steak with muscadine grapes, brussel sprouts and  mac & cheese, sister in law had the fried chicken BLT tacos with goat cheese grits, daughter had the buttermilk fried chicken, goat cheese grits and collards and I had the roast pork with peanut pico tacos and mac & cheese.  We had three to go boxes because it was more food than we could eat.  Would recommend getting there early for lunch as by the time we left, it was filling up."}
{"text":"This place only has 1 downside and that is the wait. It's becoming a very well known spot for people all over Charlotte so it's gets crowded quickly. Go early if you want to avoid the crowds. 

The Chicken & Biscuits is hands down the best in Charlotte. Your grandma doesn't make em this good! This mainly has to do with their one of kind biscuits and a gravy that'll make you slap your mama. 

My wife loves the mimosas and the bacon. 

You pretty much can't go wrong with this whether you are a local or just visiting."}
{"text":"Horrible food, service, selection, environment, layout ... and did I mention the terrible food

My favorite part of dining at Tupelo Honey's was getting to ride the elevator ... so, there's that

This was my second attempted meal here. I guess I just needed confirmation"}
{"text":"Good food, darned expensive. I waited several months before trying Tupelo Honey. I heard the lines were long so I figured I'd give the newness some time to wear off. Looks like it has because we walked right in at 7:30 on a Friday night.  Granted...we didn't ask for the patio...which looked very inviting on a nice, cool, summer evening.

Service was attentive although a bit uninformed.  My other half asked for mac and cheese instead of asparagus and she said the substitution wasn't possible, yet returned a few minutes later to say it was.  That's a training issue though.

Food was really good.  I got the veggie melt which included layers of fried green tomatoes (which managed to retain their crunch), lemon aioli, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, spinach and cheese.  It was served open faced, making it much easier to manage. I chose the browned butter brussels sprouts as my side. More butter than I would have liked and they were a bit under seasoned but tasty, nonetheless.

Other half ordered the chicken piccata. I've never seen chicken piccata with shrimp, much less without capers, but it must have been good because he completely cleaned his plate.

Oh...and the biscuits! Yummy! And served with honey (naturally) and blueberry jelly. I'd come back just for those!

My only problem was the pricing. The chicken piccata was 18 bucks! But...like I said, he cleaned that plate so I suppose it was worth it.  Maybe next time I'll hit the patio and do some people watching!

I'll definitely come back. Maybe nex"}
{"text":"What an amazing space!  The building and dining area are fantastic.  I can imagine many great brunches, lunches, and events here.  We stopped in for a Friday lunch date.  Parking and traffic were a bit tricky but we were able to find a spot.  There was no real wait for a 12:00 lunch.

Service was friendly, helpful, and prompt.  Oh my, the biscuits and jam to start off were amazing.  If they kept bringing them I would not have needed lunch!  There were so many great options on the menu it was tough to decide.

My wife opted for the grilled chicken sandwich and I had the wicked chicken sandwich.  It was a lot of food.  The fries were perfect with a great crisp.  The sandwiches were better than average but not as great as we expected.  The grilled chicken sandwich needed a little more flavor.  My wicked chicken was more messy than I prefer with the juice soaking through the bottom bun before it made it to the table.  The chicken was good though the slaw was lost in the sandwich.  

Perfect score for the atmosphere, location, and every nonfood related item.  The biscuits alone are worth a trip.  The sandwiches could have been better but they gave a reason to plan a return trip.  We will be back to try some of the other tasty options."}
{"text":"Thanks Jonathan for great lunch service Friday! You made my brothers birthday special! 

Our meal was excellent and the service you provided was superb. 

We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Get it together, THC Charlotte. I know you've only been open for two weeks, so I should cut you some slack. But i'm not sure, after my experience this week, I can justify visiting you again. 

I walked in at 4:45 on Monday afternoon, ravenous and ready to indulge. There was one table occupied, and approximately 17 servers standing around joking with each other.  I was supposed to be meeting my sister, who was stuck in traffic, but I thought I'd go ahead and order a drink and appetizer while I waited for her. NO CAN DO. The hostesses informed me that 75% of my party needed to be there before I could be seated. Incredulous, I took a slow look around the restaurant recognizing that there were approximately 12 servers per person currently dining. Sensing my annoyance, the hostess laughed and said \"I know it seems silly but that's our rule.\"  I understand that rule. I'm actually for that rule. WHEN IT MAKES SENSE. Does it really make sense to annoy the third person to patronize your establishment that evening?  Get a grip, THC. Rules make the world work, but please teach your employees some common sense in applying those rules. 

After awkwardly standing in the foyer looking at the nearly empty restaurant for five minutes, a manager finally came over and allowed me to be seated. From this point forward, the service was excellent. Our waiter was the perfect mix of attentive but not annoying. When my meal turned out not to be up to the THC Asheville standard, the manager insisted on trying to make it again but better this time, and I appreciated the effort.

The PIMM'S CUP, made with Pimm's (fruit infused gin), cucumber, and ginger ale, was delicious and refreshing. The food, however was a big disappointment. 

FRIED GREEN TOMATO appetizer - the cornmeal breading was crunchy but otherwise lacked flavor, and the goat cheese grits smelled of goat cheese more than tasted.  With no other sauce or flavor, these ended up being dry and bland. I'm usually a big fan of fried green tomatoes, but if the breading is not delicious on its own, the dish really needs some remoulade sauce or chunks of goat cheese to make up for it. 1/5

MISSE'S ASHEVILLE'S VEGGIE MELT - I've had this three times at the Asheville location and enjoyed it, to varying degrees, every time.  This time the bread was soggy and lacked any sourdough flavor, and the cooks were a little heavy-handed with the Havarti cheese melted on top. The crunch of the fried green tomato was completely lacking, so the entire sandwich felt like a big pile of mushy soggy limp vegetables with no textural differences at all. The lemon aoli is amazing. Really. It is! That's one of the main reasons I keep ordering this dish. Unfortunately that alone could not save this sandwich. 0/5

CHEESY CAULIFLOWER BISQUE - nothing memorable, other than that it wasn't good enough to eat more than a few spoonfuls. The biscuit croutons were definitely a nice touch. But the soup lacked flavor. 0/5

TOMATO SOUP-  unfortunately, same review as above. The croutons were nice, but the soup itself lacked flavor and wasn't good enough to waste stomach space. 1/5

SHOO GRILLED CHEESE - grilled cheese sandwich with fried green tomatoes, sautéed veggies, bacon and hot, melty pimento cheese. What's not to like? This was the one item that seemed good; unfortunately it was my sister's. 4/5

FRIED OKRA with CAROLINA WHITE SAUCE - the okra was fine. Nicely crispy. But the white sauce... Not. Good. At. All. Ask for the lemon aoli to dip the okra in; it's much better. 2.5/5

The location, in the old Pewter Rose, is great, and I love the outdoor seating. That will be great when the weather is a little better. The restaurant and bar areas are both very large and will accommodate quite a crowd, even more so than the Asheville location."}
{"text":"Emerson was a fantastic waiter, and together we mourned the loss of your Appalachian egg rolls. Unfortunately I will be boycotting/protesting THC until these return to the menu. 5 stars for Emerson!"}
{"text":"If I could give no stars, I would have. We had a reservation for a group of 6 for 7 pm a few weeks after this place opened. When we arrived, only 4 of the 6 were there, so we were sent to the bar to wait. When the other members arrived just a few minutes later, we were told that the wait would be 30 min even though we had a reservations. Fine. Whatever. We had a good place at the very tiny bar. One plus was that the bar service was very prompt and friendly even though it's typically packed shoulder to shoulder.

Thirty minutes came and passed, and when I asked about our reservation, they said 15 more minutes. When I asked after 15 minutes, they said 15 more....This went on for AN HOUR AND A HALF. Why we waited, I'm not really sure. At that point it was probably principle more than anything.

I finally had to stand at the hostess station with the manager for her to figure out they had given a party of TWO with the same name our table over an hour ago and had been trying to save face ever since. Complete idiots never even told me (which I wouldn't have been super understanding, but still, at least it was an excuse). The manager was completely rude and unapologetic for their mistakes.

After much back and forth, we were seated TWO AND A HALF HOURS after we first arrived (which was two hours and 15 minutes after our reservation time). Luckily, our food was comped, but I want my life back that I wasted at that restaurant. 

Incompetent hostesses and management. Food was okay (appetizers and biscuits are the only good things on the menu). Drinks were good but pricey. Bar service was great. Waitress was friendly.

NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Not that great. I would say out of the three dishes we ordered, we only enjoyed the biscuits that came before our meal. We got the meatloaf (dry and bland, almost like eating a cheap burger patty); \"fried chicken\" (more like salty country fried steak); and the salmon with salad (meager portions for the price). The biscuits were nice and fluffy but OH MY GOODNESS why is their other food so terrible? Not only is it poorly made and prepared but it took us an hour to get our food! This wasn't even during their busy hours. Severely disappointed in the food though and will not be coming back a second time. 

It seems like there's a lot of hype surrounding this place and maybe because it's a cool casual ambiance on top of a building, but I say don't bother. Expensive for the quality of food and nothing very outstanding in their menu."}
{"text":"Great meal. Pimiento nachos were a huge hit. Simply had fried chicken, green beans, and potatoes. Excellent."}
{"text":"After a long wait, our host brought us to the table and made a snarky remark when we pointed out the syrup all over the table. They ran out of orange juice at 10:45am on a Sunday. The food was just ok. Should've went somewhere else."}
{"text":"Just in town visiting and decided to try it out. Very much not what we experienced based on fellow reviews other than the true fact of the long wait time for our food; definitely not a place to come with small, hungry kids. All of our meals were less to be desired, but at least our staff interaction was pleasant. I had really high hopes for this place, but definitely not worth the price overall."}
{"text":"Went to Brunch on Sunday. The food was good and fair priced.
The service was just ok, our server could have cleaned up a bit to come to work.
We ordered 2 Tito's Bloody Marys...they were pretty good but they should be for being over $26 bucks.
Sort of crazy lol. $9 for the Tito's which is fine but then another $3.25 for the Bloody Mary. Way over the top in my opinion.
Anyway to sum it up 3stars
4stars for food
2stars for service and
Who knows for the Bloody Mary's lol
FYI have your drinks at home before you get there"}
{"text":"Just like the one in Asheville - but bigger! Great for weekend brunch with family and friends!"}
{"text":"Where do I even start, this place is amazing. Honestly without the absolutely amazing server Johnathan I wouldn't have even known where to start. You would have thought this gentleman owned the establishment. He made our dinning experience one to remember. Being from Orlando, FL we don't find many \"southern modern\" places like this. But this is a place I will be talking about for years. Fried chicken no matter what the dish is to die for. Johnathan even took the time to fill us in on some great location to stop while here on our vacation. To Tupelo Honey Cafe and Johnathan, thank you for making our first day in NC a memorable one."}
{"text":"Food is fine just WAY overpriced. Felt like I got a child size portion. After my $13 omelette I left and had to go some where else to get the rest of my meal."}
{"text":"We had a delicious dinner at this delightful bastion of southern cuisine. We tried the Goat cheese app which was my favorite dish. The sweet figs with savory goat cheese was fabulous, just the right amount of salty and sweet. Then we tried the crab cake app which was a homemade one in that it had the lump crab bits and a subtle seasoning everyone liked. This was my first time here and the biscuits lived up to the descriptions I've heard. Fluffy and sweet with intoxicating buttery flavors I was so happy to eat there.
Dinner entree was the pan fried trout and I liked the simple seasoning and delicate flaky texture of the dish.  The beers we had were liked by all also. My party agreed we would return to TH again. We were a full and happy crew!"}
{"text":"Overall, I'd say Tupelo doesn't live up to its 4 stars on yelp. The service was alright, the food was okay, and it was overpriced. 

I had the avocado and grilled chicken sandwich with a side of fries. The avocado was browned, the chicken was so tough there is no way it was fresh (definitely frozen for a while), and there was little seasoning on it. My boyfriend got the same thing as I did and his meal arrived cold, with very little avocado, and half the amount of fries as me. 

I will say that their biscuits were fantastic! They're the only reason why this review isn't 2 stars honestly."}
{"text":"No where near worth the price. They seem afraid to season the food. it all tasted flat. The biscuits I could get at a local breakfast diner. No plans to ever go back and wouldn't recommend it to a friend."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot with friends for breaktfast! Their Chicken Biscuit and Gravy is so good! You have to make sure to either go at an off time or get their early because there is usually a wait."}
{"text":"What a great little cafe! Upstairs in a strip mall, lots of outdoor seating! So I had the fried chicken, quinoa and Brussel sprouts! The pecan, cranberry and mandarin orange quinoa is absolutely fantastic! The fried chicken had great coating,  but because it was boneless,  it was a little dry. If you go, make sure you have a Muddy River Mai Tai and support the only local rum distillery in the state of NC!"}
{"text":"Service was outstanding and we had a great Time with Emma!
I recommend the Wicked Chicken either in a salad or sandwich.
Thank you for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"This quaint and homey restaurant, while boasting an appealing menu, lacks in a variety of areas. But I'll start with the positives. While others boast poor service, we had quite the opposite. Our server was attentive, checking on us at just the right intervals. Waters never ran empty, and he was kind in his approach.
We started with a pimento cheese appetizer. Honestly, this didn't taste like any pimento I've ever had and not in a good way. The flavor was lacking, and there was a heavy granular texture. The pickled jalapeno went well with it, but I would have liked that taste to be incorporated into the cheese instead of on the side. The chips were overly salted, which also muted my taste buds to any flavor the cheese might have had.
Served alongside the appetizer was a corn meal biscuit with warm honey and blueberry jam. While the biscuit was a bit dry, the honey compensated for this. The blueberry lacked in sweetness, but this was actually a plus side. It also paired well.
I had the Charleston Chicken sandwich, which was decent. The bread was a little over-buttered, but other than that the chicken was moist and the Havarti cheese was a perfect choice. On the side was the lemon quinoa, which was overpowered by the extremely ripe blueberries. If I had a bite without a blueberry, it was perfect. An odd note, but if the blueberries hadn't been so ripe they would have worked nicely.
My partner had the Fried Chicken BLT. Honestly, it needed a bit more of the honey dijon as the flavor in the chicken was muted by the bread and tomato. The chicken alone (out of the sandwich) was extremely tasty. The breading was on point and the chicken was moist. However, his side item (the Southern Style Greens) should have been labeled 'Chinese beef and broccoli.' Of course there was no beef, but the greens were so thoroughly swamped in sauce (a soy base I took it) that any flavor that the greens had themselves was lost long ago. 

All in all, I might go back every few months. I definitely wouldn't get the same thing, as their dinner entrees looked more appealing after all was said and done. Not a favorite spot of mine, but not terrible by any stretch. Seems like a nice place in good weather to sit outside, have a Happy Hour drink, and enjoy a small app or split an entree."}
{"text":"We had reservations and it was not particularly crowded but we waited over 45 minutes to get the food.  One order was wrong, it was sent back and came back missing a side.  By the time the side came, everyone was done.  She ended up never eating.  The manager did not charge for that meal.  The service was not good,  no drink refills.  Bills were wrong and had to be taken back and revised.  This was over a lunch hour.  Food was good but not worth the long wait and lack of service, especially over a work lunch hour."}
{"text":"Best biscuits eva! With fresh blueberry 
Try eggs with goat cheese and grits with goat cheese. The homes fries are cut in slices and fried just right! Charlotte ya growin' on me. Atlanta Boy"}
{"text":"While I have never been to the one in Asheville, Tupelo Honey in Charlotte has become a staple in my repertoire of restaurants that I must frequent on the regular. 

I have managed to never wait in line as I always get there early enough or there happens to be room in the bar area, which is very nice. Im sure if I had to wait in the line I see stack up at this place, I wouldn't be as happy. To me, waking up early and rushing out the door for TH is worth it! 

I have tried several different breakfast, lunch, and dinner options and I have always been impressed! I love (LOVE) their breakfast fried chicken and biscuits. In fact, it might be some of my most favorite fried chicken in Charlotte - and I've tried a lot of friend chicken in Charlotte. Some other things I love are their home fries, the huuuge plate sized sweet potato pancakes, the breakfast pies, eggs betty, their burger, and basically everything else on the menu. 

I have yet to be disappointed by the food or the staff. Tupelo can continue to expect to see me there very often, appetite in tow."}
{"text":"Nice menu fresh food good customer service nice view what's  not to like abouttupelo honey"}
{"text":"HOME GROWN COOKING. A great, nicer country style food place. Can be a little on the pricey side if you start ordering everything you want. I didn't leave hungry but some of the other dishes looked a little small. One of the few Charlotte places that offer Brunch on Sundays, so that is a PLUS! Can be loud outside, being that it is located on South Blvd."}
{"text":"The food is unreal! You won't leave hungry, I suggest getting the southern chicken sandwich but swap the tomato for a fried green tomato. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I haven't had a single meal here that I haven't loved...and that's what restaurants are for after all, right? But I will say there are plenty of kinks to work out in the service and hosting. But if you're not in a hurry to get seated or your food and instead looking for a delicious, new south meal, in a great area with cool ambiance, this is your spot."}
{"text":"My sister had told me to give this place a try.  And I am very happy that I did!  Great seating, fantastic vibe and delicious southern food.  You have to try the Brussel Sprouts on the appetizer menu!!!"}
{"text":"First time here.  I'm probably generous giving this a 2 star rating. We ordered appetizers first and the server just threw it on the table and split.  We had no drinks, no silverware.  Luckily there was a cart with plates nearby so we helped ourselves.  Our server seemed uninterested but there were others that were called on that were very helpful.  The food was mediocre at best.  The buttermilk fried chicken was over fried and burnt.  The chicken was dry.  Won't be coming here again"}
{"text":"The meatloaf was horrible. Tough as a brick. Ate there again and ordered the chicken breast. Meat was tough. The collards were awful as well. I'm only giving 3 stars because my friends meals weren't as bad as mine, although still not overly impressed. The place is definitely overhyped."}
{"text":"Try this sweet spot, it's a beautiful place a nice mix between new Southern food and old time architecture. The food was outstanding from avacedo and eggs, to the goat cheese  and eggs. Trust me you won't go hungry it's not possible.  A special soul  is Cynthia, a true honest soul who can help with everything."}
{"text":"The location is a definite 5 stars - Tupelo has a beautiful place painted in just about the most sunny shade of yellow under the sun. Great decor. A little loud, but it just kinda makes you cheerful to be here.

The food is very good, I'd say 8.5 out of 10. Really great biscuits came out courtesy of the restaurant. Many people ordered the goat cheese grits and had high hopes for them that were disappointed - personally I thought they were great, just depends on how phenomenal they were in your mind. I highly recommend the veggie bowl - very filling, great flavors, and absolutely slime-free fried okra. You really pay for what you get though, prices are on the expensive side. 

As for service, which seems to have been an issue for some: My own experience with a very large group (over a dozen) was fairly good. The server was a bit severe about not changing seats so that no orders would get mixed up, but everything came out promptly and for the most part to the right people. Several people had sipped on my rosemary peach lemonade (awesome but not recommended for kids as it is not sweet) by the time someone figured out it was mine and had been brought to the wrong person, but no biggie."}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday around 11:45am, naturally there was a wait. The wait was about 45 minutes. The wait wasn't too too bad considering the spacious outdoor waiting area. 

Once we were seated, the long waits continued. It took 5 minutes before a waiter came to take our drink order and then several minutes to return. After we ordered the waiter mentioned our biscuits coming out, we saw him twice before we actually received our biscuits. Then another 30 minutes for the food to come! It also took a long time to settle up the check. - wait time D-

Food. The food was ok, not spectacular. I had the black bean burger and Mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese came out cold, but I didn't feel like waiting any longer so I just ate it. The burger was good, minus the uncooked white onions, but I just took those off. Food B-

Love the atmosphere, outdoor seating. Food was ok, but getting to a restaurant at 11:45 and not leaving until almost 3 is too long!"}
{"text":"The wait was ridiculous- 2 hours.  Guess the food must be mind blowing...we didn't wait."}
{"text":"I first went to tupelo in Greenville sc and absolutely fell in love. The biscuits are unbelievable!! I would go just to eat one, or two or three.. :) The peach rosemary lemonade is a must. It is so refreshing and sweet! I also recommend the nutty friend chicken, it is incredible! This place reminds me of cracker barrel, but w/ more class. I will for sure be coming back again soon!"}
{"text":"Went here for a belated birthday celebration with a few friends and had a wonderful experience.  Our waiters name was Rogellio. He was charasmatic and VERY patient with the picky eaters in our group. I ordered the chicken with collards and potatoes as my sides. The chicken was seasoned to perfection and the collards were really good. There were 8 of of us in our group and everyone enjoyed there food. Tupelo can be a little pricey for the portion sizes but its really quality food so its worth it to me. I rarely write reviews but my overall experience was wonderful and Regellio was such a great waiter I wanted to share. Keep up the good work Charlotte Tupelo!"}
{"text":"Love the Asheville location...

With that said, this location lacks in two areas.

1. PLEASE open your doors at 9 like Asheville, 11am is ridiculous for breakfast

2.  Servers need better training.  They should appreciate their customers.

Food is good, especially the cheese grits.

**Went back recently with daughter.  Service was better.  Biscuit & jam was a big hit."}
{"text":"Service is great! Atmosphere is nice and the servers are really friendly and helpful! John is great definitely coming back! Thanks John!"}
{"text":"I went into Tupelo Honey on 6/27/17 and had a fantastic experience ordering and picking up takeout. I sat at the bar, and Jenna, the bartender provided excellent service the entire time. She offered me a water to-go while waiting for my food to get ready, and even offered me a sample of their Kentucky Bourbon specialty cocktail. She was very friendly, and even let me change my order once it had already been placed. I love this place, especially the delicious biscuits and honey."}
{"text":"Great ( and strong ) drinks - delicious food ( fried chicken and fried green tomatoes with potato cracklins). William is our favorite pirate server!"}
{"text":"Loved the new shrimp dish and our server Jonathan was awesome! We both had the Mega Mosa...a mimosa with 10 ounces of champagne and fresh squeezed OJ. Delicious! We sat on the covered porch, and while it was a very hot day it was still enjoyable with a nice breeze. This is a wonderful place to get awesome, inventive food and great service and I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food and the decor are great, but it's so loud, it's almost impossible to have a conversation. And there is most often a wait for a table. I like the food a lot, but don't go any longer because it's too noisy and the wait too long."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what we were expecting. Grits are not Southern yet the biscuits and honey are amazing. The tupelo honey beer is incredible and the service was awesome. The gravy was great and we had a very nice time. Well Worth the trip uptown!!"}
{"text":"Parking is a bitch. After spending a few minutes in the parking lot for brunch I saw a pedestrian almost get ran over. Do yourself a favor and park near the light rail and avoid to parking lot all together.

We had reservations for Sunday morning brunch, but I'm not sure what the purpose of a reservations was, you are still going to wait. We waited about 20 minutes. The host area is very crowded and not alot of seating. 

We sat outside and the restaurant is just beautiful. Well decorated and the location is very hip, in the heart of South end. 

When your seated they serve biscuits with jelly. They're good, very dense.

I had a mimosa and the wicked chicken biscuit. After placing the order for drinks it took about 5 to 10 min. After placing food order it took 45 min to 1 hour. I believe they hold off delivering your food so you'll buy more drinks. And the food was cold when it was delivered. Poor service in my opinion.

The prices were high. After 1 mimosa, 1 wicked chicken biscuit  (think size of CFA biscuit) tax and tip, I spent $25.00. I feel like I could've had my 3 friends I ate with come to my home for that price and I could have served brunch. Next time I plan on checking out somewhere else. This was the 3rd time I've been here. The first time was great, the 2nd was mediocre and I thought I'd give it another shot. But 2/3 times I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with this place! Delicious southern food in a relaxed atmosphere. Our waiter Jonathan was very helpful and attentive. A must eat restaurant while in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We had Jonathan as our server and he was great! Very knowledgable of the menu and personable. 
All the food was delicious! my boys loved the shoo mercy pancakes (chicken and sweet potato pancake). All the other food was delicious and did not disappoint. 
My only complaint is they need to move further south to the suburbs! They would be a great addition to south Charlotte/Ballantyne!"}
{"text":"Myself and 5 coworkers were in town for a tourism conference and came by after seeing Tupelo on OpenTable. What  a  treat! The food was creative and tasty, the drinks delicious, and the best part by far was the service from Kimberly. She made sure we had everything we needed and kept us entertained. We will most certainly be recommending this to all of our friends and coworkers."}
{"text":"Always consistent. Great for brunch, and a great place to bring out of town guests. Big fan of the BLET sandwich. Always great service, and who doesn't love the biscuits?!"}
{"text":"I frequent this establishment and typically sit at the bar and enjoy wonderful customer service from the usual two bar tenders. Today there was a new bartender with red hair. Upon walking in she was sitting at the bar eating and i presumed she was a customer. I then saw her go behind the bar. Just an FYI patrons don't  want to see their bartenders, servers, etc eat. It's just not attractive and we always wonder if you washed your hands. We continued to get our food which was DELICIOUS, especially the Brüssel sprouts. The bartender with the red hair then continued to check on us, but not with the same friendly energy as other guests, and very snotty and used language like \"what, huh\" in an i uninviting tone. She also kept putting her hands to her nose ...which was gross. I just didn't feel the same warm energy that's normally at the bar. Other than that everything was awesome. Sorry for the one star but i spend a lot of money here and love good service and energy, and don't like to watch other people receive it and not myself."}
{"text":"Great experience. I got fried chicken and it was cooked just right.. tasted like home cooking. Not as greasy as you usually get while eating out. Server was polite and quick. Excellent place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Great service, Kat the bartender was friendly and made great suggestions along with an awesome old fashioned.  Fried okra was perfect, low country catfish with fried green tomatoes was also great.  Reservations on opentable made it easy to get a spot right when I arrived.  Total was $50ish with tip, which was good imo with top shelf drink, appetizer and entree."}
{"text":"Shoo Mercy Sweet Potato Pancakes. 5 stars. That's it. It's delicious. I've read prior reviews and my guess is some of the lower ones may have been a result of kitchen staff being temporarily off their game or rushing things during peak hours. But the recipe, when done right, is down right delicious. 

And it's sweet potato... so it's good for you right:)"}
{"text":"The best thing about our experience was the coffee. We arrived at 8:07am on Sunday and the place was nearly empty so we thought it would be a quick breakfast. Unfortunately when our food came out 35 minutes later the jalapeno BLT was cold. I'd hate to see the ticket times when the restaurant is packed. Disappointed and probably will not return."}
{"text":"I'm going to be honest...I still don't get all the hype about this place. 

Perhaps, that's why it's taken me so long to come back. However, I came for an event after work and had the opportunity to try some more goodies. 

We started with apps and I tried the tried mason jar dips, okra and honey chipotle wings.  Meh. They were fine, nothing really exciting. 

However, I fell in love with the crispy brussels appetizer. The combination of lemon, garlic and bacon and herbs. Then add the side of ranch. Yummy. I could have eaten those all night long. 

For my meal I ordered the Shoo Mercy sweet potato pancakes. It was a lot of food! Three pancakes, bacon, eggs, fried chicken and grilled fruit. The pancakes were just okay. The chicken was pretty typical and the eggs and bacon were both standard. 

I don't see myself suggesting this place as somewhere I have to visit again. But I'm glad that I did come back and try some additional options on the menu."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a new twist on southern cooking - this is the place! I love their fusion between old and new, and their biscuits are amazing. Their eggs Betty are pretty incredible as well."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch.  This place was booming. Every table was full. Ordered my food, found a spot to sit, and within minutes my food was ready. Staff is super friendly and attentive. My meal was great and a great value too. I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"I want to like you Tupelo... I really do. This review highlights the good and the bad. 

LOCATION
South Blvd, second floor... across from Liberty 

AMBIANCE
Southern chic. The pulley-system fans get me everytime. Love that. Sit outside if the weather is good. 

FOOD
We love their biscuits.... and their jam. Sometimes I wish we could just go in for free biscuits and jam and leave.... (I mean, we'd leave at tip....) 
We hate their chicken anything... mostly because we were served raw chicken. Pink, my friends. Uncooked. Raw. ... then we had to pay for our meal... we paid for our raw chicken. 
Drinks are strong. Be prepared. 

We'll leave you with this - come here for breakfast. Don't order their chicken... or if you do, be prepared to pay for their mistakes."}
{"text":"Simply enjoyable staff, atmosphere and food. Read all the other reviews, this many people can't be wrong."}
{"text":"Shoo mercy sweet potato pancakes, so good! Amazing service, thanks William! Dinner on the porch on a beautiful Charlotte evening can not be beat."}
{"text":"Tasty fried green tomatoes. Great house salad. Nice touch with the honey for the bread of course. Bacon undercooked but all in all a great brunch / lunch spot. Service wasn't good - the place was slammed (and always is) so could add some more staff during the rush. Parking is tough."}
{"text":"My gracious goodness!  I never give five stars but there is absolutely nothing I can complain about or lower rate this establishment.  I am and was duly impressed beyond anything about this place.  I even found out that it is a chain!  Oh my word.  I couldn't believe it when my sister told me.  My husband and I raved and raved about this place to them and they'd already been to one in upstate North Carolina.

The walk up was gorgeous.  They are on the second floor of an old industrial building in a trendy neighborhood that is up and coming.  We took the elevator up because my ankle was still healing y'all.  And what an opening!  The awning was awesome and the outdoor area was filled with awesome decor.  The tables were real wood and the cushions in the chairs were soft.  The colors were springtime and I wanted to sit outside but flies in the South are major.

The hostess greeted us warmly and I had to tell her about the place.  I was impressed.  She told me they were coming to California as well.  So we sat and had t he prettiest waitress.  She was also very knowledgeable about the menu and told me her fave drink.  Score!  Drinks with breakfast is a prerequesite and I was a taker.  I had the Hurricane and the spouse had the other fruity drink.  Both were amazingly good.  Spouse said his was too sweet so I downed that one too.  He did order another drink and was good with that one.

Now the food.  I had the shrimp and grits.  Now I am not one to order this meal from any menu.  As y'all know, I am from New Orleans and a food tasting snob.  Shrimp and grits are not right if not from the Bayou!  But I stand to be corrected.  The meal included andouille and the gravy was savory.  The shrimp were perfectly cooked and they were colossal!  So yummy, yummy in my tummy.  The coffee that the served with the food was awesome as well.  The portion size was Souther huge, of course.  I could not eat it all.  The spouse had the eggs and bacon and sausage.  He loved it.  His home fries were also good as well.  The biscuits looked great too.

Breakfast is wonderful at Tupelo Honey and worth the money!  Go get yours honey!"}
{"text":"Tupelo Honey is just ok in just about every category.  I do like their outdoor seating and the staff is nice but the food is meh.  I'm not in love with their menu and it takes me forever to figure out what to eat there.  The food can be pretty bland and the couple times I've been there came out cold.  The only reason I've been more than once is because it's so conveniently located.  However, it's never my suggestion, I'm always tagging along.  I don't hate it but nothing on the menu will impress you.  Something about everything served seems like it has just been sitting out forever.  No love put in their food here."}
{"text":"I like Tupelo just fine but when I think about eating here, I always shrug and think, \"meh\".  I've been 3 times and the food has been good, but nothing that blows me away.  I've only ever been during the week for lunch or for dinner.  I've never tried brunch because I'm scared of how long the wait would be.  I don't think this is a place I'd return to, however, because 1) there are so many other places just like it 2) I think it's overrated for what is offered 3) I've never really had good service.  Servers have always seemed rushed or over-worked or something and 4) (I'm not an old lady but...) this place is too loud to carry on a conversation. 

Don't get me wrong; give it a try if you're in the area, like fusion-y southern cooking or if you like the original in Asheville.  It might spark your fancy more than mine!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm such a lovely experience. Good drinks. Good food."}
{"text":"I came here with a group to celebrate a friends birthday. There were 5 of us and she was able to make a reservation which is a plus, certainly on Saturday mornings when they are packed. There is a nice outdoor space, but not a lot of parking, so be aware, you may have to circle around a bit to find a space. 

At 11am the place was full. We had a booth in the back near the kitchen. Our waiter took a little bit to come over so by the time he did we had decided on our food. 4 of us decided on the Poutine Scramble, and I got a glass of Brut Champagne which was $7. I'm glad I ordered my drink when I did because the next time we saw our waiter was when we got our food. He brought out the complimentary biscuits with our meal. The timing felt a little off and I think I would have enjoyed more of my biscuit if it came before the meal.

The scramble was a lot of flavors. It comes with eggs, potatoes, cheese, white gravy, bacon (I think because it might be bacon bits), etc. It's a lot. I just think I didn't get gravy on eggs. I was hoping it would work, but it didn't. 

The waiter did refill our glasses 3x which was great because as my husband so lovingly says, I drink water like a camel. I just feel like he was really overwhelmed. 

Based on the reviews of the Asheville location I had high expectations going in, maybe the bar was set a little too high."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants! I grew up in Asheville, where Tupelo Honey originated, so I was excited to see one open in Charlotte now that I live here. Their large, free biscuits are amazing and are the main reason I come here! As a vegetarian, I typically order their veggie burger and it is one of the best I have ever eaten. Their menu recently changed and I don't like that, but they still have some of the good original menu items. Also, their sweet potato pancakes are delicious! I first tried them after seeing Rachael Ray eat them on one of her TV shows. They won't disappoint!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were going to see a concert on last Sunday evening, we decided to try a different place.... needless to say it didn't work out because we waited 15 minutes and were not even acknowledged.  We got up, walked out and walked right into Tupelo Honey to their bar.  Then our night was saved by Bailey!  She was the bartender who took care of us!  Warmly greeted us, gave us recommendations; was just down to earth and personable.  Great service.  That's why we will always come back to our favorites!  Thanks again Bailey!!"}
{"text":"Have been to Tupelo on multiple occasions. Lot of Southern Food and Grilled Cheese Sandwiches! Plus the biscuits with the honey and jam. One of my favorite go to places."}
{"text":"First time visiting Charlotte. We are here for my eldest daughters wedding. William Cain was an unexpected surprise and gave us an exceptional southern experience! Food was pretty good too :-)"}
{"text":"TH used to be a great restaurant with consistently good food and service. Now it is just one of those hyped up, expensive places with food you can get somewhere else, spotty service, limited parking and a long wait. Not worth it, even for the biscuits."}
{"text":"Maggie, our waitress was Amazing!   Our party of 8 was well attended to during our awesome brunch!  We never had a empty glass or anything. She was always assisting us even while hvg a whole section to attend to!  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great Bloody Mary and food. Wicked chicken and shoo mercy pancake breakfast were fantastic. Jonathon our waiter made the experience with his awesome personality and menu knowledge."}
{"text":"I've been to THC in Charlotte twice now and I've been blown away both times.  Once for brunch and once for dinner.  Service is impeccable, food is amazing and the menu is so diverse it's hard to make a decision!

Last night we went out with some friends for a birthday celebration and we were all so impressed with our server (Tiara, aka \"Brussels\" because she loves the brussel sprouts so much) - she was attentive without hovering, proactive and made great suggestions regarding menu choices.  She was also personable, hilarious and extremely accommodating.  I really can't say enough great things about her, but the awesomeness doesn't stop there...

I had the Venerated Veggie Bowl which was a hard decision for me.  THC has WAY more vegetarian options than most restaurants and they all looked fantastic.  The Venerated Veggie Bowl is super creamy grits topped with black eyed peas, fried okra (loads of it) and the most amazing greens I've ever eaten as well as fresh salsa.  Seriously, those greens were out of bounds good.  Our waitress highly recommended the brussel sprouts but I had no room for another side after the awesome pimento cheese appetizer and those to-die-for biscuits with blueberry jam.  OMG, so good.  

My husband had the crab cakes and he said that they were amazing (he considers himself a crab cake aficionado, so take that as huge praise), and my friend had the shrimp and grits, shoo mercy style.  They both couldn't say enough good things about their meals.  I wish we had saved room for dessert or one of the martini specials, but we were STUFFED.  Amazing food, amazing service and a great evening spent with friends.  We will definitely be back to THC, as often as possible."}
{"text":"Anytime I go to Asheville people tell me to eat at Tupelo Honey, but I've never had time to go. So when they opened in Charlotte I was excited to be able to try it. Unfortunately this was my first and last visit.

The service was awful. Before I proceed, I should mention there were many empty tables and booths. We waited for a long time to just get menus. Another lengthy wait before we could order. The food came fairly fast though. The waiter didn't ask if we needed anything, just sat the food down and walked away. My boyfriend ordered a burger with fries, so he wanted ketchup. It was impossible to get the attention of the 5 servers standing behind the bar talking, so I had to get up and get ketchup off an unbussed table. 

While we ordered another table was seated next to us. By the time we got our food they still had not received menus. After I got my own ketchup one of them walked up to the front of the restaurant and picked up her own menus.

The food was pretty tasty. The biscuits with honey and jam were a great little appetizer.  I was told the burger was good, as was the veggie sandwich I ordered. We sat with empty plates for a lengthy time, unable to get a bartender or server to notice us. It took forever for someone to ask if we wanted anything else or just the check. We probably would have ordered another beer, but the restaurant missed out on that. Instead we asked for our check, which again took forever. We left full, but not willing to come back. 

There were so many servers hanging around talking,they were clearly overstaffed. Maybe they would be more attentive to paying customers if there was less time to chat. I honestly think we could have walked away without paying and no one would have noticed. Maybe the Asheville location has better service, but with the abundance of good food in Asheville, they will unfortunately never get my business."}
{"text":"OMG the honey butter croissants!!! PERRRFECT appetizer, entree side item, and dessert.  These are.. Taylor Swift says it best... \"A nightmare dressed like a daydream\".  Love, Love, Love! After I ate one and stared at the remainder planning my next attack, my breakfast pizza was delivered.  The pizza was super good.  I was expecting the eggs to be cooked in the pizza, but instead they are placed on the pizza like a topping. Nevertheless, it tasted very good. Definitely enjoyed the brunch and will be brunching, lunching, or dinnering here again."}
{"text":"Me & some friends went for a night out. We all were extremely hungry. Went up front to reserve a seat but treated us like we were not very important. Waited probably 5 mins and they let the people who just walked in before us. 10 mins later they sat us outside which was nice. No bugs no pollen very clean and nice. Waiter was good but flirty to the point it was very annoying and would make comments on how we should get our food prepared which was uncalled for. Food was AMAZING!!!! 100 STARS!!!! Would only go back for the food not service!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a well run joint. The shrimp and grits were perfect, the hostesses cute, smiling and happy, the server knowledgable and clearly enthused about the menu and everything else. No confusion as to why this place is so popular. I Love Tupelo Honey."}
{"text":"This place is very nice, great sweet tea, awesome biscuits, the best fried okra I have ever had. The shrimp and grits were ok, the shrimp tasted old. Would come back."}
{"text":"I loved Tupelo Honey Cafe when I was in Asheville. I was very excited to see that they brought a location to Charotte, so I wouldn't have to drive all the way to Asheville to get it! I typically get their goat cheese Shrimp and Grits. It is one of the best variations of the dish I have ever had and I am craving it again right now. It was truly unique and delicious. This time however we got biscuits and they were really dry. The nutty chicken was really good though! What was lacking was the service! Hopefully they can get that on point next time. We waited a really long time from waiting to be served once we were seated, waiting for drinks, waiting to give our food orders, waiting to get food, waiting for check. The lunch process took way longer than it should have. The Asheville location is a little better... tend to agree with that one."}
{"text":"What can I say that hasn't already been said? This place is solid on so many levels.

Southern food that can be made gluten free? Check.

Warm atmosphere? Check.

Great cocktail menu that isn't overpriced? Check.

You can go here and find something on the menu for everyone. Their food doesn't feel stuffy or heavy.

I have had one disappointing meal here and to be fair, I was forewarned...making the avocado toast gluten free left the heart a little to be desired. Assuming their portions of avocado doesn't change from regular bread to GF bread, it could have used a little, well, more.

They cut the toast into little slivers, and GF bread is always smaller. One modification would have been to cut the bread into a triangle and have left it. I actually sort of chuckled when it came and I was like, \"wow the server is right, this looks pretty dismal.\" 

Their side salad is one of the best I have had, it isn't pathetic--it's actually gorgeous. Mixed greens with carrots, a beautiful watermelon radish on top. Oh and their blueberry jam. *swoon* I absolutely love smathering this over toast alongside a mug of piping hot coffee.

If you go for brunch...the potatoes. oh my goodness the potatoes. are like this smashed, but still whole, concoction. I loved them. Great flavor, a few bits of crunchy bits mixed in...mmmm yum.

The wait is always incredibly long. And I will say, I won't wait more than probably 20-30 minutes. If you find yourself up early enough on a weekend to visit, make the trip, otherwise, expect upwards of an hour. And while it's really solid, I just don't know what is worth an hour wait.

Love that this place has stayed true to their roots and has expanded over southern cities!"}
{"text":"This was my second trip here, the first one was almost a year ago when it first opened. I wanted to love this place, as everyone else does. That just isn't the case ... Maybe I need to try Tupelo for brunch to get the food experience I've been hoping for. 

I'll start out by saying the food was good ... I just feel that if I'm paying close to $20 for an entree, I want SOMETHING about the meal to pop and make me feel that it's worth my hard-earned dolla-dolla bills y'all. . If anything, I'd say the damn biscuit was my favorite part of the whole meal (they're that good). The nutty fried chicken was very moist, and you definitely get the pine nut taste from the crust. The gravy with it was just so-so, nothing special in my book. The shoestring fries with parmesan & bbq spice sound wayyyyyyyyy better than they actually are.  They ended up being nothing special, just your average fry with a little dusting of seasoning, I actually feel like I wasted a side dish getting the fries. I'd recommend trying something [anything] else. The mac n'cheese ... now that was pretty damn good. It was a tad spicy, maybe from pimento? Definitely pick this as a side no matter what. 

I was able to try bites from my wife's meal: grilled Atlantic salmon with a maple butter glaze served with sides of pine nut edamame salad and cheesy smashed cauliflower. The salmon had a great flavor --- you could definitely taste the maple flavor on the crust. The edamame salad is almost kind of Thai/Asian flavored ... so it's definitely not a good pairing with a traditional southern meal, in my opinion. I though the smashed cauliflower was going to be basically like mashed potatoes, as I've had it other places ... and this was not the case. It was big pieces and that were semi broken into smaller pieces, but definitely not \"smashed\" as you would think. Nothing special in the flavoring of it either, just a cheesy sauce. 

The service here was awesome, our waitress checked back often about refills on drinks, how everything tasted, and if we needed anything else. I would definitely give her a solid 5 stars. She also had her recommendations down pat from every section of the menu if you were unsure of what to go with. I'm looking forward to going back from brunch and hopefully really finding out what all the hype around this place is truly about."}
{"text":"We like Tupelo Honey. That said, we had another not so great 
Again, both of our breakfasts  came out cold
No one refills coffee. We have to wave our arms for refills
After reading all the good reviews, maybe it's us 
You can't see we haven't given them a chance
I think today is Gina be our last day for a while"}
{"text":"We had lunch/brunch here today and it was great! Our server was so helpful and friendly. We were visiting town for a bachelorette party and he gave us tons of advice and recommendations for our weekend too. Do delicious and so much fun! Jonathan was the best!"}
{"text":"Tupelo honey is the best brunch spot! Love to go here for the chicken and biscuits! Add the fried egg! William is the best server! Attentive and fun!"}
{"text":"Took about 5 mins to place drink order at bar table, another 10 to get the drinks brought to our table. This was at 3 pm on Sunday afternoon.  

Biscuits were good- sure wish the honey was on our table like the others but not that big of a deal, I asked the bartender for some.

Husband ordered grilled cheese, I ordered veggie plate. 30 minutes later, we received our food. It should be noted that it was NOT busy at this time.

Food comes: Brussels sprouts- watery and not that good. Mac and cheese- close to box version. Cauliflower was ok. Okra was delicious. Oh yeah, and those four coat $13. Wow 

Hubby's grilled cheese had onions on it - they were hidden and he was not pleased upon finding them. He specifically said no onions . His tomato soup was tasty.

We did pick up a bag of the spiced pecans on the way out. Unfortunately, those didn't compare to spicy, crisp, pecans we received as a gift back in September.  This bag was bland and had way too much honey.

Overall- doesn't even come close to living up to the \"new to Charlotte\" hype. Bummer...

And guys , please refrain from banging on the wall with the cheerwine/ car painting. Really thought both would fall on our table bc someone kept nailing it from the other side."}
{"text":"The decor is sunny and cute. The service is attentive and prices are moderate. The complimentary biscuits are delicious and remind of my late Granny's.  Mmmm to the homemade jam.  A little disappointed in the omelet,for the yummy description did not match the basic presentation. Sweet potato pancake is plate-sized and yummy--we did not need any syrup. Also would like to see some turkey bacon/sausage or chicken sausage ( NC has local farmers who produce) added to the menu since they are big on local ingredients. Heard the coffee is good and will try on a future visit."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch has become a pretty regular thing for my boyfriend and I. The first time we came to tupelo honey cafe our server was very slow and hardly gave us the attention we needed. We learned only after our meal arrived that you are supposed to get complementary biscuits and blueberry jam because they were not delivered until after our meals were delivered which took quite a while. I understand they were busy but I work in the service industry and a manager should have at least come by to speak with us. 

We decided that maybe they had servers call in sick or quit and maybe were understaffed so we have them another try last week. Our server was much better this time around. We each drank the megamosa while we waited for a table with was really delicious. Our server was much better the second time around but the food was still slow to come out. I think they need to figure out how to speed things up in the kitchen and we again didn't see a manager. (Not that there was anything wrong with our food but I didn't see any walking around to any tables and I imagine if they were that busy someone needed a table visit). 

The food was pretty good both times nothing extravagant I would say but we may give them one more chance. For now we will likely stick to some of our other go to's."}
{"text":"SHOOOOO MERCY YA'LL TUPELO HONEY WAS AS GOOOOD AS IT GETS! I came here Sunday after church with my husband and let me tell you I was impressed from the second I walked in! First off, the decor is AMAZING, very clean, staff well dressed, good atmosphere and a beautiful patio! A nice young lady at the front took our name for the wait and she was so friendly, and ya'll it is WORTH THE WAIT. 
After I got sat down at my little table I was browsing over the drink menu and our server Holiday quickly arrived and thank god she did! I was lost in the sauce with all the choices and she quickly and easily guided me around and told me about their award winning bloody mary's! BEST IN CHARLOTTE YALL. Then we had the biscuits. And let me tell you Im going to  thank god in church next Sunday for those biscuits because they are HEAVEEEN. We ordered another round after the first! Holliday was telling me about their SHOO MERCY PANCAKES and they held up to her hype!!  This whole experience was so wonderful were coming back for dinner this week to try some of the other things she recommended! Thank you tupelo honey!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here before dropping my dad off for the airport. I was unsure if the wait was long at 9:30 am, Sunday brunch and all, but we were seated immediately.

Atmosphere was open and inviting at their patio as well as in the restaurant.

Biscuits were insanely good, and free. Dad had the sweet potato pancakes and they were great, with just the right sweetness for the pancake itself. I ordered the shrimp and grits and it was creamy, cheesy, and with the chorizo, had a good kick!

The service made all the difference for my experience though. Carly (If I spelled your name wrong, I apologize) could've been simply standard. However, she was incredibly friendly,attentive (but not annoyingly attentive) to our table, and gave suggestions. She was a multitasking wizard, getting our waters/coffees refilled while also holding conversations with us and the rest of her table. After telling her we were headed to the airport she asked us if my dad wanted a coffee to go for the trip. Gotta say it again, the service really made my time at Tupelo Honey in Charlotte super awesome!"}
{"text":"You've got to love their complementary honey biscuits.  If you don't, no need to continue reading bc you're crazy"}
{"text":"I will move to Charlotte just for this place. The Rosemary peach sweet tea and homemade biscuits and preserves are on point. Amazing southern comfort food. Don't even get me started on the banana bread pudding; you will need two orders, at least."}
{"text":"Service has been awful the past few visits. After waiting forever for our food it came out cold.
Will not be returning for a while."}
{"text":"The food and drinks were delicious. Everything from the cocktails to the steak and eggs; to the sweet potatoe pancakes dish. Yummy. Loved the porch action too!!  Great service. Excellent"}
{"text":"They are resting on their laurels from Ashville. Not bad, but there are better breakfast places in the CLT."}
{"text":"Food was soooo delicious! Perfect portion sizes and very flavorful. My server was Johnathan - he was the best! This wax my first time here and he took the time to explain what made this restaurant the best and different from the rest. He was very accommodating and more than willing to make sure I enjoyed my experience."}
{"text":"Wait was kind of long for the food but they were pretty packed. The food was DELICIOUS and very creatively presented. I will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Wow! Super impressed with the quality considering I had it delivered from like 5-6 miles away.....soooo good! Shoo Mercy pancake with fried chicken is the way to go....but the biscuits & gravy with fried chicken is a close 2nd"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and drinks were just as good!!

I had the shakshura (?). It was amazing! Goat cheese grits were flavorful. You can taste the goat cheese. They were nice and creamy. Avocado was fresh. Cajun sauce was good. 

I had the moonshine Mary..: which is a play off the traditional Bloody Mary. The pickled orca and the bacon were great additions. 

I was more than pleased with the food and the service. I will be back."}
{"text":"The food is incredible, and the staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome.  Been there for breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner and I will continue to be a regular.  Definitely order the shrimp and grits.  It's awesome."}
{"text":"Food was really good and the biscuits and honey is a nice touch. Service was fantastic.  We had a table of 10 and our server handled it without missing a beat.  I ordered the shrimp and grits and it was delicious. Everyone in our group also said that their  food was great."}
{"text":"We've been to Charlotte before, but somehow we missed out on this mug of awesomeness! Thankfully we made it this time. 

This beautiful work of art is called the \"Queen Mary\", appropriate for the Queen City and is the creation of Tupelo Honey, new southern cuisine. It's made with a mix using roasted yellow tomatoes and garlic, Demitri's bloody seasoning, lemon juice and vodka OR moonshine! (go ahead, guess which we chose). Garnished with lemon, lime, pickled okra, a PIMENTO CHEESE stuffed olive, grilled SHRIMP, BACON, but not just any bacon baby, MAPLE PEPPER BACON, celery, asparagus, and a pickled jalapeno! We think an amen is in order.

20 ounces of awesome. The perfect drink for kicking back on the porch, enjoying a nice southern breeze on a warm summer day."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and have always enjoyed the food. However the last time I went with my husband and a friend, we received horrible service. The woman at the check in counter told us the wait would be 20 minutes. 45 minutes later and watching many people who arrived after us be seated, I finally asked when our table would be ready. She informed me that she only had 2-tops available. When I turned around I saw two women who had just walked in be seated at a 4 person table. When I told her of this, she said \"I guess I'll clean off a table.\" I was disappointed in this poor treatment and we received no apology. I don't understand why this happened, but I was incredibly disappointed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"I want to like this place but it just isn't happening. I have been here a few times because the location is great but the food is just ok, at best. If you like heavy, greasy food running through your body then come here. I order a side of sliced tomato. They were obviously a gmo type tomato. It tasted like water and was a low quality. The eggs Benedict was cooked poorly and just wasn't that good. The shrimp and grits that my friend ordered, tasted and looked like a bowl of oil. To me; this place is like a hip Applebees. Definitely better places in Charlotte for Brunch."}
{"text":"The food was amazing! Sweet potato pancakes were perfectly spiced,  fried chicken was crunchy and juicy, fried green tomatoes were tart and sweet and well balanced with the other flavors on the plate,  the bacon was incredible, and don't get me started on how good the honey was on top of a biscuit.  Banana pudding will be something we dream about until we can visit again....it really was that good. Our waitress Bailey was professional.and kind and made great recommendations. This was our first visit...we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I can't speak to other meals, but as far as brunch goes, there are much better, local/non-chain spots than Tupelo Honey. The food is underwhelming and overpriced (26 dollars for shrimp and grits at brunch is ridiculous). Not to mention, Tupelo Honey has the worst coffee I've ever had; it is supposedly Counter Culture coffee, but maybe whoever is in charging of brewing it is using the mop bucket water or something? Not sure. Anyway, explore other options for brunch."}
{"text":"I love the Asheville location, so was excited when we accidentally drove past this place while visiting Charlotte. The giant pecan pancake and biscuits were just as a I remembered them, and I was able to pick up some biscuit mix and tupelo honey to bring back home. Service was a bit slow, but overall pretty good."}
{"text":"So good! First of all, my brother made a reservation online the day before. We pulled up exactly at 12:30pm for lunch, and they were calling him letting us know our table was ready. Perfect! 
Our waiter was very friendly. He was able to accommodate our group of 6 just fine. A few of us ordered mimosas and bloody Marys. Despite how busy the restaurant was, they came out within a few minutes. Those were delicious! (Though, I could just be saying that because I was dining with my parents and they were causing us to drink!) 
A few minutes later, their signature biscuits came out, with the homemade blackberry jam. The jam isn't too tart, and I love how you can still see the little pieces of berry when you got to spread it on your hot, fluffy biscuit. 
For my main course, I ordered the fried chicken BLT. The chicken was perfectly fried. Nice and crispy, with juicy white tender meat inside. The bacon was also crispy-a must with a BLT. My side idea was a small salad, which actually wasn't small at all. It was a good bowlful. The salad contained spring greens, carrots, cherry tomatoes, and pine nuts. I ordered the avocado vinaigrette, which was really good. You should definitely come visit Tupelo Honey!"}
{"text":"Was in Charlotte to watch NCAA Regional Basketball games.  Got up Sunday morning and rode the new transit train south for a couple of stops.  Stepped off and looked up at this joint.   Decided to check it out.  Great brunch.    Great Bloody Mary."}
{"text":"I've been to Tupelo Honey in Asheville and Raleigh and always had great experiences. Today I had brunch at the Charlotte location and was less than impressed. 

We had a party of 6 and our reservation was at 12:30. We waited quite a while past 12:30 to be seated, but we didn't mind that so much because they comped us two appetizers for the inconvenience. 

The appetizers were great. We got the fried green tomatoes and avocado toast points. My entree wasn't great. I had the Old Skool breakfast bowl, sub scrambled eggs for over easy. My friend ordered the same bowl and had different modifications. When our meals arrived (after a lengthy wait) my scrambled egg bowl had her modifications, and her bowl had over easy eggs but no modifications. This was pointed out to our server. It wasn't a huge deal but since we didn't get what we ordered, a discount might have been appropriate. The bowl itself was sort of flavorless and the grits were dry. 

The service was not what I would expect. Our waitress didn't know anything about the drink I ordered (lavender limeade which was delicious by the way). It took a long time to get our food (not the server's fault) and an absurdly long time to get our checks. 

I don't think I would return to this location, but would happily return to Asheville or Raleigh!"}
{"text":"I enjoy coming to Tupelo due to laid back atmosphere. Food is consistently good along with service. The only downside is that their brunch menu is pretty limited."}
{"text":"I'm so sad to say that I had a disappointing experience here. I have heard such great things about Tupelo Honey and was excited to stop in for brunch. 

My first impression was that the place was so cute! Very southern atmosphere with rocking chairs on the patio where you can wait to be seated. They also have the absolute most gorgeous menus I have ever seen. 

We were visiting from out of town and came here to try get the epic shrimp and grits (which were good but very heavy). I also ordered the Eggs Benedict. It took a very long time for our food to come which is to be expected on a busy brunch Sunday. However, when the food did come it was cold and had no hollandaise sauce. The situation could have been salvaged but due to the poor & apathetic service we left feeling unsatisfied and annoyed."}
{"text":"Third time was not a charm. After several fair to good experiences here we were very disappointed in the service and kitchen at Tupelo. Overcooked fried chicken and a undersized dry bbq rib entree of just 3 ribs were not home runs. Waiter's response of \"I just work here\" was pretty weak also. All in all we probably wouldn't return due to the long wait for food from the kitchen, mediocre food and indifferent service."}
{"text":"A southern restaurant without the southern charm. Great food but ridiculous that on a Monday night the hostess would not seat us in a booth after we requested to sit there (my pregnant wife and my two 75 year old parents). See photos. Reason was booths are reserved for 6 people. We only had 4. Also, most restaurants take your used silverware after biscuits and apps. The waitress here says you should keep your silverware...so I laid my jelly covered fork and knife on the table. Hmm. Get some southern charm and hospitality to match your food. 

UPDATE: The manager replied with a nice email and to correct the problem. Manager agreed we should have never been told we couldn't eat at the booth with 4 people. Thank you for your response!"}
{"text":"If I could rate this place with no stars I would. I don't know if they were just having an off day but waiting an hour for overpriced and mediocre food to be delivered to our table with lackluster enthusiasm are not traits of an establishment I care to frequent.

I paid $21 for 4 meager strips of steak in my \"Steak and Eggs\" - I've had more steak in a budget burrito at Taco Bell.  The half of a potato worth of a side was laughable too; laughable by the ownership I'm sure when they realize they are taking in a 150% profit off of screwing people out of an entree. I can't help to feel a little ripped off.

All of our eggs which were to be poached ended up being mostly underdone, my moms \"fried green tomato\" sandwich had red tomatoes, our drinks went unfilled for long periods of time, and zero f***ks were given by our waitress. 

Never. Again."}
{"text":"After trying this place in Asheville, was super delighted to see a location in Charlotte. Always such great food, and not to mention the great cocktails too!"}
{"text":"Great little place hardly seen from the road but well worth trip to inspire the mind."}
{"text":"OMG! they close at 3:15-4pm on Saturday. During that time you can only purchase apps and drinks. I was starving so naturally at 3pm today, I was not a fan of the non-apologetic hostess who shared the bad news. This was especially disappointing since I did check yelp before driving over with my tummy set on some yummy food. Yelp indicated the hours as 11am-11pm. .......please tell people they cannot eat a sit down meal between 3:15pm -4pm on Saturday.
So........I have no food pic to share."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of brunch spots in Charlotte and wanted to try Tupelo Honey based off the reviews. My first experience was not good, food and service was less than subpar based on the prices. I got the avocado toast and eggs which was literally a thick slice of cold bread and cold avocado spread, some useless greens and eggs (scrambled, which were good). Had reservations at 11:15am sat at 11:20am, food came at 12:14pm. We had to summon our waitress after no one came to take drink orders after almost 10 minutes. Ordered the mimosas which took 20 minutes to get. This place is over priced and the only reason I'm giving them 3 stars is the manager did apologize for the service and provided a comp meal for my breakfast since I didn't eat it. Oh the blueberry champagne pancakes were super good and saved me from walking out hungry. Sign up for the email list and they are free."}
{"text":"My wife has been to the TH's in Asheville several times, but I had never been to any of their restaurants. We ended up going to this one in Charlotte for breakfast. My wife observed that the one in Asheville gave each table a basket of their biscuits, but this one gave each of us one measly biscuit and didn't offered us more. That was kind of disappointing. My wife also indicated that the one in Asheville served the food with a signature flower, but none was offered at this location. The food was very good all in all. But, the coffee was absolutely horrible! When I told the waitress that it was incredibly strong (I mean unbelievably so!) and bitter, she explained that it was a Peruvian blend and even she, who liked strong coffee, couldn't handle what they served. This is ridiculous. This restaurant needs to offer a more subtle blend. I doubt most people would like their coffee. Bottom line is that we'll be back there for breakfast, but TH's CLT does have some shortcomings."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant - the service was excellent and while I wanted the Sweet Potato pancake, they offered an off-menu option of fried-chicken breast with the pancake to have a more \"chicken and waffles\" feel.  The entire meal was fantastic - don't forget to have a homemade biscuit with the blueberry jam - wow!!"}
{"text":"Went to Tupelo Honey when I had a few friends in town. Very cute, casual, comfortable atmosphere. The host was very friendly and we were seated right away.

We all ordered drinks to start. Honeysuckle lavender flip, pretty drink with a cute name that basically tasted like vodka lemonade. Not a bad thing just nothing special. Sangria was tasty but had so much pulp and fruit pieces, it was too much. Margarita, I wouldn't suggest.

As for food, we started with the fried green tomatoes. This is not my favorite appetizer regardless of the restaurant but, TH does them pretty well. Thick tomato slices with a good crunch served with grits. For entrees we had shrimp and grits, fried chicken, sweet potato pancakes, salmon, and sides of mac n cheese and Brussels. Everything came with very large portions and everything was good but nothing was great. Out of all the dishes I think the shrimp and grits had the best flavors going. We also ordered the s'mores cake for dessert. Don't bother, dessert was a let down. 

Service was very friendly all around but also very slow. I'd go back, just wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Wonderful,  causal food with excellent waite staff!  I briefly watched the kitchen staff (the restaurant has an open view kitchen) and it was well run, smooth operation. They produced excellent fresh and delicious food,  quickly."}
{"text":"Trying different Southern comfort food spots in Charlotte can be a hit or miss. Tupelo Honey Cafe is definitely a hit! Absolutely delicious. I'm full and still have food to take home. The portions will not leave you disappointed or hungry.

We came at 7pm on a Saturday and was seated right away by a warm and friendly Hostess. Our waitress was plesant and helpful with making a choice and our water glass was never empty.

The Menu isn't overwhelming with too many options but just the right amount to make a great selection. I had the Shoo Pancake served with bacon, candied pecans, warm maple syrup, and a crisy, absolutely delicious, boneless chicken breast. BTW, the Pancake is HUGE and it's sweet potato. I am sooooo happy right now! 

The sweet potato pancake taste like sweet potatoes! Not some food coloring or spice but an actual sweet potato  the only dislike was my bacon. I love my bacon well done, extra crispy, a little Cajun, lol.  Although it wasn't bad I just wish it was crispy. This dish is not overly sweet; it was a great balance of sweet and salty. 

My Husband had the Fried Chicken with the brussel sprouts and fried okra. You can choose your own sides and they have yummy selections. It was two pieces of boneless fried chicken breast with yummy gravy over it. The Biscuit that comes out before your meal with the blueberry perseve is delicious. The right amount of crunch on the outside while being moist on the inside.

I will definitely be back to try other dishes. The price is right, the place is warm and the staff is friendly. I'm definitely bringing friends back with me."}
{"text":"I have been here plenty times and loved my food and service. This Morning my husband and I came for brunch and this will definitely be my last time coming. Our waitress Julie was HORRIBLE! I've never seen someone with a such a rude attitude serving in a restaurant in my life. My husband asked her about our food because it was taking a very long time and she stated she did know know she needed to explain why our food was taking so long to come out and then rolled her eyes... The food was dried and burned and we had to send it back... Will never come back even thought the manager apologized and fixed it! He was the plus!"}
{"text":"Glad my friend found this place! Food and service good. Tip: no waiting in bar area, if table available, grab it and enjoy.  I had the Appalachian Breakfast,  hearty meal go hungry if you eabt to try."}
{"text":"This place is really busy! I would definitely suggest a reservation for any sized party. 
I came for a bachelorette brunch. Their mimosas are HUGE. 
We started with the fried green tomatoes with goat cheese grits. The tomatoes were not greasy at all. The breading was light and flavorful. I didn't particularly like the grits (the texture in general off puts me not this specific establishment's dish) but the other girls devoured it! 
I got the fried chicken sandwich with a side salad (no dressing). This was fantastic. The chicken (like the green tomatoes) were perfectly breaded and fried. The salad was crisp and I loved the radish on top. 
This dish (like the rest) were huge. I finished the rest for lunch!"}
{"text":"Southern Food with a modern edge.

I haven't tried all the different items here, but the catfish salad was really amazing and I always thought I hated catfish. 

My friends had the fried chicken and it looked SO GOOD. They enjoyed it.

The patio is really nice for summer days. They are upstairs, but there IS an elevator for guests who don't do stairs, just go around underneath the stairs and you will see it. So bring Nana.. she will like it.

Very casual, but yet not a dive at all. You get a very modern posh feel from a very casual space. Good vibes."}
{"text":"This place has good food, and a good variety to choose from. I love the biscuits with honey and fresh jam. They do have some items on the menu they could do without - one being the ham wontons and sprout salad. I feel the service is always a lacking. Each visit I feel like i am looking for the waiter when I need something. But overall the food has been good and filling. Kind of pricey, but hey I am not going every day. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Sweet sweet southern soul food. A chain with great choices. The butter for those biscuits is"}
{"text":"I loved the atmosphere and the upstairs dining. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by two young hostesses. The two young ladies were pleasant. Then Hailey comes, she takes a look at us, and tells one of the hostesses something. The young lady directs us to a table where two people are already seated. They get up and we're told here's your table! I'm like...what?! What just happened here? I asked the hostess why was the other couple leaving, and why are you putting us here? She's a bit clueless and assumes they wanted to sit elsewhere. And my guess is, soooo you keep the plates, fork and knives here, that were here with the previous couple and plop me and my nephew here...cause we look like you can treat us that way hmmm?! I asked the hostess who told you to seat us here...she said Hailey. I gave her the look (some of you may know the look, some may not. It was that look!) and I responded with, \"Hailey is Her Name?!\" I guess word got back to Hailey, who then came back, and sat me and my nephew someplace else. 
Now that that's over, we sat down at another table, our server came by who was very pleasant and on top of her game! Holiday was her name. We started off with non-alcoholic drinks, segued to our delicious appetizers, and then onto our main course! I absolutely enjoyed our food, I cannot say one bad thing about the entire meal! I do want to return. I honestly don't ever want to feel like you can look at me, and judge me as if I'm not used to fine dining! Not a good feel or good look for any establishment! I would've given 5 stars, but Haileys behavior was unacceptable!"}
{"text":"I tried their lunch menu and their breakfast menu. Both are OK but I am not sure what all the raves are about. Maybe I am missing a subtlety that only a Southern palate can appreciate. If in the neighborhood give it a try; it seems to be kid friendly and on weekends there are lots of young families enjoying breakfast."}
{"text":"The food and service are equally as amazing!!! I love this place anytime! From their dinner menu to their Sunday brunch!! Go on in and find out for yourself....you'll be pleasantly surprised!!"}
{"text":"Upscale southern cooking with a creative menu that changes constantly. The prices are high, knocking one star off. The interior and exterior decoration and seating is very well done, and comfortable. Come prepared for a wait, both weekdays and weekends alike."}
{"text":"I know a TON of people who love this place. I am not one of them. I have been for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and have always just had mediocre meals. Plus, the service is kinda slow."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar with a friend... The service was excellent! Make sure you ask for Tiara or Kayla. Busy Friday night and neither of them skipped a beat. If you're into sitting at the bar i definitely recommend doing so. It was like dinner plus a show with all the crafty cocktails. Food was good, too! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to come here for so long and now I'm mad that it has taken me so long. 

I went to Tupelo Honey during lunch last week and was awed by the architecture and atmosphere of the building, particularly the deck and the rustic bricks. We were seated immediately and ordered some appetizers! We got fried green tomatoes and Brussels sprouts. ALSO - I could eat those biscuits with fresh jam and honey FOREVER (best thing about the south). The fried green tomatoes were crispy and flavorful and served on a bed of grits which were so good we were just eating them off the plate when they were leftover. The brussel sprouts were also cooked and seasoned to perfection. 

For my lunch, I ordered the fried chicken sandwich which was served stifling hot and fresh. I would recommend asking for more of the Dijon mustard to top off the sandwich. By this point in the meal, I was not super hungry, but I did enjoy this sandwich immensely. 

I would definitely come back here and am ready to try one of their infamous brunches!!"}
{"text":"This WAS one of our favorite places to eat.  We just left without ordering after looking at the new menu.  All of our favorite foods were dropped off their menu.  We ended up paying for our 2 teas. $6.50 for 2 small teas is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Southern charm. Creative food choices. I like it!

I stopped in for lunch and had several appetizers and beers. Before I say anything else, HAVE THE BISCUITS. (They serve warm biscuits with tupelo honey and jam.... soooo good.) 

Fried green tomatoes are good. Wasn't too crazy about the fried Brussel Sprouts. Our server Taylor was friendly and knowledgeable. The actual space/location are nice too. I'd recommend this place and would return. The environment is casual and fun. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"Very cute theme and super good vibes, but I came in with great expectations and high standards! There are over 800 reviews and they balance with 4 stars. The food was just simply OK. I got the Wicked Chicken Sandwich and it came out drenched in the spicy oil. DRENCHED. My bun was soggy which is a no-no, causing the oil to take over the whole thing making it extremely spicy as it was condensed into everything. I got the rosemary peach lemonade also and I don't know how I feel about the combination. It was definitely a kick. The lavender limeade was good though! Service was also just OK. The only thing that was great was the ambience."}
{"text":"It wasn't bad. Service was a tad bit slow, but it was expected seeing my group went on Saturday around 12. The portion sizes were abysmal given the prices. I ordered the fried chicken and biscuits with a \"mega mimosa\". The food was very good, but it was literally in what I felt was a cereal bowl ($16). Nothing about my mimosa said \"mega\", but the price ($11). I ended up spending $35 on what I felt would lead me the Chick Fil A down the street next. I'm not saying I wouldn't be back, but I know when I make my next appearance, I won't be as caught off guard by spending almost $40 on brunch."}
{"text":"The food was ok,but the service was terrible. Took the food over an hour to come out and we were there pretty early.....got a free appetizer for the trouble and a couple coupons to use when we came back,but I doubt we will ever go back. The waiter was terrible and I didn't leave a tip,and always leave something even when the service is sub par,but this was worse than that"}
{"text":"We went this past Saturday expecting a long wait me and my cousin went early to put our name in and turned out there was no wait! They seated us right away and then the men took longer to meet up with us than expected! Although this could be a huge nuisance for our server, William, he didn't act annoyed at all and took GREAT care of us! Checked in often, offered us drinks and refills, and when we asked for appetizer recommendations he was super helpful! Thanks William for taking great care of us and being so patient and helpful!! 

Oh yeah, and all the food was amazing! We had the French toast with blueberry appetizer while waiting for the guys. Highly recommend it! Their biscuits for the table are always a huge hit and since it was basically lunch time by the time the rest of the party joined us we got the Brussels to munch on and I have to say, I loved them!! 

Great brunch all around!!"}
{"text":"Tupelo Honey's frozen rose (frose) is amazing. Must try. Love love love. Hailey, the bar staff and others were fab. Must try the biscuits- totally worth the calories."}
{"text":"Best biscuits and honey in town! Make sure to come early to avoid the crowds. The staff are friendly and quick once you are seated"}
{"text":"Overall nice for brunch. If you are a smaller party make sure you get everything you need id you notice your server may have a larger party to support. That's the only con I have. Food was great, and the location is great as well."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday today. My server, Alex, was wonderful. Nice attitude, funny, and prompt. Had the egg rolls and goat cheese appetizers. They were delicious. For main meal, had the sweet potato and chicken entree. Again, fabulous. My first time here but won't be my last."}
{"text":"I took some out of town guests here for lunch, and was so excited to try it. However, I found the menu to be quite limited and the food was mediocre, although the biscuits were very good. The restaurant itself is cute, and we dined on the balcony, which was nice, but I doubt I'll be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Buttery, warm out of the oven biscuits fall apart in your mouth and not in your hand; accompanied by a simple preserve that lacks the overbearing sweetness of most that covet it's appearance. 

Fried green tomatoes that find the difficult sweet spot between toothsome and mushy with a batter that clings on for dear life allowing one to enjoy both the crisp crunch and buttery softness that the treat should provide. Set atop of a bed of grits, the red pepper coulis adds brightness and interest to a dish that begs for a spatula scrape or a brownie spoon lick at the end. 

The sweet potato pancake, if just a tad bit on the dryer side, is accompanied by near perfectly cooked fried chicken and a maple pepper bacon that adds to the complexity to the dish. 

The heaping 26 dollar portion of Shoo Fly Shrimp and Grits loads every bite with shrimp, so much so that they I believe this to be the first time I've ever taken home a shrimp dish with shrimp to be had. The spicy mix of peppers and mushrooms flavors the dish well, and I order chorizo on the side expecting crushed or cubed pieces, but instead get large moderately thick slices of the dark red spicy meat. 

Pork egg rolls have the appearance of being hastily rolled and are a bit too greasy for my liking. The only thing I would not be back for. 

Service is kind and warm. The hostess provides a level of southern charm that starts the meal on a very high note."}
{"text":"Date of Visitation: 11/12/2017 around 6:00pm
Reason: Friendsgiving Dinner
Cost of meal: $58.46

(i) Two (2) seasonal mule DFT - These were alright. I wish they had a more prominent alcohol taste, but the pumpkin flavor did come through. I was just disappointed they didn't have what was displayed on the menu. 

(ii) Fried Green Tomatoes - These were alright as well. The tomatoes were a little TOO tart and the breading was (slightly) falling off of the tomato especially if you added any kind of sauce/aioli to it. 

(iii) Seared Southern Scallops - For the price that it was, it could have been better. Also, the scallops were a bit too charred on both sides and the presentation was kind of sloppy. All of the colors were kind of murky, brown, darkish, but the flavor made up for it. I've had some amazingly clean tasting scallops and this didn't hold up to my standard, They did give enough of everything else on the plate, but the main attraction wasn't prominent. 

Decor - Very nice, southern, hometown but (medium) upscale kind of feel. Well decorated and there's PLENTY OF SPACE both inside & outside to accommodate (bigger) parties. 

Service - Pretty good. I don't have any complaints besides the way she took our orders and the timing of bringing out everyone's food. My friend asked for no blue cheese crumbles on her $20 steak salad and they loaded it with them. 

One thing I can say about Tupelo Honey Cafe (THC) is that they have some of the BEST HAPPY HOUR SPECIALS especially in NC. 

--TrizzyO_o"}
{"text":"I came to THC on recommendation from a co-worker.  I had a friend from out of town so I decided to take her here.  I was not disappointed.  From the very cute decor, and the friendliness of the staff.  The food was great, my friend has gluten issues, so having the GF menu was perfect.  I had the chicken sandwich with the pickled beets, delicious!  I had never had Pimento cheese before (I'm not originally from the South) so I gave it a try.  I was not disappointed. I will definately be visitng again."}
{"text":"Ribs fell off of the bone. No kidding. Collared greens could use a bit more Cajun and onion, but still very good. My mac and cheese had crispy cheese bits...BONUS!"}
{"text":"As always the food is fresh and service is off the hook. You can tell when an establishment has passion in good food. It tickles down into the amazing service and food cooked with love. 

A  must if you are in Charlotte for foodies beware you need to get here early or make a reservation as there is always a line.

Be sure to ask for Johnathan he will make the dining experience worth it. He describes the food and drinks with such skill pictures will appear in your head."}
{"text":"Had a phenomenal meal here with six friends while visiting Charlotte. The food was fantastic and our server, William, was great! He was very knowledgeable and fun. Planning to to return and, hopefully, William will be our server again!"}
{"text":"Fun place...get the Rainbow Trout! Very reasonably priced and some nice microbrews on tap."}
{"text":"Finally made it here to get some brunch.  I've been in a Flying Biscuit rut and needed to try these biscuits.  
I entered and said party of 1 and they shooed me to the bar.  The place was empty and I like being offered a table.  After I sat down at the bar the hostess came back over and said I could pick a table in the bar area, I didn't have to sit at the counter.  Too late.  The counter had a chilled channel in it which was awesome for keeping drinks cool.
I go to Flying Biscuit a lot because they don't serve pork and I don't eat pork so I knew I'd have to pay attention to the menu more.  The chicken and biscuits sounded nice, or maybe the vegetarian options of the day.  The chicken and biscuits was covered in milk gravy and I know in many parts of the US biscuits and gravy is served with sausage gravy.  I asked the bartender if the gravy had any sausage or anything and he said no.  I didn't get the full ingredient list so maybe it has lard or bacon drippings, but definitely didn't taste like bacon so I'll believe it was pork-free.

I was served a biscuit with the jelly and of course honey.  I skipped the honey but used the jelly.  The biscuit is a completely different type than a Flying biscuit.  It reminded me more of a KFC biscuit, but fresher.  I devoured it.

When my meal came it was delicious and exactly what I expected.  breaded and fried chicken breast in a heart shape served over 2 biscuits with white gravy. It was too much after already eating another biscuit.

The bar had many taps including all the local players as well as microbrews.  I was working when I ate there so I didn't get to try a bloody mary, but hopefully I will make it back soon to try it out.

I know I mentioned Flying Biscuit a lot.  Really the two are quite different aside from the fact that both restaurants consider a biscuit to be their signature."}
{"text":"My first time here was AMAZING!! I sat at the bar as there is a big rush during lunch hours and had a wonderful experience.  I ordered the Appalachian Bounty Scramble which contains all-natural pasture-raised Hickory Nut Gap Farm sausage, blueberries, arugula, kale and Havarti cheese.  It also comes with a side of toast and carrot and kale slaw. It was delicious! I devoured the entire plate in addition to the biscuit and homemade jam that is served at the beginning of your meal. 

I recently brought my parents here, as I was raving about this place. I would be giving this place 4/5 stars, however, the service was sub par.  This time I ordered the Big Honkin' veggie burger with the homemade potato chips and asked for no onion (of course onion came on it). My dad ordered an omelette and my mom ordered the Appalachian Bounty Scramble with the sausage on the side as she does not eat meat, but I was going to eat it. Inside of no sausage it came with DOUBLE sausage, which was incorrectly inputed by our waitress. She haphazardly apologized and took her meal away. Upon bringing her the correct item, she brought her food out piecemeal...one plate with the scramble sans sausage, and then a small plate with a tiny amount of slaw and the grilled toast.  I don't think that the waitress should have taken the item off of the bill but at least offer us free drinks or a dessert. I was extremely disappointed in how she handled the situation.  Hopefully Tupelo will be better next time."}
{"text":"Stopped by this restaurant for lunch with my family before spending the day in Charlotte. We sat outdoors and had a very comfortable lunch. Our server, Aleesha (sp?), was welcoming and provided us with great service. When I asked her what she thought about the biscuits and gravy with fried chicken, she replied that everything on the menu is really good. After seeing how pleased my family was at the end of our meal, I realize that she wasn't lying.

Our meal started off with homemade biscuits with a side of blueberry compote. These biscuit were so delicious! Soft and fluffy with a nice outer crust. My meal of biscuits and gravy was perfection! It was perfectly seasoned and prepared, it was a true comfort meal and one of the best I had. If you come here, I highly suggest it. The rest of my family had the southern belle grilled cheese, fried chicken BLT, okra, side salad and Mac and cheese. Other than the okra (which was amazing) I didn't try anyone else's food but everyone was thrilled with their meals. 

We also had the lavender limeade fizz and and rosemary peach lemonade a which were so delicious! The fizz was a bit too sweet for me but nothing that a few lime wedges could fix.

Overall, we were extremely pleased with this restaurant and would come back in a heartbeat when visiting Charlotte."}
{"text":"Our first stop during our recent visit to Charlotte and it kicked off the weekend to a great start!! They give you complimentary biscuits as soon as you sit down. It came with a side of amazing berry jam and honey. The biscuits were one of the best ones I've ever had! It was perfectly buttery, soft on the inside and had a savory kick to it. We also got some sweet tea which came with free refills!

We ordered the fried chicken and biscuits as well as the shrimp and grits. Both were absolutely delicious!! The chicken was very crispy and tender. The shrimp was savory.

If you check in on Yelp, you get a 10% discount! This must be a new deal because our waitress had no idea how it worked and it took an extra 10 minutes of going back and forth with the manager to get the discount. Still worth it!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Always great service but they sometimes appear to have one too many tables. Expect a wait on the weekends but it's totally worth it. I love the eggs Benedict's and the potatoes. The biscuits and jam are also amazing and complimentary! Parking can be tough but it's right off the light rail so I would suggest biking or riding the rail!"}
{"text":"It had been a while since my last trip to Tupelo, so I decided to check out their brunch with a friend.  I am glad there was a table open in the bar area as I am not sure it was worth the 40 mins quoted for the dining area.  

The servers were great, attentive and upbeat!!

If you go, you must get the fried green tomatoes.  They are consistently amazing, even during brunch.  Always well seasoned, hot & crispy.

You should also try the mega mimosas as they are worth the $$!

However, you can pass by the gulf coast lump crab benedict.  Of course the biscuit and the potato cracklings were great.  But you will not miss out if you never try the the hollandaise sauce and the sprinkle of crab that make the dish."}
{"text":"We have been here for bunch before and it's been a year since we have been back. We started with Bloody Mary's and it was a long time before we received them. We had the Blueberry French toast with Pork belly, the French toast was basically bread. The center was uncooked chullah bread.The pork belly was very tasty. The Eggs Benedict was excellent, the Avocado Toast and Eggs was very good, the avocado had a slight spice to it. 
Overall the food was good, the service was very slow, we sat for 15 minutes for our waitress to come back to our table. I may go back but not for a while"}
{"text":"greasy, cold, flavorless... 

gluten free options but the waitstaff is clueless... here's a clue-my health depends on you knowing what your serving me! and then she puts a biscuit down in front of me! holy crap! When I asked the manager if the waitstaff is allergy trained he said they were and mentioned \"gluten is a big one right now\", HUH? I am talking about an allergy, not the latest food trend you MORON! 

never again! lesson learned!"}
{"text":"I've had great service here and I've had poor service here.  The food is pretty good, the shrimp and grits are very spicy, the veggie melt is heavenly, and the biscuits with berry jam is so special I could eat them daily.  That being said, the hit or miss service will probably keep me away for awhile.......hopefully when I decide to return they will have the service issues corrected."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review with I promise I'm not a critical person! Look at my other reviews to see more positivity. I moved to Charlotte this week and woke up excited for my first weekend brunch #basic. I had been to Tupelo honey in Asheville a few years ago and remembered LOVING it. Sadly, this experience left me disappointed and I will definitely not go back. We got there at 9am and we were sat next to the kitchen/servers station. While I understand you have to make the most of your space, this was literally the worst seat in the house and no reason to seat us there with a third of the seats being empty. Moving onto the food....the javos rancheros was cold and unappetizing. The whole restaurant had a sterile and corporate feel. Nothing like what I experienced in Asheville. To put the final nail in the coffin, the server dropped the check off MINUTES after we received our food with plates and drinks barely touched. Poor form. With all the great food options in this city I will not be returning and I can't figure out why it has such great reviews."}
{"text":"Service was good. Food is delicious!  Large portions.  The biscuits with honey are definitely a sweet touch. Atmosphere  was excellent ."}
{"text":"Excellent food, pleasant staff, and wicked fast service. We'll definitely be coming here for many future brunches!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with happy hour at TH. The food is good, and some of the drinks are good. 
I think TH surpasses its competitors with its service. Every time I have gone, the staff hav been great. Last time we went, Bailey took really good care of us. She was attentive, made sure our glasses and our bellies were full."}
{"text":"We stopped at Tupelo Honey after traveling cross country to finally arrive in Charlotte. I mentioned to our waiter Kimberly that I had missed southern food and wished I could eat an order of fried green tomatoes but knew it would be too much. The biscuits that are brought to the table are light and fluffy.  When she came back to take out order she had 2 fried green tomatoes and said \"welcome back!\" How thoughtful!! I ordered the Spanish omelet and it was amazing and full of flavor. My hubby had the chicken BLT and it was crispy and juicy. We will absolutely be back!! Great service and fantastic food!! Kimberly rocks!"}
{"text":"Tupelo Honey isn't what I remember it to be. We arrived for a Saturday brunch mid morning, early afternoon and found  the bar mostly empty. We decided to grab a seat at the bar for convenience. There was one bartender behind the bar, who seemed more than a little irritated that we decided to sit there. She was busy making all of the drinks for the remainder of the restaurant, and wasn't able to provide the best customer service to the customers sitting at the bar (it steadily got busier over the course of our visit). 

Tupelo has a decent selection of Mimosas and Bloody Marys, which was by far the bright spot of our visit.  I've eaten here a few times in the past, and always remembered a broad selection of standard breakfast fare, as well as some more interesting plates to choose from. It seems now that the entire menu is trying too hard, for lack of a better phrase. I ordered the Appalachian breakfast, and my other guest ordered the hash. Both of our plates came out with cold eggs. 

With so many different places to choose from to eat brunch with consistent service and at least better (hotter) food, I'm going to scratch Tupelo off the list for now."}
{"text":"Sunday Funday pre-game brunch! Now that the brunch bill had passed, I revel in early mimosa drinking in Sunday's. Came to Tupelo Honey for a pre Panther's game brunch with 2 friends. We actually made a reservation on Open Table becuase we knew it would get packed quickly and it did. Btw if you didn't get the clue, you can make a reservation on Open Table. When we arrived, we were seated immediately. We ordered a round of mimosas and every single time I order a mimosa here, I forget that they use fresh orange juice and it has the pulp. I'm not a fan of pulp but I drank it anyway. They brought us the delicious biscuits and I drizzled honey on mine. I ordered the BLT chicken sandwich with a side of the goat cheese grits. Their grits are so creamy and delicious with the goat cheese. The chicken sandwich is good. I subbed the dijon mustard for the cranberry bbq sauce. The sauce is a bit tart bc of the cranberries but I like it. I love Tupelo Honey and visit often."}
{"text":"Service was good and they have a berry drink that is really good.  The jam on the biscuits is delicous."}
{"text":"These folks are great. Not only did they take steps to apologize for something that wasnt really their fault, they produced yet another delicious meal (three actually). Went back for another dinner, the club was notably quieter and the 'thud' of base wasnt noticeable. Overall a really great place and living up to their reputation in scores! thanks for taking care of my mom on her birthday."}
{"text":"Brunch is always incredible at Tupelo. Starts with the biscuit with honey and continues to the Mega Mosa's. Add fried chicken with biscuits smothered in ham gravy (and of course hot sauce) and you have yourself the start to a successful weekend! When you get severed by William you will be laughing and receive your delicious plate in no time. Truly a pleasure every time we come here. The staff, food, and overall atmosphere is what keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"Food is great but when I went there today i counted 11 tables open, 2 other couples waiting for Seats and they had a 45 minute wait. Whoa! Something on the front end needs work"}
{"text":"It was decent food but I think it's a little hyped.  I sat at the bar.  No chance would I have ever waited 1.5-2 hours for breakfast/Saturday brunch.  We asked for a couple of things off the menu that the bartender recommended only to find out they were out of a couple of the main ingredients and couldn't offer us the entrée. 

Somewhat pricey and way too much of a wait for me."}
{"text":"I got the ol'skool bowl. It was very tasty. It had alot of different flavors. The mimosas were also really good. I didn't care for the biscuits this time around but I do appreciate the fact that it comes with every meal (I think)"}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour. We ordered some drinks, a few small bites, and two entrees. One of the entrees came out wrong, was brought back out with the wrong side (a side that neither of us would ever eat or order at any restaurant,  in fact we loathe it so we were certain we hadn't ordered it), but it was quickly remedied. We weren't mad about this, it happens.  Drinks were delicious but the mule we ordered was charged at full price instead of happy hour price... hence the 3 stars. At this point I had already paid and didn't want to point out any more faults, so we just left. But please, for the sake of offering happy our specials (especially in NC where drink specials legally have to be offered all day), make sure they ring in correctly."}
{"text":"Our family visited Charlotte and we ate dinner at Tupelo Honey Cafe for my sister's Law School Graduation. The restaurant is located on the second floor (which you can take the stairs or elevator), and it is also located across the street from the Fire Station which is very odd.

The server was kinda in a pissed off mood (and a I don't care attitude) towards the beginning, but once during he wrote down our orders his mood changed.

I ordered a \"Mountain Pulled Pork Sandwich\" but oddly enough I got a \"Bone-In Porterhouse Pork Chop\" instead.. too many pork items on the menu maybe? He said that he would change it for me once I brought him about this issue, but I wasn't that picky so I sticked with it and ate it. The Pork Chop was great and juicy, but I kinda wished I ate the Mountain Pulled Pork Sandwich.

The restaurant overall is great, and when it comes to ownership. I think both the owner and manager roaming the restaurant helping tables are both great and friendly.

Note: Tupelo Honey Cafe gets really cold. So be prepared to bring a sweater or a jacket with you when you enter."}
{"text":"This is the only place I wanted go on Friday.  We walk in and are seated immediately; which was awesome...no wait.  Our hostess seats us in a quaint corner and we wait, and wait, and wait.  While watching other tables get served before us, odd but true.  I go back to the hostess and inform that we are still waiting for our server, but other people sat after us were being served. 

She was shocked. Truth is, by the time she came to our table we were packing up to leave.  Then she says, I've ordered your table an appetizer, I am so sorry, your server will be here soon.  Ok, it's like 9 pm and we would have to go somewhere else so we stayed.  Then, one of the managers come over with like 4 appetizers, water, apologies, and our server shows up, apologized.  We get it, it's late and he's overwhelmed with tables.  

We order, he brings our biscuits; which by the way is the reason I came because the blueberry compote and honey is AMAZING!!  The other manager comes over, apologizes and wants to make sure we are ok.  More importantly, our dinner date has made a turn and we are now enjoying ourselves and not having to drag our 4 year old somewhere else to eat.  

Honestly, when the food came we couldn't even eat it because we were stuffed on ALL the appetizers they brought to us.  So, most of our food we took home!! Anyway, we had a better time than what I thought because we were headed out the door.   Ok, to boot, I took my last biscuit and wanted the compote, but I left it on the table.  As we were leaving out our hostess comes through the door and stopped us to give us a jar of compote!!! In my head I'm like YES!  Won't he do it!!! Listen, my 4 stars are for the wait, but they made it up to us with the end result of our service. I can tell they pride hem selves on customer service.  Love that!"}
{"text":"Overrated and nothing great on the menu...need more healthy options. No local or seasonal items on menu either or doesn't leave you with a unique experience like most cafés do.  
Sorry Charlotte...Tupelo is not what you deserve. Owners please revive your business."}
{"text":"I visit this place on Monday for a birthday brunch.. Nice day to sit out in their beautiful patio area.. The hostess seated us right away!! Jayme our waitress was on point and get us. She brought water with lemons while we decide on how many things we will order since we're starving. 
To start, my sister order a mimosa and I ordered the Thai basil mojito. Then the small plate shrimp tacos. Later sissy order the steak and eggs. I opted for the shoo shrimp and grits! 
My sister loves the mimosa! But my mojito just taste like a lot of Bacardi and not much of a mojito!! I didn't say much. Because I wanted a mojito for the bday. I enjoyed the little of the steak. I didn't care too much for the shrimp and grits.. I guess to much it's a little busy.. All the taste get all jumble up.. Maybe I'll give it another try next time.. And as far as our waitress. Little adorable thing ever.. She's tentative. She made our day!!"}
{"text":"goat cheese grits, Shoo Mercy Pancakes, Shoo Mercy Omelete

My husband and I went bright and early Sunday morning when they opened. There was plenty of parking in the private lot right in front of the restaurant.

The space was spacious and clean. Service was extremely friendly and professional. Our server Ashley definitely went above and beyond serving our table giving us her recommendations and constantly checking up on us (without overdoing it). 

We ordered the Shoo Mercy Pancakes, Shoo Mercy Omelette and a side of Goat Cheese Grits.

The pancake came with a piece of fried chicken placed on a giant single pancake. The serving size was definitely generous and it was delicious.

My husband's omelette had pimento cheese and fried green tomatoes. Definitely a great way to go to get a taste of the South. He raved about it so I can tell he enjoyed it.

Our side of grits were perfectly made and flavorful.

The bathrooms were clean. We were the first ones seated but by the time we left the place was slowly getting busier but definitely not as crowded as it would be later on in the day.

Bathrooms were very clean.

Can't wait to go back and try other things!"}
{"text":"The server was great and the food was great.  I had the shrimp and grits which was really just about as good as I expected.  They had reasonably fresh biscuits.  I really wanted some fried chicken but they only breast and that just doesn't work.  The double IPA \"Babymaker\" was nice n sweet like an Imperial should be.  I usually drink the traditional IPA, but some wack job brainiac decided to start criticizing the IPAs and that aggression will not stand.  So instead of risking unsatisfaction, I thought that was a safe choice.
Overall, a solid place and I feel obligated as a result, to rank it a 4; but I honestly didn't feel it was much more than a high 3.  I know this will sound like a despicable hipster thing, but It just didn't have something . . . maybe that was due to my disappointment in not offering proper (yeah I'm a snob) fried chicken.  Most people will be happy."}
{"text":"Went for brunch, it was okay. I ordered their famous pancakes I always heard great things about. It wasn't quite what I expected. Their homemade jam was great though. I will probably not be going back. It was overpriced and the quality wasn't up to par. I couldn't finish the plate because of the lingering taste it had. The only good thing about this place is the service. The server was very friendly and understood our disappointment about the food. We took a bite, payed and left. We didn't even stay to finish it was that nasty. I definitely do NOT recommend it."}
{"text":"This was are second time at the place, Jonathan our waiter was get the meal was great as well. We will make another visit soon! Love the small plates menu!"}
{"text":"I cannot wait to find a reason to make the hour and a half drive back to Charlotte to eat at this restaurant!  That is how good the food is.  The waitstaff was very attentive to our party of 10 (8 adults and 2 two-year-olds).  You would think that on Easter Sunday afternoon, there would be a long wait for our food or the plating would show signs of being hurriedly prepared.  Quite the opposite!  Everything was on point and everyone was very friendly and eager to assist.  I know they all must have been tired from a busy busy day already, but you wouldn't know it. 

I have eaten in the Tupelo Honey Cafe in Asheville as well.  Each restaurant has it's own look and feel.  Plus, you won't find any better take on Mama's home cooking anywhere.

Until next time!"}
{"text":"The red-headed stepbrother of the Asheville location.

After each visit to this location I seem to get pulled into a different direction of either love or hate. The first few times it was stellar. The more I went, I found that it was either a really bad experience or pretty good. It seems like the quality of the food has gone down as of late. The service is hit or miss out of my 12 or so visits here; you're either getting drinks and biscuits you didn't know you needed right as you sit down, or waiting 30 minutes for a mimosa at brunch. 

One thing that's always been ridiculous...the wait times. If you're looking to go during the weekend and this is your first trip, you will be terribly mistaken to think you will get a table within any reasonable time frame. Booking a reservation the night before is your best bet, but even then it's not guaranteed you will be seated at the time you reserve. On the other hand, I have experienced them grossly overestimate the wait time (they said maybe 45 mins. and it ended up being 10 mins.). 

With all of that out of the way, the food is absolutely Southern inspired and some things are reminiscent of a dish my grandmother would cook on a Saturday morning for me. I have yet to have anything that was just flat out bad, but I have had a couple of things that were WAY overpriced for what you get (mainly the drinks). Their margins are ridiculous, but hey...gotta pay that Southend lease! 

By all means check it out, but only if you have a 2-3 hour time span to wait and eat."}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken and biscuit and the southern poutine scramble. The fried chicken was fried to perfection (crispy and not too much batter) - I really enjoyed the boneless chicken. It had good flavor. The biscuit and gravy was average. The Southern poutine scramble was disappointing because it came out cold. We saw that it was ready to be delivered but because the chicken wasn't, it sat on the counter for like 10 mins. When it was finally delivered it was cold - imagine eating cold French Fries. I'm sure the dish is better but because it was cold we did not enjoy so therefore I have to rate our experience a two star. Server was friendly but food did not meet expectation."}
{"text":"The food is very good and unique.  The service however has been terrible the last 2-3 times I went.  Most recently, our dinner with  5 adults and 3 children under 5 took almost 3 hours.  The comments under my reservation to acknowledge a Birthday were completely ignored even though I told the hostess to please be sure to pass them along to our server, and one of the main dishes we ordered (pork chop) came out much later than the other entrees and was not fully cooked."}
{"text":"The restaurant was okay lacking the excitement of flavorful dishes. I am not trying to be negative but the food was unpleasantly bland. I have cooked better at home. The service was better than the food. The ambiance of the restaurant was pleasant."}
{"text":"I recently went to the Tupelo location in Charlotte. After visiting the one in Raleigh I thought it was the perfect place to celebrate my birthday. The majority of my experience was wonderful the food was great. My main issue came with the service. My best friend arrived before me and asked \"what do yall do for birthdays?\" and she got the response that they sing happy birthday and the typical restaurant thing. My reservation stated that it was my birthday and also my friends had a balloon at the table that says \"happy birthday\" on it. So towards the end of the service we realized another table was also celebrating a birthday and we watched as everyone sang happy birthday and ice cream was brought out with a candle in it. It was extremely awkward waiting for my turn which never came. When my best friend ask the server why I didn't receive one she said in a rude tone \"well maybe they paid for it?\" When I've always know it to be customary. I was extremely embarrassed. I hate to blame everything on race but its so heart breaking watching a table full of white people being recognized for a birthday and it seeming as though me being a person of color my birthday was irrelevant. I came to celebrate another year of my life and i left with my heart in my stomach basically. When i left carrying a \"happy birthday\" balloon and random people were telling me happy birthday but i was just made to feel like it did not even matter. When i tell you I absolutely love this restaurant and to have been treated like this on my birthday it was extremely hurtful, embarrassing, and I feel as though i'm not even welcomed there. I filed a complaint after the evening just did not sit right with me. The response that I received from the general manager David Gordon was \" We do not sing, have never sung here and we do not have candles.  Not sure where this women ate???\" After which I replied I felt further disrespected. The final email I received stated that \"  I did not realize you were linked into our messages.\"  Never again will I spend my money at an establishment such as this that does not respect me as a person."}
{"text":"I have a 12 hour layover here and this place was recommended to me. I told One of the hostesses this and she later came out and gave me a glass with the name of the cafe on it, so sweet! The crispy Brussels are pure heaven. So good! I would for sure come back! Gold star!"}
{"text":"This was our favorite meal we had during our visit to Charlotte. The Shoo Mercy Pancake was everything I dreamed it would be- sweet, savory and delicious (Although $20 felt like a pretty steep price, it was worth it). The service was great; our waiter even made a point to take our order before the order of the large party next to us so we wouldn't have to wait long for our food."}
{"text":"First visit here, can't say we will be back.  Service was very slow.  Beets were extremely salty and still had dirt on them, very over cooked also.  The queen Charlotte Bloody Mary tasted as if they dumped salt in it.  Fried chicken was good but not at all warm.  Shrimp & Grits, good but again way to salty.  We are huge salt eaters so for us to say TOO SALTY its salty......."}
{"text":"Alec was the best waiter. He was very attentive and told hilarious stories. Incredible service! Cannot wait to go back to Tupelo Honey :)"}
{"text":"The food is delicious. Great place to take your mom or any out of town guest that wants some southern food! Recommend going for brunch! They offer limited reservations so plan ahead or you may have to wait"}
{"text":"This is a great spot for brunch, lunch, and dinner. The custom services was great as well!"}
{"text":"Having been to the original location in Asheville, this location fails to reach their success in the kitchen.  

Service was simply meh and unresponsive (slower than it should be and not organized).

Onto the food.  I had the carnivore breakfast pie with a side of breakfast potatoes, that was so bad I couldn't eat it.   The meat appeared to be one slice of thin low grade ham lunch meet diced up and spread through a scrambled egg baked in a pie crust.  The eggs were over cooked to a rubber texture, and the pie crust was too thick and dry to be served in a 4\" tart shape.  I tried adding ketchup, then mayonnaise, then syrup.  Nothing seemed to work, so I only ate the potatoes, which were simply ok. 

The only reason I give them 2 stars, is because the biscuits they bring to the table may be in the top 5 in the city.  However, if you are going for breakfast, just get the sweet potato pancake as it was the only good thing served at our table."}
{"text":"Came back to my new favorite brunch spot in Charlotte. Service wasn't as great this time. I think because they were pack. I hardly complain about things, but my coffee was cold, had to ask for a spoon for my coffee, silverware and napkin, and after waiting about 30mins for my food to come out, it was cold and my eggs were runny after requesting med-well. Although I was starving at this point and would've ate it anyway, the waiter insisted on taking the food back to have another one prepared. I still like the place and will come back. Today just wasn't their day."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my adult grilled cheese with bacon.  I wasn't a fan of the sweet potato mash but the grilled cheese was plenty filling and easily out weighed the side.  The servers were VERY friendly but the place was understaffed.  I will definitely go back and hope to come back with an updated review."}
{"text":"First: they're coming to Raleigh.   October can't get here fast enough!

The south end of Charlotte has lots of Good Eats (sorry, Alton) and Tupelo Honey which is Great Eats!  

Good, well prepared fresh ingredients make food that just makes you want more. My waiter even said, \"hey, it's a judgement-free zone\". The service was great, love the space and feel of the Cafe. 

The Banana pudding was so good I bought the cookbook (first cookbook, the yellow one) to get the recipe. 

Had a pork sandwich, sort of like the version served in the Midwest, but with apple slices, havarti and cheddar and a siracha aioli. Complemented with excellent brown-butter Brussel sprouts. It was beyond delicious!

They also serve everything on the menu (breakfast) all day (breakfast4dinner). How can you go wrong?

Did I mention they're coming to Raleigh?  I'll be at the front door on opening day. Can't wait."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and left happy. Service was attentive and friendly. We split the egg rolls for an app, very tasty combination of southern staples. I didn't want a heavy lunch so I had the shrimp tacos. It was the perfect meal for a weekday lunch. Next stop breakfast."}
{"text":"I came to North Carolina for some good southern cooking like grandma used to make. Tupelo honey did not disappoint.  The only drawback is the menu changes frequently so if you go you might not see this on the menu. I went to the one in Chattanooga 2yrs ago and the menu was so different I had to look back at my pictures to confirm it was the same restaurant. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"So, we set a reservation for 10 way ahead of time. Naturally, you would think the restaurant would be prepared. No. The poor waitress was in the weeds before be got there, running her self ragged. Drinks took over 30 minutes, we never got biscuits. Then, they are out of half the food we ordered. This was a really bad experience. We asked for a manager, no one came over. 30 minutes later, we ask again. Finally a young guy comes over- doesn't apologize to anyone but says apps (only 2 were ordered) and desserts are on him. Why would we order more food when it took an insane amount of time for anything?! The restaurant was not full and they were not on a wait. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT chose this place for a group larger than say 4 people. It was ridiculous.. it will be hard to convince me to come back."}
{"text":"Tupelo Honey is a unique experience.  I've been there twice now and was impressed both times with the quality of the food and the service. 
The Bloody Mary's are unbelievable and the biscuits and jam are complimentary and delicious!  I had the Shoo Mercy Sweet Potato Pancakes and Fried Chicken and it lives up to it's name...shoo mercy it was good.  The second visit was for dinner and I had the Sweet Tea Brined Chicken and mac n cheese which was delicious. My friend had the Shrimp and Grits which was NOT a very good portion for a man.  Only a few shrimp (maybe 4-5) and they were on the small side.  That was kind of a disappointment but the flavor was good.  Just not enough to eat for my friend.  I like the upbeat atmosphere and the service was great too."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast this past Saturday morning and ate at the chefs table.... That was cool because I would have had to wait forever to get a table and I got a chance to watch the cooks prepare the food. 

My issue was the that the initial service was a little slow. They made up for it with those yummy biscuits and heavenly blueberry jam! My crab scramble wasn't bad, it was just okay... 

I'm going back for lunch next time because I saw some awesome looking burgers leaving the kitchen. Oh yeah, their juices and teas are good...really fresh tasting."}
{"text":"Awesome place for a devilish brunch with a hipster vibe. Family-friendly. Our toddler loves their biscuits with jam. Coffee is good and the service is outstanding."}
{"text":"This was my second time here and the food was great both times. The mimosas are delicious with a good mix of fruit juice and champagne. But what's best about my experience was the attention and the service. A small group of friends and I held a bridal shower lunch for a friend. The Tupelo Honey Cafe team was not only attentive, they acknowledged our bride-to-be and gifted her their signature drink and a cookbook. We were all very appreciative."}
{"text":"First time here with coworkers on travel...they also have a northern VA location from we are from but never had a chance to try them out. Service was awesome and so was the food. So good that I completely forgot to take pictures! Their complimentary biscuits and blueberry jam was amazing! All the apps sounded delicious but we opted for the fried green tomatoes and fried Brussels sprouts. Absolutely delicious! I got the breakfast platter that consisted of pancakes, eggs, buttermilk fried chicken with pecan topping! My coworkers tried the shrimp and grits with chirizo, honey glazed wings, fried chicken w/mac-n-cheese and collards. I pretty much taste tested all of their food and I must say that EVERYTHING was delicious! I will definitely be going to my VA location back home!"}
{"text":"Solid food.  The menu keeps changing I guess to attract new business or keep existing business coming back,.  The beer selection and mixed drinks are diverse and wonderful.  It is like soul food meets american contemporary.  I like the place in Asheville better, but this place is fine."}
{"text":"Addictive!  Went with my work family and it was delicious. Michael picked it out for us and he nailed it. Went for lunch and want to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 6 stars I would. My fiancé and I are big foodies and this place was PHENOMENAL. We got the fried green tomatoes for an appetizer, mamas meatloaf and Carolina mountain fish entrees and banana pudding for desert. Everything was to die for and so flavorful. They also give you complimentary biscuits with their honey and homemade blueberry jam.. Ah-mazing. Not only was the food good but the hospitality there was nothing I have ever experienced. Our waiter, Jonathan was so personable and so nice. He gave us suggestions on the menu and when we told him we were new to Charlotte, he gave us so many suggestions on the best places to go in town. He was awesome!! Very pleased with this place. If you go, make sure to ask for Jonathan!"}
{"text":"Have been a repeat customer since it has been in Charlotte.  Menu has varied over time but overall has been good.  That is why I was disappointed when I was seated across from the open kitchen and witnessed a navy-turbaned chef, wearing gloves for food prep, reach in his pocket and start texting on his phone.  This occurred multiple times and he finally put the cell phone down, and starting preparing food again, with the same gloves on!  Ughh.  Won't be back!!"}
{"text":"It had been a while since I visited Tupelo Honey. A friend sent me a text and asked \"Brunch?\" I shot back \"Where?\" and Tupelo was suggested. I grabbed a reservation 2-3 days before the day we wanted to go and I'm certainly glad I did. When we got there it seemed as though all of Charlotte was there! I picked 10:45 on Opentable and we waited only about 5 minutes for our table to be cleared. Keep in mind to add a few minutes to try and find parking as its limited. Tupelo is very close to the E/W Blvd Lynxx stop though too. 
We started with the fried green tomatoes which I di denjoy. They are nestled in a red pepper sauce which screamed Spring to me. Four slices come in an order.
By 11 am, they were out of what my companions wanted to eat; huevos rancheros. So, one went with the southwestern omelet with chorizo, avocado and cheese/salsa/sour cream. Its big; probably a 3 egg omelet. She added grits. The other dining companion ordered the Eggs Betty which is their take on a benedict. Its pretty traditional. I ordered the avocado toast. Gotta eat it quickly if you don't want the avocado to make the thick, country slice of bread soggy. It was a generous amount of avocado though. It comes with some dressed greens and beets. The greens were soggy so maybe too heavily dressed. 
My favorite thing I ate was the potato cracklins on the sides menu. Those are a must in my opinion!
They have your standard mimosas and bloody marys, etc., but they are charging a hefty price for them. Get a glass of rose instead!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. I have been to Tupelo Honey many times, but this time put a bad taste in my mouth. After waiting for around 10 mins to be helped, we were informed that our waiter did not know that he had a table. Since we had a enough time to decide what we wanted to eat, when we ordered they realized they had given us the brunch menu instead of the dinner menu. After ordering, we we're sitting in full view of the open kitchen and saw a man with the words \"chef\" on his hat, using a cell phone with gloves on and did not see him change his gloves before handling the food. We also observed that our entrees sat under the lamps on the counter for a while before they were brought out to us. But that's not all, they also only brought our main dish without the side and we were able to finish our sandwich before our side even reached the table. Although they comped our half price appetizer for making us wait, this still did not make up for our poor experience. Plus, we were maybe one of five tables in the dining room (the kitchen should not have been that behind) The food was delicious as always, but there is lots of room for improvement for service."}
{"text":"We moved to Charlotte, North Carolina from Southern California this past June and this was by far the BEST meal we've had since we've been here. Probably one of the best meals at a restaurant ever. My husband and I are snobs about food, quality and taste, Tupelo Honey hit it out of the park! We started with the grit poppers, hubby had the tenderloin, and I had the lamb....it was all incredibly fantastic!"}
{"text":"Venerated veggie bowl is always delicious. Love the salads too!"}
{"text":"I have been here for brunch once and dinner twice. Most recently 3/11/17. Every time has been so amazing and I consider this one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte now! The best thing on their menu right now is the caramelized squash toast with burrata. Amazing!! Get it and you won't be disappointed in the cheese. Also my favorite cheese of all time and that's really saying something with all the options!! Also their cracklings' potatoes are amazing. Add some ranch dressing on the side, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We didn't make the Asheville location so was eagerly awaiting the South End location to open.  This is one of the few places the menu challenges me.  all of the dishes have a slant where it is like almost seems appealing but you know it would be too hard to remove.  There is not a standard type waffle or sandwich that really catches my eye.

The Shrimp & Grits - where's the shrimp?  There were only a few.  The goat cheese made the dish heavy but it didn't seem to add what I was hoping in terms of flavor."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great atmosphere! Build your own old fashion? Yes, please!! 
And the service was fantastic! William was the best and kept us happy the whole time!"}
{"text":"Im writing my updated review after the GM reached out to me after my initial review. My husband and I went for dinner tonight. I really wish I could have giving this place a better review than last time, but my experience was unfortunately worse. 

The food looks amazing but the taste is medicore, especially for the price. Except the biscuits. Those were delicious. 

I ordered the shrimp and grits without the chorizo. I had four pieces of shrimp, that tasted a bit too 'fishy'. 2 shrimps in the waitress came over and asked if I wanted a box, so even though I wasnt done eating I felt almost a bit pressured and put the rest to go. 

My husband ordered the fried chicken with the mac and cheese and a corn slaw. He did enjoy his chicken, but was not impressed with  the sides. His words were \"KFC does slaw and mac and cheese better\". The \"jalepeno corn slaw' was mostly just a blah cabbage slaw with hints of corn kernels. Dissapointing. 

The atmosphere is nice, the waitress made us feel a bit uncomfortable, food was whatever. 

Sorry to say, def wont be back."}
{"text":"I miss Pewter Rose. *sigh* I had meatloaf and all I could taste was Worcestershire sauce. Was with a party of seven others, and one of the meals was uh, misplaced, and arrived about 15 minutes after the others."}
{"text":"First and maybe the last time here. Ordered the vreate your own omelet and it was more like a cooked egg folded over with spinach and tomatoes. .chesse wasn't even melted. The grits were awesome, complimentary biscuit awesome with blueberry spread. Ended up returning the omelet and eating the grits and biscuit.  

Service was great and understanding of my concerns so will try again hoping for a better experience.  

BTW, they are located at the old Pewter Rose location..great ambience and atmosphere.  So, will try again next Saturday."}
{"text":"Tupelo gets a 3 because I ate here and I didn't die.  But I almost didn't even get to eat here because I couldn't find the damn button to get the elevator doors to open.  If there is a camera in the corner watching jackasses like me trying to find the button to push, I bet it's hilarious.  

I was super excited to try the place (more excited to see Candyce, but excited about the food too).  At 5:00 on a somewhat gloomy Wednesday, there were only 2 other tables seated, but by the time we were leaving, the place was full and there were a few folks waiting outside (and more road-ragers in the parking lot stalking people for their parking spots).  Hardwood floors, slowly turning ceiling fans, reclaimed wood-paned windows - they are going for the laid back southern charm look, I suppose.

The hostess was very friendly, I was quickly seated since there was no one there.  Wait staff were very friendly and offered suggestions.

But... eh.  It was fine.  Nothing earth shattering, nothing new, nothing unusual.  I wouldn't wait 5 minutes to eat here again, much less the hours that others are reporting.  I am guessing The Liberty has seen an uptick in business from folks who don't want to wait an eternity to eat at the new place next door.

The food:
The BISCUITS:  Ahhhh the much-praised biscuits... were fine.  Served room temp with a small cup of blueberry preserves or honey, they were kind of crumbly.  And the salt-dusted top half was not appetizing to me.  I tried to flick the salt off and covered it in the very fresh tasting blueberry preserves.  Not the best I have had, but not the worst (this is going to be a pattern throughout the meal).  2.5/5
Appalachian Egg Rolls ($9):  3 small egg rolls, cut in half, served with chunky mustard and a BBQ sauce.  Stuffed with shredded pork, greens, some other stuff.  The BBQ sauce was good, the egg rolls were fine.  Not worth $9. 2.5/5
Zippy-De-Do-Dah Sweet and Spicy Pork ($18):  Tender, well cooked pork drizzled with a smoky, sweet BBQ sauce.  Served with mac and cheese that was creamy but didn't really have any kind of flavor, and 4 spears of asparagus that were cooked well, mildly seasoned. The pork was the star of the meal.  3/5
Pecan Pie ($5.45):  Well plated, nice sized slice but, again, nothing special.  It didn't taste any better to me than the frozen Sara Lee pecan pies that I eat straight out of the metal pie pan. 3/5

As another reviewer stated, and this is small, but annoying - luke warm tea refills poured into glasses with no ice in them.  Meh.  

All of the staff were hustling about once the place filled up - they are staffed well with friendly, competent folks for the large crowd, but I didn't have anything tonight that I would brave South End to get at again."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was awesome. Had a small issue with the meal they brought out initially (hair in the food) but Alec and his manager corrected it quickly and comped the meal. As a west coast resident, if you want to try some solid southern fare, try Tupelo."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I was here, so I'm basing my 5 stars on my favorite thing I had there - the Appalachian Egg Rolls! They are divine!!! The salad they serve with it is great! The dressing is delicious! The sauces are awesome!! I can't wait to order these again. I have to say, the other food we had, wasn't bad, but if I go there again, I'd only get these egg rolls!"}
{"text":"For all those saying this version is not the same as the original one in Asheville,  well it's not! Get over it. This place is just as good minus the 2 hour waits. I've been to the Asheville on several times and yes it's awesome. But so is this location! And it's earning my 5 star rating based on it's own merits!

Let's start with the grit cakes. OMG! Cheesy fried goodness drizzeled with sriracha, fresh salsa and sour cream to tame the heat. You can taste the cheesy goodness in these grits....must be gruyere or goat cheese.....A must get!

Not being in a burger mood, I chose the fried pork tenderloin sandwhich covered with cheese and topped with a sriracha aioli, all over a green apple slice. Personally I don't think this sandwich needed the apple. Nonetheless this sandwich was OUTSTANDING! Just pick your diet relief day to come here....definitely not on the weight watchers approved list! Oh the dish normally comes with asparagus but I opted to substitute their awesome cheesy onion soup with bacon croutons....seriously?

Note: I heard that Management is going to take off this pork sandwich. Ask them for it and ask why they would take off a 5 star sandwich! I already provided my feedback. So it may not be on the menu when you come.....uggggg.

Finally I asked for them to bring out my biscuits at the end instead of as your traditional appetizer. These are always delicious! Love their homemade jam, but I really love the real Tupelo honey, ostensibly what the restaurant is named after.

A big shout out to Tiara! She was the awesome bartender who took care of me, and made me feel like part of the THC family. Go see her at the bar (shes the head bar tender) Tell her Paul sent you....She's another big reason THC gets 5 stars!

This place is THE REAL DEAL!"}
{"text":"Went with a group of four and split the banana puddin pancakes -- highly recommended because they might be too much to handle by yourself. I had the fried chicken and biscuits, it was stellar. Black pepper gravy with it is fantastic.

Someone else had the southern shakshuka, which is a brilliant concept and brilliantly executed. I had a bite--I'd get it myself next time.

Our waiter, Jonathan, was one of the friendliest waiters we've ever had. Just an all around good guy, and very cool. He gave us complimentary buttermilk biscuits with house made blueberry preserves. The biscuits had a few grains of black pepper on them which added this incredible depth, make sure to try them. Ask for Jonathan!"}
{"text":"Wonderful service and even better food! We tried:

Shoo mercy omelet - $16
Red flannel hash - $14
Coffee - $3 
Biscuits and honey - complimentary

The shoo mercy was delicious and just what I was craving at the time. It had pimento cheese, friend green tomato, smoked ham, bacon, and pickled jalapeno. The omelet was big and heavy. I was only able to eat a little over half. Took the other half to go. The red flannel hash consisted of beets, potatoes, pickled onions, two fried eggs on top, horseradish, and some herbs. I was so full after the biscuits and omelet, I did not get to try the red flannel hash. My SO really enjoyed it, though. He also did not finish it and took it to go. 

The restaurant is located on the second floor of a shopping strip. It's cute, casual, and has an open layout. There is an elevator to the left if you don't want to/can't take the stairs. Ample parking. Will return to try more menu items!"}
{"text":"Pimento cheese and Bloody Marys may be the best in Charlotte! The outside sitting is absolutely amazing but parking can be difficult depending on time since its a shared lot."}
{"text":"I'm from Asheville and when I found out this restaurant was here I was so excited!! Unfortunately, our waitress didn't seem to care we were there, or hungry. 
The food was very bland and it took 2 of us an hour and a half from the time we set down to the time we got our check. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I keep trying to like this place but my efforts are to no avail. Service is ridiculously slow regardless of whether the restaurant is busy or slow. They constantly run out of things I want to order (happened on 3 consecutive visits). Besides the salty biscuits, the rest of the food is saltless. On a recent visit, the waittress recommended the \"sweet tea chicken\". OMG!  Unless you like chicken that literally tastes like sweet tea - including the \"sweet\" aspect - stay away from that item. Yesterday I visited with my family. The hostess told us about their specials; both of which are priced so ridiculously high, it is obvious that you're better off ordering from the regular menu. I ordered the trout with mac and cheese and collards. The 4 adults brought our food home to add salt and other spices to create some flavor. The kids enjoyed the fried chicken and shoo mercy pancakes."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Usually pretty crowded - so plan for a bit of a wait. Breakfast items are offered all day and are especially good!"}
{"text":"Tupelo Honey was almost amazing. Their menu is traditional southern with a lot of veggie options and lots and lots of cheese.

Cocktails were a stiff pour- bonus pimento cheese stuffed olives in the dirty martini.

The little good details: Each person gets a fresh biscuit and pickled okra.

The missed details: 

-No butter was brought with our biscuits then our waitress disappeared.

-Dinner was served. Someone at my table ordered fries, no ketchup was presented.

-Had to ask for straws, three waters were delivered for four people, had to ask for refills......

I sound like an old grumpy woman. Really its the little things and the food wasn't too die for enough to forgive the little ills."}
{"text":"You know.... I wish I could give this place more stars, but I just can't bring myself to do it.  It's good, but it's not fantastic.  We've been a handful of times and tried breakfast, lunch and dinner.

POSITIVES
-Tupelo is a great place for drinks and appetizers.
-The TVs in the bar are nice for games.
-The biscuits are bomb.
-The service is usually wonderful and the management seems to care a lot.

NEGATIVES
-The food is heavy, all of it.  Even the vegetarian dishes are swimming in sauce or gravy or dressing.  And the food just isn't stellar.  Again, I would stick to the biscuits and appetizers - that's where the good stuff is.
-This place can get really, really crowded.  Especially on the weekends for brunch."}
{"text":"Nice place."}
{"text":"Am I happy.  After visiting Tupelo Honey in Ashville, NC we were surprised and delighted to find that they opened a location in Charlotte, so when I came in from a flight we hit for dinner.

Oddish location as it is upstairs in a cul-de-sac of shops off of South Blvd.  If you are not going slow you will blast right by it, so pay attention.

Beautiful interior, especially as contrasted to the dark enclosed Ashville location.  There is a lot of space inside with bar and dining areas and a huge patio which will be wonderful in warmer weather.

Menu is excellent.  My standard is if I see three or more items that I want to eat then the menu is way above average.  And the concoctions which comprise the meals or offerings are unique and clever.  Difficulty in deciding makes the visit an adventure.

Fresh, soft and not falling apart biscuits are served with honey and yummy home-made, I think, jam.  Service is on the spot.  Beverages are refilled without asking.  Servers keep checking on you and I think that it reinforces their personal opinion that Tupelo is a great place, continually confirmed by customers.

A little on the expensive side, but I grant them that as the portions are generous and as mentioned, the concoctions are creative and come together nicely.

Am giving this a three stars, yet keep wavering back and forth as I type between three and four.  It is a solid, even high three, but on one visit am I a fan?  Reading the other reviews the opinions are well below four with service and seating problems, which we did not have.  So lacking a high three or three plus, just give Tupelo a three star rating and let's see how they shake out.

Certainly do recommend you try it and try to come at other than prime time."}
{"text":"food was just alright, not as impressed as i was hoping. The Blueberry compote and Biscuits were pretty good. The menu could've had a better selection. Would possibly give them a second chance."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! The appetizer pork rolls are delicious, the crab cakes were amazing, and the pork dinner plate so juicy and tender. Let's not forget the amazing biscuits!! OMG, they are the absolutely best and a combination of a roll/biscuit. The service was outstanding, the ambiance calm and comfortable. I would definitely recommend this cafe for anyone who likes Southern food with a twist!"}
{"text":"I don't know how it got $$. An order of fries are 5.00. I had fried chicken. Nothing is seasoned. NOTHING.  My chicken breast was tough as shoe leather. The grits were the best part of meal, but are unseasoned also. Add your own salt and pepper to everything, cause it's bland."}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant that doesn't feel like a chain!  
The layout and decor in the restaurant is warm and inviting and the bar has a really cool frozen metal strip where you can set your beverage to keep it cold. 
The biscuits with blueberry jam are simply mouth watering.  It's almost a meal in itself.  And the shrimp and grits are not to be missed.  Make sure you save some room for dessert as well, as their blueberry tart is fantastic!"}
{"text":"The brunch food was absolutely amazing!! The sweet potato pancake was enormous and delicious! It is topped with nuts and butter, but the best topping is the friend chicken. I have never been a fan of chicken with breakfast foods but this experience has completely changed my mind. It was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. It also seemed to have a slight honey taste which was the perfect accompaniment and made this chicken absolutely heavenly. My boyfriend got the omelet and the waiter was not joking when he said this would be plenty to eat without needing a side! It was HUGE!! We both were pleasantly stuffed when we finished eating.

The drinks were also quite tasty! The giant mimosa was plenty to drink and not too strong. Exactly what I was hoping for on a Saturday morning. My boyfriend got their special huge bloody mary that was made with yellow tomatoes. Now I am not usually a fan of bloody marys but this was actually really good! It had a different taste than a traditional bloody mary which I liked and he said it was the best bloody mary he has ever tasted, and he is a regular fan. He did say he wasn't sure it was quite worth the $15 but it was his birthday so it was a nice treat.

As much as I have raved about the food, I also can't say enough good things about the overall environment and wait staff. Our waiter made us feel extremely comfortable and really went over the menu since it was our first time. He made us feel special with the biscuits and provided recommendations on menu items. Everyone in the restaurant seemed to be really happy and enjoying their experience as well.

This has officially become our most favorite brunch spot!"}
{"text":"2nd time checking out this place and I absolutely love this place. Great location, great staff, food is awesome and made from scratch. Try the Pineapple Tiki Bomb for Two; it's yummy. The biscuits with honey and jam is absolutely a tasty start to lunch or dinner. I will be back and will recommend others."}
{"text":"Great brunch place! Yummy biscuits and for a southern restaurant there was a lot of vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"Get ready for the best Bloody Mary in the planet!  Be ready to wait for it too on a Sunday Brunch. This place will be packed, and for good reason!  The food, is incredible. Southern cuisine with a modern touch, and always, always great service from the bar staff to the host stand and of course from the fine servers that work hard there. Keep it up Tupelo Honey, we love this place."}
{"text":"My husband I decided to come for dinner and were disappointed.  The place was very echo-ey and loud, the service was very slow ( I didn't get my beverage until I was almost done with my food) and the meals were pretty small for the price.  Doubt we will return.  Plenty of other places in Charlotte to go for brunch and/or comfort food."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Our server Jonathan was AMAZING!!! He was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. His energetic and helpful attitude made this my favorite visit to date. The shrimp and grits are a must!"}
{"text":"Welcome to Charlotte, Tupelo Honey Cafe! Yelpers, get ready to have your taste buds delighted. 

I've been anxiously awaiting Tupelo Honey's arrival to the Charlotte food scene. I've heard nothing but amazing things about it but the 1.5-2 hour wait at the one in Asheville left me pining away. But not anymore, as we have our very own! It fills the space once occupied by the Pewter Rose Bistro.

We were lucky enough to join Tupelo Honey Cafe for a soft opening tonight. Usually restaurants use soft openings to work out kinks and problems, but it didn't seem like they really needed it. Everything was already operating like a smooth oiled machine. The service was excellent and the food was all superb. They were serving a limited menu but there was still something for everyone. 

Homemade Pimento Cheese and Tortilla Chips - Awesome. The pimento cheese was served hot, reminiscent of a Southern version on queso dip. The chips were also hot and fresh. 

Biscuits: Fresh biscuits served with Tupelo honey and berry jam. So.Freakin.Good. My search for the best biscuit has ended. Tupelo wins. These biscuits are light, fluffy, flaky, buttery, salty, and just damn good. 

SHOO-Mercy Shirmp and Grits: Oh man. A dozen perfectly cooked, succulent shrimp with bacon, caramelized onions, spinach, and sauteed mushrooms all served over goat cheese grits... Read that again... Goat cheese grits! If you aren't a fan of goat cheese, skip this dish as it is a very dominant flavor. Or better yet, try them and you may discover that goat cheese isn't all that bad like I did :) 

I also tried the Southern Fried Chicken Saltimbocca. So, so, so good. The chicken was perfectly cooked. So juicy. The country ham, Havarti and Marsala sauce pushed the dish over the top. The cheese smashed cauliflower were a bit of a let down. They just weren't as exciting as I wanted them to be. 

Finished the dinner off with a piece of Bourbon Pecan Pie. Perfect crust. Tons of pecans on top and ooey gooey pecan pie filling in the middle. You could smell the butter in every bite. Definitely the perfect desert for those with a sweet tooth. 

Side notes... They share the parking lot with The Liberty. They are on the second floor. There are two staircases and an elevator you can use to get up to them. The patio looks awesome! Can't wait for the weather to get nice to enjoy it. The space inside is beautiful. I love the exposed brick. They have a really nice bar area with TVs and a great selection of local beers on tap and tasty cocktails. Their mint iced tea was a bit on the sweet side for me but I loved the fresh mint flavor. Our waitress, Kat, was very friendly and attentive.

I can't wait to try out more of their menu!! See you soon Tupelo Honey Cafe :)"}
{"text":"This was our favorite meal during our long-weekend in Charlotte! From the sweet tea and biscuits to the outstanding \"Shoo Mercy\", we loved every bite. The decor is super cute, it is a little loud because of the high ceilings and fans, so sit close and enjoy your time here."}
{"text":"All I know is.. The cute bearded bartender with glasses that took the time go carve out a pineapple for my drink was amazing. He had a wonderful personality and really made our meals even better! Tasty drinks and good food. Love the curry chicken thighs and the scallops. This place rarely disappoints except on Sundays when all the brunchers come out and the place is a mad house. I'd rather come on a calmer week night to enjoy the meal. If you haven't had their shoo have mercy grilled cheese your life has been filled with bland grilled cheeses up until this point. I recommend giving this place a try!"}
{"text":"We ordered Charleston chicken sandwich and the debutant omelette. The taste was to the point but the food came out cold. The service was pretty slow and I don't blame the server because he had to serve a large number of tables. 
Tupelo honey cafe should seriously consider to increase their staff count"}
{"text":"We have finally found a honey of a restaurant in the Tupelo Honey Cafe on South Boulevard in Charlotte. You couldn't find a better general manager in Cedric Castro if you searched for years. He attends to every detail. And the highlight of our evening is when we request, no matter how long we have to wait, Iris our server. She is the epitome of professionalism, personality, and care. You have to love her. Once you meet her you'll see. And oh the menu... to die for. I had the buttermilk fried chicken with white gravy, moist and tender, and the smashed cauliflower. The homemade biscuits, jam and Tupelo Honey - it melts in your mouth. My son had the delicious hamburger, mac and cheese and fried okra. We also had the lamb meatballs with the special sauce as our appetizer and for dessert homemade banana pudding. Not just vanilla wafers stuck into instant pudding but the real bona fide thing. We have also met Cedric's assistant Mike, Chef Jason and his team of Turk, James, Kenny and the many more we will continue to meet as we are now happy regulars. Of course there's beer, wine and liquor and the restaurant's architecture is simply beautiful. John Schoeni and John Jr."}
{"text":"Breakfast is our favorite. Biscuits are the best. Atmosphere and service is good. The restaurant is lovely and parking is good. The wait time can be a problem, especially on the weekends,  it's doable. Prices are reasonable. Nice time."}
{"text":"I LOVE Tupelo. The staff is extremely friendly and the food is delicious. I love how they give biscuits with fresh jam and honey before your meal. My boyfriend and I have had the Crab Benedict, Blueberry French Toast, Goat Cheese Grits, and Fried Chicken. All was delicious! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really really don't get the intrigue about this place. I had this place booked marked for months to visit but once i experienced the food, it was a huge letdown. They specialize in southern food, all that means is everything is fried in oil. I ordered the the trout as the main dish. My two sides had fancy names but what came out were fried hunks of potatoes and tasteless Mac and cheese. The only thing that was interesting was the fried tomatoes served on a bed of grits as an appetizer. Moreover these everyday foods were sold for premium pricing. The service was lacsidasical. It took us an hour and a half to eat and leave, when we could have been done in an hour. Overall I don't see myself coming back and I just don't understand the intrigue. The fans and decor were interesting."}
{"text":"I came here for dinner with my husband and mother in law on a Sunday evening and we were able to sit outside on their outdoor patio and it was wonderful. The weather was perfect and I love that the outdoor area is on the second level. They have lights strung out through the trees and around the porch which were nice when it got dark. 
We all sampled their Tupelo Ale which was good, mild so it would be nice for a lot of people. We also tried their pimento cheese dip with tortillas and the cheese was more like a cheese dip with pimento flavor. It was good, but I would recommend getting the fried green tomatoes for sure. 
I had the veggie melt with no mushrooms and it was delicious, it didn't have a top piece of bread to it which I actually kind of enjoyed because it wasn't too much bread but rather about the vegetables. It was def. the kind of sandwich you eat with a knife and fork! As my side item I had the fried green tomatoes and they were delicious! Seriously so good. 
My husband ordered their black bean burger which he enjoyed, I also tried and there was a sweetness to it that I couldn't place exactly where it was coming from. 
My mother in law ordered the chicken piccata which she loved, it was topped with shrimp. I didn't sample this as I don't eat meat but she was very pleased with it. It was covered in a cream sauce. 
Overall the experience was wonderful and I can't wait to go back soon!"}
{"text":"This place was so good! We went here for lunch and much to my delight, they served breakfast all day!! I had the crab and spinach omelette which was pretty good... Next time I go I definitely will try their fried okra and cheesy smashed cauliflower. This is a great place for some southern grub! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Good service at a decent price point. However, it was super unhealthy. I got the crab scramble, which sounded healthy. However, it was swimming in grease. Prob won't come back on my own."}
{"text":"So amazing! We had been to the one in Ashville and we're blown away.  Blown away again in Charlotte. We absolutely love brunch, and dinner.  The biscuits are    the kids favorite.  Eggs Betty, shrimp.amd grits, and the fit to be tied pickled and fried are my fave.  Service is great, food is awesome, and drinks even better!!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is an ole mill; the high ceilings and wood floors remind you of a traditional southern home. The shrimp tacos and fried okra were good. The scratch made kitchen is a plus because you can taste the freshness. The Mac and Cheese is standard; nothing to write home about. Sweet Tea is the way a judge a restaurant that claims Southern heritage. Well the sweet tea is on point; taste like its sweetened with cane sugar and honey; a great beverage with a lil lemon sprinkle. Last but not least the biscuits. Soft through and through served with honey and homemade blueberry jam; excellent. My review would have been a 5 if the Mac and cheese was good. A great little place to enjoy an evening."}
{"text":"Another amazing experience at Tupelo Honey Cafe. The fried chicken and biscuits is one of the great comfort foods in this world. The pancakes are also amazing if you want something decadent and sweet. We love the outdoor area which faces flowering crepe myrtles and is the perfect setting to enjoy a complimentary biscuit with blueberry preserves. Our server was William who was fun and attentive. Definitely one of our favorite spots in Charlotte- check it out if you haven't been!"}
{"text":"We had a group of 8 that ordered from all corners of the menu including apps. Everyone loved what they had. So it would be hard to have a bad meal here. They have a cool small bar that you can eat in as well. They have a solid selection of beers and a full bar. The service and staff are also top notch."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but I feel as if it gets worse and worse every time I come. My drink tasted like kool aid, my food was so gross I barely touched it. Even the fries were nasty. Seriously was like when you try to reheat leftover fries in the microwave the next day. If it weren't for the prices I might have given it 3 stars but I can't justify spending $75 for the horrible meal my friend and I had there tonight or in other recent visits. Probably wouldn't come back. 

However, the service tonight was fantastic so that's always a plus! I believe our servers name was Diamond and she was great, very attentive and helpful."}
{"text":"It was a busy Sunday lunch but it didn't take us too long to get a seat.  Our server was excellent, and she brought us biscuits right away to appease our 3 year old.  The biscuits and blueberry jam are excellent.

But then the LONG wait for our food started.  It took about 45 minutes to get our food, which is way too long.  When our food came out, everything tasted bland.  My fried chicken blt was great when I put salt & hot sauce on it.  The chicken was perfectly fried.  My hubby's shrimp and grits was bland as well, and didn't merit the $18 price tag... with just a small amount of thin sauce with roasted red peppers.  Luckily they do have an awesome hot sauce here.   I really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately that did not happen."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been to a Tupelo Honey this week. I really enjoyed the food the first time and the second time. Unfortunately, I feel like it is lacking creativity. If you like the staples in southern gourmet, especially if you aren't from the south, this is a great place. Hopefully they will take a few chances when they make a new menu."}
{"text":"Made reservations for 630p on a Saturday and was seated right away. Service was great, our waiter seemed a bit rushed but at least he was polite and our order was correct. Biscuits and blackberry jam are as good as everyone says they are!  Was definitely surprised by the fried chicken breast with white gravy --it was well seasoned and moist. 

Will definitely be back to check out the outdoor seating when it warms up. 

Try the honey Chipotle wings --perfect mix of sweet and savory!!"}
{"text":"For the hype and the tons of reviews this place has I thought it might be a little bit better. Presentation of food was OK."}
{"text":"Tupelo Honey is always delicious! The only downside is they're priced a little high to go as regularly as I would like."}
{"text":"We just decided to drop in on the spur of the moment on a Friday evening and were delighted to not have to wait. We were seated on the porch upon arrival after being offered inside or outside (it was a tad noisy inside). It's really nice out there on the porch even with the road noise from South Blvd. It felt a little \"vacation-y\" with the string lights and breeze, and I enjoyed a glass of wine while I was waiting for my husband to park the car and get to the table. We had the fried green tomato appetizer, which comes over goat cheese grits. The green tomatoes were very good...not the least bit greasy, and the grits were quite tasty, although they needed a little bit of salt. I ordered an Uptown grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup for my entree. The grilled cheese was VERY cheesy. If you like a lot of cheese you'll love it. The bread was perfectly toasted and the tomato soup was truly yummy. Dip your grilled cheese in the soup, mmmm...  My husband had the catfish and it came over more grits. He said his catfish was nice and light with a little Cajun spice to it, but he was tired of the grits from our appetizer and didn't eat them, and that was the only side other than some salsa, which he also passed on. I would have put the salsa over the grits if it had been my dinner, but he's a pretty picky eater. They bring homemade biscuits to the table along with warm honey and blueberry jam. Even if you're cutting back on bread, that's worth making an exception. The biscuits had a perfect crust. Our waitress was in training and she did a superb job of taking care of us. Very friendly. I'm looking forward to trying Tupelo Honey again. Maybe for breakfast next time."}
{"text":"There's never a time that I wouldn't be up for a meal at Tupelo Honey.  They use fresh, high-quality ingredients in a wide variety of (hearty) ways.  

You begin your meal - brunch, lunch or dinner - with a fresh biscuit, honey and blueberry preserves.  The biscuits have just a touch of pepper on the top that creates an interesting flavor profile with savory bread and sweet topping.  

The have a number of specialty cocktails - including my favorite a rosemary-lime gin martini that is only $4 during happy hour.  There is also a nice selection of local beers on tap.

The food is ...southern...which, I suppose means there's cheese, frying or both involved. There's no doubt that you'll leave full.  That being said, you can dig into a veggie plate made up of 3 or 4 options from a list of about 15.   I've really enjoyed their fried chicken, grilled cheese and veggie melt sandwiches.  I do think the menu could use a couple of busy salads - it's hard to not feel overly full when leaving here.

You can go into the bar area for a more \"adult\" feeling meal or go into the main dining room for an area that is more conducive to families. I prefer the bar area - plenty of high-top tables and a great view."}
{"text":"Authentically southern. Their avocado toast for brunch is my favorite and the pimento burger for dinner is excellent!"}
{"text":"Best martinis in Charlotte. I love going after work and getting a martini and some appetizers. Definitely my favorite place in Charlotte! Haven't had bad food or a bad drink yet!"}
{"text":"Wow! Totally impressed. Super fresh and delicious. Made with love. The fried chicken and biscuits were the best I ever had. Their homemade soda is exceptional. They even give you all natural ketchup and real cream for your coffee. Love this place. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our names were on the waitlist and it was supposed to be a 15-20 minute wait. When about 35 minutes passed, I approached the hostess stand and asked what was going on. They said they texted me that my table was ready (I never got a message) and for that matter I didn't even see my name on the list anywhere.

The place was packed which led me to believe it was going to be incredible. So even though we couldn't hear each other, we waited it out. 

The food was so overpriced, and bland. I was disappointed with everything. At over $20 a plate, I expected a lot more."}
{"text":"Very yummy! 
I got the fried green tomatoes and grits! It was delicious- our waitress was very kind as well."}
{"text":"On a slow Wednesday evening, sat at the bar and ordered the fried okra to start and the shrimp and grits for my entree. Both were delicious and exceeded my expectations. Okra was lightly battered which was my preference; shrimp and grits were awesome. Dillon at bar was friendly and helpful with my meal selection."}
{"text":"Wonderful as always! Shared the fried green tomatoes and fired chicken and biscuits for our meal. Plenty of food! The portions are very generous. Our waiter was great very attentive despite the busy atmosphere. I do suggest making reservations online if you can. It saved us lots of time. This was my second time to a Tupelo Honey (my first was in downtown Asheville) and I'll definitely go every chance I can."}
{"text":"Cesar was an amazing server! He was so full of knowledge and definitely excited about the menu. He had a very friendly personality and we felt at home! We had the Appalachian egg rolls, mac n cheese, green beans, mashed cauliflower, market fish (Mahi Mahi this time), and green pea risotto... all...very... delicious! The biscuits and blueberry jam are to die for... we loved them!!!! We drank unsweetened iced tea mixed with rosemary & peach lemonade...very refreshing. Overall, a great experience, friendly staff, food quick and yummy, and restaurant seemed clean & well taken care of."}
{"text":"I came here with my mother after church on Sunday for brunch, and we had a bit of a wait, but it was well worth it. Our server Jamison was fantastic. My mother left her sweater in the seat and he ran out in the rain to bring it to us. We both had the bowl (minus the black eyed peas - per Jamison's advice) and the grits were fantastic. Would definitely recommend this one."}
{"text":"Just went to my first Moonrise buffet. What a great idea! 9pm on they put out  great little spread Friday and Saturday nights. I'll definitely be doing this the next time I go to the movies. Love this. Love my Tupelo!"}
{"text":"I went to the event they had on 8/17/17

The Food: 
The Frose which was GREAT!!!! I also had a grits smoke salmon cake which was also GREAT! And the pimento cheese was GREAT!! NEXT TIME: I want to try there fried green tomatoes(I heard they are great) 

THE RESTAURANT:
Walking to the restaurant from the parking lot was a little confusing. It's located on the the 2nd floor. they have to outdoor area, where you can sit down and eat (with sofas and tables). Inside its a hippie like restaurant (too me). The restaurant theme is honey and bees (which makes sense due to the name). It's not a lot of room to wait up. Staff really nice and down to earth."}
{"text":"Great location off the East West stop on the lynx. Went for brunch. The signature margaritas was great. Had a hard time deciding what to try. A local said she tried everything in the menu and said we wouldn't be disappointed. The sweet potato pancakes were a hit. I think the peach butter was a unique option for this dish. We were brought fresh biscuits with the homemade blueberry jam.  The omelettes were large. Share if you can. I tried the shoo omelette-It was tasty and the bacon was crisp. Also tried the fried green tomatoes with the goat cheese grits. We were definitely pleased with each dish we tried. 
Service was on point. Even though it was busy, never felt I had to search for our server."}
{"text":"Amazing place! I love the food and the entire vibe of the place! Great service! I have been here for Brunch and late dinner and both times I was impressed. They have really great tasty drinks."}
{"text":"By far one of the best meals I have had since moving to Charlotte. 
Our server Sam offered us several options of for drinks. We opted for a Manhattan and a speciality cocktail made with lavender. Both were delicious! We tried the deep fried avacado which was creamy and tasted so fresh. We also got the Ham Wonton which reminded us of summer....
My husband tried the Shoo Mercy shrimp and grits with chrizo sausage.  Creamy and savory with a bit of spice! I enjoyed the Sweet potato pecan pancake with chicken. It was sweet and light. The chicken was cooked to perfection! 
During our entire meal Sam offered suggestions of meals, was attentive and courteous. This is a man who truly enjoys his job. He was knowledgeable about food and cocktails. This is an employee whom I would hire to work for me.  He was by far one of the best people I have ever had the pleasure to wait on me in any business transaction.
My husband and I recently moved to Charlotte and when we have visitors come to our home -we will be bringing them there!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch - nice location, good menu.  I had the southern fried chicken with bacon sandwich and the charred brussel sprouts.  Sandwich was good - sprouts were awesome!  Staff was attentive and helpful.  Main dining room was too loud though.  Popular place."}
{"text":"Tupelo is always fantastic. The food is wonderful, the service is quick, and parking is typically available. Each time we've visited Tupelo, we've tried something different and loved it. The grits are amazing. Don't forget the bar specials!"}
{"text":"I've been to several Tupelo Honey's but this one just wasn't up to par with the rest.  Our service was very poor.  Then we weren't even offered dessert because it was obvious they wanted us to leave to make room for a party.  The whole table's drinks were empty at one point.  The food...I had the fried chicken and it was good, but definitely not an $18 chicken. breast.  My husband got the beef spare rib for $20+ and it wasn't more food than a young girl would eat.  But,  the biscuits were excellent and the honey was too.  That's why I am giving atleast 3 stars."}
{"text":"This is the third Tupelo honey location I have eaten at before and the first and last time I will visit the Charlotte location. Service was terrible, food was nothing special especially for the price. Disappointing experience, I'm sure there are better local restaurants in the Charlotte area."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and it was wonderful. The food, a chicken BLT, was outstanding and the biscuits were to die for! Our waiter, Jonathan was excellent and a tremendous source of information about the restaurant and the food. We will be sure to go back here whenever we are in town."}
{"text":"Food was great nice Southern comfort food with a good modern twist. Fried okra was great. Breaded in cornmeal not flour"}
{"text":"Yelp 100 Challenge 2018: 32/100

Stumbled upon this place while trying to look for a good lunch spot before heading to the airport and decided to eat on the west side of Charlotte. This is quite a busy place during a random weekday lunch! 

I like that there was plenty of parking options behind the restaurant, since it was also close to a metro station. The restaurant is on the second floor, so you will have to take either flight of the stairs to go up. As soon as you walk up the stairs, you will see a very inviting environment, with string lights and cute outdoor seating for those who want to enjoy a nice day outside. 

My party was seated inside by the window, and I immediately nerded-out looking at their ceiling fans. Their ceiling fans are connected together by a pulley system, and powered by a motor! Pretty darn cool. 

Not knowing what to order, our server first brought us some corn bread to share with some berry-type jam and honey. Mixing the berry jam and the honey together was the best! We then ordered a Grilled cheese pork sandwich and a pork shoulder dish. 

I was actually quite disappointed by the pork shoulder dish. I wish that the meat was a bit more juicy, but most of it was rather dry besides the part that has some fat on top of it. It didn't have much flavoring besides the toppings on top of the pork shoulder and I wish they had a dry rub or marinated it a bit before cooking it. The Brussels sprouts sides and the fries were amazing though! And the Grilled Cheese Pork Sandwich totally made up for it! It was sweet and salty all mixed together. Although it was slightly on the oily side, it tasted amazing and I didn't mind. 

Overall, I had a great dining experience here. The ambiance here reminds me of a cute southern town, and I just wish I ordered something else on the menu that they were probably more well known for. Until next time!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Tupelo Honey. I've eaten at both locations in Asheville, and was really excited for the one in Charlotte. It's located on the second floor and the interior decor is really nice. Exposed brick, window panels, and comfortable seating. Their menu is great too; I prefer their lunch and dinner menus, but brunch is decent. It can get a little pricey, but the food really is worth it. The parking kinda sucks because it's South End and there are other businesses in the complex, but that's to be expected in Charlotte. The hosting staff wasn't the friendliest on the handful of times we went, but that doesn't affect the food or the wait service!"}
{"text":"Love, love, Tupelo Honey Cafe.  I've been twice and already feel like a regular.  The staff are warm and friendly and make you feel right at home.  I can't say enough good things about this place...it's simple, down home, southern, delicious, good.  This place is a hidden gem in the Southend.  I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"Their fried chicken is AMAZING!  The mac n cheese is about average and the asparagus is good.  The biscuits are also very tasty!  Staff is always pleasant, and the restaurant is always clean."}
{"text":"Good looking dining area and friendly, knowledgeable staff.
I don't understand why they put the effort to label their side dishes as vegan on the menu, but not their entrees. The black bean burger is a good option, but needed a little hot sauce to please my taste buds. The Tupelo tofu wings are almost vegan, i believe just depending on your honey stance and are a favorite for the wife. 

Their craft beer list is respectable. A few from Asheville (Greenman, Highland), couple from Charlotte, with a few other nice national options. The bar area looked nice, separated from the main dining area.
Overall, they seem to be a really good fit for SouthEnd."}
{"text":"Biscuits.  I could just eat their biscuits and nothing else.  They were really, really good.  And guess what I had with my biscuits? Honey. Didn't see that one coming did you?  Both amazing.

Alright, so we ordered some other food too.  We had nachos (also pretty tasty) for an appetizer.  Though you really don't need anything other than biscuits.  For my entree I had the grilled cheese and pork sandwich with cole slaw.  I appreciated that their cole slaw wasn't runny and drowning in mayo.  With a southern style place, you never know.  I'm from New Orleans and we love our mayonnaise.  This coleslaw would not cut the mustard back home, but I dig it.  The sandwich was eh.  The bread was dry and there wasn't enough cheese on it to make the sandwich melty and juicy enough.  I ended up pulling everything out of the sandwich and discarding the bread.

Service was good, especially for their being over 20 of us.  I don't think there was a delay on anything.  Before eating, while we waiting for our entire group to show up, we sat on their balcony and were served our drinks while we waited.  It was a nice little spot to relax in."}
{"text":"Good food and good people. It can get a little crowded at peak times so I would suggest either off-peak hours or prepare for the crowds. 

Pretty good place all around, do suggest."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place and my husband surprised me with breakfast here to celebrate my birthday and that we just found out we're having our 1st baby. From the minute we walked in the staff was so kind wishing me a happy birthday and congratulating us on our news. Now onto the food, I ordered the pancake with friend chicken and my husband ordered the southern poutine scramble and the Queen bloody mary (wish I could've drank it!) Anyway, both our meals were delicious and our waiter William was attentive and informative with the menu options! We will definitely be back! Also, thank you to the manager Mike who gave us blueberry preserves and a couple of cookbooks as a gift, seriously the kindest think a restaurant manager has ever done for us!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Saturday at 1130. Had made a reservation, the hostess said they were running behind so we stepped into the bar. Bar service was terrible, they did not look our way the entire 10 minutes we stood there. There was a pair of girls hovering as well and they did not get served either. This is disappointing because to me it is a key tenet of a boozy brunch spot as it is easy to go elsewhere especially in brewery happy south end Charlotte. Thankfully we were sat shortly after, and service was great (aside for the 10 minute wait for drinks to return- really my only negative). 

Ordered the violet beauregard champagne cocktail; was a great first drink, sweet, but also the right amount of boozy. The rest of the table had Megamosas and Bloody Mary's, everyone was content. 

Was very excited to hear house-made biscuits were coming out, they were very salty which was strange. But slathered in jam and honey they were delicious. Not sure if the salt got tipped in extra or if that is the norm but I was confused.

I got the Eggs Betty. I'm a sucker for eggs Benedict and they did not disappoint. However, I've definitely had better and would go for a more traditional \"southern\" breakfast if I were to return. The potato cracklins were great, and would make sure to at least get a side of these if they were not part of my meal. A highlight was the blackberry jalapeño pulled pork burger- would recommend. 

All in all it's a great spot with a big patio as well- we came on a dreary day or would definitely be a great place to be on a nice day. Just hope they hire more bartenders to keep the crowd happy!"}
{"text":"Lets start with the biscuit basket with blueberry jam and honey. great start to an extremely satisfying meal. husband ordered Fried chicken and biscuits. I got the Shrimp and grits but replaced goat cheese with cheddar. The waiter easily accommodated my request. Great atmosphere, great service, fantastic food. I hope this place is still open the next time we come to Charlotte."}
{"text":"The wife and I took a trip to Charlotte for a weekend getaway and decided to try something different. I was going through Yelp and this place stuck out like a sore thumb. We sat outside and enjoyed the weather with refreshing drinks. 

Our server (Jamison) was attentive, nice and on target with our requests. We order the mason jar 4 dip selection. Very tasty and it came out fast. I also had the best biscuit with honey and blueberry compote I have ever tasted. Service was an A+ and the bathrooms were clean.

One thing I would like to mention is that you all should really consider selling your honey at the restaurant. It is absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places to eat, but my last few visits have been very disappointing.  First of all, maybe it is my imagination, but the prices seemed to have increased significantly over the past year.  I can't seem to remember anything on the menu less than $12.  Also, there are very limited gluten free options. I ordered a $14 sandwich with gluten free bread, and the bread was puny and ice cold.  Even the coffee was cold.  Please get better gluten free bread and consider adding one gluten free breakfast option such as gluten free pancakes. Lastly, the service was incredibly slow.  I'm on the fence regarding whether I want to return."}
{"text":"We ate here for brunch this past Sunday and it was fantastic. They were pretty slammed so it did take a bit to get out food but they keep us happy with their delicious biscuits and jam in the meantime. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I walked into with high expectations and walk out feeling like they were not met. While the biscuits and jam were stellar, the main course my group had (avocado toast, eggs betty, and shoo-mercy omelet) did not meet what other southern comfort establishments provide. This along with the staff's unwillingness to substitute fruit for potatoes made for an unpleasant experience. I hope this was just an off experience and not the standard at this establishment."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Selection is different which is nice.  High price for small portions.  Bananas Foster pancakes should be on the dessert menu.  So sweet!!  Staff did not seem happy at all."}
{"text":"Until today I wasnt sure what brunch was. I went in and sat on the patio with my wife, and the patio is cool. It was pretty hot but still felt nice. Our server was Hollyday and she took good care of us. The building is really neat and when I asked she told us all about its history, and answered all of our questions about honey and tupelo (cool stuff!). We got the breakfast bowl and the harvest bowl which were both good. We also got bloodymarys because of there awards for being the best in charlotte at the front. Service was good Food was good Tupelo honey is great"}
{"text":"I've been to Tupelo Honey now twice and absolutely loved both times. I came first for Brunch and then for dinner. The biscuits served are TO DIE FOR! I'm telling you - they may be the best biscuits I've ever had. Plus they are served with homemade blackberry preserves and honey to top. Delicious! For dinner I had the Appalachian egg rolls, which are southern pulled pork egg rolls served with a jalepeno bbq sauce. They were delicious and great alternative if you're looking for a smaller dinner portion. My fiance had the catfish and ate every last bite of it! Defintiely will be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"It's very hard to choose from their menu. Everything looks amazing! The food was delicious. We had lamb meatballs and goat cheese plate (I forgot what they call it) as our appetizer. The biscuits are awesome. I had a bite of the trout and ordered grilled salmon for myself. My tummy couldn't be happier. The server was very affable and attentive. They have a large patio and the decoration inside is pretty cool, especially the mechanism that works the fans. Overall, I had a great experience."}
{"text":"Nice place but the TWIST on Southern Food is a bit off I think. Not to mention it's all over priced. I think that is due to the location.  It was our first visit and I don't see another reason to go back at this point. The location is nice. The place is clean and well done only the price and food were just not what I expected."}
{"text":"Ok so first time visit today, it was very empty...probably due to the Panther playoff game.  We had no wait for a table.  

Service:
Average at best.  I had to remind my waitress twice to bring me lemon for my tea.  And while we are on it, the sweet tea, was fab..however the waitress kept topping me off with WARM sweet tea.  Yeah, by the end of our meal I had tepid sweet tea, but i did eventually get my lemons.

Food:
Here's where I'm torn.  I will probably revise this rating when I go back.  The biscuits, yum, scrum-dil-ioucious.  The Appalachian egg-rolls...well,they were very mushy inside.  The first bite was not very good, but when I got going they were tolerable, to pleasant...but the texture inside was mush, that is quite offputting.  My friend got the sweet potato pancake.  It is HUGE!  And she said it was good.  The mashed sweet potato side looked ordinary.  Now onto the reason why I'm so torn...I got the garlic chicken.  It is served with mac and cheese and a swish chard/asparagus side.  My entire plate was covered with grease.  Unsure where it was coming from.  Everything tasted good, but the grease was really off putting.  The chicken was very very garlicky.  I liked that, but in addition to being very garlicky, the topping was also incredibly salty.  Like almost inedible for the regular person.  I could do it b/c I like things on the salty side.

So at the end of the day I'm rating this place 3 stars.  I will most definitely be back.  So stay tuned.  Based on the hype I'm expecting my revised rating to be higher than my first visit.  We shall see."}
{"text":"I spent my birthday in a lousy environment with poor service and terrible food. I drove from Jacksonville FL to spend my birthday with family and friends in Charlotte/Concord. My best friend went to the honey Tupelo restaurant in Asheville and suggested weeks ago that we should have dinner at this restaurant. Being the foodie I am, I started researching and couldn't wait to dine here. 
We arrive at the restaurant on time for our reservation on a Wednesday night @615p. The floor was empty, and The hostess looked lost and started pulling tables together for our party of 10. We sat down and was greeted promptly by our server. We ordered or drinks, and waited a full 45 minutes for our first(and only) mixed drinks and even longer to begin our food order. Totally unacceptable. We were then informed there was a party of 35 and that our food would be delayed. Begrudgingly we all accepted. We ordered our food.

 what came next? Cold Food. One person didn't get their tacos till 20 min after our food was delivered. & We were still missing a kids Mac&chz. We were all starving that we inevitably shared and ate our dishes. But mid meal, our children started fussing that the food tasted bad. As parents this is not uncommon to hear. So we tried a spoonful of the buttered pasta.... sure enough it tasted like dirty dish water, one friend felt there was maybe some chemicals mixed in. It was just overall disgusting. 
The other kids dish we ordered was macaroni and cheese. Now, the portion of the macaroni in comparison to the buttered pasta was ridiculous. If I'm being generous it was a square 3inx3in piece on a tea plate. With no sides.

The adult plates, chicken fried steak was compared to a rubber boot. The sides of the flat iron steak, were severely bland Brussels sprouts. Almost as if they were boiled in the hospitals cafeteria and served to you for health not enjoyment. 

So I finally get the nerve to complain. I really am understanding. If the place was hopping, you have a serious wait. If the server was in the weeds about to wave her white flag. I'd totally get it. But what I encountered was the extreme opposite. An empty floor, with two parties, a 35 top (that was mid way they their meals when we arrived) and my 10 top. 

The manager came over, very apologetic. Discounted our check, removed the kids food, replaced the buttered pasta with grilled cheese. Did everything you should do for a disgruntled customer. He redeemed himself when he presented a free (bland, boring) chocolate cake and a Tupelo honey recipe book. 

BUT THEN it went down hill again. Took over 30 minutes to get our check after the dessert came. The bill was incredibly wrong. They triple charged us for one appetizer. They couldn't seem to understand that they needed to take 2 appetizers off since we only ordered one! So that added another 15 min. It was just a complete mess. We didn't leave till 830. Over two hours wasted at a poor quality, poor service, poor dining restaurant. 

Save your time and go somewhere else. The biscuits aren't even worth it."}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to sit at the chefs counter and eat our dinner while talking to and watching them prepare the various dishes, they were awesome.

The food was really good but the Pecan Pie and Banana Pudding was incredible.  Whatever you do leave room for desert."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for a special holiday group lunch. Even though the cafe was slammed, the wait staff was awesome. We had a group of 15 and were served by a very efficiently and in a friendly manner. Besides the A+ service, our food was delicious. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I had to wait fifteen minutes, but it was a Saturday around 11am, perfect brunch time. I went with the sweet potato pancakes, which were delicious with the peach cream and pecans and a little bit of maple syrup to make it wonderful. The wait staff was friendly to everyone around me and including myself. I usually eat alone and they even interacted with me and they were also pet friendly outside. Definitely a great brunch for families and couples, especially before noon in the late spring/early summer. Bathrooms and restaurant cleanliness was superb. I will definitely bring my significant other to eat with me here again. What a delightful cafe! 

Updated review: Definitely a great brunch place, even on a Sunday afternoon with a 15 minute wait and the omelettes were phenomenal!"}
{"text":"This is Tupelo Honey's sangria. When it comes to cocktails, I'm pretty straight forward. Just give me Tito's vodka on the rocks with a splash of lime and I'm in heaven. But this time, while having brunch with my girls, I stepped out of my zone and got the sangria. The drink was too sweet for my tastes, however, I have a huge appreciation for presentation and these cocktails were lovely. And if you (unlike me) like sweet drinks, you'll love this one. 

TIP: Always sit in the bar area if you can. It's fun and high energy. And make sure you get bartender Murphy. She'll make your drink however you like it and she's a sweetheart!"}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. We were visiting from out of town and found this in the South Side neighborhood. The Appalachian breakfast was a delicious item with an interesting take on black eyes peas. The Shakshuka was a tasty egg dish with grits and goat cheese. Service was prompt and Jordan our server was pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"Can I just tell you? I called a waiter to come stand next to me so I could slap him, the biscuits were so damn good! For real, though, best biscuits ever! I couldn't decide between the homemade jam and the Tupelo honey, so I used both. Delicious combination. Who would've thunk, pepper on a biscuit could add such bold flavor? I did manage to snarf down my shoo shrimp and grits, after I ate the two biscuits. 

I love the fact that they're into supporting local farms and businesses. #noble 

Our waiter, Jonathan, was crazy knowledgeable, knew his product inside and out, and was the perfect combination of professional and personal. I can't wait until Tupleo comes to Arlington in June. Yum, Yum! 

For great food and a great ambience, do the Tupelo!"}
{"text":"Where do I start?!?!? Seriously one of the best meals I have had. It all started when we walked in and was greeted by the hostess. She was very kind and quickly brought us to a lovely table. Our server, Julie, was quick to check in on our table and answered our questions about the menu. Julie was amazing with the service she provided from start to finish!

Now for the food...holy moly, it was out of this world. True southern food, everything made from scratch in house, farm to table. Every bite was better than the next! 

We had the brussel sprouts to start and the homemade ranch wonderfully complimented the delicious fried gems! I have had buttermilk biscuits before, but nothing compared to the buttermilk biscuit I enjoyed tonight. The accompanying honey and house made blueberry jam were icing on the cake, or biscuit in this case. We washed our delicious meal down with a tasty tropical drink in a pineapple and a craft root beer! Yes a whole pineapple. The fried chicken was on point, the ribs were fall off the bone, and all the sides (potato cracklings, corn soufflé, real southern grits, and fresh green beans) were tasty!!

No meal would be complete without desert...no idea how we were able to consume it, but we somehow managed. Per Julie's recommendation we had the banana pudding and the pecan pie....both were out of this world, balanced, and neither overly sweet. 

Bottom line...this is a must stop food spot!"}
{"text":"I had heard such good things about this native Asheville restaurant.  And moving into the great space formerly occupied by Pewter Rose gave me even more hope.  Sorry Van Morrison Tupelo Honey is not \"an angel of the first degree\"! .  The food was bland and the service was slower than grass growing on a Southern summer day!  There are too many other really good Southern restaurants in and around Charlotte to find your way here."}
{"text":"This place gets a solid \"4\" for ambiance! It's really cute, and the decor was kindof modern-rustic. Our server was also very sweet and efficient, which is very important to me.

But I don't go out to eat just for looks and service. I ordered their crab cake benedict and it was so bland, an issue that others in my party also complained about in regards to what they'd ordered. The bananas foster pancakes looked nothing like the picture; instead they just looked sloppily thrown together and completely unappetizing. One thing I frown upon is lack of effort in presentation, especially if the flavor is lacking. According to the recipient of these pancakes, they were entirely too sweet. Yuck.

I'd return to try their drinks, perhaps, but if I never returned I'd be ok, which actually disappoints me."}
{"text":"Everything about Tupelo was great! Service, atmosphere, the starter biscuits (were huge!!) with blueberry jam, goat cheese grits, cranberry mayo on the Charleston Chicken Sandwich, right down to my freshly squeezed orange juice mimosa :) And the mimosa was huge!! Well worth the $7. Yum!! Check it out :)"}
{"text":"Omg. Sooooo good. The food is so unique and special and SOOO delicious.  Our server Meg was very sweet and attentive. Loved her. Lucas also made us feel special giving us a reservation for our dog and having a bowl of water waiting for him when we arrived. If you're in NC you have to stop here. It's SOOO good. And the staff and ambiance is really special."}
{"text":"The biscuit is worth the trip. We were prepared to wait, and went at 1pm so it didn't take too long. I got a breakfast pie with grits and the pie was delish; flaky crust, tasty little dish. I wasn't crazy about the grits and I also tried the Mac and cheese. It says homemade but the color was a little fake looking to me. The mega mosa is a cute idea. My friend got meatloaf and it had an unusual looking red gravy, but almost every bite was eaten. 
I loved everything about the decor and floors. 
The hostesses were very nice and a manager checked on us a couple times. The only negative was that our server was soooooo overwhelmed. It took at least ten minutes for her to come to the table. Then longer to get our drinks .... She is either brand new or they need more staff."}
{"text":"I know people love this place, but it's truly overrated. My breakfast bowl was greasy and unpleasant, the mediocre coffee costs $3.50 (really?), and the pancakes are just plain heavy.  The service is good, and the spot is pretty, but if you're hoping to eat good food, there are a lot of better options out there."}
{"text":"If you love the southern style foods this spot is for you! We loved that the meal started out with warm biscuits and jams instead of a traditional roll that other restaurants serve. Everyone at my table had the Fried Chicken, which was the recommended meal for the group. I personally wanted to see more variety so I ordered the burger, it was very good, loved the friend pickles on it. However, after trying a bite of the Friend Chicken I immediately had FOMO. If it is your first time, or second that is definitely a must if you are unsure. I had a side of Mac n' cheese and would strongly encourage that decision. Others had the collard greens which looked like a tasty side as well. I would love to come back to give some other meals a try, maybe next time we are in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I met up with my brother and sister-in-law for my birthday brunch. I started off with the Moonswine Mary, a 16 oz. jalapeño-infused moonshine Bloody Mary with bacon garnish. Just the right amount of spice from the pepper, and you can never go wrong with bacon. 

For eats, I decided on the Super Southern Breakfast Bowl. Layered black-eyed peas, grits, eggs, bacon, cheese, and salsa. I'm not a big fan of peas (it's a texture thing) but everything was delicious. The grits were just thick enough, the eggs were great, and the two thick slices of bacon was a perfect addition. 

My fiance got the fried chicken with a side of fried okra, which both were out of this world. The okra was fried just enough to still retain it's crispy crunch and the chicken breast melted in your mouth the the creamy milk gravy. 

My brother got the Southern Fried Chicken BLT, which was HUGE! Mostly had to deconstruct and reconstruct it to be able to eat, but he had no complaints. He also opted for the fried okra side.

Sister-in-law got the Shoo Mercy Pancake. It came with candied pecans on top, which were not listed on the menu, so she removed those, but everything else was great with hers. 

Would definitely recommend, and will definitely be back for more at some point. Only reason it is not five stars is it took a while for our food to come out and to get our checks. We were seated right beside the waiters' computer, so it's not like we were tucked away in a corner, so that was somewhat frustrating, but I'm sure not a common thing for this restaurant."}
{"text":"I went to Tupelo Honey Cafe on a Saturday morning and was seated outside within 10 minutes. Our waiter was very courteous, attentive and informative and we found that be true of all the staff encountered.

We started with Mega Mimosas and a Bloody Mary which everyone enjoyed and got the Fried Green Tomatoes over Goat Cheese Grits as a starter. This was REALLY good, the only thing was that there were only 4 very small slices of tomato. I've never seen such a small green tomato but since we had our breakfasts still to come, it wasn't a big deal. The goat cheese grits were AMAZING though. I love goat cheese and grits and found these to be delicious! They put a lot of basil shreds on top which they could put a little less of but it's a nice flavor with the goat cheese. I just pulled some off.

My mom ordered the \"Samlette\", or omelette with salmon inside which she said she enjoyed, but wished the salmon inside was warm, as it was room temp to cool. I ordered over medium eggs one of which came out that way and the other was over easy but still good. They bacon was sort of fatty which I don't really like so next time I'll be sure to order extra crispy. We all really loved the biscuit with blueberry jam they give each person and we all left super stuffed and happy!

Over all it seemed a little pricey for what we got, but still a good meal and we would all return :)"}
{"text":"I wouldn't go back. Our waiter was so bad the manager ended up serving us. Hair was in our bread and the waiter said \"that's why it's free\".  Despite the rude service the food was good and we left an excellent tip for the manager who cleaned up his waiters mess.

They have great mgmt. I received a call from mgmt and expressed sincere apologies.   I may go back...."}
{"text":"Looking for a brunch spot for a birthday celebration on MLK day was a little more difficult than me and my friends expected but Tupelo Honey was suggested and was a good choice. I have heard a lot of great things about the restaurant so I was excited to try it out with my girls. 

The parking was ok, it is a fairly large parking lot but it was not many spots available. The restaurant was cute and the wait was not long for a group of 7. 
The biscuits and jam as an appetizer was good, I enjoyed them! the biscuit was a good cross between soft and crispy, it was buttery and enough to hold me until my entrée came. 
We all ordered drinks, most of the girls ordered mimosas, I am not a fan of orange juice so I ordered the red sangria and I LOVED IT! It was amazing! I really could've order a pitcher of it if it was possible. 
For my entrée I order the Shoo Moo pancakes, which is the sweet potatoe pancake with a fried chicken cutlet and bacon on top. It was a big portion, I could only eat about half of it. The dish over all was ok, the chicken was not seasoned to me and the wicked sauce I got on the side did not help or take away from the chicken. The overall conclusion by the group was the food was ok, the drinks were good and the restaurant was nice for a brunch type setting."}
{"text":"Tupelo Honey Cafe continues to be a crowd favorite with me. On this visit with my friend I had the jalapeno fried egg BLT and she had the Fried Chicken BLT my usual favorite. The jalapeno fried egg BLT was spicy, per my liking has I love spicy food and unusually good as I usually do not like my eggs fried. We were there on the night that they did half-price bottles of wine and we had a great Chardonnay full bottle of wine for $17.00. Our service that night was exemplary, to say the least, as we arrived around 3:30, when the lunch crowd was gone and the dinner crowd and yet to arrive. Bravo @tupulohoney I'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great good. Amazing service.
Chill environment even though it is busy and very popular spot. Flavors are unique but work well together. Will be coming back."}
{"text":"I really enjoy Tupelo Honey! I do find some of it to be a little over priced but really not bad. They have a good brunch menu to choose from. Really good Southern comfort food. I prefer their breakfast stuff slightly more then the lunch but both good choices. Good atmosphere and enjoyable spot! Parking can be tough on Saturdays and Sunday's sometimes. I would recommend trying!"}
{"text":"Too much butter in the food. Not a wide variety of vegetarian options. Service was good. Asparagus was bland. Just not very impressed with the flavor or presentation of the food here. Portions are a good size and the biscuits are good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots but it fell short today. Waitress and staff are super great but the food was just mediocre. The pimento cheese nachos came in a cereal bowl.. My husband ordered the flat iron steak and it was fair; covered in sauce..  I had the shrimp and grits, and they were cold- 3 shrimp and 2 extra dollars for hard, dry chorizo, not worth it. My daughter had the ribs that were good but nothing special. The margaritas looked promising but were missing the tequila! Biscuits are still good however for a 200 dollar meal, I gotta get something more yummy than biscuits."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I went here on our first date, so the day we got engaged we headed over for brunch. Tupelo Honey never disappoints. The service was super friendly. When I asked for a cork to commemorate our day, they gladly gave me a cork and came over with a Tupelo Honey cookbook to say congratulations, which they definitely didn't have to do. We will definitely be back- their biscuits and avocado toast are amazing!"}
{"text":"This weekend my husband and I met a work friend for Sunday brunch at Tupelo Honey Cafe. It was a very fine day in the Queen city. After a brief but very cold winter and a few false starts, I felt like finally Spring was happening. The sun was shining, the temperature neared the 60s and the drive was easy.

Tupelo Honey Cafe is located on the second story of a slightly nondescript building. The first thing that I noticed was a crowd waiting for tables to open up on a beautiful porch. The wait I hear can be long but the owners have done a very fine job of making everyone comfortable. Have a seat on the large porch and let the perfect Spring breeze calm you as you wait.

Fortunately, I had reservations (you can make these via the Tupelo Honey Website). We were seated almost immediately. When you walk inside, you will notice the high ceilings and the bright feel of the place. I loved the exposed brick and wood along with an open kitchen. I felt the spacious outside carried over into the inside very well. The place was packed but I never felt crowded and could have a nice conversation with my brunch-mates.

Our waitress was friendly but not overly so and checked on us appropriately throughout our meal. After we ordered, she brought us each a warm buttermilk drop biscuit and a serving of Tupelo Honey's blueberry jam. It was delicious. I thought the jam was perfectly balanced but could have used a tad bit of lemon.

I ordered the Southern Fried Chicken BLT sandwich with tomato soup as a side. My husband ordered Fried Chicken and my friend ordered the Shoo Mercy Pancake. We received our food in a fairly quick amount of time considering how packed the dining room seemed to be. My tomato soup was spicy and sweet and well seasoned. My husband is decidedly not a tomato soup fan but enjoyed the few spoonfuls that I shared with him. The chicken sandwich was massive. Perched between two buttered buns, a generous slice of tomato and fresh green lettuce, sat a hand battered fried chicken breast. Also, the bacon was to die for - sweet and smokey. My husband loved his biscuits and gravy and his chicken he said was delicious. My friend seemed to be relishing her massive, fluffy pancake.

We had a wonderful experience at Tupelo Honey Cafe. I am certain that we will go back and try their dinner service sometime soon. Most of the time I roll my eyes when I see buzz words like \"New South Flavors\" but Tupelo Honey Cafe feels sincere in their attempts."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Has become my daughter and me's go-to spot for lunch. Service was good even though busy, our dog was allowed on the porch, food was excellent and the cocktails - yum. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Resturant is great , food - great , service - great ... people are just awesome !!  Managers check on tables frequently .. love my experience"}
{"text":"Great flavors. Good service. Two stars is because my food was off temp. Pork steak was not hot, mashed sweet potatoes were not hot, collards were hot. The better half's buttermilk fried chicken meal was warm enough. Her sides were barely warm. 

Just poor kitchen management. 

This might explain the mixed reviews. 

Easy enough to fix. Most places have mastered the concept, I'm sure the owners can find someone to get the place back on a consistent track."}
{"text":"Biscuits: check!
Parking: check!
Fun, changing, seasonal menu: CHECK!

Went here for brunch with my friend, and ordered the salted beets. It was alright, a little heavy on the goat cheese (which is a very LOUD cheese, but I love it). I liked it a lot, but I was a way bigger fan of my friend's gigantic, delicious pancake! I definitely recommend checking out all 3 of their menus regularly for updates, and going after whichever item intrigues you. Odds are, you'' be VERY satisfied.

Oh, and DEFINITELY try the lavender lime (or something like that) soda. SO pleasant and refreshing!"}
{"text":"Great food, southern flare, biscuits & jam will make you want to workout for hours (guilty) all of my food was very tasty. And hot!"}
{"text":"Food here is excellent!! Great service! Very accommodating to large parties of people and the atmosphere was lovely..Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"This was the perfect spot to be at on July 4th. Our server Carrie( yes like Sex in the City) was very festive and super friendly. No wait. And the food and 4$ special martinis(tried all of them) were spectacular."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best shrimp and grits that I have ever eaten! They also bring you biscuit with preserves; it's such a nice touch and very good!"}
{"text":"The biscuits and honey are enough of a reason to come. The menu is varied and high quality. We split a black bean burger and spinach salad and it was fresh & flavorful. I just heard they opened a branch in VA from the manager  and I can't wait to go there and take my mom"}
{"text":"Tried the Tupelo Honey in Charlotte today for lunch.  Got a seat quickly at about 1:20 on Monday afternoon.   We have been here over an hour and all we have is the pimento cheese appetizer which I believe is subpar.  The tortillas  were way too salty and were not really edible.   Update:  I just received my Chicken BLT sandwich.... On a scale from 0-10, I would give it a 7, not bad but nothing special either. The side of macaroni cheese I got is about a 5 on a scale of 0-10. To me, it doesn't taste like baked macaroni cheese, but more like macaroni in cheese sauce. Would I go back? Absolutely not. With that being said, the manager stopped by our table and apologized for the abnormally long wait and comped our meal which was a nice gesture. Does it change my opinion? No."}
{"text":"I went for lunch with a co-worker. The service was fantastic and the food was amazing. I had the sweet potatoes pancakes with the fried chicken. I really enjoyed it! I wouldn't mind subtracting the eggs from the meal but either way great meal.

Will definitely be making this a favorite."}
{"text":"I've only lived in Charlotte for 2 weeks but both Sundays I have had brunch here and loved it. My first time I had reservation  (which I highly recommend) and had no wait at all, the other I had a 35 minute wait. I cannot wait to go back there again. The biscuits are amazing (I am from NY so really most southern biscuits are amazing), and the omlettes have been making me come back for more. I cannot wait to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"I had often heard good things about Tupelo Honey but hadn't yet gotten the chance to experience it. My girlfriend, who loves it, coaxed me into giving it a shot on a Thursday night around 7 pm, even though I was convinced it would be packed. Lo and behold, it wasn't - we were seated immediately, with a swiftness which would become a theme for the night. We each ordered standard Bloody Marys, which were spicy and had an intense bite. Complimentary biscuits aided our decision for a main course, and they were phenomenal. For dinner, she got a vegetable plate, allowing for a variety of items which included delicious sweet potato fries and mac and cheese, and I got the fried chicken BLT with my own side of mac and cheese. All of it was fantastic, and I cannot wait to go back to try everything else."}
{"text":"I've always heard about Tupelo Honey Cafe so I gave it a try for dinner.I ordered the Shoo Mercy Sweet Potato Pancakes.I would give the meal a 4 out of 5.First,it is a big serving size in my opinion as I was not able to eat it all.The chicken was covered in a sweet batter with pecans.The pancakes were tasty and fluffy like IHOP.The bacon was too sweet in my opinion.I requested my eggs to be scrambled.The grilled apple or pear (can't recall) was very good,as well as the inclusion of picked blueberries.That added a different twist to the meal.I expected more out of the complimentary biscuits as the restaurant is known for southern cooking.

Friends' feedback:The macaroni was not as good as people describe it;shrimp and grits were good but they have had better;trout met expectations 

Overall,I will visit the Tupelo Honey Cafe again and try the brunch next time."}
{"text":"Great southern food.  My wife and I have been here several times and are always impressed with the positive vibe the wait staff has and their great menu offerings.  Almost everything we've ordered has been better than expected and the drink menu is a nice complement to the food."}
{"text":"Amazing food, incredible atmosphere, and fantastic service. And, Tiara at the bar is hilarious...and she knows how to make one heck of an awesome drink."}
{"text":"the hostess was the only problem I had with this restaurant. when we walked in, she was rude and when I went to advise that we had found a spot in the bar/we could be removed, she was even ruder. but, that did not spoil a wonderful meal. I could have eaten the biscuits alone with the blueberry jam. My goodness...heaven. We had the French toast and shakshuka as well. I would have liked something other than grits, eggs, and avocado as part of the shakshuka. I had a side of chorizo added, but the amount of grits was overwhelming to the dish. Maybe some potatoes or a smaller portion. Overall, excellent food and worth the visit for the jam alone."}
{"text":"Interesting menu, with some good flavors.  Pimento cheese could have been more flavorful and with some spice.  Fried okra needed some seasoning.  We went during busy time, so initial service could have been better, but was redeemed.  Overall great experience and good amount of food."}
{"text":"I was recently in Charlotte for the CIAA weekend, and on Sunday before my flight back to DC, we were searching for a yummy brunch spot to top off the trip. We stumbled upon Tupelo, and despite being told that there was about a 45 minute wait, the kind hostess suggested that we try to find a place in the bar area, which was first come, first served. Thanks to her, we ordered a mimosa (super good and strong) from the bar and hovered around searching for the tell-tale signs of a group getting up.

We spotted a table becoming empty and we bum-rushed it, and a friendly server Cesar came and got our table clean right away. He was SO friendly, personable, and knowledgeable about the menu. My friend was vegan, so he also made great suggestions for that as well. Our mimosas were SOO good that we had to get another, and I ordered the Macaroni & Cheese with the Cajun Blackened Shrimp. I felt so greedy gobbling it down but it was so stinkin' good! Cesar checked on us frequently despite having a plethora of tables and other customers to attend to.

The prices are very reasonable, and again, the mimosas were so good! We even stopped by the hostess stand afterwards to speak to the manager, who was also super warm and friendly. I found out that they are opening more locations in the US, so I now have a favorite spot to go to when I come back to Charlotte! Definitely a place where I would return, please keep up the good work."}
{"text":"So I have learned the trick is to come for brunch!  After visiting for an unimpressive dinner a couple years I lost interest.  Somehow I found myself in Denver near Union station enjoying a brunch at the Denver location and once I was back in Charlotte, my faith had been restored.

I have come here for brunch now a few times and its delicious!  The Tupelo play on shrimp and grits is rich and delicious.  The shareable avocado toast points are so yummy.  The pecan pie french toast was a bit too much for my yankee spirit but tasty nonetheless.  The brunch cocktails are great too.  Ive tried both the spring and summer sangrias (*which seem to be seasonal) and they are both excellent.
The service was also consistently good.  The staff is attentive and engaging.  While there is outdoor seating I always opt for inside, as the outside can become crowded with people waiting to be seated.
Sidenote, you can book a reservation on OpenTable to avoid super long waits but the hosts do make the wait somewhat pleasant by inviting you to grab a cocktail at the bar.

Nice job Tupelo!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love Tupelo Honey! Sometimes there is a wait, but it is always worth it. Goat cheese shrimp and grits are to die for! Biscuits and jam/honey is a nice touch as well. And yes, it is a little big and can get a little loud... but the food is good. #southern"}
{"text":"We had a great time on the patio for lunch today! Our waiter, Jonathan, he gave great recommendations and was so fun.  Hope to sit in his section again! From the moment we arrived, the manager, Josh, was so wonderful and personable. Great people like Josh and Jonathan make this place special. And of course the food was great, as usual! I had the Charleston Chicken Sandwich - the cranberry spread is YUM - and the shaved brussels side dish is one I'm definitely going to try my best to replicate at home :)"}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the service is great! 

I ordered the Rosemary peach lemonade- wow so good. It's not too sweet and its refreshingly different. I very quickly consumed the biscuits and blueberry jam so all I can say is they were delicious to the last bite. 

The server's recommendations were right on point: jumbo shrimp with cherry peppers, and the curried chicken thigh. The quality was good and the food was bursting with flavor. 

I also got the pecan crusted goat cheese appetizer on the house! Let me tell you, I still think about that appetizer- you can't fit wrong with figs, pears and pecans- yum. 

Anyways, you should definitely try this place for dinner and I hear their brunch is amazing too."}
{"text":"We got a variety of dishes here on our business trip! The waitress that helped us was very sweet and knowledgeable about the menu. I've heard a lot of great things about Tupelo honey so I was excited to try! The wine was okay and the appetizers were delicious! I loved the okra and the Brussel Sprouts!! Yum. The burrata appetizer was really good as well. However, a little disappointed in the entrees. The salad that on of our colleagues for was really dry and didn't taste fresh at all. the steak was extremely dry. I got the grits and scallops and that was okay. The scallops were good but those grit cakes were very dry. 
Really cute atmosphere and restaurant, though! We loved the set up and loved our seats outside. Great customer service. Just meh food"}
{"text":"Great Place ! The customer service was great . We were seated in less than 2 mins . Ordered our food it came out within 10 mins or possibly less . Our waiter was very honest with his recommendations. If your looking for a drink I recommend getting the peach mahi drink . I'll just say they DO NOT skimp on the alcohol . This drink was very good , food was good as well ! Will be returning"}
{"text":"First time to tupelo in Charlotte!  Busy on Sunday morning but got seats at the bar!  Super fun atmosphere and the drink menu was awesome!  Got fresh biscuits while waiting with honey, delish!  The goat cheese grits were awesome and has a custom omelet! Great food for the price!  So glad it's in Charlotte now!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! Great prices and great food...PS they also have a location in Asheville"}
{"text":"Wow..! 

Brunch here is great! Try the chicken and waffles.. with a mimosa..!

Service can be slow, waits can be very long and the bar is limited as to what they know how to make. Stick to the basics and you should be ok."}
{"text":"My first time to tupelo honey was for breakfast today and I think I'll be back for dinner. Thanks Matt for extraordinary service and Haley for the chit chat about the amazing drink menu. I am 100% sure I'll be a regular here, the food is ridiculous it's so good. Five stars isn't enough."}
{"text":"Love this place and their eggs benedict, a definite go-to breakfast 
place for hubby and I!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Word. This was my favorite meal in Charlotte! We came for brunch on Sunday and were pleasantly surprised there wasn't a huge wait! 

I ordered the southwestern omelette and it was one of the best I've had! It had chorizo in the middle with salsa, avocado, cheese and topped with sour cream. My husband got a fried chicken dish and loved it. Our friends got the Southwestern omelette and the breakfast bowl. We were all impressed with our selections and the portions were just the right size. 

This was an awesome find. My husband and I keep saying we wish we had this place in Chicago!"}
{"text":"First time at Tupelo-Charlotte and it was a great experience. EXCELLENT service from Johnathan in the bar area. It is rare to find someone that really tries to figure out what a customer likes, and wants, then recommends selections to match their tastes. Even better since the food is on point. Great work!"}
{"text":"Typical southern food. Service is always good. Normally can get sat pretty quickly even when they are busy. Decent for a weekend brunch spot as well. 

The biscuits and jam are amazing! That jam is fire! Hard not to fill up on biscuits & jam before your food gets to you. They are a home run for sure, but what is not a home run is The Queen Mary. 

Table ordered Queen Mary's for brunch cocktail to ease our suffering from the night before. It came to the table and it was yellow which we all were like \"alright this could be cool, it's got bacon and other stuff in it. Anything with bacon is good, right?\" WRONG. This thing is made with like mustard or something and was super chunky and all three of us took a sip at the same time and got that sour puss face, and spit it out. Swing and a miss! Hate sending anything back but dear baby jesus it was bad. Server took care of us and got us 3 regular bloody marys and we were set."}
{"text":"Two words: AMAZING restaurant. My girlfriend and I visited this gem after reading the great reviews while traveling from New York. The waiter was extremely kind and attentive, as well as the hostess who, after finding out we were tourists, gave us a free jar of their jam to take home as a souvenir. Needless to say, we will eat here again the next we visit Charlotte.

TLDR: 
Food 10/10
Service 10/10
Atmosphere 10/10"}
{"text":"While no expanded location can ever be good as the original in Asheville, it is clear that this Tupelo Honey Café knows what they are doing and doesn't have a problem filling up the space on a Saturday night.

Biscuits brought to the table like breadsticks or chips made our party of four oh so happy before digging into our filling meals. I am glad I ordered the flounder, but the fried chicken will most certainly be ordered on a return visit. Hushpuppies are an obvious choice for a side and while the mac n cheese wasn't anything extraordinary, it did hit the spot. Options for my vegetarian friend and the salad options were serious, although probably not that healthy. I liked the decorations and well-appointed bathroom. The service was great and parking easy, although we were there on the earlier side of the dinner rush at 6:15pm.

I would like to go back to try their $6 Monday special on Shoo Mercy Burgers or $3 Taco Tuesdays and some may like the $10 bottomless mac-n-cheese on Wednesdays, but I believe they have already changed their menu, so keep an eye on their evolution. Haberdish over in NoDa is all the rage right now, but if you want a similar southern food staple experience, go enjoy the winning formula at Tupelo Honey Café."}
{"text":"I'm glad I tryed this place, it's nothing fancy but good food and excellent customer service

Tried the fried green Tomatoes (very first time trying them) i'm so glad I tried them here because it wasn't just the fried green tomatoes that made it so good it was the sauce with the fried green tomatoes. They were fried perfectly crispy and definitely flavorful.  I was really surprised how good it tasted!  

I also tried the scallops again really really good, the flavor and texture to me was just as good as the scallops at McCormick and Smiths. They were not as big as McCormick and Smith, but just as tasty.

I also had the sweet potato pancakes topped with fried chicken, bacon, butter and syrup:) . I am not a pancake fan, really don't like them to much But these were so good......everyone should try.  If i could change anything about the food it would be to have dark meat instead of white I just don't like white meat and also maybe making a chicken a little bit more salty. (I might only feel that way because of the white meat flavor) Texture of fried chicken was perfect, I just don't understand why they only Cary white meat?? it can't be health reasons,,,,,not when serving with bacon and pancakes"}
{"text":"A very tasty and trendy place. Perfect for the surrounding neighborhood of yuppies and millennials (I do mean that in a nice way). The food is very good and the prices aren't horrible. Parking is a pain in the butt in the week and be long sometimes but well worth it"}
{"text":"The food was okay.  It didn't send my tastebuds to another dimension, but it was good. I ordered the blackened salmon -which needed ask me type of sauce to make it taste better.  The waiter gave me maple honey to try, which gave it a little more taste. I asked if he had anything else....he gave me the marinade that they use on their wings.  It was a combination of soy sauce, pineapple juice, and orange juice.  This combined with the maple butter gave it what it was missing.  The fried okra was really good.  I also got Mac and cheese which had a little kick to it.  They stated that it was made from scratch so I was thinking that it would be something baked.  

Overall, the food was okay, the service was good, and I would give them another try, but would want to try some other recipes of course."}
{"text":"We've been here a number of times and have zero complaints. Great food, great service, parking. What more can you ask for? The meatloaf. The meatloaf. So good. The biscuits? Fried Green Tomatoes? Have those, too, and you'll be a Happy Camper."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times before, but this visit was probably my favorite! 
The waitress (I cannot remember her name...) was very polite and kind. While we were looking at the menu she asked if we had questions - and she was able to answer them all and seemed honest about her responses. It was happy hour, so I ended up getting a martini to drink. For my entree I ordered the iron steak with brussel sprouts and fingerling potatoes as the sides. 
The biscuits are my favorite part of the meal! They are homemade and still warm when served. They come with a side of homemade blackberry jam and honey. THEY ARE AMAZING! If they had all you can eat biscuits, I would be there in a heartbeat! 
For the entree, it was delicious as well! The steak had a pepper sauce on it - although it was not really saucey, but it was still pretty good. Had a little heat to it, but they did a light 'sauce' so it was perfect! The steak was cooked absolutely perfect - medium, of course. I am not a huge fan of brussels, but they were actually good! Plus they mixed the fingerling potatoes with the brussels. The potatoes was cooked perfectly, and seasoned to perfection! 
I was beyond full after eating the large portion they consider dinner, and did not get a dessert. 
I am excited to keep coming back here!"}
{"text":"Wings were awful. Barely sauced and I got charged extra for them to split wings 6 buffalo 6 garlic parmesan. After the bartender asking us to wait 10 minutes for the food it was ice cold, and it wasn't even all that busy at the bar. Also ask for extra blue cheese which we got charged for and only got two to go ramekins. I don't know if the other menu items are awesome it seems like they got really great reviews unfortunately I wouldn't waste your time effort or money on the wings."}
{"text":"Love this place.  I do like the change of menu and drinks however it can be a double edge sword if you have a favorite and it disappears!  Atmosphere is great.  Wait time can be a bit long so if you are going on the weekend, get on line and make a reservation."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in Charlotte to eat brunch. Perfect when you have guest and you want to show off the city. Just be prepared for the wait to be a little bit longer than desired. I always get the chipotle chicken wings and fries. You will have to get the chicken wings from the appetizer menu. The fries are good too. They have awesome French toast. I also would suggest that you get the warm biscuits. The biscuits are very very fresh. Sweet tea is superb. I would not suggest the jam. Ask for the warm syrup."}
{"text":"I recommend not going when they are busy, the wings were dope and trust me I know wings. But Mine and my partners dishes were dry, seemed like they had been sitting out for a while. Again I recommend not going when they are busy and have time to make things fresh"}
{"text":"Had a great time. Wonderful food, swift service, great atmosphere. This is southern charm at it's best!"}
{"text":"The fella and I have been waiting for all the excitement to die down, and we were excited to try TH for breakfast one Sunday morning.  They open at 8:00, and we got there at 8:02 - did I mention we were excited?

The Bee Line wasn't working, which the fella was bummed about, and we were the first ones there.  The wait staff was still in the midst of their morning meeting when our hostess slooooowly walked us to a table smack dab in the middle of the walking path.  We asked to switch to a booth.  The inside looks totally different than when it was Pewter Rose - more casual, bright and family-friendly.  I was amazed at how much more seating TH had than PR... much better use of space.

Our waiter was visibly ill, which was a pretty big turn-off.  The biscuits - as some other Yelpers have noted - were half the size of the ones in Asheville.  What the heck?!?  The breakfast menu also seemed about half the size of Asheville's.  I only saw one sweet dish (the sweet potato pancake), and the rest were savory.  Not even a granola dish like Asheville has... bizarre for such a crunchy, granola sort of place.

The fella and I both got the country breakfast ($7.95), but split on all the options.  I don't like sausage, but his sausage patty beat my maple peppered bacon - which was way more pepper than maple - hands down.  The eggs were solid, and my home fries were delicious, but more like potato slices instead of chunks like I expected.  The fella isn't a big fan of goat cheese grits, but he said TH's were pretty darn good.

Overall, I wanted to like TH Charlotte as much as I like TH Asheville, but perhaps another visit is in order after they really get in the swing of things."}
{"text":"THC is where you want to go if you are seeking southern comfort food. Everything I've had on the menu has been excellent and the service has been great. Their bacon wrapped meatloaf, mac 'n cheese, and fried okra are a perfect combo. Plenty of beers on tap too. Prices are $$. Sometimes it can be busy so call ahead if you want to check on the wait."}
{"text":"The food choices here rotate about every month or so, according to our waiter.  One of the options that has stood the test of time is the Southwestern Omelette. I ordered it and really liked the balance between the Chorizo and the avocado and cheese. I recommend it. 

Other people in our party ordered the catfish, which was mildly flavored, the sweet potato pancakes(these are a must!), and the fried chicken and waffles(tasty and very filling!) 

Tip: 
The sweet tea is refillable for no extra cost. 

The reason for my 4stars is that the service was very slow paced. Maybe that's the southern style, I'm not sure. We had reservations for 12:30 on a Monday and we were told they were 10 minutes behind; it was confusing because when we were seated, plenty of open tables were stretched out behind our table. The food was good, but the service wasn't the quickest."}
{"text":"Great service.  Great food.  The fried chicken, biscuits and gravy was a standout.  Great recommendation by William."}
{"text":"Having had experiences at several other locations, and previous visits to this location, I had high expectations.  This last visit a week or so ago showed that things have gone down hill here fast.  And even sending my experiences to that location directly didn't even warrant a response, so it shows they really don't care.

It was right before a morning busy time, so not many people in yet.  Our waitress was nice, but slow.  The orders came out and both were awful.  The eggs benedict dish had eggs cooked so much, they were just about hard boiled, and the french toast was egg saturated thin bread with uncooked egg.  We sent them both back. They eventually came back out, but not much better.  The benedict eggs were hardly runny at all, and the french toast apparently used Wonder bread, and was heaped with the largest mound of ultra-sweet pecan pie filling that it was practically inedible.  The waitress wanted to argue when we sent them back saying that the eggs were supposed to be that way and that the french toast \"didn't have any egg\" because it was french toast.  Huh??!!!

Anyway, normally when a business shows an interest in their customer's experiences when contacted directly, I will give them another chance, but since they don't care, I thought I better warn people about this location:  if you have had a great meal at other locations, prepare to be sorely disappointed at this one."}
{"text":"If you go to THC for the food only, you'll might be pleased.  However, when a meal comes with asparagus, I expect more than three spears when that's the only green/veggie on the plate.  Cauliflower was okay.  They seem to be very big on mac and cheese, which is also okay, but I've had better. Very noisy atmosphere, had to yell to be heard across the table.  Wait staff needs training.  Waiter and runner reached across the table to set down plates and drinks, even though three sides of the table were accessible.  Water never refilled.  Got one dinner order wrong.  Had to ask for the complimentary biscuits. The four of us agreed, one time here was enough."}
{"text":"True southern food with a twist, Tupelo Honey has terrific drinks and food. With excellent portion sizes and bread to begin, you cannot leave this location still hungry. It has a great atmosphere in an upstairs area although it has tight seating. They have multiple locations around the United States and I would go to this brand no matter where I traveled!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! My 2nd lunch here to celebrate my neighbor's (who's like my daughter) 21st birthday! I got the tomato soup with grilled cheese with havarti & pimiento cheese with fried green tomato & caramelized onions! Huge meal so I brought half my sandwich home! Complete yumminess!!  Our waiter recommended the Birdsong Jalapeño Ale which complemented my meal very well!  

So many things on the menu sound terrific! I will definitely be back! I love brunch so I've got to check it out!!"}
{"text":"Tupelo Honey is off the hook.  That jalapeño burger is divine, and they are very friendly.  The one in Asheville gets very busy, so plan to wait."}
{"text":"Tupelo Honey has great food and a great atmosphere. Jordan and Bailey we're good servers. I would definitely recommend this place to eat brunch."}
{"text":"Not bad, especially for a quick Saturday brunch.  Parking is difficult.  I recommend taking the train. Don't go at night."}
{"text":"4 Stars is exactly what the rating for this restaurant to be. Went there Sunday morning around lunch time and only had to wait roughly 25 minutes which is not bad for Charlotte for the time being. Once we sat down we were attended immediately and had our drinks and complimentary biscuit and blueberry preserves which are a little to hyped up by the other reviews I read prior to coming to the establishment because the blue berry preserves weren't really flavor able but the biscuit itself was soft and tasty. Ordered the fried green tomatoes which arrived in less than 5 minutes. Tomatoes were incredible since they say the on top of some goat cheese grits that had a mild sauce on it. I ordered the fried chicken and pancakes which was a first for me since I've only ever heard of chicken and waffle. I had substituted the bacon for sausage since I don't like bacon( I know I'm Un-American) which was layered on top of the pancake and on top of the sausage was that soft but crispy fried chicken. Too top it off all of these was covered with pecans which I thought was odd at first then realizing that I lack pecans in my regular breakfast entrées. The pancake itself tasted as if a Caucasian teenage female was reincarnated into a pumpkin and put in the pancake batter, not too sweet and not too Starbucks so it was perfect. My date had ordered the fried chicken and biscuits which she wasn't unsatisfied but she had wished that she had ordered one of the omelet a that were floating by the room. It was a lot to eat and we ended up getting to go boxes and a banana pudding to go because that's one of our favorite desserts. The banana pudding was delicious and wasn't to much were it made you fall into an instant food coma but the bananas and wafers tasted fresh even after we put in in the fridge for about 2 hours. In summary staff was excellent and nothing beats comforting southern breakfast so I would definitely go back and try the shrimp and grits."}
{"text":"This place is great! They give you so much food. Good southern comfort food. Don't go before 12 pm on Sunday though or you cannot partake in any alcoholic beverages."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast and had a really good time. We were able to be seated as soon as we walked in with no problems. They also have complimentary parking. We sat outside where we was covered in a shaded area. The wait staff was great, attentive, knowledgeable and patient with us since it was our first time eating there. 

The food was really good too. I had the sweet potato pancakes and scrambled eggs and she had the shoo fly shrimp and grits. The biscuits with jam/honey was soo good too. They were not skimping on the champagne in our mimosas either lol. 

Overall this was a great place to have breakfast in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Love it here! The food came out before our bisquits thats how quick they are! The staff is so friendly and the environment is very chill and relaxed. I had the avocado toast and it was a light and refreshing breakfast. I could tell everything was fresh!"}
{"text":"We had a great start to our 4th this morning. Iris was our waitress and she was a joy!  I wish every waitress was as awesome as she is."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. Was very excited when this Asheville staple came to town. Chicken fried chicken and shrimp and grits are to die for. Drinks are always on point as well!"}
{"text":"First off I love the vibes of this place, and their biscuits are TO DIE FOR. But I feel like I had waaay to high of expectations when I came here for brunch. We asked for an outside seating, which was a must because the weather was lovely!! I see a lot of families coming here all dressed up nicely for brunch - love(: I came here wanting to order their French toast or shakshuka which I saw on their menu online, but I was so disappointed to not see it on their menu! (Whyyyy) So I stuck with the kale grilled shrimp salad and the lavender limenade. The lavender limenade was really good! You could taste the lavender and they didn't overly sweeten it so still had the sourness from the lime which is perfect! But the salad, whyyyyy does it taste like I'm eating straight up grass? The yogurt dressing was okay, the pears added a hint of sweetness- great, shrimp was big and banging but the lettuce and radishes tasted like they straight up ripped it up from the ground. My cousins ordered the fried chicken burger, it looked SO bomb but it was legit sitting in a pool of grease. (I'm not even exaggerating) Also, the fries were super duper soggy & tasted like regular frozen fries. Overall the presentation of the foods were awesome! But the taste sadly disappointed me. If I'm ever coming back it would be for sure for the biscuits!"}
{"text":"Great experience! We visited expecting greasy southern food, wow I was pleasantly surprise! We started with he pulled pork egg rolls, something I normally wouldn't order but they were delicious!! 

I had the Southern Plate with Grilled Salmon, the quinoa and the cheesy mashed cauliflower! AMAZING!! Salmon was cooked perfect and seasoned great and the sides were so good! 

Give them  a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Big fat YUM! Great drinks, delicious food! TPC has an atmosphere that is bright and airy for dining. The bar has fun lights over each table that harken of yesteryear."}
{"text":"My hubby and I were together for one night only during a recent family extended trip to Charlotte. We celebrated our 13 year anniversary at Tupelo Honey. We hadn't heard of it before. We live in TX. But we just searched yelp and found another review an decided to try it out. We were so pleased with our dinner. We had the fried green tomatoes, and the sweet potato pancakes with the Tupelo honey beer. Also we sat on the patio. It was a great way to celebrate. I have been thinking about those tomatoes most days since. I really wanted to try the beet salad too but I was just too full. Super yummy. Get the banana pudding for dessert. Oh also! Our server Destiny was clearly not only serving our table, but our service was perfect and personal. She didn't miss a beat and we felt spoiled by her attentiveness."}
{"text":"I have been to the original in Asheville before and after it was famous with wonderful experiences. The location in Charlotte is a tourist trap. The food is exceptionally expensive for what is served. A $15+ salad should never be served with ice berg lettuce. The food does have taste and the biscuits are amazing. This place needs turnover because of the long waits. It doesn't make it a very take your time, enjoy yourself experience. Together, the waits, the rush, and the prices for this experience just aren't worth it when considering other nearby local locations that have reasonable prices, better food and a warmer dining experience."}
{"text":"Wow-I get what the fuss is about! Fantastic flavors and a great menu selection. Brunch is outstanding. This is a hearty menu, so If you are after a lighter fare, this isn't your spot. I highly recommend the red flannel hash and a side of grits. Country ham is tops. I do wish the coffee was a bit stronger. The staff is dedicated, and good, but they could use a few more people."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, yes! 

First time to visit this restaurant today and it was amazing! Chicken & waffles...whoa...heavenly!

Our server, Jonathan, was one of the best we've had anywhere--made the meal extra special with our friends.

I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was great but the service was so-so. We had a large party so I expected the staff to be a little frazzled as they should be serving people is not easy. But the attitude, eye rolling, and huffing from the hostess was not necessary. Would go back for the grits and biscuits but because of the attitude it would not be my first choice for brunch."}
{"text":"Food was awesome and Jonathan our waiter did a great great job!! He was helpful, nice and quick to bring out food. The biscuits were my fav part!"}
{"text":"This place has a great vibe. The staff is pleasant and the food looks appealing. I had fried green tomatoes over grits. The tomatoes were good but some of them were too hard. The grits were surprisely excellent. I also had a raspberry ginger type martini. Very good."}
{"text":"What a great breakfast spot! We got there early on a Sunday morning to beat the wait and it was worth it. I had the breakfast bowl - the goat cheese grits are rich but delicious. My boyfriend had the fried green tomato
BLT - also delicious. 

Love the decor and all of servers and hostesses were courteous and attentive. I would definitely recommend Tupelo Honey for a yummy weekend brunch but get there early or else you'll most like face a wait."}
{"text":"What a cute brunch spot!!  It looked like a pretty house in here, and the outdoor seating is beautiful as well.

I had their super southern breakfast bowl, which came with some eggs, tons of goat cheese grits (yum), black-eyed peas, salsa, cheese and bacon.  It was delicious!  Oh, and I absolutely loved how we all got our own individual biscuits with jam to start off with.  Gotta love biscuits!!

The only con is what a lot of other Yelpers mentioned-service is really slow!  It took a good 45 minutes to get our food after we ordered."}
{"text":"A little pricy, but we'll worth it! Food is fresh and there is a variety of things to choose from! I've never seen this place empty, so that says it all!"}
{"text":"The food here was fantastic. A mix of high quality gourmet ingredients and traditional southern comfort food was a total win. Their goat cheese grits are divine and so is their blueberry jam."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Our server, Kendra, our was friendly but that did not make up for the bland tasting burger that I ordered. I had the pimento burger with fried pickles and it tasted like a paper sandwich. I did not taste the meat. It was as though the burger was washed in water then grilled. The restaurant was extremely packed so if you plan on going, you should call ahead and make reservations. The food prices were overpriced and my burger was not worth $14. I had better burgers at Burger King. I don't think that I will be going back.

I went back on 4/7/2018 to giveTupelo another chance. We had chipotle wings, sweet potato pancakes with eggs and fried chicken, shrimp and grits and fried chicken with gravy, Mac and cheese and collard greens. Totally different experience. Alec was our server and he was great: friendly, attentive and personable. The food was satisfying and came out fast. We went during non peak hours so there was no wait time to be seated. Great time. The food was excellent and the management, Yohan and April made us feel appreciated."}
{"text":"I came here with my brother for lunch and it was good! I had the fried chicken BLT. I enjoyed it very much."}
{"text":"Very good food! We have had dinner and brunch and both times really enjoyed the food and atmosphere."}
{"text":"They couldn't get bacon right after 3 tries. Not a fan of any of their food. Parking was a nightmare."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch and had the country breakfast gf had the jalapeño bacon and egg blt. Both really good! Loved the goat cheese grits and homemade biscuits with jam. Sat out on the front patio which was super nice and the waiter was very attentive and welcoming. Good place to check out."}
{"text":"We ended up here mainly because Leroy Fox South End SUCKS!! So we came across Tupelo on Yelp and since it was close by we decided to give a try. We were craving some southern comfort food so it seemed like the right choice. It was interesting seeing Angie Harmon (Law & Order)  at the bar, but on to the review. 

 We were greeted immediately and seated promptly. Maria our server was excellent. The sweet tea was delicious, the complimentary biscuits were meh! Their menu is very limited and to my surprise they DO NOT serve any mashed potatoes! Unreal, a southern restaurant that doesn't serve mash is blasphemy. 

 From their limited menu I picked the Blackened Catfish which was very fishy accompanied with baked Mac & Cheese and French fries. The sides were actually pretty good. We also ordered the Buttermilk Fried Chicken and that was very good! 

Their portions are fair, but their prices are steep. The sweet tea is delicious and as usual it's free refills. 

The main reason for the 2 star review is due to the limited menu with no mashed potato on it, and the absurdly small portion of banana pudding which they charge $6.50 for! The container is so tiny and to make matters worse, they don't even fill the container! GREEDY!!! 

It's definitely not an authentic Southern Restaurant and more of a tourist trap. I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Disappointed.     Out of corn soufflé.   Green beans were not cooked consistently and hash puppies were over cooked"}
{"text":"Talk about delicious! The pairing of goat cheese grits and red pepper and basil flavor the fried green tomatoes to perfection in a way I didn't know possible! Staff was more than friendly and the timing of the food was great too. Definitely recommend this for any time you want something special and different."}
{"text":"Holliday was a wonderful server, was such a pleasure to eat here and the service is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Delicious chicken salads! I didn't expect the variety of chicken salads.  I had the Italian--a pesto and dried tomato chicken salad. DELICIOUS! Try out this place.  It's homey and nice. 

BTW, I, for the first time in my life, left my purse at the restaurant.  I called 10 minutes later, and they had my purse and even though they were closed, they waited for me to come back to get it.  When I offered them some money, they refused, and this sweet woman said she is just so glad they were able to return it to me and no harm be done."}
{"text":"This place was so good visited here in Asheville and here in Charlotte on our NC trip!  I love that they have brunch foods all day for lunch!"}
{"text":"Best brunch in town, hands down!  The food is fresh, locally sourced, masterfully prepared and artfully presented. We love coming here, the ambiance is just a perfect blend of casual, rustic elegance to make you feel right at home.  The GM Johan does such an outstanding job making sure everything is running perfectly from the smiles and warmth of the host staff to the precise delivery of every dish coming out perfectly and at the right time. It was very busy today for brunch but our server was on top of it and we had a wonderful time.  I had the veggie burger (made vegan) and the hand cut fries...yummmm!!! And my husband had the chicken and biscuits, which of course was scruCan't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Walked right in and seated quickly...on a Saturday night!  Menu had lots of southern comfort foods.  We ordered 4 dishes, my favorite bring the melt in your mouth fried okra(possibly the best I've had!!)  Outside seating on the upstairs balcony was nice too."}
{"text":"The red sangria was killer. The ribs were amazing. The crispy Brussel sprouts were to die for. The pecan pie was incredible. I don't think you can go wrong as far as ordering goes. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"First visit here. Highlights: good food all around, fried shrimp appetizer, lots of healthy options, teriyaki kale is a thing (a good thing). Lowlight: overpriced. THC has got a nice/hipster/upscale country-diner feel to it. There are a lot of free-range and organic and gluten-free options on the menu (see hipster feel above)(they even carry Omission beer, for (1) those w gluten allergies and (2) those who don't understand gluten but avoid it anyway). But the food really is good. The blueberry jam (w biscuits), the fried shrimp (w basil and spicy aioli), and  the FRIED OKRA were my favorites. Part of the price is the organic, free-range, hormone-free thing, another part is the location. Portion size does help in this department though, you will have lunch for the next day. Also, I noticed they have $2 pints on Mondays, which is a decent deal for CLT."}
{"text":"What a great place for a vegetarian! They have tons of veggie options and entrees, even things like subbing soysage for bacon in the breakfast entrees! Hallelujah! I was really happy with my experience here.

1. I love getting a free biscuit with every meal. Yes. Love it.
2. The fried okra is AMAZING! I'm not a big okra fan but I totally loved what they did here. Of course, I asked for ranch (how else would you eat fried veggies?)
3. I got the Asheville Veggie Melt, fantastic. It was filling and the aioli sauce that they use on the sandwich was wonderful.

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I typically come here for brunch and really thought that was the only thing they did.  I stopped by for dinner the other night and was pleasantly surprised.  The dinner was just as good as brunch!  And the cocktails were amazing :)"}
{"text":"I was so excited when I found out they were opening a restaurant in Charlotte! I've always loved going to Tupelo Honey when I was in Asheville & having those biscuits & blueberry jam in my backyard made my day! Visiting for the first time, I was so happy to see the warm yellow walls that were so familiar at their other restaurants...the decor is so welcoming & comfy cozy...I love it! And the food...wow the food. The biscuits & jam (I know I already mentioned those but they are worth mentioning twice), the fried okra, pimento cheese, shrimp & grits...those are a few of my favorites. And, if you're in the mood for breakfast, you will definitely find something you like. The service is wonderful as well. Tupelo Honey is great for a date night, family & friends dinner and even a business dinner...I've been there for all of those occasions & had a great dining experience each & every time."}
{"text":"Great first time experience at Tupelo! Our server Jonathan as many have mentioned was AWESOME! Everyone enjoyed their food choices in our group. I had the sockeye salmon grit cake. I liked it overall. The portion was more than I was expecting but Im not complaining. I also had the Moonshine Mary(Bloody Mary) at Jonathan's recommendation because I wanted spicy. It was like a snack in a drink with bacon, pickled okra, lemon and an olive for garnish. I could have one of these everyday.  The atmosphere was chill too. Families, couples, young and old. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I really hate this place. First off their seating policy sucks. You have to have your whole party there before they seat you? Ridiculous. I also think their  service is terrible and the food is very underwhelming. I have been here for breakfast and lunch and nothing has impressed me. I don't get what all the hype is about. I have been to the Asheville one and that is much better. I also think this place is way overpriced."}
{"text":"Food is ok, service is ok, wait is usually long. Place is a little overrated to me and the vegetarian options are limited. Price for food and drinks is just too high for the quality"}
{"text":"I was in town for work and one of my friends recommended it. The weather was perfect to sit outside. I went around 2:00 so they were not crowded at all. I ordered the shrimp and grits without the chorizo. The shrimp were plump and big. Tasted great however the grits tasted funny. Maybe it was the goat cheese. I'm not a big fan. All in a the cafe is very nice. I really enjoyed sitting outside."}
{"text":"I don't recommend the fried green tomatoes over goat cheese grits. Really not my favorite. Honestly I've been pretty underwhelmed with the food here. Ambience is fine, food is fine, but I expected much more."}
{"text":"2nd visit.... service was off a bit today, but slammed for Easter....understood.... food was amazing.... had avocado toast points, sweet potato, fried chicken pancakes with hot honey...soooo good, salads looked great, wife's Southwestern omelet with Chorizo was good, as was my sons chicken avocado sandwich."}
{"text":"I've been to the Greenville, SC location as well and both locations have been an amazing experience. The service was great, the food was amazing, and the atmosphere was very relaxing. 

I ordered the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer and omg these were fantastic. They weren't overly fried (I can be sensitive to fried foods) and the grits were a perfect pairing for the tomatoes. 
My entree was the pulled pork grilled cheese. My only complaint was the bread was so soaked in oil and that did upset my stomach almost immediately and made it hard to finish, luckily I ordered a side salad so I was able to make a good balance between fresh and greasy. I wouldn't say this is a major down side to the point that I'll reduce my rating, because most people are ok with this, but I just wanted to give a fair warning!"}
{"text":"The brunch at the Charlotte Tupelo Honey is great! However, it gets EXTREMELY crowded! I am not a huge fan of the menu change because they took up the Debutante Omelet, but it is still really good. The honey is delicious and definitely order a Mega Mosa!"}
{"text":"Recent changes have knocked Tupelo Honey off our favorites list unfortunately.   The prices are not justified at all. $9 for a basic margarita which came in a rocks glass full of ice.  The average price for a brunch entree was around $17 which is crazy for a casual restaurant with fairly small portions.   $55 before tip for 2 drinks and 2 entrees is excessive, especially considering we had to eat in the bar area at one of those uncomfortable high bar tables.  The new chef thinks very highly of himself, clearly. The \"potato cracklings\" listed on the menu are just home fries. 

Very disappointed, to say the least."}
{"text":"The food is a little over priced for the amount of food you get. However the food is delicious! The grit squares and bbq egg rolls are amazing. If you enjoy small plates this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Great food, not so great service. That is how all of my peers and I feel about you, Tupelo. I brought my parents and in laws here the morning after our wedding. The place was empty and our food took a painful amount of time to arrive, and I see similar stories on yelp and I've heard similar around town. The QC is finally upping its brunch game and Tupelo needs to catch up. 

That being said, there is amazing food on the menu. Sweet potato pancakes or the Mac and cheese might change your life. I love getting a bunch of appetizers to try and drinks in the evening."}
{"text":"Busy, busy, busy. This place is forever packed. Come early. Food is good though. Their Tupelo beer isn't bad, to boot!"}
{"text":"1st time there...had the breakfast pie! Very tasty, the grits were amazing. The server was very friend and luckily we didn't have to wait!  I would definitely go back and recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I wish zero stars was an option. I called Tupelo Honey to see if they did bottomless mimosas, the hostess on the phone assured me they did, and continued to confirm my 21st birthday reservation. I was very excited to be a guest, as I have always drove past Tupelo Honey & heard many good things about it.
I arrived, and told my server, Matt, that I was starving. He quickly suggested we get the crispy brussels sprouts because they come out quickly. We agreed, and Matt left and returned with the brussels maybe less than a minute later. The brussels were overcooked, unseasoned and cold. How can something be overcooked AND cold? Theres no way they were made to order. My server brought me old, cold Brussels. And for a place describing itself as \"new southern flavors\", the cold ranch dressing that came with them on the side was metiocre at best. I was famished so I ate them anyway.

It was a rocky start to say the least. Matt soon after brought us a bowl of biscuits with jam on the side, told me he didn't want me to starve. I love when my servers take the initiative like that, totally made up for the so-so brussels. 

Later, we ordered our entrees. My friend ordered a chicken Cobb salad, and I let Matt order for me. I always do that when I go to new restaurants-it allows me to see what real flavors/originality the kitchen is capable of, as well as allows me to have a culinary connection with my server. It also gives my server the opportunity to make my bill higher. Matt told us that the new menu was a week old, so I was excited to try something new! He asked me if there were any dietary restrictions he should be aware of, and I told him I don't eat pork-so no bacon or ham. He did not write our order down.

Food comes out, my friend's salad was like 80% lettuce. Very little toppings. Matt tells me that he ordered me a \"Biscuits. Gravy. Chicken.\" ....So, he brought me a bowl that consisted of the biscuits that I had just finished eating, and was garnished with bacon bits. After I specifically told him I don't eat pork. And to top it all off, it was freezing cold. 
It was my 21st birthday for crying out loud. 

I told Matt about it, sent it back, and asked for a menu. \"I'll just order for myself\", I said. Matt came back and said he can remake the bowl. No Matt. I don't want a remake of the cold bowl with biscuits I had just eaten. I'll pass. So I started looking over the menu and Matt came back and said \"Avocado toast might be good.\" 
What poor salesmanship. I don't want something \"that might be good.\" But I was tired of looking over the menu, so I agreed to his suggestion. 
Matt never, NEVER, apologized for giving me a pork covered bowl to begin with.

My friend's chicken on her Cobb salad got cold while we were waiting for my remake to come out. Never did he offer to replace her food. My plate finally comes out, my eggs were cooked to perfection, an awesome medium cooked egg. The avocado toast was just that-some bread with avocado on top. No originality, no twist on southern flavors. Bland. In the middle was an undressed salad with ONE carrot slice and two watermelon radish slices on top. All I could think was what a pathetic attempt this was at a breakfast plate. So not worth it-I could make that at home. 

I was no longer interested in communicating my dissatisfaction with Matt. He didn't care, clearly. I was waiting for a manager to perform a table touch at my table, which never happened. I thought it was standard for a manager to come by when food gets sent back...but not at Tupelo Honey, apparently. My friend and I looked around and understood why this experience was happening. There were servers not wearing non slip shoes, a server walking around (indoors) with a pair of yellow sunglasses, servers with their hair down, fooling around, playing, etc...It was in such disarray. Such disorganization. There is clearly noone setting the example at Tupelo, no real leader in charge. It's a dumping ground where half-ass employees come and put in minimal effort.

I never told Matt what our reason was for visiting, I assumed the hostess would've communicated that to him, and that a birthday cake or something would come out at the end of my meal. It should be a huge priority for hostesses too communicate special occassions to servers. But alas, no cake. No well wishes. Not even an inquiry of why we were visiting. Every department in Tupelo failed me.

I will forever be ashamed that I wasted some of my 21st birthDAY at a place as pathetic as Tupelo Honey.
The hostesses didn't communicate our occasion.
The server didn't write our order down, thus brought incorrect food. Did not apologize. Was not personable.
Kitchen served me cold, bland food. Twice.
Never did we see a manager on the floor.

0/10, will forever advise people to go somewhere OTHER than Tupelo Honey."}
{"text":"I went here this weekend with my parents and there was a 10 minute wait to eat outside. About 20 minutes later the hostess tried to seat us inside. It was another five minutes before we were seated outside. 

The waitress came over and took our order. It took 10 minutes just to get our biscuits. My mother got the trout, my father got the vegetable and I got the nutty chicken. The chicken was a little bland and my mother said the trout was seasoned well but over cooked. 

Overall, everything was okay but the wait for service was very long. We wouldn't have minded the wait but they said it would only be 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Tupelo Honey is a true Southern staple and should definitely be visited by people visiting the area. Their biscuits are sooo good and the place has a dreamy atmosphere. Tupelo Honey is loved by many for their food - but their cocktails are really what sets this place apart for me. From their old fashioneds to their frozen rose - you can't really go wrong when having drinks here! In terms of the menu, I love their grilled cheese and tomato soup the most. It's comfort food with an upscale spin. I would recommend Tupelo Honey to others."}
{"text":"Service and food was wonderful!  We did have to wait a long time for our food, but that was due to graduation parties. Hey kept us updated and were great at providing service while we waited. Biscuits are incredible. I loved my eggs benny but the best part of all was the potato cracklings!  My bunny had the eggs and sausage. He really enjoyed it as well!"}
{"text":"From Asheville and just moved to Charlotte last year. 

This location is on point. 

From the time we walked in the door we were given killer service. 

Brittany, was an awesome server.

She gave solid suggestions and made the already badass main dining room feel comfortable, like I had been here before. 

Would definitely suggest to anyone looking for a delicious meal, completed with quality southern hospitality."}
{"text":"Other than not getting a server for 15 mins, I really enjoyed Tupelo Honey!! After we didn't get a server, we opted to move to the bar where we got AWESOME service!

I had the egg/bacon/home fries combo. This was a great choice, as the bacon had a taste I've never had before. It had a great smoked taste mixed with maple/sweetness! Yummo!!

I can't wait to go back here for brunch next week:)"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to eat in Charlotte! All of the food I've tasted thus far has been amazing. Especially their shrimp + grits! They are the best I've tasted in Charlotte! I love their pecan crusted goat cheese app (ask for extra crostini's!). Their sweet potato pancake taste as good as it looks! You won't be dissappointed - unless you're one of those people who always find something to complain about which in that case - cook your own food. :)"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious. Everything is house made from appetizers to sauces to desserts. I sat at the bar top and ordered their Tupelo Honey Rye beer, and it was a wonderful ale- flavorful without being overpowering. I did not order any entrees, but I wanted to try some particularly southern sounding snacks- I was not disappointed. The bartender recommended the crispy Brussels with housemade ranch (best ranch I've ever had), and I got some baked Mac and cheese and some pimento dip with chips. Oh, and their complimentary biscuit? Sweet and savory all at once with a delicious jam. Great service, ambiance, and (most importantly) food. I can see why folks love this place."}
{"text":"We came here for my husbands birthday, I loved it. I got the grilled chicken and avocado, it was delicious. The fries were really good too. I tried fried green tomatoes for the first time, and I hated it haha, but my husband loved them. For dessert we got the banana pudding, and it was gone almost instantly. Our waitress was lovely, and the manager stayed on top of the customer service. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"We had SUCH a great experience here this afternoon! Alicia was THE BEST server! She's hilarious! --- Almost as great as the food! Ha! The food was outstanding. The Queen Bloody Mary disappeared from my glass too quickly. ;-)"}
{"text":"Such good southern food!!!! Good atmosphere, very good service. Indoor or outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is on a second story porch. 
Extensive menu making it difficult to pick just one thing! We ordered Fried green tomatoes (over grits) for an appetizer; delicious. For my entree I ordered shoo mercy pancakes. I recommend them over everything else on that menu, and I haven't even tried anything else, except the macaroni n cheese, (which was good) and hush puppies (also good; they have a hint of lemon in them). What this is, is sweet potato pancakes, with slices of bacon, a piece of crispy fried chicken, candied pecans, and a pat of butter, all on top. (A cup of syrup comes on the plate too) On the side it comes with eggs cooked your way, & some kind of baked apple. I ordered scrambled eggs with havarti cheese. It was great! As for my drink I ordered rosemary peach lemonade. Try it if you can. 
All of their food is sourced locally as possible, so the menu is subject to change as our waiter said."}
{"text":"I had a really bad experience during a recent visit to Tupelo Honey.  We had a group of 6, with no reservation, so I knew there would be a wait.  The hostess said it would be 35-40 minutes.  No big deal.  We grabbed a drink and a seat outside to wait it out.  After about 45 minutes, we went to check on the table and the hostess said it would be another 35-40 minutes.  What?! How do you misjudge the timing by half??

Since we had already invested that much time in it, we decided to wait it out.  After about 45 more minutes, we were finally sitting down at our table.  Then the wait only continued.  Our server was not very friendly and not in any hurry.  We ordered an appetizer of chips and pimento cheese.  It took about 15 minutes to finally get that appetizer.  That's right, 15 minutes to melt some cheese and put it on a plate with chips and get it to our table.  Ridiculous.

Luckily it didn't take that long to get the food, but unfortunately a couple of the plates had the wrong sides, which had to be corrected.  

If it wasn't for the fact that the food was actually pretty good and those darn biscuits are good enough to eat a dozen, Tupelo wouldn't have even gotten 3 stars.  I'm going to try it out again and hope for a little better experience.  If that doesn't happen, I probably won't go back...except to maybe pick up a few biscuits on carry out."}
{"text":"This place so tasty. I went here for brunch on a Sunday and while the wait for a table was about 30 minutes, we found a table in the bar section after just 10 minutes.

I ordered the Tupelo Shrimp and Grits which met my every expectation. There was a deliciously smokey spicy oily sauce on top of the grits that the shrimp and peppers had been pan fried in. I added the spicy chorizo for $3 which just took it to the next level. 

Absolutely drool worthy and I'll be remembering it for ages."}
{"text":"This is one of the best places in the Charlotte area to eat! Everything is homemade and cooked to perfection. The ambience is phenomenal, a place to see and be seen. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is worth the wait. They had really great biscuits. I also got the Southern Shakshuka that was pretty delicious."}
{"text":"We loved Jonathan! Great service, great experience! Can't wait to come back and enjoy a great meal with great friends and a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"It was okay but I didn't think it was as great as Toast or Another Broken Egg.  Seemed like they were a little too impressed with themselves and not very relaxing."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. Creative menu options. A very good Sunday brunch spot but the wait is at least an hour. So you're better off setting a reservation a few days in advance. 

The biscuits are .

The staff is pretty efficient and friendly too."}
{"text":"I'm sorry this place is not all that. I am a foodie and
Just did not think anything was great. Biscuits were hard and dry, fried chicken- I can make better.
It's a chain and it shows and taste like it. 
Not cheap at all for the quality of food. 
Left disappointed.
Let me note: management contacted me immediately and offered GC but I declined due to not wanting to share personal information. 
They also shared they will be using their shortfalls in coaching employees."}
{"text":"If this reviews was all about the food, it would be 5 stars. For me, food does not encompass my entire experience. I was dining by myself and the restaurant was fairly crowded. I decided to sit in the bar area which I ended up waiting 10 minutes before anyone came to see if I needed anything. The bartender, who was very nice, came over and took my beer order and gave me a menu. It was another 10-15 before he came back to get my food order. As I waited another 30 minutes for my food the bartender came by and look amazed that I hadn't received my food yet and sent someone to check on it. My food came out 5 minutes after that. Someone who I presume to be a manager or possibly an owner came by, apologized and offered me a free dessert. Everyone was sincerely apologetic but my criticism is with staffing on the bar side. Having the bartenders wait tables on a Saturday night seems to be a little misguided."}
{"text":"Good menu and good ambience. They serve everyone a biscuit with jam and honey when you first get there- I love that!

I got their sweet potato pancakes with fried chicken on top- this is a dish for two people! I ate all the chicken and the baked apple was good with the bacon, but I could only eat one of the pancakes. Everything was good, the chicken was juicy and crispy, and the bacon was not too greasy. The baked apple added a nice tartness and lightness to the whole dish. One thing I appreciated- they actually made my eggs over medium!!! This is a rarity and I commend the chef for making my eggs a perfect medium, thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Who would've ever thought to put goat cheese in grits (So yummy) or dessert for breakfast??? Tupelo Honey, that's who!!! Those banana pudding pancakes are too gorgeous to eat.!!!! And taste as great as they look. I felt i could eat all I wanted because I had to climb so many stairs to get there... Loved every bite!!! #JustMelApproved"}
{"text":"Well, I must say this place was perfect for someone looking for some local Southern type of food with an organic and green feel. 

The shrimp and grits did not disappoint.  I love the goat cheese notes with the red peppers and shrimp.  It was perfect and I wish I had something left to take home.  I have to find out how to get more restaurants in LA to serve grits and polenta. IJS. 

The biscuits and warm honey was a great start. Fried green tomatoes come on a bed of grits.  They were a tad salty for my taste but I am wondering if I am really a fan of the appetizer since I haven't found the FGT of my dreams or if I am holding on to my fondness of the movie (Towanda!).  I am a fan of both the pickled and fried okra. Again, may be looking in LA for a jar of pickled okra sometime soon.  Smh. 

The service was great and the ambiance was very upbeat and friendly. Matthew was kind, knowledgeable, patient and attentive."}
{"text":"So good. The food is so fresh and they serve good portions. Great customer service. Decent prices. Love their drinks. Nice decor and love the location. My brother and sister were with me and they both loved it too. The server was so helpful and gave us great recommendations. Will def be back. We went for Sunday brunch. It was kind of busy but they were very attentive."}
{"text":"Being from the south I expected so much from this restaurant! I ordered the wicked chicken sandwich and fries. The chicken sandwich was extremely dry with a weird flavored coleslaw. I only ate two bites! Service was horrible as well. The waiter was in such a rush and extremely rude. NEVER AGAIN. I don't see what the hype is about. The complimentary biscuits were the only thing that was decent. UGH $20 Wasted!"}
{"text":"Ok 
I ate by myself bcuz I could t wait any longer for my friends to go. 
I got here and the host sat me alone at a 4 top !
I love that sooo much and a great start to my amazing meal. 
I order fried green tomatoes on goat cheese grits.
It should be copies and mandatory for everyone to eat this dish ! 
Then Sam the waitress  brought a warm biscuit ( no butter needed ) and fresh blueberry spread out of this world.
Dinner was fried chicken with Home fried potatoes and collared greens with thick meat bacon in it.
I literally had to stop eating bcuz it was so good. 
Then as I finished dinner at 6 pm the church bells started playing HOW GREAT THOU ART & it was horrible but wonderful to sit outside on the balcony and hear it.
The service was a 10 and the food was super hot and no surprises ( like truffle oil) on the food. 
The cost reasonable .......considering the whole local feel.
I will be back !"}
{"text":"Went to Tupelo on a Friday night. I made a reservation for 7pm, but when we got there it didn't look like it was necessary as there were quite a few tables. I appreciated the option nonetheless. Parking there is kind of iffy - I wish we had gotten an Uber or something. Other than that we had a wonderful experience! Our server Kevin was lovely and explained every question we had. The carolina dip was really yummy! Wish we would have known that you get biscuits while you wait because we ended up not being able to finish the main course. The only bad thing was that they were out of pretty much every pork product there. Kevin explained that sometimes they run out because of the cooking process (which made it sound even more delicious!!!). We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is overpriced.  

Ask many questions because they omit very important points about menu items.  I ordered the ceviche app which does not specify it is actually a 'chip and dip' type app.  wth?  Our very nice waiter explained 'oh that is just their take on ceviche!'  If I wanted a crappy martini glass full of unidentifiable goo with three lousy shrimp in it served alongside a side of chips FOR TEN DOLLARS I would have gone to some fast food joint AND SAVED 8 DOLLARS.

But the entrees were passable if not memorable.  I can't give it a low rating just because I did not ask what their 'take' on a dish was.  Will not be back.  

Waste of time and money."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, because all my friends had been and they seemed to like it. I give this place name the \"fake southern food\". 

We arrived at 5, parking is to say the least difficult.  At 5pm we were told it was an hour wait. So I spotted two seats at the bar and snagged them. I asked the bartender if we could eat there and she told us yes.  I ordered the tupelo honey draft, which was great.  Since I was sitting at the bar you would think the service would be great... Not so. She couldn't be bothered with us when I asked what was the best thing on the menu.. She simply said it's all good..(I don't think she's even eaten the food here) we ordered the okra to start. The okra came out pretty fast. I love fried okra, however this was wormy tasting mushy and not at all crisp on the inside. Fail. Won't try it again. Since it was so bland I was hesitant to order dinner and we thought about going some place else. It was filling up in the place the bar barely had standing room, and people were pushing and shoving. Some man came over and asked me if the seat next to me was taken and I said no he proceeded to shove another seat in next to me. If you've been there the bar area itself is small, an extra seat doesn't fit well.  Then the man asked to try my okra! Sure since I was done with it now.. And still waiting to order. Weird.   

We got veggie plate and tomato soup and grill cheese. When it finally came, it looked ok. The grill cheese is just grilled cheese on big toast. Bland at best. The tomato soup was barely warm, no worries though because the five people tending bar couldn't be bothered to even ask. The veggie plate with Mac and cheeses, beets, and some kind of roasted collard greens was absolutely nasty. The beets were not cooked. Think raw beet dipped in some kind of vinegar sweet juice.. The collards were terrible not even cooked. And I didn't bother tasting the Mac and cheese.  My husband said it was ok. But if your in this area of town looking for southern food I suggest skip this over rated place and head to midnight dinner or macs speed shop. Unless of course you just want beer and crowds. 

On one other note the guys next to us asked for a couple shots the bartender lady said well this isn't really a bar bar, if you want that you need find just a bar.. Indicating she had no clue how to mix this shot they wanted which was just pickle juice and Irish whiskey.. Seriously not hard and all she had to do was google it which they did for her. 

I'm not going to bother going back here. The service was sub par, the food was worse. Try it if you want to wait 1 hr or more at any time of day and want just say you've been to the new hip trendy place in town. Cheers."}
{"text":"Mmmmm... Home style cooking at its best. The menu is large. Some items I don't \"love\" but all items are pretty damn good. Tupelo Honey's food flourishes with ideas of what it would be like to have your parents or grandparents cook for big families at home. Well. Assuming they cooked southern food. 

Some of my favorite items are the grilled okra with ranch, fried green tomatoes, open faced honey fried chicken sandwich, anything fried chicken related, their gravy, and their Rosemary peach iced tea!

Still plenty more to try at the restaurant. I've had the steak and eggs, but found the steak to be too seasoned/marinated for my taste. (I liked a simply seasoned steak) But it was good and my boyfriend loves it. 

Definitely one of our go to restaurants with great service. It's loud inside and coooold. But we love sitting in their outside area and listening to the rain."}
{"text":"Great southern food with a new twist! Service is ok, it was better in Ashville."}
{"text":"The customer service we received here was phenomenal. They were very accommodating to our allergy needs and spoiled us rotten. A special shout out to Anna Olivas for her awesome customer service and recommendations. Next time we will try brunch! Appetizers and biscuits were our favorites. Honey and blueberry compote a.maze.ing"}
{"text":"If you love honey...good place for you 

So no matter what you order, they will bring you biscuits with their blueberry jam & their Tupelo HONEY. Which is warm and perfect by the way. 

They have good apps, but you don't really need one. If you eat a biscuit and some app and an entree - you won't be able to finish it. Or if you do your a hero Bc that's a lot of food. If you do want to try an app I suggest the *fried green tomatoes*, served on goat cheese grits. I know Grits don't sound good but trust me these are. 

They have daily drink specials and appetizer specials every day for their \"happy hour\" 4-6. Apps served like $4.50 each or so, basically just have the size of the normal app. 

Yummy breakfast & dinner."}
{"text":"The food and service was and is the best Charlotte has to offer.   The restaurant's atmosphere was amazing, location was perfect for us.  Thank you!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has over 600 reviews, so I'll keep it short. 

There is a reason this place is always packed. The food is good the staff is friendly. I haven't had a bad meal here. I'm not a biscuit person, but their biscuits are delicious, especially with honey. Go for lunch, dinner, or brunch... it's consistently good. Go early or be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Our first time here and loved it!! Had the fried chicken plate and the pork, they were delicious! Definitely would get again and would recommend. And the service was great, ask for Kevin!! Exceptional service and super cool guy!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot however I was disappointed they weren't allowed go have dogs on their patio."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant for breakfast and brunch. We went for a Saturday brunch and was greeted by very warm host an excellent staff. Our waiter was very friendly and offered wonderful recommendations off of the menu which helped us choose the most delicious brunch. This looks like a very cute place for brunch with a great drink selection unfortunately I did not get a drink but did enjoy the food! We ordered the beet salad - which was delicious and was dressed perfectly. We also ordered the shoo mercy sweet potato pancakes which were to die for . The hot honey is a must!"}
{"text":"Consistently good, but miss their chicken piccata. Biscuits are yummy. Service is fine. Bar area has windy fans that make girlfriends and moms cold. Choose seats wisely."}
{"text":"The food is okay. A bit overpriced for breakfast. The biscuits are good."}
{"text":"If I had to make a choice of a possible favorite restaurant, this would be it. You want a spin on fresh southern cooking with a twist, well here you go. From the grits to the burgers, you will not be disappointed! And as for the drinks, YUM! I'm not even a drinker and I love sampling my friend's drinks. It's like my dessert. And the dessert! OH MY GOSH. Pecan pie! Please do! All these great comments on the food and let me not forget their superior service! Tupelo Honey is the place to eat!"}
{"text":"I had an awesome time at the Moonrise Brunch last night! There was a great group of people there. 

I enjoyed the Ahab Lament, which is a spiced rum drink with pineapple and bitters. Two was all I needed. The Bar Tenders were fast, friendly and offered a strong pour.

The food was tapas style. My favorites were:

* Bacon Biscuit Slider with Orange Jalapeno Marmalade and Cream Cheese Boom! 
* Chorizo, Egg and Pimento Cheese Taco 
* Pain Perdu with Blueberry Compote

I added the 'Boom!' up there for effect. Their spicy tacos hit the spot too. Chef was very active, out on the floor. He made a couple of dishes off the menu which makes the experience all the more enjoyable. 

Did I mention the people? Lots of fun people there hanging out. We piled in a long tall table in the middle of the room and sat on bar stools. I stood half the time too.

The Moonrise Brunch has three critical elements that make for a great night: tasty food with variety, strong drinks with lightning fast service and a great group of people that want to hang out and have fun! 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Was pretty darn good.  Service was great.   Jane was great.  Mountain trout very tasty.  Grits I like.  Meatloaf was different.  Sausage in there.  I'm more home style on meatloaf but it was good.  Going to try the fried chicken next.  The okra was really good it could have used more salt.  I'm a salt fan.  Look forward to eating outside in warmer weather.  Decor was very nice."}
{"text":"Great service. Awesome biscuits with fresh jam. 

I enjoyed the fried chicken with biscuits and gravy. The servers were attentive and personable."}
{"text":"This place has great vegetarian options! My vegetarian coworkers were blown away and thankful to have found such a place in the South. 

I on the other hand was not convinced that this was Southern fare. I had some dry ribs, weirdly sweet breaded catfish with a weird sear and some bland tasting sweet tea chicken. Not impressed, but after realizing that this is a chain restaurant, I became convinced that although their marketing was on point, this place kind of seemed like Red Robin of fancy Southern food. 

The service was great (she split the bills between our large group and was very kind about it!)  and food came out quite promptly."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch over Christmas time with my Mom after mani/pedis. We stayed here for hours. They were serving a Pumpkin Spice Moscow Mule at the time...so delicious. (My Mom took a picture of the recipe so that we could try to recreate.) PERFECT spot for brunch or lunches. I had a egg breakfast bowl dish that was so flavorful, but still felt healthy. For Mom, an incredible grilled cheese, which I wish I had ordered myself! 

They have gluten free options and a diverse southern comfort food menu!"}
{"text":"There's one thing you can bring to Brunch at Tupelo Honey Cafe, and that's your appetite.  There are pretty much two items you can find in any of their brunch items:  Grits or Eggs.  As long as you like one of these two ingredients, you'll be happy.

The menu of brunch items isn't huge, but the selection is great.  I had the Jalapeño Fried Egg BLT.  The jalapeño aioli set this sandwich apart from from a regular BLT.  Delicious and not spicy, but flavorful.  The Southern Breakfast Bowl was definitely not what I pictured.  It kind of looked like a bowl of beans, grits and eggs.  It looked interesting, but I think I'll try another one of their southern-inspired items on the menu next time.

But there was one delicious treat that I didn't expect.  Step aside, Red Lobster cheddar biscuit...make room for Tupelo Honey Cafe biscuit and jam!  Flavorful and yummy.  This in itself was a reason to go to this place.

Overall, the coffee was good, the breakfast was tasty, and the service was friendly.  This is a perfect, sit-down place to get brunch with a friend or your family.  I'll definitely be back for that biscuit."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Perfect Charlotte brunch spot!Food 5 stars!
Service 5 stars!
Ambiance 5 stars!
Loved the biscuits and the jalapeño BLT!
Good Mac and Cheese and cheesy potatoes too."}
{"text":"It was a good place to meet a friend and have lunch. I can't speak for much on the menu since I haven't had it but it seems people really enjoy it and like the food. 
They do have some cute, good and interesting drink combinations. That's definitely a nice twist."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I visited Tupleo Honey Cafe on a Friday night. No reservation needed, we had a short 5 minute wait. Our waitress was very friendly and really helped us with our questions about the menu. I ordered the fried chicken BLT with a side of goat cheese grits. Those were the cheesiest grits I have EVER had, very delicious! The Fried Chicken BLT was very moist but lacked a little flavor for me. The bacon had way too much fat on it, I had to remove from my sandwich. My boyfriend had the chicken wings appetizer, and for a appetizer those were some pretty big wings! The sauce on the wings had a little spicy kick but still sweet. The chicken seemed to be double breaded which gave that extra crunch we like. We also ordered a side of the homemade Mac n cheese, this was not as cheesy as I would have liked. I can say there was nothing special about the Mac n cheese. The homemade biscuits they give you are so buttery and warm, and awesome with the blueberry jam! We will try this place again for breakfast."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch and the food and service was great!  The breakfast bowl was my favorite thing we tried. The goat cheese grits were really good, so we will definitely be back to try the shrimp and grits!"}
{"text":"We love taking our visitors to Tupelo Honey.  The atmosphere is fun and festive. The food is yummy, a twist on the southern flavour. Our Server, William made our day with his positive and uplifting attitude. Thanks William!!!!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I did our Engagement Brunch here on October 1st 2016. We had a small party with immediate family with 17. Alicia and Jameson were our servers and they were absolutely perfect! They were upbeat, considerate, and were on top of everything from the time we sat down to the moment we were out the door. The conversations with them were so enjoyable and they genuinely wanted us to have a good experience. I can't speak highly enough of them, or of the Guest relations manager! She was also more than I could have asked for. 
This review gets 5 stars because of the 3 of them and the amazing kitchen staff who got our food out super quick. 
See- this could have EASILY been a 1 star review. I made my reservations well over a month in advance for 10:45 am. I put 11am on the invitations, because I've worked in the service industry and I was expecting a small delay. 
We arrived at 10:20, or 7 of us did, and went ahead and let them know we were there.
Over an hour later, at 11:25am, 40 minutes after my reso time, after 3 conversations with management, my party, who included a 14 year old with physical disabilities, was finally seated. Oh, and the conversation with the male general manager on staff was appalling. Essentially, they kept telling us the issue was that a couple at 1 of our 4 tables closed out and continued to sit... and sit.. and sit.
I don't know about anywhere else, but the 3 restaurants I've worked at that accepted reservations always had ways around these issues, such as setting the expectations when the tables are sat that a reso is set for a later time, or, not seating that section at least an hour prior, if not longer. If you can't make large reservations work, don't take them. However, all the GM wanted to do, was whine to me about how he had to offer the couple a free brunch on their next visit to get them to finally leave- in my opinion, he could have handled that couple and myself much better. His attitude was something that could potentially prevent my fiancé and I from returning, and we truly loved our brunches there (this why we chose it for such an important event).
All in all, once the guest relations manager and servers came in, all was well. We were on a time crunch after being sat so late, so our food came very quickly and appetizers were sent out free of charge as soon as we sat. Without them, our engagement Brunch, and first family gathering would have been a disaster."}
{"text":"It was decent good. The cooks burned out pancakes but the managers/supervisors made it right. I appreciate that and for that I give 4 stars. Not much to complain about here, server was nice too."}
{"text":"Not our first time, but maybe our last.  Went for breakfast and nothing really worked out.  Hostess was snooty in the way she asked if we had a reservation (note it was 815 in the morning on a Sunday and the restaurant was about empty) and the food just wasn't that great.  Nothing special and certainly not worth the $100 price take for 4 entrees. For example the pecan pie French toast was $14 and it was literally three slices of bread layered with a smushed piece of pie...very underwhelming. The burrata fried green sandwich was poorly assembled, only half having the spicy spread.  Also the kids menu only offered pancakes by way of traditional breakfast fare."}
{"text":"Another excellent meal at Tupelo! Kale, Quinoa and Shrimp was awesome. Love the Lavender and Lime fizz drink. Our server William was attentive and a very nice gentlemen. Thank you for a great lunch William"}
{"text":"Amazing biscuits, goat cheese grits, fried green tomatoes, and unique drinks.  The outdoor area is nice for enjoying a sunny day while you wait for a table.  The long waits to get are for good reason!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. We eat here often for brunch. The breakfast food, particular the chicken and pancakes, are amazing. The lunch food is amazing as well. The fried chicken is delicious but not overly greasy. The ambience is really cool as well. It's an awesome restaurant and I'm so glad we have one in the city."}
{"text":"Visiting from NYC and my host wouldn't stop talking about this place. Day 2 of vaca we came here for lunch. 30 min wait Friday at noon is good sign, however it only took 10 maybe 15 minutes to get a table!

Everything here is locally sourced when possible, even the togo-boxes were cage free!

Coffee was incredible and got better with each sip. The blackened blistered okra was a great rendition of such a simple veg and the portion was HUGE. 

We shared the shrimp and grits as another app because we are sickos. I don't know how you feel about grits but this beautiful symphony of corn, butter, prawns, roasted peppers, creole spice, basil and goat cheese will have you ready to slap your gramma and say \"\"Shoot y'all I'm movin to Charlotte!\" 

We had no choice but to get the pancake & fried chicken combo. Sounds simple, right? WRONG! I need to meet the madman (or woman) who came up with this creation! Toasted pecans, whipped peach butter and bacon topped this masterpiece of the biggest fluffiest pancake this side of the Mississippi and some of the best boneless fried chicken you can find north of Virginia. Everything was cooked skillfully and the pancake was not shy on the nutmeg. 

All-in-all this was an amazing brunch and the food was only outdone by the service.

Jonathan's passion was something restaurants can't buy or force into their employees. As a man who has spent over 15 years in the industry, I can tell you he was genuinely happy here and believed in this establishment. This speaks volumes about Tupelo and I feel good supporting such a place.

You can bet if I come back to Charlotte my first stop will be Tupelo for those grits and the warm embrace of Jonathan's Southern hospitality."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Great food presentation. Great atmosphere. The item that I had tried was not worth the price. Overall a pretty good restaurant."}
{"text":"First time here!  Outstanding service from our waiter Jonathon.  He made our time there second to none!  Not only did he thoughtfully go over the menu, but he also had a great sense of humor about it!!  
The food was great and we are looking forward to our next visit!!"}
{"text":"Oh my heavens!!! My boyfriend and I just ate here for the very first time and we were BLOWN A-W-A-Y! He had the fried chicken and biscuits....talk about a flavor explosion in your mouth. I want to get it again so we can drizzle some of that honey we missed sitting on the table.  I thoroughly enjoyed the super breakfast scramble. What fun textures and flavors. I could never have pictured a more perfect combination of fresh pico, stone ground goat cheese grits, black eyed peas, peppered bacon and a fried egg on top. Our server William is a rockstar. He made our experience even that more enjoyable. He was full of suggestions and a great sense of humor. ;) We have both grown up in Charlotte and this is by far one of the best restaurants we have ever ate it. This is going to be one of my go-to's. With so many creative food options you are sure to never be bored. And how sweet to enjoy this delicious weather on their cool patio. Love, love, love!!!"}
{"text":"Went for brunch on a Saturday. The location is fantastic and it really adds to the restaurant experience. I had the yellow tomato bloody mary, pretty solid, and the eggs benedict with a side of bacon and sliced tomatoes. Excellent experience all around and the food was delicious. I will definitely go back for dinner."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food at Tupelo Honey. I ordered the Shoo Mercy sweet potato pancakes with fried chicken and bacon. The portion size is just enormous. Enough food to feed two people. The pancakes were delicious. The bacon was good but I thought it was slightly over cooked. I know that some people do like their bacon slightly burnt and super crispy. My girlfriend ordered the pork belly hash which was a bit disappointing as there was not much pork belly in it. I did enjoy the potatoes in the hash which was very tasty. I would like to visit again and try the other items on their menu."}
{"text":"Very laid back and southern style brunch spot. We had their delicious biscuits and a wonderful blueberry jam- yummy !
The biscuits and fried chicken was tasty- if you aren't used to gravy, order it on the side because it's a lot- this way you control the gravy. The grits are made with goat cheese and are very tasty. The best thing was their sweet potato pancake- delicious and very light- wonderful taste."}
{"text":"Well, in typical Jessica fashion, I'm gonna make this short, sweet and easy to read.

*4 top/8:45 reservations/not to busy for a Saturday night

1) server Emerson (19), very sweet but slow and not attentive. Young, so he didn't know liquors but that's ok. 
2) don't expect to get anything except a craft beer-no Coors or the like. 
3) Biscuits came in the middle/end and were not any better than Cracker Barrel
4)Goat Cheese was amazing-highly recommend 
5)I would not return-unless invited and this place was their desire. 
6) Fried Green tomatoes were great but needed dipping sauce-instead of the grits probably. 
7)Lastly, take a jacket, it's freezing in this place.

{"text":"Really great food, really great drink selection! Good place for the family or with friends to celebrate a special day!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Excellent food. Excellent service.  I had breakfast but the whole menu was available at 9 am on a Saturday.  I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu.  Everything looked so good. 
And I can't say enough about the service.  That's important."}
{"text":"I have gone here a couple of times for brunch, and each time I was underwhelmed.  For the price and lack of good flavor, there are definitely better places to go right around the corner.  My scrambled eggs were way oversalted which is always a red flag in my mind.

Mimosas are always good and staff is friendly.  I do also really like their biscuits and honey. 

I won't go back for brunch, but still would like to try lunch or dinner to see if it's any better."}
{"text":"Great food but most of all, great service. Jonathan was so attentions and had great recommendations. We had the friend chicken with the pancakes (forgot the name) BOMB. Also, I recommend the Bloody Mary with moonshine."}
{"text":"Delicious from the start. We arrived and was told it was an hour wait. We put our name on the list. We ended up only being 20 minutes. 
When we were sat at our table we were given waters and asked for other drink options. 
We ordered appetizers which consisted of the eggrolls, tomatoes, and okra. The egg rolls with barbecue is delicious, the tomatoes fried green, were delicious on top of the bed of cheesy grits, and the okra couldn't have been any crispier still with a yummy inside. 
I ordered the fried chicken BLT sandwich and added pimento cheese on top. It was to die for. Literally way too much food. I will definitely return. 

Everyone at the table was more than satisfied. Don't forget those free biscuits,served with blueberry jam and honey! 

It's a way to a southern girls heart"}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that this place had very breakfast good food.  I had the Shoo Mercy Omelet, and it was very good.  The biscuits that they bring out before the meal were fantastic too.  

Unfortunately, there were a few minor issues with the service that lower this rating a couple of stars.  After being seated and giving our order they apparently ran out of coffee and had to brew a new pot, so it took probably 10-15 minutes to get the drinks to the table.  Also, there was definitely a problem expediting our orders - we sat by the kitchen and saw the food come out, but it took probably 10 minutes to get it from eh kitchen window to the table... which means a lot of the food like the grits and chicken were luke-warm instead of hot.  


It could have just been that they were very busy as we went on a Sunday morning just before a football game, so I wouldn't let this service discourage you from going for a great breakfast."}
{"text":"The nutty fried chicken topped with gravy was delicious!  The fried green tomatoes with goat cheese grits were good too; the tomatoes were the perfect consistency.  (I wish they would offer a smaller portion as a $4 side option vs. the $8 appetizer portion).  There's a nice selection of Carolina draft beers and unique cocktails.  The indoor area is vibrant and cheerful.  The outdoor balcony seating is quieter, lovely and at the far end you can get a peak through the trees of the view of downtown Charlotte."}
{"text":"Absolutely AMAZING food!!!! The Mac and Cheese...the hot honey sauce...the blackberry habanero !!! Management was so great and so was the wait staff!! Manager: Chris and Waiter: Rogelio!!!!"}
{"text":"I hate to do it but it's true.  I've been here three times and each time there is a resounding feeling of lack luster service.  It ranges from not knowing what's on tap, what the specials are and no real desire to serve.  I'm no elitist but these are sorta important.

The food is the best part of the experience and even that has been flat lately.  I like the atmosphere in general as it is cozy and a nice place to unwind.

Parking is on street and sometimes a bit of a hardship to find a space."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place. The decor was nice. We were seated on the patio, which gave me a genteel Southern atmosphere. Parking is atrocious. Our server was new, so he wasn't able to answer my questions about the different menu items. Le sigh.  We finally ordered. I ordered the Shoo Mercy sweet potato pancakes. The presentation was nice but I took a bite and noticed a weird aftertaste. The pancakes were burnt as hell. The server was confused while trying to explain they were supposed to be black as coal. Umm, nope. My eating partner had the same kind of pancakes and hers were a normal color. I ordered the fried tomatoes instead. Again presentation was nice but these were some bland, tasteless fries green tomatoes. So, to say the least, I won't be back."}
{"text":"First time at Tupelo Honey and everything we heard is true. Great food, ambiance and staff, particularly Jonathan our server. We will be back, and would recommend to everyone as a 'must try'."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast and brunch spot that is easily accessed by the light rail trail. Recommend either calling ahead for a reservation or be OK with hanging out by the bar while you wait. Biscuits and gravy are top notch, but really can't say I've had a bad item on their menu. 
2¢- they make a surprisingly good sangria"}
{"text":"i continue to be surprised about how good the food is here. every dish i have ordered has been delicious and unique. and the biscuits......divine!"}
{"text":"Tupelo Honey has excellent food and service every time I have been there. The original THC is in Asheville Nc and they brought one to Charlotte. Everything is made from scratch and they start you with biscuits and honey with blueberry jam which are delicious!  All the mains I have tried were great and the service was good!"}
{"text":"You know something's going right when the lunchtime wait for a table is 45 to 60 minutes!  Luckily, THC proves to be worth the wait and then some.

Now in fairness, I and my party of 5 stopped in for New Year's Day lunch at 1 PM.  It was packed but the hostess stand had things firmly under control and the adjacent bar space is the ideal place to get settled in and enjoy a local craft beer or cocktail.  Given the special day, I gave the drink list a gander and asked if there was any cocktail that didn't fall on the sweeter side of things.  Our bar server was refreshingly honest and admitted all their drinks were a bit sweet, but he directed me to the 'Paris of there South,' due to the complexity of flavors and the rye whiskey base.  Sweet?  Yes, but it was a very pleasing blend of bitters, elderflower and ginger beer.  I could have had a half dozen.  I should also note the 'Mega-Mosa\" here, which is a Mimosa that includes nearly a full pint of champagne.  Definitely not for just sipping and perfect for an extended brunch.  This bar alone will do well in this city.

We did advance our timeline by scoring a table in the bar area, which is all first-come first-serve seating.  My only complaint was the wait to get service started, but the two servers in this area seemed stretched out to the max and it wasn't for a lack of interest on their part.  In fact, our server acknowledged the wait and more than made up for it once he got to us, with a quick wit and spot-on service throughout.  He was as entertaining and quite professional, an ideal mix.

The menu largely breaks down into sandwiches, entrees, and breakfasts, with a big focus on Southern cooking and large portions.  There is no 'lite' menu here and it's all but impossible to order anything small.  Given the huge fluffy biscuits that come with any order, this will be a BIG meal, no way around it, so loosen up your belt and settle in.

I had a country breakfast plate and there eggs were cooked perfectly to order and came with a very large portion of country ham.  Home fries are thin sliced potatoes and, while good, were very oily and lacked a bit of crispness that would have made them pop a bit more.  All of our sides, even a very tasty swiss chard and asparagus, were pooling with oil upon arrival at the table.  All quite tasty, but really only adding to the heaviness of the meal.  My wife had the 'sassy garlic chicken' and it was rather tasty, especially with a nice peach-burbon glaze on top.  Again, portion sizes were large and it would not be impossible to share a single entree if you're not looking to blow it all out at a single sitting.

Omelettes and the sweet-potator pancake (even the kid's portion) are massive and will more than fill even a hearty appetite.  All are also highly recommended alternatives.  THC knows how to serve you some food and keep the taste factor high.  You will likely leave, however, feeling that there is no need to eat again for the day.  Definitely not a place to put on the regular rotation if you have any concern for the waistline, but a welcome addition to the city dining scene when the occasion calls for hearty fare with a recognizable Southern twist.  Good character, fine drinks, and they will make sure you leave quite full... this place is as sweet as their name."}
{"text":"Not as good as the Asheville location because it's not in Ashville but rather on South Blvd in Charlotte.  But still a good place to have brunch or an unique dinner."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places. I'm not sure what happened! The biscuits used to be so light and now they were doughy. The jam is still amazing. I order the same thing every time since this place is a hike for me to get to. I like the blackened catfish. The fish itself is still good, although the potion size has decreased. The green beans came out cold. The Mac and cheese is really good. The big disappointment was the banana pudding. It took 15 minutes to get to the table even though the restaurant was almost empty and I thought maybe they were putting it together. Nope. The cookie on top was not crisp but was soggy as it the whole thing had been sitting in a refrigerator for hours. And the pudding itself used to have banana chunks in it. This was dense and has lost its charm. I only took 3 bites when I decided it wasn't worth the calories."}
{"text":"The food was delicious!!! The service was great! And the drinks were amazing !!
Make sure you make a reservation on busy days. 
They had the best buttermilk biscuits"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Fresh biscuits and honey are wonderful! The salmon, mashed sweet potatoes and kale salad is my fav dish. Never had anything here I didn't like!"}
{"text":"I went with a party of 3 for breakfast and the staff was really friendly and food was good. 

The waiter seemed very knowledgeable on the menu. 

What made me give the restaurant a 3 is because their recipes have to be followed verbatim and they don't do a lot of substituting or change to how you want something cooked.  One of the people I was with ordered from the small plate wanting the little breakfast sandwich but had sunny side eggs and wanted it cooked well done, but was told that could not happened.

I ordered the steak and eggs which was delish and the other person ordered the sweet potato pancakes. The food for breakfast was kind of pricey. If your gonna pay the amount I think things should be made how u want them."}
{"text":"The giant Bloody Mary was amazing! Unfortunately the rest of the meal was not. I ordered the huevos rancheros and they came out cold. The meal was also 90% black eyed peas and you couldn't cut the tortillas. Would not order that again."}
{"text":"Blueberry flavored drink, not too sweet, perfect! Biscuits, yummy, especially with the honey and jam!  Pimento and havarte toasted cheese sandwich, great!  Tomato soup, hit the spot!!!  If you are looking for a health food restaurant, go elsewhere.  If you want the occasional treat, this is your joint. Staff could not have been nicer or more attentive. Atmosphere is welcoming. Thank you Austin and Alli for a great time!"}
{"text":"So amazing!  And our server Jonathon was great! Had the chicken and pancake but the biscuits and blueberry jam was divine!"}
{"text":"Overall the food was decent.  I however was extremely disappointed in their supposedly signature Bloody Mary.  I've been to the one in Asheville and charlottes needs to take lessons from their bar tender.  Also, while the biscuits were good Charlotte has done something to the Biscuits. Not as good.  I will definitely go back to Asheville and maybe Charlotte"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday afternoon it was very busy so glad I made a reservation. The biscuits they give with every table were sour so you need the honey. You could see the kitchen as you ate and they were working very hard. The waitress was knowledgeable, but overwhelmed and stretched really thin. I got the classic chicken and waffles ( it's not what they call it) I was very hungry and liked the sweet potato pancakes. Those were the highlight of the meal. The grilled fruit was a pear. Three other people I was with got this dish it came highly recommended.I really like the decor to be in a southern restaurant where the fans were old school. They can hire more people. In addition if you order a salad expect iceberg Lettuce (fake and man made lettuce). I wouldn't expect that from a restaurant that wants to embrace made from scratch, fresh, and original."}
{"text":"Overpriced, loud and the food is honestly gross. We ordered, the trout and the shrimp with grits. Couldn't even eat it, not to mention that the place is so bright and loud it feels like a high school cafeteria. Worst dining experience I've had in a long time."}
{"text":"I go to Tupelo Honey occasionally for lunch.  They have farm to table offerings that are delicious but a little pricey to do everyday.  I have to stick to the salads but my husband gets the fried chicken blt which looks freaking amazing!  Great service and well worth the trip in."}
{"text":"I just don't get the hype or the long brunch wait time.  Why is everybody clamoring to eat here?  I have a lifelong love affair with brunch and to top it with outdoor patio dining is dropping a cherry on my brunch sundae.  But both times that I've been to Tupelo have left me wishing that I had that egg McMuffin, breakfast burrito and Krispy Kreme glazed donut (my on the fly, tried-and-true backup weekend sweet and savory breakfast) instead.  Tupelo gets 2.5 stars but I'm rounding down because I'm literally stunned by the 4-star rating for: (1) fabulous ambience (4.5 stars); (2) long wait time (2 stars); (3) better than average service (3.5 stars); and (4) REALLY heavy, greasy, bland food (2 stars).

_____Fabulous ambience.  Tupelo feels like how I would imagine it would be to visit a Southern aunt or grandmother who baked pies, fried everything that you could imagine, and when she wasn't baking, she was making quilts; it's rustic and meant to feel welcoming and cozy.  The patio is enclosed and tucked away behind some mature trees to facilitate your immersion into its Southern charm.  

_____Dreadful wait time.  You can't book a reservation on Open Table until 12:30 and let's be honest, by then that's not brunch, that's just plain old lunch.  It is noteworthy to mention that they can't serve alcohol until noon, on the dot.  To their credit, the wait does move along pretty quickly and they overestimate the wait time so that you're pleasantly surprised when your name gets called ahead of schedule.

_____Better than average service.  Our server was upbeat, super friendly and attentive.  However, his recommendations weren't very good (see below); when we asked for extra mustard (our chicken BLT was very bland), it didn't come until AFTER our meal was almost over; and when we told him that the best thing we had on the menu was our pineapple tiki drink, as he cleared away our nearly full plates after we declined to go boxes, he didn't give the 5-star Yelp spiel that we overheard him giving to all the other patrons (in fact, he didn't mention Yelp at all) and didn't really do anything or offer any conciliatory gesture or at least communicate our discontent to a manager.

______REALLY heavy, greasy, bland food.  Tupelo is southern cooking with an unexpected twist but its delivery leaves you wanting more flavor, less charring.  I've been twice and both times I was wishing I had that egg McMuffin or Krispy Kreme donut instead.  I've had:

GOOD:
++++++pineapple tiki drink: It's $23 and meant for 2 and pretty heavy on the alcohol.  It's delicious and refreshing but wish they would have given me the pineapple that was cored out to enjoy.
++++++Bloody Mary: the vodka pour is pretty heavy handed; this is a hearty drink and very flavorful.
++++++complimentary biscuits:  the biscuits are served warm with raspberry jam and honey.  They're sweet and fluffy, especially with the jam and honey but I wouldn't say they are better than Red Lobster's biscuits.
MEH:
--------fried chicken BLT.  The chicken was dry yet greasy and bland but overall, the dish was edible.
--------beet salad.  The sweet, tangy dressing, cheese and candied nuts are a nice touch to the salad.
--------signature salad.  Wish there were more apples because the greens are a little bitter; the sweet vinaigrette goes nicely with the tartness of the apples.  The croutons are made of corn bread so they're a little sweet. 
--------Eggs Betty.  The hollandaise sauce was pretty bland but is better after salt is added.
--------shrimp and grits. Tried this because it's a signature southern dish but it was underwhelming and bland.  The shrimp was chewy and rubbery; the sauce was spicy but otherwise not very flavorful.
AVOID:
--------Appalachian shrimp: the shrimps are supposed to be infused in sweet, semi spicy chili sauce dressed on corn soufflé.  Everything tasted charred and the corn soufflé was just soggy corn bread.
--------okra.  The okra was charred and very greasy.  The buttermilk dipping sauce isn't as salty and flavorful as Ranch dressing, which would have tasted better.
--------Brussel sprouts.  Charred, super dry, bland and very greasy.
--------mac and cheese.  Dry and not cheesy at all.  

Overall, every time I have been here, I am remorseful for the money I spend eating here (which is usually around $65 for 2 people, before 20% gratuity) because I could have my egg McMuffin and Krispy Kreme for less than $10.  I don't mind shelling out that amount if the experience is better than McDonald's and Krispy Kreme, but sadly, it is not."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. We haven't been in over a year and will deff not be going back the food is way over priced for what you get and not to mention the 3 hairs on my plate. What was supposed to be a great Father's Day brunch we all left disappointed"}
{"text":"Made reservations for 1 PM for 6.  Tables were available, but we were not seated until 1:30, but only because we asked why we did not have a table.  We were told the kitchen was backed up.  We said can't we order drinks while we wait, so they sat us.

Next came ordering the drinks.  They brought me the wrong drink so I returned it.  Waitress said she would have the correct one brought to me.  The drink never arrived by the time the food was brought out (which was AMPLE time to replace).  I told the waitress to remove the drink from my ticket as I no longer wanted the drink.

Next came the ridiculous wait for entrees.  When we arrived, there was a wait for tables as the restaurant was full.  In less than 45 minutes from time we arrived, the place went from full to about 60% full, yet took the kitchen about 45 minutes to  get our 6 meals prepared only to have two of them cold.  We returned one and said remove the item from the ticket because we were not going to wait forever again for a replacement.  The person with the other cold entree decided to eat his because he was too hungry and didn't want to wait any longer.  Also, waitress brought 2 bottles of ketchup and admitted both were almost empty.  We used up both quickly and asked for another one.  Waitress did not bring another one to us.  Waitress then did not remove the entree returned from the correct ticket and we had to wait for two tickets to be fixed.  By the time we left, 2 hours had passed. 

Food portions were skimpy for the price. 

The place may have a nice atmosphere, but that is where the good part ends.  Was my first and last visit to this place."}
{"text":"Great food and great service !! Jamison was our server and he was he BEST!!! the Bloody Mary was so yummy!!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good here. I had the shrimp & grits which had a slight hot taste that gave it a really great blend. Had the bruschetta and that was great. Casual attire. Prices were in line with food quality. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Delicious - sweet tea brined roasted chicken, corn jalapeño slaw, mixed greens with white balsamic dressing, biscuits with jam and honey, and top it off with tupelo honey beer ... taking home banana pudding"}
{"text":"This place was a disappointment.  Maybe it sucked because we went during brunch, and it was extremely busy.  We ordered the mimosa to hold us over during our wait, and it really wasn't anything to jump up in arms about.  If you like pork, then you will probably love this place.  There didn't seem to be too many meat options, we didn't even eat here.  None of the selections seemed appeasing to us, so  we went to the Flying Biscuit Cafe, much better!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight with my lady. Got to be honest, Not good. The food was ok, the service was really, really bad. 
Had the charcuterie, not only was she not able to explain what was what, but said she'd find out what was what, and.... nothing!
Once we left our plates on the dirty, empty table next to us, she never brought my gf a new knife. We were never given excess napkins. So we had NONE. And at the price point I was set back when we asked for the remainder of our food to go, and she handed us boxes. 
 I mean we ordered a solid first round and I got the short rib for dinner, ( the most expensive dish on the menu) and I'm wrapping my own food. 
I guess, for fast casual it's pretty ok but, won't be heading back any time soon. 
Oh and I think that they should get rid of Rachel! 
She SUCKED!!!"}
{"text":"Try the Shrimp grits , a bit oily due to the added chorizo but it's great, a heavy dish"}
{"text":"Tupelo Honey was delicious! Even though we came on a Monday Brunch/Lunch, we made a reservation for 12:15 pm for the outside patio and THANK GOD we did, because there were so many people here at that time. Whether corporate lunches or personal, there were just so many people that wanted to sit outside.

We ordered with our stomachs and not our eyes and realized we were so so stuffed by the end of our appetizers. For appetizers: we ordered Crispy Brussels (without Bacon) and Fried Okra. Both were mouthwatering delicious. I also ordered a Rosemary Peach Lemonade which was tasty! 100% recommend!

For our entree, I did the Lunch Combo - 1/2 spicy avocado & egg sandwich, 1/2 mixed greens salad, and french fries. The spicy avocado & egg sandwich comes with a organic nut bread, but I'm allergic so I requested a different bread. They ran out of sourdough so I opted for Pumpernickel. Everything was super delicious, but I was so full from apps I ate everything inside my sandwich and left the bread. I couldn't even finish my fries (!!!). 

All in all, a beautiful & delicious lunch spot!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing!  I had the best server, her name was CC.  She was sweet, friendly, and have amazing service!  I've been to one of the Asheville locations, I'm so happy they opened a location in Charotte!"}
{"text":"I have the Tupelo Honey cookbook, so I was very excited to try out the restaurant when it opened in Charlotte. I finally made it out.

The decor is very Southern with lots of yellow and a the rustic frames and doors. 

While we waited we had wonderful free biscuits with honey and jam thy were fabulous. I ordered the garlic chicken which was very tasted and came with a side of Mac and cheese and veggies. The Mac and cheese wasn't the best I've had, but was perfectly fine. Friends got the BBQ plate, which was tasty but needed more sauce. The fried okra was delicious! Overall the food was good and I would return.

The only real downer was that our server was not very attentive and we had to wait quite sometime to get her attention. I think it may have been a bad server as many others seemed quite attentive."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from Louisiana so their \"Southern\" claim was at stake. They did not disappoint. The okra was fried crispy and the dipping sauce was a treat. I had the meatloaf, it was flavorful and moist. My friend had chicken picata and was pleased as well. The Mac & Cheese is a must try. I didn't have the Shrimp and Grits as that's a common dish at home. We ate on the balcony, the weather was wonderful. Our server was teriffic, suggesting and describing dishes. We will definitely be back. Oh, BISCUITS with, what else but, Tupelo Honey."}
{"text":"Service slow. Food was ok.   We have been to the one in Asheville and it was exceptional .... this one was mediocre.   I would not return."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The shrimp and grits, fried chicken and cocktails were awesome! The stuff is friendly and the atmosphere is great."}
{"text":"It's pretty Much impossible to have a bad meal at Tupelo Honey Cafe. I had the Shoo Mercy Omelette and It's was so loaded with fried green tomatoes, bacon and pimento cheese that I needed a knife the whole time. My wife had the country fried steak and loved it. Our server Dylan was on point as a server he was taking care of business so well we called him Dr. Octopus and he was cool with that"}
{"text":"Rolled up on a Tuesday night since I had to kill about 1.5 hours while waiting for someone to arrive at the airport.  Old Pewter Rose location (RIP).  Place was pretty busy and since I didn't have time to wait they offered us the counter right at the kitchen which was open.  Kind of like a Chef's table but they called it something different.

The experience was doubly awesome since we got to watch them prepare all of the yummy dishes.  We were right there facing the line cooks and chefs.  Both me and my co diner ordered the nutty fried chicken on the recommendation of the server.  It was served with sweet potato mash and asparagus.  The entire plate was quickly devoured and I must say it was very tasty.  Oh, and they started us off with one of the most wonderful, fluffy rolls that I have ever eaten.  Since I was right there I noticed a sign that said that the rolls, before being served had to be approved by a chef before going out.  Pretty cool, and maybe that contributes to the hot, doughy perfection that I ate.

All in all, it was a great experience at a renovated old favorite restaurant of mine.  I will definitely return so I can try other things on a menu that I really didn't have time to properly peruse but remember there was some pretty great stuff on it."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim! Sat on the patio with a gorgeous view and nice atmosphere. Our server William made great recommendations and made us feel very welcomed. I ordered the fried chicken blt and it was delicious. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. I love it every time. I haven't visited the Asheville location so I can't compare the two yet. But this location has always given me great service and great food."}
{"text":"Cold food, raw bacon, watery omelet (southern), chicken biscuits and gravy (bland).  I've given this place 4 tries...done now.  Will give them huge credit for biscuits, those are great."}
{"text":"Lovely southern brunch spot. They have a beautiful terrace during the summertime. And omgosh the biscuits it's are so die for, it will be difficult to stop eating! As others have said, there's always a wait so come prepared to grab some OJ and wait to be called. Authentic southern food so if you're in the mood for that, come here!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, we sat on the patio and had William as our server. He answered all our questions about the menu and made some awesome recommendations. We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I very much so wanted to like Tupelo. I had waited and waited to try it, due to the crazy wait times (and my boyfriend not being the waiting type)... until FINALLY we decided it was TIME. 

The wait actually wasn't bad 10 minutes or so for the two of us. I really like the setup and the interior of this restaurant. It's beautiful. Our sever recommended the huge mimosas to us, but neglected to tell us they wouldn't hit our table until 15 minutes after we had ordered them. That aside, she raved about the chicken blt and sold us both on it, so we ordered two one with all and cheese one with fries (mine minus the mustard). She also recommended it spicy for something different ( I love spicy so I let her sell me on that too). 

They bring out biscuits with jam and honey which we're phenomenal and filling while we waited for our drinks. 

When the mimosas finally appeared I was not impressed. They boast an extra 2oz of champagne but mine tasted like straight orange juice so it was definitely not worth the $10 price tag. 

Our food came out fairly quickly given how busy they were. The presentation looked nice. But they neglected to leave the mustard off of mine, and its flavor completely overshadowed any of the spiciness that was promised. The chicken itself was good. Not completely tender, slightly overcooked, but decent. Mac and cheese was flavorless, the fries were good, but there were only about 15 of them on my plate.

Our server didn't check back on us until our food was gone hence me never mentioning the mustard. She was pretty lifeless. 

I don't know, they definitely didn't live up to the hype. And with a $53 price tag for two... I left hungry and disappointed - the value and output are definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"We were seated faster than expected and had lovely service. The fried chicken and sweet potato pancakes were my favorite part of the meal. It was oozing with flavor. This order is good for two people and you get a little bit of everything! and my boyfriend and I split it making the perfect serving size! Squash toast was very tasty and savory, although one piece of toast for $13? Rough but something different from avo toast. Overall, great brunch spot"}
{"text":"I'm taking one star off only because it was crowded.  There, now I can get to everything wonderful about this place.  This might take a while.

Setting:  Pewter Rose was a gorgeous location.  And with the redesign, it was only made better.  Lots of natural light, great paint scheme, interesting decor.  Comfy seating.  It all works.  

Drink:  Love the focus on local and NC craft brewing.  My Birdsong Jalepeno Pale Ale was perfect.

Food:  Lordy, it is amazing.  Too much to choose from?  \"The menu is almost as big as Cheesecake Factory.\" observed my cohort.  There is a lot, but so much of it looks so good, that it's challenging to pick.  Here's what I went with - 
Appetizer - Appalachian Eggrolls.  BBQ in an eggroll.  This shouldn't work.  It seems like something from TGIFriday's.  But dang, take everything that's great about a regular eggroll, and combine that with everything great about good BBQ, and there you go.  Good portion size to share, without being too filling.
Main lunch course:  Shoo Grill Cheese.  Havarti and pimento cheese, with ham and maple bacon, and fried green tomatoes on nicely toasted oat bread.  There are no words.  Eating it makes you happy.  So, so very happy.
I would be remiss to not mention the complimentary biscuits.  They should be charging for these.  Another cohort, a biscuit afficiando, claimed they were in his top 3.

Price:  Within reason.  Not cheap and not shockingly expensive.

Amazing.  Wondrous.  Pleasant.  Delicious.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I'll start with saying, I love the one in Asheville and just recently moved to Charlotte - was thrilled to see this near my new place! While this one doesn't quite have the 'personality' of the one in downtown Asheville, the food and service was still great! I know some have said the wait is long and food comes out slow, but we didn't have those problems. It can be a bit loud inside, so keep that in mind if you are looking for a place to have an in depth conversation with your party. But great food and love those biscuits!"}
{"text":"I took my wife to Tupelo Honey for Mother's Day, and the whole family enjoyed one of the best meals we've had in a long time. From the delicious crabcake appetizer to the fabulous Shrimp & Grits and mouthwatering Buttermilk Fried Chicken, everything was perfect. The atmosphere is trendy, yet family-friendly, and the drink menu and beer selection as good as you'll find anywhere.

Oh, and the BISCUITS! Simply unbelievable.

We've never been able to get into the original Tupelo in Asheville, so this South End location is a much-appreciated addition to the Queen City's dining scene!"}
{"text":"We got lunch at Tupelo Honey when we visited Charlotte, North Carolina on our southern road trip in January 2017.  The restaurant was large, homey, and had a wonderful selection of items on the menu.  We were looking for southern fare, since we wanted to fit the theme of our southern road trip.  

We had the following:
-Biscuits & jam (this was complimentary and was so good - those biscuits were so fluffy and melt-in-your-mouth good!)
-Pulled Pork Sandwich
-Mac n Cheese (side)
-Southern Fried chicken (with gravy) 
-Hush Puppies (with a dipping sauce)
-Fried green tomatoes

Everything was absolutely delicious!  It was the first meal of our southern road trip and we were very impressed.  I would definitely return again if I visited Charlotte in the future, and I was happy to dine at the Tupelo Honey location in Arlington, VA a few months after this experience!"}
{"text":"When I wake up super hungry, I need something that's going to hit the spot. I usually head to Tupelo Honey for comfort food, comfy environment, and friendly staff. There's a reason it's always packed and reservation is always recommended--but don't worry, if you forget to make one, they'll try to accommodate you.

Tupelo Honey is basically my favorite casual brunch spot in Charlotte right now. It's the perfect place for jeans and sweater, and a long list of my favorite Southern brunch options: Southern Shakshuka, Avocado Toast & Eggs,  Shrimp & Grits, Caramelized Squash & Burrata Toast, Shoo Mercy Omelet, Fried Okra and more. 

Southern Taste
Souther hospitality.
It's a win all around.

{"text":"Blah best sums this up. I hear Ashville location is much better.service was good. Food was blah. Atmosphere was cold and missing something. Prices a bit high for the quality."}
{"text":"Horrible service!  Went for brunch on Saturday of Memorial Day Weekend. Three women at hostess desk and took 15 minutes to be spoken too because some man WITHOUT reservations was asking something.  We had reservations. Eventually seated at table without chairs.   Sat for 15 minutes without seeing a server.  Finally got server and ordered drinks.  Took 25 minutes and she brought wrong drinks.  45 minutes later we still didn't have our drinks or the free biscuits they are famous for.  We were about to just leave but were too weak from lack of food and drink.  Eventually the beverage manager came over and started dealing with us and everyone else in our section and she was awesome but hard to save a terrible experience.  Will never go back ---  we went next door to continue drinking .  We are lushes and they lost a lot of money on us."}
{"text":"I love this place for a weekend brunch stop. The biscuits are amazing and I'm always looking forward to them. They have great breakfast options, especially for the people needing accommodations. They had veggie sausage for those vegetarians, and at the time that's exactly what I was! So eggs, crackling potatoes, veggies sausage, all delicious. I would love to go again as a vegan and see what my options could be, but I assure you here they will make it work, great service!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best food and service I can find In South end.  From the hostess to the server it's fantastic. It's a must if your are in CLT, southern charm at its finest."}
{"text":"We heard about Tupelo honey from friends of ours that were religious patrons of their Asheville location.  At their insistence, we had dinner there one night a few weeks after they opened.  The only way I can describe Tupelo is this: have you ever eaten at a restaurant where the menu SOUNDS better than the food actually TASTES? That's basically it in a nutshell. I wasn't overly impressed (or really impressed at all) by anything that our table ordered. Just poor execution.  Hopefully they work out whatever kinks are keeping this from being a great foodie destination!"}
{"text":"Arrived for Saturday brunch/lunch and was told wait would be about 20 minutes.  We were seated about 15 minutes later next to the entrance to the bathrooms - which is not a problem except about a dozen tables were empty thru out the restaurant - was the problem they had too few servers or the can the kitchen not keep up with the size of the place - who knows?  Server was Jonathon who was outgoing and engaging and earned a superior tip.  Biscuits were great and quite filling and maybe we shouldn't have order the fried okra (which were home made style and very good).  Omelet for my daughter and Charleston Chik sandwich for me were good.  Wife had the breakfast bowl which had very over done eggs which were corrected and Jonathon made sure the manager came over and she even delivered the corrected meal!  Good job Jonathon in making sure management is engaged with customer complaints for future fixes.  All in all, the food was good and the 4th star was earned by Jonathon's extra effort which we appreciate as good servers work much hard than most folks think."}
{"text":"Fantastic 'small plates' dinner here as we pass through Charlotte NC.  The fried green tomatoes and goat cheese grits poppers were absolutely delicious.  But the NC country ham wontons were off the charts amazing.  On top of great food we slid in during happy hour and enjoyed Moonshine Mint martinis for $4 each.  Thank you Jesse & Mikey for the BEST southern biscuits with blueberry jam ever!!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was on point!! You can tell everything was fresh. Staff was very nice, specially considering how busy they are on a Saturday morning! Would go again!!!"}
{"text":"I was impressed by the simple yet tasteful food. I would recommend this for anyone who likes scratch made everything and just good flavors. I've only been once but def will return."}
{"text":"I tend to be hesitant about chain restaurants, but Tupelo Honey is fantastic every single place/time I've been to one and Charlotte was no exception! 4 friends and I were visiting the area and wanted delicious food! The complimentary biscuits and jam were the perfect start to a delicious meal. Several of us had the pork grilled cheese, others had the chicken blt. Just thinking about them is making me hungry! Definitely go for the Mac n cheese side! If you are not a spicy lover, put the spicy honey on the side (one friend made the mistake of ordering it on her food and was not as happy as if she'd left it off!). 

This location was very cold. During warmer months, I'm sure it's absolutely perfect bit with the temperature dip, definitely wear warmer clothes."}
{"text":"I know, I'm a food snob, so I'll let the raving reviewers revel in their average palates, which this area breeds.
The place was uncomfortably warm, and while it was 90+ outside, it is no excuse for a business and especially with the price to food ratio. 
The staff were friendly and the waiter compensated for his average waiting skills by being friendly. At least when asked, he eventually filled the glasses, coffee and served the table. Frankly, don't quit your day job, or try to learn your craft.
The biscuits were ok, a bit small and over seasoned. The honey was nothing to talk about, although the side blueberry jelly seemed homemade or was a reasonable facsimile. It was a nice touch to provide 1 per person free in lieu of bread.
The execution of the entrees were rather pedestrian and over priced. The table ordered the chicken and biscuits topped with an egg and ham pieces. The egg was cooked as ordered and the Chicken piece ( yes, it was almost a finger, but slightly bigger) was ok. The Ham pieces could have been freeze dried and overall, it wasn't worth the price. The other dish was the hanger steak and eggs which was originally served cold and had to be returned. After re-presentation by a manager ( no compensation offered for the inconvenience... Yes, table parties eating alone) the steak was paltry, less than 2 oz but cooked as ordered. Eggs made as ordered and potatoes served as crackles, another code word for fried. 
Overall, not a place to go out of the way for and certainly overpriced for serving size. I won't be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This was a pretty interesting place! I live in Charleston and Charlotte isn't very far so we went for a day of shopping and for some food. We looked up Tupelo Honey before we left and decided we'd try dinner there. Heads up! Make a reservation. We made a reservation ahead of time using OpenTable and there was only a 5-6 minute wait versus a couple who walked in after and was told 40-45 minutes. Now that that's out of the way, get started. They start you off with housemade biscuits accompanied by honey and blueberry jam. They were really good. Crunchy tops but the inside was soft and fluffy. For an appetizer we got the crispy brussel sprouts. Very delicious and seasoned well. Lived up to the name, crispy. Definitely crisp, not burnt. We were going to try their dip with the collard greens but the manager informed us that the entire batch of it was ruined and there was none available for the day. Smh

The egg rolls were good but normally if the filling is savory, I prefer a sweet sauce. There's was a mustardy looking Sauce but wasn't sweet. Dipped it in honey instead, way better!

I ordered the fried chicken with two sides. It was cool. Smaller cuts of chicken but seasoned well. The Mac and cheese was pretty decent and the collards could use some more salt. Other than that this place is very lively and the atmosphere is great. Had the rosemary peach lemonade. You can definitely taste the rosemary and combined with the peach was a very different but tasty flavor combination. Will definitely be back next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I adore Tupelo Honey. Every time someone visits me I take them to Tupelo for brunch. The cocktails are amazing and the food is no exception. I especially love that they sell their merchandise. I purchased the pecans and honey for my grandfather for Father's Day and he was a big fan!"}
{"text":"Went during the week was surprised to find out they have weekday brunch! Server was realllly awesome he did an amazing job. And the drinks were made well. They offer soysage which is cool since I'm vegetarian."}
{"text":"We eat breakfast here every Saturday, and we love it!  We always sit at the bar, and the servers there make us feel right at home.  The food is delicious, and the atmosphere is beautiful.  Get the goat cheese grits!"}
{"text":"Major let down Based on majority previous reviews and the pics representing the specialties, I really expected to be wowed with an early breakfast...NOT 
Starting with the so called \"best biscuit in town \" just thick and doughy with a slight crunch on outer layers. No buttery flavor or flakiness just boring dough. The blueberry jam was ok.
Hubby ordered the Shoo Mercy omelette. A put together mess... Fried green tomatoes, pickled jalapeño, ham, bacon, pimiento cheese. Yeah not so great, the collabo does not come together well at all but it looked pretty.
I had the Shoo Mercy Pancake. You know I should have had a clue when I tried the dough biscuit! Huge portion and I think that was the problem along with the not so good batter used. Huge cake not cooked long enough, had heavy (not fluffy again) consistency, and then a slight gingerbread/spice flavor not at all like the sweet potato description. Doing too much! FLUFFY Buttermilk pancake topped with the apple cider bacon, fried buttermilk chicken could have been darn near perfect but the moment was ruined with too much going on spice wise.
The fried green tomatoes appetizer was ok. Tomatoes had good crust coating but the goat cheese grits, blah. The tang was definitely there but more flavor is needed.
Sad to say it's a thumbs down for me"}
{"text":"Great modern southern cuisine! The food was delicious and the service was excellent! My husband and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"After a long road trip back home, I went to dinner at Tupelo Honey Cafe in Charlotte. It's a cute little place on South Boulevard. I shouldn't say \"little\" because its rather big. It has an adorable outdoor area to sit, a regular dining area and a bar area. I want to go there for breakfast one of these Sundays and sit outside.

We started with a jumbo crab cake over jalapeño aioli greens and baby tomatoes. The meal also came with a homemade buttermilk biscuit which was out of this world. It was buttery, flakey, and gradually melted in your mouth.

I ordered the tomato cider glazed atlantic salmon with a side of sweet potato fries and a salad. The salmon was reallllly good, but the sweet potato fries were cold.

We sat in the bar area and our waiter wasn't very friendly and the service was very slow."}
{"text":"Food is fantastic! But the parking is beyond awful! If  you can catch the rail or an Uber here, then do it. We were seated at a table right in front of the kitchen. So the space was quite chaotic.  And very noisy. I was with a friend for brunch so we managed. I would hate to have been here on a date or anything similar. Food pricing was consistent with my personal expectations.  Drinks were expensive - way over priced. The food was really good but based the over experience (parking/noise level/by the kitchen seating/overpriced drinks) I might not return to this location for awhile."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's southern cuisine with a creative twist. Their servers and staff are very friendly and the atmosphere is great! My husband won't stop raving about the trout he ate tonight. Their fried okra and biscuits are also amazing. Don't skimp on the blueberry jam they serve it with! Yum!"}
{"text":"Brunch waiting times can be a nightmare but we opted for immediate open seating near the bar (also has TVs to watch the games, holla).

The bar service was wonderful and the food was pretty good too. Large selection of cocktails :)

Moonswine Bloody Mary is a must if you are into Bloodies. Megamosa is also sure to turn your morning around. Cucumber drink is refreshing, not sweet at all.

Appetizers: Jalapeño Pork Egg Rolls...we LOVED these.

Also had the traditional Eggs Benedict, solid. Goat cheese grits were interesting...only like a two bite thing for me.

I'm sure I will find myself enjoying their boozy brunch cocktails again."}
{"text":"Came here for a yelp event several months ago and now I am going here for work dinners as well :).   Love the food!  It's delicious .  A little pricey but items you can't leave without are shrimp and grits and the best pecan pie I have ever had hands down.  Don't forget the biscuits and honey.  Boom!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Charlotte, my in laws are coming in town to visit next weekend, so my husband and I wanted to scout a few places out. Despite the rave reviews we were terribly disappointed with the service. In fact the WORST server we have ever encountered in a long time. 

10 minutes after seated the server finally came ask for drink orders. A moment later someone else came back with water, then another 5 minutes later she came and asked if we were ready to order, I promptly told her we were still waiting on the coffee. She then said\" oh so he didn't bring the coffee out? Alright guess I will get it now.\" WHAT? Red flag #1. 

Coffee came out and tasted like it had been sitting there for two days. Since our server once again disappeared, we told the bus boy who dropped off the food to please get her for us. So we told her coffee tasted bad only for her to come back and said that's what it's suppose to taste like, in a way like we were lying and she's doing me a favor to take it off the bill. It's as if I didn't drink coffee almost everyday for the past 15 years and I know what coffee should taste like and it's definitely not sour. Red flag #2.

Oh and the famous biscuits. Toward the end of the meal she asked if we wanted biscuits. Sure. Although isn't it suppose to be brought out at the beginning? Moment later she said biscuits are being made and if we still want them. Yes sure. After meal is finished she came back AGAIN and said no biscuits. Still baking. At this point we have no words.  Red flag #3. 

Hey on a side note, food was good. Big portions. We needed couple boxes for the leftovers. So instead of giving us proper size boxes she grabbed 6 little containers, said they are out of big boxes out in the balcony area (meaning she didn't want to waste her time to walk back inside). It just gets better. She dropped off the check, my husband pulled out the wallet getting ready to pay on the spot as we didn't want to wait another who know how long before she appears again. Then she had the guts to say \"yeah it's better you give me the card now, they are transitioning me inside so once I go back in it will be awhile\". JUST WOW. 

I'm a generous tipper and never go under 20%, my husband tipped $4 on $30 for this horrible experience. I would've tipped her nothing at all. 

We will never come back and that waitress needs to be fired."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying out this restaurant since I really love the one in Myrtle Beach. Unfortunately, it was a big disappointment.  They are all a little different. 

The service was confusing. We weren't exactly sure who our waiter or waitress was. The first girl that came to the table said she'd help us. Then another guy came out and said he would. It was like they were taking turns. 

The food really wasn't that great either. I had the Skirt Steak, Potato Cracklins, and Green Tomato Chow Chow. The steak wasn't cooked properly. It was way over done. The Potato Cracklings were a disappointment and so was the Green Tomato Chow Chow. 

My companion had ordered the Meatloaf. It was completely burned on the bottom... Actually it was black. 

The manager did deduct some money off of the bill which was nice. I appreciated that. 

Atmosphere is nice, but I doubt we will be back to this particular location."}
{"text":"I was ecstatic to hear my favorite Asheville place was opening in Charlotte but found that it's just nowhere near the quality of the Asheville location. On my first visit, none of the food was warm and the service was very slow. The biscuits were dry and the food was near flavorless. On my second visit, I ordered the fried chicken and received a fried patty of mush or fat - I'm not entirely sure (even the waiter was repulsed by it). The manager not only replaced my chicken, but brought me an entire meal to go - one that was much better."}
{"text":"What an amazing place!  I decided to drive 20min from the airport into downtown - hoping to find a place to unwind.  I couldn't have been so lucky....

Tupelo Honey deserves every star.  Kimberly, my server, was phenomenal.  Very attentive and never intrusive.  So polite and friendly.  After a small chat, she returned promptly with my drink, the manager (Chris), and an appetizer to welcome me to Charlotte....on the house!

They know how to treat customers and more importantly, how to treat people.  My absolute best wishes of success to the team at Tupelo Honey!!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing experience.  My husband, child and I came in for a late lunch this past Saturday.  Looking back we should have left we waited five minutes to be seated and were not really greeted. We requested a high chair  & when we were given a high chair it had visible food on the seat that we had to remove. Apparently the high chairs are not cleaned after usage. 
We were given biscuits doughy and nothing special. Blackberry jam had a nice taste. 
I order the black bean burger (paid extra for cheese), with a side of asparagus. 
The plate came with the burger and asparagus swimming in sesame oil. The asparagus was not edible due to the sesame oil. All you tasted was oil when you bit into the asparagus.  The black bean burger was ok the bun was toasted prior to being placed on my plate but the bottom became soggy quickly with he oil. The pimento cheese that I paid extra for didn't even cover the burger it was maybe a half a tablespoon of cheese.  

My husband had a burger he said based on his meal he wouldn't come back.  You would think you could get a burger right... Charging extra for cheese come on! 

Charlotte needs new & different restaurants but this is not it. This restaurant is very similar to the restaurant Toast but more expensive.  

Recommendation drive a little further down the street and eat at Luna's Living Kitchen organic, vegan, fresh for the same price!"}
{"text":"Jamison was an incredible server- he made our brunch the most phenomenal Sunday we've had in ages. He was so on top of everything with a friendly and warm personality!"}
{"text":"This is the best of all of their chain restaurants.  The bartenders are great.  Service can get slow and I have left due to being completely ignored for 20 minutes.  Good drinks and good black bean burger.  Sometimes food isn't consistent, but they are trying and revamped the menu a bit."}
{"text":"For the past couple of years, we have enjoyed dining here on several occasions. We have taken out of town guests here, who have raved about the food here. But I have to say our last visit was VERY DISAPPOINTING  

We started off with the Fried Green Tomatoes which were great. That was followed by their famous biscuits and homemade jam, also very good. 

I ordered the buttermilk  fried chicken with collard greens and black-eyed peas as my sides. They use a boneless chicken breast for that dish. The chicken arrived with the breading clumped in pieces falling off and one side had no breading at all. This is fried chicken 101. Chick fil a cooks a million of these every day and they don't come out like that.

The server said it's a chicken breast so....? As if to say, well that's normal. It was not.  I said, I am going to need another one because this was not satisfactory to me. I kept my sides while she sent the chicken back to the kitchen. The second piece was better, but we could have done a better job at home. In past experiences here the fried chicken has been really good, one of my favs but not this night. My greens were good, my black-eyed peas were undercooked, more like al dente. They were fixed in a nontraditional way, almost like baked beans with a sweeter taste.That's not necessarily a bad idea, they did have good flavor. But because they were not cooked properly, I could not eat them.  After complaining about the chicken, I didn't sent them back but I should have. 

My husband had the Carolina Mountain Trout with a cornbread stuffing. He stated the trout had a good flavor but he expected the skin to be seared and crispier and it seems that they just roasted the fish. So he removed the skin. His sides were Brussels Sprouts and Hominy and Mac & Cheese. The sprouts were roasted not sautéed, had a good flavor but a little salty. The Mac & Cheese was soupy.

TH takes limited reservations and since it was a Friday night, I decided to do so. I noticed on their website that they had a new chef from NYC, who is highly acclaimed. I wondered how much experience he had with Southern Cuisine. Obviously you can be from another region and cook Southern, but it would seem that you would need some type of experience in the cuisine (like Emril Laagasse worked in NOLA for years before getting his own restaurants there). The other concerning thing was that TH has really expanded to a lot of states, going as far as Denver. You always have to wonder when that happens, is growth happening too fast,  and are they sacrificing quality for expansion. They have made changes to the menu, added a drink menu and a prix fixe menu which are great ideas, but if the food is lacking, that will not matter.

We mentioned to our server that we thought TH were having an off night and overall the meal was not what we usually expect from them. She mentioned the new chef and the difficulty of the cooks to execute the changes on the menu. She seemed to suggest that they needed more training. Apparently others had complained as well. She stated the peas were meant to be al dente. I don't know any Southern home cook who would allow black eyed peas to be served undercooked, so that totally needs to change, IMO.

I don't know why the determination was made to make changes to the menu and bring in a new chef. TH was already doing Southern Cuisine with a flare. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. We will try them again for Lunch or Brunch. But if we have another bad experience, this restaurant will probably be taken off our list of favorites."}
{"text":"Maggie was our server and she was awesome. Very attentive to our needs. She treated us well. The food was great too. We enjoyed our time at your restaurant. This was my first visit and I will be back when I am in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I'm currently sitting in the restaurant as I write this. First of all, the food is amazing. I can't saying anything else because it has left me speechless. I had the sweet potato pancakes with fried chicken on top. The best breakfast meal i've ever had to say the least. Our server, Kimberly, is the nicest sweetest and most informative server i've had. She was amazing at describing the best food choices and was extremely straightforward (in a good way) to tell us which options were her favorite. She's so pleasant that she has sold me on coming back here. I will continue to ask for her for future meals."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The inside was nice. There's outdoor seating. Food was excellent! Service....wonderful and the drinks were good. Love coming here and I know I will be back!"}
{"text":"Where do I began? 

I casually was touring the city and was looking for great food. A friend, told me about Tupelo and the amazing breakfast. I thought...Why no check it out. I approach the establishment. EXCITED. The smell of pancakes and honey reeked the parking lot. Which excited me more. 

I was greeted by a cute host who sat us. What happened next was appalling. 

I ordered drinks and didn't receive it for 40mins. I asked the waitress about it who became defensive because she felt as if I was rushing the bartender. Now, I'm realizing it's a crime to inquire about your order here. 

When I'm a paying guest and I deserve to know what's taking so long. So, I can make a more informed decision. I could've believe what i was witnessing. 

That sparked poor service for the rest of the meal. I ordered the Shrimp and grits. The waitress would barely come check back with table. By the time my food arrives it was cold. I don't understand cold grits. 

Hardly refilled glasses for beverages. Needless to say, i lost my appetite. I couldn't even experience the great food I heard about because of a rotten apple and piss poor attitude. When will employees learn food/drinks will always be a people business. It's so important to be nice and courteous with people. Very disappointed to say the least."}
{"text":"They're blackberry jelly is my jam! Get it?! :) we love this place, never had anything bad here.. Apart from a waitress once but that's an abnormality."}
{"text":"Disappointed...NOT like the Asheville location.

I ate at the one in Asheville a few times and it was sooo delicious. I expected this one to be equally as good, and it was not even comparable.

I ordered the sweet tea chicken and green beans. I asked about the green beans texture and was told they were soft, not crispy at all. I also had the Brussel sprouts. The chicken came out with a nice flavor, but green beans were crisp and not soft at all. When I asked for a replacement of another veggie, the waiter brought me a plate and put it in front of me to ask for the green beans back. Kind of weird - most restaurants just bring out the other side. The Brussel sprouts had an overpowering mustard flavor to them. 

My friend's food was served lukewarm. 

Wait staff seemed very eager for us to leave although it was not very busy at the time. We didn't bother him too much or ask for much. 

All in all, overpriced for taste and value. There are much better alternatives."}
{"text":"Came here for a late Sunday lunch a few months ago and was impressed. I had heard many good things about this place and I was excited to try. The food was fresh and very creative. I was impressed with biscuits and blueberry jam as well. 

This place is great for brunch or a meet up. The ambiance is light and fun and the service was prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"For years, I have heard folks rave about Tupelo Honey in Asheville, NC.  Well what do you know, they decided to open up in Charlotte as well.  The praises were well deserved as Tupelo lived up to the hype.  I had the Steak Au Poivre (medium) with asparagus and smashed sweet potatoes, which was to die for.  The steak melted in your mouth.  The signature biscuit and blackberry jam was a delightful start.  Great job Tupelo, you now have a new fan!!!

Ambience - 4/5, nice and spacious with plenty of outside seating

Service - 5/5, very friendly staff

Food - 5/5, excellent, excellent, excellent

Price - $$, very reasonable"}
{"text":"Decided to treat my hubby to brunch on a Saturday morning, which would be our first time dining here.  We are lovers of this place for life! I was wise enough to make reservations and we had little to no wait time as there were plenty of patrons waiting to get seated.

I started out with a Megamosa (large mimosa) and they brought biscuits, fresh blueberry jam, and honey to the table. I couldn't help but to indulge while my hubby continuously battled back and forth over his brunch selections.  The jam was delicious as well as the honey atop of the biscuit. We both ordered the Shoo-Mercy Sweet Potato and I must say, it was one of THE best breakfast entreés we've had in quite awhile from any restaurant.  The sweet potato pancakes along with the fried chicken breast were soooo delish!!! It was a perfect combination. The baked apple as well as the eggs were nice accompaniments. It comes with bacon as well, but I had mine without the bacon.

I did kinda regret eating that biscuit as the Shoo-Mercy won the battle. My hubby ended up devouring his while I struggled to finish. I ended up boxing the rest to-go and it tasted the same when I ate it later that day. The service and quality of food were great and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Been here one time and it was really delicious!! This is a not so popular spot yet a hidden gem to check out!!"}
{"text":"Food wasn't as delectable as the menu depicts. I've heard lots of buzz about the brunch menu, so I decided to try dinner to test their other offerings. I may return but only for a date that I'm not paying for."}
{"text":"Great fresh, unique but satisfying food.  Nice atmosphere.  Refreshing cocktails.  Great for date night."}
{"text":"By far my best dining experience in recent memory, and that's ever - not just in Charlotte. Having known about the original in Asheville, I admittedly had high expectations. And WOW were they fulfilled! Above and beyond. Some of the staff is still new (they have experienced training staff on board for their opening weeks to smoothen the transition), but what a couple of them may lack in savvy waiter quickness and intuition, they make up for it with passion for the food and a genuine eagerness to please their customers. Truly a great experience every time I go - THC opened in early December and I've been 4 times!"}
{"text":"Pleasant unusual Menu items excellent service. Will return soon. Jonathan, our waiter, was on top of his game!!!"}
{"text":"Shrimp and grits was amazing. I ordered the frose which was so good! A little on the expensive side"}
{"text":"I love the tupelo honey chain and would come back for the biscuits alone. The Ashville location is my favorite, but this place is great as well. I've gotten the rainbow trout and it was great! It's awesome to see local food from around the area paired with local beer as well."}
{"text":"Just had the Shoo Grill Cheese with a Rosemary Peach Lemonade ! It was AMAZING!!!!! Will be back soon!!"}
{"text":"I have been putting off reviewing Tupelo for a while now because I have very mixed feelings towards it. My first experience here was awesome! I got the breakfast bowl I think it's called and it was delicious! It had so many different flavor a that blended so well together! I couldn't wait to go back and I did a few weeks later for brunch again and got the same thing! Again delicious. 

A few months later I moved closer to Tupelo and I was so excited! I went back a few more times and again, everything was delicious. The service was great and everyone was always nice. I decided that I liked the food and atmosphere so much that I was going to apply for a job, if only I knew what a headache this would be. 

I applied and got hired on the spot. I was told ode hear from the manager about orientation by a certain date, didn't hear so I had to call. So I showed up for orientation, it was typical what I expected. Then I had my first training shift all set up. I showed up and the restaurant was closed? I almost turned around and left until I saw someone I knew from orientation. She informed me that they closed to retrain everyone....okay. So I went up expecting to be on the floor training and what I got instead was a 5 hour orientation. Had I known about this, maybe I wouldn't have been so annoyed. No email, no phone call, nothing. The response when I asked- oh I thought you got an email. So I let it go, went through the 5 hour orientation that was paid-plus. Then again had to sign up for my first training on the floor. Apparently they had no openings? Which I don't get, I've worked in the restaurant business for a long time and usually you just match a trainee up with someone working. So again I was told they would contact me, I double checked they had my contact information, they did....but again I was not contacted. So at this point I went through 2 orientations and not being contacted 3 times after being hired. I didn't even bother at this point, I found another job that cared about its new employee it hired.

With all that said, my view of Tupelo has changed. I was less than pleased. It was so unorganized and unprofessional of a business and I could not believe it! Not to mention I did not get paid for my time that I gave up to be at orientation. I've been back once because my friend begged to go there but otherwise I will not be returning. I tasted a lot of the food during orientation and the several times I've been there and it's not that great, a lot is pretty typical and not very \"farm to table\" like it's said to be. And the last time I was there, the servers were all over the place and having private conversations right in front of our table, again unprofessional. 

Usually I hate giving bad reviews but I felt it necessary for what I experienced here."}
{"text":"Definitely a great place to eat.  I can't say that I wouldn't have given 5 stars if I hadn't seen the wait staff playing so much.  They were at the booths sitting and talking... Just didn't seem to me that they should be just hanging out in an area the customers can see them.  Other than that.. The food is Definitely Delicious!! out waitress was great and very attentive.  Side note the decor is on point!!! (I will definitely go back here time and time again)"}
{"text":"Brunch was great. Limited menu but we all liked what we got ( the southwest grits bowl was delicious). $3 mimosas were awesome. Coffee is great. The decor was nice and it's a huge space so they can accommodate a lot. Bonus for taking reservations for brunch! Only downside is The service was slow and food took over an hour to come out. However it was a wknd brunch so hopefully this is not the norm. I would return on another day to try again."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure if this would be much different from the Tupelo Honey in Asheville which I largely disdained in my years of living there, as a tourist spot.  I came here with a party of four for Sunday brunch.  We were seated outside on the patio which was super sunny for half the table.  There was also a rogue and seriously out of tune church bell situation within ear shot.  

Our food was just okay especially for the cost (which seemed very high even for Charlotte).  My meal of avocado toast didn't come with all the ingredients described on the menu and not only that, the avocado was almost brown and kind of mushy.  It also came with an egg which was cooked as described but too runny for my taste.  To their credit, the server took it back, no questions asked and they cooked the egg a little firmer for me.  And now I know, that even though \"sunny side up\" sounds really pretty, I'm really an \"over medium\" girl!

The server was helpful and pleasant when we saw her but our table was largely ignored, except by the sun and church bells."}
{"text":"New menu, new chef but not for the better. Tupelo took out some of the better options on the menu for brunch. It seems that they are trying to reduce costs which was noticeable when we each got our biscuits and one tiny side of jam to split between the five of us. No knives, ketchup, or honey on the table anymore, those need to be requested separately which was hard to do since the server was busy for Sunday brunch. I normally eat my whole plate and if I don't, I will box it up to eat later. This was not the case with the Gulf Coast Lump Crab Benedict with potatoes. There was hardly any crab, the yolks of the poached eggs were hard and overcooked, the hollandaise sauce lacked flavor, the biscuit was mushy, and the potatoes burnt. My plate was basically untouched. When the server asked if I wanted a box I said no with a disgusted face. She took my full plate away and didn't offer to comp it. She never came back to check to see if our food was okay or fill up on water. I am very disappointed with Tupelo as I think it's a cool atmosphere and the food was one time pretty good."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite places in Charlotte, North Carolina. Tupelo Honey Cafe is the right pick when looking for that old southern comfort food. The best way to get there is by Light Rail, if you can get on the Lynx and take it to the South End of Charlotte. It is right off of the stop! You wont be able to miss it because the smell of yummy food immediately hits you when you get off the train. I have now been their two times, one time for brunch and one time to dinner. a majority of the pictures are from their dinner. During every meal they give you homemade biscuits, Tupelo honey, and their homemade blueberry jam. The Ribs and the Corn Souffle are probably by far the best! The meat was so tinder that it just fell off the bone. The Corn Souffle melted in your mouth. They put their Mac and Cheese in a tiny skillet, I LOVE this because it keeps it warm while you eat. I also 100% suggest anything with their fried chicken. The chicken is so tinder and delicious. Be prepared to eat a lot... But I guarantee you won't leave unhappy!"}
{"text":"I visited Tupelo Honey this past Saturday for brunch around 1pm. There was about a 45 min wait due to the brunch rush so my boyfriend & I ordered mimosas while we waited, which were great. The outdoor seating area is super comfortable so the wait didn't feel long. We got outdoor seating which was really nice. I ordered the pecan pie french toast with one scrambled egg which was amazing! I love that it had plenty of flavor but was not too sweet. My boyfriend ordered the chicken & biscuits which was also very good. He had a passion fruit cocktail which I would definitely recommend! Overall, we had a great brunch."}
{"text":"So disappointed in our last visit here. My BF and I arrived and were seated at a great table this past Sunday morning about 9:00 am. He ordered the Mexican type omelet with chorizo and I ordered my standard sweet potato pancake with fried chicken. We were not impressed with the new menu at all, as an aside. When our food came out, my BF's omelet was barely warm on the outside and the inside was chilled salsa and chorizo. He told our server who took it away. They were going to just serve him another but we decided to split my entree instead. The petite blonde manager came over and apologized and we got lots of apologies but I was surprised and disappointed that the bill wasn't entirely comped due to a very poor and ruined dining experience. This is probably our 8th time dining here and we had a birthday celebration of 6 guests once. We will not return. The service is spotty, the food is inconsistent and management seems unconcerned with serious lapses without any effort to turn a bad experience into a positive one.  Mistakes and errors happen EVERYWHERE...these are OPPORTUNITIES to turn something bad into a positive experience. Tupelo Honey really needs some more training of managers on how to do this. When customers don't return and tell others of bad experiences, it is not a good thing for a business."}
{"text":"Fried green tomatoes - with grits - really good
Pork spring rolls - hmm not as great
Fried okra - nothing special but not bad 
Chicken wings - nothing special but not bad
Buttermilk chicken - tasty - pick 2 sides
Trout - good but little in the dry side
Shrimp and grits - good!! Real good!!
And a few cocktails - got the job done"}
{"text":"Amazing food and yummy cocktails! The portions are huge but good to take home. I was happy to hear about the sustainability of ingredients. The service was prompt and friendly. Jonathan was our waiter and he had amazing recommendations and even helped us navigate town. Would definitely recommend and return."}
{"text":"This place gets busy...just like its sister location in Asheville.  I stopped in for a late lunch (3pm on a Saturday afternoon) and there were about 20 people waiting.  So I checked out the bar.  2 seats available!  That's luck for you!

I love their craft beer selections, many of the locals represented as well as others from around the state and then some other craft beers as well.

For lunch I went with the shrimp tacos and a side of brussels sprouts.  The tacos were great.  Fried shrimp covered with pico and a spicy jalapeno mayo.   The sprouts were good as well and were spicy in their own way with lots of pepper.

The bartenders were good although it was a bit loud in there and one of the bartenders spoke softly so I could barely hear her.

The menu has quite a few selections I want to try so I will definitely be back and they serve breakfast anytime.  This is my kind of place!"}
{"text":"My sweet potato pancakes and fried chicken brunch here was very good, and I appreciated the free refills on ice tea.  However the pancake portion size was out of control.  I really wish our server would have mentioned that our sweet potato pancakes could have fed a family of 12.  We should have split an order (it was just me and my friend), and we would have still had leftovers for two more meals.  As it was, we ate multiple pancake meals that weekend and we still couldn't finish them between 3 people. So if you are trying to feed a bunch of people, this is probably the perfect place for you to go!"}
{"text":"Ordered the fried chicken sandwich, it was pretty good. But what made the experience even better was the biscuits they give you while yoi wait for the food, our server Sesey offered extra and I felt right at home hehe! The banana pudding was delicious, really sweet though couldn't finish."}
{"text":"Solid, solid, solid, solid, solid. I took my niece here for some grub and we left pleased. There's something to be said about a place that hits the mark with everything you order.

The biscuits were soft, delicious, and free. How do you beat that combo? The hushpuppies were just as they should. My shrimp & grits reminded me a bit of New Orleans. I'll admit I've had some in the Big Easy that were better, but these definitely held their own. My neice enjoyed her meal as well. This place may not knock your socks off but it should impress, at least a little."}
{"text":"William had great suggestions and we had our food in no time!!  It was delicious and can not wait to be back to try some wings!!  The fried chicken was on point!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts you can have in Charlotte.  Great food- excellent service- this place always has personable servers too."}
{"text":"First, the biscuits are TO DIE FOR! I indulge each time I visit Charlotte. The goat cheese small plate is wonderful, but the tomato soup is lacking a full flavor. The Mac and Cheese is tasty if you're into pasta. I usually stick with a salad because I know I'm going to eat a biscuit or three."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Great location. The elevator to the second floor location is great for gym rats like myself after doing leg day at the gym. The staff is friendly and accommodating, and the food options are wonderful.  I was wowed by the Sweet Potato pancakes. I'm getting hungry just thinking about them.  This is definitely a place you should try if you're in the Charlotte area. I run the light rail trail and pass this place on my runs. I even appreciate the great aromas coming from this place as I struggle to get through my 5 mile run."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, I came here during happy hour for the $3 drafts and $4.50 snacks. The atmosphere is gorgeous, open and full of air and light. Our waitress looked beautiful and professional, I don't remember her name but she was Hispanic, young with dark hair. She was so nice, informative and her service was prompt. Our waters were consistently filled and she cleared dishes just as soon as we were finished. Excellent service, thank you! I ordered a peach wheat beer and the fried green tomatoes, they both were outstanding. Would love to come here for a full meal some day soon, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Awesome place!  Food was fantastic, building is awesome, our server William was fantastic, very attentive!  Fried green tomatoes were excellent, as were the sweet potato pancakes and fried chicken!  Definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I've been trying to come here for awhile after hearing great things about the food (and that they offer gluten free). It became pretty clear why people are so obsessed with this place- the food was delicious and the staff was super helpful and friendly. They have a decent number of options for GF and a separate prep area as well.

Highly recommend making a reservation- even for brunch. They book up fast!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Be sure to make a reservation. Southern food. Great service. You won't regret coming here!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great and Bloody Mary selection is phenomenal. The menu caters to a bit of a more mature , unique flavor pallet."}
{"text":"I've been to the Asheville location, and this wasn't a let down.  Our food and service was great for a Friday night!  The biscuits weren't available immediately, until the manager corrected our server 2 seconds after telling us they weren't.  The meatloaf was tasty, mac 'n cheese was done well, and the porter I had was delicious.  Also, the remodel on this location was well done.  Not as dark and shady as the previous restaurant.  I had no clue they had so much space.

We will be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite brunch spot in Charlotte thus far! Both times I have been there I have gotten great service and even better food. They change the menu regularly so if you get something you really like chances are you won't get it again so enjoy it! Good news it whatever they replace it with will be just as good! Their menu is southern inspired and even have goat cheese grits! I'm obsessed with goat cheese so anywhere that has it on the menu is good in my book. Their bloody Mary's are made with jalapeño infused moonshine! Very spicy so beware if that is not your cup of tea. I can't wait to go back for their next menu change to see what other delicious food I can eat!"}
{"text":"couple of years ago, my husband and I visited Tupelo Honey Cafe  I made a reservation for Saturday evening and when we arrived, we were seated promptly. The atmosphere is very inviting- there are many seats however it is not overly loud. The way the tables are situated with the separators, made it also seem intimate. Our waitress, Lauren, was very friendly and very knowledgeable with the menu. The pimento cheese appetizer was not too spicy nor was it too runny which made it easy to dip the chips into. My husband raved over the peach poblano pork ribs (small plates section) and enjoyed the cole slaw which accompanied it. The portion was a nice size and could be considered a meal if someone wasnt too hungry. I enjoyed the bean burger, which had the proper amount of seasoning, along with a side of mac and cheese. I dont care for hamburger buns so I put that aside and just ate the burger- I am really able to taste the sauce this way and it was good. The fried chicken with milk gravy, mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts was also ordered and consumed with lots of 'Yumms and boy is this good' comments. Overall, we had a great experience. There is valet parking outside the restaurant if you wish or just drive further down the street and there is a lot on the right specially for Tupelo Honey Cafe customers. One thing to note- while the food was fantastic, all the items I mentioned might not be available. We were told that the Ashville location is the only location which doesnt change/rotate their menu items. Although this shouldnt really matter too much because based on our experience, anything you order will taste good"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! My husband and I came for brunch and sat at the bar, because the wait was about 20 minutes and we were starving. Our servers were both very attentive, food was amazing, atmosphere and ambiance was very cool and chill, and the drinks were yummy! I will definately be back!"}
{"text":"We had heard great things about the brunch but were far less than impressed.  We spent over $100 for a group of four and got egg beater omelettes, I've never disliked an omelette but these were bad.  The atmosphere is awesome, but they need to deliver with the ingredients."}
{"text":"Great place! It's tucked away in the South End area. The atmosphere was cool and was an interesting restaurant. I went for brunch with a group of girls and the service was good despite the fact that it was a busy Saturday. 
They bring out the scratch made biscuit and jelly. Amazing!! I don't know how else to describe it!
I ordered a mimosa and it was a good mix of orange juice and champagne unlike a lot of other brunch places. I also ordered the fried chicken breast with macaroni and cheese. The chicken was great! The macaroni and cheese was not my favorite. 
The menu was full of variety. I will be back for lunch and dinner as well."}
{"text":"Not bad. The service here was pretty slow even though we were a party of 5, however, 52min for shrimp and grits which nearly everyone ordered? C'mon. Only redeeming quality were their biscuits and our server was very friendly."}
{"text":"Loved this place!! The wait was long which didn't make much sense because there was a lot of seating available but well worth the wait. I had the goat cheese grits that were delicious with chorizo and an egg. Definitely enjoyed the place but one piece of advise is to reserve ahead, at least for Sunday brunch!"}
{"text":"We had a lovely breakfast on a Saturday morning.  the southern meets modern rustic charm of the restaurant is very fun and our server Sierra was excellent.  The creative take on southern style fare was different while being deliciously familiar.  Fresh biscuits and honey complimentary as you wait for your order were wonderful.  My huevos ranchero was delicious but The fried green tomatoes with grits, Cajun sauce and basil garnish was the show stopper!  

Although is a little on the pricey side for breakfast, it's worth it and if you check in on yelp you earn 10% off.  Definitely recommend Tupelo Honey."}
{"text":"We came in during Saturday brunch. We didn't have a long wait, about 20 minutes, during which my boyfriend got the Bloody Mary which was spicy and delicious. We sat outside on the patio with great weather and enjoyed our drinks, his Bloody Mary and my Sparkling Blueberry Punch. We ordered the okra as an appetizer that came with a white BBQ sauce that was delicious and tangy. We ordered our entrees, he ordered the Pimento and Fried Pickle burger and I ordered the Crab Benedict. Our entrees came out and I was immediately surprised thinking that there would be a fair amount of Crab with mine and there was about a tablespoon scattered throughout the hollandaise sauce. The eggs, which should be poached with a runny yolk had runny whites and a fully cooked yolk. I talked to the waitress and she had them recook the plate. When the second plate came out, the Benedict looked a little better but when I cut into the yolk, it was again cooked all the way through. So I didn't want to complain again, I tried to eat the rest of my plate. The Crab and the hollandaise sauce were good, nothing spectacular. It also comes with potato cracklins which in my case was a roughly chopped potato and ended up being an entire half of potato that was not cooked all the way through. At that point, I gave up. The waitress did not come back to check on the second plate but proceeded to drop the check without saying anything. I tipped 20% because I'm a waitress too and know it was not her fault that the food was wrong. I don't typically write reviews on restaurants, but this was bad enough that it warranted a review as well as a note left on the check. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, not like OMG this is the best brunch I've ever had but pretty good. Very expensive for brunch. I had the French toast which was ok. My boyfriend had the chicken and biscuits which were delicious."}
{"text":"Our experience here was amazing  food was to die for  service was excellent  our waiter Alex was super friendly and attentive!  Well worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great service. The food is mostly good and the biscuits are delicious"}
{"text":"3rd visit here. Mediocre at best.  Would so go to Pikes across the street than here.  Other than the biscuit I wouldn't recommend much more.  Sorry. Not impressed."}
{"text":"I had been to this location once before and thought the design and atmosphere were nice very appealing but didn't remember the food being all that spectacular. Tonight I decided to recommend it for dinner with a group of friends that had come into town and I was very disappointed and regretful of my recommendation. First, we were told that it would be a 35-45 minute wait for a group of five. 
Ok no big deal! For a Saturday evening at dinner time that's to be expected. The problem was that for the entire 40 minutes that we waited to get seated,  multiple tables sat empty the entire time. Some of them had reserved signs, however 40 minutes in advance is ridiculous....or if the party that made the reservation is that late??? When we were finally seated, we were placed at a table that I had noticed being made ready 20 minutes prior to them calling us!! Why so long? 
Secondly, all the host/hostest up front kept playing around with other employees and goofing off and didn't seem to be motivated. 
Once we were seated we had to ask for most everything twice and some of the food was not brought out when we received our order. 
I am very disappointed in the service and the food was far too overpriced for the quality.
I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Yummy! Everything we ordered was great! Watermelon salad was delicious. Server Jonathan was very attentive."}
{"text":"I feel like this is a place to go for breakfast or brunch but not for dinner. Even for lunch not a lot on the menu for sandwiches or salads. Good atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"Tupelo Honey is consistently amazing! 
The food, service and atmosphere all get 5 stars from me. 
Special mention: Kevin, Amber and Cesar.  
Thanks for the hospitality!!!"}
{"text":"Anyone who knows me knows that I absolutely love my parents. So....when they decided to escape the storm in Myrtle by coming to Charlotte the planning started! Where we would go for dinner was at the top of the list and I decided on here. I had been twice before and was thoroughly pleased. This was no different...actually it was better!!

Awesome doesn't begin to describe our waiter, Jonathan Hafer. I think \"Excellence\" would be most appropriate, as that is exactly how he served us...with excellence! Jonathan was very knowledgeable and able to guide us through our food choices. We wetent \"waiting\" to see him or have our drinks refilled...he was always there. He didn't miss a beat!

Chef Dave and his team executed with perfection! Our food was cooked to perfection arriving to the table piping hot! I had chicken and sweet potato pancakes...can you say O.M.G! The pancake has real smashed sweet potatoes in the batter!! It was so large that I couldn't eat it all. My son ate the rest of it the next day he said (with his eyes bulging) \"Ma! Where did you get this pancake\"? The others had the meatloaf, curry fried chicken, broiled trout and fried shrimp. Everyone left pleased! Oh don't let me forget...wait for it......the fried green tomatoes....wait for it some more....the fried avocado! Yes, I said fried avocado! Both make you want to sit back with your eyes rolling up in your head. I don't even have a word to describe those two dishes....just get there!"}
{"text":"This place was really great!  We flew in from Texas so that we could drive into High Point for market and found this little gem from a Yelp review.  It was everything we were hoping for and more.   We sat outside and enjoyed the ambiance, service, and food.  We started with the southern popcorn and Carolina white sauce- they were golden crispy and large in size- just perfect.....however, the homemade biscuit and jam served blew us out of the water and we could've had more than one of those....could have made a meal of them for sure!  So good-and Tupelo should never do away with the biscuit & jam- it's amazing!  For my entree I ordered the shoo mercy grill cheese and soup- my head exploded from the awesomeness!  Havarti cheese, pimento cheese, bacon, ham, basil, and a fried green tomato- how can you go wrong?!?  My only negative comment would be that the consistency of my tomato soup was very thin and watery in texture; however the flavor was nice and smokey so i could overlook the texture.  The rest of my party ordered a vegetable platter where you could select from their farm fresh sides-
they were not disappointed and the other ordered a signature Salad with a very interesting mixture and combo of vegetables....all were happy and if given the opportunity- I will definitely be back!  Good job Tupelo!  I will tell you that there were other restaurants that ranked higher than Tupelo- tried one of those places a few days later and it was a total let down- nowhere near the caliber of Tupelo....."}
{"text":"Whew! I was in NC for the weekend and my friends who live there decided let's try Tupelo Honey for Saturday Brunch. Even you are going on the weekend, be prepared to wait, a long wait! But, it's so worth it. You can relax on the outside patio. I will start with the biscuits, nice and fluffy, paired with the honey and it tastes well. The first drink I ordered, I didn't like and the waitress was nice enough to exchange it for a classic Mega Mimosa which was tasty. Everyone at the table enjoyed the food and beverages. Will tell rave about this place and tell all who visits Charolette to din here!"}
{"text":"Tupelo has delicious French toast and a variety of omelets. The place is quite large so it's easy to get a spot with a minimal wait.  I'm taking a star off because the coffee is terrible!  Such a high quality restaurant should have better coffee"}
{"text":"Came here for another Sunday brunch and was again blown away. This is quickly becoming my go to brunch place. We sat in the bar because there was a small wait when we arrived. I am very happy that we did because our server, Calvin, was fantastic. He was very attentive and had really great menu suggestions. My two friends and I were having a really hard time deciding on what to get so we decided to split three items. We split the Blueberry Pain Perdu, Famous Sweet Potato Pancake, and the Genuine Country Breakfast with over-easy eggs sausage, and potato cracklins. 

The Blueberry Pain is sweet. I definitely could not have eaten a full plate of them, but as a portion of my breakfast it was perfect. The Sweet Potato pancake was also delicious. It actually inspired me to look up sweet potato pancake recipes when i got home. Basically i want to have this for breakfast every day. It was fantastic but again super sweet so consider splitting this with someone. For the genuine country breakfast please see my review above. It is a classic for a reason."}
{"text":"This place has a great atmosphere and wonderful staff. If you can sit on the patio, definitely do it. The biscuits are also warm, fluffy, and fresh out of the oven. That being said, they tend to over cook their eggs. If you specify that you want a runny yolk, it'll be runny but a poached or Sunny side up egg will definitely come out cooked all the way through! Otherwise food was good. It was an all around lovely experience."}
{"text":"Visited Tupelo Honey the other day during Happy Hour and loved it. We had never been there before, and our server, Destiny, was kind and patient and answered all our questions. We ordered several items off the food and drink menu for happy hour, all of which were delicious. The veggie burger was one of the best I've ever had, and the grits that accompanied the fried green tomatoes were super creamy. There was a lot more food than we expected. The food and drinks on the regular menu are certainly not cheap, but we will definitely be back during happy hour!"}
{"text":"After all the hype about Tupelo Honey, I was not impressed. They were very accommodating to our party of 14, celebrating a graduation when we arrived late due to bad timing on our part in regard to the light rail schedule from UNCC. Our server Darius was very friendly. The bartender must have been slammed as drink service was super slow and the cocktail presentations were VERY inconsistent. Second round of Madame Beauregarde - Blueberry-Basil Martini had no garnishes was the color was downright scary - a pepto pink. The first Mojito Du Jour was delicious and refreshing but the second one was served in a much smaller glass and had the same tinge of pepto pink as the second Madame Beauregarde. The food was ok. The fried green tomatoes were obviously out of season but grits were divine. The portion of the Pimento Cheese Nachos was just enough to make you hangry. The biscuits were fantastic and the blueberry compote so amazing my BIL bought a jar. My salad was good, hard to mess up a bowl of lettuce. The fried chicken on top was tasty. Biggest complaint however was lack of clean up after appetizers and two rounds of beverages. Of all the restaurants in Charlotte it will be awhile before I will head here again - hopefully things will improve."}
{"text":"The breakfast bowl was delicious! The biscuit with honey and jam was even better! Can't wait to come back and try different menu items!"}
{"text":"So, it's New Year's Day and Tupelo Honey is not serving collard greens.  Y'all really should take any reference to being southern out of your restaurant descriptions."}
{"text":"I love Tupelo honey cafe. The potato pancakes are worthy of awards! I also really enjoy the chicken and biscuits. Creamy gravy, delicious chicken (very juicy) and the fluffy biscuits. There is a variety of options if you prefer to eat healthy, vegan or southern! Each guest receives a complimentary biscuit with homemade jam and honey upon arrival. Delish!"}
{"text":"We came after lunch time, but found it to be still incredibly busy.  We were given a 45 minute wait period, but really only waited about 20, so that was great.  We enjoyed the biscuits and jam very much.  We also ordered the grit cakes for an appetizer.  They were pretty good when you paired them with the sauce/salsa provided.  My husband had the po boy sandwhich and he said it was pretty good.  I had a veggie sandwhich that was pretty tasty.  I had the cheesy cauliflower which was decent for my side.  My husband had the okra with NC sauce, which we could not seem to stop eating.  I really liked that even though things might have been fried, they were light and not greasy!  I look forward to returning again to sample their breakfast menu!"}
{"text":"The staff is always extremely friendly and the food is amazing. Not very often do you find a place that the food is worth coming back for AND have a wide variety of great beer. LOVE the sweet potato pancakes!!!"}
{"text":"WI would highly recommend this place!! We wanted a late breakfast/brunch and their menu was just what we were looking for. The avocado toast and fried green tomatoes were to die for! So fresh and crisp- my boyfriend had the fried chicken blt and said it was one of the best ones he's ever had and we've been to our fair share of good fried chicken places! Great spot totally check it out!!"}
{"text":"I love you Boston but I'm sorry, some things you just have to go south for, like good southern cooking. I know some may not consider North Carolina part of the south, (not south enough to be southern but not north enough to be part of the northeast), but I have found that they do southern cuisine well enough to be considered an honorary member! 

At Tupelo, I came for the biscuits. Considered by other yelpers as the best in the state, with good reason. It's everything a biscuit should be: layered with buttery goodness. The poppy seeds (pretty sure that's what it was) and blueberry jam just take it to another level. Should have asked for seconds (you know, just to be sure it was safe for the other diners)

The Mac and cheese, simply
Wow. These are baked rather than stove top and topped with breadcrumbs. 

Also had the tacos. Fried chicken(the greatest food ever) in a taco (perhaps the greatest food vehicle ever lol), with homemade slaw. What is there not to love? Word to the wise: the jalepeno's pack a serious punch. 

Tupelo, I shall return"}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW!!!! Very very good food. The drinks are insanely good!! See Jonathan as he is an incredible host! Will make you feel amazing. Knows the menu and drinks inside and out!! I would give them more stars if I could!!!!"}
{"text":"Great experience with fantastic food! 
-Pimento cheese nachos: filled with an abundance of toppings. The pimento cheese is a nice change from traditional nacho cheese sauce.
-Complimentary biscuits and jam: heavenly. The biscuits had the perfect amount of buttery taste a crumble. The jam was a sweet compliment to the already flavorful biscuit.
-Fried Chicken and Potato Pancakes: goodbye chicken and waffles and hello to this dish. It was sweet yet savory. The hot honey is a must if you're a spicy food lover.

I can't want to come back and try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here after a few friends recommended Tupelo from their experience in Virginia. We arrived, knowing it would be a wait. No problem. We've been on a culinary tour of the city & I was stoked to try this place. 

We hopped in line & the guy ahead of us was told there was a 20 minute wait. When we stepped up next, I was told \"1 hour 20 minutes.\" Now, coming in there were 2 set & ready tables, and 1 that was waiting to be bussed. I declined the wait list and walked out confused. 

The waiter outside asked as we passed his empty tables \"leaving so soon\" and we asked him were his tables reserved. He said they're first come basis, self seating outside and told us to tell the hostess to seat us outside since he's \"wide open.\" I walked back in and reiterated this to the hostess who replied \"I'm only one person\" then asked if I wanted to get on the \"1 hour\" waiting list. 

1 how did we get to 1 hour in under 2 minutes? 2 how did we get an hour longer wait than the guy ahead of us? 3 why wasn't she seating the waiter who was available and happy to serve during peak hours?? Because they offer a vegetarian option in addition to all the meat for brunch, I could see this having been a possible favorite for us, but the first experience here was far too poor to ignore. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome is the best word to describe this restaurant......experience from the service to the decor to food...... the baked Mac and Cheese appetizer to the blue mimosa to the biscuit and honey fried chicken and biscuit with milk gravy shrimp and grits awesome awesome awesome I give this restaurant  Five Stars double ove!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Found this gem while visiting family in North Carolina. I fell immediately in love. It's a great brunch spot with a southern flare. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The waiting area has very comfy couches that you can enjoy your mimosa  while waiting.

Now let's get to the food. Talk about delish! I meant to take a picture of my breakfast; Appalachian breakfast but I was starving. All I could say is that I loved everything. My boyfriend had the banana pudding layered pancake and  the southern shakshuka. Don't miss out on that pancake! 

A must try if you are in the area. They accept reservations which I recommend and you can enjoy brunch until 3pm."}
{"text":"This was my first time here. I'm from out of town, so I decided to try something new and I wasn't disappointed by the food! There were a few things that could use improvement but all in all, I enjoyed myself. For one, it took us a long time to get a server and once she came over, we realized that she had walked by our table multiple times and not said one word.
A simple, \"hey, I will be right with yall.\" Would have made things a little better, but Keondra turned out to be a very nice server, although she was sometimes pretty slow, so it was bearable. As for the beginning complimentary biscuit, it was a little saltier than I anticipated, but very good paired with the blueberry jam and honey. For my main entree, we went for brunch. I had the eggs Betty and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's ham and medium poached eggs(my first time trying poached) on top of a biscuit with lemony hollandaise(which I had never heard of or tried). I picked my side of goat cheese grits. Everything was pretty good. I wasn't a fan of the lemony hollandaise, but that's just a personal preference. It was garnished with a pretty little orchid, which made me happy, because I love flowers. I loved the atmosphere, liked the food, felt service could improve, but I do believe that I would come back."}
{"text":"Had some friends coming in town for brunch on a Sunday and they suggested Tupelo.  I was STOKED to learn that they take reservations now.  This is a life changer, especially with Charlotte passing the new brunch bill serving drannnnksss at 10!

I made a reservation for 11:30 on Sunday.  We were seated at 11:45, which was amazing because there was an hour and a half wait!  There were people everywhere.

Once we were seated everything moved quickly.  Our server came over promptly and took our drink orders.  I went with the mega mimosa, with just a splash of OJ. 

Drinks came out quickly and I was surprised at how generous my mimosa pour was.  The server also brought out some of those delicious biscuits with jelly and honey.  These are amazing.  

For the order my husband and I split the sho mercy pancake meal.  The portion was huge and was plenty for us to split, so don't let the price tag fool you. 

There were four pancakes, fruit, two eggs? Two pieces of bacon, and some amazing butter and syrup. (See my picture). All of the flavors went together perfectly and it was really good!!!! I try to eat healthy most of the time but I didn't mind splurging for this.

To top it off Tupelo had sent me a coupon to sample their mason jar desserts.  O.M.G. These were sooooooo good! My favorite was the peanut butter one with pretzels and chocolate.  We left stuffed and happy."}
{"text":"The food was ok for me. Not a lot to choose from in regards to breakfast choices. When we went the restaurant wasn't that busy but someone in our party didn't receive their food until we were almost finished eating. The manager was very apologetic and brought the food out personally. The biscuits and jam were good."}
{"text":"Amazing service and very willing to work with allergies.Superb food, and the atmosphere was very inviting and urban."}
{"text":"These people know how to do brunch like pros.  The biscuits are divine. 
 The shrimp and grits had big shrimp, fabulous veggies, and a big serving of love (or perhaps butter?) was inspiring. The vibe? Delightfully chill.  Filled with natural light. Fun location.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have to say, I was excited to go here when I moved to Charlotte.  I had heard good things about the other locations and knowing it was a NC staple, it only seemed fitting.  They were just about to release their cookbook so I knew it would be an exciting time to visit.  I was not disappointed.  The food is great.  We had pimiento cheese with tortilla chips and I had a veggie burger.  Both were satisfying and everything to be expected.  Also, the pickled jalapeños and pickled okra that come on the plates were pretty awesome.  Please do not confuse them for garnish!  You'll be missing out.

Now for the important part.  The beer.  The beer selection was varied and interesting with a pleasant number of local beer options including their signature Tupelo Honey Rye which is brewed with NC malts and crafted in Knoxville, TN.  It's sweet and light, perfect with dinner.

Check this place out and make sure to request to sit on the shaded balcony.  So cozy."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the meal. I had the honey dusted chicken, the proportions were magnificently large and filling. I'm happy they served in such a way. I also had the shrimp and grits with added chorizo!! And the okra for an appetizer! I love the decor and setting."}
{"text":"This place is so cute, I love the interior and the staff. Our waitress was so sweet. In addition, the food was great! The biscuits were warm and delicious and never ending, and the fried chicken BLT was also great! I had dessert, cheesecake to be exact, and that was scrumptious as well. The only thing I had that I didn't like was the pork belly collards which were kind of greasy. Otherwise I would definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"We went here for brunch last Sunday. They had a 35 minute wait so a reservation would have been a good idea, but then we got lucky and got a table in the bar area which is apparently first come, first served. The menu is huge and overwhelming. I wanted to try the Queen Mary which is a Bloody Mary with a LOT of things in it, but according to state law, you can't drink alcohol before noon on Sundays and I didn't want to wait. 
I ordered the shoo mercy omelet, my husband ordered the Tupelo Farm Fresh burger, and our friends ordered the shoo mercy cheesy grill sandwich and the sweet potato pancakes. I'll make this easy -- everything was amazingly delicious! (Yes I tried everyone's food)
Basically anything shoo mercy is delicious. It's all the same stuff in different forms: sandwich, omelet, shrimp n' grits etc.
Also, serving sizes are huge so come with an appetite. I couldn't finish more than a quarter of my omelet so needless to say, I had it for another meal."}
{"text":"Yum! This was my first time here and it did not disappoint. They have a nice selection of southern food. I love the decor and the staff was very friendly. I tried the frose and it was refreshing and delicious. I tried a few things. Pimento cheese, pork sliders and banana pudding. I really liked the pimento cheese. It had a nice texture to it and it was very flavorful. The banana pudding was good but a little too bready for my liking. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"We throughly enjoyed our experience at Tupelo Honey. This has only been open for a few weeks, but there were no signs of that at our meal. The service was excellent, taking care of our needs but not overwhelming us with constant attention. The food was wonderful. My wife throughly enjoyed her Charleston chicken sandwich. I had the steak au poivre and loved every bite. The quality of the steak was outstanding and it was cooked to perfection. And the mac & cheese was, in a word, incredible. I would marry this mac & cheese. I wanted to go to other tables and ask if they had any leftover mac & cheese I could finish off. We will definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"My first stop in Charlotte and it did not disappoint! The smell of honey hits you once you step out of the !

Cute place with quite a few outside tables.

The biscuits came out warm and toasty; jam was given with it but I just used the honey instead.

The prices were affordable. I ordered the white sangria was a little bit on the sweet side. Portions were decent.

Our waiter Jameson was !

Definitely would recommend."}
{"text":"We hosted a Beer Babes Brunch Sunday, March 22nd and it was not only a blast but well executed. Kevin was such a pleasure to work with and made sure to accommodate our every need. The Chef also did a fantastic job making sure that all the food specifications and allergies were accounted for. He even prepared a few individual dishes for those with specific needs. The ladies enjoyed everything about the brunch from the beer cocktails and food, to the man named Kevin! Lol Such a fun event that we would LOVE to host again!"}
{"text":"Saturday morning brunch in Charlotte. This place is a nice southern style farm to table type restaurant. Their brunch reminds me of this place called noble crust in St. Petersburg, FL. 

We were seated immediately. It is spacious with an open kitchen , so you can see the food cooking. I got the pre fix menu and they offered two choices between appetizers and an entree. I went with the pear salad and the crab Benedict with bottomless coffee.

They started us out with biscuits with homemade blueberry jam. The jam looked extremely fresh with the berries still intact. The pear salad was pretty but kind of hard to eat with the big Bibb lettuce. It was a nice light start to get some good greens in. If your trying to keep a more trim meal I would go with this vs the avocado toast. 

The crab Benedict was ok. The best part was the biscuit but it was kind of lukewarm. It wasn't something that I would rave about. I swapped out the potato cracklin with the Brussel Sprouts. I loved those. Very crispy and flavorful. It was only an extra dollar to do so. The other items on the menu looked amazing and it was kind of hard to pick what I wanted. This is somewhere I would definitely come back to when I am in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"As a local, I've seen Tupelo on lots of \"best of\" lists but I haven't tried it until this past Sunday. We made  reservations for 10am and we're seated quickly right next to the expo station and open kitchen window. Service was friendly and consistent. Our waiter didn't leave us waiting for anything. We watched food come up to be taken out to tables while we decided to order. I settled on French toast which was 3 half slices with blueberry compote. I liked my food and ended up needing to take a piece home. I ate way too much between the biscuit and the two pieces. I felt sick on my way home. My husband ordered the Eggs Betty on a biscuit. His eggs were cold which took away from the dish. We weren't surprised our food was not hot as we saw plates come up and sit in the window for a while before being served. The restaurant was busy and there seemed to be tons of wait staff milling around the window but the plates kept piling up. Between our two plates, a side of fries, a coffee and a sweet tea (no alcohol since we weren't there until 12p) we spent around $50 with tip. Pretty hefty but it seemed like some of the plates were huge portions that could've served two. Overall, I wouldn't come back unless I were invited by someone else. I can't imagine if we'd gotten drink and spent $70 on one meal."}
{"text":"The food was tasteful, the drinks were delicious, the service was off.

Even as an appetizer, the Blistered & Spiced Grilled Okra was the star of the show for us. Everyone enjoyed their food for the most part and the presentation was pleasant. However our experience hindered us to appreciate our first visit at Tupelo. Our waitress failed to provide us with enough utensils and napkins, messed up 4 out of the 4 bills at the table, entirely served me the wrong entree, and didn't bother to check up once she delivered the food. We just ate, fixed the two main faulty bills, and got out of there. I assume an experience like this is an oddity for a four-star average restaurant."}
{"text":"My mouth is watering just thinking about this place! Wow! I cannot get enough of the chicken and waffles! If you want some amazing Southern Style food with a classy twist, come here! Its a great idea to bring friends from out of town here. They will love it and feel like they had true southern down home cookin' yet sophisticated and unexpected. It is best to make a reservation, but don't fret, its well worth the wait. The staff is super friendly and they keep the place super clean and the food coming quick. Do not, I repeat, do not leave the premises without trying a biscuit with some honey. You're welcome!"}
{"text":"They completely changed their menu and raised their prices. Not the place it used to be. What happened?"}
{"text":"An absolute horrific experience from the moment we sat to leaving. It took over 6 minutes for someone to even notice we had sat down, though we had been seated right next to the kitchen. When we were finally brought water my glass had food stuck to the inside of it. We ordered food and it took 35 minutes to get 2 sandwiches at 2 pm brunch on a Saturday. Unacceptable. Our server, though polite, clearly too busy. He apologized about the long wait for our food and offered desert. Food was prepared hurriedly and was awful. We ordered dessert to go since we had been there for almost an hour and a half (for again 2 brunch sandwiches) and they came out to the table not to go.  When stated we needed them to go we were told it would ruin the presentation. We asked for a box and packaged it our selves. Biggest waste of $55, at this point I wish we would have canceled our order and left. No manager ever came by. Awful and unacceptable. The issue could have been resolved but it was continued to be made worse. Very, very upset."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I have been talking about going here for dinner for the past 3 months, this weekend her mother happened to be in town so we decided to take a trip to the restaurant. We were seated immediately, but that was the last we heard from any server. We were seated for over 20 minutes and never had a drink or dinner order taken. There were maybe 7 Other tables seated when we came in and 5 servers. 3 tables were seated and served after we arrived. We ended up standing up, and walking out. This was the first time a server spoke to us. You can't pay me to go back here. Liberty tap room across the ally was a much better choice. Primo food and service. Someone needs to get canned out of Honey Tupelo"}
{"text":"My experience at Tupelo Honey was amazing! The food was prepared with care and tasted great. The service I received from Emma L. was second to none;She was patient, kind, and made fantastic drinks/ recommendations. This was all followed up by an incredible sense of welcome from the manager Haley Shore. This is a must visit while in Charlotte!!!! Please ask for Emma and Haley as they will make you feel right at home even if you are out of town. No a business review just an amazing experience"}
{"text":"One of the best southern comfort food restaurant I've been to!

First time in Charlotte and my friend recommends this place after hearing great reviews, so we decide to give it a try.

To start off, they give you some free biscuits to munch on.  (Tip: ask for honey to dip it in, it will change your experience eating them!).

We got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken (Tip: get a side of the crispy Brussels sprouts and dip it with their homemade ranch dressing--it's amazing), Shrimp and Grits and the baked Mac n Cheese.  Everything was delicious!

Service was good--came here during lunch on a Friday, it wasn't too packed so we got a table right away.  (There is a small patio for tables outside for those who like outdoor seating.)

Not sure when I'll have a chance to come back and visit Charlotte, but I would definitely come back here for their food!"}
{"text":"Man! I've been trying to get in this place for two months! Walked in around 10:50 on a Saturday morning and was seated immediately (I didn't have the same luck on a Sunday)!

Our waitress came quickly to her our drink orders and when she returned told us she would give us time to look over the menu and if we had any questions. She came back quickly and took our orders (I HATE when waiters/waitresses take too long to get your order after dropping off your drinks!)

She gave us a short history on the restaurant: where the name came from, locations, where the food comes from, etc. I was excited to hear that almost all of the food is local and grass fed. Don't judge, I'm going through a local foodie hipster phase (I feel like a lot of people in Charlotte do between Plaza Midwood and NoDa). 

Our food was amazing! I uploaded pics for your viewing pleasure. I must say the biscuits/jam were my FAVORITE part! Its food and appearance, both an ode to the South, are a Southerner's dream. In my opinion it was an upgrade of Cracker Barrel! A Charlotte favorite, it's definitely worth a try. 

You're welcome."}
{"text":"Overall their food is amazing. I would like to see more cider options, but that is my only complaint. The servers are always friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Biscuits.  Yes, I said it, the biscuits are great.  I came here for a tasting as a +1 for a Yelp Elite event and then came back on a Monday night with friends and family.  First, the menu is big, but no Cheesecake Factory.  Fortunately after a tasting and a dine-in visit, I got a chance to sample a few things including the crab cakes, scallops, Appalachian Egg Rolls, catfish and goat cheese grits.  Out of those my favorites were the scallops (perfectly cooked) and the egg rolls mostly because there was pulled pork inside!  And of course the biscuits with the berry jam & the tupelo honey.  Apparently the story is the honey used to come from bees in the Tupelo, MS area, but recent devastation caused a shortage.  Now they are getting the honey from a similar strain of bees, hence keeping with Tupelo.

The crab cakes, I felt, had a bit too much breading and a more cakey consistency.  The catfish was normal, nothing special.  The goat cheese grits is not your Mama's grits.  It took me slightly off guard as I'm used to traditional cheese grits, but I love goat cheese, and of course the two together can take a little to get used to. 

The crowd was lively on a Monday night, but probably because they just opened recently.  Parking can also be an issue as both times I had to park on a side street since the lot was always full.  Come prepared.  I'll come back to try the many other creative items on the menu making it a fresh change in the traditional southern fare.   Would I like more biscuits.  Yes, I'll have one more.... plate."}
{"text":"First time visiting this restaurant which was recommended by a friend on a Thursday Afternoon. It was not busy at all and we were able to sit on the patio. Holliday was our server and was great! She gave us both food and drink recommendations. I had the steak salad and my boyfriend had the friend chicken BLT. Both were both delicious. Yelp also had 10% off for check ins! I would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. Reservation at 11:15a....finally hunted down waitress for her to take our food order...45 min later. Served our food just before 1p. Had to chase down for refills which only actually materialized once...empty cups for our extra long wait. Table next to us left...which may have been why we got our food at all. 

Blame hostess - she sat 4 tables back to back. Manager was useless and didn't seem to care."}
{"text":"I was able to have a quick late breakfast, early lunch prior to a client meeting.  No wait, small quaint little place that fit my need due to meeting after in the same area.  I'm not normally opposed to greasy food, but some of my plate was simply dripping with grease.  Not terrible, but it could be better.   Maybe a second try will generate better results."}
{"text":"Tip! I tried going here after 11am on a Sunday and it was around 1.5 hr wait for 2 ppl. Pretty ridiculous! If you wanna try their brunch, get their by 1030 or before, wait will be around 10-20 min.

Our server was very helpful in recommending popular orders. I had the fried chicken breast BLT sandwich which he recommended w avocado, amazing! Chicken was juicy, veggies were ripe, and fries were seasoned well. Only downside was the biscuits. It came out after our dishes and didn't taste fresh and wasn't warm."}
{"text":"This past weekend my sisters came into town and we wanted to give them the Southern Food experience.  I'm so glad I decided on Tupelo Honey Cafe.  We went in for Saturday Brunch and we had the pleasure of being served by Jonathan.  He gave us recommendations when we couldn't decide that turned out to be SO GOOD and was so warm and friendly, It was exactly the experience I was hoping my sisters would get (us being from the north).  All around just a lovely time.  This will be my go-to place when we have guests in town from now on."}
{"text":"overall experience was Meh. we were a party of 6 seated quickly and the restaurant was not very busy. our server was very nice and attentive, however she was working several tables both inside and outside and appeared to be the only waitress working the floor. it took a nearly 25 minutes for our drinks (two cocktails and a beer) to be served and another 10 minutes for the appetizer. Some food items were better than others. as someone visiting the area for a long weekend, i'm not sure i would recommend out of all the other options in Charolette."}
{"text":"The food was good and very eclectic southern.  I ordered 2 drinks, Cosmo and Mint Mojito on the menu and they did not have the ingredients to make them. Biscuits are great!!  Service was good.  However, in NC they have health rating system for restaurants and they only had a 90.8, 95+ is about the lowest you want to see.  Looks like they might have some kitchen issues."}
{"text":"Had my going away lunch for work. It was very chaotic with not knowing who was coming and how many people since we were a large party, but our server William was awesome. He was very patient and took care of everything! Great food too!"}
{"text":"Okay listen,... this brunch was the bomb!! I was a bit underwhelmed in general by the food scene in Charlotte, but this was my first stop after hitting the city and I'm glad I stayed.

Food: I had the Shoo Mercy Pancake and I was so happy with it. That sweet potato pancake was perfectly sweet and a little bit savory. The fried chicken on top and peppered bacon simply took the dish over the top. I ate just about ALL of it. It was delicious, The only thing that I did not care for were the pecans sprinkled on top of the dish, as I am not too fond of nuts on top of or baked into my food. Luckily, they were whole nuts so I was easily able to chuck them off of the plate and dive in. I also ordered the mega-mosa mimosa, it was nice and strong. They have two mimosa options, a regular sized one in a wine glass for $8, and the mega one in a regular draft glass for like $9..do yourself a favor and get the mega size. It is virtually ALL sparkling wine! Yessss! As if I wasnt stuffed enough from the pancake I could not leave this place without also trying on the complimentary hot biscuits w/blueberry jam. Great biscuit!..Not too doughy, & with just enough crunch on the outside. 

Service: Not too shabby. I went alone on a busy Saturday morning and was finally able to weasel my self onto a bar stool to sit after about 20 mins of waiting on the porch outside. I put my name down for a table initially, but was told by the hostess that the bar area seating is first come, first serve, so if I found a seat there before my table was ready, by all means take it. That's exactly what I did. The bartenders were quick and attentive given the volume of orders they had coming in. I was pleased. My food took only 10 mins to arrive after ordering it. That was impressive given the amount of people in the place.

Atmosphere: Nice decor, but honestly I was just there for the FOOD! :)

Brunch is BUSY here and parking is a bit of a nightmare. There is a lot that the restaursnt shares with the other businesses and it fills quickly. I had to stalk someone for my spot! That is probably the only thing that would deter me from returning frequently. Yet and still, I will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Great service and possibly the best chicken and pancakes. Delicious!!! Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I had been to the location in Ashville and loved it, so I had high hopes, but dinner here was completely disappointing. 

First, our server was indifferent and inattentive. She walked off while my brother in law was mid sentence twice. My father in law asked for iced tea, she came back with a glass of ice and we didn't see her again for 10 minutes. Someone else brought our food by, and it was at least 10-15 minutes before she came to check on is. 

We started with an order of the \"Southern Popcorn\" (fried okra) & it was good. Too many little crumbly pieces of just fried dough, and not very many good pieces of okra, but the pieces we had were good. 

The biscuits and blueberry jam were delicious. The biscuits were super moist, and I could have eaten about 10 of these.

I had the shrimp & grits (shoo mercy style) and while the shrimp mixture was delicious, the grits were pretty bad. They were advertised as goat cheese grits and had zero flavor. They also weren't creamy at all and were just a congealed mass of flavorlessness.

Graham had the catfish and had the same issue with his grits: congealed with zero flavor. The salsa on top was also kind of odd. The catfish was spicy, so maybe it was supposed to calm it down, but it just didn't work well with it. A salsa with more flavor would have been much better.

We had a party of 8, and no one LOVED their dinner. However, the restaurant redeemed itself after the fact. I made a comment on twitter that dinner was disappointing and the GM reached out to me to make things right. While it doesn't change the fact that our dinner sucked, I appreciate the gesture and will give them another chance."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time a week ago. The food was great. I love the rustic look. So chic and cute. The waitress was nice. I was a little confused about how to get in the place which is on the second level. The food got the wings and Brussel sprouts which were really good. I felt the food was a little pricey but since it's in South End, I accepted it to be what it was."}
{"text":"I expected a lot more for the hype of this establishment. The atmosphere was great but the food was just ok."}
{"text":"VERY busy...our server was overwhelmed.
I didn't see what all the hype was about-A true southern experience at best."}
{"text":"What did they do to their menu!? I took my family here for some amazing southern comfort food and instead felt like we were at a restaurant trying to be high end. It was hard not to find something under $13 for lunch. One family member got the garden burger and it came out extremely burnt. Another got a burger and same, completely burnt. The manager made it right and brought them new food but the garden burger was then barely cooked. The service was extremely slow and our waitresses nails were dirty. I left so disappointed in the change of menu and service. Please changes your menu back to how it was when you first opened!"}
{"text":"Wonderful brunch- everything was super delicious and our server, William (Jason) was top notch :) I suggest the super breakfast bowl adding chrizo and the fried green tomatoes. We had a group of 7 and the wait time was very reasonable - 20 mins."}
{"text":"Wasn't bad but wasn't impressed either. Their sweet potatoes could use some help. The biscuits they bring out at the beginning are very good though."}
{"text":"Tupelo Honey has phenomenal food and drink. They're brunch is about as good as it gets. Definitely make a reservation when going here, no matter what day or time."}
{"text":"Overrated. So much hype...while this place is decent, it's not as good as the hype would lead you to believe. Good, but not worth a long wait."}
{"text":"The staff here are super nice. I came here for brunch (mainly the mimosas) but I still wanted food the waitress help me put an order together that wasn't too much food for me. I appreciate the fact That she offered to ask the cook for my special request!"}
{"text":"We came here while visiting friends in Charlotte. The atmosphere is very interesting, I loved the decor! Service was average. The blue berry preserves were by far the highlight of the meal. My husband even put it on his omelet. The dining area was fairly loud, and a little difficult to hear even the people at your table. The waiting area was outside and shady, which was a plus as they were packed for Saturday afternoon brunch. Overall we enjoyed our experience and would go back if we are ever back in Charlotte."}
{"text":"One of my favorites.  Great iced tea, delicious biscuits and chicken.  Clean, usually very good service (but if it's busy it can get a little hectic) and plenty filling. Priced reasonably!!  I've never had a bad experience here! My kids (grown) love their Okra!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes, it is all about location, location, location which is where this place has got it right! Although it can be very \"promising\", make sure you aren't in a hurry before coming. However, It is a hotspot during Sunday brunch. When most of us don't care what time it is anyway.

Located in the center of \"Southend\", Tupelo Honey is where it's at! I have eaten here for years and recommend it to friends and family. It is somewhere I go when I have extra cash and looking to impress. Haven't seen a friend in awhile and have PLENTY of time to catch up? Well, then this is the place to go. Why? Because the service moves very slow. Not sure if they do this because they believe, the longer you're there the more you will spend, but It happens every time I visit. However, this is the only thing I can find wrong with it.

Aside from the slow service, I think the food is to die for! It is healthy and hearty, and the portions are huge. Definitely not a tapas restaurant here! During my latest visit, I had the eggs Benedict with goat cheese grits. I love anything with goat cheese so I went with my gut, and boy was I right! 

this restaurant is unique because they bring a fancy twist to Southern style food. Furthermore, the street side view is amazing from the luxurious balcony seating.The perfect spot to enjoy your farm fresh meal on a warm summer day!"}
{"text":"We wanted to see what all the fuss was about so we gave it a try on a rainy Saturday and sat at a table in the mostly empty bar.  
Pros- Hands down the best biscuits I have EVER had, good local beer selection, the fried green tomatoes were amazing and mac and cheese for a side was good. 
Cons- the specialty drinks are tiny and very pricey (but tasted ok), the black bean burger did not have much flavor, had to request the biscuits before our meal and the service was very slow. Honestly, it is over priced for what it is. We will not go back."}
{"text":"Long waits usually but so worth it. The Queen Mary Bloody Mary is worth the $14 as it is a meal in itself."}
{"text":"Great food, bad service. Had to get my own coffee. Server had his head up his ass whole time."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch with the family while on vacay in Charlotte. Our server, Maggie, was a sweetheart. The lavender martini was fabulous and so was the homemade biscuits with fresh blueberry jam! We had a variety of entrees but the shrimp and grits with chorizo was my favorite."}
{"text":"Service was good food was a little above average. Would have given another star however there dinner menu in week nights is very small. I've heard nothing but good things about their brunch so Id suggest trying that unless you really in a tight spot and everywhere else was busy with long waits. I went on a Thursday evening and it wasn't busy at all."}
{"text":"Took the parents here for brunch one Sunday. PRO TIP: make a reservation. Not my first time coming here but it was theirs. Ordered coffee, and a bloody Mary to get started. While the bloody Mary was fantastic it was also fun sized which kind of threw me off. Everyone's coffee was cold which was also kind of a bummer. Other than that the food was killer. Sweet potato pancakes are a must. While the menu may seem pricey, dont worry you get what you pay for and that is quality. Will be back."}
{"text":"Understandably busy brunch crowd on a Sunday - allowing for extreme business - still no excuse to wait 45 minutes for food from the time of order. Especially when the two tables next to us, sat when we did, ordered, ate, paid and left the restaurant before our food has even arrived."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the entire state of North Carolina. 

I have never eaten a bad meal here. This is one of the rare places where everything actually is good. 

Everything. Fried green tomatoes... Grilled cheese... Meat loaf... Fried Chicken... Everything. 

Eat here!"}
{"text":"Eh... I expected a lot better from what I've heard and after an hour wait...( I've been to the one in Asheville- and it's just not the same). I will say service was friendly (but slow), but the food just wasn't good.
Brunch:
I ordered a crab and egg dish- and after it took about 50 minutes to come out, it just wasn't good. It lacked flavor and spices, and was definitely not worth the $14. My husband got a meat pie after the server recommended it- also, not very impressive and not a lot of meat in it. 
After we were asked how the food was, we told our server that we weren't very happy with it, the manager came over and apologized and gave us a gift card to try again. At least they care... 
Too bad the food wasn't good..."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for. Food was good, wait was long, and I found the experience to be a pleasure in the end."}
{"text":"Tupelo Honey is a great place to get some quality Southern food. I've only been to the Charlotte South End location, but it has never disappointed. Their brunch is excellent, but it does get busy so expect a wait.

I went this past week for dinner and had such a great experience. William (our waiter) was attentive and did a fantastic job. The restaurant was very slow for dinner time, but the dinner menu is different than their brunch menu so it was nice to see the different options available. I got the Pear Salad which was so fresh and an interesting combination of flavors. 

Tupelo is a stable, if you're passing through Charlotte, you should stop in. If you live in Charlotte and haven't been yet, you're making a mistake."}
{"text":"Excellent menu choices, presentation and food! Highly recommend for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"I think the atmosphere is charming. I've had Sierra here twice and she's charming and very accommodating. The biscuits are great. I've only been to brunch so I can't say much for the rest of the menu but there's delicious stuff for everyone st the table. Give it a go, I'm sure you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Super super super cute.  Nice indoor space (deprecate bar and dining area), and really cute outdoor seating!  

I came on business because the reviews were great, and this place didn't disappoint.  The happy hour menu is pretty extensive-I tried the fried green tomatoes (amazing), and the shrimp taco (you'll probably want to order 2, as there's only one per order-especially if it's dinner for you).  I also tried their lemon mint martini-didn't love it (it's made with moonshine, so it was a bit strong), but then I got a raspberry ginger one, and that was a bit better.

Best part is at the start-they give you a biscuit with honey and blueberry jam-all 3 things from scratch-so cute!"}
{"text":"Came for brunch and sat on the patio! The patio is awesome and the fried chicken and biscuits are better! My servers name was HOLLIDAY and everyday must be a Holiday at tupelo!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful. 2nd time at Tupelo and it was amazing. Matt our server was attentive and kind. While service at the bar was slow our food was reasonable in timing. Matt was keeping us informed about what was going on. Our waters were always filled. The small plate of shrimp mac and cheese absolutely loved it, it is worth the carbs. The market fish (Corvina) with garlic risotto and tomatoes excellent, the balsamic flavor I believe it was on the tomatoes I could have done without. However, still good. My other two dining pals got the salmon and curried fried chicken. Salmon was gone, i saw the plate get there and i saw it empty moments later thats about it. Curried fried chicken, the pieces of chicken were rather small would have prefer one more piece and less sides. It was still delicious. The fried chicken is a boneless breast, which is more like chicken tenders not fried chicken, that's why we got salmon. To each thier own. For good southern food, I go to Tupelo."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots!! Not sure if the Cauliflower Steak is new, but OMG it is so delicious!!! Especially for those looking for meatless options. Bailey was at the bar and she is amazing!!

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So glad They came to Charlotte. I always make a point to visit when I visit Asheville but now I can try other places there! The food is so yummy. I really love the goat cheese grits. Not a huge fan of the biscuits they served but love everything else."}
{"text":"Fantastic place for brunch!  It's a beautifully decorated space - bright and airy. The service was friendly, fast and attentive. The menu is full of southern favorites with a modern twist. For instance, they serve goat cheese grits. I am not, I repeat NOT a fan of goat cheese, so I asked our server if we can order plain grits. She advised that  the goat cheese tang is really subtle and promptly brought us a sample. She was right!  Imagine me the goat cheese hater ordering them!  They were creamy and cheesy, and very well seasoned.

The kid ordered the French toast. It was thick slices of fluffy challa bread, lightly dusted with confectioners sugar. So good!  The peppered bacon on the side was done perfectly. I ordered the southern poutine scramble - eggs, bacon and potatoes with gravy on top. Very yummy!  Hubby had the sweet potato pancake, which comes with fried chicken on top. The chicken was a little dry, but fried well. The pancake was sweet - almost pumpkin tasting, which was wonderful. 

You get a LOT of food for the price. Be prepared for a nap.  We'd definitely return when in the area again."}
{"text":"Even though the Queen's Bloody Mary is pretty great - think infused vodka, bacon, pimento cheese olives - I have to give this place 2 stars.  I liked their former menu way better.

Their biscuits will always be pretty good but I ordered the huevos rancheros, and they came out Luke warm if even that. There was an over abundance of beans in the dish and the tortillas were hard to cut through.  Wouldn't order the dish again."}
{"text":"I filled out an online survey and was awarded a \"Golden Ticket\". This is a $60 meal once a month. I make a point of trying something different every time (even though I want the crispy brussels sprouts every time!) I stopped by last night and they are debuting a new menu. The cauliflower and carrots with butter milk drizzle is awesome! I could've eaten a large bowl and called it dinner. I followed that with a flat iron steak/honey Brussels sprouts and hominy/fingerling potatoes. The horseradish is a VERY prominent flavor in this dish, maybe a little more than I wanted or needed. But everyone has a different palate. I look forward to trying something else next month. I am never disappointed at Tupelo Honey."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Tupelo last weekend for the first time and had the best service I have ever had at any restaurant from 2 great lady's.   Ones name was Haley who is the manager and made us feel like we were the only table in the restaurant and the other was the bartender who had red hair but I don't remember her name. Very respectful and customer service was at 100%.   My husband loves the bourbon she recommended and we  will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"I had such high expectations as to what I was going to expect about this restaurant. I came for dinner and I ordered the fried green tomatoes which were good however I did not like the goat cheese grits that were served underneath the tomatoes. Was disappointed but still had high expectations for the main course. I got the sweet potato pancakes with fried chicken and let me just tell you boy will I not be back. The chicken was so dry you practically could choke on it. The pancakes however were good and the rosemary peach lemonade. If you ever do decide to come here it would be wise to only come for the drinks because they are delicious."}
{"text":"I like it! Small menu choice - but all very good choices.  If you're looking for a different food experience this place is a good one to go to.  The freshly baked rolls with honey they give you in the very beginning are the best.  Friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"Nothing terrible, nothing great.

It was hard to find anything on the menu I wanted to order, though. 
We settled on a fried green tomato app to share. This is a very generous portion, served on grits. The grits were good, the tomatoes unfortunately only tasted like the heavy breading. To their credit, the best fried green tomatoes are had in tomato season- otherwise  you cannot get the tart bite they should have. 
My friend ordered the trout. Yukon gold mashed that were greenish...?
My beet salad was - meh. 
I had brunch here once before though, and it was very good.
Our server was attentive and so pleasant, she really earned a star on her own.
This is a good place to take your older relatives who come to town to visit, or for people who aren't up for some of the edgier places that are opening up. Or probably stick to going for brunch."}
{"text":"Food was really good. However, I took a star away because the hostess was really rude and unaccommodating."}
{"text":"Glad this was not our 1st Tupelo experience. This particular restaurant seemed not to care about the cleanness or quality of its food and restaurant. The bar area was dirty. Glasses were piled up and oranges that had been zested sat next to personal binders on countertop. The bar tender never cleared away plates. Another worker who was in restroom with me left her stall with toilet paper on floor. Empty rolls on floor and toilet paper holder was broken. Didn't even bother trying to pick it up. 
Food- blueberry jam was cold and dry. The grit croutons were not impressive. My salmon with the glaze was not good. Drenched in glaze (which wasn't good in the first place). My two sides weren't as good as another Tupelo's I've been to in another state."}
{"text":"We started with the rosemary peach lemonade. It's tart and delicious and I definitely recommend it.  We had the onion bisque.  It was cream based, pretty tasty but needed extra salt.

If you go to Tupelo Honey, you've got to try the southern fried chicken BLT.  It's perhaps the best chicken sandwich I have ever had.  WOW WOW WOW.  It's delicious and HUGE.  The scald on the chicken is perfect for this sandwich.  The chicken is really juicy and delicious, and the rest of the sandwich went very well.  I've been to THC numerous times and this is the best thing I've ever had here.  Fried okra on the side was only ok, could be dressed up a bit.  I usually get the eggs Betty on a biscuit (HOLY MOTHER this is a delicious breakfast, and with two biscuits total, you are happy to carry your food baby home afterwards).

We got the veggie melt too. Just ok because there was way too much white sauce, and it just seemed uninspired next to the chicken masterpiece.  I've had this one at THC, I have recommended it to vegetarians and heard very positive reviews, and I've enjoyed the veggie melt myself, but much better at the downtown asheville location.

Overall though everything was delicious.  The biscuit they bring you is great, with the honey and jam.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Whats not to love!?  Parking was always a pain, but they offer valet...they take reservations if you plan ahead and the food is always yummy!"}
{"text":"Awesome place with honest staff!  Food was great, service awesome, left my wallet (with 200$ in it) cause I'm add.  They facebooked me, and called my work.  Good food, good service, great people Mike the mgr, and Vanessa the host were great!!"}
{"text":"William was bomb.com. He was helpful, made good suggestions, and was so nice. We enjoyed our experience!"}
{"text":"This place awesome! Fresh biscuits are served to nibble on before the meal (even at lunch).  I had the onion bisque and pecan-crusted goat cheese app. Both were totally amazing. The service was great too! Our server was super friendly and efficient. I Highly recommend Tupelo Honey!"}
{"text":"For the prices and the cuisine's potential, I should be able to give TH 4 to 5 stars, but instead I'm giving a 2.5. We've been to TH 2x now, once for dinner and once for brunch and both times they've missed the mark. 

First off I'd like to say that the ambiance is charming and the waitstaff are generally friendly. It is absolutely a comfortable place to dine. Conceptually, TH is right up our alley; creative dishes, locally sourced ingredients...a nice twist on low country cuisine. They use fresh ingredients of good quality. However, someone in the kitchen is not consistently executing the recipes well at all.

Some items are reliably good, like the buttery biscuits. And sometimes the quality of the paired ingredients makes up for the fact that they're paired in a heavy handed way but a chef of questionable skill level, but only sometimes.

At our dinner, we had a fish entree that was fantastic in terms of freshness of the meat (tasted clean, pleasing...not fishy) but we had to send our salad back as the greens were actually dripping (and wilted by) an obscene amount of really strong sour tasting dressing. It was odd, as if a 5 year old had dressed our salad.

Our other entree and sides were memorable only for their saltiness. The small plates were good.

For our brunch, we had a couple nice appetizers/small plates (cinnamon bun - again, TH seems to do better with baked goods) and a couple disappointing entrees. The giant grit caked topped with salmon was good (ingredient-wise) but there were some serious flaws in construction. If you're going to top anything with a large quantity of smoked salmon like that you've got to make sure the salmon is not 50% gristle. The act of having to forcefully yank what appear to be tendons out of the meat in my entree does nothing good for my appetite. There's an art to cutting meat and fish; true chefs know how to cut along the grain and remove less desirable parts (tendons, veins, other connective tissues/fascia, excessive amnts. of fat, and so on). Plus, with that much salmon and grit cake you've got to give more than a teaspoon's worth of sour cream/creme fraiche and a couple slivers of julienned onions. I wasn't thrilled with the fact that I had to request more sour cream and then was charged for it. The recipe was not executed correctly...don't punish the diner :/

Our eggs and pork belly were not good at all...there wasn't much pork (about 6 pieces, each less than 1\" x 1\"). The pork, onion, and potatoes were all fried in the same pan rendering the dish homogeneous in taste and appearance and very oily. 

In sum, for the price I'm not in any hurry to go back to TH. I want every single thing I order to be done correctly. I think this place would be great if they hired a new head chef and took a close look at some of the prep cooks/sous chefs. Keep the menu as is. Keep getting the ingredients from the same resources. Just get a new chef - one who can execute these dishes properly.

Until that change occurs, go to TH for their baked goods, small plates, and drinks."}
{"text":"Had my birthday brunch here and the drinks and food were amazing! So much food we couldn't even finish it all and not to mention amazing service from our waiter William!!!"}
{"text":"Everyone rants and raves about this place but I find it to be ok. The service was fine but for it to be a place for \"southern comfort food,\" it somewhat lacked. My bf that is from South Carolina was really excited about trying this place but we both felt like it feel short. The Fried Green Tomatoes lacked seasoning and soul. My french toast was really not that great. I feel like this place is also a little overpriced for the quality of food that they serve."}
{"text":"Great spot to check out! 

-Atmosphere: Excellent! The design and feel of the place is well done. 
-The staff: Nice job guys! Staff was friendly, attentive, and entertaining.
-The Food: Delicious! It was fresh and noticed the difference in ingredient quality. The biscuits are amazing.

The reason for 4 stars is the price. It's just a little too high and keeps me from being a regular."}
{"text":"Stopped in recently and had a great time, mostly thanks to our waitress Karlee - she's so much fun.  She helped us choose some truly excellent food. Believe me the steak is worth it.   Will be back soon."}
{"text":"Great service!!! The food was sub par for sure. I had the chicken saltimbocca, others had the blackened catfish the tupelo burger and the sassy chicken. The seasoning is none existent on all of the above mentioned dishes. If light seasoning is what you like give this place a try. The egg roll appetizer was entertaining but the fried green tomatoes were forgettable. Definitely not a good choice for my last night in Charlotte, NC."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch. Nice exterior seating and inside it's cool how you can see and hear a bit of the kitchen action but it's not too loud. The bbq grilled cheese was awesome. The dark colored bread was crunchy to balance the sweet heat from the meat and cheese. Corrie was super friendly, and made it a cool experience. I tried the biscuit and jam for dessert. Amazing! Not sure if I was supposed to eat as appetizer but oh well!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came to this restaurant for a late lunch and there was barely anybody there, we were seated immediately which was great but our waitress was not as attentive as I would have liked, she came to check on us a few times but nothing special. Besides that the food was pretty good, biscuits and jam were delicious of course with the Tupelo honey! And besides my eggs being a little too runny for my taste everything was great! I would definitely come back if I'm in the area again!"}
{"text":"Brunch was great...  Not a huge fan of the golden Bloody Mary, but more of a tease preference...  Long wait, so go early. Would love a call ahead seating arrange,net with them!"}
{"text":"Every time I've given this place another chance, it's worse than the time before. There were 5 of us and we all ordered something different, and everything was just okay. It didn't help that we waited for over AN HOUR for our food to arrive."}
{"text":"As we are new to Charlotte, NC and in the process of setting up our new Vacation house, we Yelped our way to the Tupelo Honey Cafe for breakfast.  

Our waitress, Carly was beyond helpful and kind.  As New Yorkers coming to the South, we needed some of the menu items explained to us and wanted to know more about the preserves.  Carly brought us two warm biscuits with Blueberry preserves on the side.  We were in biscuit heaven!  We would come back just to see Carly.  Oh and did I mention how good the food was?  It definitely was great and plenty of it.

Then if our first experience there was not enough fun, before I knew it, Tupelo's Manager, Tiara walked up to our booth and slid right on in next to me to ask us about our first experience there.  Well!!  We ended up talking and laughing with her for almost an hour  Funny, outspoken and dynamic, well suited for her role in management and training of new staff.  

We left after big hugs well fed and happy!

We shall return!!

Linda and Anthony"}
{"text":"I would give this location a one but, I don't want to dissuade people from trying other locations-I have had nice experiences at both the Ashville, NC and Greenville, Sc restaurants  

It was a very disorganized mob scene and they honored our reservation after a 20 minute wait. As Jerry Seinfeld says\" anyone can take reservations, it is the holding that counts\". 

Sat at our table another full hour without being served our main course. Eggs and grits-not complex! The waiter just kept telling us that Sunday brunch is always slammed. So my advise is don't go on Sunday morning. 

My food was so, so-I was beyond hungry by then and my sons eggs were cold-how did they manage delayed service and cold food?

On second floor, steep stair walk up and available elevator near street. Adequate parking lot, casual dress, prices are average, and full bar."}
{"text":"I remember when this place was The Pewter Rose!  The decor is less \"earthy\" in a good way.  The wait times have never been exorbitant for us as we seem to have a knack for getting there at the right time.  The negative that we have encountered was a not-so-subtle reminder to \"move out.\"  There was no one waiting to be seated and my group was just enjoying our conversation.  The food is so \"sublimely good!\" The bacon is so mouth-watering!  The brunch menu is perfect.  Having Jack Sparrow floating around is a plus!!!!"}
{"text":"I used to work in Asheville several days a week loved Tupelo Honey (both the downtown and Hendersonville Rd locations) and was really excited when it came to Charlotte, but consistently the ambiance and service are not the same. I can't put my finger on the difference, but it's disappointing. The drinks, beer selection and wine list are good and pricing is consistent with similar Charlotte restaurants, but for me, it's worth the 3 hour trip to Asheville to eat at the original."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 4 stars for now bc our main entrees came out wrong and then when they came back my fried egg blt was mediocre, it was missing the jalapeno aioli and the bacon was semi cooked . I ended up sending my sandwich back and the waitress was super attentive she had the general manager greet us . The General manager was very apologetic stating their quality is not usually rushed and paid for our entire meal asking us to come back to receive a better experience, I would've come back anyway because the Mac and cheese was delicious as well as the free biscuits. It's always a plus when the establishment values their customer's opinions ."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  We had a chance to try Tupelo Honey for breakfast one Saturday, and here a few early observations: 
- Pewter Rose's former location has lost a bit of its former charm with TH's reconfiguration.  Tables are fitted closely together in the former bar area, and it's pretty noisy when full.  We can't wait to try dining outside when it gets warmer, where it's more comfortable and likely less noisy. 
- They now have an elevator for easier accessibility to the second floor.  How awesome is that?!
- The biscuits with homemade blueberry jam you get before your meal are the best we've ever had.  We'll have to try them with gravy the next time!
- Their menu has plenty of options, and they'll even allow some substitutions for picky eaters.  For example, goat cheese grits are one of their sides, but you can substitute plain grits or any other cheese in your grits (such as cheddar or havarti).
- Their \"meat pies\" are delicious little quiches with loads of flavor.  I just wish there were more options than just one version each of their meat and veggie pies.  Plus, the meat one has cheese, but the veggie one does not.  
- Prices are a bit on the high end for breakfast.  For example, both of our entrees (meat pie and breakfast bowl) were $9.95. 
- Their coffee is also expensive and could be much stronger!  Or, at least offer espresso as an option.
- Our server was just super - friendly, helpful, and attentive.  We hope that's a sign of the quality of their wait staff! 

TH competes well against Zada Jane's for breakfast, with the exception of their worse than average coffee.  We'll definitely be back, just not as frequently as we dine at Zada's."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for dinner as it appeared to have more veggie options for my friend. We were immediately seated and offered their complimentary biscuits while we looked over the menu. The biscuits were light and fluffy in taste and came with what appeared to be blackberry jam. It may have had some cracked black pepper on the top as well. 

I ordered the Southern fried chicken BLT and fries while she ordered their  black bean burger. I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich and even tried some of her black bean burger as a meat eater the texture was off for me but it was seasoned extremely well. She also ordered one of their margaritas, I opted for a local brew. The service was superb, we were checked on often throughout the night. The location is great and I can't wait to use the outdoor seating that looked extremely comfy. Also the elevator was a great addition after a night of drinks. great job there. Will definitely be back, two thumbs up over here."}
{"text":"WOW. My childhood friend, who lives in the Charlotte area, took me here for brunch while I was visiting. She has been here a few times now and swore I would love it here and she was right, I did! I ordered the banana pudding pancakes and she ordered the eggs Betty. There were a couple items on the menu I was thinking of ordering but I'm so glad I went with these pancakes! For those with a sweet tooth, these pancakes are for you! They were covered in pudding, bananas, and a very sweet sugary rum sauce they called it. These pancakes were very filling and I could not finish them all even though I wanted to! The portions are huge! My friend did not finish all of her plate either. We also ordered a side of grits (they were awesome), and mimosas, which were also really decently sized! In my opinion, this place is a bit on the pricey side. However, the food is really good and the portions are huge so I'd say it's worth it! 

The atmosphere of this place was great. They had a few different seating areas inside, a bar, and outdoor seating. It was a pretty large space and the place was packed for their Saturday brunch time. We did not make a reservation and waited at the bar for maybe 10-15 minutes for a table to be ready. 
Our waitress was super nice and helpful with the menu. The bathrooms were clean. And the decor in this place is awesome! It's got a trendy rustic vibe to it! 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great brunch spot!"}
{"text":"First impressions mean a lot. This restaurant went above and beyond. Our server was patient with our group agonizing over the menu and was very knowledgeable in her suggestions. While the Benedict I ordered was great, the fried green tomatoes were the best I have EVER had. I would literally drive the 2 hours right now to eat those again!"}
{"text":"When this place first opened I went allllll the time - it was great. But my last few visits have been subpar at best. The service isn't as good, and the food isn't either - not sure if it's menu changes or the actual food, but I've determined that I might as well quit trying and go to some other places around."}
{"text":"This is a must go! Food tasted fresh and and homemade. They give you a biscuit to start on before your order comes and it was delicious. Really
Cool atmosphere and decor. We waited about 20 minutes to be seated but the wait was so worth it! I recommend this place if you want true comfort food...be prepared to feel
Stuffed!"}
{"text":"Tupelo falls somewhere in the zone of 2-3 stars. I am giving a bonus star because they are accommodating towards folks with Celiac Disease and have a good range of gluten-free options for my friends. I've eaten at Tupelo twice for dinner; once in the Knoxville location and once in Charlotte. My meals were unremarkable at both locations. 

I've tried the shrimp and grits as well as the buttermilk fried chicken. Both were just okay, and truthfully not worth writing about. I personally found the freebie biscuit to be overly salty and reminiscent of the biscuits served at Red Lobster. I haven't tried any of the cocktails, but with restaurants situated in locations with great beer culture, I would expect for more draft options. The food quality definitely speaks to that of a chain restaurant, which it is."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. This place is amazing if your looking for southern food. The biscuits are simply the best. I had the sweet potato pancake with the fried chicken. The friend chicken was the juiciest chicken I've ever had. Muy bien!!"}
{"text":"Vegetarian and GF friendly. They do have vegan options you just need to pick around the menu. The Grateful Dead burger contains eggs, so watch out! Apart from that; excellent food, great service and trendy atmosphere. The plates average about $8 a piece but are well worth it. Each dish is hand made with love and care and you can see them preparing you meal, no hidden kitchen. If we are ever in North Carolina again we look forward to eating here again."}
{"text":"10/10 WOULD RECOMMEND!!

If you don't visit Tupelo Honey at least once in your life you are seriously missing out. My wife and I had brunch at the Charlotte location and it was amazing. The food was delicious and very well presented, not to mention the superb and fast service. There was an hour wait... But I would easily wait 3 hours to eat at this restaurant. Make it a point to try this place out ASAP!!"}
{"text":"Well I finally made it to Tupelo Honey Cafe today.....and it was a great experience! Our server....Jonathan....was so awesome that I told him I was gonna kiss him in the mouth and that he was my new BFF! Obviously I did NOT kiss him but I thoroughly enjoyed the level of customer service. He was knowledgable about all the food which was helpful to first timers like my friend and I. He answered all questions with a smile and even laughed when I said I was going to kiss him. He made it an enjoyable experience. 

Now. To the food. We started with the biscuit and their blueberry jam. It was delicious. It was just the right amount of tart and the scratch made biscuit was heavenly. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich with BLT and I added avocado. They offered djionnaise but I'm not a fan of Dijon so I went with straight mayo. I wanted the fries but they're seasoned, which I dislike, so I ordered the Mac n cheese on the side. I thought it was good but I wasn't blown away by it. With all the layers of flavor that it supposedly had,  the jalapeño was the most pronounced. The chicken was crispy and the avocado added just the right amount of fat. The tomato added some nice freshness and the bacon added a bit of hickory taste. My friend ordered the sweet potato pancake with the fried chicken and said she enjoyed it but that the sweet potato flavor became real strong after awhile.  

Overall a wonderful experience and we will be back soon."}
{"text":"After much anticipation we finally made time to have a family brunch at Tupelo Honey with our three children.  It was an outstanding place for brunch.  We enjoyed the mix on the menu.   The fried green tomatoes with grits and roasted red pepper and fresh basil was a great twist on these southern staples. The kids menu went beyond the usual offering and their food was devoured.   A shout out to our waiter William who was great with the kids and took wonderful care of us.  I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"A month on a southern roadtrip and we out this in a solid to five! Ordered the southern fried chicken with a side of Brussel sprouts and the kale cabbage salad with lime vinaigrette and it was absolutely dreamy! I can't recommend the Fried Chicken highly enough it will truly be the highlight of your year! Had great service and sat on the outside patio which was comfortable even though the temps are well above 90."}
{"text":"We have been here several times for brunch and usually good. We decided to try dinner and it was awful! They sat us in the bar side and it was freezing, even my husband was cold. The waitress was ok but never really seemed to check back and took forever to get our bill. Food was terrible. Fried green tomatoes would have been good but the grits were cold and the tomatoes Luke warm. Biscuits were cold and tasted stale. I got fried chicken and it was soggy not crispy and the Mac and cheese was dry. Husband got the ribs and they were ok not extremely tender. I heard others complain about food not being hot. We should have said something but we wanted to get out of there as it overall was poor. They should have noticed when we had half our plates not touched and didn't want a box...Definitely won't come back for dinner... maybe will try brunch again when it's so busy food has to be hot."}
{"text":"What a great place! My favorite will always be the sweet potato pancakes and fried chicken! If you go on a Sunday be prepared to wait around 45 min to 1 hour. Kind of pricey but still good."}
{"text":"Biscuits and jam. 'Enough said. You get these served complimentary after you order. Delightfully fluffy yet filling in every bit. The jam will coat your teeth, it is so sugary sweet but tart! If ordering brunch I recommend switching out the home fries (which are delicious) for the sliced tomatoes (even more delicious) but a healthier choice. Perfect amount of food if you make this swap, otherwise you won't need to eat the rest of the day. Parking can be a pain if you go during Sunday or Saturday brunch, just go slow and be patient, you'll find a spot. Line always moves quicker then they say it will."}
{"text":"This was a great find for a relaxing atmosphere, great wine and fabulous food. I've now gone 2 nights with different BFF's and One word each time \"Fabulous\". You can't go wrong with this restaurant and the customer service is spot on. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience today and will not be returning. By the end of our meal the waitress was pleading with us to \"give them another chance.\" There are no other chances in Charlotte. There are so many other great restaurants in this town where I'd rather spend my money. I had a reservation for 8 at 1:00 pm Sunday January 14, 2018. This is how it went down: 1:00 pm we arrive with our entire party. Check in to find out they are running 15-20 minutes behind. No problem... until... 1:30 Still no table. Check back in with the hostess. \"We're cleaning your table off right now.\" 1:40 Still no table. BS. We get drinks at the bar. (The only good part of the experience.) 1:45 They finally seat us... 45 minutes after our reservation time! As we are seated they comp our group 2 appetizers. Nice try... but wait... the suck continues. 2:00 PM We wait another 15 minutes for a waitress to take our drink order. She finally arrives and takes our drink order, and we didn't waste the opportunity to give her our app and main order. Who knows when she would be back... right? 2:15 PM No apps yet. Everyone is ravenous. 2:30 PM The food comes out... but NO APPETIZERS. Yes, the two apps you comped us never come out! Really? Everyone is served at the same time except for one person. 2:40 PM The same person has no meal while everyone else is eating. Now it's time to have a talk with the manager. He apologizes... and takes 50% off the meal (except alcohol) and throws in dessert. 2:45 PM the final meal comes out. The food is ok... 3:00 PM Strap in people... we ordered dessert. 3:30 PM Dear God... the desserts finally make the table, and they are freaking small. I mean a $9 cake is really a dense muffin. Jeez. 3:50 PM We get our checks. 4:05 We get our receipts and leave. Are you keeping score at home? 3 hours for a meal, people. Never again."}
{"text":"Listen get my mama on the phone and send her an e-vite because I owe her a slap after eating this food! They have so much variety on the menu here. I had never heard of this place but I've been Yelpin... (watermelon) and trying new stuff. It's a little pricey but worth it. You get a lot of food too. 

Their collard greens and mac' n cheese were FIYA. And their servers are as attentive as Mr. Meeseeks when it comes to attending to your needs. I'll definitely be back. 

The entrance is a little weird as it's upstairs or you have to take an elevator up one flight to sort of find the lobby. Other than that it's a great spot.

Kaepernick is right to take a knee. Don't be mad at him for the truth!"}
{"text":"Expensive. Service awesome. Very silent/soft music, feel so peaceful. Food great. I had friend chicken sandwich sides with crackin potato. I am not big fan of fries, I asked for crackin potato instead. Of course before they served my food, they provide some biscuit, blueberry jam from starch (i dont like blueberry) and honey. Biscuit was very warm and fresh. 
Worth it for our price. Yes, I will definitely come back as well."}
{"text":"I could NOT wait to try out the new Tupelo Honey location in Charlotte.  Because I always worry about the new kinks of a place, and bad impressions, I decided to wait until they were open for a while... or like 3.5 weeks haha ( I could not help myself) Anyway- went yesterday for brunch with my mother and boyfriend.  Went at 11 on a Sunday ( worst move ever) and the wait was about 1.5 hrs... Food was DELISH- I was worried it might not live up to my experiences in Asheville, but surely it did!  Decor is perfect, and service...welllll the service needs a little help but nothing we didn't understand, after all, it was busy enough in there to have a 1.5hr wait!!"}
{"text":"We had a WONDERFUL brunch here!  Drinks, food, service (by Jonathan)  all get 5 stars from us!! If you go to the one in Charlotte ask for him and order a sweet potato pancake! ! Also try the moonswine  bloody mary and mimosa!"}
{"text":"LOVE! Food was absolutely amazing. Fun vibe and service was excellent. Will definitely be back for brunch."}
{"text":"Pretty good place when you're looking to feel extra southern.  The service is great and they do a great job of putting a nice spin on traditional southern dishes.  During my visit I had the fried chicken and it was delicious.  They do have a different menu for lunch and dinner so, I can't wait to see what the dinner menu looks like!"}
{"text":"Review Update: I really hate to leave this, but I had another bad experience here!! I was looking forward to trying the new menu.  We came on a Saturday night, it was packed! We arrived at about 7:30 and was told the wait was 45 minutes, which it was.  The waitress that took our order was very nice.  She brought out drinks and we ordered our food right away. 

So an hour passes and at first I thought because it was busy, but we only ordered two tacos, a side of fries and the scallop entree.  I asked if they knew how much longer it would be because no one came to our table or said anything.  Come to find out, our ticket was lost.  I understand things get busy, but the waitress should've been aware that we still didn't have food and done something sooner. 

My scallops were cold in the middle and I decided I didn't want to order anything else because we had other plans to get to. We ended up leaving a little after 10PM. 

The taco I had was really good. It was the pork.  They come on corn tortillas, which aren't my favorite, but I was surprised to enjoy it a lot anyway. I would order that again if I ever make I back."}
{"text":"HOT HONEY!

Food was excellent! But I didn't bury the lead. The hot honey was a show stopper. I poured some on top of my pancakes with fried chicken and was not disappointed.

Once we were seated the biscuit and jam starter given to the table was a nice touch!"}
{"text":"My hubby & I went to one of my favs in Charlotte esp when we can't make up our minds between lunch or breakfast since we were smack dab in the middle of the two times sooo here we go to Tupelo..can't go wrong.

We were right..we chose a booth but requested another  booth by the window b/c the temp was muy frio..burrr..so Jonathan cleared the new table for us & whisked us away into supremo excellente personalized service at every turn..yes I said every encounter!  He was courteous, funny and did I mention knowledgeable of the entire menu..btw which had some new items on it & made us aware of a specific a la carte item that some customers had mistaken as coming with a side dish..can you say on top of his game. To top it off when my hubby asked if they had rye/wheat toast--which they didn't Jonathan told him they only have sourdough but immediately rattled off some good alternatives so my hubby went for the potato cracklings..hello delicious crunchy flavorful carb delights.

Jonathan you are the #Man.  We will request you each time we come back to one of my favs in Charlotte..Tupelo Honey Cafe & ask for our fav waiter..\"Jonathan\""}
{"text":"First time to charlotte and went as a recommendation. We sat outside. Biscuits with the honey and blueberry compote were literally clouds of heaven. We then had the fried green tomatoes that came over creamy grits with a red pepper sauce. They were the best i have ever had. They still had some crunch. I had the steak salad that included white balsamic, green beans, fingerling potatoes and a delicious marinated steak cooked to perfection and the boyfriend had a pulled pork grilled cheese with cranberry compote with the baked Mac and cheese. Complete with friendly service..... we will be back again before we leave Charlotte. Amazing amazing amazing!"}
{"text":"So disappointing, this was one of our favorite go to special occasion restaurants, but they need to take note and go back to the way things were in the original location in Asheville, local good quality and value food. Unfortunately we were told they have changed the menu and food buyers, poor quality not even close to southern taste! We won't be returning.."}
{"text":"We were visiting Charlotte from Baltimore for a girls weekend. We decided to have Brunch at Tupelo Honey before heading back home. We were greeted with southern hospitality at the door.  We had a large party but we had a reservation so there was no wait for us. We were seated immediately. Our waitress was Kayla. She was excellent. She was knowledgeable about the menu and when we asked she gave recommendations. The complimentary biscuits and homemade sauce were delicious. I ordered the fried okra, the shrimp and grits and a mega mimosa. The shrimp and grits were so full of flavor that no additional salt, pepper or butter was needed. The fried okra was seasoned very well.  The mimosa could have used a little more orange juice to sweeten it but it was enjoyable. The manager came out and greeted us because we were celebrating 2 friends and she was very friendly with a bubbly welcoming personality. Without us even asking the checks were separated and we cashed out quick and easy. I even bought some honey to take home. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved to the Charlotte/South End area and used Yelp to find a good place to sit down and eat. Tupelo was one of the top rated places and near our new home. 

Coming from Connecticut, we were looking for some southern style cooking and a fun atmosphere....needless to say we were not disappointed. 

The restaurant is decorated in a shabby chic style with distressed windows and doors hanging from the ceiling and had a very fun feel to it. The wait staff was so friendly and engaged in conversations about our move and were genuinely excited to have us there -- a big change from the New England style hospitality. 

The food was absolutely delicious. The meal came with complimentary southern biscuits and blueberry jam which melted in our mouths, YUM! we also ordered the fried okra - not knowing what it was but at the suggestion of our waiter for a true southern experience. Also delicious. We both got the onion soup paired with a sandwich. I had the Uptown grill and my husband had the Shoo grilled cheese. We both loved our meal so much that we immediately decided this was going to be a regular place and a place to bring our families when they come visit.

WE ARE STILL THINKING ABOUT OUR MEAL....Two days later.

EAT HERE."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place!  The ambiance is relaxed country. The food had a lot of flavor and there was plenty of it!  It is on second floor of the building,so that was a little odd.  Just follow the signs.  A thousand doors along the front wall so finding the right one to enter was also a little awkward but worth it when you get in!  Surprised how big it is inside not just a little hole in the wall!  Very clean.  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I love the menu at Tupelo Honey Cafe. I live nearby and would love to carry out, but it's impossible to do. They don't do carryout. The restaurant is located by a train stop and on the walking/bike path and has hundreds of apartments within walking distance. Love the food but not a fan of this management decision."}
{"text":"While my overall rating remains the same, sadly it's my belief that Tupelo Honey is on the decline. I ate here on a Friday for lunch. I texted my order to my guy since I was arriving later than him and requested \"Shoo mercy shrimp and grits\". He showed it to the waitress. What I didn't know is that Tupelo is now offering less for more. So the \"shoo mercy\" version with spinach, mushroom, good sauce, bacon, and peppers is no longer. In its place are shrimp & grits with chorizo, sauce, and that's about it. VERY disappointing, especially considering the cost is what it was when it was filled with goodness. $21.00 My peach lemonade was delicious. 

Chefs reimagining a restaurant's most popular dishes is a trick of the enemy. A wise man once said, \"If it aint broke, don't fix it.\"  Take heed and thrive."}
{"text":"Went for early Mother's Day Brunch experience as always. Kimberly was the best, great personality, super accommodating. Don't miss the fried green tomatoes or their amazing stone ground grits!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this restaurant. I ordered the crab cake Benedict. It was the most bland crab cake Benedict I've ever ordered. What makes it qualify as crab cake is the tiniest sprinkle of what I am sure is canned crab (or possibly imitation crab) onto the top of the egg. Hollandaise sauce has no flavor, just yellow tinged mayonnaise. I've included a picture. My boyfriend was unimpressed with his omelette. The best part were the biscuits that were just....okay. I guess since they are a chain people just come there for that reason and they don't feel like they need to do well when it comes to the appearance and taste of their food. I expected great food and I expected to see the atmosphere as shown in the pictures. The place is cute but they do not serve your food on nice plates. Your food will be plated on an ugly yellow cafeteria looking plate. Maybe I'm just spoiled with all the truly amazing food options Charlotte has to offer. Tupelo honey is another Olive Garden, Chili's and Red Lobster. And those might be better. If you want amazing food and a nice atmosphere, try Fahrenheit or The Village Tavern, Dressler's. The last two mentioned have amazing food and all three have very nice outdoor seating areas. You won't be disappointed like you will be here. I've included a picture of my egg Benedict....I mean \"crab\" cake Benedict."}
{"text":"This was my first stop when coming to Charlotte. Yelp rated it highly so i checked it out. Southern soul food with a twist. I got sweet potato pancakes and fried chicken. It was great! Our server was Alec. He couldn't have been more helpful. This is a great place to go in Charlotte."}
{"text":"My brunch bae and I last minute decided to spend our Easter morning here. It was our first time in Tupelo, and it won't be our last. 

We were so in love with the menu choices, the background music and the no-wait time that we couldn't decide on what to eat. Our waitress gave great selections. We ended up starting with the \"Avocado Crostini\". The bread wasn't the best, the red chili infused honey on top was the real winner of the small plate. 

For my actual meal I had the Southern Fried Chicken BLT. It comes with a fried chicken breast (mine ended up being shaped like a heart and I'm still not over how precious it was), a slice of tomato, a lettuce leaf and a dijonnaise sauce. Needless to say it was perfect in every single way possible. As my side I chose the MAC AND CHEESE AND THIS IS IN ALL CAPS BECAUSE IT WAS A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE. 

Service can move a little slow, and you should remember that you cannot order an alcoholic beverage until noon, but as soon as someone starts ringing a bell yelling about Bloody Marys, order a round of Cast Iron Mac&Cheese and grab some brunch-time dranks. It'll be the best."}
{"text":"With out-of-towners wanting a \"southern experience\" we decided Tupelo would be the best spot for a Saturday brunch. We had reservations for 11, and they were really cool when we had to call because our uber got lost and we were going to be late. We were seated immediately and drinks were taken promptly. Our friend ordered the massive Bloody Mary and was very impressed by it. The mimosas were standard, with pulpy OJ. The only drink letdown was the margarita, which was 99% sour mix. 

As for the food, some of the brunch price points are a little high, but you do get a generous portion of food. Everyone loved their complimentary biscuits and there were no complaints to be had with the food! The flannel hash was my choice, and it certainly kept me full for the whole day. The avacado toast was another clear winner at the table, along with the French toast.  

Definitely a place to take guests, or for a special occasion, or for just a decadent brunch."}
{"text":"Everything is so yummy! Great southern food with an exceptional atmosphere. Wait staff is always superb!"}
{"text":"I so badly want to like Tupelo Honey but the last few times I've visited the food has been greasy and lacking flavor and seasoning (I guess if you are suffering from a hangover this might be the place to go...) I have been to their Asheville location and loved it, but this South End spot seems to be lacking something.   As much as I want to add it to my list of go to brunch spots it's just not earning it.  

The pros - portions are big, so there is ok value for the price, including the drinks.  I had to take a nap after one mimosa!  
The Cons - the food just doesn't do it for me and the wait can be long.  

I'm sure I'll give it another try at some point, and will update the review if things change, but for now, it has left me wanting..."}
{"text":"Love this place! Not the healthiest but it has great southern comfort food with a twist. The biscuits that you get with every meal are fabulous! The southern chicken piccata with jumbo shrimp is also good. The staff are really friendly!"}
{"text":"This was a save after flying in from out of the country and not being able to eat all day from close connections on our flights.  I was so happy they did take out as we wouldn't have had time to go sit down because they were closing but they packed up our to go food and we ate it in the car on the way home.   This is the best southern style food I've had in a long time the fried chicken is so good and the mashed potatoes and beans with that were perfect and such a great welcome to the south, tasted like home!  We also had the crispy Brussels the Mac and cheese and the fried avocado.  It was a ton of food and our bill wasn't even that high so it was a great value for all that we got and it was really so good.  thank you Tupelo Honey."}
{"text":"I was very unhappy with my pork belly hash. It was $15 for a fried potato and very few tiny pieces of pork belly. It almost felt like they forgot to put some in until I found very very tiny pieces like five total and they were the size of your finger nails

I was deciding between that or the French toast I wish I got the French toast but I feel like the amount of pork belly would still be equally disappointing

My boyfriend however really liked his pancakes eggs and bacon!

The service was great. Five stars service for sure all around! I would like to add that Lauren at the bar was very nice I needed a bandaid for my cut but there were none left under the cash register but she went to get me one from her own purse! I thought that was very kind."}
{"text":"Forgettable.  Wife and I had lunch here.  We went in with high hopes.  The service was not bad, but poor.  We asked for the same items more than once, he said he was going to bring us biscuits and apple butter but never did and he was not at all concerned when neither of us ate more than1/2 our entrees and did not want a box.   We even told him the food was not to our liking and he just ignored it.   My wife had a veggie bowl, which turned out to be 50% fried okra.  I had the chicken and biscuits which was covered in obnoxiously long wide strips of fresh basil; overpowering the entire dish.  Once I took that off, I don't know if my taste buds were so tainted I could not enjoy the remaining favors or if there were not any other favors.  Not a good experience all around."}
{"text":"Great restaurant in Asheville, one of my favorite, but starting to get the same D-bag feel as the rest of south blvd...1/2 empty, but 30 min wait.  I'll stick to Flying Biscuit for brunch!"}
{"text":"Used to love it for brunch, but lately it's been a disappointment. Wrong meal, bad service, messy atmosphere, extra long waits, bad food."}
{"text":"This is the same same \"chain\" that is in Asheville. The high quality is the same but this is a larger and MUCH louder restaurant. It is a tradition to bring all my Yankee friends to Tupelo and then to the Biltmore. I thought it would be great to let them enjoy the great Southern food without having to drive 3 hours. If they are crowded, it is too loud to have a table conversation.
My favorite dish is the Fried Green Tomato BLT with sweet potato fries. 
I am not a sweets fan but I have friends who won't stop talking about the jams. I had some guests visit who are addicted.  I have to ship some \"up North\" every few months."}
{"text":"I have to say I was a little disappointed, since all the reviews show this place to be \"the place to be\"!  We made a reservation because it's always packed. Today, of course it wasn't. We were seated immediately. The atmosphere is quaint and cozy. Our server was a doll. She was new. We ordered a mimosa and a beer. She brought us out coffee and the drinks took a little longer than I would've expected for just drinks. They put fresh, hot biscuits for each on your table with blueberry preserves. The biscuits were scrumptious! If you like goat cheese, every fuckin thing here  has it in it. I, of course I  am the odd ball who doesn't. They don't sub it out because it's already made with it. However, she brought me a little to try and it was actually very subtle, warm and creamy . Quite good, I must admit.I ordered Eggs Betty (Benedict) and Frank ordered a \"Scrambled Bowl\". It looked liked eggs scrambled with Caramelized  onions, cheddar, bacon, and \"potato cracklings\".  They're potatoes that are baked, smashed, seasoned and pretty good.  It came with toast that was only toasted on one side. My guess is that they're \"toasted\" on a flat top griddle and it tasted like it. My eggs were perfectly cooked, on top of a biscuit with a thick slice of bacon that I found to be a little tough and dry. Oh and my food was COLD. I sent it back and it was taken off the bill. Manager came over, apologized, and gave us a jar of strawberry preserves on him. Overall, it was a great experience and we definitely will try it again. I know this place didn't get great reviews for nothing . WE WILL BE BACK, TUPELO! Get ready!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. I was finishing up my first weekend visiting Charlotte and I couldn't have ended it on a better note. The service was great and the food was awesome. I highly recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"I am between a three star and four star review.  It has good service and an interesting menu, but it think it's just OK.  I don't get the hype behind it, but I would be back.  It's just not my first choice of a place to go."}
{"text":"2 words \"Come Hungry\"! Dined tonight with my hubby and my mother. The waitress was extremely pleasant and knowledgeable, that none of us looked on the menu, we ordered a special because out waitress made it sound so delicious! Food came out and or eyes bulged out of our heads! Lol... the plate was piled nearly a mile high.  To say it was large portion is an understatement, and on top of that the food was amazingly fresh and delicious. OMG and they got my eggs right (soft scramble, slightly runny), nearly no one ever gets those right for me! Lol... super satisfied and full! Check this place out, you won't be disappointed! They earned and deserve all five of these stars!"}
{"text":"From out of town and ate here after the golf tournament. Absolutely one of the worst services I have received. Will never return. Waited over an hour for our food. Manager would only give us a discount when we complained. Absolutely despicable service. If I could give this a 0 stars I would."}
{"text":"We wanted the local Southern flavor before jetting back to San Diego, and boy, are we happy we came here! They greet you with a warm homemade biscuit and homemade jam while you're waiting....the environment is loud but not too loud where you're yelling at each other across the table.    The food was beyond our expectations especially when there is so much Yelp hype and you don't really know your way around the city.    We ordered the Southern style burger and the mac and cheese as a side....I only wish I had been hungrier so I could have my own entree!    The wait seems long but they have really comfy couches so you're not standing all the time and the table turning rate really is incredible.    I can't wait to visit again!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. I ordered Sunday brunch, Southern Breakfast with a mimosa. Delicious! Service was awesome."}
{"text":"Last night I attended an event and was so satisfied. I spoke with event coordinators and Gm and they provided so much insight into the business. I love the fact they are concerned with their customers and how their customers are treated when they entered the establishment. I love the décor it was dim so my food pics didn't come out as good as I wanted to.  the spicy pork sausage with red peppers was so good I mean I ate my share a well as the pimento cheese. I had the Jack punch for drink and it was well made. Tupelo and Jack Daniels event was a good time and I plan to return to venue soon. Check them out you'll love the biscuits and honey trust me."}
{"text":"We went back for the first time in a while a few weeks ago and we were a bit disappointed. I don't know if THC is just growing their business too fast to keep that special charm they had or what but it just wasn't the same. It felt more like being at nicer chain restaurant (think along the lines of Firebirds) than a Mom and Pop joint that has a couple locations run by people who came up in the original restaurant.

The food was just OK, the service was alright, my wife's drink was in a dirty glass, both of us had a chicken sandwich that was just a bit lack luster. I guess the one good thing was there was only a 10 minute wait on a Saturday at lunch hour."}
{"text":"Always came out happy from this place... The biscuits are so good and so are the burgers."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar and had great service! Food was great! Tried almost all of their appetizers - the bbq egg roll things were very good"}
{"text":"Good but no wow. 

Came here on Sunday during a pretty bad storm. The wait was the usual 20 mins. 

Our sever was nice and the food came out in the average amount of time. They gave everyone one biscuit to start with and some of their signature honey and jam. I wish they offered us more biscuits or just brought out a basket. 

I ordered the fried chicken with a side of their mac n cheese.  It also came with some of their Kale slaw. 

The fried chicken was juicy and yummy but they didn't do the skin right. It fell off the chicken as soon as you cut into it. The mac n cheese had a little bit of a kick to it but overall it was creamy and delicious. The Kale slaw was a fail. It didn't have a lot of flavor to it and also it sitting on top of the hot food, so it wilted and had a weird texture. 

Overall if I'm paying $20 to eat brunch I want a wow. The food was good but I feel like I've had a lot better for the price range."}
{"text":"Spot on for fabulous food, trendy drinks and excellent service. I will b back for sure. The menu is creative, the service from Dorian our waiter was super. The manager came to check on everything and everyone made sure it was a good dining experience. This chain is expanding for good reason. Southern food with fresh flavor...  My Southern mom would approve."}
{"text":"Yummy!!! Had the wings and they were fried properly! Drinks suck! Cute atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great atmosphere, friendly and helpful service...all around perfect brunch!"}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant based off yelp reviews. And I definitely appreciate all the Yelpers! The shrimp and grits were delicious, great flavor and seasoning. And the Biscuits... Well the Biscuits were awesome! Buttery and soft. If I lived in Charlotte it would definitely be my weekend breakfast spot. Only thing is they are very busy. We sat at the bar which had a little wait, so I'm not sure how the wait times are for tables. But still with it."}
{"text":"Love that we don't have to drive to Asheville anymore to get some of the best Southern food around. Unique flavors, excellent sides, top notch sweet tea, and great service. My only wish was that they allowed reservations for parties smaller than 8"}
{"text":"Great new addition to the charlotte restaurant scene. Tupelo honey cafe out of Asheville has a new spot in Southend that's a great option for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They have a menu full of southern favorites and a great gluten free menu as well. My husband had the grit cake appetizer and raved about it for days. I really enjoyed the grits and my poached eggs. Love that it's a very family friendly atmosphere. We'll definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give half stars because really, I would give 3.5 stars. I like this place, but it isn't a place that I crave or often choose to go to. The star of the show to me here is the home fries. I think they are awesome and really like it with the hot sauce. My boyfriend had the southern fried BLT (add pimento cheese) and it was tasty. He also liked the fries. 

I also had the sweet potato pancake. It was just okay to me. It is one giant and thick pancake, which makes it really hard to eat. I barely ate 1/3 of it because it was so massive. It was the only pancake they had on the menu, which was disappointing because I really like pancakes. 

The negatives for me about this place is that there always seems to be a wait, food can take a long time to come out because it's so busy, there isn't an extensive brunch menu (and I love brunch), and it's kinda expensive (specifically the bar drinks). 

Overall, I think this place is okay. It isn't my favorite place but I don't hate it. I think it's a decent addition to the Charlotte brunch scene."}
{"text":"Went here and loved the food. It was great and something different but fell in love with the great fresh taste."}
{"text":"I arrived to Tupelo around 3PM on a Sunday afternoon, a little bit after the brunch rush. I was a bit disappointed that despite the restaurant being heavily vacant that I was subject to wait 30 minutes for a table and more so thereafter for service. I can understand that restaurants and servers aren't fully staffed at that time vs 11AM, but it wasn't like the restaurant was closed or about to be closed.

Anyways I digress, I ordered the Avocado toast and was very pleased with the portion sizes. Everything tasted very fresh and flavorful. The location gets a lot of natural sunlight, so it's great for picture taking. The presentation was spot on.

Price-wise, the meals were right on the nose for about what you get. It's around what you expect to pay for brunch with portions around what you get. 

Great place if you can get a spot and don't mind exorbitant wait times."}
{"text":"Oh man....
This place is good if you like butter and oil and fat running through your veins..

My friend and I went for an early dinner because I wanted some biscuits!
Their biscuits definitely hit the spot and loved the jam

We both got the veggie melt because we wanted something a little lighter.. But we were misled! The veggie melt was overflowing with cheese and the bread it came w was drenched in butter/oil for sureee
I also got the sweet potato mash which was ok.

Overall, definitely a super heavy heavy meal. My friend and I felt like we had to go work out right afterwards. But a cute place with a nice homey atmosphere. Go if you don't mind some heavy heavy food."}
{"text":"Good food, best biscuits and blueberry compote. It is fairly pricey and it is very busy. My husband and I's bill for two entrees and one coffee was $38 before tip. 

Note, they do not allow substitutions with your food. I specifically came for their awesome cheese grits and my entree did not come with grits, it came with potatoes. I wanted to substitute the potatoes for grits and they said it was against kitchen regulations. The potatoes were too crunchy for my liking.  Next time I will just have to order everything off the a la carte menu."}
{"text":"Southern food with a twist, very good location and ambience! Good food and great presentation, great place for lunch or brunch"}
{"text":"This place is really good for breakfast.  I'm a huge fan of the banana pudding pancakes and the fried chicken blt sandwich.  Their bacon on this dish is exceptionally good. This place gets really packed, so it's best to make reservations.  Which is a perk because most breakfast places don't do reservations."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, great bloody Mary's and oh the biscuits!!!! love their brunch. great patio too and the staff and managers are great!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at Tupelo Honey on a Tuesday. When walking up to the restaurant's entrance, you walk past a few couches and tables that the restaurant has outdoors. These were filthy - dirt, debris, stains, etc. I would not consider sitting on those, and it made me question if I wanted to dine here.

Once inside, we were seated at a comfortable booth. The restaurant was not busy, but there were numerous tables with no people but stacked plates of food on them and trash on the floor. Yuck! 

We placed our drink orders and were soon delivered fluffy biscuits, jam, and butter. Yum!! We ordered our food and it was delicious - I had an avocado points appetizer and a wedge salad. 

The food was great, the waitress was fine, but the dirty exterior and I cleaned tables inside were not satisfactory. Maybe I caught them on an off day, so  I would return because the food was so good."}
{"text":"Tupelo Honey has great food!  The menu is very large, with so many options.  As a vegetarian though, they do put bacon/ pork fat in some foods you wouldn't expect so it's worth asking about.  This is not a diet friendly place :) 

There is a long wait for a table here, with limited waiting seat space but I've never waited more than 45 minutes on a busy day/night.  They said they were not able to accommodate my bachelorette party though.... so that was disappointing.  

Maybe the hype will wear down in a few months to lessen the wait time but the food really is good with so many unique food and cocktail options.  My husband doesn't drink blood Mary's but loves their bacon/jalapeno version.  The sweet potato pancake is about the size of a dinner plate but pretty good.  The biscuits and fresh blueberry jam are delicious!  

The only complaint I have heard people say is that the decor is slightly cafeteria looking or bland, but it doesn't take away from the tastes.  Worth checking out at some point if you haven't!"}
{"text":"We came in during a busy brunch on a Sunday. (Beware that you might have a wait due to Charlotte foodies getting out of church or locals needing to bite the hair of the dog.)
The bar is seat yourself and we were able to grab a table there while waiting. 
Our server greeted us letting us know she wanted to go home. All through our meal she wasn't tentative to little things like drinks -our coffee wasn't hot. 
The food was amazing, although it wasn't hot-hot when it was served. The parings of ingredients are great no matter what items you order. There are great spin off southern dishes that everyone should try. 
Over all the food will bring us back."}
{"text":"Can't remember what I was going to say. The Pimento cheese and chips was that good!!!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! We ended up having to wait quite a while before someone came to even take our drink orders, so ordinarily I would've knocked it down a star, but the manager noticed and came over and not only took our drink orders and actually comped a bunch of stuff for us, so back up to 5 stars. :) The food was delicious (seriously try the ham wontons!) and though it was a little loud, the atmosphere was warm and casual. We didn't get only of their Queen Mary's this time, but after seeing a few people order them, I'd say we'll definitely get it next time. Also, the portions are huge! If you're going for breakfast/brunch, get the Sweet Potato Pancake. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The menu is so inviting that I was excited to try the restaurant with some business colleagues. The service was less then impressive and our waiter seemed more engaged with other tables and not the least bit interested in tending to our drinks. The fried green tomatoes didn't have the tart zing that is typical of most fried green tomatoes and were fried to the point of being hard and dried out. The wedge salad was falling apart and the amount of chicken on the plate, that I paid extra for, was less then a half a breast."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating here,  which says something because I don't often look forward to eating at franchises. It's not that I'm against a franchise,  rather I feel that a degree of quality is lost (and complacency enters) when the executive chef is no longer present and there are different kitchen expeditors (if any.) 

I'm sure this restaurant was once great, hence the high star rating, and why I had bookmarked it. But, what it was is no longer what it is....at least not on the evening we went. To be fair, the biscuits are yummy and the fried green tomatoes are delicious.  But the entrees we ordered were not good- greasy and tasteless.  To be honest, they could have passed a blind taste test for a  Popeye's $5 meal. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Wandered in here because I was staying in the neighborhood and the menu looked amazing. I was sat by the kitchen and had the wait staff staring at me and commenting on my tattoos for my whole meal. I was alone and trying to read-- it was very uncomfortable. My waitress was so awkward... I couldn't tell if she was angry or just socially awkward. I ordered the biscuit with fried chicken and egg... She told me it was really spicy and suggested the cheese grits to help mellow it out to which I agreed. The biscuits are the best thing here. The fried chicken was soggy and dry and hardly spicy. And the grits are goat cheese which almost made me gag since it was unexpected. I paid $17 for a breakfast I ate half of as I was ogled. I don't get the hype."}
{"text":"This review is long overdue! I went to North Carolina for my birthday and a friend and I had Easter brunch here just before getting on the plane. This place was CRAZY busy, but somehow, you couldn't tell the way the staff here carried themselves and treated us. I highly recommend making a reservation and arriving hungry. 

The food was amazing and you can't go wrong with any of the crowd favorites mentioned in 99% of these reviews. I love open kitchens (those always make me feel better) and the music was indie coffehouse chill which I love for a nice meal. My friend and I could speak without yelling at each other and there were large groups all over the place that seemed to have an easy time speaking as well. 

I think I got a chance to speak with an owner or manager to help me with my check-in. She was super nice but our waitress stole the show. She was so nice, so patient and I could always see her checking on us and her other tickets constantly to make sure we were OK despite an insanely busy room. If anyone from management sees this, please feel free to message me so we can figure out her name and make sure she wins your employee competition. She deserves it!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to THC - Charlotte I was more than dissappointed having visited the original many times in Asheville. The food was lackluster and the coffee was just terrible. Yesterday, however, I am happy to say that the food was on point -delicious, the coffee was fresh and high quality, and the service was good, especially considering how busy it was. I will be back with more frequency from now on!"}
{"text":"I love Tupelo Honey!! The combination of southern traditional fare and farm to table foods is a real winner. 

The last time I went, I ordered the sweet potato pancakes with fried chicken. I thought I died and went to heaven! The food tastes light and never overwhelming, and the biscuits are to die for. Every meal is started with their fresh biscuits, locally sourced jam, and locally sourced honey. Mix it all together and you have a winning recipe."}
{"text":"Food is just ok. It seems to have a different feeling and taste compared to the Asheville location. It is overpriced for the quality. I was disappointed after taking my mom there."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff, cool atmosphere with great cocktail selections, craft beers, Bloody Mary options. All you could ask for, request Karlee for great service."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! I hade the sweet potato pancake and fried chicken. The chicken was moist on the inside, crispy on the outside and seasoned to perfection! And the pancake has a little kick to it, almost like a little spice cake. AMAZING! The manager Cedric is super friendly. Do yourself a favor and eat here! Your taste buds will thank you!"}
{"text":"We had a pretty good time here. The food was just okay though, the Mac and cheese was dry and had way too many breadcrumbs on top. The okra was small and mostly just fried crumbles. The chicken was really good, although kind of small. Biscuits were great with their homemade jam. Our favorite part of the meal was the warm pimento cheese. Absolutely amazing. My big gripe was our server. She was slow to respond to us at first. And then she got seated s table of 8-9 people and we were completely forgot about at that point. I actually had to flag down different servers for refills and to get our check brought to us. This is pretty unacceptable and I don't know if we'll return with service like that. It kind of killed our anniversary dinner."}
{"text":"We have been to  Tupelo Honey 3 tomes. Extremely popular and crowded for Sunday brunch. Love the bartenders and the it staff. This time in my wife ordered their crab Benedict.  Runny undercooked eggs with hardly any crab...i know they can do better, and they have. Was it the busy crowd? Hope not, would love to make this place one of our favs, but this was disappointing."}
{"text":"Great food, bloody Marys were phenomenal!  Jonathan was a great server!  Recommend the Shoo Mercy omelette."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Outstanding food and drinks. Had the brunch. Best piece of sausage I've ever tasted. Home fries and eggs are amazing tool drank a beer-mosa - custom made. Price is a little more than I normally spend but it's well worth it. Service was great too. Sat, drank and ate all within an hour on Saturday morning. 

Highly recommend : 2 eggs over easy, Sausage, home fries."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Charlotte, I inform my better half that we cannot leave until we pay homage to the keeper of biscuits and tupelo honey.

Every meal is kicked off with fresh outta the oven biscuits served with fresh blueberry preserves and Tupelo honey (this is mostly the reason by I insist on coming here!) They kick my grandma's biscuit's outta the water (sorry, Grandma, but you need to step your game up!)

Top picks:
If you have never tried chicken & pancakes, or if you love it: their's are top notch. If you are really up for a challenge, try eating the entire meal... I don't think it can be done. The Shoo Mercy Pancake consists of 2 heaping flapjacks topped with  buttermilk fried chicken, maple-peppered bacon and 100% maple syrup. 

I also am a big fan of the Tupelo Farm Fresh Cheeseburger consisting of pasture-raised Black Angus beef served with aged Wisconsin cheddar, lettuce, onions, house-made pickles and Chef Brian's special sauce. I like to accompany my burger with shaved brussels sprouts salad
with honey vinaigrette and baked mac 'n cheese. 

Also, be sure to sign up for their email club and get a Tupelo Honey pint glass!"}
{"text":"It's hard to get better southern comfort food and this place adds plenty of variety and innovation to the classics to keep you coming back. Make sure to enjoy the biscuits and blueberry jam, but save room for fried chicken on pancakes.

Ask for William to be your server. And ask him about his latest cosplay ideas."}
{"text":"This Is A Vegetarian Review

My wife and I stopped in here for a late lunch as we were traveling through Charleston. It's a neat spot, nestled into a kind of touristy artsy area. The wait staff was fantastic. They had a nice beer selection. And the food was DELICIOUS! The biscuits they brought to the table were exactly what I needed. And the veggie burger was my favorite style of veggie burger patty, thick, firm enough to stay together but not tough.

We'd gone here because my wife HAD TO HAVE some fried okra. And she got it! She loved it, it came out piping hot and the dipping sauce was exactly what she was looking for.

And the price was very reasonable considering the high-quality menu and the well-cared for building. 

I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. My girlfriend and I went for dinner a couple months ago. This place has some of the best crab cakes I have ever tasted in my life! They come with big. Hunks of meat in them which is a massive plus and a sweet spicy saracha type sauce. Highly recommended! I had the pork dish - another recommended dish. Southern modern food at a reasonable price and we'll worth a visit by anyone in the south end area"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch 3 years ago and wasn't that impressed compared to the hype I had heard. I recently went for a Jack Daniel's event and was very impressed. The cocktails were very good and the food was also delicious. I think the food was specific to the event, but they had chorizo and pimento cheese nachos, bbq pulled pork biscuits, and mini pecan pie cups. For some reason they thought it was a good idea to serve a hot drink in a copper Moscow mule cup (which conducts heat), so you burned yourself if you touched the cup and the drink never cooled down to be able to take more than a sip. Overall, it was a great event and I'll be coming back to check out their dinner menu!"}
{"text":"fantastic! Authentic southern food with incredible ambiance. Their jam is amazing!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a long time. Finally the chance came when my friend wanted brunch and I couldn't figure out a good place to go that was open before 11:30. The restaurant is definitely cute in terms of decor and feeling welcoming, but the positives of the vibes probably end there. To be fair, we sat inside - not that the hostess even bothered to ask about a preference, but sitting outside could have a nicer ambiance than what I experienced today. 

The hostess politely tried to sit us at a very small table at the back of the restaurant. Upon seeing the size of the table, I felt like the plates would be too crowded with drinks and such and requests a larger table as there were 10-15 empty tables. The hostess cops an attitude and walks about to the front to 'check to see if she could do it'. I sheepishly follow her like a lost puppy dog that just got berated for chewing up a shoe. She then takes my friend and I back to the back of the restaurant by the kitchen/washroom door and seats us. Really? All the empty tables and you put us in the back by the kitchen? Honestly the table she sat us at probably shouldn't even be there as the whole time my dining partner was constantly hit/bumped by servers trying to pass through with food/dishes. At one point a waiter actually asked him to move so he could get by. I'm sorry if there isn't room for a customer to sit at this table without being told to move by waitstaff while sitting normally...then that is a good clue the table shouldn't be in that location. Honestly a very awkward and awful experience and that isn't even including the innumerable amount of times I heard distressing loud noises bellowing from the dishwashing area...not what I expect in terms of ambiance when I am paying ~ $20/entree. 

Despite the seating issue and the attitude of the hostess the food was amazing! Biscuits were very well balanced with the salt and pepper standing up to the blueberry jam. Ordered the Omelets with pimento cheese, green tomatoes, bacon, and ham. Seriously one of the best omelets I have ever had. 

Worth a visit for the high quality ingredients and great tasting food, just be firm about being seated in an area where you won't be treated as a nuisance by staff."}
{"text":"Honestly, I don't know what the hype is about this place.  I've been to the one in Greenville, SC and the original in Asheville and both were excellent.  This one--it leaves a bit to be desired.  They can't really seem to get timing right on when to bring the biscuits which they are known for and the food is either way too greasy or extremely bland. I haven't yet found a happy medium, and I've given it a few chances.  Each time I've gotten coffee which is good but the mugs are so large that it makes it impossible to drink it before it goes cold unless you drink really fast.  I often find myself skipping the coffee there and going to DD across the street after the meal.  I'm not convinced reputation this place has in other spots has made it to the Charlotte location yet."}
{"text":"After living in Charleston for so long, I was convinced there were no \"good\" restaurants in Charlotte. Tupelo Honey Café has proved me wrong. A great atmosphere with a simple, yet eclectic menu leaves me please every time. 

I highly recommend the fried chicken and also the sweet potato pancakes with a piece of fried chicken on top!  And the fried okra is a MUST! 

Don't forget to register on their website before you dine and you can go home with a souvenir pint glass!"}
{"text":"Visited today after awhile of not eating there and food has really gone down hill. They no longer offer an adult grilled cheese which is all I enjoyed before. Menu is very limited and food left something to be desired. Service was slow and it's very expensive for what you get. Too many other food options around to return here."}
{"text":"Not sure why I go to this place.

Sunday brunch is always insanely packed. As this is their busiest service, you think they would be better prepared and have more staff. 

We came for Sunday brunch and waited at least half an hour just to get a drink at the bar. I really feel like they should have one bartender dedicated to those around the bar because everyone waiting for a table is trying to get a drink. 

We put our name in for a table, but about 45 minutes in we found seating in the bar area. 

We quickly put in our food order and more drink orders. Several times our drink orders were forgotten and we had to continue to let the waitress know we hadn't gotten our drinks. Even worse, by this point the crowd had cleared, so we couldn't figure out why service was still so slow. 

AN HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER....we let our waitress know we still hadn't received her food. We told her it had been over an hour and she was surprised by this! It was like she had no idea. She went to talk to the kitchen and food came out soon after. 

After all of that, my food was COLD. The manager came over and tried to tell me that the crab Benedict was a \"cold crab salad.\" I let her know my eggs and biscuit were cold as well and she continued to try and tell me that the dish was served cold because of the crab salad. Cold eggs and a cold biscuit?! Gross. I ate two bites and left my plate. 

I believe the manager eventually handled the situation well, but she wouldn't drop the fact that it was supposed to have been a cold dish. A bit frustrating. 

There are too many good places to eat for this place to be relevant. Such an overrated chain. Too long of a wait for mediocre food. And once the crowd clears, service still seems slow."}
{"text":"mmmm mmmm good!
leave your healthy self at the door, and go on in and enjoy some fantastically delicious grub!
I had been to the location in Asheville, and was quite excited when I heard about one opening in Charlotte. For my first visit, I started with the biscuits and I was already in heaven; warm, soft, flaky, delicious. Some of the other foods I tasted included the pulled pork spring rolls, the fried chicken, the seared scallops and last but not the least, the pecan pie. my favorite of them all was definitely the fried chicken. It's probably amongst the best fried chicken I've ever had. The batter was so flavorful. The chicken was topped with some melted cheese and came with a cauliflower gratin on the side. Moving on from the food...The ambiance was nice & cozy, and the servers seemed very friendly! I'm going back there soon when I'm ready for another divinely semi-unhealthy meal ;)"}
{"text":"Food is great and I absolutely adore this joint but I wish they would stop adding salt and pepper to their biscuits.. it works when you're eating a savory meal but it just tastes like conflict on my tongue if I'm eating it with the preserves and honey."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely delightful! Hands down one of the best brunches we have ever had in North Carolina! The food, the service, the atmosphere made this a lovely experience. The place was completely packed when we arrived but it was worth the hour wait. My shrimp and grits were delicious! It was enjoyable to the very last bite! I see exactly why this gem is rated so high on Yelp. We will definitely return next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"IN SUMMARY: EXCELLENT BRUNCH - MAKE RESERVATIONS IF YOU CAN! 

I had never been to Tupelo Honey Cafe before, and didn't realize it was a sister location to at least one other in Asheville, NC. I've always heard great things, but never had an excuse to venture out until recently. I went on a Sunday morning to meet two of my friends for brunch. We had an 11AM reservation, and when we first arrived, there were a few parties waiting to be seated, but we were quickly given a table. I will say, as we left, it was PACKED and there were many parties waiting for a table. So if you can, make a reservation.

Breakfast/brunch is my favorite meal - period. I love anything breakfast, but when I go to brunch I usually get the 'everything' meal (eggs, bacon, pankcakes, etc...). If I don't do that, I will get the eggs benedict. I decided to go outside the box and ordered their breakfast bowl. YUM! I would never have ordered this because it's not my kind of dish, but I'd seen a photo online and it looked so tasty. Plus, being a southern fresh food kind of place, I decided to give it a try. I am SO glad I did. It was more than enough food, but it was so good I ate it all up! 

My friends both got the BLT sandwich, which they seemed to like, but both complained it was greasy and they needed to wash their hands before leaving. We all ordered coffee - it was good coffee. The goat cheese grits were so tasty. I love goat cheese, but even if you don't like goat cheese, don't let that scare you away. It wasn't strong, it was just savory, creamy & cheesy. No extra salt or pepper needed. While we waited for our food, our waiter brought perfectly cooked homemade biscuits and homemade blueberry jam/jelly. The jam/preserves (whatever it's called) was really good. I'd buy it to take home. I had a few pieces of blueberry in it, but they weren't tough or dry or unwelcomed at all. I liked the pieces. Our waiter was fantastic as well. He was patient when we needed more time and helpful when needed. He was also very attentive and kept our drinks full.

Let me know if this review helped you or if you have any questions, I'll answer what I can.  It was very good - so give it a try!"}
{"text":"We had the County Fair avocado appetizer which means it was breaded and fried and delicious! The pecan encrusted goat cheese was good as well. We shared the Southern Belle grilled cheese that was Brie Gorgonzola with house made pear & onion marmalade and it was delicious! The highlight was the Buttermilk Honey  cheesecake! Our server, Jonathan, was exceptional. He was cordial, knowledgeable and prompt with our orders!"}
{"text":"It is a restaurant with nice patio seatings on a 2nd floor. It was a little chilly so we were seated inside though. Ordered Shoo Mercy Sweet Potato Pancakes and fried green tomatoes. The pancakes come with one piece of fried chicken, apple cider bacon, two eggs. It is a pretty big portion for one person. (Maybe that's why it is a bit pricier than other dishes) We shared and ordered one appetizer. The buttermilk chicken was very crispy! The sweet potato pancake is good not not a wow taste to me. Grits that came with fried green tomatoes was good and sauce on the top added great flavor on it. Our server was very nice and the food was good."}
{"text":"I had the Old Skool, (twice) and they were amazing! Added the Fried Green Tomatoes as an appetizer and they were goooooood!  Bailey is one of the best bartenders in the City of Charlotte! Highly recommended if you're in the mood for great food and drinks in the South End."}
{"text":"Great service by Caleb! The food was ok. I think it's just that I got a burger and fries. The beef tasted of good quality - it just wasn't that great for the price. The fries were dreadful... not hot either. The place has a cool atmosphere inside. The staff was working very hard. Lastly, I wish the prices were posted on the menu online. Some of the menu items seemed way over priced."}
{"text":"LOVED this place! unique spin on southern food in a very \"hipster\" setting."}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions!!! Try the goat cheese appetizer and the fig covered pork chops - very nice!"}
{"text":"Great food, horrible service:

I grew up in Asheville and frequented the Tupelo Honey Cafe there, so when one opened in Charlotte, I had to check it out. 

First, I will say that the food was on-point, the atmosphere was exceptional, and the fact that we didn't have to wait for a table was awesome. But the server we had (and I hope this is not reflective of the entire serve staff) made me not want to go back. Our six water glasses remained empty for the majority of the evening (only being refilled once, when we put all six empty water glasses on the edge of the table), it took 25 minutes for her to return with our second round of beers (after we had to remind her, for which she did not apologize), she took our appetizers away before we were finished with them (and we couldn't ask for them back because she smashed one of the plates on top of the unfinished plate), and she made no apology or excuse for her behavior. 

The worst part was when we had gone out of our way to order a surprise piece of pie to be the birthday dessert of a member of our group -- we were there for a birthday dinner -- she said she would try to find a candle, and not only did she not find a candle (which is fine), but when she brought the pie over, she didn't give us a chance to sing or do anything because she just plopped it down in front of the birthday girl and walked away."}
{"text":"The food here was good actually. 

BUT.....
1. We waited 10 minutes to get a server to even look our way. Even though they were obviously over-staffed. There were like 5 people at the bar at one time. And only 4 people sitting at the bar.
2. Watched a server tear up bacon apart with his hands (at the bar) and then dump it into some kind pickle jar with cloudy water or liquor. It was pretty nasty to see while we ate. Isn't that what the kitchen is for? Prepping?!!!
3. Witnessed a customer come up to the bar and get ignored. Then she was acknowledged by the bartender, only to be told to wait. After 10 minutes that customer just left. I don't blame her.
4. We had to go he out own condiments from another table across the room.
5. Saw new customers come sit in the bar area. After waiting about 15 minutes, they decided I go get their own menus. 

It's pretty sad, cause the food there really was good. But the service is killing it.  That will be my first and last time at this place. I can't wait to complain about it at work on Monday."}
{"text":"Went on NYE and didnt appear they were ready for the crowd... we arrived about 1050, they opened at 11, nobody upfront to start taking names.. somebody finally came by and said it would be about 5 minutes 2 minutes before 11. When they were reading to start seating there was a large crowd and no list.. it was a 'who was here before who' to get sat. Not a good start, however everything after that was amazing. Our server was extremely nice and came over very quickly to get drinks/take orders. We both othered the same breakfast.. scrambled eggs, he got grits/sausage I had bacon/potatoes. The goat cheese grits were amazing, the sausage was the best I have ever had, bacon was peppered and good pieces.. potatoes a little greasy but good, the eggs were overcooked for both our liking... the portions were HUGE.. 3 pieces of bacon... the sausage patty was big... we also ordered a side of biscuit/gravy.. we added some of the sausage to it and that really put it over the top. For the portion size the prices are very reasonable.. the set up of the resturant is bright and warm.. good family spot.. would love to go back for lunch/dinner and check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place...I was so excited with feel of the restaurant, the decor, the biscuits and jam. But the meal wasn't that good. We shared the pimento cheese nachos (fair, not great), and he had the sweet tea chicken (he enjoyed it, but $20 per plate...not an every week place) and I had the ribs (WOULD NOT RECOMMEND) they were so tough and fatty. I was so sad when we left. 
If this is your style and price range, you will love it! But, we work to hard for our money not to enjoy the food at such a cost."}
{"text":"We used to love the original in Asheville. We took my father to the one in Charlotte and found it overpriced and the food was just ok."}
{"text":"LOVE their Bloody Marys!  Their service has always been very slow, but super friendly.  It's my personal opinion that their space is bigger than the staff can manage.  But, it's worth the wait.  We went in today for our first brunch of 2018 and were s glad we made a reservation on Open Table, because the wait for a table was an eternity.  

The biscuits are DELISH! I had the fried okra (sooooo good), avocado toast with over easy eggs, and a side of grits.  My only regret is that I didn't order a sweet tea as well.  Ha.  

The space is clean and so are the bathrooms.  Parking is ridiculously difficult at this location, be prepared.  We have had the same waitress the past few times we have been here, and we love her.  Although, she has no control over how slowly the kitchen is working.   If you're not a Bloody Mary fan, their mimosas are equally delish!"}
{"text":"I'm no expert in restaurant operations, but there seems to be a big disconnect between the number of seats and the capacity of the kitchen at this location. The servers and waitstaff are great. The food is okay but not worth the premium price for a glorified southern farm to table concept. All avocado toast hype aside, the food (and the coffee) should always come to the patrons HOT. Worth coming back if the prices were lower, the food was actually unique, or if the kitchen was more efficient."}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying I have been to the location at myrtle beach and it was a COMPLETELY (positive) different experience. 

My mom, sister, and I decided to give this location a try for lunch, and it was a let down. We walked up the steep steps to slowly and leisurely be greeted by the hostess. We were seated in a nice booth, and the ambiance of the cafe is really nice. Cool designs, light fixtures, and just a really creative, unique layout. That was the best part of our experience here..ha. Our waitress brought us our menus and then pretty much forgot about us for 15 minutes. Once we finally ordered we waiting another 25-30 minutes to get our food. YIKES. It was weird, I actually laughed when I saw our food coming. One of the chefs (I'm guessing) brought our food out and my salad was pressed up against his shirt while he was struggling to carry the other two plates. As for the food...ehh. My personal opinion is that their beautifully put together menu is much better than the actual execution. I got the signature salad, it was okay, it had ALOT of dressing. My mom got the county fried avacado, the breading was very overpowering. We also got a side of baked mac and cheese which tasted like it was warmed up in the microwave from last night then sat out for a couple minutes. My sister got the southern belle grilled cheese and boy was that weird looking. The bread was a bit soggy and the cheese wasn't really melted, but the flavor was there. Overall our server was terrible and the food was pretty mediocre..I did enjoy my water though!"}
{"text":"We did not have the greatest experience.

The restaurant was busy but not overly crowded. I guess we caught them on a bad day. The only saving grace was the beverage manager somehow got involved and tried to fix things. The restaurant did follow up later, which means they care.

The food is good."}
{"text":"Love the Bloody Mary!! I also think their tomato soup with the grilled cheese is great!"}
{"text":"Solid brunch spot. Make sure to get there before 10am or be prepared to wait. You can't go wrong with the eggs Betty or the chicken and biscuits. Both hit the spot. Nothing overly creative or on the edge of culinary genius, just good southern food with huge proportions... as it should be."}
{"text":"Everything is meh. I've never been fond of the Asheville location and did not have interest in trying the Charlotte location. I've been dragged here various times for work lunches and have not enjoyed a single meal. The service is bad, the food is bland and overpriced- the only notable things are sweet tea and the porch. It's a blasé chain, nothing more."}
{"text":"looking for a place for brunch/breakfast and found this place in yelp. If you have not been..go. OMG the food is so good and the staff super friendly and helpful. I had the soup and grilled cheese. Sounds simple but it was out of this world. Everyone seemed to love it."}
{"text":"I love this place! I used to live in Asheville and eat at the one downtown, and now that I've moved to Charlotte I am so happy there is a Tupelo Honey Cafe here, 5 mins walk from my work! This one has a different feel from the original, but still extremely welcoming and the food is delicious. You MUST try the goat cheese grits, theirs converted me from a being a but \"meh\" about grits to loving them! The collards are the best collards I've ever eaten. We just had lunch here today, William was our server and he was super friendly and funny. Such a good place, check it out!"}
{"text":"We were lucky to sit on the veranda on this pleasant summer evening.  We ordered glasses of rise, which came in two sizes.  Can't remember the ounces, but we both got the size that is not recommended by the surgeon general.  Then, we each got another.
My friend ordered shrimp and grits (can you believe she is from New Jersey?). And, I got the Vererated Veggie Nowl, composed of grits, greens, salsa, blackeyed peas and okra.  Delicious!  Tupelo Honey especially does fried okra right.  Light, crispy and no grease.  That was a big bowl!  I enjoyed those leftovers at work the next day.
My friend and I shared a piece of pecan pie with ice cream.  We needed another friend to help us eat that big piece of dessert.
I might add that the service showed true Southern hospitality.  Love this place. Its heart doesn't need blessing."}
{"text":"I came in as a novice to the southern area. I'd tried sweet tea (pretty hard not to like) and grits (bleuughhhh), but nothing really southern. Tupelo honey changed that in the best possible way. The food is a great introduction to the south - a modern take on southern food or a southern take on modern food, it is a delicious way to acclimatize yourself to this quaintly odd area. And oh my god, the complimentary biscuits they serve you at the beginning of the meal are amazing!! Along with the homemade blueberry jam and freshly collected, warmed honey, it's irresistible. And leaves you waning just a but more. Sigh, if only it were on the menu.

But the things that are on the menu are also great! Lots of fried okra, goat cheese grits, and fried tomatoes, among other well roasted and flavored vegetables - delightful for vegetarians. Tupelo honey: welcome to the other side of the Mason-Dixon Line."}
{"text":"I've been dying to try this place so I stopped in. The menu is plentiful with appetizers, small plates, and of course full meals. There's something for everyone. We sat near the kitchen and dang near everything that was set on that counter looked delicious. 

But let's talk service first. Our server's name was Brittany and she was amazing! She greeted us shortly after we sat down, our drinks were never empty and she came back several times to make sure everything was ok. I'd like to add that she did all this and provided excellent service on a packed Saturday night while people were on town for Pride. I say that because sometimes in places service tends to suffer when servers are overwhelmed with tables and all. Brittany handled it like a champ and never dropped the ball or let us see her sweat lol. Of course her most difficult task was asking if we wanted dessert even bough I'm sure my tummy looked like it was ready to explode lol. I was tempted. It next time I will for sure try something because I saw a few leave the kitchen and they looked divine. Anyways I'd certainly go back and ask for Brittany. She takes care of the customers.

They give you a biscuit before your meal with a side of some blueberry jam. The biscuit is really soft, warm and flaky. I don't even like biscuits but I would go and order just those if I could. I ordered the Salted Roasted Beets w/ Pecan crusted goat cheese. It was good but for $9 I expected a few more beets on the plate. For my main meal, I ordered the Wampus Cat Ribs w/ Apple Cider Greens & Baked Mac and sampled some of the meatloaf off my sweety's plate. The meatloaf was okay. Not really my style with the tomato salsa on top (I prefer a gravy or glaze) but it wasn't bad. My ribs though... were DELICIOUS! They had a kick of spiciness to them, very meaty and tender the way a rib should be. The greens were good and there was a good serving on the plate. My mac & cheese was also really good. Probably one of the few restaurants I've been to in the Carolinas that makes a proper mac and actually BAKES it, not that stovetop crap. Normally I don't like the bread crumbs on top but this was really good and cheesy and so I didn't mind so much. 

Overall, I would definitely go back to sample some more of their goodies (porkchops, scallops, peach ribs, pulled pork) and more sides too (they need a veggie plate lol). Food: A.   Service: A+"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Service excellent. We loved Kimberly. She's vibrant and fun. She also gave me a tip to order the fried green tomatoes with grits. It was awesome. I will definitely be back and I'm going to request Kimberly"}
{"text":"Ok, Ok, I give in.  I'm a fan, I'm a follower, I'm a kool-aide drinker, I'm pathetically ALL about this place.  I was secretly hoping I didn't like it so I could go against the hype and put a spotlight on the truth of this place BUT the truth is...it was a very good experience.

Right off the bat I can tell you I gave 4 stars instead of 5 due to the ambiance.  It was loud and chaotic on Friday night.  I think the exposed kitchen only added clinking and clanging to the already hollowed out echoing that was taking place in the main dining area.  It was so loud that I was literally having to strain to talk to the people at my table.

Regarding the food...
Everything that came out was done sensationally!  Of course we started with the biscuits, which are served with honey (no surprise there) and a blueberry jam.  These biscuits were absolutely heavenly.  They are the kind of biscuits that make other biscuits jealous.  I mean, FORGET Flying Biscuit, Bojangles, Biscuitville, and wherever else you may get a fresh biscuit.  THC has got to be serving the best or close to it!  They were buttery, flaky, warm, soft, yet crispy on the outside.  

I ordered the veggie plate and bumped up to 4 veggies for $12.95.  I tried the asparagus, cheesey cauliflower rice, mashed sweet potatoes and brown butter brussel sprouts.  They accidentally brought out the homemade mac and cheese as well.  This platter was the most comforting veggie plate I have ever had.  The mashed sweet potatoes were my favorite.  They were pleasantly flavored with just enough brown sugar to balance the other savory items I selected.  My next favorite dish was the brown butter brussel sprouts.  They were cooked to a tender perfection, they were seasoned just enough and the butter balanced the normal bitter taste of the sprouts.  Next up would be the cheesy cauliflower rice.  I make cauliflower rice at home but nothing like this!  This was a great mix between mashed potatoes au gratin and cheesy grits.  The texture was obviously more \"rice-like\" but the flavor was very rich and again soothing/comforting.  Lastly, I tried the asparagus.  They were my least favorite but still rather tasty.  They were covered in benne seeds but just didn't have much flavor.  They were crispy and warm, which was good but I would have preferred some other type of flavoring.  

Others at my table enjoyed the Meatloaf which was rosemary infused, tender and bursting with flavor!  Her meal was served with the mac n cheese which was very good--creamy (not gummy) and had a nice spice to it (not bland).  Another person ordered the grilled cheese that is served with creamy tomato soup.  At first I thought that was ridiculous to order but then I realized this was a grilled cheese on steroids and absolutely worth ordering!  It was served on toasted sourdough bread, had bacon on it, fried green tomatoes AND pimento cheese all united in a very holy matrimony.  It was brilliant.

I'm sure they are still working out a few kinks but they really served up a great meal.  I knew their brunch would be good but I didn't know what to expect regarding dinner and I left 100% satisfied.  The service was decent but I think it could be better and will get better over time.  The servers seemed to be running ragged and they seem a little short staffed in general.  The manager did approach the table which I always enjoy but everyone just seemed a little frazzled.  

Obviously I wouldn't advise going here for a romantic dinner but this place is better for a group of friends or a casual date.  I saw one too many kids so that puts a damper on a low key date night in my opinion.

Go for the food and you won't be disappointed.  I think the initials for this restaurant are really a subliminal message....\"THC\"...because the food is euphoric.  :)

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I heard amazing things before coming here from friends. They were right! The server was amazing and personable. The drink she suggested was exactly what I wanted and I would go back in a heart beat for it. Then breakfast came and once again was so happy! Best grits ever! They now rank in my top 5. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Stopped here while on vacation from Pennsylvania. When I say they have amazing food, they have AMAZING FOOD. First off the biscuits and the blueberry jam are amazing. 

I wish I could have had every item on the menu but I did get to have the fried chicken and biscuits and my fellow foodie had the cracklins and the farmers breakfast (I think that's what it is called.) All of it left us wanting more. I don't think you can go wrong with anything here!!

Not to mention, the staff was incredibly kind, quick, and efficient.

If you get a chance, go here. There is no way you could regret if you have even the smallest liking for southern food."}
{"text":"Food is great. Atmosphere is very nice. Good alcohol selection. You could eat just the biscuits and be satisfied. I am never disappointed when we go here."}
{"text":"Had lunch today on the patio and it was amazing! We had Emma as our server and she was so amazing and super helpful!"}
{"text":"We have been to Tupelo Honey and Asheville and absolutely loved everything about it! 
So we decided to try the one in Charlotte out. Well wish we didn't our experience was not good at all. Ordered pimento cheese nacho and replaced the chorizo with soysage. When we received dish it looked like real meat so I mentioned it to server she said she would check with chef not to mention took about 20+ mins to receive them. No one ever came back for about 5 more mins and it was the manager who said \"that was soysauge and that they are making us new ones and he will take care of it\" he walked away and I said to my husband if that was the case why didn't they just tell us that and give them back to us???????????
Waited another 15 mins and no nachos or waitress finally we grabbed someone and said don't worry about it we will just pay for our drinks we didn't have time to wait any longer. We were ignored again and about 10 more mins then they finally came out and they handed check to us with nachos in to go containers that took 30-40 mins to get! Need to say we left the nachos there and left the correct amount of our drinks and got into our Uber and left. Uber Plus Nachos
Moral of story you may not want to drop in quickly and have a beer and appetizer at bar if you have only 45 mins to spare!
Friendly Reminder: Nachos are chips with cold ingredients added to them topped with cheese and put in oven to melt for no more than 5 mins."}
{"text":"This was my third time at this restaurant. I am definitely disappointed at this burnt piece of chicken they served me. Had I been a customer that dined in I would not have out up with this. I'm shocked that they let me leave with this. Now I'm back at my hotel looking a burnt BLT that isn't edible. I have gotten this same meal 3 times and it's usually delicious and juicy. I guess this is what I get for not eating in. If you take food to go please check it cause I would not have left with this."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast on the patio and it was delightful! They allow you to order breakfast, lunch and dinner anytime. I choose to have the fried green tomatoes served over goat cheese grits and a side of soysage. My husband had the breakfast platter with eggs, maple back and potatoes. everything was great! The potatoes tasted like a really good soft chip and we were also served a complimentary biscuit with blackberry jam. The service was fast and friendly. I also want to add the coffee and mega mimosa were tasty as well. A great addition to south end."}
{"text":"Great biscuits! I hate that they don't take reservations though. Food is pretty good. But not worth the wait at busy times. But yum the biscuits!!!"}
{"text":"A nice location and friendly servers, surely makes your experience pleasant. I'm not a fan of biscuits, however I think they have the best I've ever tried in the charlotte area. My main dish wasn't very much to my liking, It was okay but not something I would try again. I would try this place again, yet experiment with other options."}
{"text":"Cute, rustic decor with plenty of space and light, as well as outdoor seating.  Buuuut service was SO incredibly slow.  All I ordered was the Tupelo Signature Salad (delicious and filling), but it took soooo looooong to make.  It seemed like there were only 2 waiters in the entire joint on a busy Sunday morning.  That's a big brunch no-no.

The big complimentary biscuits were okay.  They were too buttery for my taste, but I enjoyed the blueberry jam that came with them."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  The Brussels Sprouts were crispy and came with a tasty home made ranch. Southwestern omelet was fluffy and prepared to perfection. The manager, Mary Ellen, did a table visit and was very personable. She bought us a free dessert as well, the banana pudding mason jar, which was great. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Really really work on your bar customer service. Lauren (blonde hair) is the only one who gets it. Soooo many people behind the bar but not attentive of the customers. My to go food was cold and the bartender had no idea of how long it was even there. Really annoyed of weak service, and won't spend my money where customer service isn't valued. It's 2018 i need to be \"wowed\" something to make me come back..i can cook at home or go anywhere in South End."}
{"text":"How the mighty have fallen! (Ok, the \"mighty\" part may be a slight exaggeration)

My friend and I were looking for a brunch spot that is semi-causal this recent Sunday. We arrived after 1pm, and were faced with a big crowd of people on the balcony already in wait for tables. We were told the wait for a 2-top would be 35 minutes but that all the spaces in the bar area were up for grab. Bar area it was.

There were lots of empty spots at the bar - all with dirty dishes & glasses piled up in front of. Be warned: \"pre-bus\" is not a practice or a concept here. We sat at one of the long tables (communal style), and no one greeted us with anything. I ended up getting our own menus, and my friend ended up cleaning up the rest of the table himself (Side note: you would think if a patron ask for a towel to wipe up a dirty table, that someone would come and do it - nope, they just handed him a towel). 

It took forever for drinks to arrive - the bloody mary ($8 for a very small glass) was bloody watery by the time it got to our table. Good thing it was not for me. We enjoyed the biscuits alot, because we were starving at this point. I ordered the Fried Egg BLT ($9) and opt for a cup of soup ($1 add on). My friend ordered a burger. My dish arrived as a Fried CHICKEN BLT - so I had to wait again for my food. My friend's 2nd bloody mary never made it to the table. At the end the food was OK but I was too busy being baffled by the chaotic/slow/bad service to enjoy much of it.

In short - it was a nightmare of an experience in terms of service. The food was ok, but not enough for anyone to put up with that amount of incompetence. A word of advice to Management: Do something or you are not going to have much repeat business. One can only ride on the name and notoriety for so long."}
{"text":"I must say, after being to the Asheville location, I wasn't too impressed. However, my mom convinced me to go with her to the one on South End in Charlotte. WOW. After studying abroad the past year, I was craving some Shrimp & Grits, my favorite food.  My mom and I both ordered the shrimp & grits, and she loaded hers with the extra suggestions (ridiculously cheap for the extras, about 45 cents each for bacon spinach etc.!) I must say the Shrimp & Grits were the best I'd ever had, even better than my moms!! The service was also remarkable, the server never let my sweet tea empty out before she refilled it. Will for sure be making the drive from Gastonia back to THC!!!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night with another couple. We shared an order of fried green tomatoes and crispy brussel sprouts. Each was good, but nothing memorable. For our meals were an order of sweet potato pancakes, it went half uneaten. An order of shrimp and grits, which my friend did not care for their grits. An flake steak, which was quite spicy from the peppers it was topped with. It was cooked well and had a good flavor. And lastly there was an order of ribs that came out burnt with sauce over the top. These were sent back and came back cooked better. Over all the table agreed the food was ok, but not good and not a place we would come back to. (At least not for dinner, maybe breakfast is better?) Also the food was over priced for what we got and how it tasted. The staff/servers were all quite nice and friendly. But over all we were disappointed with our experience here."}
{"text":"My dinner at Tupelo Honey was not bad but it wasn't awesome either. The restaurant itself is super cute, I loved the look. Our waiter was very friendly and the biscuits to start with were delicious.

I wasn't really sure what I wanted for dinner and nothing really jumped out at me at first glance. They have a burger on the menu that had toppings (pork confit, cheese sauce) that just didn't appeal to me so I asked if I could order a regular burger without all of that. I was told that wasn't possible. I understand that chefs want their food eaten a certain way but it was just a little bit odd to me. 

I ended up ordering the short rib, which came with roasted carrots, potatoes, and a spring pea cream. It was really delicious. The short rib was good but the veggies were honestly the best part of the meal. Overall it was a fun place to visit but from what I understand it may be a better choice for brunch than dinner."}
{"text":"Food was excellent - or was it just that it took 45 minutes to come and I was starving by the time it got to me.  Service was pleasant."}
{"text":"Always have a great meal here! William was a fantastic server and accommodated our large party very well."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner with some friends one evening and was surprised by how expensive most of the menu items were. Luckily, we got there during happy hour, so we could order small plates for $5-7. Although the waiter told us we couldn't, we ended up getting to. Score. Note: even though it says happy hour ends at 7, the drink specials are all day.

The mini veggie burger and french fries were delicious, minus the gross onion on the burger. The fried green tomatoes came on top of some sort of paste-like side which I absolutely couldn't stomach. I had high hopes for those tomatoes, but one of my friends ate them instead. 

The cosmopolitan I ordered was yummy, although so much stronger the second time I could hardly drink it. Our waiter tried to carry too many things at once and ended up pouring a martini all over my friend before the glass shattered on the floor. Yikes. His knowledge of the menu was so unimpressive I had to ask if he was new. He wasn't.

The second time I came to Tupelo, I took a drink suggestion from our waiter... big mistake. He told me his favorite drink, the blueberry mule, and insisted I'd like it. So wrong! I was sick after one sip. It tasted like a frat guy had made it, not a bartender. He did not treat me very nicely after I told him I did not like the drink and asked for another one. In fact, he never came back to our table after that comment. Another waitress cashed us out, who said, \"happy now??\" once she got our checks right after mixing them up and having to reprint them with the correct orders. Didn't appreciate the 'tude.

The service was incredibly slow both times I have eaten here. I had to flag someone down for more water at least 3 times. Which is mind boggling because there were barely any other patrons eating at the time. The staff is rarely ever friendly or knowledgeable, which is kind of a not-so-cool thing at a restaurant.

Hire some new staff, make sure they study the menu, and check on that bartender..."}
{"text":"I was not impressed. Food quality was low and tasted cheap. I have no idea why ppl rave about it. I won't go back. Liberty is across the parking lot and a thousand times better plus they use local food."}
{"text":"Good place for business lunches. Nice variety of things to eat. I'm always satisfied with my meal here and usually everyone can find something they like! Biscuits served are a good snack before the meal and the fried Brussels are delicious! Worth a try!"}
{"text":"We went for brunch after having been to the Asheville and Greenville locations several times. The biscuits and grits were great, and our server was very friendly. It was my fault for ordering scrambled eggs, though. They had clearly been sitting out for a while and were made along with a large batch. They were overcooked and lukewarm. And our server was not proactive in checking on us. It was busy so she was attending to multiple tables. I think it is an isolated incident, though, so I'll try again. But it will probably take a while since there are a lot of great brunch places here in Charlotte."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts in Charlotte and ever. The biscuits are great with both the honey and jam. Cocktails are great especially the insane large blood Mary. Do yourself a favor and order either the Shoo Mercy omelette or chicken and waffles - the best two breakfast items I've ever had (I'm Lukewarm on the red flannel hash). Probably the first stop I'd recommend in Charlotte for breakfast."}
{"text":"It is unlikely I could love this place anymore.  They pay extreme attention and take great care to ensure I have safe gluten free food, as I have celiac disease.  There are so many menu items I can, and do, enjoy!

The food is delicious, fresh, has pure ingredients, and just the right amount of southern authenticity without being all deep fried.  I can have a variety of foods (fish, burgers with gluten free bread, grits, salads, sides) and I have loved each item every time.  They have a good drink menu and specials throughout the week. 

I have brought family, friends and grandparents here.  The atmosphere is great and the outdoor balcony is my favorite.  There are occasionally long waits but I find it worth it to go at semi off times and have not had to wait doing that (e.g. Dinner at six instead of 7)."}
{"text":"I had the sweet potato cakes with chicken and it was amazing! The blueberry jam with biscuits was delicious. Also had the Bloody Mary, one of the better ones I've had! I will definitely be coming back to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"Good bless one of the most overrated places in the southeast! BUT this has to be the worst location of them all. First if you are going for breakfast food there are so many better places! I will say if it is not busy you will have a better experience and the food will come out as expected. Watch out for those prices through they bite back:)"}
{"text":"Late lunch with my lovely wife, we arrived between the big rushes and so were seated immediately at a large booth. Courtney did a great job of serving us and her enthusiasm about TH was more than clear.

We started off with the Fried Green Tomatoes to share. Served with grits, the taste of the tomato came through clearly. Very delicious and a great starter.

For main course, Mrs chose the Wicked Chicken Biscuit. The tabasco on the top was unexpected but the rest of it looked and tasted amazing. Really delish.

I chose the Grilled Cheese and it was absolutely excellent. The bite from the gorgonzola with the sweetness from the brie was terrific. Super delicious sandwich. The cole slaw on the side was great. A little vinegary, but still quite tasty.

A good meal, great service, I'm absolutely a fan!"}
{"text":"Tupelo honey is excellent! I love the buttermilk chicken! Very tender and tasty. My friend got the fried green tomatoes. They were awesome! I will be back soon. As an added bonus the GM stopped by my table to check on us. He was very polite and very handsome.. I will definitely be coming back to this location.."}
{"text":"Tupelo Honey was surprisingly authentic southern food. I was expecting unhealthy fried chicken and cole slaw, but they took it to another level. All their food was well thought out and different while still sticking to tradition. I could hardly decide what to get; I was stuck on three or four options that all sounded delicious (so I'll be going back soon). I ended up getting the loaded grilled cheese with tomato basil soup and a side of grits. I'm so happy I didn't pass on the goat cheese grits- they were fantastic! Overall, I recommend Tupelo Honey Cafe if you're in the mood for good food... So obviously, any time is a good time to go!"}
{"text":"Tupelo Honey Cafe is great I had the honey Chipotle wings and  they were fabulous ... I had the greatest waitress named Karlee she did not miss a Beat so if you like great food ask for Karlee and go to Tupelo Honey Cafe...."}
{"text":"Great lunch with William as our server. The okra app is soooo good and I'm obsessed with the brussel sprouts. We live down the street and go a lot with my kids. They love the grilled cheese, Mac and pancakes."}
{"text":"One year later we again tried this restaurant. Recv'd order 90 mins after ordering. Biscuits served one HOUR after being seated.,we had a large party but we arrived on time. 2.5 HOURS after being seated we begged for our checks. Wait staff did their best but managers stood around staring into the kitchen. Dried okra, congealed gravy, cold biscuits. Asked for a second cocktail but waitress never got around to it. This is the WORST dining experience In Charlotte!  It's only a matter of time until they are g-o-n-e- and thankfully so."}
{"text":"I was really not impressed with this place. The food selection was not as vast as I would have liked being a vegetarian. Parking was also hard. I went on a Friday after work. The wait time was not bad. Our waiter was super nice and attentive. I would give it another shot. My coworkers were not impressed with their food either."}
{"text":"One word... Overhyphed..went with lot of expectations since had read so much about the asheville restuarant..the charlotte restuarant was Ok.."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had brunch here today. We started with some seasonal strawberry mojitos which were super delish! Bailey and Mel were so awesome we decided to eat at the bar rather than wait for a table. The breakfast bowl and steak and eggs checked out to be 5 Star dishes. Thanks again Bailey & Mel for a great experience! See you again soon!"}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this place and their porch. It gets busy, so make a reservation if you're able to do so. The food is good. My friends from out-of-town enjoyed it. I expected a larger choice of food selections, even though it wasn't that bad. They also had a nice list of brunch drinks, which we enjoyed. Summary: great location. wish I would have been on the patio. good brunch choices."}
{"text":"The locals recommended this awesome restaurant to entertain our European visitors. Wow, the renovated train station left enough character while being open and warm. The food was southern super. Try the Carolina Dip and the Fried Green Tomatoes to start. The Happy Hour bites included Potato Cracklings...4 orders might be enough of those crispy, tender. The shrimp and grits with chorizo was creamy with enough spice. I'll be headed back!"}
{"text":"Great location in south end and some amazing (heavy and indulgent) food. Make reservations because it does get busy and service is slow but worth it. The biscuits are great and the curried chicken thighs heavenly. Upscale comfort food in a fun atmosphere. Just make sure you aren't in a rush."}
{"text":"where do i start... this place is delish! :) from the biscuits to the pickled okra to the blueberry jam to the mashed cauliflower!! cant wait to try more things from here!"}
{"text":"This is a great spot, and perfect location for this restaurant. After a ton of hype from colleagues at work, we decided to try it out for dinner. 

First and foremost, as far as the service goes.. 5+ stars! From the second we walked in to when we picked up our car with the valet, service was 100% on point. Our waitress Ali was exceptional!! Based on that alone I would come back. 

The food was also very good. A few better than others, but overall a nice job. The biscuits with honey and jam are awesome!! The Mai Tai was also great! Together we tried the Tomato soup and Tacos to start. They unfortunately did not have anymore of the eggrolls I had heard a lot about... but the Tacos were great! Tomato soup wasn't what I expected, and wasn't the biggest fan of. For dinner we had Shoo Me grits and Chicken BLT w/ mac & cheese. Shrimp were nice and big and plentiful! The portion was really big, might go with the standard size next time. Chicken BLT was a solid choice! 

I definitely want to return and try brunch!"}
{"text":"great place for a brunch or dinner. Southern style food without the extra grease. Affordable but not cheap.

crackling potatoes a must."}
{"text":"Great Service, server was very friendly and attentive. The fried green tomatoes were crispy and flavorful, the biscuits with jam and honey..gotta try them!"}
{"text":"Finally we were able to try out Tupelo for weekend brunch! We walked in earlier today to find a 10-15 minute wait for 2 people, not bad, but we just ended up seating ourselves in the bar area. The waitress was nice but, very unorganized. We waited at the empty table we found for a few minutes before she came to wipe it off. We pretty much new what we wanted so we were ready to go, ordered the fried green tomatoes to split and then I ordered the Eggs Betty and he ordered the Fried chicken platter with fried okra. The place got pretty crowded after we sat down so the food took a bit. I was super excited to try their biscuits and berry preserve but, the server never brought them by! 

Our fried green tomatoes came out, yum!!! The bf loved the goat cheese grits even though he hates goat cheese normally..shhhh I didn't tell him. Very creamy, delish. The actual tomatoes were fried to perfection with the perfect amount of batter but, a little too thick of a tomato slice. Still very good with the flavorful red pepper coolie. I couldn't help myself after we finished the fried green tomatoes and asked the server to bring out the complimentary biscuits and preserves everyone else but us received (docked a star). I'm so glad I did because they were so good! Buttery, flaky goodness! The preserves are spot on! They have blackberry but you can also buy to take home and they have strawberry and blueberry preserves as well. This would be perfect if served with honey butter or something. 

The entrees! I was already full at this point so its just nibbling from here on out. My Eggs Betty included the most perfect poached eggs I've ever tasted, wonderfully runny! YUMM! The potato cracklins were super crispy but, needed some seasoning. All in all great entree that will for sure leave you in food coma status. The bf scarfed his fried chicken down, I didn't even get try try any lol. But, his fried okra side was perfect! Not too heavily battered but, still very crispy and extra fresh! I will be getting these next time. 

The server took her time bringing the check out, we were basically sitting there for 30 minutes after we finished eating. She was nice but, needs to be a tad more organized for weekend brunch, I'm sure it can get stressful if you aren't on top of it."}
{"text":"Just had a fabulous lunch! Everything was delicious--only surpassed by our server--Bailey! Great service and great food. A must restaurant visit"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for Tupelo Honey:/ Perhaps, the Brunch crowd and fast pace compromised the food quality. I ordered the steak /eggs also ordered a small dish of mac n cheese..solely based on the reviews. The steak was well cooked but it arrived like warm. There's a bourbon bacon sauce paired with the steak-phenomenal.  I'd say the mac n cheese has awesome texture and richness. Honestly, this was a good meal but I expected much better. Lastly the server was pleasant and knowledgeable. Love the decor and pet friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Had an amazing Easter brunch and some of the most fantastic table service ever from Jonathan!  Fried Green Tomatoes and Banana Pudding are highly recommended."}
{"text":"Visited this wonderful restaurant this morning. Waited for 30 min for a table but it was worth it! 
Food was amazing! And Jonathan was great. Love his passion and knowledge about the menu and the restaurant- he even gave us some suggestion on what to do in Charlotte while visiting.
Omelettes should come with home fries or something else other than bread. The portions need to be bigger - come on! It is southern good for God sake !"}
{"text":"There is a Tupelo Honey restaurant in Knoxville, TN that is one of my favorites. This Charlotte one just fell short of my expectations. We went on Friday night around 6:30-7:00pm, and the restaurant wasn't crowded at all. That was our first clue. 
The food we ordered was just okay. The brussel sprouts and hominy was ruined by the overpowering horseradish taste, the macaroni and cheese was very dry, and the biscuits weren't warm. The trout and blackened catfish we ordered were good, but the best item was the fried green tomatoes appetizer. We ordered water and the bill was over $70 with tip for 2 people. I don't think we'll be back to this location."}
{"text":"I've only ever eaten their breakfast, but it is fantastic! I'm only giving it four stars because I haven't had their lunch or dinner items. I don't ever care to, though, because I could eat their breakfast items any time of the day or week. I love making my own omelets. My fave combination is pimento cheese, red pepper, caramelized onions, and bacon. Their goat cheese grits are phenomenal and the sweet potato pancake is unreal!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here during lunch time. The food was so delicious especially the mac and cheese. We ordered specialty drinks and they were definetely strong enough to only need one each. Haley, the drinks manager was very nice and came over to talk to us. Will come again. We loved the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Definitely would go back again! Love the authenticity and creativity in cooking."}
{"text":"We had tried to go here a few times, but it seems to always be packed.  This time we decided to grab some drinks at the bar and just patiently wait for something to open up.

While we sipped on some drinks, they give you some free biscuits with honey and jelly, which are on the better end of biscuits I have had in Charlotte.

The warm pimento cheese appetizer somehow found a way to make pimento cheese better than it already was, but the Sassy Garlic Crusted Char-Grilled Chicken was the highlight.  So delicious.  Naturally we washed down the meal with their Pecan Pie, which is awesome, just like the rest of their food appears to be.

There was an odd downside to Tupelo, though.  The restaurant seemed to be populated with large groups of yuppy d-bags....I don't know if it was a weird night, or if d-bags are inherently drawn to free biscuits....

...Either way, I definitely look forward to heading back here for food and/or drinks."}
{"text":"This is a cute little cafe to have a light lunch with a Southern twist! We sat on the balcony because it was a lovely day. 

The prices are fairly reasonable. I had the sautéed jumbo shrimp with fried okra and it was very tasty. I had a bite of the Charleston chicken sandwich and that was delightful as well. 

I highly recommend the banana pudding, it was AMAZING. I'm very particular about banana pudding but it tastes just like grandma's! 

This is a great place downtown to have a nice light lunch or date night. Parking in the back is sufficient. I definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Quick and polite service. Country style atmosphere and foods. The biscuits are Amazing!! They just fall apart and melt in your mouth :) 

Best tip about this place: parking can be a challenge - especially getting in and out of the lot."}
{"text":"Tupelo Honey never disappoints!  The food and service were amazing."}
{"text":"This place has that southern comfort charm.  Menu was awesome with a variety of choices for anyone. I got a free biscuit with their amazing blueberry jam! I ordered the shrimp and grits which were great, but I've had better, the grits could of used a bit more flavor."}
{"text":"I'm not sure which restaurant previous reviewers dined at, but I thought Tupelo Honey was pretty great and I'm glad they're here. Yes they do use a lot of grits on their menu but they were very good. Eating out on the porch was fantastic. Casual, relaxing, very vacation-y with the string lights and the breeze. Thank you again Tupelo Honey and we'll see you soon."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere here. I've only had brunch items on the menu, and haven't been disappointed.  Some of the other food choices may be a little over priced, but I haven't tasted them. So, you'll have to be the judge. Coffee was good. They only offer regular brew. You will not find lattes here. They do have hot tea as well."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and I've never been disappointed. Be prepared for long waits around the brunch hour over the weekends, but the food is solid and they have great drinks as well."}
{"text":"Food: 5.0
Ambiance: 4.0
Food/Price: 3.5

Pros: Delicious and inventive brunch, nice ambiance
Cons: Pricey (unsure about weekend brunch reservations and service as I ate here on a Monday morning)

Food
The brunch selection (I've at least sampled almost all of it) is consistently top shelf at every location, whether you're in the mood for something  \"traditional\" like  fried chicken over biscuits (or fried chicken over sweet potatoes pancakes, or just two pieces of fried chicken languishing on top of on another... they really will just throw fried chicken on anything) or something with more of a southern foodie flare like omelets stuffed with fried green tomatoes and pimento cheese, this place will not disappoint. However, you do pay for the quality.

Ambiance
The above section applies consistently to all locations I've eaten at but the ambiance can vary quite a bit. The Raleigh location has a very \"Raleigh\" vibe; clean, warm, straight lines  doesn't want to rock the boat, absolutely nothing to complain about. But it lacks the spacious and inviting veranda of Charlotte and the somewhat charming somewhat maddening \"coziness\" of the Asheville location. Charlotte's inside and outside are both far more spacious than the other locations and the beautiful veranda in Charlotte manages to exude coziness and openness simultaneously, by far my favorite location. They have their own parking lot with plenty of spaces and we had no trouble parking. They are on the second floor and even have an elevator.

Bottom line: A must eat brunch spot in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Our party of 5 just had brunch here. Thankfully we had a reservation, or we never would have gotten in. The service was meh. Our glasses ran dry, and our server only checked on us once after our food was delivered. Our meals were good but not great. I just don't get the hype for this place. It was not outstanding, the seating is very crowded, parking is a joke, and the prices are crazy."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the service is always incredible!   My fiancé and I love everything here, especially the biscuits. Brittany was a fantastic waitress!  We ordered the salmon and curried chicken and both were awesome.  The sides are good too!"}
{"text":"Great service from Emma and team! Delicious food and great atmosphere on the outdoor patio/balcony."}
{"text":"Great biscuits. Great honey. Service was wonderful. A bit noisy but overall a very good bruch today."}
{"text":"Amazing biscuits. Great fried chicken over a sweet potato pancake with pecans. It was probably the best friend chicken I'd ever had."}
{"text":"I always want to like Tupelo Honey, but leave somewhat unimpressed. 

Their biscuits with jam and honey are killer, but I wished my fried pickle and pimento cheese burger had more than 3 fried pickle slices on it, it was hard to even taste. They did cook it to a perfect medium, though. Fries could use a little more salt/flavor. 

Also, the brunch entrées seemed a little small, so I definitely recommend getting a starter to share."}
{"text":"Best biscuit I had in Charlotte, hands down. It's was fluffy and buttery with a hint of salt. Plus, that blueberry jam is to die for (and free!!).

I got the eggs betty with asparagus. My egg was a touch over cooked, the asparagus was well made and of course, it had a lovely biscuit to soak up and egg bits. The goat cheese grits were missing the tangy bite I pictured when I saw goat cheese. Besides that, the grits weren't thick and creamy enough for me.

We shared the crispy grit cakes which had a fantastic texture and was very tasty without being overly greasy. The salsa on the side was a week thought out accompaniment.

My coffee was very good, with a lower acidity than most places (so you don't get that nasty after taste).

While I'm used to waiting long lines for brunch, this place was really pretty packed to the gills. However, service was lovely ask around."}
{"text":"Other than the sweet waitress, the experience was less than stellar.  High priced food was quite average.  The waitress acknowledged the chef is new and still being trained (including by her, I should mention).  The manager was kind, asked specifically how my salad was, and comped it when I truthfully told him it was not great.  It was a disappointing experience and I'm not sure I'll ever go back.  Too many other options."}
{"text":"For some reason, I always go here with a big group and we ALWAYS have great service and excellent food. I must say, though, the drinks are amazing! I love the changing menu and the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Disappointing at best. Service was really slow, and the value for the money was just not there. The food did have good flavor, but the value made it very disappointing."}
{"text":"Had green fried tomatoes, that was served over goat cheese grits and roasted red peppers coulis. The grits made the dish, creamy and tasty. 

Then we had farmers cheese , aleppo pepper , red chili honey drizzle , on rustic toasted bread.  The bread and cheese mixture was delicious. 

All meals come with buttermilk biscuits. It's served with honey and jam.  The biscuits were warm ; soft on the inside and firm on the outside.  They were fabulous.  

My meal was the slow roasted blackberry habanero pull pork stacked atop of a pasture raised beef patty. It came with a side of pork belly collards. The pull pork was good, but had some fat in it.  The collards greens were too salty for me."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Love the fried green tomatoes! Our server William was awesome. Definitely wil be coming back here soon!"}
{"text":"Not overwhelmed with TupeloHoneyCafe.  Was expecting so much more since reading rave reviews since moving to Charlotte 4 months ago.  Ordered their fan favorite fried chicken and found it to be overcooked nearly burnt, dry and lacking flavor.  The favorite egg rolls also were disappointing as they were not served temperature hot.  Two orders of club soda cocktails at the bar were returned due to being flat.  
Won't be returning nor recommending THC.  We'll let the locals continue to think they are eating fantastic food and thinking the long waits are worth it--Not."}
{"text":"Service was absolutely awful. It's a shame cause the foods so dang good. 

We went Sunday for brunch and were quoted an hour to get seated and after a half hour or so we asked the hostess how much longer she thought it would be and she would only tells us how much time was left on our \"quote\" and would not give us an honest answer like \"there's a few tables ahead of you, ect\". Once we were seated our table was wet and covered in cleaner, and our menus were soaking wet as well. We didn't even receive silverware. 

Waitress came over and and got a drink order, looked at our wet table and just left. Came over and dropped of the drinks and looked at us like we're crazy because we had to dry off our table and menus ourselves. When she looked us as like we were crazy we said it was because the table was covered in cleaner and our menus were wet and she said he just cleaned the table and then left. She didn't offer to get us napkins or even dry the table off. 

After she dropped off our drinks we noticed our glasses were dirty, both had frosting or cream of some sort all over them. When she came back about 5 mins later with the biscuits we had to ask her for new drinks and showed her the dirty ones and she acted as if it wasn't her problem. Once she returned with the new drinks it wasn't what we ordered and we also had to ask her for silverware. 

So as you can imagine our experience was not good to start and keeps getting worse. Our waitress acted like the issues we've had: wet table and menus, dirty glasses, no silverware, ect were a severe inconvenience to her. That being said: she decided to ignore our table from the time she brought our replacement drinks to after we were done eating. She served the tables around us but blatantly ignored us. 

We finished our food, which was pretty good, and she walked past our table on 4 occasions with our napkins and silverware on the plates on the edge of the table and wouldn't pick them up. It wasn't until the table behind us was ready to cash out she brought us checks. Once she got our card she went and rang out every other table she had before giving us back our check. 

I've been here and had really good food and service but this waitress with the pink hair made what could have been a really pleasant experience absolutely awful. Especially since Tupelo Honey is on the higher end of the price spectrum."}
{"text":"8 of us came for dinner on a Wed night around 6:30; were seated at 7:00; orders taken at 7:30; food arrived at 8:15.  Staff seemed unconcerned about the wait even though the restaurant did not seem that busy (empty tables, no big parties).  Rarely saw our waitress.  Food was okay but nothing special really.  Had the \"bottomless\" Mac and cheese...greasy clumps of noodles, cheese and veggies... seemed plopped in a bowl.  Others at our table left food on their plates...pretty blah stuff.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Awesome place ! May the force be with you !  The food was excellent the waiter was excellent the prices are just too high."}
{"text":"If you are coming here for your momma's southern cooking, then you have come to the wrong place, but if you have come here for your momma's cooking meets artisan flavors and the new southern twist you are at the right spot.

I ordered the Texas toast grilled cheese, Havarti and Pimento cheese, with a bowl of tomato soup. For some reason this dish was screaming at me. I am really not that much of a fan of the tomato soup thing, but it goes with grilled cheese so well.  

G ordered the hamburger (well done) with the side of mac n cheese. 

While we were waiting for our order, they brought out what could have been the star of the show. The amazing drop biscuit. This is not your cookie cutter biscuit. Its buttery, cheesy, a little salty, with just a hint of rosemary. Oh I want to jump in a tub of these delicious bundles of heavenliness.  They also bring you the honey and that jam, damn the jam....why are you so good. You just know they have some grandma's in the back making this jam. It taste just like homemade jam. Did I mention the jam???  

Ok, now back to the food.  It did seem that the food did take a bit longer than what I would have expected to arrive. The restaurant was not extremely busy, so it seemed odd. We were in no rush, except for the food, and since we have no issues with conversation it was all good. While waiting I ordered the blueberry punch. It was so refreshing and tasted like it could have been an beverage that would have been a great mix of flavors to go with vodka. I'm so old that I remember when vodka did not come in flavors. It was just vodka. You had to flavor it yourself. 

The meal came and the presentation was really nice.  G bit into his hamburger immediately and said it was great. I did try a bite and I agreed, even though it was well done, they somehow were able to keep it juicy. He also had the side of Mac n Cheese and this is where momma's Mac n Cheese goes rogue. This side had some kick. It was pumped up with peppery goodness.
The only thing this side was missing was the crusty cheesy top that you usually get when you order Mac n Cheese. This side was definitely a new twist on an old favorite. There was also a side salad which was very fresh and colorful. It was topped with sunflower seeds and two of their dressing to try. Next was to dig into my amped up grilled cheese sandwich. The bread was hot and toasty and buttery. The hot inside Havarti and Pimento Cheese was oozing out, a cheesy perfection of a sandwich. I was trying to figure out how to duplicate this at home. Now the tomato soup. It was creamy, but not your typical Campbells retro creamy stuff. This soup had little bits and pieces of tomato in the soup. The soup was hot and amazing and wait, I don't even like tomato soup but this was so good. They give you such a large bowl there is no finishing the soup unless your just ravenous. I did find room for all of the sandwich. Not a crumb left on the plate.

I would be giving this visit 5 stars, but the wait time for the food was a bit on the lengthy side.
Did I mention the biscuit and jam? Just go for drinks and biscuits and life will be perfect, or at least seem that way."}
{"text":"food was very very good.  Service was very very good.  I just thought it was a little overpriced.  $15 for an omelette seems a little much but worth it now and again."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on st pattys day! Food and service was amazing. Armando, our server was awesome. We ordered the chicken fried steak and huecos rancheros. The gravy on the fried steak was so tasty! The huevos rancheros were on point also. I love that it came with traditional corn tortillas. They were busy but with a view to the open kitchen you could tell they were killing it. Awesome brunch!!"}
{"text":"They have a unique and amazing menu of modern southern food, and they source locally!!  Their patio is eclectic and adorable.  I can't wait to go back for brunch!  This will be a staple for entertaining company and date days and nights!"}
{"text":"Sweet potato pancake is delish! Also location & atmosphere is on point. Oh and the bread they give you while you wait! Yummmm."}
{"text":"Loved.. Loved this place.. I don't like pancakes but the sweet potato pancakes were to die for and topped with a fried chicken amazing..."}
{"text":"We are out of town guests and went to Tupelo for the first time. It was great! We were able to call the night before and get our reservation moved up (thanks!!). We were seated almost immediately and Jameson was our waiter. He was fabulous!! Super friendly and very accommodating to all of our requests. The service, plus the delicious food, definitely warrants 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Such a cute and unique place! My favorite thing was the atmosphere and the complimentary biscuits & jam! Service was great and everyone is super friendly. Definitely recommending this to friends & family. The location is great too, husband and I walked here after we went through the Gallery Crawl in South End. Very easy to park and walk around!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. We originally went to the Myrtle Beach location and we loved it. The food and atmosphere were both great. We stopped on our way through Charolette and I felt like we were at a Cracker Barrel. The food was not fresh and neither of our dishes had much flavor. It's amazing the difference in locations."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant! I've been here twice in the last week and can't wait until my next visit. I always have such a tough time deciding what to order because it all sounds so good. 
The food both times has been superb and service is amazing. Today our server was Jonathan and he was so friendly and helpful. Easily one of the best serving experiences I've experienced in quite a while."}
{"text":"Let me first say that Tupelo is one of my favorite places however, this location did not compare to their Asheville store. It's hard when a restaurant expands with various locations. Our server Iris was A-Mazing! Kudos to her!!! She was so friendly and spot on! She knew her products well and had such a chipper attitude. She was from Ohio but struck me as a Georgia Peach! We really enjoyed her company! She brought extra sauces and napkins without us asking. We orders what we normally order at the Asheville store....pimento cheese dip, wings and fried green tomatoes. We wanted to order potato cracklins but they said it would take an hour (since they just opened) so we ordered chips which we're just ok. Right after our food hit the table here comes Iris with an order of cracklins on the house. They were done sooner than they thought and boy were they good. Smashed potatoes deep fried...oh man! So, the wings were good but not as good as we remember from previous visits also the pimento cheese dip taste like it had grain mustard in it which I don't remember. It was a strong taste that we both didn't prefer. The tomatoes were good but needed salt also the grit bed needed more flavor. The ranch had a garlic hint to it and wasn't great but the blue cheese was chunky and on point. 
I forgot to mention my Bloody Mary- they make their own mix and it is so good! The pepper rim is to die for. So all in all it was a $48 lunch and felt more like it should have been $20. I feel a bit jipped to be honest. Not what I know Tupelo to be!"}
{"text":"Oh, THC, How I (used to) love thee.

Don't trip out, I still love THC.  But the restaurant needs work.  If you've ever visited the (What I believe to be) original location in Asheville, you know why this place deserved the hype and long lines when first adding a location in the QC.

A new restaurant with a big following/fan-base, is bound to have issues with service, wait times, and some food items not coming out right.  However this place has had years to fix their issues and they just seem complacent in providing 2 star service and 3 star food at 5 star prices.

I live to eat, not eat to live, so I'm cool with dropping a pretty-penny on brunch, lunch, pretty much any unch.  But none of our most recent trips here have been enjoyable/worth the spend.

I hope they fix their issues with service and food being delivered in a timely fashion whilst accurately portraying what was depicted in the menu.  I'd like this place to survive but service is king, especially in the queen city - there are better places to leave my 30%."}
{"text":"Dont get the weird bloody mary, otherwise great food"}
{"text":"The food was so good this is what is left over! Amazing lunch and such a great menu! The service and and the atmosphere are amazing. Southern seafood Fish tacos were amazing! The tupelo farm fresh burger was amazing! I had the fried chicken and I loved it with the mac & cheese with it omg! The desserts were so very good , cheesecake, brownie and banana pudding were to die for! Ask for Patrick b/c our server was so wonderful!"}
{"text":"I ordered the pimento cheese and fried pickle burger with a side of fries. I asked for the patty to be cooked medium and got well done. The fries were cold and could have used some seasoning . Really disappointed that a place like Tupelo Honey would serve a burger like that. My friends ordered the fried chicken sandwich and said the chicken was extremely dry. Not sure what happened but the food served to us that night did not live up to the hype Tupelo is known for. I don't know if I want to come back."}
{"text":"Dined there this afternoon with a friend and I was very pleasantly surprised! William was a great server and offered wonderful suggestions for drinks and food that did not disappoint. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Great for Brunch! Stay away from the gumbo! Brussels are delish and some on the beat shrimp and grits. I hate the stars, there is an evaluator. Just irritates me! Enjoyed there mimosa and a special frozen rose which I don't believe they always s have!"}
{"text":"This is another totally overrated location. I feel like Charlotteans are so desperate for a fine dining location that they settle for literally anything. 

The food here is as bland as it gets. They frill it up with some upper crust name and hike the price but it tastes awful. The location is misery to get to and parking is always full. It is simply not worth the experience. I would rather eat at the gas station across the street on the corner. The food is cheaper and tastes better."}
{"text":"I went here for brunch today with my networking group as we have brunch every month.This was my first time at Tupelo Honey cafe and I will definitely return. The unexpected appetizer and fresh made biscuits before the meal was a plus. I ordered the goat cheese shrimp and grits with the roasted red pepper sauce. This meal had a great balance of goat cheese flavor and the spicy red pepper. Other women in my group ordered different things such as the sweet potato pancakes amongst others and everyone said that the food was good. My only issue was that we had 2 waiters for a large group and we still had to keep asking them for things such as napkins, extra plates, or things that we had already ordered."}
{"text":"Late Sunday dinner/snack and drinks. I heard good things about this place, so was looking forward to the experience. Biscuits with honey before our meal were awesome... really flakey and fresh! The Mac and Cheese was A-OK... the drinks were nothing to write home about...overall it was a good experience once I was able to find the entrance (completely blocked due to construction). I might come back if I am in the area again."}
