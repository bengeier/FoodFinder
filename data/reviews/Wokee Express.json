{"text":"Ran across Wokee Express while looking for lunch spot. It appears that it's a new restaurant, as there's no menu visable until you're standing at the counter where they've got the paper menu laminated. Simple menu, inexpensive for type of food ($5 for bowls, $6.50 for combo), so I would consider coming in again. Food wasn't terrific (I tried Kung Pao chicken) but wasn't terrible either. I will try something else next time."}
{"text":"I Looked on line at reviews and they all said good food. They had 4 stars. I would have not even given one if you could. Apparently who ever said this was good Chinese Food must like dog food also !!!! We ordered Egg Foo Yong, Mongolian Beef, and Crab Puffs. Paid thirty dollars and it is all in the garbage. ABSOLUTLY  WORST CHINESE FOOD. Would not recommend ever. First time and last time I will ever go there. Disgusting !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wokee Express is a pretty good restaurant as long as you accept the limitations of what it is.  At it's core, it's a fast food Chinese restaurant competing against the likes of Panda Express.  There's hardly any competition, actually.  Wokee Express is better in every possible way than Panda Express; exponentially better food, faster service, and similar prices.  Did I mention the food is better.  It is.  Much better.  Still, it's tempting to compare this against something like Taste of China and then Wokee Express suffers.  The food may be good, but it's also very simple.  The Mongolian Beef, for instance, is pretty much just beef, onions, and sauce.  It's perfectly fine for fast food but not up to snuff if you want something to savor.  The ambiance is very fast food-like, as well.  Yes, there are tables (surprisingly many) but there's no menus (order up front), the utensils are plastic and the dishes arrive in Styrofoam take-up containers.  Want a very quick Chinese lunch with tasty fresh food?  Wokee Express fits the bill.  Want a little bit more?  Keep moving."}
{"text":"I called this restaurant and asked if they delivered. The response: \"No!\"  *CLICK*.  They hung up on me. I ordered food from elsewhere.  About a week later, I decided to give them a second chance. It was a disappointment.  The food was mostly just blah -- neither good nor bad. It satisfied our hunger but had little taste.  And while we ate our not-so-pleasant food, we got to listen to: the floor-shaking loud music from the dance school next door, and a discussion about how few soy sauce packets customers could have in their take-out bags.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"The sign on the door says made fresh... and they weren't lying. My food was delicious, hot, and definitely fresh. Looks like I found the only good Chinese food in Gilbert. I can stop looking now!"}
{"text":"Last time I was here I ordered the sesame chicken and scallop beef. I enjoyed the sesame chicken and the only thing that I didn't like about the scallops and beef where the scallops where just plain. Make sure if you pay with your ATM card they don't use it as credit like they did with me when I asked for debit so I wouldn't get charged credit card fees."}
{"text":"Been coming here for probably over 15 YEARS!  The lady knows us by name and recognizes our voices over the phone. She's the best. The food is simple Chinese, nothing over the top nothing special. Just plain good, healthy and made to order. They have amazing egg rolls and OMG the crab puffs   Don't forget to order wonton chips. They're a great snack with sweet and sour sauce !"}
{"text":"Pretty good chinese food, and have been going there for years. Owners are very friendly. They cook everything fresh. Sweet and sour chicken and wontons are a couple of our favorites."}
{"text":"I have tried many places and this is the best food in town! The house chow main is the best! The portions are huge so you get some leftover!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese place in the entire Phoenix area. They have great prices and they give great portions. They are cheap quick and have quality food. I usually get either the Mongolian beef or sesimie (sp) chicken, along with an order of crab puffs.For those of you who like spicy make sure to ask for the hot sauce and be ginger with it because it will destroy most people."}
{"text":"This place is fast, and very delicious!  I had ordered take out here about 4 or 5 times now.  They advertise on their to-go menu, \"IT'S THE BEST, HEALTHY, ALWAYS FRESH!\".  The last time I ordered here, I had asked if they use MSG in there food.  They said that the oyster sauce they used contained MSG and was present in the beef chow mein and the kung pao I had ordered.  I understand many restaurants have been known to use MSG in their food, but how can they advertise as \"HEALTHY\" if if they use an ingredient widely known to cause medical issues like migraines or permanent brain damage?"}
{"text":"My fiancé always wants to try new food. Tonight he had a craving and found we had this restaurant close to our home. In my opinion it was the worst food I have ever tasted. My fiancé also felt the same way. I got sweet and sour chicken and beef chow mein the beef in the chow mein was very chewy that I couldn't even fully chew it and swallow it. The noodles were very sticky as if they were left in water and dried. The fried rice (if that's what you would call it) was regular rice but was stuck together. No flavor at all. Very unhappy with this place and will not be returning. Spending $24.00 on 2 plates that had to be tossed. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Crab puffs are ok, large portion size. I had the orange chicken, pepper stake, and Mongolian beef...i didn't care for any of it. Tastes like boiled meat...i would rather have a less and better than large and have to throw the rest a way. I won't be going back and I would not recommend it! 2 stars because the crab puffs are ok, the fish tank is cool, and the people are very nice. Sad...so many good places in the area too."}
{"text":"Great place for fast Chinese food. Always fresh but quick service. One of my favorite places to go for local Chinese food. I keep it simple with orange chicken. Sometimes spicy or Teriyaki chicken. Also not expensive."}
{"text":"The place is overall pretty good. I have tried multiple items. Most of them are really tasty and they customize very well.  The only two thing that didn't sit too well is that the lo mein was very, how do I put this, mushy.  That may be a personal preference choice as I'm an \"al dente\" kind of person. But I'll keep coming back. There are plenty of other good items."}
{"text":"Loved the staff, very kind and accommodating. My little one is picky so we had to create a noodle bowl for her, the staff helped us.  I had beef and broccoli bowl with brown rice. The rice was undercooked but the rest of it was good! My hubby had a spicy bowl (I forget the name of it)  and he really liked it. The spring rolls were delicious! Great location too, you can walk around the San Tan Village mall afterward. Not the best good I've ever eaten, but 4 stars for nice staff, cleanliness and Overall good experience."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and tasty food! My boyfriend LOVES hot&sour soup and says this place \"does it right\".  I would also recommend the shrimp and vegetable and any of their appetizers!"}
{"text":"I went to Wokee Express tonight, per my friend's suggestion. If I'm craving Chinese food, I typically go to Taste Of China. However, I wanted to try something different, so I asked around, and was directed to Wokee Express.  The price of the food is great. At dinner, I got a large chicken plate combo. \"Combo\" means it comes with rice, egg roll, and crab puff. All of this only cost $7.75.  However, the chicken was over-cooked, and the batter the chicken was fried in was soggy and mushy. There were no carrots or peas in the fried rice, which is a huge deal to me for some reason.  So overall, if you're on a budget and want some good Chinese food, go to Taste Of China."}
{"text":"This place was really pretty good. Food served take-out style in styro containers, but it is quite tasty, and huge portions. Working in Gilbert, it seems really hard to find good Chinese food for lunch, and this fits the bill perfectly. While it may not be perfect in terms of culinary execution, it is definitely tasty and I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I've been there several times trying various menu items and all have been good. The Chicken Fried Rice (I always start with this on my 1st time in) was flavorful and had lots of chicken and vegetables. I have moved on to Pepper Steak and Mongolian Beef and a few others and they have all been quite tasty."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! There's a reason the rating is god awful. I tried to give them a chance and all I got was disrespect, pushy terrible service (actually lack of any) and greasy tasteless food!  I waited over 25 minutes for some \"spicy chicken wings\" that should only take 10 minutes to cook if that. I came home with the order to open a greasy box of fried sauce-less wings with no spice or flavor whatsoever! I called the restaurant to explain my frustrations and all the lady did was argue! I asked for a refund and she hung up on me. I called back and they hung up again. Is that how you operate a business? Disgust, disrespect, and bland food?   Let me tell you..the customer is NOT always right but you should try to respect their opinion.  We are not children at your dinner table.   If you want to try some bland Chinese food brought to you by the worst service in the East Valley by all means pull up a chair to this hole in the wall. I'm sure their doors will be closing soon."}
{"text":"Short and sweet........ no, not a Chinese dish. my review Good food, consistent quality, very good portions, amazing house fried rice you got to try it. offers healthy brown rice. Twice a week or more, much healthier than burgers and fries."}
{"text":"Dirty restaurant. Last time I went, my food all smelled and tasted fishy. They do have good portion sizes."}
{"text":"It's not my favorite. I decided to stop in as a quick stop on the way home and almost immediately walked out. It doesn't appear or smell the cleanest. We ordered fried rice and wontons, as that seemed a safe choice. Wrong. We won't be making this decision again."}
{"text":"The food is great, but the service is horrible. The lady at the front is very rude and abrupt I get the same item every time I come but it rings up as different prices. I ate in, bringing a coffee from outside there are no signs claiming to not bring in outside drinks, and she very rudely told me they are not allowed and that I can't bring it in next time."}
{"text":"Their Pork/House fried rice is awesome! A must have. The regular fried rice sucks. Tried a few items. The Sweet and Sour doesn't disappoint. The Mongolian beef was tender but a little bland. They have great Crab Puffs. Go here for the appetizers. They rock. Main courses... meh."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was little. My family always get take out. The food is always so good and always made to order. Today I ate in and the store is basic but really clean and refreshing. They have a cute fish tank that is also really clean. The TV isn't overly loud and they have the news playing, which is nice. Best Chinese food in Gilbert!  I got the orange chicken combo with a large drink for less than $9.00!! Amazing."}
{"text":"Really surprised at the reviews for this place. We usually order from King Wok but decided to give this place a try since it's closer. We really wanted to like the food after talking to the person on the phone she was very patient and informative. ( IE: you can mix any 2 entrees on the special. It doesn't have to be the pairings listed) The lady who helped us when we picked up the food was very nice too. I forgot to order white rice and their fried rice is plain. I did not like the eggrolls. The food was just meh. I much prefer King Wok. :/"}
{"text":"In a word, YUMMY!  You wil not leave the table hungry either. Great value, and quality food. Been coming here since they opened. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Went in for the first time grabbed a pepper steak bowl. Pretty decently portioned for 5.25, and it smelled pretty good too. It's nice but I thought it could use more kick? I don't know I thought a pepper bowl would at least be a tad bit spicy. But it felt more like eating Mongolian beef? Maybe I'm just being stupid because the pepper bowl came with bell peppers haha. Overall the food as A-OK!"}
{"text":"am typing this as i am eating my Wokee Express lunch combo.. it's so delicious it deserves a review ASAP!  MUCH MUCH MUCH better than Panda Express..  Wokee Express doesnt taste perserved, although i dont know if they use MSG.. i shld have asked..  i ordered the orange chicken lunch combo with white rice instead of their fried ( was just in the mood for white rice) and got it in a jiffy  (means less than 10 minutes)  the crab puff that comes with the combo was really good.. although the egg roll was kinda weird-- in many of my reviews i said i hate and dont eat egg rolls.. but i just have to give them a chance  so i only had ONE BITE!!! it tasted like it has seasoning of some sort.. interesting taste, but like i said i dont like egg rolls..  the Orange chicken was really good.. did taste orangey unlike panda express and other chinese american chains they dont taste like orange.. So Wokee Express hit the spot.. Orange chicken is orange chicken.. very good!!   Lunch special combo was $5.25 or $5.75  worth every cent!  I love dumplings but next time... ( i wonder how it tastes though, i bet it wld be good here 10 dumplings for $6.75 i think.. not bad)  ill be back! i also want to try Yoko Fast Food too..  BTW they are open everyday except 3-4:30 as posted on their MENU .. its their lunch break.. Just so you know.."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I didn't read anything about the smell that sucker punches you right in the kisser when you walk in.  Maybe it's the fish tank. Hopefully it's not the kitchen.  Ordered a #5 (Kung pao chicken and beef chow mein), Crab puffs, and Mongolian beef. Very friendly gal behind the counter that was helpful with some of her favor suggestions from the menu.   Crab puffs = very good Egg roll = tasted like cinnamon  (too much 5-spice? ) Beef chow mein = very good. Would order again. Kung Pao Chicken = didn't taste like Kung pao except for the peanuts, but it was a spicy and tasty dish.  Mongolian beef = very bland.  Would not order again."}
