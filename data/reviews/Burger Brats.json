{"text":"Went here after work with a burger craving and was not disappointed! The burger was fresh and had great flavor. The sweet potato fries were fantastic and the service was outstanding. The guy who took our order was extremely friendly and was very knowledgeable about the menu and the food. When he came to check on us during our meal, he explained that everything is made on site and fresh - never frozen. I love supporting this kind of local business!"}
{"text":"Going to Burger Brats is like being invited over to your friends' place for lunch or dinner that happens to make really good burgers, they use fresh local ingredients, and I have found the quality to be consistent and great. The burgers are made to order so you may find yourself waiting 5 or 10 minutes depending on how busy they are, but the wait is definitely worth it. The fries are fresh cut so I'm not sure how you would make them better. I agree the menu can be a little overwhelming to take in, (it's hand written on an eraser board), and the ambiance is more that of a takeaway place than a sit down restaurant. I've noticed the owner out front talking to customers many times asking how everything was and he's always open to any suggestions you may have. I'm definitely a fan and I think they have the right attitude and tasty burgers to make it in this over saturated burger market. :)"}
{"text":"Heard of this place from Teambuy doing a promo for them a while back and wanted to give it a try. Was walking around and found it hidden downstairs. Tried their 'Great Canadian Hangover' which consist of triple patty, triple cheese, 2 peameal bacon, grilled onion and mushroom, lettuce, tomato, secret sauce and a fried egg.  Decent burger, but not the best. The thickness of the meat is nice, but not moist and juicy for the burger. Considering this is their signature! I wouldn't mind trying other burgers and maybe their shakes one day."}
{"text":"I would've never even known this place existed until I purchased a group coupon for it. The food was pretty good. A bit pricey, but I think worth the price. I had the mushroom swiss burger (on toasted bread). The flavours were delicious, nothing too overpowering. I don't like my burger as charred as it came, but the people I was with loved the flavour. Try the Angry Texan (grilled cheese bun and peameal bacon!) We will be back for the Hangover."}
{"text":"I heard some friends talking about this place so I figured I'd check it out. I had a malt milkshake, regular burger, and fries. Everything here was great and the owner is super nice too. This place is kind of on the pricey side but you do get what you pay for. I wouldn't say that this was my absolute favourite burger joint but I would definitely come back if i'm ever in the area again."}
{"text":"I ate here on my lunch break and it was surprisingly quiet. Only three other tables were taken and there wasn't much going on in terms of takeout.  After eating here, I would have to assume it's because there is so much competition in the immediate area, especially during the lunch hour.  I ordered the classic burger with cheese and bacon because it was the special of the day (the sign on the street lured me in). Good quality and good taste. The best part: the burger wasn't falling apart in my hands.  The literature on the tables says the beef is Ontario AAA, fresh and never frozen, and the burgers are made to order.  Free refills on fountain drinks. And you can call ahead to arrange for pick-up.  The staff was friendly and the guy behind the counter was helpful as I was trying to figure out what to order.  If beef isn't your thing, they have veggie burgers and chicken burgers.  Will be back for another try."}
{"text":"UPDATE: either the food has changed, or my perception has. This time the (Classic) burger was really good, with a nice balance of meat and toppings. I didn't notice any lettuce on this one. The bun had a good, meal-y quality to it - nicer than the everyday white hamburger buns most places use. The fries were nicely browned, and generously salted. No Coke Zero :-(  The staff deserve a mention for offering excellent service - very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I went during an odd hour so it was dead. Turnaround was 10 mins, ordered the Firehouse, which was pretty solid. If you like spice, it's not spicy at all, but still delicious. Although I think they forgot to put the $1 avocado on. Either that or it was a small amount. I'll be back since it's the best burger spot closest to me."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place by chance a few weeks ago and went there several times since then. I like to try things that I can't get anywhere else and they have several things in that category.  I'm not a burger person, so I tried their tex mex fries, chilli fries, sweet potato fries, and poutine. The fries are beautifully cooked no matter which way you order it, and all the toppings are flavourful and tasty. My only con was that the ground beef in the chilli/tex mex fries was a little dry for my preference. Other than that, they are the best fries I've had anywhere ever.  I tried the malt chocolate milkshake another time and it was not too thick, and not too runny. Would be great it they had a smaller size available so that you feel less guilty after indulging... I tried the \"veggie-less\" smoke shack burger the last time I went there and enjoyed the flavour and texture combination. The patty was well cooked/just juicy enough and the onion rings added a slight crisp to the whole thing. It was pretty good, but again, I'm not a burger person so don't take my word for it...  I would definitely recommend BB to anyone who wants to have premium quality food made with fresh ingredients, and also anyone who believes in supporting businesses that buy from local sources. Don't let any of the appearance mislead you: this is a serious joint with serious food."}
{"text":"I really had my hopes crushed at this place, The fact that I constantly raved about it to my boyfriend, made me that much more embarrassed. This restaurant is in a basement type location, and it shows. It smells of complete mold! It was almost sickening. The bathroom will make you actually puke. I've never seen a bathroom as dirty as this one. The food here is definitely overpriced. I ordered a chipotle burger. Terrible...it was the sweetest burger I ever had. All in all I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone...ever."}
{"text":"I went a couple of nights ago with my fiance because I had a Teambuy voucher.  He had the Firehouse and I had the Mad Texan.  The Firehouse had a nice zip to it, however it could have been spicier (although I must warn I like things super spicy) - the burger was slightly pink (probably cooked to medium) which was prefect for us but I think it was an error on whoever was cooking it.  The Man Texan was HUGE and quite tasty.  We ordered the Tex Mex fries, they were just alright - I think the fries just needed some kosher salt sprinkled over them.  We also got a chocolate peanut butter milk shake which was fantastic.  I have had visions of that milk shake since.  All in all, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"You want a killer burger bursting with flavor? Go to Burger Brats. I've been going here for a little over a year now and they never let me down. I even she'd a single tear when I got the hours wrong one Sunday evening last fall.   Example: I already fell head over heels with the mushroom melt (delectable and not too filling) especially paired with the regular poutine (heaven sent by the way). These we're my dynamic duo.....UNTIL my girlfriend persuaded me to try the smokeshack......I died and went to flavor Valhalla.   Now my fav combo is the smokestack (Ranch BBQ sauce? c'mon that's what's up!!) and poutine.  Unless I want to go the extra mile and Inhale a pop tart milkshake.   Burger Brats....killer!"}
{"text":"Worst delivery experience ever. Food was served cold. They delivered small fries instead of large. And plain Coke instead of Diet Coke. Burgers look great on the menu but lack of personality."}
{"text":"GENERAL NOTES I love living in the entertainment district for the close proximity to a wide variety of tasty and cheap food. However I'm so close to so many great food places that the thought of walking further for longer than 6 minutes to get food is one that doesn't often occur to me.   Enter Burger Brats, a burger shop I can see from my window, filling the gourmet(ish) burger-sized hole that has been missing from my regular diet for the past...I dunno, while.  Fogs and I went down to check it out before their grand opening and were greeted by some very nice, very enthusiastic people. Unfortunately, the burgers are too expensive and the fries aren't great. I'm sure I'll go from time to time but the value isn't there for me. Maybe their malts are good...maybe they'll get better...or cheaper...  MENU RECOMMENDATIONS I had the mushroom melt burger which was good but severely lacking in toppings beyond those found in the name of the burger. Geoff had some other burger which was also good but not great.   I've tried the fries and the sweet potato fries. Both were disappointing. Especially the sweet potato fries. They cut them like regular fries and they're not crispy or flavourful enough for my taste.   So...try a burger?  SERVICE NOTES Very friendly staff. Open late on weekends.   LOCATION NOTES North side of Adelaide, just West of Duncan in a basement unit. I don't want to say where as it's still the best kept secret in the entertainment district but there's free parking very close to this establishment.   HUMOUROUS STORY Despite the name, they do NOT serve brats here."}
{"text":"I tried this place after I saw an article about their Hang Over burger in the paper. Needless to say that it is a very huge burger and finishing one is an accomplishment on it own.   Good: Very friendly staff.  Meh: I felt my arteries clothing after having one. The burger itself was OK tasting.   Bad: You couldn't find anything on the menu and I had to ask the staff for a burger by describing what I saw in the paper."}
{"text":"I think this place is totally underrated. The burger I got was the Adelaide. The goat cheese and maple syrup combo with the burger were absolutely amazing. very fresh meat and juicy. I would come back. The staff were really nice because I came near closing and they stayed five mins after they were closed to do what they needed and did not emphasize the closing part too heavily like other places would because everyone just wants to go home."}
{"text":"I've been striking out over the last three week trying to find a decent burger in Toronto. One place blamed the Canadian laws on giving me a chewed up over cooked pile of sadness and another place tried to reroute me to how good the fries are in Canada.  I'm not 8 stop trying to trick me!  I was sitting in an Irish pub earlier today and asked the bartender the age old question \"is there an amazing burger anywhere? Please god help me\"  OK it wasn't that extreme.   He left for a moment and handed me a local paper that oddly enough listed Toronto's 50 best burgers or something like that. I was looking at the category of \"over the top\" and the bartender was kind enough to point out most were far from where I was sitting but Burger Brats wasn't far....Ugh It was really damn far but no matter I'm a big boy and can stand to walk a few or several.  First off-The staff greeting was extremely great-friendly and willing to help.  They make a few suggestions and I went with something called the Texan-Burger, Texas toast, egg, ham, and a chipotle mayo. The combo came with fries and a drink for the low! low! price of $15.00. What?????   I often have to remind myself I'm not in Detroit and 15.00 is probably average for this type of a meal.   The food came out in about 10 minutes or so and I dove into the fries. Not too bad. Little greasy but overall decent fries.   The burger!  The Good-This may be the first burger in Canada in general that wasn't dried out and actually had a beef flavor.  It was hot-just from the grill  It was a very large burger.   The bad!  There really were just too many flavors competing and after a few bites of 1/2 the burger I really didn't want to continue and pitched it.  There were 3 slices of Texas toast which is really unnecessary and the chipotle mayo which I did like was really just too hot if you weren't prepared. These are very nominal criticisms in the grand scheme of finding a reasonable burger in Toronto.  Overall I'd go back if I thought about it but I don't think it would be something I'd have to have when visiting Toronto."}
{"text":"went here to try their october special burger last week (halloween spicy adelaide) - goat cheese, spicy bbq, jalepenos, lettuce, tomato, etc. i had the veggie version.   i gotta say, i loved this place the first time i went, so the bar was pretty high on this visit. this burger blew my mind. i don't remember the last time i ate so fast!  definitely will return. hopefully soon."}
{"text":"I have to say these burgers really blew me away, i ordered this food through just-eat and it turned out to really amazing, the burgers were really well seasoned and cooked perfectly, fresh buns, fresh toppings, it was a really perfect burger to be honest. We also ordered the poutine as well and the fries were fresh cut, crispy, the cheese curds were squeaky and plentiful, and the gravy was well seasoned and quite tasty, not your average canned gravy. On top of it all, the customer service was beyond excellent, these people really care about their product and their clients. Paul, who helped fix a small error in our order went beyond what was expected and made every effort to assure i was a happy customer. I can tell you this, i certainly was, and i'm now a patron, when it's time for burgers again, this is the only place i will consider.   Thanks guys, you were great!!"}
{"text":"Had a friend rave to me about this place. We were excited for a delicious experience but it really wasn't.   I ordered a bacon cheese burger with sweet fries and a milkshake. The milkshake was amazing. The burger - not so much. Asked for no tomato. There was tomato. Nuff said. If I can successfully mod a 2$ burger at mcdonalds why can't I mod a 10$ one here?  Extremely bland and flavorless. No seasoning detected - In desperate need of sauce. Also the meat was overlooked and dry. The sweet fries were the worst part. They were cut way to thick and were literally a pile of mush. The guy working even acknowledged they were bad - but didn't offer to throw me some regular fries instead.  After paying 18.50 for a burger fries and shake I expected it to be a lot better. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"The attitude of the staff working here sure matches the name.  My husband and I stopped by for quick lunch and I was not impressed. The girl behind the counter was snotty and arrogant when taking our order and the rest of the staff in the kitchen wasn't any better.  Girls, if you are above working in a burger joint, then go and get another job!  The menu readability is horrible. I was glad I had checked their online menu in advance.  In the end, we ordered The Great Canadian Classic with cheese and The Fire House. The burgers took quite some time to prepare and so we were left at our table freezing since the place had no heating on.  The temp was not just cool, it was ice cold. Taking off your jacket was impossible.   Finally the burgers came and they were just alright.  Not too dry, but not much flavor either. Nothing I would recommend.  I won't be back.."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers.Very friendly staff. This place definitely hit the spot."}
{"text":"Smoke Shack burger was decent, loved the flavoring and bacon balance.  The downside was it was smallsized for $5 Burger Week.  Will have to revisit after and see it the burgers measure up for value."}
{"text":"I had 2 vouchers for this place so I took a couple of friends with me. I've had better burgers, better and hotter fries. The milkshake was a disappointment; it was suppose to be chocolate explosion yet what arrived was a peanut butter explosion with a hint of chocolate. The staff were alright, not sure how excited they are to be there!  I still have one voucher to go. Maybe I'll give it away!"}
{"text":"Best Sweet Potato fries ever!  Burgers tasty but the sweet potato fries are really the thing I will remember!"}
{"text":"The place is a little hard to find, but the food is amazing. The woman at the cash was fairly unpleasant though and the milkshake (which was great) came out two thirds the way through eating my burger."}
{"text":"NOT A BURGER FAN but have had some mindblasting burgers recently (Dangerous Dan's and Earl's) so I was more than willing to try this \"new\"(in my mind) place out.  LOVE: The pictures of the burgers, and the hand drown menu (didn't realize that it was a menu at first) with details of the ingredients. The open space concept and non-dinginess...dunno why, but seems to be a rare thing these days to find a well lit (but not asylum bright) and open. The bun - it's silly but often burger buns seem so small that the patty falls out, making it a neat treat nearly impossible.  MEH: The wait. We ordered this at 12 noon and got it around 30 minutes later( I was quite time sensitive because I was on lunch).  The proportions - maybe because I was hungry already and by the time the order was ready, I was famished, counting the seconds go by to keep my mind off the stomach; and a hungry Shyni is a bi*chy Shyni.  The cashier - it was blatantly obvious it was our first time because we told her so and her response was: OH.fine - really, I expected her to roll her eyes right after the tone. Was this because we weren't good looking men looking for burgers?  She was staring blankly at us as we are miserably waiting for our food - perpetual boredom and desire to be anywhere but there, was on her face. Even at my last boring job I didn't look THAT bad (at least look occupied thinking or something!) - i felt bad for her though, food service isn't the best gig.  The price. I paid  $8 for my burger which isn't unusual but that felt a little too much considering that we were both left with something to be desired. It was not particularly outstanding in taste or filling; one of the two is required for me , when it comes to food.  No second tries on this one - there's a Hero burger close by."}
{"text":"Staff here can be considered rude and snotty.... Went here for a late night meal. Their menu is unreadable and after having indicated what toppings I wanted on my sandwich - my toppings were still wrong and loaded with MAYO after having said 3 times No mayo. Their system does not seem to ensure that toppings are added as the sandwich is being prepared. When I called back after getting home - I was told by some guy Raza that it was 4:30 in the morning. Hello you are open for business and you just took over 20 bucks from me for 2 sandwiches. If u taking folks money in the name of providing a service make sure service rendered is what was asked for."}
{"text":"Went by today at lunch a great tasting burger on a very fresh soft bun. The meat quality was excellent and the burger menu has been well thought out. In the very competitive burger market this one is quite good. They aren't making any false promises but just offering well prepared fresh food for and excellent price. I ordered a bacon cheese that was an excellent patty thick peameal bacon real cheddar cheese topped with crisp lettuce fresh tomato pickle and onion ihad the combo which included hand cut fries and a fountain drink for 11and change. A far cry from the $40 burger fry water combo I had at m:brgr a week ago. Just a better burger for a quarter the price. I will be back"}
{"text":"I believe Kate M. hit the nail on the head in her review.   Two colleagues and I had lunch there the other day. Outstanding burgers -- super fresh and delicious. I also liked that there were pictures of the burgers -- in this case, other than at fast food places, these pictures are pictures of the actual burgers, not photoshopped images of plastic burgers.  The owner came out to chat with us. Very pleasant fellow. We were impressed that he wanted our impressions on his burgers -- as he himself did the cooking.  The woman at the cash was playful and delightful...a pleasant surprise to some of the deadwood working cash registers in the city. She is a real keeper.  We are definately going back."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me, but I'm immediately turned off by food places that are located in basements. You have to go down a dark set of stairs to enter this subterranean burger joint, and it always just feels to me like I'm walking down to my doom.  Overall, the food and prices are pretty reasonable. The Hangover burger is massive, and if you order one they'll snap your picture and put you on their wall and facebook. Burgers are nice and thick, but somewhat dry. They aren't very strong in the way of sauces either. Overall, greasy, fatty goodness, but not anything particularly special.   Their fries were really good, the brown kind that are salty and unpeeled. Fair warning though - stay away from their pountine. The gravy basically tasted like thicker starch water - completely flavorless.   I recommend the shakes for a hot day!"}
{"text":"When I was working with Hot Docs at the London Tap House, I was all \"HUNGRY!\" because that's how my stomach gets sometimes. In response, my friend Graham was like \"My iPhone is telling me that there are burgers next door!\" AND THERE WAS!   Needless to say, we got our burger eating on. And here's the low down... - No fancy decor. It's kinda in a basement. Fast-food tables and chairs. Ho hum.  - Nice enthusiastic staff! - Photos of the burgers so you can SEE what you're getting yourself into! As someone who is not the best at food decision making, I found this to be very helpful! - Cherry cola in bottles! Yay! The best! - Yummy burgers. Like, very yummy! A bit on the more expensive side? Yes. Worth it? I'd say yes! But I speak only of the burgers. The fries are slightly lack luster. But I'll say it again! Good burger! Very good burger!   My guess is that during the nighttime this place is filled with club kids, but as I visited earlier in the day it wasn't busy at all! So yeah! Go if you want!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent burgers. The place is what you expect. Good burgers and fries. I also liked that they had pictures of the burgers. So yoh dobt order a monstrocity if you didnt entend too."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend this place, much better burger options in the city.  Ordered the Adelaide and a regular cheeseburger plus a side of poutine (for two of us). Burgers came squished and looking nothing like their pictures. Meat was overcooked and fell apart really easily, just like the bun. Poutine was meh; fries were not fresh and the gravy was just off.  Then to top it off, we got the runs for the rest of the night after this meal.   Never again."}
