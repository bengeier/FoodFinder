{"text":"Stumbled upon this pretty cafe when in the neighborhood. I decided to try a turmeric latte based on recommendations from the friendly staff - totally delicious! Also enjoyed the cookie dough ball. Even as a non-vegan I look forward to trying more of their offerings as a treat in the future. But it's definitely a splurge!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place in the whole city!!! Finally - a healthy, beautifully decorated, friendly place to go after my yoga classes. I am very picky about things being organic and have been searching for a place like this forever. I am obsessed with the savoury toast and the hot ginger / cranberry drink. I like how this place isn't a juice bar - I'm actually not really into juices - and instead all their drinks are super creative, colourful, healthy, delicious, refreshing drinks made from things like E3 live, spirulina, matcha, turmeric, chaga... My favourite for after yoga is the detox! Plus they have healthy vanilla milkshakes, turmeric lattes made with AMAZING nut milk, and their coffee is amazing! I've ditched the Starbucks down the road in favour of this place. As an added bonus, the staff is very friendly, the place is BEAUTIFUL inside and it just has such a warm and inviting feeling. I honestly come here 3-4 times a week. If you haven't checked this place out yet I highly recommend it!!!"}
{"text":"Totally a five star - but knocking two points off for crazy wobbly stools that are way too high for the table! Avocado toast (a millennial fave) is so good, the breakfast bar is my favourite, and their house nutmilk is amazing in everything. I do hope they change their seating situation, someone is honestly going to take a spill!"}
{"text":"They nut milk is the best I've ever had and it's all organic. I'm lactose intolerant and have been searching for a nut milk that actually tastes good in coffee. I'm totally addicted."}
{"text":"Delicious snacks and drinks but would love to see honey dropped from many items so they are vegan friendly. Would like to see nutritional information.
Would give higher rate if this was the case and if prices weren't so high."}
{"text":"Bright and clean space... more importantly, delicious snacks & beverages (homemade nut milks) that are all organic!  Thrilled they are in the neighborhood, filling a need for healthy options \"on the go\"."}
{"text":"Cute place with a great menu. I stopped in to pick up some treats for a coworker's birthday and got myself a coffee. I usually drink my coffee black due to a dairy allergy but knowing that they offer non-dairy milk, I asked for a SPLASH in my coffee. They told me it would be 50 cents - after I had spent $10... I understand charging extra for non-dairy milk in a latte or some other drink that uses much more of it, but not for a splash... They sure know how to lose a customer quickly. I certainly will not be back."}
{"text":"This is a very interesting place. There are no seats. They just have big counters. I ordered Tumeric latter and it was very good. It costs $6.50. It is expensive, but it is worth of trying it once in a while not every morning. The place was clean and stylishly decorated. They do not have any bathroom for customers, so don't drink too much."}
{"text":"My go to place for guilty free treats. cozy and their nut milk is out of this world. Hope one day they will sell the nut milk alone. Love their matcha latte and chocolate ball. Recently they added soup, good for a quick snack. Expensive place, little sitting."}
{"text":"Nutbar makes their own nut milk and incorporates that into their hot drinks. It's a very unique taste that both confused my tastebuds and made sparks fly! Using their own homemade milk definitely sets them apart from their competitors. Tumeric latte was A+. And matcha latte was a little raw and earthy tasting to me! Regular cup Coffee was AMAZING Though!"}
{"text":"I've recently discovered a few things about my stomach: it no longer can tolerate milk very well, and many milk substitutes, and it won't drink coffee, decaf or caffeinated.

UGH.

In my search for a satisfying hot beverage that isn't tea, I have found a new appreciate for turmeric lattes. I tried the gold latte at Cafe M, which was good, and then set out to Nutbar as they have their own homemade milk substitute. 

The cons: slooooowwww moving. Expensive AF.

But the latte was delicious and didn't upset my stomach at all. My fianc√© and I shared an acai \"bowl\" (cup) and it was good, definitely need to share as it's a bit monotonous. I would 100% go back for the turmeric latte, but maybe that's the only item I would order."}
{"text":"On point, on fleek, shit's lit AF. Great vibe - good doses of Rosedale chic and hipster barista. Great food - good doses between the health-conscious food guru and the delicious gluttonous delicatessen"}
{"text":"Meh. Not a horrible experience and their cups give them a whole extra star. Had a matcha latte and tried the chai latte--not a fan of their milk at all, and I love nut milks. I had the summer special Dragon Fruit ice thing which was okay, but didn't have nearly enough granola and was too sweet. Also tried the supersuperseed ball which I enjoyed but would have preferred no berries. My friends both had avocado toast which they mentioned was small but didn't comment on the taste. Was a fine experience but wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been twice and have tried the acai bowl, vanilla smoothie, drip coffee and the Sweet Toast.  Everything was delicious and will definitely come back to try more items on the menu. My only reason for giving this place 4 stars instead of 5 is that the portions are way too small.  The toast is like 1/2-3/4 the size of a normal piece of bread.  This place is dubbed a \"Snack Bar\" so perhaps I have gone here too hungry on both accounts :)"}
{"text":"Good place for an afternoon snack. Very creative drink menu. The service is okay too. 
It's super expensive though and nutrition facts aren't available for their menu. 
It's okay but I'm not impressed."}
{"text":"I was in the neighbourhood so I checked out nutbar as per the Yelp community! Its located at the corner of the intersection and below the ground. It is a lot smaller than expected and not the type of cafe to sit and chat with your friends as there are not that many seats at all. The barista isn't as welcoming as other cafes I've visited. It seemed like she just wanted me to order and that was it. I ordered the nutbar latte and to be honest it was good but not something I would get again, especially the price."}
{"text":"4 stars for a small, cute, and clean spot that has extra bells and whistles for your coffee. Good place for daytime conversation.

Got the nutbar and cookie dough thing. Both weren't too sweet (which I liked) and the nutbar has good enough flavour. I think they were pretty pricey for what they were, but my friend and I were in a \"let's try this tiny cute snack for the sake of it\". 

I probably wouldn't pay $6 for fresh toast), but I would try their coffee or specialty drinks when I'm on the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I love the concept and the array of superfood creations and healthy drinks are alluring enough for the gym go-ers, the yummy mummies and the business hustlers to and fro. I appreciate the effort in sourcing the coffee and bread and that its organic. 

Location: Being on the corner is easy enough.

Access: Its a steep flight of stairs down to the lower sub-level. 

Space: Its limited but works as its not a big meal sit down place either - its a healthy cafe. Nice decor.

Service: Couldn't fault it. 

Price: Its pricey for sure and admittedly I've simply made it at home afterwards and was amused I could replicate it so easily. Its not rocket science but it is good for you. 

Packaging: Hot drink cups are cool in their visual print. The weightier food not so much. IE getting a $6.50 piece bread slice ie avocado with nutritional yeast which is like fish flakes (but yummy) handed to you on a piece of flimsy paper, inevitably they drop to the floor which is a let down and makes it feel less substantiative. 

Overall: I think its good to have in the neighborhood. Its a rich area, but I would like to see better value for money and more impressive items which people cant so easily replicate at home. 

Opportunity: To get more creative to match the price.

Would I go again? Sure, its a conscious minded and well intended place. They haven't lured me in as a cult following with any items of particular delight but I'd go again, sporadically."}
{"text":"Love their lattes! The only nut milk that tastes as good as dairy milk in my opinion. Also tried their kale caesar and acaibowl and they were delicious"}
{"text":"This is a unique concept, and the I really like the menu.  It's a great place to grab a healthy snack on the go, and the location is bright and airy (although small).  I've had a few of the balls (all delicious), the white bean toast (my favourite), and I acai bowl.  The acai bowl was the only thing I wasn't impressed with - it was too thin and didn't have a lot of flavour.  I much prefer the one at The Good Press.    I'll definitely be back here."}
{"text":"Organic ingredients, house made nut milks, cool decor and delicious snacks .... 
also most of the items in their menu are vegan! And they have organic cow's milk as well ... 
I'm a fan!!!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately Nutbar falls completely flat in terms of setting the right expectations. The Nutbar milk and other specialty drinks (turmeric latte) are interesting but the toasts and coffee are terrible. $6 for a smothering of avocado and burnt coffee make this a huge no no. Served on a piece of wax paper adds insult to injury that I just paid $6 for a small piece of toast I could've easily had at home. Similarly for the rest of the nut toasts, it's just \"nuts\" to pay that much.  Would never come back and highly recommend against it to anyone who has asked."}
{"text":"Had a delicious turmeric latte and spirulina ball. Ideal for healthy mornings on the go .
Wanna go back and try their toasts! And maybe smoothies when it gets warmer.
Amazing service, I asked to try their blend of but milks and they offered a sample. Also they offered some energy balls samples. The dark chocolate one was to die for!!!"}
{"text":"If I could buy an apartment directly above Nutbar and eat all of my meals there, I'd gladly pay top dollar. 

I've tried almost everything on the menu and have yet to come across anything I don't love. The classic avocado toast is a guaranteed favorite (the combination of smoked olive oil & the salty nutritional yeast is spectacular). 

Nutbar has the best coffee in the area. Definitely drive past the Starbucks and get your daily dose at Nutbar (by the way, they have dairy milk and cream, which I prefer in my coffee to nut milks - but I hear the nut milk is awesome).

Super friendly staff and amazing decor. Highly recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"The location is nice and tucked away near Summerhill. It's on my way to work so I've gone in a couple of times - the food is good but extremely simple; not enough variety. Pricing is decent. If your in the area it is worth a try."}
{"text":"Deliciously strong coffee suitable for morning or afternoon pickmeup.  Comparing this place to other independent coffee shops, i would rank flavour and strength as below out of 5 where 5 is highest or best bang for your buck.

Nutbar - strength 4.5, balance 5, price 2.5 (expensive for the size)
JJ bean - strength 4, balance 4.5, price 4
Starbucks - strength 2, balance 2, price 2.5
McDonalds - strength 3, balance 3, price 5"}
{"text":"Love this place. Their homemade nut milk is amazing, and tastes like a healthy(ish) milkshake. Their snacks are really good - some energy ball type things, avocado toast, acaii \"bowls\" etc. It all tastes fresh and delicious, a ton seems to be gluten free, and packed with random \"superfood\" type stuff. 

There are a few random things that don't have flavor, but I have to believe are more of a health thing - like their detox drink (mint and chlorophyll) for real tastes like water. Blue water. 

And oh man... It ain't cheap. A nut drink and a single avocado toast will set you back the greater part of twenty bucks and won't fill you for long. But it definitely suits the Rosedale yoga pants crowd. Worth a stop... But it's an expensive hobby."}
{"text":"This hidden snack bar is the perfect spot to come in for a quick pick me up during the day or a healthy bite to eat after a solid work out. The staff are pleasant and knowledgable! My favourite part of NutBar is obviously the ambience and clean,sleek and modern look of the space. The seating is limited, this is not a place to come to sit down and eat, it's more of a quick grab and go. They're known for their fancy roasts , hot drinks and nutritious  smoothies. The price point is shocking , it's definitely pricier than Starbucks but cheaper than a juice bar. I would for sure return when in the area :)"}
{"text":"Nutbar offers health-conscious alternatives to many favourites, so you won't feel guilty having more than 1 of their delicious cookie dough balls!! Definitely recommend for the cozy atmosphere, yummy (and healthy) treats, and the helpful staff! Very happy I've found my new favourite healthy coffee shop."}
{"text":"Branded as a \"superfood snack cafe\", Nutbar is a pretty, calming little spot with beautiful decor. They have smoothies, toast, coffee, energy bites and even soup!

Ordered the Vanilla smoothie which was made with nut milk, cashews, dates, vanilla and sea salt. At $9.50, it ain't cheap but it tasted amazing and also comes in a good portion size. The dates really complemented the rest of the smoothie and the texture was on point. Honestly couldn't have enough of it!"}
{"text":"Had a very nice coffee from here, called \"Supercoffee\"! It was delicious. The barista was really kind and passionate about the brand. She struck up conversation with us to explain about their nut milk blend. 

I'd come back for sure!"}
{"text":"Such a cute healthy coffee shop - amidst all the rich and heavy food in Chefs Assembly Hall this place has the most affordable, delicious and healthy food. And the drink menu is divine! Get a super coffee and an avocado toast, you won't regret it (and it won't cost you an arm and a leg!)"}
{"text":"So happy I found this place! This healthy coffee shop has the most unique and welcoming vibes in Toronto! The quality of the food is unmatched (all organic, made with love and care) and you'll be dying to come back to try the whole menu. Get the chocolate smoothie with raspberries and an avocado toast!"}
{"text":"LOVE the in-house nutmilk! Really great healthy treats and wonderful service. I recommend the cookie dough ball, and the drip coffee with nutmilk. It's a nice place to sit awhile and relax."}
{"text":"I stopped by Nutbar on a Saturday morning after working out. Nutbar is located just a walk away from Summerhill subway station downstairs. The place itself is small and designed as a grab and go type of cafe even though there are several seats available. Everything in the cafe is vegan, organic, and healthy, perfect for a post workout meal or even a healthy breakfast/lunch/snack. 

I ordered an avocado toast (with avocado, red radish, smoked olive oil, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, and sea salt with bread from Prairie Boy Bakery) and a nutbar drip coffee (drip coffee with nutbar nutmilk which is a custom housemade blend of organic cashew, almond and coconut milks). Service was friendly and quick even though staff seemed busy due to the many customers coming in.

I managed to find a seat to eat my breakfast and I found everything to be delicious and healthy. Will come back to try more items and drinks soon!"}
{"text":"I went to nutbar a few months ago with my friend because the food and drinks they serve are right up our alley. We were most intrigued by the turmeric latte which was delicious and the cups were STUNNING! We also got a couple snacks- the nutbar and raspberry chia pudding. Nutbar was great, raspberry chia I could've made myself. The only annoying thing was the lack of seating. We had to stand at a big communal table to enjoy our snacks because the seats were all taken...including the ones taken by people who were done and just chilling. They should really get a \"20 minute limit\" sign or something. I probably wouldn't return because it's so far from the downtown core and there's nothing else exciting in the area so it's not worth the TTC trip."}
