{"text":"These people know what moist cake should taste like! I am addicted to the crepes and love getting special event cakes from here. With so much flavour and care put into each cake I truly understand why they get so many great reviews. They really are worth the try!"}
{"text":"Best in Streetsville! I go often for their BLT sandwich! Cupcakes and treats are perfect at the end of lunch. Always very friendly service and all food comes fast and is very fresh!"}
{"text":"Good fresh cake! Ordered a cake here for my sisters birthday and we all loved it! Good prices as well."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Oakville, and so far the best cakes I've had are from here. I ordered my mom's birthday cake from here and it was perfect. The cake was sweet and moist, and the design was exactly what I asked for. Everyone loved it  I personally didn't like the cupcake because I don't like icing, and not only did they have a top layer, but the cupcakes were stuffed with icing too.   Ginger cookies were really good, perfect sweetness.  Yes, I did try all of this.. And the 5 stars is based on the cakes because thats what I went in for"}
{"text":"A few days back I attended a birthday party of my friend *s daughter and she ordered the cake from this bakery and it was truly tasty :)"}
{"text":"Top notch company. We ordered a cake and everything went smoothly. Also tasted fantastic. Amazing."}
{"text":"They have nice deserts but one time we picked up some cupcakes and they were not all fresh... some other time we ordered 2 cakes for our birthday party and it's turned out well... I liked their marble cake but chocolate cake we ordered my husband didn't like as much... he said it just wasn't anything special."}
{"text":"Great cafe. My family orders the klavir (piano) cake for birthdays and stuff, it's sooo good They also have small miniature versions of large cakes for taste testing. I recommend this place to anyone especially those of Mediterranean cultures. You must try the crepes too, particularly with nutella. However, i would advise that you share it with someone because they're huge!"}
{"text":"The best birthday cake in Mississauga (maybe in the GTA). I have ordered a few and they never disappoint. Ordering online is simple, nice people. The price is on the high end but it is worth it. Every one of my friend like the cake. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Read the reviews before deciding that this was where I wanted to get my birthday cake from. Only decided the night before so I went online and it said orders must be placed 48 hours in advance. I decided I would call anyway to find out what cakes they had available without ordering. Spoke with a gentleman who was possibly the owner. I asked him what they had available and he had mentioned vanilla and that they would be making other cakes later. Upon explaining my situation he asked me what cake I wanted. I mentioned the chocolate peanut butter crunch. He said he would check if they could make it and call me right back. Sure enough within 10 minutes he called and said it wouldn't be a problem. Extremely friendly and gracious and was making jokes with me on the phone. My dad picked it up that evening and the cake was AMAZING- very rich but so moist and peanut-buttery! Will definitely be using cake royale as a go to for birthday cakes !"}
{"text":"I ordered a cake for my daughter's birthday through their website. It was easy to do. They have lots of flavours available and pictures are shown so you'll have an idea how the cake looks like. I ordered the 8-inch Chocoholic cake. My husband picked up the cake from their shop in Streetsville. I can't give a review of the shop's aesthetic look because I haven't been there but I would like to say that the cake we ordered was so delicious! It was so moist. And I can tell it was baked fresh. Very good quality! Best birthday cake I've bought in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Love this bakery! They just did my son's 2nd birthday cake, and it turned out amazing. It looked and tasted great. The service was really good too. They were very nice and accommodating. I brought a picture of the cake I wanted and we ended up changing the design a little bit and turned out better than the original. All of this was done on short notice. When the day came to deliver the cake, they were at my house on time.  I've had their cupcakes as well, and I love them too! I would definitely recommend this place. I will be going back in the next week, to order a cake for my daughter's up coming birthday."}
{"text":"Nice cozy cafe, the cakes are really nice, you pay for the freshness and taste. You can even show a picture and make it to order. The different flavored macaroons, lolly pop ball covered with white chocolate and other toppings are really nice. They have a lot of variety for mini cheese cakes too Its a little bit pricey, but nice little place to start your day with a warm breakfast and a lovely hot coffee.  I tried the lavender macaroon and loved it!"}
{"text":"Cake Royale: An excellent niche for light socializing over very well-prepared dessert and the most unique latees in the area. Their hazelnut latte; The one I sampled, was creamy and light, with a sophiscated suggestion of hazelnut. Although I opted for a salad to accompany which was the most exquisite romaine lettuce, strawberry, brie, cranberry and mozzarella shaving combo one could wish for. I would recommend this place for any satanic urge for sweet as the selection of muffins, cakes and crepes and beverages encompassing smoothies, teas and lattes to name a few was also vast. Service was personable and great. Loved it-looking forward to round 2."}
{"text":"The best cupcakes! I always find my sweet-tooth satisfied with one of these cupcakes. I make my way down here about once a month. And during my birthday month.. I think i get showered with cake royales cupcakes all month round because everyone knows how much I love them!!"}
{"text":"Can only comment about their cupcakes: super light and fluffy and not too sweet! It was very pleasant to eat, fresh and very delicious :) I had the hazelnut chocolate cupcake - it tasted like a very fresh Ferrero Rocher!"}
