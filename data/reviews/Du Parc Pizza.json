{"text":"I've tried many pizza places in Montreal over the last three years but Pizza Du Parc is still my go to pizza place. Its about as unpretentious as it gets but I really think the pizza is top notch. Their pizza is very doughy so if you like this style then you'll like their pizza. Also, he sauce is nice and the toppings always seem fresh. Personally, my favourite by far is the \"canadien.\"   As far as I know, the menus you can find online have outdated prices but, c'mon, two great medium pizzas for under $22 is still good deal by my standards. There are a few places with pizza of competitive quality that are more popular (like Amelio's, or il Focolaio) but Pizza Du Parc is much cheaper; and regardless of prices (which are low!), they make my favourite pizza in the city."}
{"text":"For a quick slice in Montreal the options are all similar in that the quality is not generally there. However, this place has superior prices which make it taste that much better and their sauce is pretty choice compared to others.  I am now a fan, however I also subscribe to the school of pizza that is quantity over quality."}
{"text":"This pizza is completely terrible. The service is garbage as well. On the plus side, there is hot sauce and it isn't terribly expensive.   If you are completely stoned out of your mind, this is perfect. Also, a better pizza cannot be found in the pizza desert known as Montr√©al. This city is to pizza what hell is to soft breezes."}
