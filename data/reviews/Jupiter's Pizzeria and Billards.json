{"text":"Most staff is extremely friendly. You get the occasional stick in the mud, but they do awesome. Pizza has definitely improved over the last year or so. Sad to see garlic cheese bread go, but love the new pizzas!"}
{"text":"Meh, it's just ok. The service is spotty, pizza is pretty good. They don't allow you to carry there, so be aware of that if you have a CCL. I'll go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Decided to give Jupiter's another shot, but completely avoided the bar this time. Our server was phenomenal and we enjoyed playing pool and the arcade games. The pizza, as always, was great. I think the key is to just sit at a table! Avoid the bar (which unfortunately means no take out) at all costs."}
{"text":"So I love Jupiter's downtown. I've never been disappointed by their pizza in the past. But tonight, since the students are all back in town, my guy and I decided to travel to the ends of the city and try out the pizza \"at the Crossing\". Mistake! We started with a \"hummus\" appetizer which honestly tasted nothing like hummus. It really had no flavor whatsoever, no spice, nothing. And the pita wedges served with it were deep fried?! What? Blech. So the pizza came and I was ready to indulge.  Not so fast!  The crust was sooo soggy with oil. I've had pesto pizza many times downtown and never was the crust limp as it was tonight. Just completely unappetizing. Even the feta cheese on the pizza was bland.  How it that possible? Grrr. The best thing I had all night was my glass of Pepsi.  In my opinion, the location downtown Champaign is the ONLY way to go!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great family-friendly place to eat that serves delicious food, you will not be disappointed with Jupiter's at the Crossing!  I recently visited Jupiter's with my family - my husband and myself, my teenage daughter, my toddler son, and my mom - and we loved it!  We're not from the Champaign area, so I was a little apprehensive about choosing a yummy spot to eat, but I stumbled on Jupiter's and I'm so glad we did.

The Good:  Our initial thought when we walked into Jupiter's was WOW...really!  We were so impressed with the modern feel and large space - lots of dining tables, video games, pool tables, and TV's...lots and lots of TV's!  Gotta watch those Illini games somewhere, right?

So the space was great, and I was hoping that the food would live up to the fantastic venue.  And I can tell you with absolute certainty that it does!  We ordered chicken wings as an appetizer - SO GOOD, a specialty Gyro Pizza - unique and delicious, my toddler had a personal cheese pizza, and I had the Chicken Bacon Ranch Grinder - a favorite of mine.  All solid choices.

The Bad:  We found nothing to be lacking at Jupiter's. 

Overall:  The venue is spacious, the food is great, the restrooms were clean, and there were video games the kids could play while we waited.  An all-around fantastic choice for a family meal."}
{"text":"I ordered a Jameson neat with a soda water back.  My nineteen (okay, probably 21) year old bartender gave me a Jameson/Sprite cocktail.  Alright, that's fine, we all have to learn sometime and maybe words like \"neat\" and \"back\" aren't as popular anymore as \"bomb\" or \"gorilla fart\".  So, I explained to her that I wanted a shot of Jameson with a soda water on the side.  She almost got it right.  Jameson shot, chilled, Sprite on the side.  Maybe if she hadn't been so distracted by the barbacks throwing ice at her and giggling she could have done better.  Poor thing, her job is tough...just like math and remembering which lip gloss is kept in which purse."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and area just on the outskirts of champagne Illinois. However, the pizza is rather unimpressive. We ordered side salads and a large pizza and it took over 45 minutes to even get the salads and the pizza came about five minutes later. The salads were actually very good, however. The pizza was barely warm and ate a cardboard crust. Maybe this was an isolated incident, but not a very good experience."}
{"text":"This place is just unreal.  Picture three levels of people EVERYWHERE.  I'll give you a tour!

First floor (entry level): Cougarville.  This is where all of the beautiful people of Southwest Champaign drink after the kiddies are sent downstairs with 20s (more on that later) and the BMWs, Mercedes, and Lexus SUVs have been safely parked in the lot.  There are pool tables, booths, video games, tons of TVs, a big U shaped bar, etc.  This is just a taste of the insanity you'll find on other levels.  This level has cougars on the prowl and 20-somethings looking for their divorced sugar daddies.  People watching at it's best....I mean it really doesn't get any better than this.

Downstairs: Chuck-E-Cheese on CRACK!  I've never seen so many kids running around in my life without parental supervision.  There is some kind of mini bowling thing and another bar and more booths and pool tables....it's just insanity.  If you despise children like I do don't go down here....you'll need a strong sedative if you do.  

Upper Level: This place is also unreal.  If you're having a birthday party, family reunion, bachelorette party, bat mitzfah, divorce party, whatever the event and you live in Southwest Champaign you'll have it here.  Kids running EVERYWHERE and the beautiful parents of SW Champaign ignoring them.  Just pure insanity.

Every time I'm at J2 I just have to laugh because when I was growing up this was an empty cornfield at Windsor and Duncan, now it's a goldmine.  The pizza is good, the service sucks, and you just can't beat the people watching anywhere else.  Go once...take it all in...and NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"I had quite possibly the worst carry-out experience of my life. My husband called the Crossing (got their # from the website - 366-8300) location and ordered. 30 minutes later I went to pick up. The incredibly b*tchy bartender said they had no record of it and then went back into the kitchen. 5-10 minutes later she said they had my order at the Downtown location, making me feel like an idiot, of course. I apologized but then called my husband who confirmed that he had called their location. So, I asked the bartender what their # was and she wouldn't tell me, claiming she didn't know and then refusing to check it.

 ***So, basically they lost my order and instead of just apologizing they blamed it on me.*** 

After that, I went home and ate my cold pizza.
I will NEVER go here for carry-out ever again. Instead, I will order from the place across the street--better service, better pizza, and no lying!"}
{"text":"This place was terrible. I will never ever come here again. The terrible experience started when I walked in. The service was terrible and I had waited probably a half an hour to order and have probably never asked so many times for a drink, until I received my drink, and when I did it wasn't even what I ordered. I was there with a group of friends and when everyone else got their food, mine was no where to be seen. Everyone was done eating and I had still not received my food, after asking numerous times about my meal. In the end I never got my food and ended up walking out hungry. They comped my meal and they should have done the same to my drink that wasn't even what I ordered too. This place would get no stars if that was a choice. I advise everyone reading this never to come here unless you want to walk out hungry with crap service. Zero stars from me!!"}
{"text":"We came here with a decent-sized group (about 10 people) for a friend's birthday.  Lots of unique pizzas on the menu, so we were excited to try them out.  Sadly, it ended up taking about an hour to get our food after ordering!  We sat out on the patio and were the only people out there.  The inside didn't seem crowded either, so I'm not sure why the service was so bad.  The pizza was okay, but nothing to write home about.  (It didn't help that it had gotten cold!)  It might have been a better experience had we taken advantage of the billiards tables while we were waiting, because it might not have seemed so long.  Maybe that's the idea?

This happened about three years ago, so maybe things have gotten better.  I'd say to be safe though, go to the Jupiter's in downtown Champaign... or another pizza place or bar altogether!"}
{"text":"It's a Jupiter's location, which is nice because I think they have the best pizza in town. This one has games, however, and while that might be nice for kids (and gamblers; they have gaming rooms upstairs) it kind of kills the dive bar vibe that the downtown Jupiters has. Parking's free, which is a bit of an upside, but I'll take the divey quality of the downtown one over that. 

Still, good food, good service. Lots to recommend the pizza. Just don't sit near the games lest you be annoyed by all the children."}
{"text":"Pizza was great.   Breadsticks were awesome.   Service was scarce.  Our 5-top had to compete with a large (15+people) party and 3 other full tables.  The server tried, she just didn't have a chance.   The whole place seemed understaffed.   Sad because the food and atmosphere was great!"}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times.  Based on my first experience, I probably would've given this place 2 stars.  My second experience was slightly better.

While I much prefer it's sister location downtown Champaign, there are some redeeming qualities about this location.  For one, there are many more pool tables.  In fact, I didn't realize how many pool tables there were until my second visit where I actually ventured downstairs. Not only that, but there's an entire arcade and mini bowling alley down there!!!  Whaaat???  The upper level has a nice big bar, and lots of open space.

Con's?  It's too far away to go to on a regular basis, and given all the options around campus... not really worth it.  The service wasn't all that great either.  This place wasn't even close to being busy the two times I went, yet the service was pretty shotty both times... 

All in all, it was okay the times I've been... but would I go back?  Ehhh... probably not this location."}
{"text":"I tried to book a reservation for 18 people.. Someone was supposed to call me back to confirm, never got the phone call back then I call back the next day & Heather tells me they're not accepting anymore reservations. I guess I will go someone else that wants my business!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Jupiter's this past week when we called in last-minute to reserve a private room to watch game 7 of the World Series! Jessica couldn't have been more helpful in accommodating our needs, and the staff that night were great! Thanks for making our group of Cubs fans happy :)"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Jupiter's.  The outside looks like it could be classy; the inside is an upscale chucky cheese.  Even though the place was half empty, we were left waiting until they could find us a space in an almost empty row of booths.  Our waitress was good, the pizza was good, but a little slow.

The best thing I can say about Jupiter's is that our meal didn't cost a lot.  We won't be in a hurry to come back."}
{"text":"Came here for the pizza, and it did not disappoint. Very thin crust, great cheese, sauce and meat. The parmesan in the shaker was actually grated, not dumped out of a green can. Not sure if I've ever seen that before. Regardless, it's a good thing. 

Only knock that holds it back from getting 5 stars is the crust. It was a bit dry. Works good supporting 3 meats, cheese and sauce, but Papa Dels is better. 

On a positive note, the wait staff was very good. Service was quick and friendly, even on a football Saturday after the game. Nice big TVs, but provider is Dish and their selection of sports is limiting."}
{"text":"As it is with my luck....Sunday night is Pizza night and we thought we would try something new. Wow--what a train wreck. 

Crying baby's--which is not a reflection of this establishment. But annoying! 

Ordered the gluten free crust. Kitchen got it wrong. My dinner partner ordered a custom small pizza. It too was missing ingredients. And in his words the worst tasting flat crust he had ever had. 

Ordered a second beer which never arrived. So I went to the bar and picked it up. Our server on this evening seemed more intent in taking care of her side work than taking care of us. 

They comped the gluten-free pizza. Our first time here and our last. Footnote. In the past I've had very good experiences at the downtown location.  But long ago. 

And to insult to injury a staff person questioned  if we have health issues and if that's why we ordered the gluten-free pizza. It's a personal issue and none of your business."}
{"text":"We were passing through town on our way to Indianapolis and needed a place to have dinner with our kids.  This place was recommended by a local, so we went without doing any research.  When I checked in with Yelp upon arrival, I was instantly worried as most reviews were 2 stars.  I decided to give it a chance without reading any of the reviews, and I'm glad I did.  It was a Friday night around 6pm and the place was busy, but not packed.  My family of six sat on the main level in a booth big enough for all of us to sit comfortably.  Their pizza was good-- not great, but just fine-- good enough that I would get it again.  My wife was thrilled that they offered some healthier toppings like olive oil, artichokes, sun dried tomatoes, etc.-- she was able to create a personal pizza that was exactly to her liking.  Our server was a bit \"spacey\" but it didn't affect her service, just her conversation skills. :)  She was young, though, and the right age to work at a place like this so it really didn't bother me.  After the kids ate we sent them downstairs on their own to play games and felt safe doing so.  My wife went down a few minutes later once she was finished.  All in all it was a great experience-- perfect for kids, and probably a lot of fun for young adults too.  Make sure you give this place a try-- don't let the reviews scare you off."}
{"text":"I'm from Chicagoland so I'm somewhat of a pizza snob. They're thin crust is excellent IMHO although my skinny wife and I can almost take down a large pizza no problem. Their breadsticks are hit or miss.  Great place for large groups and sub-adolescent children.  Also a great place for adult couples looking to socialize and enjoy a beverage and good meal. Great atmosphere!

I'm surprised this place doesn't have a higher rating honestly."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO FOR LUNCH!!!  Stopped in for lunch and after waiting a hour for 2 small pizzas, we had to get them to go because otherwise we'd be late for appointments.  The kicker.....PIZZAS WERE COLD!  This is the second time it took an hour to get our food.  At least the first time the food was hot. We will not return!!!"}
{"text":"Aside from the good food and entertainment, management has purposely removed  all R&B and POP music with African-American (AA) artists from the Jukeboxes.  Every genre is represented but this one.  What's wrong with a little R&B or any music with AA artists. My AA friends and I concluded that this is another way to deter AA from patronizing the restaurant.  If not the case, then please cater to all of your patrons while they spend their \"green.\""}
{"text":"Good place to go and have fun.  Went for a large office party and there was plenty of room.  The wait staff was responsive to us and the food was pretty tasty, especially the chicken barbeque pizza.  

A downside and word of warning to people who use their debit cards for tabs...if you use your debit card for a tab, this establishment charges in $25.00 increments.  I have three $25.00 charges holding on my checking account on a tab that was settled that night.  Six days later and the charges are still in my pending queue with money tied up.  (I bought a lot of drinks and appetizers for people, I guess!)  Just be prepared for this.  It is how they do things and takes nothing away from my enjoyment of this particular restaurant/bar while I am there."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar for a few beers, pizza, and wings. The staff was very nice, but service was slow- a little confusing since we were almost the only people in there. The wings were really good, but tiny and did not have much meat. Our pizza was awful. The crust was like cardboard, there was no sauce, the small amount of cheese was overcooked, and the toppings were sparse."}
{"text":"If you are coming here for the videos games and prizes turn back around. The majority of the games are out of order. If they are not out of order, they either take your tokens are gives u low tickets per game. The prize selections are cheap. You are spending $20 you end up getting a prize that cost $0.25 in those quarter machines. There was trash everywhere on the floor and the person working didn't care to pick any of it up.

Their game selection is weak and there's tons of naughty kids running around without parent supervision. A group of kids were shooting basketballs across the room into the basketball game and the worker who was emptying the token machines just walked passed and didn't say anything.

This will be the last time I take my family here. They could make this an amazing place but it lacks TLC."}
{"text":"I was in charge of planning my 15-year high school reunion here in October.  I live about 500 miles away from my hometown so this was a little challenging.  Someone recommended Jupiter's to me so I checked them out online.  I worked with the manager via email and he was extremely knowledgeable and made excellent recommendations.  The night of the event was great.  We had an AMAZING server who was extremely attentive.  My only complaint is the speed that the food came out.  I would recommend requesting it be set out 15 minutes prior to what you're wanting since it takes a while to set up.  We had lots of food leftover as well.  It was all very tasty!"}
{"text":"Mediocre pizza made from frozen crusts. reviews that call this pizza \"good\" have either had too much from the bar, or haven't had pizza other than frozen or pizza hut.  This is basically a big, no, giant, no, HUGE bar with bar-pizza and a video game pit in the basement for kids to run wild. On any given night, the place is crowded with cougars on the prowl and biker wannabees.  To add some flair to the place, right next to where the kids run wild in the basement (think chucky-cheese unsupervised with drunk parents upstairs) is an OTB gambling center. So, pick your vice - drink or gamble, while your kids run wild in the gaming area. heck, you can do both!

Interesting update: the owner defended the gambling as a \"high class addition\" saying he lived in the neighborhood.  Of course, he's since moved away.

I try to avoid at all cost. We only go when my kids are invited to a b-day party and we can't refuse.

the kids have fun if they've got about $20 in coins.  less than that and they are among the many (MANY) kids walking around asking any adult they can find for money.

(this is a repost of my review, which was filtered. funny, I live right nearby, and wrote a real review, although negative.  non-filtered reviews are from out-of-towners. Um, what's up yelp? your founders are from UofI afterall!)"}
{"text":"Jupiter's Pizza is a wonderful place to come whether it be a large group or a small one. I came here with a large group with about 21 people and they were so kind to help us out with combining tables and getting everything we needed on point. 

Our waiter Joel was great with what we asked for! He helped us with this being our first time with suggestions. Not only that, but he split the check in whatever way we wanted and that helped up a lot. He also helped us with problems when we were playing arcade games since some of the games were malfunctioning. 

Now the food. It was really good pizza, but I felt as thought it was just average pizza that you can get anywhere. The crust was a little burnt, but it was still amazing pizza and I was very satisfied. 

The restaurant had a great atmosphere and has a very family oriented feeling. There were lots of TV's for us to watch and it was fairly clean. 

Overall, if I am ever in the area I will definitely come back. Glad to have visited here when I was in town!"}
{"text":"I made the mistake of coming here again. Never again! We sat at the bar because no one came to our table after 15 minutes of waiting. The bartender was incredibly rude. We did get to see 2 very classy ladies flash him about half an hour into our food. Full on flash. He laughed and gave them a \"discount\" because they were counting change to pay for their requisite shots. I mean, I expect this crap at Kam's or Joe's, but at Jupiter's in West Champaign? No thanks!! GROSS. 

Pizza was only ok, too."}
{"text":"Outstanding thin-crust pizza and great variety on the toppings, wonderful salads, tons of TVs for  keeping up on the sporting events of the day, a really nice bar, great service, tons of games (Skee-ball, air hockey, crane games, mini-bowling, etc.), lots of quality pool tables and an incredibly nice staff."}
{"text":"I called to reserve a room for a cheer banquet (Large groups, I would suggest making a reservation, and ordering ahead of time, this place gets busy!). Their event coordinator made everything simple for us. She helped us with the quantity of food we'd need for a group of 100 kids/adults. She even calculated what the total cost per person after tax, and tip for me. All I had to do was chose the time we wanted our food served, and the servers took care of set up and clean up. They are in the process of remodeling too! There is new carpet and freshly painted walls. Our servers also told us they are creating a private party room out of the old OTB, and purchasing new furniture for certain areas of the building. This is a great place for all ages! There is an arcade for the kiddos, pool tables, and a bar for the adults. Our guests were very impressed. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Went to Jupiter's tonight. They have a family night special. Sounded like a great deal but the pizza was horrible. Took forever to get and was all burnt. They charged a gratuity since we were a large group. The server walked away with $20 but didn't do much but bring pitcher refiles twice. Will not come here again. There is much better pizza and games in town."}
{"text":"First of all, I should be able to write two different reviews--one for the food and one for the service.  I love their pizza, seriously, I'm going to miss it so much now that I'm gone.  I also think the Crossing location has good appetizers and their menu is a lot larger than the downtown location.   However, there service is consistently bad.  Now, I'm normally a big tipper regardless of the service, because I know waiting tables isn't a fun job, but the last time we were there I told the person paying the bill to leave a VERY small tip.  I wish I could identify, by name, the server we had, but oh, he didn't even introduce himself.  When he was taking our order, he didn't even look at us.  He was, literally, staring at another table the whole time.  He also gave us attitude when we all asked for silverware, who knew this was a problem?  It was very weird and kind of put a damper on my final meal before moving away from Chambana.

I've also had some weird experiences while enjoying the downstairs arcade, but it was never from staff, but fellow customers."}
{"text":"Great pizza and huge place to go!  The service/space they offer is like no other place in town.  I wish they would carry a few of the items they have at Billy's because the menu is fairly small.  All in all a great place!"}
{"text":"We went to Jupiter's in a party of fourteen from my husband's work.  I'm not a game and sports bar type of person, but most of the raucousness seemed confined to the lower level.  We sat at the bar and had a beer until everyone had arrived.  We could find no menu or list of beers, but the bartender we spoke to was helpful and polite when we asked. When all were present, a member of our party talked with a hostess who indicated we could sit in the booth area by the pool tables.  Some of our party wanted to play pool, so this was just fine.  We had no requirement to be seated close together.  Since there is no wait service provided in that area, which I found very strange for a pizza place/bar that serves drinks and food, we ordered our food at the bar and additional drinks needed to be obtained in the same way.  The pizza was delicious with generous toppings but I ran out of anything to drink soon after the pizza arrived and just didn't want to go through standing at the bar like a goose to get another.  A member of our party still did not have his food after everyone else had theirs, and when they did bring it out, it was dropped on the floor and had to be remade.  Accidents happen, so I don't hold that against Jupiter's, but the fact that one person hadn't received their food yet when we were finished, I do.  

If the above issues alone are not enough to keep me from going again, this is: while we were waiting for our food (we had our drinks on the table), the same hostesses we had talked with earlier approached our booth and in a manner suggesting we were bad children said, \"Ummmm, did someone seat you at this table?\"  One of our party replied that we weren't seated specifically at this table, and the hostess interjected \"Well....we need this for other things.\"  Other things such as what?  Customers?  I thought that is what we were.  We told her that we had spoken to the hostess, HER actually, that we were a party of 14 and were told to sit in this area.  She said, \"Oh.  yeah, ok.\" and left.  At least my husband and I left feeling that Jupiter's doesn't quite value their customers.  So, I would definitely enjoy having their pizza again, but not as a dine in customer."}
{"text":"Probably the worst place I've been to in a while and definitely not a good place for large groups. We came here with a reservation for 20 people after a graduation, and this place is equipped to hold a larger party, which is why we picked it in the first place. However, I would say after the experience we had, they should just not accept a large reservation if you're not going to staff it to handle the group. We had only 1 person wait our table even though there were several other workers at the bar and people who were doing nothing that could have helped. 

The food is Grade C and the service is grade F. Let's start with the food. For a pizza place, I would say this is just mediocre because there was nothing special about the cheese, sauce, flavors, or anything. I've had much better thin crust pizza and can probably make better pizza at home than this place. We had pre-ordered our pizza since we had a large group and that was a mistake. Our pizza came out cold. If you pre-order, it shouldn't mean that they make the pizza hours in advance and bring it out as is. If you were going to do that, at least make sure the pizza temperature is hot enough to enjoy. The breadsticks were soft and tasty, but they didn't bring enough sauce for the breadsticks, and with how bad things were already going, we were tired of asking for more and waiting forever to get anything.

Now for the service. From the start, our waiter did not have the table ready with the right number of cups, plates, napkins, or anything. The first thing we asked for was water for the whole table .He brought out 2 glasses at a time and went through half the table. We asked for a few pitchers of coke and he said \"well someone said to bring waters for the whole table\". So we said yes, waters for everyone and 2 pitchers of coke. He never brought out any more waters or cups for water. We ended up just using disposable plastic cups we asked for to get more water  To him, it was like we could only ask for coke or water, not both. So from the beginning, this guy couldn't even take care of water. He also had brought over a broken plastic cup which was leaking all over the table and when we told him, he told us there were napkins on the table and we asked him to bring a rag over and we were the ones cleaning it up versus him quickly reacting and taking care of it. 

We then wanted to order more breadsticks b/c there weren't enough for everyone even though we placed the order based on the number of breadsticks they told us were in 1 order. My uncle wanted to order a beer and so when he came around he mentioned that and the guys says \"only one thing at at time.\" Really? if you're a waiter and you can only get one order at a time, then I'd be in your restaurant for 5 hours trying to eat. And if you can't remember something, that's fine. That's why they invented a notepad and pen. 

All the waiter had to get was our drink order and bring out breadsticks since we had pre-ordered pizza and the kitchen brought that out. For 2 simple tasks, the waiter could not remember anything and did half his job on drinks. I'm not sure how you could work at a restaurant and not be able to get drink orders in one shot (especially when the majority of it was just water and then 2 pitchers of coke, and 1 beer). the entire time he had given an attitude to the table and we ended up doing most of his job for him by getting plates, napkins, and trying to find crushed red pepper shakers on other tables before asking him to bring 2 to the table. 

Overall, I would NEVER bring a large group to this place and honestly, I would probably never come back for the food since it was nothing special."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good, but the environment is great.  It's a fun place to come and hang out.  They have arcade games, billiards, and mini-bowling. Huge beer selection and the prices are comparable to most pizza places around C-U."}
{"text":"I just ordered a couple of pizza's from Jupiters and while the taste of the crust and sauce on both was fine, the amount of toppings on each pizza was severely lacking. Don't bother ordering bacon or onion on your pizza. So far, on this medium pizza, I found two little crumbs of bacon and maybe three onions."}
{"text":"I am the team manager for my son's soccer team and chose this venue to have our end of the year soccer team dinner.   We had games in Champaign and thought we would try something new since we were in town. We had a group of 40 and this was the perfect place to host an all boys soccer team of 9-10 yr olds and their families.   
I worked with Jessica who was the event planner.   She was VERY accommodating and answered any and all questions that I had.  Most of my communication with her was via email and only needed to verbally speak to her once or twice to finalize our party.   
We opted for their signature buffet and it was ready and prepared as requested!!!  It was a great set up and more than enough food !   Our servers Taylor & Rachel were phenomenal !!!  Very attentive and again this was for a party of 40 people which half was children.  We had 10 separate checks and they accommodated that with grace.  
All the parents provided me with positive feedback and continually thanked me for providing such a great experience for the kids !!!
At one point the machine that provides the prizes broke and they rectified the situation right away !!!  
I would definitely recommend this place for team or large party's !!!!"}
{"text":"I go here to play pool once in a while. They have quite a few tables, where even on the busiest nights you'll have a good chance to get one. It costs $6 an hour to hold a table. The equipment is decent for the most part, but they have a few broken cue sticks, and the balls take some funny rolls on a few of the tables. They need to do a better job of replacing worn-out equipment.

The food is average. There is really nothing to talk about, but nothing to hate on either. I am not usually a fan of light beers, but their Miller Light draft is unusually good. By that I mean better than any light beer bottle, can, or draft that I have ever had. I thought I was going crazy, but my friends have said the same. They have a decent selection of other domestics.

There is a good space on the second floor to rent out for big groups, and they have a small arcade in the basement."}
{"text":"I've done Jupiter's twice now, and both times were average.

This most recent trip was a weekday lunch.  We were one of three tables filled in the place, and it was straight up noon (not a good sign to me).  The restaurant is very open, with pool tables, a large bar and a fair amount of TVs.  Our waitress was attentive and gave good recommendations.

I went with one - the Enchilada Pizza with steak (other option was chicken, which I would have chosen but our waitress said the steak was the way to go).  I liked the pizza - thin crust, about 10\" - especially the load of chopped veggies and refried bean puree decoration on top."}
{"text":"I absolutely lovelove this place! Being new to the area, the bartenders are very nice, talkative, knowledgable and remember you. No drink specials at this location, which is a downer, but there arent many college students here-which is good sometimes. Of course the pizza is very good- try the bbq chicken deliciousness. What makes this place different is that they have many arcade games, 2 floors of fun and an outdoor patio. I am not sure why there are so many bad reviews but i love this place!"}
{"text":"It's delicious, but I don't have any kids and this isn't exactly the type of place to go before or after a trip to Sinai Temple. Pretty much identical menu to Jupiter's downtown, but with more small, loud annoying people."}
{"text":"Overall sort of noisy and would be a great place to have a beer and play pool, but there are kids everywhere on the weekends.  Pizza is ok, though I do sometimes have a craving for it, especially their smoked salmon pizza with dill, only place in town to get it, though it hasn't been as good the last few times we have gone."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. The thin crust pizzas are decent. The layout is pretty nice. The service can be good or can be bad--like Forrest's momma says...you never know what you're gonna get. 

My main beef is the fact that their ticket times are so long. And this isn't based off of one experience. And I'm not saying that our food took 15 or 20 minutes. I'm saying that I waited more than 45 minutes at lunch this week. They weren't busy--there were only 4 other tables. And there was no explanation or even an awareness that there was a problem. The previous time, I took my team there and was buying their food. It took so long to get our pizza that I had to pay and leave before it ever got to the table--in excess of an hour.  Other times have been long, too. We have basically stopped coming to lunch here because you just can't get back in time. 

Get your act together, Jupiters. If you have 'pizza' in the name of your restaurant, you shouldn't struggle quite so much. This isn't some deep dish monster with a pound of cheese--and it's not like you are a new restaurant who hasn't worked out the bugs yet. 

Quit your lollygagging and manage your business."}
{"text":"Go to Jupiter's they said. It's the best pizzeria style pizza in town they said.
Wrong!
First of all it took an hour for us to get our appetizer and then two minutes later they brought the pizza out so the kitchen staff has very poor timing.
We ordered a large pizza with sausage and bacon. When we got the pizza we literally counted 12 small pieces of sausage and no couldn't find any bacon.
So basically we paid Monical's price for a pizza that had the amount of toppings you see on a frozen pizza and speaking a frozen pizza the sausage kind of tasted like it come from a frozen pizza. 
Now I'm told and this may just be a rumor, but I'm told that the new GM for Jupiter's is the person who is forcing the kitchen staff to be very Skippy on the toppings for the pizzas. If this is true then you GM had a needs to be bounced out on his ass because that's not how you do things. If you want to charge a kind of price for a pizza you need to give the people what they pay for. If it's the kitchen staff that's just being lazy and not putting them out of toppings at or supposed to go on there then bounce them guys out on their ass.
Needless to say I won't be returning to Jupiter's for pizza not at those prices not with the skimpy toppings that they put on there."}
{"text":"I don't understant reviewers who say \"Service was bad\" Aren't people entitled to an off day? Either way, I have never had bad service here or more importantly, bad food. So many unique pizza options to try and this might sound weird but great salads too! Roomy, comfortable and plenty to do! We went here to celebrate an occasion and it was just all around fun!!"}
{"text":"This place has good pizza and friendly staff. We have had a couple of office parties here and at the most recent one, the waitstaff was incredibly attentive and courteous. The food was correct as ordered and put out after people started arriving, so it was all fresh and very tasty. 

The game room in the basement is great for kids but it is loud and hectic. The pool tables on the main level and upstairs are great!"}
{"text":"This was disappointing and it's rare I write a bad review, but I don't want anyone to waste their time.  None of the staff knew what was going on, were confused about reservations, and service was terrible (which was NOT our waiter's fault).  I ordered a salad with no onion or cheese, and it came with onions and cheese.  I ordered a pizza that didn't come after 40 minutes with everyone else's and then he realized it was made with cheese , which I didn't want, so he put the order back in.  Another 45 minutes later and still no pizza.  The downtown location is so great...so pick that location instead."}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing, but service was terrible.  We were given three menus for table of 16.  The waiter literally told us that the kitchen 'couldn't be bothered' to keep 1/4 of our pizza just cheese for one of our family members.  Our Food took forever to get out, came nearly 40 minutes after another tablemate got their food.  And we didn't get our appetizers (garlic bread) until the exact time as our dinner."}
{"text":"Jupiter's is my favorite pizza place in town. I love their thin crust pizzas especially the buffalo chicken       I usually go there on Tuesdays when it's half off large pizzas."}
{"text":"I broke my vow, I swore this would never happen again but I broke.  Went here for happy hour and ordered myself a personal size pizza.  Joked with my friends that it would take 45 minutes for it to show up.  I was wrong, it took 44 and it was burnt to a crisp.

Never, never, never again.  I renew my vow, I will never set foot inside Jupiters at the Crossing again.

Go downtown.  Your pizza will be better prepared, servers will be nicer, it won't be filled with kids and your food will come out in a reasonable amount of time.

Stay away at all costs."}
{"text":"Just got done with the birthday party for my two nieces there were about 30 of us there later was completely amazing I forget his name but he was a very young clean cut African American male who was amazing he took care of the entire parties needs and we had an amazing time would highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"This is--by far--the best pizza restaurant in town! The staff always delivers service with a smile, while the kitchen is usually fast at getting the food to the table. One of the best days to go is Tuesday because they have half-price large pizza but only dine in. This location, unlike the one on Main Street, has tons of games for families. Both locations have pool, but this location in particular has air hockey, ske ball, basketball and so much more! They also have additional seating in the basement if the top floor gets too crowded. All in all, good food and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Make sure you ask lots of questions when you are planning a large party here. Booked my rehearsal dinner here months in advance, and they ended up sitting our party next to a large retirement event tonight which gave speeches on a stage with a microphone for almost an hour. While we knew going into the event, that there could be other events there with us, we were not warned that another party would have access to a microphone that would be so loud that we couldn't hear the person sitting next to you talk. The sound of the speeches was also piped into the bathroom so we couldn't get away from it. Terrible experience. Big events and brides be warned."}
{"text":"Generally speaking the pizza is good and there are lots of options for specialty pizzas. This is a great place for families and medium sized get togethers. Billiards, games for kids in the downstairs and even a mini bowling alley make for a unique experience. The wait staff has always been courteous and reasonably quick. They also have a gluten free pizza option available which is definitely nice. Gets pretty busy here on the weekends. Especially those times with sports on. Lots of TVs and plenty of food and beverage options makes this a good spot to watch the game."}
{"text":"My dad is a big fan of their pizza (he likes the bianco, I believe). When I come home, I usually order deep dish. However, this time I was in the mood for something a bit lighter. I was going to order Monical's cause it looks so good (I don't know about the taste since I haven't had it in forever). But my brother assured me that Jupiter's is way better. So Jupiter's it is. They have a lovely variety of specialty pizzas. But I am a picky pizza ingredient person. We just got a large pepperoni pizza. Order was expected in 25-30 min. I seems like it was ready even earlier than that as our pizza was not piping hot when received. Disappointing. Taste was OK - nothing special. The restaurant is a fine place to hang out and have a drink. There are also plenty of games that patrons were taking advantage of."}
{"text":"4.5 stars

We got to Jupiter's with a large group and had reserved some tables in the lower level (which was \"closed\", we felt like such VIPs yo :P). I really liked the atmosphere, even though the basement level was empty besides us. 

Jupiter's is obviously a lot of fun. Our group mainly stayed at the billiards tables, but a few of us strayed to the games and liked them. Again, the vibe of the place was pretty great. We really liked the music that was playing. It wasn't top 40 stuff, but it wasn't stuffily indie or anything. It was just... good music. You knew the words to some of the songs, you liked the songs you'd never heard before. Good stuff.

The pizza is really good! Wow. Thin crust little square slices (of a circular pie... which is a little awkward) that were so easy to inhale 20 of... I had some of the vegetable pie, the no-cheese vegetable pie, the barbecue chicken, the Hawaiian, and the regular cheese. I'm trying to figure out how much I ate, with each square being about 2x2 inches? About? And I ate............. many of those. Plus several of the awkward little round edge pieces. 

Our bartender was also very accommodating to the giant group we brought in. He made me ginger ale with some non-alcoholic bitters and Sprite. The bar looked very well-stocked, even though few of us could enjoy that. (Under 21 ftw!) He was great about giving us all our drinks, passing over the pool balls, and processing our orders. The pizza took a bit of a while (our second round did, anyway), but we were having a great time and didn't mind all that much.

All in all, such a fun place to go! I hope I get to come back and play the rest of the games with some friends, because it is seriously just a fun, hip, little... ah, I just loved it. XD"}
{"text":"My daughter and I love Jupiter's I had her birthday party there this year and it went very smoothly, the service is always great and the food is perfect to feed a large group and easily affordable. My daughter loves the games there and its great in the winter when you want to get out of the house, not spend a lot of money and have a good time with family"}
{"text":"Quality and quantity not worth the money. Service is always bleh, even when not busy and pizza takes a long time, esp for as thin as theirs is."}
{"text":"We come here sometimes for Tuesday trivia. Big Dave has been replaced by Derek. When we went, the questions were somewhat ambiguous, and left the answers vague. 

The trivia specials are awesome. Half off large pizzas and $1.50 draft Miller lights & PBR bottles. The pizzas are thin crust and cut into tiny pieces, very easy to share. 

If you're not into trivia, there are plenty of TVs with all the sports. If you're not into sports, there are video arcade games and gambling. If you're not into those, just go eat pizza with your friends or family."}
{"text":"Pizza is good, even better on half price night.  Beer selection is interesting. Service is spotty, I've had great servers and terrible ones. This location serves a family crowd so if you don't like dining with kids around, avoid this place."}
{"text":"Far off the beaten path for many college students; there are many residential neighborhoods in the area so I imagine this Jupiter's serves more of a family crowd.  Or not.  There are so many different concepts dumped into this place that it's hard to tell.  Most of my visits have been for lunch, so I can't comment on the nature of the place at night.  I also have never participated in the game areas, but friends tell me it's essentially Chuck E. Cheese's for grown-ups.

Jupiter's sticks to thin-crust pizza, and I think they manage to do pretty well with it.  Toppings range from traditional (pepperoni, mushrooms, olives, etc.) to more \"exotic\" fare (artichokes, spinach, salmon, prosciutto, etc.).  Each pizza can be customized with a number of sauces (marinara, pesto, cream etc.), but I usually stick to ordering one of their specialty pizzas since they've already put together some of the best combinations themselves.  Prices are very reasonable for the quality (comparable with chain pizza stores).

There are some fake fireplaces in the first floor dining area.  Although these things obviously lack live fires, I appreciate the real sense of coziness and warmth they provide in the winter.  Many of the tables and furniture are made of some heavy, dark wood product--good for withstanding abuse from youngsters and also giving the whole place a classy feel.

Every seat offers a view of a flat-screen television (I lost count of how many the place had in all), set to ESPN and its various spin-off channels.  I don't have a problem with this, per se, except that they seem to inflict my friends with ADD during our meals.  Set in the center of the building is a large bar that serves a fairly generous list of brews and cocktails (though probably not sufficient to appease snobs accustomed to the great local beer empires like The Blind Pig or Crane Alley).

I've also been invited into the upstairs area for a few parties.  The area offers a lot of privacy, including its own bar and a wide balcony.  I felt they provided an appropriate amount of staff to attend to the guests at these events.  If you're planning to have a grown-up birthday party here, it may be a pain to run between the top floor and the game room in the basement.

Overall, I've had many good experiences eating here at lunch, when they are slow and quiet.  I'm not sure about crowds who hang out here in the evenings, but with it's many rooms and many offerings, it's sure to appeal to lots of different people."}
{"text":"My lobster artichoke dip was a whole artichoke with cream on it. Not really a dip, I need a knife to cut up the artichoke for the dip and there is no lobster in site. 

The pizza was AMAZING!!! 
And the kids loved LOVED the games"}
{"text":"The pizza here is GREAT! Thin, tasty, great variety of toppings, consistently good and perfect size for one person. Their side salad is a good deal and yummy as well. I wish they still had the half portions of the fancier salads because I love their goat cheese and strawberry salad. The service is usually friendly and prompt, especially if they aren't busy. A group I belong to went there recently and we ended up having 15 people with no reservation. They were super gracious about pushing tables together for us and the waitress was really nice about putting everyone on separate checks. I like the bar and tables and layout but wish they had about half as many TV's. It can be a little overwhelming in that regard. Also the soft drinks often taste off, either too much carbonation or too little syrup but that is a minor quibble. Again best thin crust pizza in town!!"}
{"text":"Update: they do have HD now for every tv I saw. On a third visit, I toured the whole place: The gameroom downstairs is a total zoo, with rugrats running amok. As a gamer, I can tell you that the games they feature are a little dated but appear to be in good condition. The top floor has a smoking balcony and a place for a band to play. They have buffet service up there for private parties, but the spread appeared limited to mass portions of their regular menu items.

This brings me to the biggest let down of Jupiter's II for me and the reason this place remains a solid 2 stars: the menu is extremely limited. If you are hungry, they have:  pizza, salads, fried appetizers, and pitas with dips. That is it. That is all. I like pizza a lot, but it is kind of hard to convince the whole crew to come to a place where the selection is so limited."}
{"text":"Food is good. Services is HORRIBLE. Wait staff is so slow. You have to hunt them down for food and drinks"}
{"text":"I like the pizza, other items I have had are standard quality bar food. Never played pool at this location but seem to have a lot of tables. Nice looking bar and most of the time service is good."}
{"text":"I had a meeting with my cycling club on Tuesday. It turns out that they have twice as much beer variety as what is shown on the beer menu! When we suggested to the waitress that they put something on the menu to indicate that they offer more beer than whats listed, she got quite snappy with us.

In general the pizza here is pretty good. It's thin crust and really thin but not quite St. Louis style since they use real cheese. I'm a huge fan of garlic so I like anything with garlic as a topping. The Tuesday special is by far the best. Now that I know they have a pretty varied beer selection, it's even better!

Our cycling group comes pretty often and they're always good about splitting up the check for us."}
{"text":"Food is decent, about what I'd call bar food quality. Service was terrible.  Place wasn't very clean. 

Came for lunch at about 11:45am on a weekday. Ordered pizzas and one buffalo chicken sandwich. Pizzas took over 50 minutes to come out, and even then only because we asked and were told by our server Meghan \"they are sitting in the window just waiting for the sandwich\", we asked her to bring the pizzas out anyway so they don't sit in the window getting cold. Sandwich took another 20 minutes (well over an hour after ordering) at which point everyone eating pizza was done (were they gonna leave the pizzas in the window that entire time?). Manager did comp the sandwich but I don't want free stuff I'd rather have decent service. Other notes were a side of tzatziki sauce that was ordered didn't come out with food and we had to ask another server for it it, and the off-brand ketchup didn't come out til I was halfway done with my fries.

Papa Del's can't open their new location soon enough."}
{"text":"A good craftsman never blames his tools. 
I, however, am not a good craftsman. 
I couldn't make crap on the pool tables there last Wednesday. I took my time, I thought I stayed down, I followed through, I didn't always think WWJD (what would Jamie do) and hit as hard as possible. But I still couldn't make anything. 
Wait, that's wrong, I made the cue ball several times. 
We'd hit and watch the ball roll off, badly. Looks like it's gonna be an easy shot right in front of the pocket... nope, it's off by an inch. 
One time, I took my time, and tried a long shot, that rolled off by 2 inches. 
Granted everyone else played under the same conditions, but they are maybe better craftsmen. 
I, however, am not a good craftsman. 
There is pizza, there is beer, there is other drinks, there is devil boxes, there is a place for kids to be kids, there is pool. There is a Tuesday night half price large pizza special, but it's probably dine in only, ya cheap bastards."}
{"text":"This place is like Pizza Planet and a Bar in one! Pretty great atmosphere, and the buffalo chicken pizza was fantastic. One of the better thin crust pizza places I've visited; will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Jupiter's at this location since 2010. Lately, the quality of service and clientele have been dropping off. We had acceptable service from our waitress tonight, but our condiments were forgotten and we were left at our table waiting for our check. We had a negative interaction with someone who seemed to be a manager- he was abrasive and unnecessarily rude to us. We expressed that we had been waiting on our check and he questioned us in a hostile manner. Still tipped 20% and really enjoyed the food- just not sure if it's worth the stress with the poor staff."}
{"text":"OK, this is not the kind of place I typically enjoy, but their Tuesday night trivia is a pretty good time. Teams compete for free, the emcee is funny and knowledgeable (without being too annoying or intrusive), and the questions can be challenging. They have decent drink specials, but be sure to grab a bite elsewhere before arriving at Jupiter's. The crab dip was *meh* and the pizza looked greasy and cold. The wide-open second level has pool tables, a huge patio, a bar and comfy seating. There is also a stage for who knows what...DJs, Karaoke, dancing, male strippers?? Not really sure. The main level is mostly video and arcade games with tons of kids running around. Not really my thing, but they all seem to be having a good time. I realize it's silly to complain about a bar that's brightly lit when the reason for being there is to play trivia, but I think the ambiance could improve if they would turn down the lights just a tad. 
I was going to rate Jupiter's with only 2 stars, but our server was very sweet and attentive, and all the trivia teams were having a great time. Yeah, I'll be back for trivia again, but it's definitely not a place for hanging out with friends."}
{"text":"Restaurant review
My son is always asking to go to Jupiter because he likes it soo much. When I ask why, he responds with I want to play the games! Unfortunately Champaign does not have any Chuck e Cheese or the equivalent so this will be the closest thing to an arcade. I would say that the games are quite limited and expensive. They did away with the tokens and replaced it with a swipe card. Up to this day I can't figure out how much I am actually paying for the games. My son's favorite would the race car on the first floor which cost 4 credits. Some of the games give tickets others are the classic sport games you would see at Gameworks. I am not impressed, but they have added a lot more games compared to what they had a few years back. The mini bowling alley is gone though. Now on to the main attraction: the food. I can't say that the pizza is spectacular. They use unique ingredients and sauces which you won't find elsewhere. If ind the thin crust dough to be similar a harder version of saltine crackers. Most of the pizzas I feel are under sauced, but that's my opinion. I have tried quite a few pizzas including the special K pizza (it was very dry and the white sauce does not compliment the toppings), salmon pizza ( if you like salmon/fish on your pizza this is a unique experience), pizza hawaii (the classic pineapple/ham pizza, however once again very dry), and the pizza preferito (salami, olive etc pizza, sort of reminds me a of scaled down supreme pizza). In my mind, I think I like papa del's thin crust pizza a bit better than the ones served here. I would say though that the wings appetizers are delicious. Always freshly cooked and multiple sauce selections, better than Buffalo Wild Wings. The one thing I would recommend is going on Tuesday for 1/2 price large pizza. You can't beat that deal.

Pros: unique pizza toppings, arcade for the kids, billiard table

Cons: the crust reminds me a hard saltine, very dry pizza, can get very busy and hard to flag down your waiter

Hidden deals:
Monday: Family night 25 dollars, 1 large pizza, 4 drinks, bread sticks. 1/2 price games
Tuesday: 1/2 price large pizza, 1/2 price billiards and 1.50 miller lite
Thursday: Double ticket
Friday: 1/2 price drafts

Health code rating: A. Tables are clean. Bathroom is shared with the restaurant next door. https://il.healthinspections.us/champaign/estab.cfm?facilityID=1070"}
{"text":"This place is close to my home, so it's an easy place to go for a drink and some good thin crust pizza. Although I like this place, the other reviews about the service are probably true. I've had a few instances that the service just isn't that great. This place is so big that it really needs a lot of organization and attentive wait staff.  

Overall, I like that we have an \"adult chuck-e-cheese\" where every now and again it's fun to enjoy beers, video games, and pool. It's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Jupiter's at the Crossing will never get my business again. We used to take groups of 30+ for family gatherings, we even did our rehearsal dinner there, but I will never support this business again. Not only did you have it set as a \"seat yourself\" on one of your busiest nights of the week - I could see past that, despite it being a royal pain in the butt trying to find seating for my family of four. But my child fell, busted his lip open and at least two of your employees noticed and did NOTHING. We had to request a glass of ice water. Instead, your bartender and waitress were too busy worrying about who was going to tell us we couldn't sit at the table we were at that wasn't labeled \"reserved\". I requested to speak to a manager and the waitress walked away and took orders. When I asked the bartender, she got an attitude, raised her voice and told me I wasn't her problem and stormed away, but at least she got the manager. The only response I got from him was \"well, we're short staffed.\" There was still blood coming from my 3 year old's face and there was no offer of ice or a towel from any of the staff. Completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"This place in one word:  INSANITY.  It is NUTS in there.  It's like a gigantic bar, a gigantic pool hall, and a gigantic chuck e. cheese all smooshed up together in an even more gigantic building.  

It was PACKED tonight, and from what I heard while waiting for a table it's been like that almost every night since it opened.  Packed with 8 year old's birthday parties, cougars on the prowl, older couples out for dinner, and the occasional student (assume there will be more students when school is in session.)

Still got that tasty jupiter's pizza, but in a package even crazier than old jupiter's, if you can believe it."}
