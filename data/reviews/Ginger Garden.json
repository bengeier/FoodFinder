{"text":"We ate there for lunch and got two of the lunch specials. It was good and I liked the variety it came with (my chicken, egg roll, rice, crab puff, soup, and edamame). Good service as well. We will be going back again.   My only complaint was that the kid meal was the same price as the adult meal which I thought was weird, so we opted not to get a kid meal and have our children share with us; I'm glad we did."}
{"text":"Overall the food was hot, a good sign.  However the food was bland.  Two of us had different selections.  Both selections were bland.  I'd not recommend for Chinese food"}
{"text":"Stopped in to check this place out. Very friendly staff. But they could have a sign that said \"seat yourself\". The prices are excellent. I had dinner for one combo and I comes with egg roll and crab puff. Never been offered both. The egg drop soup tasted fresh and the tea was brought promptly along with all the other tasty food. Will be back"}
{"text":"Delicious! I was really impressed with all white meat for the kids meals. I had chicken with snow peas and it was really fresh and yummy...all our meals were light and healthy, not super heavy sauce like with some Asian food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've found a new favorite place! Had the curry chicken and it was wonderful. The staff was friendly and the primary color decor was appealing."}
{"text":"Just tried this place tonight it was amazing everything so fresh and the great customer service"}
{"text":"Was not pleased with our order.  We got Hot and Sour soup, fried rice, Chow Mein, Po Po Platter, and General Tso's.  Hot and Sour did not seem to resemble a typical recipie and was not very good.  Fried Rice and Chow Mein was just ok.  General Tso's was awful with Chicken Meat that was do tough that I could not chew it.  Best part was the ribs in the Po Po Platter.  Everything else was disappointing and more expensive then I expected."}
{"text":"I'm a lo-mein and hot-and-sour soup guy. Tried both and loved them. With the lo-mein, the only thing I would change would be to cut the pork in strips rather than serve in whole chunks. Goes further in the dish and texturally feels better. Besides that, add a little louder music in the dining room, it was fairly quiet.  Great staff, great food. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Visited a week after opening. Service was good and fairly prompt. Ordered two different entrees. Food appeared delicious but not the taste. Very bland. Might give one more try but better Chinese around"}
{"text":"Food excellent. Portions are good. Fried rice is basic, but very tasty. Very clean. Has a limited bar. Quite a few beer by bottle. Great service."}
{"text":"Always good food and good service! Hot & sour soup is my favorite. Come here at least once a week."}
{"text":"Started out great and now it over. My last 3 experiences has brought me here to caution others. The quality in the meat was the first decline and now I've been overcharged twice for what was supposed to be a lunch special. When I called to inquire the representative on the phone lost her ability to understand me. I hope stealing $10 was worth it"}
{"text":"We came back and emphasized we really like SPICY food. We ordered the hot and sour soup...it was SO GOOD! A spicy chicken lo mein and Kung pao beef, plus hot tea due to the cold night. It all hit the spot!! There was plenty of leftovers too. We will be back for more of these dishes!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service, beautiful inside, some of the best Chinese I've had in a really long time. Definitely will be back !"}
{"text":"Best Chinese we've had out here so far. Everything is super fresh and tasty! Owners are very nice and you can tell they are very engaged with their business and customers."}
{"text":"This chinese food is probably the best I have found in Gilbert. And probably arizona as a whole. Food is authentic and delicious. If youre in arizona, check it out! Staff is friendly building is clean. Plenty of parking. Great ambiance for the family. Definitely check it out if youre in the mood for some authentic chinese grub."}
{"text":"We anxiously awaited the opening but ended up disappointed. We ordered 3 entrees with rice and egg rolls.  Upside: Nice friendly staff              Fresh ingredients              Delicious Egg Rolls  Downside: Extremely bland food                  One order was wrong, ordered Black Pepper Beef, got beef with veggies                  Rice containers not full                  Red sauce for egg rolls was maybe 1 tablespoon                  No hot mustard for egg rolls  I don't know if we'll be back, although this place is very near our home. There are 4 other chinese/asian restaurants within 3 miles so depending on your experience they may have competition."}
{"text":"5 stars from us!! Let's just say, in the lady 2 weeks, this is the 3rd time we've eaten here. Egg fried rice is SO good!! We've had the shrimp lo mein twice and both times it was just amazing and full of flavor. I'm so happy thos is right around the corner. It's absolutely delicious. I can't wait to explore the menu more, I need the Singapore noodles in my life!"}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service!! The portions were huge so we had lots of leftovers. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"We got takeout last night and unfortunately it was not good. The sweet and sour chicken sauce tasted like chlorine... un-edible. The kung pao beef was very bland and the shrimp and scallop dish tasted just like the kung pao chicken except the color of the sauce was different. The crab ragoon was the only thing we enjoyed."}
{"text":"Decent neighborhood American Chinese food.  Large portions with fresh ingredients.  The flavor of each item could be improved though.  Friendly service."}
{"text":"My wife and I recently had lunch here and it was pretty good. Everything we wanted we received here. The service was quick and the order was correct. Which is really important to us. Place was very clean which is next to godliness in my opinion."}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time yesterday. I was skeptical when I walked in because the place was empty (around 4pm). But the woman that helped me place an order to go was awesome! Super friendly and helpful answering all my questions. I ordered a ton of food and my favorites were the shrimp with garlic and the potstickers. And their homemade spicy mustard is great. So far this place is yummy, great customer service and we'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in my area.  The people are so friendly and the food is great!  I recommend the House Fried Rice and Kung Pao Tofu - super tasty!  Their Egg Drop Soup and Hot & Sour Soup are also very good."}
{"text":"I love the pan fried noodles. I've tried the orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken and the egg rolls and they were all great. My new favorite Chinese place."}
{"text":"The staff was super friendly and attentive. And the overall restaurant was very clean. But the food just didn't win me over. It was simply okay. This place has amazing potential considering the location but  the food could use more flavor."}
{"text":"We were given the incorrect to go order and didn't realize until we were home 15 minutes later.  However when I called the man on the phone who initially took my order was very helpful and friendly and we went back and received the correct order.  I did very much appreciate that there was no hassle.  As such we had the opportunity to try lots of different food due to having two orders.  We haven't tasted everything but here is what we did have.  The wings 2/5 (bland) Egg rolls 4/5 Spring rolls 5/5 Kung Pao Beef 4/5 (lots of fresh veggies and vibrant sauce) Mongolian Beef 4/5 Sa-Te Chicken 1/5 (we didn't find this appetizing at all) Fried rice 3/5 (bland but good) Pan fried noodles Beef 4/5 (unique noodles that were very good, wish the sauce had more spice)  I didn't initially order the Kung Pao Beef and would order that again for sure, as it was my favorite dish.  All in all we were impressed with the food we ordered.  It is about what you'd expect for take out Chinese food.  Decently good but nothing incredible.  However this was much less greasy and salty that other takeout I've tried.  And the veggies with the dishes were plentiful and fresh!  The portion sizes were all very good.  The service was friendly.  All in all it was a good Chinese take out experience that we will definitely repeat on those takeout, Netflix and chill nights in the future."}
{"text":"Worst food ever! I had heard amazing things about this place so i was excited to try it! Chicken Chowmein was flavorless. Beef and Broccoli was completely bland and the beef was gristle. Honey chicken was overly sweet and none of us could eat it. The Orange Chicken was edible, but for the price we paid, it shouldnt just be edible. And the fried rice?? It was white rice with soy sauce, wtheck??? Panda Express is mediocre yet it would have been a better meal. I'll never go back. It was an expensive epic fail."}
{"text":"Just finishing lunch for first visit to this restaurant. Food was delicious. Seasoning was spot on. Restaurant was very clean and service was outstanding. I highly recommend this excellent establishment. Obviously I will return."}
{"text":"I'm basing this review STRICTLY on the quality of their appetizers and noodle dishes, but damn! The flaky crispness on the spring rolls and crab rangoon was outstanding, and this was AFTER the drive home. But--even better--  the scrumptious sauce on their vegetable low mein must have crack in it. The noodles were cooked to absolute perfection; I couldn't get enough. I will definitely be back again. (and again... and again... and again...) Nom!"}
{"text":"Great food and very friendly staff. We've ordered takeout twice so far and the food has been exactly how we ordered it and hot and fresh. So happy to have this place close to home, we'll be visiting often!"}
{"text":"So far, this is the best Chinese food we've had in the 2+ years that we've lived here. We had shrimp fried rice, beef and broccoli and egg rolls. Place looks clean and service was great!"}
{"text":"Nice people.  Clean place.  I frequently get the opportunity to eat Chinese food in NY.  It wasn't quite NY style but...the egg rolls are more like fried spring rolls.  But they tasted fresh and home made.  The pot stickers were also very good.  I am pretty sure these were Home made too.  Kung Pao chicken very flavorful.  It wasn't real spicy (wish it was).  There was a lot of vegetables..not so much meat.  But, tasted good.  Respectful portions.  They aren't shy with giving rice which I appreciate.  They serve alcohol.  Chow fun noodles also seemed to be home made.  Cooked perfectly.  So many other places over cook them.  I'll go back and try another dish.  Prices were maybe $1 too high but if they keep everything fresh tasting then I don't mind.  Veggies had a nice crunch.  Everything tasted like it was freshly prepared."}
{"text":"After reading all of these reviews one of two one things is occurring. Either it was a really off night or perhaps this was the first time they have encountered asian food? We ordered the war wonton soup/beef lo-mein/2 orders of crab puffs/hot and sour soup/kung-pao beef/orange chicken/sweet and sour chicken and that came to $72.00. The war wonton was 1/2 cabbage the beef lo-mein was rather tasteless. The kids said the sweet and sour chicken was not crispy and didn't taste good. The wife said at least we tried it and now we know. I'm just disappointed, I didn't even finish the wonton soup usually the stock of a soup carries the rest of the ingredients. I just felt like the people whom made the soup didn't taste it as they were making it. I would expect that if it was made from a mix at olive garden or panera bread. This place is a mile from our house but its extremely bland food we have as a family decided we won't be back. I see these Yelp Elite reviewers and on wonder are they being 100% honest? I know they are not paid but perhaps they tell the \"eats\" I'm yelp elite and thus they get a better meal?   Good Luck out there."}
{"text":"my family & i waited months for this place to open, and it was worth it! my picky 3 y/o loudly declared the chicken and fries \"FANTASTIC!\" which is about the highest praise you can get. lunch menu is great food quality and quantity; i could honestly eat about 1/3 of what they give you and still be happy. will come back again!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and definitely not our last! We came at 11:30 on a Sunday and we were the only ones in the restaurant. We were greeted very quickly and nicely, by the owner (I think). The place was sooo extremely clean- no sticky highchair for my toddler is a WIN when it comes to cleanliness lol. And the menu is really big and has something for everyone!   We don't eat a lot of meat in my family but some places we can't hold back our love for saucy, battered, fried chicken..haha. So I ordered the Lunch Special \"Crispy Teriyaki Chicken\" and my husband ordered the Lunch Special \"Orange Chicken\". A lunch special comes with an egg roll, a crab fried wonton, soup, fried rice, and your choice of main entree. I know the dishes we both ordered were only $6.95 each and it was a tonnnnn of food. We got our toddler a Kids \"Lo Mein and Fried Rice\".   The food was really good. My husband's dish had a hot pepper next to it but it wasn't spicy at all! He doesn't mind that kind of thing tho. His chicken was huge and gooey and crunchy and just how you want orange chicken to be. My crispy teriyaki chicken was so yummy. The sauce poured all over mine was sweet and sticky. The chicken was somehow still crispy under all of it. It was delish!! The fried rice was actually how my family likes it- pretty plain! Not a ton of veggies as a filler in the rice. My son's lo mein was soooo good; he ate an adult man's portion of it and there was still a lot left over for cold leftovers *heart eyes*!!! The owner even asked if he wanted veggies in his noodles, which is very nice because I know some kids won't touch those crazy green things! Lol. Egg rolls were fried perfectly and had yummy filling. I don't eat crab so I didn't try that thing. And the hot n sour soup was better than the plain egg drop soup, in my opinion, because I like spice in my life!!   My parents also came and they got the Lunch Special \"General Tsos Chicken\" and the Lunch Special \"Mongolian Chicken\" and they both loved theirs too.   Nice, friendly service. Clean restaurant (playing football on the TV) yessss! And good grub to fulfill any Chinese food craving! What more could you ask for?!"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night and it was great! Best server,service I've seen in awhile.the waitress was amazing,bubbly and so friendly.the food from the soup appetizer to main course was really pretty good.not greasy,very fresh and tasty! We loved it and will be back.we live in East Mesa so it's a little drive but well worth it."}
{"text":"Splendid customer service and GREAT FOOD!!!!! Seriously one of the best American Chinese food I've ever eaten!!! Tastes just like authentic cantonese food."}
{"text":"Presentation and service was good, but a little too salty for my taste.  We had several types of Mein, , chicken corn soup , but the sweet and sour chicken was probably the best dish we tried."}
{"text":"So glad there's a good Chinese restaurant nearby!!  I love the Kung Pao chicken (extra spicy) with fried rice!! I order it extra spicy because I didn't think it was very spicy the first time I came here.  Even ordering extra spicy I could still do more spice, but then again, I love super spicy food!  Either way- I'm addicted!  I should branch out and try other items on their menu, but I'm a creature of habit.  My bf and family have all been here too so I've tried food off their plates and I've liked everything I tasted so far!    This place would be even more amazing if they delivered through door dash or Uber eats or something.  One time I was craving Chinese but didn't feel like leaving the house.  I ordered Kung pao from a different restaurant that delivered and literally took two bites and threw it out.  It was flavorless and I immediately regretted ordering from somewhere other than Ginger Garden!  Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the family special. There was a lot of food and the helpings were large, but it was all very average."}
{"text":"I came if for some take out.  Good customer service, nice atmosphere.  I had the Mongolian beef.  It was a bit spicy, lots of onions, and I liked it.  I also had an order of crab puffs.  They were good as well.  They had my order ready pretty quickly.  I wish they delivered.  I would go back!"}
{"text":"We were excited to try this restaurant as we love Chinese food and it's literally around the corner from our house.  Very friendly staff and quick service.  We ordered the family special. Hubby had hot and sour soup, I had won ton. Both were good.  The ribs have an amazing sauce and eggroll was delish. The shrimp was ok. Fried rice and sweet and sour chicken were good...typical, I think. I substituted Happy Family for a dish in the family special since I have loved that dish in the past at a N.Calif. restaurant.  However, the meats and scallops in the Happy Family seemed a little undercooked. The sauce was good, though. I thought the food was good...hubby thought it was bland. The open flame taste that sets great Chinese food apart from just average was definitely missing in all of the dishes we tried. Overall opinion is that it's good but not extraordinary."}
{"text":"Great food! We love this place. The food is great and the service is better! And $6 sake bomber grand opening special!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I really wanted to like this place. It's less than half a mile from our house and we haven't been able to find any great Chinese food in the area... But boy did it let us down. As others have said, the food is very bland. We got the Kung pao beef, orange chicken, and the pupu platter. We wanted to try it all... And it all was below average. Too much breading on the fried items, almost zero flavor for the deep fried shrimp. My beef dish also had zero flavor. The orange chicken tasted slightly burnt and very bland.  I really hope the owners view this and make changes as I would love to have this be our go-to Chinese restaurant...  We may try it again in another 6 months or so and see if anything changes. As of now I would not recommend trying this place out. Giving it 2 stars simply due to location and convenience for us."}
