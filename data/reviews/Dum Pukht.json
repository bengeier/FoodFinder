{"text":"Place is very nice looking. Service staff was somewhat unorganized and unable to articulate menu or ingredients. My husband ordered a sizzling plate that immediately had the fire detector go off, so all guest were sitting eating with the blaring fire alarm going off. We ordered some chicken coconut curry, paneer, lamb and some other stuff....unfortunately my husband, friend and I have a terrible case of food poisoning that's been going on since Friday after our visit here. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Awful service.  Lost our reservation.  Food came out at a glacial pace.. almost 3 hours till we got mains.  No water refills.  Smallest portion sizes I've ever seen at an Indian resto and thus overpriced.  Overall a Mother's Day disaster!  Only saving grace was the food was actually good, but I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Pros -Cutlery (cool knives) -Decor (nice accessories) -Naan (nice view of kitchen) -Funny name -Clean -Decent meal  Cons -Small portions -Restaurant was freezing (wouldn't change the temperature) -Flickering light almost gave me a seizure (Don't come if you suffer from epilepsy) -Lentil soup was nasty -Bad service -Long wait time -Lack of concern for customer satisfaction"}
{"text":"i would give it 0 stars if I could. Walked in 2:50 pm on a weekday. Unwelcoming atmosphere, uninterested staff, immediately says \"we close in 10 minutes\". So what? Basically asking customers to beat it. Very rude, unprofessional, and just does not care. They dont want your business so go somewhere else."}
{"text":"A friend and I went for dinner. He ordered the Dum Biryani and I had the Lamb dish. Both of them were delicious. The place was empty. But, it was Monday. The service needs improvement. Only 4 occupied tables, no one came to enquire how the food was, or we needed more water. I still give it a 5 star. Hope they improve their service and show customers that they care."}
{"text":"Amazing food with excellent service and ambiance. I would highly recommend this place for anyone that is looking to find a new all time favourite indian restaurant."}
{"text":"Not worth the price, $15+ tax, you get a 7\" round container of biryani and yogurt, no napkins and cutlery. Not planning to visit again."}
{"text":"The lamb  briyani was delicious. The butter chicken very flavourful. The dum Pukht mutton tender and the palak paneer spicy. All in all the perfect Indian dinner! I will most definitely be going back. It didn't get a 5 star as the service was a tad slow."}
{"text":"This restarount have nice decor and good environment. But the price and the quality of food is 2 stars.  I got the buffet it was $15 and for a 3 year old it was $9 , it was not worth buffet. The price is to high.  The food have no flavour.  I would never go back. The service was not good if your brown."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the service is excellent. I am a frequent visitor and will continue to be in future. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Dum Phukt for the past year now. It's the perfect blend of Indian Cuisine and Modern Ambience. The food is custom made for your spice level and is always fresh and hot. It has a fully functional bar area and also has ample seating. On weekdays, it's mostly corporate people visiting but on weekends more families with kids come. A wide variety of vegetarian options are also available. A perfect place for a date or taking clients out."}
{"text":"Lovely Ambience. Authentic Indian food.  But we heard the serving staff complain of long hours to the owner in front of us. We walked in at about 2:00pm and our server was in a rush to serve us our food. While the food and ambience was definitely worth visiting again I hope they train their people better."}
{"text":"Would give this a zero if possible. Absolutely terrible service had a reservation at 8 but they overbooked and made us wait for 2 hours. Then once we got the table, no one came to us to serve us. Had to write on a piece of paper to order because they were taking so long. We were waiting for hours starving. Terrible service!"}
{"text":"The food and service was good. I would recommend getting the bryani and the chicken dum pukht. Also the tables don't leave you with much legroom.  The d√©cor is nice but I bit over done. Especially look out for the light show and different wall patterns in the washrooms."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something different while visiting the 'south' so I decided to try Indian food.  After reading some of the reviews on here; I decided to try the lamb biryani started by some samosas. The food was good, bit I found that the lamb lacked flavour. There was a great little creamy dip provided that I dipped the lamb in. I also tried an Indian beer brewed in New York (haha).  The restaurant is beautiful to say the least, but my the guy clearing my plates was wearing a Simpson's hoodie; not sure if he was the bus boy (elder man) or what."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing experience from start to finish. For a Saturday night when a restaurant expects to have the most crowd, the service is way too slow. On top of that the food is barely even close to being called \"authentic Indian\" food. It's mostly bland food. We ordered their specialty \"Dum Pukht\" Chicken Biryani. It is mushy sticky steamed rice out of a rice cooker, mixed with bland chicken curry. Yes it's made it to look fancy by sealing the pot with a roti, but the actual dish is nowhere even close to an authentic biryani. The Butter Chicken had no taste, completely bland. The sizzler kababs were dry. The mutter malai methi had no taste of methi in it, again completely bland. I could not even taste the salt in any of the dishes, that's how bland they were.  When asked about the slow service, we were told that all staff and chefs were working on the party in the banquet hall. Is that really an excuse for your paying customers in a fine dining restaurant on a Saturday night? As well, the dishes are overpriced. For 2 adults and 2 children, we paid close to $90!  Do yourself a favour and save your money and avoid this place. There are much better and much more \"reasonable\" and \"authentic\" Indian restaurants in the GTA."}
{"text":"I was really intrigued to try this place after noticing it's trendy exterior for the first time. Went here with friends and was greeted by a friendly server. We ordered goat curry, lamb Dum Pukht biryani, butter chicken and butter and garlic naan. Biryani was full of spices and flavour. Goat curry was too salty but nothing some naan couldnt fix. Butter chicken was delicous. Loved how the table came with papadums and sauces. Service was good but we didn't need to be asked how we were 6 or 7 times too many. Super friendly staff though :P"}
{"text":"Came for my sister's birthday and didn't know that it would be busy, so when we got to the restaurant the owner told us it would be a wait of 25 minutes. We decided we were going to go somewhere else as no one had ate and were starving. The owner then told us don't worry it would be 25 mins and by the time we went somewhere else it would have taken just as long, so we decided to wait. No one gave us updates except for a nice waiter who told us he had seen us waiting and to move to the bar so he would be able to see us and seat us right away. We decided to move and wait there. By this time it had already been 30 minutes. During that time we asked the woman who was working at the front (his daughter) how much longer and they said give them 10 more minutes. The owner said we're not going to let you go without eating, we nicely noded. The same waiter who talked to us earlier told us he was trying to get a table cleared. Finally we were at 1hr 5 minutes and we decided we wanted to leave. The waiter said a table may be clearing if we wanted to wait, he could seat us in 10 more minutes. We decided to stay as we had already waited. I had seen the owner at that table with our server and the server has pointed to us implying we had been waiting and he was going to seat us. The man then came to us and instead of taking us to the table he apologized and said I'm sorry the table has been given away. We immediately left. I can't believe how greedy the owner was lying to us (and many others) about the wait and then giving away the table to someone else (perhaps someone he knew). His behaviour was extremely unprofessional and honestly rude. I understand there can be a wait but to grossly misrepresent how long it would be to get more business and then to give our table away to someone else is wrong. Basically our whole night was ruined and no one was in the mood to go out after that. We will not be returning and will let others know about our experience here."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 6.5/10.   The food was actually good, however, the service could use some improvement.  We wanted to order take out for the office, and right off the bat we knew service was definitely compromised, but we had already made plans for the entire office.  We called in 8 times however nobody picked up our calls, we had to drive to place our order and go back for pickup as it took some time to prepare.  Upon arrival nobody greeted us, and we struggled to find the desk/help.  Mind you, one of the guys was serving the table beside us, saw us looking for help yet said nothing.  We helped ourselves by looking around and finally placed our order, I asked why nobody answers the calls, the guy pointed to the guests and said \"we're busy\", I guess they don't care for customers unless they are dining in.  Anyways, we noticed only 2 waiters in a place full of people, clearly they need more help and customer service skills, not once did they smile or say thank you/please.  We picked up our food, the guy didn't even give us the change, I guess he assumed he deserved the tip, though not much.  Luckily the food was good, otherwise I'd never recommend it.  If you don't care for good service, I would def recommend this place, otherwise save yourself the disappointment and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this restaurant! It had great ambiance, good food, and excellent customer service."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN. This place is not what it once was. I came in here today to give it another try but the staff was as lost as ever. I ordered appetizers and told the waitress that I was only ordering appetizers but when I asked for the bill the waitress was surprised I was asking for it so soon (so annoying). When the first appetizer came, the shami kebab, it was like warm at best. When we questioned if it was freshly made they just said they would warm it up. We also ordered the veggie sizzler and that was mediocre. The malai paneer was stale. It's sad that this restaurant has deteriorated in quality so much since it was amazing when it first opened."}
{"text":"The restaurant closes at 10:00pm, I arrived at 9:30pm with a friend....yes, I was THAT guy, but we were too hungry to care.  SERVICE: Waitress seemed disappointed that we showed up so late and said she will have to check if the kitchen is still open, luckily the Chef was walking by and said it was ok to seat us.  I was SURE we were going to get bad service, but surprisingly the service was EXCELLENT.  You can see the guy making the Naan and the only minor complaint is that he was scratching his head and then continue to touch our Naans.  eeeeh...no big deal I guess...we were so hungry, we decided to ignore that.  FOOD: 1 Butter Naan 1 Regular Naan 1 Shahi Paneer 1 Fish Masala 1 Rice (Saada Chawal)  It was more than enough food for 2 people.    NAANS:  I think it was the BEST Naan in the city.  Slightly crispy and very fresh.   Shahi Paneer/Fish Masala:  Flavour was excellent.  A little bit on the spicy side, which we both like.  Both items were missing a little bit of salt.  The other complaint (which I do not really blame the chef as we showed up late) is that I wish he would have cooked the dishes just a slightly longer as you can still feel the rawness of the spice.  Was kind of disappointed that they used Basa Fish for Fish Masala.  Once again, this does not take away the anything from the amazing flavour of the dishes.  Overall/repeat:  Just some minor hiccups, but I would definitely repeat and give them another chance and next time, we will probably show up earlier."}
{"text":"It's places like these that make you want to review food! They have placed emphasis on everything that makes a good restaurant- the food, ambience (although slightly tacky for my taste) and service. The owner seemed involved with the ongoing although helped out as well.  Don't expect a fancy silver service but for sure there is a warmth in it. I got the dahi bhalla and the chicken dum pukht biriyani. The dahi bhalla was good...a mix of what you get in the south and north of india.  And as I was typing I got handed a warm towel in a neat plastic wrap to wipe my hands with! Nice touch :) now I feel happy about the five stars for sure ;)  The dum biriyani came wrapped in a dough and had to be cut open. It was fragrant, on the spicier side just like I need it to be. The curd that comes along was a bit less, but since I had the dahi bhalla, made up for it. All in all a real good place, restored my faith in food in Toronto a bit"}
{"text":"The best Indian food in the city. The weekday lunch buffet is worth every penny and the quantity is a lot. Ambience is nice and an absolute recommendation."}
{"text":"Excellent quality food - well presented with fine cutlery - only the service was tardy a bit initially but got up to speed later on"}
{"text":"Right when I walked in, I felt like my eyes got assaulted with the amount of decor happening but I slowly adjusted to it and actually enjoyed the amount of time/effort put into designing this restaurant. The restaurant is a little cold though so grab a sweater if you're planning to come by.  Food was good - not the best Indian I've had but decent. We ordered a tandoori chicken (half), goat rogan josh and butter chicken. The dishes weren't spicy or flavourful enough but that's just my take because I like to add a lot of spices when I make Indian food.  Prices were fair considering the portion size (usually they serve it to you in a tiny bowl). We ended up spending around $60.  I used to go to the one in Flemingdon Park called Shaheen Tika & Kebab House but the cook (apparently) left to work at Safa Tika & Kebab House and now (apparently) he is no longer there so we go to Kennedy and Ellesmere/Lawrence area to Karaikudi (which has amazing butter chicken)."}
{"text":"If you don't give this place at least a 4/5 well then you Dum son! While there might be an endless stream of mildly hilarious puns a white dude like me could make about this name at first glance, I'd be remiss if I didn't explain what the name actually means (to show I'm not ignorant).   Dum Pukht, according to a new Yelp friend of mine, means \"that which is cooked with steam\". However, It should mean \"That which is cooked perfectly and full with flavour\" because in my humble opinion, the food here is on point!!  Our group split up into smaller groups of 3-4 to allow for easier sharing  and bill splitting, and while I was looking with FOMO as the others got their food, I feel our dining trio did pretty well.  We ordered the Mango salad, Veggie Samosa Appetizer, Butter Chicken, the Dum Pukht special shrimp Biryani another chicken dish (yellow sauce) and Garlic Naan.  The mango salad was pretty good, having ordered this dish in Thai restaurants I was expecting something similar, so I was surprised then it was actually a lettuce and mango mixture. Still great though and very flavourful and refreshing.   The samosa was quite small and you received 4 in an order. That said, they were prepared fresh and came out piping hot and full of flavour.  The butter chicken was just shy of a religious experience for my mouth. I know it's hard to tell the difference between one butter chicken and another. But believe me when the chicken is moist still and the sauce is so velvety that is slides across your tongue with ease - you'll know the difference between good bad and HALLELUJAH!!! Paired with the garlic buttery naan and I could have married this dish (if I wasn't already engaged).  Equally delicious was the special DP shrimp biryani which was packed with shrimp and them topped with naan (like a bread bowl almost) and baked/finished in the tandoor. The best is the presentation at the table when the server cuts open the bowl for you and pulls back the bread to reveal what treasures await you inside!  Definitely coming back when I'm in Markham, especially when the bill for 3 of us (including drinks) was less than $80! Come here, have the butter chicken...  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place from people I work with.  They raved about it so I thought I would give it a try since I was craving for Indian food.   We didn't know we had to make reservations but was told that they will see if there were any unreserved spots for us. I was happy they had one for us because we were very hungry. We sat down and noticed that the seats were not wiped down. There was still food debris on them. The table was a little dirty as well. Then it took about 10 minutes before we got our menus. If you can look past the messy seats, the decore is actually pretty nice. You can also see the chefs cook.   Now with the ordering. We asked the waiter for recommendations but he seemed more interested in just rushing us to order. We ended up ordering the chicken sampler dish which came with three types of chicken.  It was tasty but wished the portions were a little bigger.  Next we had the shrimp briyani. It was baked in sort of bread that opened up like a pie. it wasn't bad but not as flavourful as I had hoped for.  Maybe we should have ordered the chicken briyani.   We didn't have the best experience here and I certainly don't believe it was worth the price."}
{"text":"We dined at Dum Pukht on a Saturday, Feb 21, 2016. When we arrived at the restaurant, we were promptly ushered in to our table. The ambiance of the restaurant is good.The staff was very polite and attentive. Myself and my wife both ordered vegetarian dishes (Vegetable Biryani, malai kofta, Paneer Tikka masala and lachcha paratha). The food came within reasonable time. All the items were really tasty, full of flavour and authentically prepared. Then we ordered kulfi falooda and it was also very good. We really liked the experience overall and would recommend it to others. We would definitely come back in future."}
{"text":"Service is AWFUL! Food is mediocre, just be ready to spend $80-$100 for extremely small portions. We dined here at 5:30 on a Sunday, only one other table was dining at the time. Not once did any server come to ask if we needed anymore refills or any more naan (we needed both of those things). We had finished our meal for 30 mins before we just got fed up and stopped someone to give us our bill. Even the owner did not care that people are waiting around he just kept walking past completely ignoring us. We could hear the table bext to us also complaining about how long they had to wait before they flagged someone down to take their order. Not worth the money at all. If you enjoy professional and curteous service then do not go here!"}
{"text":"In a nutshell, it's decent Indian food with Average service in a extravagantly decorated atmosphere!! I mean, the restaurant is so extravagant (a little over the top- but pretty none the less)!!! I would give it 4 stars - but it lost a star because of the mango shake. I take shakes&lassis seriously at Indian restaurants.  I recommend that you do NOT, DO NOT come here for any special days aka Mother's Day, Father's Day unless you like mediocre food with a side of sass and attitude. Have an enjoyable meal elsewhere- or try it here another day.  Must try: dum briyani (obviously!!)  Overall The place looks great, the menu is extensive and the food is decent. For special occasions, a change in atmosphere definitely would consider this place. I will come here again to try some chicken dishes and maybe even the lobster dish!  We tried coming here without reservations Sunday evening and it was booked solid. So- just a note there.  We tried the onion bhaji which was good- maybe a little overdone in the fryer but it tasted fine.  Dishes to try: baigan patiala, dum briyani, chicken shahi korma (I asked for it spicy- they made it on one visit without fuss, the second visit The waiter wasn't accommodating). The naans were great!  Dishes to avoid: cashew curry, coconut shrimp curry    Pros: generous serving sizes, flavourful and a neat presentation   Cons: Mango shake (sadly this was not up to par- they need to revamp this recipe to make it more restaurant quality and less Indian banquet hall quality). I'm a polite patron usually, the only thing is I ask for things spicy. I've had some Sassy waitstaff on occasion... Makes me consider dropping it down a star.   I think if you're not a local of this cuisine, you may get better treatment."}
{"text":"Loved it. Dropped in for lunch.Definitely coming back to do dinner. Bringing friends for our supper club. We are new to  this cuisine and they are so helpful guiding us."}
{"text":"If you wish to ruin you special day this is the perfect place to go to.   We were one of the many couples whose Valentines Day was ruined at Dum Pukht. *Dirty Plates,  *Food took over an hour to be served, *A beverage refill was totally ignored,  *Had to ask multiple times for our bill, ultimately had to walk up to the register and pay as I witnessed the couple at the next table wait a half hour just to get theirs. Had anyone walked out without paying no one would have noticed. Service was a total DISASTER!! Staff is very poorly trained. People running this place seem to have no clue how to run a restaurant. You could see every patron was mad. Had to forego dessert as that would have probably taken another hour.   I give them 1 star for their Food and Quality which is really good, and another for their decor which is very impressive.   It's a shame a place like this gives all Indian Restaurants a bad rep, as any one who might be trying Indian cuisine for the first time will never want to go back to another Indian restaurant expecting similar service.    I sincerely hope this was a one time situation as they could do so much better.."}
{"text":"Visited for lunch on a weekday. Parking plentiful and interior d√©cor is very nice and comfortable.  There is an all-you-can-eat lunch option (order to table, not buffet) but our party opted to share an assortment of a-la-cart items as this provided more variety.  The food is freshly made (try the Naan, really)  and the \"Dum Pukht\" style of cooking which I experienced for the first time but found very flavourful and satisfying.   This is a great spot for a relatively quick lunch but I look forward to trying it for dinner with the family."}
{"text":"My sister and I came here for my birthday dinner.   The food was very flavourful and fresh, but the portions seemed small for the price.   The server was also very awkward. He looked uncomfortable serving us. Not sure if it's because my sister and I are young women, but the server stood a bit far away from the table when talking to us and never made eye contact.    After we left the restaurant, we asked the other if they felt that awkward tension, and we both agreed. It was kinda funny in hindsight, but it definitely made the experience less than ideal.   I might be back, but I'll never dine in. Take out only if you want to enjoy your food in a good atmosphere (at home on your couch)."}
{"text":"I am so glad to find such an extraordinary place near home to get Indian food.  One of my favourite cuisines is Indian... and this place makes delish food! My family and I ordered: mutton biryani, shrimp briyani, butter chicken, rogan josh (lamb), chicken tikka masala, garlic naan, and the mint chicken (I can't remember the exact name). But everything was delicious. We devoured Everything in 15 mins.    The only reason I give this place 4 instead of 5 stars is because the papadom they gave at the start to eat (complimentary) was cold, dry and salty.  Also they place their glasses and two chutney sauces outside before you're seated.  And the glasses were dusty (we had to request them to change it) and one of the sauces they had outside had a fly in it -- I asked the waiter to change this to a new one. And the manager came out an apologized and added us complimentary glubjman as desert.    Service was really good in that aspect.  All in all I will be back to satisfy my Indian cravings! Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"I'm not the best at ordering India food. The server assisted me in ordering my peas and cheese dish, I still  don't know what it's called.  The green chicken was amazing ( see picture), can't recall what it's called either. Service is amazing, a little slow on a Wednesday evening.I over ordered look like . Hey do yourself a favor drop in and taste the amazing food."}
{"text":"Food tasted good and freshly made. Down side was the service, plates not very clean and service. Takes very long time... 15 minutes to get the order and another 15 minutes to be served and 10 minutes to get the bill. If plate are cleaned and service improved this place could become even more popular as the people are nice and food tested good."}
{"text":"7 of us went here for a work lunch. No problems parking. Entrance is on the side. The interior of this restaurant is beautiful. It was dark, but not too dark. Fancy, but not overly fancy. A portion of the kitchen is visible, where you can see someone making the naan, which was pretty cool.  We were Instantly greeted and seated. We went at 12:30pm on a Thursday and it was not busy, but not empty either. We decided to go with the 17.99/pp \"buffet\" style service, which is a set menu that is still served to your table. We had pasta salad, corn soup, 2 types of chicken, rice, naan, 2 veggie dishes and honestly... I was super impressed. Eggplant and lentil dishes were a *little* too spicy for me, but the coconut curry chicken... will have me returning for sure.  Everyone I was with was definitely loving it and already wants to make plans to go back. My only small complaint was that I felt like I was being watched, as I was eating. I understand that in order to bring the next course, the servers need to pay some attention to the table but I felt as if it was more blatant staring than 'checking up.'  Meh, I will still go back."}
{"text":"Ambiance- hmmm....how can I explain. Imagine a wedding banquet hall. The glamour - the lights and clean and massiveness. Buuuut- you don't have to wear a blazer and pants and  instead go shorts and flip flops. Yes- that pretty sums up the ambiance. Good lighting- Great decor - furniture and spacing.  Service-It was pretty dead and there was only one server. He was pretty diligent. We got seated at a booth and the guy making the naans can be seen thru a glass wall and he was kind of staring at us. I dont blame him tho- as we are in his field of view...so I guess it isn't creepy because we are in his line of sight.   Food- The naans are humongous.  I would order 1 per person as they slice in 4 pieces. Ordered the aloo paratha as well. $4 a little steep but tasted  amazing. It was 2 of us so we got ambitious and ordered 2 curries. Did not need that much as we ended up taking most of it home. We ordered the chicken dum pukth, my snapchat friends loved it. When the waiter slices the bread seal that it is cooked in and folds the bread. I actually ate the bread like me own indian naan taco. The chicken was flavorful and tasty- and more then enough for 2 people. Also got the lamb vindaloo- a little too sour for my liking even though the meat was tender and very well prepared. The chicken easily takes the win for flavor.  Price- $15 an item- this place is one of the more expensive indian restaurants in the area. Compared to Taste of India down the street which offers AYCE for the same price. However- for the right mood, privacy and experience it is perfect.  It was worth it!!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the \"better\" Indian restaurants in the area! And better in terms of: decor, service, and ambiance. Food wasn't too bad either.  I came here on a Thursday night around 7 PM. The restaurant was pretty empty but my friend said people usually came a bit later for dinner, and she wasn't lying. By the time we left, there were several tables just getting set up/receiving their foods. We ordered biryani and tandoori chicken. Our server opened our biryani once it arrived to the table. The chicken was juicy and hearing it \"sizzle\" on the plate made my mouth water! We also had crispy papadum on the side.  Overall, a good experience and great for business meals and/or a desire for \"fancier\" Indian food."}
{"text":"Went as a group for lunch. Their \"buffet\" is essential at the table, not self serve. They don't ask you if you need food, you have to ask them, found this out after begging almost, after only eating a few pieces of chicken. The other end of our group was closer to the kitchen so perhaps better fed. Food was bad ,not hot and always the same 2 or 3 dishes, will not go back ."}
{"text":"3.5 Interesting atmosphere - more of a lounge style.  - Biryani lamb has lots of spices (and more than I can handle) with tender lamb pieces.  - Butter chicken was average, but it contained lots of meat in it which I liked - Chicken tikka (I enjoyed the most) was grilled and flavourful. Tender and moist that came on a hot sizzling plate  The naan we ordered was a bit burnt that lost the fluffiness and became hard Overall, the food was good but on the pricier side. Service was attentive."}
{"text":"Food was pretty decent. I had the special dum pukht (sounded like \"dum foo\" when the waiter pronounced it) with lamb. The presentation was very interesting, with the naan bread covering the bowl with the rice and lamb inside. Rice and lamb were seasoned very nicely, not dry at all. The sauce was slightly spicy but definitely not spicy enough that you can't finish it. Aside from the food and the loungy decor, which were both amazing, everything else seemed to fall apart at this restaurant. Sat night at this restaurant was packed! Walked in with 2 other families and waited for close to 20 minutes to get a table. The owner didn't know we were first in line so he gave it to the family behind us because the dad talked to him in Hindi. That wasn't very nice but I guess you get preferential treatment when you speak the language. Seems like many families come here for birthday celebrations and the owner would personally greet them in Hindi. Tip: make a reservation before you come. Seriously, they will hold for you even if you show up late. Their utensils were kind of dirty (see attached picture). My spoon had a white spot on it and it stayed on even after I tried rubbing it against the napkin. Overall, food-wise Id give it 5 star, atmosphere 4 star (they also had a little corner beside the bar just for group drinking), service 2 star (owner ignored us entire time, long wait, dirty utensils, and the waiter that cleaned the table kept on brushing the food off to the seats, ew!)"}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: Dum Pukht has very nice decor in a dimly lighted setting. It has an overall classy look and a quiet atmosphere.  SERVICE: The service here isn't the fastest, but I was also with a party of eight, so I'm sure the large order contributed to this.  FOOD: I had lamb vindaloo which was surprisingly tough and dry. However, I tried another lamb dish at the table, and that meat was tender and cooked properly. The chat papri was a great appetizer, too. For dessert I had gulab jamun which was just as I'd hoped it would be based on previous experiences eating it in my home town.  VALUE: The portions are a tad small for the prices, but overall this place isn't a bad buy. A few tweaks here and there could improve this aspect."}
{"text":"The food is decent-good. The service is very bad and the restaurant desperately needs to upgrade it's decor. We ordered chicken biryani and we got the lamb instead. The waiter insisted it was chicken until the manager came out and confirmed it was lamb. As a result, the manager offered us a free biryani. The lamb chops are excellent and the biryani was decent, but the samosas were very dry. We will go back but just be ready for bad service - the waiters have no clue what they are doing but they are friendly nonetheless."}
{"text":"This is almost like my go to restaurant when I crave for Indian food in Markham. I keep coming back for the fish masala and introduced it to my brother. He agreed that it was tasty too. The level of spice is just right and the sauce was nicely done. We ordered the curry lobster, I find that a little too dry.   The Papadum were so fresh and they have different flavoured naan such as garlic, butter, they were all tasty.   I find some lighting a little too bright but that is just my personal preference, I like more dimmer lighting in restaurants. Anyways will come back for more fish masala!"}
{"text":"Service, service, service!! When will businesses learn that service means everything?  Dum Pukht (hate the name btw) while well decorated and designed, failed to provide adequate service during my visit. The food while a bit on the pricey side, was well seasoned and flavourful. We ordered the chicken tikka sampler, the coconut fish curry, and their chef featured biryani dish. While all dishes were good, albeit the dry biryani, the 1 hour wait was ridiculous even when the server/manger apologized three times. My rule is if u apologize twice, thens its three strikes! Drinks had to be asked for, the wine was returned as the glass was filthy!! We had to ask for menus, as well as the complimentary papadum. I can understand it was a busy night but when staff are not trained to be interactive and empowered to take initiative in helping customers that's just plain dumb!  The manager did offer to pay for one glass of wine.  Sorry guys, but you need to work on your service game."}
{"text":"I Dum Pukht up indeed (Pun credit to Kris U.) For some reason, I forgot that 1) Indian food is primarily spicy 2) My tolerance level of spice can be categorized as \"really sad\". It's like a slow burn that catches up to you and suddenly you realize you're sweaty and can't stop sniffling. Even then, I kept eating so the food must be pretty good. Between two people, we got the chicken sampler platter, the shrimp biryani, and a cheese naan. We also got a taste of the chicken pakora from our generous Yelp friends that shared their food.   The standout to me was definitely the shrimp biryani, which is a bowl of fried rice and shrimp with a piece of naan baked on top. The flavours were very unique and something about the spice mix made it incredibly aromatic, it was almost flowery. The chicken sampler platter was tender and tasty as well and the chicken pakora is something I would definitely get again if I were to go to an Indian restaurant. The absolutely perfect way to cool down the spice was a mango lassi, which I thought was too sweet at first but it worked its magic when taken alongside the food.   Two things were a bit of a miss for me, however. One, the service was quite slow. Though the servers were friendly, it was a good 45 minutes between ordering and eating. We also had to ask multiple times for certain things (e.g. plates, water, naan). Second, the naan on top of our biryani was very undercooked. It was pretty much a piece of soft dough with burnt edges. Other people that got the biryani didn't have this problem, so maybe it was just a one-time thing.   I think that this is definitely one of the nicer options for Indian food in the GTA. Since I have basically no experience in this area, I'm just going to trust Shaheer M. when he says the food here is very authentic. What I do know is that it's definitely delicious food. Spicy, painful, delicious food. I regret nothing.  (56/100) - 2016"}
{"text":"2 stars just for their decoration. Service is very slow and confusing. Over staffed but all employees are useless and avoid eye contact with tables.   Food is nothing special. Chicken always feels uncooked and has a wierd texture.  Will never return."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a fancy South Asian restaurant with good food, you should try this place. The restaurant is nicely decorated, very clean, contemporary in feel, with dishes that bear the name of the restaurant on their gleaming white dishes.   Admittedly I was like others who have made immature comments about the restaurant's name, but what the name translates to is \"cooked with steam\". Signature Dum Pukht dishes are served covered in a flatbread-like dome, which preserves the steam in the cooking vessel.   This was my first time trying Dum Pukht, so for comparison purposes with other Indian restaurants, hubby and I ordered vegetarian samosas, butter chicken and rice. We asked the server for recommendations regarding another vegetable dish, and he said we would not regret it if we ordered the methi mutter malai (peas and ricotta cheese with fenugreek served medium spicy). Before our food arrived, we were given complimentary papadums with tamarind sauce and mint chutney. The samosas were quite large and one order comes with 3 pieces. My relatively weak tolerance for spice was pushed towards the edge with the spice level in the samosas.  The main dishes were quite tasty. The butter chicken was pretty good (but not the best I've ever had, as I like my butter chicken sauce creamier). The methi mutter malai was tasty as well, creamy, and of tolerable spice level. However, I found it lacking in texture (which I appreciate in food), thus I'd probably sooner try another vegetable dish first before trying that particular one again.  Service is very good and the staff are helpful and friendly. I look forward to coming back again to try their signature dishes. 3.25 stars.  (73/100)"}
{"text":"Great experience,nice ambiance,food was great! Came here during lunch time, food came a bit slow,but the food was definitely worth the wait! This hit the spot! I'm very satisfied and will come again!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times after we were turned away, but they have made up for it.  If youre looking for biryani this is the place to be!  The food has been consistently good, the biryani here is the best and most unique biryani in gta. Their naans (specially garlic) are amazing  and their butter chicken is quite good too.  The service, while a little on the slow side, has been very friendly and geniunely caring. We came as a big family group to break our fast and have dinner, we needed a room to pray and they literally gave us access to their whole banquet hall, also gave us some mats and stuff to use.  When we came back to eating, the owner sent us some extra garlic naan on the house, we didn't even ask him for more naans!  I hope the manager is reading this, keep doing what you're doing Coz youre doing an amazing job!"}
{"text":"Just Pukht it and come here for your meal.  Located in Markham you know you have found a good spot when you hop out of your car and can smell the delicious curry from the parking lot. My mouth was watering even before I stepped in the restaurant.  It's a pretty big restaurant and decor is tasteful (not cheesy at all like how some Indian restaurants can be).  You can also see the chefs cooking in the kitchen b/c it's a glass wall separating the kitchen and the dining room.  You can watch them make skewers and see how the tandoor works.  Also, everything is made to order - fresh.  They don't make the food before hand and just heat up - this is evident by watching the chef's make your meal before your eyes.  Of course this means that the time from when you order to when you get your food takes awhile...but I don't mind if things are made fresh.    We ordered a bunch of different items for our group - mango salad; aloo gobi; garlic naan; lamb skewers; the dum phukt chicken special and rice pulao.   Yum, yum and YUM!   The mango salad offered a sweet cool flavour to some of the hotter dishes.  The aloo gobi was a nice side and the chicken special was spicy but not burn out your mouth spicy.  Tender pieces of chicken in curry....eatne with the rice or naan, it was just delicious.  It comes looking like chicken pot pie (the best way I can explain it) - the chicken was inside a naan bowl almost.   Everything was delicious.  I didn't find anything too spicy..but I'm used to spice so I've got a slight tolerance to it.  I also tried the butter chicken from our nice Yelp friends at the table next to us - smooth, creamy and yum.  Just thinking about it makes me want to go back...."}
{"text":"Service and food was good, but portions are small. Overall it's pricey for what you get. Loved the Chicken Shai korma with nan and lamb biryani. Will definitely go again."}
{"text":"First visit was good. 2nd was a mess. Went for lunch & place was 80% empty, since they don't do buffet.  1 waiter was serving the whole restaurant, he was complaining the manager didn't show up??  Food was spicy, the previous month....was not anyone near as bad. Told the waiter, he basically shrugs and offers to do nothing. Very dissatisfied & won't be back....will stick to The Host!"}
{"text":"Had a pretty amazing time dining here. The wait staff was nothing but courteous the entire time and I received some great service. For drinks we had wine and a pitcher of draft beer. Appetizers were a vegetable and shrimp pakora. And for entrees We ordered three different biryanis, a chicken karahi and a lamb dish. Would definitely come back here as every dish was very authentic!"}
{"text":"Wow. I am the farthest from being a middle eastern Indian (contrary to other reviewers), but this place is joyous.  Best Indian we have tasted in a long while.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"My go-to spot for indian food in Markham. Lots of variety - great butter chicken, naan, saag paneer. They do all the classics well.   Often very busy - I find it best to come during odd hours."}
{"text":"Dum Pukht is a gem in the middle of Markham. I stayed nearby for a work trip and thought I would be eating room service for the whole week. Thankfully Dum Pukht was nearby and saved me. This is an Indo - Chinese restaurant which is exactly as it sounds, most dishes are North Indian or an Indian Chinese fusion. I was basic and got the chicken tikka masala with garlic naan and jeera rice. It was wonderful! The naan was plentiful and they make it from scratch on site. The chicken tikka masala was full of flavor and not too spicy (you can ask to make it spicier) and the rice was large enough to feed a small family.  Service was very attentive and the restaurant's interior is beautiful. They end  the meal with a heated towel. Only taking one star off because most of the entrees come without naan or rice so you have to order it on the side. That being said my one meal lasted for two additional meals which was great. Definitely check it out if you're in the area!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here to celebrate the birthday of a dear friend. We were hoping for good food, good service, and a clean, friendly environment. We were not disappointed. Everything was better than we had hoped for!  The decor and lighting provided a sophisticated environment. We had a booth that made it a little more intimate for our celebration.  The food was excellent! In addition to our favourite Indian dishes, we trusted our server's recommendations and enjoyed every bite!  The Tandoori Mixed Grill and Mix Chicken Sampler arrived on hot sizzling plates and provided a good variety of chicken, lamb, and paneer. The Chicken Biryani was presented in a hot pot with a layer of dough covering it. The dough was cut open at the table by our server - a very unique presentation. The Channa Masala was a bit spicy for some of us but also very delicious. All the dishes, from appetizers to desserts, were very tasty!  We met the friendly owner on our way out and he proudly showed us his new banquet hall next door, opening tomorrow for Mothers Day. The decor and lighting were very modern and sophisticated. These guys are on to something here.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Came to visit this place to check out their menu and try some of the food that were popular among Yelpers since we were around the area.  Well, I can only give 2 stars for our overall experience. The food was nothing special other than the little presentation done for the \"biryani-type\" dish we ordered which I do not even remember what it was called..  The mixed grilled meats were dry.. The pani puri came but lacking the chick peas ( only potatoes and no flavour at all ) which was evident of disregard on the part of the chef /cook in terms of customer satisfaction. However, it is up to you to try and maybe have a different experience from this place. But we are not coming back."}
{"text":"Nice interior compared to many other local Indian food restaurants in the area - lots of parking.   We made reservations; upon calling we were told we could have a table for 2 at 7pm. The guy didn't want our name, which we found odd and asked him if he wanted it for the reservation - he said no.   Of course we arrive and the place is quite full and everyone is puzzled that we have a reservation but there is no record of this. Whatev, we just want a seat as the aroma of foods was definitely making us super hungry. Luckily, there was an empty table and we were able to be seated.   There is a large menu with lots of delicious sounding dishes. We opted for chaat papri and cheese naans to start and the dum phukt chicken biryani and chicken tikka masala for mains.   The meal comes with a complimentary starter of papadums and a cilantro and tangy sauce. The papadums were a tad on the stale side. The cilantro sauce was our fav.   Cheese naan - oh SO good. We both remarked we would return if only even for this. Delicious and served hot- yum!  Chaat papri - we are big fans of this dish in general so always make a point of trying it out at any new place we go. This one we found too tangy and lacked much of the trademark chickpeas and potato and had far too much of the yoghurt.   Chicken biryani - delicious. Just the right amount of spice (I'm brown and LOVE my spicy food!), but not too overbearing. A generous portion which comes cooked in a pot covered with a naan. The naan is inedible as we are cautioned it's not cooked through but it makes for a really neat presentation. The sever cuts it open at the table. Tender pieces of chicken breast dot the dish.   Chicken tikka masala - flavour central. Fresh peppers are cooked to a mild crispness which makes the dish even tastier. Generous sized portion.   Meal comes with a small dish of raita which was nice.   Service was good.   We will definitely be back to try out more of the vast menu."}
{"text":"Was craving for some Indian food and thought we'd try somewhere new. Glad we found this place!  Staff: They seemed uninterested in being there which was the only negative we had about this place. They seemed slow with responses and when they were taking our orders they weren't even focused on us, which in my opinion is quite rude (this happened a few times).  Ambience: The place is spacious, bright and very comfortable. Loved the d√©cor and the feel of the place. It isn't elaborately decorated, but I appreciated the nice plating and clean look.  Food: I had the Veggie Samosa (apparently they were out of the Meat Samosas). They were nice and filled with potatoes and peas; I just wish I could have a meat samosa since I prefer more savoury flavours. I had the Chicken Shahi Korma with some Butter Naan. Loved it! Big portions, juicy chicken, and lots of flavour!  I'll definitely be back for the food, not sure about the service."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate a birthday with 10 people (my first visit).  When we arrived there were probably 2 other tables occupied so it wasn't busy at all. Nonetheless the waiter didn't bother to come take our order until at least 30 minutes after we were all seated and even then we had to waive him down.  Waiter didn't even pay attention to us while taking our order. He seemed frustrated when we asked questions. Numerous dishes were not available to order of the menu. When the food arrived it was basically dumped on our table any explanations as to what was what.   It took forever for our drinks to arrive. The lamb kebab was dry and void of any flavor. The accompanying sauces were pretty good. The byriani was terrible (we tried the lamb, chicken and shrimp). The chicken Tikka was average. The Naan was pretty good.   Overall the food was a huge let down. The quality of food here is lower than most Indian fast  food joints. The service was unacceptable. I would advice against even considering this place."}
{"text":"The Chicken Dum Pukht and the Dum Phukt Biryani were phenomenal! We also had the Rara Chicken (chicken breast in a keema) which was also delicious. Unfortunately the vegetarians dishes were not as good as we had hoped. The Baingan Ka Bartha was subpar while the Bindi and Malai Kofta were just ok."}
{"text":"tandoori chicken and lamb vindaloo are amazing"}
{"text":"One year later - same slow service.  I'm surprised they haven't gotten their act together yet."}
{"text":"This was my first experience ordering a buffet lunch without actually walking up to a buffet--how's that for convenience?!  We dined here recently for lunch on a weekday and it wasn't very busy, but I can imagine they must be packed at peak hours. I strongly recommend you come here with an appetite, because the food is delicious and you won't want to miss out. I have no major criticisms of this place, but the service was just a bit slow, given that we were among the few patrons in the restaurant."}
{"text":"WOW-This restaurant was an excellent culinary experience in both presentation and food quality although non-vegetarian far exceeded vegetarian options in terms of palatability and detail. The presentation was elegant and creative. The restaurant decor and ambiance was very up-to-date and reflective of a perfect social setting. Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Great service, good ambiance and good Indian food.  My friend and I ordered the dumpukht lamb and the chicken r-something (it was minced chicken + chicken gravy)   I personally loved the chicken, but the lamb was a bit too sweet for my liking.   For appetizers we ordered papri chaat but felt that something tasted off and had it returned. They were kind enough to not put it in our bill.  I've heard the dumpukht biryani is supposed to be good but I'm not sure I will travel to Markham from downtown to try it. I like my desi food to meet certain expectations and this, while it was a good experience, it was definitely anticlimatic"}
{"text":"The service was good and our waiter was very polite. The mango laksi was so good. The kabob, chicken masala and the biryani were very good. Biryani flavour goes really well with the yogurt. The kabob was very crispy on the outside and soft inside. The only thing I dislike was the half rack of lamb...  It tasted like frozen meat defrosted, cooked and frozen again and got defrosted then microwaved.... Overall the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"Probably my new favourite place to get chicken biryani!   Service is superb! Very prompt and attentive. The waitress was always on standby for us. The restaurant decor and ambiance was pretty nice.  We waited for about 15 mins to get our food. I got the chicken biryani. The fried rice was in a cool naan bowl, which itself is edible! The waitress cut the opening of the bowl right in front of you.   The biryani was really yummy! You can taste the aroma of the spices in the rice. The rice wasn't too oily, although the naan was a bit oily and burnt on the sides. I got it in mild so it wasn't too spicy. They also gave me yoghurt on the side. It tasted really good with the rice.   To summarize, I truly enjoyed the biryani and service here. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"The naan was fresh and delicious but aside from that, this place is nothing to write home about.  Service was sub par - quick enough but not personable (uur waiter barely said more than 5 words to us).  We ordered the lamb biriyani - enough for two people but I've definitely had way better biriyani.  The chicken vindaloo was horrible - did not taste like vindaloo at all. Both these dishes get one star at max.  Perhaps if you've never tried Indian food anywhere else, you would rate this place slightly higher but if you know your Indian cuisine, you'll know right off the bat, this is a poor excuse for it."}
{"text":"Nicely decorated restaurant with a kitchen that allows you to see how they make their naan.  Came on a week night and the restaurant wasn't packed at all, which is nice. The restaurant is very spacious with nice seating all around. There's plenty of decor all around, from shiny tiles to various things hung on the walls, which added a nice touch.  There's a variety of menu items available, with every section listed clearly. If you are not sure with the dishes, ask the server and they will describe it for you. We ordered a number of dishes from each section on the menu just to try different things. Now, the portions aren't huge but if you come with a group you get the chance to try a bit of everything. The dishes were decent in terms of flavour, but no specific one stuck out to me, although the presentation of the food were pretty nice.  Service was a bit strange... on several occasions, our meal wasn't half finished yet but one of the servers kept coming over asking if we're done... and we're like no? (almost like you're being rushed so not too sure what that was about). Other than that, they were pretty courteous and attentive staff.  Would return for their decor, but not so much for the food."}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for dinner. My friends were raving about this place so we decided to give it a shot.  Came here around 7 pm and got seated right away. Interior decor is amazing and the boys room is extremely clean. The kitchen is right beside the entrance to the washroom so walking there you can see the chef preparing kebabs or naan, a neat touch.   When I got back we order drinks. I ordered a pint of Stella and my wife went with Masala Chai. Our waiter brought us the drinks and we went ahead to order our meals. We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala, Dum Pukht Shrimp Biryani and Mix Chicken Sampler. The waiter then ask if we want butter naan? I said ok, we get two. The waiter was like, no no, one is enough. We found out one IS enough. To us that was an extremely helpful advice from our waiter.   Now the chicken: The Chicken Tikka Masala and Mix Chicken Sampler is absolutely delicious and the BEST East Asian chicken I ever had!!! Chicken is moist, juicy and melts in your mouth. Cutting the chicken is cutting like butter.   Dum Pukht Shrimp Biryani was also superbly done. The biryani is cooked perfectly; soaking in all the goodness and the shrimp was tender.   My wife loves the butter naan here. Naan is soft, light and goes well with any dish.   My wife and I really enjoy our dinner here. Great experience and so glad we came. $70 dollars after tax, for that food and drink?! Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Good ambiance, good food. I found service a bit slow because they were packed i guess. I would suggest them allocating few severs per table, rather than running everywhere and confusing things.. But have to say the food was really good especially the Tandoori items and the curry stuff. Overall family really liked it.. Improvement of service will help.. But have to say our server was really good and was trying hard..."}
{"text":"My party arrived at this restaurant and it was surprisingly dead with maybe two or three other tables being served. The place had a chic modern lounge feel to it with the kitchen having glass windows so diners could observe the chef at work. Our table ordered butter chicken, fish curry, rara mutton, dum pukht chicken, dum pukht mutton, and some deep fried paneer ball appetizers, with several sides of butter naan. The rara mutton was very fragrant and delicious, with the mutton being very tender. The dum pukht dishes were also quite good, while being distinctly different from each other. I found it interesting that they would cook it like a souffle or pot pie but, as according to our server, the crust was not meant to be eaten but rather a means to lock in fragrance, flavour, and moisture. I sampled my friend's butter chicken some time after having finished with the dum pukht and found it relatively bland (like going from eating something so complexly flagrant to something as simple as chicken in cream of tomato soup)--they insist it was delicious so maybe I'll try it before eating something heavily spiced. Overall I found the food was a bit overseasoned as I found myself reaching for my glass of water more so than usual. Still, I would be interested in exploring the rest of the menu here. Recommended."}
{"text":"Avg food taste nothing special service was ok... It was sat night and looks like only two people were working at front... Ambiance was good .. it's average restaurant"}
{"text":"We ordered my favorite saag paneer, butter chicken, chicken biriyani, and some naan (regular and garlic).  The saag paneer was super bland.  Definitely would not reorder again.  Butter chicken was really good I thought.  It had some spices in it that I'm not used to tasting in butter chicken.  I have some friends that have tried the butter chicken from here before, but they're not a fan.  To each their own I guess.  The chicken biriyani was good, had nice spices, but it was literally just rice.  I think there were 5 really small cubes of chicken, that was it.  The naan was nothing special.  I think though if I had it fresh, and not steaming in tin foil for the drive home, it would have been better.  I wonder if they have buffet lunch, I would definitely be interested in giving their other dishes a try."}
{"text":"My family is as Indian as it gets and our standards at home are ridiculous but this place is the real deal.  Great place. Great food. Great service. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great food, bad service. Visited on Saturday evening. The service was slow and very hard to get someone's attention .  We had dum biriyani , which was cooked very well with tender pieces of chicken . The mutton curry was cooked to perfection. Spacing through out the restaurant was very tight and they were under staffed.   Second review. July/ 2017 Visited again , this time at a much slower time. It was not at all busy as we were the only other table. Can only write the same thing. Good food but very bad service. The waitress had very bad attitude and didn't even bother to check on us once she brought the food to the table. It seemed she was forced to work and stay as far away possible from the tables so that she wasn't bothered with anything. We had to literally go on a hunt for her to get some water. The staff definitely requires a lot of training."}
{"text":"Went for lunch last week, very authentic, very tasty. Tried the buffet lunch, little different as its table service buffet.. Service was prompt and friendly, will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"We went there on Valentine's dinner. The food was amazing. The price is good. Only improvement is the service. Server are friendly, but not professionally trained, and not organized enough. I will go back for the food!!"}
{"text":"First experience , a very good one , very well decorated , warm feeling . Food was very well served and tasty . It lost a star because it was little noisy as there was no background music and our table position was not the greatest we it felt a little chilly in there .a definite place to go back again and try other dishes ."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh, this place is delicious. I've been here so many times now I've lost count. Surprisingly every time I come it's not very busy, and these were all during peak hours. The decor is nice, actually legit, and the service is amazing. The waiters and waitresses are definitely very knowledgable about their food products and they're great in recommending food if you're unsure what to get.   Every time I come here I'm tempted to order everything, and my friends are always likely to do the same. Our only saviour is our waiter who has to hold us back and tell us if we ordered too much food.   Onto their food, I love all their food. You can't go wrong with it; you could blindly pick and whatever shows up will be amazing. Their biryani is so delicious, I've spent many nights drooling after it since trying it. So far I've had their chicken biryani baked under a sheet of what tastes like roti to me (I know next to nothing about Indian culture so I'm probably butchering all the terms) and it's just heavenly. I'd recommend ordering a side of butter chicken to go with it or any sauce dishes because sauce is separate and vice versa should you decide to order a sauce dish. Their meat is so tender, it's bliss!  Can I also just give an applause to their naan because it's so fluffy and chewy and flavourful, I wish I could eat it every night if it weren't for those blasted carb intakes.   The price of this place is very fair. Normally for two people the price comes up to around $23 after tax and tips. I normally order the butter chicken, two/three orders of the naan, and the dum pukht chicken biryani to share with my extra. Definitely recommend!"}
