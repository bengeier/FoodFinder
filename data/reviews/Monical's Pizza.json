{"text":"First time we stopped Monicals sat for eight minutes nobody came to the table no service so we left thank God for Pizza Hut  seated served and talk to within 30 seconds"}
{"text":"How to start? Got to Monical's at 7 on a Saturday night. Waited 5 minutes at the hostess station to be seated and the restaurant was fairly empty.  The hostess gave us a fine table and was super friendly.  And it stopped there. Really! We waited another 10-15 minutes for ANYONE to take our order, offer us water, acknowledge our presence, something! Nope. Several servers were cleaning other tables, sweeping the floor and reorganizing chairs throughout the restaurant. Not one noticed a table of 6 people. Other customers received their food, so somehow a server noticed them at some point.  Finally, we just got up and left. And NOT ONE SERVER NOTICED!  So I can't rate their food because how would I know?    We did have a wonderful dinner....somewhere else."}
{"text":"There are a lot of die-hard Monical's fans in town who swear it's the best pizza ever.  It's almost a religion.  I have to disagree.  While I do appreciate the variety of toppings, which are great, I don't like the crust.  I am usually a thin crust person, but I like a crispy crust, whereas this crust is very chewy and often tough.    I have actually added a star to this place for the red dressing alone.  This stuff is really great on the salads, although it does turn your mouth/lips red so there has to be some serious dye added.  I have seen folks use it as a dipping sauce for their pizza.  To me, though, a good pizza does not need a dipping sauce."}
{"text":"Went in around 1pm today 8/2/2016. Went in the front door and there were no employees to greet me. Two ladies were in front of us, who were also customers. I heard a girl yell to us, \"COME ON BACK\" and pointed to the dining area. When my mother and sister  joined me from the restroom, we went to the dining area, located a clean table and sat down. Approximately 5 minutes went by when the waitress who yelled \"COME ON BACK\" approached us with menu's stating that we \"were not 'seated' \". She latered appeared and served a table their food at which time she stated to another employee that we \"we're not 'seated' \". We sat another 5 minutes before leaving  the restaurant after  15 minutes and still no service. We spent 50 dollars at Garcia's right down the road and it was delicious."}
{"text":"The staff here was quite friendly, but the fact that people love Monical's pizza leads me to believe they have never had pizza before.  Its awful cardboard with some sauce and cheese on top."}
{"text":"My husband & I ate here for dinner on Memorial Day while headed back home from Kentucky! It was my first time ever at a Monical's Pizza! The pizza was alright but since my family is Italian I have to say, Monical's Pizza is certainly NOT up to any sort of Italian food let alone an american version of pizza! The sauce was pretty sweet and it just wasn't the best! Also, there were huge groups of people in the 1 large seating area and the opposite seating area was completely empty and they still sat small parties in the room with groups of 15+ people! The noise level was OFF the charts! The noise level was enough to want to get up and walk out!    Even though I didn't really enjoy it - it was fresh and very hot so I know it had not been sitting around for a while waiting to be served!  That is a good thing so that's a +1 in that regard for Monical's!  I think that I may be a little harsher b/c I live about 50 minutes from the city (Chicago) where you can find the best pizza ever! So some may not find this review helpful - but those who are used to AMAZING Chicago Pizza will probably not be recommending this pizza chain with anyone that is also from around Chicago!"}
{"text":"Monical's does their whole menu superbly. The salad is fresh and delicious and that coming from a guy who normally doesn't eat\" weeds\". The pizza is the best there is. Their red (french) dressing is worth buying by the bottle for use on pizza or the salads. This Rantoul location Excellent place to eat. Out of town guests of mine always want to eat here before they return to their respective states."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times and each time I tell myself I won't be going back. The first two times I ate here the pizza just didn't taste good...What gets me is that the prices of the pizza are nearly identical to other pizza joints for what seems like less food.  However, the food isn't really as much of a problem as my last visit (1/11/17) experience. We had a party of 4 and we were the only ones ordering inside at the time. My co-workers and I waited 45 minutes for our dine-in order. My other two co-workers had their pizza burned (really guys?) and they had to wait an additional 15-20 minutes while we ate. My calzone was burning hot on the crusts and cold in the middle. Of course their meal was comped, which is good. But considering how crappy the dining experience was for all of us, I am pretty confident that Monical's lost 4 customers in 1 day.   If three 8 inch pizzas and a calzone take 1 hour and is not even worth the wait- I would rather go to Subway next door."}
{"text":"Overpriced... Artificially red salad dressing on a boring salad is just terrible... Honestly, go anywhere else for pizza!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at various Monicals pizza for most of my life and they alway promise and deliver two things: their product is mediocre and it is over priced. There was once a time that the Central Illinois area offered few options when it came to thin crust pizza but now its loaded with restaurants that not only make far superior pizza but do it at a reasonable price unlike Monicals. If you are looking for a thin crust pizza please do yourself a favor and save a ton of money by trying Esquire, Jupiters, Papa Dels thin, Garcias thin or Manzellas. If you want a thick crust pizza Papa Dels still makes a fantastic deep dish pie and surprisingly so does Garcias."}
{"text":"We stopped here after driving 2 1/2 hours, just wanting a quick and easy meal so we could get right back on the road. We ordered 5 sandwiches, 4 individual salads, and 5 soft drinks, and one of the sandwiches was a BLT. Easy, right?? WRONG. After waiting for a server to take our order for nearly 15 minutes, 45 minutes later and two inquiries to our server (Nick) as to where our food was, (after which he decided to ignore our table completely and avoided eye contact), we made a complaint to the manager. We told him we would be leaving in 5 minutes if our sandwiches were not on the table in that time, and he actually had the nerve to tell us he couldn't promise that, but he'd check on the ticket time and find out what the delay was. Really??!! Needless to say, 5 minutes passed and no server or manager appeared with our food, so we left money for our drinks and salads, walked out of the dump, and hit the McDonalds down the street on the way out of town. Need a little refresher course on customer service, people. I'd give 0 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Better than anything Chicago, LA or NYC has to offer. Back to Champaign for a visit and the pizza is as good as it was when I was raising my kids on the family pleaser. Love it!"}
{"text":"We live in Mahomet and have ordered out and dined in at this Monical's many times. I called tonight and asked for a calzone with 4 toppings. Was informed by the person on the phone that they could only add 3 toppings. I told them that I was happy to pay extra and that I still wanted the 4th topping (hot peppers). They told me no. The manager, Todd, backed up the employee by also refusing a 4th topping, regardless of me offering to pay extra for it. In addition to refusing to add the 4th topping, Todd was rude. As a small business owner, I'm always stunned by this type of behavior. I will no longer be a customer and will tell everyone I'm in contact with should the topic of pizza come up."}
{"text":"Better than most chain pizza, it's ok.    We got a thin crust, which was nice and crispy, only a little greasy, ok ingredients, not amazing on the cheese, and had kind of a bland crust.  I guess that doesn't sound too good, but I really promise it's better than any national chain pizza you'll find in town.  It also has a really friendly, laid-back atmosphere."}
{"text":"We stopped at Monicals for a late lunch during a business trip hoping for a local style pizza. That we did find, but it did not meet our expectations. I was not a fan of the paper thin pizza crust, my coworkers felt the same.   Being unfamiliar with the menu, ordering from the desk was confusing since we stopped in during \"off peak\" hours. I am unsure if other pizza crusts are available."}
{"text":"We stopped at Monicals half way through our 6 hour road trip expecting to find a decent lunch based on reviews. To say that the pizza is the \"best in town\" is not completely inaccurate considering it's either this or frozen pizza from the gas station. We narrowly avoided the family \"pleasers\" and instead opted for the sandwiches. I will say they perfected the art of taking the lunch meat out of the package and landing most of it on the bread. That's where the praises end. Everything was so dry and lifeless that we spent the next 30 minutes naming every place we could have eaten which would have been more appetizing. I give it a C- only because they include a bag of chips(regular or cheesy) to really provide the Emerals \"bam\" that the meal was calling for. Next time we will certainly press on to Rantoul to hot box with the kids at Hardee's."}
{"text":"Ok, I guess the key here is to avoid the thin crust pizza. My second Monical's experience was a complete turnaround when I tried their thicker-crust pizza. Yum! So glad someone talked me into giving them a second chance."}
{"text":"I did not like the pizza. The mozzarella sticks were okay. But they pizza was not that good, but my boyfriend seemed to love it. The waitress seemed to be a little rude. Also we were not offered and utensils and the napkins they had could be found at a cafeteria."}
{"text":"I cannot believe Monicals gets such low ratings. They have the best thin crust I've ever tasted. And yes, do put the French dressing on the za!"}
{"text":"Pizza is delicious.  Service is pretty good for the most part. Two drawbacks here, one-they don't deliver until after 4 even though they are open for lunch. Two-When you enter the restaurant, the doorway hits you with a very odd, very strong odor.  Smells like a nail salon.  It is a very strong odor that can give you a headache or make your stomach turn a bit.  :-("}
{"text":"be ready to wait....service sux!!! The pepperoni pizza is the best. The other pizzas I have had all needed seasoning n were kinda mushy, but tasted ok the next day as leftovers !"}
{"text":"I nearly always grab carry-out. The individual pizza is reasonable enough and perfect size for a meal combined with a pair of breadsticks (definitely recommend with the nacho cheese option).  They really need to work out the parking situation. Small lot and only one exit (no driving around the building) -- getting out is usually far more difficult than getting in."}
{"text":"This is pretty decent pizza and their service is friendly and quick, even when you are a big party. I don't have anything bad to say about Monical's."}
{"text":"We ordered a stuffed pizza and a calzone for delivery. They turned up 40 minutes BEFORE the online delivery system said it would, which was strange. The bags seemed to have trapped the steam and caused the crusts to get soggy and hard. They probably sat around for awhile too because they were more wet than hot. The spinach and mushrooms in the calzone were obviously frozen or canned. The sauce and cheese were pretty good, but overall I was very disappointed with our experience."}
{"text":"I'm going to blame the lack of good reviews for Monicals on the fact that most people reviewing restaurants in Champaign-Urbana are college students.  Because every local I know LOVES Monicals. It is, in fact, one of my must visit places every time I visit the twin cities.  It's different from most of my favorite pizzas in that it's thin... ultra thin.  Crunchy crust, cut in squares, lots of cheese... it's a very tasty pizza.  However, the uninitiated may order this without knowing the best part of Monical's... the french dressing.  This seems odd (at least to all of my out of town friends in the past) but the way to eat Monicals is to get a bottle of the french dressing and dip the pizza in it.  I put the dressing directly on the top of the pizza myself... it's one of the oddest but best combos you will ever taste.  In fact, they even sell their french dressing online!  (And its worth it, because you will never find a dressing that good in stores.  Seriously, I've looked.)  Grab the family pleaser (with salad and cola) and lube up your salad and pizza with copious amounts of french dressing... and thank me later."}
{"text":"Just, ew. Dirty, not well taken care of. Apples on pizza, apparently were from some other planet because these were, lord I dont even have an accurate description of them. Even my husband who eats EVERYTHING, pushed his plate away after two bites. The dogs liked it though. Ew. Never again."}
{"text":"Monicals pizza is by far one of my favorite pizzas. The traditional thin crust topped with sausage and pinnaple it where its at. Plus, you cannot go there and not get there awesome family salad and dip everything in there sweet and tangy french dressing. Although i love monicals pizza i do not eat it as often because i think its a bit expensive for such thin pizza. However, I always keep a bottle of there famous french dressing in my fridge which goes perfict with many things!   I also like this location. It has two levels which gives is a more homey feeeling."}
{"text":"Tried Rantoul Monical's again!  This place has went down hill so bad! Never consistent! The crust is always burnt, you have to order extra sauce or u can't even see they put any on.  We eat at St. Joseph, Gibson City, and Mahomet's monicals they are all much better!  Rantoul better change because word of mouth is happening.  The Mang. Team is not like they have had either, needs a whole new lift!"}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. Waited an hour and a half, called,  and were told our pizza was done but it wouldn't be delivered for another hour. We changed to carry out and went to pick it up. When we pulled in,  the Monical's delivery car was down the street delivering another pizza.  Why he could not take both at the same time,  I don't know. We finally got to eat and the pizza was already cold enough to need reheated and the breadsticks so stale it took the strength of ten men to pull them apart. My dog even found them inedible."}
{"text":"This is the best mini pizza I've ever had!  - Charlie (8).  This is the best pizza I've ever had! - Tess (4).  And Daddy says Thin crust, yummy, great service, great price, and a neat, happy atmosphere."}
{"text":"I would give no stars if I could yesterday we stopped by and we're not only ignored we were not seated properly, there was no hostess so we went and sat down, after about 10 minutes a waitress threw down some menus and said we were not set down by a waiter/waitress. Why was that a big deal I ask? After 20 minutes we decided to leave, I know that most Monical are not like this. I recommend you drive down the street to Garcias the pizza was awesome and service was great, just allow extra cooking time for a deep dish pizza,  but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"This is the *original* Monical's -- and one of Tolono's few claims to fame in my opinion :)  This location definitely isn't as new and modern as the one in Urbana or on Mattis, but it has character!  And the pizza tastes just the same as the other locations, probably even better!  After moving to Chicago recently, I find myself often wanting Monical's thin crust with the red dressing...since I'm surrounded by deep-dish fanatics.  Breadsticks with nacho cheese are a must, as well. Mmm, might have to go home to eat, err I mean visit, soon."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the world. Would travel hours just to eat here! Make sure you order your pizza well done for best results, and the French dressing to dip your pizza in is next level!"}
{"text":"Having worked at a Monical's pizza about 100 years ago, I know how they are supposed to make pizza. We ordered an Italian Special and it didn't have all the topping. Come on! No apples and no pepperoni!  I still ate it, but not what I ordered. Additionally this was the second time we had it delivered. First time took almost an hour, this time an hour and 10 minutes. Sorry guys, as an old time employee I'm going to order Filippos next time. You really screwed it up."}
{"text":"The worst Monicals in the central il region. They hire these high school kids to work there, which is good, but they train horribly. No pizza is the same.   If you want a quality Monicals pizza, which is the best in the world, go to the original in Tolono or the Champaign store. Great there!  The Tuscola store will never be a good representative."}
{"text":"Great, Great, Great!   They never disappoint.  You tell them exactly how you want your pizza and they will deliver exactly that.  I would call this the best Monicals in the Central Illinois area.  Even over the original in Tolono...........Sorry!"}
{"text":"When I was in high school I loved Monical's Pizza.  Has something changed because I don't think it's as good as it used to be?  I bought one last night for carry out and I seriously think something has happened.  I believe they are a victim to the franchise.  They are clearly using cheaper ingredients.  The cheese is slimy!  Yuck!  And what is up with the sausage?  It doesn't taste right at all.  In fact, none of it tasted right.  It just wasn't good.  Sad.  Two stars because of memories and the french dressing is still edible."}
{"text":"Stopped at Monical's after an Illini game to fuel up on food before driving home.  Were seated right away, which was good for our party of 7.  Decided to get the family meal deal of salad, pitcher of soda, and a pizza.  Added a deep dish along with the pizza dough bombs and we had a pretty full table of food.  It was good and there wasn't anything for leftovers.  The crust on each one was just the right crunch and the salad was crisp and refreshing.  For the interaction we did have with the staff, they were pretty nice but didn't come around much."}
{"text":"Veggie pizzas a good Lo calorie choice here"}
{"text":"I eat here occasionally because it is by my work.  I think the pizza here is better than at the other one (if you have read my review of the other Monicals you would understand).  I typically get carry out and lately they have had coupons for a $4 or $5  individual pizza which is the perfect size for lunch.   Yesterday, I ate in with a friend and I must say this place is loud.  Over the top loud.  I had a very hard time hearing anything my friend said.  We finished our food and got out of there so we could visit.    Our waitress seem pissed off about something so we were very careful not to ask her for anything.  She never smiled in fact, I am not even sure she said 2 words to us.  It took 10 minutes for her to come and take our drink order.  She also slammed down our salads, the dressing and our drinks and flew off in huff.  I swear we did not do anything to make her mad.  However, I do believe if I had to work in such a loud place I would be pissed off too.  We heard a bunch of plates fall back in the kitchen and we knew what had happened.  And that really made her madder.  Oh dear!  So, we ate our food, paid our bill (yes, we left her a tip) and ran out the door.  We agreed that we would not eat in again but we will get the take out.  The salad was cold and fresh and the dressing was really good.  The pizza was cooked just right and I asked for light green pepper and I got 7 pieces.  Bottom line is the food is good but I would advise carry out or delivery if at all possible."}
{"text":"Really cute ambiance with the octagonal shaped building and I am a huge fan of their gluten-free pizza, even though I can eat gluten. Price was completely reasonable ($10 for a 10\" gluten-free pizza with sausage, pepperoni, green peppers and onions). Recommended. Also watch out for their coupons in the mail."}
{"text":"2/20/2015 I called and placed an order for a family pleaser. Half sausage, half pepperoni with extra cheese. I also ordered a 10 pack of breadsticks with four cheese sauces. The gentleman read my order back and had somehow gotten mushrooms on there (crazy busy Friday night with people shouting things in the background, confusion was understandable). I corrected him and asked him to make it well done also. I was given the total and a wait time of 45 to 50 minutes for delivery. Again, understandable since it was Friday night and they were super busy.  An hour and thirty minutes later I get a call asking if I have my pizza yet and I say no. She apologizes and says it will be out very soon and that she was taking the cost of my breadsticks off the order.  Fifteen minutes later, my pizza is at the door. I paid, got it on the table, and opened it up to discover that it had been covered in mushrooms. I immediately  called back and made them aware of the mistake and they said they would fix it and get the pizza I ordered out to me as quickly as possible.  Within five minutes I recieved a call from the manager stating that he didn't  want to be rude, but that he heard the gentleman confirm my order. I said yes I did confirm my order but, I also confirmed that my pizza was made witout mushrooms. That it was not my mistake that his employee messed up my order. He apologized  and the pizza I initially ordered was at my door within 10 minutes. After being treated poorly as a regular customer, I will no longer be patronizing their establishment."}
{"text":"My first experience with Monicals made me a huge fan. Their breadsticks with cheese sauce are the best! They are famous for their salad dressing too. Pizza is good too, but I fervently love their breadsticks and always fill up on those first haha!! They are clean and nice on the inside too."}
{"text":"The original Monical's is always a treat. Always have the best pizza and friendly staff. If you like Monical's you must come here."}
{"text":"Had the thin crust with sausage and mushroom. Pizza was average at best. Crust was similar to cardboard in both flavor and texture. I prefer to support local restaurants whenever possible but honestly, the chain places are just as good or better."}
{"text":"Individual and family pleasers are a good value, which include salad, pizza and drink. Caffeine free diet coke is a big plus. Oh and be sure to try the sweet and tart French dressing. It's good on salad, pizza, bread sticks, sandwiches... Another locally owned business that has great employees. Small town friendliness, and cleanliness."}
{"text":"The pizza is usually pretty good.  My wife loves this place, it's arguably her favorite pizza. The atmosphere is always nice, very relaxed and family oriented.  To me the pizza is alright, gets the job done of I need some pizza.  The bread sticks and cheddar sauce are awesome."}
{"text":"I used to love Monical's pizza but the last couple of times I've ordered I've noticed they have really changed. The crust seems different (cardboard like) and there were hardly any toppings, even cheese. We could see the crust (not sauce) through the sprinkles of cheese and the toppings were so far apart, there were several pieces that were without. Also on our salad they really skimped on the tomato & cheese toppings- basically gave us a box of lettuce. To top it all off, our soda was warm. Really disappointing- especially at $30 (1 pizza, 1 \"salad\", 2 liter soda).  The positive thing I will say about Monical's is their staff- very friendly and fast delivery."}
{"text":"I f'in love monicals.  Perhaps because I was indoctrinated into loving this pizza as a small child.  However, when I come home to visit I often find myself wanting to come here and stuff my face.  Cheese pizza, topped with their red dressing...so wrong, but oh so right."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Probably the best place to eat in Rantoul. The staff and managers are always really nice. I would give 5 stars but they would need to start delivering to Gifford. I love on 136 and watch Other pizza delivery vehicles go by several times a night."}
{"text":"Slow service, they burn the pizza and it is always a complete zoo.  Skip this one and drive to Champaign."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to get pizza when I'm up here in this horrible place called Illinois.  Decent prices and great food with a decent atmosphere.  Try their Family Special for a deal hard to beat. Plus they have a gorgeous redhead waitress. ~swoons~"}
{"text":"One of the places I just have to get something from whenever I'm in Champaign . Absolutely love their thin crust pizzas. Haven't found one as crispy anywhere else."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my pizza at Monical's. To me, having eaten here during my graduate school days. A schoolmate advised me to ask for their French dressing on my pizza. It was absurd, of course, but tasted fantastic. Now I won't get it any other way. Thanks for the memories, Monical's."}
{"text":"I love this place. Good food and the staff are friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Pizza crust was plain and tasteless. Sausage tasted really gross. Had to take it off to make pizza edible. Breadsticks were dry. Will not be back."}
{"text":"So I was reading the reviews. Thinking to myself, I've had one pizza that wasn't hot but they took care of it right then and the employees are always friendly. Then I called tonight! The guy that answered the phone just said \"yeah\". Told him I had a coupon for a free family pleaser from Carle. We don't do that was his answer. Okay, well I missed the daily special could you tell me about it again? No answer.... hello? \"Yeah\" do you have any daily specials? No we don't do that today! Yeah well thanks for not doing your job. How hard is it to say family pleaser is $xx.xx? Before tonight I was going to give them a 4star but with people like that why would I even want to defend a place like this.  Fan turned Foe."}
{"text":"Not the best pizza I've eaten.  It's ok. Ordered a thin crust pizza with steak and mushrooms.  The meat was overdone and the pizza overall was somewhat dry, lacked seasoning and it was greasy.  I also ordered spaghetti and meatballs.  Didn't taste fresh.  I will stick with Little Caesars."}
{"text":"Quality pizza just as expected. Miss having Monicals since I've moved to Chicago and appreciate that this location didn't disappoint when we stopped in on our way back to the city. Had a regular sausage pepperoni. It was terrific !  Other reviewer who stopped for a sandwich sounded disappointed...maybe they didn't order the right thing ...it is a pizza restaurant."}
{"text":"The pizza at the original Monical's were excellent and the staff was great to us good service. We will be back to the original Monical's again."}
{"text":"The best thin crust pizza ever! Whenever we visit Champaign, we have to go to Monical's a couple of times so I can get my fix. =)"}
{"text":"I think this is the kind of place that locals love a lot more than transplants, but it's pretty decent.  If you are calling in an order, your service can be kind of hit or miss.  For instance, sometimes I've gotten breadsticks as part of my meal, sometimes not.  However, they do have a drive-thru pick-up window, which, when I'm feeling lazy is awesome.  Pizza is okay, pasta is better, french dressing is amazing.  It would be weird to just order a salad from a pizza place, right?"}
{"text":"The crust is like cardboard. Salad is iceberg. Everyone raves about the French dressing, but it is really bad.  Just red colored sugar and oil.  Go to Filippos if you want real local pizza."}
{"text":"okay, so I like a quality pizza but I will also not turn my nose up at the workaday stuff--Domino, Little Caesar, Casey's etc. etc. I enjoy Celeste Pizza for One. This is because I have always believed that it's not possible to actually mess pizza up, unless you burn it or something.   After visiting Monical's I realized I was wrong. It's entirely possible to mess pizza up, you just have to do something funny to the sauce and make the dough a weird consistency. Needless to say, I think I'll stick with Celeste's."}
{"text":"This review was for the Monicals Pizza on north Mattis Avenue on June 25, 2012.  I had a $10 coupon to try a new style of pizza that Monicals was starting to offer. A stuffed pizza. Mine was to have sausage and pepperoni .  Wellll... they evidently didn't know everything they needed to know to make this a success.  Complete disaster. First pizza was BURNT.... badly. I'll upload s picture of it after I'm done with this review.   After I called back and reported the burnt pizza, I arrived back to the store at the time they said it'd be ready...maybe even a couple minutes after. When I entered ... they said it needed a couple more minutes. He took the pizza out. Checked inside temperature with thermometer.  Then put it back in for another few minutes. Pulled it back out. Checked its temperature again. And ... this time .. it was evidently good enough to send home with me.   By now it's way more than an hour after first calling to place the original order and I'm getting pretty hungry.  I arrived home. Open up my well anticipated prized pizza ... and ... the pizza was raw on the inside! Which is what the whole process of checking the temperature on the inside was all about.  Prior to receiving the pizza, I was lectured about how important it was for the inside temperature was to reach a certain point or it could be bad news.  Normally, when you bite into a freshly cooked pizza, the pizza is HOT to the mouth and tongue. There were still COOL parts (less than 98.6 degrees) and even some of the cheese was still the rectangular shredded shape. A fair amount of the cheese in the center hadn't melted together to make one gooey wonderful blend of melted cheese. I've got a picture of that too! I'll post it as well.  This is my favorite and closest Monicals. I've been eating Monicals pizza for more than 4 decades (back to the 60's). I've written about this on Facebook. I've filled out a web survey complaint form. Annnnd ... nothing. Not even a call or email saying they are sorry for such a crappy pizza. Because of that, I will not eat at this Monicals location."}
{"text":"Yep, Chicago pizza is always a hit if you can get it right, and these guys do a pretty decent job. The lasagna was quite good, we'll thought out and would order it agsin. There were a few things missing from the mine for me, but overall not the best Chicago style I've ever hsd, but they do a good job with their food and there's no complaints here, go for it."}
{"text":"Horrible food and overpriced.  Go to the grocery store and get some frozen pizza, it's probably better quality and about 5 times cheaper."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times the food was what you would expect from Monical's.  Both times we also had poor service.  This is my least favorite location in Champaign.  I prefer to drive to the location in Tolono."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Our waitress was extremely friendly and helpful, we ate around the middle of the day and still felt like the environment was really welcoming! Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"It was early-late night when I placed my order for a large pizza for pickup.  I walked in and as I was waiting, noticed a small pizza (that was overly cooked, ok, it was burnt for lack of a better description) that was being brought out to the dining area.  I guess that was my warning sign for things to come.   But I was from out of town and have a hungry pregnant wife in the car.  The odds are against me so the pizza is coming with me one way or another.  When we got to the hotel, I unwrapped the pizza to notice it was burned on the edges and the cheese was over-cooked all over.  I have to clarify, this is not my first time ordering a Monical's pizza.  This is also not my first time ordering a pizza from Monical's (well it was my first and last order from this particular location.)  Why you ask?  It was overly burned.  The crust was black and the cheese was over-cooked.  It was a long day so who am I to get on the horn and complain? It was not worth the hassle.  To see a small pizza get pulled from the over and it looked the exact same way just confirms this is how they make their pizzas. It's akin to consuming burnt cardboard.  That is not my idea of a good pizza.  This is not the typical Monical's experience.  Will I still eat from Monical's ?  Oh yes, but will I go to this particular location?  Probably not."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery which didn't take long at all. Food tasted good, got pizza, side of French and large order bread sticks. French was spilled inside the bag, lid was not properly sealed and it covered the bread and left the container empty. Called about it and they are sending the driver back with a fresh order, 45 min later still nothing. The location is literally 4 miles from the house. Should not take this long to replace an item. Going to just go to the store for refund of the sauce and bread."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place when I come to visit my family up this way. Worked at one when I was 16 lol. Husband loves the thin crust pizza. Breadsticks are great too"}
{"text":"Decent pizza if you like thin crust. Sometimes great sometimes iffy customer service."}
{"text":"Not good / yucko.  Save your hard earned money for a better restaurant.  Quick notes: Awkward business; order before sit down. Kids both banged heads on booth seat, and so did I --bad ergonomic seat design.  Poor service.  Tomato sauce like canned paste. Sausage sour.  Cheese low quality.  Pizza cold.  Crust bland, flat, cardboard.  Hot tea, no ice, bad flavor.  No utensils.  Small plates bowls.  Ice burg salad buried in wet shredded cheddar: drown in ranch dressing to choke it down. Bland is the word.  December, Cold temp inside building. One person working entire floor , can't focus on customers. Kid placemats but no crayons.  Won't come back.not sure how this place stays in business.  Locals must not know any better pizza exists."}
{"text":"Overpriced.  The taste was barely average, but a large plain cost over $14, so Monical's fails the cost-benefit analysis.  Complaints about the service are well-founded, as we had a pick-up order and it took 3-4 minutes of standing at the counter for anybody to even wait on us.  I ordered the thin crust pizza, and won't return to Monical's, so I address only the thin crust.  The pizza was pretty bland, despite a hefty helping of oregano.  There is very little sauce, fairly dry cheese, and a chewy crust.  Heed other reviewers' advice and get the dipping sauce, because you will need it."}
{"text":"Decided to finally use a pizza coupon I got over a year ago and am wishing I would've used it earlier. The pizza is great but the service is even better. They have lots of options and toppings but the two young ladies at the front, Andrea and Angelica, were extremely friendly and also very helpful. S/o to those two, I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"The service is awful and you will often receive things you didn't order.  The food is ok, but get it carry-out after a quick inspection to make sure they included everything you paid for."}
{"text":"If I didn't love the Pizza we would have stopped coming here a long time ago!   Last night we waited about 3-5 mins to be seated when there was a group of employees doing nothing but standing around staring at us. I don't mind waiting if they are busy but there was no reason for it last night.   Once we we were seated I waited another 10 mins to get greeted at my table. I was able to finish the entire sudoku on the placemat before I even put my good order in.   Our server was nice and took care of us but very overwhelmed with the number of tables she had.... Plus, she was the one answering the phone as well. Topped again with more employees standing around.   One employee went to leave for the night and screamed good bye to her other besties in the lobby. I was sitting in the back and know exactly what she said.   Management needs to get their act together. Lots and lots of rude and unprofessional employees."}
{"text":"OK pizza. Crust pizza and point pizza are good choices if you want to give it a try."}
{"text":"This is usually our go to pizza super thin super good! I grew up on Monical's and love it the pizza that is. As far as the sides and everything else they are not as good as most around town."}
{"text":"It was my first trip back after a long time. The test has not changed at all. super delicious pizza and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"It's overpriced as hell, but damnit, they make one hell of a thin crust pizza.  Not too many toppings or cheese and the crust isn't terribly greasy.  Plus, I can't think of anything more Central Illinois than a trip to Monical's."}
{"text":"Very unhappy with the service. Order 2 pizza based on a coupon mailer. No expiration date in the mailer.  After coming into town to pick up the pizza they  refused to honor the coupon.  Refused, even after initially accepting it on the phone. Stuck paying over $30 for two medium pizzas. Should've gone to Filipos."}
{"text":"I would suggest picking up your order instead of delivery.  I would also suggest using your smart phone GPS app to locate the closest location.  I made the mistake of using my laptop to try to locate the closest location to my hotel.  When I entered the zip code, this location was listed as the only one in Urbana.  There was an additional location listed for Champaign which turns out to be closer.  According to my GPS app, there are 5 in the Champaign/Urbana area and I managed to order from the one farthest from my hotel by using their website.  I was quoted a delivery time of 75 minutes which turned into just under 2 hours.  The pizza was barely warmer than room temperature.  It did taste pretty good once I warmed it up in the hotel room microwave."}
{"text":"I've ate here many times after #Illini football games. Service is GREAT & fast. Reasonably priced. Accept credit. I suggest the family meal. 2 pizzas, 1 family salad & 1 pitcher of soda. Three thumbs up!"}
{"text":"When I had to come up to Chanute AFB alot for work, I'd eat here and Papa Del's alot.  The two types of pizza are worlds apart - Papa Del's had great super-thick crust; Monical's had great paper-thin crust.  Both yummy!  Monicals is nice and cheap for lunch."}
{"text":"Pizza perfection!  Although the toppings were not evenly distributed, as you can see, the pie was yummy!  The salad was just right--crispy lettuce bed, flavorful tomatoes, and cheddar cheese on top. Service was on spot!"}
{"text":"Monical's is a popular restaurant in Monticello - a chain that is the same anywhere you go.    Mostly thin crust pizza and salads.  Some other Italian dishes.     Right next to Pizza Hut.   Around town, more go to Monicals, although it is a bit more expensive and not too many coupons, deals.   Usually clean and good parking.  Service can be a bit \"iffy\" -- wait staff does not stick around dining area too much - but back in kitchen too much.   Also seating is a bit tight - can be noisy if crowded, especially with kids.    Some think it is the best pizza in the state."}
{"text":"They messed up my online order in the begining but immediately sent me a new one correctly. Very nice people and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Wait staff 5 stars, salad 5 stars, Pizza 2 stars, use fresh mushrooms which dry out. They need to learn fro Monical's in Canton, Illinois Thay make it perfect!"}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good, but not the best in Champaign-Urbana. I prefer Papa Del's. I know it's a different style of Pizza, but for the money, Papa Del's is still better."}
{"text":"This is the worst Monicals I have ever ate at. Within a month they have messed up 3 of our pizzas. I ordered delivery I was told 45 mins, 2 hours 15 mins later we got our order that was terrible. The pizzas have been soggy and tuff. Our waitress was rude and did t want to fix the issue. I called corporate once and I will be placing another call. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!"}
{"text":"Tried this for dinner tonight and got a thin crust pizza. The crust was very crunchy and was burnt on the edges. The middle was softer though. The toppings were delicious though."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered calzones by phone on a Sunday evening. For $7 each, I thought they'd be reasonably sized. However, after paying $16 (after tax) for two calzones, we got them home and were incredibly disappointed. These were calzones I would expect to pay $4 for, not $7. They were a flat, sad affair, with the bare minimum of cheese inside. Mine was mushroom and onion, but the mushrooms were clearly from a can and not seasoned or cooked beyond that.  I've liked Monical's in the past and enjoy their pizza and signature dressing, but their calzones are just terrible."}
{"text":"This is the pizza place in town that we order from the most.  We are partial to their crispy thin crust pizza.  The food always tastes great just as we expect.  Frequently (at least 50% of the time) they get our order wrong.  My husband hates peppers so we always ask to switch the peppers with olives.  Sometimes we get both and sometimes we get just peppers.  They are always friendly when I order but I have had bad experiences when I go to the store to pick up the food.  Once I stood in the lobby as three employees walked past me without asking if they could help.  I could understand if they were busy, but I could see two employees behind the counter engaged in what they felt was a very entertaining conversation.  Eventually a young lady took pity on me and offered to assist me.  She told me my pizza was not finished yet, but she rung up my order and said they would let me know as soon as it was finished.  I sat patiently and as time went by I began to wonder if they forgot to tell me my food was done.  Come to find out, it had been sitting on a shelf waiting just like me.   If good customer service is not at the top of your list then this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Loooooove Monicals. The inside is nice. Very sporty and is proud of being in Illinois!  Friends staff and so much food for the price."}
{"text":"Neat place , the thin pizza is good and be prepared for many many many little pieces.  But really the service is good and the pizza is unique.   Great toppings and crispy , crunchy crust.   We will try this again."}
{"text":"Best pizza from my hometown, though this is a city it's still good.  Also the only place I'd eat a salad at as a kid.  Loved their french dressing."}
{"text":"Slow service and bad food. The pizza is just ok. The appetizers are frozen and low quality. Service is always slow and they constantly forget basic things like straws. The family environment is nice for kids or big groups."}
{"text":"You know when your friend has told you about a place  for years and then you try it and you're like, 'don't get it'?  That's this joint.  We had an order of bread sticks, with a little cup of gas station nacho cheese for dipping.  The sticks were OK.  The bread, in fact, tasted like when you were a kid and your folks made white toast with margarine and put garlic salt on it and called it garlic bread.  I'm sure they have their devotees and it has some old school appeal, but meh.  We also had two thin crust medium pizzas.  The size of a medium is small 12\" and I thought next time I would get a large minimum.  One of the pies was half pepperoni and half sausage, the other a \"Delight\".  They put the pepperoni under the cheese which is not my personal preference because it always makes me think, where's the pepa!  The Delight is a specialty order and comes with sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, onions and green pepper.  The flavor was good, but the green pepper was a bit overwhelming to me and drowned out the other more subtle flavors of the mushroom.  The sauce is slightly sweet and you can taste the freshness of the mozzarella and to their credit both pies were well cooked.  They deliver too, which is a bonus.    Overall, it's A-OK, if you are looking for decent pizza, this is that place."}
{"text":"This is an ok monicals.  It may be the original but it's definitely not the best.  Cheese coverage on the pizza often leaves holes. Considering a thin crust large starts at more than $15 I think it should always have good cheese.  Just a bit hit or miss.  I've had other experiences where it's been quite good. If they trained their pizza cooks and had consistent cheese this would be 3.5 or 4 stars."}
{"text":"This monical's has been slow; but this time they went way down, by slooooow serving of bread sticks, even salad. AND more unbelievably the pizza served was missing a portion. The reason? \"The oven ate it\"- according to the waitress. We were made up with a personal small pizza, but just not feeling well after all the starvation and missing parts."}
{"text":"Food always tastes great, but service is hit and miss. I've had horrific service and then semi decent service. The hosts are always very attentive when first walking in, but service is usually downhill from there."}
{"text":"Looks so much better after their remodel! Servers are great, however, the management team here is very uncaring. The female manager in there was just cussing up a storm in the back for all to hear in the diner, but when you say something to the others in charge they don't care one bit. The management team has no respect for the customers."}
{"text":"I'm a pizza lover, and Monical's pizza is at the top of my list! The food is always great when I order from this location, but the older man who helps at the register is NOT friendly. I believe this is the owner, so you can imagine my disappointment."}
{"text":"there is something about this pizza that is addictive.  it's super thin and sort of bowling alleyish, but if you're in the mood for that sort of thing, monical's has you covered.  the secret to full pizza enjoyment here or at home if you do it that way, you must get their signature french dressing and then dip your pizza in that.  i know it sounds odd but everyone who is an experienced monical's pizza connoisseur knows this is the trick.  i would not advice eating in the restaurant...they seem to be anti-organization or anti-systems logic.  we just were there recently for a school fundraiser and waited 15 minutes before i got up and went to ask for help.  the weird stare i got from the manager said it all, never mind her response which was, \"oh, we weren't sure if you guys wanted to order or what.\", as if there was some other reason a family of 5 would enter a restaurant, sit at a table, and stare down every waitress that came within eyesight for 15 minutes.  granted they all looked like they were busy doing 20 things at once but still, it was pretty typical of this place."}
{"text":"If you like super-thin pizza, Monical's is the best.  The crust is crispy and crackling, with just the right amount of char, and the toppings are perfectly proportioned to not overwhelm the whole thing.  The pizza is cut into small squares and rectangles, to make you feel better when you take another piece!   Love it!"}
{"text":"Awesome thin crust pizza. The crust is cracker crispy, just burnt enough on the edges to give it the right smokiness.  The toppings are just right too.  Does anyone even order anything else?  FYI to Holly S., there was a Monical's in Chicago's Western Suburbs (Lombard?) a few years ago but sadly, it closed."}
{"text":"Lukewarm coffee, the Italian beef sandwich smelt funny, I would say just OK. This one will not itch me to come back, rest is up to others' choice."}
{"text":"I love their pizza, even though some people aren't a huge fan.  Getting a thin pizza and eating it with their red dressing sauce is the way to go.  It's a little on the pricey side compared to some other pizza places, but I absolutely love it and am always willing to splurge a bit when I'm hungry for great pizza."}
{"text":"It's not physically possible for me to visit Champaign without stopping in at Monicals. It's what I grew up on and any good foodie is loyal to their childhood favorites. Yes, there are better pizzas in the world but, for me, this experience is sacred.  I love this Monicals location - right off Mattis and centrally located with plenty of parking. Always bustling, the restaurant is roomy with several different \"wings\". I love how they also incorporated the University theme at the entry.  Here is my favorite thing to order The People Pleaser - this consists of a large bowl of shredded iceberg lettuce, shredded cheese and tomatoes. This is not a nutritional salad but I don't care - this is what I expect when  go to Monicals.  Pizza - Super thin crust, pepperoni, mushroom and sausage. BOOM. Oh, and they cut it into squares. Which means I get to indulge in the coveted corner pieces. Yes, I'm a little off center when it comes to my favorite foods.  Finally, you MUST (and I  mean must) dip your pizza in french dressing. It's probably the most sugary thing I've consumed in a while and most likely contains high fructose corn syrup and red dye #5 but that's what i came there for. Monicals is incredibly consistent and has been for 40+ years. Thank God for that....  Overall a fun experience with my extended family - we all loved it!  Can I just tell you how sad I am, however, that I left my leftovers, including the precious French Dressing, in the refrigerator of my hotel.  #StillInMourning"}
{"text":"We ordered the stuffed pizza. While similar to a Chicao-style pizza, this  had a bottom and top crust, as well as sauce on the top. It was FABULOUS! And it comes with 3 toppings for under $15. You gotta try it!"}
{"text":"I placed my order from the hotel at 6:18pm - an hour and ten minutes later my 30-45 minute delivery showed up (I ordered the wings and a tortellini dinner).  I travel 150 nights/year for work so I order food a lot.  These were the worst wings I've ever had  I called the manager and she freely admitted \"that's our worst food - we get the most complaints on the wings\" ... I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  Your company knows this ... yet continues to serve it???  Won't make this mistake again."}
{"text":"I'm reeeeaaaaally picky about my pizza, but this stuff was great!  We got the thin crust with steak and bacon and it was awesome!  However, the service is a bit challenged you could say... Our waiter forgot to get us water refills and forgot about our pizzarolles order or whatever they are called, but when we pointed it out, he compensated us really well, so no complaints really.  I think the food deserves 5 stars, but since the service is so..... I don't know what to call it..... I had to knock it down a star.  Also, when my boyfriend mentioned that the pizzarolles were delicious but he thought he was going to have a heart attack from all the grease (haha funny funny), the waiter filled us in with how bad they are for us, like trying to make cool conversation with us.  It pretty much horrified us and made me want to starve myself for a week, but like I said, he compensated our bill well."}
{"text":"i love monicals. always good to have some \"hometown taste\" when visiting. i was told it has changed a bit, but to me it was still as yummy as before."}
{"text":"Hubby told me its like the best pizza ever but I don't feel like it. I like other much cheaper pizza than this."}
{"text":"The service is always terrific even with the jump in business they have gotten since the other Monical's in town closed! Best thin crust in town!"}
{"text":"I ordered online for delivery and the pizza came in about 45 minutes. I was looking forward to the crust being crispy, but it was actually more chewy than anything else. The driver couldn't really find my house and drove around for quite a while/called for directions. The toppings were great, though. I just wish the crust had been better."}
{"text":"Love the thin crust pizza and the family/neighborhood atmosphere. The pizza crust is so perfectly crispy. Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Three stars because of nostalgia.  Monical's has always been around, as long as I can remember.  This location is probably the one I am familiar with the most because I use to live a few block from here when I was a kid.    Pizza is average, thin crust in little squares that is pretty soggy.  The Family Pleaser is what we always get.  Which just adds an iceburg lettuce salad and soft drinks to a pizza order.  Nothing bad, but nothing great either."}
{"text":"Went here after a doctors appointment one day. The pizza was good. The small salad wasn't their best. The service sucked. The waitress didn't give us refills and nothing was clean. She gave us our check but never came back to take our money. My husband almost walked out after being ignored at the desk by many waitresses that still wouldn't take our money. Finally, the manager did. I will not be back because of the horrible service."}
{"text":"I went here on a Tuesday evening with friends and we were practically the only table. Monical's was participating in a fundraiser for a local school, so we were doing a good deed by purchasing bland Italian inspired food products that were presumably for consumption. The food wasn't good. Salads, pasta, pizza and breadsticks were all ordered, and none were anything better than passable. If you grew up eating this stuff, I can see why you might like it, but not me.  The service wasn't great either: the waitress (who was not at all busy) was inattentive and made mistakes, but she apologized for them and was very friendly when she did come by, so no big deal. I did greatly appreciate that they separated the bills on a single receipt and of course that the were willing to partner with the school. The decor is quite nice for a family pizza place, but again the food wasn't.  1 star for the food, 1 for the charity, and 1 for them not complaining about what total asses we were being that night (I brought 'Would You Rather' cards, which created much merriment at our table but likely inspired only disgust and annoyance to the few other patrons and employees within earshot)."}
{"text":"Almost always good pizza.  Sometimes crust bottom and edges are burnt.  Breadsticks can be dark at times too.  Waitresses are usually nice and friendly but have had situations with rude people answering the phone which leads to me not ordering from them.  They also usually have good coupons as well.  The punch cards come in handy if you frequent the restaurant,"}
{"text":"The pizza is really good I personally like thin crust so they do have the best thin crust in town i would check it out if you like thin crust the salads are pretty amazing too."}
{"text":"This Monical person is only really good at making average pizza. The highlight of my pizza experience was the fact that they put a lot of mushrooms on my pizza. The Mozerella sticks were sorely lacking and the huge chocolate chip cookie I bought was pretty good. If you're looking for some average pizza, this is the chain to visit."}
{"text":"What can I say, as a native central-illinoisan, I miss Monical's the most.  They have the best pizza, although on this visit I did notice they seem to be baking the pizzas less than they used to.  Breadsticks are awesome, but have shrunk in size.  But they still have the famous red dressing."}
{"text":"The best thin crust pizza! The French dressing is amazing! Shout out to Randy the delivery guy (he plays bass)!"}
{"text":"LOVE the pan pizza. Killer great sauce and very large crowd freindly staff."}
{"text":"Haven't had much luck here in the past... BUT. Me and a buddy were out looking for steak and all of the steak places were busy as hell, and we fell upon monicals expecting the worst... We ordered the family pleaser... Simple salad awesome, service great.. Price fair... Pizza in the past..gummy tough not what I remember as a kid. This time around... WOW..REALLY GOOD..GREAT JOB. My only complaint is menu is very difficult to navigate through and very confusing.."}
{"text":"I love Monicals and you can't beat the family deal. Formidwextern pizza, Monicals is hands down my favorite."}
{"text":"Four stars for extra well done and crispy thin crust za.  2 stars for habitually lackluster table service.  Individual Pleaser is a great way to go at lunch, but you may wait longer than you should at lunch.  Good Luck on drink refills."}
{"text":"Service was just ok and they actually got our pizza order wrong.  The pizza was missing a topping that we actually paid for."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good! The service is awful but if you can past that then you'll really like this place! Everything is usually pretty fresh and hot."}
{"text":"My family has had an awesome experience every time we go. Each August we drive down here from Michigan and have a family dinner (group of 12). Service is good, food is great and it's a \"must\" each year we visit. Pizza is good, it's very non offensive and consistent. The bread sticks are super yummy, I like the nacho and cheddar cheese sauces with mine (can also get marinara of course). Salads are also delish with nice option of dressings. My kids enjoy both the pizza & pasta. My husband always has to get the French dressing to go(sweet & tart sauce I think they call it). It's popular enough they bottle it and you can buy one. He thinks it's just amazing, and he uses it for dipping his pizza crust. Absolutely worth a try, and if I lived here it would be part of my routine places to eat."}
{"text":"Pizza pan that our pizza was cooked on had cinnamon and sugar on it , probably left over from a dessert pizza or something so we got a weird cinnamon n sugar flavored pizza.  Breadsticks are odd there, more like a pretzel with salt and seemed way undercooked.  Service was subpar"}
{"text":"I love Monical's pizza, I really do. However, ordered 3 pizzas and a salad tonight for delivery and was told it would be one hour. At 1 hour and 50 minutes called to find out what the status was on our order. Was told by the person that they only had two drivers and they were behind.  Explained it might have been nice if they had said that when the order was placed and given us the option to pick up instead. Same person said that we should have been told an hour and a half. Ok, had we been told that we would have just gone and picked it up. When she checked on our order it was just coming out of the oven nearly 2 hours later. We said we would come and get it.  Talked to the manager when we got there and they very nicely took two of the pizzas off our bill. Got them home only to find out that they weren't cooked properly and the bottoms were completely doughy.  So now, two and a half hours after we ordered we are trying to cook two of the three pizzas and we'll never get the crispy bottom that should have come out of the pizza oven. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"It's fine.  Thin-crusted pizza (you can order a thicker crust, although I'm not sure why you'd want to) with the usual toppings.  Some specialty pizzas, calzones, etc.  The 8\" pizza with a simple yet fresh side salad is the perfect meal."}
{"text":"There was terrible service and I didn't see a waiter for the first 45 minutes. We waited in the waiting area for 30+ minutes waiting to be seated. Once seated, we had to ask to see a waiter another 20 or so minutes later. The food wasn't anything extraordinary and not worth the wait. I also heard several complaints from other customers about the terrible service while waiting for an eternity. This restaurants needs some major improvements before I even consider returning."}
{"text":"Note: Rating refers to their thin crust pizza -  but I couldn't care less about anything else about the place!  I live in Chicago and have eaten pretty much all of the \"brands\" here and I still love, love, love LOVE Monical's thin crust pizza the most.  I would do anything for them to open one here (why not?!).  When I go home to visit, a Monical's trip is 100% part of the plan and when my P's visit me they bring it...and it's just as amazing after a 2.5 hour drive.  Maybe as Joselyn H. says, it's because I was indoctrinated into loving this pizza from the mintue I could eat solids.  Actually, no.  Perfectly cooked, super thin crust (may want to ask for them to cook it like 1 mintue longer than normal to ensure perfection).  Awesome sauce and topping of seasonings.  Love the sausage - fresh, not too big, not too spicy and definitely not manufactured looking (like Dominos or something).  Their breadsticks - while relatively plain as far as seasoning goes (just sea salt YUM) - are awesome and a staple to my order.  They also have the best \"red\" (French) dressing that is their own recipe...but I am a \"both\"er and think it's at it's best mixed with the ranch.  It's not the fanciest salad in the world, but like the simplistic breadsticks, it just works.    Oooh and a pitcher of fountain root beer is the perfect bev.  Fast service, be ready to start eating the salad/breadsticks within minutes of ordering.  My parents say their prices have raised quite a bit, so that may be one downfall.  Gimme some Family Pleaser now!!!  Mouth watering."}
{"text":"What's not to like? I don't know if it's nostalgia from growing up in CU, but even when I was living in Chicago surrounded by amazing pizza places, I still found myself missing Monicals's pizza and French dressing!"}
{"text":"How can you not like Monical's? Really. Even living in Chicago, surrounded by pizza, I still missed some Monical's pizza with French dressing on the side! I don't know what it is, but it's always been a favorite. Also, bonus points for the delivery driver who is always super friendly and punctual!"}
{"text":"This place deserves no stars at all. We came from Florida to visit and my husband grew up eating here. We enter the restaurant and Moore at immediately however no one came to help us to take our order. It was very dirty in the restaurant and when we left because no one came to our table we told them why we were leaving and they did not seem to care. I would not recommend this restaurant at all"}
{"text":"Good food at a good price. The service is pretty good too. I only gave the 3 stars instead of 4 because if you want honey mustard on your salad you better bring your own as I have asked for honey mustard for 4 months .. they just won't supply any ."}
