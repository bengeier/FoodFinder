{"text":"A friend of mine and myself drifted in to the landing one afternoon and noticed a strong smell of burning rubber? We mentioned it to the server behind the bar, and she said \"Yea, I know, several people have mentioned this, and we have mentioned it to the owner, he won't do anything\"

Enough said."}
{"text":"The food is great, the service is amazing, and the prices are reasonable. This is, by far, one of the best restaurants in Stouffville. My wife and I have quickly become regulars and recommend it every chance we get."}
{"text":"Unhappy servers, overpriced food with long wait times. Can't really comment on food quality - gave up on my SALAD after half an hour- paid my drink tab and left."}
{"text":"This place was a great finding.  The food was really good.  We ordered the wings and the meat lover like pizza and they both were very tasty. The wings are pretty big too.  The rest of the menu looked really good too.  I would for sure go back to try other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"The food is so good here. I had the best burger I have had in Canada. Their pulled pork is amazing. My girlfriend has had their salads which are also super good. Drink prices are normal for the area with good selection of drafts. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch  and ordered a  fish sandwich,  I immediately regretted after taking my first few bites, I should have gone with a burger.  The sandwich wasn't terrible, but there was too much bun for having something as delicate as fish in the middle of it.  I found the type of bread just made it a really dry sandwich.  Perhaps slices of a bread instead of using a bun might have helped the carb to fish ratio. The fries are crazy addictive and service is just ok.  Didn't experience anything spectacular or worth commending like some of the other reviews on here.  I would come back though and perhaps give dinner a go."}
{"text":"Great place and excellent customer service. Potion sizes could be bigger at times but the staff is super friendly and the food is good."}
{"text":"We have been here many times but were especially impressed today! The owner is always present, always making sure everyone is happy and served.  
Today, it was my fianc√©es birthday and we asked for a picture. He took a lovely picture and after we were done our meal brought out a delicious dessert with a candle free of charge for him! It was an extra step that made us feel really special. 
Oh and all the food is great. We especially love the pizza. Very thin crust, made to order with generous toppings. Yum!"}
{"text":"The wings weren't that good this time - under seasoned. The amount of waffle fries we got with our order of 4 lb wings was sad. It's basically the same amount as a single order. They charged us for extra ranch and blue cheese that we ordered, which I understand places charge for that but they didn't even mention it. 

Another thing...which doesn't exactly speak to the establishment so much as it does to the patrons: I was there with my family. We are Asian, and as we were leaving the last that group of customers said, \"Tai Pan Tours is leaving now!\" It was just a racist comment that was completely unnecessary and makes me not want to visit this establishment again.

Not worth it."}
{"text":"Good place to get some bar food.  Overall everything i have tried was good.  Wings, pizza, burger...all cooked to my liking. Wish it wasnt so close to gas station."}
{"text":"Would rate a 2.5 but didn't want to rate with 3 stars to boost/keep rating higher.

Dining Establishments in Stouffville need to step up their game. We are not a one horse town here. People do have choices...

Stopped by here 'family day' to grab a hot cocoa and coffee with my son and a light snack. 

Had the poutine, honestly it was mediocre. But I never have high expectations for poutine anywhere in Ontario. Even Smokes...

But where my disappointment comes through is our server neglected to mention to me about the daily special when she gave our menus. I heard her after we ate, and were Awaiting the bill as she delivered menus to the table behind us that today was 'half price appetizers'. I guess we didn't look cool enough to be in the know for a savings/special. Would have been cool to get a deal on the sliders or dip or something. That is what can lead to return business. Trying something on a deal, enjoying it and perhaps returning to purchase it at full price at a later point.

May try again another time, but will be sure to check their website first so I know if there is a special, in case the server does not want to tell me about it again..."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best burger places in York region. Had the New Yorker burger, patty was marinated nicely and garnishes melted together for a distinct yet delicious taste. Fries were crispy on every bite but not burnt. Hidden weirdly behind a gas station and honesty would not have gone in there if it wasn't for word of mouth.  4 stars for going above on being inventive."}
{"text":"Great quality food and service with a variety of unique items and great grilled juicy homemade burgers and fries"}
{"text":"This is an easy to miss place so look out for the Mac's gas station and pull in. I mostly go here for lunch and the lunch menu is shockingly good with a good selection of beers and consistently great service. It can be full in the evenings so be prepared for a short wait. Lots of families earlier in the evening so choose your arrival appropriately. It also serves Stouffville's only local beer; Falcon. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Just ordered chicken wings because I was still full from lunch.  Good size wings.  Everyone else at my table demolished what they ordered, so the other items on the menu must be good!  Food portions were to my liking.  Service was great.  If I lived in the area I'd probably come here all the time.  Not much parking available, but I was lucky to get the last spot as I pulled in.  I will return if in the area, probably for lunch.  Cause driving up 9th line where there are no road lights at night creeps me out!"}
{"text":"Our go to place for pub food. Family friendly, fantastic service, huge portions. It does get busy so there may be a bit of a wait during certain times of the day."}
{"text":"I ordered take out and place was packed! Glad I ordered take out lol. I ordered crab cakes and the Seoul sandwich. I was really disappointed with the cakes mainly because it was filled with filers not real crab meat. However the sandwich was absolutely delicious, lots of rib eye steak with a great BBQ sauce and some aoli too. I could have done without the kimichi but it was still an amazing sandwich!! I'll definitely get it again!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff who start up fun conversations. I asked if they are able to change one of the tv screens to NBA and they did!! The guy there asked if I wanted to buy his tickets lol
If you're looking to watch the game and get some good food that's here. Super chill friendly atmosphere.
The only thing is... it's a bit far and in the middle of nowhere. I have a fear of farm lands with a random patch of trees in the far distance.

Delicious kimchi poutine and pizzas!

Is the name kings landing game of thrones inspired?"}
{"text":"Heard friends saying they have good burger so decided to try this place so we are in the area. Ordered the BBQ cheddar burger and the northern chicken sandwich. Both burger and sandwich are indeed delicious. The beef patty is quite juicy, and the chicken breast is tender. The waitress told us their pizza is also good and we did see quite a few tables ordered them, so maybe next time I'll try their pizza to see how good it's compare to other pizza shop."}
{"text":"This place is packed almost every night for all the right reasons. 

1. The menu is packed with fresh and local ingredients. The burgers are as good as you will find anywhere. 
2. The owner is hands on and fusses over every detail. 
3. The prices are very reasonable. Can feed a family of 4 with a couple of beers for $60. 
4. The wait staff are experienced and friendly. 
5. Music is not too loud. 
6. Did I mention the food is great. This will sum it up - when you order a burger (or anything else) you can sub out the fries for a spinach salad with walnuts with feta...yuppers! Its a gastro style pub good for the family or with friends and cocktails. 

Gordon Ramsey has been telling restaurant owners for years on how to run a proper establishment. Simple not too complicated menu, fresh local food, and great service. 

The Kings landing has got all of the above. 

Well done Justin and team!"}
{"text":"Location/Service:
Restaurant is at the corner of Stouffville/9th Line, by the gas station. There's some parking available in front of restaurant and more in another plaza across the street. Inside is not too spacious - big parties of 8-10 may be difficult, so it's more cozy with a family or a few friends. 

Staff were accommodating - we were a party of 6 and requested to sit in a smaller table during dinner hours. I also accidentally dropped the credit/debit card machine and they were still okay with it.

Food:
Reasonably priced items - we ordered Seoul Poutine, Chicken Wings and Pizza to share.

Seoul Poutine - one of their selling items. There's bulgogi, kimchi and cheese added to it. Brings out an interesting flavor - spicy, sour and fried. I didn't imagine the combo would fit well!

Chicken Wings - it was a mix of honey garlic and lemon pepper. Flavoring wise it was good. Waffle fries on the side was nice as well. The meat was little tough.

Pizza - I don't have a picture, but it was a Chicken style pizza. It's on the sweeter end because of the sauce, but not too overly sweet - which was pretty nice to taste.


Overall, I had a nice experience here. I heard their burgers are great as well - so I look forward to coming back and try."}
{"text":"Since Kings opened, its instantly been the best restaurant in Stouffville

food is quick to be delivered. pickup available. i would recommend the chicken wraps. almost impossible to get a spot on the weekend or any day around dinner time."}
{"text":"Kings Landing is probably the best restaurant in Stouffville. Never been disappointed when ordering from the menu, which they update with new options. So I guess that's my one thing I don't like, they got rid of the New York Burger which was my favorite.
You should try here, but be warned it is always busy!"}
{"text":"First time visiting the King's Landing and I was pleasantly surprised.  We came for the wings night - half off wings and you don't even have to purchase a beverage to get the deal!  Wings were pretty good and decent sized.  They even have waffle fries which are my fave and very hard to find.  The owner was very friendly and took the time to check on us and chat.  Finally a good place to eat in Stouffville!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has an interesting fusion dishes of pub food and Korean.   I got a delicious Seoul Poutine which was a mix of bulgogi beef, Kimchi and cheese curds on a bed of crispy fries.   The Spicy burger was filling and comes with a side salad or hash fries.   This restaurant was a short drive from Markham and was pretty busy for the Friday evening.   The owner was super friendly and came over to chat.   I'd definitely like to go back and try other items on their menu like their pizza."}
{"text":"After a stellar round of golf in the Stouffville area, we headed to the closest bar that we knew; The King's Landing. The King's Landing is a mid-sized bar located along Stouffville road. It has your typical bar look, with table and bar seating. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I get the feeling that this is a bar with a potential Cheers vibe, where everyone knows your name. Probably because in a small town like Stouffville, you eventually you'll see the same people.
Anyway, we sat at the bar and ordered some food. I got their nachos. In terms of toppings, this is your run-of-the-mill plate. You'll get corn tortilla chips, mystery cheeses, jalape√±os, olives, tomatoes, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole. At least aesthetically, I appreciated the multi-coloured tortilla chips, though in my childish mind I have to imagine each colour tasting different. (You've got to dream!) On a second aesthetic note, this was a pretty damn pretty plate. As for the flavour, I was not let down at all. I got exactly what you would hope to get from a plate of nachos; wasn't blown away, but enjoyed them thoroughly.

The bartenders and waiters/waitresses also deserve some props for some good, casual, friendly conversation. Again, Cheers vibe.

I'd say if you're looking for basic quality food and a relaxing bar environment, get yourself over to The King's Landing."}
{"text":"Came here for a Sunday lunch and I was thoroughly impressed!

The service was fantastic considering they were pretty much full with only two servers (though this place is pretty small).  Very friendly and made sure to check up on us appropriately.  They were very cheerful with everyone and you can tell how much they value good customer service.

I got a portobello and brie burger with onion rings.  The burger was huge (more than enough for a lunch) and was incredibly juicy, right down to the last bite.  The onion rings were cut thick, just the way I like them, and crispy.  They also came with a chipotle sauce for dipping, which made for a perfect pairing!

The price was very fair.  $12.50 for the burger with an additional $1.50 because I upgraded the fries to rings.

Only cons are the size of the restaurant and the parking lot.  A Sunday lunch almost filled up the restaurant, so I'd be wary to go around dinner.

I'm sure I'll be back for more because the menu looked so appealing.  The pizza that other tables received looked so good!

Overall, I'd highly recommend King's Landing for a casual, reasonably priced meal.  I'll try to update my review once I have a bit more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Service was exceptional. The staff were polite and very quick to serve. I walked in and was greeted immediately, so that really made my evening. Work was hectic today, so that actually meant a lot!

I ordered the ultimate cheese gourmet burger w/ poutine and gf got 1lb of wings. The portion was good, perfect size for average eaters. I haven't been feeling well lately, so I almost passed out after having my meal. The wings were huge! Each piece was big, drum stick or wing. Flavour was good, but not spectacular.

3.75 stars, round up to 4! :)"}
{"text":"Have only had wings and burgers to go. They are pretty good. Atmosphere is always lively and friendly. Service is prompt & very personable. Look forward to dining in sometime soon."}
{"text":"They have a great menu at this restaurant.  I highly recommend it.  Lots of TVs for the sports fans
Probably recommended to call for a reservation if you have a bigger group, because the restaurant is not huge.
The portabello mushroom Burger is a favorite in my house, and the pulled pork sandwich was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Reason I've given a 5 star here is simply because for Stouffville, this really is as good as it gets for casual dining.

Had the pleasure of eating here many many times and I'll be back many more.

One of the main reasons is the variety. There is just a nice smattering of different things to order. I don't feel compelled to order the same thing every single time i visit (although I often do). And having tried a number of dishes, I've found them all to be quite excellent in execution, flavor, and price.

This place has a nice modern interior, nice bar, nice booths and overall solid environment. 

My favorite item is the Buffalo Chicken Wrap. It's seems simple but it's done just the way I think it should be. No frilly bullshit and weird ingredients to try and re-invent the wheel. Cooked and sauced correctly, fresh ingredients and the flavor is on point.

I also love the Gyoza appetizer and the poutine is pretty darn solid as well.

You can't go wrong with pizza here as well. Probably the best non-chain pizza in town. Good selection of specialty pizzas as well.

My only complaint here is that sometimes the service is lack luster. Not often, and not because the servers are assholes. Simply because sometimes there doesn't appear to be enough staff to service the dining room most effectively. Even though the place is pretty small.

I've had the pleasure of meeting and talking to the owner several times. Really nice guy and always willing to chat and welcome you.

In summary, I'm giving King's Landing a 5 star rating not because its as good as it gets on Earth. I'm handing over the 5 stars because on an extremely consistent basis this place is as good as it gets in the lovely town of Stouffville."}
{"text":"A local restaurant with very friendly staff and decent food!

There seemed to be a long of people waiting when we got there on a Friday night. However, we were notify around a 10 min wait and the host did not disappoint. Between the 4 of us, we ordered and shared 2 Kings burger, 1 Seoul poutine, 1 Thai chicken salad, and 1 meat lovers pizza. 

The beef in the poutine wasn't as tender as it appeared in pictures, but everything else was good."}
{"text":"Tried this small pub for the first time,and was very impressed with the food.Although we had to wait for a table it was worth it.Wings and assortment of sauces were filling and reasonably priced.Service was excellent.We would definitely return."}
{"text":"Great little place in Stouffville! My husband and I had dinner there Saturday night and loved our experience. I had BBQ chicken sandwich and it was amazing. My husband had the ultimate cheese burger and he also loved it. We will defiantly go back! Staff was also very friendly and helpful! Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"This is our fave place in Stouffville! Food is always consistently delicious! Friendly staff, great service.

The only thing I wanted to point out with disappointment is that they no longer serve the Portabello Burger with a slice of brie cheese anymore. They now serve it with emmental cheese instead. The burger was still good but it was amazingly more delicious with the Brie cheese!

I still give them five stars!

{"text":"The King's Landing was a nice find!  We were thinking of a place between Markham, Uxbridge and Brooklyn to meet up with some friends and one of us suggested King's Landing.  It's a small yet stylish place with good eats. Our friend was worried about the TFC game but it was playing on both of the big screens. 

I had the Santa Fe chicken sandwich with a side poutine and it was delicious. The poutine's gravy had a rich flavour with a good balance of cheese curds. The chicken on the sandwich was well seasoned and surprisingly moist!  Usually chicken sandwiches are pretty dry but this one wasn't. The only drawback was that the bread was 90% burnt, like charcoal which was disappointing. Luckily I always check inside my sandwiches and the portion was generous so I decided to eat the chicken and toppings without the bread. I didn't want to give our server any hassle since we had a large group so I didn't let her know. 

Even so, we'd go back as the others had no issues."}
{"text":"We had dinner at this restaurant in the summer. I love the modern decor. 
Service was good. The menu is decent and has quite a few options.
I had a Canadian pizza (it's what I like, I know it's not adventurous).
My GPS (powered by Google Maps) took me past the restaurant and I had to make a right on the next main road and turn back. Maybe Google Maps is not up-to-date in this area. The restaurant is in fact at a set of lights at a corner which is next door to a gas station."}
{"text":"Very good menu. But twice I went there and I found hair in my food. And therefore I can never go back"}
{"text":"Great service, whether eat-in or take out! The wings are delicious, as are the nachos. Our kids love Kings Landing as well!"}
{"text":"My to go place for wings in town. Service is always great and food is always fantastic. I love the honey garlic wings and the Seoul fries. They have a wings special on Tuesdays but I would come here any day for wings. Highly recommend Kings Landing."}
{"text":"The food is always good. There is usually a line up to get in but the tables are cleared quickly and the service is excellent. The owner always stops by at some point during our meal.  My choice for dinner out!"}
{"text":"It looks like a bar.  But it acts like an inventive restaurant. I ordered the Bulgogi Burger, which is marinated thinly sliced beef with saut√©ed onions, saut√©ed  kimchee and a spicy kimchee mayo and Korean BBQ sauce.  I should have had a bowl to catch the drippings, it would have made a nice soup!

With a side Caesar for $11, this is a pretty good deal for a really tasty sandwich. Or burger. Or whatever it is, I want another."}
{"text":"Great food and  great service everytime! 

You have to try the Seoul Poutine ... so good."}
{"text":"Ahhh... King's Landing, the king of wings as I like to say. Whenever I'm going to King's Landing, I am always going to order 2lb of heavenly wings. Even though there is a small selection of flavours for wings, the majority of the flavours either hold their ground or excel in taste when comparing to an average batch of chicken wings. Honey garlic in my opinion being the best flavour, they add just enough sauce and crunch to really bring out such an appealing taste. Don't get me started on the half price upgrade for waffle fries on wing night. Not too many places offer waffle fries but dam... this place did it right!

The service can be slow sometimes, but they will always come to your aid and check if you ever need anything. The owner of the restaurant is very friendly and will always be willing to chat and make you feel comfortable and welcomed.

King's Landing is a must-have by being one of the best places to eat in Stouffville!"}
{"text":"Delicious chicken wings and huge servings. Cool bar setting as well. Worth a look for dinner in Stouffville."}
{"text":"This is like my 4th time back and this is place is a hidden jem. Everyone's hella friendly and there food is so good. The owner has worked in basically all the restaurants (jack Astors, pickle barrel, etc) and combined all of them together. I recommend the gyoza, spinach dip, and the pulled pork pouting for the appetizers! But I really need to try the desserts the next time I go!"}
{"text":"Best gastro pub in the area in my opinion. Not a slight either. It's beside the gas station and is a nice atmosphere for watching the game or grabbing a pint. Try and get a booth"}
{"text":"So happy to have finally tried this gem in town. Food, staff, owner - great!! 

My husband and I were able to have a lunch date sans child and it did not disappoint. We ordered shrimp and wontons to start. It was a good size app with more than the general 4-5 shrimp, they had a good kick and was delicious! My husband ordered the Seoul Burger which was marinaded rib eye, Korean bbq sauce, the bonus homemade kimchi (the owner's mom makes it) - my husband loved it. I ordered the Cubano chicken tacos which didn't disappoint. Also ordered their homemade raspberry sparkling lemonade (non-alcoholic) so good!! 

It was great to find a good place to eat in town without spending a lot money. The owner is super nice. Atmosphere is sports bar with family appeal. Love this place will def be back!"}
{"text":"Just move in town and discover the area surprise they have the Seoul Poutine. One of my favourite."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch after a wine tasting nearby. My boyfriend ordered the wings, it tasted frozen. My fish and chips was good. We also ordered pizza and a burger which were both ok. Service was a bit slow considering it was the lunch hour rush. Would probably try other restaurants nearby if we are in the area"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon King's Landing by querying for $$ restaurants? that have above average ratings.  We expected King's Landing to be a neighbourhood pub.  What we didn't expect yet gotten was really good pub food at reasonable prices, plus insane portion.  Now that is a proposition that I can get used to.

Many reviewers already noted that the decor is modern.  Nothing over the board, or pretentious.  Just pleasant and relaxing.  I may add that the washroom is clean and well maintained for the first half of the evening.  By the second half, it gets a bit messy.  

We consulted the previous reviews before we ordered.  The homework paid off.  The Portobello Burger ($12.75) was good. The bun was soft, and the beef patty tasted good.  I must add that the cheese was really nice.  The side salad was crisp and fresh.  

If the burger was a quality burger at fair price, then the Seoul Poutine was sinful deliciousness at a steal.  At $9.50, the Seoul Poutine featured bulgogi beef, cheese curds, kimchi cabbage, green onions, and gravy over fries.  Boy, the fries were perfect: crispy outside and warm and soft inside.  The kimchi cabbage added a kick to the gravy.  The savory gravy danced in harmony with the sweet bulgogi.  Okay, this was the first time I had Seoul Poutine, so I don't know how it compared to others.  Yet this Seoul Poutine on and in its own tasted good, looked good, and smelled even better.  The portion was huge.  It could be a meal for a person and a half.  It could be a tad too salty for some.  If you like saltiness like I do, I strongly recommend you to give this poutine a shot.

Services was good.  The greeter/manager was quick on his feet.  He was polite and pleasant.  Our waitress was the same, and always wore a smile.  It was a full house, yet she seemed? to be at ease with the rushes and chaos. 

This won't be our last visit."}
{"text":"Excellent pub. It's a rare case where pubs have good food and good service, so I was impressed. A bit hidden as its right beside the Mac convenient store, so once you see it turn into the plaza. 

Good selection of different items on the menu. I got the Bulgogi Burger (11$) with waffle fries and my friend got the Pulled Pork Sliders (9$). We also shared a pitcher of Keith's. Everything we had was delicious! 

Waffle fries was the highlight! It was fresh and crispy - perfectly cooked and served with chipotle mayo. Bulgogi burger was excellent and stayed true to what bulgogi tastes like. Very generous portion as well.

Servers were attentive and I think the manager/owner stopped by to ensure everything was good as well. By 6pm, it started to get busy in this small pub. 

All menu items are fairly priced and worth checking out. I will definitely come back and try the other items on the menu. If you're in the area, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband have been at this restaurant many times. The food is beyond amazing and great selection
And I see why there are line up's through the door during the weekday especially
Well worth the wait
I brought my dad here recently and he loved their burgers
The staff and owner Justin are always friendly always provide the best customer service
When it's game night, of course you wait a bit to get a seat in there , but again worth the wait,
 for the atmosphere is pretty awesome especially when a goal is scored.
I never wait forever for What we order which is great
And Sometimes, just because we live around the corner; we'll feel like ordering our food over the phone. The best part, is when they give you a time, for example, they'll say 10 minutes? It'll actually be ready in 10 minutes for us when we pick it up! And this is while there still busy serving people in he restaurant 
And We're ordering two meals and two appetizers too
So that's pretty quick service by phone
I definitely recommend this pub to everyone and we'll always be back"}
{"text":"While the food is not exactly mind blowing here, the service here makes up for everything.  Justin, the owner is probably the most personable guy there ever is.  He makes an effort to get to know everyone and he takes the time to go around making conversation with everyone.  You could tell that a lot of the clientele were people who are regular visitors and it's likely because of his charisma.  

My parents are in love with this place but I'm pretty sure it's mainly that they're in love with Justin - although they love the food here too.  Overall, it's a good place to hang out and a place that I would come back to."}
{"text":"Amazing dining experience!!!
Food is awesome!! Very yummy.. Hot and fresh!!
The Pulled Pork Poutine is a must-try!! Very tasty, portion is generous!

Price is very reasonable for the great food and generous portion you get! Burgers priced at $12.50 and $12.75 comes with your choice of salad or fries. Small pizza is $13.75 (good for 2 people), medium pizza is $ 17.25, and large pizza is $21.50.

10 Stars for Excellent customer service!! The waiter and waitress were very helpful and friendly!! You can really feel that they are happy to serve you and they love their job. My server, Jessie, is amazing! She brought us more napkins before we even asked for it. She has great common sense, of course we would need more napkins when we order finger food like pizza and burger! She brought over a pizza box to pack our unfinished pizza without us asking for one!! She checked on us several times to ensure everything went well! 

Overall, this is a great place for casual meal!! Great food, great service, nice atmosphere, comfy seating!!"}
{"text":"The King's Landing is located off of Main Street in Souffville, kind of in a little bit of an awkward spot right next to/behind a Mac's. It's easier to see/get into off of Winona Drive.

So there were three of us on a fairly busy night. There aren't a TON of restaurants in the Stouffville area, so I think the decent ones tend to get packed. There were a few groups of people waiting for tables, and it took a little bit longer than the time given us for the seating estimate, but it wasn't a huge deal to us. 

They have a fairly standard pub menu, your pizza and burgers and wings and stuff, but with a few twists. 

I really wanted to try the \"Seoul Poutine\" but my friends were less adventurous, so I decided to go with the Seoul Burger instead. It's not a burger per se, but a steak sandwich, with sliced ribeye and kimchi. It was really tasty, with good beef and nice tangy but spicy kimchi. 

Lee had a French Onion dip, that was really tasty, he enjoyed it very much.

Service was overall really friendly and nice after the initial hiccup with seating. I'd definitely come here again!"}
{"text":"Incredible atmosphere tonight, games on all the tv's above the bar and my food was wonderful.  The lovely waitress who served me was incredibly kind and helped me out with a lot of enthusiasm and helped me with my order.   The food came out quickly and it was absolutely delicious.  I ordered the ultimate cheese without the jalape√±o cheddar and the produce, and it was incredibly tasty, juicy and was cooked to perfection.  Wonderful place all around I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Great food! Went on a Sunday and it wasn't crazy packed. Good presentation of the food too! I'll definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Small, cute location in Stouffville - friendly service and menu full of choice.  I ordered the Seoul poutine (soooo gooddddd 5/5) and the New Yorker burger with onion rings (ditto! 5/5).  Friends ordered the coconut shrimp (huge and so tasty!), the spicy? pizza (size small is a very big \"small\") and though I didnt try it, the consensus at the table was that it was also delicious.  I can't wait to come back and try more things! Parking is in issue and be prepared for a wait on a friday or saturday night dinner but food-wise, a definite recommendation!"}
{"text":"We found this place accidentally last year. When my boss asked to meet with me midway today my husband actually remembered the name and asked to come. The place is open, modern and clean. Quite attractive and comfortable. The food is really  good and the service is excellent. Last time we were there we both enjoyed our meal but kept watching the dishes other people were ordering and ended up making a take out order to bring home for supper. My boss enjoyed her food and was pleased the place. It was very busy and sometimes the noise level was a bit high, but well worth having to ask someone to repeat themselves."}
{"text":"Decided to come here after hanging out with a few friends. It's considered local for the area. 

Food- My friends and I ordered a lot of appetizers and main entr√©es. All in all I could say that the food quality was pretty good. We ordered nachos, crispy wontons appetizer, chicken wings, pizza, and a burger. To be honest we came here when we were really hungry so we ordered a lot. The food was very flavourful but typical for barfood. The portions are huge so it is very easy to share entr√©es and appetizers. Nothing to outstanding nothing too great but very flavourful.

Service-  Very attentive service. Even though there was a long line up at the door the server still kept up with the lines just to get a feel for how many people are coming in. He always kept updating us about our table status. Amazing customer service would not change anything about it. Even though our waitress was busy she kept up with orders in a timely manner. 

Parking- Not a lot but enough for the restaurant to hold. Most of the parking spot around the gas station into the side of the building."}
{"text":"Yummy!  Had the haddock sandwich - it was    like having a gourmet filet o fish :)  My husband ordered the wings and my friends got the ribs.  Ribs were delicious - fall off the bone good.  Didn't try the wings but the fries were crispy and delicious as well."}
{"text":"I was pretty skeptical when my sisters said King's Landing was \"really good\". How can pub food in Stouffville be good?! I was so wrong. The menu was perfect--there are pizzas, burgers, salads, ribs, wings--something for everyone. But they are not just your standard pepperoni pizza/burger; every food item is dressed up! 

So it's not just poutine, it's SEOUL Poutine. And (you guessed it), it's a korean twist on poutine with korean bbq sauce, kimchi, ribeye, cheese curds, and yummmmmmm. It was delicious and so flavourful. I got the portobello burger (and believe me, it was hard to choose between their blue cheese, \"seoul\", and spicy burgers) and I was pleasantly satisfied. Probably one of the best burgers I've had in a while; the patty was smokey, the toppings and flavours came together really well, and the thin fries that came with it were very, VERY good. Only downside was the portobello mushroom was a tad undercooked, but I still really enjoyed it. 

The wings were surprisingly bigger than the ones you find at actual chicken wing joints, and the pizza we ordered was also delicious. 

I'm definitely coming back and I recommend to everyone!"}
{"text":"Love Kings Landing! The exteriors nothing to look but a hidden gem of Stouffville inside. Consistently great food and excellent service. Great on price too.
Visted now atleast 10 times and never disappointed."}
{"text":"Good:
1. Food - Don't think I've ever had a bad dish here, everything is wonderfully seasoned. Seoul poutine is great, portions are large, maybe a little on the saltier side but very tasty.  Spicy burger, love the ingredients, the avocado, the patty, the bun.  It all works together.  Get the waffle fries!  Wife also loves the bacon mac and cheese.  She said it can't get any better unless they put pancetta instead of bacon.

2. Ambiance - Lots of TVs everywhere.  Easy to enjoy the game while enjoying the company and the food.

3. Service - It being a smallish place, service is always prompt and friendly.

Neutral:
1. As with all places with good food, it can get busy here during dinner hours with lengthy waits.  Come for lunch instead if you like a quieter vibe.

Worth it?
Yes!  Very standard and reasonable pricing for pub food and the portion size.  I like to make the trip from Markham every now and then when I crave good pub food."}
{"text":"I hate giving this place a bad review because the service and people were amazing. Good selection of beer at decent price point. Welcoming servers. Made adjustments. 

However me and my friends bought about 45 wings to watch the NFL playoffs. All the wings were over fried and dry. I could have made these wings throwing them into a fryer for too long. Whoever cooked then clearly didn't care about it. And I had a couple onion rings that tasted like something had gone wrong. Ended up having severe stomach flu, missing two days of work, and not having a meal for two days. 



Overall this isn't a review saying don't go here. Go but don't order the wings or onion rings."}
{"text":"I am still thinking about the burger with Portobello mushroom and thick slice of brie cheese I consumed here on Friday. I had fries as my side. My burger was ...OHH delish!!

 My friend had a burger with blue cheese and caramelized onions. She had a garden salad as her side.

We took our time eating as the portion was quite large. As we sat chatting the place filled right up. People were lined up to get in by 6:30. When a local place is that jam packed you know its a winner!!

Huge fan I will be back for sure!!

My advice to you is to arrive at around 5:00 to get a seat. Service is very friendly restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"Got there and had to wait for a table, which is fine. However; no one went to clean it and we spoke to 3 people for a table and they'd just go on with their business and we just stood there and were kinda neglected for awhile. (That's why they lost a star). But once we sat, it was all smooth sailing from there. Our waitress was great, told us we ordered A LOT of food, so we took an app off, which was really nice of her:) The owner came over and joked around with us which was really nice. Food was AMAZING! Love the subtle fusion of Korean in there. Overall, we really enjoyed it and will definitely be going back! I know salads are pretty boring, but I loved my Kale and quinoa salad with grilled chicken! Also, Seoul Poutine is a must try and their pizza looked divine! See you guys again soon!"}
{"text":"Dropped by The King's Landing to watch NHL final game, so this review is based on more sport bar experience than the food.

Beer selection does need improvement. If Boston Pizza in the area can have Falcon Ale from Stouffville Brewery on tap and tallboys, I do expect a little more from The King's Landing.

We ended up ordering Rickard's Red and Shock Top. 

There are quite a few HDTV so not a bad place to catch any games. I probably will be back again and try the Bulgogi Burger next time!"}
{"text":"Nice place to hang out with friends. Decent pub food; place is a bit small though. It does get pretty jammed during dinner hours 
Overall we had a good experience, will return"}
{"text":"Was there for lunch and the food was decent for a pub style restaurant. The service was ok but it seems like there was only on e wait staff during that time so getting service was a little wait sometimes. The setting looks pretty new but the seats had patches on it. 

The food: got the Seoul burger because it sounds different, no beef patty but kalbi beef topped with some kimchi and mayo. Nice balance of kimchi, it wasn't too sour or too spicy. I would definitely recommend trying this burger out. Flavor was good and reasonably priced.

Also tried one of their pizza, a thin Italian crust. Flavour was good but I prefer their burger more."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! Awesome service!! Owner is a wonderful friendly guy who is always around as well! (As previously being a server, I appreciate this, it really shows a lot)"}
{"text":"Amazing burgers! Tried the Blue Cheese burger and it blew my mind! So tasty. I was looking for handmade patties and that's exactly what they offered. Great service. Friendly staff. Lots of smiles. Good beer and wine selection. Nice clean atmosphere. Feels like you're stepping into a whole different world when you come in. You forget it is right near a gas station!"}
