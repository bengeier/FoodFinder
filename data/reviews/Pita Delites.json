{"text":"Amazing service & the best food in the Durham region...hands down!!! I actually crave their food everyday and that's not normal. The owner is the sweetest guy ever, and always welcomes me when I come through the door. I always get a special order of tabouli with chicken shawarma on top and garlic with hummus all over. My mouth salivates when I even think of it. I give this place 5/5 stars! 

From, your #1 fan"}
{"text":"Shawarma's are amazing here. They prepare it quick, service is great and people are very friendly and welcoming! It is reasonably priced too. Would recommend to everyone. :)"}
{"text":"Best place for falafel and shawarma around. Owners are super friendly. Only thing is I think they are a bit pricey compared to places in the city."}
{"text":"My go-to for shawarma and falafel!

My mom used to bring home shawarmas from here back when I was just transitioning into high school from elementary school. I absolutely loved it.

She used to take me here every few weeks, and by the time I had my driver's license I was going here by myself. The guy still recognizes me from so long ago.

The falafel is tasty, the shawarmas are savory, the toppings fresh. What else do I need to say?

Just drop by and give them a try!"}
{"text":"Best chicken shawarma hands down . Been to pretty much every place in the GTA and Los Angeles . Nothing compares to this place . It's family owned and they really take pride in serving ! Everyone I have brought here who likes shawarmas are always blown away ! The best"}
{"text":"Nothing too special. I tried the chicken shawarma and it was ok.  Service was a bit slow but I wasnt in a rush. The servers were not having a good day I can tell by the grumpy faces."}
{"text":"It was okay but nothing special.  The pita bread in my falafel wrap was dried out and tough.  Kind of ruined it for me."}
{"text":"The Shawarmas are great! Taste good, and pita is crispy! Would come back here! For the size of the Shawarma, it doesn't feel worth the money. Would be better if it was a little cheaper."}
{"text":"I bought the family platters (see photo) and it was amazing! We sent food home with everyone and still had leftovers. The quality of the food was excellent! I didn't like the beef, I thought it had a weird texture, but my family liked it. I would definitely order from them again, but I would probably ask for more chicken to replace the beef."}
{"text":"Pita Delites is located in a strip mall in downtown Ajax.

I ordered a chicken shawarma sandwich and was somewhat disappointed. The meat and vegetables did not taste very fresh to me. I did not expect much, considering it was Ajax, but the quality of food ($9) did not warrant the price.

I have had much better shawarma in the GTA. A plus is that they have fried pita crisps that you can add to your shawarma."}
{"text":"Started becoming a regular here recently.

I attest to the below \"Hey Boss - What are you having?\" as a trade mark greeting to regulars.

Correct a very family run Shawarma restaurant/ take out spot. 

It has its regulars, locals, cops, fusion of all kinds of people who go in for some pretty tasty food with different sauces that provide all kinds of flavour,

Despite the amount of regulars, the owner actually remembers each customers exact toppings they order to the amount of hot sauce, which amazes me.

I feel fresher after eating here, at a reasonable cost, good service, and a newspaper, which is why I go.

If you have already tried it, you know whats good.  If not, pop in here for a reasonable on the go meal :)"}
{"text":"Best shawarma in the area...the best garlic dip i have tasted so far.
the only downside is that it is a bit pricy .."}
{"text":"Amazing staff, amazing authentic food, fast, fresh, and DELECIOUS! Best middle eastern food in Durham region..."}
{"text":"Fantastic Falafel & Chicken Pita !
They will make you feel at home.
Great place .... We Will be back !"}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma with rice and salad is one of my favorite meals in Ajax/Whitby. Just simple food done right. Their shawarma wraps are also great. Service is consistent and pleasant."}
{"text":"What makes me sad is that I live across the road and only had this for the first time a few months ago! This is without a doubt the BEST Shawarma I have ever had!!!!

It is a very small nook and mainly a take out restaurant. It has three tables inside and that's it. The cook/owner and his staff are amazing and friendly. My personal favorite has to be the Falafel Pita, it makes my mouth water just thinking about it!

Don't worry about breaking the bank here for the food the price is just right :)"}
{"text":"I'm going to give this 4 star. Walk in to this little place. Owner is hilarious.  Made a bold statement \"this is the best lunch you'll ever have\"  I'm thinking pretty brave as I haven't wrote the review yet but I like the confidence. 

I had the mixed plate both chicken and beef very tasty. Hummus garlic sauce good as well. Salad absolutely delicious.  Best of all the hot sauce. Homeade hot oil type. 

Only lost a star to portion size. I'm like \"what is this a plate for ants!?\" 

I would return though."}
{"text":"These guys are rude, I ordered a salad and one of the guys went off to start making it. So I walked over to see what he was putting on it and as he started to put everything on it I asked him not to put the cucumbers on, then he started yelling at me because when I first walked in I was on my phone. There wasn't a line-up and they were finishing someone's order when I first got there. 

So I just told him I don't want anything and left. 

I am a regular there, but today was the last time I would go."}
{"text":"Best shwarma in ajax! Everything on the menu is delicious, although I haven't tried the falafel, which is next on my list! The owners are beyond friendly and always make my visit a good experience.  Definitely check this place out if you like shwarma & pitas!"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom.  Wraps are good, can safely assume the platters are too. Baklava wasn't anything special though"}
{"text":"The. Best. Felafel. 

Seriously, I'm a vegetarian and a felafel conoisseur...I've eaten most of the acclaimed felafels in Toronto, and I can tell you that the owner of Pita Delites makes just about the best you can get.

But forget the felafel, because what will bring me back to Pita Delites over and over from the city is his garlic sauce.

I don't know what kind of witchcraft he employs when he's mixin this sauce, but its literally the greatest thing I've ever eaten. Do yourself a favour - get some fries, and allow him to smother them in this garlic sauce. It will BLOW YOUR HEAD clean off your shoulders. 

In short, eat here. The owner is some sort of psychic prodigy of the felafel way, and he remembers everyone who walks in. I was there once, six months ago, and he remembered my frickin -order-.

In my humble opinion, there are very few reasons I would ever want to go to Pickering. +1, right here."}
{"text":"Since this is close to my house, my mother and I make this part of our date night. Family run business. The falafels are one of the best i've ever tried. Hence why I always get the falafel wrap."}
{"text":"Visited today for the first time and had a falafel.  The owner(s) are beyond belief friendly.
It is tiny place with lousy street scene awareness as it is facing a plaza and is not visible from Kingston Road.
Having said that I think this is a hidden gem of a place.
The falafel was delicious with a great assortment of tastes and just the right amount of hotness. 
Worth a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"One of the Best Shawarma places in Durham.  The family is extremely friendly and accommodating.   Excellent tasty meat.  Try their extra hot sauce that they keep under the counter.  It will sweat you up.  One of the few places I'd get a craving for."}
{"text":"A busy family run establishment with both take-out and eat in areas. Regulars are greeted with \"Hey Boss - What you having\".

a) Felafels are really fresh - I heard the grandmother makes them fresh (not sure how true that is..however, they are green inside (that is an indicator of FRESH chickpeas being used for the Felafels).  They have pickled turnip (YUM) and all the other toppings you could ever possibly wish for (2 types of hot sauce, tahini, tabouli, onions, olives, lettuce, pickles, hot peppers, slaw, cabbage, hummus, tzaiki etc)
b) Shawarma the meat is fresh/roasted spit/ and not the processed mystery meat that some places serve.
c) the Lentil soup is home made and delish
d) potatoes mediocre and pricy.

It's a little pricier than your usual spot that sells the same grub - but the food is fresh and it is a family run place and NOT a chain establishment with mystery meat and greasy pre-made dried regurgitated Felafel balls (so this could be an indicator of why it is a little pricier than other places)."}
{"text":"Really excellent shawarma and service, too!  Casual place.  Typically a line-up, but it goes fast.  They are so good with kids!  I saw them customize a meal for a picky eater.  They are also good at recognizing regulars and remembering their order.

Have had the shwarma (fav), souvlaki, lentil soup and a number of the appetizers and all have been great."}
{"text":"I've always been a big Shawarma fan and so much so that I would brave the 25 min drive to Lawrence/Warden Shawarma alley at least once a month.  I know, that doesn't seem like very often to some but try doing this with a 8 month old in tow then you'll appreciate how serious this trek really is.

When I first stumbled upon Pita Delites over a year ago while visiting \"I love roti\" in the same plaza, I thought 'Great!  If this place is good, I'll only have a 10 min drive for a good Shawarma.'  But alas, that was not to be my fate.  

We tried their beef and chicken Shawarma on multiple occasions since they never seem to have the lamb they advertise on their menu.  I would say the overall quality of the meat is just ok.  And I don't mind my meat toothsome but their beef is beyond that....it's tough.  The seasoning is a little weak also and I don't like the fact that they have pre-sliced the meat off the spit and keep it in a warmer container.  Perhaps this explains their ho hum meat quality?

When we placed our order while longingly eyeing the beautiful, juicy looking meat rotating on the spit, what we got instead was the pre-sliced container meat.  I must say, we felt a little cheated by this.  The condiments were just ho hum also but what got me was that they didn't have the quintessential pickled turnip I heart so much.  How could they not have the pickled turnip in a Shawarma joint???  

Overall, Pita Delites failed to delight me so I'm still doing the monthly Shawarma drive to our good ol' Shawarma alley."}
{"text":"A small setup with about 3 tables. Mostly for take-out. One man handles the toppings and the other handles the meat. Both were extremely friendly and got things done quick. $9.99 for 2 small shawarma and a can of pop. Lots of fresh veggies as toppings for the shawarma. I thought it could have used a bit more meat though. I still thought the meal was a bit small even though there were two shawarma's but I think that's just the pig in me speaking."}
{"text":"Good shawarma and toppings but they're a little on the small side. Like the wraps, the resistant itself is also tiny. There is no room to really eat inside but it's perfect if you're just grabbing a few wraps for lunch. It's a good little place to grab a  shawarma to go."}
{"text":"The food is great, fast, healthy, with  friendly staff.  Usually busy take out."}
{"text":"Our favorite place for falafels in Toronto. The guys that run it are friendly and fun, and the food is fantastic!  We come about every week or two."}
{"text":"Shwarma Heaven!!!!  Also known as Pita Hut......Imad the owner is usually always on site and super nice to deal with, I think he remembers everyone and always has a huge smile an makes you feel like your the first and only customer! Anyways, on to the food..excellent shwarmas, I have had them all over and his are among the best I have ever had! First of all he has ALL the ingredients they are supposed to have (a lot of places dont), and then he grills them in the proper press to finish (most places dont, and dont have the proper grills either!!!)...he offers fabulous meals that you can call ahead and take home, huge portions and always the best quality, and fresh!!! This guy has been wonderful since the day he opened and we will always be regular customers, and I hope anyone reading this will please go try him, its not like all the other pita places, trust me! He is in a class all his own. The prices are very good but this also because your not paying for any fancy...just a little spot with a few tables...
In the same mall as the Manderin and No Frills shares the building with the Flaming Burger Place."}
{"text":"These guys are great - very welcoming and warm, family atmosphere.  The chicken is fresh and good sized pieces.  Sometimes when you get shawarma you wonder about the chicken pieces as they are sort of sketchy, but their meat is pretty chicken-y and flavourful. No mystery here! 

Then they are also very accommodating with the rice, potatoes, salad and sauces - whatever you want they will substitute and make it work - no hassle.  A lot of places they dump a pound of rice and some chicken and then pour hot sauce and it's over, not here! 

Anyway check it out - one of my favourite places in Durham and I think even ranks higher than Cyrus."}
{"text":"Had a good shawarma the second time I was there. They make the falafel from scratch which is nice. The gentleman is friendly and enjoys what he does. Would recommend for a quick shawarma.

Update: had the falafel this time was amazing. Only criticism is the size of the shawarma"}
{"text":"Used to love coming to this place,  great food and big portions , now barley any chicken in my wrap and it was so dry and so small basically just pita bread and the service was quite rude which usually is delightful, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Fantastic homemade food. A little hole in the wall place behind another restaurant in a parking lot. I had the 8-piece falafel, freshly-made, put in a pita with pickle, tomato and garlic potatoes. Goodness. What a find!"}
