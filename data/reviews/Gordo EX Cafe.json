{"text":"Out of the 3 Venezuelan restaurants I've been to, this is by far the best of all. 
Everything in this place taste exactly how it should be. I've tasted the Teque침os, empanadas, cachapa and Arepas (Reina). You cannot go wrong with this place, I highly recommend it and it's not expensive at all.
El Gordo (the owner) is such a nice guy and the first time I went with my girlfriend he spent about 1 hour talking and laughing with us (We're both venezuelan).

Awesome place!"}
{"text":"came here with a friend because this was the only venezuelan restaurant in the city he hadn't tried yet. the food here is amazing -- delicious, fresh, authentic. BUT, the service is ridiculously slow. my friend waited nearly an hour (i'm not even kidding. more than 50 minutes) for his cachapa.

at least the cachapa (corn pancake with cheese and beef) was fantastic. seriously delicious, and a generous serving too. i got the pabellon criollo (black beans with cheese, white rice, fried plantains, and shredded beef stew), which was also delicious and too much for me to finish (even with my friend's help) so i had to pack it up to go.

we also got the tequenos (cheese sticks), which came with chipotle, guacamole, and ranch? sauce. my fav was the guac but my friend was really into the ranch sauce.

the cheese here is incredible. apparently it's imported from montreal or something, which sounds about right because it's unlike any other kind of cheese i've ever had before and goes perfectly in the tequenos and cachapas.

this place is a bit on the pricey side. those two entrees, plus two tequenos, and a passion fruit juice and papelon con limon (sugar cane and lemon drink), plus tax and tip all totalled to just over $50 for lunch for two people. the service is nice enough (and actually pretty cute -- the little girls actually made conversation and were sweet), but the wait is kind of a killer. worth it if you're coming for the authentic venezuelan fare, but just be prepared to wait there for a pretty long time to get it."}
{"text":"This place has amazing food but terrible service. They often forget orders, take a long time to greet you, don't give you cutlery, napkins w/o having to ask etc. But the food is so good! The arepas and empanadas are delicious. It's just a bummer that u have to deal with horrible service in order to enjoy the great food."}
{"text":"Very friendly waiter and great atmosphere. Food was very good, filling and authentic."}
{"text":"Excellent Venezuelan restaurant, Good quality food and superb attention. Portions are big and well priced. Do not leave without trying the TEQUENOS and no they are not Montreal sticks or chesse sticks, They are unique and extremely tasty!!"}
{"text":"I went to this place with my family, we are venezuelan so we are used to the food. The Pabellon was really good especially the flank steak. Cachapa at the place was OK, unfortunately we order two to go and one of them was all burned, this is bad...you do not pack burned food! We found out when we got home. Service was extremely slow. Decoration is very nice with pictures of Venezuela, pretty cool."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good when they actually have what you want on the menu, but the service is terrible.  I live nearby and I have never had this personally but several people who I know have been there recently and had a automatic gratuity added to the bill, even if they were only 2-3 people **beware**"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a delicious and relaxed meal. A lot of the menu is gluten free which is a win for me. Arepas and the corn pancake are really really good and filling. 
Service and atmosphere not the best, but I don't care. I'll keep coming back to fill up on this delicious food!"}
{"text":"Best Venezuelan restaurant in Toronto!!! So far, the best arepas I've tried in Canada! Totally love it!"}
{"text":"These tequenos are wonderful. They're like mozza sticks with better crusts. 

The empanadas are fried, so they're a bit oily, but when you feel like a crunchy dinner, this will certainly hit the spot. This place is a much-appreciated addition to Bathurst-Dupont!

Tip: the entrees are huge; share if you can.

Viva Venezuela!"}
{"text":"A friends of mine from Venezuela suggested me to go there. Foods were so good. Prices were much more reasonable and portions were good. The atmosphere was good. It took long to prepare for foods, but it was worth of waiting."}
{"text":"The food is not worth the wait. Poor quality of ingredients, we also ordered a mango juice and is it was from a box. We won't becoming back to this place."}
{"text":"Excellent Venezuelan food! The empanadas, arepas, patacones and cachapas are really tasty, the food is just amazing!"}
{"text":"Amazing food,  Venezuelan food is great. Really like it here and have been many times now."}
{"text":"Good Venezuelan food, slow but friendly service. The Empenadas (chicken) and Cachapas are delicious. The Arepas are a bit salty but OK.  Its a bit expensive but for the empenadas and chachapas its worth it. My wife had the Sancocho which was very expensive $18 for a bowl of greasy soup she wont order that again."}
{"text":"Great little place.
Understand you come here for the food, not the service (cause its extremely slow).

Food: 4.5/5
Decor: 4/5
Pricing: 3/5
Service speed: 1/5

Waiters are overall very nice but they do not hire professional waiters so they have no clue what they are doing. You have to give it to the kids, they do try, but on weekends, service will be slow. The food however is well worth it."}
{"text":"Chill spot, guy. Venezuelan comfort food, yeah? Gordo, indeed. 

We like it here and it's on repeat. I'm happy to pay $9 for a simple and tasty meal of 3 tacos (beef, chicken or pork), a nice helping of avocado salad and 3 DELICIOUS house made sauces (tomato salsa, avocado sauce, garlic sauce). The massive apera sandwiches are filling and satisfying ($6.75 or $7.75 depending on type), but I'm not sure that this will be my favorite thing at Gordo Ex once I try everything on the menu. 

Beware: the garlic sauce is irresistible. Fattybakes approved."}
{"text":"I've come to this restaurant several times and I really like everything I've tried (arepas, cachapas, teque침os, jugo de papel칩n, jugo de parchita, pabell칩n criollo, etc). The portions are big and it's not expensive.

Staff is usually friendly but the last few months they haven't been very welcoming or talkative. Service is REALLY slow and they don't make eye contact every now and then to see if you need something or if everything is fine. If you need to talk to the server, you have to stand up and go to the front.

They barely say hola/hi and they take sooooooo long to make the food or bring the bill to the table. So if you're in a hurry, this is not the right place to go to.

I'm still happy to go back every time I have cravings for food that taste like home. Although, it would be nicer if the server makes people feel welcome and pay attention to the needs of the patrons."}
{"text":"Amazing little Venezuelan cafe/restaurant. They carry uniquely named coffee (tetero (mostly milk), negrito (black) and a couple of other cool ones)
The staff is friendly and helpful. 
The portions are big. And if you want a cheese overdose (in the best way possible) you should order corn pancake with white cheese. Delicious! prepare to have your taste buds orgasm in pleasure. 
The arepas are of course also amazing. You can choose baked or deepfried arepa. Both are great. 
What looked amazing judging by other tables; orders: the fried plantain dishes.mmmmm! yum!
Don't forget tequenos (cheese fingers) before the main dish. 
AND to top it off: the desserts are of course will throw you into a sugar coma but they are totally worth it. The three milk cake is delicious!. 

Make sure you have a long walk planned after eating at this place.... you will need to kill couple of thousands of calories."}
{"text":"Amazing Venezuelan food. If you want to taste Venezuelan food, this is the place to go. The place is very cozy, and warm, the service is very good. And the food again, delicious!"}
{"text":"Came here after a work session one night, was recommended the steak arepa and holy hell it was DELICIOUS! Probably tasted even better since I was hungry.

The arepa dough reminds me of a Chinese steamed bao bun, but is lighter with less chew. It's pan fried on the bottom to give it some crunch (awesome!) and mine came with cheese tomatoes avocado and steak.

Just be warned that it's not going to be fast food and you might be waiting for a while. But it's definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Solid place. I live nearby so it's a good place to drop in when I don't feel like cooking. Everything I've tried is very flavourful. The Arepa Reina (chicken/avocado arepa) is really tasty but the mayo to avocado ratio is wayy off, too much mayo and not enough avocado. The beef empanada is a good size and very very tasty. Portions are decent for the price too."}
{"text":"I love the food at this place. Really authentic, great tasting, and hands-down the best Venezuelan food in town. However, don't arrive there when you're already hungry, as you'll have to wait a long time for your food to be ready - which is understandable because I believe they make everything fresh, and Venezuelan food itself takes a long time to cook. 

Also, avoid going there when there's nobody else except for the cook and his friends. They speak - no, they YELL really loud at each other without considering that the people who are eating at their restaurant would also like to have a nice conversation and hear our own voices. The food is really amazing and I will never deny that, but they should be a bit more considerate of their clients in such a tiny restaurant."}
{"text":"Other than knowing that I love arepas, I didn't know much about Venezuelan food before stopping in for a late lunch on the way home from work - the server made some excellent recommendations, and I went with the Llanero - a steak, tomato, avocado, and grilled cheese \"sandwich\" with arepas serving as the bread. 

Service wasn't quick - but that's because I could see the cooks in the back putting everything together - and it was all worth the wait."}
{"text":"Amazing and authentic venezuelan food. Very nice servers that will try yo adjust to your needs, just need to ask. Good place to go with kids. Only cons is that they are very slow."}
{"text":"Second time's a charm, right? I brought my friend here on a Friday evening(around 5pm) for a meal since I had a positive experience here the first time(it was a take-out). 

Service: It was terrible from start to finish. The place was quiet- there were only 7 other customers(not including two of us), but it took at least 10 min to ask for a menu. The waiter missed some of the items we've ordered. It was just a lot of waiting to ask for stuff.

Food: It was great! Everything that we've ordered came out fresh(cheese fingers, cold sodas, arepas). Thery were all delicious!

My friend had a chat with the manager about the service because she was so not impressed. 

I am not sure if I want to come back to have a sit-down meal after what happened. 

**Price has gone up a bit for some of the items on the menu- e.g. cheese fingers are now $1.95**"}
{"text":"Really good food. Very rich though. Dishes are quite filling and heavy. Have small items if you want to have room for dessert. The place is very friendly and accepting. The waitress explained most of the dishes for us (as we didn't speak any Spanish and the menu was listed in mostly Spanish). Excellent service."}
{"text":"Great Venezuelan food! Specially for arepas!! Take into account that they are all big portions! Tostones are so good! My only issue is that the time that I had empanadas they were too greasy. (Oil in the filling of the empanada)"}
{"text":"The fact that they let us in 30 minutes before closing time makes me love this place. Although we had to rush ourselves to order but thanks to other reviewers, we made the right choice ordering empanadas and arepas. Most of the stuffs I wanted to order is out, but I guess it's normal since it would be closing time soon.
I don't really know how Venezuelan food truly tastes like, to be honest, but the food here at Gordo is AMAZING! The pollo empanadas was made-from-scratch fried corn bread filled with chicken. Tricolour arepas is loaded with chicken, beef, sauteed onions and bell peppers, and shredded cheese. The bread is thick, crispy, and grilled to perfection. These two order is more than enough for a meal. The three sauces come as complimentary with the empanadas and the garlic one is my favorite. 
I've heard from few friends that it is one of the most authentic Venezuelan restaurant here in Toronto. 
Limited seatings, but the staffs are wonderful and friendly. They are quick and very attentive. Definitely coming back here!"}
{"text":"The food is great. The service is absolutely terrible. They take forever to take your order and even longer to deliver the meal. The guy who operates behind the bar is one of the rudest people I've met. 

Tldr; The terrible service removes any form of enjoyment from the meal."}
