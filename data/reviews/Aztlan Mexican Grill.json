{"text":"Aztlan's has the best Mexican food we've had for a long time.  Loved the beef and the chicken chimichangas, and my 'traditional' margarita was excellent.  Service was prompt, friendly and courteous.  We will go back -- and take friends!"}
{"text":"Food had bland flavor. Chicken in fajita had no marinade. Margaritas could have been made better with Quervo and a cheap Walmart margarita mix. Fried ice cream was literally fried corn flakes thrown on top of a scope of vanilla ice cream."}
{"text":"I was very happy to hear that a Mexican restaurant was going into this space, as it's not far from our house & I get a craving for good Mexican every so often.  The start: It was pretty busy when we went, but we got seated right away (good thing too- a line started forming not long after).  Chips & salsa appeared and they were fairly standard but good.  I got a beer, the kids got sodas, and my wife got the house frozen margarita.  It was a big pour but she told me she could hardly taste the tequila.  The food: There was a ceviche appetizer special and I ordered that.  It was ok- fairly bland but unoffensive.  Unfortunately, it came at the exact same time as our meals.  I particularly hate when that happens, as it's so avoidable and it makes eating the app so much less enjoyable. I ordered a beef burrito/relleno combo plate, my wife got a 5 de Mayo burrito, and the kids got kids meals: one with a burrito and the other with tacos.  My meal was disappointingly bland.  I lived in New Mexico and Arizona for years so I know what Mexican (and even Americanized Mexican) should taste like.  It's supposed to feel like a fiesta for your senses.  It's not supposed to be bland.  My wife couldn't finish her burrito so I asked for a bite.  We agreed that it was bland, and it tasted pretty much like my burrito despite the supposed difference in composition.  I asked the kids how they liked their meals; they both said \"it's ok\".  I tasted a bit of my son's burrito, and it was exactly like mine.  Bland.  On the plus-side: the servers were very friendly and attentive.  A girl a few tables over from us was having a birthday and the staff came over to serenade her- which I typically HATE HATE HATE when restaurants do that, but they didn't sing the typical HB song and they made the whole thing actually look fun.  Also, the prices were pretty decent, even with drinks.  Everyone I talk to in Mount Horeb who has been to Aztlan really likes it.  It must be a Midwesterner thing because, while I'm sure I'll end up going back, I won't delude myself into thinking I'll get a fiesta for my senses.  I'll be prepared for a plateful of bland and I'll dump Tapatio all over it.  Update:  I've been back a few time since and have found my go-to item: the carnitas.  Very tasty, with some nice fatty pieces (yes, I'm into that sort of thing).  And the staff really is nice.  Bumping them up to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Portions are big, service is quick, the staff is friendly and the food is solidly good not great.  The owner is also a co-owner of Laredo's in Madison and Cocina Real in Middleton. The menus at all locations are very similar.   I have eaten here three times in recent weeks: enjoying the Vallarta Special. the Carnitas and Enchiladas Campeche. I always order the \"sopa de aztlan\" which has shrimp, rice, and sliced avocados in a spicy broth. (Concina Real has the same thing on their menu under a different name)"}
{"text":"I am visiting Wisconsin from California for a week.  We have amazing Mexican food where I am from and I am very picky about it.  I told myself I wouldn't get Mexican or sushi while I was out here.  Then someone said I had to give this new place Aztlan a chance.  Everything about this place (other than the building itself) is fantastic.  The food was very very good and authentic.  I got the Enchilads Poblanos with mole' sauce. The waitstaff was awesome and spoke Spanish.  Our waiter nailed our complicated 5 person order without writing a single thing down.  The margaritas were large, strong, and not made from ultra sweet pre-made mix.  I will make sure to come here every time I visit Mt. Horeb."}
{"text":"Good Mexican food for a small town. They have special of the day. Monday is the best day to go."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Mexican restaurant since returning to the area.  The food is excellent and the service puts most restaurants to shame.  We were there on a very busy Friday night and were seated pretty quickly and definitely taken care of well.  We went with friends and all found our favorites:  Pollo Aztalan, and combination 15, (todo pollo-and suave) to name two.  The menu will entice us to try some new entrees, too. Miguel and crew have food and hospitality firmly in hand. We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Good, honest food in Mt Horeb (20 mi west of Madison). Dishes feel a little subdued to accommodate broad tastes. Re-fried beans were under seasoned, melted cheese rather than cotija or queso fresco, heat turned down to low on the otherwise tasty salsa. Delicious entree of Enchiladas Sonora, grilled cubed chicken, chopped poblano peppers, and a cream salsa verde with nice citrus flavor."}
{"text":"Been in several times now and had the best authentic Mexican, with great service! Seafood, steak, chicken, or pork... we have each tried several different dishes and have liked them all immensely! Everything prepared per order and all seem to be made with fresh ingredients! Delicious chips and salsa with your meal and we have never left hungry. We'll definitely be back for another plate!   Este restaurante es excelente!!"}
{"text":"We were all very excited when a mexican restaurant was opening in Mount Horeb and this place does not dissappoint.  Everything I have sampled on the menu has been excellent.  The service is quick and very friendly, I have always been seated quickly and they are always righ on top of bringing chips and taking drink orders immediately.  They get busy in the evenings, which is a good sign, but I recommend going at non peak lunch hours. Very reasonable prices, and large portions."}
{"text":"Our group of eight tried Aztlan Mexican Grill for dinner last Saturday night. The restaurant was bright and cheery. They were able to accommodate our group by pushing together tables despite the busy hour. Our server was friendly and prompt. The menu looked pretty standard for many Midwest Mexican restaurants.  The salsa was tasty, but the chips were greasy and extremely brittle. Most were broken in tiny pieces. I ordered the Enchiladas Jalisco. The enchiladas were decent as was the rice, but the beans had a dried mud consistency rather than the creamy texture I usually enjoy.  Although the general experience was fine overall, I was disappointed by both the chips and the beans. If I was in the area, I'd probably go back and give it another try but I won't make a special effort to go there."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything we've ever had here was delicious. Burritos, enchiladas, fajitas, tacos, quesadillas... I ordered some sort of enchilada with smoked chicken and spinach. I don't remember the name of it but my taste buds were dancing.  The salsa they give you is solid. If you're daring, ask for the hot stuff. But definitely don't pass on an order of queso!   Margaritas are good and are nearly 1/2 price on Mondays and Wednesdays!"}
{"text":"If you live in Mount Horeb, there's no longer a reason to head into Madison for Mexican food.  Everything we ordered tasted authentic.  Tamales were fantastic.  Beers cold.  Wait staff fast and friendly.  Go there, it's much better than that taco kit sitting on the self from '08."}
{"text":"Very good Mexican food. If you've been to Laredo's in Madison, you'll know the basic style of the food here. If not, it's still good food and we're definitely pleased that a Mexican restaurant has opened in Mount Horeb.    We had chicken burritos ... very yummy and large! They're in 12\" shells, so there's a LOT of burrito for a meal. We just had the complementary chips and somewhat spicy salsa, the burrito and called it quits as we couldn't have eaten anymore.   The wait staff had been distracted by a soccer game on the TV when we first arrived, but the staff once we were seated was fast and always kept our drinks full. The food came hot.  We'll go back."}
{"text":"This place was a find. We stopped for a late lunch while driving through town, having seen an ad in a local publication. My husband had the \"chorripollo,\" chicken with chorizo, and said that while he though it would have more sauce than it did, it nevertheless was tasty; with the usual rice and beans on the side.  I had guacamole (shared with my husband), freshly made and delicious,  and a superb margarita.  Also 2 chimichangas, one beef one chicken, which came with rice and beans.  When we arrived late afternoon we were the only patrons, but that quickly changed.  Service was friendly and attentive without being intrusive.  Air conditioned too, but not to the sub-freezing level, which was very nice.  I could not imagine that we were so lucky as to find such authentic, delicious Mexican food in the middle of Wisconsin!  It was a delicious experience.  Wish we had one in Alexandria, VA!"}
{"text":"It's nice that they bring salsa and chips right away when you sit down.  Chips are fresh however the salsa is a little watered down.  They took our order pretty fast, however if your in a group of 6 or more it takes a while to get your food.  I got the fajitas which were amazing, however they only gave me three tortillas.  Only complaint I have, once the food came out the waitress seem to stop coming to our table.  That made it difficult to order more tortillas.  All and all an average experience."}
{"text":"I generally have a rule-of-thumb to avoid ethnic restaurants in suburban areas... but this place crushes that rule!  The food is good, fast, and cheap, and there's even a patio where you can sit outside and sip margaritas, while munching on table side guacamole.  De-lish!"}
{"text":"This is the same bland, inoffensive, Americanized Mexican food that you find nearly everywhere.  5 or 6 basic ingredients disguised as 40 different dishes.  If you like Laredos, then this place is right up your alley.  It will just cost you an extra buck or two per plate vs similar spots in Madison. I tried the carnitas.  They were dry and underseasoned, but edible under a sizable dollop of salsa.  Wouldn't recommend. The chips that come with the salsa were clearly not homemade.  That's just a big no-no and starts the meal off on the wrong foot for me. Service was prompt and friendly, which earns them an extra star.  The food was a two, the service a four, we'll take the average and give it a three...yup a very average three seems about right."}
{"text":"Stopped here to fulfill a Mexican craving. My husband had a great tamale and I had the Fajita Sonora which was ok but I think I prefer regular fajitas. Would stop again if in the area."}
{"text":"Very bland food! We waited for a table and the manager offered us Margarita's nice, Yeah! We were charged 7.95 for watered down drinks once the bill came! Once seated we had to ask for a server. The manager was working hard but the staff seemed very disinterested and unorganized. My husband's plate came swimming in water. My plate had no flavor other than Ragu. We both came home feeling ill. This will not be our new Mexican restaurant and we will not go back!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite small town restaurant now. I no longer have to drive to Madison when I'm craving some Mexican food. They have a nice authentic feel and their food is amazing. I have never been disappointed coming here. The staff is friendly and the service is good. If you're in Mount Horeb and looking for food, this would be the place to go."}
{"text":"Always enjoy my food whenever we visit here. Great service. Super friendly. Excellent margaritas and tacos."}
{"text":"I need a place to get Mexican food. This is it. Everything we had was excellent. I had a gastric issue with something but it won't stop me from going again. The margaritas were good enough to make me wish it wasn't 16 miles from home. Nice people. Go there."}
{"text":"Very good food, sizable portions, excellent flavors! Good service and quick to get food to the table. My 6 year old daughter even loved it. Would come back for sure!"}
{"text":"So you walk in the front door and it SMELLS like heaven.  The restaurant looks great and the wait staff greeted us, I mean like 2 or three of them within 2 seconds of walking in. They were so so friendly and the food! Oh my gosh the food was the best Mexican food I have EVER had. Definitely try the queso with your chips!!"}
{"text":"This is my daughter's favorite restaurant so that gives it a half star extra.  I would go 3.5 myself.  This is typical Wisconsin Mexican Restaurant fare, pretty fresh ingredients, a bit more grease than I think real Mexican food would have.  We love their bean dip to start and they make pretty good burritos and tacos.  The enchiladas are not quite up to par, the flavor is a bit bland on the sauces I've tried and I've tried these multiple times.  I would like to have sauces that have different flavors instead of just different colors, they are not bad but not packed with a lot of punch.  Although that may be why the girls like the place, not too over the top.    In Mt. Horeb this is as good as a restaurant gets (I'm not including Sjolinds in this club as they are more than a restaurant imho and any time you are in town you should go there), I'm still waiting for a good old supper club to come to town."}
{"text":"Recommend the onion cheese enchiladas. Guacamole and fajitas. Continue oast Duluth Fisher King Winery and get Mexican food. Then some wine at Fisher King. Good times in Mount Horeb,Wisconsin"}
{"text":"Great service, recommended by a local as a quality place and it did not disappoint.  Very tasty horchata, good retried beans, and very nice chips and salsa. Ingredients were fresh, tasty, and served very quickly at lunch. Overall unexpectedly good experience was had here."}
