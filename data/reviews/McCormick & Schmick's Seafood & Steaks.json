{"text":"If you are visiting \"uptown\" Charlotte and you like more of an upscale bar/restaurant atmosphere then you need to land in this place.  Try the Bluepoint raw oysters or tuna tartare for starters.  Then go with a steak.  I mean it's a steak restaurant after all.  Oh, full menu food service is available til 11:00pm, which is convenient.

I do think they do not need to ask for a credit card at the bar prior to providing service based on the socioeconomic profile of the restaurants patrons.  It's dilutive to the overall experience."}
{"text":"Is it my imagination or did this restaurant used to be better? Drinks were made wrong and took 20min to get to us. Food was also cold by the time it made its way to our table. Severely disappointed. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"10-18-2013
Bar drinks were so so. No more fresh juice. 
Oysters where lousy even though this is the season. 
Dinning was lousy. Finally fixed the chairs after ten years, but F & B Manager is an ass. He was rude when asked, where the previous manger was. He said I don't know. I don't know who is was . I Ordered Fish & Chips the fish was nasty and smelled lousy. It sure was not Cod or Halibut. We were celebrating company tenure and this was not a good experience. We did get to see a very good friend, and she said she looked Yelp and the reviews were terrible. Now that I looked I agree. I we have been coming here since 1995, but this is the end. To many good fish houses in Las Vegas to put up with this crap. 
NOTE:
The prices are way out of line. 
FRIDAY night 2130 three tables being used, NO ONE in the bar. SAD"}
{"text":"If you are looking for mediocre food and terrible service, this is the place. I am pretty sure I saw a cockroach in the dining room. It was moving fast."}
{"text":"I enjoy coming here every Wednesday for their happy hour cocktails and dollar oysters.  Being from the Northwest, I'm always skeptical of the shellfish quality in land lock states such as Nevada but these oysters have yet to let me down!"}
{"text":"Great meal every time I visit. Awesome service from the entire staff. Most importantly real seafood not some Red Lob**** type of stuff. Ambiance is also very welcoming."}
{"text":"We had dinner on 10/22/12 because the the Steak and Lobster special.  The special does not come with anything, except for a tomato.  When we asked if we could substitute the tomato for another vegetable the waiter told us we could not substitute it, but said he could ask to find out.  After he rambled the reasons for not allowing substitions, but would check he then changed his answer to no we could not have one.  When the dinner came out, there was only steak and lobster on the plate and not even the tomato he advised us about, which could not be substituted.  He never returned during our dinner so that we could ask what happened.      He eventually came back to our table and we told him about the missing tomato.  He said he would talk to the chef.  Our plates were completely cleared, when the chef came out with a plate of tomatoes.  We were shocked and insulted, since we had already finished our meals. As far as the steak is concerned, they give you about a half of steak, already cut in slices.  The lobster was on the small side too. Not only was the dinner disappointing, the service was slow and I had to beg for refills for my water.  This is my second experience at this place in 2 months and both times the service was slow and the food was slightly warm and did not taste good."}
{"text":"We ordered the steak and lobster entr√©e. The meal was pretty decent but left a lot to be desired in regards to portion size, especially considering the price.  The size of the lobster tail was very disappointing, and not at all what we expected after our conversation with the server.  Our server, was not as attentive as we would have liked, and she didn't remove the lobster bisque that she recommended to  my husband and he ended up not liking it. It was a total waste of $14.00.   Overall it was \"OK\" but not for us, so we will not be returning.  In the end I regretted not choosing a different option for surf n turf."}
{"text":"Needed last minute (48 hours prior) reservations for Christmas Day.  Phoned SouthPark location first.  Melissa went above and beyond with regard to customer service.  When she did not have availability, she offered to phone the Uptown location.  I was on hold for less than two minutes when she came back with:  a.)  my reservation at my preferred time and b.)  news that the location was handicapped accessible.  I appreciated that service was from the regular menu rather than buffet (an issue for my guest in a wheel chair) and food was good.  One suggestion for improvement would be that, if you see a guest pushing a wheelchair toward the one manual door, might have been nice for someone to offer to hold the door.  The valet did earn major brownie points and a bump in his tip, when he offered to fold the chair and put it in the vehicle for me upon departing.  Valet parking is free but please be sure to tip!  Overall, grateful that a full staff of very professional people had agreed to work on Christmas Day for our benefit.  Will go back."}
{"text":"Easily made a reservation on line. Excellent ambience. Wait staf was courteous and helpful. Our waitress (Roxanne) recommended the crab dip as an appetizer. It was delicious. We had caesar salads and the steak and lobster tail. The salad was fresh and crisp. Our steaks were cooked to our specifications and the meai was very tasty. 
An excellent experience."}

Kid is caring on and yelling sitting on top of the bar! Evidently the bartender knew them. I Complained to manager. He couldn't have cared less. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the best part of the meal was the chopped salad. And that only took 30 minutes to get. Did I mention it took almost 20 minutes for a refill on my drink? Ordered a $50 steak MR. It was cooked perfectly but there was no flavor ...... at all. Probably the worst steak I have ever eaten.  It was just down right gross. My boyfriend ordered the Chilean Seabass, flavor was savory but the size of a child's palm... and not a big child either just FYI. And for the cost of $40... just no. Sigh. Truly disappointed. And I love steak houses. I don't mind spending the money, but when service was horrible and your $50 steak tastes like you pan seared it yourself at home.... ehhh, I'm good. The only thing that made the dinner any good was the company I was with and I had a gift card.

I rated this spot two stars....
1. The chopped salad. And 2. The timely manner in which the payment was processed.
I will not be returning."}

{"text":"McCormick and Schmick's started out as a seafood restaurant in Portland, Oregon.  Now it's a chain based out of Texas.  Texans don't know seafood all that well, but they do understand salt.

In Las Vegas, McCormick and Schmick's has remained one of the places for business lunches because the service is great and the ambience is clubby and quiet.  The food won't take your attention away from your lunch companions."}
{"text":"My wife and I visit M&S almost every time we do a Vegas trip to get away from the casino buffets and other strip non-sense. We find M&S as a nice off strip cozy get away to spend a nice quiet dinner for two.

We start with the Mixed Greens with Bleu Cheese and Walnuts. Then we had the seafood grilled trio on couscous and tilapia, parmesan crusted and served with lemon butter and capers, my favorite! The only minus according to my wife, was the over-grilled shrimp. We ended the night with a mini birthday dessert, compliments of M&S. [See pictures]

We usually get our famous senior staff waiter that seems to really enjoy his work so we usually tip him nicely. We hope to be back for the King Crab legs when the season is right.

{"text":"EDIT: I've updated my review with what I filled into the customer feedback form:

When we got there our party was seated and we were told someone would be over to take our order. After sitting at our table for 30 minutes a server came over and gave us water. He told us he would be back to take our order. We were talking about leaving 10 minutes later and he showed up to take our drink order (he specifically said he was there for drinks). I requested he take our entire order due to the length in time we had been there. When our waiter took our order every person had to repeat it three times. It was like he wasn't paying attention at all. For example, when my friend ordered he said \"I'd like the 6oz. Filet Mignon.\"  The waiter responded \"The Rib Eye?\". \"No, the 6oz. Filet Mignon.\" \"OK and what size would you like?\" This happened for every single order. After our order was placed we then waited close to an hour for our food to come up. When it showed up you could tell that it had been sitting under heat lamps for an extended period of time. None of us dared to complain because we didn't want to wait another hour for our food to be corrected. The steak especially looked dry and this was confirmed by my friend.  

Just so you know we decided to pass on a bottle of wine we were going to purchase and dessert because of our experience at your Las Vegas location. We did this because we didn't want to have to wait more than we already did and didn't want to feel like we had to tip our waiter more money than necessary. What I'm getting at is we were willing to spend more money at your restaurant, but we decided against it due to bad service.

My wife and I enjoy eating at McCormick and Schmick's in our city. We've eaten at several of your different locations and have always had a positive experience. However, this was not one of those times and will make us rethink our dinner options in the future."}
{"text":"The food: fine but not amazing. The calamari was lightly breaded, giving it a subtle flavor and crunchy texture. My almond crusted trout was buttery and just barely underseasoned. The accompanying orzo was dry but tasty. My girlfriend's fish and chips were too salty -- we couldn't finish the fish.

The service: our waitress was nice and checked in frequently, but the food took a long time. 

The ambiance: quiet, peaceful, about what you'd expect of a McCormick and Schmick's.

Overall, a decent dining experience, but I wouldn't go back if I were to revisit Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Went there Friday night. Restaurant side wasn't very busy. Service was terrible. Our waiter had to be asked to remove the extra place settings since there were only two of us dining. We ordered drinks and had to call him back to order an appetizer. Once our glasses were empty a manager took them away.We get bread and no bread plates or silverware (it was taken along with our appetizer plates). Food was only OK, nothing memoriable. We got the three layer carrot cake to take home and there were only two extremely dry layers with no flavor. Skip it! Bill was $100 without the tip and it was not worth it. We won't go back."}
{"text":"Food was a disappointment twice this week.  Chowder was thin, salty, and barely warm.  Salad was nothing special and on the small side given the price.  Parmesan crusted fish was tasty but in a heavy sauce and salty.  The best part of meal were the green beans and coconut rice."}

{"text":"This is our traditional birthday celebration go-to place for great food and wonderful service...but lunch this Saturday was awful! Food took forever, as well as our appetizer of 4 oysters (how long does it take to shuck an oyster? Evidently 30 minutes) The manager did pay for the appetizer but our entrees then took another 25 minutes....
Usually they offer free dessert for a birthday, and this waiter couldn't get us out fast enough. He also never refilled our drinks.
Going to Brio's next time!"}
{"text":"My party of four had dinner last night and had a fabulous meal and exceptional service. My scallops were some of the best I've ever had. Our server was fantastic - just the right amount of attention and leaving us to enjoy our evening. I was surprised to see how few folks were eating there. This restaurant is definitely one I'll go to again."}
{"text":"The Mr. and Mrs. have eaten at the McC & Schm in Bridgewater, NJ, with family.  The Mr. enjoyed his meal at that locale.  The Mrs. does not remember what she ate, but probably nothing memorable or out of the ordinary.
Recently when the Mrs. accompanied colleagues to an early lunch at this McC & Schm on South Tryon Street in Charlotte, NC, she was expecting nothing out of the ordinary again.
The Mrs. wanted a meal without any fish or meat, but there were no enticing vegetarian offerings.  So she asked the very nice server if she could have the salmon rigatoni ($14) minus the salmon.  The accommodation could be made.  Nice.
The bowl of rigatoni contained small pieces of asparagus stalks and mushroom shreds. a tiny bit of artichoke, and a very liquid pesto cream sauce (not very pesto-ey tasting).  No problem.  It was more important to enjoy this lunch with the colleagues.
The Mrs. ate only half the bowl of soupy rigatoni, then the nice server boxed up the other half to take back to the office and finish later.
The surprise came when the bill arrived.  There was no price reduction for leaving out the salmon from the dish.  It was full price, without the top-billed salmon.  The server informed no accommodation could be made on the price.  The total bill, including tax and very nice tip, came out to $19.
Upon returning to the office, the Mrs.' very sensitive stomach was unhappy; perhaps it was the cream sauce.  She threw out the uneaten boxed half of this meal.
This lunch of half a bowl of meatless/fishless pasta wound up costing $19.  Way too expensive for an adult-focused fast-food chain-restaurant.
The service was nice, the food not so much.  It was the service which earned it the rating.
NOTE:  This meal was not on a work expense account.
The Mrs. does not think it is worth going back."}
{"text":"The server was not very friendly. She seemed annoyed when we asked for more time to look at the menu. And she seemed unhappy when we didn't order any appetizer or alcoholic drink. I got the stuffed salmon and it was okay. It comes with mashed potatoes, carrots and peas. I couldn't really taste the lobster or crab that was supposed to be stuffed in the salmon. The mashed potato was pretty good though. My friend ordered the New York strip and it was delicious even though the price was a little high and it only came with asparagus and half a grilled tomato. The iced water tastes weird. The server did not ask if I'm finished before taking my plate away. The bread was hard on the outside and it wasn't anything special. We came here on a Sunday night and the restaurant was nearly empty. We ordered creme br√ªl√©e for dessert. The size is surprisingly bigger than we expected. There were mixed berries on top and a mint leaf. The custard was a little soft but overall it was good. The atmosphere of the restaurant is good, with dim lighting and classy plate settings. Overall, we enjoyed our meal but it was not worth the price."}
{"text":"Exceptional restaurant in Charlotte and much better than a lot of the locally owned ones.  Service was outstanding, as was the food.  Here's a rundown of our order.

Starters
Steamed Littleneck Clams--These are fantastic and are bathing in a garlic/herb cream sauce that you will hang onto to sop your bread up with.  Very fresh clams and a decent portion for a starter--about 15 clams.
Raw Oysters--I had a tasting menu of 3 varieties and found the Canadian oysters the best.  My favorite was the Beau Rivage.  Some of the oysters were very undersized and some were oversized.  It would be nice if they evened out the sizes for sharing reasons.

Mains
Blackened Mahi-Mahi...the fish in the dish was fantastic.  The sauce was a bit too much I felt and dominated the fish.  It was a spicy tomato sauce.  Would not order again.  The rice side was also dismal.
Sea Bass-Perfect.  This is the opposite of the mahi mahi because in this dish the fish is the star and not the sauce...although the gremolata butter is subtle and fantastic.  Sides of mash and asparagus and carrots were great.  Truly a great plate of food.

Dessert
Apple Upside Down Pie....fantastic.  Will disappear in less than 5 minutes guaranteed.

This is a really nice restaurant that does most things right.  I look forward to going back and trying more of the menu.  All the ingredients are super fresh and I think I would recommend ordering something that is light on the sauce and stars the fresh seafood."}
{"text":"We came to Charlotte to celebrate my birthday and New Year's Eve. We made reservations for 8 at McCormick & Schmidt. From the moment we arrived we were served with excellence. I had the filet and lobster tail chef special, which came with squash and zucchini. My medium rare steak was perfect!! My husband had the blackened chicken fettuccini with cheddar peppered mashed potatoes. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"One of the best places I've eaten at in Charlotte. We went for Restaurant week and to celebrate my eldest daughter's birthday, the put happy birthday on my daughters menu.  the host Sean was great, knowledgeable, friendly and courteous My daughter had the beef medallions which she loved, My wife had a steak and it was very good and I had the Ahi Tuna that was good but could have been seasoned a little better. .  We had a \"Blue Crab Dip\" starter, that I could not get out of my head! I liked it so much I had to get some ingredients to try to recreate it. close but no cigar.Got to go back again. the creme brulee was so delicious but not enough of it for me.We will be coming back again and again and again.  Go get get some!"}
{"text":"Service, great!! Food, another story. Ordered steak and lobster. Steak, rubbery and cold. Lobster barely warm but decent, potatoes chared to death. Not worth $35."}
{"text":"5 of us went on a Monday evening at about 9:30 pm. Very friendly and efficient service. We were all happy with the quality of our food and it's preparation. I will go back again."}
{"text":"If our waitress was not so nice, and if it was possible, I would have give this restaurant zero stars. We went there for Thanksgiving dinner and we're highly disapointed, not only in the food but in the atmosphere and in the management. Tables were extremely close together, (when my daughter, who is tiny, wanted to use the restroom people at two other tables had to stand to let her get up and then get back to her chair)  it was not decorated for the holidays and the background music was terrible. We try to go to a nice restaurant at least twice a month for dinner and this one was a mistake.
     One of the people in our group of four is a vegetarian.  Before making reservations we called three times to inquire if they would had a vegetarian menu available on Thanksgiving. We spoke to a different person each time. Each time they assured us that they would have many options on the menu. We reserved and when they called to confirm we asked again. Again we were assured that there would be several vegetarian meals available.
     When we were seated and looked over the menu there was not even one meatless entree available. I asked our waitress for the vegetarian options and she informed us that they DID NOT have any available. My first instinct, which I wish I would have followed, was to walk out then and there but there were no  restaurants with last minute reservations. She went to check with the chef. Returning she told us that they could boil some pasta. We told her it was not acceptable for Thanksgiving. She returned to the kitchen and came back to inform us that all aspects of the Thanksgiving menu, with the exception of the mashed potato, had meat products in them. She then offered a Flatbread pizza with vegtables on it. The vegetarian didn't want to cause issues so with disappointment ordered that and a side of mashed potatoes.
     When the food arrived it was very dissapointing. Thanksgiving dinner was salty, presentation was lacking and the Turkey which had too much dry dark meat was not flavorful at all. One person ordered salmon which was good. The vegetarian meal was very marginal especially for Thanksgiving. What we order from our local pizza shop is much better and at least half of the price.
      When the bill arrived it was $160. SO NOT WORTH IT!  We felt like it was money wasted. The small side of mashed potatoes was $6.99! At the very least, they should have comped them or her desert  after four conversations confirming they would have a vegetarian menu. Did they really need reservations so badly that they couldn't be honest?
       Because our waitress tried so hard, and really felt bad about the situation, and because it was a holiday we gave her a generous tip and left NEVER to return again!  We have enjoyed other Landry restaurants but are unlikely to patronize them either. This waitress told us we were members of their reward program and credited what we spent to our reward account. She was the only one to do this after about 12 trips to the Grand Concourse, also owened by the same company. For us, there are too many other better options available than to go to this restaurant.
     Please think twice before eating here, especially on a holiday!"}
{"text":"I have to say... I went here for lunch today and was so disappointed.  My husband and I had been craving some good seafood in our effort to eat healthy, so we decided to splurge and head to M&S on our lunch breaks from our uptown jobs.  I ordered the cedar roasted salmon, and he had one of the small plates (blackened mahi with risotto cake and a side salad).  First, our drinks were never refilled, and at a place like this, you just expect a certain level of service for the money you're paying.  Then, my husband's salad came with the meal although he asked for it first.  His entree just tasted off... like fish wasn't fresh, and risotto cake was like a brick.  It took forever to settle up with the bill, which was $58 before tip.  Ouch.  I'm fine paying for good food and service, but when things go awry, it's an awfully hard tab to pay.  I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great service. 3 good meals: steak, prawns, and shrimp.  However, my flounder was tiny and so overcooked that I had to cut it with a knife. I didn't want to make a scene but I sure won't ever order that again. 5 stars for Andrea, our waitress. Again (my bad) for not speaking up at the time."}
{"text":"In town on business and was happy to walk from my hotel. Solo so dinner at the bar. Caught happy hour and a deal on blue moon. Had a bowl of the crab soup, thank goodness it was spiced properly as I was not offered salt, pepper or even a napkin!  The soup was lukewarm not hot as expected on this 20 degree night. The crab cakes came after quite a while, had to ask for bread, silverware and water.....the plate was hot but the food was not.....so bad for a spot that had a great reputation for service and good food"}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was the food. Otherwise terrible service, waiters and management that makes you feel unwelcome here. Because of it it's not worth your money. I guess they're not very interested in keeping their clients. There's plenty of great places to eat where customer service is on the high level as well."}
{"text":"Had Thanksgiving Dinner today and my wife had one of their fish specialities. Both were excellent and our server, Leandrea provided outstanding service.
What really impressed us was the gracious way the manager handled a mishap at a neighboring table. Very impressive and making us sure to return.  Kudo's to the staff at this restaurant."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 8:15 on V day. Showed at 8:05, waited for than one hour for the table. I don't run a restaurant business so I don't know how things work, but I do hope they have a better control of timing. I am ok with 20 minutes or even half an hour, but an hour is just too much.
I did enjoy the food and our waiter was nice. Maybe on a regular day it will be much better of an experience."}
{"text":"awesome service in bar area...macaroni and cheese is tdf!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for seafood!  One thing that you can count on here is consistently good seafood and a variety of it.
This location is no exception! The service as always is excellent!
Though the prices are a little higher than other \"American \" style restaurants; you are getting what you paid for good food and good food for you! Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Teeny tiny portions.  You need to fill up on the bread because there's no fish on the plate they bring you.  Too pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Three of us went there for Christmas dinner because we were flying back home to Charlotte on Christmas day and didn't have time to cook.  We had reservations and we were seated about on time. They were busy, but not insanely so.  

We sat in Steven's section and it should have been an omen that I heard a woman complaining about his service before we sat down.  He took our drink and appetizer order and then disappeared.  He checked in about 10 minutes later as our drink order had \"slipped his mind\".   We had calamari and mussels which arrived without any appetizer plates or little forks or bowl for empty shells for the mussels.  It was all tasteless...that's the only word to describe it.  No seasoning, no reason to eat it.  

We had ordered our meals before the appetizers arrived but the waiter forgot what we ordered and had to come and ask us again.  After about 30 minutes, he checked in again saying \"part of the food was up...and what was it we had again?\" Oh boy!  Well we got served about 15-20 minutes later so about 45 minutes after we finished appetizers.  I had the mahi-mahi special which at $33 was no bargain.  The portion size was tiny, the fish luke-warm and severely over cooked and burnt on one side. It was so tough I had to take a drink of water to get it down.  Obviously my food had been under the warming lamp long before everyone else's had started.    My husband's sea bass was average and my son's shrimp was pretty good...but, the pacing was so awful the meal was already ruined.  The waiter disappeared again and we finally flagged him down to get our check.  I was looking forward to dessert and coffee but didn't have an extra hour to spare for him to forget it...then bring it...then disappear again.  All in all the meal was very boring, uninspired and served by someone who should never have been allowed on the floor.   He wasn't rude, he just didn't care and didn't seem to know what he was doing.   Won't be going back!"}
{"text":"I visited on a business trip with a group, my steak was ok, a little underdone, but I ate it. My colleague's meals were undercooked, and when they complained, the waiter tried to tell them that the steaks were supposed to be that way, and he even took the steaks back and returned with the same steaks, stating that the chef said that the steaks were supposed to be that way!!  undercooked.  The guy who arranged the dinner meeting begrudgingly paid, and everyone went out for a cheap burger.  Looking back, its no wonder that the company that arranged the meal (the guy who paid) went out of business.   never been to a M&S since.  there are way better places like lawreys."}
{"text":"A restaurant that needs to get its act together. Shrimp kisses were great. However the kitchen struggled to have entrees match what the menu described. The coffee machine didn't work. And what was served was cold. Staff brought out inappropriate eating utensils with the beverages and dessert."}
{"text":"I usually love raving about good places to eat uptown, but this isn't one of those. I tried this place twice. Once for lunch and once over Christmas for dinner. Both times the food was cold and overpriced. Our waitress was having a hard time getting our order in and our drinks out due to the crowd. I swear the place over booked. It wasn't her fault. I think going forward, unless it's half price apps at happy hour, I'll be headed somewhere better."}
{"text":"I think not!!!  No one got sick-thank god.  But ripped-off we were.. spent almost $600.00 for a party of nine .

I would not recommend unless the meal is pre-set.--  waiters are trained to go around the table and try too up the order."}
{"text":"Just ate late night happy hour food here. It was maybe the worst food I have had at a restaurant. The fish tacos tasted like Lysol and cardboard, they were absolutely disgusting. I love a good fish taco and these made me want to cry. The potato skins were meh but kind of bland and the quesadilla was just plain odd. The only decent thing we had was the hummus but the \"pita chips\" ruined it too. They were soggy and greasy. Just save yourself the stomach ache and skip this one."}
{"text":"The issue is not the food it's the customer service.  

You can't beat the happy hour food prices.  If you are hungry you can eat for $10 or under.  There aren't any real good drink specials so expect to pay regular prices.  

Now back to the customer service.  Like many people have posted the waiter/waitresses/bartenders ignore you.  And why wasn't I offered a glass of water with my drink.  I had three drinks while there and my friend had two glasses of wine.  No water was offered.  Initially the waitress came over because I was looking around the room in shock because it wasn't busy.  My face said everything.   Nearly 10 minutes before someone  approached us.  They really need to work on their customer service."}
{"text":"Just went to happy hr today and got a new waitress she gave the worst service and when I complained to the manager he sided with her without even offering an apology with so many places uptown to enjoy happy hr,i will never go there again"}
{"text":"Went for restaurant week and had a terrible experience, the only reason I am giving two stars is because the food was good. The waitress was terrible and condescending. 

We started out ordering drinks and she got us all waters but said I will get your other drinks when your food arrives. Who does that?

We were never given bread like every other table was until we asked. Every time we asked for bread she just said, \"It is in the oven\" then it took forever.

She brought out our first course and got 3 of the 6 wrong. She tried to blame it on how we ordered it. I thought the customer was always right? Not in this case clearly.

The food was good and I am glad we went on restaurant week because I would have never paid full price for that meal with that service."}
{"text":"So confused...... this place is good, maybe even ridiculously good, and yet, the restaurant was empty.  

I went with a few co-workers for lunch at 12 noon and there was only one other visible party in the entire restaurant.  It's easy to get to, the parking is plentiful, it's surrounded by office parks (ie business men and women looking for a quick but decent lunch or wanting to entertain clients), it's next to Southpark mall, the service is consistently good, the food is great, and the lunch prices are reasonable.  Any ideas?  Anyone?  Bueller?

Anyway, they have a non-printed lunch menu that's updated frequently in addition to the standard fare items.  Obviously known for their fish and seafood, but I went with a buffalo chicken salad this visit and I wasn't disappointed with my choice.  My coworkers loved the bisque, blackened shrimp quesadillas, kobe burger, and salmon.

Hope this place survives."}
{"text":"Not too bad.  Thank goodness I had my restaurant.com coupon!  I probably won't go back unless I had another coupon."}
{"text":"A Happy Hour Gem!
I came down here to catch their Happy Hour on a Monday night before heading to a movie. What a selection they have for both food and drinks, all at great prices. 

To start off with we had the spinach dip and potato skins. The multi-color chips were plentiful and complimentary to the dip that was both creamy and cheesy. Yum. Could have passed on the potato skins; even though they had a bit of cheese and bacon on them and a sprinkling of scallions, the only flavor that stood out were the potato and scallions. Still, a bargain at two bucks for 2. 

I also had the $2.95 cheeseburger. Pretty decent size ( a half pounder) and well cooked as long as I order it a temp below my desired temperature to compensate for overcooking. 

The beef confit sliders were tasty and tender but slathered with too much of their 'asian BBQ sauce'. Next time I will be sure to get it on the side. 

Lastly the salmon cakes were really fishy tasting. No apple or fennel flavors as described on the menu, so that was kind of disappointing. 

While I didn't order any drinks from their happy hour drink list, they had 3 different wine selections, 2 cocktails and 1 Blue Moon Seasonal draft selection. I applaud it merely for the variety of drink options.  

I have yet to try anything on their dinner menu, but I am looking forward to doing it soon :)"}
{"text":"Last Sunday, my in-laws, wife and I had another great dinner experience at McCormick & Schmick's!

We were promptly seated by our hostess and our waitress soon followed. She took our drink orders and told us what the daily specials were.

Our orders consisted of bourbon glazed salmon with green beans and white cheddar mashed potatoes, fried oysters with chesapeake fries & cole slaw and Idaho rainbow trout with grilled asparagus and white cheddar mashed potatoes. The meals arrived quickly and served piping hot. However, the rainbow trout did not taste fresh and our waitress immediately apologize and offered the menu to make another selection. Buttermilk fried shrimp with chesapeake fries & cole slaw was the selected replacement. It also arrived quickly and served piping hot. The manager came to our table and she apologize for the taste of the trout and offered desserts on the house. We all declined and thanked her and the waitress for their great customer service.

Again, our waitress was excellent and the food was great!"}
{"text":"I'm tired of being served overpriced, poor quality, poorly cooked food and paying exorbitant prices. The baked stuffed shrimp were most likely delivered frozen from some cafeteria/food service provider - not prepared in house.  The filet mignon was no different from the quality of steak you get at Walmart,  and the vegetables were anemic/tasteless for $39.00.  Oh, and my wife ordered fish and chips that were soggy to the tune of $19.00. What a joke.  90% of restaurants shouldn't be in business.  I can outcook all of these places. Recommendation: Save your money, Google the recipes and cook them better yourself."}
{"text":"Out of everything I ordered; chef's recommendation of  halibut, apple walnut pie, even Kendal Jackson reserve.  George our server was outstanding.  Probably not highest on the list to return."}
{"text":"Totally disappointed in the service and food.  Arrived there on Friday night for \"bar food\".  Our waitress did not even have a clue what was on that menu nor did she know what wine was poured by the glass.  She misinformed us that a certain wine was available by the glass only to return and state it was only available by the bottle.  To make matters worse, the wine we wanted to order (we are aware of the retail price) was almost 4 times what you would pay retail.  That is too much of a mark-up for any restaurant!  We had to hunt her down for our checks and even then she did not get the correct items on the correct checks.  

The corned beef sliders came with one small slice of corned beef on a bun which overpowered the meat.  Thankfully, you got three sliders per order so you could move the corned beef from the remaining two sliders to produce a slider that was edible.  Too many other places in Uptown to spend money for palatable food and knowledgeable wait staff."}
{"text":"Overpriced$$$$ The mussels were fishy tasting, not fresh. Yuck Yuck Yuck In Vegas there are so many food options I wouldn't make this one period. Save your money people."}
{"text":"Outstanding service!!  Second bottle of wine not so good no problem replaced right away.  And I hate saying anything. When I go out to eat I like to have fun and so did our waiter. You don't see that so often. He was the best!(Jared). I would highly recommend coming here!!!"}
{"text":"Well, what can I say,, I had a poor expereince at McCorkicks in Sacremento and thought I would given them a go again in Las Vegas, I had the stuffed shrimp which were so small you could but them in ANY supermarket for a few dollars for 12, this dish was $25 and the portion was, wait for it not even 6 BUT 5 to a portion and small at that... I was not looking for a large portion but more so quality. this was a waste of money but even greater a waste of my time,, sad"}
{"text":"Nothing special steak and seafood place located off the strip yet with strip prices.

They have a decent happy hour, and I believe that they have a late night happy hour too, but I'm not sure about that.  I think the happy hour was actually better than the sit down dinner I had there.

I had the calamari appetizer, and the calamari was fine, not overdone but kind of over breaded in my opinion, and I was not a fan of the marinara they served on the side with it.  The fillet of sole that I had for dinner was completely overwhelmed by the burre blanc that was served with it, and they over-salted the spinach that was served with it."}
{"text":"Top notch restaurant!  Had dinner her to cap off my birthday in the queen city two weeks ago.  Service was fast, polite, and informative.  Food was delicious.  I had the stuff shrimp.  If you are at South Park Mall, I recommend visiting.  Ask for Quay she's GREAT!"}
{"text":"We went to Mckormick and Shmick's for lunch while in Las Vegas. The facility is very nice, well designed and the patio is pleasant on a nice day. The service was sub par and the food was not worth the price. I had the  sizzling fish tacos that consisted of overcooked Tilapia and flavorless veggies. I did not get a refill on my ice tea the entire visit. Overall overpriced average food and poor service."}
{"text":"One of the top two or three restaurants in town for seafood, as far as I'm concerned.  Better than Upstream or Blue, both in food and (I think) in price.

Fresh seafood daily, menus updated daily.  Servers are attentive, happy to make suggestions.  There is a soup with a tomato base and crab in it that is positively delicious (the best soup at a restaurant I can think of in Charlotte, off the top of my head).

The place is a little pricey (it's probably between $$ and $$$).  This location can be pretty noisy as it's very open; the downtown location may be a little more quiet, but don't count on it."}
{"text":"M&S used to be a good fresh seafood restaurant in a prime uptown location but this place has changed drastically. I hate leaving a restaurant feeling like I flushed money down the drain but that is exactly what happened today. 

Today the service is horrendously slow and the food disgusting. The employees are working hard doing nothing. Hiding in the back ignoring the customers sitting there waiting and waiting... The food isn't fresh or cooked to order. It's all heated in a microwave, rubbery, cold crap. We had one of the worst dining experiences ever. Seems like  employees are purposely sabotaging this place. 

We will never go back. We will wait for the next restaurant as I'm sure this place will be gone soon."}
{"text":"This is my first time visiting the restaurant for brunch.  The food was excellent.  However, when I ordered the cranberry juice it was a bit watered down and the waitress was kind enough to replace with a coke.  The silverware wasn't clean and the peach cobbler was simply a bowl of just five peaches.  I really wasn't expecting this and asked the waitress to remove the peach cobbler from the bill.  The waitress (Chemine) was absolutely amazing!!! However, my overall experience was just ok...I will visit again but definitely a different location and hopefully they will get 5 stars.."}
{"text":"This place has got to go.
Service..poor
Food...poor
Cleanliness...poor
Prices...high
Value....Never going back, ever.
You would do better going to Capt D's"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 8 or 10 times over several years. It just keeps getting worse. Tonight my daughter had a piece of glass in her entree. I won't be going back.
Service is always great.
But glass in the food? Forget it."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, the portions are small, the service was slow. I ordered the NY strip and stuffed shrimp. The steak looked like a petite lunch portion. It was cooked perfectly (it's hard to cook a piece of meat that small correctly), also all three (yes three) of the stuffed shrimp were quite tasty. My girlfriend liked the shrimp trilogy, but  we found the side veggies overcooked and bland (HINT: a pinch garlic and a dash of salt will work wonders guys).

I will go back and try some of the appetizers and soups, but I left the place disappointed and still hungry for a steak. Places like this are exactly why I learned to cook a steak at home."}
{"text":"This was not our first time but it will be our last.  Drinks were fine, we were not offered bread. Two meals turned out ok but the 3rd was steak and it was ordered medium well. It was a charred, hard knot. We sent it back after the other two were finished with their dinner the third received the remade steak and it was RARE. Mind you it took 35 minutes to make a rare steak. When we received the bill, it had the steak on and off not once but twice, both with notations that the customer didn't like it. Hmmm, nothing about not making it right but blame the customer? Me thinks NOT.  We waited and waited and it was a week night, business dinner. We will not  be going back."}
{"text":"For a high end restaurant my experience was terrible. Made a reservation a week in advance and they were far from ready when we arrived. It took about 20 min past the reservation time to seat us. Another 15 for the server to get back to the table. And over an hour for food to arrive. The appetizer was good, but the main course did not wow me at all after all the hype. The desert on the other hand was great and is the redeeming quality that changed the review from a 1 to a 2"}
{"text":"OMG- why would a high end place not have an adequate air conditioning system. It was so incredibly hot inside it was not enjoyable. Ridiculous!!  I have no idea how the servers don't pass out."}
{"text":"Wife and I had our new years eve dinner here, it's one of our favorite seafood restaurants in town .    
  I ordered the crab tower and steamed mussels , crab bisque and a beet salad . 
   Crab tower: crab , avocado and mango intresting combo with a balsamic reduction drizzle . Intresting combination it worked for me .
Steamed mussels in Thai curry sauce: nice size portions.  Light on curry flavor but still very good.
 
Crab bisque: they bring it to the table in a nice sized bowl with about 3 -4 oz crab meat sitting in the middle of the bowl, on a tawny port reduction then the waiter pours the soup around the crab meat very dramatic . The bisque had a  tomato/crab and cream flavor it also had some rice in it that gave it an intresting texture that I liked .

Beet salad : wife luvs beets so I had to order it:  fresh beets , goat cheese and balsamic reduction =  simple salad BIG flavors.

Entrees : we both had the holiday mixed grill. The plate was divided into thirds :
Grilled shrimp and scallop with rosemary skewer simply but tasty
 Filet Oscar : 4 oz filet mignon with crab meat on a bed of potato roseti , filet was cooked perfect med rare and potato was a fancy hash brown cake both very good . 
Grilled salmon on a bed of spinach completed the trio. Salmon cooked perfectly on a bed of sauteed spinach
  I also ordered a side of truffle mac n cheese just sounded so good . Very disappointing to me , the dish was to runny and not cheesy enough.
 desserts: chocolate trio, choco tart, choco ganache cake with rasberry sauce and walnut brownie with carmalized banana an vanilla ice cream.
   Wife had a sangria , glass of wine and hot tea 
 Me jus ice tea an tap water. 
     I think I got it all :) , I know lots of food but everything looked so good and if u know me I'm a foodie .  I know our waiter Karl was impressed. 
   We love this place because the food and service are always top notch.  The restaurant itself is classy looking without the snobbery. The $ value is exceptional for example all the food and drinks came out to be $155 plus tip $188. . I mean read again all the food we ordered  I think it's a good deal it's not cheap, but for us a special ocasion restaurant , maybe for some of you lucky folks an everyday place.lol"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would.
Had 6:45 reservations... just left at 10pm after having terrible, slow service, not receiving multiple items/drinks we had ordered, and receiving 3 bills, all of different amounts. The manager finally had to come correct the bill and apologized. (But obviously didn't feel too sorry as there was no additional discount on our check) Servers never checked on us between taking orders and when food was brought or after food was brought. My sister in laws card was charged twice... which she was ensured would be voided from her account before the nights end, what a nightmare. So much for a nice night. Will not be returning.
*****In an update from last night, my sister in laws card was not charged twice, but THREE TIMES!!!! None of them being voided out. NICE JOB McCormick and Schmick's! Great customer service!*****"}
{"text":"Fish & chips were fantastic. Plenty of fish - cod, in case you were wondering. Certainly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Oh so much disappointment. This is for both South Park and Uptown locations. Let me add Im a club member and have frequented this chain in other states with much better service. 
A simply arugula salad w shrimp was overcooked and took almost 30 minutes to get to me. 
I spent THREE hours at the South Park location (unwillingly) waiting for my and two others birthday celebrations. the not-even-melted Brie appetizer was served at room temperature french bread (this was supposed to be toasted) with over-cooked shrimp. All FIVE meals were served at varying degrees of room temperature, over cooked or the plate was burning hot from being under the heat lamp for too long. Did I mention how loooong it took for this inedible food to get to us?? I gave up keeping track of time after 45 minutes. After the manager was involved in this beyond frustrating \"meal\" she comped the desserts we had already intended on getting (birthdays) but never came back to check on us. Did I also mention they botched a lobster tail TWICE? 
(Feel free to  check my other reviews and you'll see I'm fair with my reviews, this is not the rant of a bratty diner who wanted something for free - both visits were just That Bad!)"}
{"text":"M&S is a chain place, so consistency is what I expect. This place was consistent, with good food quality. That was the expectation, so three stars sounds about right. The positives: The food was very good, fresh, and perfectly prepared. Nothing earth-shattering, just good seafood. The negatives: There are too many tables packed into this restaurant. At any given time, you are sitting less than 2' away from another person. It's almost impossible to walk through the restaurant without making the difficult decision posed in Fight Club: ass or crotch."}
{"text":"Took a party of nine out eat at McCormick and Schmidt on a Friday night about 8 o'clock. We walked in and the place was nearly empty. Should've been some kind of a sign. We get seated, order drinks.  10 minutes later we get water and bread and order appetizers. 10 minutes later our drinks finally arrive. 10 minutes later spoke with the manager.  With the help of another waiter we were finally able to order our meals. Shortly after that our appetizers finally arrive. Calamari was chewy and improperly prepared. Received our entr√©es in about 20 minutes. Some enjoyed their meal,  others had to be returned because of undercooked meat. Returned after re-cooking,  meat still was improperly cooked. No one's water glasses were ever refilled.  No one was asked for another drink. Had to ask waiter for additional bread.
If this review sounds choppy, that's exactly how our experience went,  not very smooth.   It was very inconsistent throughout the dining experience. Needless to say I was underwhelmed by almost everything. I will never go there again."}
{"text":"I ordered the Kobe burger and was very dissatisfied. It did taste alright but the burger was under cooked. The two people I had with me had a hair in their food and the manager had horrible people skills and said no apology and then proceeded to say it was a green bean strand. But it was very thin and black. They way they handled it was very poorly and I felt like they did not car. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"We decided to try Mc/S on Saturday, Feb 4th. party of 6 was seated at 12:30, got water and drinks right away and then the waiter vanished for 30 minutes.  Orders placed around 1pm and we served 45 minutes later.
Service is slow even when the restaurant is almost empty.  We had to track the waiter down to take our check.  
Food was o.k., certainly not worth the wait or price.  
This was our second time here and there won't be a third time."}
{"text":"After a great week in Vegas for work and some play we were happy to have a nice collection of restaurants near the convention center to dine at on our more quiet nights.

This place is in many of the cities we do business in and we know it generally does not blow our taste buds into heaven, but it gets us by without feeling gross. 

Our dinner was good. The waiter couldn't handle us and the dinner crowd as they arrived. Service was not available after our dinner was served. Had to ask twice to pay!

The Lobster Bisque is AVERAGE!! The waiter assured me it is not like eating thick gravy and it is soupy. He was close to right on that. Still could be a bit thinner and LACKS FLAVOR!! He assured me it is the best flavor. FAIL.  Edible. But not an experience I will return to. It seems to change location to location. I will not order it ever again. 

Still just a place to eat decent food. Just not a wow factor to any degree. As always."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Made a reservation online and was able to seat us 10 minutes earlier than scheduled time in a cozy table tucked away from the majority of the diners for a romantic dinner for two. Grilled swordfish and cashew crusted tilapia were amazing. The chocolate box was a very decadent finish to our meal!"}
{"text":"Corporate accounts only. I took my partner here on a monday night for bday dinner. I was hoping for a nice fancy seafood place above and beyond the ol RB exp. The place is very nice inside, we were seated at a nice booth, the waitress was really good and came to check on us almost too much. Calimari app was pretty good - reminded me alot of the stuff they serve at that italian olive place. For entree I ordered the glazed salmon with mashed potates and green beans and my partner ordered the scallops and spinach over sweet potatoes.  The salmon was real good- it had crispy edges and an almost carmelized glaze, kinda small, but cooked just right. The rest of my meal sucked. I could tell that the beans were previously frozen. They were crunchy almost uncooked and covered in oil. Same story with the mashed potatoes - premixed prob frozen and reheated to the point they were almost gummy. Towards the end our waitress disappaered even though there were only two other tables. We sat and waited for her for some time before we could request the check. Overall,  I was really disappointed in what i got compared to what i paid. I could have easily spent as much money at another place and gotten more, much better quailty food. If you have a company credit card and you're looking to woo potential clients then maybe this is the place for you. Make someone else pay for substandard overpriced food . YMMV."}
{"text":"Great place for a lone traveler!  My Bartenders were smart attentive and led me to a great experience!

Completely stuffed with great seafood, I managed to have a slice of the housemade specialty cheesecake!"}
{"text":"Service was good, but food mediocre at best.  I ordered Lump Crab Stuffed Shrimp. The shrimp were over cooked and the 'stuffing' had very little lump crab.  Overpriced for quality of food / very disappointed.  I will not return to this location, especially taking into account there are so many good restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Sorry, but this place is barely a step up from Outback Steakhouse. So, if you like those restaurants this is the right place."}
{"text":"Having a meal at a restaurant when a family member has food allergies is never easy. One of our PAK members had a great experience here. Her son has food allergies. \" The manager came to ask twice about his allergies and then got him broiled cod sticks. He did tell us that the fryer is common so we stayed away from the French fries.\""}
{"text":"This review is based on how disrespectful the restaurant is to nearby residents who live near the restaurant.  On a weekday they had a carpet cleaner come which started at 10:15 pm and didn't end until nearly 1 am.  This was a clear noise violation yet they don't care about doing the right thing. They have lost a customer for life."}

Half of the mussels weren't opened&very little broth, but several rocks! Halibut was VERY dry and over cooked. The dessert was stale. At this point after dealing with it all, we asked for the cake to be taken off the bill. The waiter said manager said no. We asked for the manager to come over. He was THE biggest ahole I've ever met. Very condescending & said cake was fine. Asked us what we wanted him to do. How about learning how to treat your customers for starters.Only independent restaurants from now on. And restrooms had no tp"}

salmon was like flakes, rice was crispy: may be it was from the bottom of pan.

After being seated we were totally ignored with wait staff walking by the table for another 15 mins without even water being poured.  We just got up and walked out went to Dandelion Market and had a wonderful quick meal.  This place was a total fail and is off the list."}
{"text":"I had eaten at one of these restaurants in Philadelphia a few years ago and really liked it. So, when my family and I were in Pittsburgh recently for a night, I suggested we go. What a disappointment. It is very expensive and everything is a la carte. I suspect much of the food is corporate-produced, and most of the fish farmed and frozen. The \"wild\" salmon and halibut specials went for $36. I had steelhead trout that was overcooked, with saut√©ed chard and mushrooms for $22. Splurged on creme br√ªl√©e that tasted like it came from a mix. The wine list is ultra overpriced. We had a cocktail at the bar while our daughters went shopping, it was OK, but the bartenders seemed asleep. The very worst part of the experience was the service. In a word it was awful. He must have been in training, either that or he was deaf. He asked our table of 4 if we wanted bread twice, when it finally came, it was a tiny piece. We didn't even bother to ask for more. Did I mention it's very expensive? Should have gone to the Cheesecake Factory down the block, which I loathe."}
{"text":"Probably the most stressful dining experience I have had... I made a reservation for my family on Xmas eve and they called me a few times to tell me that they may not be able to accomodate my party of just two. Nevertheless, we went and got a table.  We were ignored for 22 minutes until Hannah got there...and then another waiter Mike told us that Hannah couldnt handle her 2 other tables so we would get us our waters and sodas...

Next....Hannah gets there... She did not know the menu at ALL! she couldnt tell us what vegetable came with the dish, what a berry drizzle was, and told us that the dish was smoked when it was simply grilled.  I ordered my dish and...low and behold, it wasn't even what i ordered. 

A manager comes over, who was pleasant, but she defended Hannah, saying she was new. Im sorry, but if you work in a place that has 30 dollar dishes, you should know the menu. And not just look for a tip. Hannah is borderline moronic and i feel bad for her... They comped our dessert... Oh wait, that still showed up on the bill after our bad experience.....  The more experienced server even said that they dont get taste tests to reccommend the food......."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 4 which I had booked online a week ahead of time. When we arrived there were hardly any people seated. They said it'd only be a couple of minutes to be seated. As we sat and waited many people arrived and were seated before us. Really??? 30 minutes passed by and we decided to leave. The wait time was ridiculous considering there were many open tables. After reading reviews about their sub par overpriced food I'm glad we decided to leave."}
{"text":"I went there for happy hour on 11/19/12 with a coworker to celebrate our promotions. The service was outstanding! I forget the server's name now but she was just great. All of the patrons were well taken care of by the service staff. I got 2 rum & cokes sweet potato fries and fish tacos. My coworker got a burger and 2 rum & cokes as well. She loved her burger and said it as tasty. The sauce that came with the fries was amazing. Her and I typically mix BBQ sauce with ranch when we order sweet potato fries but this sauce that it comes with was delicious! The dinning area ambiance was dark and quiet. The bar area was typical of a high priced, restaurant's bar. Dark and semi-quiet. I definitely recommend them for happy hour and I'm anxious to try them from dinner."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and service seems to be hit or miss depending on who I'm with. Went for dinner tonight with family to avoid a long wait time at another nearby restaurant. The place was dead, almost empty. With that said, you think the service would have been immaculate. Guess again. Empty hostess desk, finally greeted by the manager and seated. Waited some time before the less than pleasant server took his time coming over to our table. We immediately ordered drinks, simple juice and a cocktail for myself he asked if we wanted bread we said yes. We got water almost immediately but that was the extent of the service we received. Almost 15 minutes passed, no bread no drinks meanwhile he had made a point to stop by the table of the older white couple behind us several times with not even a glance in our direction. In the span of this time we watched other waitstaff dancing in the kitchen. This place is a joke. The Palm is right around the corner with just as good overpriced food and better service.... I will not be back, there are far too many other restaurants to tolerate poor service from lazy biased servers...."}
{"text":"Went there with friends for a Thanksgiving meal.  There was a group of us.  The service was horrible - server gave my drink and food to someone else in my group and then proceeded to give me someone else's check.  The food was cold and we learned that they ran out of food and had to go out to their other restaurant in the Southside to serve us.  THIS WAS AFTER WE HAD A RESERVATION FOR TWO MONTHS!  We waited 2 hours to get served.  It wasn't that they didn't know we were coming.  And when we complained about it all they said was \"Happy Thanksgiving.\"  They smirked and acted like we were doing us a favor -- If the restaurant was closed on that day they would have made no money, instead they made a fortune off of us - my check was $35 x nearly 30 in our party!  Took my money but gave me crappy food that was worse than a TV dinner.  This was my first time there and it will be my last.  If you are bragging about being open on a holiday then give first class service -- EVERY DAY -- shame on you for not telling us that you were having problems and at least offering to substitute another meal.  Shame on you for even calling yourself a professional restaurant."}
{"text":"Our meal here exceeded our expectations.  I had the scallops with crab hash and spinach.  The scallops were cooked perfectly, I.e., browned on the outside and just past translucency so there was still a very slight wiggle.  The crab hash was firm but fully cooked.  The spinach was also near perfect with absolutely no metallic taste.  My wife had the shrimp with mashed potatoes and green beans/carrots.  The shrimp was almost perfect being very slightly overcooked -- still tender but firm.  The vegetables were firm as they should be.  The potatoes were fine but nothing special.  We did have the calimari appetizer and that was cooked just right being tender.  We'll be back, but not often as it was pricey."}
{"text":"Chopped salad was great. The flounder and mash were lacking flavor. For the price, I expected more. Service was great !"}
{"text":"I took my family there for a birthday.
The server Rita was obviously not experienced 
She forgot steak knifes,crab forks and drinks.
The thing that really made me mad is the quality of the food. The crab cakes tasted horrible. They were mushy and lacked consistency. The fries were over seasoned, mashed potatoes we're runny and my steak undercooked. The creme br√ªl√©e was not fresh and did not have the sufficient sugar crust.
The only good thing was my drink which I needed  after the 400plus bill. I don't mind paying for a good meal when it's good!
I won't be back. Very disappointed"}
{"text":"Oh McCormick and Schmick how the mighty have fallen.  I remember when you first made an appearance on the Pittsburgh restaurant scene, you were once a solid performer.  Things have changed.  Spoiled iced tea, cold crab bisque, oil slick root vegetables...oh my!  Not to mention, you ran out of mashed potatoes!  What kind of restaurant runs out of mashed potatoes!!!  Our final bill included the Shrimp Trilogy, Swordfish, cocktail and a bottle of S. Pellegrino and the grand total was $82.93!  Yes, you read that correctly, we complained 3 times, had two items deducted from our bill and it was still $82.93.  The server tried her best.  Unfortunately, we won't be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant is a relaxing space. And, I appreciate the 10 under $10 lunch idea. It would be useful, however, for the wine list to be clear that the 8 oz. glasses of house wines run $12. I had two glasses, my friend one, and just like that we had a $36 liquor bill. I had an ahi tuna skewer. It was ok - not much flavor. The stir fried vegetables were very salty. My friend order salmon cakes but a different salmon dish arrived. Overall, my feeling is that I could have spent $65.00 elsewhere for a far nicer experience."}
{"text":"Very mediocre restaurant particularly compared to 4 and 5 star's on the strip. Food for our group of 6 came out at various times probably 5 minutes between first served and last served. My food was lukewarm and salmon was ok at best. Service was weak it seemed like our waiter was either new or ambivalent."}
{"text":"What happened!? 

I went back a couple of times, the second thinking the first was just a bad timing sort of thing but this used to be my favorite spot. The music is loud and I think they updated the paint and decor but I was just so distracted by the lack of care and the music being too loud for a cozy restaurant. I just couldn't believe this was the place I used to bring friends dates family and recommended it to everyone. 

I ordered my usual strip steak and it was ok but not cooked perfect like the medium I desire. Every time  I went before it was always perfect. I get a caesar salad and it was bland and romaine tasted like a store bought bag. Beer was still good and wine was fine. 

As for service, this is where I got confused and frustrated. Servers here used to be very friendly and had great personality with small talk and knew the menu like the back of their hand. The two prior times I thought I was being pranked. Different server both times but both had trouble finding their way back to our table. Ten minutes for a drink order of four and the place is half empty? A half hour for our food!? Then another twenty to have them ask if we wanted coffee or desert and then got our check. 

I haven't gone back and have no plans to. Hopefully I get word of mouth that it's back to what I once liked about it and will maybe try it again. Third times a charm?"}
{"text":"Wondering around uptown looking for a bar seat, quick light lunch and an afternoon glass of vino (shhh) around 2pm. I have eaten at the Schmick's SouthPark, so I swung into the Uptown location. Figured it's reliable and I was hoping for a friendly bartender to chat with. 

I really don't get the hype over this place! Everytime I eat there I pretend (to my big Mccormick fan friends) that its great, but honestly, I do not think the service nor the food quality is better than your average Red Lobster.

The \"Oversized\" prawns, sold by the prawn for $2.50/ea are anything, but oversized and one of mine looked anything, but fresh. The (one, tiny) crab cake I had was tasty, but I have had much much better. It was definitely not \"lump\" and overpriced ($11 bucks).

Last, the bartender was so consumed in talking to her regular about her own life and barely seemed to have any interest, even when I threw out several safe conversation icebreakers, to talk to her other guests (me and one other guy). 

Nonetheless, I still left 20% and thanked them for the \"experience\", but I think that was definitely the last time I waste $31 ($$$ whoa!) at a Mccormick. I much rather swim over to Bonefish. 

Positive note: timely"}
{"text":"Thank you M&S for the Veterans appreciation meal. I had the the beef medallions and it was on point for medium rare. Attentive service with pleasant surroundings."}
{"text":"After a disappointing experience here the management staff went above and beyond to make sure our next experience was flawless. I can't thank Jennifer and Sean enough for reaching out and putting a personal touch on the visit. The desserts are beyond amazing!"}
{"text":"Spent the last 9 days in OC...couldn't wait to get home and come to M&S for shrimp kisses and a crab cob salad (on menu as lobster but they are always willing to change to suit you)"}
{"text":"Visited here on a weeknight. The service was surprisingly awful.  We waited 15 minutes for a cocktail.  We never saw our waiter again.  Our  food was placed in front of us by staff.  From that point on we were on our own. No drinks, no water refills, no checking in. Lobster was undercooked and I had to take it home.   We finally saw our waiter later, who stopped by to ask if anyone had brought our check (?????).   Very disappointing evening."}
{"text":"Our group of 7  went to celebrate the graduation of an intern that was leaving.
The excellent service started from the door with the greeter and then a friendly, polite Seater escorted the group to a semi private cozy corner table.
Our waiter Doug promptly came over to greet us, bring the menus, explain the specials and answered our questions about certain dishes. You could tell he knew the menu well.
The service was top of the line great and professional. The courses were delivered in a timely manner. And he made the occasion special by adding a lit candle on the dessert.
Awesome Food, service and overall experience."}
{"text":"The bread was great, as they get it from San Francisco, however, the food they brought out was cold, and it was average quality for a more expensive, upscale-looking restaurant."}
{"text":"Had out of town family. Thought I would take my party of 8 for a nice evening, When a Hostess takes a DUST rag and begins to DUST lamps and picture frames not only around us while we were eating, but on top of tables that were already set up with clean napkins and silverware.  It gets worse. The same Hostess stands on the chair in a booth to begin cleaning the top of a picture frame that was taller than her. 
We had a small child in our party who has asthma and gluten issues. I am OUTRAGED. 
Why should I have to tell this Hostess that this is inappropriate.  Once we told the waitress what happened, she said she would inform the manager. 
No one ever came to talk with us about the incident.  How un sanitary. And just RUDE. 
Some of our party are seasoned business people who take clients to eat all over the country. 
I could have used the 500 dollars to cook dinner at home and clean at the same time around my guests. I was so, so embarrassed. 

I'm not sure if I will ever bring another business client or family here again or have anyone in my office ever bring clients to this establishment. 
UNBELIEVABLE"}
{"text":"Just stopped in at this location for the first time last weekend for happy hour.  It wasn't very happy though. The waitstaff looked miserable and irritated when I walked into the bar area and took a seat. Luckily the server who appeared at our table was pleasant. We had pita with hummus, calamari, and fish tacos. The pita and hummus was the best by far. The calamari was just plain and flavorless, the marinara that accompanied it was not good either. I really didn't find the fish tacos very good either. I've always loved their unbeatable happy hour specials but I don't see myself eating at this location again. I've had a much better experience at the downtown location for dinner."}
{"text":"$3.85 for a glass of iced tea? You've gotta be kiddin!"}
{"text":"Our friends from out of town wanted some sea food so we took them to McCormick & Schmick's. The restaurant is in a great location, in a stand alone attractive stone building. The interior was clean and the decor was warm and inviting. We were seated in a private booth with chairs instead of benches that were very comfortable. Our server was fantastic, very attentive but not pushy. The bartender gave us a good pour in our cocktails which were great and the food was excellent. My friend said the swordfish special was the best swordfish he had ever had. The manager came by to make sure everything was ok and thanked us for coming in. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I managed to snag a 6:30 reservation at McCormick and Schmick's using OpenTable last Saturday night even though it was packed. When we arrived, we found the hostess pretty much turning away anyone without a reservation.

The hostess offered to let us sit faster in the bar area at a table, or we could wait for 15 minutes for a table outside the bar area. We opted for the bar table. For some reason, after we were sat, I received an email from OpenTable notifying me that my reservation had been \"cancelled\" by the restaurant, which was annoying because you get points for making and keeping reservations via OpenTable, which can later be redeemed for gift certificates. Because they cancelled my reservation, I didn't accrue those points.

That issue aside, our server was Susan, and she was fast and helpful. The food came out quickly, as expected since they had a fairly set Restaurant Week menu. My crab cakes were excellent, but my husband reported that his scallops were cold.

The service (and my crab cakes) are what jack this review up to 3 stars. They got it about half right. I can't say that I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Usually I love this restaurant, however after eating crab cakes I was very sick and it ruined my evening. Not going back"}

It was chocolate in the form of an actual brown bag and the. Filled with white chocolate something great and berries! Ohhh man"}
{"text":"I took my grandmother to lunch as M+S on Saturday, figuring it would be good as she was a fan of seafood. 
We were greeted to a pretty sparsely seated dining room, i guess Saturday just isn't the day in South park to eat lunch. Seating was a booth, large enough for three, and was missing a napkin from he setting off the bat. No big deal, the server who sat us just replaced it with one from neighboring table (and never replaced it). Our server came almost immediately and offered an awkward introduction asking blindly if we would like her to bring water. We ordered other drinks instead and she appeared with them a moment later. With a very dry tone, she recited what was clearly a scripted menu tour that outlined her favorites as well as the chefs feature. We took a minute to review and came to a conclusion. Now, I like that the menu is ever-changing, it gives you an opportunity to learn about seafood instead of just consume it. The lunch menu was one that I had seen a few times here with some pretty solid staples. Granny ordered the Grilled Shrimp Salad and I the Seafood Mac-n-Cheese. 
Both arrived promptly by our server and drinks were refilled at the halfway point. 
The Mac-n-cheese was good, a little over salted as I think the parmigiano cheese added a salt after the chef added his. The seafood was shrimp and scallops and had a crust of breadcrumb that added a nice texture. The scallops were bay scallops and added a sweetness that tried to offset the salt. I ate it all, it was good. 
Granny's Salad had a generous portion of dressing, good, but I would recommend asking for it on the side and adding yourself. The shrimp were also generous, I counted 9, tail on shrimp, that were easily 16-20 count. Grilled to the perfect point so as not to seem rubbery. 
Service was textbook good, server just had a dry sense about her that came off as a bit awkward. Food was good, with one small thing I would correct, and the meal came out FAST. I would go back, and take a guest."}
{"text":"Had dinner with a friend on a Wednesday night and I was really surprised to see the restaurant so busy.  I took this as a good sign and I was right - somebody likes this place!  We started with calamari and oysters (fried). Both were lightly battered, fresh and flavorful.  In fact, I wish the oysters had been available as an entree.  Next up was the mixed seafood grill (salmon, shrimp scampi, stuffed shrimp and scallops).  I enjoyed everything except the scampi, which was a bit dry.  The salmon was prepared perfectly.  The dish was served with a cheddar mash and veggies.  My companion ordered 'shrimp trilogy' and had great things to say.  Wine list is pretty good.  The atmosphere was also nice - we were tucked away in a booth that made it quite cozy.  Best part of the experience - our server was wonderful!  Welcoming, friendly, made good suggestions and didn't steer us wrong."}
{"text":"Having eaten at several locations throughout the country over the years, this location was no exception with good food, excellent service, and good drinks. The only complaint was the inconsistency with the drinks. The alcohol in my cocktails varied, and well when your spending about $10 a drink, you kind of expect more. We had dinner and found this was a short walk over to the Benedum afterwards."}
{"text":"I make sure to stop here for every Vegas trip.  Fast friendly service and fresh fish every time!  The scallops, ceder planked salmon and filet here are a must try! I like that I can sit at the bar and order dinner when traveling alone. The drink selection is good along with a professional bar tender who was able to hand make bleu cheese olives for my Dads martini!  Very impressed when one goes above and beyond! Thank you!  Valet service along with someone holding the door for you! The very reason I will return in the future!"}
{"text":"This review is strictly based on the happy hour offered in the bar section of McCormick & Schmicks. 

Coming from the Chicagoland area I was excited to find a McCormick & Schmicks in downtown Pittsburgh. There happy hour menu is like no other restaurant or bar. Mainly, the best deal on the menu is the $2.95 cheeseburger. They also offer great drink specials as well as other food specials.

On this specific visit I was able to enjoy two locally brewed beers, a cheeseburger, and pierogies all for $13. You really cannot beat the prices to enjoy such high-quality food; especially when the happy hour is offered Monday-Saturday!"}
{"text":"A group of 5 of us had reservations for last Saturday....or so we thought. Luckily the sweet hosted found us a 6 top in the bar and I was told our service would be the same as if we were in the dining room. It took over 20 minutes for us to even order our drinks. There was ONE server and ONE bartender for the entire bar side. We saw multiple people come in and proceed to leave because no one was getting waited on. We had to ask for water 3 times and order our drinks in multiples bc it was nearly impossible to get our servers attention and she would forget our order the second she left our table. My boyfriend got served the wrong drink twice and the kicker was that she insisted that is what he ordered rather than apologizing and getting the correct one. Our food was cold, and mostly incorrect. We were charged $5 extra for a plates that werent even on the menu. It took 2.5 hours and a $140 bill to have the worst service and experience downtown I've ever had. Never once did anyone apologize for the wait or the incorrect orders. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!"}
{"text":"Have you ever eaten somewhere that you know will be folding it up soon?  Unfortunately, that was M&S this evening.

We made a 7:45 PM reservation for a Saturday night during the Christmas season and given this place's location at the mall, we assumed it would be crowded.  It wasn't, so we had hopes that service would be okay.  As it turned out, service was terrible.  Apps didn't arrive for nearly an hour, entrees shortly thereafter.  We had the swordfish (which was very good), chicken (which was okay) and a kobe burger that was so awful I was offended that it even made it out of the kitchen.  It was like a $15 hockey puck, except you can chew a hockey puck.  By that time, we were an hour and a half in and I had no further will.

Morton's couldn't make it next door (folded up and got replaced with a Mexican restaurant that is struggling as well) and as Anthony Bourdain says, this place has the smell of death in it.  Too bad, it's a good chain."}
{"text":"My husband defines the service as Chili servers at a fine dining restaurant.  To me it seemed like the whole wait staff was working off Saturday night's party and Sunday morning's hangover. Patrons were crammed in to one section even though the restaurant was fairly empty. Even though the restaurant was empty, the hostess still had trouble finding a table to seat us. I could then overhear servers asking if our table belonged to them. The table that was Seated after us had drinks before we even found our waiter. His name was Thomas, but we didn't learn that until our bill arrived as he didn't find it necessary to introduce himself. Beware of the calamari, it also has pickled vegetables, more than likely you wont be able to determine what you are eating until you bite into it. The chicken fettuccine was good, the stuffed shrimp were small and overcooked but the lump crab meat was yummy. I will not be back... unless it's only to drink wine, they do have good wine selection. It was quite a disappointing meal and definitely not the meal that I wanted to start my honeymoon with."}
{"text":"Had a great pre-show dinner with my mom at M&S on Sunday night.  It is one of only a few places open downtown on Sunday for a nice dinner before a show.  Made a res on OpenTable.  We had drinks, dinner, and shared a dessert.  I feel that it was quite overpriced for the sizes of the entrees (sea scallops and the seafood trio) and drinks (wine & a martini)...otherwise I would have given 5-stars.  My mom's entree was barely lukewarm...a bit cold even, and we had to send it back...although we dread doing that.  Mine was great though and so was our choc cake/rasp sauce.  Our waiter was very attentive and humored my sometimes overbearing mother.  Thanks for a nice evening out."}
{"text":"This was one the best experiences we have had at a restaurant in a long time. Melissa and Brianna were most attentive and made us feel special. My best friend and I will definitely come back. The food was excellent also. Since this is restaurant week, we had 3 courses and all of it was mouth watering. Kudos to the Chef. Please keep doing what you are doing. It was excellent from beginning to end."}
{"text":"My experience at this seafood restaurant was great.  They had a wine tasting event and I was lucky to have been invited to attend.   The salmon was delightful.  They served the best white wine I've tasted.  I don't recall the name brand but I'll update if I remember..."}
{"text":"Had happy hour here before we went to the Benedum last Thursday.   The fish tacos, bruschetta & Asian chicken lettuce wraps were delicious & the prices were a real bargain.   The lemon drop martini was perfect.   Will definitely come back for happy hour again & again."}
{"text":"Right when we sat the water glasses were stained and had to ask to replace the glasses. Boyfriend ordered steak and lobster and asked what sides come with and waitor told It came with asparagus.  When food arrived.. my order was fine but his came with potatoes instead of asparagus . Let it pass and settled for potatoes then realized they were raw. Crunchy ..... and crab cakes we had for appetizer I had better.. never told server but Tipped and left. Wasn't up to hype."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar for happy hour. I had their version of a margarita. It was $7.00 & was good not strong but just good. I also order the firecracker shrimp$5.99-much too sweet for me- I was expecting spicy sweet per the menu. I also ordered a burger 3.99. It was ok not the best it came with French fries. Good price. I also ordered wings ate them the next day. Those were very good. You get 6 for $5.99. That was the best & most tastiest deal! 

The staff was very very nice! Big plus."}
{"text":"I've been traveling to Vegas for work for over 7 years, and always looked forward to eating here. Unfortunately things have changed. The last 2 times I've been, it has been horrible. I found out that they have been sold. I thought I would give it another chance, that perhaps the lst visit after the sale was a fluke, but it was the worst ever experience.
I waited at my table forever for a waiter. I got up twice to ask for one. When she arrived, she was very indifferent. She asked if I knew what I wanted. I had to ask HER for a menu. I ordered a glass of white wine. When she finally brought it. it was the smallest pour I have ever seen. Had to request bread, and was told they were 'out of butter'.
Dinner took it's time, and was delivered by someone else, but it was acceptable. 
My waitress never came back to see if I needed another drink, or to check on the food. 
Of course, I had to search again for someone to bring a bill. When I got it, I was charged double for the small drink. Also had to wait to get an itemized receipt that my company requires. 
The table next to me complained to the waiter that they were never brought a side dish they had ordered.  I overheard the table on the other side of me complain that one dish was cold. 

 Obviously M&S, you are unaware that there are thousands of other restaurant choices in Las Vegas. I will not"}

{"text":"I'm starting to like the coupons from restaurant.com - picked up a $25 gift cert for only $2 a few weeks back for McCormick's.  I've happy hour'd at least 5-6 times at this location but never a sit down dinner.

roomie went with the clam app, blackened catfish; I had the calamari,  the mixed grill and we shared a salad.  

Everything was well prepared , the clams were incredible - a huge bowl for only $10 - the highlight for sure.  It's been awhile since i've had a blackened fish ( remember the heyday of blackened everything ?!? ) 

The mixed grill - decent ( the salmon a little overcooked ) - a bonus - it came with creme brulee for dessert .

Next time i can get a $25 cert for $2, i will consider McCormick's again !

Total cost  $64."}
{"text":"Only the appetizer was good. Both of our entrees were practically inedible. I got crab cakes they were so fishy tasting. It was so gross. And it came with French fries. The food is way too overpriced to have French fries as the side rather than a vegetable."}

{"text":"Great service and great brunch. Very pleasantly surprised. Last time I went was for dinner and they have a fantastic seafood selection as expected. Brunch was off the chain on a Saturday afternoon. Highly recommend the calamari and shrimp kisses ( pepper jack cheese, & bacon wrapped shrimp sitting on roasted corn salsa with onion strings) Heavenly! Thank you to Jasmine, Max, Jo, Bree, et all for a beautiful Afternoon brunch for a large party. We lacked for nothing. You also can't beat $3 Mimosas"}
{"text":"The fish is fresh and delicious, the portions are a good size, and the lunchtime chef, Rigo is a phenomenal talent.  It's about the same price as the Italian place across the street, but in my opinion a much better value.

The wait staff is professional, the happy hour specials (especially the burger) are great.

If I had it in my budget, I'd eat lunch here at least 3 times a week."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour and was disappointed. The service was slow and the food not very good. I ordered a dozen oysters and they were so small. The Cesar salad had way too much dressing on it and the cheese quesadilla was very greasy. The wings on the happy hour menu were undercooked."}

{"text":"When I lived in Chicago McCormick & Schmick was a go to spot when you wanted to get a good meal and enjoy an upscale happy hour (that would eventually devolve into shenanigans...but I digress). 
When I arrived in Pittsburgh I thought that I could expect the same. Unfortunately while the quality is on par with Chicago. The experience is not there. I think its the location. It's like parking a Tesla outside of a starter home nothing wrong with either item but they really don't fit well together. 
Social experience aside the dining experience is great and I plan on returning."}
{"text":"It's definitely not up to the standards offered at their restaurants in Seattle & Minneapolis.

We just had our Thanksgiving dinner here. We had reservations and there were plenty of open tables yet they didn't seat us till 25 minutes after our reservation time. Our drinks and waitress were exceptional no complaints there, thank god. Campbell's could do better Butternut squash soup. The turkey was rubbery and not cooked enough but the rest of the main dinner was great, the stuffing was phenomenal. 

The final straw for me was my piece of Pumpkin pie, Diagonally it was slightly bigger then my phone 5s screen, not the phone, the screen.

Thanks for nothing"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in downtown Charlotte seeing a concert for New Year's Eve and decided to drop in for some drinks and appetizers. The hostess was so nice and our waitress was great. However, the food and drinks were less than par for the amount of money we paid. We order the Coast to Coast Tuna as an appetizer and it was bad. I have had better seared tuna at a strip mall Chinese restaurant. My boyfriend ordered the Fish and Chips and though it was good it put us back 20 bucks. I ordered a side salad and the crab cake appetizer. The crab cake was the only thing that stood out to me. The cocktails were overly sweet but the beer was cold. I don't think I will be going back next time I am in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I've been at my table for 1:45 minutes  and have only gotten soup and stale bread. Longest wait in a beautiful, well known restaurant. Good quality aside, not worth the wait."}
{"text":"My husband & I went for happy hour because we could sit outside with the dog. Menu selection looked good & had good prices. Started with the hummus,which was good,should have stopped with that. I did not see the review on the tuna & made the mistake of ordering it. It tasted like I dumped a salt shaker in my mouth....inedible!!! Although nice, our server was extremely slow.  We sat with our empty drinks & uneaten tuna for about 20 minutes when a different server came out with our bill. Maybe we wanted another drink (we didn't )  we never asked for a bill. It took at least 15 more minutes for our original server to come back. She did take the tuna off the bill when we told her about because she said it's not suppose to be like that. But after reading another review that said the same thing it appears some chef in there thinks it's good when in reality it was one the of worst things we ever ate. We would go back only if we wanted to take the dog out for cocktails & maybe try the burger hoping it's good."}
{"text":"Went to McCormick and Schmick's on Friday March 21st.  We had a reservation for 9:00 PM.  It was father/daughter night and my \"date\" was my 13 year old daughter.  The restaurant was her pick and I have always heard good things about McCormick and Schmick's so off we went.  We were seated immediately upon arriving at 8:58 PM and the wait staff was quick and attentive.  The restaurant (like downtown Pittsburgh on a Friday night) was not very busy but that was ok because it made for a relaxing dinner.  We started with a couple of appetizers; a sashimi plate for me and lobster bites for my daughter.  The sashimi was served on a rectangular plate and presented very artfully.  It was a combination of salmon and some kind of whitefish and the temperature was very cold...this is a good thing, I am wary of sashimi if it's even CLOSE to room temperature.  I enjoyed it a great deal.  The lobster bites were apparently tail meat morsels dredged in a tempura batter so as not to extinguish the flavor of the lobster and served cleverly in the empty tail shell.  They were, according to my daughter, very good.  We continued with a bowl of lobster bisque for her and a wedge salad for me.  The lobster bisque was the richest one I have ever tasted.  Good, but rich.  My daughter ate some and saved the rest for take home.  My salad was simple, cold and delicious.  For entrees we had linguini alfredo with grilled chicken for her and a grilled cobia with forbidden rice for me.  The alfredo was perfect and the chicken grilled perfectly as well, my daughter enjoyed it and took home leftovers.  My cobia was grilled to perfection as well and served with, like I said, forbidden rice which is a black colored rice (its natural color) but doesn't taste unusual.  It has a bit more tooth to it than regular white or brown rice but was a great contrast to the fish.  All in all it was a very nice meal.  The missing star is because my daughter had intended on getting a lobster or king crab dinner and those weren't available.  I would go back but for me this is a once every 4-6 month restaurant and not a once a month place.  Not because of price but the food is not mind-blowing just really good.  Thanks for a nice dinner McC and S!"}
{"text":"I have been here many times for work lunches and there are a handful of dishes that are always solid (Parmesan crusted flounder, soups, fish tacos, halibut). But, maybe because it's a chain, I have always thought it was just \"meh\" for the most part. Some place pretty good and quick, but nothing to write home about.

In any event, came with my wife here for January 2018 restaurant week. The dinner was mostly just okay. You could sort of tell how they tried to cut corners on the restaurant week menu (which is a tad irritating because the deal is the only reason anyone was there for dinner).

For example, the crab soup was just a vegetable soup with a little crab thrown in there. The lobster sauce on the mashed potatoes was just their bisque soup base. My wife's steak medallions had to be sent back for very obviously being undercooked-- something that reflects inattentiveness and lack of attention to detail.

That said, much of the food was still good, like the lobster tails, potato hash, calamari. The desserts were decadent, as well. Mostly stuff you can't mess up. Service was good.

So, in the end, it was a pretty good but not a place I would be itching to go to, and I would probably
Never come back here during restaurant week
Again."}
{"text":"Ate here with a party of three right before Wicked at the Benedum. We chose the chef's fixed price menu which was a good deal.   The jumbo lump crab tower was disappointing and the mango just clashed with the dish.  Ruth's Chris and other restaurants do better with their crabtini style apps.

The clam chowder was good. 

The salmon over pasta had a nice piece of grilled fish, perfectly cooked, over orzo with spinach and asparagus. The creme brulee was good, if not just a little sweet. 

Other dishes were as successful like the beef medallions with shrimp and the nut crusted tilapia. 

The service was great.   The drinks were fine but expensive. 

Overall it was a fine meal, but it was pricey for what we got. If value was a little better, I'd give it 5 stars. 

Recommended."}
{"text":"Had a 5 star meal tonight. Sea bass in an herbal broth to die for.  Beef medallions for my husband were perfectly cooked and delicious. Apps of raw oysters and calamari were also outstanding. The Duck Horn chardonnay was the perfect pairing for my sea bass.
Service was outstanding as well"}
{"text":"I came here for the happy hour, which I had heard SO much about. They offer an amazing happy hour from 4-7pm M-F & on the weekend 5-9pm. Tues-Thurs they have additional specials. I ordered the Baja fish tacos, calamari & fire cracker shrimp tacos w/ a beer & w/ a Thursday special of crab. Everything was very tasty especially the crab & shrimp. All for $25. Def worth stopping in for a quick bite. The best thing about the tacos is you get 2 for $5 & they are a good sized portion."}
{"text":"I have frequented McCormick every year for at least the last six years while in Las Vegas for a convention. Always enjoyed until this year. What happened? Waiters are stressed (Restauraunt wasn't busy). Food was poorly presented, at least not up to prior standards. We also had to chase down our waiter for additional basic service items, napkin, water. I'll go back but will hope that things return back to the usual."}
{"text":"Our hostess told us it would be 10 minutes for a table, even though the place wasn't even slightly busy. My boyfriend's old fashioned tasted weird. Our crab cake was lukewarm.  Our food took a long time to come out and while most of it was delicious, it was also mostly lukewarm.  Finally we tried dessert and the white chocolate mousse was grainy. I'm not impressed for the price. Should have went to the strip. Rick put forth a valiant effort,  although he came back from his break smelling like a cigarette, but I would still give him 4 stars."}
{"text":"The crusted tilapia was okay - the sweet potato Couscous was not very flavorful. Good service at a somewhat expensive price for lunch"}
{"text":"Lobster was too salty & my steak was over cooked, mentioned it to the waiter who offered to send it back but also told me it was cooked to the right temp but last I knew medium rare isn't fully cooked around the edges with a small rare center not all the way through....."}
{"text":"Took my in-laws and husband here yesterday for the Veterans Appreciation Meal and as usual, M&S surpassed our expectations! Reservations were easy to make, seating was prompt considering we were about 25 minutes early for our reservations, and service was impeccable from the start. M&S had a special entree menu to choose from and we had: Tender Beef Medions, Beer Battered Fish & Chips, Skillet Bronzed Tilapia & Cedar Planked Salmon! All the food was cooked perfectly, seasoning was spot on and simply delicious! We will back!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food with poor service.  Management cares little about customer service as was reflected by the attitude I encountered when I flagged the manager down no less than three times to get water, clean silverware and salad dressing, which my wedge was served without.
I am sure that corporate management would be very troubled by the situation at this restaurant.
I was visiting Pittsburgh for the week, I frequent the Columbus location, it's quite different in quality and a huge difference in service.  
I would not recommend this restaurant under any circumstances."}
{"text":"We enjoy this chain but this particular one is worse than awful.  Two of the three sreaks had to be sent back to be cooked and only one came back acceptable.  Staff didn't seem to care if they serve good food or not.  Bad food, bad servive, a losing combination."}
{"text":"Food is solid but not great. Service is good but not exceptional. Pretty much the SAFE midscale seafood place. Great for semi-classy smaller family functions and group occasions.  If they took some chances on some more robust seasonings they could be more standout in this price-class."}
{"text":"It took a while for appetizers and entrees to come, but the food overall was excellent. However, I didn't feel comfortable with the manager asking my family what we did for a living to see if we could afford to pay for a decent meal or try to leave without paying (Indirectly). Saying the phrase, \"homegirl\", didn't make it any better. I think some should watch what they say to customers, no matter how nice of a tone they may say it in."}
{"text":"Meh, I never like chain restaurants.  But I wasn't in charge of this business lunch reservation so I went along with the program.  We told the server we were in a hurry but still, the service was slow.  I ordered the buffalo chicken salad.  Presentation was great, it tasted good, but my stomach gave me some negative feedback on it hours later.  Not so good."}
{"text":"Don't go on a holiday or expected high traffic times (dinner rush, penguins steelers, pirates, etc) and you will have an excellent meal.  The lobster bisque should be served with baby aspirin it is so rich creamy and chunky with lobster ..... worth clogging your arteries.  If 
you have never eaten fresh lobster ORDER it here .... they will even clean it in the kitchen for you.

I love the king salmon.  The staff are very knowledgeable about the menu and willing to alter order to meet dietary needs.

The warm bread made onsite is addicting.  You can't just have one slice.  Order the apple pie for dessert ... it comes with Dave & Andy's cinnamon ice cream.

Alex is my favorite waiter."}
{"text":"We went her because we had a gift certificate and thought let's go, well everything was awful, the service sucked the waiter was rude and the food was awful. We eat at McCormick's all the time in other locations and never ever had an expierence like this one!"}
{"text":"My husband and I started at the bar for drinks then decided to have dinner in the restaurant on a Friday night.  Big mistake.  The disappointment started when I noticed that, having only 1/4 of his beer left, my husband had something big floating in it.  I still have no idea what it was.  Not wanting to make an issue out of it, he simply ordered another one.  Little did we know it was the beginning of a bad evening.  I started my dinner with a salad and ordered blue cheese dressing.  Not only was the blue cheese on the salad tasteless, the dressing had absolutely NO taste.  None.  I have never had tasteless blue cheese before.  My husband ordered clam chowder, which he said was okay.  I ordered the Shrimp Trilogy ($28).  The fried shrimp were FAR overdone and were extremely tough.  The stuffed shrimp was not loaded with lump crab meat as the menu said, but rather a ball of bland stuffing.  The worst part was the shrimp scampi -- the sauce was HORRIBLE!  It was very sour and bitter, like it had vinegar or lime as an ingredient (I could not tell).  It was absolutely terrible!  I tried to eat the shrimp after rubbing the sauce off.  It was inedible.  The side of sweet potato orzo was good, however.  My husband ordered the buttermilk fried shrimp ($21).  As I mentioned with my meal, the shrimp was so overdone and tough.  They butterflied the shrimp so that it was split all the way to the tail, which only allowed for the shrimp to cook even faster.  I think my husband ate 2 shrimp (if that) and took the rest home.  When he tried to reheat them later, not surprisingly, they became even tougher.  They went in the garbage, as did a good portion of my meal.  I watched an episode of the Billion Dollar Buyer where the owner of the Landry's chain, Tilman Fertitta, said he keeps his food costs down to 25% or lower.  It shows!  We left around 6:00 pm on a Friday night, and there were only 2 other tables occupied in the restaurant.  Now I know why.  Not what I would have expected from a higher end restaurant."}
{"text":"Came here for the happy hour.  Well, actually we came prepared to have a semi-swank dinner but the hosts were like \"happy hour, yo!\" and we were like \"yeah.\"  Stuff on the menu was as cheap as 1.95 (hummus) and as much as like oh, 7.99 (oysters).  Basically American tapas with a bit of a seafood/tex-mex influence.

The tasty: pesto pizza (although its a bit small), fish tacos, and I'm guessing a sort of Cajun-style shrimp (I haven't been around long enough to really know what that means but it was good).

The less-than-tasty: hummus (too much cumin!), the mussels (well, who thought it was a good idea to put cilantro on mussels? Really!)

Also note that they had some martini/cocktail specials, between 5-7 bucks each - I got a raspberry martini that tasted like a lollipop and didn't give any buzz, so meh.

Yeah I'd come back, maybe not in a hurry but I would."}
{"text":"First of all, this is my first time here and the also is a coincidence cuz I like oysters  and they have this advertisement $1 oysters from happy hour - close which they denied at first and said it's only till 7pm . Well once that was sorted we ordered dozen oysters and a beer and one side for two chicken tender and 12 fries ( like seriously with counting 12 fries ) and charged $7 for that side . Now we waited 40 mins for our oyster !!! And 15 mins for our check and this is on Wednesday not even on weekend or a busy day .... at f I cud give less thn one star I would ... I won't recommend this to anyone !!!! Extremely slow service ,servers have  attitude, no greeting or anything just str8 cheap place attitude . Honestly I have had better experience at local Mexican taco joint . If u can spend this much money please goto places near by there e plenty of nice restaurant on same street . DO NOT! Dine here it's not worth the money !"}
{"text":"Five of us from our training course decided to go here because they had steak and seafood.  We got there around 6:30 PM on Wednesday and there was no wait.  It is a classy place and reminded me of Ruth Chris, Morton's or other nice places.  What was unique is they put us in a private room which was really nice and allowed us to have some privacy; and we didn't ask for it.  

Our waiter was top of the line and we could not have asked for better service.  He was also training another server and he was the one to show her how it is done.  They have a full bar and the draught beer selection was not bad (+1).  I ordered the swordfish that sat on top of grilled vegetables.   It was probably one of the best I have had.  My friends had various dishes and raved at the quality and taste.  Two of them had steaks which were cooked perfectly.  

I go to LV twice a year for this training and like the High Roller, we added this to our list of must do places when we are there.  They get a 5 from me... I think I am giving out too many fives ."}
{"text":"Busy, loud, and festive. Lauren (in the bar) is a great waitress.  Decent seafood, not as good as LaVecchia's."}
{"text":"We've previously been to this location and have been quite satisfied. However, we visited this weekend and weren't as pleased as previously. Our reservation was honored and we were seated in a booth. My seat was quite wet, so the hostess had to get a towel and dry the seat before I could sit down. The seats were pushed so close to the table that it was quite uncomfortable. We weren't able to push the seat back because other customers were seated at the table behind us. After waiting for nearly 15 minutes, we were greeted by our server. He was pleasant and knowledgeable of menu offerings. The server promptly served us water and fresh bread. We then realized that we didn't have any napkins. After waiting for more than 5 minutes for our server to return, I finally asked the hostess for napkins. She retrieved them and apologized. My dining partner ordered fish & chips. He said it was very good, except it was a bit greasy. I ordered the fried shrimp. It was piping hot when served, but it, too, was a bit greasy. Our used plates and silverware were not removed from the table until we were presented with our check. We were properly thanked by our server."}
{"text":"My family of 4 waited 45 mins until the waiter brought us bread and another thirty mins before our appetizers came our and another 30 for our food. Just bread not butter or olive oil on the side nothing. Waited one hour and a half for appetizers meanwhile a table that had been sitting since before we got there was waiting an hour just for their dessert. There are literally three tables being served on. The waiter forgot what we ordered and brought out the wrong dishes and no spoons for the soup. The salad was missing ingredients. This service was terrible and I can't believe we sat through it all. Charged us incorrectly for our meal at the end too. I've been to restaurants where I've had to wait a while due to low staffing but I'm usually compensated with bread or drinks or something or even being told at the beginning what the situation was. I remember walking in with my parents and we told him we'd like to order immediately so we can leave sooner and the waiter laughed. Now I know why. My steak was supposed to be medium and it came out well done. Overall this was bad. I don't care if my waiter had a peppy happy attitude because his service was terrible by giving us excuses...we didn't come to dinner to listen to someone tell us how busy the day was and how they send all their staff home early. Don't come here it's terrible all around."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times over the years, and am happy to report (based on my most recent visit after a lengthy absence) that the quality of the food and service has maintained consistency.   

I wasn't feelin' the fish during my recent visit, so I selected the walnut and greens salad followed by the roast chicken.  The salad hit the spot, with lots of blue cheese, candied walnuts and spring greens.  The bread brought to the table was warm and delicious.  The half roasted chicken was presented on a bed of mashed potatoes and spring vegetables (yellow squash and zucchini) and was perfectly cooked.  The potatoes sopped up all of the meaty juices from the chicken, which made them extra delicious.

When I visited, the bar area was hopping, so those happy hour specials that people keep mentioning in other reviews are probably worth checking out.  However, my sole goal was to eat, not drink.

I've found M&S to be  one of those chains that you can pretty much rely on no matter what city you're in, especially if you're a seafood lover."}
{"text":"reliable.

mccormicks is what i consider as reliable.  they have a quality that you can relay on regardless of what city that you're in.  you'll definitely pay more that going to the mom and pop places on maryland, which is one street east of paradise.  however, you can always count on quality seafood and difficulty in finding a waiter at peak hours (like lunch and dinner).  you prices are roughly $20 on an entree and $50 for a three-course with drink per individual.  i've been to three other mcCormick & schmick's: downtown - los angeles, burbank, and el segundo.  each time, the quality is the same and prices may vary slightly."}
{"text":"Probably won't be back. The salad was the best part.  It was only ok all around.


Bread- was sour dough w/ whipped butter. Good if that's your cup of tea. I liked it, but sour dough's not my favorite. 

Vodka soda- great! They also have Ciroc. 

Amazing salad!!! Ranch was the best. The croutons tasted smoky. Cesar dressing was not great.

Rigatoni in white sauce - ok, but nothing fantastic. 

Mashed Potatoes- ok, but not the best. 

Tuna was miniscule, smallest plate ever for $29. Crazy! My friend liked it, but not worth the price. She left hungry."}
{"text":"Was just here for the Valentine's Day special :

1 x Choice of soup or salad
1 x Steak (Top Sirloin) + Lobster (one half stuffed) 
1 x Vegetables / Potatoes
1 x Dessert (Chocolate mousse topped cookie)

all for $29.95

I started with the seafood corn chowder soup, my date had the caesar salad. Both were fine.

Steaks were good. They were VERY thick cuts and were quite tasty for top sirloin.

Lobsters were great. Succulent and tender, the stuffing was really yummy.

The dessert was also very good.

$29.95 + $29.95 - $25.00 Restaurant.com coupon = $35.00

Print out a coupon and go there now."}
{"text":"Had great service but the food was below par. Oysters were not cut off the shell and had to basically tear the oysters apart to get to them. There were 4 of us all together and none of us were satisfied."}
{"text":"Came to dine here celebrating my son's 9th Birthday. The food is excellent. We ordered the seafood trio and Cajun chicken pasta. Both were very good. Kids menu is nice too.
The hostess was kind enough to wish my son and printed a menu with his name printed! However our server Sarah was just ok. She did not wish my son, did nothing special for his birthday and even messed up the order. We ordered a bottle of wine, she never filled our glasses nor got a wine chiller. For a fine dining place like that, we expected better service."}
{"text":"This review is just specific to their lunch menu and lunch service. I took my mom to lunch after a busy morning of shopping at the mall. We were greeted right away and asked which we would prefer, a booth or a table. I love when restaurants give you a choice if either are available. Our server was very sweet, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Mom and I both had salads. The lobster Cob was so yummy! I almost ate it all and it was a good size! The only downside to the meal was that they charged me 3.25 for an unsweetened tea. What??! I should have ordered their house chardonnay for a few bucks more.. Oh well. Everything else was wonderful and I'll certainly return for lunch again soon."}
{"text":"So six months later corporate offices called me.  They wanted to know the name of our server. Seriously? After six months?!  They also sent a gift card... to make up for our horrible $235 evening, we got a $50 gift card.  Thanks.  For.  Nothing."}
{"text":"We went tonight for Mother's Day as we were uptown for a show.  We had reservations for 5pm.  When we get there we asked if we could sit outside.  Hostess said just go outside and sit and we will being your menus.  15 minutes later here comes a waitress with Menus.  She was not our waitress.  10 minutes later here comes our waitress.  Did not say Happy Mother's day or anything.  She just wanted to take our order.  It went downhill from there.  Service was horrible.  It ruined my Mother's Day dinner!!! Spoke with Manager and took off price of appetizer for our issues.  Needless to say waitress lost a hearty tip as we left none!!! We will never be back to this location."}
{"text":"Happy Thanksgiving Yelp Nation! 

As a transplant from a small town roughly 200 miles west of the 'Burgh it is a treat when I get to see my family. This year, due to work I had the actual holiday off, but no time for travel. My wonderful family decided to make the 4 hour drive in the snow and holiday traffic to come see their beloved baby boy. As a dedicated bachelor my apartment is suited to making spaghetti and meat balls and maybe a salad. Since this is no suitable Thanksgiving meal, we decided to book a table at McCormick & Schmick's. Truly this was a great decision.

To start with the decor, as usual (creature of habit), one automatically knows what one is in for. The place is full of lots of wood paneling, art-deco light fixtures, white tablecloths, and every other cliched trapping of a post industrialist restaurant. It conjured images of Ruth's Chris, Morton's or Capital Grill. Expensive and pretentious. However I am secretly 73 years old at heart so I kind of like it. At least it is consistent.

The service, which can at times mirror the decor in the high end steakhouse world, was actually quite pleasant. Our waiter, Peter, was very friendly and pleasant without being overbearing. This is a stark contrast to the last time I ate in a restaurant in the same style. Unlike that trip to the Capital Grill, which was me and my family suffering through some of the most condescending service I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing, Peter was warm and inviting and treated us like family. When I open my own restaurant I am cloning him about 20 times and calling it a day.

The main reason anyone goes to M&S, and any restaurant really,  is the food. I had a very memorable Thanksgiving dinner. Everything was amazing. We started with the Shrimp Kisses and the Coast to Coast Tuna. Both were wow dishes for me. The shrimp were lightly fried, stuffed with a pepperjack cheese (which was not overly spicy so big plus there) and wrapped with bacon, because bacon. The Tuna definitely had an Asian flavor profile and was comprised of very good seared tuna and a tuna tartar.

I followed the appetizers with an Iceberg Wedge Salad and some oysters. The salad was good, but nothing unique; think the same obligatory wedge salad you find in every steakhouse in America. The oysters were fantastic as well; fresh succulent and just the perfect bite of the ocean.

For dinner I had a grilled swordfish with asparagus, a butternut squash cous cous and a citrus salad on top. I cant even begin to put into words how awesome this dish was, so I'm not going to even try. Just take my lack of word for it.

For dessert, I ended with a chocolate and mocha cheesecake that was a special offering for the day. It was amazing. It was rich and sweet and had just the right balance of crunch in the Oreo crust. The thing I liked the best about it though was the dusting of cinnamon and coco powder put on the plate, obviously as a garnish. However, I had the bright idea to put the garnish on the cake and it gave it a pleasant spicy kick that set the dessert over the top.

To wrap up I like McCormick & Schmick's. Expect to pay top dollar (our bill was pushing $250 and we weren't drinking either) but I feel it was well worth it. The food was amazing, the decor, while a little stuffy, was exactly what I expected, but the star was the service. It is so easy to get caught up in yourself working for a high end restaurant, however our particular server, Peter was absolutely fantastic. I would go back just for him. And the cheesecake. And swordfish. And i need to stop myself before this gets even gushier."}
{"text":"The 4 stars is for their happy hour ONLY. It's actually pretty good here. Having been here several times now, I can honestly say that every time I've been here has been enjoyable. The food menu is not your average bar food, and all of it is under 10 bucks, including seafood. The burger has been made the way requested, not over/under done. For $5 you get an average sized burger, patty was actually thick when I think about it, and it comes with fries and a pickle. Not bad! considering you get the same meal at a McD's but this one's much better quality. The beef carpaccio, now that's a steal and it's superb. Have also had the mussels, tuna, calamari, and it's all been delicious. The drinks are made well, and are also under 10 bucks. For a cocktail?! can't beat that. We usually sit at the bar, so service is not an issue. The restaurant is spacious, as is the bar area, so you won't feel cramped. They have tv screens showing sports or CNN. The background music is usually upbeat, dance (on that trendy side) without being obnoxious. I've mainly gone at the beginning of happy hour, it's not been crowded at that time, can't say how it is after. Their happy hour is 7 days a week, not just M-F, love that! Hours and menu are on their website. The location is great, being near shops, a movie theater, and other restaurants if you want to hop around, or walk along the waterfront or catch an outdoor concert. If you're in the mood for a nice, finer type happy hour, this is a good option."}
{"text":"Wow, what a great meal. I had the sesame crusted salmon with the pancetta, mushroom risotto. Wow, that was an excellent meal. The waiter suggested an excellent Pinot noire to pair with the meal. From the hostess to the waiter to the manager they were all friendly and service oriented. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Celebratory work happy hour?! I'm there.  This was a nice little spot right downtown that hosted a goal celebration happy hour for a few teams from our office.  The drinks were great, and the food was delicious.  We had an assortment of appetizers to split which included Coconut Shrimp with a mango sauce, Quesadillas, Stuffed Mushrooms, and Oysters. 

It looked like they had a really great happy hour menu, some different food special each day of the week to go along with reasonable drink prices.  I would like to go back for dinner and check out the full menu.

The service was a little slow once the place started filling up (around 5:30-6), so make sure you order your drinks accordingly :)"}
{"text":"All my co-workers and I went here for a (really) belated holiday celebration - our big boss' treat XD They had all been here before as a group, so it was my first with the group and just in general. 
Setting was classy, yet casual. If I had gone alone, I might've felt a bit intimidated. 
Our server was nice, and checked up on us from time to time. Do have to admit that it was a bit awkward with him trying to promote the Landry's membership program after everyone told him that none of us were in it. 
The food was good. Liked their Seafood Stuffed Mushrooms and the Calamari wasn't rubbery like other establishments. Good portions for appetizers, but we had to order multiple for as a group of 13. LOL. 
Everyone's dishes looked yummy. Mine was definitely yummy, especially when I got it last. Hahaha... I guess there was a bit of a mix-up in the order since they had originally brought out an extra Fish & Chips, and I had ordered the Shrimp and Andouille Mac & Cheese. We'll just brush that off as an \"initiation\" since I'm the newest member of the staff XD
Dessert was cool. We all shared the Chocolate Boxes and Cheesecake. I honestly did not want to break that Chocolate Box 'cause it was just that pretty."}
{"text":"Name of the place says all. Only thing is watch out for the soups, they are very salty"}
{"text":"This used to be one of the top spots in Las Vegas but It turned to a so-so restaurant. 
The last time I ate here(2008) the steak was dry and not tender. Not to return for quite a while."}
{"text":"If I could make this no stars I would.
We had made reservations for Christmas uptown. Really looked forward to it. When we arrived we were seated at a table that was not as nice as it could've been. 
When we asked whether we could be seated at a table that was just two tables down and seemed much better to us they said somebody else had \"snagged\" it already. Even though it took a long time before anybody actually arrived to be seated.
We ordered, and it took an hour and 15 minutes to get served. Our server was completely uninterested.No apologies for the delay nor any explanations why people up on the table next to us who arrived after us already left even before we were served. 
Our appetizer, the lobster bisque, was ok, my entree when it finally arrived was horrible. Overly salted and cooked until the fish was so dry it could've crumbled. The other two in the party were also not overwhelmed with the quality or the taste of their food (fish & chips, soggy and almost cold and scallops, quite undercooked). We waited for a while to see if our server would notice that I was not touching my food. Instead she asked me if I wanted a box. So I finally had to tell her the food was horrible. She didn't apologize. The manager took my meal off the bill.
Certainly the food or the restaurant or the ambiance were not worth spending Christmas evening. There are plenty of other good restaurants in Charlotte. This one is totally off the list."}
{"text":"A friend and I went here last night before a show at the Blumenthal and were very disappointed, I felt even worse because I recommended it after visiting this location and the South Park location with a pleasant experience. Our server (I'm not going to mention her name) while very friendly was either distracted by other tables or not as concerned with us because we only had 2 appetizers and a couple of Caesar salads (event though our bill was still $94). My first complaint is that it took probably around 15 minutes to get my dirty martini, in all fairness I wasn't sure what I wanted to drink when my friend ordered hers and ordered mine when she came back to get our food order but I had to pull another waitress aside and ask if she could check on my drink after 15 minutes. So she brings that with our salads a few minutes later. It took longer for our appetizers to get there and my friend mistakenly ordered another martini that we had to split and slam because we were going to be late for our show and finally my friend had to go up to the hostess stand to have someone come cash us out. We were there for almost an hour and a half by the way. Very disappointing and definitely won't be going back before our next show at Time Warner this Sunday or possibly ever."}
{"text":"They seem to be really big on the service here.  Everyone was really sweet and made sure everything was just right for my friends and I.  I especially liked that the waiter gave us specific drink suggestions to go with the food we ordered, not just pushing whatever they told him to.  I thought that was really cool.  After much debate I decided to go with the salmon since it's one of my favorites, and wow.  It was cooked perfectly, and the crab and shrimp stuffing was to die for.  A little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"This place has the best customer service and wonderfully tasting steaks. The quality is on point.  My son ordered the swordfish and since the size wasn't right, they didn't bring it out and re-fired the fish so we could have the best quality.  I will definitely come back here when we're in town. The atmosphere is also on point"}
{"text":"The happy hour prices are great, but the food falls a little short. The crispy shrimp croutons have no description, so we asked and the server told us they were fried shrimp. What they actually are is hush puppies with a lot of breading and no discernible shrimp at all. The tuna tartar is all chip and no shrimp. The fish tacos were mediocre. The mussels were the best thing we tried...the broth was rich and delicious. The service was great. The drinks were ok...but I won't be back for happy hour food again any time soon."}
{"text":"I've been to McCormick & Schmick's in a number of cities, and this location was quite good by comparison; very nicely appointed and well staffed.  As someone who doesn't want a side-of-beef for lunch, the sushi and seaweed salad options seemed like a great option.  The Ahi-sashimi/cucumber/seaweed salad was *very* good (and would have been plenty for a light appetite).  I got talked into adding a California roll appetizer to the meal, and was sorry.  The rolls were not fresh (the rice was dry and falling apart).  I'm probably not the typical lunch client at an establishment like this, but I think the portions offered could be better controlled.  Note to establishment: I will happily pay for a very well executed entr√©e that doesn't take two people to bring to the table."}
{"text":"Great place to take the wife on a date. The scallops here are great and the salmon platter i got was one of the best salmon playes i have had in the lower 48. Definitely would reccomend coming here. I also come here when they have thier veteran day special, they definitely take care of the vets."}
{"text":"I dined here yesterday because it was one of the many restaurants participating in \"Charlotte Restaurant Week\". For 30 dollars, a person can get an appetizer, main course and dessert. My waitress was excellent and helpful. Food was great and the wait wasn't too long. A good place to go for a date if you're feel like splurging."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever! McDonald's has a more inviting atmosphere. Wait time was awful. We went on Friday night, sat outside for a few until the roaches asked us to go inside. A lot of roaches in the outside dining area. Then it was one thing after the other, food cold and average, staff cold and average. I suggest not spending the money, too much for nothing. Try anything, and it would be much better than this experience. They need restaurant impossible to come and train the wait staff. Horrible experience! Wasted my time and my money."}
{"text":"WASNT IMPRESSED. I came with my girlfriend and her family for Mother's Day. The server was nice but forgetful. Asked for bread and it took about 15 mins to get it. Ordered appraisers and requested items for our oysters. The oysters sat while we waited for the condiments. Once the food got to us, the general consists was that the door was bland. Needed salt and pepper. NEEDED THEM. I ordered a Crab Cake Benedict, it cost 20$. The cakes were really processed, and small. Over all the quality of the food did not meet up to the cost of said food. Don't consider myself ever coming back."}
{"text":"Anyplace that has PBR on tap is a top restaurant in my book! That said; unless you're there for happy hour, the food is less to be desired. On my recent visit I ate at a table in the bar area with a colleague. Couldn't decide what to get, so the waitress recommended a few selections. Many were heavy sauce infused, which I'm not a fan of. I went with a halibut special. Halibut in my opinion is best pan fried. It came out on a bed of leaks and stuffed inside a puff pastry with a gravy over it. Not my idea of a light dinner."}
{"text":"Although a seafood restaurant chain, McCormick & Schmick's is not only fun to say like a good tongue twister, it's also many steps above Red Lobster.  As you walk in their doors, you feel like you're walking into an upscale restaurant, but it's actually a very casual place, making it comfortable for everyone (although some decorum of dress should be taken).  

What I love about McCormick & Schmick is that although I have a slight idea of what I may be craving for dinner, the menu is ever-changing based on what's \"fresh\" and it could be prepared in a variety of methods.   My seared ahi tuna may be prepared one way during one visit and then a totally different way on another.  I've never had a disappointing entree and love trying new creations on their menu.  

If you're on a budget or just want something light as you meet up with friends after a day of work or shopping (seriously, though--which is tougher?), you can sit at the bar, order drinks and pick food items from their bar menu with prices ranging from $1.95 (yes, one dollar and ninety-five cents) to $3.95.  Granted, the choices don't include one of their delicious seafood entree concoctions, but they're still tasty and filling nonetheless."}
{"text":"We had one of the worst meals ever.  Shame because we gave been here a number to times and it was always good.  The blue cheese wedge was so overdressed it was uneatable.  The calamari was cooked in rancid oil along with  some badly prepared fried vegetables.  My husband's fish was bland and undercooked while the vegetables were over cooked.  I did tell the waitress who cleared that the salad was uneatable and all she said was hmm.  Most of our meal was still on the plates but no one seemed to care.  Won't be back to many great restaurants in town to settle for mediocre."}
{"text":"Always great food and service. All the seafood is flown in fresh daily. The crab cakes are great. The drinks are stiff. They have lots of $10 to $15 lunch specials and happy hour specials as well.

A great place if you like seafood."}
{"text":"Our first visit and we thought everything was delicious!  We enjoyed the Shrimp appetizer, wrapped in bacon and Brie. It was very good! 
My husband chose the McC's seafood trio meal, 
Stuffed shrimp, Fried shrimp, Salmon mashed potatoes and veg.  He loved the salmon. The best he's ever tasted.  I ordered the Crab Legs which came with roasted potatoes.  The legs were cut in half so it made it very easy to eat. 3 full legs gave me plenty of meat. They were delicious! I would have preferred the mashed potatoes over the roasted. 
We finished the meal with a fabulous Creme Br√ªl√©e. 
Our server, Richard, was great. Everyone was really friendly, from the Hostess to the Manager, who stopped by to check on things and remove our very empty dishes.   We always enjoy strolling around the South Side Works after a delicious meal on a beautiful Pittsburgh evening.  We'll be back again soon."}
{"text":"Waitress very nice but only mildly attentive.  Often during the meal we were looking for her and waiting for her.  Ahi appetizer looked / tasted old, not fresh.  Waitress talked us into Charlotte's favorite appetizer, shrimp wrapped in bacon and stuffed with cheese. Big mistake.  It was pretty bad.  Crab appetizer did not taste fresh. Carpaccio was good.  I had swordfish for dinner.  It was tasty.  However, there was at least one other complaint from the table the fish did not taste fresh.  Martinis were Landry sized tiny 3-ounce corporate guideline pour.  All in all, not awful but not worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Stopped in for happy hour with a friend. Food was not good & service was even worse. Ordered a flat bread as well as calamari from hh menu. Flat bread had no taste & was doughy in the middle. Told my friend to send it back but for whatever reason he didn't. Calamari was tasteless & the batter on it wasn't crispy. Waitress never stopped by after initial order unless we flagged her down (bar was not busy) & when we did order our food she didn't seem to know what was going on. Was very disappointed as I've been to their hh before & had hyped it up to my friend."}
{"text":"Very good Happy Hour!  $1.95 fries, $3.95 mussels and spinach dip, $5.95 BV Cabernet - nice!  Sat in the bar - service is spotty but friendly. Will definitely do it again!"}
{"text":"Happy hour deal was amazing. Got a beer, burger, and fries for less than $10 at the bar. The burger was great too"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a Sunday and ordered the lobster roll. First serving was burnt and rock hard.  Second serving was edible but mostly bread.  I cannot recommend."}
{"text":"Bad. Just all around. Ate there a few weeks back.  Food quality was poor, and most items were cold or room temp at best.  Service was non existent.  We were never offered more drinks, plates were not cleared between courses, never asked how things were, water was empty most of the meal, entrees showed up 5 Minutes apart, one dessert never showed up.   We were a party of 14 and it was a decent size bill.  I said something to who I think was a manager and he basically told me it was \"restaurant week\" as an excuse. All I asked for was for him to not add the auto gratuity. When we received the bill, it was not on there.  We still left 15% which I personally think was overly generous but much les than I'd typically leave.  Unfortnslly, when the restaurant charged my card it didn't match what I signed for. I called, received a copy, and come to find out they made some adjustments to the bill but added another $20dollars to the tip.  After an email to the resturaunt (unanswered ) and three phone calls asking them to resolve it i gave up.   Lesson learned....never eat at this chain again.  And FYI if they read this, adding to the tip is stealing !"}
{"text":"lobster and shrimp cocktail was not fresh and contained tiny pieces of lobster and shrimp and too much mango and avocado.  it was not a happy hour special.  it cost $15, needless to say, i was disappointed.
the roasted corn chowder we ordered tasted sour, and when we sent it back, the waitress stated she shouldn't have brought it because it didn't look good.  then why did you bring it?  the mussels in thai broth was very good, but the whole maine lobster was not as delicate and tasty as we would have liked.  the skewer dish was ok, and the bed of cous cous it came on was tasty.  the prices are pretty steep when you don't order off of the happy hour menu, and considering the selection of top notch eateries offering higher quality, value and service,  i would not go back to this particular location.  the waitress was also training another waiter, and went on and on about the whole menu without giving us a chance to respond or ask any questions.  i believe you can train new staff without being rude or inconveniencing your clients.
that is not good service, and nobody wants to be talked at.
unbelievable."}
{"text":"I ordered the fish and chips. It was terrible. The waiter did not know what type of fish it was and guessed cod? Nope. Not cod. The breading was not good either.  My husband ordered the Mahi Mahi. That fish was good but the mashed potatoes were smothered and I mean smothered in some type of sauce that just ruined them. Will I be back.....NEVER. Sorry. I keep going to these upscale restaurants expecting for something spectacular. I should just stick to the popular chains."}
{"text":"Ordered the swordfish and the waiter came back stating they ran out of it.  So I asked for the trout instead and it was awful!!  It was tasteless and the strings beans were hard. Disappointing!"}
{"text":"It took 1 hr to get our food. When we got it everything was cold! They were very apologetic and gave us free dessert, but that didn't fix the bad experience from a so called \" fine dining\" restaurant."}
{"text":"Prices get higher and higher while protein portions get smaller. Food not as good as it was before Landry's bought them."}
{"text":"Negative stars need to exist for establishments like this.

I have contacted the better business bureau about this location, as well as their corporate offices. Alerted them to their accusing us of walking out on our checks when we did not, then charging our card the wrong amount. All this after a four hour miserable wait and experience. I have also reported the manager Dan who has handled this so atrociously that it's astounding he has a job at all. 

Please: do not eat here or support this business. I venture to guess they will be closed soon anyway; especially after the business bureau begins investigating them."}
{"text":"Interesting experience tonight. Been to many Landry's spots, and have always had a reasonably good time. With the exception of the uncomfortable bar stools, tonight was no exception... until I went to close out... 

The nice bartender went to run both my credit and \"Select Club\" card, but their system was not working. After waiting a while, the bartender apologized and called over the manager. After waiting some more, the bartender asked the manager if he could buy me a drink to apologize for the long wait (keep in mind I had already bought two drinks one for $11 and one for $15) - not only did the manager refuse and look at the bartender like he was nuts right in front of me, but he never even acknowledged that I had been waiting at all. A few minutes later the manager gave up, and had the bartender close me out by hand (think carbon paper receipt where they write down all of your private credit card info and have you sign). Not once did the manager apologize for the wait, or even acknowledge the fact that I had been waiting at all; despite the fact that this whole attempt to \"fix the system\" occurred right in front of me on the other side of the bar. I have no problem with the fact their system was down, but disappointed this is the way the manager elected to handle the situation. I applaud the bartender for his efforts to correct the issue - his instincts were correct. The manager's service etiquette is another story... this is not what I would expect at Chili's, let alone McCormick and Schmick's... What started as a great meal, ended with a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Went on a date Wednesday for dollar oysters and shrimp cocktails. Hard to beat buck a shuck. The happy hour menu from 5-7 features a solid list of starters and entrees all for 9 bucks or less. There are plenty of tables in the bar area, so if you can't get a spot at the actual bar don't worry, there should be room at a table.
        We ordered a draft beer and glass of wine from the happy hour list, as well as truffle fries (skip these unless you have a picky eater, very basic), calamari (yum), 6 oysters (still thinking about them) and 6 cocktail shrimp (good size, cocktail sauce was great). 
        All together it was less than $40 with tip. I'll be there next Thursday to try $2.50 oysters Rockefeller. The staff here are very nice and my only complaint is that they may have been slightly understaffed. The bartender who waited on us was busting her a** and we enjoyed her service, but she deserved some extra help to handle the rush."}
{"text":"McCormick and Schmicks is one of my favorite chain restaurants. I enjoy the menu quite a bit for their selection of seafood dishes. However, I feel that the South Side location is often times overlooked. I went here on a Saturday evening. While the wait for The Cheesecake Factory was two hours long, McCormick and Schmicks barely had half the dining room filled. 

While any of the seafood dishes I've gotten were great, one dish I wouldn't recommend is their Filet Mignon. We ordered it during our last visit and it was tiny and overcooked; I wondered how they even let it leave the kitchen because it looked like a piece of charcoal. 

The food and service here are rather consistent and the space is very large. Come here if you love seafood."}
{"text":"We had the U.S.D.A. Choice New York Strip, Apple Miso Sea Bass & Creme Br√ªl√©e. Steak was cooked to my liking and the sea bass was cooked perfectly. The only reason why I didn't give it a 5 star was because their plate presentation looked sloppy, plus the steak only came with half of a tomato and 5 small pieces of over cooked asparagus. 

Customer service was great, but food was a bit over priced! 

Bathroom was decent... this is the only place we went to here in Charlotte with a toilet seat protection."}
{"text":"Ordered the Cedar Roasted Atlantic Salmon.  Tasted amazing, had food poisoning hours later, still struggling to feel better :-/"}
{"text":"I have been to McCormick & Schmick's in Portland and stopped by to meet friends on a trip in NC. It would be nice to have some more vegetarian options on the Happy Hour menu. The drink Talk of the Town, need some improvement/replacement. The hummus and truffle fries were good. 
The ambience was really nice, great location and excellent service at the bar area."}
{"text":"I made dinner reservations for this past Saturday to be assured a table as most other places I checked out were already booked for a pre-show dinner. I have also had this place recommended to me by friends and co-workers. When I arrived after my husband, the entrance staff were very cordial and welcoming. They took me back to the table quickly. One problem is that the inside was very dark. I know they were trying for intimate, but with the dark walls and dark carpeting, it was more cave-like than intimate. I had a hard time trying not to bump into anything on the way back to the table. When I got there, there was only a small candle in the center of the table for illumination. Our waiter, Harley, was nice enough, but he was heavy on the upsell of everything. It wasn't overly busy as there were empty tables when we got there, but it took a while for my drink from the bar to arrive. I kept getting assured that it was coming. When he brought it over, we placed our dinner order. My husband ordered the Maryland Crab Soup as a starter with the promises of something similar to the she-crab soup from the part of Virginia where he grew up. What he got tasted like Campbell's vegetable soup with crab put in just before serving. I could even smell the familiar scent of the veggie soup. The shrimp cocktail had exactly 6 shrimp for like $15 dollars. The number was not on the menu, so it was not worth the charge. 

As our entrees, I ordered the 6oz filet mignon with a side of Gruyere and bacon mashed potato. I was not told that the filet had come with a side of broccoli or I might not have ordered the mash. The broccoli was not quite steamed enough as the middle of the stems were still quite hard. There is crunchy and then there is uncooked. The filet was seasoned pretty well and was cooked to order. My husband ordered the Yuengling fish and chips. The \"chips\" in this case were on the menu as Chesapeake fries. The anticipation was Old Bay seasoning on the fries, at least. We think the seasoning was Penzey's Seafood seasoning, which was okay, but not enough to be called Chesapeake. The fish was simple cod in a beer batter. Not really worth the $19 sticker price.

There was a gentleman in a suit traversing the room asking this table and that how things were going. He passed by our table three or four times and never once spoke to us.

One good thing was that they got us out of there in time to get to the theater for our show. Although others may have had a nice experience here, we really did not and will not recommend this restaurant to our out-of-town friends."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the veterans dinner that the restaurant offered to all vets and we want to say that the food and service was first rate.  My wife also had some flyers for Horses for Heros in Las Vegas and the manager was nice enough to have them out for the patrons.  I, a Vietnam veteran, want to thank you for this evening, it was perfect."}
{"text":"We had a great night! I came for a friends birthday dinner on Saturday night and it was an awesome experience! We ad fast service and delicious food!

Our waitress was fabulous! Her name was Tenille and she handled our big party like a pro! She offered great suggestions for drinks and meals. 

We had no problem with parking and our table was ready when we arrived!

For starters I had a Lemon Drop martini, super delicious! Just make sure you can handle it because it's full of liquor! YUM! Also the lobster bisque was great. It's so cool how they serve it. They bring out the base of the soup and then once it's at the table they pour the bisque over it. Super creamy and flavorful! I could go for another bowl right now!

For my entree, I had the stuffed shrimp. It's Lump Crab Stuffed Shrimp with a side of veggies and  Red Pepper White Cheddar Mash. The crab stuffing is delicious! Full of huge pieces of crab meat and the shrimp is cooked to perfections!

The veggies are fresh but what acts as a perfect pair are those Red Pepper White Cheddar Mash potatoes. They are light and full of cheese with a slight kick after each bite. They literally have my mouth watering right now! 

Everything that everyone had looked delicious and I look forward to going back again!"}
{"text":"Oct. 20, 2012
My wife and I have been to M&S many times in the past 7 years.  The attraction of fresh fish and seafood is a welcome feature for 2 seniors from New England now living in Charlotte.  Our most recent meal at M&S will be our last.   

The two fish main dishes were only ok but the side dish of coleslaw was disgusting in taste.  The dressing tasted like a mixture of window putty and paste.  I dare the kitchen staff to sample it and swallow a forkful.   The \"chips\" or French fries that were served with the Fish and Chips were soggy and cold and lacked any seasoning what-so-ever.  The fish was tasty but the pieces were shaped like large round beer battered chunks rather than the usual fish pieces that I always order.

The service is probably the most disappointing.  On the table we only needed 2 place settings and the remaining two settings were never remove resulting in a cramped and cluttered table.  The first course dishes were never removed and this added to the already cluttered table.   The server removed my wife's wine glass  while still containing a fair pour of wine.  My water was never refilled and I had to replace it with my wife's water glass while the server watched with no attempt to rectify the situation for the rest of the meal.

In today's economy, an establishment with mid-to-high-end pricing, cannot continue to compete for the limited dining dollar when service and quality is no longer a reflection of the the claimed mission statement.

Thank but no thanks, my dining dollars will be spent elsewhere in the future.   

Dr. Chuck"}
{"text":"Food was perfect here, really excellent. Service leaves something to be desired... Our waiter was kinda weird and not intuitive or instinctual at all like a good waiter ought to be. Kept leaving without taking our orders. I mean, it was like a $500 check for four of us (champagne) so... kinda strange to not have top notch service.

Still the atmosphere was nice and dinnering was wonderful here. Off the strip a little so Catch a cab back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in the service that we received tonight. It was not busy and we were a party of 3 with only 2 of us eating. Pretty easy table to take care of. We were sat pretty quickly but then waited for 10+ minutes for a server. I got up to find someone and immediately the manager came over. Jenna was super sweet and we reset our attitude and would give it another chance. 
Our server wasn't around a lot after we got our food but did check on us right when we got our food and when we were half way done. My husband had a filet and had finished his wine and wanted to get another glass. So when the server stopped by when we were halfway done he ordered another glass. We waited and it didn't come. My husband went to the bathroom and while he was gone Jenna had stopped and asked if he needed another glass.  I let her know we were waiting on a glass. She said she would check on it. Wait ANOTHER 10 minutes and the server stopped by and asked about his wine and apologized that he hadn't brought it. My husband was eating the last 2 bites of his steak and explained he wanted it to drink with his steak.  We canceled the glass of wine and it got taken off. 
The server was very nice but delivery of service was terrible. We are in town for a nice weekend checking out Charlotte and just wanted an easy, quiet dinner and paid over $130 for terrible service. I usually try to avoid chain restaurants and I think this will remind me why I don't eat at them. Overall, we would never return and will let the Marriott where we are staying know how terrible the service was."}
{"text":"What a mediocre experience. Several times we have walked past M&S on our way into the mall and said, oh we should go there for dinner. That dinner finally happened a couple of Fridays ago. 

Things started out fine. The host was friendly and we were seated in a cute little booth behind the bar, which offered a nice sense of privacy which is often lost in restaurants trying to cram in too many tables and forcing patrons to sit basically on top of each other (side rant over). That was about the end of the pleasantries.  

We sat for an unusually long time before someone came to take our drink order. I was willing to let that go and start the beginning of a nice meal with the husband. We just wanted to start with a cocktail and work our way from there. Keep in mind, the place was not busy and it was always my understanding that waiters liked having table with more alcohol on their tabs- ours seemed frustrated that we were not ready/willing to order our entire meal at this point. 

Anyway, as we wait for our drinks we decided to order a \"jumbo\" shrimp cocktail to split as an appetizer, which we did when she arrived with our drinks. It came out super quick and had to have been the smallest shrimp I have seen in a long time. I understand that things happen and you can't always control the size but these babies were, well baby sized. 

Somewhere in this mix we also ordered our main meals. As we quickly finished our app, since there wasn't much to it, we also finished our first drink (as well as the accompanying water). And then we waited, and waited and waited until I finally stood up to go and find the waitress who suddenly appeared at that time- with our food. 

Now I am left sitting with no drink and my food on the table and had to decide, do I go ahead and eat my steak w/out my wine or do I wait for my drink and let me food get cold. I went with the former, which proved to be a good choice b/c it took an unreal amount of time for the waitress to return with our wine and then retreat to not be seen again until it was time to pay the check. 

I decided to get up and use the ladies and at that point saw that our waitress was busy sitting in another booth with a co-worker gossiping, which is where I can only imagine she was the entire time since the restaurant wasn't very busy at all. 

It was such a disappointing experience. Shame on me for not complaining while we were there, but I recall a manager coming to the table to ask how things were and the response being \"the food is fine.\" which I would have thought was a sign of a problem. 

There are too many other good places around to go back and give this place a lot of my hard earned money for such a headache in return."}
{"text":"Perfect place for a rare chance to have lunch alone with my sister from out of town. I made reservations online easily and was greeted warmly by the hostess. Indoor and outdoor dining were available. Due to soggy weather we dined indoors at a booth next to the courtyard. Samuel our waiter was very courteous and knowledgeable about the menu when we asked a few questions. He served us efficiently and promptly. Our appetizers and entrees were delicious and prepared exactly as we had expected. The small plates were just the right amount of food and were at the proper temperature. The warm sourdough bread was a wonderful complement to our meals. I've dined at other locations of McCormack and Schmidt but fond this one to be my best experience. The ambiance was relaxed and comfortable without the stuffiness of other locations. I definitely look forward to dining here again in the near future."}
{"text":"Well, we just went for a quick small bite and drinks.  Service took forEVER despite not being *that* crowded.  Appetizers we're \"OK\", on par with Applebees.  Beer menu was junk, had a mixed drink instead. You really have to work at screwing up an Old Fashioned.  Probably not going back unless forced at gunpoint."}
{"text":"I'm sorry but the food was under season no taste at all. I was very disappointed but thank you so much for honored the verterans."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch on a Sunday, since a friend gave us a gift card. We had coconut shrimp that were delicious, a burger, side of potatoes, and the grits (which were amazing!). The blueberry tea (non-alcoholic, can't remember the actual name) was soooo good, too. Service was good and the food came quickly and fresh. We will return!"}
{"text":"I was there this evening. We ordered the ribeye 15 minutes later our server comes back to tell us they ran out of ribeye. I ordered a filet medium... An hour later our server comes back and says your food should come out shortly(didn't apologize for the long wait). 15 minutes later my steak comes out. It came out medium rare which is fine with me but that was the driest piece of meat I've ever had! Seemed like it was under the heat lamp for a long time because even the meat juices on the plate were dry. I understand if the restaurant was packed but there was only three tables out. The restaurant was empty."}
{"text":"Great dining experience. This place has a very nice ambience. The food is fantastic. Super fresh oysters and everything else. The service is top notch and its perfect for a holiday dinner or just a night out. I will be back next time I'm in Carolina from California. Matter of fact I might try the one in Roseville, CA now thanks to this location. Bravo Zulu!"}
{"text":"Really great for St. Patricks Day!  I'll have to say for a chain, the food was pretty good.  The corned beef sliders were awesome and the mahi mahi was definitely tasty. Although, I wonder where they get that fish from in Charlotte..."}
{"text":"I generally prefer to patronize a locally-based restaurant whenever possible, but from time-to-time I don't mind coming here depending on the circumstances. M&S is really not bad for a corporate chain.

I have eaten at this location several times for business lunches and service has always been quick and efficient.  The food is a-ok, but nothing really outstanding.  They do offer some pretty decent lunch specials.   

We have also eaten dinner at this location before when we were in the area for a Sunday show at the Blumenthal.  Our server at dinner was extremely helpful and took good care of us."}
{"text":"They have a great happy hour special. Cheapish drinks (well, mixed and some beer), and discounted apps.

We had the shrimp app, the fish tacos, the ahi bites, and the hummus. We really liked the shrimp and tacos, but the hummus and ahi were a miss. The hummus came with fried pita that was burnt and soaking wet with oil, and the ahi was... well just terrible (fishy, overcooked, gross). The tacos could have used some spice, but the shrimp was great.

I would go back. Other menu items looked really good too."}
{"text":"While I do expect more from a place like this that generally has a good reputation, my expectations are still reasonable. Unfortunately, this restaurant did not meet any of of them. (I must note that it was quite crowded for lunch, with many downtowners celebrating the Holidays with coworkers.) We had a reservation, so we were sat immediately - sadly, that was the highlight of our experience. It was extremely loud with so many people AND there was loud music in the background, too. We had a very difficult time hearing each other, which means that we had a very difficult time hearing our server. I don't understand why, after *several times* telling him that we couldn't hear him, he wouldn't raise his voice. It was frustrating, so we all just kind of smiled and nodded when he came by. He was clearly new and seemed nervous, but he made some pretty glaring mistakes. #1 The 3 tables around us that were seated after us got their drinks and table bread first. And when we DID get our bread, he forgot the butter. Then he disappeared for a long time and didn't reappear until he brought the apps. By the time he got the butter, we were over the bread and into the apps. We got the Mushroom Flatbread and it was bland. The only \"flavor\" came from the sparse sprinking of mushrooms. It needed seasoned badly, or some herbs, or something! We also got the fried calimari, which was OK. They weren't crispy and there were other fried things mixed in with it, which I thought was odd. And for a huge plate, they only gave us like 1 tablesoon of sauce. It wasn't worth saying anything because it probably would have taken forever to get more! Next he brought out salads. I got the walnut & greens salad, but when it arrived, it was missing the blue cheese. When I asked the server if it's supposed to have blue cheese, he answered by telling me that he could go get some for me. I wanted to know if it was supposed to come with it because if not, I wasn't going to request it. Again, though, I had a difficult time hearing him. My entree was not good. I was so excited about it, too! I got the Coast to Coast Tuna - \"west coast\" was tuna tartar with a hunk of avocado and 3 drops of something orange with no flavor. The \"east coast\" was seared tuna with some kind of soy/sweet sauce/glaze. The west coast tuna frankly sucked. I didn't \"get\" the avocado and the texture was way too similar to the tuna, so everything just kind of smooshed around in your mouth. There was no flavor at all. Plus, I had to spit out a bite I took because it had a \"tough\" piece that felt like what it feels like when you're eating chicken and you get a piece of that white tendon. I did not eat the last (and biggest) piece because I could see the white tough flesh and knew that I'd end up spitting that out, too. The \"east coast\" wasn't horrible, but there were some issues: Instead of letting the flavor of the sear and sauce speak, each piece was topped with a thin sliver of jalepeno (I think?), a tiny parsley leaf, and then a tiny drop of something red. I didn't get it. Those little extras didn't add anything, so I just removed them before eating. The sauce was yummy, though. In the middle of the plate was what looked like some kind of flat fried bread. It was just bare...sitting in the middle of the plate like it wasn't \"complete.\" Nothing about the dish made sense.

Overall, this was a bad experience. I'm glad I didn't pay for it!"}
{"text":"So I mentioned how much I like the happy hour here for food. The quality of food is amazing for $5.95 and less. Come here from 3pm to ??? Trust me. But other then that, the food is ok. There is a pecan crusted Halibut that is very very good! It comes with a mango salsa that adds a citrusy contrast to the salty deep fried Halibut. You will not be disappointed. 

WARNING!!!!: One time I came here for lunch and I saw a mouse run into the back! I'M SERIOUS!! I told the manager and he gave me a free meal. I asked the employees if they see a lot of mice and they replied, \"NO COMMENT\". I've been here only for drinks after that. If you don't believe me ask anyone that works here.

But if you don't mind the mice, then the happy hour menu is pretty good. I haven't found any chopped up mice in my food yet! haha"}
{"text":"Don't let this place fool you. Looks nice on the outside
And Inside. But looks is about all it's got going for it. 

Went in on a Tuesday night around 8:00, restaurant was empty. Waited 10 minutes for a hostess to greet and seat us. 

Server was friendly but I could tell he was in the weeds. Short stops at the table. Tried ordering whole meal at
Once and he didn't let us. Presumably because he was in a hurry. 

Ordered clam chowder and crab cake for app. Clam chowder was decent. Crab cake was lukewarm, full of filler, and tasted a few days old. Had to ask for bread several times, it didn't come until I was almost done with my soup. 

For entree I got a filet medium rare and a side of mushroom Boursin mash. My guest got crab stuffed shrimp.  Her entree came out first. Mine 10 mins later, and my steak was not medium rare. It was completely rare. Still cool in the center. I ate it anyways. It wasn't horrible. She liked her shrimp. My side of
Mash never even came out. 

Won't be back."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in Pittsburgh, hands down. The food and drinks are always great. Nice for dinner as well."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Downtown location on several ocassions thanks to different business meeting.  Going on my own dime was timed to Happy Hour accordingly.  This particular location (Southside Works!) is easily spot-able from the street and the bar area while a tad crammed still felt welcomed.  This review is strictly based on a bar-seating and Happy Hour Pricing experience, so take it with a monetary grain of salt.

Drink specials were out of this Universe.  The quality of the drinks made, the grade of the liquors used, and the balance between mixers and alcohol was perfect.  I had their Hard Lemonade (which packed a punch!) and the Mellon themed drink.  I did get to sip the Peach Puree feature drink as well.  All three of them were an excellent value at their price brackets and service was super speedy.  On the food front, I still can't get over how cheap their Happy Hour specials are.  You get decent sized portions, Mc&S caliber food, and quick service.  It definitely can't be beat.

While I'm all about trying new places ... next time I'm back in the Southside Works and my friends want to do Happy Hour, this place has my vote, we can always dabble with the dinner or dessert location, haha."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place but it comes up short every time for the following reasons:

1.  The food is overpriced for the quality.  
2.  I feel as though the atmosphere is stuffy"}
{"text":"We stopped in here at about 8:15pm on a Saturday and they were pretty dead.

Sat us a a cute little two seater table.  -1 Star: the chairs were uncomfortable.  Not something that you want to sit in while having a long dinner.

We started with the Steamed Mussels with a Spicy Thai Curry Sauce.  The sauce was a delicious creation.  The mussels were cooked perfectly.  -1 star: the mussels were gritty.  ugh!

My husband and I both had the Holiday Mixed Grill: Petite Filet Oscar, Grilled Salmon, Jumbo Shrimp & Sea Scallop, Rosti Potato, Sauteed Spinach and Salsa Cruda.

This was great because you could sample so much without having to dive into a main course.  The Petite Filet Oscar was my absolute favorite, as the meat was cooked to a perfect \"medium\" and when you cut it, it was like butter!  The salmon and sauteed spinach were fantastic.  The Rosti Potato was delicious as well.

My husband and I watch all the cooking shows, including Hell's Kitchen, and you know if you watch Hell's Kitchen, that you better have the same coloring on your scallops, especially if its going to the same table.  Well, I am not a fan of scallops, but I am always willing to try them.  My husband had a wonderful sear on his scallop, while mine barely had any color at all.  IMO: It probably could have been cooked a little longer.  I'm not a chef, so I'm not going to dock a star for this.  But it was definitely noticed.

Our waiter, \"Marty Funkhouser\" (if you get that reference, kudos to you!) was really great.  No clue what his real name is, but if you go there and find the guy that reminds you of Funkhouser, you will be taken care of.

I think I would only come back for Happy Hour, since I work in Howard Hughes and its right around the corner.  Not sure if I would come back for dinner, even though we really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Overall just a bad night at MS.  Arrived with 6:00 reservation and had to wait to be seated.  Shrimp Kiss appetizer was overcooked and dry - drastically needs a sauce.  Then waited an additional hour for our meal to arrive.  We had 8:00 symphony tickets and after receiving our meal at 7:30, we had to rush to eat.  And to top it all off, my husband's fish was horribly overcooked and he had to get tartar sauce just to get it own.  After all of that, we were presented with a bill for over $100 - nothing comped.  I've never spent $100 for such a bad experience before.  However, General Manager did contact us and apologized and offered to make it right.  So I guess everyone just has a bad night from time to time and we will be back."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey and the food is just o.k. I have eaten there a few times and every time I came away thinking it wasn't worth the money. There are way better options in Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"On a Wednesday night nonetheless, made reservations for 7pm around 5 that evening, only to arrive 5 minutes before 7 and told it would be a few minutes. 20 minutes later............ Now we were finally seated.  Oh waiter.  Oh waiter.  Oh waiter.  He shows, we wait another 10 minutes enjoying eachother's conversation before our water glasses get filled.  Orders taken, appetizers arrive, soups & salads delivered (at this point waters are all empty), then main course arrives.   We ask for more water, as we are coming to the end of the main, water arrives.   Not the level of service you would expect from this type of an establishment.   My meal was meh.  The oysters were delicious.  Overall experience was lack luster.   It was like driving a Pinto when you should at least have been driving a Cadillac.  Just an FYI, Ruth Chris is less than a block away."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience in Charlotte tonight. Randi's service was superb. Attentive but not hovering. Party of four enjoyed their selections, the atmosphere and the service."}
{"text":"Expensive crap for lazy idiots with corporate accounts."}
{"text":"Great! I am a veteran and just got a call from the restaurant to invite me for a free meal on Veterans Day celebrating on 11/5. Whoever call you to offer you a free meal? Kudos to McCormick & Schmick's!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The steak at this location is better the branches in SoCal that I have tried.  Good service too."}
{"text":"What poor standards this location must have. We decided to start a new tradition in traveling to Las Vegas for Thanksgiving and wanting to ensure a great Thanksgiving meal we made reservations at McCormick & Schmick, what a mistake choosing McCormick & Schmick was.

We arrived at 4:45 pm for a 5:00 pm reservation and were ignored for the first 5 minutes completely. Finally when someone decided to come back up to the front they said it would be a few minutes. We were taken to a table on time but the table we were seated at had one booth too close to the table and the other way too far away and the seats nor table moved. We asked for a table with normal spacing and she stated it would be quite some time and she could take us back to the front to wait, this should have told us something to start. We did keep the uncomfortable table seating.

They served cold Thanksgiving meal, we sent our food back twice as we wanted to enjoy a hot Thanksgiving meal, this never happened. Three strikes and you are out. We ended up eating our luke warm meals but of course they did not serve us the the dressing with the meal, must have forgot according to the server.

The manager never asked us how our meal was, did not care I guess. The server offered a slice of pie but we declined as after the disappointing meal we just  consumed we did not want to take any chances.

Poor Management at this location.

The server was O.K. but don't look for superior service here if that's what you are looking for.

I would not recommend this location to anyone."}
{"text":"Went for late lunch last Friday. waitress seemed uninformed when we asked about fish preparations & didn't let us know that lunch chilean sea bass cost $32!!! Unreal for lunch portion. Most grievous was the seared ahi tuna that was cold tasteless and a bit dry. Seemed like it was prepped earlier refrigerated and then served. Sashimi was equally lackluster. Will not return."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend decided to try this place for restaurant week this past Friday. While the restaurant was very beautiful, it was EMPTY. There were probably about 3 tables seated when we were there. We came around 4:30 though, so I figured maybe after 5 people would start coming in. No. This place is way too pricy and you barely get anything with your portions. Firstly, there weren't many great options for appetizers. We both got the New York carpaccio that was okay but nothing you could've made at home.  We both ordered the \"stuffed\" shrimp and steak with veggies. This was a joke. You got 3 pieces of shrimp and 5 pieces of already cut steak. And the rest of it was thrown vegetables on your plate of zucchini and squash. The \"stuffed\" shrimp wasn't stuffed. The crab immediately fell off when biting into the shrimp and some of it was already off when the plate was served to us. We got dessert and I had a chocolate pie, which tasted like a frozen candy bar that you could barely put your fork through because it was so hard. My boyfriend got some kind of upside down walnut pie which was actually good with ice cream. That was about the only good thing out of this whole experience. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Our grand total was $75 dollars for a mediocre meal that you could get anywhere or make it home. Nothing impressive, don't let the looks of the restaurant fool you. Service and staff were great, though. The only reason I even give the restaurant 1 star is because of the nice staff."}
{"text":"Excellent location for happy hour! Great selection of drink choices and food at an affordable price considering the prices of their regular food items. I go here frequently after work with coworkers as we work close. Love the outside seating when the weather is nice. Servers are very professional and have yet to recover bad service here."}
{"text":"I was very excited to come to this location and enjoy some great seafood it right down the block from Ruth Chris which I bypassed for this and I didn't enjoy my expierience. I had a not so great waiter as he was not very attentive and, seemed to be upset that I was seated at one of his tables and at one point heard him mumble under his breathe and, then said it's because of CIAA weekend and they had given him another table and it was so busy. It was not very crowded when I went as it was an hour before close. Well I ordered the Twin Atlantic Lobster tails with Lobster Mashed Potatoes and then the waiter says they ran out because of CIAA weekend, so I chose the saut√© mushroom spinach which happened to be good, but my lobster was cold as well as undercooked and I sent back to the kitchen. They were smaller then I imagined but for $35 I suppose that was average. It was bland with no real flavor to it. I ordered the strawberry mint palmer which came out after my food. I was by myself and I thought I would have a great dinner some but I was disappointed while visiting this location in Charlotte"}
{"text":"Had lunch here while going to Speed Street and the crispy fish tacos were the best I have ever had.  I don't know how they can even get the fish so crispy.  Service was excellent and friendly and nobody minded us wearing t-shirts and sneakers.  Our party also had the grilled salmon, which was cooked perfectly.  They are in the process of a remodel but seemed to have it neatly kept."}
{"text":"Great service and DELICIOUS flounder entree. It was wild caught and perfectly cooked. I'm super picky too. They also have amazing happy hour. $5 poke and $9 ahi tuna. I suggest sitting on patio. Way better than other McCormick locations. Need I say more?"}
{"text":"Really nice atmosphere, great service, food decor really lovely, tasty def will come back for them calamari its was heaven yeah it was a little pricey but got the good calamari"}
{"text":"Best happy hour, and most economical in town. Great service. Friendly service. Nice bar bites, too."}
{"text":"Terrible experience with the food and management who was no help.  First steak they forgot my cheese crust so it was added but my steak was well done not medium and the second one was not seasoned at all... blah

Management mocked me when he came over and said you ate one piece must not be too bad

Never coming back"}
{"text":"No matter the day, time or year they seriously disappoint. I've been a laundry club member which allows me to collect reward points for certain restaurants this location being one. Here at McCormicks they constantly fail to please me.  My Togo orders are always wrong, I'm never greeted when I enter the establishment. The waitstaff just look at me and make me feel uncomfortable. The food has gone down in taste. I'm tired of giving them low scores on their survey. I'm tired of the manger giving me a credit for my food. It's just sad. I use to love their blackened Alfredo I would substitute the chicken for shrimp. But it's just not good anymore ."}
{"text":"First time trying decided to get a lunch grilled chicken salad. No dressing no fork. And found a hair on my chicken. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"Shrimp Kisses are a winner

Steak and Lobster was perfection    seasoning, flavor and temperature was super!

TO finish off any meal the chocolate sack was and maybe the best dessert in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I'm here for this Super-Amazing Happy Hour!!! Man!!! When I tell you both the menu and drinks are outstanding!!! And the price is right!!! Had the exquisite Aioli (A1) Burger made to order. I'm going to have to rate this as one of the absolute top burgers in Charlotte. And for the price you definitely can't beat it!!! The servers that I've had have all been very attentive with superb hospitality. This is why I keep coming back."}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't been here before for happy hour.  The menu is fantastic, the drinks are even better; they food was fresh, hot amazing treats.  The bartender Kevin was exceptionally attentive.  I couldn't have been happier and can't wait to stop again.  It was wonderful and if you try it you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Brought a group of colleagues and clients to M&S for a business dinner.  Probably totalled about 20 of us or so.  Having been to M&S's before I knew what to expect and figured they could handle a large group of us well.

And I was right.  Service was attentive and prompt.  They gave us a mostly private room (another long table on the other side of the room) and let us be our boistrous, noisy group selves.

Food was delicious.  We ordered several large appetizer platters for the table and everyonoe ordered their own entrees.  As usual when at M&S, I had the salmon, which was light, flaky and delicious!

I give these guys 4 Stars for their service and taking care of such a large group with great poise.  The food was delicious and we never felt rushed (we spent probably 30 minutes after eating just sitting around talking) or unattended."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to the SOUTH SIDE location last night looking forward to the Wednesday Happy Hour special of $1 oysters.  We got there at 6, went in and grabbed 2 seats at the bar.  The bar was reasonably busy but the restaurant was dead.  

The bartender immediately came over offering drinks.  We ordered 2 draft beers and asked about the Happy Hour menu.  She acted almost turned off when she realized we were only there for HH.  We ordered Bruschetta for $2.95, Mussels for $4.95 and a plate of 10 oysters- 5 Blue Points and 5 Choptank.  

The food came out nice & quick and we were set.  The Blue Points were big, meaty, sweet & delicious.  The Choptanks were small but still tasty.  The Bruschetta was a bit confusing with diced tomatoes mixed in with halved cherry tomatoes.  It proved a feat just to keep it on the baguette slices.  The Mussels were more of a 'small plate' than a full order and they were boring and bland- cooked in butter & garlic.  With all the better restaurants going to fancier more complex tasting but just as simple dishes- we were not impressed.         

Noticing my beer was empty, the batender offered another.  She was quick to offer drinks at the bar... but as we looked around we noticed just about every other table in the bar area loaded with empty glasses and patrons all seeming like they were ready for more.  There was a stretch of about 20 minutes where not a single server came around to check on those tables.  Thank god we got seats at the bar.  We couldn't tell if it was the bartender's job to wait those tables or not, but we couldn't tell who was responsible for this area and it was definitely neglected.  

Our plates were empty but the Blue Points were so good I was going to order 10 more- when I find good seafood I usually go for seconds...  But 10 minutes go by and our empty plates are still in front of us, I decided to just interrupt the bartender and pay our 'passage'.  

We would go back... but we learned our lesson- get seats at the bar, order drinks and all the oysters we're going to eat, then leave.  Don't expect good service, cause you're not going to find it here at the bar.

{"text":"This review pertains to their happy hour.

The Skinny: cheap so-so bar food eats (3) service - is pretty efficient for a bar (3) value: better than Mickey D's... yes.Better than In-n-Out, not quite. (3).

We've been jonesing to check out their happy hour for a while. Although you need to make a minimum beverage purchase of $3.50/person, they'll happily charge you $3.50 for a diet soda. Sigh! At least the soda is bottomless. We chose to go on Tini night where they have a special martini for $5.

To summarize, I did take pics of the happy hour specials so you can take a look at the pricing. We ordered the cheeseburger (comes with fries, $3), the grilled corn ($2) , the onion rings($2), the fried fish sliders ($4) and the blackened fish tacos($4).

The cheeseburger was okay, not great. It was standard fare with the patty being a little more on the dry side and having a little too much char. Better than Mickey D's but not nearly as good as In-N-Out. Fries were okay.

The onion rings were really greasy. As you can see in the picture, they were so greasy and soggy, the batter wasn't staying on the onion.

The fried fish sliders were also a no-go. The batter was too thick, the tartar dressing too heavy. Presentation was unappetizing as the cook left huge finger imprints on the squashed bread (see pic). Ugh! No thanks!

The blackened fish tacos were alright but weren't blackened by any means. The fish was a little on the dry side and there was very little in terms of condiment on top of the taco. It really needed more lime to enhance the flavours.

The dish of the night - grilled corn with chipotle. The corn on the cob was sweet, delicious and the best thing we had all night.

Overall, not a bad deal but the food isn't that great. I wouldn't go out of my way to try this place again."}
{"text":"Happy hour here is great! I have ZERO complaints on any of the food I've had here. The seafood mushrooms are amazing and bruschetta is a must."}
{"text":"Came here for my mom's 60th. Party of 5. Very good food. Our server was fantastic."}
{"text":"Marginal. Delay in seating despite many empty tables. 60 min from seating until delivery of food. Unacceptable. 

Waiter, Chancellor, was kind & responsive...but can't overcome the mediocrity of management & execution."}
{"text":"I visited on Fathers Day with my mom, so I was expecting a wait of at least 30 minutes. We decided to sit outside on their patio and the hostess seated us immediately! Our server Lori was amazing, she recommended the perfect drink for us the Preseco Sangria. 
The food was amazing! My mom and I ordered the crab dip and the scallops as our appetizers. We thoroughly enjoyed the pita chips that came with the crab dip, they were perfectly seasoned and the crab dip was orgasmic. My entree was the Lobster Crab Cakes, my mom had the Lobster stuffed Shrimp with the lobster mashed potatoes.
We thoroughly enjoyed our meal today. I recommend this place to anyone that loves seafood and doesn't mind spending the money."}
{"text":"Great dinner for my husband's birthday. Surprised him with his friends and family! 

I originally scheduled dinner at Ruth Chris, but they couldn't accommodate my party. We had 18 people and McCormick remained super flexible. We arrived around 715. There were very few people there around that time. Which was surprising for a Saturday evening. 

Our table was ready for us when we arrived and the waitress was available and knowledgeable! The entire table enjoyed all of their food. I had steak with asparagus and sweet potatoes. I also had some delicious Brussel Sprouts. They were so gooood. For dessert, I had some delicious bread pudding. Not sure if there was alcohol in it, but the icing had a nice caramel and rum taste. It was so good. 

The only downside was that they were out of crab when we went. On a Saturday night, out of crab, at a seafood restaurant? #thingsthatMakeYouGoHmm"}
{"text":"All I heard was that this place was fancy schmancy and wearing jeans wasn't appropriate. Whatever. I wore jeans and used a gift card. Win.

My boyfriend and I ordered a buttload of food and while it was decent, it wasn't great. There were many things we wanted to order but they didn't have it.

Our waiter was a moron. He had two tables (ours included) and ran - literally sprinted - back and forth from the kitchen yet didn't have any plates in his hands. Our glasses were empty most of the time and we asked for the dessert menu as our food arrived because we knew we wouldn't see him again for who knows how long.

I'll never eat here again. I don't care how amazing their happy hour deals are. For what they charge and how crappy their service is, I rather eat at a Red Lobster."}
{"text":"We came by for lunch/brunch on a Sunday. The atmosphere is great and cozy. We had the stuffed salmon, fish n chips (which is cod) and upside down apple pie. Every thing was delish. We loved our waitress who was very attentive and knowledgeable. We will definitely come back"}
{"text":"Food is excellent! Filet Mignon is the best thing to order. The steak and lobster is decent. The steak that comes with it isn't the best but for the price it is relative. Shrimp Kisses and Garlic Crab Mashed Potatoes are excellent. Overall always a great experience."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance but not worth the money.. we had the stuffed shrimp and the seafood trio... my boyfriend had a top shelf long iced tea.. that was wrong twice. We had to ask the waiter his name. No one spoke until we spoke to them . $140 for what... NOTHING REALLY. could went to red lobster and balled out.."}
{"text":"Great food.  Much better pricing and value that Casino restaurants.  Worth the trip off the strip.  I love the separated booth/rooms which offer semi private space and the ability to hear each other talk.

Wait staff was very knowledgeable and courteous."}
{"text":"We've been to this chain of restaurants several times in various cities. So when we visited Las Vegas this week we made a reservation and had dinner at mccormicks and schmecks tonight.  We had the prefixe dinner.  Soup ( clam chowder) was great.  But the entree (salmon) was below our expectations. We asked for medium well and got medium rare.  It had to go back.  We got the same piece of salmon back and it was well done.  It came with zucchini pesto noodles which were so-so.  Waited more than 15 minutes for our desert. In the end, we like mccormicks and schmecks but won't return to their establishment on las Vegas."}
{"text":"Went for happy hour yesterday.  New seasonal drinks with strawberries was refreshing . Got the calamari and oyster Rockefeller.  Very good. Same happy hour menu for years,  maybe change things up."}
{"text":"One big problem is the sewer smell.  They keep saying they just fixed it and it is going to take a few days to clear out.  However they told us that 4 months ago!!!!!"}
{"text":"Calamari for an appetizer was just ok.  I've had way better and not as expensive.  Although my swordfish was good, my husband had steak & lobster that he was not happy about to say the least.   Thought there was something wrong with the lobster not being cooked right.  Well I guess he was right because several hours later he was very sick. 

Onto dessert ...  I got the chocolate truffle cake.  It was good until half way through there was paper in it !!!  My husband had some type of pecan pie that was still frozen in the middle !

Will never ever go back."}
{"text":"Had chicken capers, mash potatoes and Chinese broccoli. White chocolate blueberry cheesecake it had the worst tasting crust on a cheesecake I have ever had (this brought the rating down to 3)."}
{"text":"I have forever labeled this place as 'hit or miss', and on this recent visit they were definitely hitting!  We had a group of 7 and everyone was very pleased with the service and the food.  I wish I could remember the young man's name that served us, he was very patient as we all were quite indecisive:-)  The fried green tomatoes, and salmon over veggies were seasoned and cooked to perfection.....yummy!  I must go back to try that chocolate martini......"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time on New Year's Day. It's now one of my favorite spots to eat in South Park. The food and service was excellent. I ordered the buttermilk fried shrimp and it was wonderful! Their slaw was on point too. It was so creamy, with just the right amount of crunch and so delicious! My sister and I were going to split a dessert, but were too stuffed by the end of the meal to even order the chocolate box. I'll definitely come back next time and will try to save some room for the sweet stuff."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Las Vegas locations for a very good business dinner.  Quiet; excellent service and reliably very good food.  We had a party of five - got a quiet corner area away from the crowd (YELP reservation scores again!).  Yes, you can spend more in LV, but for overall value this is hard to beat."}
{"text":"I used to have better feeling for McCormick and Schmick, as the food quality used to be better, and a bit more 'unique' feeling.  I fear that M&S has become more of a chain, with less adventurous menu options and food quality - a shame in my mind.  I hope they can reclaim some of their more unique and higher end feel, but for now M&S is just run of the mill to me."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for an awesome happy hour from 5-7 every day!  (I'm only reviewing the happy hour not the rest of the restaurant) Voted best happy hour nationwide and can totally see why. Great margaritas - all their juices are freshly squeezed and that makes all the difference in the world - so good!  We thought the burgers and tacos would be mini sized since they were so cheap but they came large and in charge.  Felt like we ordered one too many plates since we weren't accounting for the large sizes.  Can't wait to go again :-)"}
{"text":"I would give a lower star if I could. My in-laws picked this place for Thanksgiving. Our food was blah cafeteria tasting food which was disappointing considering their prices and since it is supposedly upscale dining. BUT the worst part was having them steal $25 more than the amount I authorized once my card was charged and having NO ONE from the entire Landry's company fix this!!! Yes, I called the restaurant many times only to be told someone will call back and I even called Landry's corporate phone number which is a pathetic voicemail that no one responds to. I even e-mailed Landry's corporate from their website with no response from them.  Todd (the general manager) FINALLY called me back and was a total jerk about it. I'm sorry, who inconvenienced who?! I have gone to the lengths of disputing the whole charge now. DON'T GO HERE! They will steal your money AND be rude about it. And the food it completely not worth it."}
{"text":"We stopped in for dinner on Friday evening, it has the ambiance of a mid to upper scale restaurant. 
The wait staff seemed to be on top of things or so we thought, they seemed to be a little disorganized and it was hard to tell exactly who was waiting on your table as we had 3 or 4 back and forth. 
We asked for bread...got no bread, asked for water \"no ice\" got a glass full of b ice with the water, ordered sweet tea, go unsweetened tea.
As for the food...this is the reason for the 2 stars...
The appetizers;
The stuffed mushrooms were well below what we expected, have had much better at half the price...not impressed.  The soft pita chips were very good, the dipping sauce they came with left much to be desired. 
Soups; 
My wife had the Clam Chowder, she said it was excellent
I had the Lobster bisque, very disappointed, the seasoning in the sauce was way off, had Lobster shell in the soup overall not impressed
Dinner;
My wife had the Buttermilk Shrimp, basically wasn't seasoned at all and pretty well over cooked, the fries had so much salt she had to literally wipe the salt off to even be able to eat them.
I had the Fillet, the steak was 'okay' if it had been half the price, asked for Medium, got Medium rare, the seasoning was adequate but not impressive, the Goat cheese mashed potatoes, very very bland, however the spinach, \"horrible, there was so much garlic you couldn't even taste the spinach.
Bottom line, won't catch us eating there again...
Over priced and not that good of food."}
{"text":"This is kinda weird, and I may have been hungover, but the waiter talked too loud!

Other than that, the British Columbia raw oysters, the bacon wrapped shrimp, and plank smoked Atlantic Salmon were awesome.

The steaks are apparently good as noted by people in our group, but if I wanted one of those, I'd go to Morton's up the street."}
{"text":"good food, ok service, a bit pricey for the product."}
{"text":"Shimp Kiss appetizer was ok... It pretty much tasted like bacon and cheese. 

The peanut butter pie dessert was pretty wonderful and then I had the mahi which was delicious."}
{"text":"PRICEY but good. Had the crab cakes with orzo and  and house salad and both were equally delicious. With a glass of wine and tip, I graciously topped $65.49 alone. Id still go back."}
{"text":"Old and frumpy. Mediocre food. We were very disappointed. Good location as it is near the theater."}
{"text":"Went for brunch Sunday. I have been there before for a Fathers Day lunch but that's been a year or so ago. We were a large party of probably 40 and had a private room with two servers assigned to us. The food was fabulous but was served a tad bit slow. Luckily we had drinks and laughs to keep us busy. of you go for brunch and like seafood, try the shrimp and grits. AMAZING!!!  The Bloody Mary's are pretty darn good too. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Happy hour special (3/5/7/9) with truffle fries, burgers, and tacos is fantastic. But, as other reviewers have posted, the service is incredibly...forgetful!

If you come for the happy hour special from 4PM-7PM you will have to force an order in to one of the running waiters as they will ignore you and let you run past the 7PM deadline.

If you can get past the incredibly poor service, the happy hour is worthwhile."}
{"text":"I like the oyster dish, you can order 4 different type of oyster in one plate! I like the crap soup too, very delicious. Groupers are good too, over all it's a good meal."}
{"text":"Best happy hour in town. Fresh seafood and apps all priced to share and order lots of. The staff is attentive and treat you like family after they start to recognize you. Not that I come here often or anything."}
{"text":"Just had our thanks giving feast here at McCormick and Schmick's it was wonderful huge portion priced right and the service by our  waiter Sean was excellent highly recommend for Thanksgiving and again great service by Sean"}
{"text":"If you've ever checked out M & S's Happy Hour online or in person, you know it's pretty awesome...on paper. In practice, at least at the Southside location, it was pretty underwhelming.  My party of two arrived just after 6pm on a Monday to a mostly empty restaurant.  Our friendly server approached within a few minutes, but the time in between drink order...drink...meal...check was lengthy to say the least. Not a huge deal, but what is a huge deal is that the mussels I ordered were awful. At $7 I wouldn't usually complain, but that was exactly $6 too much (I'll give $1 for the half-slice of bread). For those of you that have had gross mussels they're the WORST. I expected more from a seafood restaurant.  Bummer."}
{"text":"We came here with a large group & no reservation- yet they managed to seat us all together, even though they initially told us they would have to split our party up.  This place was hopping & we were hungry- service was very good as was the food."}
{"text":"When you've made mutilple visits to a dining establishment you expect the level of service you receive to be about equal.  

 I have bi-polar dining experiences with McCormick and Schmicks. My first ever time there the waiter was charming, funny and attentive he brought me extra breakdand lemon wedges upon request. The sauce that the garlic mussels in was so good I had to finish all of it, long after the mussels where gone.  After eating the crume brulee I obsessed over it for days.The ambience of the resturant on that date created a romanctice mood.

I have also made several trips in between the first and last time. 

However on my very last  visit I took my younger sibling to a breakfast buffet here.  It was disgusting I was T.O at the garbage they were feeding to these little kids.  The plates were dirty,  and everything had a refrigerated taste even the pasties. My heart breaks that any establishment would serve nasty left overs to children.

Needless to say McCormick and Schmicks at least in SouthSide works is now on my do not dine list."}
{"text":"Came here for Lunch! Absolutely enjoyed everything! Portions were large and tasty and at a great deal for $20.15 for restaurant week!! Totally worth it! Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Very average-seafood was cold and not highest quality-for this price it should be great-and our server was goofy-and chauvanistic"}
{"text":"I've been eating at McCormick & Schmick's restaurants for years in Portland, Manhattan Beach, and San Francisco.  Their fish is always fresh, the seasonings inventive, and the presentation professional.  When we were looking for a house in Las Vegas we stayed at the Residence Inn near this branch.  We must have eaten here four nights per week.  Now that we live a little farther out, we don't get here as often as we should, but we certainly talk about eating here a lot.

This restaurant has a chef with a background in New Orleans dishes.  Not only do you get great fish, but also gumbo, etoufe, and remoulade.  Yesterday my husband and I were in the neighborhood and immediately made a beeline for M&S after dropping off some suitcases that needed repair.  He had the fried oysters and I had the crab cakes.  In most other places, crab cakes are a plebeian choice -- bready, bland, boring.  Here you have sweet shrimp and crabs with just enough breading to hold the cakes together and a toned down remoulade to spice it up.  There was nothing toned down about my pecan crusted catfish with remoulade.  Here the sauce was spicy, the fish crispy, and the green beans heavenly.  But I have to say my husband's scallops over truffled risotto was even better.  I had a hard time not stealing all the risotto off his plate.

Even though we were perfectly content, when the very good waiter brought the dessert tray around, we had to try the vanilla mousse and berries in the almond crisp cup.  It was even better than it looked.  Why can't I get berries like this in the local grocery store?

There is a lot to like at this restaurant, beautiful stained glass (in Vegas and seafood themes), a professional staff, and the best fish in Vegas."}
{"text":"M&S are fail safe. Seafood is fresh, good price point, good service. No surprises good or bad. This one is off the Strip and gives some relief from the typical Vegas tourist traps."}
{"text":"How the mighty have fallen. Last Saturday night I took my elderly mother into the city to see the Cr√®che and we made reservations to then have dinner at this location of McCormick & Schmick's. Between the number of patrons wearing greasy baseball caps as they dined and a manager walking around with his shirttail out, the atmosphere felt more like that of a coffee shop than a quality restaurant. Service was generally polite but uninformed. The clam chowder had a slight wall paper paste quality to it but to be fair they certainly did not scrimp on clams. My crab cake entr√©e was soggy to the point of rendering them completely tasteless. I'm guessing they either had been previously frozen or refrigerated for a lengthy period of time. Regardless, they were a real disappointment and not close to being worth the $34 price tag. Doubtful that we'll ever return but that may be a moot point as it wouldn't surprise me to see this place on corporate's chopping block.  As to the baseball caps, Tony Soprano would not have been pleased. ;-)"}
{"text":"Growing up in Florida I am spoiled with the availability of fresh fish 5 times weekly, now in San Diego it's about the same.  So, I was a little apprehensive about ordering seafood in Vegas,  but when I found out they flew in in twice daily, I was hook line and sinker.  Service was really attentive without being intrusive.  Food was fresh and well executed. But what bowled me over was their steak sauce. Yum,  Just go ahead and drench everything but the sweets in that savory sauce."}
{"text":"I was there for business lunch meeting. My cedar roasted salmon was very good, way better than Triple George at down town, IMO. My coworker had silced beef medallions was pretty good too. I almost steal a slice of beef from his plate. Lol"}
{"text":"March 8, 2014. Found ourselves on the South Side. Reservations a must for this bustling fabulous place. I ate here a number of years ago but don't recall what I ate at the time. 

We arrived early & was happy to find two seats at the bar until they were ready for us. Ordered two prosecco sangria's. Made fresh with a lovely amount of fresh fruit & cucumber. Tasty & delicious. Although be prepared to pay dearly for this drink. Well worth it for me. After such a cold long winter a fresh summer like drink made me happy! 

Calamari was our appetizer of choice. Lightly battered piping hot & served with two sides. Tender & delicious! 

I ordered the Idaho Rainbow Trout, grilled. Hands down my all time favorite fish. I was looking forward to this since I've not had trout in some time. Not disappointed! Two beautifully seasoned grilled filets came out on a bed of mashed potatoes & fresh green beans. I proceeded to make a happy plate! 

My friend ordered the shrimp mac-n-cheese with andouille sausage. This came out creamy cheesy & hot with a perfect mix of gooey yummy cheeses. Andouille sausage has a nice zippy heat to it as well. She made a happy plate too! Much to the amusement & possible shock of our waiter Alex. We assumed most people can't finish it & take most home. 

Speaking of our waiter Alex. He couldn't have been anymore attentive or jovial. Very knowledgable about the menu. Joked & teased us. We never felt neglected or lacking anything. He was fantastic & we left him a nice tip for a job well done! 


We both agreed the price versus quality of food & service was by far worth every penny. We happily paid our bill with no regrets! 

All in all a most pleasant night out! 

There is a large selection of desserts. We ate so hardily  we didn't have room. But they looked very good & I know I'll regret not trying at least one!

Oh! Bonus! There are two parking garages within a walk from this place. No excuse not to try it out!"}
{"text":"This was another visit to this establishment and, as in past visits, was a pleasurable experience. Their service from host/hostess stand to final bill by server was a pleasure. The food selections are almost massive in quantity, the quality of those I have consumed have been well balanced with various spices/sauces. Wines are more than appropriate. Wait service is excellent, courteous, knowledgable of menu and it's items and worth the visit. It is one of the better \"chain\" types."}
{"text":"I grew up with Red Lobster being the epitome of seafood dining.  We won't even get into the Joker's Wild crab leg buffet - my counselor advises against it.

The thing about M&S is that they fly their food in fresh twice a day, and print a new menu twice a day to reflect their freshest selection.  Everything I've ever had has been delicious and I've sampled their bisques (creamy and rich), pasta dishes, filets - just about everything.  The quality is consistent and I've never once been disappointed."}
{"text":"While this certainly isn't my favorite option at this price point downtown, the food and service are always pretty good. I work in the area and come in once in awhile for a business lunch or happy hour, and I've never really had a bad experience. I find that the main dining room food can be pretty pricey, and I think there are probably more innovative/trendy restaurants in the area. This is definitely more conservative, traditional dining and I've never really been wowed by the food. The bar offers a great happy hour, especially for downtown where many places don't have happy hour at all. Overall, I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"Had lunch there and was extraordinarily delighted. The valet knew my name even tho I did not valet park, to the hostess and especially the waitress who was kind, smiling, courteous and just professional! The menu was great with many choices. And the food was fresh and delightful!!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you for supporting Veterans.  My husband and I both Vets enjoyed a wonderful dinner last night. Our waitress was amazing and the food was delicious.  It was our first time visiting your restaurant and we defiantly will be coming back....Thank You!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend mentioned wanting to try McCormick & Shmick's happy hour with me several times over the past year. It's one of the only places he can make it to in time for a happy hour (he works downtown until 5:30 or 6:00 most nights) and he'd heard it was extremely cheap. I'm not a big on chains in a place like Pittsburgh with such great restaurant choices, however this past Friday I obliged him and we went. Coincidentally it was our first happy hour together after almost two years of dating. 

We arrived and were instructed to seat ourselves in the bar area for the happy hour menu. It was around 6:00 on a Friday (the M&S happy hour is until 7:00) and the bar was full but there were about five tables free. It felt bustling but not hectic or overly crowded. I'm sure an hour earlier would have been a different story! Our table was equipped with double sided happy hour menus, so by the time a few minutes had elapsed and we'd been approached by our sever we knew what we wanted. I liked the convenience of that a lot. We both ordered the $5 happy hour burger and fries, with a well manhattan for him and a blue moon for me. 

Our food arrived within ten or fifteen minutes, and I saw that my bun had unfortunately been very generously buttered before being toasted. I had to explain to our server, who kindly fetched me a new, I toasted one. I appreciated how understanding she was about the whole thing. The quality of the food itself wasn't terrible, however I can't see myself paying full price for it. The burger was extremely salty, and the lettuce on it was super cheap. Overall it was what I expected given the reputation of the place and the reviews I read before going. It's not anywhere I'd go for a special dinner, but I can see myself doing another happy hour in the future."}
{"text":"I would be more inclined to rate the joint 3.5 stars, but there is no such thing in Yelp land.  Definitely not worthy of 4 stars, but this Christmas dinner that we had here was taking the place of the Christmas Day Dinner that my recently departed Gram would prepare.  So it had big shoes to fill.  There weren't many restaurants that were open on Christmas Day, and this was the one that seemed to be more middle of the road with a touch of elegance.

For a Pittsburgh joint, the decor and ambiance is pretty spiffy.  We arrived promptly at 3:20 for our 3:30 seating, and we had to wait approximately 30 minutes before we were seated.  A tad annoying when you have a reservation.  Another item that ranks high on the annoying list is that when we were finally seated closer to 4pm, we were ready to order the courses, the server announced that they were out of ham.  That indicates incredibly poor planning on the part of the restaurant?  To run out of ham on Christmas Day at 4pm in Pittsburgh?  The likelihood that they would have Christmas ham on their menu is the only way we were able to convince my Great Aunt to dine there in the first place.  After our orders were placed, the service improved significantly.  The food was decent, but the prime rib was a bit too fatty for my Great Aunt's taste.  I ordered Medium Well, and it wasn't served that way.  I held up a visibly chunk of red meat for the server to view, hoping she would say something, but she didn't notice.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their seafood dishes, but I think it would be a tough sell to have an encore meal there next year on Christmas Day."}
{"text":"The food was mostly very good.  My steak was supposed to be medium well and was closer to a medium but it was flavorful and it was not dry. Glassware had not been polished, water spots on the water glasses. 
Server was very nice, and attentive, bubbly personality and made good suggestions."}
{"text":"I walk in. \"Hi , I have a reservation for two @ 8PM.\" \"Sure, we're just cleaning some tables off.\" Couple behind me steps up and BAM they get seated. Another couple walks in and BAM, they get seated. She walks both to their tables and when she comes back, I make mention of it. Oh I didn't know if you wanted to be seated bc the other person in your party is not here. What?!?! So I'd rather stand by the door then, right?? Or how about you ask, instead of blatantly lying. Not off to a very good start. Still waiting 10 minutes later by the way and another couple got seated.

Anddd update....Mother's Day 2017 was a train wreck. Yes they just started their brunch menu but they we're totally under prepared for this day. My food was cold, grits were hard and the 2nd attempt (the trio) was still cold and tasteless . Doubt I'll be back. One star is bc the mgr came out and wiped all of my items off of the check. Other members of my party ate and I did not, so seems fair enough."}
{"text":"Went here for a colleague's going away party. Ordered the Fish and Chips...figuring that they should do this well. And they mostly did. The fish was good....not the best I've ever had but a solid attempt using Yuengling beer for their batter (not like you could actually TASTE the beer - good Marketing though...). Their Tartar sauce was freshly made and it was very good, so I ordered 2! Dipped my fries in both Heinz Ketchup and this yummy tartar sauce.

But $16 for F&Cs.....Hummmm....Thankfully my boss picked up our Tab. Can't imagine what that final bill was for 12 people as this place is NOT CHEAP at all!

The waitstaff are professional and courteous, and do a pretty good job. 

It's still not my favorite spot but this time it was better than last.....it's just a LOT of money for a lunch."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this location, while in Pittsburgh on business.   I dined here on a Monday night.  The restaurant was kinda empty, with just a few diners.   I was seated immediately.  I order from the fixed menu which includes salad or soup, entree and dessert.   I received fresh bread and butter while I waited for my salad.   I had ordered the house salad which included cranberries, walnuts, bleu cheese and spring greens in balsamic dressing.  Nicely portioned and very good.  For my entree, I ordered the beef medallions and shrimp scampi with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  The medallions and scampi were cooked perfectly.  The potatoes were flavorful and the broccoli was also cooked just right, not at all mushy.    I opted for the creme brulee with raspberries, which was also very good.   The fixed menu was a great deal at $26.   I would definitely return."}
{"text":"My second lunch experience here was enjoyable, my first experience was several years ago. 

Both the appetizer and lunch portions are huge, I took home two thirds of my mac and cheese. The creme brulee dessert was mediocre.

The wait person was exceptionally pleasant and cordial, one of Pittsburgh's best."}
{"text":"Alright, so my friend and I decided to hit up McC & S during Charlotte's Restaurant Week - Queen's Feast.  For those who aren't familiar; during Queen's Feast Week, participating restaurants in Charlotte choose to allow patrons to select a predetermined appetizer, entree, and dessert for $30.  As you may suspect, this is a bigger deal for some restaurants over others.  McCormick & Schmick's is one of those restaurants.

My friend made an 8pm, Friday reservation at the Southpark location. Sometimes I like to remember that I have fun clothes outside of my work attire, so I elected to rock a little-black-dress and heels.  I would say I fit in with the majority of the patrons.  

The man who greeted us at the door in a full suit was very warm and friendly, and immediately showed us to our table.  The table was well-appointed.  As we started to peruse the menu, our server greeted our table with a professional smile.  I ordered a glass of Riesling, my friend stuck with water.  I LOVED that I ordered the larger oz. size of wine, and it arrived in a personal decanter for my pouring entertainment.  Pretty neat.  

Here's where it got a little awkward:  Our server asked if we would like to start with an appetizer -- my friend told her we would be ordering from the Queen's Feast menu.  All the professionalism in the world couldn't have saved our server-girl from her crestfallen face.  Bless her heart.  (People, please.  If you elect to use your Groupon, LivingSocial deal, Queen's Feast hoo-rah, whatever; please remember to TIP your waitstaff according to the original price of your meal.  Waiting tables sucks enough as it is - at these high-end places, it is downright ridiculous.  People are trying to make a living.  Tip accordingly.)

Both of us chose to have the Clam Chowder as our appetizer - it was creamy, flavorful (not too fishy), delicious.  The chowder plus the fresh bread alone could've been my meal.  Entrees - I chose the steak, my friend had the salmon.  I didn't think my steak was too stellar (a little dry), but the potato-cake side item was delicious.  My friend loved her salmon.  

For dessert, the sole option was the Decadent Chocolate Silk Cake, with raspberry drizzle.  It was a slab of pure chocolate, with a bit of raspberry.  I couldn't finish it all.  My friend and I were able to devour about half of our cakes, the end.   It was just too rich, and thick.  Very dense chocolate.  A chocoholic's dream, I'm sure.

As we all know, where tips grow or die is during the \"payment\" portion of your meal.  Our server was very prompt, and we were not rushed in the least to leave our table.  All in all, it was a pretty decent meal.  I'd like to save my pennies for the future and try this place again... order off the \"big kid\" menu :) 

Sidenote - If you have small children, I would NOT bring them unless they are exceptionally well behaved.  I did not note a children's menu."}
{"text":"Happy hour is not just happy but tasty ;).  Wife and I paid a visit to McCormicks after a long time for the HH and yes loved it again.  There is a mandatory beverage purchase required for happy hour though so i had to buy a beer (yes had to!!!) 
I don't know about you but I love happy hours because of those single digit prices you see all over the menu, lol.  
$5 chicken lettuce wrap was tasting great along with that sauce and roasted chicken, there was plenty chicken for 5 bucks.
$7 buffalo shrimp was just as great, spicy and yummy, went well with my beer and the $3 hummus with fried pita, ah man pita just reached another level.  the hummus was super flavorful, spiced just about right with smooth consistency.
The bar area was full so had to sit outside, thankfully it was not chilly as the HH seating is only at the bar or outside."}
{"text":"Went for dinner with some neighbors and fortunately it was Charlotte restaurant week where you could get a fixed price menu for $30.  Considering how outrageous their prices for a la carte dinners, we felt that this was the only way any of us would even think of going here.

Service was great, along with the drinks.  Food was simply OK.  Not fancy, not something that you would oooo and ahhhh about and certainly not if you paid almost $200 for a couple off the regular menu.

Save this place for expense account meals.  You can do far better at other restaurants for far less."}
{"text":"I went here recently for a bachelorette dinner, and the night started on a high note: our party of 13 was seated quickly and we were all pleased to see \"Congratulations Tiffany!\" at the top of all our menus!  Unfortunately, that was about the only thing that was remarkable about this place. We started out with 4 servers - 2 seasoned employees and 2 new employees that they explained were shadowing them.  This created a little bit of confusion when ordering drinks and dinner because we weren't sure who to order from!  Our drinks came quickly: I ordered the Raspberry Mule and was underwhelmed -- too much ice in the glass. I probably only got 5-6 sips out of my drink before it was gone and transformed into a glass of water.

The caravan of servers was back soon after to take our orders.  I debated between a couple of items, but ended up settling on the Seared Ahi Tuna -- seared tuna is one of my favorite dishes and I was looking forward to a nice tuna steak! Unfortunately, what I got was more like the ahi tuna appetizer at Outback.  There were about 10 very thinly sliced pieces of tuna on the plate, with a tiny (and I mean like, maybe 1/4 cup) serving of sticky sushi rice and a tiny serving of seaweed & cucumber salad.  

The cost for this appetizer-worthy dish? $27.99.

I was honestly appalled and disappointed that I paid so much for so little. I could go to Wholey's and get myself a couple of nice tuna steaks for the same price!  I noticed that the other dishes that our table got were a little more fairly-sized for the price, however this was the first time I've been to a restaurant and really felt ripped off.  They'd be better off moving this dish to the appetizer menu and cutting the price in half.  I don't see how they can justify the price for such a small portion.

While a few others in our party ordered dessert, I decided to get a coffee. They brought it out almost immediately, but with no cream.  Remember how I said we had 4 servers earlier?  Well now, suddenly, POOF! There was no one around.  And the restaurant was about 3/4 empty at this point.  I waited probably 8 minutes before finally grabbing a server and asking for cream.  Minor detail, but I would think that a dish of cream would be standard when serving coffee.  

I want to come back to this place for their happy hour, I've heard its AMAZING. But if I ever find myself back here for dinner, I'll be sure to order something a little more meal-worthy. 

My total bill for 1 cocktail, 1 beer, 1 coffee and 1 entree:  $50.06 (before tip)"}
{"text":"My partner's entree was not cooked properly. We requested medium well steak and it came out with a cold center and definitely rare. By the time server bothered to check back she offered to cook the last two remaining bites of the steak. My date just didn't want to be rude and have me eat alone while his food was being refired. Instead of simply owning up to the mistake, the waitress rudely interrupted our dinner conversation by showing us she put in the ticket right, unfortunately this not only interrupts our dining experience, but it doesn't absolutely nothing about the issue. She was just more concerned about being tipped at this point.  When paying for the check, I show the server the Landry's card number and she just walks away with my phone without even saying anything which again was off putting. Despite all this I know folks need a working wage and we left her 20% tip, however I will not be back. There are far too many choices in Charlotte that offer great food and service."}
{"text":"Overpriced, overrated, and tasteless food. We went to the S. Park location on a Sunday evening for my wife's b-day. The restaurant was empty, but no big deal...after all it was a Sunday night. The calamari had no flavor at all and tasted like fried grease balls. My wife had a caesar salad and I think 1 piece of lettuce actually had any dressing on it so they brought out a side of the thick ceasar dressing rather than taking it back and mixing a new one. The swordfish entree was decent but nothing special. My wife ordered the shrimp which was also decent, but our server forgot to bring out our side dish (you order the sides separate from the entrees) so unfortunately that was it for our entree. We decided to try the creme brulee thinking it couldn't be that difficult for them to get this right, but we should have known better. It was similar to the boxed custard that you can make at home and it was also very tasteless. I ordered the Irish coffee to supplement the make at home creme brulee, and it was probably the best item of the entire meal. Basically a mug of straight up Jameson whiskey with a little coffee added to it. Overall, this was a very extremely dissapointing meal and I felt especially bad for my wife as it was for her b-day."}
{"text":"Restaurant has a nice ambiance. Came in a group and was sat right away. Service was \"ok\" but considering the restaurant was slow and not many table were being used service lacked. The waitress tried her best to serve a large group but was unsuccessful at providing a good customer service experience. I WILL NOT come back again, at least not in a big group"}
{"text":"Visited on Thanksgiving and wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be. Sour dough bread not a favorite but we did partake as we waited for our food. Took longer than expected to place our order. Drink order got lost. Turkey was delicious but served as big slabs of turkey and not slices (awkward to deal with, cut and eat like a civilized human being). Got a salad that was ruined by the addition of bleu cheese, green olives and weird bacon bits. My fault on that one as I didn't notice the salad listed several lines above the grilled salad clearly showed these ingredients. NOT good. I picked out the bleu cheese and the olives. Too dark to easily pick out the weird bacon bits. I ate what was left as my mama taught me to always clear my plate but meal was not enjoyable. Tried the Chocolate Mousse Silk Pie and it was unlike any Chocolate Mousse Silk Pie I've ever had. It was so firm and hard to eat I thought it was frozen. Only way to eat it was to break it into chunks. Nothing silky about that. Bunch of rubble on the plate. Not sure why anyone thought it qualified as Chocolate Mousse Silk Pie. Got three raspberries with it and a little line of raspberry sauce on top. What a rip.  After dinner Irish coffee was made with instant coffee. Ugh. Who does that? For the cost of the meal they couldn't make real coffee? All in all not worth the 97$ we paid, including tip."}
{"text":"splurg, its worth it, nice happy hour of young business folk, great for birthdays"}
{"text":"Review for Happy Hour- small bites and drinks only!

Came here for happy hour with friends a few weeks ago. Incredible service. Cheap food. Cheap drinks. Totally worth checking out!

The three of us had hummus and their truffle fries and I had a mojito. Everything was delicious and really reasonable. They even had a burger on their happy hour menu for less than $7! 

Will return again!"}
{"text":"Waiter too so long, I just had one salad...it was the worst Cesar Salad I ever had, no parmesan on the dressing. It tasted more like mayonnaise and salad. We were a party of 8 and the waiter was ipset we asked for separate checks. He said we were supposed to disclaime that at reservation. We cane on a tuesday"}
{"text":"Update:  Once again, my Dad came through town on a holiday (Christmas) and we came here for food.  This time I had the Maryland Style Crab Soup, which was REALLY good, and the swordfish with pancetta, brussels, and potato.  I wasn't impressed with the swordfish; it was dry and lacked any of the usual unique swordfish flavor.  The only flavor to the dish really was the pancetta.  The desserts are still the best thing about this place."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Good happy hour prices but the servers ignore customers like as if they just got out of a bad breakup. Took 10 minutes for us to get a waiter to come to our table & another 20 minutes for her to get us our beers. Have seen multiple people get up & leave, annoyed with being ignored for too long."}
{"text":"After perusing the menus listed on the McCormick & Schmicks website I found they have fantastic happy hour specials. A friend and I stopped in and had the 1/2 lb burger and fries for $2.95!!!! The burger was big, juicey, well cooked, and unbeatably priced. We also had an order of the wings, they were so so. Two beers (one of which was a $7 Sierra Nevada), two burgers and and order of wings set us back $20. I highly recomend stopping in sometime for a quick after work meal."}
{"text":"I like the franchise as a whole great food. This was my first visit to the one at South Park. However my friend and I dined at this location for happy hour  Our waitress was horrible after she took our order the only time she came back to our table was to ask if our check was together or separate. The manager came to check on us and one other waitress ( not ours). However the booth in front of us had her undivided attention. My friend and I enjoyed our  food and it came out quickly. The drinks on the happy hour menu were not so great (watered down )and were not very tasty. I would come here again because the rest of the were on point and the food was good."}
{"text":"Awesome birthday dinner!!

My husband and I took our two boys (5 and 7) to celebrate my birthday!  What a wonderful experience all around!  I will admit that based on the reviews we were tempted to go across the street to Lawrys (knowing it's always amazing)...glad we didn't!

As the hostess seated us, she handed me a  menu with \"Happy Birthday, Tami\" rolled up as a scroll with a gold ribbon.  Nice touch!

The children's menu was disappointing...spaghetti, hot dog, etc.  We wanted our boys to truly experience the restaurant so we ordered a \"grown-up\" entree for them to share.  They put their salmon, mashed potatoes, and broccoli on separate plates with garnish...they thought they were very grown up!  They both ate every bite!

We had clam chowder for appetizers and everyone loved theirs!  I had the ultimate sampler (fabulous!) and my husband had the swordfish (excellent!).  

To end the evening they gave me a molten lava cake with a candle.  The boys ordered one of their own.  Yum!

All in all, couldn't have had a better experience!"}
{"text":"Was told to come here for Happy Hour so I thought why not check it out.. Came in on a Friday evening around 5pm.. Happy Hour runs from 4-7pm. 

Had to sit in the bar for the happy hour which was no big deal.. There were tables open..

Wasn't too keen on the happy hour drink selection.. Really fruity type drinks and no beer.. 

Food was average.. Mostly fried, fatty bar food. I was disappointed. However, the pricing on the food was a great deal, so if you want some cheap appetizers this would be a good place to go. 

Not too sure I'll be back..."}
{"text":"We ate at the restaurant on Sunday as they were hosting a complimentary dinner for veterans.  This is an annual event and they really make veterans feel special.  The last few times we have eaten here, including last years veterans event the food has been mediocre at best.  Last year we spoke with the dining room manager, Melissa.  She listened to our comments and said she was working on improving the food and service.  This year the food was amazing.  It was hot and cooked as described.  We again spoke with Melissa, this time to tell her how much we enjoyed the meal and service.  She was true to her word and has fixed the issues.  If you haven't tried the restaurant for a while, give it another chance.  I know we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This is a chain people -- but they do seafood pretty well.  There is a fresh sheet each day.  We were grateful to hit this place on a Sunday night just before they closed.

The fried oysters are very lightly fried and excellent.  Also head the seared Cajun trout and a Newcastle brown ale.  The prices won't break your bank account and everyone can pretty much find something they would like in a prep method they would approve."}
{"text":"Anticipation is high, expectations are high, prices are high... and I'm just left deflated and disappointed. Overall a lot of seafood choices- the descriptions kept me on the edge of my seat not knowing which dish to try. 

Crab Chowder: this is an ok chowder. I found little clumps of crab meat, but the soup is a little watery for my liking 

Almond crusted rainbow trout: The fish tasted nice- crusted with slivered almonds which gave it good texture. The dish overall however really lacked any kind of seasoning. I sensed a strong buttery taste, but overall bland. Very bland.

Husband ordered the beer battered fish and chips- Hard to mess up right? Wrong! The \"chips\"- skinny french fries were completely soggy. We could not find one crunchy one on the whole plate. The fish batter was also very soggy. Not pleasant to eat. 

Bottom line: price tag is too high for mediocre food. Money better spent elsewhere"}
{"text":"It's hard to even describe what a hot mess this place was. Last night we went on a business dinner there. We had a reservation and were seated right away. There were several parties there including a wedding and a 25th birthday party.  Individually, most of these things aren't a big deal, but collectively, we left saying WTF?!
As we sat down, we heard the bride screaming and crying to the management staff for several minutes. Someone also knocked over a decorative plate that nearly hit us and caused a huge crashing noise. 
Before we even ordered, two different waiters came up to us with meals and appetizers that weren't for us.
We ordered 3 steaks and a fish meal, oysters of each kind on the menu and a bottle of wine. 
After a long period of time (~20 minutes from when we sat down), the wine finally arrived. 
The oysters came to the table with no explanation of which was which, no utensils, no condiments, no lemons. 
Each of us who ordered steaks sent them back. Mine looked like beef jerkey on the outside, and completely still alive on the inside. Plus, it was cold to the touch. The other two were also cold. The fish was in good shape. 
We still heard the bride yelling, saw her go back to their area and then come out crying, her whole wedding party following her shaking their heads in disappointment. 
Our steaks come back, mine was warmer, but absolutely still alive in the middle (I asked for medium-rare so I expected some pink, but I am telling you, it was just rarer than rare). After sending it back once, which is already unlike me, I was perplexed as to what to do next. I could not eat my fairly expensive steak, so I sent it back a second time. At this time I also ordered another glass of wine.
When my steak came back, it was still not what it should have been for a medium rare steak. I took a few bites and decided to be done with it. My glass of wine never came.
When the checks came, the waiter offered me a free desert to make up for my poorly executed steak. We declined just to get out of there faster, and I made sure my never-delivered glass of wine was not on the bill. 
We paid and left more disappointing by that dining experience than I have ever been. 
It seemed like absolutely NO ONE knew what they were doing from the host staff, to the managers, to the wait staff, to the chefs. It was absolute chaos, which our table commented several times during this meal. What a horrible, horrible experience for a place with a fairly hefty price tag. I paid $40 for a steak I could not eat. No manager came by to ask how our meal was, no one offered to make me an entirely new steak, etc. Just incredibly disappointing. You would think a chain like this would have it's shit together, but it did not. Will not return ever, which is not what they should want with people traveling for work on an expense account. Total bummer."}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour (advertised as the best HH in America lol!) last week with some coworkers and throughly enjoyed it. From 3-7 they offer select appetizers ranging from $3-$9. In addition they have $1 shrimp and $1 oysters on Wednesdays. Luckily it was a Wednesday so we ordered a dozen shrimp and two dozen oysters. The shrimp were HUGE!!! And the oysters were really taste and good size. Both were served over a bed of ice so they stayed nice and chill. 

We got some drinks, but even with happy hour, most of the mixed drinks were $7-$9. I was kinda hoping for a $5 martini steal......Regardless the drinks were good and I would definitely return after a hard day of work! :-)"}
{"text":"We are in here town for a week and this place was on the list of the recommended restaurants by our local office.   The atmosphere was great.  We sat outside on the patio and enjoyed the weather.  We each ordered the Ultimate mixed grill. The price was a little high but we liked what we saw on the menu.  The food was great however I thought there was going to be more food so I was slightly disappointed with the portion.  The service was alright.  As our server approached us, she said hello then started to tell her coworker what to do with the table that just left.  So the first impression was obviously not great. Anyway the overall experience was good.  The food came out correctly and in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Downtown Charlotte and loving it! Awesome place to eat. We were craving seafood and steak. 
This place impressed me! We were seated as soon as we walked in, our waiter was great, and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"First off:
*appetizer, entr√©es, & sides were all served cold. 
*manager (Todd) was not friendly or helpful.
*food did not arrive on a timely manner.
*steaks not cooked to preferred temp.

So my family & I come here around the same time of the year for dinner. Previous times we had excellent food & service then but not this time around. We had reservations at 6:30pm but we arrived around 6:15pm. Hostess seemed scatterbrained & it took her a while to seat us. When we were seated, it took another 10 minutes to get our drink order. By the time we ordered our appetizers & entr√®es it was almost 7:00pm. Now our waiter, Carlos, was very friendly & we could see him running around to all of his tables as fast as he could; I noticed this was the case for many of the other waiters. Staffing issues, maybe?

We waited maybe another 30 minutes for our COLD appetizers to arrive but we were so hungry that we did not mind the coldness at this point. We ordered the calamari & bacon wrapped shrimp. The calamari was not worth the price whatsoever. There was mostly breeding crumbs and hardly any actual squid on the plate. 

A long wait later, we finally got our entr√®es, except for my little sister who ordered a burger off the kid's menu. We had a party of 10 so I won't write out each order but for myself, I had the Chef Special: Lobster Thermidor. My plate was cold to the touch & pieces of risotto were not cooked all the way as it was still crunch. My boyfriend & dad had steaks that were really rare when they asked for medium. For how long the food took to arrive I'm surprised they were not even cooked to what they had asked for!

Our food was not hot & more so borderline cold. By the time all of the adults finished the food, that's when my little sister got her burger. Our server had told us the cooks \"forgot\" about her burger. She waited so long that she was not even hungry anymore. 

At this point, we decided to talk to the manager Todd. My uncle pulled him over to our table & let him know the situation but Todd couldn't have seemed to care less. He did not apologize or empathize with us whatsoever. He simply responded with \"Okay. What do you want me to do?\" With his hands on his hips!! Well, an apology goes a long way. We did end up getting a discount on our meal but money was not the issue.  If he tried to empathize even a little bit we might have returned next year but never again! If they hire more staff--especially in the back of house, the food service may be faster & a hell of a lot better!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on an 11:45am reservation.  The food finally arrived at 12:45.  I am quite sure the chicken was microwaved into a piece of leather and the bacon on the sandwich was burnt to the point of being black.  It was the driest plate of food I have ever had served to me.  The lettuce looked like it had been sitting in the sun all day.  Today was my last trip there.  It is consistently slow."}
{"text":"Since moving from Los Angeles to Las Vegas a couple of years ago, my wife and I have discovered that a great steak house is easy to find, but a good fish dinner takes a bit more effort.  Many of the seafood restaurants have an Asian or New Orleans theme, and often specialize in shellfish.  Now I'm not knocking Emeril's New Orleans Fish House by any means, but a place that serves a variety of well-prepared fish, without breaking the bank, is a reason to take note.  If it happens to be a mile off the Strip, on the Paradise Road version of restaurant row, so much the better.  It is nice if you don't have to fight your way through the casino crowds every time you go out to dinner.

I always liked the Los Angeles version of McCormick and Schmick's, but the Las Vegas version is indispensable.  My most recent dinner consisted of a lump crab tower with avocado and mango, lobster bisque, and stuffed halibut.  It might have been a mistake to pick three such rich dishes - I guess I was feeling quite full of myself for having fish rather than meat for dinner, but I left just feeling quite full.  Still, each course was very good.  The service was attentive.  The dining room is very comfortable, with low lighting, and (miracle of miracles around here, unless you're dining at Le Cirque or someplace comparable) no giant screen TV playing \"the game\" was visible from our table.

All in all, I think this is a great choice for a seafood dinner.  Oh, and their steaks are pretty good too."}
{"text":"You'd think that a fish restaurant would know how not to cook fish until it turns to a charred lump of shit, but, hey, what do you expect from a Landry's restaurant? If it was on food alone, I'd give it one star. Total disappointment.

HOWEVER: The host, the manager, and the waitress were all FANTASTIC. Attentive and friendly, they all made sure that my party and I were being treated well. So, if you want good service and overpriced, badly-cooked fish, go here."}
{"text":"This used to be one of favorite restaurants! What happened. No hostess, bartender finally came out after several employees just walked by the hostess stand where there was now a crowd of customers waiting to be seated at 7:45.

Bartender said they were down to 2 wait staff! After sitting for 10 min and no service we and two other tables left 

Where is the management. What happens to this once great service restaurant????"}
{"text":"Come here for Happy Hour! You have to go the website for your location, but this one has it from 5 to 7, I believe. They have appetizers at the from from $1 to $5 and there are some pretty good items. I tried the fish tacos (which were not too good to me - very fishy tasting), the cheeseburger and fries (a big, quality burger seasoned well with fries for $2), the mussels (good), and more that I cannot remember. 

There is a pretty good crowd at the bar. The bartenders are ok. They are so busy that I guess they don't have time to be friendly, but they are nice.

I will be back whenever I'm in town!"}
{"text":"If you come here for nothing else, come for the Happy Hour.  You can get a delicious and humungous cheeseburger and fries at a ridiculous price.  As in, you couldn't even go to McDonald's and get a burger and fries at this size for what they're charging.  Now, of course when you go and add in a drink, that's more, but even those are fairly reasonable selection for Happy Hour prices.  However, do note that the beers are fairly limited for  HH.  Only a couple of domestics and 2 or 3 imports; the rest are full price. 

The space itself is very classy.  Lots of dark stained wood finish and high ceilings.  Service in the bar area was okay.  I don't know that I would seek it out for a sit down lunch or dinner unless it was for a business meeting (which I suspect is the majority of their clientele because they are right in the heart of the business district), but next time someone wants to go for Happy Hour, I'm in."}
{"text":"Ok so this is just pathetic. 2:30 in the afternoon and hardly anyone in the restaurant. Our waitress was terrible. We have been here several times before and today was just awful. The bread was do cold!! We had to wait for ever for our drinks to be refilled. The coconut shrimp well crap I don't know what that was. Aghh frustrating because we love this place. We have received better service and meals when the restaurant had been packed at 7 pm on a Saturday. Hopefully this won't happen again!"}
{"text":"Omg. Food, service and atmosphere was wonderful!! Great recommendations from the staff and worth every penny spent. You must try their shrimp kisses appetizer. *yuuuuuym*
And if you're not too sure what to eat, just ask your waiter or waitress. They are very helpful. Would be happy to visit every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Wasn't that impressed with this place. The atmosphere was lovely, but the food lacked favor. I ordered the blackened chicken, it wasn't seasoned on both sides and tasted like a McDonald's chicken McNugget. The saut√©ed mushroom and spinach had no flavor. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"Some highlights; some unacceptable mistakes.
Stopped here for romantic dinner for 2, ordered drinks, appetizers, entrees, and coffee/desert.

THE GOOD:
The atmosphere was great, our server was prompt, friendly, and detailed. Our cocktails, appetizers, and steaks were great. Our deserts were good.

THE BAD:
The truffle fries and mashed potatoes served with our steaks smelled and tasted strongly of fried fish. They were well cooked, but tasted like the dregs of a fish fry. We barely touched them and the waiter didn't seem to notice.

THE UGLY:
The coffee I got (standard American cup) tasted foul: burned/reheated or old. It wasn't drinkable. I'm not picky about coffee, but something was seriously wrong, so I didn't ask for a different cup because I was sure it was a problem with the preparation. It just didn't seem safe to drink.

THE BOTTOMLINE:
All in all, I wouldn't go back because half of what we were presented wasn't prepared well enough to eat. Morton's would be a better choice."}
{"text":"It feels upscale.  You get the sense that it's \"fine dining\" or, at least, fresh-made food served by people who care.  

Um, no.

My wife and I stopped for lunch at M&S today after business on the South Side.  Relatively empty, even at 12.00n.  

The server was pleasant and attentive enough. I appreciated his solid service.

I ordered a caesar salad and the fish and chips.  My wife ordered a mixed green salad and the trout.  The romaine lettuce is my salad was turning brown at the edges and I found only TWO croutons, neither of which had any garlic flavor (though promised on the menu. Clearly the lettuce was days old.  My wife's salad has several rotten (not just brown but rotten) pieces of greens.  How hard (and expensive) is it to serve FRESH salads?  The fries (chips) on my plate were cold, even though they were UNDER the fish.  I had barely a tablespoon of tartar sauce for the healthy portion of fish that I was served.  The fish was good.  I also received a small (half-cup or so) of cole slaw that was one step from frozen.  Like the salads, obviously days old.  Nothing on my wife's plate, not the trout, the green beans or the pasta, was seasoned at all. Very bland and tasteless.  

VERY disappointing.  And I suspect that the server knew this because when he cleared the entrees he asked \"Can I get you anything else?\" and NOT \"How was lunch?\"  

Not that I'm cheap, but my wife turned back the salad without eating but a bite-full yet the waiter made no effort to take it off the bill.  

VERY disappointing.  $50 for lunch.  Thank God we had a $50 gift card.  I was out only the $10 for the tip."}
{"text":"The service was great.  But the food was mediocre.  The Caesar Salad had no flavor, none of our 3 entrees had any flavor.  We had to ADD salt to the crab legs.  Save your money and avoid disappointment and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but the food and drinks are not worth the cost. I had to send back my Old Fashioned because it was too sweet and the new drink was no better. They actually offered to put more whiskey in the drink to make it better. Who wouldn't want more booze in their drink, but the drink was so bad I just couldn't accept this. I ordered the filet and I couldn't believe how dry it was. I had better steaks for half the price. There are much better choices in the city."}
{"text":"My job often requires me to be at Howard Hughes around lunch time. I usually eat alone and have exactly 45 mins to get in and out. McCormick & Schmick's is an excellent choice for a quick, tasty, white cloth napkin lunch. 
Jill is the bartender during the afternoon hours and she serves up lunch expertly with a side of smile. 
The iced tea here is always fresh, never bitter. They have an array of salads to choose from, from seafood salads to buffalo chicken. The bread is warm sourdough with softened butter. 
My staple lunch is the Oregon dungeness crab and shrimp louis salad. It's served on a bed of iceberg with tomato, cucumber, kalamata olives, egg and thousand island dressing. 
As I write this, it is the end of May and wild Alaskan king salmon is in season. You can order your fish prepared any way you like. Simply grilled works for me, and I asked them to pair it with freshly steamed green beans. The salmon was incredibly fresh, and I'll continue to order it as long as it's in season. 

Just as an aside, one day last week I only had 1/2 hr for lunch. I dropped my car off at the valet, ran in to the bar, told Jill about my time crunch, and I was out of there with time to spare. Just proves that when you're short on time, that's still no excuse for eating fast food."}
{"text":"Holiday lunch with the client. The cup of clam chowder was delicious, but small (such a small amount of yumminess). I enjoyed the palm beach mahi mahi and the lobster mashed potatoes were a great compliment. The highlight of the meal was the chocolate bag--a chocolate shell of a bag filled with white chocolate mousse and berries. Service was good, especially serving a group of 11. Conveniently located next to the businesses on Howard Hughes Parkway, definitely walkable if it is not raining."}
{"text":"McCormick and Schmick is the Southside branch of a chain of seafood and steak houses.  It boasts upscale food and has a popular happy hour.  The food is good but not much better than a Red Lobster and not as nice as Mitchell's as similar venues.  Parking can be difficult in this crowded Southside location.  The happy hour has nice selections at a bargain.  If you get there early enough street parking is possible."}
{"text":"Food was little over priced   steak seemed  a little smaller then 6 Oz  slow getting wine waited 10 minutes while  having dinner.   Bar  needs  help!!!"}
{"text":"Found this place online looking for an upscale seafood restaurant for birthday celebration. I did reservation online via open Table for 6:30 pm the next day and received a confirmation email. The next day at 5pm i get an email saying I was a no show for the reservation. I immediately called restaurant and somehow the system had a 4pm reservation even though my confirmation email showed 6:30pm. This was quickly resolved.  And I reminded them that this was a birthday celebration.

Got there seated and everything gradually went down hill. The restaurant is not kid friendly - just 1-2 items for kids on the menu, no kid size silverware. The service was so slow and it took forever for anything to come out despite the fact that the restaurant was 40-50% capacity. Drinks were not good, food came out cold. Food taste was mediocre. Waiter was not friendly nor apologetic about anything and only showed up every so often to check on the table.

My guest was not wished a happy birthday at anytime during the dinner nor anything else to feel a bit special. And I did tell the waiter it was a birthday celebration when we sat down.

For an upscale restaurant it was a very disappointing experience. I doubt I will be returning to this business."}
{"text":"Small portions for exorbitant prices. Ordered the surf and turf - lobster was a normal tail, as expected, but the steak on the side was completely disappointing. 5 measly pieces of cut up steak that weren't even tender or tasty. No real sides except some fried potato wedges. Completely disappointing for a meal that costed over $30. My partner ordered a shrimp platter that was definitely not worth the price - few pieces of shrimp thrown together on a plate. No thought went into any of the food that we were served. Service was decent, but will not be going back."}
{"text":"If it's an AMAZING happy hour or lunch you're looking for, come here! 

There is a bartender here, I believe by the name of Dorian, that crafts an out-of-this-world mint julep! For those of you that don't know what a mint julep is, you must be from the west. Do yourselves a favor and request one made with Woodford Reserve bourbon. 

I suggest starting out with the fried oysters and pairing this decadent cocktail with the blackened catfish for lunch. Very southern, very delicious, and well worth a trip here. 

Ask for Dorian. I promise he'll make you some spectacular drinks. The service by any of the staff here, however, is amazing!"}
{"text":"The group of us went here for dinner while in Vegas for a trade show we were working last week.    If it was possible to give ZERO stars I would have done it!   To much went wrong with the service to bother breaking down .....my advice DON'T waste your money here when there are so many other options!!   Never again!!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing!! Soon as you order your salad its slapped on the table, before you can eat it your dinner is served.  We had a bottle of wine and before we drank half of it they asked if we want our check.  If I wanted drive thru dining I would have gone to McDonald's"}
{"text":"I would give this place five stars. The professionalism of the staff from when I made my reservations to the end of the meal was first class. It was VERY clean and had an upscale appearance. 

The food was delicious but sort of on the pricey side but that's okay because it was for a special occasion. They brought my wife out desert with a candle for her birthday.  I'll definitely be going back!!"}
{"text":"Meh.  There are so many solid restaurants in downtown Pittsburgh that this would be one of my last choices.  Forced to eat here for a business dinner tonight and of course nothing was outright terrible, but at the same time nothing here is truly good.  Entrees are heavy on mashed potatoes and tasteless green beans, with small cuts of fish.  Unremarkable at best."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for the first time with my family to celebrate my brothers graduation! 

The place itself is beautiful! I love to color scheme of dark mustard greens, browns and tans. The table setting was elegant and I really appreciated the d√©cor! It felt very warm and inviting.
I only had a chance to experience one server but she was awesome! Super nice and upbeat, she even asked if the kitchen could fix my brother a steak even though it wasn't on the lunch menu and bought him a free desert. 

As for the meal I had fish tacos. The tacos came with black beans, I didn't eat them though because they had bacon in them and I don't eat bacon. The tacos were good but I felt it was missing same kind of sauce...maybe an Aioli sauce. And maybe something spicy in there too. BUT I really loved the fresh bites of corn you got and the slight sweetness of the apple in the slaw. 

Overall I give this place four stars just because the food didn't wow me but I definitely would love to return and try something else on the menu to see if there is something I like better. I would recommend this place! Would be a nice date for two! Might have to bring my boyfriend here so we can get oyster wasted."}
{"text":"I see a lot of mixed reviews about this place, but my overall experience was great! So far, this is one of the few Happy Hour venues I have been to that has booth seats, which is definitely a plus for me.

I hit up the Happy Hour menu with a couple of my friends and we had a solid meal. My personal favorite were the mussels, I just can't believe how good they were despite the cheap price. Their calamari is good but the portion is a bit small, one order will not suffice. I wasn't really impressed with their sliders, I think Twin Creeks' are superior. Still, every dish was well-rounded and good.

The service was prompt and quick, I never had to wait for a refill. The happy hour section is spacious with two TVs.

I will probably come here again just for the mussels. They are tasty and for the price, it's a steal!"}
{"text":"I am writing this review on behalf of my family because we had a terrible experience for thanksgiving. While the food was great the service, the logistics of our seating and table was despicable even with our early planning and reservation. My grandmother and grandfather live in Pittsburg and were looking for a good location to accommodate 30+ family members for thanksgiving dinner. We have enjoyed dinners at McCormick & Schmick's before and it seemed like a perfect choice with their thanksgiving dinner option. 

My grandparents went to get lunch and discuss reservations options for a group of our size months before thanksgiving (in September). Upon making the reservation they were guaranteed three large tables next to each other. We were cautioned to have our group arrive on time, so we could all be seated, but besides that they guaranteed they could accommodate us and make our holiday wonderful.

As planned our large group arrived early or on time. Upon arrival we were told to gather at the bar as they readied our table. After 30 minutes (after our set reservation time passed) of waiting at the bar our group was over pouring onto tables around us, but we were finally seated. We were sat at two tables near each other and one table separated. It was as though they had not planned for our reservation or arrival at all. The table in between ours was an 80th birthday party. The group was clearly not in a rush, and I have no idea why the hostess anticipated they would be leaving quickly or on time for us. Since I have been a hostess at a large chain restaurant I know the intricacies involved with these reservations. Large parties especially special events should always be blocked for longer time and not dependent upon each other leaving. 

When we addressed the manager with out unhappiness in our reservation she was flippant and annoyed. She simply said, well I am sorry the other party is still not done eating. This should never have been a problem in the first place. Thanksgiving is a very important night for restaurants and we were appalled that extra time and thought was not given to the seating arrangement. The manager and hostess not only made us wait a ridiculous amount of time for our reservation but sat our party separately. 

The meal was good as expected, but the reservation, wait and attitude of the manager on duty put a bad taste in our mouths for the rest of the night. We will not be eating there again and I caution any other large group or special occasion to think twice before making a reservation.

A side note- I am mentioning last because I do not think this is necessary but should be noted- the manager did nothing to compensate us for the aggregation that we were caused financially or in specials or sides. Our family would still have been separated on thanksgiving, but we would at least have felt the manager cared about our situation. I would like to say I was shocked there was no remedy but after our experience with the staff I am not."}
{"text":"Service was polite and fairly speedy.

We each had a cup of clam chowder to start, which was tasty if unspectacular.

For our entree we both had the buttermilk fried shrimp. The shrimp and cocktail sauce were tasty but could have been seasoned better, and we didn't get many fries with it. Overall for the price we paid it was disappointing.

Overall despite fairly decent tasting food, for the amount we had and the price we paid it was expensive and we wouldn't eat there again."}
{"text":"Everyone working there seemed like they were pissed off, Food was just ok not worth the price. I won't be going back"}
{"text":"Not good. My wife and I both ordered fish, both dishes were over-done but my son's steak was a perfect medium rare (odd for a fish restaurant!). We were served by some dopey kid who shouldn'd have been serving anything pricier than big macs. We ordered a bottle of wine and he brought the wine glasses to us but didn't bring our wine until we were nearly finished. First and last time i come here. The manager was very nice and did come by and try to fix things but all-in-all, it was not worth the $150 bill"}
{"text":"This is not on my consistent radar but I've never been disappointed when I come. My food has been good and I enjoy the laidback atmosphere."}
{"text":"Drove 19 hours from Texas to go to a Steelers game. Wanted to go to a nice place for Christmas Eve close to the hotel. Unfortunately I chose this place!
Waiter was TERRIBLE!!!  Rushed us, almost took our horrible appetizer before we were finished!  Then it took him 10 minutes to come check on us and get our second drink order.  Then another 10 minutes for us to get those drinks!!!  My overpriced steak and bland cheddar fries got cold waiting for a very small glass of wine!!  Which was $12!!!!!!!!!
The Lobster bites were awful!  $20 for a few chunks of deep fried lobster chunks. Fish and chips rival Long John Silver. The ribeye was small and dry. Just a very very disappointing experience. Probably the worst of my lif hence me writing this review. Don't go!"}
{"text":"I Had the trout and it was tasty. The kids menu is great, plenty to choose from. Good service, good wine list. Has valet!"}
{"text":"We had a pretty good experience tonight, a Saturday prime time dinner one day before Christmas Eve. The place was nearly empty, not what you would expect. Our server was very new, not familiar with upscale dining, but very nice and sincerely committed to our service. The food, a wedge salad, fried shrimp, and shrimp scampi was all very good. The wine list is a somewhat shrunken version of the list from a year ago, but adequate nonetheless. The dining room has been redone and is pretty attractive now. Overall the experience was much better than the last few times and we will likely return."}
{"text":"We had dinner last night with another couple at McCormick and Schmick downtown. At 7:30 on Saturday evening, peak time, the restaurant was not full. That's a bad sign. We chose the downtown location because we had a couple of poor service experiences at the south side location. Our experience last night was satisfactory overall. The seafood menu is limited but adequate. Three of us had the fried shrimp and the other a shrimp trilogy, indicating that the fish offerings were unexciting, to say the least. The cocktail and wine choices were decent, with wine prices comparable to other upscale restaurants. Service was a little slow considering the partly empty room. Since they eliminated valet parking it was a little uncomfortable walking several blocks from the garage on a cold, windy night. When McCormick and Schmick opened in Pittsburgh it was one of our favorites, but the thrill is definitely gone. The upscale feel has diminished, the menu has shrunk, service has slipped, and the dining room is a little worn. It's still okay, but not what it used to be. It won't continue as is for much longer. Will it be a makeover or surrender?"}
{"text":"5Stars!

They have wonderful steaks and seafood.  I have never, not once, had a negative or unsatisfactory experience here.  The absolute only negative I could even think of is their hours - stay open longer!  The other location stays open later.  But I understand how Uptown, they may want to close a bit earlier than other places.  The valet guys are very friendly and at this point, they know me by name.  Very good place.  Professionals."}
{"text":"Another awesome dinner here.  The Blackened Chicken Fettuccini is simply the best ever. 

The ambience is very nice for slow relaxing meal with Lisa.

The staff was excellent as always and very accommodating to Lisa's special food requests and made great suggestions and modifications.

Would highly recommend, ask for Michael!"}
{"text":"McCormick & Schmick occupies that rare strata when a restaurant feels pretty expensive but in reality it isn't.  I think that's why I hardly go here.  It's not that the food isn't fabulous, because it is, but rather I think its expensive. Well no longer!  McCormick's is now solidly entrenched in \"the rotation\"

I love that this location is off the strip because it makes getting there so much easier.  Once there, we were immediately seated and the even though the dining room decor is slightly campy, I love the nautical clubby feel.  Reviewing the menu, I noticed you could order prawns individually, which is fantastic because I love them but my date did not, so i was able to custom my order for exactly the number I wanted.  Did I mention they were only $2 bucks a piece to boot?  So far so good!  They came out and were good size, not jumbo, but fresh and tasty.  

Next I had the challenge of navigating the menu.  Its stocked with all kinds of sea food and meat goodies.  But this is is a seafood restaurant, so I had to go that route.  I was immediately attracted to the seared Bluefin Tuna served on a bed of steamed spinach.  My date went the other route and ordered a nice 8 oz sirloin with mashed potatoes.  The dishes came out exactly as described.  My Bluefin was immaculate and rich in flavor.  The sear was perfectly executed and the fish retained all its flavor.  The spinach also was fantastic and completed my fish wonderfully.  The steak across the table from me was also perfectly cooked.  We ordered a side of Asparagus as well to supplement the meal  and it was cooked al dente with just a drizzle of Hollandaise sauce...mmmm!

Now sitting at a size 34 trouser even though just an hour before I entered the restaurant a 32, I opted for desert. I was attracted to this Walnut brittle that had inside a passion fruit creme with various berries on top.  I didnt think I could eat but 2 or 3 bites, but I wanted to taste it.  It was so good, we ended up eating the whole thing.  I can honestly say that was one of the best deserts I've had in a restaurant that doesn't employ a separate pastry chef.  Definitely save room for this bad boy!

Beyond all this food, I had two beers and the date had a coffee and a glass of wine.  Total bill was just over $100.  I couldn't believe it.
I always knew they had the kick-ass happy hour but now I know their prices are solid the whole night.  Great place for a quiet seafood dinner off the strip or at any of their locations across the country.

Note that the valet parking here is free...just a tip at your discretion."}
{"text":"One word to describe my experience tonight at dinner?  Blah.  Nothing was special about anything I ate there.  I did the restaurant week menu which, for me, included a Caesar salad, stuffed mahi mahi and creme brulee.  

The salad was dry and could use more dressing.  Wasn't the worst I've had but really nothing special.  Now the mahi mahi was what I really looked forward to.  Big disappointment.  There was barely any flavor to this dish.  While it was rich (stuffing had creamy consistency), I really thought about adding salt.  Yes, salt, to a seafood dish.  

To end the experience, I ordered the Creme Brulee.  Didn't think I could go wrong.  It literally tasted like a snack pack pudding.  It must have been pulled from a fridge and sent to the table.  There was no crunchy, caramelized sugar top.  Honestly, it was pudding with 2 blueberries and 1 raspberry thrown on top.  

Service was also disappointing.  We went on a Sunday evening and there were maybe 4 other tables taken in the whole place.  After we finished our dessert we waited and waited for our server.  I actually had to get up and ask another waiter to get her.  

Not sure why people love this place.  I wasn't feeling it!"}
{"text":"We went here for our 35th anniversary. I told them in advance. They had \"Happy Anniversary \"printed on the menu. At least five of the staff told us happy anniversary. They were so kind. Everything we got to eat was amazing!  We got spicy bacon wrapped shrimp kisses appetizer. Awesome!  My husband got seafood trio. He loved it. He is not a foodie, so for him to rave about it was unusual. I got salmon with beets special. I wanted to lick the plate. Had creme br√ªl√©e for dessert. It was so-so. Overall, the place was excellent with fantastic service. We will go back!"}
{"text":"First time at a McCormick and Schmick. I had the Hawaiian mahi-mahi. It was good but not great and very disappointing that the portion was extremely small. The dish was good enough that I would go back but the portion was so poor that I definitely will avoid going back. It was bad enough the server should have warned me only 2 small pieces about and inch by half inch."}
{"text":"Celebrating my  grandson's graduation from UNLV, the family went to McCormick and Schmick for dinner, as was his choice.
The waiter, Michael,  suggested the shrimp kisses ( cheese stuffed bacon wrapped shrimp) as an appetizer and I can tell you this is probably the best shrimp appetizer I have ever had. We all could have made a meal out of it. If you've never had them I strongly suggest you try them.

All of our dinners were superb as were our salads. My daughter ordered the iceberg wedge with blue cheese and bacon. She said it was crisp and fresh with excellent bleu cheese dressing. She was right.

My grandsons Ponchatrain  Grouper was very good although a little too heavy.. My other grandson's fillet mignon was tender, 
 juicy and perfectly done. He loved it.
I ordered lobster and steak medallions  and the dinner couldn't have been more perfect;  steak was very tender with great flavor and the lobster tail was ample.  
My daughter's stuffed salmon was out of this world.  When I return I'm going to be sure and order that one. 

We ordered bananas Foster for dessert and the entire table was able to eat just one  dessert. The portion is huge so be sure to share it.  Delicious rum sauce. 

We've been here before and the service was good but last  night's service with Michael was excellent. Ask for him if you can.
All in all a great evening."}
{"text":"I went there for my birthday dinner and it was one of the best meals I've ever had. They always add a nice touch and put \"happy birthday ____\" on the top of the menu which is fun and they give you one rolled up with a ribbon to take home. 

I had the cedar planked Scottish wild isles salmon and it was literally the best salmon I'd ever had in my life. I love salmon and I make it and order it a lot. It was like butter. It had a maple whiskey glaze which gave it the perfect amount of sweetness, and it had a perfect char on the outside edges from the sugar. It was just so frickin good. So so so good. Compliments to the chef. 

We got the buttermilk fried oysters and shrimp kisses for appetizer and they were both ridiculously good. 

The lobster mashed potatoes have chunks of lobster meat in them and lobster bisque poured over the top. Holy hell. So good.  

I was pretty immersed in my own food so I barely came up for air and have no idea what everybody else thought of their food  My sister got the scallops with the crab potato hash and I did try that and it was amazing. 

Everything was so decadent and rich and amazing and definitely an indulgent food type of meal but SOOO worth it. 

They gave me a molten cake on the house for my birthday which is obviously amazing cuz how can you go wrong with that, and then we also got the upside down apple pie with walnuts and cinnamon ice cream, the chocolate bag and the chocolate silk pie which were soooo sooo good. Everything was so rich and delicious but not so overly sweet that it was distracting (which is an issue with a lot of desserts in my opinion). The mousse inside the chocolate bag was actually very light and refreshing almost. 

So basically....eat here, it's amazing. Such good food. I'm still thinking about that salmon haha"}
{"text":"Came here cuz we had a gift card. Only two tables in restaurant on a Saturday night at 9 pm in Vegas ? Worried that was a bad sign but we were pleasantly surprised. Sean our server took great care of us. Brought our cocktails fast and split our ahi plate without even asking!"}
{"text":"This place was way overpriced for the food you got.  Also,  they need to learn how to cook shrimp.  I got the McCormick Seafood Trio and both shrimp items were WAY over cooked.  For $31 I got 6 shrimp and a small salmon filet (maybe 4 oz) which was also overcooked, just not as bad as the shrimp.  The shrimp at this place were definitely not Bubba approved.  My wife got the New York strip and for $39 she got a 13 ounce strip (which tasted decent) and 3 asparagus spears.  All of this was paired with slow service. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"M&S never fails to disappoint. Over-priced average food. Last 3 experiences in M&S locations in Pit, Philly and NY have all been below par. Thought this time might be better. I was wrong. Don't waste your money. Go to a cafeteria. Bland food, average service."}
{"text":"I love this place - the food is good, the service attentive and pleasant, and when I'm in a hurry, their Happy Hour burger & fries plus $4 beers is hard to beat."}
{"text":"This is my first time at this restaurant, service was very good , the waitress was very nice and everyone in my part loved the food it was delicious and good portions and the price was good for the quality. I'll return next time I'm in Charlotte. Btw love this city"}
{"text":"Thank you Shawn and staff for helping in celebrating Jason's birthday! Anastasia provided excellent service and the food was delicious as always! Again, thank you! You remain one of my favorite places to dine!"}
{"text":"We came for the happy hour and ended up eating dinner. I had the pound of Alaskan King Crab legs with a side of potatoes, which didn't disappoint. The bartender suggested the sangria and it was equally as good as the good. The service was fine for it being happy hour, overall I'd recommend it just make a reservation it gets pretty packed."}
{"text":"Went here for my sisters birthday and it was amazing. The waitress Natasha made our first time very memorable. She knew the menu like a book and her recommendations for drinks and food were ideal. The food was amazing I had the bouillabaisse and my sister had the seafood trio. I really enjoyed my time there and having a knowledgeable waitress like Natasha help us feel even more comfortable They even customized the menu and my sister got a birthday dessert. We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"* Update - Aug 6th.
The dinner was excellent. The server was not. It gave me a shiver as our server sat down my wine glass and began to pour the wine directly into the bottom of the glass. Obviously they do not teach their servers how to pour wine. It was a horrible flat tasting glass of wine , that I was unable to drink. Our server served us the wrong dinners as well as not know which of us ordered the correct appetizer. He was present but, I wouldn't have sent him out on his own until he was followed by a senior server for a very long time."}
{"text":"I have the honor and privilege to submit this review on McCormick and Schmick when they are doing what they truly say they will do,¬† that of honoring all the veterans and giving back to the community.¬† For the second time in as many years I've had the privilege of having dinner at McCormick and Schmick in their celebration of veterans contributions to the United States.¬† Their menu for this occasion is not start it has six to eight different entrees.

Today I had parmesan crusted chicken,¬† and some heavenly mashed potatoes, which was extraordinarily pleasing to my palate. Dee,¬† my waitress was extraordinary and overly¬† accommodating.¬† To have a restaurant chain honor Veterans in this manner is extraordinary and I applaud them,¬†¬† having witnessed the great change public acknowledgment of veterans sacrifices for the Nation."}
{"text":"I ordered the buttermilk fried shrimp with Chesapeake fries. Absolutely amazing food. We also ordered fried calamari as a table and it chewy and crispy. The ambiance is fancy so a lot of tourists and business people were there having lunch. The service was also speedy."}
{"text":"Happy hour is the best here! Nicole is the best bartender! very attentive, speedy, and nice! Executive chef John was  kind enough to bring out our mussels, and when 2 of them weren't open all the way, he brought us some more! Dark, chill, relaxing vibe in the bar area. Perfect for just getting off of work! The coconut shrimp is BOMB and the tuna is very good as well!"}
{"text":"This chain really varies from location to location. The Las Vegas restaurant leaves a lot to be desired. It was empty last night at 8 PM, and the hostess REALLY pissed me off, when she asked us if wr'd like to sit at the bar. I hate it when two men who enter a restaurant are ushered to the bar to eat uncomfortably. I told her we wanted to sit in the main dining room. 

We ordered the price fixed menu. The clam chowder arrived and was too thick with flour. We waited an extremely long time for our salmon entrees, which we ordered \" cooked through\". The salmon arrived extremely rare. The waiter couldn't be found to send the entres back, so I had to walk to the door and ask the hostess to find him. When we finally got our salmon it was dry and the zucchini pasta had no taste. My desert, the molten lava  cake was dry but tasty. I've had better meals at other locations and wouldn't return here."}
{"text":"The Rockefeller oysters are to die for!!! 
We came in for late lunch on a weekday, so it was empty. The bartender was really attentive as well.
When we come back to Pittsburg, we'll defenately coming back for those oysters!!"}
{"text":"Walking into McCormick & Schmick's was interesting. It reminded of any other semi high class diner. But it seems like they were a little disorganized as we had a reservation for 5 and we were led to a table that was still being set up. The only thing was that they were setting up for 6. We told them that we only had 5, and that there was an extra seat. We had to repeat this maybe 3 or 4 times until they got it and understood and took the extra seat and set of silverware off the table. You would think to get the table ready before seating down the customers right? Especially if you're charging $20+ for entr√©es. Anyways, after being seated, we received customized menus which was an interesting touch. We were celebrating 3 birthdays as our schedules have not lined up until now. \"Yeah, that's nice Bruce, get on with the food.\" I know. So this is what we had:

For our appetizer we started off with stuffed mushrooms which were flavorful. The mushrooms were stuffed with crab with a chowder type sauce. I liked the touch of green onions as it gave it a kick at the very end and it rolled off my tongue. The bowl of clam chowder was tasty as well, the flavor was full as in thick, but it wasn't extremely like sloppy like so not overbearing. There were a good amount of clams in the soup. The only thing I regretted was that I wished I didn't put a whole packet of oyster crackers in. I think it would've been better with maybe half the packet or even a third of it.

For the main course, I ordered the McCormick's Seafood Trio. The dish wasn't too bad. I ordered it because well, if a dish was named after the restaurant better believe that it better be good and represents the restaurant. The dishes came with 2 stuffed shrimps with crab, 3 big pieces of broccoli, 4 pieces of shrimp, a healthy slab of mashed potatoes, and a small piece of salmon that was salted with salt and pepper. It was filling, and offered a good representation of several of the other dishes that were offered on the menu. There was one caveat in our meal that gave me a sour taste in my mouth.

Our experience with the Cedar Sockeye Salmon lacked severely. One of my fellow dinner mates ordered this on the waiter's request, and it failed horribly. The salmon literally had no taste and the salmon was room temperature and not hot. When I tasted it, it tasted like the chef or someone forgot to glaze it or even marinate because it was just a slab of salmon, no taste. However on the upside, when told about the lacking dish, the restaurant took it back and gave my dinner mate another dish immediately. I sort of wanted to see what the chef said if he ate it and see what it tasted like. For that, this restaurant gets some points... 

...What this restaurant doesn't get is what we saw on the receipt... And that was that we returned the dish and the reason was because we didn't like it, not because the fish had no flavor. So you're saying the lack of flavor in the food is our fault, not the chef's/restaurant's. Right. I mean why is that even on the receipt?

My overall personal experience of this restaurant was just alright. It wasn't the best thing I've ever had, nor was it the worst. It was mediocre at best. The food was alright, the service was not too bad and what saved them from 2 stars. There were highs and lows when I went here so that's why I have to settle for 3 stars."}
{"text":"good quality food. perhaps the saying \"you get what you pay for\" is appropriate? it's a $$$ cost, so i expect that amount of quality/service. i had an aged prime ribeye steak and it was yummy.

the place wasn't busy the day i went but by chance we were sat at a table where the pepper grinder was overhead one of the seats. from time to time a wait staff person would go to reach for it. it's a bit awkward hearing movement there as you're eating. oh well, not a big deal."}
{"text":"Delicious meal started with seared ahi tuna appetitezer, sour dough bread & butter, grilled asparagus,  cedar roasted salmon with grilled vegetables. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Really not the best experience.

The waiter was pushy, and kept trying to get us to order an appetizer after we had clearly told him three times we only wanted to order main dishes.

I asked if bread would be served, as there were two bread plates on the table, and the waiter again asked us if we would be ordering an appetizer before answering, \"Yes.\"  Why are bread plates on the table if bread is not going to be served before the meal?  For show?

The bread came out cold and uncut, so my friend and I had to use our knives to cut it in half in order to share it.  The butter was whipped, and tasted a bit oily.

The food (salmon and mashed potatoes for me/salmon and veggies for my friend) came out lukewarm and turned cold as we ate it.  

I really expected to like this restaurant, based on friends' recommendations, but left with a less than stellar impression."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner with my brother and father even though the place was nearly empty at 8pm on a Saturday night - probably because a fight was in town. As far as chains go, this was is consistent with every other M&S you'd visit. As always, great service."}
{"text":"Well the calamari was good. The addition of jalape√±os and artichokes is a tasty treat!  I had snapper.  Nicely seasoned. Decent risotto-nothing too exciting. Hubby had the swordfish. He liked it,,, I didn't. Both of these items were the chef special.  What ruined dinner was THE LOUD MUSIC. MY GOODNESS WE COULD NOT TALK WITH OUT SHOUTING. WILL NOT GO BACK HERE EVER.   Oh, and now that I'm home, I just realized I did not get my left over risotto I asked to be boxed. .  $33 for fish and risotto,,, and 3/4 of it did not come home.  Guess they want that LOUD music to distract you."}
{"text":"Definitely not what I've experienced at other mccormick and schmicks or m&s grille. Nothing justified the price; not service, not surroundings, and definitely not the food. The menu was very limited, the preparation was off, and the service was lacksidaisical."}
{"text":"Disappointing meal, but an OK dining experience.  My wife and I were going out for a date night in Uptown, with dinner and a play.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was great.  Our waitress was very kind and attentive -when he was at our table- more on that in a moment.  It was St. Patrick's Day, which we did not take into account when we booked it, but we had an early reservation and the restaurant was nowhere near full.

Our meal started with drinks, a cab for the wife, and a \"craft\" beer for me.  Their \"craft\" selections were not actually craft, but they had 2 lesser \"big beer\" brands, Lagunitas and Ballast Point. I ordered the Lag, but they were out, so I got the BP instead.  The sourdough bread to start the meal was fantastic.  But at this point, we had already been there 30 minutes getting drinks and bread.  Then the waiter came to take it apps order.  I asked about the Oysters Rockefeller; the waiter thought they were on special tonight, but had to go check with the kitchen.  When he came back, he confirmed, and he went to place the app order.

When he came back, we then ordered entrees.  The wife ordered the double lobster tails; I inquired about either the fish & chips or the fried shrimp.  The waiter suggested doing both, adding shrimp to the fish platter, which I took him up on.  Then we waited a while longer for our Oysters.

When the Oysters Rock came out, they looked great and tasted very good.  Great presentation, and it looked like a dollop of hollandaise on top of each oyster, but it tasted more like cheese whiz.  Still, the oysters tasted great. But at this point, we had been there almost an hour.  There were just very slow gaps in service, but the waiter was very polite each time he visited us.

Finally, our food arrived.  This was the most disappointing part of the experience.  The twin lobster tails.... Were each 4oz tails.  Very small broiled tails.  Tasty, but just not much.  They were served with mashed potatoes and a lobster bisque as a gravy.  Potatoes were just OK, and her tails weren't much.  She expected more for $35.  We considered asking out waiter to add a third trail to make the $45 lobster plate, but we didn't think we'd have time before the show.

For my meal, the 5 shrimp were very tasty, but slightly on the rubbery side.  Good flavor, but it seemed they were a bit overcooked.  The fries were OK but not crispy.  The travesty was the cod planks.  Good flavor, but the texture was way off.....the batter was spongy and soft instead of crispy and crunchy.  It was like - it had been sitting under a heat lamp for much of the 20-minute gap between our apps and our entrees.  And to be clear - there were still a lot of empty tables around the restaurant at this point; they were not 'slammed.'

At this point, we had 15 minutes before showtime, so we cashed out and walked over to the Blumenthal.  We were glad for a dinner date in a nice spot, but we won't be back because the food wasn't as nice as the restaurant."}
{"text":"Fantastic service......lobster mac n cheese was to die for!! Oysters were delightful and so fresh!"}
{"text":"**BAR AREA ONLY**

This is my first time dining here and we were greeted right away and we decided to sit at the bar. 

The ambiance and interior of this place makes me feel like I'm dining in a nice steak & seafood resteraunt back in the days with all the dark oaky  wood decor for the walls and tables and booths.

Our bartender was very spiffy and well groomed looking with a tie & vest as uniform which really added on to my thought of \"back in the day feel.\" Makes you wanna dress up way more than you would normally. Steven let us know about some specials & he also let us know that they were doing a half priced bottles of wine which was AWSOME! 

We started off with a bottle of TELEPHONE CLARK PN 12' which was amazingly good & also an awsome lookin bottle with wax poured over.

Then our bartender offered us some BREAD & BUTTER which was still steaming when he brought it out . *AMAZING* with the whipped butter & I like to add balsamic vinegar 

GARLIC FRIES - served with a citrus garlic aioli of some sort and then we took it to the next level and ordered a cup of CLAM CHOWDER & poured it on top of the garlic fries which made an easy poutine for us to munch on.

MARGARITA FLATBREAD - simple & tasty cheese - tomato -basil

LOBSTER MASHED POTATO - yummy chunks of lobster & lobster bisque smothered on top

STEAK & LOBSTER - one of the biggest disappointment which brought this review down to a 3 star  having the place be known for their steak and seafood... we had ordered med-rare tenderloin but it literally came out med-well  to well done... the bigger disappointment is the fact that the medallion pieces were cut so there really should have been no EXCUSE as to why the steak would be overcooked in any way... given the fact that if it wasn't sliced then you can't really see the temp of the inside of the steak... but please... tenderloin is literally ONLY tender if med-rare or medium at most. The steak tasted like it was sitting in the window and drying out to be jerky. On the other half! The LOBSTER tail was perfect! Juicy & not overcooked.

Will definately be back because of our bartender & the lobster maybe if we get a more expensive cut of meat it won't be overcooked."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service is always a plus when you are on vacation. I frequent the Southern California locations so I knew what to expect. Food was prepared just how I asked and the waitress and bartender made sure my visit was enjoyable. The strong drinks always help. I will come by every time I am in town."}
{"text":"One thing I have been telling people, ever since my brother and Mom treated me for my birthday, this place is quality!
I cannot say that was at all the experience I had for St. Paddy's Day 2017 and will not make this recommendation again, for now.
I would think that such an establishment, with pretty great ratings¬† on sites such as Tripadvisor and Zagat, would consider serving quality food, whether in the bar area or main restaurant, no matter time of day or occassion. Considering this was also advertised as an all day event.
My mother and I got there around 730 for specials they were offering, in the bar area. 2nd year we decided to celebrate here. The short of the long is that, we were sat at a dirty table and of all the items ordered, none were hot, I would say barely warm.¬† The best part of our meals, sadly, were the celebratory Guiness beers we each had.¬† 
I really want to give this place another chance, even though I find it hard to believe this was just an unfortunate accident of some sort. They were even taking down some decorations around 830pm, which took away a small part of the fun of having a holiday celebration.¬† It doesn't make people feel welcome when you are taking things away and serving food as if we had just made a last minute order before closing time. I'm sure I can even say, we did not get what we paid for."}
{"text":"We had dinner on Mother's Day.  We were disappointed our food took a while to come, but it was a special day so we dealt with it. After waiting we did expect our food to be hot not warm.  I sent back the mashed potatoes.  The shrimp stuffed with lobster was good but also warm.  I just ate it.  What happened to the white table cloths which always set this restaurant apart.  Service was fair.  This once elegant restaurant has become rather ordinary.  I long for the days when they cleaned the crumbs off your table.  My family and I enjoy sprucing up for dinner, but when you see people in jeans and baseball caps it makes me understand why some restaurants don't put in the extra effort that at one time set them apart."}
{"text":"Had a 6:30pm reservation, weren't seated until close to 7pm. Did not receive our food until 9:00!!! We had to cancel our plans we had for after dinner. And the food came out lukewarm as if it had been sitting in the kitchen for 20 minutes. Also the portions were very small for the price. We asked for the manager and he acted like he didn't know what to do! We rarely complain but this time was necessary. He offered to take our food back and \"warm it up\" but at this point we were starving and wanted out of there. He finally took 2 of 6 entrees off the bill and gave us free entree coupons (which we won't come back to use.) I've been to the other location (Southside) before - although it was years ago - and was never this disappointed. Avoid this place unless you have hours to spare (God-forbid tickets to a show after) and enjoy mediocre, small portioned, cold food."}
{"text":"Great happy hour spot! They have drink and food specials for happy hour and outdoor seating! I had a Manhattan and a tuna poke bowl which were both included in the happy hour promotion. The tuna poke bowl was the best I've had in the city. It's a small dish so not big enough for a whole dinner but great for snacking on while enjoying happy hour drinks!"}
{"text":"Lovely place to sit at the bar and grab a cocktail or special app or two....

:)"}
{"text":"Usually get food to go but also enjoy the happy hour. Love the chopped salad (but if you don't like bacon or blue cheese or olives, you won't - I don't think it is a \"traditional\" version), clam chowder, parmesan sole (or flounder). For happy hour, the hamburger can hardly be beat but when they have oysters those are delicious (and typically get them along with a lemon drop martini).  Reliably good with great service. I do wish they would bring the Fat Tire beer back but they have other good options too (beer plus hamburger = yum)."}
{"text":"You would think a seafood/steak place would know how to sear a scallop, right?  Especially if you're paying $30.00 for them?  You would be wrong at McCormick and Schmicks's.  We were in a virtually empty restaurant on a Tuesday night, and I was served the most flaccid scallops I had ever seen.  The waiter did not even return to check on us until it was time to bring us our bill.  At that time he noticed that I had not eaten my dinner.  Did I want them to remake them?  No, not by then, because I needed to get home to the babysitter.  Could they comp me a dessert?  No, thank you, I would have preferred a dinner that I could eat. Horrible food AND service.  My husband's entree was edible, but only barely.  Never again."}
{"text":"This is the first time I've ever eaten there that it wasn't Happy Hour (which is great).  It was a very good dining experience.   I had the Surf and Turf which was Tenderloin Medallions and Lobster.  The Berdelaise Sauce that they marinate the tenderloin in was very tasty and it was cooked perfectly.  The lobster was rich and tender.  And they served some roasted fingerling potatoes with it.  I also had a wedge salad, which was good.  And I had a piece of chocolate mousse cake for dessert.  It was a great meal.  The service was very good.  My server was very sweet and attentive.  And the restaurant was very clean and inviting.  I was very impressed and would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised, I've eaten at these in California with mediocre results, drinks, steak and shrimp were spot-on though.  Mojitoes were excellent but if pass on the creme br√ªl√©e, I thought it below average."}
{"text":"This guy that I am dating took me here for New Year's Eve and it was my first time dining here! We made reservations a few days in advance and didn't have any trouble getting a table. 

For starters our waitress Anna, was wonderful! She took great care of us. We ordered a bottle of Don Miguel Gascon Malbec. I have never tried Malbec before and I have to say I am a big fan. It went down smooth. We ordered the oysters rockefeller and crab cake for appetizers. I was pleasantly surprised with how much I liked the oysters. They were cooked with spinach, bacon, pernod, and hollandaise. The crab cake was also very delicious and was filled with plenty of crab. For our meals, I ordered the crab stuff shrimp with green beans and cheddar mashed potatoes and he ordered the ahi tuna with white rice. The shrimp was nice and meaty and the crab stuffing was appropriately portioned. I highly recommend this dish, along with the oysters rockefeller. They also have a rewards program that we were made aware of! It's $25 and each time you dine with them or any of their other restaurants (the list is a mile long) you earn points. Our next visit we get a free appetizer! This is definitely a great special occasion restaurant."}
{"text":"The food was... ok, but the service... The restaurant was pretty empty so they certainly weren't overworked: aside from minor gripes and the inexplicable slowness, we didn't get the complimentary bread; we didn't get spoons for our soup; we didn't get spoons for our coffee; we didn't get a pen for signing the bill. That's an impressive array of mistakes for a 50min meal."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner the other night and sat at the bar, which is the place to be. Craft scratch cocktails and friendly service. Brandt was wonderful, providing great conversation and cocktails! Will be back!"}
{"text":"This was our third time at the restaurant for a special occasion. Check in, despite an OpenTable reservation, was a little odd but our waitress made up for a less than stellar start. 
We appreciated the question as to our time limitations and the fact that the table was ours for the evening was a positive.
Three courses, cocktails and two bottles of wine later, our group was very satisfied with the food and service. All four starters and entrees were different and all very good. Yes, we spent $300 with tax and tip but a great Mother's Day dinner."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Most recently, came here for Thanksgiving night dinner.  Made a reservation on Open Table, and this was the only downside to the trip in.  Our reservation was at 545, at 600 we were still waiting.  I asked if we could take a booth in the bar area (they had open tables in there) and they said yes.  I guess the wait is only for the dining room.  Score!  My husband could watch the game and we could have an awesome dinner.  Anyway.  We both ordered clam chowder as an app.  Their clam chowder is some of the best I have ever had.  The bread they bring to the table is great too.  We asked for more though and never got it, which was fine because I did not want the extra calories anyway, right?  :).  For meals, I had ceasar salad with a crab cake, and my husband had mahi mahi w/some kind of tropical fruit topping, mashed potatoes and broccoli.  Both meals were fabulous.  I ended up with $25 off my meal w/my rewards card that I did not even know I had (I guess it was a credit from my birthday or something) so that rocked too.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"This review is for the happy hour only.

I definitely think that McCormick & Schmick's happy hour is one of the best kept secrets in town. Being a high-end seafood restaurant, being able to sample their rotating menu for less $6 a plate is a great deal.

The happy hour runs Monday thru Friday 3:30-6:30 PM and 9:30 to around 11:00 PM or whenever they close. The menu changes daily, but some of the staples include $3.95 cheese burger and fries, which when considering the quality of the burger is definitely worth the price. California rolls, fish tacos, and chicken wings round out the HH basics for around $5.00.

But, one of the great things that makes this happy hour.... well happier, is their rotating menu. The HH menu is printed daily with several different items available each day. One day it might be nachos and orange chicken, other times they'll throw popcorn chicken and parmesan chips on there. The staff is nice enough that if you call ahead they will tell you what the day's offerings are. I've been lucky to try a range of their HH dishes can I can tell you that they are given the same attention to detail and quality that they offer to the main entrees during dinner time. There is however, a $3.50 required beverage purchase for happy hour. The service is representative of a upscale restaurants and never lacking during the times I have been there."}
{"text":"Service was great and there was nothing wrong with our food, but it probably won't be a go-to spot for us. The atmosphere is a little drab in my opinion. It just feels like a chain restaurant. There's no character or charm to it. The food was of good quality but we weren't blown away or anything.

I ordered a steak with mashed potatoes and it arrived on a huge plate that made my meal seem really sad. I was a little disappointed that sides are not included in the price of the meal, but I guess this is common with most steak restaurants. My boyfriend got a pasta dish that he also thought was ok. 

I can't bring myself to leave 3 stars because nothing was bad or wrong with our experience, and the service was pretty good!"}

{"text":"Always wanted to try. I wasn't impressed.  The atmosphere is really good but the service was really lacking. As a FOH manager, I can be more critical then most. One of my key indicators is beverage refills and check backs. My dining partners tea sat empty for 10 minutes before the server checked in on us.  Server was nice, just not attentive.  The food was just ok. It was edible but didn't blow me away. I don't think I would eat here again nor would I recommend this restaurant as there are too many others in the area doing it right."}
{"text":"Tried this one for dinner at the bar, and the bartender did not have enough help to properly serve the number of customers. It took a while to get my ice tea, and my salad showed up about half the size I usually get from other McCormick and Schmick restaurants (I've gone to several of them in Houston TX area). The salad had hardly any thing on it, too. The bartender told me that this salad was how they normally make it, so I asked to talk to a manager. At this point I had already planned to give feedback to the manager and then go eat somewhere else. It was apparent that the place was short-staffed, and there was little chance of getting good service there. The manager took a while to show up, but had a new salad in hand. She didn't seem interested in hearing what I had to say, and I walked down the street to Capital Grille, where I had an excellent experience."}
{"text":"Floor in the entry could have used a vacuum.

Service was pretty good. Waitress forgot to bring one thing.

Overall the food was average, not great. Definitely overpriced for what it was. They gave me a pieces of a sushi roll and the rice tasted like it was hard and dried out.

I probably will not return."}
{"text":"I went here before the John Legend show (4-13-14) and enjoyed the dinner service. I arrived with my friend who took part in the complimentary valet service (which is available until 10 p.m.) and was immediately seated at the table with the rest of our party.

For drinks, I ordered their agave 'rita cocktail which was delicious and not too overpowering on the alcohol. The waitress was very patient in answering all of our questions, making suggestions, and offering substitutions for our meals. 

For my meal, I ordered the stuffed shrimp which came with white cheddar mash and roasted seasonal veggies. I do not have a negative thing to say about the meal: the shrimp were generously stuffed with lump crab meat, the cheddar mash was creamy, and the veggies still had a bit of a crunch to them.

For dessert, I ordered the creme brulee which had a nice crunchy top and creamy custard texture topped off with berries.

Overall, my first experience dining at M&S was delicious and look forward to future meals."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! The flavors were perfect down to the side dishes. It's a bit pricey, but I can't complain about anything."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!! Especially during Happy Hour. Their food is delicious!! 

During Happy Hour, their drinks and appetizers are fairly priced for the quality of food. My favorite appetizer is the mussels. They are amazing! It's a must try. Although the portion is small, the mussels come in a tomato sauce with fresh herbs and toast. I also like their firecracker shrimp tacos. They are delicious!  You get three shrimp tacos.

I also come here during lunch. The dishes are a bit pricey but I enjoy every bite of it. I like ordering the shrimp Fettuccini dish. The sauce is not too heavy and you get big size shrimps. 

Overall,  I really like this restaurant and come here quite often! Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Had a solid experience here with group of 5. 

Service was excellent. 

Ambience was very nice.  Clean, modern, darker woods. 

Food- very good, but not exceptional.   We got stuffed mushrooms, shrimp kiss, and shrimp cocktail for appetizers.  Meals of salmon, shrimp trio and a filet.  All very good. Dessert of Apple pie, chocolate mousse cake and banana bread pudding along with espresso and cappuccino. 

Overall, it was very good.  I would not hesitate to return.  I found think it was a step below the quality we had the night before at Flemings."}
{"text":"I need to update my previous review where I only gave them three stars... reason being, they have some newer people who are now making their service bump up a notch and they are truly providing a better service and experience. 

One day last week, we chose to go there for a quick bite... We had fish tacos on the brain and unfortunately for us, that day Fish tacos were only on the happy hour menu and it was past happy hour.  When we asked our server if we could get them, she checked and came back with a yes.  We expected to pay the normal entree portion and did not mind doing so as it was what we had wanted.  When the bill arrived, we saw that they charged us the 1.95 per taco happy hour price.  Needless to say, we appreciate what she did for us and applaud her being so kind, helpful and generous unexpectedly. 

We will definitely come back since she took such good care of us!"}
{"text":"I was reached by the district manager and he apologized and was very understanding of my prior incident. They also gave me the opportunity to return back to their restaurant for lunch. And what an experience and enjoyable time I had with my co-workers."}
{"text":"I must say M&S disappointed me on this occasion. This restaurant is set amonst what I call Vegas's \"Restaurant Row\". Set into the North end of Flamingo and Paradise Rd's, you find Bahama Breeze, Steak Houses, Moroccan Food, Sushi, you name it. M&S is supposed to fill in the upscale (no pun intended) Seafood option. It bleeds as it barely makes the cut. The feel of the place is very Vegas on the outside, the exterior of the building is very warm and restaurant like inviting, with Valet service as an option. Fancy huh? That's the end of that. Inside you find young attractive host/hostess that are busy chatting away at the entry, OLD servers walking around like \"little baby elephants\" to borrow a term from Gordon Ramsey. As with most troubled restaurants, the servers will DEFINITELY treat you with as much kindess as the price on your bill will sum up to. PERSONAL ACCT: Dec 30, 2008 - We are greeted by a giggling group of young adults at the door, and kindly directed to our seating, the restaurant was uncomfortably warm on the inside (faulty thermostat maybe?). Then our elderly server came to talk to the current specials of the day, making sure to go into long detail on the most expensive dish of the menu. I remember...Chilean Seabass off the coast, special licensing, supplying all M&S restaurants...IN MY HEAD AT THIS TIME: \"Got It! Can we order now? And No, we won't be ordering that Thanks. Can we have some Water now?\" The server acted very kindly and inviting at the start  THAT IS UNTIL we ordered a  plate we'd being sharing, some \"Filtered Tap Water\", and 1 glass of Wine to also share. From that moment on the service was crap, he jumped from table to table ignoring us, no water refills once we stared i.e. requested. The food: Fish perfect, Veggies perfect. Starch uhhh! Luke warm NO-SALT Lumpy Mashed Potatoes. We're from Portland where M&S got their start, I'd recommend any M&S in the Portland area but definitely NOT the one is Vegas unless it gets a staff overhaul."}
{"text":"The service at the Tryon St location was amazing. The manager Sean Williamson and the bar tenders \"Brant\" and \"Craft\" made it an evening to remember and treated us so well. Of course the food was great too!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed. Small portions for the price!  Go to Bonefish instead, don't waste your time.  If I were rating just the atmosphere, they would get 5 stars, that's all they have going for them. 

We were seated for a solid 15 minutes before we were even noticed. Steven shows, asked if we had time to see the menu....my reaction, \"see it, dude, we could take your order\"!  He did his best to make it better--hats off. 

The entries we blahhhh...I could kick myself for the $110 I sent at this place relative to the quality of the food. Lobster mash potatoes were hard and spongy, my stuff shrimp were way over cooked, ALL 7 of them. 

Never going back to this place!"}
{"text":"Alright, the food is amazing. 
The service is so bad though! It took nine minutes before anyone greeted our table. It took twenty minutes to get our tea. The drink from the bar was wrong and our server never came back to check on us, so I had to walk it back to the bar myself. The manager (I guess that's who she was) was running around like crazy and we couldn't catch her to get help. Only one glass of water all night -- no refills."}
{"text":"I've never actually eaten here, so my review is purely based on their happy hour specials! It's a great place to stop in for some drinks if you work downtown. $4.50 domestic beers. $4.00 well mixed drinks and $6 wines and cocktails. $7 martinis. It's tough to find better deals on drinks downtown! When my friends and I stop in after work, Megan is typically the bartender and takes amazing care of us. Very friendly, quick service and delicious mixed drinks!

They also have a very reasonably priced happy hour appetizer menu, starting at $3."}
{"text":"Service was slow. No one really there and we thought waitress forgot about us. Mac and cheese really good and dessert best I've had in looking time. Food made up for forgetful waitress...took about 3-4 trips for her to remember bread, butter, tea. I'll go back just for dessert!"}
{"text":"Came here last night and the service and food was great. When we arrived we were immediately seated with no wait even with out reservations. Our waitress was very nice and knowledgeable about the items on the menu. 

The food arrived in a timely manner and of course that was the best part. I had the stuffed shrimp which came with mash potatoes and green beans. My wife had the stuffed salmon which was also great. The meals were fresh and couldn't have tasted any better

Overall great experience here and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place may not be a great bar-bar at night, but it's definitely a great Happy Hour joint with a good dinner vibe as well.  The Happy Hour specials give some great appetizers and burgers from $2-$8 which is A-OK in my book.  Although the drinks are regular price, the food half off is amazing.  If you really want to have a great time, go on mondays when HH lasts until close (4-7 normally).  This way you can snack and drink for dinner and be satisfied without hurting your wallet."}
{"text":"This review is based on my first and only visit to this location. 

The location is great. Valet parking makes getting here a breeze and everyone greets you with a smile. The restaurant itself is nicely furnished and the seats are comfy. For being a higher-end restaurant, the menu had more selection that I was initially anticipating. The service was great and my waiter knew the menu very well. 

The only reason why I am giving McCormick & Schmick's 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the food. The presentation was amazing but the taste and portion size didn't blow me away. While the food here was very good, I don't think it commands the steep asking price."}
{"text":"We stopped in last night to celebrate our marriage and my husband's birthday. We had no reservation but there were only 4 other tables in the entire resturaunt . we were seated immediatley and was told Brenna would be wish us shortly. 5 minutes later we were greeted by a young man so clearly not Brenna. He poured us water and asked if we wanted any other drinks. We said no and he left 

My husband and i looked over the menu snd decided what app and food we wanted. 15 minutes later we were still waiting for someone to return. Finally after another 5 minutes we decided to leave. Entrees were $30 here. Apps and drinks were $15 each which of course was fine and we knew this coming in. We were about to spend $100 and waiting 20 minutes to be formally greeted other than water is uncalled for. With a $100 check the server should receive $20 tip. I refused to pay a server that nice of a tip and have to sit there and wait.

We went to our local pub and ordered apps good and multiple beers. Our bills was $50 and all were thrilled that we just got married. 

Not worth the hype. I will never return here. I'll make my own damn steak and lobster tail. Bye"}
{"text":"This review is for the bar side / happy hour. We have ventured here twice for their (awesome) happy hour. 

The first time my entire office stopped in on a Friday. It was extremely busy and packed in the bar area.. can you blame anyone? TGIF right? The food and drinks took a little while to be served.. well over a half hour.. but like I said it was extremely busy and I had a feeling our server was new. If you want to experience McCormick & Schmick's happy hour, I'd suggest it not being on a Friday.

Bobby and I stopped in yesterday to enjoy happy hour (a Wednesday) It wasn't crowded at all and we enjoyed ourselves. I wish I had taken a picture of the happy hour menu. It's ordered by price ($3.99, $4.99, ect) & everything is under $6 or $7. There are a few options for each price category. They have nice options too! The drink menu is similar. During my first trip, I ordered a margarita. Last night, I had a glass of Chardonnay & Bobby enjoyed a glass of Merlot. Don't judge us, we know it was \"bottom-shelf\" wine for the price that we paid, but we enjoyed it, haha! 

Last night, I ordered the burger & fries ($3.99!) I enjoyed my meal and bobby enjoyed his calamari. 

You're missing out if you've never experienced their happy hour! It's from 5-7pm M-F"}
{"text":"First and last visit here. My husband and I were meeting a group of friends to have dinner. 12 total. We had a reservation and as we waited on the rest of our party I noticed the grade of such a fancy restaurant to only be a 91. Red flag for me. Usually I would leave any place below 95 but like I said we were meeting friends and had a reservation. When we received our food half of it was cold. No one was happy about that. The portions were very small for such steap prices...4 stalks of asparagus cost like 8 dollars. The bread is awful. Taste like communion crackers. No flavor at all. I normally do not go to places with such a hefty price tag on there food but it was a rare night out with friends. No one in our group was impressed with our food nor our wait staff. We got 0 refills on our drinks and seen our waitress once before our check was brought to us. My husband ordered the 8oz filet mignon with mashed potatoes and asparagus I ordered the 6oz (had to send it back due to it being completely raw in the middle), the wedge salad, and mushrooms and we both got water...total 99 dollars!!!! Never again. Update: [once I posted this review someone reached out to me to let me know that someone would call me to speak to me about my experience. No one ever called me. So the rating stays at a 1 for Me. Like I said never going back.]"}
{"text":"Right across from my work in the Hughes center so this had become somewhat of a go to. Good happy hour, nice patio, and very good small bites for said happy hour (flat bread, sliders, calamari)  In most other towns this would be a top tier restaurant. Unfortunately in vegas it just has way too much competition. 

I'd definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a good meal away from the riff raff of the strip. Given that this was one of the nicest restaurants in my home town,  it seems odd saying \"save some money and go To McCormick\", but it's true.

Friendly service. Good food. Solid choice."}
{"text":"The first time I ever ate at a McCormick and Schmick's was in Downtown Portland and I loved it so much that I returned again and again whenever in Portland. Sadly, that McCormick and Schmick's is now gone and also gone is the high quality at their other restaurants. This restaurant is no exception.

While in LV on business, we stopped in for Happy Hour. Their HH prices are really good, but the food quality is sub-par. We ordered margherita flatbread pizza, which was pretty bland, rosemary fries, which were a bit on the limp side, calamari which was tender but mostly devoid of flavor, and ahi tuna which was a tiny serving, wasn't very fresh and was overcooked. The wine was the best part of the experience.

Our waitress was attentive and the atmosphere is ok, but also not very special. The other McCormick and Schmick's restaurants I have been to have far more character and personality. This restaurant feels very suburban strip mall-y."}
{"text":"A few of us went here a few days ago for happy hour beverages and food.  We were all rather impressed.  The drinks were extremely affordable and service was decent.  We tried 7 different items on the happy hour menu.  Overall the food was very tasty."}
{"text":"This is a very nice downtown location, which was recommended to us by our business associates after a meeting.

I give a good, solid recommendation for this place.  The food was good, tea was good, service was good - I have no complaints at all.

Hubby had shrimp and grits, and I had a salad topped with salmon.  Hubby absolutely wiped his plate clean, and I did a pretty good job myself!

The decor is upscale; this would be an excellent choice for a business lunch."}
{"text":"I used to work here my first summer after college as a hostess and cocktail waitress.  Hated working here, but really enjoy coming in as a guest.  

I next to never do the full dinner simply because if I'm gonna spend that money on a fancy meal, I'll do it somewhere that isn't a chain. 

The Happy Hour is really great.  I don't eat meat, but their $5 hamburger is one of the best deals in the Southside.  The fish tacos and calamari are always delicious.  The atmosphere is great for when you just wanna unwind after work.

Service is hit or miss, but the food and cocktails are always pleasing."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch a while back and was deciding on whether I should try this place again before writing this review...decided now that probably not.  Here are the reasons why:

1.) Waited 30 mins before the supposedly delish sourdough bread to come out.  Unfortunately, that basket of bread was cold.  We had to request for another warm basket.

2.) We told the waiter that we need to leave the restaurant by 1:15pm (it was 11:55am at the time of the comment), to please get the food out to us ASAP.  He said he will make sure of it.  WRONG! We barely see him and when all the food came out, it was close to 12:50pm.  We had to rush through our meal, and it was not worth the wait or price!

3.) Food:
     a. Spicy Shrimp Bruschetta:  WTF was this!?!  This was the nastiest tasting shrimp bruschetta I have ever had!  The shrimp had a weird texture and there seem to be a chipotle flavor, nothing else.  Complete waste of money.
    b. Lump Blue Crab and Shrimp Cake sandwich:  I was so excited to try this and was totally taken aback by how tasteless and dry this sandwich was.  Where was the shrimp? Where was the blue crab?  Where was the watercress salad?  So I asked for the watercress salad to go with the sandwich. 
   c. Tempura Snapper (fresh catch of the day): Snapper was overcooked.  Dang it.  No redemption here.

Bad food, poor customer service, NOT COMING BACK!!"}
{"text":"Ok so this review is solely off the dessert as my friend and I were on a pretty indulgent spree of eating out and drinking wine at different places this weekend and this was our last stop for something sweet to eat and bubbles to wash it down with. First of all if you go get the apple walnut pie dessert and I'm pretty sure I'm off with the name of it but its the only one like it on the dessert menu. I don't care if you don't like nuts neither do I get it anyway its to die for. Honestly one of the best apple desserts I have had in a long time. We also got the cr√®me brulee which is my all time favorite dessert and can be picky about them. I loved this one the hard sugar coating on top actually had to be cracked I have been to a lot of places where the sugar top is barely there at all. I also loved the fact that when I asked about what kind of berries came on it the bartender immediately asked me if I would like extra. Its like she was inside my brain as she stated that there can never be too many fresh berries on top of your cr√®me brulee. I had a rose chandon split with the dessert and I'm pretty sure this is one of the best combinations Ive had in a long time. I wish I had caught the bartenders name she was super sweet and really attentive she was short with short bright blonde hair and was really amazing. The only thing that was even semi unpleasant about the visit was the really strange music that was playing and although my friend and I were having a blast it was really noticeable it was like some kind of weird techno dance music that didn't seem to fit the restaurants vibe at all. Normally this type of thing I never notice but this was unavoidable and kinda comical to be honest. 

Parking is terrible just terrible as its uptown and super busy like all the time but I'm pretty sure I saw that they had valet but it could have been the place next door so don't quote me on that. All in all a great experience and will be back to try the regular food soon!"}
{"text":"Good meal, we were early so can not tell you about crowds, it was dead, a lot of specials through the week, so call and ask what the day is.

Teneal was our server and she was amazing and helpful guided us to the best meal choices and it was hot and delicious, not a thing to complain about.

Do not give a 5 the first visit out, just is not right, just like giving a one on first visit would not be right.

To me you have to earn a rating and guess what I gave them a 4 because today, still holding a reservation vote on them they need to earn the 5."}
{"text":"Seafood Excellence!!!!
Went here for my birthday and the attention to detail from the time I valeted my car till I sat down at my table. The menu had my name on it and the waiter was personable and treated me as if I was the king of Great Britain! 
I raw oysters that were fresh and delicious. For my main course I had stuffed shrimp which I highly recommend. This is a nice spot for a special occasion brunch or even drinks after work."}
{"text":"Cold bread for starters and a very small portion for the entree good customer service though"}
{"text":"My five year old daughter was given the important job of choosing a restaurant for dinner out following her ballet recital.  She decided she wanted fish.  Good choice, young lady.  With four adults and four children we decided to give McCormick and Schmick's a try.  We were so pleased.  The service was excellent.  The food was great! I usually don't drag the fam to chain restaurants but I have to say we will definitely go back! Even the overall price, for this many people, was completely reasonable.  I was most impressed by the fact that the children's menu had seafood choices on it - not just the regular kiddie options.  I would go back for a date night, out with friends, or with the kids.  I definitely recommend this spot."}
{"text":"They can't even get your steak right the way you want it. They screwed up 3 times on my steak left it red red inside and I told them that's it I don't want anything more. They tried giving me a free dessert to calm me down but it didn't work at all. I refused it. Worst thing about it was that I was starving to eat dinner. I won't be coming back here ever."}
{"text":"Service was good. Had the four small plates for the table.  All four were fish dishes and all were wry good. and preparation was also very good. Warm bread was good as were sleds and soup."}
{"text":"A few of us came here after the Elite event at The Hard Rock Cafe for Happy Hour. We ordered a cheeseburger and come of their little bites;

Mussels, Salmon Tartare, Shrimp Shooters, Grilled Corn on the Cob, Fried Mushrooms....Sound good??? Unfortunately they Sounded better than they tasted, and some of their items just didn' fly with my palate.

Don't think a return visit is in the future, or ever, with tons of other Happy Hour deals in town with even cheaper prices and much tastier food...ALOHA!!!

YELP 365 CHALLENGE-(13/365) \"Not-so-Happy Hour\""}
{"text":"Went here on a first date on a Friday night.  We sat around 8:15, and it was pretty quiet!  We started with a bottle of wine and didn't do any apps or salad, went right to the entrees.  We both got salmon- me cedar plank, he the stuffed salmon.  Though both salmon, very different tasting!  Mine was on the healthy side- you could taste the butter in his (haha prob the point!) but it was delicious!

The service was good.  A bit pricey considering portions.  Free valet parking.  All went well!"}
{"text":"With all the more expensive restaurants asking $50.00 and up for a Thanksgiving meal, I found the $24.99 per person price to be outstanding!  The food was delicious and you could choose from a traditional Thanksgiving meal with all the trimmings, fish or steak! Well worth the low cost!!  I still don't understand how they were able to keep the costs down and the other restaurants with their high standards charged an arm and a leg!?"}
{"text":"I had a great experience here the other night.  We were in town and feeling a bit under the weather.  We decided on this place, but I was hesitant due to it being a chain.  I wanted a real Pittsburgh place.

We get to the restaurant just before our reservation and are seated in moments.  The hostess was very nice.  The waitress came along in a very timely manner and was also as nice as can be.  Everything got off to a great start.

I ordered the Steelhead (It's Alaskan, but sounded Pittsburgh), a bowl of New England Chowder and a beer.  The chowder was delicious.  Creamy, meaty and oh so good.  The steelhead was absolutely wonderful.  Tender, moist, delicious.  It came with spinach that was also very good, not overdone or over buttered.

We found we were very full and didn't go for dessert, although I did take an Irish coffee.  Very good in place of a dessert.

Don't skip this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"We had trout and ribeye.  Both were good but the steak wasn't seasoned very well and the orzo with the trout was pretty greasy.  The wine list was pretty good for bottles but not much selection by the glass.  Still, I had a nice glass of Malbec and my wife had a nice Riesling.  Good dinner but nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Today a manager called and apologized for his waitress's unprofessional disposition the night she was my server. I sincerely appreciated the fact that he cared enough about me the customer to listen to my side of the story. I expressed to him I didn't want to get Karen in trouble, but if I had been the manager I would have wanted to be aware of this situation. As I said in the previous review the food was good. It was the service that wasn't. He reassured me he would speak with Karen and that his focus would be just to help her improve not discipline her for her actions. That's all I'd ever ask for. I'm sure she just had an \"off day,\" but maybe she should have literally taken the day off instead of being such a poor waitress that night."}
{"text":"Our server was so sweet. She helped us pick out a great lunch. The host was really nice and funny too."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 bottles of wine before we picked one they had! That process dragged out too long. The table next to us, that was sat just after us was eating dinner while our cork was getting pulled. 

I got the Cioppino- a dish I typically get in seafood places. This is Landry's, it's cajun- so this should be good. Nope! Just so so, with a bland broth. WHAT?! REALLY?! Sure, it had seafood in it- but nothing exciting to note. but let me hang on \"the broth was bland\"...such a shame."}
{"text":"I have been to M&S in Orange County and was impressed, so when I went to LV for business I decided to take my brokers here for lunch.  

Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeting by the front desk and was immediately taken to a table.  For lunch time, the place was surprisingly quiet and empty.  

While looking through the menu, the selection was small.  I decided to go simple and ordered the Salmon Rigatoni -  Asparagus, Mushroom,  Artichokes, Pesto Cream Sauce with a glass of iced tea.

Our food came out within reasonable time, great tasting food.  However, the waiter was a bit slow on refilling our drinks.  It took him a very long time and by the time he came back with refills, our meal was just about over.  

Also, be very careful when the bill comes.  I looked it over the next day when I went to expense it and saw that either 

A) They charge full price for refills or
B) They overcharged me by additional 4 drinks = $12"}
{"text":"I saw an advertisement for a surf and turf special on Sunday's and Monday's ....I decided to go in on Sunday to the downtown location. The special was not advertised so I asked the bartender as I sat down at the bar. I asked a few questions i.e. Is there soup or salad included ,what was included in the special. I was told potatoes and was not offered a salad appetizer or even a glass of wine. the bartender just stood watching football and occasionally complained of being tired to the waitress.I did notice a manager? , but football was more important than the one guest that was sitting at the bar.I was not acknowledged.The food was fine but it would have been nice to have a cup of soup to start, a glass of wine maybe.I was the only person in the bar area you would think they would try to capitalize on every sale they could."}
{"text":"Idk don't even know where to start. It was just awful! Save your money and go to Chima's or Ruth Chris. Had reservations for 10pm for me and my fianc√© to celebrate. Stuck us in the back corner and leave us sitting there for 25mins to be exact.I literally had to get up go find the General manager Sean myself. He immediately started to give me excuses rather than a apology. Sent a out a free appetizer and that was it. What made it even worst is that by the time we got our food it was 10:50pm, which my order still didn't come out correct.  Completely unaware that they close at 11pm. Once 11pm struck they turned on all the lights in the restaurant (it's usually dimmed to set the mood). I get it but I feel like they shouldn't take reservations that close to closing time if they are going to be handled that way. I've never had such a bad experience. And the manager never came back by at the end of the meal to make sure we were satisfied. Safe to say I'll never go back !!!!"}
{"text":"Wtf M&S, you make me feel like a schmuck for spending a Grant in your establishment. Chose this place for CRW because we thought it'd be a fancy schmancy safe bet that would accommodate the gluten free (not me). 

What made this experience less than satisfactory for me was the service (or just our waiter), which is one of the elements a restaurant of this type should have down solid. Took forever to wave down our server when we wanted to put in a drink order and another millennium to place our food orders. However, he was very prompt in bringing out the check right when he put down our desserts. Came back a few times while we were still trying to enjoy our desserts for the check, only to be told that we hadn't even looked at it yet. Just let me eat my chunk of chocolate in peace dammit. And, you're a waiter at an establishment with a decent wine list, have a couple on mind to recommend, don't just stand there and stare at us. Also, when she pointed to the zin, she didn't point to the most expensive zin, which is what you charged us for, ass. Anddd, when someone asks for a gluten free substitution, it isn't that hard to ask the chef if that is possible. Patrons should not have to keep reminding their servers for food that won't kill them. 

Okayyy, on to the food. We all had the salad as the first course, which was tasty albeit a tad over dressed, the green beans were a nice touch. I had the chilean seabass, which has dethrowned salmon as my favorite fish, and it was served with a side of mushroom jasmine rice (that, strangely, tasted exactly like taiwanese gluttonous rice, yeah that's what it's called) all sitting in a bath of pepper broth, which wasn't very peppery. (side note, why mention the daikon sprouts (not diakon as it's spelled on the menu, spell check guys) when it's just a garnish that adds nothing to the flavor?!) This dish, despite my ramblings, was actually good. The fish was cooked just right, the flavors were there and I much enjoyed the rice. I was also able to try the grilled ahi tuna, which was solid, but the baby bok choy it was served with looked like it could've been cooked by me, meaning it was sad and wilty. My other buddies got the petite filet and asked for medium. Now, I'm not an expert in cooking meat, heck, I don't even eat it, but one of the filets was bright red and oozing blood, that is not medium. 

The dessert, only one choice for the CRW menu (let's step it up here people), was supposed to be a chocolate silk cake. It was more of a solid-block-of-cold-chocolate cake with a crushed oreo crust doused in raspberry sauce. It was tasty for the first few bites, but none of us could finish it all. 

I've been to other M&S's and have always had good experiences, don't know what happened here. Word of advice, no McCormick and Schmick's for restaurant week ever again, there are tons of better (and local) places to try out and drop big bucks."}
{"text":"All good things must come to an end. Their famous happy hour is no more  That was the main reason to come here.  Wednesdays they still have shrimp and oysters, other than that,  not so much.  Looking for othet options."}
{"text":"Went for my cousin's bday. We had a great time. The fish and chips were great and she loved her bourbon salmon. It was all good. It's kind of expensive but it was worth it. My server I believe her name was Sara was so amazing. She was so friendly and attentive. Lots of parking it's next to the mall. It was a lot of people there. It was the Xmas eve so i guess people didn't want to cook. It's a nice location. Clean and the decor is looks like a high end pub. They brought her a free small molten cake for her bday. I didn't even tell her she insisted when she overheard me telling her happy bday. She was so sweet. Customer service was excellent. Will go back when I'm in the mood for seafood. Check them out and ask for Sara."}
{"text":"Delish!!! The shrimp kisses are divine! Staff is awesome and very friendly. I got the rib eye steak which was prepped just the way I like it, medium well and full of flavor. If your here for the weekend or passing through I will say this is a stop that you won't regret!!!"}
{"text":"Not a place I will return to. First trip: Sat at bar area never got the waitress. Left without service and told manager I would not return. Well I did, stopped in with my wife, hoping it would not be a repeat, but it was. 20 minutes to get first drink, never returned to ask if we wanted snacks/food. Bar tender only one trying to serve bar area tables and bar."}
{"text":"I had the iceberg wedge salad, center cut filet mignon with the  goat cheese mashed potatoes.  Everything tasted great, and the filet was juicy and cooked exactly as I requested.  The complimentary bread was fresh and warm, and the waiter was prompt and attentive. Excellent experience."}
{"text":"Thanks to the fact that the manager and the server himself apologized profusely at the end of our lunch and comped the entire lunch, I'm giving McCormick and Schmick's 3 stars and I would be willing to try them again.   We even left a 20 dollar tip on a meal that would have cost ust about 50 bucks.

Backtracking a little bit...

My wife and I met for lunch and we decided to try McCormick's.   I ordered the Seafood Macaroni & Cheese, served with scallops and shrimps.   My wife went with a couple of appetizers:  crab cakes as well as coconut shrimp.   For drinks, I opted for the Sweet Tea and my wife got an Arnold Palmer.

5 minutes went by and our server brought us our drinks and some bread.

Another 5 minutes went by and I got my side salad, which was interestingly served in a wonton wrapper shell.   Hmmmm....

Next came over 25 minutes of waiting during which we saw several tables go through 2 courses while we didn't get any more food.   My wife, frustrated, finally went to talk to the manager and our food appeared an instant later.

The pasta was good but, errr...  now it could be something about East coast versus West coast, and I happily posted a picture of the seafood Macaroni & Cheese I was served, but... Well, in the San Francisco Bay Area, we'd call that seafood fettucini with cream sauce.   Those were most certainly not Macaroni and, as far as I can tell, there was absolutely no cheese.   Well, there might have been a little bit of parmesan in the sauce, I'll concede that much.    Still, this sure as hell wasn't Mac & Cheese.  It was a tasty dish, and there was a generous portion of properly cooked scallops and shrimp.   Still, I'd wanted Mac & Cheese and I felt let down.

The manager came by our table and apologized for the delay and said our meal was comped.   All in all, service was impeccable (when they didn't forget about us) but I still cannot give them more than 3 stars since I feel like my dish was big time false advertising."}
{"text":"Had the rainbow trout with dynamite crab for lunch - so yummy! Ordered the blue carb dip but the chef hadn't prepped it yet so had to do without appetizer. M&S sangria was nice. Fresh sourdough bread kept coming and went great with the really nice lobster bisque. (Which portion was small & not worth $12.99). Other than that, can't wait to come back and try the happy hour. One of the best chain seafood restaurants we've been to!"}
{"text":"I need to start this by saying, I really wanted to be impressed... but I left feeling underwhelmed. My boyfriend and I made reservations for late Saturday evening to enjoy a nice dinner in the city. We were seated promptly- but then waited close to 10 minutes for anyone to come to our table, I had to get up and speak to the hostess/manager to find a server to order cocktails. Once we had a server- he was very prompt and quick to help, but the entire experience felt rushed. We ordered appetizers of shrimp cocktail and the lobster bisque- my soup was watered down to say the least and his shrimp cocktail was delicious, but the presentation left much to be desired. Our entrees came not too long after -  I ordered the sesame salmon and my boyfriend the surf & turf. My salmon was okay  (quite over cooked) but my mushroom risotto and Brussel sprouts were great ! My boyfriend enjoyed the lobster tail but it was almost comical how small it was. His steak was also a little over cooked but he enjoyed it and finished it. We decided we didn't want to do dessert after just not being that impressed with anything. I will say - for the price, I expected more. A more complete dining experience ! We both left feeling disappointed."}
{"text":"I was downtown for the Ron White concert and happen to try this spot out! It had the best coconut shrimp appetizer! Also got the scallop dinner and they were phenomenal! Bit pricy but I highly recommend trying it. If your looking for a cocktail I loved the Cucumber Mint Martini very fresh and tasty :)"}
{"text":"My partner ate both lunch and dinner there the other night and ended up so sick I had to fly to vegas to take care of her.  She had steelhead for lunch (had to send it back to cook it more as it was raw - should have been her first clue) and oysters with a salad for dinner.  She spent the night getting intimate with the toilet and the garbage can next to it.  She will never go there again.  Steer clear."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch. Service was great. Food was so tasty. I never thought of them as such a great lunch spot but I do now. The clam chowder was the best. I also liked the decor, it was warm and inviting and everything felt nice and clean. Can't wait to try some other things.The only down side was there wasn't very much salmon in my salmon meal.. just little chunks.. hope it was just a fluke."}
{"text":"Have gone to McCormick & Schmick's in Vegas by Hughes Parkway, several times in the past few days, both for lunch and happy hour... the happy hour is still good, especially the $5 cheeseburger with fries, and the minimum beverage purchase is reasonable.  Lunch was also good, although consistently the caesar salad at McCormick's across the country, is so not worth it...just say \"no\" to ever order it, as a main course or as a side.  Landry's Club membership also as good as it's always been...high recommend it for all of Landry's restaurants..."}
{"text":"Pricey yummy good food.   I've been another one in SoCal, I was in town with a group of friends passing though Vegas.  We wanted to go there since we were all very hungry for seafood, and it was in walking distance from where we where staying.   I ordered the Scallops and Shrimp Linguine with a white wine sauce, which was quite good.  The service was excellent as one would expect from McCormick & Schmick's.  The waiter was very knowledgeable with the food and gave an honest opinion.   

Nice quiet atmosphere, nice place to take a date if you are willing to spend a little more money and want a quiet evening.  

If you've worked up an appetite and are not looking for a quiet evening, spend a few more dollars and find a good buffet."}
{"text":"Happy hour, hel-looooooo great deal!

In case you didn't know--the McCormick in Southpark has Happy Hour until 630 and the Uptown location has Happy Hour until 7 (and valet parking--just tip the guy and you don't have to pay in the deck).

Great specials--my favorite are the fish tacos (mahi!) that are JUST $2. Who can beat that? And they're huge? And try the tuna medallions (magical). They also have special drinks and wines just for Happy hour. Make sure to check out their special menu!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has an excellent happy hour Monday thru Friday 3:30-6:30 PM and 9:30 to around 11:00 PM. 
We went to the late happy hour and started with one large fried fish taco that was very moist and flaky.  It only cost one dollar.  We than had a half pound cheddar cheese burger with lettuce, tomato,onion and pickle and crispy french fries.  It was  better than most burgers that cost over 9 dollars and the price was only $ 2.95.  I had a Coors light for $ 3.25.  The service was very good and not to many people at the bar area.

Other items on the menu include cod sliders; spinach dip with chips; orange chicken $ 3.95 each; California roll; chicken wings; and salmon tartar $ 4.95 each;
 plus other items."}
{"text":"Pretty good happy hour....good choice of appetizers and drinks....loved the seafood stuffed mushrooms...."}
{"text":"Took a party of 13 for a celebration dinner last night.  The restaurant assured us there would not be a problem with a group this size on a Saturday night.

At least 20 minutes late getting seated.  Once seated, the wait-staff tried extremely hard, but the restaurant was so overbooked, the staff could not keep up with drink, appetizer or meal orders.  The wait time was so long, we had to ask the restaurant to serve two in our party before the rest of the group because they had to leave a LITTLE earlier.  Some drink orders were never served and some meals were cold.  Our party would have bought more drinks, deserts etc., but it was taking so long to get served we passed.

Bottom line.  If you are going to dinner on a night when restaurants are typically busy, you might look into other options."}
{"text":"Yes I do spend a lot of time dinning my clients since I'm in sales and I will share a trick to you that would impress your clients at restaurant the caliber of McCormick.

I already know the service would be great here, but I go further and give my server a couple of twenties already and I tell them to make sure they address me by my first name and make sure they are very attentive to my table since it's a business luncheon.

My clients get impress most of the time and they think I'm a dine here all the time!!!  Okay that's pretty much what I do when I take out my client on any restaurant as for the rating....


The restaurant takes reservation online and if you have an iPad or iPhone even better!!!  I made my last minute and they were able to seat me.  As for the food, if you've dine at McCormick you know it's a different menu all the time and all the fish is fresh!!!  I do recommend the lobster bisque soup, it seems that they always have that soup."}
{"text":"I definitely give this restaurant a 1 star. I order steak well potatoes and corn. Remind you paying for my meal is not a problem.  When my food came out I had mixed vegetables and rare meat. The waiter said she would replace the vegetables and then she'll get the manager. The manager says to me do you want me to warm the rare steak up that I asked for well done. Huh hell no!!!!!!! The manager only took off $20 of $200 ticket!!!! Sorry management this definitely needs to be addressed. And then we were told he was a new manager #Sorry"}
{"text":"The management at this restaurant could not be any better. Not only are they attentive and genuine but every visit I feel more and more at home."}
{"text":"This place was fine. Nothing too ecstatic to say about it. None of the food wowed me and overall I thought it was just a mediocre experience. 

We started with stuffed mushrooms, the mozzarella flatbread and calamari. Do not get the flatbread it is like a burnt tomato flavored cracker with a small bit of toppings and hardly any flavor. We didn't even finish it between six of us. The calamari was over salted and pretty typical. The stuffed mushrooms were the best of the appetizers we ordered. I ordered the ahi tuna. Like I said earlier, it was fine. The portion was smaller than I was hoping for and it just came with a scoop of plain white rice. There was a spicy slaw though that added some flavor.

My water glass, fork and side plate were all dirty. The food took forever, I think it was half an hour before salads were brought to the table."}
{"text":"Decent, but definitely not as good as the one in Portland.  Happy hour is good, and the bar is nice, but I probably wouldn't go there for much else and only if I were in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"We went there for happy hour. The service was super slow and it was not even busy. The food was ok."}
{"text":"My experience was pretty good.

Crab cakes with risotto and green beans = delicious
Seasonal strawberry cheesecake = mediocre my dad said it tasted like jello no bake
bread = mediocre at best and lacking in flavor
stuffed salmon = yum
strawberry basil mojito = awesome and straight to the head
shrimp and chicken pasta = very basic

overall it was fine. the waitress was cool but I was annoyed that she never mentioned any of their specials and we had to ask. but she was attentive and good otherwise. prices weren't bad either."}
{"text":"I've heard that the food is good.

If I ever see any, I might be able to add my opinion.

On the up side, it only took 20 minutes to get a beer.  So that's something, I guess."}
{"text":"Best happy hour - great selection of food and drinks. Recommend the firecracker shrimp. Get there a little earlier as it gets packed fast."}
{"text":"What makes a seafood restaurant pop?!

Is it the fresh catch sizzling in front of you smothered in a lemon butter sauce? Or perhaps the flaky tenderness of a salmon filet neatly presented before you with an artist's finesse? Maybe it's the crisp finish that the last Kumamoto oyster leaves on your palate before you embark on a great seafood adventure...

McCormick and Schmick will gladly take you to sea without the difficulty of chartering a ship and crew to find those gems of the ocean. Quite frankly, nothing begins a meal quite like the Oyster Sampler (12 oysters) that this great establishment can offer you. Even 3 orders later you won't feel weighed down by this fresh and juicy appetizer because it's light on the stomach and slightly sweet in taste. Aphrodisiac? I'm too busy eating to notice... then again I was also eating with a bunch of dudes, so go figure. 

On one occasion, I found myself ordering a lemon crusted tilapia that literally melted the moment it was placed on my tongue. I could feel the remainder of its hot oil sliding down my lips. It began with a warm crispy bite, and turned to a subtle, but saliva-inducing fish flavor that ended nicely with a buttery finish. The portion is huge. Once you eat one of these, you're definitely going to be set for the night. 

If you're looking for a sophisticated and clean range of flavors, I would suggest the Chilean Sea Bass or the Scarlet Snapper. Each dish is cooked perfectly and the weightlessness of each bite leaves you with no regret and addictive tendencies. Find yourself immersed in a world of nature's most raw and simple flavors that appeal to the eye as much as they do to your appetite. 

For those who enjoying going to seafood restaurants and ordering steak, there's plenty of other meat options for you to choose from, but not worth mentioning here because you should probably be re-evaluating your life choices rather than reading about other people's fish experiences.

4/5 at Tryon location for delay in food. House wasn't even half-full. At least my glass was :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a layover for work. Heard the happy hour was great. The bartender, Matt, was amazing. He showed such great hospitality and very friendly. He remembered our names and made the best Strawberry Squad I've ever tasted. When we asked him questions, he was very knowledgeable. He is a great asset to the Company. Willcoo come back later for dinner."}
{"text":"Terrible food again and terrible service. The food use to be amazing here. It seems to have went downhill..... I won't visit again. Food has no flavor very bland just yuck........ Came during restaurant week the dessert portion. Was very stingy and poorly presented."}

{"text":"Went here with my mom, who has major food allergies.  The restaurant was very accommodating and my mom really enjoyed her meal.  I also had a restaurant.com coupon which lowered their prices a bit.  The service wasn't as good as I remember, but it was still perfectly acceptable."}
{"text":"We were in there this evening and our bartender was Tacie, she was absolutely Divine helpful and just a wonderful wonderful woman every time we have gone in there we've had such great service but especially tonight she was so helpful and very accommodating the food was exceptional like always"}
{"text":"Came here while on a business trips with some  friends from work.   This was in our top 3 meals.   Shrimp kisses were top notch-pepper jack cheese then wrapped in bacon! Had some kind of blacked fish-I think mahi mahi with Andouille sausage mashed potatoes-the potatoes were the best part but the fish was also really good.  One in my party got another kind of fish that she loved and other got fried shrimp and fries.    Cant really screw those up.   And the best part of the meal was the Upside Down Candied Walnut Apple Pie-This is a must and gets 5 stars.  This was only the beginning of us not fitting in our pants while away for 2 weeks on business.

{"text":"This is the other location for McCormick and Schmick's in Charlotte.  The Southpark location is the original and this uptown location was built later.  Doesn't really matter, both locations provide great fresh and some local food choices.  Recently popped in here after work for dinner and had a delicious bowl of shrimp and grits.  Just the right spice and serving size.  The wait staff was great and the atmosphere was quiet and provided a relaxing dinner experience."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and each time is indeed a pleasure.  I love the bar area but I think my favorite thing about the place are the quaint little booths with the curtains.  That creates a little shelter that gives you some privacy during a nice romantic meal.  I'm a fan of the trout dish specifically but the fish tacos are also a great endeavor!  Service is close to 5 star and everyone seems very polished in their waiting skills.  Definitely a place I need to visit more often!"}
{"text":"Been here several times, and continues to disappoint. Service is very slow and disorganized. Pace is slow and got my order all wrong."}
{"text":"Three stars because of service and staff. My husband and I were excited to eat here as our wedding anniversary just passed and we are across the street but walked out after our meal to discover the very place we had our wedding reception (Baltimore,MD location) was right there

Staff greeted us and sat my husband and I in the back behind the bar in a pretty empty restaurant minus happy hour crew.  (Makes me wonder why sit my husband and I directly behind such a loud bar in a pretty empty restaurant)

Our waiter was awesome! We ordered the chef special and crab cakes. Crab cakes are what we really came back for because they were great at our wedding reception. However this location....not so! It was far from the fresh lump meat crab cakes we fell in love with more of an $8.99 traditional dining dish but still $14

Orders three course meal 
Starter soup or salad. My husband enjoyed his soup and I my salad but my salad was a bit mushy? Not do to dressing but maybe my greens were refrigerated or something definitely not crisp but overall good walnut salad

Our entree was great! Beef medallions and shrimp. Everything cooked perfectly! We were on a high. UNTIL dessert came. Claimed to have been molten cake. Small! Couldn't find it due to the mound of melted ice cream and no the molten cake was not piping hot. 

Being active duty stationed in Columbia SC this was the highlight of our trip for my husband and I as the rest will be filled with kid friendly activities 

But great staff and service!! It was raining and we walked from double tree next door and was offered an umbrella to return later"}
{"text":"Didn't like the waiting initially. That is, AFTER taking an appointment!

BUT THEN
Love the grilled fish here! Overall, food was good. 
Great place, lovely ambience."}
{"text":"We went on super bowl Sunday so it was very slow. Our waiter was nice but our apps came out before we even got our drinks from the bar. We were one of 3 tables in the place so that was a little frustrating. We ordered a dozen oysters and some mussels for our apps. Some of the oysters were on the smaller side for blue points and pretty gritty, the muscles were great and the sauce very good and they were served in large portions. For entree's I had the seared scallops they were very good and cooked just right. My husband had the ultimate grill the menu did not mention wether it came with a side or not and the waiter did not know so we ordered 2 large al'a cart sides (each side is enough for 2 people but my husband works out a lot and can eat so no biggie there) anyway the food did come with a side, 2 actually so that really was not necessary. We did have to send my husbands salmon back twice as it was raw in the middle. ( please note : we eat out a lot and don't over cook our food. I also cook salmon at home about twice a week and we are sushi lovers so this was just a matter of the food not being prepared well). The desert was delicious, we had the chocolate box more than enough for 2 and it was great in every way. I had a couple of martinis, my husband 2 glasses of wine and a scotch with desert.
We are not afraid to spend money when we got out or we would eat at Friday's but as we like to eat at quality places and try it all. Our tab was a little over $200, just to give you an idea.. It was mediocre at best we wanted to eat at the up town location but it was closed for super bowl Sunday. I enjoyed it because I always enjoy a date with my husband but would not recommend this location and will probably not re-visit. Hope this helps."}
{"text":"Pros:
Immaculate dining area
Fantastic service
Delicious meals (recommend the surf and turf)

Cons:
Parking
Cost

If you're looking for a restaurant for a special date or just trying to enjoy some top quality dishes, McCormick & Schmick's is for you."}
{"text":"It has been awhile since I was to McCormick & Schmick's and we decided to go here before our show at the Venetian last night.  At 5:30 and the hour and a half we were there, the place was almost empty.  Unusual for a Thursday night.

We just ordered main courses and saved room for dessert.  I ordered the chef's recommended stuffed Atlantic salmon.  This was a nice piece of salmon with some lump crabmeat and bay shrimp in a brie sauce.  It came with some lightly cooked thinly sliced carrots and some green beans.  The dish was very good.  My wife ordered the parmesan crusted chicken which came with lemon caper butter and linguini Alfredo.  This, too, was very good.

For dessert, we shared a molten lava chocolate cake with chocolate and caramel sauces.  It was topped with vanilla bean ice cream.  The dessert was fantastic!  It is similar to the other places that have some kind of molten chocolate dessert.  It seems to be one of the in desserts now.

Service was outstanding.  Our server, Dan, was around often but was not intrusive.  One of the managers also came around during the meal to see how things were. Our iced teas were refilled without asking, Dan was a very pleasant fellow, and we completely enjoyed our meal at McCormick & Schmick's.  We'll be back and sooner this time."}
{"text":"Mediocre, True definition of 2 stars. 

Portions were small. Prices were large. 
The restaurant was empty, except for all 5 full tables seated on top of each other. 

Service was barely tolerable, the waitress argued with one of our party about a cocktail that she had been ordering at another M&S location for years.

They claim \"Best seafood restaurant in Las Vegas.\" - Las Vegas Review Journal  on their website. My recommendation for best seafood in Vegas, Fish Tacos at Rubio's

The food was alright. Although hard to enjoy with management miscues and server gaffes.

There are plenty of restaurants in Vegas I don't mind spending my money in, this isn't one of them."}
{"text":"Brought my mother here last night for her birthday and had a blast! The meal was amazing-make sure to order the lobster bites appetizer. Everything was cooked perfect all in all a great experience for a Friday night. The highlight to our night was our waiter \"Joe\" he was so nice to my 81 year old mother and really made her feel special. Make sure you ask for him when you go. We had never been here before and all of his food recommendations were spot on. We could not have had a more enjoyable night."}
{"text":"For the past several years we have had nothing but the best experiences at this M&S, but today was a real let down.  While our server (Natasha) did her very best she could only apologize so many times for the extremely slow kitchen service (1.5 hours from order to entrees served).  To boot the food quality has also suffered.  I would give it a 3 out of 5 at best.  I hope management solves the problems quickly or the restaurant will suffer a  large loss of customers."}
{"text":"Went here over the weekend for a company party/gathering. We had one of the reserved rooms all to our selves. The service was good, place was clean and food was A+. Can't beat good steaks and fresh seafood. If your having a good day at the tables or at the slot machines, cash out and come on over to this place for a good dinner. Always good to try something other than buffets when in Vegas. Really close to the strip so you'll be back at the tables in no time.


Honorable Mention: Ribeye Steak"}
{"text":"I like McCormick and Schmick's overall and understand it's a chain restaurant with high standards. I have been to their Chicago and Raleigh locations and given rave reviews. This location is different. Upon entering your greeted and seated. They have expectations about the happy hour that other locations don't have. For example,You must purchase a beverage to participate. Hmmm where is that on the site? Why not be consistent with the other locations. I planned on purchasing a drink but the didn't want you to sit at the bar if you weren't. The happy hour food appearance, taste, and texture is not like the rest of the food at this place. It's like they give you scraps.  The food from the general menu doesn't look or taste of quality. Something is off in the kitchen.  The vibe and energy is off. I should of known when I entered the last two times and it was empty during prime times. One being a Saturday afternoon when the mall was packed. The restrooms were clean and the restaurant looked clean with a good layout. However skip happy hour here or food and maybe just drinks."}
{"text":"Having been to a few other McCormick and Schmick's, I thought my husband and I would give this one a try pre-Symphony. Getting a reservation for a snowy, Friday night was easy-peasy and they sat us even though we were 10 minutes late. 

The drinks were fantastic. I had a Lemon Drop, and like the M&S in Kansas City, it was the best Lemon Drop I've had. We also ordered a raw tuna appetizer that was just delicious. Unfortunately, that's almost where the glowing review ends.

I just want to say that the service was very good. Our server was attentive and kept our order rolling to ensure that we were on time for our curtain.

I had the seared scallops with saut√©ed spinach and red pepper white cheddar mash and my husband had the sirloin with broccoli and ordered a side of oven-roasted mushrooms.  The mash in my meal was cold, not ice cold but not even lukewarm and the potato chunks were under cooked. My husband's mushrooms were cold, actually cold and his broccoli crown (whole, not cut up) was literally raw. They hadn't even cut off the end of the stalk that starts to turn brown when it's getting old.

We both chose 1 glass of wine each and the wine-by-the-glass menu is not extensive. Neither of our choices were great. Luckily, the manager comped our wines since most of our food was cold.

For a higher priced restaurant such as McCormick & Schmick's I do not expect and will not accept such poorly prepared food not once, twice, but especially not three times in one meal. We will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"Just walked up about 15 min ago and they were closed. At Cheesecake Factory now. I think they should update the hours since I just walked 17 blocks."}
{"text":"The one star is for the wine because it was the only thing coming from McCormick & Schmick's that was not a complete letdown. The absolute worst dining experience I've ever had. My family and I (about 25 people) had a private room to celebrate my grandmother's 85th birthday. It was a very special occasion; family members flew in just for the weekend, so of course I was expecting nothing but the best from this establishment. The waiters took our drink and appetizer orders and they came out promptly. After taking our food orders, we waited over an hour and a half to get our meals. The food was not hot at all; it was lukewarm at best. Some people's meals that came with mashed potatoes were told the kitchen ran out of mashed potatoes --- when the food came out. And instead of asking what they would like in place of the mashed potatoes, they just put roasted potatoes on the plate and served it. Then I asked the waiter to bring out the cake. He brought the cake out, put the candles in the cake, and set it on the table and walked back in the kitchen without lighting the candles or anything. The manager ended up having to take $300 off of the bill because half of the family did not even eat their food. This was not the level of service or quality of food I was expecting from this restaurant. I was, and still am, deeply disappointed that what was supposed to be a joyous occasion turned out so awful. I will never dine here again and will be calling corporate."}
{"text":"Classy, sophisticated and great ambience.  Great bar and food is also very good.  Ala Americana!"}
{"text":"The fish was overcooked.  The ice cream tasted like it had been in the freezer for a year.  And it was overpriced.  The extra star is for the friendly staff.  The waitress tried to sell us some kind of in-house credit card package to eat at other chains owned by the company.  That's not her fault, but it's annoying.  It's like having to watch an hour of commercials after paying for the movie in the theater.  Commercials everywhere.  Can we just eat without commercials?  This food should not cost any more than your standard Applebee's or TGIFridays, because that's about the quality you're getting.  You cannot mass produce quality, and this place proved it.  Go to a local fine dining establishment with a chef who is not cooking by numbers if you want to spend this kind of money."}
{"text":"In Uptown for a business trip.  A group of us stopped in McCormick & Schmick's looking to get dinner.  We didn't have reservations but they did get us a table after ~ 15 minute wait.  Hostess was very accommodating. 

Place was jammed for the Tuesday night.  Bar section had no seating available.  There was a section between the bar and dining area that appeared to be hosting a private event.  

I would call this semi upscale dining.  Menu mainly consists of seafood options.  Entree prices are in the mid $20s and up.  I got the Beef Medallion Bordelaise with a side of mushrooms and spinach.  $27 entree.  

Drink selection was good, but expensive, especially the cocktails.  The Ancho Chili Margarita was a disappointment.  

The food was good.  I felt the portions were small.  In fact, I left hungry and had to grab a flatbread from my hotel's restaurant.  

I doubt I will come back.  Uptown has too many options that are better.  I seriously doubt they will miss my business though based on the number of customers they had on a Tuesday night."}
{"text":"This was my spot for lunch almost every week day. The bar tender Jill is great and friendly, along with the rest of the staff. I've tried almost everything on their menu and can't say I've ever gone wrong, though their soups can be hit or miss, but I'm not much of a soup person unless I'm sick.

I've never been at night or on the weekends, so I don't know what it's like then, but during the day it can be busy when a convention is going on in town, or chill on an off day. I'd recommend going at 1pm or 2pm as noon can slow you down."}
{"text":"Good food good atmosphere we celebrated my dad's birthday here I enjoyed the complementary fried oyster"}
{"text":"Horrible food. Went Easter Sunday for brunch. Food took an excessive amount of time even though the place was less than 1/2 full. Shrimp and grits- the shrimp was way overdone and wife's eggs Benedict were cold. Told server and they replaced the egg dishes, which came out just as bad. Never saw a manager even after telling the server how poor food was. 100$ meal was worth 4.99$ at Denny's and that's being nice. Too many places to eat that are much better especially at that price point to go to this place."}
{"text":"What a great experience!

We came here last night for date night and I was a little hesitant because of the less than desirable rating on Yelp.

My fianc√© made a reservation, but when we pulled in around 7PM it was pretty empty so if you want to eat earlier like us you probably don't even need to make a reservation.

We were greeted and shown to our table then we were introduced to our waitress, Kristin. She took our drink order and gave us some time to look over the menu. 

The whole time we were there the atmosphere was so warm and romantic it just felt like being there made me completely forget about all the stress and day to day life. It was a nice retreat!

I ordered the Stuffed Salmon and he ordered The Ultimate Mix Grill. Let's just say that neither of us were able to make much conversation after our food came because we were so engrossed in our meals! Everything was perfectly cooked and so delicious!

Of course we had to go with the dessert Kristin recommended, the twice baked apple pie with cinnamon ice cream...

So. Good.

It was an amazing night and Kristin made us feel so welcome and taken care of it really made the night that much better! Looking forward to many more romantic date nights here!"}
{"text":"On November 6th I attended the appreciation luncheon that that they gave for Veterans, their spouses and their parents. I have.been to this restaurant many times and they NEVER FAIL TO PLEASE IN EVERY WAY!! My group was a group of Gold Star Wives and Society of Military Widows. From when we walked in to when we were seated for lunch, we were treated with ultimate respect and kindness! 
The waiter for my table was Joe and he was phenomenal from keeping our glasses filled with water to seeing to it that we wanted for nothing. The food was OUTSTANDING! I had the beef dish on the \"special menu\" and the beef melted in my mouth as did the creamy mashed potatoes. The green beans and the carrots were so flavorful and tasty, cooked just right and I usually HATE green beans but I LOVED these! Everyone in our
Group said the exact same thing about the food and the service.

THANK YOU MCCORMICK AND SCHMICKS FOR MAKING A SAD REMEMBRANCE INTO SOMETHING SPECIAL!!!! By the way the $3.00 Mimosas and Bloody Mary's were great, probably didn't even cover your cost. 
I will always recommend your restaurant as a top notch eatery not to be missed!

I was tying to book for their traditional Veterans Day Meal but sadly they have closed this location . I checked all the other restaurants that serve Veteran Day Meals and they are EXCLUDING ALL FAMILY OF VETS FROM THIS EVENT, DISGRACEFUL WE SPOUSES AND FAMILY, suffer right along with the veteran by making.a home while they are away fighting, suffering untold tragedies that befall all families at one time or another, by keeping the family together in bad times as well as good, by suffering the unimaginable if our veteran should die and even worse, because it is a lifetime  sentence if he should be wounded in such a way  that WE become caregivers , wage earners , and the only dependable  person for that family to rely on and we do this willingly because we love our  vet and our country so very much!! Aren't we just AS IMPORTANT at the end of the day? To show a little Human kindness to the spouses and families of these veterans on that special day would let us know we are appreciated and valued! Thank you for listening, just a wife of a fallen veteran!"}
{"text":"While visiting Charlotte, my friend and I decided to have an early dinner here. We ordered the seafood stuffed mushrooms for our appetizers, and they were delicious! For our main course, my friend and I each had a ribeye steak with lobster mashed potatoes. The steaks were tender and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were great as well. 
We ordered cocktails that weren't as much of a hit as the food. I ordered a margarita. When the server brought my drink, I realized she had not asked and I did not specify whether I wanted salt or sugar on the rim. The drink had salt on the rim and a small amount had fallen into the drink, so the drink was a tad bit salty. I sent it back and asked for no salt or sugar on the rim. The drink was ok. We received great service and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Loved the different oysters that they had here but was disappointed because we had reservations but had to wait for an hour before being seated but their creme br√ªl√©e was great!"}
{"text":"I went here for happy hour yesterday, so this review is specific to their happy hour menu.  I believe the happy hour prices are only good in the bar.  Pretty good selection of food for very cheap.  I was not as impressed with the happy hour drink specials.  I had blackened fish taco.  I was expecting only one, as it was $3.95, but to my surprise there were two!  The tacos were good, if a little too heavily seasoned.  

What kind of made the experience so-so for me were the not so happy drink prices and the server did not seem very happy to wait on our table.  Decent happy hour, but there are probably better spots."}
{"text":"Not good. Out of the 5 meals ordered only 1 was correct and they did nothing to correct the bill. Because the \"corrected\" the order...oh, and the 1 meal that was correct was cold by the time the corrected meals came back 22 mins later."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Perfect for a date night. Stopped here for a quick drink and sat at the bar. Everyone was extremely gracious. The restaurant was fully staffed. Managers are very attentive. The menu looked great. I will definitely be back to try the food."}
{"text":"I ate here the other night for dinner with a dining companion.  I had been here before numerous times for both lunches and happy hours but have never actually been for dinner.  Since I arrived a bit earlier than my dining companion I started out the evening in the bar.  It was during happy hour and so incredibly busy.  If you have never been there before for happy hour it is worth noting that they have one of the better ones around.  When you buy a drink, you can also order a number of different appetizers/bar food for under $6 and including a $4 cheeseburger and $3 hummus.

For dinner my dining companion and I decided to start off our meals by splitting the calamari.  It was cooked perfectly with the breading being crispy and the squid not overly chewy which paired perfectly with both the lemon aioli and spicy marinara.  Even though my companion does not normally eat squid, she and I both quickly polished off this dish.  Next up was a bowl of clam chowder.  The actual size of the bowl was surprisingly large and the creaminess of the soup was sublime.  I especially enjoyed dipping the sourdough bread that was brought out prior to our meal into it to put a touch of tartness with the savory creaminess.  Overall I was really impressed with both of my starters and was enjoying myself.  After our appetizers were finished our entrees came out.  I had ordered the fish and chips which was served with cole slaw, ketchup and a cocktail sauce on the side.  The fish came out at a perfect temperature, hot enough to make it pleasurable but not hot enough to burn your mouth.  Sadly the lack of taste for a beer battered fish was disappointing and I ended up asking the waitress for a malt vinegar.  I preceded to use on not only the fish and but the fries as well which were sans the Chesapeake seasoning (Old Bay) promised by the menu.  The cole slaw also seemed to lack any distinguishing flavor and I ended up leaving it on my plate barely touched.  The whole entree was quite a disappointment after such a promising start to the meal.  For dessert, my dining companion and I decided to split the creme brulee.  It came with the normal caramelized sugar and also a few assorted berries on top.  It wasn't anything spectacular or different than your average creme brulee but I enjoyed it all the same as creme brulee happens to be my favorite dessert.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I was impressed by both the appetizers and dessert here and would be happy if they could only get the taste of the entree up to par."}
{"text":"I came to McCormick & Schmick's after a long day at the convention center, the sign from Flamingo Rd called me in.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OPxWcHK96_cbmiF7legDnA?selected=OJpieVY3pEzo0N6SDKyo7w#iNveMHB89iN7PG4Z_Xgd9Q

Hey it was happy hour too! Monday Night Football. So like a lemming I drove off the Flamingo cliff to M&S.

I asked the waitress to seat me at the bar so I could watch the game, and I quickly struck up a conversation with a couple of Canadians who came in at the same time as me. They mentioned that they had been here the night before and had the surf n turf and it was awesome.

But wait time to get the fade going, margarita rocks no salt and some of the mussels  and an order of the garlic fries off the appetizer menu. 

Think they had to go farm the little black mussels 'cuz they took forever! Meanwhile my drink came, tasty but hardly any booze and loaded with ice. Finally my teasers showed up. I order another Marg,  but this time I tell her easy on the ice heavy on the tequila. 

TEASERS:
Black Mussels ... Tasty li'l critters in a herb wine bath, but 1/3 of them were missing the prize in the middle.  2.5***Stars

I got a stand of lightly seasoned shoe string fries.  I asked for some Tapitio NOPE!  But they did have some Siriacha to give 'em some life.  2**star fries

I ordered my entree and a spinach salad and another marg. 2nd marg was better but told her to double the tequila , 1/2 the ice this time. 

SALAD:
Wild Mushroom Spinach Saute ... this was the best thing I had here. The shrooms and spinach were cooked with a sesame oil and were great. 4**** Stars

The steak looked good but was chewy and lacked any beef flavor. The Lob tail was overcooked and rubbery but had a little smack off the grill and dredged in butter was palatable.

The staff was friendly, the place had a nice interior and a sweet bar. The service was hit and miss. 3***Stars

M&S was a bust for me, an overpriced meal lacking flavor.

I will not return here as there are too many other great places to eat within walking distance."}
{"text":"Do not go for restaurant week.  I got food poisoning from either the seafood chowder or else the crab cakes (\"special\" crab cakes for restaurant week only).  

A good rule of thumb, don't ever trust a restaurant's \"special menu\" for restaurant week.  Chances are it's a menu that's high on profit and low on quality/value.  

I went one other time on a business dinner and recall only the oysters being so-so.  My entree (whatever it was) was nothing to write home about.

If you want good, FRESH seafood I would choose Upstream over McCormick any day."}
{"text":"I am giving a two because , as they should , they removed the dinner from my bill.

I had oysters to start. They were very good .

Dinner was swordfish, mashed potato and Swiss chard. The fish was dry and hard and kind of grey looking. Potato and veggie was good. The manager came at my request and offered to have another swordfish grilled. I questioned whether he thought it would be any better because I felt the quality of the first one was poor. He thought it would be better. It wasn't. Basically they tried to undercook a bad piece of fish to make it juicy.

So my rating for everything is a 1 bumped up to a 2 for removing the cost of the dinner. I would have given a three if they had realized they had bad swordfish steaks and suggested a fish they knew would be of high quality .

I left hungry."}
{"text":"Aww, one of my favorite places to eat dinner. I'm a seafood lover so McCormick's always has new options on menu. This is one of my birthday festivities so me some friends had dinner uptown. I started out with a apple martini and  some crab dip for an appetizer of-course. My entr√©e I had scallops which were delicious with some mashed potatoes and asparagus. My waiter this time around wasn't as good or attentive but I will return because I love this place."}
{"text":"Above average for M & S. chain,good seafood,but pricey. Other PGH restaurants that serve good seafood at the same price range that are not chains, so visit them instead."}
{"text":"Our supplier invited some of their loyal clients for dinner last night. They hosted a open bar for the entire evening and there were choices from a fixed menu we selected from. 

The friendly waitress was very helpful and suggested the fresh grilled Swordfish vs the farm raised Salmon (wonder if they used artificial coloring?). For starters we started with cheese bread and green salad. The main entree included mashed potatoes and sauteed string beans. 
For dessert I ordered the Chocolate Torte which went great with the Cabernet. 

All the food was excellent quality and service top notch considering there were thirty of us. I've eaten here before and would definitely return."}
{"text":"People who know me know me as, putting it nicely, a thrifty individual.  I have a limit to what I am usually comfortable paying for a meal.  Places like Red Lobster are on the upper end of the scale for me.  With that said, it should come as no surprise that I avoided McCormick & Schmick's for a while.  I knew it to be a high end seafood restaurant and so I shyed away.  That is until a couple of years ago when they offered a tax day specical.  I don't remember the exact price of their special menu items but it was within reason.  I went in, sat in the bar area where there was some room left.  I ordered pasta with alfredo sauce and shrimp and baby scallops.  It was very good.  I have never been a fan of scallops but these were done right.  Not at all fishy.  Not the least bit chewy.  Just sweet and numerous.  I really rather enjoyed myself.  Much to my surprise, when I left I received a coupon for a certain percentage off my next order.  I'm sorry I don't remember specifically.  It was a while ago afterall.  Any how, I did go back a few months after my April 15th initial visit.  This next time I was seated in the actual dining room.  I ordered shrimp scampi.  While I prefer the scampi at Red Lobster this was still very good.  I ate every bit and sopped up the remaining sauce with my bread.  I stuffed myself and had a pleasent experience.  The service was great.  Very friendly staff.  Good food.  A beautiful interior.  I would love to go back perhaps for some special occasion.  However, unfortunately for me, I am not really a fan of most seafood.  Mostly just crab legs and shrimp which I seem to be developing an allergy to (this is where you imagine me hanging my head in shame and self pitty).  I may still go back if I ever have company who wants a good dinner at a place other than the larger chain places.  Perhaps I would order sword fish or mahi mahi if either were on the menu.  Those are two that I will eat.  So maybe some day."}
{"text":"My work team had a belated holiday lunch yesterday at McCormick and Schmick's. Though I work in South Side Works, I haven't eaten here in over a year so I was happy to come back and get a fresh perspective of the restaurant, especially since my previous opinion was pretty indifferent. 

The customer service was good. A table for 10 was set up in a nice section of the restaurant before we arrived. We were promptly seated and had an efficient waitress. All went smoothly with service except confusion over who received which entree. Three co-workers ordered the same meal but with different substitutions, and each person received the wrong entree which resulted in some confusion and awkwardly passing plates of food around the table to correct the issue. 

I ordered the Ham & Brie sandwich with Blue Cheese and Apricot preserves and a side of Sweet Potato fries. The fries were very tasty - though is it possible to make Sweet Potato fries not tasty? - but I was disappointed in my sandwich. The bread had been toasted/grilled unevenly. One side was brown and crispy while the other side was mushy and buttery.  The sandwich was loaded with ham but only had a small slice of Brie. The blue cheese was nonexistent, and I could only taste the apricot preserves in a couple bites. 

I have a couple co-workers who are obsessed with the scallops and crab cakes here at McCormick... But as a restaurant option near many corporate offices, they should offer a great lunch. However, though they try to be creative, I would still rather get a sandwich or salad at Panera than pay 50% more here."}
{"text":"Delish! Lucked up on a gift card and decided to try!!! It had been quite awhile since I dined here. We started with the shrimp kisses, shrimp and cheese wrapped with bacon on a bed of fresh   corn, topped with fried onions, the flavors were amazing together! I had the salmon saut√© with mashed potatoes and green beans, at sight I wasn't too sure but the salmon in the lemon sauce  was just right and the mashed potatoes were creamy.  This will definitely be added as a go to spot!"}
{"text":"I had dinner with my teenage kids.  The restaurant is not busy at around 6:30 on a weekday. The service was just ok.
The food is good.  Although my salmon is a tad overcooked.  The crab cake saved my meal.  The crab cake has very little fillers, it 90% lump crab.  I love that in a crab cake.
I had the creme brulee for desert and it's mediocre.
The price is on the expensive side."}
{"text":"Been to quite a few of their stores but left here disappointed. Service was very slow and the food not prepared properly."}
{"text":"This review is for their bar/happy hour only. I came here recently with a friend for their happy hour, as they have really cheap food and drink specials (and ordinarily it's rather expensive to eat here). We got there shortly after 4:30 (when happy hour begins) and snagged one of the last tables....it quickly became standing-room only shortly thereafter. There was only one or maybe two servers taking care of the entire bar area, which was unfortunate given how crowded it was. Our poor waitress was very nice and apologetic, but it was just impossible for her to provide good service given how many tables she had to deal with. So the service was pretty abysmal...it took us a good 20 minutes to get our drinks. When she finally came back with our drinks, we ordered food from their happy hour menu...a burger for my friend and hummus and a chicken quesadilla for me. After about 20 minutes after placing our order, our waitress came back and said they didn't have hummus (bummer, but okay). Then...no exaggeration...we waited another HOUR for our food. We weren't in a hurry and had planned on staying awhile, so in the grand scheme of things, this wasn't a big deal. But I have no idea why it took an hour and 20 minutes to get our food. And when we did get our food? It was pretty terrible. I am usually a more forgiving critic when it comes to happy hour eats (I mean, I'm getting an appetizer for $5, so I try not to be too picky!), but this food was just not good at all. My quesadilla was cold, so the cheese was congealed on the inside. It was supposed to be a chicken quesadilla, but the meat was sparse and tasted cheap and low-quality. It came with a pico that was strangely dry. Also very strangely, the sour cream drizzled on top of the quesadilla was dry (I didn't even think that was possible....how can sour cream taste dry? But somehow it did). Honestly, it was probably the worst quesadilla I've ever eaten. My friend's burger meal wasn't any better...it was sloppily plated, cooked to a burnt texture, and her fries were cold. We both ended up giving up on our food after a few bites.

I know that M&S has a reputation for being a high-end restaurant, so I'm not sure why they would serve such cheap, low-quality food during their happy hour. Either way, between the poor service and the disappointing food, I don't think I'll be back here for happy hour any time soon."}
{"text":"Being one of Top 10 best restaurants in Vegas is reason we picked this restaurant for our 1st Anniversary Dinner location. Unfortunately we had a bad experience and will not be returning. Husband made our reservation for a specific time and we were greeted with \"your reservation was cancelled!\" The hostess' statement caused my husbands blood pressure to go up and pissed me off too since the reservation was made days before. First impressions is everything especially at a high end restaurant as this, so I thought. Another thing... For the price, I expected higher quality and quantity of food compared to the local bar we eat often at. Portions are small, not all that tasty, and the fish and chips was over cooked. The only positive from this was the waitress. She was excellent! She was very helpful with all our needs, courteous, pleasurable, polite, and very professional in her job. If it wasn't for this great waitress, I'd have put a no star review. Very disappointed in this long awaited experience."}
{"text":"This solid fish n' chops restaurant in the heart of Uptown is a great spot for a business lunch, a romantic dinner, or just about any other occasion. I really enjoyed their Parmesan Crusted Flounder on a recent visit, and their Salmon Rigatoni is also excellent. Service has always been friendly and efficient, and the wine and beer selections extensive. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"My man took me here for my birthday. I've never felt more like a VIP! The food was amazing (shrimp kisses and mahimahi). My only complaint was the drink I ordered.. had to send it back... Not sure what the bartender was thinking with that one."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  We've had 3 different bartenders at lunch and all of them are horrible.  All of them greeted us and walked away without giving menus or wine lists.   Food is mediocre and WAY overpriced.  They don't pay attention to their customers and I'm sure it's a company policy but I don't like them to shake my hand.   I have to wash my hands if you've touched everyone's hand and their dirty glasses.  We will not be back. Such a shame."}
{"text":"Perfect experience, excellent appetizers, both fish and meat entrees, and luscious desserts.  Also one of the few places you can get fried oysters.  Wonderful service, I had to leave a huge tip"}
{"text":"McCormick & Schmick's is an adequate chain restaurant that clearly is a carbon copy of others located around the country.  The food is decent, but formulaic.  If you can get the wait staff to break from the script, they are usually quite friendly and eager to please.  As with many large \"upscale\" chain restaurants, butter seems to be the ingredient that is frequently overdone.  McCormick & Schmick's is no different.  They offer a 50% discount on lunches to employees of the South Side Works, and if I didn't benefit from that, I would never pay their normal prices for the food you get."}
{"text":"From Los Angelos to San Diego. Denver, CO to Charlotte. West Coast to East Coast and the other Coast, the Gulf Coast. McCormick never fails. If you like fish? McCormick's is a chain but it's consistent. Awesome happy hour food menu. Great oyster selection. If you are looking for a ROY's experience. This is not the restaurant. Conservative fish house and very classy. Traditional seafood dishes. McCormick has a history of find seafood dining. FREE VALET!"}
{"text":"I typically do not like chain restaurants but the service here is always amazing. I haven't had dinner at this specific location. I usually go Tuesday nights when they have $1 fish tacos that are amazing!They have amazing happy hour specials and during the summer the patio is great!"}
{"text":"WORST Service.  EVER.  Went in tonight for dinner with my family (Monday night).  There was our table and 3 other tables sat.  We had reservations for 6:00 and didn't leave until 8:30.  The service was unbelievably slow when there was barely anyone there.  Food was okay but I'd never go back based on this horrible service we had tonight."}
{"text":"Went for my husband's birthday dinner. First time there. When it's your birthday and they know ahead of time , they will print a menu wishing you a happy birthday that you can take home. Started with the calamari- it was excellent. Not rubbery, they were fresh and not over breaded. Main course was scallops and shrimp scampi. Both were excellent, only comment is could have used a little more garlic. Our daughter called earlier in the week and spoke with the general manager. He greeted us and was very nice. Since our daughter arranged this with him he comped the appetizer and dessert!! Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I overcame my corporate prejudice to meet with friends over the holidays, and I have to say, not too shabby. 
We were shopping (i.e. broke), so we came for happy hour's $1.95 menu. I wasn't expecting much from a two-dollar fish taco, but they give it up: it's about 6 inches, weighty with tilapia and a nice slaw, and a delicious tangy dressing.
My homegirl got potato thingies (sorry), which were really good, and our group got the hummus too. 
Of course all this cheap goodness came with a drink minimum, but ahem, that wasn't going to be a problem, and I was impressed with the mojitos. If you're gonna support the corporate beast, you could do worse than a drink, a couple treats and a $10 tab."}
{"text":"The food was very dry and not flavorful. I got the beef medallions with a lobster tail. The lobster tail was the smallest tail I have ever eaten. The beef had no flavor. The plate overall was very small. But the service was very good."}
{"text":"Empty on a friday night? I should have let that be a sign.

Mc & Schmick is like an old flame for me. I stopped eating there after the Landry's takeover (as you can read about in my review for the Mc & Schmick in Vegas). But, I thought of days gone by, and gave it another go. 

I ordered the sea scallops, and they looked sickly to say the least. Not even a hint of sear or color showed. The food obviously sat, too. My butter sauce was already solidifying on the plate when it was delivered. I took a photo as a reminder of why Mc & Schmick broke up. 

My dad enjoyed his meal. So, I am at least happy for that. 

My office is next door, but don't expect to see me there again. This old flame is finally snuffed!"}
{"text":"McCormick & Schmick was my favorite restaurant before Landry's made their many changes. I attended happy hour quite often [enough that it was an open invitation to my friends at work].  I ate here every birthday, Christmas,  valentine's day, and special occasion in the past 5 years. 

Then... the big takeover.  The change was immediate.  They no longer made drinks with the freshly muddled syrups. They changed the quality of their food.  They increased prices. They have lowered the quality of their food and their business.  The overall tone is completely different. Solemn, perhaps? 

I had over 50 $ in gift cards. I gave them away.  I was emailed to remind me to change my Mc & Schmick loyalty card to a Landry's card. I didn't think it was worth the time. 

Thanks for the memories during those 5 years. And now on to better quality seafood & drinks!"}

Laid back too"}
{"text":"usually not a big fan of this chain. Reston, Virginia, location is beat down. DC location is the pits. This location had great service, and the salmon was just how I like it. great meal, but thankfully work expense account as if I dropped $40 of my own $ it would have been too much money for what you get. However, if you want consistent, predictable good food, this location delivers."}
{"text":"They hubby and I come here for dinner often and the food is always so delectable.  We often make reservations via OpenTable as some of the times are 1000 point tables! We're always greeted warmly and the waitstaff is always attentive and pleasant.  Sidney or Sydney- I'm not sure how she spells it, is such a great waitress and accommodating with suggestions for dinner or dessert and she's been correct each time.  

They have a variety of seafood dishes (the crab stuffed shrimp are my fave) from fish, shellfish, to pasta and mouth-watering steaks (the hubby often opts for the ribeye).  During the last visit, the hubby had the crab & shrimp stuffed Salmon and I had the Filet Mignon w/crab stuffed shrimp.  I was born and raised by the beach and the seafood tastes pretty fresh and the steaks are always cooked to perfection.  This place will continue to be our go-to restaurant for date night."}
{"text":"McCormick and Schmick's has a reputation as one of the best seafood restaurants in Charlotte (personally, I'd have to go with Upstream, but it's a pretty close call). The name is obviously great, too. 

This is a pretty fancy place, so I'd suggest it for meaningful dates or, more likely, for business meetings/dinners/parties. The space in there is huge, so it can take care of pretty much any sort of function. Great atmosphere, great service--pretty much the experience you'd expect from a fancy steakhouse, if that makes sense. 

All the fish is great, but a few items really stand out to me: the salmon caesar salad is amazing if you're looking for something on the lighter side (and for lunch), the macaroni and cheese (you can add lobster) is unreal, and the shrimp n' grits is pretty darn amazing too. I'll definitely go back, If you're trying to figure out a place to dine, go no further."}
{"text":"Food was good, but they throw away their menus every time the chef changes the special. The employee told me that they trash the menus every other day and print out thousands of new menus. He also notify me that they don't recycle the menus. For that reason, that was the last time I have eaten there."}

This is one of the best high end happy hours I have been to in Las Vegas, and that is saying something. $5 burger, are you kidding me? No, I am not kidding, it is a deal not to be beat! Worth a stop in if you are in the area, hell with all the other restaurants in the area why not make a mini pub crawl out of it! Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed every minute of being there. Good selection of menu choices. Very knowledgeable waiter. Will go again next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"Went here to celebrate our wedding with another couple who recently got married so we were looking for a nice dinner. Overall was not very impressed. 
The food was decent but nothing special. The calamari was very tasty but my Caesar salad with shrimp was very bland. My husband although did enjoy his steak but was upset with the portion size of the 9$ mushroom side. 
The drinks were standard. 10$ for a mixed drink and more pricey for specialty cocktails. 
The best part of the whole meal was the service. Our server was fantastic! He was very attentive and talkative. He really made the experience much more enjoyable! 
Unfortunately, I probably won't be back here any time soon. I feel like there are much better steak houses in the area that are worth the money."}
{"text":"I was in the mood to go out and enjoy a nice meal with my wife. I chose a place that we have not been to before but have passed by quite often.  This is Mcormick & Schmicks located at the back entrance to South Park Mall.

My wife is not a big seafood lover as myself, but who who could pass up a nice center cut filet as shown in the photos and described on their website.  For starters, we should have passed.

I started by reading the yelp reviews, as I value other fellow Yelper's opinions.  It was lacking in the latest reviews for this location, so I had to step up and bring everyone the latest review after our dining experience for better or for worse.

I started by setting up the reservations online through yelp, using the open table reservation provided.  Our reservations were for 7:30 for a party of two for a Saturday evening.  We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation time and was seated promptly by the staff.

We were seated on the right side of the restaurant in a booth which had a view of the patio. When it began to rain that evening on some of the patrons on the patio, we had some entertainment watching them scramble to get underneath the umbrellas. Cruel I know, but I had a less than desirable experience.

My wife had the Filet House Center Cut Filet Mignon (6oz) 29.95 (cooked medium) with mashed potatoes and a sweet tea. I had the Wild Caught Stuffed Salmon (a daily special not listed on the main menu) a glass of water and a glass of wine.

The bread was cold, the butter was very difficult to spread on the bread as it was hard and unable to be applied properly with a knife.  The server initially forgot my glass of wine, and it was at this point my expectations were being crushed!

The food finally made it out and at first appeared to be correct.  The steak however was more like well done with the smallest sliver of pink.  The edge was crusty and had a very tough texture and had the residue of a dirty grill .  My thoughts are that it was overcooked, but for only a 6oz portion, it was just a few bites. The center was edible, but she left 3 bites for server and notified the staff of the steak.  The mashed potatoes were warm, and was the highlight of her meal.

My Stuffed Salmon was very delicate, warm, and tasty. I was content with my meal, but not a great value for the special.

Upon the completion of the meal, the plates were removed, and we chose to forgo any surprises for desert and opted for the check.  It was at this time that we were presented the check and noticed that we were not charged for the sweet tea.  The server informed us that based on the amount of steak which was left on the plate, it was equal to the value of the sweet tea. ( REALLY! -  Are you F*&^* kidding me!)

So 3 bites of a 6 oz steak = a glass of tea.   Elizabeth C. says that $3.85 is a lot for a tea....... hehe.  My steak must have been priced wrong then.

Please I am not impressed with the this location and the name should be changed to McCormick & Schmucks!

Truthfully and Sincerely,
NCFoodGuy"}
{"text":"This place was a joke for the price of my family's meal and the quality of the food that we received was not worth the price. Now I'll state that my family has gone to McCormick and Schmick's before in Oregon and gotten good meals but this Las Vegas location has been a disappointment. First, I got their apparently amazing special that the waiter told me to get. I chose the steak medallion with a wine sauce, cooked spinach, and \"pan roasted mushrooms.\" The mushrooms were the reason why I got this meal, mushrooms, steak  it just goes together. Besides if I got the other meal it would have cost me an extra 5 dollars to get mushrooms added. You do not get to choose your sides. Not that the sides were much to choose from. When I got my meal I did not know whether it was a joke or if it was truly my meal. It was my meal i only got 4 small medallions which looked like my meal had been sitting out and the spinach was horrible tasting not to mention I only got 3 mushrooms. Their was hardly any sauce on the plate. My parents meals were fish which they described as dry and tasteless not to mention small portions. Not worth the $25 a plate. I'm just so so so disappointed. Don't go to this place the price is not worth it. I could bet a better steak at apple bees."}
{"text":"This place was just ok.  I ordered the swordfish casino and I thought it was a bit over cooked.  Also, the side of spinach was inedibly salty.  I'm a salt person and like aggressive salting, but it was like someone just dumped a fistful in the spinach that night.  Service was very good."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal tonight. Ate at the bar and shared a meal with my husband. Food was fabulous and drinks were great. Service was great. Felt right at home. Thanks!9"}
{"text":"Went here for a group dinner. They have a happy hour menu on the patio and in the bar. The happy hour menu has very attractive prices. The set of drink on the happy hour menu is limited. The regular menu has a great selection of seafood and meats. The seafood dishes are great. We had a mixture of happy hour and regular dishes. The food is ok but not fantastic. The service was unattentive and slow. This was a slow Monday night, so I was surprised that service was so slow. There are numerous dining choices nearby there is no need to settle for un-attentive service and medium quality food."}
{"text":"McCormick has a nice happy hour 5-7pm, every day, including weekends. Since weekend happy hour is rare, and the drinks here are both strong and significantly discounted, 5 stars! Furthermore, the food is good too, like the mussels, edemame, and my personal favorite fish tacos. These happy hour fish tacos are comparable to elbow room's happy hour fish tacos."}
{"text":"Let me just say they offer really great, FREE meals to veterans and military for Memorial and Veteran's Day, which is 5 stars in my book.  The execution was a little lacking (tables were dirty, staff was scattered and confused, some things took a while to come out) but overall, the food quality was very good.  I'm not sure we would frequent this location for full meals but I would definitely consider happy hour for their coconut shrimp!  And again, they are definitely one of the best restaurants to support the military.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Come to McCormick's for happy hour, which is one of the best in the area for happy hour specials. Prices did go up, which was disappointing. Drink specials could be a little cheaper/variety. 

I always get the burger for $5 (used to be $4) 
It's always good. Simple and tasty, great for $5. Comes with fries too. 

The other food on the happy hour bar menu is alright, nothing to rave about except cheaper prices. 

I always stick to happy hour here and go elsewhere for dinner. 

Oh- no more valet parking"}
{"text":"Came here over the weekend with mixed perspectives from various people. We still decided to give it a try while we were in town because my boyfriend's parents had heard the lobster bisque was great. We all ordered drinks which took forever to come out. (the bread came out and we were all on our second piece of bread when they finally brought the drinks). The waitress said \"these are all handcrafted and the bartender apologizes for taking so long.\" Carry on.. we placed our order. The lobster bisque was o-kay. I've had way better. It was very thick and greasy....It would be nice if the menu stated what the dishes come with (ie.. the steak and shrimp comes with... broccolini and potatoes) Our waitress seemed annoyed having to explain every dish comes with ____ which sounds petty for me to complain but it makes a difference in choosing whether to order sides or not. So the food came out without the broccolini and without someone else's side. The waitress apologized and said \"the chef apologizes\".. the portions of the food were small.. Seriously, the steak was in 5 little slices, the lobster was cold, the potatoes were cold and hard. I had ordered the shrimp scampi plate and the pasta could use more garlic, the shrimp was completely unseasoned. I also got a side of grilled asparagus which also was unseasoned. For dessert, we ordered 2  for creme brulee, only 1 came out. The kitchen had ran out of creme brulee (it wasnt even busy that night!!), so we got a complimentary choc mousse cheesecake and another apology from the kitchen. This place is not worth the amount of $$ we spent for dinner. It's a \"higher end\" seafood/steakhouse, but the quality is very chain restaurant-ish."}
{"text":"I will NEVER eat there again as long as their tyrant general manager Todd is in charge. His treatment of the servers was hard to watch. He is a bully and he frankly turned my stomach. I am going to write a well worded letter to the corporate, no one deserves that kind of treatment."}
{"text":"I had never paid so much money for such a horrible dinner experience before this place. As a group of 8, we went there for a graduation celebration. We waited 85 minutes for our entrees. When they arrived, my medium rare requested steak came out -close to burnt- well done, my in-law's fish entree was delayed for 10 extra minutes, my dad's medium-well requested medallions came out as rare, and my husband's fish was missing seasoning. We were told there was a mix up in the kitchen, so manager came over and apologized, and we were offered 3 pieces of complimentary dessert so I appreciate that they tried, however we still paid for everything."}
{"text":"The fish n ships is only average. Too much batter covers mystery fish whose quality only matches a neighborhood bargain seafood joint. 

I recommend avoiding the battered fried fare and enyoying the grilled or blackened choices.
I liked the grilled swordfish. It tasted fresh and not \"fishy.\"

Our server at lunchtime was attentive. 


The water glasses were full of water spots. My water at home in Arizona is also high in calcium, so I use in the dishwasher   an anti-spot product that is readily available in stores.

This place is supposed to served great fish so I was disappointed"}
{"text":"Normally you wouldn't find me in a place like this but I was uptown for an festival and stopped into the bar to beat the heat and have a decent beer since all the festival had was Bud products.

The bar staff was great....friendly and accommodating to the people who were a bit under dressed for this type of place. The beer tap list is quite decent for being a chain restaurant with several local craft beer options including OMB and NoDa.  

The bartenders explained this new bar appetizer menu that really had several tantalizing options. My friend ordered the buffalo shrimp which came with several shrimp, celery and carrot sticks and a scoop of coleslaw.  The shrimp was great and had a good kick to the sauce. The coleslaw was herby and quite tasty.

So maybe I'll be back sometime to try their other options but for a first time experience, I wish I could give this 3.75 stars. I think they are well above average but based on this experience alone, not quite worth the 4th star."}
{"text":"I've been a Landry's restaurant fan for 10+ years, at the end of our dining experience I found this location is no longer a Landry's property possibly this is the reason for the downward swing in food quality. This visit was a celebration for my mother who LOVES seafood, we shared a few appetizers and dinners. 

We sat at the bar and had wonderful service by Tim & Tom, the bartenders were spectacular and the food was below average. 

Our seared tuna appetizer had an excessively fishy flavor and was retuned to the kitchen, the jumbo lump crab tower was gray crab which had an aged flavor my wife's crab legs were very hard to crack and peel as they appeared freezer burned. The fried shrimp were perfect & the easiest preparation item.  

We Will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"A combination of, \"this is pretty good\" and \"this is not so great\" paired with slow service and a confusion on where to park leads to this 3-star rating based on happy hour.

McCormick & Schmick's really pushes its happy hour. It is even plastered on its large sign attracting people off of Flamingo, the busiest street next to the restaurant. Also, M&S is situated in the Howard Hughes business park, so, a good idea to attract all those suits and ties would certainly be a slammin' happy hour.

Was it slammin'? Not really. Was it good? Sure. Spectacular? Nah.

Happy Hour is in the bar area only. My friend and I arrived on a Tuesday night, about 5:30 PM.

Ordered:

Spinach dip - came out piping hot, but the pita chips were so, so very sad. I felt so bad for these pita chips. They were so small, they were so dry, they were so boring. I am fairly certain they came out of a bag. The spinach dip was good, but the pita chips were so small, my friend and I had eaten them all and still had spinach dip leftover. I used the spinach dip leftovers to slather my Baja Fish Tacos.

Baja Fish Tacos - My friend and both got these. Plus - nice, big servings! The fish was decent and crunchy, not mushy, but I got the feeling these too may have come out of a pre-packaged bag. Hrmmm. Just not good considering this place should be an upscale steakhouse/seafood place. Slaw inside was tasty and it was served with a green, spicy, creamy sauce. Adding my leftover spinach dip made it a very filling happy hour plate.

Fries - Meh. Came out kind of mooshy, definitely not a good option. Obviously these too came out of bag. No way these were fresh cut fries *thumbs down*

Wine - $6 a glass. Ya, okay. Not much to say.

Overall - Only OKAY. I had higher expectations. I doubt I will come here to spend big bucks on a dinner. I'll go somewhere else that is not owned by the chain Landry's."}
{"text":"Went in last night after the raiders tough loss.   Great food and pretty good service.   I would give 5 stars but the server says they are brewing more ice tee.  5 minutes later comes back and says sorry we are out of ice tee.  No your too lazy to make more !  It was closing time .  And we were probably the last table.  But not my problem my bill was not discounted for be the last table.  The apple pie desert was amazing"}
{"text":"My 1st time ever eating at McKormics and it was amazing.  Sean was our server and he was so nice.  We ordered his recommendations and  they were all very tasty.  I forget what it's called but get the bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer it was off the hook.  Im a Mortons / Ruth's Chris kinda person but this was just s good and a little cheaper.   We will be back.  Thanks Sean"}
{"text":"Food was dynamite, as always....service...eh!
They apologized that it was busy. Hmmmmmm

Don't think they had their best staff available. Oops! Its Christmas week in Downtown Pittsburgh....Duh!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting Pittsburgh for the first time and had a 7: 15 reservation  for 7 Saturday night.  From the moment we walked it I knew it was going to be a bad experience.  One inexperienced bartended could not keep up with the pace.  
We sat in a back room...almost as an afterthought. Other diners had managers coming to their table to resolve issues.
Our food was mediocre.  Our son's cheeseburger was charred black (removed from bill). Not a good experience at all.  Due to the long wait we missed out opportunity at the Planetarium.

Will not return.  Too many other choices to consider for our next visit."}
{"text":"I went to McCormick & Schmick's a while back when I saw them listed as a restaurant week option. I started with the soup which was good but it was just an average cup of soup. Nothing that blew me away. My boyfriend ended up getting the fried calamari and I was pleasantly surprised. It was a very large starter and it wasn't your traditional fried calamari. It had a variety of different things mixed in with the calamari. Obviously they were all fried so I wasn't able to make out what they all were but it was good none the less. I also really enjoyed that it was served with more of a sweet sauce. It wasn't served with marinara.

Entree wise both of us decided to go with the stuffed salmon. It looked really good on the menu and the waitress said it was her favorite dish but I sadly wasn't impressed. In my personal opinion I just didn't enjoy the Brie flavor mixed with the salmon. I love both separately but I wasn't loving them paired together. The mashed potatoes and green beans in the side were delicious however!

For our deserts we picked 1 cheesecake and 1 silk cake. As soon as I saw the \"silk\" cake coming out I thought things didn't look right with the cake. The waitress proceeded to set the plate down and the cake completely toppled over and the waitress thought nothing of it. I'm not sure what exactly we were served but it wasn't edible. You could barely get your spoon/fork to break a piece off. It was as if the cake had been frozen and then served as is. It was really disappointing and pretty shocking that no one else noticed anything wrong with it. We even took it home hoping it would thaw out but 48 hours later it was still hard as a rock."}
{"text":"After a lot of drinking in the earlier part of the night, I was craving some seafood (King Crab legs to be exact).  So I left the hotel and started walking.  

It was about 10:15 on a Friday night, so I knew my choices (that I knew of) were limited...  

I saw about a block down a large sign that said \"Steaks and Seafood\".  I had heard of this place in ATL, and I quickly checked my Yelp app to make sure it was still open.  I had until 11PM.  I wanted something good to eat in my last night in Charlotte...

I know they probably thought I was an asshole for coming in drunk and late, but I promise, I made it worth their while :) . 

Got seated immediately (told em to put me wherever was easiest, so I sat in the bar area- and I got to watch the Braves finish off their game :) ).  The decor was nice, but not what I expected!  It had tiled flooring, dark woods, and dim lights.  The place was nice, I just was expecting wood floors throughout (what the hell am I saying, I sat at the damn bar area).  Just ignore this paragraph.

I think my server was Sara(h), and she was very nice.  The one thing I noticed after scouring the menu- they DIDN'T have crab legs :(.  However, they had crab cakes.  So I got one for an \"app\".  I was so hungry, I ended up getting a 14oz strip and a lobster tail.  I also got some more beer.

The crab cake was moist, and I really enjoyed the iwouldliketocallitchutney that accompanied it.  That thing was gone in a matter of 2 bites.

Thankfully, the steak and lobster tail came out quickly after (which was surprising hence the size of the cut).  It came with some humungo asparagus too.  Unfortunately the damn pic I took of it was too blurry, so it didn't make the cut.  The steak itself wasn't bad (hell I ate the whole thing)- and was trimmed perfectly, but I wished it had a wee more seasoning.  The asparagus were alright, but they filled me up.  But I tell you what- that damn lobster tail was probably the best thing I had there- it almost completely made up for the fact they didn't have crab legs.

Thankfully, I didn't wear out my welcome, and they were cool with me ordering dessert- so I got the apple crisp thing.  It was damn good, but I wish it had some more ice cream (hell, I was buzzin and had a sweet tooth!).  

This great experience only lasted 40 minutes (I got outta there right before the doors shut!)- which was awesome- usually a meal like this would last at least twice as long!  My total was around $96 (for 2 tall boys, app, surf n turf, and dessert) and let them know how much I appreciated them taking me in.

I will definitely have to come back here if I get the chance to- maybe they can procure some King Crab for me next time :)
Cheers!"}
{"text":"McCormick and Schmick's in the Howard Hughes Center isn't the kind of place you'd normally associate with frugality, but their happy hour menu is priced for the seafood lover on a budget. At their bar from 3:30-6:30 and 9:30-11 Monday through Friday you can feast on an assortment of finger foods ranging from $1.95 to $4.95, as long as you meet their $3.50 minimum beverage purchase per person. A half pound cheeseburger is just $2.95, but if you are coming here you should probably try some of their underwater offerings. We started with Blackened Fish Tacos ($3.95) which were perfectly adequate for the price, but unfortunately not blackened as advertised. There wasn't a ton of fish either, but that is to be expected. On the other hand the calamari tentacles with sherry aioli, or Spider Fries ($3.95),  were one of the better values on the menu and were surprisingly tender and plump. We also ordered one of the two healthy items on the menu, the Grilled Artichoke with sundried tomato aioli ($4.95). The presentation was appealing, but unfortunately it didn't taste as good as it looked. It was a bit bland and under seasoned, but at least it was green and wasn't deep fried. Other offerings include Beer Battered Mushrooms ($1.95), Fried Cod Sliders ($3.95), and Chefs Choice Oysters (three for $4.95). The menu changes regularly, but at any give time there are around fifteen options. On Wednesdays you can get $1.00 oysters and a mini Shrimp Boil for $3.95, so I'd like to come back to take advantage of that.

The drink specials are pretty good, too, depending on the day. We went on Hoppy Thursdays, when domestic light beer on draft is available for $2.95 (only a real bargain if you're comparing it to the Strip), but I would recommend going on Tuesday Tini night when all martinis are only $5. On Sundays you can try their adorable martini flights from 5:00-10:00, but unfortunately you won't get to try any of their food at a discount.

There are a lot of happy hours around town, but McCormick and Schmick's is definitely one of the better ones. The bar is more sophisticated and intimate than most, and there is also an outdoor patio in case the weather is ever forgiving enough during the happy hour time of day. Basically, you won't leave hungry or broke, and you won't have to sit in a fast food restaurant to accomplish that feat."}
{"text":"Decent food, but their service is incredibly bad and slow. I had to walk out because I was waiting over an hour to get food. I had to ask my waiter 4x in the last 15 mins for a coffee. I wouldn't go here ever again"}
{"text":"So I was told my order would be ready in 20 mins. I arrive 20 mins later and waiting 20 minutes for the order.  What's wrong with that picture.  The lady seems to be aggravated by my togo order but they did charge me a togo fee...  This is ridiculous..."}
{"text":"I had eaten at a McCormick and Schmick's in Boston and was delighted to find one on a recent trip to Charlotte.In Boston, we enjoyed the al fresco dining seeing all the foot traffic and sites in downtown Boston.
In Charlotte, although there is an outdoor terrace for dining, we opted to eat inside. The interior was elegant and so relaxing after a day of shopping at Ikea. Our server was knowledgeable and patient answering our questions and making suggestions. My daughter and I ordered several appetizers and salads to share. Our sharing was accommodated readily with an extra plate brought without our having to request and no extra charge for sharing. Every morsel was delicious. We were made to  feel truly welcome and valued during our experience. 
This restaurant has been consistently excellent both times we visited, in two different cities. Now I'm wondering how I need to go about petitioning them to open one in Greenville!"}
{"text":"Clueless waiter...we ran out of the special 2 hours ago that you ordered 15 minutes ago. I asked why he didn't know given it was the special when he gave me my menu or took my order."}
{"text":"Love the Wednesday Dollar shrimp and oysters. Too bad the size of the shrimp has majorly shrunk. Cedar plank salmon was very good. It was on the summer menu.  Service is hit or miss. I sat in the bar tonight and had to go to the manager to get served.  Portions are not large but acceptable. Tonight is national cheesecake night so its on the house.  I like watching ballgames in the relaxed environment.  Tonight is surprisingly loud."}
{"text":"food was good... waited litterally two hours for bill seriously!!!!!!!!! they were so
mad about separating bill they made us wait. sorry it is NOT that
complicated to separate checks morons!!! way to ruin a great night

Food was overpriced"}
{"text":"I know, it is a chain and I am in Las Vegas.  Ask your waiter on the strip 'when was the last time they saw the highly rated chef their restaurant is name after'.  
  I went there for lunch twice while I was in Vegas.  (I had such a good experience the first time that I had to go back.)
  It has its own parking lot so parking was convenient and they offer  Valet parking but I dont see why you would need it.  The building is attractive from the outside and the interior is airy, simple and reminds me of most upscale chain seafood restaurants I have been to.
  Our greeter seem friendly and seated us immediately.  After maybe a minute or two tops our waitress arrived.  She was perhaps the best waitress I have ever had.  (I requested to sit in her section the next time we came and my request was granted.)
  We started our lunch by sharing a salad that was fresh and crisp and was not drowned in salad dressing, delicious.  One of my hobbies is making great salads and this one was as good as any of mine.  Next we split the Heirloom tomatoes with fresh mozzerella.  We got five fat slices of sweet, perfectly ripe tomatoes with decent sized slices of fresh mozzerella wedged between them.  I could not have asked for more.  Our next course was corn and seafood chowder.  I loved its creamy texture combined with sweet corn and pieces of shellfish.  For our main course, we had the blue grenadier and it was cooked perfectly per our request.   Although we were already pleasantly full we tried a couple of their inexpensive little desserts that they offer at lunch time.  They were a pleasant end to our lunch without making us uncomforably full.
   After reading some of the other review, I only hope it can live up to my expectations in the furure.  Make sure you ask for Tamarah and tell her hi for me."}
{"text":"Got this suggestion by valet /Christoper at Hyatt house. We wanted light dinner and he suggested their happy hour menu. Wow - amazing food service and prices! Really good selection for $3 $5 $9 dollars - great portions and could sample lots of food! Worth trying - ate at bar so pretty casual. Happy hour menu until 7pm!"}
{"text":"Grub Hub blamed McCormick and McCormick blamed Grub Hub.  No salad. No mashed potatoes.  No sauces.  Just the steak which was ok."}
{"text":"My fianc√© and I went here to celebrate and were a little disappointed. The menu is fairly expensive, but you can make it more affordable if you choose. We got the shrimp kisses to start. They were great and so were our drinks. However, our server had trouble answering questions about the cuts of steak on the menu. It's a steak and seafood place. The server should be well educated on steak and seafood. My fianc√©' sirloin tasted way better than my filet mignoin, unfortunately. The restaurant was also very very dark. The server could hardly check our IDs. We are both in our twenties and could see the menu ok, but others were using the flashlight on their phone. Overall, for the price we probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Veterans meal wife was included. I'm proud to have served and the offer and people were great the small portions are like, man I'm still hungry. 
 Wife still hungry ,granddaughter still hungry afraid to go near the desert. May cost too much.but manager and customer service were great. 
 If I could eat seafood it would be here. 
 They forgot our anniversary ,Mortons  didn't."}
{"text":"My shrimp kisses were delish but I was not pleased with the entree size of the lobster & steak entree for $28. The steak was dry and  only the size of my . I expected more for steak from a steakhouse. 
The other enteee blackened chicken fettuccine was nice."}
{"text":"Response to other reviews: portion sizes were fine.  Two of us eating at this restaurant had fish and there was plenty to eat.  So much to eat that we had left overs.  Somehow not all the leftovers appeared in the box, much to my chagrin.

Regardless, the food was reasonable and the prices not too high.  I wasn't really wowed by this place and the service was spotty.

I think you have better options but this place is just fine.  You won't have any innovative recipes to really recommend.  I really can't think of anything more to write about."}
{"text":"I have been to this location many times over the years. I started out loving it and then they were bought by Landry's and in my opinion it went downhill. But now they are no longer associated with Landry's and the quality is improving.

I went in for a quick lunch and sat at a table in the bar. The bartender was very friendly and provided excellent service. I had the small portion sea bass. It was delicious and a fine size for lunch. The edamame and mushrooms served with it were very flavorful. 

I look forward to trying this location again."}
{"text":"Spent $120 on dinner and the only thing I enjoyed was the cobb salad for appetizer. The waiter was probably the best I've ever had, so that's a positive. The entree's we ordered were cold, and NOT impressive for the price we paid.

Would not come back here at all."}
{"text":"While the food is fantastic, the service was very poor! From waiting on drinks to getting orders wrong.. if it wasn't for the experience we have downtown location I would never go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Ghastly experience for the second time. Did not write a review on the first dining fiasco in hopes that it was just an off night. Yesterday was Thanksgiving and we were invited by friends (6 total) to share a holiday dinner at this reputedly fine Las Vegas eatery where they tout that guests \"will experience culinary excellence at its best\". NOT! 

How can a network of chefs, even with a minimal of culinary background, completely flunk in the simple preparation and serving of Thanksgiving turkey dinners? We would probably have been better off had we dined at a Soup Kitchen, where the dinners are presumably served in adequate portions of tastily prepared food and served HOT."}
{"text":"Eh,

I don't normally go out to fine dining, but wife's best friend is in town and they wanted to eat here so, here we are. I called at 6pm for a 7pm reservation to be on the safe side to assure seating. I even asked on the phone if they were busy, lady said \"not at all\" .. so we arrived at 6:53pm, got a table right away, and not busy as was told on the phone. Our server didn't even arrive til about 10 mins later, the manager assisted us with drinks. So we started to order approximately 7:15. And we requested bread. Didn't come out til 7:30. Our food came out st 7:46. For timing, it's REALLY slow, and their service is beyond slow. 

Unsatisfactory."}
{"text":"Food was decent and the service was alright.  They have a large selection of wines and a good selection of food.  

We had the calamari which was good, swordfish was alright but could have been better seasoned and the black angus ribeye which was good.  

Deserts were alright.  Millionaire coffee was good, chocolate pie and the Apple pie was pretty good, Apple was better.  

Overall I would say it was average food at above average prices. 130$ for two +tip. 

Only real complaint is the booth was quite uncomfortable to sit in and we had to move one side closer to the table.  Also there were times we were waiting for service and it was not busy, mostly empty tables.   Maybe not enough servers idk."}
{"text":"halibut pesto was excellent on ragout of vegetables. wine list is a chalenge yet we had a very good wine eventually"}
{"text":"Meh. Ordered the prime rib Christmas chef special. Out came a slab of meat and mashed (reconstituted) potatoes. When I asked where the tomato and broccolini were, the waitress denied there existence. Later she returned with them, apologizing for the chef's error. Disappointed that the potatoes weren't made from scratch. Dessert was good, though."}
{"text":"When we arrived on Friday evening at around 7:30 for dinner, we thought this place would be full judging from the lack of parking and the fact that my friend who's a local said that McCormick & Schmick's is sometimes busy. Luckily the hostess invited us to sit anywhere we wished in the bar area as soon as we walked in, either at a table or booth.

I ordered a beer, my friend had a glass of wine and for our meals I ordered the ahi tuna and he the stuffed Atlantic salmon. Complimentary bread and butter were provided at the same time our drinks arrived. Our meals came out in good time, service was friendly and efficient and she suggested that we save room for dessert.

My friend was raving about his stuffed salmon, even after we left this place, so it must've been good.  It came with vegetables and mashed potatoes and looked as good as he made it sound.  While my ahi tuna was good, to be frank, I'd only order this dish if you're not terribly hungry.  It might also be good for 2 people to share as a starter.  It comes with a relatively small (perfectly cooked) tuna steak which is cut into slices, and it's served with a tiny bit of greens, a small mound of rice and pickled ginger, wasabi and soy sauce.

After our meals our server brought the dessert menu and so many things looked good and were recommended.  We both settled on the bread pudding with a slice of ice cream.  In reality we could've ordered one of those desserts to share, as both of us tapped out before we were able to finish them off."}
{"text":"Excellent steak and lobster. I ordered the steak medium rare and it was perfectly cooked. Service was great, clean environment, and wonderful staff. The lobster bisque was to die for! I highly recommend coming in for steak and seafood."}
{"text":"I would love to give them one star based on last nights Thanksgiving nightmare but my wife says I shouldn't rate them at all based on a holiday.  I think it's quite the opposite and they should have exceeded all expectations because it was a holiday.  They trashed my Thanksgiving.  It's a big deal.  If you aren't prepared to handle it, you should have let go of the greed and been closed.  I could write a novel about this terrible evening.  It was just one bad after another.  

We came in a sat at a table in the bar area while we waited until our 7:30 room to be ready.  We were there with a group split into 2 large tables.  There were only 2 people working the bar area and that included running food and making all the drinks for the restaurant.  I gave up waiting and waived for a couple drinks.  We ordered Kentucky Smashes and they were very good.  The Old Blue I ordered later was a lot less successful.  

At 7:35, I went to the host stand and they said a previous group was lingering and it would be 5 minutes.  I pressed him and asked if he was lying as I was starving and asked that I be seated in the main dining for dinner if it wasn't going to be indeed 5 minutes.  He insisted.  You all know what's coming next right?  30 minutes later!

We complained to a server while still in the bar and she ran and got us the first course while we were in the bar.  Kudos to her for seeing that we were desperate for some food.  

The service in the private room was sparse.  No one asked me if I wanted a drink or checked back to see if I wanted anything.  No one asked us if we wanted coffee or desert after our meal which was fine because it took 2 hours to get dinner!  They ran out of food and had to go to another location to get us food.  I can hardly believe they wouldn't just tell us what was going on and offer us something else to eat.  Meanwhile, Chris, the manager, lied to me again when I asked about food and said it would be up right away. You should have seen the dried out tough piece of meat they delivered to my dining companion!  That thing should NEVER EVER have left the kitchen.  When we said something, he offered to replace it but it was 9:30pm!!!!  Are you kidding me????  

The food was ok.  The green beans were raw, the squash and apple casserole was a puree.  There's a difference.  The gravy was really salty and unfortunately I added it without tasting it and my plate ended up salty.  Ugh.  There's so much more I could share here.  I will never ever come back to this or another of their properties.  EVER."}
{"text":"My drink was tasty but that is as far as the good part of our experience goes. 
Service was slow.
At one point a server broke a glass in the doorway to the room picked up the big pieces and left the little shards there the entirety of our 2.5 hour service.
After waiting an hour and fifteen minutes our meals finally arrived. NOT WORTH THE WAIT. Every single plate had food that was warm at best some of it actually cold. The $4 mash that came with my steak besides being an incredibly small portion for box quality potatoes was beginning to harden on he outside from sitting around so long. One of our friends was able to pick up the entire side of mash in one piece and flip it over without it shifting in shape at all. 
I ordered the ribeye which is $37 it like everything served was cold I quit on eating it after one bite. I have legitimately had better $10 steaks at cheap bars. None of our 11 friends were happy with the food, four of us myself included immediately returned it, my first time sending food back at a restaurant, we opted to not have it remade as we did not want to be left waiting for another hour for food. The manager came of right away as the server knew while serving us that it was far below quality food. He took the food back after trying to argue for the food quitting when my one friend showed him the steak juice was literally dried to the plate. He took off the food that was not eaten and gave us all 25% off (not enough if you ask me) and never truly apologized and didn't really seem apologetic. I opted to go to the McDonald's nearby and got some hot food there. Save yourself some time and money and just don't come here."}
{"text":"In town for a conference. Made reservations for our party of 6. Everything was excellent! The service was incredible. The food was delicious. The shrimp kisses really are delicious. I'm bad with names, so I don't remember our servers name but he was attentive, friendly and informative. Other servers would stop without hesitation if they thought we needed something. Unlike others have said, the service was friendly, attentive and timely. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"Had the most fabulous dinner last night!! It was my husband and mines first time to this restaurant. We had a 100 dollar gift card to use. So we walked in and saw the bar area was poppin so we wanted to have a drink before being seated for dinner. Made our way into two spots at the bar and we could see the guys were hustling! It was happy hour and man did it smell good in there. Drinks were flowing, people were having business meetings and date nights, or just making a new friend. We ordered two Titos Mexitinis which my husband pointed out tasted very similar to a lemon drop but made with sweet n sour instead of fresh lemon. However, they weren't bad. We decided we wanted to eat dinner at the bar. So we ordered bruschetta, jumbo lump crab cake tower with mango and avocado, the cedar planked salmon, their aged ribeye and mashed potatoes with mushrooms as a side. The steak came with broccoli and the salmon came with a salad and mixed squash. All of it was FANTASTIC! Perfectly cooked and seasoned. I have never had cooked salmon before and I tried my husband's and i couldn't believe what my palette was experiencing!! We ordered another round of drinks, actually trying their lemon drop. Our bartender Henry made the most delicious raspberry lemon drop. He was training another gentleman last night and both were working their tails off and doing such a great job together. I highly highly recommend eating here. I am defiantly going back to try more of their happy hour menu... the burger looked so juicy and delicious... for only 5 dollars!! I already can't wait to eat dinner there again!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and wonderful food served very attractively. Our food was served promptly. Seared Ahi Tuna for me and Crab legs for Phillip, and to end a perfect meal Creme Br√ªl√©e. Our servers were awesome, very attentive and always right on cue checking on us."}
{"text":"I went for the first time; absolutely loved it there. Wonderful atmosphere; very quiet; and the food was awesome! I cannot wait to go back"}
{"text":"Rolled in here during Queen's Feast week, it was crazy busy.  Needed to carry out some dinner; wasn't in a hurry.  I know their normal menu has a lot of complex items, but almost anything you want can be simply grilled or planked.  Some salmon, mahi mahi, with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed veggies, a salad and some Pellegrino made a perfect carryout meal.  The kitchen was very fast; I was out of there in 20 minutes.

I had a wonderful steak here a couple weeks ago that was cooked exactly as I ordered it; I think I'll skip all of the high priced places.

Here's a tip: if you have a special occasion (second honeymoon, anniversary) I think that if you let them know, they can print a customized menu for your meal.  They did that for me at the McCormick and Schmick's at Ghirardelli Square."}
{"text":"A decent respite from the craziness of the strip.  A decent happy hour, with an outdoor, vine covered patio.  

It's a chain restaurant, so you can't expect too much ingenuity.  Mussels in a white wine garlic sauce, buffalo wings, sliders, etc... But with prices under $10 per appetizers, mostly being $1.95 to $4.95, can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Well, let's just say we had too many a lobster lunch and dinner at this place from those late nights at work. Oftentimes they would run out of lobster (what is with the inventory levels at this place) and then I would freak out because I'm not a particular fan of their other offerings. I think I tried their etouffee once but was not impressed. On a separate occasion they had king crab's legs which were pretty good. Whatever it is, this is your typical McCormick's fare."}
{"text":"I have had two meals in the dining room and a handful (or two) of happy hours here. 

Dining room is nice but a bit stuffy. Yes, I get that you are trying to appeal to the upper crust, but it's so darn dark! The first meal there was with a larger work group and service was good but not great. Food was delicious but I definitely had my water go dry for a while quite a few times. A water pitcher at the table would have saved a few steps and gotten a higher review from me. 

My second meal was the worst of the two. The server was overwhelmed as she was the only one in her section and had a peach of a customer at the table adjacent to mine. I was there with a friend for a quick lunch and we let the server know this. She tried her damnedest to accommodate but the squeaky wheel gets the grease and this guy behind us was complaining about every item he could. We ordered our food (my friend got a salad and I got a bowl of the lobster bisque). It took roughly 40 minutes during the lunch rush to get the food, and we were one of 4 tables in that section. During our wait, we got about one refill of our drinks and some rolls to satiate us during the long wait. The entertainment during our water and rolls was the peach of a customer complaining so well that he not only got the manager to come out but also the head chef. The manager then said \"we're going to comp this meal and then give you a certificate to come back to a meal on us\". The complainer pushed the envelope saying \"will that include alcohol?\". Pssh. I dislike customers who only want something for free, and especially those managers who cater to that type of customer at the suffering of other guests. The food that time was just as good as the last time but I wish we had more time to enjoy it!

McCormick & Schmick's is known to have the best happy hours in town, and I will say that their prices are pretty good. You can get bruschetta or amazing humus and pita chips for $3 from 4:30 to 7PM. How awesome is that?! There's also a bunch of other apps at varying prices, going up to $9 per item. Have a few apps and you have dinner on the cheap! They also have $4.50 dirty vodka martinis and Manhattans, the drinks of choice of my husband and I. There are tons of other specials on liquors and beers but it is a limited selection of special drinks and you're looking at well liquor for most. 

I do have a few things to avoid at happy hour:
- Cheeseburger: At $5, it seems like a steal. But the patty is obviously straight from a freezer box (those scalloped edges give it away) and is flavorless. Waste of money when McD's is right down the block.
- Shots: Not only do they not know how to make many shots, but they charge a ridiculous price for them - close to double the cost of one of the drinks. I was even told \"we don't really serve shots a lot so I don't know how to make many\". Ehhh...bad bartender. 
- Night before a holiday: It is a madhouse and service is horrible! It is like they made the schedule completely oblivious to upcoming holidays. 

Odds are that I will be back here as it's right across the street from my office and coworkers enjoy going there for a quick one after work. I think I'll just continue to stick with the happy hour apps, my $4.50 dirty vodka martinis, and water. It's cheaper, quicker, and not as stressful as the dining room."}
{"text":"Went on a night where there wasn't a crowd of people. There was about 6 or so other groups of customers at a time during our stay. The service for how crowded it was had been good. It wasn't amazing where i would remember as superb.

Food wise it was decent. The wine menu was accommodating, this is also were we had the best from our server, as he did a good job on suggesting a pairing that fit most of our groups dishes. The portions were on the smaller side with enough but hungry, which is a good thing unless you love to stuff yourself.

Pricing for what it was i felt a little high. Not as high as some places i would highly recommend, but it simply isnt memorible enough to spend what we did."}
{"text":"Service was terribly slow and disorganized. Prices were incredibly high for the food. The food was good but not a place I'll ever visit again. Waiter was creepy and awkward and tried to sell us a gift card program at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Stopped here before a show at the Benedum Theatre.  We were promptly seated without a reservation and, telling our server we had allotted an hour before our theater excursion, we had ample time to order and enjoy our dinner.

I ordered the seared scallops and my husband ordered the shrimp scampi. We did without any other accompaniments as the prices were a la carte and pricey.  We were both happy with our meals and the plating was very nice.  My scallops did come with some cooked spinach and a potato hash which were sufficient and I didn't feel I needed another side.

Our server was efficient and kept us on time for our show so I am most thankful for the experience.

The four starts vs. five stars is about price.  Very steep in price for the experience as with most places offering a-la-carte dining."}
{"text":"Went for Queens feast tonight and decided the wife and I would go surf & turf. I ordered what was listed as filet medallion's and the wife ordered the twin lobster tails. What I got was a pre-sliced medallion which was about 3 ounces of meat. The twin lobster tails which we paid an upchare for we're quite small on the portion size as well. Flavor wise the meal was just ok, nothing special to warrant the price."}
{"text":"We stopped here during the taste of Charlotte. It was empty...sure sign we shud have picked on but gave them the benefit of the doubt. What a mistake. Food horrible."}
{"text":"It's not often that a chain restaurant delivers the goods, but that is the case here.  At least, it was when we visited the South Park location (there are two in Charlotte, we haven't tried the one Uptown).  There were three downsides, and neither one really detracted much.

The first was that was a bit louder than you might expect from a somewhat upscale eatery.  We were with a group of people, so it wasn't a bad problem.  If we were dining alone, it may have bothered us.

Related to this is that the service was a little slow, but again because we had a large group, it gave us time to talk.  This may have also been intentional because of our group size.  The staff was present, they just seemed a bit hands-off.  We may have been able to speed this up if we were so inclined.

The final potential downfall was the selection.  It was rather large, especially as we aren't usually seafood eaters.  We took the advice of the waiter on every count and were very happy with the results.  I'd highly recommend doing so."}
{"text":"First time in Charlotte, NC, just arrived in town and was starving.  Remembered McCormick & Schmick's as a very nice restaurant from when I was growing up so I walked over for a small bite at the bar.

First thing I noticed was that there was a man passed out in his chair at the bar.  Nobody seemed bothered or cared.  I ordered the jumbo chilled shrimp cocktail off the happy hour menu and when it arrived it had not been deveined.  I looked on the internet and confirmed what I was seeing was in fact what I thought it was - the shrimp's intestinal remains.  I was really surprised that a place like McCormick & Schmick's would serve its customers with such low quality care.  The whole thing turned me off.  If you want to have a nice meal or sit at a nice bar, there appears to be no shortage in the area.  Eddie Vs, Ruth's Chris, BLT Steak, and I'm sure many others I just don't know are within eyesight.  Spend your time and money at a place that prepares and serves its food with pride."}
{"text":"Went here for my birthday dinner.  Waitress was super nice and chatty.   The food was just average.  Veggies and orzo sides were so bland.  But the Parmesan crusted flounder was done pretty good.  Adult beverages were very very weak.   For the price, I could have thought of 100 other places I would rather have gone to. I guess the fact that they were not busy at all at 7:00 on a Friday night should have been a red flag.  At least now we know."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic experience here. I had no idea this location existed. We had reservations for restaurant week. We didn't wait long at all. We had a wonderful table that was optional if you wanted some privacy or not due to the curtains. Our server was very friendly and the food was good. Steaks were cooked to how we liked it. The whole experience was great!!"}
{"text":"Based on our recent visits, this restaurant is being adversely impacted by our economic woes.  The large dining room and bar area were entirely empty as were many of the private booths. The menu which once featured 50 varieties of fresh seafood has been drastically scaled back and menu price points are too high. Fortunately I still had a $50 gift certificate that, though expired, was honored.  

Our waiter provided menus, but then ignored us after a larger group at a nearby table was seated.  When he finally decided to return to our table, I told him that we expected better service or we were walking.  Service noticeably improved from that point forward.

We shared a delicious mixed salad with candied walnuts and blue cheese crumbles that was lightly dressed by balsamic vinaigrette.  My wife chose the Atlantic salmon entr√©e with fresh green beans and mashed potatoes.   I settled on the cioppino which included a Dungeness crab cluster, clams, squid and white fish. Both entrees were very good. 

An overall rating of 3.5 is appropriate."}
{"text":"Food was great but we had the most non attentive waitress. Was so disappointed that we were overlooked the whole entire time we were there. The other waitress even noticed that our salad plates has not been cleared after we had finished our dinner and apologized :("}
{"text":"Sat outside and had a nice evening . Didn't like when the homeless person came up and started begging though .  Crab cake was excellent . Sea bass and the fillet were both very good . I tried the blue cheese and onion mashed potatoes . I like them .  The waiter was pretty good . Just had to remind him to bring the bread service. Otherwise he did fine .   There was a saxophone player playing on one of the corners that made it seem romantic .  He deserved a tip !"}
{"text":"best steakhouse and seafood in downtown charlotte."}
{"text":"It had been a long time since we had been to M & S. Seafood sounded good so we headed to the Southside. We were dining early, around 5:30, and the restaurant was 1/3 full. Our waitress was very nice and she was training a nice young man. My husband and I copied the agree on appetizers so we ordered salads. My husband had the Caprese salad. It had heirloom tomatoes, mozzarella slices, fresh herbs, and some swirls of balsamic vinegar. It was wonderful!!  I had the Chopped salad without the tomatoes. It had bacon, blue cheese, green olives, and a white balsamic dressing. It was one of the best salads I've ever had. I would go back just to eat that salad. 
I ordered the Ultimate Grill for dinner. It was scallops, crab stuffed shrimp, grilled shrimp, and a portion of salmon. It came with mashed potatoes and green beans. The scallops were cooked perfectly as was the grilled shrimp and grilled salmon. I'm usually not a fan of stuffed shrimp because the stuffing usually isn't good but this was amazing. The stuffing was mostly crab. I definitely cleaned my plate!
The hubby ordered the Shrimp Triolgy. It had Shrimp Scampi, Stuffed Shrimp, and Fried Shrimp. It came with green beans and squash risotto. He enjoyed the Stuffed Shrimp as much as I did. The Fried Shrimp was very lightly battered and crispy. He wouldn't share the Shrimp Scampi so you know that was his favorite. LOL. I didn't think I would like the squash risotto but it was very good. The squash wasn't squishy which I really liked my hubby's plate was cleaned as well. 
Fantastic food and fantastic service. A perfect dining experience."}
{"text":"First time at a McCormick. Not impressed at all. 
Totally blah.. 
Had the halibut and I think it was as memorable as a piece of toast..."}
{"text":"Stop in for Happy Hour and it was great. 1/2 drink burger and fries for only $7.00. Matt was the best at making drinks. Enjoy the happy hour"}
{"text":"We were on a business trip and it was my birthday, so my coworkers let me pick where to go for dinner.  I chose McCormick & Schmick's because the seafood on the menu looked fantastic.  We shared shrimp kisses which was shrimp wrapped in pepper jack cheese and bacon, what's not to love! I had Seared Sea Scallops with Tomato Pesto, Crab Potato Hash, Saut√©ed Spinach and it was absolutely amazing.  My friend Nicole B had Blackened Mahi Mahi with Crabmeat Sautee, Andouille Mashed Potatoes, and they substituted asparagus because she does not like spinach.  She loved it! The 3rd party had friend shrimp and French fries. My friend told the waitress it was my birthday and she said she had a gift for me. It was copy of the menu that had my name and birthday on it, nice but not as good as free dessert would have been! And for dessert, we shared the Upside Down Candied Walnut Apple Pie
Baked Twice with a Candied Walnut Crust, Warm Caramel
Sauce and Served with Cinnamon Ice Cream.  The desserts are made in-house and when I say that was the best dessert I have ever eaten I am not exaggerating! We visited 35 restaurants in 12 days, and this one was in our top 3!"}
{"text":"BLAND!!! I had to crack the salt shaker on my 1/18 oz of steak. I ordered the top sirloin; the dish was served with about six green beans and two little potato croquet. The steak was so small if I hadn't ordered it rare I'm sure it would of shrunk to the side of a quail egg. The \"steamed\" green beans were raw! My mom almost chocked on them. 

They deserve the 1-star because their outdoor seating is beautiful and their raspberry tiramisu is actually pretty decent. My bill was wayyy over $100 dollars and sooo not worth it."}
{"text":"Came for the 5-7pm happy hour only but probably one of the best in uptown! No drinks unfortunately, but their food specials were worth the price, especially the burgers and taco menu items. Haven't tried their regular menu, but the service at the bar was pretty good too. Check it out if you're looking for some good eats at a value."}
{"text":"Great place and delicious good. bourbon glazed salmon is the best. We enjoyed our dinner at McCormick&Shmick and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"If I could leave zero stars, I would. Walked in at 5:10, there were a total of 5 people in the bar. We sat there for 20 minutes, asked about a server, and still didn't receive service. There was a gentleman who walked in 10 minutes after us, placed his drink order AND food order and we still didn't have a single server acknowledge us, and there were four of them behind the bar. We decided to go elsewhere & as we were leaving the bartender tells us to have a good one. I shared my concerns with the host and he apologized, but that's it. Disappointed as the happy hour specials are great, but clearly the staff could care less about their customers and actually offering to help."}
{"text":"Staff is exceptional, food is great. Always pleasantly greeted. The private nooks are also a very nice change from the norm."}
{"text":"A $21 lobster add-on should be cooked properly, at least the second time. We sent it back and the second tail came out as tough as the first. The manager asked whether it was better. When we told him it was not (and we ate none of it), we were stunned to see it still on the bill. The steak, while cooked perfectly, was so salty that we could not taste the beef at all. The service was slow and unprofessional, although pleasant   We paid the full tab and will never return.  Horrible experience."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice with co-works, and I have to say the food is generally very good. Everything else in my experiences, however, has been pretty mediocre.
I've tried the andouille shrimp pasta, which was excellent, and I have also had the stuffed flounder, which was good but not great. Both dishes were good quality but very small portions and definitely overpriced for what you get. I also have to point out that in my most recent visit the complementary bread was rock hard (literally able to hit it on a plate an not produce crumbs which my co-worker did). Aside from the small portions, I've also been pretty disappointed in the service. The food came out fairly slowly on both occasions, especially for business lunches, and the servers have certainly not wow'ed me in any way."}
{"text":"My family had salmon, shrimp, oysters, prime rib. The stuffed salmon was delicious, shellfish crisp & not soggy, & prime rib rare & hot.

Upscale brass & wood setting with a cozy feel. Service was prompt but not hovering even though it was crowded on Christmas Eve."}
{"text":"I had mussels at the S Tryon St 3/23/18 location and I became extremely ill that night with severe diarrhea, vomiting and intestinal cramping, which has lasted for THREE DAYS!  I expect reimbursement for my meal AND for the $261 conference I missed on Saturday AND for the work I missed today. Expect a call from Mecklenburg County Environmental Health and I expect a check for $500!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place and their excellent steaks..."}
{"text":"I met with some clients here for lunch.  Yelpers had truly scared me about the consistency of their delivery.  Let me say, in my case, the service was excellent.  We had an older gentleman as a server, with a thick german accent, who cracked jokes and kept the lunch moving along smoothly, as well as being fully fluent in the menu items.  I had the lobster bisque and if you look at the picture it was amazing, they actually bring you a little tower of lobster and then pour the hot bisque around it, served with freshly baked bread, my mouth is watering just remembering it.

Note, it was not cheap, but that's why they made expense accounts."}
{"text":"Only went for a drink.  Sunday early evening, place was pretty empty.  I sat at the bar and the waitress/bartender was very pleasant.  
I love the PUB feel of this place.(only speaking of the bar area)  It is Pub-like, but Upscale Pub.
Just about every liquor you could want for a drink, large selection of wine and prices were normal for downtown.  
I took a look at the menu and would come back here when I had more time to try some entrees."}
{"text":"Apparently they spent a lot of money getting rid of their Tiffany glass so they could redecorate with stuff from Goodwill. Except you can't find 60's-style carpet at Goodwill any more. The seafood was still good, but in general seemed a notch below what it used to be. Thanks a lot Landreys."}
{"text":"Good Happy hour for the food ok happy hour for the drinks. I got a burger it was really big so i cut it in four to make them sliders. The burger was prob one of the best i have had yet in charlotte. Also got some muscles those were also good and fresh. The salad needs some work though.  I got a cezer plain the lettuce was fresh but not super fresh. The dressing was a biz water down. They need to work on the quality of the dressing. The out door seating is nice and big. Great for people watching on the weekends. Lots of foot traffic. The inside was really big. clean with valet."}
{"text":"It was our anniversary and wanted to go for a better than average dining experience.  This was not the place.  We were seated by the hostess who was very nice.  Our waiter approached and told us he would be right back.  That was 15 minutes.  Our salad came along with 5 thin slices of bread.    Very good salad.  Our meal arrived as I put the last bit of salad in my mouth.  Felt a little rushed.  Waiter put our food down and disappeared.  Had to ask the other wait staff to track down our waiter two to three times.  We wanted a little more bread, which we never did get until we were done eating and wanted our coffee.  We received our bill and waiter stood over us and watched as my husband felt compelled to leave a good tip.  Window ledges next to us were extremely dusty and not very appetizing.  I phoned the management to complain and his response was, \"thank you for letting us know.\"  Not, I'm so sorry, please try us again.  The funny thing is this was Sunday evening and the restaurant was practically empty.  Why was our service so poor?"}
{"text":"Planned a going away party for a friend last minute and was able to get a reservation for 20 people with less than 24 hours notice. We were even given a private dining room to accommodate our large party. Management and staff were very friendly and accommodating and made my friend's going away party very memorable. 

As for the food here, it is too notch quality.  We waited at the bar until the rest of our party arrived. They have a pretty good happy hour menu. Blue cheese chips which were recommended by the bartender were so tasty and addicting. Freshly fried chips with warm melty blue cheese, yum! I couldn't get enough. I had the Connecticut blue point oysters for appetizer which were pretty good as far as freshness. For dinner, I had the Stuffed Atlantic salmon, which was stuffed with crab and gooey Brie cheese. It was very rich in flavor yet light, So heavenly. Salmon was cooked to perfection and matched well with creamy mashed potatoes and and broccoli. Washed my wonderful meal down with a refreshing cucumber martini. Most definitely would return here in the future."}
{"text":"We just sat in the bar at the table top window seating for 15 minutes and didn't get acknowledge by the bar tender or the three waiters/waitress in the bar area. instead they conversed, joked, laughed, went out side to chat with the valet. So we went next door to Ruth Chris and got treated like we owned the place."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time last night and I was pleasantly surprised. While the service was painfully slow (i.e. 15 minutes wait for our $70 bottle of wine), the food - almond crusted rainbow trout with chive butter and macaroni and cheese - was very good. My hunch is that the service was slow because EVERY table was occupied and there were also several parties waiting to be seated. I actually liked M&S much more than places like the much-heralded Salt of the Earth (which I have been to three times) because the preparation was simple and you can enjoy the fundamental flavors of the fish without it being \"disguised\" by 16 other disparate ingredients."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night and were seated almost immediately. In general, the service was nice, but it took a bit too long for our orders to be served. 

Anyways, we started with the seasonal spring sashimi and oysters. I liked the assortment of delectables on the sashimi plate; it offered a fresh contrast between spicy, bitter, and fatty. My group really liked the oysters. The couple of oysters I tried were fine.

For the main entree, I had another seasonal special: the Cobia with crab chimichurri. I was underwhelmed with this dish. The Cobia was thoroughly cooked through and did not have enough flavor to be served as a feature; hence the chimichurri! I thought this was a great idea fir a pairing. Unfortunately, the chimi was not very flavorful. It was nowhere near as good as the chimichurris I've had at Gaucho and Cure. Also, I did not taste or see any crab. I think the idea behind the dish is good, yet it needs to be executed better.

The dish came with a cheese pancake and a fried, stuffed jalape√±o. I actually found these two items to be better than the fish. I think the jalape√±o was stuffed with ricotta or a similar cheese. I wouldn't have mind a few of these as an appetizer!"}
{"text":"A lesson for all. Stay away from this restaurant on crowded days. Orders came out wrong and took over an hour on Mother's Day. This location can't handle a large crowd for simple brunch food. When the wrong food came out, it was sent back and returned to us with a crab cake tossed onto the plate. It was obvious they hadn't cooked new food because they aren't capable of getting food out in 3 minutes. The crab cakes look like a sad pile of crab and filler.

What a shame that an experience like this makes me want to stay away for good. The manager here should be fired for incompetence."}
{"text":"Visited this place with a friend for a first meeting.  So we felt this might be an appropriate Fancy-ish place.  Upon entering the nearly empty resturaunt, we were asked if we had a reservation. No. We were walk ups.  They seated us just fine. 

Our waiter seemed a little.. lost?  We placed our order - started with Coconut Shrimp. For $12.00 I certainly thought we'd get more than 4. Alas I should ask rather than think.  I then ordered a wedge salad, which was amazing.  We did order a Beer, but rather than it coming right out, it seemed to take a while, and was finally delivered with the apology of the keg being changed. 

When our meals came out, Mine the parmesan crusted chicken and his the fish and chips, were satisfactory, save we had to ask for the tarter sauce, since his fish and chips were served with cocktail sauce, again, very strange.  The food was tasty, the chicken was cooked well, and the sides were yummy. 

The prices were .. a bit out of range for what we got, and the service. They were very VERY interested on pressing me into getting the rewards card, even after letting them know that I was from out of state."}
{"text":"Service, food, ambiance. This place hits all of them. Best seafood we've had in Charlotte so far. They have a great wine selection if you are a wino like me, and it's also good to know that their menus are printed daily based on the specials that they offer. Our waitress was awesome at helping us choose food, she was right on point. It's a little on the pricey side, but so worth it. FYI - my fiancee ordered surf n turf - do not be afraid to order steak here! It was phenomenal. We will be heading back there soon."}
{"text":"I ordered the shrimp scampi for takeout. First they couldn't remember who took my order or if it was ready yet. Then a manager took control and put the order in while I waited at the bar. The bartender didn't say a single word--didn't offer water or a drink as I waited. That was rude. On to the food...the scampi is good. Well seasoned, not overly oily or buttery as most Scampis are, and a healthy portion of jumbo shrimp. Some believe the price is high, but at $23 I think it's priced about right. Maybe they could add bread or something, however I don't think they're known for fresh bread anyway. All in all I would definitely order t again."}
{"text":"I was very impressed with everything about this restaurant I called a week before about reservation a young man named Martin got me set he was very helpful I let him know it was my bff 40th birthday and the restaurant came through in a major way complimentary valet was great we was seated as soon as we got there the restaurant itself was beautiful spacious the lightning was just right and they printed a special menu up just for the birthday girl she was amazed and everything was divine she enjoyed herself tremendously and so did the rest of us thank you for making her 40th birthday dinner a success"}
{"text":"My experience at this restaurant was one of the worst I've ever had. There was plastic in my salad as if the leaves were Unbagged and plastic was mixed in with the lettuce, after which the waiter very nonchalantly asked me if I would like another salad.  No apology or concern. We waited over an hour for our food. Another party at my table received the wrong meal and then had to wait another thirty minutes. We eventually asked for the manager. It took 4 times asking and 45 additional minutes before she made her way to our table. The food was subpar. Definitely not the experience I expected at a seafood/steak restaurant. Overall, it was a terrible experience and I will never be back."}
{"text":"Happy birthday to me!

My family took me here tonight for my birthday and it was a delight.  The atmosphere was luxurious and lovely, especially when our server graciously moved us away from the kitchen and to a quieter table.  The food was rich but wonderful.  Highlights:

- Fried calamari was crunchy and flavorful and included a variety of surprise vegetables as well.  Perfect for a family game of \"guess what it is before you bite into it\" (bok choy turned out to be artichoke, carrot was sweet potato)
- My scallops were divine, perfectly cooked with a rich butter sauce and unusual, tasty potato hash.
- My mom was tickled by the size of her flounder dish (\"I have TWO fillets!\") and the butternut squash orzo that accompanied it just melted in your mouth.  
- My eighteen year old brother announced he would try fish and chips for the first time, and is now worried that the dense Yuengling batter and tasty, flaky fish has ruined him for \"regular\" f&c.  
- Seared tuna and stuffed shrimp, also lovely.

Tim was the PERFECT server from start to finish.  He made my birthday really special.  

Thanks Tim and McCormick & Schmick's!"}
{"text":"Went here for a first date around 9 pm on a Monday. The place was pretty empty as was to be expected at that time. Both of us got filet mignon and lobster tails. We got a side of lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus. Everything was phenomenal. We ate it all and wished we had room for more."}
{"text":"While I love the food, sometimes they are under staffed and over the last five visits they rarely notice the glass that's empty and tracking Someone down can take time. However they have an amazing happy hour and specials which is delightful in an overpriced downtown. Great effort, some fine tuning needed"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times mainly for lunch meetings and although, I am not a big seafood fan they do have other things on the menu you can order such as a turkey sandwich, different salads, steak, and a cheeseburger. I actually got the traditional fish n chips and they were pretty good. They served me 4 decent sized pieces of fish mixed in with an order of fries. I wish they gave you more fries, but overall it was pretty good and something I would get again. The fish was crispy on the outside and beautifully cooked on the inside. It was served with a side of spicy tartar sauce which I enjoyed. The service was good too. We had a party of 6 and they had two servers constantly refilling our drinks and checking in on us. I do think every meal is a few bucks overpriced. My fish n chips were $15.99 and $5.99 for a small cup of soup off the lunch menu. I don't mind paying for a good meal but, for the prices I would like more portions. I think their dinner menu is even more expensive. Inside they have a nice restaurant with a large dining room for seating. Good place to go!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I had dinner here on a Friday night, and we chose to sit at the bar. Jen was our bartender and she took very good care of us. We started with the coast to coast tuna which was a nice take on an Ahi tuna 2 ways (seared and tartare). I had the caesar salad with anchovy as my salad course. The salad was amazing, I will say that they gave me way too many anchovies and I had to remove some, but no harm done there. For our main course, I had the scallops and my friend had the filet mignon. I was very impressed with the scallops - they were out of this world! The scallops were cooked to perfection with a nice sear on the outside and slightly transparent in the middle. The potato crab hash was a great accompaniment as well! My friend gave me a bite of his steak and it was also cooked exactly as he requested - medium rare with a nice warm red center. All in all, we had a great experience and it was nice that the manager, Amanda, stopped by and said a few nice words just to make sure we were completely enjoying our dining experience! Kudos to McCormick & Schmick's!"}
{"text":"Torn between 3 and 4 stars. I love seafood and they had so many options on the menu that I wanted to try. They have a lot of unique seafood. They allow you to substitute any sides to customize your dish. 

My salad had a bit much cheese, but was delicious. I had the grilled salmon with brussel sprouts. Salmon was a bit dry, but still good. I prefer brussel sprouts to be crispy and they weren't, but they came mixed with other veggies such as beets which was delicious. 

My meal was still good, but I would prefer something else next time."}
{"text":"We saw a steak and lobster for $24.99 advertisement and decided to give it a try. The restaurant is a bit old-fashioned and there were quite a few senior citizens dining.  We had to be the only two people under 40 in the entire place, lol.  But that's okay because we weren't there to socialize. We there to grub!! We both got the special and we were extremely impressed.  The steak and lobster were both cooked PERFECTLY.  We didn't order any sides or appetizers and it was just the right amount of food.  Our server, Michael G., was super nice and friendly.

Not exactly your trendy \"seen and be seen\" type of ambiance, but if you just want a quiet excellent quality meal, this is perfect. And our bill was so cheap, it felt like we were robbing the place."}
{"text":"Mothers Day at lunch was very busy here. All the staff were very nice and friendly. The Calamari  was overbreaded and under cooked. Our nice waiter said he would mention it to the kitchen but that was the end of it. My filet was overcooked and very dry, requiring steak sauce to eat it. One of our guests had the flounder which left much to be desired. The fried shrimp was butterflied in a way that left it overcooked and rubbery. My son's filet was cooked better. Overall for the amount of money this was a dissappointing meal. We have ate at this chain in many states and are usually treated to a better meal. The mixed drinks were crafted very well."}
{"text":"Restaurant week review!

We were seated at a table for two without a wait at 1pm, and the lunch time deal was for $20.15 (+ tax, tip).

I ordered:

Blue Crab and Roasted Corn Chowder (Fresh Roasted Corn, Chili Oil, and Chives)
- This was very creamy, and it had the right amount of crab pieces.

Northwest Salmon Saut√© (Wild Mushrooms, Asparagus, Hazelnuts, Fresh Raspberries, Lemon Cream Sauce)
- This reminded me of a stir fry, but the chunks of salmon were the right and best kind of crispy on the outside. The cream sauce complimented the vegetables and salmon very well. 

Mini Molten Chocolate Cake (Heath Bar Pieces, Vanilla Ice Cream and Chocolate Sauce)
- I love Heath bars! The whole dessert was very rich.

And not included in the restaurant week deal, we ordered the Lump Crab Tower with avocado, mango, and orange vinaigrette. This dish was a mix of interesting flavors, which the waiter described to us as \"light and refreshing,\" which it certainly was. The whole chunks of avocado might have been my favorite part. 

Excellent service. The only criticism I may have is that the interior and atmosphere is similar to a dimly lit hotel lobby.

I have seen that they have happy hour specials, so I mean to return!"}
{"text":"Really great food! Bring your wallet on full.  The inside is clean and classic with dark colors that give the place a classy vibe.  The drinks were just right with just the right amount of kick.  I recommend the strawberry Arnold Palmer if you are looking for something non-alchohlic. Sweet and tangy-yum! The portions for my meal were in par with most resturants of this type-filling but not too much.  The wait staff were nice but service was a bit slow.  Our waitress pretty much knew nothing about the menu but was sweet. I would go again and recommend for lunch or a nice night with your honey."}
{"text":"Pescatarian Heaven

Last night my friend girls and I stopped into M & S to celebrate life and friendship. 

M&S had a modified menu due to NAB conference but thankfully the chef was able to make a few modifications.

The ambiance was great and my friends and I really enjoyed plenty of the food selections. 

APPETIZERS
* Shrimp Kisses (I passed due to dietary restrictions but the onion ring garnish was pretty tasty)
*Lump Crab Tower YUMMY
*Lobster Bites (a bit salty but I enjoyed devouring these delish bites dipped in Lobster Bisque)
*Chopped Salad
*Brussels Sprout & Pancetta Potatoes

MAINS
*Lobster Mash
*Center Cut Filet
*Ultimate Mixed Grill
*Shrimp Mac and Cheese

Dessert 
*Chocolate Bag
*White Chocolate Bread Pudding
*Upside Down Candid Apple Pie (OMG MUST ORDER)

Overall the service was great and I'd definitely return! 

Bill: Nearly $400"}
{"text":"Went with a work associate to grab a quick lunch. As the food scene has dramatically increased in downtown Pittsburgh M&S seemed almost deserted. We had an hour before we both had business calls to attend, and with the sparse crowd figured that we would be a non-issue. While the food was spot on and delicious the service was slow and lacking that special vibe. I asked for a cup of ice when the waitress refilled my tea but was jut happy in the end to get her to come get the checks so we could get back to work. Bottom line food is good but you need more than a lunch hour to enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love me some seafood and McCormick's has always been one of my favorites.  Since the ones closest to me in the L.A. area closed, I've been missing McCormick's and just had to make my way here while staying on the Strip.
I walked in and was greeted very warmly. Sat at the bar and Nicole was there to help.  I ordered the stuffed Salmon with veggies and potatoes.  The salmon was very good, though not great.  I like it cooked a little more than it was.  No fault of theirs; I will next time mention that. The veggies and mashed potatoes were excellent.   
The place was not crowded whatsoever on this Saturday night, which was a nice relief from all the crowds on the Strip.  I enjoyed my meal so much more because of that.

Service was excellent and the atmosphere was fantastic, I will indeed visit here again next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Six of us on a Saturday night.  Libations and Food and Dessert - Oh my!

We started with beverages, Red Sangria and Spicy Tequila stole the show.  On the non-alcoholic side, they make a fabulous Arnold Palmer.

Appetizers:  Shrimp Kisses are a must, as are the fried artichoke hearts and the corn salsa.  We left not a morsel.

Bread: plentiful, fresh and so good - as was the wedge salad.

Manager David popped by to say hello and warmly welcome us to Mc&S.  But back to Anne - who kept us fed, watered, prepped and cleared.  

Except for happy noises, we were only quiet during the main course consumption:  The Barramundi special was beautiful and proclaimed tasty.  Two of us chose the Scallops, they were quite large and disappeared.  Shrimp and steak with sweet potatoes, done perfectly.  Pasta for my daring Hubs - he loved it.  I chose the blackened Salmon with mashed potatoes and everything complimented the savory blackened flavoring very nicely. We were six happy campers.  But we didn't stop there...

Desserts to be shared!  upside down apple walnut pie with cinnamon ice cream.  And a bag of chocolate.  Yes, a dark chocolate, stand up \"brown bag\" filled with white chocolate mousse and topped with fresh fruits.  It was crazy good.

The Mc&S atmosphere is calm and upscale casual.  We could hear each other talking.  The staff is engaging and the prices are reasonable.  We had a great time sharing an evening at this high end chain - we will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love seafood so naturally a place that serves both seafood and steak can't go wrong. The decor in this place is beautiful!! High ceilings large booths, white cloth tables and even certain seats that have drawn curtains. 

I first came here with my sister last year before a movie. Our server informed of us of the day's specials as well as his opinion of the wines we were interested in. We order a bottle of Blackstone Merlot and a dozen Virginia oysters. Delicious! The oysters were sweet and tasted as if they were bathed in purified water. Even with a squeeze of lemon they didn't lose their ocean flavor and pungency. 

For an appetizer we enjoyed their fried calamari \"Fritto\" that is served with marinara and some kind of lemony cream sauce. The tasted light and crispy and even better once dipped in the sauces. My favorite was the lemon cream sauce. Besides squid there were various  types of vegetables like cauliflower, carrots and peppers. For our main course I selected a basic Caesar salad and my sister chose the same. The dressing was thick but their wasn't enough for the salad. when I asked for extra dressing our waiter brought us a small dish with only enough for one salad but we made it stretch any how. Towards the end of the meal we decided their was still room for desert.

My favorite part about this place is their upside down apple pie. It has a wonderfully buttery crust, warm soft apples drizzled in caramel and cinnamon. The topped it with a small scoop of french vanilla ice cream also drizzled in caramel and cinnamon. It complemented the pie so well and slowly melted from the apple pie warmth. The ice cream was very creamy and not watery or flavorless. It cost $10 a slice but is so worth it, my taste buds have never enjoyed pie more than they have at McCormick's.

With all the lovely decorations, warmth, and intimate environment i would list this place as a great spot for personal time away from the hustle and bustle or just a relaxing eat for you and your loved ones. I sometimes go here just for the apple pie ;)"}
{"text":"Special date night and we just like to have fun, interact with the staff and enjoy good wine. Unfortunately our waiter was not in the same frame of mind, in fact he ruined the evening for me. (Diners on Aug 20, 15)
Then the food? Not at all up to par. We only picked at our food and left more than half behind. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"We went to McCormick & Schmick's at the South Park Mall location at approximately 8pm on Tuesday, May 31, 2016. The was table was nice, but we were seated next to a large loud group of people, while the restaurant was practically empty. I had Buttermilk Fried Shrimp, my Wife had the Parmesan Crusted Flounder. The Shrimp entree was excellent, and I would recommend it. The Flounder entree was greasy, over seasoned,and not good at all. The service was fine. I had a Margarita, and my wife had a couple of glasses of Riesling. The drinks, and the fresh bread were probably the best things we had. It was a little pricey, and actually expected a better experience. My past experiences at the Uptown Charlotte location were much better."}
{"text":"Had dinner there today and the service was horrible. The waitress was  not friendly at all, food was not warm, bread was cold and waited for about 20mins before our waiter came after we were seated. Will not recommend this restaurant/location to anybody"}
{"text":"Decent restaurant.  The food is tasty and the waitstaff was quite helpful in guiding us toward making our meal selections.  The place gets three stars because the snooty hostess had an issue since we did not have a reservation, but the place was hardly busy for the time of day so what was the big deal?"}
{"text":"Came here again for happy hour for a quick business meeting and found it growing on me a little bit - the food was better, service was better, etc. Overall, a nice experience."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this chain in years. Went tonight for a group party. The food has really gone down. The mashed potatoes tasted like they were made from an instant mix. The green beans were way over cooked. The steak medallions were tender but the sauce was tangy. Not the good food I use to remember having.  I won't be back. It's sad to see a place loose the good food standard. Maybe it was a large party menu issue?"}
{"text":"I had lunch here yesterday and it was awesome.  Our very nice waitress went over the menu with us and gave us some helpful recommendations.  We learned that the menus are printed twice daily depending on what fresh fish they've received that day.  The fresh fish and their bays of origin were printed at the top of the menu as well.  Well, that's cool.

We started off with a large plate of fried calamari - it was hot, crispy, salty and served with 3 different dipping sauces.

I ordered a cup of their crab soup and a side salad to start.  The soup was really good - a hot tomato based vegetable soup with chunks and shreds of fresh crab meat.  From the sighs of appreciation around the table, I think that the seafood chowder must have been very good as well.  The salad was dressed with a tangy vinaigrette and it was about as good as any mixed green salad could be.

Per the waitress' enthusiastic recommendation, I ordered the mahi mahi cakes.  They were basically prepared crab cake style and were flash fried so they were crispy and browned on the outside, soft and flaky on the inside.  They were served in a slightly spicy tomato-based sauce and topped with fresh salsa.  The meat was strongly seasoned with pepper and various spices so it wasn't fishy at all.  The two cakes also came with a large triangle of spicy vegetable-studded polenta.

We were stuffed after our meals, so we didn't get to try any of the desserts but they looked hearty and very all-American.

Maybe I'm accustomed to NYC prices, but I found McCormick & Schmick's friggin' cheap.  The whole meal, including drinks, appetizers, and entrees for 6 people only cost $150 after tax & tip!  It makes me almost want to move to the South.

Note: I think there's an M&S in NYC (near Rockefeller) too, but I think that it's more expensive, hence less awesome."}
{"text":"Had our birthday dinner here last night.  Right off the bat upon entering the decor and ambiance was really nice, promptly seated and immediately met by our waitress Anna who was awesome!!  Completely attentive to every aspect, knowledge of the menu, specials and lighthearted and friendly.  It was obvious that her goal was to make sure we had an enjoyable experience.  We had lobster bites a the appetizer, lightly breaded with 2 dipping sauces served in a lobster shell - very tasty.  Our son had the lobster bisque soup which was amazing.  Hot sourdough bread fresh out of the oven served with our salads which were a generous portion and very flavorful with a light vinaigrette house dressing.  Main courses were fabulous with a generous portion.  Creme Brule with fresh fruit as a free birthday dessert.  I was worried the price wouldn't be worth the amount of food but I was wrong.  Very much worth every cent.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that I really like my food hot and it was lukewarm."}
{"text":"I ate here during a recent visit to Charlotte with a large group of people.  While our service was great, the food was just so-so.  I really don't get the big deal about McCormick & Schmick's.  I'd probably never eat there again.  I ordered the salmon rigatoni and it was OK while eating, but I had bad stomach pains for the rest of the night."}
{"text":"Very nice place in town and went for lunch.  Got the calamari and they must dump a variety of things in the fryer because on the plate were also jalopeno peppers and a couple shrimp.  The peppers gave the calamari a spicy taste.   I ordered medium roasted salmon and it came raw in the middle and just looked nuked and the grilled veggies were brown and overdone.  Nothing what you expect for a high end restaurant."}
{"text":"Service was great and the food was awesome!!! I decided on two appetizers for my meal and they were both AMAZING!! The stuffed mushrooms and crab cake!!"}
{"text":"The decor is beautiful. The waitress was one of the best! I had the McCormick's Seafood Trio. You'll only get three small grilled shrimps and three small stuff shrimp. They were tasty but...  The salmon was about 1/6 of normal cut. It was seasoned well.  The coffee must be a house blend. It was unspectacular.

In sum, I haven't been impressed with M&C. I went to the one at the National Harbor (MD) also. On both occasions I received some good food but nothing worth the price. You will not be disappointed but you won't walk away saying, \"This is the best meal ever.\"  We had debated about going Lawry's or M&C. I can't say it was a bad decision to come to M&C since the food was pretty decent."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this restaurant in awhile, but great food.  Sit outside and watch the trolley cars."}
{"text":"Our group of 19 had dinner here tonight. Our organizer had chosen a fixed menu. The lobster bisque was outstanding. I then had the salmon with blueberry reduction. Very tasts. Most of the group had steak which they said was very good. I had apple cobbler type dessert. Excellent. The apples were not overcooked. They were still firm and very tasty with the spice of cinamon and caramel. A great experience.  Our organizer had chosen wines. Oddly the servers were not very knowledgeable about them. Service including speed of plating our three courses was very good."}
{"text":"Came here for Happy Hour (around 6:30 PM) and a quick bite. 

We were seated in no time at all on the outdoor patio. This location is in the heart of uptown so it's a good place to watch what's going on outside.

It was a little busy during happy hour and I think that they were understaffed because there was a delay in getting our food and drinks.  

I ordered the fish tacos with southwest slaw ($5) - great portions for the price and a half dozen oysters - blue point. I was a little disappointed in the oysters - as they cost $2.45 each. There was a lot of shell in them like they hadn't been shucked properly and some were pretty tiny even though the waitress advertised them as being the biggest ones on the menu.

My boyfriend ordered the calamari ($5) and coconut shrimp ($9). The calamari was OK but they put in some other fried veggies which I thought was a cop out.

I had one glass of the zinfandel and my boyfriend had one or two drinks and the bill came out to around $60.00. We should have just stuck to the HH menu.

Also, my one complaint about this location was that this is supposed to be an upscale-isn seafood restaurant and the bathrooms were a bit janky."}
{"text":"Class cannot begin to describe this establishment.  While away on business with 14 colleagues I attempted to to reserve a table on open table app on valentines day only to realize upon arrival that the reservation for the 15th of Feb.  The management did not hesitate to accomadate all of us!

The food was phenomenal! I had the oysters and wine as an appetizer, amazing!  For my main course I enjoyed a blue cheeze with onions and mushrooms topped ribeye with asparagus apears, absolutely to die for!

Thank you so much to this establishment for going out of its way on one of the busiest dining holidays of the year!

God bless!"}
{"text":"My friend and I went out to lunch yesterday after dropping some $$$ at the Container Store.  The food was delicious, beautifully prepared and fresh.  Our waitress was kind and attentive.  We will be back."}
{"text":"They always treat mom's so well here on Mothers Day-they top off your meal with a large chocolate dipped strawberry. 

Delish entree's  from  crab eggs Benedict to sushi grade tuna and salads. 

Full bar and great drink specials. 

Parking lot, casual dress, entrees from $10-30."}
{"text":"McCormick & Schmick's happy hour is to die for! Every wednesday for their $1 oysters and shrimp. Their normal happy hour is perfect with items ranging from NY beef carpaccio, their McCormick cheeseburger, calamari, firecracker shrimp, and so much more for the best prices imaginable! The service kind of is slow in the bar area for happy hour because they're understaffed and the waitresses are always under a lot of stress. This is definitely mine and the hubby's happy hour and seafood spot."}
{"text":"Came for HH with the Yelpizzles- Andy T, Elnino F., Sun, Jieun L, Lily D. 

Drink- I just got a watermelon daquiri....it didn't taste like watermelon to me. It was good, but it reminded me more of a Asian fruit called calamansi. 

Food- 
Blackend Fish taco- it was more grilled and lacking the blackening spice....and salt....it was still good and fresh fish, but people need to season. 
Salmon Satay- good, but needed some lemon (a tad fishy) and some salt (do people not season anymore?). It was properly cooked though and juicy. 
Oysters- came with 3...sounded like they were using Barcat. Very fresh and kinda sweet. 

Escargot w/ bread (not from the HH menu)-  nice, but it said it has porcini mushroom truffle oil and all I tasted was garlic in the oil. FIne and all since I love garlic, but the bread was garlic bread as well so most people would be overwhelmed. It was perfectly cooked though. 

The menu changes a few items every now and then so the online menu is not quite accurate. I was looking forward to curry mussels but they weren't on there. It's not bad for HH, I think just sometimes it's better than others since the last menu sounded a lot better to me than the current one."}
{"text":"Happy hour menu is good. Prices make up for terrible service. Slow. Never clearing table. Amateur hour."}
{"text":"Had dinner on Sunday, the food was exceptional. The service was great. (Kudos to Thomas) our server. Will be back."}
{"text":"Can see why this restaurant received the stars from other patrons. Although the food was good, it is overpriced for the area. Along with it being overpriced (and mostly every other restaurant in this area does this), you have to pay for parking.. Which is not covered by the restaurant. If my husband and I are spending at least 85 dollars without alcohol.. $3 parking should be covered. Would also have appreciated not being solicited to buy into their rewards card... Too nice of a place to be in this area and trying to get people to sign up for a random card for points. I got the ribeye which was good, a little over cooked. My husband got the Mahi-Mahi, also good.. Very mild if that is what you like for fish. Perhaps my expectations are too high, but you don't feel like you're being treated as if you're spending a large amount of money."}
{"text":"Honestly food was good but not great. We went with a huge group and the service was on point. They catered to our every need and they were so friendly and helpful. They refilled our drinks before they were done and salads were amazing. Salad was good and desert was really good. It's sad that the staff was so amazing and the main course was not.  I ordered the surf and turf and I wanted it Medium rare but they said with the group we had 25+ that all would be cooked Medium. Everyone's food was undercooked, even the guests that had chicken. I'm glad I didn't get medium rare because if the raw steak I was eating was medium then the medium rare must've been a live cow. The flavor was there and it's too bad the cooks didn't check the steaks before they were sent out. It had plenty of time to set because when I got it, it was luke warm, so not sure if they just seared it for 2 mins on each side or what but with that being said I wouldn't spend my own money here."}
{"text":"Great happy hour place! The happy hour menu appetizer's are really good.. You can order the Burger for $3 for the corn beed slider which are to die for for $4.. This is definitely on my top happy hour list.. Great place to relax after work and talk with friends or colleagues.. Their service is a bit slow but what do you expect for the price.. I still think it's a great bargain just dont expect to get your food fast.. Just sit back relax and enjoy and have a good time at McCormick's.. I must admit I was a little turned off with the Staff talking about their personal life behind the bar area.. but i just chose to ignore it because, because like i said.. can't beat the price and the place.."}
{"text":"The sign said they had the best happy hopper in the USA and I thought it was hyperbole BUT OMG r carpaccio and the mussels rated a 10/10 from us and we're serious foodies on the road. The vibe on the patio on Tryon Street was perfect and the service was superb. I'll make this my go to happy hour in Charlotte (and maybe I'll look for more as we drive south)"}
{"text":"I know McCormicks and Schmicks is a chain of seafood restaurants.  I know that I shouldn't have high expectations for a chain restaurant.  Yadda, Yadda, Yadda!  However, any restaurant that offers food at certain higher price points should deliver food that taste better their fast food/casual dining counterparts.  Thus, my dilemma after a recent visit to McCormicks and Schmicks .

This wasn't my first time at the rodeo.  Generally speaking, I love all things seafood.  (Sea squirts and things of that ilk, I'll leave to Andrew Zimmern)  But shrimp, crab, lobster and catfish are some of my personal faves.  I know that this sounds greedy for just three people, but we ordered the Shrimp Kisses, Coconut Shrimp, Fried Stuffed Mushrooms appetizers; Buttermilk Fried Shrimp, Cashew Crusted Tilapia with Jamaican Rum Butter and Shrimp and Andouille \"Mac & Cheese\" for entrees on this particular occasion.  The Shrimp Kisses and Fried Stuffed Mushrooms were tasty.  However, the Coconut Shrimp and Buttermilk Fried Shrimp had batters that were too heavy and somewhat rubbery.  During other visits, the Buttermilk Fried Shrimp had a much lighter crust.  Who knows what was going on in the kitchen that day? 
 
I say this because my daughter Muff ordered the Shrimp and Andouille \"Mac & Cheese\" for an entr√©e and it was served sans the shrimp and Andouille sausage.  Once we pointed this out to our server, she said that that was kid's Mac & Cheese and a kid received the Shrimp and Andouille \"Mac & Cheese\".  The Cashew Crusted Tilapia with Jamaican Rum Butter was also tasty.  Our server also vacillated between being very attentive and missing in action...

Okay...   So, I don't know if this was an off day or what... But inconsistent food quality, inconsistent service, inconsistent food preparation can kill a restaurant.  All of the McCormicks and Schmicks that I have been to have had a nice \"clubby\" feel and that's perfectly fine.  But, the food and service really need to be tightened up a little and the menu should probably be updated.

Better quality everything should be expected at the prices that they charge.  All I could think about was Donna Summer's \"She Works Hard For the Money\" lyric that says \"So you better treat her right!\".  I didn't get \"right\" treatment and I work hard for my money!."}
{"text":"Had the pleasure of being there on a Wed happy hour. 1$ oyster and shrimp, the food was amazing. they were very fast and their wait staff were excellent!"}
{"text":"Meh.  I had such high hopes.  This was my first time ever going to this place.  Such a beautiful let down......

Service - A++  Hostess was really nice.  I made reservations for 10 and they seated us right away.  Took drink orders promptly.  No complaints in the service department.

Food - D  Meh.  I ordered fish tacos.  I knew I shouldn't have ordered them.  But I figured \"how bad could it be??\"  Since I was with a bunch of executives and the ONLY female present, I didn't want to special order my food or make changes.  I just ordered it as is ....which I never do.  Fish tacos came out cold...over FRIED (fried...why oh why must thy fry??) and just bland. I have no idea what kind of fish they used either for the fish tacos.  And they put them on flour tortillas.  The beans on the side were yummy though!  :-)

Overall I am not ready to write this place off just yet.  Maybe I'll try a different lunch dish and also go back for dinner one night.  I adore seafood and was sad that my lunch wasn't the best. :)"}
{"text":"The prices were pretty high and I would have hoped for great food and service.  There were not  many people in the restaurant but it took almost an hour for the food to come.  I got the Sea Bass and it was dried out and fishy tasting.  Some other people in my party ordered steaks and reported that their dinners were pretty average.  Overall an expensive disappointment"}
{"text":"Decent food, slowwwww service. Arrived before 6, left at 7:50. Were almost late to our 8pm Symphony Concert. Waiter also misplaced my credit card for about 5 minutes when taking our check, then took 10 minutes to bring the check back."}
{"text":"Can't beat the happy hour during the week, and happy hour food prices at the bar all day Sunday!"}
{"text":"Very good food and excellent service.....You pay for what you get and that said the extra is soooo worth it."}
{"text":"Classic flair and awesome happy hour. If your lioking for great food and a great vibe then this is thee place. The drinks are great and can be customized. My favorite is the sea food spins. You get great bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Actually 3.5 stars...4 stars if certain portions just slightly larger.
Great start with a very fresh and well done calamari dish - the surprise ingredient- peppers. It works!
We had Cashew Crusted Tilapia and a Perfect Combination [my combo:Crab Cake - Ahi Tuna]
The tilapia was fresh and tasty. The crab cake was good, but smallish. The first piece of tuna was over cooked, but the waiter quickly replaced it with one that was perfectly seared and was excellent.  The tuna portion was also a little on the small side. However $22 for a crab cake and a piece of Ahi tuna is reasonable. Butternut Squash Orzo was a welcome side to the perfect combination.
Maybe my 3 star review is a reaction to the presentation of the food. Crab cake/Tuna/Orzo/Veggies did not 'fill' plate, no garnish...seemed empty. Four parts floating on white porcelain rather than connected and presented as a whole-

Have eaten at many M&S in many cities through business trips and the food is consistently well prepared. No different here on the South Side."}
{"text":"How would I describe my wife's b-day dinner at McCormick & Schmicks. The memory of the evening conjures words like lackluster, uninspiring, and maybe disappointing. I mean, we love seafood...finding a place with a good menu, wine list, and quiet atmosphere is a task I take seriously. 

We walk in; the place is practically empty at 7:30pm. The dirty green carpet and fingerprint laden brass pillars weren't the most confidence inspiring visuals. 

We are then seated and given menus with a kind of greasy film on them. Seriously? The menu looked fantastic online and in person it was identical. So y'know, at least the food will be good...I can overlook the place not being spic & span to a point. 

We order Calamari to start, the Crab Mango Stack and some wine. I've had much better Calamari (Roy's is the best in town) and the Crab Mango Stack was ok. I got the \"new surf & turf\" while the wife had the shrimp trifecta.

My short rib was fatty and not really all that hot, the 3 tiny scallops were ok. My wife's shrimp resembled an appetizer. The part that really annoyed me was that our meals came with either garlic mashed potatoes or regular mashed potatoes. Keeping the high glycemic  index in mind, we asked for some kind of vegetable replacement. The server was annoyed...it was written all over his face. The 5 green beans were great...thanks big guy.

Overall we were unimpressed...y'know what, we were dissapointed. The $100 check was painful and I felt that I had failed as a husband. I'll pay for a good experience, this didn't qualify. 

Beyond that, it was a lovely night. *rolling my eyes*"}
{"text":"When I walked in, they looked at me like I was supposed to come in the back door. Granted I was not wearing a suit and tie but I wasn't a bum either.

Finally I told them I was there for dinner ....

They seated me .. turned their back ... extended the menu to me and appeared annoyed that I hadn't picked up that It was meant for me .......

I sat there for a minute digesting the experience and deiced I would go around the corner to my original destination of choice - Moreton's. Boy am I glad I did!!!

I give them a 2 on how I was initially treated ..... the food may be OUTSTANDING - but I will never know. There are far too many options in downtown Charlotte.

Hopefully you will be treated better.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 
because of my commentary on here I received several contacts from managers and restaurant administrators. I could not have been listened to more intently and with concern ............... Wow! I was impressed and will let you know of my next visits here .......... after the calls I received - I have to go back, again.
UPDATE Jan 2015"}
{"text":"McCormick & Schmicks is a great spot for a happy hour but definitely not my top spot for steak or seafood in the area. They have a great $1 oyster special on Wednesdays and their entire happy hour menu is very good. They have great specials and they are served throughout the entire bar area. When I went for dinner instead of just Happy Hour I was disappointed as to how loud the dining area was. The service was mediocre and truly did not think the food was any better than what they were currently serving at the bar. 

I highly recommend McCormick & Schmicks for happy hour, especially on Wednesdays. Besides that there are better options for seafood and steak throughout the city."}
{"text":"Met a couple friends here the other day for lunch with my 10 year old. The hostess was friendly, seating us while we waited for our friends. The restaurant has a very warm and welcoming ambiance...obviously well kept. Our drink orders were quickly taken, and good service continued when our friends arrived. Our food came out quickly and was very well presented. My son ordered the large filet mignon, and devoured it. I had the salmon with a red berry compote and it was delicious. Our guests were equally pleased with their meals. Throughout the service was attentive without intruding. An excellent example of how to do restaurant service and food prep the right way, resulting in 4 happy customers, who will certainly return! Well done!"}
{"text":"While visiting Charlotte on a business trip, an old friend of mine who lives in the area wanted to meet up for dinner and catch up on old times.  We talked about a number of places to meet and and she suggested McCormick.  I agreed because I have always wanted to try out one and see if they are as good as I hear.  I expected it to be a bit on the pricy side (which it was) but for the price, it should be really good food (which is was not).  

I arrived around 6:30 pm on a rainy Saturday afternoon.  The restaurant was not packed and was about half full.  The two greeters were busy talking to each other so I never got any hello, welcome, or acknowledgement that I walked in the door.  I met my friend at the bar and we both had a drink.  The bartenders were nice and one even complimented me on my mustache.  When I asked what bourbon they had, the younger bartender named a few but could not remember more than 3 or 4 of them.  I did see them all listed in the menu later on while ordering dinner and they had about 20 brands.   My friend had wine and I ordered a Manhattan.  They can't really mess up wine but my Manhattan was okay but was shaken, not stirred... Plus they used basic maraschino cherries... Yuck. 

We finished our drinks, paid our bar bill and then were taken to a table for dinner.  I have to say our server was very nice and he was a delight.  After some good small talk, we decided to order another round of drinks.   We decided to only have entrees so our server took our order and said bread would be right out.  Now lucky for us, we were not in a rush... It took a bit for the cocktails to arrive (again, wine was wine and hard to mess up but my Manhattan was only about 2/3rds full... Did they spill some along the way?  It was not a full drink like I had sitting at the bar.  The bread finally made it to the table but that was a full 20 min after our server left.   Our food arrived  and I had the Hawaiian Swordfish with mashed potatoes and spinach.  All I can say was that everything looked dried out.  The Swordfish was overcooked and a bit dry.  The spinach and potatoes were just okay.  Not what I expected from the hype of this place.  I realized then just how much of a chain restaurant this place was.  My dinner partner had ordered a steak, mashed potatoes and a side of asparagus instead of the tomato which she does not like. They brought the tomatoes instead of the asparagus.  She told the server about the mistake and our server did bring out asparagus right away. 

We did eat our meals and continued to catch up on our lives but decided that dessert would not be happening. 

Atmosphere = 8

Service = 8

Food = 5

I was not impressed with the food here.  The place is decorated very nicely and except for the two greeters, everyone else was friendly and helpful.  I wish I could give them more stars but I have gotten better meals for less money.  I am not sure I can recommend this particular McCormick... Hopefully other locations are better."}
{"text":"Not as good as I had hoped.  I just pictured something way better for the price.  I had the overpriced oysters, which were average.  I also went for Thanksgiving dinner, and it was ok, just wouldn't spend the money there again.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Great venue, very warm and welcoming. I would advise anyone local or otherwise to make this a food destination for quality food and service."}
{"text":"Went last night for the first time, for restaurant week. The food was phenomenal, and service was great. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I want to thank M & S for taking care of the Vets on May 29th.17. Last Year I ordered the fried shrimp which were excellent. This year I ordered them again and they were excellent. However the size of the shrimp and portion size shrunk a lot. For free it is good, but was certainly not worth the $21. cost you put on the entree.My friend ordered the military salmon, and that too was very small.  The other dishes that our guests ordered were good, but quite pricy.   Service was not up to  M&S standards.  My friend ordered a salad, and it came after the delivery of the main course.  But again thanks for being kind to vets."}
{"text":"We ordered almond trout, lobster with steak and a strawberry cocktail. Everything was great except for the steak. The steak was very dry and not juicy at all. I asked the waitress and she said the steak is not high quality steak when serving with lobster."}
{"text":"Been here before, always sat in the bar and while this place has a solid reputation, and an affordably priced happy hour, the service was lacking, though it seemed like it wasn't the fault of the servers, just the poor oversight in staffing levels appropriate for the dinner hour. I tried to flag folks down, they avoided eye contact as they buzzed in and out of the kitchen a from behind the bar. I asked a server for the wifi password, he said, \"Sorry, I don't know it,\" and walked away. I actually had to call him back and ask him to track it down for me. My food arrived quickly, (cashew crusted tilapia with no visible cashew coating) and the green beans and couscous were barely warm, luckily the fish was hot. I think there are far better places to try than McCormick and Schmick's."}
{"text":"My husband and I have had mixed feelings in the past but decided to give it another chance. We were disappointed again. We sat in the bar and ordered drinks from a very nice server. We ordered an appetizer a bruschetta with veg and shrimp that was good. We had high expectations after that. I ordered the  cashew tilapia, which used to be pecan tilapia, and it was not as tasty as the pecan, but ok. My husband ordered  the fish stew and was surprised when it arrived. The waitress told us it came with a lobster tail on the top. Well it wasn't a stew at all and contained a few small shrimp, a few clams, muscles a tiny cob of corn mostly potatoes and to top it off the lobster was thermidor all mushy and unappetizing. . For $ 28.00 into even close to a value. Because our waitress disappeared,my husband flagged down the manager. She apologized and stated that was the recipe sent by corporate! They need to rethink that dish,as it is awful. They also need to bring back pecan tilapia and forget the cashew  coating not as tasty. It has such a nice atmosphere, but I can see why it is not crowded like the other restaurants we visited prior. The manager did take it off the bill, but by then our dinner was a disappointment. We eat out often and won't go there again. Come on corporate! There are so many delicious recipes, get out the cookbook!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. 

Don't get me wrong, their happy hour is amazing and should have its own review space. But their dinner is something else. 

I ordered their ahi tuna and I can say that I've had better ahi at dive/corner Chinese/sushi restaurants. I wish I could say I'm exaggerating but I'm not. It was just ok, nothing good, nothing great, and definitely not worth the price point at all. Overall, the sushi grade ahi was disappointing. 

My boyfriend ordered the salmon and he also said that he had had better at different restaurants across Charlotte. After tasting it, it was clear it was was frozen previously and just not a \"fresh\" piece of fish. 

Overall, you can get a better fish meal at different restaurant across the city than here. It's an expensive price point for mediocre food."}
{"text":"This was one of the worst experiences I've had at an restaurant of this statue. First of all the we booked an online reservation for 10pm apparently that was the only time they had available so we took it. We decided to take in a movie near by to past the time. While in the movie we received a call from the restaurant asking us to come in early because they close the doors at 10. So we got to the restaurant about 10 til. Got seated and waited for another 15min to even get approached by a waiter. We gave our order and continued to wait finally our entree came out and we realized we hadn't even received our appetizers yet. The entrees were dry and over cooked. I'd like to think that this is not the typical experience and I'll chalk this up to it being restaurant week and may they were just really busy but I won't be visiting this location anymore."}
{"text":"I came here with my mom for Mother's Day and we loved the food! The service was also pretty good...Jameson was awesome and friendly! We had the dip with pita chips...yum...as well as the Mahi Mahi, the scallops, shrimp, and salmon sampler meal and the fish and chips. For fish and chips, they were pretty standard and I would not recommend them. Everything else was perfectly seasoned and cooked. It was a lovely evening treating my mommy :)"}
{"text":"My wife and I dined at the Pittsburgh, PA Southside location for our second wedding anniversary. We had a reservation for 8:30 on Saturday, and showed up around 8:15. We had to push through a very heavy revolving door, and walked up to the greeter. She told us that our table would be ready right at 8:30, so we went to the bar to have a drink while we waited. We found two seats at the bar. The bar top was dirty, with a wet menu and the ticket from a previous guest at our seats. There were two bartenders, a male and a female, arguing over something. No one greeted us. Behind the bar, there were soiled glasses, utensils, and rags all over the place. Servers were frantically coming up to the bar to get drink orders while the bar tenders ran around and yelled. It was very tense. After 5 minutes, the bartender took my drink order of a Sam Adams. My wife asked what kind of wine she had, and the bartender grabbed the wet menu and flipped it over and gave it to her. When my beer arrived, the hostess came to take us to our table. I told her that I hadn't paid for my beer yet, nor had my wife ordered her wine. She said that it would be fine, and that she'd transfer the beer to our dinner check. When we were seated, a frantic male server came to ask my wife if she wanted something to drink. She ordered a glass of wine. He asked me if I had paid for my beer, and I explained what the hostess told me. He said it would be a few minutes for the wine, as he had to go to the bar to get it. I told him what a bad experience we had at the bar, to which he apologized. He came back moments later with the wine. He explained the menu, but never offered his name. We ordered appetizers and dinner as we enjoyed the bread and our drinks. Throughout most of our dinner, he was standing at the table next to us talking to another customer about his other job as an IT person, and about a business that he owned on the side. He only came back to us once ask if we needed more drinks and to inquire about our food. We still never got his name. My wife's dinner came with creme brulee, and she inquired if she could substitute for anything else. He told her no, and did not offer me any dessert options. He brought out the creme brulee and the check, and continued to talk to the guest next to us. At one point, one of the 4 hostesses came out to clear some tables as she ate a muffin. We paid and left. We asked if they validated parking, to which a hostess said \"nope\". One hostess said \"thanks\" as we were walking out the door. 

The food was great. The service left much to be desired."}
{"text":"Their dinner menu is good, but for someone like myself I am always left a little hungry. Which probably just means I ate as much as I need. But the quality of the food is superb.

Their happy hour menu is good as well. A half pound cheeseburger and fries for some $4? That's a hell of a deal. However, there is no discount on draught's and that is kinda lame."}
{"text":"Loved it!! They have Valet parking, too. We didnt realize that till we parked. Ok, The place is very pretty, almost old school glamorous, almost! We were seated in a booth and our waitress  Parrish, I believe greeted us immediately and took our drink order. Frank didnt want apps, but I always do. So, I ordered the Arugula Strawberry Salad that had radishes, candied slivered almonds with a Honey Lemon Vinaigrette, delicious. They used baby Arugula and its strawberry Season, so they were sweet and delicious and played off nicely with my peppery arugula. I then ordered The Stuffed Shrimp with Crab meat with a Red Pepper White Cheddar Mash and Mixed Vegetables. I swapped out the mixed for some Sauteed Spinach, like I've never had. Im so mad I didn't ask how it was made. It was simply made but had such flavor, I guessing there was garlic, shallots, and wine in it, not sure.  Anyway, my shrimp were nicely stuffed with sweet crab and they were drizzled with a lemon butter sauce, I believe. I was very happy with my dish.  Frank Had the Palm Beach Mahi Grilled with Crab Potato Hash and a sweet Corn Bisque, although I dont remember the bisque, now that I think of it. Hmmmm......   Any, his fish was fresh and delicious and it sat atop the Crab potato hash, so good. We had the Walnut Apple Crumble with Cinnamon ice cream and split it. Enough for two. That was the perfect ending to this perfect meal. I'd definite;y go again. I dont know why they dont have more stars. I think you're nuts if you dont enjoy this place.Im a complainer, trust me and I was happy from start to finish her.  Btw, as I left, I saw someone's plate with the Halibut on top of rep pepper Risotto, OMG it looked so good, I wanted to go back in and eat again.  Ill be back, tho and I'm getting the Halibut."}
{"text":"I've been going to McCormick and Schmick for almost a decade now and have never once ordered from the main menu.  I have always visited after work during happy hour.  The HH menu contains a 1.95 burger that is one of the best burgers in the city, plus other tasty treats."}
{"text":"Had dry rub ribeye and swear there was no rub on the steak, had to ask for A1.  Not sure if it was a ribeye, tasted like sirloin.  Chopped salad was good.  My wife had shrimp cocktail and stuffed salmon, both she said were very good."}
{"text":"A solid choice for a business lunch (but call ahead! the lawyers in the area have found out about this place). 

The food isn't what I'd call exciting, but it's incredibly reliable. The almond crusted trout is amazing ! I also love the warm bread that comes prior to the meal. They are pretty cool about customization, too, which is nice. The fresh list is awesome."}
{"text":"My hubby and I just had a wonderful evening here.  We came for Happy Hour and certainly left happy.  
We enjoyed the kale salad from the regular menu then from the happy hour menu, tuna flatbread, mussels and mushroom bruschetta, they were all delicious.  
We sat at the bar and were entertained watching the 2 bartenders work together and managing a big crowd.  They did an outstanding job.  
The food is fresh, top quality and well prepared.  The drinks were a great value and the service was outstanding.  
The only weak item was the walnut crust apple pie, very sweet, too much caramel sauce."}
{"text":"The food, service and atmosphere was exceptional.  I had the Mahi Mahi and it was well prepared, fresh and very tasty.  I have special dietary needs and found them to be very accommodating to my needs and I was able to substitute sides etc.."}
{"text":"Great food! Best Happy hour in Vegas. Only place that has happy hour from 5-9 on a Sunday. Haven't had a bad meal here yet. Be sure to tell Nicole hi at the bar!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and mediocre...
Our server was very nice and quite funny and the food that we had was pretty good just not worth the price tag. I got the bone in ribeye medium, the steak came out a little undercooked but was still pretty good. I Just thought a $50 steak would be prepared better and have a little more flavor. The real kicker for me was the sides though.  Their selection is limited, and extremely expensive for what you get.  I ordered saut√©ed mushrooms which were nine dollars, The portion that I was served was a joke.  You would think that if they are charging nine dollars for just mushrooms they would give you a substantial portion, this wasn't the case.  Bottom line, I wasn't impressed and there is a lot of other great steak houses in Charlotte I would visit before M&S.  My wife and I spent $150 on dinner and drinks and left a little hungry and disappointed...."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour with my boyfriend last week. I was excited because we had these dining certificates from the San Francisco restaurant which were $20 each as well as a $50 gift card. Called and asked first to see if they would honor the certificates at happy hour and the guy Rick on the phone said ya as long as their not expired. So that's why we came in. When we got there asked again about the certificates and they said they would check on it. When he came back he said that they can't honor them because it looks like it's been expired for a while. He said 2010. Well I wouldn't have came if I saw that. The vouchers looked like they were white out the expiration cause he has to scratch it. I was given them like that with the managers signature in the voucher. I wouldn't have tried to used them if I saw there was an expiration. Only reason they are getting a 3 star is because the waitress Kendra was great and the food was good. Other than that this is Las Vegas. They should have tried to at least honor one of the vouchers for their terrible communication between establishments.

Anyways, my boyfriend and I ordered: Happy hour classic mushrooms, happy hour fish tacos, happy hour chicken quesadilla, happy hour tuna poke, 2 blue point oysters, 2 fanny bay oysters, 2 kumiai oysters, and 2 malpaque oysters. As well as couple drinks. All the happy hour choices were delicious. All good portions for sharing. Got a little filled up because they gave you sourdough bread as you're waiting. My favorite oysters were the blue point and fanny bay. Liked them because they didn't leave fishy taste at all. The fish taco tho was amazing. The fish was nice and crisp when you bit in. The toppings on it as well complimented it so well. I don't like quesadillas that much but that one was also good. The tuna poke was great too. The sauce they put on it and the warm rice underneath made its melt in your mouth. 

Great place to eat. Server was great. Would be a good place if you don't have to run into problems like I had. Happy hour definitely a good spot to go to here."}
{"text":"In one word - meh. 

I went here with some coworkers recently and looked on Yelp (of course) prior to going. I was originally going to order the stuffed shrimp but the pictures I saw showed only 5 shrimp come with the meal! I wasn't about that so I decided to try something else. 

I started with a Caesar salad. I love Caesar salads. In fact, I'd say they are my favorite salads. This one was just ok. There was still a lot of water on the lettuce so the dressings kind of slid off. For my meal, I did the blackened chicken pasta. The sauce was good and the mushrooms were delicious. The downside was the chicken- there was very little of it. 

This place wasn't horrible. It also wasn't great and for the price, I'd rather go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Great food, great ambience, excellent service. Once of my favorite restaurants"}
{"text":"GET the SHRIMP kisses. Amazing. Be sure Matt is your server. He's amazing."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and food. The dessert was by far one of the best that I've ever had. It was a brown bag made of chocolate filled with mousse and berries. It was to die for. Their Lobster Mashed Potatoes were also fantastic."}
{"text":"This location of M&S is awesome. Their fish is excellent, appetizers awesome and drinks perfect. Service is A-1 as well!!!
I've been to multiple other M&S locations around the country and I wouldn't give any of them more then 2 1/2 stars, but this location is the exception."}
{"text":"This was Mother's Day Brunch. The website said they have complimentary valet, but there was none. I had to park 4 blocks away. We were never offered any bread. The adults drinks barely arrived before the meal, and the kids drink wasn't delivered until after the meal was. The crab cakes on the Benedict were smaller than the eggs, and tasted too fishy. One egg was over cooked and hard while the other was running before it got to the table. I let the server know and he did not address it. There was barely any hollandaise sauce. The biscuits and gravy were cold. The kid's scrambled eggs were overcooked. We had to request jelly for the toast, all the had was marmalade. It took forever for anyone to check on us. Our waters were never refilled. We let our server know of our dissatisfaction and then had to asks for the manager. The manager did comp our entree to her credit. We overheard several other tables complaining about lots of issues too. M&S completely dropped the ball on Mother's Day Brunch. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Chain restaurant that's A-OK. I love how they customize the menu if you let them know you're celebrating a special occasion. Service is always great.

Moderately priced seafood and steaks - that's what they're known for. We normally come here for business meetings. I like their calamari, lobster bisque, salmon (roasted or grilled)...or steak and lobster. Tasty!

I've been meaning to try their strawberry mango Panna cotta but for some reason, I always end up getting creme br√ªl√©e. Fail!"}
{"text":"Visited McCormick & Schmick's in Charlotte Friday12/22/17 and was totally disappointed in my lunch entree, the Lobster Cobb Salad.  The lobster topping for my salad and my guests was extremely skimpy.  It was certainly not worth the  $22 they charged per salad.  I suggest if you are looking for lobster salad, try the Capital Grill, they give you your money's worth."}
{"text":"This was our first stop for January 2018 Restaurant week.  Honestly - it has been my worst stop in many years of eating out (for restaurant week and not).  

We had lunch time reservations (12:30p).  We had to inquire - twice to get restaurant week menus. Two of us got restaurant week 2 of us did not.

My starter was Maryland Crab soup - described as a crab vegetable soup.  This should just be described as a hearty vegetable soup.  There was no crab.  Crab shouldn't even be in the name.  The spinach salad is incredibly over-dressed.

Once our entree's came we knew this was just going to be a not so hot meal.  All of our food was cold.  I'd requested my salmon rare - it was med-well.  Mashed potatoes - cold.  One of the ladies got a salad - which should be cold - but have you ever experienced when you have cut up tomatoes and then they sit for a couple days so they are a pile of mush.  Yeah - it was gross.  

Our waiter was not good.  He interjected into our conversations when he happened to come to the table while we were in conversation.  He blamed a mix up on our bills on a trainee.  He spoke to us like we were country bumpkin coming into the \"big city\" for lunch.  

All around this meal was not good.  The service, the food, everything.  If you are going out for restaurant week - don't waste your time here.   Buyer beware."}

{"text":"Slight mishap with being given salmon when swordfish was ordered but quickly fixed, very pleasant server, everything was fresh, food delivered timely and at a non rushed pace. Overall another very good experience."}
{"text":"The wait staff is very friendly. Careful sitting in some of the booths, they are small. The Chilled Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail is a must order appetizer. Also, the Raspberry Mule was delicious too. 

The ambiance is a little strange. The music playing was early 2000's emo music. I didnt mind it but it didnt mesh with the vibe of the restaurant. 

Overall it was a pleasant experience."}
{"text":"Had a lovely dinner there last night with my husbands work, it was sponsored by a medical supplier. The food was amazing, but I was so impressed with the positivity of the two servers taking care of us! Nicole and the other woman were fantastic! Got us anything we wanted and needed! Plus they were so friendly and sweet with our babies!"}
{"text":"I love Seafood, and I want to love M&S, but it's just not right. The prices are \"steakhouse\", but the quality is Red Lobster. Others seem to agree: it was basically empty on Friday night at 7pm.

We really wanted to order combos (me: fish+shellfish, him: fish+steak), but none of the options had what we wanted so we stuck with just fish.

I had a pan seared halibut with lobster mashed potatoes. The fish was just ok. The mashed potatoes were ok, and then they poured this super salty gravy over it with the lobster. Disappointing for the most expensive fish and side dish on the menu.

My husband had the wagoo special with andouille sausage mashed potatoes. His fish was just ok too. I didn't try the meat potatoes.

The cocktails we tried (one was some type of mule) were better than average, and when we asked for one of them to be modified on the second round, the bar did a nice job with the request. 

The service was good although our server didn't always have answers for many of the questions we asked, and she was a bit over the top happy. It was an \"honor\" to get us more napkins? Uh. She admitted that it was her 2nd or 3rd day, but she was unaccompanied, and I never saw her interact with a trainer or supervisor."}
{"text":"Ran into McCormick's today for lunch - probably the 20th McCormick's I've been to in the US. I'd have to say it was a typical McCormick's lunch experience - great service, good to great food at very reasonable prices given both the quality of food and service/experience. 

Here's the lowdown on the grub:
-calamari - somewhere between good to great
-Walleye (on the lunch menu) - pretty good
-Trout (on the dinner menu) - exceptional
-Filet - pretty good for a seafood joint
-Apple Cobbler Dessert - only place in the world I eat Cobbler b/c it's really good here

As usual, I recommend McCormick's for lunch 4 star, really recommend their happy hour (5 star) and would pass as a dinner choice (3 star)."}
{"text":"McCormick & Schmick's is a fancy pants place.  Actually, they are not that bad.  I went last week, on a Friday, and it was kind of empty.  This is odd for Charlotte as places like these are usually always crowded in the area.  I guess the downturn in the economy has finally hit home.

Atmosphere - Lots of stain glass, the color green and wood.  Usually a bustling place but this Friday night at 7 PM, it was fairly dead.

Service - Like in most places of this caliber, our server was professional and knew how to properly serve.  This was made evident when he addressed and corrected an issue the way it should be, fast.

Food - Started w/ the House salad (mixed greens, candied pecans, blue cheese and citrus vinaigrette).  It was good and simple w/ fresh greens.  The main dish was a little disappointing.  I hand the Flounder encrusted w/ parmesan cheese.  It had more cheese than flounder and that is why I was disappointed.  At $20, you expect the fish to be better than paper thin.  I guess I will attribute it to cutbacks in the economy.  For dessert I had the Upside Down Apple Pie.  A dish I first had in Berkley, CA at one of M&S's sister restaurants, Spenger's Fresh Fish Grotto (see: http://www.yelp.com/bi...).  Unfortunately, the first time it came out this night I thought the cinnamon sugar topping was a little on the burnt side.  My g/f thought it was edible.  I scrapped it off and continued on.  When server came out to check on us and get the check, I slightly winced and mention my displeasure w/ the dessert.  He looked at it and said \"I will be right back\".  He came out w/ another one that was far better and tastier than the first.  He apologized for what had happened and asked if there was anything else he could do.  This impressed as I did not complain much and did not ask for it to be replaced.  This is why you pay more at these places, service.

Overall - Our waiter turned a negative into a positive.  This definitely will have me coming back for more at M&S."}
{"text":"The service was great, the food was great, AND when i forgot my receipt for an expense report they had it emailed to me!"}
{"text":"Didja ever have a restaurant open up right near where you work and you keep saying \"I need to go there!\" and yet you never do and then it's like two years later and you finally go and you're like \"Dang, I shoulda been coming here way more often!\"?  Well that's McCormick and Scmick for me.

Here's the good stuff:

My wife and I had the occasion to have a special night out to celebrate our birthdays (they are very closer together).  She decided that we would go to M & S as a treat.  

The atmosphere is warm and inviting with deep wood finishes, comfy seats and very nice decor.

We were greeted immediately and taken to our table. So no trip to the bar area.  Our waitress was extremely helpful with her knowledge of the menu (which is printed twice a day as the choice of fresh fish and seafood changes!)  We decided to begin with the Rare Ahi Tuna for me and the Maryland Crabcake for the Mrs..  The rare Ahi was ridiculous!  I about lost my mind.  Just a hint of searing and a bright rare center, with a little bit of peppery char on the outside, I could not have been happier.  The crabcake was excelent: crispy outside, full of lump crab, it was one of the best I have ever tasted.

For din-din, I ordered the broiled plate (scallops, shrimp, baked oysters, and salmon with a bourbon/maple glaze) and Tara got the Wild Salmon with Shrimp, Crab and Brie stuffing.  Two words: SHUT UP!  They both had side items that were standard, but we both chose to change to the mashed taters with a lobster gravy and briased spinach.  Three words: SHUT UP MORE!  I have never in my life been quite so pleased with an entire meal.  I have also never eaten shrimp so well prepared (It was NUTS!).  The hardest part of the meal was to pace myself and not just gobble everything in sight. 

For dessert, my wife went with the white cake with strawberry filling and I got more food (Buffalo fried gulf shrimp) and they were both yummy.  

I have neither the stamina or time to explain how great this meal was.  Suffice to say that this will become a stop for us as a special occasion restaurant as well as a place to bring out of town guests.  For our budget, it was a little hefty, but worth every single penny spent.

EAT WELL!

{"text":"We went for my cousin's birthday and Charlotte Restaurant Week... The rest of the party was late, so we hit the bar... I loved my Talk of the Town drink and it was on special, so that was fabulous... The bartender Michael was quick and pleasant...  The rest of our service was kind of spotty... Our server was quick with getting drink orders and bringing bread, but took FOREVER to actually bring the check... She took even longer to come back to pick it up and run the card... That part was the worst... The food itself was interesting... We all got the beef medallions, but the results were incredibly varied... They were presliced as well, which wasn't a problem since it let you see the doneness... I ordered mine medium well and some pieces were closer to medium, while the others were a mix of medium well and well done...  The portions were a bit small... I normally never finish a restaurant meal because they're too big and I cleaned my plate... lol  Overall, it was decent, but it could have been better with a more evenly cooked entree and faster table service..."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to eat here for over seven years now & i have finally tried. Do I love it! Sure, I do! Is it one of my favorites? Not too sure, yet. lol.

The service was absolutely amazing, our server was hysterical & had some good punch lines.  Sometimes, he'd forget to refill our drinks like he said he would, but no biggie.  

The food was yummy.  I believed i ordered the Filet & Stuffed Shrimp with Steamed Vegetables ($38.95).  The filet was a bit overcooked for me, but it was very flavorful.  The stuffed shrimp, it was mmmh mmm mmmh! It is something everyone should try!

We didnt order any dessert because Brad T. wasnt feeling so well. (Oh, boy).  Overall, the decorations and atmosphere was great.  Each had a private section kind of old school feel but modern."}
{"text":"McCormick & Schmick's has a great food happy hour. Monday-Friday from 3:00-6:30 they run a $3.95 hamburger, $4.95 fish tacos, $5.95 calamari. These dishes are only the tip of the iceberg. The food is inexpensive and most of the items are decent to rather delicious. My favorite would be the calamari. Certain beers on draft run around $4 and so do the well drinks."}
{"text":"Valentine's family lunch was divine.  The food was a great quality and interesting.  The server was sufficient, but not well trained, perhaps new to the job.  The atmosphere is inviting and relaxing.  The price points were surprisingly good for the quality of food.  We will definitely be back and back and back..."}
{"text":"We enjoyed Christmas dinner here this year.  Not many restaurants are open, so we were excited to be able to dine here.  

First off, McCormick & Schmick is not at all what I thought it was.  I thought it was an uber cool, high end fine dining experience.  In reality, it's merely a 1/2 step above Red Lobster.  When we arrived, the lobby was jammed packed.  We were seated approximately 30 minutes after our reservation time.

We were lead to a table smack dab in the middle of a high traffic area.  We protested.  BJ always requests a romantic booth for two.  So after standing in the middle of the restaurant ackwardly for 5 or so minutes, we were finally taken to such a table.    

Service was friendly from Val.  BJ got a Sierra Nevade brew and I ordered a festive beverage from the cocktail menu.  My Poinsettia was sweet beyond belief and tasted sort of like perfume.  We shared a chopped salad which was fairly good.  We also shared a crab tower, which was nice.  But we have had a similiar type appetizer at Bahama Breeze that is SO much better.

BJ wanted to be different, so he had mussels and the clam steamer for his meal.  He liked his choice and said it was okay.  I wanted to be different, too.  So, I had the lump crab cake with southewest jicama slaw and poblano cream.  I was quite put off with the appearance of my dish.  I didn't care much for the brightly color cream slopped on my plate and the slaw was down right nasty.  The crab cake was alright.

For dessert, we pondered our choices.  Nothing sounded very special, but our server was all about the carrot cake.  Surprisingly, it was the best part of our meal."}
{"text":"Because of an event scheduling snafu, a friend wanted to offer an 'apology', which was totally unnecessary, which came in the form of a replacement co-attendee, a card, and a gift card for McCormick and Schmick. 

The event was at Southside Works cinema, and was a whole other snafu within itself, and we ended up not being able to go to the event that day, but since we were there, we decided to use the gift card.

I have to say...I just do not understand this kind of place, or the people with 'money' who drool all over it. With all of the millions of food chains on this planet, all cranking out the exact same conveyor belt food, why would anyone want to pay two or three times what anything is actually worth at these overhyped chains, when there are so many far better options available in any neighborhood anywhere near any of them? Having a gift card helped not wreck a budget, but still didn't make paying for what was served seem any more reasonable.

The venue is another of the typical 'used to be a mill but is now a mall' giant box with a logo, parked next to the plethora of OTHER giant boxes with logos (Cheesecake Factory, etc.). Southside Works, The Mills, Waterfront...all the same. Big chains, big boxes with logos, same conveyor belt foods coming off the Sysco trucks...no mom and pops in sight.

When we walked in we were very properly greeted by the host, who showed us to our table. Our server popped by very quickly with menus and took our drink orders. One water, and one iced tea.

We looked over the menu, and tried finding the most reasonable 'lunch' items to order. The place supposedly specializes in steak and seafood, but I can't say that this is visibly obvious from the menu. It just looks like a  regular family restaurant menu on steroids, intended to be served up on silver spoons.

We opted for burgers and fries, one standard cheeseburger, 'Kobe' beef, lettuce, tomato, onion, and Cheddar cheese, and one 'Manchego' burger, which was a 'Kobe' burger with Tomato Chutney, Avocado, Arugula, and Manchego Cheese.  Both came with fries and some little pickle slices.

One was $12.50, and the other $16. 

When you tout your own horn about being the place for over-priced steak and seafood, one would think that you might go a step above to make a burger wow the hell out of your customers.

There was really nothing special at all about these burgers. They were good, yes...but they were nothing stellar or memorable. Burgatory or Winghart's manages that without the hype or hefty price tag. Their burgers have something really special about them. These burgers had little flavor, and for a medium rare, no juices. The toppings added the flavor, as well as a side of mayo and dijon. But the meat itself was just average. And for more than an hour of my wages, the burger wasn't even all that sizeable. Just average. The fries...were fries. The pickles? Probably out of a jar.

The atmosphere was fine. The server was exemplary. Very polished and attentive. But I'm sure when you're dealing the the Mt. Lebonites with their bourgeois fashion and eyewear, you'd better be at your best, and the young lady that was our server, was what servers should be at all restaurants. Sadly, this level of polish seems to only be reserved for the 'wealth' of da burgh. 

Two burgers with fries and an iced tea...and there's only $12 left on a $50 gift card from a lunch.

And except for the service, it was all just...average.

I'm sure that the original McCormick and Schmick was a bit more special than this...but once 'franchised', it was watered down, price gouged, and turned into just another corporate food conveyor belt. Kind of like the original Kroc brothers made good hamburgers and fries.

Now what the heck to do with the remains on this gift card..."}
{"text":"I've gotten to know the people here at McCormicks during my time living Uptown and I have to say... They are just about the nicest and most wonderful people to be around.  I spend most of my time in the bar area eating dinner and chatting it up with Austin before the bar.  Every now and then Kenny, the manager, comes by to say hello and we catch up on everything.  It just feels like... CHEERS to me.  

So, I've been here so many times that I could write a novel about the whole menu and how everything tastes.  Just know, it is really difficult to find something that you don't love.  The fish tacos are so underrated it's a joke.  I could eat 5 billion of those bad boys.  Keeping with the underrated theme, the hummus blows your socks off.. YEAH!  Hummus!  As far as the seafood goes... I am from the North East.  We get some pretty kick a$$ seafood up there and McCormicks is the only place that I have found that can battle.  Fish is fresh (hard to find that around here), steaks are juicy and favorful, lobster bisque and ravioli are a TEN, and the mussels are spectacular.  Stop in and say hello.. I will probably be perched in the corner chatting it up.  

Oh yeah... History Alert!!  There is a little piece of Queen City history right out front on the sidewalk.. Check it out.  Enjoy!

{"text":"We made a reservation with ease, very friendly phone staff. Arrived to celebrate my children's (age 12) first stage performance. We were seated right away, however, we were seated in a back room, more like a conference room (we had a table for 5), no music, one other table seated in the same room. On our way to said conference room, we passed through the open and airy, crowded and lively main room. Why we were in a conference room? 
No matter, we ordered, all of us getting steaks, filet and ribeye. One person ordered a filet medium well and the other a ribeye, medium. Food and drinks took FOREVER to arrive and our snippy waitress didn't come back to see how our food was for quite a while. Well, the filet (medium well, for my 12 yr old daughter) was medium rare, at best. My Dad's ribeye was RARE, cooked only on the outside. So, they sat there for a while until she finally returned. We told her of the issue, no apology from her, irratated at best (does this happen often?), took the plates and said they would cook it more. Hmmm, ok. The rest of the table was finished with dinner when the server brought back the other 2 plates, seriously, it took over 10 minutes to bring it back. STILL WRONG!!! My daughters was much better (the filet) but missing her truffle butter on side and the broccolini on the plate now cold. My Dad's (ribeye), they must not of touched, cold and still rare. We asked for a manager, told of our complaint, and he apologized and said he hopes we visit again in the future. WHAT??? No, we will not be visiting again in the future, $300 bill for lousy food. Some celebration!! 
VERY DISAPPOINTING!"}
{"text":"The service here was fabulous, attentive and accommodating. The decor is beautiful and a table by the window is very cozy. The shrimp kisses were deligthful, mildly spicy with a good crispy breading plus a decent portion to share. The canadian Malpeque oysters on the half shell were sweet briny deliciousness. The three of us shared an iceberg wedge salad that the waiter was kind enough to have split into 3 different plates. The lobster and filet medallions entree was by far the tastiest. The sauce perfectly complemented the steak and the lobster couldnt have been sweeter. The dry rubbed ribeye steak I wouldn't order again. It wasn't a bad cut of meat, just not as good as many other less expensive steaks elsewhere. The creamed spinach was a generous portion arriving in a small cassarole dish. It was fresh and satisfying. Creme Brulee was creamy and had a delightful sugar crust. The millionaire coffee was equally delicious. All said and done the meal came to $265 including tip. I'm planning to go back for their happy hour soon."}

{"text":"A coworker and I had lunch here on a Thursday.  We wound up here because the other place we wanted to go had a 20 minute wait and McCormick's was near by.  The restaurant was about 2/3 full and we were seated immediately.  Our waitress came over for our drink orders quickly.  After giving us a few minutes to decide we ordered.  I ordered the blackened fish tacos and my coworker had the Salmon Florentine Penne.  The waitress asked if we wanted bread and we said yes.  It took about 10 minutes to get our bread, which was about 1/4 of  loaf (4 small slices) we polished that off pretty quickly and waited about another 10 minutes to get our food.  The blackened fish tacos were OK, the fish was a little over cooked, but the flavor was pretty good.  My coworker said the salmon florentine penne was OK too.  Our waitress never checked back at all throughout our lunch.  Don't waste your time here, the service was bad and I've had better seafood elsewhere."}
{"text":"Husband had to work this Christmas day, knowing he didn't want to come home and cook, and knowing my cooking is not his favorite, he's a pro and they tend to be hyper critical, so I suggested a reservation and he went for it!  

We love this place and for special occasions we love coming here. Tonights menu was no different than some of their previous menus, a couple of chef recommendations, their  assorted fish done to perfection as well as their steaks. 

We started with the steamed muscles, could not get enough! Crab cake that is solid crab meat and a bowl of lobster bisque and claim chowder! All worthy choices.

I had the barramundi, New Zealands sea bass, it was on top of risotto and smothered with a tomato confit. Cooked perfectly!  My husband got the ulimate grill, shrimp two or three ways with scallops. He loved it! For desert, we shared a chocolate slik pie, smooth, rich chocolate with rasberries. 

Service good, food good, evening very good!"}
{"text":"My review us strictly from their happy hour. I'm my opinion one if the best around. Had a margarita which was kind of sewer and week, but only $6. M&S tea very good and cheap beer. The highlight on the menu is the $3.99 burger n fries...quality and great price!!"}
{"text":"McCormick & Schmick was the restaurant we chose to use our $100 Landry's gift certificate. We had a delicious dinner secluded in a booth with one other table in our section for the entire meal. The seafood was fresh and our server Sean, who knew the menu in and out, was excellent.

The menu is about eighty percent seafood with a section of steaks and specialty meats. There is also a three course \"chef's exclusive dinner\" for $29 which my wife ordered and had the walnut salad, shrimp scampi, and molten chocolate cake. We were pleased they had a nice selection of oysters so we started off with three different types for a total of ten and the recommended shrimp kisses, which were bacon wrapped shrimp, a can't miss combination.

My entree was the \"chef's special\" for the night which was a mild flavored pan seared filet of Chilean sea bass that was moist and tender topped with lemon butter lump crab that added some richness and acidity. When asked for a good wine to pair with my fish, Sean recommended a winner with Robert Mondavi's fum√© blanc, a lighter savignon blanc that didn't overpower the fish. At $48, the price was on the steep side and not that creative on the chef's part by just putting together a protein and an add-on that were already on the menu and just replacing the side with vegetables.

We went a little overboard ordering an extra dessert and a latte because we had the gift certificate, but there were no complaints about the upside down candied walnut apple pie. After paying the $182 tab, we were full and satisfied. There would be no objections for a return visit, especially if we were looking for a varied selection of fish and entrees."}
{"text":"The place was deserted. The server joined the Witness Protection Program after he brought our drinks. The food was good. The service and the management were below par. Never again!"}

{"text":"My husband, my daughter, and I ate here yesterday to celebrate my birthday. My husband had suggested a different South Park restaurant but I chose this place because we had never been. I wish I'd listened to my husband's suggestion. We ate here on a Monday night, so it was not busy at all. The food was good, but the service left little to be desired. We had raw oysters, bacon wrapped shrimp, lobster bisque, crab legs, lobster tails, salmon, a bottle of wine, and dessert. Our waiter, Carson, should have been thrilled to wait on us, considering the amount of our bill, but he was quite the opposite. Every time he returned to our table, he set down items and just walked away! He even brought out my birthday cake with the candle in it, set it down, and walked away without a word! He was obviously wanting to chat with his coworkers instead of doing his job. The employees were all hanging around the hostess stand. At one point, the hostess even went to the restroom, changed into casual clothes, then came back out to the hostess stand. Management really needs to offer some more training for its employees."}
{"text":"I had a dinner here last night with a friend of mine. We were warmly welcomed but had to wait 10+ min to get a waitress and water. It was around 8pm and was not busy at all. It seemed the service was very slow all around the restaurant, not only our server.

All I wanted was clean non-greasy broiled some kind of white fish and I ordered broiled flounder. I specifically asked for \"broiled flounder with nothing or what so ever on it\", however, my request was completely ignored and I got flounder which was cooked the way they usually do or the way it was described on the menu.

I am usually bothered when servers check on the food in the middle of eating, however, not being questioned about it bothered me last night.

I did not feel respected as a customer. I'm usually a generous tipper but I had to reflect my dissatisfaction on the tip which was 10%."}
{"text":"The service was 100% better here than others where I've been.  The food presentation needs just a little work and the oysters were a tad in need of more judging before serving (minus 1 star).  Not a bad choice when you're in Uptown Charlotte..."}
{"text":"The oysters were wonderful.  The waiter recommended a few, I ordered them and was pleased.  It did take a while for service.  However, when we beckoned the waiter he was prompt to respond (minus 1 star)  The patio is a good place to dine (weather permitting).  All in all, a good place to go if you like oysters on the half shell..."}
{"text":"Good food!  I had never been there before last Thursday.  I went there on a lunch meeting and was not paying!  I was debating about the fish options, but seemed plentiful priced from $14-20.  When my lunch partner ordered soup and a dish, so I went ahead and ordered the $20 jumbo shrimp stuffed with crab meat.  It came with mashed sweet potatoes.  It was an incredible meal.  
This is a classy joint.  A little high brow for me for lunch.  But I would love to go back with my husband for a a nice night out!"}
{"text":"Family birthday celebration

We had reservations on Sunday at 1:00pm.  We arrived early and was seated right away.  Our server George was phenomenal.  He made lunch suggestions, was attentive and stayed with our table without being too imposing. We had 3 appetizers ,  fried oysters which were not on the menu but the chef prepared special due to our request, lobster bisque and a wedge salad the he was glad to split 3 ways.  Our entrees were the Sunday special crab legs which came already split(my order, easy to eat),  with roasted potatoes and melted butter.  Crab cake sandwich with fries.( huge sandwich with home made pickles and seasoned fries) and shrimp scampi( generous portion of shrimp on top of linguini noodles). Everything from the sourdough bread to the entrees were served to order and hot). The atmosphere was great and we even had the chocolate basket for dessert. (Milk chocolate, white chocolate cream and mixed berries) this is a must try.
We will definitely return to M&S when in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"What a great experience. The service was excellent and the food was phenomenal. We asked about the specials. And I am so glad we did. I went with the 20oz bone in ribeye cajun style and andouille mashed potatoes. It was amazing. My wife had the Alaskan King crab done scampi style and was also very happy with her food. Very satisfied and looking forward to our next visit!"}

My boyfriend had the filet and lobster and it was good nothing special. I had the shrimp dish... And there was like right pieces of shrimp which left me hungry afterwards... This place is rediculously overpriced. I don't mind splurging a bit on food but the quality of the seafood just is not there."}
{"text":"We enjoyed an evening here for my sister in laws thirtieth birthday.  The food was fresh and really good.  I explored the extensive menu and came to the choice of almond crusted rainbow trout.  The trout was fantastic and the sides were different and exquisite.   The staff was attentive and friendly.  The knocks on this restaurant would be the portion sizes and the price.  Overall nice experience though."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. They had one bartender on the Sat before Valentine's Day. They were out of wine glasses so we had to wait a half hour for those and for any drinks from the bar. My drink came out wrong and the glass was a filthy sticky mess. If you are going to quadruple the retail price of the bottle of wine at least have glasses available. They finally brought white wine glasses for our red wine.They were out of the wine we ordered but it took 20 minutes to inform us. There were 10 of us, and reviews were mixed on the food. I ordered beef and lobster tail and they forgot the bordelaise sauce for the beef. The food and drinks came out staggered. The food was ready they just had one server running back and forth to get it, so some of it came out cold. Our bill was over $600. I was surprised a manager never stopped over to apologize, offer dessert, anything for the fiasco our dinner was.  First time visiting this chain and we will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and our waiter was not only attentive but friendly and accommodated my fish allergies (I can eat shellfish just not actual fish). Our glasses were never empty and any trash on the table disappeared just as soon as it was created. Our dinner was served in a timely manner and our drinks well made. Everything was exactly the way I remember it from my youth my disappointment was how far it's fallen in manner of class. McCormick and Shmick used to have a dress code and an expectation of elegance. We dressed to go out and found ourselves surrounded by people speaking loudly on their cellphones and in t-shirts. Not only has the standard for their dress code died but so has their desire to create a comfortable atmosphere I felt like I was in a noisy McDonald's with crying children and cellphone conversations as well as cellphone arguments going on all around me. The food is still wonderful but it's not what it used to be."}
{"text":"If it hadn't been for the fact that I was celebrating a friend's birthday I would have come here for lunch over dinner. The post both menus outside and there is a big up charge for the same food if you come for dinner.

They do have WiFi but you need to get the \"code\" in order to use it. They do not validate parking like some other restaurants in this area.

My girlfriend had the seafood trio which she enjoyed and they gave her a free dessert. They were offering a chef's special Sun-Thurs evenings for $24.99 which includes a choice of soup or salad, entree, and dessert. I opted for that one and settled for the breaded tilapia with sweet potato cous cous. and green beans. There were only flakes of sweet potato in it.

The meal is served with bread and there was plenty to eat. Our waiter was busy with other tables so it took long to get refills on our beverages but other than that it was good.

I learned that if you are an AARP member you can present your card and save 10% off your check. When we got our check it didn't have that discount and my whole meal was broken up in charges instead of one bundle. Took a while to get it straightened out but we managed.

Again I will visit this place if I find the need to. My preference is lunch since you can get most of the same items a lot cheaper."}
{"text":"This was my 2nd visit to the downtown location and I learned that even though they are a chain and carry the same menu, this one and the one previously reviewed in the Southside are not the same.

We came to celebrate my neighbor's birthday after seeing a show. We were treated like princesses by our waiter named Tim. On our menus at the top were written \"Happy birthday\" on them. My girlfriend was pleasantly surprised.

She opted for the crabcake dinner while I opted for their salmon specialty of the day. Please note that when you come for dinner you don't get the option of adding a side salad for a small upcharge as you would for lunch. We got there fairly early and by the time we left the place was packed!

We got bread and butter and then our meals. She loved her crabcakes which came with a corn topping along with a pasta side. My salmon came with cut up green apples, asparagus and a pea sauce. I loved every bite of it.

She wanted dessert for her special day so she ordered carrot cake while I settled for flourless chocolate cake. Tim brought both desserts and sang \"Happy Birthday\" to her. Mine was not too heavy and came with a few berries on it. It wasn't overfilling. She said she enjoyed her carrot cake which was several layers.

Having previously secured a Landry's card which can be used at a few restaurants downtown I asked if it could be combined with my AARP card. (As noted before-if you show them your AARP card then you are entitled to 10% off your check). The Landry's card is a reward card which accrues points based on your spend and you get a $25.00 reward your birthday month and anytime your spend exceeds 250 points.

I had been told at the Southside restaurant that I could not combine both cards. Here I was told the opposite. The same thing happened when I was here two weeks ago when I was having dinner with another friend.

Tim gave us great customer service and we both couldn't be happier with our experience. They are open for lunch on weekdays but as we were leaving we saw a sign indicating that they open for lunch at noon on Sats. Considering the price for parking downtown we will return for pre theater dinners we have for upcoming shows. Located on Wood St near Piatt Place it makes a great place to enjoy seafood!"}
{"text":"I wish I would have read the reviews before agreeing to go here but I didn't.  Our friends wanted to go here and stated it is one of their \"favorite\" places in Charlotte so my expectations were set from the beginning!

However, I have to say my experience ended up teetering between par and sub-par.  

I don't really have much to say about the whole evening...it was just not that great.  It wasn't horrible but it wasn't fabulous.  It just seems like one of those chains that tries really hard to be super classy and elite but they never quite cut it.  They pose as some authentic 5 star restaurant when really underneath the white table cloths, dim lighting and suited up servers you are still left with a chain that just overcharges.

The highlight of the evening was the shrimp wrapped in bacon appetizer.  It was phenomenal and worth every one of the 12 dollars.

I ordered the special for the evening which was swordfish with lump crab served over veggies and spinach.  It was just ok.  It was a little fishy, which turned me off right away and it was like half a piece of fish.  Needless to say I left super hungry.  They should probably at least serve it with potatoes or something of substance because I could have eaten three of those meals with no problem. 

Others ordered salmon and the scallops.  The stuffed salmon was a hit at our table so I would recommend that to anyone that is trying out M&S's.  Everyone else seemed to really enjoy everything but again the portions were not satisfying...

I know seafood is lighter fare in general but it just seemed like they gave the smallest piece of fish possible and served it with the skimpiest veggies they could find.  

For the price point you at least want to leave satisfied.  You can spend that dollar amount at any other 5 star restaurant in Charlotte and get a big fat steak and leave so full someone has to wheel you to your car.

Bottom line, this place is not for me.  I think they are good but not great and for the price we paid I want AMAZING."}
{"text":"Love McCormick & Schmick's but I had not been to this location. I was happy when hubby pulled in here as a birthday surprise. 

Without requesting, we were seated in a very private both that even had a curtain that could be drawn. Score!

I started with the crab cake as an appetizer and was pleased. The meat was softer than I was accustomed too but the lack of a lot of filler made it a winner. The portion for the appetizer is one medium-sized cake. 

You can get seafood wasted here so it's the perfect spot for the true seafood fan. I chose lobster-stuffed shrimp and grilled vegetables. The shrimp were very good, amply stuffed with sweet lobster meat. I was so afraid the dish would arrive with three shrimp and was pleasantly surprised to have five or six!

I did not have room for dessert but was treated to a very tasty, brownie topped with vanilla ice cream and a celebratory candle. The perfect end to a perfect birthday meal."}
{"text":"Very disappointed today in my visit to McCormick & Schmick's in Las Vegas. I've been a regular customer of Landry's run restaurants fit several years, I'm even a member of their diner's club.  I took a fellow veteran, whom I knew did not get out often because of limited resources, to McCormick & Schmick's on Memorial Day to enjoy their complimentary meal in honor of those who served. I appreciate their generosity in offering to provide the meals, as many companies do not show any appreciation for the sacrifices made by the members of the military. 

However, today's visit was way below par for McCormick & Schmick's and Landry's, as well as shockingly expensive. The restaurant was not terribly busy when we arrived. We chose a table based out my guests physical needs, and were immediately told it would be cleaned for us. A woman cleared the dirty plates away, then disappeared. We waited but no one came back to finish cleaning the table. After about 5 minutes we flagged down a young man who pulled a damp towel from his apron to wipe the table. I've managed FOH. I know this towel is not sanitary. There's no telling how long it's been in his apron or how filthy it is. That is one way pathogens spread in food service. 

Anyway, that was all the cleaning we received. We then were left waiting several more minutes until a server came by and realized we had not received menus. She then provided menus and took our drink orders. We both asked if they had flavored iced tea or just plain. She did they had multiple flavors. So, we each ordered a flavored tea. We were not informed of any prices and only had the Veteran's menus. A few minutes later or drinks were delivered and orders taken. 

After about 20 minutes or food was delivered. I received a salad, with a menu price of $16.99, that was slightly larger than a dinner salad at most restaurants and an overcooked, tiny, paper thin chicken breast. My guest received a 3+4 is piece of salmon with a scoop of mashed potatoes, and green beans (I liked the green beans) regular menu price of $23.99.The food was enough to fill us, but if I were paying for it I would have been very disappointed. 

When our did was delivered our server offered us more tea.  We both accepted. She did not mention any charge. It was iced tea, I've never been charged for refills so I didn't expect a charge tonight either. Later we ordered dessert. I had a third iced tea. Again, there was no mention of a charge. 

When the check arrived or bill was $50. Dessert was $20. The remainder was for iced tea. We were charged almost $30 for iced tea! Who does that?! The menus should come with warning labels! That is not a customary charge! Each glass was $4.50! McCormick & Schmick's, your greed just cost you a loyal Landry 's customer. I will never dine in one of your restaurants again. The free meal that you provided these veterans was overvalued. The drinks you charged me fire Das just robbery. If of known that was on my bill I would not have ordered the desserts.  I will never dine in one of your restaurants again, and will tell everyone I know about this outrageous charge."}
{"text":"So, my Foodie Group met up for Happy Hour this week and enjoyed the Happy Hour offerings. McCormick's offers limited drinks and appetizers for from 4:30-7:00. Although it was crowded we were able to grab a few seats at the bar. Service was great and the drinks and appetizers were on point. I enjoyed the apple martini, yum.
As for food, we tried a variety of items. The calamari, tuna, cheeseburger and the shrimp cocktail. Although everything was great, the cheeseburger was by far the best. A half pound burger, cooked to perfection with fries for 5.99. How could you beat that deal? 
Overall a great after work crowd, good service drinks and food."}
{"text":"I was in the Southpark area this past Sunday and thought I would check out McCormick & Schmick's for brunch. After arriving, and only seeing two tables seated and two individuals at the bar this should have been our sign to walk out.  Being a nice day out we were seated outside on the patio. Very nice area with comfy seats too.  We placed our drink order while we looked over the menu.  I started with a bloody mary, but had to send it back, it was awful..basically an entire glass of horseradish.  So, needless to say after 20 minutes and our waitress no where to be found I went straight to the bar and traded it out for a mimosa.  Needless to say when Nivia, our waitress, came to take our order she did not mention anything about the drink change..Maybe it is me, but I would have expected something.
After reviewing the menu I decided to stick with their brunch items and chose to make my own omelet.  I chose ham, onions and swiss cheese, 3 items included, $.50 for any additional items.  So, I chose to add peppers.  The omelett came with potatoes and fruit, and I added an english muffin, another $.99.  After 30 minutes our food arrived and the omelett was okay.  However, they forgot to add the peppers.  Alright, not that big of a deal.  However, the english muffin was straight out of a bag, not even toasted..That is an issue. I waited and waited for our waitress to return to request that they \"toast\" the muffin.  Needless to say it was returned when I was almost finished with the meal.
Overall, the service was horrible.  Nivia needs to find a job she likes and pay attention to checking on her tables more than once.  Note:  There was another table outside that seem to experience the same thing.
A mimosa in a champagne glass should not cost $8.50, that is ridiculous!
I will stick with McCormick & Schmick's uptown location for Happy Hour and dinner, but pass on brunch in the future."}
{"text":"Went to Mc Cormick & Schmick's  on Thursday night with client the service was  good as well as the food. We had a good time."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for about 10 years. A couple of years ago, they closed for remodeling, but I thought they closed for good. Until, I got invited on a date there. We came on time, and we got seated immediately. That part was good. The place looked exactly the same. There was nothing that looked different. Our waiter came. But, he didn't introduce himself. He asked us about drinks. I got a Mojito & my date got some red wine. My Mojito was OK. It tasted watered down, & it didn't have enough lime & mint. 

We got the bread-and-butter, they served it pretty quickly. And, shortly after, came our calamari that we ordered. The calamari was as good as it has always been. They cook it with some jalape√±os to add a little kick to it. But, it isn't too spicy. As long as you stay away from the banana peppers. I ate one thinking that it was a sweet potato, big mistake.

For our entr√©es, I chose two crabcakes and he chose the mahi-mahi. Both were a bit bland. But, we really loved our side dishes. The lobster mashed potatoes & creamed spinach. Both were superb! For dessert, we chose the chocolate bag. It was beautifully presented and it was very delicious. It had some kind of whipped cream inside but it wasn't regular whipped cream, it tasted a little bit like a custard. It was outstanding. And, all of the berries were very fresh. We ordered it with some Chambord. Which is always delicious. Although, I believe that they put very little. Only a few sips or so. 

Most of the food was very delicious. Our waiter was a bit cold. He disappeared after he brought out our entrees. We were wondering what happened to him. But, overall, we had a nice time at a beautiful restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a place that knows how to keep you coming back again and again. I usually enjoy ordering from the happy hour menu at the bar. The cheeseburger and fries or calamari are two of my favorite menu selections. 
The Charlotte location that I usually visit has a fun and friendly staff that makes you feel right at home. The bartender Mark is awesome! He remembers your name even if it's been months since your last visit!! This is the place where Mark knows your name!
Stop by and enjoy a meal and a libation, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"McCormick and Schmick's is located in a great location downtown, has a great-looking bar that would be perfect for happy hour after work and the mandatory 'steakhouse' feel inside with big booths and white cloth tables.

Service was good, if a little aggressive on the upsell side. She said she was new.  She didn't know the menu as well as she should, but I'm sure she'll learn it. We found her very entertaining, so it made up for any inexperience on her part. 

I think the food overall was, 'meh I've had better.\" Got the cobia with forbidden rice.'I found the fish to be rather bland and the rice overly sweet.   The presentation could've been better, too.  

I'm giving mcCormick and Schmicks three stars, which is higher than the review would indicate, only because I've not eaten there before and the space is cool and the location is good.  

But caveat emptor."}
{"text":"Food was bad. Steak was a poor cut of meat under cooked. Lobster bliss charred black. Service was slow and inattentive. ."}
{"text":"The food here is good but did not give enough. I was still hungry by the end of the meal. Maybe it's because of where I'm from. But in truth I think that's how the meal should be. I shouldn't over eat. So you can have room for desert. The sad part is that I didn't get any desert. I was with a group of people and I wasn't paying for it. I got the sea bass. Was very good."}
{"text":"Good food.  It was snowing really bad when we went, so it kept the crowd away.  Probably a good thing, because it was a huge restaurant.

Nice location on the south side.  Not on Carson and across from a parking garage.

We both had fish and our sides and desserts were really good. I normally don't like trout but I wanted to give it a try.  It was moist and flavorful. The greens that came with it were delicious. We shared a flourless chocolate cake with raspberry sauce that was out of this world.

Yep, I'm a fan. So, far."}
{"text":"A bit underwhelming...

The filet mignon was in a delicious red wine sauce, but the meat itself was a little tough. The \"shrimp scampi\" looked and tasted just like a few boiled shrimp that were quickly tossed in lemon juice and parsley before serving. The shrimp were also a bit undercooked which was extremely unappetizing."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!

The bar is great and I don't think I have ever had a bad meal or bad service.  

Knocks...pricey (but it is city dining) and MORE risotto!!!  You guys have the BEST risotto but too scarcely on the menu!"}
{"text":"Everything was too salty.  Everything!

Had lobster bisque that was so thick it was needing a fork and knife.

Ordered spring vegetables -- I love fresh veggies -- as a side order but instead of fresh veggies, they were boiled to a soggie pulp and then covered with an extremely salty and thick brown meat(?) sauce.  Who came up with that?

Even fries were too salty.  That's hard to do because I like salty fries.

Good service.  Waitress removed the charge of the veggies when I pointed out how awful the sauce was."}
{"text":"Everything was average, the crowd, the food and the service.  It really wasn't memorable.  There are better options, even for Charlotte."}
{"text":"Having a hard time deciding whether to give this spot a 3 or 4 star review after our last visit for Christmas Dinner. The food itself was pretty fantastic, but service was painfully slow. The server himself was awesome, incredibly apologetic every time he came by the table (almost too apologetic actually) but apparently it was a kitchen issue. We ended up being there close to 3 hours, and with a 2 year old that was definitely longer than we'd want to spend trying to get through dinner. And that's without waiting for dessert. We've been here many times over the years, and service/food was always excellent before - but it's been a very long time (more than 5 years likely) since we've been in so I can really use those experiences in my review. Overall, I had the pontchartrain grouper and it was really unbelievably good. My Mom had some variation of trout and my husband probably had one of the mixed seafood grills. We all really enjoyed our food. We also had the crab cake appetizer, one lone crab cake and it was pretty average in my opinion. I've had much much better and also make much better crab cakes at home. So as much as I would love to give this place 4 stars, with the tab being close to $300, service being THAT slow without anything more than an apology from the server and manager, I had lipstick on my first cocktail and drinks were overall also very, very slow, I just can't give this location anymore than 3 stars. We will probably go back someday, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Not very good. Fish underdone and felt rushed after mentioning we were going to relax a bit. The raw oysters we in fact very good."}
{"text":"We hit up happy hour (M-F 3-7p) yesterday just to try it out, neither of us have been to McCormick and Schmicks and, I don't think we will be back either. The HH prices have almost doubled since I last looked them up, FYI. Drinks start at $6 and Food starts at $3 

The hostess was very nice and explained HH was open to the bar area including the bar height tables, cool. We sit down and take a look at the menu. Our server was a little pushy when it came to taking out order and insisted I try the bruschetta ($3) with the mussels ($7) I ordered, after a while I just gave in, the guy had stamina. My boyfriend ordered the infamous burger ($5). We also got a couple of cabernet glasses ($6). The food got to the table within reasonable time. The bruschetta was fresh but had way too much mint in it, if you really want to put some herbs in there, stick to basil. Mint makes no sense, this is not a mojito. The balsamic vinegar the bruschetta came with was more on the sweet side. The burger we ordered looked good and was cooked nicely but was sadly very bland, some seasoning and flavored aioli would have made it enjoyable. Now, the mussels, I love mussels but the white wine sauce was too strong and was not able to mask the natural fishiness of the mussels. eh I just worked my way through it with the cheesy bread that accompanied the dish. Towards the middle of my dish is where I docked the most stars on this review. THEY GAVE ME A BAD MUSSEL, I immediately spat it into my napkin and waited for our server to let him know. He was very apologetic and sent out for a new mussel dish. 

Skip to bill time, the server charged us for the second plate of mussels which I didn't order. Luckily, as we were about to sign, he rushed up to our table and told us he had to remove a mussel dish off the bill since it was a house mistake...good call, that would have made me a very upset little brown girl. All in all, the service was great but the food was just not good enough to make me want to come back."}
{"text":"First thing that comes to mind is that they have a KILLER happy hour special for food.  And by killer I mean it's DIRT CHEAP!  You can get a regular sized burger AND fries for $2.95.  You can't get a better deal than that!  I don't know about you guys, but I go to happy hour to eat AND drink!  It's dinner time...and I get hangry (hungry + angry) so food must be consumed.  

You can also get an array of apps for only $1.95 like crab cakes, spinach dip, fish taco's, etc.  There's also \"fancier\" apps for about $5 like mahi cakes, mussels and pierogies (um, what?  ok!).  They're probably a good serving for one person, but for that price you can order a couple for the table.  

The drink specials aren't that great on the other end of things, definitely not dirt cheap like the food.  They're from $4-7 dollars for beers, wine and the fancier drinks.  Meh.

If you're dining in for dinner, the food isn't bad, but nothing too memorable.  I've had the Ahi Tuna, which is good, but not as fresh tasting, and cooked a little more than I'd prefer.  The sushi is also just kinda meh, again, just not as fresh tasting as some of the local joints we have around.  

I'll just stick to stuffing my face on the cheap for Happy Hour!"}
{"text":"Just recently began to dine at this restaurant and I have to say that I think I have found a new seafood regular. I have been there 3 times so far and the seafood is fresh and well prepared. I have found a few mis-steps. I order the corn salsa on the side and the lobster mashed potatoes does not need the sauce that is poured over it. I am happy otherwise."}
{"text":"What a contradiction!!!

My husband and I went here for happy hour.  For a restaurant that offers sushi grade fish on the menu, the frozen food that was served for the happy hour special was disgusting.  I have had meals here and enjoyed every bit, but I will never return to a restaurant that will offer a happy hour with frozen food, and claim to have sushi grade fish.  

Very disappointed.

I agree Bridget H., negative stars is appropriate."}
{"text":"My family and I dine here at least once a month. We enjoy the service, the wine selection, the specials, the desserts, everything. Perfect location for a small party, and perfect location for a large party. Always a great family night out."}
{"text":"LV Yelpers... stay away!

Came here the other night for dinner since I was craving fish.

I waited over 30 minutes to be seated.
Crab soup was horrible... no taste.
Fish wasn't cooked throughly. (I had the trio and rainbow trout)
lomi salmon wasn't done right.

Management and customer service was horrible with compensation for bad service.

I won't be back.

NEXT!"}
{"text":"What can I say bad about this place. Nothing. Honestly. The price is a little high but the service and food is always amazing so I won't complain there. I love the calamari here. They also fry up veggies with it as well. Even nicer is every year they serve all veterans and active military for a complimentary meal on the Sunday before Veterans Day. I recommend getting a reservation. As with last year I did not do this and it was very busy today. However they did have spots open at the bar where the service was spectacular. I ordered the pecan crusted chicken with a demi glaze, served with mash potatoes and broccoli. I ate every bite if that says anything. Also met another fellow single vet and made a new friend. Don't forget even if your meal is free remember to tip your server :). So all in all this place is on the top of my list."}
{"text":"I really like it here, mainly because of their calamari. The first time I went here we sat at the bar and ordered apps and drinks. It is a little pricey, so if you have it to burn the bar staff was awesome. The second time it was veterans day and they offered a free meal to all vets, with some sort of identification of course. Dan, now the ex :(, and I went for a late lunch/early dinner so we didn't need a reservation. However if you are going for a deal like that during any rush hour, make a reservation. 

We received great service. The waitress was on the floor by herself for the first time, and I would have never known it unless she said something, not that it would bother me, I have special patience for waitstaff because its a hard job. 

With the staff being great and food pretty good I would go here again, but like I said it is a little pricey. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Don't bother! We went for lunch on a Thursday afternoon and were the only people in the restaurant. We waited a half an hour for salads, another half hour for our food and they brought half of us the wrong meal. The food was not good and it took another hour to get a manager over to the table. I will never go back!"}
{"text":"Really, 4 puny fried oysters for $8.95? Four fabulous, plump beautifully prepared oysters, sure, but our appetizer was a joke, truly laugh out loud pathetic.  Way too many good restaurants in this town for this to be acceptable. McCormick and Schmick's insults."}
{"text":"This place is  located in a pretty fun place, south side works.  I  like the interesting shops in the area and a few restaurants.  Unfortunately, many of the restaurants are national chains like this one.  However, this place knows what it is doing.  You won't be blown away, but I've never had a bad meal here.  I went today with a couple friends and sat at the bar.  The space is nice enough with plenty of seating and high ceilings.  The bar area is pretty nice with a few hightops scattered about.  On the weekends this place can get pretty busy at the bar.  Today we were the only ones there.  The bartender Jen used to  work here and then she was at the Library down the street and now she's back again.  She's competent and friendly enough.  She said she makes a terrific bloody mary, so we ordered a few.  The bloody mary was very spicy and very strong.  It was a  good bloody mary and certainly wouldn't take more than two of these to wake you up in the am.  We started out with a nice very fresh sourdough bread with butter.  The sourdough was great.  I'm thinking \"Breadworks\".  I tried a smoked salmon appetizer that was served with red onions, capers, and chopped eggs.  It was very much a brunch dish.  The salmon was tasty and their were plenty of toppings.  The salmon was served on these crispy crackers with some type of flavorless sauce.  When  you  bite into the crackers the whole thing basically explodes.  It's not a very user friendly way to serve the salmon.  This would have been much better with just a bagel and some cream cheese.  I tried a friends \"Firecracker\" rolls.  It was basically a chicken egg roll.  It was okay, but not memorable.  He also ordered a reuben which he said was good.  I tried one of his fries that looked good, but was kind of mushy instead of crispy.  I had a tilapia which was served encrusted with some type of nut (pecans maybe, don't quite  recall).  It was cooked perfectly and quite frankly a little too big for a lunch portion.  Served with a nice tasty rice pilaf and some green beens.  This was good, but heavier than I would have liked with the topping on the fish.  Overall this place does fish quite well.  The dinners are a bit overpriced, but again it is a franchise.  This is a perfectly suitable option in the south side works."}
{"text":"To really derive full value from Restaurant Week, one must pack in some lunches as well as dinners.  Thus it transpired that, with Diane and another couple in tow, I ventured to McCormick & Schmick's one early afternoon to take advantage of three sweet-sounding $20.13 three course meals.

While I had to ask for Sourdough Bread and butter, when it arrived the bread was suitably sour and excellent.  For a $2.00 upcharge, a bowl of creamy New England Clam Chowder contained chunks of clams, potatoes, and some celery.  Cedar Roasted Salmon was nice and moist, with red peppers, squash, zucchini, and Roasted Potatoes, a few of which were too hard.  Cole Slaw was light and creamy.

For dessert, I enjoyed a slice of great warm Upside Down Walnut Apple Pie with a large refreshing scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream.  Vanilla Cr√®me Brulee was excellent as well.

We sat at a comfortable and homey window booth, and all went well during our visit except my fork had a bent prong and our server forgot to divide the bill between parties as earlier agreed.  These were very minor glitches in an otherwise very fine lunch."}
{"text":"Excellent food and waiter was very attentive!!! Made reservations and seated on time!!  Hubby had ribeye steak medium to perfection and I had the ahi tempura.  Both dishes were flavorful!  Great food and decent pricing!!! Staff was awesome and friendly!  Will return for sure!!!"}
{"text":"1st time here and ken was our server amazing food service and best recommendations will be back"}
{"text":"food was ok,  waitress took forever for everything, we had to keep asking for drinks(refills). tried charging me for an upgrade on a side that was the same price as the one it came with!!! this place seems like its a try it and make your own opinion of it !"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last night for our anniversary. The food was absolutely amazing and the service was great too. You get what you pay for.  It's a little more expensive but it's very fresh and well made. We will most definitely tag this place for special occasions."}
{"text":"Food was overpriced and not up to the quality I was expecting. We went during restaurant week and was definitely disappointed. Skip this place and go to Chima Brazilian Steakhouse right across the street instead. You'll get much more food that tastes delicious."}
{"text":"I have been to both the downtown and the South Side McCormick & Schmick's several times. They rarely disappoint. 

Their menu is quite extensive, changed daily to reflect seasonal fish and ingredients. I always choose something interesting from their cocktail menu, as they have a scratch bar with fresh ingredients.

McCormick's has some very good soups and several salads to choose from, although they cost extra to add to your entree. I will admit that many of their appetizers don't tickle my fancy. I do, however, love the crab dip. It is great for sharing. If you like oysters, they have over 5 varieties available on the half shell. Their mussels are also excellent. 

If you are there for lunch, they have over ten entrees for under $10, which is a pretty good deal. 

My favorite dinner entree is the Salmon stuffed with crab, shrimp, and brie. The serving size is rather small, but the taste is wonderful! 

They also have an extensive wine list and delicious dessert menu. Try the chocolate bag with passion fruit mousse and fresh berries. It's divine!"}
{"text":"I don't handle change well. But I try to go with the flow. Unfortunately, in Las Vegas the flow is a deluge.  This update is for the Happy Hour only.

McCormick & Schmick's Happy Hour was famous for its half- pound Cheeseburger.  I can't complain about the legendary $2.95 burger now costing $3.95 - it's still a deal.  But I sure can bitch about the fact that most of the drink specials are gone from the menu.  Now your choice of Happy Hour beer is no choice.  Coors Light or the highway.  It's $3.75, and comes in a small glass.  No more Sangria, or the cocktail of the day.  Oh, you can also choose from a few coctails for $8.95 or some others for a buck more, and the Happy Hour house wines are 5.95.

The food menu is also pared back.  The blackened fish taco, which we got for a buck last time, is 4.95 now.  It was good, but skimpy for the price.  Last time it was a Special Thursday deal.  Now there are no special deals any day.

Why this Draconian revision?  The waitress provided the answer:  McCormick and Schmick was bought by Landry's, and the suits have been tinkering with things ever since.  She also said regular customers were VERY unhappy.  No surprise there.

The late-night Happy Hour at M& S used to be our go-to place after a Strip show or event.  I guess if hubby and I are both up for cheeseburgers, we'll go back.  But without the happy anticipation we used to have."}
{"text":"Really good food, but hit and miss service. We arrived with a reservation and were promptly seated. It's a comfortable atmosphere. Our first drinks were a healthy sized pour, which is what you get off \"the Strip.\"  According to my bill, our server was \"Mein.\" or \"Sean.\" Why do servers not introduce themselves by name in this town? My date and I shared outstanding stuffed mushrooms as an app, She had the Seafood trio, I had the Scallops. All the items were simply wonderful.
  However, I had asked for a second glass of wine when the meal arrived, it did not appear until I waved someone down and asked for it a second time. At the end of the meal I asked for a double Frangelico on the rocks. Again it did not arrived until I asked for our check and someone noticed it was on the bill, but not on the table. The drink arrived with the check and it was frankly too late and I didn't want it anymore. Getting the drink off the bill appeared to be a big deal and after ten minutes we got up to find the server and the check so we could leave. 
  I recommend this place for a good meal, but service is probably better during peak time when everyone is on point. Toward the end of the evening it seems the staff is a little too busy with closing duties and trying to go home, rather than attending to the guests who are still there."}
{"text":"Order the salmon!! It's always the best and go flavorful! Staffs always attentive and friendly ! They never say no !"}
{"text":"We ordered the Mussels appetizer and it was bad,and uninspiring as any rip off seafood places I have ever been to for mussels. No joke ! I have had better mussels from a freezer bag I purchased at Trader Joes or Giant Eagle \" In the frozen foods\". First off the serving was micro small. The Mussels where like tiny gum bands and many shells where missing the mussel.
Really a rip off for what you get.
Now onto my freezer bag of PEI Mussels from Trader Joes = Large tasty, great mouth feel and not rubbery and a big bunch for less than $6. That being said I did add a 1/3 cup of my own white Italian wine, Garlic and more butter. But aside from that every shell had a giant gem of a mussel and not a tiny, over cooked microscopic gum band. 
Sad excuse for a appetizer - McCormicks & Schmicks.
Quality control,Proper portion sizing and plate inspection before sending it out.

YOU FAILED !"}
{"text":"Well this place is certainly a nice place for happy hour. 
Many Tommy Bahama wearing golfers hang out here. 
My friend lives nearby in the Park Towers
We came for happy hour. 
We had a nice experience 
It was busy
We ordered Calamari, mussels, 2 orders of the coconut shrimp , the seafood mushrooms and the dessert of the chocolate box.
2 house Pinot Grigio 2 Sam Adams and a Cosmopolitan 
Our bill was only $91
Couldn't believe it! And the food was good quality 

Definitely recommended for a sensational happy hour... 
those mushrooms were so good"}
{"text":"Ate there tonight, celebrating my birthday, my daughter's graduation from Duquesne University, and Mother's Day. Knew it would be expensive, but it would have been worth it given the festivities. Quick answer - you cannot make your waiters and waitresses buss tables and expect them to refill drinks and bring your food and appetizers when they are hot. We ordered the calamari (which they now substitute sweet potato and peppers into to increase their profit margin), and the flatbread appetizer. Neither we anything more than tepid and the marinara sauce was cold. Strage but true. Wife had the beef medallions - tepid, small portion, and not very tasty. Daughter enjoyed the lobster bisque, but did not finish her breaded chicken because it was cold. Other daughter had the scallops, no complaints. I had the crab cakes, again hardly warm at all. We attributed this to the fact that our poor waitress had to bus tables while our food sat and waited. For $210 with no alcohol it really wasn't worth it. Disappointing. I used to eat at M&S in DC was I was a named partner in a DC law firm. It was never this bad. Portions were always more than you could eat. And the food was always hot. M&S is now just a terrible chain restaurant looking to increase its profits - and doing so the wrong way."}
{"text":"Christmas Day.  Yep.  Not many places open, but this one sure is, and they make you feel like it's okay that they're all working and you're not.  

  From beginning to end, our experience was very good.  Our Server could not have done a better job, nor have been more delightful.  

   We started with the Shrimp Kisses, unsweetened iced tea and their delicious sourdough bread.  The Shrimp Kisses were so well executed, which is hard to do.  Bacon-wrapped seafood in our experience is often not done right. This was very well done.  Bacon was well cooked, but the shrimp was not over-cooked.  Perfect!  Loved the corn relish under and the fried onions over.  Great appetizer and perfect for sharing!

    Both of us (surprisingly) ordered the same entree: Shrimp Trilogy Buttermilk Fried, Stuffed, Scampi, Butternut Squash Orzo 27.95.  This also comes with: Red Pepper White
Cheddar Mash.  I opted to substitute grilled asparagus for the butternut squash orzo, as I didn't see the need for two starches.  Husband was happy with as-is.

  Our meals were very enjoyable!  Cheesy Mash needed a slight dash of salt....I requested cocktail and tartar sauces and were brought both quickly, which added to the enjoyment of the meal.  Very rich!  I was so glad to have the asparagus to off-set the richness a bit.  The fried shrimp was slightly over-fried and crunchy but dunked in cocktail sauce was still tasty.

   Seriously full, I could only do coffee for dessert, but Husband managed some super moist carrot cake.  Half of which we brought home.

   For those that poo-poo chain restaurants, there is something to be said about one that is working this hard to deliver quality and service that's not only excellent, but done on Christmas Day!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here with a friend on Memorial Day. The ambiance was nice and so was the waiter but the food was awful. My husband ordered the free salmon which was a big disappointment: dry, bland and small portion.
I figured maybe it was because it was free. I ordered the stuffed flounder (not free) and my cell phone was bigger than the fish. It also had a weird taste as if it wasn't fresh. Very overpriced. We will not be returning EVER!"}
{"text":"My wife and I came to celebrate our wedding anniversary.   The lobster bites were a great start to our meal.  i ordered the Ultimate Grill Combo.  Everything on the plate was wonderful,  however, the salmon was very dry.  My wife had the petite filet.  It appeared to be cooked correctly,  however was not as tender as one would expect.   The staff was warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Good happy hour selection for both food and drinks. The bartender had the full rail I'm her back pocket and gave great service to everyone. The drinks were typical of a happy hour but the food was rad. Cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"Happy hour is amazing!!!!! My friend put me on with this place. What I enjoy is that it's real food being cooked. Nothing frozen, scratch made food is always best! Happy hours Sunday-sat 4pm-7pm. 

I haven't had the pleasure of eating during regular hours. I do know can be expensive but it's very good and worth it!!!!! 

I love being people here so they can experience this place and have good food."}
{"text":"I always enjoy going to McCormick & Schmicks.

This is a great location in 'Uptown' Charlotte at 4th and Tryons St.
They have FREE valet parking.

They consistently have great fresh seafood.
On this visit we had the Wahoo and Ahi Tuna, both were exceptionally good!

We also had the Rhappanock Sting Ray oysters which are better than average.

The Coppola Merlot is a good choice.

The stained glass in this restaurant is art gallery worthy. In the bar area you will see large colorful stained glass ceiling light fixtures themed after various ACC teams as well as the Charlotte 49ers.

Don't miss the NC State flag about the hostess stand, a truly exceptional piece of art."}
{"text":"Average Red Lobsteresque seafood in an upscale atmosphere. What stinks is that when they first opened, I had a fabulous meal and I was excited to have them in CLT. Since then however, nothing but disappointment after disappointment. So sad as there's a dearth of decent seafood in the Queen city and I so thought I had found an oasis after the first visit. Alas... only a mirage......"}
{"text":"Not a good experience, service was too slow; you have to wait more tan 5 minutes to get your ordered beer. Additionally Clam chowder was served cold. Best to look for another option."}
