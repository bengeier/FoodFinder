{"text":"A-1 service; exquisite, remarkably presented food. my mom kept calling my vegan pulled pork tacos as well as her shrimp tacos \"masterchef worthy\"--and she's a rather hard cook to impress. the drinks we ordered were excellent too.  p.s. this place has the cutest ambiance. a truly warm and cozy gem of a restaurant. :)"}
{"text":"Too bad I can't put no stars...We ordered chicken diabla, mole poblano, the fajitas for two, a limonada and 3 pina coladas. The limonada was not spectacular and the pina colada tasted more like ice that coconut and pineapple.Unfortunately, the chicken breast for the two chicken dishes tasted pre-boiled, the breasts were brown and tasted old. Both dishes were served with sticky rice (not Mexican rice?!?!?) and the diablo side dish was awful and tasteless. The fajitas looked like a stir-fry mix, did not taste fresh and had no bite. They were also served with sticky rice...the dishes simply did not blend. It seemed more like Asian-Mexican con-fusion than a good Mexican meal. Many people left full plates behind (which should have been an indication to us when we got there to turn around) now we know why. I would save my money and make my own...Old Del Paso is much, much better and much, much cheaper. Because of this mistake, I am no longer allowed to select a restaurant when we go out to dinner anymore."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot - had the fajitas and sangria (delicious) for two. Reasonable price and great patio"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the little terace, ordered the burrito and michelada style beer.  Very good beer w strong lime spices and a salted rim, best burrito I have had in awhile, filling and not messy, no greasy slop dripping all over your plate or falling apart. Service was great and this place had the best water, I know it sounds stupid but ice cold water with ice cubes in a very big glass is key on a hot day, better than small shitty cups of warm water which never gets refilled, its the little things, cheers le cactus."}
{"text":"Best Mexican north of Maine.  Laarv and her companion searched all around for dinner and stumbled upon this little hidden gem.  Long wait and we were not offered chips and salsa.  Large portions  - we split our meal and it was filling and delicious.  Who would have thought authentic Mexican cuisine could be found in Montreal?!?!"}
{"text":"I havent been back in 20 years but happy to see its still there and dont fix it if it aint broke ! I give 5 stars for consistency , good value , and withstanding the test of time ! Mucho Gracias!"}
{"text":"I went to dinner with 6 friends at Le Cactus and the overall score by everyone was 3*. Nobody complained about their food. Everything was consistently good (enough). I asked the question \"would you go back?\" and the answer was \"ahhhhh... Maybe\".   This place is great in the summer. They have a nice terrace on St-Denis. With some sangria, guacamole and sun on your face the rating definitely rises to 4 stars easily.    I would recommend Cactus If you're dying for Mexican and you're standing on the corner, or any sunny summer day!!!"}
{"text":"Montreal is no hotbed of Mexican restaurants, but there are a few decent spots and Cactus is one of them.  Go simple, enjoy the terrace and the drinks."}
{"text":"Une horreur. C'est le pire mexicain où j'ai mangé,  ils servent leur Ceviche avec du pegasus sans le préciser.  La qualité des plats laisse à penser à une vieille cantine mexicaine degueu ou encore la cuisine d'un ressort dans le sud très bas de gamme. Une infection! Ne parlons pas du service nullissime et du manque de professionnalisme de la maison"}
{"text":"Bonne place mexicaine avec ambiance et service sympathique en espagnol. Belle terrasse et mariachi le vendredi et samedi soir."}
{"text":"Wouldn't go back, wouldn't recommend. Food was a disappointment. $16 fajita that would have tasted better if I made them at home. Lesson learned. Boyfriend felt the same about his burrito. Don't bother ordering the guacamole. It just tasted cold, with too much lime and lettuce. There was one server so I can't blame her for not being too friendly. I felt like I got a lot of dirty looks. Again, lesson learned."}
{"text":"Tex-Mex pub with imitations of Mexican food that doesn't taste that bad. It's one of a handful of places that fills up in the area at night. A tip: free roasted peanuts are self-serve at this place, just get a little basket and got get a few scoops from the barrel."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. I grew up in Cali and there are small Mexican restaurants everywhere. I have been looking for a little place that reminds me of my favorite places. I found it in this place. The ceviche was awesome and the beef borito hit the spot with a side of sliced jalapeños. My hubby enjoyed his mole chicken as well. The service was good and friendly. I recommend this little comfortable place to all. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Really, quite average. The ceviche was enjoyable but the entrees left something to be desired. The mole, especially, seemed somewhat diluted, and lacked the focus which I typically associate with the dish.  Service was optimal but quarters slightly cramped."}
{"text":"Very good price to quality ratio. The food they offer is actually Mexican with legit ingredients. The pinas coladas are really good too."}
