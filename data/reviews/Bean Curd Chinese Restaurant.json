{"text":"Myself and my guys eat here EVERY single Friday while we are at work. It's our tradition. It is the best beef fried rice in town."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time cause it was near my gym. They seem to have recently remodeled or changed owners and not for the better. The food used to be some of my favorite now it's rather sub par.   My mom had the lunch buffet which had scant choices and was not kept we'll stalked. I had the two roll sushi lunch with miso soup. I've never enjoyed a bowl of miso less. It was so salty I had to water it down to make it edible. I attempted to inform the waitress but it was rather busy and she seemed to be alone. The sushi was okay. Not overly flavorful and not exactly generous with the fish.   For a restaurant I used to love I'm sad to say that given this performance I don't think I'll be coming back any time soon."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Very friendly service, and unique menu items.  I was only able to find vegetable dumplings at a couple restaurants in the entire Tampa Bay area, but Bean Curd offered them, and they were delicious!  Not the fanciest dining arrangements, but the food far out-shines the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Food is great, service has improved recently. The thai curries and sushi are highly recommended."}
{"text":"omg! sooo stingy with vegtables!im never going again my vegtable chop suey was a couple snow peas and 4 baby corns with bean curd!"}
{"text":"We ordered a large amount of take-out from The Bean Curd last night for a 70th birthday party.  Our plan was to pick it up and set it all out ourselves for about 50 guests.  The Bean Curd was amazing to work with!  They delivered chafers and all of the accompaniments earlier in the day - and at party time delivered the food as well!  The food was delicious!  All of our guests loved it!  We cannot say enough about the exceptional service we received for this party, thanks for helping make the party such a great success!!!"}
{"text":"If I could give 3.5 stars I would. I'm a foody so earning a 5 would be a pretty special restaurant. Here the menu is vast, something for everyone and the classic Chinese dishes (Kung pao, general tso, orange, sweet and sour, fried rice, soups etc.) are what you expect. We've been here a few times and the service is consistent. Stay away from the chicken and shrimp with lobster sauce and the seafood soup. Not only are they basically the same dish (soup just doesn't have chicken and is watered down with vegetable broth) they are both just bland. I was expecting the pf changs version if shrimp and lobster sauce but this was nothing close. It was salvageable with soy suave and thai chili. That said portions are huge, traditional  meals look and taste great so stick to those and you'll be happy."}
{"text":"First time eating at his restaurant. Had vegetables in garlic sauce and amazing chicken. Great portions.  Hot and delicious. Appreciated that environment was fairly quiet.  Service very attentive, but not intrusive.  Will definitely get here more often."}
{"text":"The kobe roll was very good.  Was disappointed with the chow mein...I was expecting noodles (hence the mein) but it was shredded cabbage instead. I should have been tipped off when they asked about rice...  Meh...pretty bland."}
{"text":"Great place for dine in and take-out. Usually don't have a problem making special dishes or customizing dinner orders."}
{"text":"The food is good and the service is great, all for a fair price. I particularly like the sushi."}
{"text":"I love the Curd. I stop by here for lunch at least once a week, and have been coming here for years with my family, as it is far and away the finest Chinese restaurants in Washington County, and as good as a couple of the truly authentic Sichuan greats in Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh, PA.   I often will order sushi/sashimi platters/pieces for lunch, but their 3 cup chicken on the Kitchen special menu, and their Spicy Chinese beef dishes on the same special menu are outstanding.  I've had the classics here also, General Tso's, Sesame Beef, Wonton Soup, they are all wonderful."}
{"text":"First time placing a delivery order with them. I usually pick up but unfortunately unable to drive due to my highrisk pregnancy. It took them an hour in a half to deliver our food even tho they are located only 3miles away from my home. Delivery guy came and asked me to check my food before he left which turned out to be soggy and cold. So he then says \"ok I'll bring back and cancel\" like are u serious? My children and I waited all this time for dinner and that's it? Very unapologetic which is crazy cause we always pick up food from them and they are usually kind. Guess they are just not suitable to deliver food. Never again!"}
{"text":"The general tso's chicken is the best you can get in the Pittsburgh area. Crunchy, with sparingly used delicious sauce. It tends to be the only thing I really get here. The dumplings are quite good as are the egg rolls. I have had the pad Thai, which is really good as well. I would also recommend the chicken lo mein. Delivery seems to be just as good as the food you get in the restaurant. You have other options for Chinese in the area - Benichopsticks and Sesame Inn, just a stone's throw away. But this place is my favorite."}
{"text":"Our family's favorite Chinese restaurant! We come here pretty frequently... Their food is amazing and we love the staff!  They're always super friendly and they never disappoint! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food and service is awesome! The flavors all blend well but I always have inconsistent cooking. Sometimes I go and everything is cooked perfect, my General Tso's is moist, crispy but not overcooked. Other times I go and everything is completely overcooked. If they could have more consistency they would have 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I can't believe we have not ate here in the years we lived here.  Love the food and the service is very good.  The mirrors through me off.  Looked much bigger.  But that was the point, I guess."}
{"text":"Solid non-fast food Chinese restaurant.  The restaurant is large, nice, and clean.  It even has a bar.   Large menu with healthful options.  It is rare to find a Chinese restaurant like this in this area.  We had wonton soup, the three cup chicken and the orange beef and they were really good -- ingredients were fresh except the wonton soup dumplings.  I would skip the wonton soup.  Great service though.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Absouloty the best Amazing Chicken in town! We Tried the OMG roll last night d it was OMG! It was on fire and tastes great.  Great service very friendly people. Priced right!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here. The food is very good and the servers are always very nice. I prefer to order sushi rolls from here, and recommend anything with shrimp tempura, since they do an excellent job with it."}
{"text":"Some of the best Asian food that I have had in Pittsburgh. It's affordable, fresh and very tasty. I'm mostly vegan, so options here are more than most other restaurants. There's a lunch buffet, but I never are from it because vegetarian options are less."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill.  Ordered Ma Po Tofu spicy ... would have been more tasty if it was boxed and frozen.  Absolutely flavorless and seemingly uncooked."}
{"text":"Location: This resturant is a bit small so make sure you leave some extra time to get a table. There is plenty of free parking and they also offer delivery.  Food: The food at this location is remarkable! The specials that change each week are always tasty and fresh. The food is in enormous portions and displayed in an elegant way. I had the tofu, eggplant, veggies served over rice in a brown sauce. I absolutely fell in love!!   Service: The service was fantastic, they are a bit chaotic on a weekend night but they were super attentive to anything we needed.  I would go back again and may soon!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant years ago, and had their lunch buffet. I never imagined that their sit down dinner selection would be as good as it was. I was very impressed! Huge, and I mean HUGE menu. In addition, the wine that I ordered was very generously poured (always a good thing).   We arrived later, almost closing time (which I hate to do, but we were starving & had a long day) The server was pleasant, and willing to please regardless of the time. Service was quick, and our food came out in no time! Had sushi, seaweed salad, and two entrees that we couldn't have been happier with.  Oh, by the way.. HUGE portions. I had lunch for the next 2 days.  Will go back! Recommend for sure."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food In McMurray.  The shusi is not bad either"}
{"text":"My step son loves the general tso's chicken from here. I've recently tried their Thai style red curry chicken and it was excellent."}
{"text":"Bean curd is excellent. Great staff and AMAZING food and sushi! Very consistent. We get delivery almost once a week. All the drivers are great but Nick in-particular goes out of his was for us and is so kind and and cares and knows us on a first name basis! Highly recommend bean curd for your next Chinese delivery!!"}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and shocked to find a Chinese restaurant that delivers! The food is really good and not overly salty like most Chinese food. Did not care for the spring rolls but the crab ragoons were great! We will be eating here again..soon..maybe today in fact, since I'm craving it while writing this review!  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Last night was my first experience at the Bean Curd. I'm giving this place 3 stars for two reasons: first, the prices on the menu on their website is a lot cheaper than the prices on their menu in the restaurant (which is what I was charged). It is what it what it is, but it's a little annoying. Just update the menu on your website lol. And second, the sushi was just mehhhh. It wasn't terrible, but nothing worth getting.  However, the dinner entrees were delicious! I got the honey walnut chicken with a side of fried rice. It tastes great and the portions were huge. My husband got the subgum (triple meat) friend rice and the container was jam packed and his wonton soup was so flavorful. We will definitely be back to the Bean Curd, but we'll pass on the sushi."}
{"text":"Great place to get sushi and share rolls with others. My recommendations are the Philadelphia Roll, Dragon Roll, Spicy Tuna, and the Spider Roll. There edamame is good but could use a little more salt in my opinion, but other than that great service and doesn't break the bank with great sushi."}
{"text":"Not bad. Not great.  Being a vegetarian and half Asian, I'm always on the lookout for some great Asian food with tofu. Imagine my surprise to find a place called \"Bean Curd.\"  Ordered the spring rolls. I'm not sure if there was a mistake but they served me, what looked like, vegetable egg rolls, minus the egg. Not, horrible, but not a lot of flavor.  Main dish was General Tsao tofu. Very sweet, not really my preference. But, I know most Asian restaurants around here have to modify their recipes to meet the typical palates of the locals. So, they turn on the sugar and lower the spices and heat.  So, if you're from western PA and like other Asian restaurants in this area you'll probably like this one, too. If you're from the south, Asia or New England and you like bold, authentic flavors, you'll be underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Bean Curd has been one of my favorite spots for quite some time now, and I've never left disappointed. Last Friday's visit was consistent with prior visits, and I'll definitely be going to Bean Curd again in the future.  We ordered an appetizer of crab rangoons, and I got my typical Philly Roll and another special roll from the menu. Everything was great, just as expected. My friend ordered several special rolls including the OMG roll, which was served on fire. The presentation and the actual food were both enjoyably different, and the staff is always friendly and accommodating. Food never takes long, either, which is always a plus.  Through the several visits I've paid to Bean Curd, I've found the environment to be welcoming and warm. It's a great place to chat over dinner and catch up with old friends. The only drawback I've ever experienced is that they don't sell wine by the bottle. It can get expensive for tables of multiple people that would like to enjoy some Chardonnay alongside their sushi, but that's all. Overall it was a very good experience."}
{"text":"I was passing through the area for work, and decided to stop here for lunch to try the vegetable dumplings and sushi.  The ginger salad came out first, and was fresh although a bit watery.  I sat in a booth, and every time the man behind me moved, he inadvertently jarred me - which was pretty annoying considering he made several trips to the buffet.  My vegetable dumplings arrived next. They looked like giant doughballs.  Unfortunately that's what they tasted like, too.  The dough was very thick and chewy.  The sushi came out right after the dumplings. I ordered a Philadelphia and vegetable roll.  They were both alright, but not worth a return visit."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed so many visits to Bean Curd over the past few years.  They have the classics like General Tso's, which is really nice and crispy with a great sauce.  I also enjoy the Chow Fun or Wide Noodle dish they serve.  It's also a great place for sushi.  It's a really comfortable atmosphere, but if you just want to pick-up an order on a weeknight, it's also very reliable with nice portions. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"MUCH better than Sesame Inn.  Good food, good menu, good service whether eat-in or take-out. We've eaten there many times."}
{"text":"This visit was just ok, very uncharacteristic for Bean Curd. Starting off with the Boneless Spare Ribs which were good, tender, very tasty. The bbq sauce was really good. I had the Double Sauteed Pork with fried rice. Sauce was ok, nice kick to it, but a little bland on the flavor. The fried rice was good. Family had the Orange chicken. Chicken was ok, the Orange sauce lacked in flavor, which like I said is uncharacteristic for Bean Curd. Underwhelming this time which is a first for here, so hopefully if we go back, it'll be better."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times over the past several years and can recommend this restaurant.  It's very solid quality Chinese food and sushi.  They don't use MSG like a couple of other places in the neighborhood.  The place is very nice, although they need to turn the TVs off.  Why do we need to listen to Fox news while trying to enjoy our meal?  The staff and service are very good.  I usually go for the buffet, which is well tended to and hot.  I like the chicken with mushrooms and the twice cooked pork with cabbage.  The salad had a lot of brown today but is usually ok.  The hot and sour soup is pretty good as well.  Everything is aok and the prices are fair as well.  It's one of the best in the Pittsburgh area and is probably why it has so many stars from the locals."}
{"text":"This restaurant has become a regular staple in my restaurant dining. I used to frequent other Asian restaurants, but the other places lost the consistency they were known for.   The item I most commonly get is sushi. The fish is exceptionally fresh and on most occasions the rice and nori are equally as good. Conservative sushi eaters will enjoy the avocado roll. The \"Rock & Roll\" is a delicious favorite - good flavor and part of it is lightly fried.   The best part, and what really keeps me coming back, is the value. The sushi rolls aren't packed with \"just\" rice...they are filled with fish or vegetables. My girlfriend and I typically get stuffed and for approx. $35 (five sushi rolls, perhaps an egg roll or two, soft drink)."}
{"text":"Really good food I had the honey walnut shrimp it was great the food came out super fast. The service was good they are really nice"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Bean Curd for many, many years. I think it has improved a little each year.  Tonight I had the Thai Red Curry with tofu.  It was very delicious.  The curry is mixed with coconut milk with just enough pepper to give it a pleasant hotness.  This was good enough to drink all on its own!  The tofu was also very good.  It is fried just right - the inside was very creamy and soft.  My companion got the steamed vegetables with tofu.  It comes in a neat metal pan.  The portion was so large that she's got lunch for tomorrow.  The dining room for is bordering formal with nice booths, table linens, and a nice ceiling.  But nevertheless it is casual with a HD TV broadcasting football and another TV at the sushi bar.  This is a nice place!"}
{"text":"Back for a second time because the last time the food was so good! We went with the same amazing chicken and orange beef. Both dishes were customized to be less spicy and were just as delicious as our previous visit. Instead of noodles we went with the fried rice as our side. It was great, lots of veggies and also bits of the scramble egg in there. The only thing that made this experience different than the first time was that they did not offer the military discount. Not sure why, or if it was just an oversight, but the waitress said there wasn't one."}
{"text":"I had not dined here in years.  I did not enjoy my prior experiences and was delightfully surprised with this one. The restaurant has an air of class: tastefully decorated, attractive, and comfortable.  My significant other and I came for the Labor Day 2017 lunch buffet.  The selection is tiny compared to the large buffets in the area and there is not much room to navigate at the buffet table, but the food is fresh and delicious.  I was surprised by the pleasing price.  I was expecting the buffet to be $9.95; it was $7.31.  Our server was efficient and attentive.  I could have been happier if Bean Curd restaurant offered bean curd at the buffet, a favorite dish of mine, but it was not available.  We look forward to returning, perhaps for dinner as well as lunch."}
{"text":"We have been coming to Bean Curd weekly for years. They have wonderful food and service! Try the amazing chicken - it lives up to its name. They have a great lunch buffet for a great price. We like their sushi too. I highly recommend Bean Curd to anyone looking for some quality Chinese food."}
{"text":"Excellent food, lovely atmosphere belies the unremarkable strip-mall location. The tea was French press and excellent; my shrimp & snow pea dish was fresh, generously portioned and very good. An extensive and varied Asian menu, excellent service."}
