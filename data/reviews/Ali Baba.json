{"text":"I had a very tasty lunch in less than half an hour, which is exactly what I want from near-campus eats. Most plates that other diners ordered looked great--hummus and baba ganoush in particular. I had a gyro, and it was tasty, filling, and cheap. The tzatziki sauce was particularly nice. The price was also right--it's possible to eat a lunch for approximately $5.

I will be returning often when I'm too lazy to bring my lunch to work."}
{"text":"First time I went here was with a group of coworkers for lunch and we ordered everything that started with an M on the menu and shared it. Was very very pleased. 
Have come back less than a week later and ordered Sleek(a warm kale, bean, onion plate of heaven). Wait staff are very efficient and friendly , even during busy rush periods."}
{"text":"The restaurant is lacking in decor but makes up for it with its authentic, great food. Price was very reasonable."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best Middle Eastern in Pittsburgh. I've never ordered anything from the menu that I didn't enjoy. Be warned however , the website that you will be taken to to order out is not owned by this restaurant and the prices are significantly lower then what is on their menu . Still worth every penny."}
{"text":"This restaurant was on a list of recommended restaurants from the hotel my family and I were staying at.  I have to say both the food and the service left a lot to be desired.  Besides being overpriced the food was over-cooked (chicken and fish) and tasted as if it had been previously frozen.  The koozi was basically all rice when the primary ingredient was supposed to be lamb.  I have had significantly better middle eastern food for far less elsewhere."}
{"text":"Every time I go here I can get something different and love it. There are also quite a few gluten free options, which makes dining out with friends easier.

I also really enjoy the atmosphere. There are always real flowers on the tables!"}
{"text":"I have been in 6-7 different shawarma restaurant and this one is the best I have ever eaten. So delicious and fulfilling."}
{"text":"I just had another delicious meal at Ali Baba's today.  The food is consistently fresh, healthy, and tasty.  My favorites include the Syrian soup, tossed salad, tabouli, hummus, chicken sandwich, kebab, grape leaves and halawa bi-jibin for dessert.  The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the falafel.  It's fine, but their other options are stellar so it's better to branch out.  The owners are friendly and responsible.  I have had a few negative experiences with service over the years, but servers have been excellent in the last few months. Prices are really reasonable too, so you can try a few different options without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"I've had shawarmas in at least a dozen different restaurants and this one's simply the best. The meat is sliced off fresh and put in your wrap. They don't re fry it like a lot of places do. The toppings are also very fresh,and when you eat your wrap.it's not soggy and falling apart like some others do. Return every time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food, and Ali Baba is the place to get some of that good stuff. Their eggplant and potato moussaka is really delicious which also comes with a salad or soup. Although the bill is pretty pricey ($10.95 for a square slab of moussaka), the food really hits the craving spot."}
{"text":"I've had food from Ali Baba before (lunch meetings and the like), and it's always been good, so tonight I went here for dinner with friends. While most dishes don't stand out as being better then other Middle Eastern restaurant, everything is good. 

We got hummus (lots of paprika and fennel, little oil), vegetarian grape leaves (standard, but always a fav), Fatoosh, spinach lentil soup, spinach pie (amazing), the fish entree, and a chicken entree. I didn't try either of the meat dishes, but everyone was really happy with what they got. All of this, six beers (they have no wine or liquor, you're welcome to bring your own bottle), and two desserts was $68. Total steal! 

The desserts were pretty amazing too. We got baklava, it wasn't too sweet, too nutty, or too sticky. A really nice balance between filling and phyllo dough. I don't remember the name of the other dessert, it was farina wrapped cheese with crushed pistachio and rose-something syrup. The cheese was the most mild I've ever had, and the syrup really stood out, flowery, but not too sweet. 

And for being a hole-in-the-wall kind of place, the service is good - attentive and nice, no dropping your check with the food or taking your order and then forgetting about you."}
{"text":"A decent place for a sit-down lunch among the varied options on Craig Street - usually does a booming business with students and workers from the nearby offices around lunch and has fairly fast service considering.

After having tried several of the lunch options I tend to favor the simplicity of a spinach and lentil soup and a hummus.  Some of the appetizers are more hit and miss.  I'm a fan of other dishes like the sleek but it may be intended as a thing to share because it doesn't come with anything else to accompany it.  In terms of local \"Middle Eastern\" restaurants I prefer this over Aladdin's."}
{"text":"Ali Babas is a favorite of my family and i and we've been eating here for a good part of my life! I've never been to a Middle Eastern restaurant with such authentic Syrian food. The Shiska Bob is to die for and the Falafal is absolutely delicious, and I love how they give you a salad with your meal,  and the hummus is delicious too. Very tasty tempting food and very filling. I think everyone should try it!"}
{"text":"Got moussaka. Instead of bechamel, they put american cheese on top...interesting, cheap and not a tasty choice. So much lamb on the menu, it's hard to avoid. Just because it has lamb in it, doesn't mean its Mediterranean. Friend had beef platter. Beef too dry, too well done. For this price, you could get a lot better. Would not recommend"}
{"text":"My family and I love this restaurant... the food is always consistently good and the service is great."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Alibaba for a long while but my two experiences here were pleasant. My favorites were the cheese and spinach pies. Will come back soon to try more items from the menu!"}
{"text":"There is a reason Ali Baba's has been open for over 40 years, good food, great price. I've been going to Ali Baba for as long as I can remember (at least 20 years), and amazingly it still has the same decor, so the interior is a bit dated to say the least. That being said, it has never bothered me because I go for the food and the service. Anyways, Ali Baba's has some fantastic food, they also have some food that is \"meh\". But what they do well, they do better than anyone else and that is why I keep coming back. The baba ghanooj is still the best I have ever had;  it has lots of tahini and lemon (which really make the dish), the meat grape leaves, tabooli are also great (the tabooli is very citrusy ; the sleek is pretty good  too (a little bland but the caramalzed onions on it are great). I usually stick with the A La Carte menu so I can speak to the \"main courses\" but this place is always a good choice."}
{"text":"I'm in Pittsburgh for a conference, and thought I'd grab some Middle Eastern carry-out for dinner. It's Sunday night, I called them up and found out they're open until 9:45PM! I was really surprised, since most places don't stay open that late on Sunday.

I ordered the Vegetarian Special ($6.95 entree), Spinach & Lentil Soup ($2.50/cup), and Baklava ($1.50/piece). I'm saving the baklava for later, but the other two dishes were excellent. The soup was freaking awesome, seriously. It had maybe a little too much oil, but otherwise, it was very tasty. The entree had rice (not memorable), hummus (okay), and baba ganouj (excellent). Yeah, you could totally taste the grilled eggplant goodness of the baba ganouj. I would definitely at least add a side dish of this if you eat here."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch with my family on a Thursday. There were a few other groups there. The restaurant is on the smaller side, with maybe fifteen tables for various sizes of groups. It's a nice atmosphere. The service was fine.

The main reason I am rating this place two stars is their pitas. I had an gyro and my sister got pitas with her meal, and in both cases, the texture was reminiscent of cardboard. They weren't particularly warm, either. Aside from that, though, my gyro was average, as was most of the other food we got (stuffed cabbage, student special). The baba ghanooj was particularly fantastic; it had a great smoked flavor.

I might return if I'm in the mood for some Middle Eastern food since it's so close, but I probably won't be missing this place anytime soon."}
{"text":"My owners have dined here many times, and we never get any leftovers when they do. That is because they usually get appetizers, such as the awe-inspiring Muhummara, a delicious dip made from walnuts, paprika, and (as internet recipes indicate) pomegranate molasses. They have pathetically tried to make it on their own a few times, to no success. Baba Ghanooj is also a wonderful appetizer choice. Our owners often just share a variety of small eats, rather than choosing more expensive and, in their opinions, less bountiful entrees. The value per dollar of the entrees, together with the occasional negligent/unfriendly service, are the reasons for not awarding all 5 stars. Thanks! Meow."}
{"text":"Never ever visit again. Really really not value for money. Just few pieces of chicken in their shawarma which was burned. Much better off with Osmow's. Do not go here ever. Nice staff. But they need to really work on their portions."}
{"text":"Much better than Med Grill and Aladdin's, with just as reasonable prices.

The loobee is delicious, as is the mohomara! I would suggest getting a selection of a la carte items from the menu and sharing them amongst the table rather than individual dinner platters - I tend to be disappointed by the very-well-done kebabs.

Very speedy service, too, and a nice relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Easily the best hidden gem in the area. The place might seem like a hole in the wall, but you cannot beat the food or the price. One of the best Middle Eastern restaurants in the area. My favorite is the a la carte option. Some of my favorites include the spinach and lentil soup, the spinach pie, and the falafel. The falafel is different from others in which it is one falafel topped with a thick tahini like spread. Two a la carte dishes are easily under $10, and you leave feeling full and happy for days. 
Great spot for a quite dinner! It is BYOB with a corking fee."}
{"text":"I find the food here to be bland. I feel like even salt and pepper addition is sometimes forgotten - let alone exotic Middle Eastern spices. The only items I like here are the spinach and lentil soup, some chickpea dish (don't remember the name) and their Syrian-style cake (dessert)."}
{"text":"To summarize the whole exprience, it was HORRIBLE SERVICE & OK FOOD.

honestly have to say i have never been more dissapointed in a resturant. For 20 minutes we were the only table in the place and ordered 2 beers along side the koftah kabob. It took 15 minutes for our beers to arrive and the glasses they gave us had lipstick smudge on them anyways we still waited for our food and after what felt like an eternity my food had hair in it for which they gave me 50% off for..."}
{"text":"I think this is one of those restaurants for those who don't know any better. However I don't think anyone could enjoy their Moussaka. Obviously it had been reheated in the back in a microwave, bec. it wasn't warmed evenly through out the dish. If someone told me that their food came out of a can, I wouldn't at all be surprised."}
{"text":"If you ever been traveling in the Middle East you will be hardly disappointed ... 
Looked so forward to it but the food didn't had a lot of taste."}
{"text":"As I was craving some middle eastern I decided to venture here. The ambiance was nice. I ordered the Ali Baba platter, which included salad, hummus, rice, and per my selection lamb. While the hummus, salad and rice were good, I didn't think much of the lamb, which seemed a little dry and just not tasty. I ordered it rare, which is what my waitress recommended. I feel it could have either been marinated more or with a better marinade.

Since the service was good and friendly, I decided to bump my rating up to three stars. For a restaurant that specializes in this cuisine, however, and the lamb being a major portion of the meal, I expect better."}
{"text":"What food I got to taste was...not optimum. I came in at 1:15PM and the place was nearly empty. I hadn't eaten all day and was ravenous- also moved recently from NY Metro area and missed having a good gyro.  It took awhile to get noticed by the waitress- in an almost empty restaurant. I had a book so I read. I noticed 2 tables who'd come in after me being served- while I also noticed my waitress heading toward the front door not to reappear for 15 minutes. During that 15 minutes I imagined my lunch under a heat lamp.  When she finally came back, she went to the station. Finally she noticed me- and went back to the kitchen. 
   After maybe 5 or 10 minutes she came out. I took one bite. My gyro had big uneven slabs of meat- which were barely warm. Cold pita- a few crumbs of feta (I ordered it extra) and some runny sauce on the bottom- and big pieces of raw onion. 
  I really think she forgot to give my ticket to the kitchen- but even for the time she was in there- who gives cold pita on a gyro? Or can't slice the meat and cook it? 
 When I told her it was cold- she took it back and told me they were making a new one. At this point it had been 35 minutes- and I really only had an hour and had to go so I told her to cancel the order.  She \"apologized\" by blaming the kitchen.
 As I left- I offered to pay for my undrunk glass of milk- and told the owner about the service.  Instead of anything close to an apology- he told me no one else had ever complained about that before. TERRIBLE service and mediocre to bad food.
   I went across the street and got some NY pizza which had a great crust and rivaled anything I've gotten in Manhattan."}
{"text":"Excellent Food with Great prices and very generous portion sizes. I keep going back here time and time again for lunch. Very busy lunch hour so if you get there towards the end of the noon hour be prepared to have just okay service."}
{"text":"If you're into middle eastern food this is the place to go. They are affiliated w ryerson and offer a $10 platter no tax. Which is what I got. Chicken was nice and tender. I went late at night but all the greens and veggies were still nice and fresh. The potatoes were a little bit cold as if they have been there all day and the service wasn't too great. Dirty looking restaurant but great food! Middle eastern music was playing and I felt the vibe

GARLIC SAUCE IS AWESOME"}
{"text":"Ali Baba is one of the best places for lunch in Oakland. The have a ton of vegetarian options, of which the spinach and lentil soup, the falafel sandwich, and the spinach pie are some of the best in the country. The spinach and lentil soup is a particular standout.

Our department at Pitt regularly takes faculty candidates here for lunch. It's a really good option for this because the menu satisfies many dietary needs (including vegetarian, vegan, kosher, and gluten free), the restaurants is a good middle-ground between casual and formal, and the prices are low enough that a big group doesn't eat up too many departmental funds.

Great lunch spot, good prices, and fantastic food."}
{"text":"Amazing service! Great portions--especially the rice and pita! The salad is a must and really is a huge portion as well. I always get the small with feta and it is delicious. I dream about this salad. 

All the workers there are great! So friendly! Very kid friendly."}
{"text":"\"Best middle eastern food in the city\" is plastered al over the walls - I would have to agree.  Highlights include baba ganoush and the moussaka.  Healthy, eclectic , and homemade- yum"}
{"text":"My favourite place to go to. Their chicken is absolutely phenomenal and the service is fantastic. The servers are so up-beat. Brings a smile to my face everytime I go. If you're a ryerson student looking for a cheap meal, they do $6 chicken schawarmas that is super filling."}
{"text":"Always delicious and of the highest quality! Everything I have tried is great but the loobee, chicken shish kabob and house salad dressing are some of my favorites! Oh and the Hummus is the best I have ever had! Quiet, relaxed atmosphere that fosters great conversations is an added bonus!"}
{"text":"I eat there about once a year, and I always wonder why I end up there. Generally, because I am with some vegetarian friends, and the restaurant is vegeterian friendly. It's also cheap, and the serviceis prompt. So, not everything is bad. 

But the food is sometimes decent, but usually mediocre, and some dishes are simply terrible (like the chickpea salad which I ordered by accident: take a can of chick pea, add a few quarters of tasteless tomato on it, a few bits of prepackaged salad, and some kind of humus-based (?) sauce, and here we go...)."}
{"text":"We love Ali Baba and at each visit (over 20 years) we have remarked at how it seems immune from the ravages of trends and time. Sadly, no more. We visited today and they have made some clumsy changes to the interior. It looks like replacing the floor had a snowball effect and the interior just feels less comfortable, noisier, and actually kind of cheap and cruddy. We're sad."}
{"text":"Wonderful middle eastern food. I've never had a bad meal here. Syrian inspired dishes that are delicious and nutritious. BYOB and hookahs are on the wall. Staff are very personable and will assist with explanations of the various Arabic dishes!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go in the area , but you need to know what to order. The lamb shank is the best dish on the menu. The service varies, sometimes it's excellent at other times it is impossible to get a fork."}
{"text":"I had almost completely forgotten about the place, but oddly enough this was the first restaurant I had ever been to in Pittsburgh. A graduate student took me here the weekend I came up to interview for my graduate program. The place is a great little hole in the wall in Oakland that is perfect for lunch or dinner. As a vegetarian, there were a bunch of yummy items on the menu that are relatively cheap. Here, though, I always go back to the falafel, which is incredible. It's good enough to prevent me from trying other stuff on the menu. Furthermore, the hummus/pita is another highlight. I know I can always stop in a have a good meal here."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I was extremely happy to find out that they have a discount for Ryerson students and I got a chicken shawarma platter for a great price. 
The platter comes with rice, chicken, mixed salad, potatoes and red cabbage. Everything was delicious! One thing that really stood out to me was the apple slices in the salad, so good! The serving size was huge and I left happy.
There's a surprising number of seats inside the shop with great upbeat music and friendly employees. 
I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Best shawarma I've ever had! I always get the dinner plate and it's so much food. But the best part is how amazing the staff!! My go-to place to eat now :)"}
{"text":"Pretty sure this place gave me and my friends food poisoning! Would not recommend no matter how cheap it is."}
{"text":"Ali Baba's is a chain and each location varies immensely in terms of quality, size and service. This location seems decent despite being surrounded by lots of other take out and cheap eat options. 

I had a chicken schwarma with all the fixings. It was about a 3/5 on the shwarmometer."}
{"text":"Had #3 a type of lamb stew. Tasty, but not really up my alley. Staff was good and efficient. I would have rated it higher, but we went with friends and not really one of my favorite types. If, however, you like middle eastern food, definately give it a try!"}
{"text":"Nice middle-eastern place near CMU.
I usually get the 'Vegetarian Special' which is box with rice, hummus and baba ganoush (and bread). They also have awesome 'Sleek' which is this awesome concoction of kale, onions and beans.. tried it for the first time today and loved it.
The owner seems to really care about his food... always reminds me to hold box the right way when I get take-out.. seems like he really knows his middle-eastern food.
Awesome place, but a bit on the pricier end, I could get a more diverse platter of food for cheaper at the middle-eastern truck at margaret morrison st."}
{"text":"BEWARE. Pretty sure I got food poisoning from this place. Wasn't thinking right when I walked in and saw how dirty the place is - should've ran."}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty consistent 
I have been coming here a few times

I always get the shawarma with the fries special. I think it's the only location that has this special

I would recommend asking them to put extra garlic sauce over everything cause their sauce is pretty good

Overall, 5 stars for consistency and for satisfying my shawarma craving"}
{"text":"Can't count the number of times I have been here...., the falafel, the lentil soup and the baklava...... Love love love it...,, biggest plus is the price......very very reasonable"}
{"text":"After a visit to the Phipps Conservatory, we headed to an area in Oakland, home of some campus-type fare (it's near U Pitt and Carnegie Mellon). Ali Baba was the place of choice, as my two friends had been there years past and had fond memories.

The establishment wasn't very crowded when we got there at about 6, but afterward, it filled in, mostly with college students. But what a find. We ordered the maza platter that had hummus, baba ghanooj, artichoke and tabooli salads, feta cheese, olives and tomatoes, as well as pita bread. G ordered lentil soup (very tasty but a little different from what I'm used to), and we all ordered the lamb shank, which was in a light tomato sauce and came with rice with pignolia nuts. G ordered some kind of wheat dessert.

The variety of goodies on the platter was outstanding, especially the homemade hummus and artichoke salad, and I'm glad we ordered it. The lamb shank? The only other time I ordered it was at Evvia, in Palo Alto, CA. For  1/2 the price and twice the amount, we had a delicious meal. The meat fell off the bone and the rice was scrumptious. I had leftovers for the following evening.

The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable. The only thing that ruined an otherwise fantastic experience was the lady sitting in the next table. She should have cooled it on the perfume. 

I don't give 5 stars often, but this place deserves it. If I had room for dessert, I would have ordered Baklava, which would have been amazing, am sure, but it would also have wiped the taste of the lamb from my palate. Maybe next time. I will be back when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times, and it's really good.  The food itself is good, but also, you get large portions for what you pay, and can fill up even on a tight budget.

The \"sleek\" (kale with carmelized onion) is my favorite, and so is the falafel (it comes in a large patty.)  I like to order falafel with a side of sleek, and roll it into the pita that comes with the meal - it makes a nice wrap that is both filling and (I imagine) healthy.

The chicken kabob was also very tender and juicy, the hummus is good, and the pita served with the meal has always been warm and fresh.

I will continue to try more dishes here, when I am in the area."}
{"text":"My girlfriend has treated me to ali babas both times i have visited pittsburgh with her. It isn't a large place and has mostly 2 tops, perfect for a date night. 
She always gets the maxa platter. Not sure if that is how you spell it but that is how it is spelled on their web page. 
I unknowingly enough order something else for variety. Funny thing though because we usually end up sharing. Sharing really means me saying\"hey honey would you like some of mine\"? In which her response is \"I might try it but you can have as much of mine as you want\". That's the answer I was looking for. 
On to the food! This last time I visited I tried the \"Fetter Treat\". Which in my experience was lamb on a bed of rice (Not white rice but not sure what kind) with pine nuts. It was very good for what it was, and it came with a small lettuce and tomato salad with a lemon dressing.
I really liked it but I think I would have been slightly disappointed had my girlfriend not gotten the maxa platter. On the menu the Fetter Treat says it is cooked with mushrooms and onions and a savory mushroom sauce. I saw very few mushrooms and not a drop of sauce. All in all I would probably get it again.
The maxa platter on the other hand was pure heaven. I could gorge myself on the Tabooli and Baba Ganooj. The Baba Ganooj had a great smoky flavor and I was really impressed at how fresh everything tasted. With the maxa platter it also has an Artichoke Salad which is really just Artichokes covered in some delicious sauce. Also, huge portions of feta cheese, hummus and tomatoes and olives in the middle.The maxa platter is all cold dishes which is also why I got something hot. 
Everything was really good and we enjoyed our dinner very much so."}
{"text":"we had lamb cheeseburgers with mint yogurt.  great service, wonderful food.  Just as it has been for many many years!"}
{"text":"A little disappointed with the menu. This is actually the Americanized middle eastern food. They have major things on the menu, hunmus, babagonush, but doesn't taste that good. Moreover I was looking for Turkish tea, and the waitress suggested the Arabian coffee is the closest thing they have. How wonderful! In summary, a good eat at a decent price, but don't expect authentic middle eastern food."}
{"text":"Ali Baba's Middle Eastern Cuisine is right Downtown Toronto, close to Ryerson University and Eaton Centre. I was craving for shawarma the other day, found this nearby and popped in!

I read on Yelp that Ali Baba's gave student discounts so I casually asked about it at the cash. They do give student discounts! The lady at the cash was really sweet and nice to explain the deals to me.

For student discount meals:
A Shawarma wrap + Pop is $6.
A Wrap with fries and Pop is $7.
& a Shawarma Platter with fries is about $10 I believe.

I got a Falafel Shawarma Wrap + Pop for $6 flat! They don't add tax which is awesome. Falafel is a deep-fried ball or patty that is made out of ground chickpeas, fava beans or both. Reading the description, falafel seems like a vegetarian item. I have no idea what fava beans are, but this was my first time trying Falafel and I liked it!

Would totally get it again, but definitely, would have to add some spicy sauce next time for more flavour.

+++

I usually get Chicken when I order Shawarmas but I did try their Falafel one as well. I usually get everything in my shawarma except tomatoes. I love turnips in my shawarmas! Totally adds a tasty crunch to it. I also tend to get all the sauces and spicy sauce as well.

When I order shawarmas, I leave it up to the server to prompt me questions and I'll answer them accordingly. Heehee!

The service at Ali Baba's is so friendly and fun each time! Each employee there is always so lively! They ask questions about you and definitely interact with each customer. Their service here is 10/10 for sure.

Though I do wish they upgrade their store environment a little. Their seating is pretty dinky - there is a table in the front that fits 6 on a stool. And there's just bar sitting at the back but it looks really nasty and their tables don't look the cleanest either. They also open up their sliding doors when the weather is warmer which is nice but I also see flies coming in.

I don't mind their environment that much since I usually take my food to-go and eat elsewhere but I do see some people eating inside. But $6 for a shawarma wrap and a pop is definitely a steal, especially in the downtown core! This meal always fills me up and is one of the perks of being a student for sure."}
{"text":"Good place to try Syrian style food. Just not my favorite. Average price 20-25 per person"}
{"text":"My family of 7 stopped by here for a quick halal shawarma lunch while visiting Toronto. The space was very clean, but a but on the tiny side so either grab your food to go, or come in small parties. Food wise, I really enjoyed our chicken/gyro plate. We ordered 3 of those, and they easily split between our group of 7. I thought the flavors were strong, and the quality of ingredients very fresh. I devoured the pickled radish/cabbage they give you with the plate, that was everyone's favorite aspect. The potatoes were soft and the meat was very plentiful. Overall, one of the better shawarma places comparable to the States."}
{"text":"I first discovered this place years and years ago when I worked at a restaurant across the street. This is the best middle eastern food I have found in or around pittsburgh thus far. I am Syrian and Greek and grew up eating all that yummy stuff, so when I judge middle eastern food I'm comparing to what my great grandparents and grandparents made my whole life. We all know grandparents make the best food ;) love their kibbeh nayeh, moussaka, grape leaves, sleek, and leg of lamb, fetter treat meal....everything I've ever had here was GREAT.  We always get at least 5-6 things to share between 2 people!"}
{"text":"This is a nice spot for lunch if you are working around Craig street.  The place is fairly small so it can be packed during lunch hour but it is worth the wait.  The food is authentic, delicious and fresh.  The tyropita (cheese pie) and spanakopita (spinach pie) are \"must try\" and the omelet is great too.  It is even good for lunch meetings since it is rather quiet and you can have a good conversation.  All in all is a great alternative to the sandwich places for lunch."}
{"text":"we stopped by ali baba for dinner this week because we were craving middle eastern food.  my so ordered the kafta kebab plate and i had the lentil soup and falafel...we split the hummus appetizer.
the lentil soup, which i had to remind the waitress i had ordered, was the best part of my meal.  i wish i had ordered a cup instead of a bowl.  that and my so's side of rice, was the only reason ali baba received three stars.  
the kebab was okay, not great, and the falafel was a patty with no flavor.  if cilantro was in it, it was well hidden.  the hummus was tahini heavy.  pita was skinny and dry.
service was prompt, but we were there relatively early (7:30pm).
there are so many outstanding restaurants in this category (istanbul sofra, casbah, daphne cafe), i would not go back to a.b."}
{"text":"Student meal never gets old!
Plus staff is always friendly and do an amazing job to establish a relationship."}
{"text":"Great \"hole in the wall\" spot serving Middle East cuisine in a comfortable atmosphere. 

The service is prompt and attentive, yet not intrusive and the portions are big enough that some folks may require leftovers.  Most importantly, the food is pretty darn good, too - as in good enough to put this place on a regular rotation if you live in the area. 

All this combined with reasonable prices makes Ali Baba a great find.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So I've been debating whether or not to write a scathing review of this place as it just opened up.  I understand confusion while you open, but rudeness is just not tolerable.  

Here's the story - I went back on the 2nd day.  I went to order 3 items.  Two shawrma's and a Tabolueh salad.  I see them make the shawerma's, and although small, they looked good.  No issues so far.  But then I ask where my salad is - the lady serving me says \"Tabolueh - this one\".  I look at it and all it is is cucumbers and tomatoes and there's no parsley and nothing is chopped up??  Did she seriously think because I was Asian that I didn't know what Tabolueh was? Here's the kicker though, the owner says \"no Tabolueh today\" and is basically trying to shoo me away.  I was practically this guy's 1st customer.    So anyways, now I'm at the cash and I have 3 items and the owner goes \"two items only\" and I say \"I'm picking up something for a friend\" and instead of saying \"3rd one is regular price\", he says to me \"I don't care, two items only\".  

Like really? That is so freakin rude!!!!  Who the hell says \"I don't care\" to a customer???

While the shawerma's were good, they were tiny and wasn't that great of a deal for $1.50.  It was like the size of a small Timmy's wrap and you need at least 3 of those to fill you.

And to add injury to insult - on the 1st day, coworker and I asked when the specials would go to and the owner said Monday to Wednesday.  Another coworker went there on Wednesday and specials were over.  So dishonest people here.

Verdict: Sorry new business, I hate to do this to you, but if you are going to treat your customers like crap,  be dishonest, you don't deserve a good review.  You are not doing people a favour by making them pay for food - customers are the ones doing you a favour by trying to help you make a living.  Treat people with respect, just because you own the restaurant doesn't mean you have the right to treat them like crap."}
{"text":"Best place for hearty shawarma in downtown, Ali Baba has a fantastic location here on Yonge which is steps away from Ryerson University. 

*Disclaimer: there's some strip clubs around the area here too. Oops!

The chicken shawarma plates here are amazing, fresh, flavourful and priced decently for downtown at about $10. Best of all is the attitude of the workers here, positive vibes all around and an extremely welcoming atmosphere. To go with that, some good music while you enjoy your food."}
{"text":"Best Middle Eastern restaurant in Pittsburgh IMHO. My family has been coming here for 40 years. Great for dates or dinner with friends. Service is always good and prices are reasonable given the high quality. I've never been disappointed going here. I always get the Lamb Shank, Grape Leaves, and Hummus."}
{"text":"I always walked by this place and wondered if I should try.  I love middle eastern cuisine.  One day, I went here for lunch with a bunch of coworkers.  The place was packed and the menu was short, which were good signs of a good restaurant.  I ordered the kibbeh and it was just disgusting.  I've had so much better elsewhere.  It was very dry and tasteless.  The only real attraction to this place is the student pricing.  Dishes here are quite cheap.  Now I see why."}
{"text":"Great fresh food, good service and ownership that cares deeply.  

I eat lunch here about twice a week.  Not only is the food good, but you cannot beat the prices.   It's the cheapest GOOD food in Pittsburgh.

But it's not all about the price.  The food is simple but authentic and delicious.   When my wife have dinner there -- about twice a month -- we usually order another three or four things to take home for the next day.

The service?  You ALWAYS feel welcome.  The wait staff are rushed at times, but friendly.  And \"slow\" is a relative term.  This ain't a fast food restaurant.  Relax, enjoy an appetizer and talk with your meal partner.  

And bring a bottle of wine."}
{"text":"Ali Baba is an Oakland, Craig Street landmark.  With a menu filled with healthy, delicious and innovative selections a 5 star rating is a given.  However, there are many other distinguishing features of this restaurant that are worth note.  Foremost is the affordability of the menu items.  For me student days are a long ago memory, but the search for value on a student budget still resonates.  It is for this reason that it is wonderful to have a place of Ali Baba's Ilk located close to major university campuses.  Bravo to them for keeping high quality at reasonable prices.
At Ali Baba it is possible to have a simple nutritious meal or a veritable feast.  Their Baba Ghanooj is the best in the city.  Meat or spinach pies are always tasty.  On a cold day how about some Syrian or Spinach an Lentil soup?
My personal favorite is baked kibbee soaked in hot sauce or a milder version served with cucumber and mint yogurt.  The Ali cheeseburger, made with lamb meat and served on pita bread is like none that you have ever had.
For the feast, bring some friends to share.  Rice with pignoli nuts is simple and unique.  Kebabs, stuffed cabbage or grape leaves are great lunch or dinner fare.  Healthy, tasty vegetable selections include a variety of salads, the Tabooli salad with bulger wheat and a lemon juice dressing is primo.
Don't forget dessert.  All their desserts sound wonderful, but I've only had Baklawa, why stray?  Of course you should order Arabic coffee.
There is frequent staff turnover,  but all are enthusiastic, friendly and very efficient.  Get there off rush and be sure to be to class on time.  The owners treat guests like family.  Location can't be beat.  If you are traveling in from the burbs you are walking distance to universities, museums, places of worship ...
Ali Baba also offers take-out and delivery to satisfy that craving in your own house if so chosen.  
For combination of taste quality, value and convenience Ali Baba receives my highest rating.  Enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. The food is consistently excellent and VERY reasonably priced. I especially love the cheese pie and baked kibbee, but everything on the menu is pretty delicious!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 4 stars because the food really is delicious, but its just a few things that make my meal less enjoyable. First, it's a great place to grab lunch for Ryerson students! The special used to be $5 for a beef or chicken shawarma pita and a can of pop, but I think they have increased the price to $6 or $7 recently. The shawarma is quite good, but I can't help but compare the quality to Sababa in Thornhill where I live (that shawarma is a perfect 5/5). Their options for pop are by an interesting middle eastern brand - I usually grab the orange or pink can. One female employee in particular (I'm not sure if she still works there) is very friendly! She goes out of her way to learn your name and ask you questions about your day/what you study/etc.

I gave this place 3 stars because of the overall cleanliness of the store. I wish they boarded up the large glass panel at the front of the store with actual glass, instead of leaving it empty during the summer. Flies come in and hover all over your food and table. One landed on my pita and I lost my appetite right away. The store is located next to Zanzibar (the downtown strip club) and attracts a lot of weirdos and loud drunk people to hover around the front of the store."}
{"text":"You know you're getting consistent value for your money. The food is delicious, especially the Chicken Shawarma."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite places in Oakland! I love the atmosphere and it's a great place for lunch.the wait staff is really nice and I feel like the owner is always here seating guests.  The food is absolutely delicious everything I've gotten here has so much flavor! And I can't get enough of the bread. I always ask for some to take home and they're always more then welcome to bag some up for me!"}
{"text":"Quite a nice place (convenient location and reasonably priced too). Had the student special (rice+lamb+salad) and baclava here - both were quite good."}
{"text":"My favourite place in Toronto to get a chicken shawarma plate! Huge portions and delicious chicken shawarma. The staff are so fun and nice too! The last time I was here, they were dancing and singing while interacting with all the customers who walked in."}
{"text":"This place has the best hummus in town!  

Their menu offers a great variety of food that's always very fresh.  I usually get The Healthy Variety for lunch and I've never had a bad experience at this restaurant. 

If you go on your lunch hour, do it on a day where you can spend more than an hour at lunch bc the service is SLOW and the kitchen is even slower!"}
{"text":"I cannot get enough of this place. 

My mother, aunt, and I used to meet here once a month to enjoy platters of Raw Kibbie,  Sleek, and all the Hummus and Pita Bread we could eat. My Aunt passed away about 4 years ago and my Mother and I just went back for the first time. 

The food was still delicious. I cannot get enough of the delicious food. The Raw Kibbie is a must try: it's raw lamb meat and it is to die for. If you like Sushi, you'd like this.

The Sleek was prepared beautifully and the roving orders of Pita Bread just topped the whole meal.

I am actually planning on grabbing take out from here for dinner at work tonight. 

Love it!"}
{"text":"Ali Baba has been somewhere I wanted to try for a while, but I just came in a few days ago with a friend. We had an hour for lunch, and this was within walking distance of CMU.

First, if you have a strict hour for lunch, this is not the place to come. Service is not a priority. You will be brought your food and not much else and need to ask for a check. This part could really be improved.  We were in the, mostly deserted, restaurant for an hour and fifteen minutes, and we rushed the waitress.  She was sitting at a table playing on her phone for most of our lunch.

The Falafil Wrap ($6.45) was OK.  The falafil part was yummy, but the pita was slightly chewy, which was odd.  As others have mentioned the tahini sauce here was a bit more unique and very savory.  I found it too be almost sour tasting but not in a bad way.  Unfortunately, it was a bit over-powering for the wrap and would have been better on the side.

All in all, a cheap and decent stop for lunch on Craig Street but not terribly special."}
{"text":"Gyro and hummus were delicious! Husband had the grape leaves and loved them. Great prices!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a few friends and had a good time. The prices are low for lunch specials, the service was great and the ambiance was very relaxing and welcoming.

We shared a bunch of small plates and I really enjoyed the hummus and tabooli salad, something I've had many times and theirs was quite good. Two dishes I had never tried before and loved were the fatoosh (a salad similar to tabooli) and mohomara (a delicious spicy dip made with ground walnuts and paprika. It was so flavorful and meaty, it could fool any meat lover into thinking they're eating ground beef!)

We also had a spinach pie and a meat pie with ground lamb. The dough was very flaky, but I was not thrilled by the spices in either pie.

I would still give this place another try and explore some of their other dips and entrees."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place!  I'm a little biased, because I grew up on middle eastern food and this has the authentic taste of home. I come here all the time for lunch, and sometimes for dinner. I'm always seated quickly by the friendly staff, and the service is very prompt. They are also great about splitting the bill if you need it.

Some favorite food items:
Spinach and Lentil soup
Vegetarian Special
Healthy Variety
Hummus
Baba Ghanooj
Spinach Pie
Grape Leaves
Tabooli

Can't speak to the meat dishes, but vegetarians can always find something delicious here!"}
{"text":"Food is very good and fresh. I really enjoyed the lamb kabobs and did not find them to be overcooked. The Baba Ganoush is really good and a huge portion. The desserts and coffee were outstanding as well. A great place on Craig Street."}
{"text":"Great restaurant if you're in the market for middle eastern. The food is good, the portions are large, and the price is right. We've been going here many years and have never been disappointed. Be sure to try the baba and the kibbie!"}
{"text":"One of my go-to options for delivery through Wheel Deliver. Love their hummus but I'm not so crazy about their baba ghanooj which is weird for me because I usually love baba and hate hummus; thanks for messing with my brain Ali Baba! The fatoosh is usually amazing (though there have been a few inconsistencies in quality) and the mujaddara is quite good. The falafil and stuffed grape leaves are skippable here as far as I am concerned. The pita is fantastic, and they give you tons of it with to-go orders or delivery, big plus! When dining in, I always truly appreciate the pleasant design of the restaurant, although it's a bit run-down and dated (dated 1982, actually). The best thing about Ali Baba, is the font used for the restaurant name; it adds to the character and appeal in a way that I feel unable to explain."}
{"text":"A fan because its in a convenient location and it's cheap. Good baklava. Good service.  Decent food. Nice mellow atmosphere. Good place for a business lunch. Casual dress."}
{"text":"I've come here several times, both for lunch and for dinner, though it's been awhile.  The appetizers here have been pretty good--I've had the hummus and the tabbouleh, and both have been flavorful.  The entrees here have been more nondescript, however.  If you come for lunch, the homemade yogurt is surprisingly good.  It's savory, so don't expect something sweet like many store-bought yogurts, but it's very thick and creamy, similar to Greek yogurt.  Service has been slow every time I've come here, so be sure to take this into account--don't come here expecting a quick lunch.  Prices are inexpensive, so it's a good option if you're looking for a meal that won't break the bank.  Also, it's a good option for vegetarians.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Ali Baba has become my go-to for Middle Eastern fare in Pittsburgh.

I've ordered a few different things but the absolute best thing on the menu is the lamb shank, which a waitress recommended as their specialty. She was so spot on. The meat is juicy and fall-off-the-bone tender, and the tomato-based broth is seasoned perfectly. Yum! The salad is great (no surprise there, I'll eat anything with that lemony Middle Eastern dressing) and the kabobs and hummus are pretty good, but beware of the baba ghanouj...sometimes it can be very bitter if they make a bad batch.

The service is slow as hell, always. Not a quick eat, but satisfying if you have the time. Delivery is available through Wheel Deliver."}
{"text":"I'd think most of my Yelp buddies won't care about this review, but oh well! It was way overdue. 

This place is really close to my (former) school and some of the communities at school loved to throw events there or bring their foods at school events. So, I have tried most of their foods either inside the restaurant or at school. 

This is supposed to be a Syrian cuisine but you'll find some Persian foods in their menu such as shish kabob or koobideh (Kafta). And sure, I've heard so much arguments about whether or not Shish kabob or koobideh are Persian, so don't contact me on this unless you have a time machine that can send me back to see it for myself.  

Generally speaking, their rice is bland, their beef is dry, and Spinach pie is meh. I like their pitta bread, lentil soup, and tossed salad. Fatoosh is also a hit or miss... 

I haven't heard of any other middle eastern restaurant near that area and if you really crave this kind of food, I'd suggest to go here but don't expect much. Service is friendly but inefficient. 

The location is great and its nice and clean... It has been there since 1972 and is pretty popular. It is also big enough compare to other restaurants in the Craig street. And you can have a nice walk around it when you are done eating! There are coffee shops, bookstore, boutiques, people walking, etc!"}
{"text":"Perhaps I didn't order the right item, but I didn't think much of the chicken delight. Actually in hindsight, even the name of this item sounds suspiciously generic. In any case, the chicken and rice were both fairly unmemorable, as well as a bit expensive. In particular, the chicken was way over-sauced and the rice rather dry. The pita bread was pretty meh as well. And for some reason the waitress seemed a bit out of it (maybe because it was late and a cold day).

Probably wouldn't come back here; I got a much better vibe from say Aladdin in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"Previous reviews have it right on the dot.  I went there for some good counter service before enjoying my evening with my boyfriend.  The guy behind the counter messed up our order and instantly became quite rude.  He then insisted that we pay extra because of his mistake after our transaction had gone through and had spent over twice as long waiting for his fish to come out.

He tend refuses to hand off the food that we have already paid for.  The whole experience got highly confrontational.  I suggest everyone AVOID this place.  Go somewhere else unless you want to be treated like garbage because the guys behind the counter can't get your order right."}
{"text":"Long time neighborhood place on Craig St., Ali Baba is convenient to both CMU and Pitt.  The food quality ranges from OK to pretty good. The final bill will be relatively gentle on the wallet too -- an added incentive during these days of economic down turns.

While not necessarily the best Middle Eastern fare Pittsburgh has to offer (I prefer Taza 21), Ali Baba is probably your best bet in Oakland.  In any case, of all the restaurants on Craig St., its value to price ratio is probably the best.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"These guys make an amazing falafel. And the vibe and hospitality to match.  Yelp insists I wrote more so I'll say it again: delicious."}
{"text":"Potentially the most underrated restaurant in the city. The hummus, the meat pie, everything I've had here has been very good. Very understated and relaxed atmosphere. But you will be very happy with what comes out off the kitchen."}
{"text":"A 45-year run says something about a restaurant. In Ali Baba's case, it says delicious food with a rich, yet subtle, spice palette. My wife used to come here as a treat when she was in college, and I've been hearing about it since we met. I'm glad I finally had the opportunity to go."}
{"text":"I've always complained that I've never had a good Shawarma in Toronto. The only good one was in Lebanon. 

Last year a friend (student at Ryerson) swore that this Ali Baba makes the best Shawarma. I told him I've eaten at other Ali Baba's and it's meh. He told me to give it a try, so I did. 

INSTANTLY CONVERTED.....

This has to be the BEST SHAWARMA in Toronto! This is what you do. 

1. Chicken Shawarma 
2. Add Garlic, Pickles, Pickled Turnip, Onions, (you can add tomatoes if you want) 
3. Add a bit of Hot Sauce, Tahini, and Extra Special Sauce (this sauce is special) 
4. Extra Toasted 

OMG, the chicken is so juicy. There's a nice crunch from the onions and pickles. The combinations of sauces are so fucking good. 

** I would also recommend that you order their fries with hot sauce, special sauce and tahini and YOU CAN ADD EXTRA GARLIC. 

This experience will leave you so garlicky and happy! I come here often as it's so close to work. 

Thanks Friend for changing my life!"}
{"text":"I generally get the falafel for 5 bucks. Really tasty and it makes two meals. The decor is kind of weird, if it were solely a take out place I'd like it even more."}
{"text":"Fatoush is a fun word.  And delicious! 

I've eaten here many times, but am just now getting around to posting a review.  My usual is the fatoush.   The babaganoosh and hummus are also very very good.  

This past time I was absolutely famished so I didn't think a little salad would do the trick, so I got the spinach pie.  It was good, but not what I expected.  I think I expected something like spanikopita but this was more tart - I think maybe because they added lemon juice.  The dough was good though.  A bit dissapointed in my meal, but it filled me up.  I've had such great experiences every other time, that one set-back on one menu item won't turn me away."}
{"text":"This is a great deal for the price, and very delicious, too (at least for most dishes). You will get large portions and pay little, if you choose from the a la carte menu instead of the platters. I would recommend getting a few a la carte items. 

The baba ghanooj is my favorite. So is the spinach and lentil soup, which has a very unique taste with lemon juice. So is the kibbe; one of the best I have had ever. So is the halwa bi-jibin (which is dessert made of dough, pistachios, and rose water). There was one point in time I was addicted to this dessert. 

The \"healthy variety\" and \"vegetarian special\" are combination dishes, which are even better deals. I usually replace the hummus in the special with baba ghanooj since I think their baba ghanooj is a lot better. Grape leaves are OK, but the veggie version is  not as good.

The portions are large enough that if you get three items, you will likely have stuff to take home. And some items (dips) come with pita bread. 

I often take out from Ali Baba, and they have always been timely.

My girlfriend says the open faced hummus pita is excellent, but Ihave not tried it. 

The only bad experience I had: mousakka is not real mousakka. It feels synthetic. Don't even try it."}
{"text":"Loved the food & service here. The best middle eastern food that I have discovered in this area. Super friendly & helpful staff. I went here 3 times this week and love it here. Had the chicken swarma wrap, beef swarma wrap and chicken/beef dinner. The sides are also excellent such as fries, potatoes, salad. Everything is very fresh and juicy. They even give you $2 off each order if you order for pick up using Ritual. Love it here and would come back again for eat in or take out (Ritual)."}
{"text":"I'm rather sad after two years of living in Pittsburgh I made my first visit to Alli Baba last night.

I must say I was very impressed.  The dinner menu includes around 10 entrees and 15 \"a la carte\" items.  Everything I sampled of my friends was very tasty, well seasoned and very satisfying.  The hummus, baba ghanooj, salads and soups were all obviously made in house, not too garlicky but had a good punch of acidity that I often miss in this type of fare.

If I was closer to Oakland I would frequent this place for lunch.  I feel like it is similar in quality to Istanbul for lunch, but crushes Istanbul's Larryville location for dinner, without question.

Beer only, Wine is BYOB without a corkage from what I could tell.

Lastly, @ Jenny.  I also had the Moussaka.  It was very tasty, and if you think something like this (or lasagna, souffle, etc) is not going to be reheated from a big platter they made earlier that day... you're fooling yourself."}
{"text":"I ate here almost every week when I went to Pitt. The kibbeh was amazing and I didn't have to get on a bus to have a decent inexpensive lunch. The folks are friendly and if you're a regular, they'll treat you well."}
{"text":"Great option for lunch close to CMU: decently healthy food for a reasonable price. I don't like eating their in the evening because it's kind of dark and dim but it wins over the other places in the area if I am late in the office."}
{"text":"Ali Baba offers a simple dining experience with a lot of heart. My best friend and I love to share a bunch of a la carte items and a bottle of red wine. An order of hummus, baba ghanooj, grape leaves, and a cheese pie is incredibly satisfying and puts our total bill under $30. Apart from the delicious food, there's something to be said about the atmosphere of Ali Baba. Gorgeous pothos plants hang from the skylights of the otherwise minimalist dining room. And on a weekend evening, you may notice that certain customers exude a familiarity and comfort level which indicates they've been going to Ali Baba for years. Its reputation as an Oakland landmark is well deserved."}
{"text":"Came here on the way back from the gym having not eaten for several hours. Was immediately greeted by very cheery (and funny) staff. Told them I was very hungry, so they recommended the mixed shawarma plate. Friendly staff, great food, and even better portion sizes (seriously, these things are HUGE). Hands down my favorite shawarma in Toronto"}
{"text":"We had lunch at Ali Baba's and had three of the best vegetarian dishes (and we're *not* vegetarians!) we have eaten.  All three were tasty and well-made. And one, a spicy and sweet walnut pesto, was entirely new to us and good enough we need to learn to make it ourselves. My only complain is that the service was pretty random, but that's to be expected in a university area."}
{"text":"Ali Baba is on a busy stretch of Craig Street near CMU and the museums, etc.  When I grabbed a late lunch today at around 2:00pm today they were still pretty crowded but the atmosphere and crowd were \"cool\" and the service was good.  

For some reason, I have turned into a baba ganoush fanatic lately.  The baba at Ali Baba (say that 3 times in a row and a genie will appear) was very fresh tasting but was a little bit on the bland side in my opinion.  There was a little too much oil (actually a puddle of oil) on top of the baba but there was some nice citrus taste to it.   The large portion of baba was definitely enough for 2 - I brought half of it home.

I also tried a spinach pie.  Good - not great.  Nice and toasted on the outside but just a tad undercooked and doughy on the inside.  Also a little on the bland side.  I wish they had a spinach-feta cheese pie option on the menu - maybe I should have asked.

My last trip to Ali Baba was over 10 years ago.  That visit included an incredibly hilarious and embarassing moment that I cannot post on the internet.  Well maybe one of these days after a few beers I will reveal - ha ha.  

Ali Baba is a good choice on Craig Street but there are better middle eastern choices in my opinion at Kassab's (Southside) and Taza 21 (Squirrel Hill).  With that said, I will try Ali Baba again one of these days.  I am intrigued that Ali Baba has it's roots in Syria so maybe I just need to appreciate the differences and give it another chance."}
{"text":"During the 2017 Thanksgiving extravaganza in Toronto, we stumbled upon this place while looking for something yummy to eat. We had tried Ginger next door--which was AMAZING, so we decided to give it a shot a door over. Oh, what a great decision it was!

The shawarma here was awesome! Fresh, savory, generous. Personnel was funny, prompt and courteous.

We had the chicken shawarma and a special one (can't recall the exact name, but had a combination of meats). Both were excellent! Meats cooked to perfection, tasty, fresh pitas and veggies. Price was also right!

You should definitely give it a shot if you're around."}
{"text":"I just got take-out from Ali Baba. We ordered a bunch of the a la carte items, and there was way too much food. As a note, their website menu prices have been raised by about 50 cents an item, but they're still rather reasonable. I also appreciated that they gave us a whole bag of pita bread to take home.

I whole-heartedly recommend the baba ghanoush and muhammara. They have a chunky texture that makes you wonder if some grandma was pummeling walnuts in the back with a mortar and pestle. I'm looking forward to going back and trying more of their dishes.

The atmosphere inside the restaurant looked modern and a nice spot for a romantic dinner.

Overall, Ali Baba is going to become a regular for take-out night at my house. I'd recommend picking up a couple large containers of their dips for your next party."}
{"text":"Good recipes, nice atmosphere, and an interesting menu are frequently ruined by inattentiveness in the kitchen.  Meats are often dry, tough, and overcooked, though the vegetarian options are still delicious.  Ali Baba is a place with a lot of potential, but it needs more skilled professionals behind the curtain.

(Also, the water glasses are unusually small, requiring many refills and usually causing periods without water during a meal--you can ask for a bigger one, though, something I didn't learn until my third visit.)"}
{"text":"Literally was here and have had about every vegetarian option on their menu. The waiters probably know me by name...
I love everything on their menu - literally. every. veggie. option.  I've never gotten anything that I haven't liked. 
The ambiance is pretty nice and low key so it's good for all occasions. 

The food is also pretty cheap (besides the entree) if you stick to the a la carte menu (which is extensive and large portioned) then you're set! 
I'm surprised more people haven't checked this place out because this is close to Pitt and Cmu campus and the food is beyond comparison! 

Bottom Line: 
One of my favorite restaurants in the 'burgh."}
{"text":"Decent Syrian food in a quiet atmosphere perfect for conversation. They accommodated our walk-in group of 6 on a weeknight right away. Service was friendly and relatively attentive. My kafta kabob was somewhat dry, as was the meat pie. But the koozi and mousaka were reportedly good. We recommend the tabouli over the house salad, which is mostly iceberg lettuce. Ask about the entrees that come with dessert, and then order the baklava. Each order of baklava comes with two pieces, good for sharing half or taking it home, as I doubt you'll have room for both after all that good food! Fine for Oakland, and easily affordable, but I prefer Istanbul Sofra for better Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"Price is a little too high, but delicious food! I'd recommend the grape leaves and anything else on the a la carte menu. Awesome Syrian recipes and an Oakland Classic."}
{"text":"I have been to this place twice and every time it's been a massive disappointment in quality. Once the chicken was undercooked and the other time it had no taste. I mean it's chicken shawarma, how can you get it wrong? I do not recommend this place to anybody."}
{"text":"Oh I just love this place. Great, quick BYOB that always delivers. We actually biked to Tandoor Indian Grill on Centre to use a Groupon, and the building is boarded up (FYI)! I really didn't mind since I knew Ali Baba was down the street and I could always go for good hummus. Theirs is awesome, along with their baba ganoush, falafel and bread. I usually fill up on all of those things so never have actually tried an entree. But the tossed salad compliments the pita and hummus well, seasoned and dressed with fresh lemon juice and olive oil. I've never had to wait long on a table and the service is always prompt. The bf fills up on various chicken dishes, and he is always satisfied. A few times the bread has been dry (I love when its warm and soft) but the hummus is soo good it really doesn't bother me!"}
{"text":"My Pathetic lunch in all it's glory before a single bite. 
At least the portions of this 9 dollar lunch were tiny so I didn't have much to toss out after I tried it. Bland, over cooked and greasy. Just three tiny pieces of meat (about 1.5 bites total) and some canned peas in greasy tomato sauce. Greasy lettuce garnished with a single slice of tomato. They couldn't even bother to give me a fork despite asking for one twice. 
Not going back here again. Disgusting, they should be ashamed of serving such disgusting and overprice food."}
{"text":"It's sad when the best part about the food is the cheap price point. Portion wise, you get a lot of food for the amount you pay- definitely more worth it than Basil Box next door but I have my qualms about their food too. 

However, there was nothing great about the taste of my meal. I had a chicken shawarma plate and everything was bland, nothing stood out and the chicken was dry. The rice was also pretty hard as well as the potatoes. The sauces were okay, but more on the bland side and was not enough to eat with the meal. I got both tahini and hummus and neither sauce could redeem the dish. 

Maybe I'm just used to complex flavour pairings of middle eastern food from mississauga. Would not recommend this place or try it again. 
Osmows and Lazeez cravings for daysss, won't ever settle again."}
{"text":"Ali Baba has been one of my favorite restaurants since college (when I worked there as a hostess!).  Let me just get this out of the way: THE BABA GHANOOJ IS, WITHOUT A DOUBT, THE BEST I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!  It is just so delicious; the perfect amount of garlic and lemon.  If I ever end up on death row, my last meal: the beef shish kabob (lamb works, too), tossed salad with feta, rice with pine nuts, and, duh, the baba ghanooj. And thanks to their delicious sleek, I have been eating (and actually enjoying) kale since way before it was hip to do so. Prices are very reasonable, and take-out is fast.  And the baklava is worth every calorie. My love for this restaurant runs deep!"}
{"text":"Got the chicken wrap - the chicken was extremely juicy and it was all topped off with pickled vegetables, garlic sauce, and a combination of sauces. The wrap was amazing! Everything was extremely flavorful to the very last bite. I suggest asking for only a little bit of all three sauces.

Definitely worth the price if you're looking for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This place makes me hate Craig Street just a little bit less.  Really good deals on lunch specials--I think every option was under $8--and tasty to boot!  I was looking at the student special but really wanted some hummus so the waiter offered to make me a custom combo...sweet deal.  Ended up with pita, hummus, rice that I would call pilaf but I'm not sure if that's technically correct, and a side salad.  The pita wasn't great, but the hummus was delicious--heavy on the tahini and a nice lemon and garlic zing.  The portion was huge and cost me something like $6--and I didn't finish it (don't worry, my lunch companion did).  While our server was wonderful when he stopped by, he was not particularly attentive, to the point where I refilled my own water glass from my water bottle 3 times (albeit, they are really tiny water glasses).  If you're in the CMU campus area and don't feel like going to Porch or shelling out big bucks, Ali Baba is a solid option."}
{"text":"Love this restaurnt - have been going for many years and they never disappoint.  the fattoush salad is great; also, just tried the syrian soup (lentils, potatoes, spinach and lemon juice)  - the best!  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is right in the heart of downtown at Yonge and Dundas. Went on a Friday and as soon as I walked in the energy was insane! There was music and the employees were hyped up taking orders and singing. Had the crazy wrap special with chicken, large size. It came with fries and a drink. The large size was enough for 2 people at a good price of $11! The meal was delish! The chicken was cooked to perfection and had fresh cut fries. Going back to try there other menu items!"}
{"text":"Nice and spicy like I like Indian food. Family operated friendly service. Indian movies in the background. Careful, the plate that says \"whole fish\" is not a whole fish, but a portion. Nice experience otherwise."}
{"text":"What is up with the size of the shawarma? Smaller than my size 5 shoes. I am very disappointed that they use the small size pita bread for their wraps. Also, meat was dry and pickles need to be more sour. Would go again"}
{"text":"Recently, I had been to Ali Baba for dinner and overall I thought both the service and food quality were great. 

For my entree, I had the chicken delight which was marinated chicken in tomato sauce and sliced onions. I liked the juiciness of the chicken and it was cooked pretty well in my opinion. If there was one thing I would change, however, is to add some spice to the tomato sauce. 

The pita bread was moist which helped with scooping up the tomato sauce from my plate. 

I don't live in the Pittsburgh area, sadly, but plan to come back to Ali Baba again whenever I visit Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic middle eastern cuisine in the city, this is it. I have never been disappointed. The food is amazing and the wait staff friendly and attentive. Make sure to get a piece of their baklava for dessert. The only challenge to Ali Baba's is parking. It is well worth it!"}
{"text":"went there for the first time for lunch today. The weekday lunch crowd is pretty big but the service is fast and friendly so they seem to turn tables over pretty quickly. 

My table split an order of Hummus and I had the small order of cabbage leaves (ground lamb). The meal was fine, light and fresh tasting. I was surprised how inexpensive it was...less than $5. Would totally go back for another lunch run since I work in the area."}
{"text":"Excellent place for a quick, cheap lunch.  Menu is full of cheap eats, and healthful fare can be found here too!  I've twice had  lunch there for two for under $15.  The lentil soup and tabbouleh salad are great.  In and out in 30-45 mins easy.  Tight seating, though... most tables are for two."}
{"text":"I have to agree that it's better to order a bunch of the a la carte items than the platters.  I had the vegetarian special here.  It came exactly how the menu described it: rice with pine nuts, hummus and baba ghanooj.  But I was still taken aback by the beige-ness of the plate--when I think \"vegetarian,\" I think green.  (I don't know.  Am I crazy?)  Maybe a tiny bit of salad on the plate?  The plate is less expensive than the meat platters that come with salad--but I'd think that the meat, not lettuce, accounts for the price difference.  But, to be fair, the menu description didn't promise a salad.  

The baba ghanooj was the best thing on the vegetarian platter.  The hummus and rice weren't bad, but next time I'll just order the baba ghanooj a la carte and some other small dishes.  I prefer Aladdin's for its larger variety of vegetarian dishes, though.

The water glasses here are really, really small.  I came here on a warm day and my friend and I were really thirsty, so we kept draining our glasses.  Our waitress was pretty good about refilling them--but I couldn't help but think it'd be a lot easier on her if the place had bigger glasses.   Less waste, more eco-friendly, maybe?"}
{"text":"There's not much to say about Ali Baba other than that it's decent Middle Eastern food in Oakland. The menu is fairly large, the hummus is good, and it's inexpensive. Good lunch place."}
{"text":"I had almost forgotten about this lunch option on Craig St. until my research lab came here for lunch recently.  Although I didn't pay for my food on this particular visit, I couldn't help but notice how incredibly economical the prices were!  Most of the entrees on the lunch menu were $5 or less.  Our table split one order of hummus and one order of baba ghanouj, and I had the syrian style chicken sandwich.  The hummus and baba were very tasty.  The syrian style chicken sandwich was more of a burrito than a sandwich... a burrito densely packed with deliciously spiced shredded chicken and oniony goodness!  It was a huge portion for lunch, a steal at only $5.95.  I could barely move after I had my share of the dips followed by this sandwich.

The food here is decent and you get lots of bang for your buck. I deem this one of the better lunch options on Craig Street, though I guess that is not saying too much!"}
{"text":"This is my first review.  I felt compelled to write about my experience since there are some not so stellar reviews posted here and I do not agree... at all.  Because my friend and I were going to Oakland for a lecture at The Carnegie Music Hall, we decided to make a day of it and go to the Spring Flower Show at Phipps and then have time for dinner between the close of flower show at 5 pm and before the 7:30 pm lecture.  The flower show was great!!  Sorry that I do not go to Phipps more often.  So we decided Craig Street made sense for dinner .. for $6 parked at The Carnegie parking lot after leaving our free spot near Phipps.  I had done some checking out on Yelp to see what might be a good dinner choice.  I was surprised to see some less than good reviews of Ali Baba as I had always had very good food there and do very much like the Mediterranean menu and had always had very pleasant dining experience there in the past ....  but had not been there for a few years....  So by experience,  knowing how often it can be smart to ignore reviews we decided to go to Ali Baba since Mediterranean is generally healthy and has lots of choices and hard not to be in the mood for pita bread and hummus and baba ghanooj ....and then to go from there ... be it vegetarian or meat or a combination.  It was cold so we were happy to get out of the cold and order hot tea and bread, hummus and baba ghanooj while we waited for my daughter to join us for dinner.  We ordered the large size since we were going to share ... the bread, the hummus and the baba ghanooj were absolutely as good or better than I have ever had ... and I have been to many Mediterranean restaurants ... and better than what I make on my own from scratch at home.  Wish I could get the secrets to their recipes!  And the large size was larger than we expected.  My friend and I enjoyed our tea and appetizers and when my daughter arrived we ordered a variety from the a la carte menu.  We shared and enjoyed a Fatoosh sald, rice and pignolia nuts, Bazila, Loobee, and chicken shish kebab along with a second basket of warm pita bread, and more hummus and baba ghanooj since the serving size was more than generous.  We shared and everything was absolutely delicious and my daughter was presented with a large bag of leftovers to take home which included everything except the fatoosh plus baklawa to go.  We arrived early for dinner when there were few diners and few tables were occupied ...  when we left the restaurant was full with some waiting for a table ... but we never felt rushed.  Our server/waitress was enthusiastic, friendly and efficient ... even bringing more bread and additional hot water for our tea bags ... that was a nice touch!
Could not have been happier!!  And lecture was great too!!  Our bill was just under $60.00 for three very satisfied diners and a take-home dinner for a day or two with dessert for my daughter.  Based on our dining experience ... 5 stars!! for sure!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and frankly I don't know why I keep coming back. It's just close to campus I guess. I have always come for dinner but at different times; earlier it's empty, but it can get pretty packed during prime dinner hours. I've tried the meat pie, spinach pie, stuffed cabbage, baked kibbee, kafta kebab (spiced ground lamb meat), hummus, and baklava. The kafta kebab is a solid choice, but several other restaurants serve better kafta. I enjoyed the baked kibbee, but thought it was overpriced like most other items on the menu. Everything else I've tried I have regretted ordering. On top of the subpar food, the service is slow. It's extra annoying because you can literally see the staff chatting among themselves instead of attending to customers. I usually eat here with the same friend and she often has a meeting to catch after dinner, but she's always had to leave before me because it takes forever to get the check. A couple things at Ali Baba are worth trying if you haven't been before, but I will not be wasting my time here anymore.

{"text":"This place is wonderful. Good service, reasonable prices, and a comfortable atmosphere.  My suggestion is to go there for lunch with a friend or two, and order a bunch of a la carte items, so that you can share and try a variety of Middle Eastern specialties!  My favorites are their baba ghanoush, the mujadera, and the fattoush."}
{"text":"Love their kibee and the grape leaves. The tabouli (sp?) is great too! This is one of my \"must visit\" places when I am home from college. :) It is pretty close to my old highschool too, so I used to walk here all the time after school for some quick nosh. Service can be slow sometimes so I recommend take-out!"}
{"text":"The mezza have always been above average, especially the tabouleh and sleek.  Service has been slow both times I've been in recently, which drops it from four to three stars."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant experiences in Pittsburgh! Extremely great middle eastern food, comfortable atmosphere, and wonderful customer service. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I happened upon Ali Baba by mistake -- we missed our reservations elsewhere -- and was pleasantly surprised. We had a huge platter of tasty appetizers and split a lamb kebab and salad for dinner. We BYOBed so it worked out great. The tabbouleh is among the best I've had. I would like to go back for lunch, as I'm not sure I would pay for dinner again. Service was a bit slow but a good pace for a leisurely dinner."}
{"text":"HALAL

Do not go on their website and believe their hours of operation. I was upset one day because by the time I wanted to go eat here the website said it was CLOSED. Well, with the zeal that I had to try this place I still went by and guess what...it was OPEN. Anyways, I got a chicken shawarma sandwich to go. 

The chicken was marinated well and cooked properly with all the tastes a shawarma should have. The pita had just the right amount of meat and toppings. I would definitely go back here and get the shawarma again. The portion and the price are on point...nothing too cheap and nothing too expensive. If you want great tasting Middle Eastern food, then this is a place to definitely try."}
{"text":"I'd seen the Ali Baba hype on Yelp, and I was in the area exploring Pitt, so I figured I might as well try my luck at the purported best Middle Eastern restaurant in Pittsburgh.  It was a fine experience, but nothing special.

I patiently waited in line to order takeout, and got the spinach and lentil soup and the spinach pie, both highly recommended.  The soup was definitely the better of the two, with a strong lemon juice flavor as I usually make it myself.  The spinach pie, rumored to be so good, was a real let down.  Another reviewer called it \"best in the country\"?  Cmon, are you serious?  If I came here again I would definitely get the kibbee or something.

I couldn't help but notice the mass confusion at the counter, either, between the owner and the waitresses.  The takeout ordering system, which should honestly be quite easy, was causing many problems and making everyone a bit awkward.  They couldn't match the tickets with the completed orders with the ticket copies sent back to the kitchen.  

Considering the other options for lunch in the area, I do recommend Ali Baba.  Next time I go, maybe I will have a better experience, but the thought that their quality hinges so much on what you order doesn't make me feel better."}
{"text":"The beer was warm, the skewered beef was gristly, and they forgot about my order.  But the rest of my family had pretty good food.  

Don't let the hostess sit you near the noisy fridge near the middle of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Dropped in for a quick early dinner on a Saturday night and the place was not packed. I did notice the numerous awards that Ali Baba has been recognized for hanging up in the entrance. Ordered the humus to split for an appetizer and I had the stuffed beef eggplant with a side salad. Generous portions, good prices and delicious foods. I intended to not eat so much but I ate up everything! Waiter was attentive and friendly. I do feel like the decor has brought me back to my nursery school days though I'm glad I stopped on by."}
{"text":"Lamb here is good. Lunch is better than dinner with lower price and more choices."}
{"text":"I recently went to Ali Baba's with a large group (12) for dinner. We had a reservation for 10, but more people joined our party and the staff were extremely accommodating. Granted, are reservation was for 5:30, had it been later in the evening, when they are potentially busier, it could have been a different story. Regardless of our party size, everyone enjoyed the food! I had a curry lamb stew that was perfect, while the table shared a variety of appetizers. Several people got the falafel and it was ginormous. I don't know if I'd come back here for dinner, as I've more so enjoyed this as a lunch spot. Granted, the full dinner menu is quite appealing, but I'm more of a fan of the a la carte items."}
{"text":"We tried the chicken and lamb shawarma and it was really delicious. The service was fast and the location was great since we walked everywhere in Toronto."}
{"text":"I was an undergraduate at Pitt when this place opened, I believe it was in 1972. Middle Eastern food scared me back then but within a year, I was hooked. I've been out of the Pittsburgh area since 1980 but have made a tradition of having at least one meal here each time I come back. It's great for my vegetarian husband who can always find plenty of food that he likes. I usually get a chicken kabob, a salad, and some rice. Hummus is a given and (if I'm really hungry or planning on stretching the meal out into another meal for the next day), an order of felafel as well. Parking has always been an issue in Oakland, but we found a pay spot about a block away so no problem. I've never had a bad meal here and enjoy making it a part of my visits when I'm back in the 'burgh."}
{"text":"The worst Mid-East cuisine I've had by far. The service was okay, but the food (couscous) was so bland and had zero flavor. I didn't even like the pita bread. Won't be going back, and I really have no idea why so many people seem to rate it so highly."}
{"text":"Excellent joint for a late night bite. They are open till 5am which is great for people who get back after partying hard. I tried the chicken shawarma sandwiches and shish tawook and also  some samosas. Everything was great. I will highly recommend this place. Loud arabian music makes u feel you are in a different world. The short guy behind the counter was very friendly and prepares your dish with a lot of passion. Good value for money. The sandwiches were $6 and samosas were $1 each. 
Great food at great location. I stayed at the Chelsea and this place was just right outside."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for almost my whole life. Mostly, I enjoy coming here now for the memories that I have attached to the restaurant. Sadly,the food usually disappoints. Mousy recently my patents and I dined here on December 23 after they picked me up from the airport. We are let down to find out that they were out of hummus. We ended up ordering some dips and two meals, lamb and chicken kabobs. The lame wad good, but the chicken was dry and tasteless. Got desert weer got baklava. This also was dry and burnt. Overall, it wasn't a good donning experience. If you find yourself in this area, I would recommend exploring the community, you might find better food else where."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here a handful of times, sometimes dining in and sometimes carrying out.

The food is pretty tasty and they have a good variety of dishes on their menus. I especially like their falafel sandwhiches. I have tried their humus as well which was pretty good.

The restaurant is nice, although I'd say the service is not consistently something to rave about.

Good prices for the food. Great option for somebody on a budget."}
{"text":"They're Muhammara is my favorite thing on the menu. I always get that with the vegetarian special and it's way more food than I can ever eat in one sitting. Their lentil soup is fantastic as well! The price is really reasonable for the amount of food you get."}
