{"text":"This is a great spot!!! Justin the owner has been in this spot for the last 5 years...very personable...small but well utilized space...clean non smoking venue...fresh food...what more could you ask???"}
{"text":"Soup was tepid but it tasted pretty good. I would have sent it back to reheat but we were in a hurry and the waitress was busy with guys at the bar.
Salad and sandwiches were good.
French fries were great."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and no one else was in the place. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with nothing on it and fries and my dad ordered fried chicken sandwich w cheese and fries. The bartender said fries came with it. We also got glasses of coke that tasted stale and disgusting. The bartender was very unattending. The grilled chicken sandwich was chewy and almost inedible. The fries were also gross and not even ranch could save them. The place was clean but that was the only good thing about it. I couldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. Also, the check came and the fries for one meal were included but they were extra on another even though we ordered the same special. I asked the bartender about it and she just said, \"I don't know\" and didn't make any attempt to correct it. The drinks came in tiny glasses and are $2.50. On top of that, they billed the drinks separate from the food so we paid tax twice. I like to support local places but this was just stupid."}
{"text":"Rude ignorant chefs and when I complained to the waitress I got no visit from management to see what the problem was. Not a good atmosphere to take the family for dinner. On top of that the food was not very good.... Good place for drinking but that's about it."}
{"text":"Nice little Bar and Grille located literally on Miller's Run Rd. You have about one foot of space from the road to the restaurant. When you walk inside its clean, and a friendly wait staff. An appetizer of Honey BBQ wings, decent sauce, mild sauce, but good. Wings were decently crunchy, good amount of meat on them. I had Southwest burger, which consisted of a third pound burger, topped with an onion ring, bacon, cheddar cheese, and a mild house made devil sauce. The bun was really good, either house made or locally made, either way very airy and light, really good. A side of skin on fries, which were excellent!! Family had the Chicken Cheese steak. Grilled chicken chunks baked in a tasty hoagie roll with melted cheese and peppers and onions. Overall very good sandwiches with fantastic skin on fries!! Another winner in the Bridgeville area."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the service... they were rude.  Food is mediocre at best.  Low ceilings and as it looks like this is an old house.  Unfortunately this is the only bar in the Cuddy area.  I can't recommend this bar/restaurant to anyone.  Sorry."}
{"text":"On the day we went, there was a group of about twelve guys who had apparently been drinking since they woke up, but they were friendly; I kinda wanted to hang out with them. The waitress, who told us that it was usually pretty quiet for lunch, was enjoying their company, too.

I've been here twice, and the food is pretty good. Their salads, in particular, are huge and delicious, with homemade ranch dressing. My girlfriend drank the house wine, which she said wasn't terrible. It's a nice place for lunch."}
{"text":"A hidden gem!

How have we lived here for 10 years and not known about this place?!

Specials every night of the week; we stopped in specifically for the $3 Build-a-Burger night, and it was great! They have the standard beers on tap with one craft handle, and there were several other crafts in bottles. 

The bartender was very attentive and pleasant. 

Atmosphere was cool and calm, and not too noisy. 

We're definitely going to try this place again!"}
