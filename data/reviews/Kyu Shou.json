The Good:
Friendly service, nice contemporary indoors

The Bad:
MSG (and lots of it!) in their main specialty (ramen noodles); food arrived at very random times and some finished their meals before others even arrived; quality was below average

Overview:
So I decided to take my folks out to try a new place after they heard of my food-ventures. They'd driven by Steeles many times and had seen this new Japanese noodle shop on the south side of Steeles beside Subway, just slightly west of Old Kennedy road. Being a Japanese noodle house, I decided to get what should be their specialty. I ended up getting a Sapporo Ramen, can't remember what the item name was (the item names themselves weren't descriptive, they have light descriptions in the bottom of each item although it didn't help much in picturing what I was ordering). My father ordered a seaweed salad and had to ask for a custom roll since they had no other vegetarian food there, the avocado roll. My mother ordered an unagi roll. The seaweed salad and avocado roll were average, according to my father who has picky standards like me. My mother found the unagi to be tasty but she's pretty generous. As for my meal, it was a soup ramen served with some slices of beef, some onions and a piece of seaweed. The first thing I tried when it arrived was the soup. Right after my first spoonful my taste buds felt completely numb. I couldn't believe the amount of MSG they put into it! One spoonful of the soup felt like I'd just eaten a cup noodle, which as you can imagine, has a lot of MSG in it too. Just, wow. I ended up finishing alright but I had at least 6 glasses of tea! The noodles themselves were OK but the broth ruined it completely. A place that calls itself a Japanese noodle house should definitely invest some more time in learning how to actually prepare a broth without overloading it with MSG! Mine was 8.99 before tax and the portion was average. I was definitely not full after eating it but I didn't expect to be seeing others order similar items. The service was very good though...the waitress that served us was very polite and friendly. At the end, I did end up tipping generously though as I always tip based on service, not on the quality of the food. You're tipping the waiter/waitress after all, not the chef!

Overall, if you're going, do your tastebuds a favour and don't get the soup noodles. Maybe it was just mine (I think my item was H002 or something...it was on the left side of the menu on the left side of the ramen page), maybe it was just that one day, but I'm definitely not trying that again if I do decide to go back.

{"text":"I was here when they first open a few years ago...
Their noodles was pretty good and the meal combos that they have back then was reasonably priced.

But I have seen \"under new management\" goes up for a few times and now even a SUSHI sign went up there...

I almost didn't go in there, as my phone was low on battery, I checked-in while still in my car.
I got the \"Maverick\" badge because of this check-in.

(Maverick - Because ratings are overrated, because you go your own way - and because you'll never lose that lovin' feeling for your city's rugged good looks. You're dangerous. Yeah, dangerous... and there's a badge for that.)

Well... Let's see if the rating really works...

The waitress gave me a menu and a lunch special menu.
The menus are a bit worn(?) and as it's a noodle place, the section of menu for noodles looks \"dirty\" and fuzzy...
I guess the new management has decided to go with the korean/japanese restaurant than the noodle place.

End up having a lunch special - unagi tempura set.
The side dishes that came before the meal was not good...
The edamame, a few of them has brown marks on it...
The deep fried thing (I guess it's sweet potato fries with tempura coating?) was cold and with a sour sauce...
And the miso soup has a weird taste. Like a bad fishy taste...

The lunch set, the tempura was nice, it's hot and crispy.
The salad has a citrus (orange?) juice based dressing? I don't like it and I love citrus flavour...
The stir-fried vegetable under the few pieces of unagi (bbq eel) was cold, and lacks seasoning.
The bbq eel was cut like the ones that you see on top of rainbow sushi, those thin slices.
I didn't eat the korean noodle \"japchae\" as they were sticking together so bad.

This place could be great if they focus on one thing, ie. the tempura.
And if they are korean, may be they can change it into a fried chicken bar (oh, I don't see they have the LLBO sign)..."}

Service was excellent and food was delicious!"}
{"text":"This is INJUSTICE to Ramen.  After coming back from Tokyo and from the Ramen Museum, I thought it would be nice to see another selection aside from Ajisen or Kenzo so to popularize Noodle places in Toronto.

My favourite NISSIN ramen is Kyushu Tonkotsu so imagine my surprise when this place wasn't even HALF as good as packaged instant ramen.

My friend whom's NOT a ramen person didn't even know what to order as the descriptions on the menu was horrendous and it even lead him to misread an item which he was expecting to see on his bowl.

It wasn't the cheapest Ramen either, so my friend was pissed.  I wanted to hold him back but I couldn't disagree with him in terms of Quality OR Value of this place.  I wish they took the name \"NOODLE\" off of their sign.

I felt in some way dishonor to Japanese Ramen by eating it.  Seppuku Disembowelment was in order.  Gomen Nasai!"}
{"text":"Came here on a whim after a yoga class on Kennedy Rd.

We had to ask our server for menus.... errrr should've walked out there and then.

We got served cold tea in a tea pot.... errr okay I think that defeats the purpose of the pot.

I can't even remember what we ordered, it sucked that bad.

Avoid this place! Plenty more options for Japanese around the area."}
{"text":"Kyu Shou Japanese Noodle is a place to go if you just want to stuff yourself silly with cheap food! You will be so disappointed if you are a foodie looking for a decent bowl of ramen. I have to tell you NOT to order Noodles in a \"Noodle\" restaurant!

I dropped by for lunch and this place is quite busy. Lunch starts from $5.99. If you want to try the noodle soup, you can pick from 3 kind of noodle and then pick a side order of either sushi rolls, seafood pancake, dumplings, sashimi or sushi. They all priced accordingly.

I decided on a Pork Bone Ramen + Spicy Salmon Roll for $5.99. The meal comes with bean sprouts and kimchi appetitizer. The roll arrived quickly. They taste ok.. too much sauce on top and it was rolled really loosely.. so when I picked them up with my chopsticks, they were falling apart...

The Ramen arrives around 10 minutes after. OK.. If you are a Noodle place, you really have to spend more time to learn how to make decent noodles!! The broth is white coloured and bland and tasteless! The noodles overcooked, soggy and mushy! There were these funny toppings that looks like something but tasteless.. and not even a little piece of meat......

The services was really good... even with 1 wait staff serving the busy afternoon crowds! I feel so sorry for her, running around taking orders, serving the food, filling up my tea cup without asking....cleaning tables... And all done with a smile!!

1.5 stars.

{"text":"Went here today just because my other ramen place nearby that I would go to has closed down.  However, that was perfect luck for me as I liked the food here better than my old place.

Their prices are a bit steeper than others, but then again I didn't get their lunch specials.  What I ordered was Boneless Beef Rib Ramen (H002) for $7.99 + taxes + tip.  The noodles are still good, and in my opinion still better than that of Ajisen (dunno why people like their noodles over there) and whether it is true ramen or not, the final taste is acceptable.

My wife got a the cheaper lunch special $6.99 for pork bone ramen + seafood pancake.  (Don't bother with the seafood pancake, it's terrible, not okonomiyaki)  However, the soup base tasted better than mine.

To be honest I think they made a mistake in my order, unless they just described it wrong in the menu.  Because my understanding from the menu was that I was supposed to get pork bone soup, but with the boneless beef.  Well next time I go there I'll probably ask for that correction because I think if they made it based on what I expected from the menu it would taste a lot better than what I already had which was not too bad already.

Three stars because as I said, it is not perfect, I didn't get what I expected and I expected better results."}
