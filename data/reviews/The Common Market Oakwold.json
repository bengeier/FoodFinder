{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place. Really big and lots of space and has good vibes, yet every time I come here it takes FOREVER for them to make my food. At the common market in plaza mid wood my food usually took 5-10 minutes to be prepared yet at this one it usually takes 20+ minutes and there are only a few people in line in front of me. They are new and so I believe their employees are still getting the hang of things. Great place if you have plenty of time to wait!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for the first time to check out the retail  beer selection. Which is pretty impressive, not as much for the volume but the quality of what's available. Ended up staying for a pint of a local favorite and sat on the patio, a funky, eclectic spot that seems farther away from Monroe Rd. than it really is. Bright and spacious inside, with plenty to drool over, both on the shelves and from the deli. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nothing will replace the hole left in my heart when they bulldozed the South End CM! This one has a nice patio and the same Common Market quirks that Charlotte has grown to love. The location is a little off the beaten path, so if you want something that is walkable and has the feel of a true CLT cultural staple, stick with the Plaza Midwood location. (Better gag gifts/knick-knacks at the Midwood location as well!) If you just want some beer and a good sandwich with sitting/breathing room - this is a fine choice."}
{"text":"After years of living in a neighborhood often overlooked by Charlotte's finest, we finally have a jewel that we can build off of. Oakhurst is incredibly excited to have our own CM and can't wait to see what new developments heads our way over the next couple years :)"}
{"text":"Great local hangout. Always a good crowd with good conversation. Great sandwiches and food selection of draft and can. Enjoy"}
{"text":"So happy to have CM in Oakhurst! Great sandwiches, great beers on tap and to buy to bring home. Also love that they carry Pasta and Provisions to bring home and Poppy's Bagels for breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"Food was good!!

 the name is Weird you are located in \"Oakhurst\" no where near Cotswold area!!!"}
{"text":"This place rocks! I just moved to Oakhurst and this place has been a lifesaver. I call ahead and pick up breakfast sandwiches weekly! If you're in a hurry call ahead because they do get busy. Great coffee and beer selection too!"}
{"text":"Cool spot.  Great little place to pick up some quick beers.  Don't expect the crowds of the other locations right yet.

Come on, check it out.  Buy some beers, buy some sandwiches.  Call some friends and have them meet up with you here.  Just don't expect to be entertained by crowds of random strangers.  I know a lot of people live in the area, I just don't know how many want to hang out there quite yet."}
{"text":"The food is great.  I was most impressed with the folks who worked there.  Carley was incredible and made my food perfectly.  The choices of sandwiches are amazing.  It only took a very few minutes to complete my order.  I love this place. Why can't all deli's be this good?
I'll be going back alot."}
{"text":"Not nearly as good as the plaza/mid wood location on food or portions. Chicken salad is not as good as the other location - big disappointment. The other person in our party said the same about his sandwich. The cook needs to take some lessons from the original location."}
{"text":"Awesome new location with a great patio and excellent variety of beers on draft. The deli serves up sandwiches with super fresh ingredients and the staff are friendly. 

Would recommend as a quick place for lunch or to meet friends after work for a beer. And it is family and dog friendly as well!"}
{"text":"Stopped by on my way home for a case of nail bin wine. You can't beat the price no bottle over $9.99. Try canyon road wine. Its great!"}
{"text":"Went there on New Years day the soups have great taste."}
{"text":"Very nice location. Possibly better non-beer selection of items and better menu than the plaza midwood location. But no drink specials at all any day of the week"}
{"text":"This is the third common market location I've been to and it did not disappoint! The parking here is so easy! That was the main difference between here and the old south end location and the new plaza location. The food here is consistent with the other locations. My go to is a craft soda and a custom sandwich if - turkey, pickles, banana peppers, bacon, and pimento cheese. It's gooey and since I used turkey it's totally healthy. 

Common market has great little crafted snacks and drinks as well as a wide beer selection. It's a great place to buy some orange juice and champagne and drink mimosas while hungover and on the prowl for indie friends. 

The bartender working at the time was awesome. He was so friendly and very witty. He had lots to say about my soda which made me even more excited about it. (Wish I remembered his name but he was a stalky guy with red hair and a golf like hat. )"}
{"text":"Have only indulged in their deli sandwiches and was very satisfied! Trend on more of the healthy side."}
{"text":"Funky. Quirky, Odd. Delicious.  Although I am still grieving over the loss of their Southend location (damn, I hate this soul-less development in Charlotte), Oakwold hits on many of the same notes.  An added bonus is plenty of room to sit and spread out.

I've only visited this location for breakfast or coffee.  All went well, food was prepared hot and to my liking, and the price is easy on the credit card.  This is an easy recommendation:  Give Common Market Oakwold a whirl!"}
{"text":"Common market has been a Charlotte hangout staple for years and I'm so glad they opened a location in southeast Charlotte. Stop in for a sandwich or grab some beers to go. The staff are friendly and made great beer recommendations when they saw I was lost in their large selection. You can bring your pup and sit in the covered patio area or grab a beer on tap and sit inside or at the bar. Nice place to gather with friends!"}
{"text":"The common market is a Charlotte staple and one of the best places for a meeting, to grab a beer, to grab lunch, to hang out with friends or really anything you want to do.

Thanks for being the coolest business in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Great spot to hang out, grab a drink or food. We had a book club meeting here and loved it. 

It took a while to make my sandwich, but it was yummy. They have gluten free bread and other gf snack options and cider for the win!"}
{"text":"Very welcome addition to this part of town.  Any food I've had was good.  Don't expect it quick, necessarily.  Decent wine and craft beer selection.  Doesn't have the wine inventory of the PM location..maybe still in a growing phase.  Don't expect the same hang-out vibe generally as PM; that would be hard to duplicate, and this one's on a 4-lane thruway as opposed to a convenient walk-up district.  One star deduction would be mainly for the limited parking."}
{"text":"I give 5 stars because there is nothing more they could do better. They are a perfect example of a Common Market. There is a drink, and a food item for everyone from every age and walk of life. You want to sit, indoor, outdoor, at the bar, secluded away, anything you want in a perfectly relaxed environment is here.  always to Common Market."}
{"text":"We have been anticipating the opening of this location and finally had the chance to visit this evening!

Loved the original CM in my younger days but this location fits our needs as a young family with a toddler just right!  It is a large and open space with lots of seating options inside and outside. They have a large bar area and a great beer selection. We look forward to making this a regular hangout spot!"}
{"text":"I love the Common Market Oakwold! I have been frequenting it a couple of times a week since they opened. Working my way through the breakfast & lunch options. Everything has been excellent. Lunch sandwiches are my favorite. It is a great spot to grab stuff on the way home too. This is an underserved neighborhood & I am thrilled to see this place move in & take off."}
{"text":"If I could come here everyday I totally would. They have great sandwiches and salads. The beer and wine selection is excellent."}
{"text":"Very excited to have this new location. Food is great, atmosphere fun and welcoming. Parking can be limited. Try to be respectful of the other local businesses, but it would be nice if the fleet of vans behind CM could park way at the end during weekends to accommodate more convenient parking when the other business is closed. Breakfast stops at 10:30am on a Saturday, which bummed us out at 10:31am. Website says Plaza Midwood stops at 11am, and for Oakwold, still coming soon. Needs an update."}
{"text":"Common Market is Charlotte's version of the ancient Greek Agora, a place where everyone regardless of age, ethnicity, gender, etc. meet as equals and leave as friends. But beyond serving as a great meeting place, it also offers great fresh food prepared on site, an enormous selection of wine, beer, and other non alcoholic beverages, ample seating indoors and out, and a vibe that simply doesn't exist anywhere else in Charlotte outside of the Common Market locations. The newest location, Common Market Oakwood, is one building from Clayworks (www.learnclay.com), the 4th largest ceramic arts educational non profit offering classes to adults and students, providing space for 26 resident artists, and THE pioneer organization which has led to the revival of Monroe Road. Staff at Common Market is uniformly helpful and efficient, and the seating is comfortable, intimate, and provides opportunity to meet and make new friends. Bravo to their newest location for maintaining the essence of the Common Market ambiance and friendliness."}
{"text":"I used to go to the common market on central all the time now that this one is open and closer to my house I go there the sandwiches are really good parking can be a pain in the butt however"}
{"text":"I am so glad The Common Market has come to our neighborhood!

The Oakwold location has all the great things about the original South End location with the addition of glorious breathing room. My #1 beef about the old spots were how cramped and crowded they were, but this new Market retains the charm and spirit of the original with the ability to move freely.

The deli is exceptional. The menu covers just about anything you could want, and the folks behind the counter are happy to customize to your preference. For example, I ordered The Firehouse on gluten free bread and asked \"can I get a bunch of mayo on that?\" When my sandwich was ready, it was messy and slick with mayo, just like I'd asked. Perfect!

The ordering and paying system isn't perfectly intuitive, but it's easy enough to get used to. Order whatever you'd like from the deli, and they'll give you a ticket. Take that ticket with you and grab whatever else you'd like -- bottled soda, chips, other snacks -- and take everything to the cashier for payment. Grab a Common Market shirt or tchotchke while you're at it. Easy enough.

I love that the attached patio is dog-friendly. I'm happy that they have gluten free options. I 'm pumped about the friendly, funky space. I wish this Common Market the best of luck in the neighborhood and hope their success brings other great local businesses, too."}
{"text":"Welcome to the neighborhood, Common Market! I can't begin to tell you how stinking excited I am to have a neighborhood spot between Oakhurst and Cotswold. CMOW is approximately 1.2019 miles from my house. But, who's counting exact steps, really? 

Had the pleasure of attending their soft opening tonight and I have to say, this is going to become a habit. I mean, what's not to love about an amazing local beer selection and friendly market offering up snacks? See ya pretty much every night of the week, Common Market Oakwold!"}
{"text":"I have to upgrade my review for the improvement in service and engaging with customers!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"I started going to the common market in plaza mid-wood for lunch since my school was so close to it. Great off the beaten path of food with loads of different kinds of one of a kind soups, sandwiches and chips you don't see in other places. This Corky little food find is a gem. When you want to try a great cup of Ethiopian coffee or a pure Buffalo Rock soda this is the place to go."}
{"text":"It seemed like it took forever to get here from my location but it was worth it!! Me and a girlfriend came here for lunch. We went to the back deli area to order our food. I got the #8 with gluten free bread (toasted) and no cheese. I'm on a strict diet in case you are wondering why. Believe me, I would love regular bread and cheese!! Overall, the sandwich was very tasty. The meat and veggies were fresh and the gluten free noodles weren't bad at all. I looked around for a bit and I saw they had GATOR SAUCE!! My husband is obsessed with that hot sauce. You bet ya I got a bottle of it. Nice location and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"I love the original Common Market on Commonwealth so it pains me to say that this one doesn't live up to that location's legacy. I came here one morning for breakfast when I was already on Monroe so I didn't have to drive the few additional blocks to the Commonwealth location. I now know that this was a mistake. 

This is my third time here but the experience always seems to be lacking something though the cashiers are always friendly. I think there's a certain sterile vibe since the space is new and the clientele is a bit more straight-laced. 

I walked in and was greeted by the friendly cashier. I placed my order at the window after perusing the specials for the day, I selected their vegan option which was a tofu scramble with vegan chorizo and assorted veggies. Everything seemed to be listed out nicely on the board in true Common Market fashion or so I thought. 

So I order the breakfast to go and am chowing down on my way to work when my throat begins to itch and I notice some hard pellets throughout the wrap. I feel a sense of dread wash over me, \"NUTS!!!\" Now I'm only allergic to certain nuts but the itching in my throat worried me. 

I immediately panic and call back to speak with the  kitchen just for confirmation. 

Me: Excuse me, I was just in there and ordered the vegan special. Were there nuts in that? 
Kitchenperson: Uh yeah. 
Me: What kind?
Kitchenperson: Walnuts. 
Me: (panicking because this is one of the three to which I'm allergic) Ummm okay. Was that notated on the board?
Kitchenperson: Uh no. (Almost puzzled)
Me: Don't you think it should be, being that it's a common allergen?
(This is what got me...)
Kitchenperson: No. It's our brunch special every Sunday so all the regulars know that there are walnuts in there. 
Me: Okay but what about newcomers? I've never eaten Sunday brunch at your location so I wouldn't know that. It should be clearly labeled. I actually frequent the other location for brunch so I wouldn't know that. 
Kitchenperson: Well typically people ask. (Touché)/
Me: I normally ask at a place I don't know but I've always been told that it would be clearly labeled and there as it is on your website and the previous special boards I've encountered at Common Market. There was no indication that the listed ingredients would contain nuts. What was it in?
Kitchenperson: The tofu scramble. 
Me: (shocked) In all my years of vegan/vegetarianism I've never come across a tofu scramble consisting of more than tofu and maybe some various veggies and spices This is not typically a nut-containing dish. 
Kitchenperson: Oh yeah well we put nuts in ours. 
Me: (So annoyed and paranoid I'm going to go into anaphylactic shock). Well you all should really let people know when common allergens are in a special dish on the board. It's as simple as putting asterisks and contains nuts on the board. 
Kitchenperson: Okay. 

I was shocked and disappointed by the lack of empathy throughout the conversation. I grabbed my purse and chewed up two Benadryl and spent the rest of my workday zonked out and shaky. The only reason I'm giving the second star is because the cashier was so nice and because they had Cocomels in the checkout line. Not to mention I let my guard down based on my previous history with the company. Next time, I will just drive the extra few blocks to be with my Commonwealth crew and get my daily dose of hip, divey, positive vibes. They never disappoint."}
{"text":"So happy this is finally open. My wife used to be a regular at the CM in Plaza and we were thrilled when they were opening this one. Great space, huge bar and really nice outdoor area. It doesn't have all the \"charm\" yet of the Plaza location but it's coming along piece by piece, and sticker by sticker. It's kind of fun knowing the locals will be making it their own. The food is always great (Evil Homer on sourdough, pressed is my go to) and you can't beat the craft beer selection (either on tap or in the fridge).  I'd say I'm here close to twice a week , and if you're reading this review you should be too."}
{"text":"What's not to love about this place?!? Cool vibe, cool space, and a good selection of everything.  They even had Underwood sparkling rosé in a can!!! 

My only thing is that it's in a location which makes me nervous if I were to stay out late with a group of friends.  

Other than that...it's a really really cool spot!!"}
{"text":"This  is a great place in a cool new location.  I like the easy access parking lot.  There's not a ton of traffic and it's a no hassle deal getting in and out here.  

The staff was really friendly and helpful when I was making a beer selection.  They walked me through and kind of showed me around, since I'd never been before.  It's nice when someone takes the time to show you things and get you familiar in a new place, so I liked that.

I took my beer to go and didn't try any food, but would love to stay next time and hang out some! Great environment!"}
{"text":"Yes yes yes!

Pros: 
Cool atmosphere
Great local beers on tap
Great wine selections
Great beer selection from refrigerators
Parking
Great simple deli (breakfast and lunch - try the chicken salad)
Amazing coffee (try the bourbon pecan)
Friendly staff
Fun, eclectic vibe 
Good snacks

Cons:
Need drink/food specials 

My staple! Easy go to!"}
{"text":"I've been to the other common markets in Charlotte and haven't had a big opinion on them. I can see why people like them but I was always impartial. This new common market though, I think I will learn to love! I haven't tried their food yet but just based off the layout I think this place is a homerun. The first thing I noticed is they're outside seating is covered. Well, it's kind of half inside half outside but either way it protects from the elements which makes CM a great place to visit on a rainy day. The other big improvement I noticed was inside.  Unlike the other locations, this CM has tons of space. The large layout doesn't give you a cramped and confined feeling and everything is laid out nicely."}
{"text":"Love the newest CM.  Great community spot bringing together all in our diverse neighborhoods.  Fabulous staff with a tremendous beer selection!"}
{"text":"You literally cannot beat having such a great place put a spot right in your neighborhood. I'm so excited they are here!! 

The rustic shop is kept clean and looks adorable. It provides you with so many classic, low-key options for lunch. I love that I can come here and eat vegan and it also can be a place my boyfriend can get a traditional sandwich. Yay for a spot to go without a food war ;) They also have all the beverage needs you could possibly want, from kombucha to beer. As well as snack options and of course a good place to come to buy beer, wine and more for your home. 

I had the straight jacket soy wrap and it was full of crisp, fresh veggies and tofu that holds up like a champ in the wrap. I will work my way through all the other vegan selections. 

You can sit on the outside patio or inside. They have such friendly staff members that it's just so comfortable to swing in here.

We will be returning."}
{"text":"Fresh. Easygoing. Versatile. Cool. 
Where else can you buy a six pack of your favorite beer or a bottle of wine and sit playing scrabble with your friends under swaying Christmas lights year round? Add in the delicious menu packed full of well rounded salads, soups and sammys and you've got a solid experience. Scrabble might not be your game of choice and luckily there are plenty of other options. You can get everything from gag gifts to king of pops in this marketplace type venue. I hear they have fresh juices and smoothies coming soon and I can't wait!! 

I got the Mediterranean salad and the chickenless chicken salad. 

Ps. The coffee and a great and always freshly brewed. Pour it up in a unique mug that will likely read \"I fart glitter\" with a dancing unicorn."}
{"text":"Although I was sad to see Common Market leave Southend, I was definitely happy that they were opening in a new location. After having been now a few times, I am definitely a fan.  I like the layout and the patio, outside but covered, is inviting and has a lot of seating. Once inside there are several seats at the bar and tables throughout for groups to gather and drink/eat and enjoy each other's company.  They offer several beers on tap, but what is the highlight it the amount of options of cans/bottles, of which you can buy one to enjoy or a six-pack, etc.  I haven't yet had their food, but look forward to checking out the menu soon."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what I wanted - So glad I found it!! It's such a hidden gem for wine/beer/groceries/vegan buys/deli!  It's a chill punk themed space with good punk and rock music playing. There's a fun covered outdoor area to enjoy your sandwich/salad/beverage. They also have board games if you wanna hang out and play while you drink!

DELI: The deli is delicious! You walk up to the counter, put in your order and then pay at the front of the store. They have a TON of sandwich options and salads. For breakfast they offer about 8 options and build-your-own sandwich. They have vegan soy sausage and soy chorizo too! I was really surprised how much FLAVOR my sandwich had!!

COFFEE: self serve drip coffee as well as lattes, etc. the hazelnut drip was ok in my opinion, not amazing but it'll do. (If you're not a coffee snob you'll prob like it)

MARKET: fridge of prepared foods, chicken salad, sandwiches, cheese etc. they have tons of unique chips, snack bars, candy, local products and sodas (Mexican Coke!!). They also sell a few gifts and T shirts.  

BAR: they offer chilled wine and beer (& mimosas) to enjoy at the long wooden bar as well as take-home wine and beer. There about 4 tall shelves of take-home beverage options and a whole wall of refrigerated options."}
{"text":"This Common Market is just as great as both the original and the Plaza location, and I actually prefer this layout because it's so open and spacious. The bar in this location is much larger as well.

To be expected, the deli is fantastic--great options for all dietary restrictions at a reasonable price. The bar has plenty of local drafts on tap, and if they don't have what you're looking for I'm sure you could find it in their giant inventory of bottled beers!

I wish this location had a patio like the others--but they do have plenty of seating."}
{"text":"Common Market shows why they are one step ahead of everyone else, again. Oakhurst is an upcoming neighborhood three miles from the center of the city and five miles from South Park. I am so excited to see what else moves to this neighborhood. I wish I could keep it my own little secret."}
{"text":"My favorite Saturday ritual is working out, then stopping by my local Common Market for Snickerdoodle coffee and a bacon, egg, and goat cheese bagel. Let's be honest, sometimes I also sample a beer. The staff is really friendly and there is always a great selection of rotating taps. I'm so glad this opened up in the neighborhood!"}
