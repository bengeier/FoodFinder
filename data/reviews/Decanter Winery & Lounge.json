{"text":"First time here. All the food was incredible. The service was friendly. The wine...insane. My new favorite North Scottsdale spot. Nothing beats it."}
{"text":"Decantur is fantastic and so is the staff. Special call out to Sarah and Sam - they are extremely friendly and take great care of you. The atmosphere is not too loud and their Saturday night acoustic night talent makes for a nice evening with your date. Their wine is also very, very good. Each of our favorite wine's include the Recluse Viognier, Desert Sunset - Peach Apricot Chardonnay, Mandela - Pinotage, and Great BaZin - Zinfandel. Save room for the Sea Salt Caramel Gelato."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened?! Third time here and service is not the same like our fist visit. We waited over 30 minutes for our \"cheese board\". I had to ask for the status of  our food. The waiters kept walking by and never asked how we were doing.   Service is the most important detail in business.  This will be our last dinner here."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential.  The food is solid and the wine selection has something for everyone.  I recommend doing the wine tasting flight on your first visit to get a feel for the varieties they offer. 3 stars because they need some time to get their staff trained and work out some bugs.  It is probably better for lunch or week night dinners until they get their weekend mojo online.   Service, while very nice, was confused and awkward and not at all knowledgeable about the food (they did fine with the wine). We ordered the cheese plate, but no one could tell us what was on it when it arrived.  Still, while of unknown variety, the selection of cheeses was tasty. The bruschetta choices are interesting and flavorful.   Dessert was phenomenal - if you like icecream try the salted caramel gelato with bacon, it will be worth it (but ask for the port sauce on the side so you can decide if you like it before adding it to dessert).    There is live music on the weekends and the outdoor seating is very nice."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and wine is great and food is amazing!  A definite recommendation!"}
{"text":"Way overpriced for what it is. $12 dollars glasses of wine - wine that is made in the back room. $15 for 4 pieces of bruschetta. They have a wine club with a membership fee of $99/month, for which you get two bottles of wine each month. The ambiance is otherwise pleasant in that generic, pseudo-sophisticated North Scottsdale way, but nothing spectacular, and the value is poor."}
{"text":"Have been here twice now and both visits have been great! Absolutely one of our new favorite spots in North Scottsdale/DC Ranch.  There are so many yummy wines to try. (Tonto, Mambo, and Armadillo are some of our favorites.) And if you aren't sure where to start, the staff is generous with samples to make sure you make the right pick. The food is delicious too. We have yet to meet a bruschetta we don't like!  The staff is incredibly kind and attentive. Crazy knowledgable about the selections and always willing to make recommendations. Definitely worth visiting Decantur the next time you are nearby! A great option for a date night OR a night with friends."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is so inviting and the food and wine are delish. This is a great date night spot"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! From the wine, to the food, to the environment I can tell you, you won't be disappointed! The staff is extremely knowledgable and does a great job. Met the GM and he made sure I had an amazing experience! I will definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Attended a Yoga & Wine event at Decantur, and I think that it's phenomenal that they do events like that! Very cool! The instructor was great, and overall had a great time. I like the space, and the decor is beautiful.  4 stars only because once we got to the wine tasting portion of the evening it seemed the bartenders had no idea what was going on. After our first glass of wine we were all standing around wondering what was next and the gal behind the bar admitted that she didn't know what she was supposed to be doing and ran into the back to find out. After we figured out that we indeed got to try four different wines, it was still really disorganized. You had to basically be standing on the bar to get your next glass of wine. A different bartender poured one of the rounds and when prompted about the wine, she didn't know the product at all.  The wines we did have, were good. A very unique selection of wines are served at Decantur. It's not your typical wine list. If you're looking for something new and different, give them a try! If you're NOT looking for something new and different, check their wine list online before you head over."}
{"text":"The wife and I stopped in on a whim one afternoon and have fallen in love with the place.  The staff is amazingly accommodating and knowledgable.  The wines, especially the Scorpion, are fantastic.  The best part is the prices as one would expect a wine bar in that area to be outrages, thankfully though, the pricing is very fair.    We have been back twice now and plan to make it a regular haunt."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place. Staff was knowledgeable, wine options were excellent, and food was delicious.  It was a comfortable atmosphere too."}
{"text":"Update: this place has stepped up its game. We had Candice as our waitress and she was amazing the entire evening. They have some outside wines, that really compliment the house wines. The menu has been kicked up a notch and would recommend it to clients and friends. Make sure you as for Candice, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Wow!  The wines here are absolutely phenomenal.  I'm currently enjoying a Malbec with my bruschetta and I'm in heaven!  The area is perfect for this wine experience.  Delicious food - very wonderful combination of flavored.  Wonderful wines - I had a flight of different kinds (they have 39 wines, not all on the menu- just tell them what you like) and they were all so good!  Check them out during wine time!"}
{"text":"We stopped in last night on a whim and stumbled upon their amazing happy hour specials - $5 off all glasses of wines and flights.  I enjoyed a $3 glass of sparkling wine and couldn't believe the bargain it was!  My husband tried a flight of 5 red wines for only $10...again, a great value!  Super nice staff and a nice atmosphere as well!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! I stumbled upon it when I was doing some shopping at DC Ranch on my most recent trip to Scottsdale. I have to say I love the concept! And the food! I have been to Postino wine bar before, which is somewhat similar. But their food, wine selection and the level of knowledge of their staff is not even in the same ballpark as Decantur. I still dream about the bruschetta with figs and bacon and Brie. Yum!!!! I was there during their \"wine time\" happy hour and the $5 off every glass of wine is a steal (and maybe a bit dangerous for me)! I really like how the wine menu is set up with different size options from glass to case. If you try a wine you really enjoy you can take a case of it home with you that day. I can't wait to go back on my next trip to AZ!"}
{"text":"Great place, we've been there once and really enjoyed it. They have a lot of different wine choices. Food is excellent too! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Very cool place. Wines are tasty. Real cool vibes. Out door seating. Large bar top both inside and outside. Bar keep very knowledgable and friendly."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is almost as good as the service. Their wines are mostly unknown yet excellent. I highly recommend the Daddy Long Legs. The charcuterie board is my favorite thing to order. Great spot for happy hour and/or dinner."}
{"text":"Great place to come for happy hour with small group of friends. I came here to meet my girlfriend for happy hour and I really liked their wine selection and food I had.  I wasn't quite sure about the wine they mix there so I went with what I know. Wine I selected was very smooth, I enjoyed chatting with her while enjoying my glass of red wine.  Happy hour is from 3-6pm, small and quiet lounge, ideal for 2-4 people group to enjoy comfortably. Interestingly, while we were there, only female customers were there.  I ordered kale salad with grilled salmon for my food and really enjoyed this healthy food. Fresh kale, nicely cooked salmon, good dressing, it was just right amount of food.   We chatted for about two hours over just one glass of drink, it was good way to end busy week."}
{"text":"This is a great place! We've been there a few times so far and had the buratta bruschetta, the ruben pannini, the ceviche, the prosciutto asparagus flatbread, the fuji apple bruschetta. the carnita street tacos and the smoked turkey blt...and all were somewhere between great and amazing. The wine was very nice too. Our friends really enjoyed all of the desert wines they tasted and we love the Clarissa (a pinot grigio). Staff was very friendly and on top of their game. Great atmosphere. They tell us they are adding a full bar too!"}
{"text":"Drove by on my way to AJ's and noticed the sign. Decided to go back later with a friend. Great atmosphere, outstanding service. The bruschetta is delicious and the wine flights provide great options. This place is going to be on regular rotation."}
{"text":"I have previously posted a review of this place and my final comments were that this place wouldn't last the year. Once again I am right on with my reviews. This place is now closed. Good riddance!"}
{"text":"Wow ! What a great Addition to The DC Ranch Area. Can't Say enough Good Things about the Unique, One of a Kind Wine & Food. We Experienced the 5 Glass Wine Tasting & All Were Fantastic. Ordered the Chopped Salad & 4 Choice Bruchetta & All Were Delicious. Sarah Our Server was the Best & also Met the Creator of all the Wines Colin. Be Sure to Enroll in There Wine Club which Consists of 4 Tiers to Choose from, Well Worth the Cost.All In All Just a Great Experience & a Welcome Find to the Area, Sure to Give Postino's a Wake Up Call."}
{"text":"Was so excited for the neighborhood wine bar/restaurant to open! Living across the street makes this place so convenient. I want to love this place so badly, however it just falls short. The three times I have been here the service is very poor. The first time I came it took for ever for our food and wines to be given to us. With high hopes it was just grand opening hiccups I returned most recently and the service was still horrible for how un busy they were. Our kale salad was never delivered and we sat for forever before our order being taken. The food and wine are delicious but the service continually falls short. Really rooting for this place to survive!!"}
{"text":"Best Winery I've ever been too! Became a member because of my business and it's been one of the smartest investments I have ever made. From the owners to the staff it's one of the best establishments I've ever been too. Ask for either Collin or Sarah they'll take great care of you! Today they just opened for the lunch and the food was amazing! Their grand opening is Thursday, March 10th make sure to be there. I know I will be!"}
{"text":"By far the best sandwiches in the DC Ranch Area by far! Staff was super cool, friendly, and helpful! A lot of places in North Scottsdale have snotty workers but they were super chill here! Definitely will go back and I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"What a great experience! Went on a double date to this new place tonight and it was so good! We ordered the bruschetta right away and it was absolutely amazing. We tried each one and truly enjoyed it. I ordered a house wine blend and was very impressed. My husband ordered an old fashioned and said it was made nearly perfectly. The wait staff was attentive and helpful with our orders throughout the night. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Lovely atmosphere, good food and friendly owners make this place a must if you are looking for a place to take a special someone.  Ordered the chicken apple pecan salad. My gf ordered the arrugala and toasted chicken flatbread. Both were very tasty.  The owner suggested a sampling of different wines, which my girlfriend tried. This allowed her to pick one that she never heard of and was able to purchase a bottle to take home.  Yes, we will be back for this hidden gem in DC Ranch!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Wine and Food!!!  Staff is friendly and helpful, owners are very personable and kind.  Everything is great this place is a must!  I go every week!!"}
{"text":"Awesome location, even better wines! Their Malbec's are yummy and the wine ambassadors are knowledgable and  friendly! They have these large 600 liter fermentation tanks in plain view. I can't believe they make such good wines. Had the turkey BLT and Kale Apple Salad. I highly recommend you go. Ask for Collin. He's the Cellar Master and will show you a great time!"}
{"text":"FAVORITE winery in Scottsdale! Fantastic, creative wines. Food is great. It's the place I come where I'm never let down by anything: food, service, wine, atmosphere. Rio & Tracy are the best!! Try the Coyote Ugly, Daddy Long Legs, and wine flights. Charcuterie board and bruschetta are delicious! The pesto pasta special was good too. The membership includes 2 bottles of wine/mo, 2 free glasses of wine day, and 20% off food everyday for $99/mo. I'm a member and the best money I've spent!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite spot in the valley. Bruschetta is the best in town and the raspberry port is the perfect dessert. Will be back again for sure....maybe everyday."}
{"text":"Been here two times now and have had an amazing experience each time!! The staff is really friendly and knowledgeable. We were the last people in the restaurant and we didn't feel rushed at all. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"One star because I went there today and it was gone!  A new poke bowl and bar is opening in the location.  What happened?"}
{"text":"We went there yesterday for happy hour! The food and wine were awesome! We ordered the \"Tonto\" wine which I highly recommend. Wine seemed reasonably priced. Had great service from \"Riley\" she even poured us a complimentary port at the end. Thought it was a nice touch. Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"NEW GREAT FIND!!! This place is a blast! Clean, modern and the wine + food is fantastic! Thank you Yelp for helping me discover this gem! Very close to the AJ's in DC Ranch area. All the wine is smooth and delicious, not too acidic. The bruschetta is out of this world too (my friend's husband is a chef and he gave two thumbs up)! Everyone who works there seems to be very happy and loving their job, A+ to the servers! Thank you Decantur for a lovely time, we WILL be back :)"}
