{"text":"This is for the Steeles Ave/Hwy 10 location. We ordered delivery last night 30 mins before the restaurant closed. As we were eating the food we noticed a very strong cigarette smell. At first we thought maybe someone was smoking out back with the door open when the food was being prepared. As we all all took turns smelling the food we could smell ash coming from multiple items. Looks like whoever was cooking ashed in our food. This place is Black listed in our books."}
{"text":"Heard good things about this restaurant and decided to give it a shot. Called in and ordered the standard meal for two - pork fried rice, chicken chop suey, and 'sweet and sour' chicken balls. Unsure of the quantity of food we would be receiving, I politely asked the girl on the phone how many chicken balls the meal came with and I was told \"I don't know\". Strike 1.  Headed over to pick it up and was quickly given my order and was practically rushed out the door. Arrived home and opened up our order to find they had forgot to give us the red sweet and sour sauce for our chicken balls. Everybody knows, chicken balls are nothing without the red sauce. Strike 2.  Quite annoyed, we decided to call the restaurant back and let them know they forgot it to see if there was anything they could do for the inconvenience they had caused. I politely told the girl on the phone that I was upset by their mistake, and in an ignorant tone she rethorically replied \"well, what am I supposed to do?\". Strike 3.  No apology for the error, no compensation for what I had paid for and not received = not worth my time or money ever again. I was spoken to as if they were doing me a favour by providing me food I had paid for. It truly bewilders me when companies in the hospitality and service industry cannot find the words \"sorry\" when they are clearly at fault.   Along with terrible customer service, the rice was overloaded with soy sauce, the chicken chop suey had 3 morsels of chicken and the chicken balls had a 10:1 ratio of fried dough and chicken. I guess we can say their customer service and food are on par with one another.   All in all, don't waste your time ordering food from here. Spend the extra few bucks and head on down to the Mandarin or the plethora of other Chinese food joints in the city. Truly disappointing experience."}
{"text":"I've heard good things about this place from friends and my parents and finally I went to see for myself. Definitely not what I was expecting but for the better. Place was recently renovated and looks nice inside. Place is very small. Buffet choice is limited but what they do have tastes great! What they serve at lunch mon-fri is different from supper. Supper choice on a Saturday, there's a little more. Free soft drinks and iced tea with buffet. They do take out and delivery as well. Take out and delivery menu offers a variety of dishes. For a Chinese buffet, the price is good! Staff and service friendly and prompt. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"A friend suggested this place for a graduation party and the food is actually very good and the service was better than I expected, but the only thing is that it is a little on the small side, so if it were in a better location, it would do very well!"}
{"text":"always good customer service,my family eats there on a daily basis.food is good"}
{"text":"The food was amazing very fresh and Delish the restaurant is very clean and modern will be coming back again"}
{"text":"Great all you can eat place. It's cheaper than places like Mandarin, Wok of Fame and such but it still satisfies your chinese food craving. Only thing is is that it's a smaller restaurant with less options compared to the mainstream all you can eat chinese food restaurants.  Just to add, they also do takeout for reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great food! My fav is general Tao, comes with rice.  Really quick. Pay cash for pick up and save $$$$ __________________________________________ Tried their buffet recently. It is small but has a good variety. Really cheap but tasty! They had all the staples, a noodle, rice, fries, chicken dish, beef & broccoli, soups, wings, and dessert too.  Not bad for under $20! Friendly and efficient start too! Worth a try, depending on the day, cheaper option than takeout."}
{"text":"My family and I love coming here or getting food from here! whether it's take out or dining in the food is always amazing!   The buffet is very cheap compared to others but it doesn't taste like buffet food.  It tastes like food that took time to prepare it.  I love this place and highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Went here on a weekday for their lunch buffet. They start to bring dishes out at 12pm so don't bother coming any earlier. The lunch buffet comes out to $14.63 with taxes.  Coming into the restaurant, I was quite impressed with the way it was decorated. The interior was very nice for its location and surpassed my expectations.   There is one long buffet table used for lunch. They also have a half table against the wall, but I assume this is only used during dinner? Not too sure but there were labels for dishes such as popcorn shrimp and black pepper steak that I assume are only available during dinner.   For the lunchtime selection, there were large trays of typical Chinese buffet fare, such as general tao chicken, lemon chicken, calamari, Chinese broccoli, satay beef, teriyaki beef, etc. They also had a couple soups, fries, spring rolls. Nothing was really too out there.   The food quality was quite good for a buffet. Being there at 12 right when the food came out probably contributed to this, as it tasted fresh(-ly defrosted). No complaints here, it's just good buffet food.  For dessert, they have a small corner in the back right. There wasn't too much selection. I had a cream puff and some mint chocolate chip ice cream.   Service was prompt and our server acted quickly when we told her we had to back to work in 7 minutes.   What I got from this establishment is that they know their audience, and they do a good job catering to it. It's good for a buffet, not too pricy. Not sure I'll be back, but I have nothing against Golden Palace."}
{"text":"This place is average.   I ordered the stir-fry noodles with vegetables chicken fried rice General Tao chicken and salt and pepper shrimp it was a delivery order through skip the dishes after tax and delivery fees it came up to $55.99 which is slightly pricey.  None of the dishes were truly delicious and memorable but I didn't hate any of them either which is why I would rate it as average I will say that the portion sizes were extremely large what I ordered was for two people and after both of us had one plate a full plate. It looked like we didn't even touched the food probably will have enough leftovers for 2 or 3 days"}
{"text":"Order delivery the fry rice ok chicken ball fresh taste good. Chillie chicken no thanks need more spice"}
{"text":"When it's on, the buffet offers take out-quality food with all-you-can-eat benefit. But the buffet has been off now and again leaving the food dry and uninspiring. Peak times and rapid turnover would seem to be the difference. Take out is usually pretty consistently good. Cantonese chow mein and egg rolls are favorites."}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere is much better than any other Chinese buffet I've been to.  The food selection isn't huge but it's all at least decent with a few dishes being really quite excellent, such as the black pepper beef steak, lemongrass beef, and 3 kinds of chicken wings.  Dessert is a bit below average."}
{"text":"So we decided to order Chinese & selected the Golden Palace cause we had eaten here a couple times in the past, we don't normally order delivery.   The person that answered the phone was far from pleasant but that was the end of the bad part. The food was of solid quality & quantity. We ordered the Sweet & Sour Chicken, Beef w Broccoli, Chicken Fried Rice & Singapore Noodles. All was tasty & they didn't forget the little extras such as soy sauce & plumb sauce.   Think this is a do over or a re-order if you will."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here for over a decade. The food is always fresh. They have the best sweet & sour sauce. When you order close to closing they really stuff the containers."}
{"text":"I came here last night for dinner. It was 8pm no one was in here, although two couples came in after us. We had ordered take out fried rice here and it the bomb so I said let's try the buffet. Hmm well everything is fried... fried chicken wings, fried noodles fried rice, fried fish, sweet and sour chicken, lemon chicken, fries, onion rings and some other stuff. Sound appealing? Well let me tell you that 95% of the food was low and looked and tasted like it had been sitting there since 5pm. Everything tasted fine I ate it all but the sweet and sour chicken wasn't saucy the sauce had dried on from the time sitting there. As for all the other saucy stuff. I think I will just pay the extra and go to mandarin I like the salmon and crab legs and shrimps that this place was missing. I'm willing maybe to try it again but I'd have to go when they just bring out the food for dinner time"}
{"text":"Arguably the worst Chinese food I've had.  For delivery anyway.  Bland, tasteless, and way overcooked.   At least it was expensive and took 90 minutes to deliver."}
{"text":"We've come here a few times with friends and the food here is okay, but for the price there isn't much selection at this place and the food is not very authentic.  It's more in line with food from a food court.  This particular visit, one of the diner's chairs broke and the restaurant removed the chair but did very little to make sure the person was okay.  They didn't even comp one of the meals, which should be a given in that situation - at the bare minimum.  Not a place I would recommend based on food, or service."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from Ubereats.  The menu is nice and big with descriptions of all the items and what is in them.  I ordered the teriyaki beef that came on a bed of veggies. My boyfriend ordered \"Combo B\" which was an egg roll, chicken balls with sweet and sour sauce and BBQ pork fried rice.  The reason for the 2nd star was because our order was hot when it arrived and it was accurate as I requested the mushrooms to be removed from the veggies in my beef teriyaki. Other than that, everything was disappointing.  The teriyaki sauce on the beef was tasteless and the texture was gelatinous. It was very odd. The beef was tender, yet tasteless, and some of the pieces were just chucks of fat. The veggies underneath were very under cooked, almost raw, and very difficult to eat.  My boyfriends meal was also disappointing. The rice was also tasteless and very dry. The pork was very dry, hard and tasteless as well. The chicken balls already had the sauce put on them, which made the batter a little soggy. The batter was also extremely greasy. You could literally squeeze the grease out of the batter and that is all you could taste when you ate it.  The best part of the whole meal was the egg roll and fortune cookies.  Unfortunately, this was our first and last order at this establishment. I spent 35$ and I do not feel like I got my moneys worth."}
