{"text":"Ahhhh, just the smell of this place brings me back to my childhood...
Today I was here bright and early with all the German Omas. I found exactly what I was looking for, that pearl sugar used in Belgian Liege waffles! As I was paying the lady asked me if I was putting it on top of cookies and I explained I would be making waffles with it. I think I brought HER back to her childhood for a moment as her eyes rolled back in her head and she said in her heavy German accent, \"Da, with chocolate that's pure comfort food!\" 
I knew I had found a kindred spirit.
Other super finds here...spicy curry ketchup for our curry wurst, red and white sauerkraut, speck, and herbed liver sausage."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this little gem while in Calgary for work. It is a Deli that serves some prepared food, sandwiches, has lunchmeat, breads, ect. Also has spices, dry goods, canned goods, chocolate, ect for purchase.  To sum up my experiences here (ate here 5 days in a row) I have to say this is some comfort food that when you start to taste the goodness you just close your eyes and have all the childhood memories come rushing back."}
{"text":"I had been meaning to go to this deli for quite some time, and I was not disappointed with I finally made the trek. They had ready-made schnitzel, sauerkraut (both red and white), quiche and perogies. Get all of it. Buy it all. Run home, put sweatpants on and eat it all to yourself. Friends and family be damned. 

If you're feeling extremely generous, you can share. I guess, if you swing that way. It really is delicious. Not quite as good as my Babi would have made, perhaps, but definitely an adequate alternative to slaving over a hot stove making it all from scratch. The red cabbage was particularly delicious, and I would recommend trying one of the quiches. 

They also have all manner of European imports of candy, chocolate, pasta, sauces, jams and more. I love browsing the aisles and catching glimpses of products that remind me of my time in Europe and thinking *gasp!* I remember these! Which inevitably leads to me buying 8 packages of whatever it is.

Now that you've spend $40 on sauerkraut and schnitzel, candy and jam, be sure to spend another $40 on their cakes and pastries. Definitely worth it.

{"text":"I come here occasionally for take out dinner.  They have a few made-in-store items that I love, like their schnitzle and chicken patties.  The potato salad is excellent.  I don't buy the deli counter meats and cheeses because they are so expensive.  There are two other european delis nearby that I prefer because they have more reasonable prices.  But if you do buy their meats, they are good."}
{"text":"This is a small European style deli and market where you can find a few products you're not usually gonna find in your regular supermarket. I come here to purchase German-style Currywurst Sauce. I also come for the food and especially the pastries. They have daily specials which I've tried a few times, like Schnitzel and Spaetzle plates. I really like the Schnitzel sandwich a lot. Great little spot."}
{"text":"I stepped in recently because I was in the neighborhood and had a few minutes to kill.  It's smaller than other European deli's I've been to in Calgary but it'll do if you don't want to drive too far.  There was quite a line-up of people so I didn't bother to wait and purchase anything.  I only browsed and as mentioned, the variety of dry goods is smaller but adequate.  It's the deli that has a decent selection of hot food.  

There really isn't much for seating inside and it doesn't look welcoming, so I'd be ordering food to go.  It was a rather uncomfortably cold room, which is another reason why I didn't stick around for very long.  I don't know what had happened before I arrived, but the clerk was extremely apologetic to each customer as he handled their purchases, saying he was sorry for the inconvenience and appreciated their patience.  

I'd be most interested in returning to try some of the deli food."}
{"text":"Best dam kaiser sandwich in town, great selection and service, miss em since they moved down to elbow from 14st. Wish u were closer. Nice selection of in house made products sausage ,schnitzel , salad all very nice"}
{"text":"I walked into this deli hoping to get something quick and simple.  Upon entry I was overwhelmed by the scent of sour kraut.  Now, considering my background, that was a great thing.  My mouth immediately started watering and I began craving a bratwurst with the cabbage on top.

I was sad to see that they didn't actually serve sandwiches or meals to go.  It really was just a deli; exactly like you would see in a grocery store.  There were huge hunks of meat behind a glass counter that you could purchase by weight, as well as some crackers and other dried breads.  They had a huge assortment of different packaged sauces that you could purchase and make at home.  

Along one wall was where all the pre-made stuff was.  You could buy jars of jams and condiments, as well as different European delicacies.

It was a great deli, just not what I was expecting.  If I'm in the mood for a huge slab of garlic salami or black forest ham, I know where to go.  I didn't actually see any sour kraut in the place, but I know it was there somewhere!"}
