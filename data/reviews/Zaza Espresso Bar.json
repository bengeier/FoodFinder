{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! The gelato, espresso and latte here were amazing. The server was super nice and friendly. I tried the red velvet latte and it was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Was sad when my favourite espresso joint in the neighborhood close (Cafe Latte) but love my new favourite! Legit great Southern Italian Espresso Bar. Great staff."}
{"text":"It was my first time at zaza and I love it!! It was the big gelato sign outside the cafe that caught my eye. I went straight to the gelato area and eveything looked soo yummy. The staff was very friendly and told me that I could try before ordering and I first tried the strawberry cheesecake one. It was ok and I tried the tiramisu. I got it in small. It was good even though i've tasted better. 

It is quite hot inside and you can sit outside as well. The place was cosy and very clean. Good idea for the \"wood plank wall\" (sorry I don't know how it's called!). I'll definitly go back and try their drinks."}
{"text":"It's the only place in the city where you can experience the real taste of an Italian espresso coffee. I lived in Rome 24 years and the taste is identical. Their cappuccinos are authentic and only if you had taste an authentic Italian \"caffè\" you can actually appreciate it. If you don't know about Italian coffee you cannot understand the \"philosophy\" behind a small cup of coffee. Whenever I have Italian VIPs visiting in Toronto, I don't want to go wrong: Zaza is the only place to go."}
{"text":"The coffee here is fantastic. I really mean it. I go out of my way just to come here if I want an espresso. The decor inside is nice and simple as well. But depending on who you are, you may or may not like the fact that it can get loud; not because it's packed, but because a few southern Italians will come and chat *very loudly* with the staff: it all starts with a very 'ciao bella' and ends with a very loud 'ciao bella'. Personally, I love it, as it reminds me of my travels. 

The nutella biscotti is also very nice."}
{"text":"I love the lattes here. They are perfect with some biscotti for a mid afternoon coffee break. I always come here for my deserts after lunch or dinner. I've impressed my friends with their amazing gelatos. The staff bring the Italian charm. Love the Italian music"}
{"text":"i've only come here a little more then couple of times and  i normally get a Affogato which is espresso poured over gelato, each time it was done well,  the espresso was pretty spot on not sour or  burnt and the gelato really brang out the taste of the espresso.
there food though needs some work, ive never had any from there but it looks like some of it is stale espe"}
{"text":"This cafe is a great place for coffee. To me they pull the best espresso comparing to all other cafe in the area. You should have tried espresso in italy to be able to appreciate the italian athentic espresso they make here. Their Gelato is good too, its handy. they have small selection of flavors. If you wanna treat yourself with large selection of gelato and variety of options, you better visit other gelato places."}
{"text":"Gelato: 3/5
Service: 4/5
Ambience: Nice, but music can be loud.
Repeat: Not in a hurry."}
{"text":"As the 5th Zaza location in Toronto, this location has a nice patio that is actually ON Yonge Street. It is the perfect spot for people watching. The menu is pretty much the same as all of the other Zaza cafes - there is espresso, baked goods (biscotti!) and gelato."}
{"text":"The barista was friendly and nice.

The music there was load and cheerful, and customers are talking loudly. It seems to me that this espresso bar is a good place for catch-ups with some friends in a lazy afternoon."}
{"text":"Always so friendly and welcoming enough to make me and my boyfriend visit them twice a day!  We live in the area and were super excited for Zaza to open up down the street, in our neighbourhood. Their espresso is always best quality and gelato is done so well here.  Great spot for dates or just kicking back in the front open area."}
{"text":"This cafe is a nice toronto chain. It has a lovely interior which is very modern and fresh looking in appearance. I got the Americano which gave the perfect energy boost I was hoping for. Bitter with a bite exactly how I like my coffee. The man who runs the store is very polite and immediately welcomed me and brought complimentary water which was a nice touch. Pricing is fair and the pastries Are to die for!"}
{"text":"I discovered Zaza Espresso bar while trying to kill time waiting for a call back from Emma's country Kitchen for brunch. It was located right across the street a block down. The café had a beautiful patio and a small indoor seating area. The menu was simple and also included fresh gelato/canolis! I ordered an affagato- (coffee based dessert). I picked a dolce de leché (fresh cream) as my base, drenched in one shot of piping hot espresso. You can choose any ice cream from their selections. It was priced at 4.50$.  One taste -perfection! The sweetness of the ice cream really balanced out the bitterness of the espresso (good for people like me that are not regular coffee drinkers)! I would've loved to try the canoli at 2.50$ a piece but I had to keep space for brunch! Wonderful surprise in the outskirts of St.Clair!"}
{"text":"Tbh, I was quite disappointed. no gelato in the winter, Very few desserts, and on top of that it was stale and very dry. As for the nutella latte, 50% foam, 30% whip cream and 20% drink. Environment is small and nothing special. On the up side, server was friendly."}
{"text":"Authentic Italian customer service... The server even gave us some frozen coffee treat on the house.. Very chic ambiance.  We sat outside the restaurant on bar stools, had a delicious espresso.  Will definitely come back to try some of their gelato!"}
{"text":"I've got a major sweet tooth and I'm a sucker for some good Gelato. I heard some good things about this place. I got a scoop each of the chocolate and fragola - both were absolutely delicious. Only complaint is that the lineup and order set up is a bit clustering, plus the place is a bit narrow. Also, the price point is... Eh. Two scoops cost me about $6-7"}
{"text":"Always outstanding service and a great quality of espresso. Try the Nutella biscotti! The decor is clean and contemporary but not cold. A happy and inviting vibe at Zaza!"}
{"text":"Lovely cafe! I tried the red velvet latte and it was delicious. I want to come back for more. They also have different flavors of cannoli. I gotta come back for them."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Awful service, barely there hot chocolate. I got only half a cup of hot chocolate, the rest was foam. The cup was really tiny and I paid $4 for half a cup. It was over priced and cold by the time I got it."}
{"text":"Weather is good so took the kids for some gelato. their gelato is made by La paloma which is my favourite Toronto gelato.
small shop so not much of an ambiance but was good. good espresso too."}
{"text":"My favourite coffee shop to be during summer. The staffs are extremely warm and friendly, and the drinks are bold too! Love the ice americano!"}
{"text":"I've tried all the coffee in the area and now I exclusively go to Zaza because no one can make an Americano as good as they can.  They also have a great little patio and some pretty awesome gelato!"}
{"text":"The guy who runs this place is always jacked up. On coffee I think!
The coffee is superb. So is the gelato. Gave the 5 stars because the place makes me feel like I am in Rome. Loud and soulful."}
{"text":"Best coffee in the St Clair West neighborhood. The had my favorite tea brand, and consistently quality coffee. The seating and interior is beautiful and comfortable. This is a veritable Italian cafe."}
{"text":"This review is for the Yonge and Eglinton location. First of all, the guy looked super annoyed to help me. Then the cup wasn't even properly filled and was sticky. The gelato I got was so sugary I didn't finish half of it.

There's tons of gelato places in the area and I hate to give my money to places with crappy customer service and terrible gelato!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick Americano, the last time I had one that was this good was in Italy! 

Friendly and helpful staff, great prices for quality coffee! 

Next time I'll have the gelato too!"}
{"text":"3.5*


I got the Zaza summer.. It's a glass of cold espresso ... But sadly it's brewed beforehand and kept in the fridge...meh ! Nothing special.

It's a little pricy for its quality...

I would just go to Starbucks or Aroma if I wanted an average coffee."}
{"text":"Three reasons why I like this gelato place:
First, every time I visit, they have different flavours. I've tried Amaretto, Bacio and Fragola. They were all very good; creamy and not too sweet. Bacio was like a Nutella ice cream with chunks of chocolates and nuts. 
 
Second, they will give you a huge scoop. 

Third, as they give you the scoop, they will make you laugh. I've seen a couple of Italian men at the counter and they provide a great service. Grazie!"}
{"text":"Bad espresso. Over extracted. Very little crema. Left a bad bitter taste. Barista (if you want to call her that). Only cared about getting the order done. I saw her late she made for someone else might as well call it for what that was milk and burnt espresso. Anyway, customer service terrible. No customer contact. No interaction. Very \"un-Italian\" since they try and be so Italian. One word of advice focus on customer service and quality of products and stop being so fake. You can really tell. Good location. Patio is good. Just need to improve on everything else. Sorry won't be coming back. So that's three Zaza places I've been to with the same results. I think the owner should reevaluate if they should be in the hospitality business. Just one opinion. Ciao!"}
{"text":"The americano is good but what's up with the current girl who works there? She acts super pissed to be serving customers."}
{"text":"The coffee is nothing special and the pizza is like eating dry flavorless cardboard. The older guy behind the bar is an A.H., never smiles and is quit rude. McDonald's at least gives you a smile and has decent coffee.  I'll go to St Clair if I want a good coffee served p[politely."}
{"text":"Love this place. Tiny Lil coffee shop just north of yonge and eg. Their biscotti is great. I have tried their homemade ice cream and it is just perfect ..not too sweet. Just right.  Their coffee is authentic and a treat to your taste buds."}
{"text":"We got the gelato here.  The smallest size was still about the size of a newborn's head.  The staff really try to put as much gelato as they can into that small cone.  The gelato was pretty decent too and the staff member was really friendly and have us a sample to taste."}
{"text":"This is such a cool spot on St. Clair. If you're roaming the streets looking to grab a gelato or espresso this is it. We walked in thinking there was only going to be espresso's and pastry's but to our surprise we had yummy gelatos!"}
