{"text":"My husband and I have gone here multiple times with family and friends and it is always a good experience for what it is - this is a small family owned/ran restuarant...not some crazy big 5 star place, so we don't expect that. What you DO get is an awesome laid back atmosphere with super friendly staff and some delicious rolls. I haven't tried a whole lot other than rolls and their dinner box, so I can't speak for the other stuff. Yes, the service is slow, but we are never in a rush, so it doesn't bother us much. I like the TV's they have up..always seems to spark some convo with our table or even other tables. Try the Amazon roll...no one we have brought has had a bad thing to say about it! ;)"}
{"text":"Service is horrible. Sushi chefs are slow. Takes them 10 min just to make 1 roll! There was only 3 tables occupied and the waitress says \"sorry for the wait, we got busy all of a sudden\". 3 tables is busy for a Friday night? Sushi was okay but nigiri had a lot of rice. Looking for a sushi spot? Don't go here..."}
{"text":"I've first ate here about 6 moths ago, and I've been back several times! The owner is from Japan, and the rest of the family knows the craft of Sushi very well. I love sushi, and I've been to most of the places here in Vegas and this is by far my favorite. The best thing about it is the ALL YOU CAN EAT is the entire menu! Nigiri and all rows (hand and special rolls), and all appetizers are included in all you can eat for only about $25/person. Also, the atmosphere is VERY relaxed! Most sushi joints are loud and crowed, this place gets plenty of business but is pretty large compared to alot of Sushi joints so it stays clam and easy going even in their more bust times. The service is on point as well. I always sit at the bar and the Sushi chefs are more than willing to make small talk, and make suggestions if you ask. All in all the overall sushi quality is 4 stars (not quite as good as the more expensive places, but still very good and authentic). I give it an overall 5 stars, because the service, staff, atmosphere, price, menu are all perfect. Mos def the best place for the value to get AYCE sushi in Vegas."}
{"text":"I keep TRYING to like this place...  Giving it ONE MORE SHOT because it's close to work... But it's really just crappy if you want anything other than run of the mill rolls.    The Udon is just plain funky with some weird brown broth... Soy and,,, Dunno. Yucky.      I prefer sashimi to rolls and the fish here just isn't fresh enough to pull it off.  You need all the rice and sauce to make it passable.  If you want to feel ignored and pay to much for mediocre rolls that taste about the same as the ones in the grocery store then this is your kind of place."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed ayce sushi. Very friendly, generous with fish. We're picky and we'll be back soon!!"}
{"text":"Those guys at the zen are alway so nice and the food is always great!!! I've been going for years! And I will keep going! The sushi is always fresh and the apps. Are awesome too. Thank guys for all that you do! Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"I don't get out to this place enough. It's a small place but very good and reasonable. The sushi has never been bad and I've been here 5-10 times. It's not my top spot but the best sushi place that I've been to on the north side."}
{"text":"These people are so great! Their sushi is so good! Rainbow is my excellent and their other sushi are great!"}
{"text":"Sushi Zen is an absolutely grose. My husband and I ate at the bar, and the sushi chef was not very attentive of us, bc he was too busy talking to the other customers at the bar. He made his first roll for us, and forgot our wasabi and ginger.  We had the AYCE sushi but we didnt try much until we were disgusted beyond belief. Our sushi chef wipped and blew his nose on a tissue and didnt wash his hands. Keep in mind this was done all in front of us. Then he makes our sushi with his unwashed booger hands. I am not going to eat that especially after I saw the chef blow his nose and didnt wash his hands. He dipped his hands into the sushi rice to make our roll.  We called the waitress over, and politely told her what happend, and let her know that we lost our appetite. She brought us the bill, with NO DISCOUNT!! We didnt ask for one, but thought because of the lack of hygiene front the chef we get discount. We got so angry we paid the $50 some bucks, and left hungry. Dont go to this place unless you like BOOGER SUSHI. I hope they fired that chef."}
{"text":"The service is slow. Then the Sushi Chef behind the counter came out the take orders. While doing so the waitress finished the roll that the Chef started. WHAT'S UP WITH THAT! Don't waist your time or money. Tasty but frustrating."}
{"text":"I went to dinner with my dad. He was recommended this place by one of the women that work there. And ended up she was the sushi chef. I had so much fun. I lived in Japan for a year. So talking to the owners (who are from Japan) just took me back. Cant wait to go back. The fish was so fresh, and talking to the chef was an added bonus. I highly recommend this olace for some great sushi in las vegas."}
{"text":"It was my first time eating sushi, it was pretty good. The service was great, the ladies were friendly and explained everything well, since it was our first time being there. Waitress was really nice towards my kids. The food was good. It was kinda pricey, but we had 2 kids and 2 adults. The only thing I didn't like was that they charge you $1 to use your debit card and they didn't tell you. I think since my bill was over $100 they could have waived the $1 fee but what can you do. But the sushi was good. I would probably check it out again."}
{"text":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE.. service was a joke.. waitress was flirting with people while taking my order. Worst oily  potstickers and thinest fish on a roll ever.. I spend $50 on 2 rolls and 2 nigiri .. never got a refill and never got wasabi and ginger when asked several times. Don't ever go!"}
{"text":"If you're into inedible nasty food that doesn't scratch the surface of authentic sushi this place is perfect for you. It's like a football lovers bar basically run by two brothers either Samoan or Hawaiian that can't get it together. Not even one Asian worker in the entire place. The hired help is a joke and lack any service skills as bad as the 2 siblings running this hole. Kaizen sushi is worth the extra little trip instead."}
{"text":"Horrible service, the sushi was mediocre. I've had better rolls from Smiths. The soups were good... Yea that's about it. I gave the 2 stars for trying... I mean I'm surprised I didn't get sick from their food. The rolls were covered in sauces, super thin tiny pieces of Fish, I mean thinner and way smaller than usual. I literally had to ask 3 times for a water refill. I won't be going back...."}
{"text":"I have to agree with everything Wade F. said. The service was slow, skimpy portions, excessive sweet sauce applied to sushi. You barely see the fish in the white tuna roll. Most of the fried dishes was over cooked and dry. With the all you can eat pricing, they weren't too generous on their service. You get more rice than fish. After trying a few rolls I just couldn't eat anymore because of the sweet sauce they put in almost all the sushi rolls. It was way too sweet for my taste. I got a bad vibe from the wait staff when I wanted to order more food, just got a funny look from him.  Kinda made me feel guilty for order more food. Trying this place once is enough for me."}
{"text":"I come here on a weekly basis for lunch. Awesome friendly people with good conversation. The sushi is good and not overpriced either. Love it."}
{"text":"No the best I've ever had, certainly not the worst.  Good lunch deals. Good AYCE pricing. Udon was... Odd.  My husband liked it, I wasn't a fan. The broth It was dark and on the sweet side with nothing in it but chewy noodles and some mediocre shrimp tempura.  I can't say it was bad... Just different than the usual light broth full of goodness.  The sushi was good, some of it great... I'd say, based on my single visit, it's mediocre. I'll go back, but out of convenience and pricing. I wouldn't drive out of my way to get here."}
{"text":"I'll never understand how some people can evaluate something that they've never encountered first hand??? This place is an exact replica of sushi spots in Japan, which makes sense because the owner is from Japan. Yes, it is small but it's very clean and they are always willing to accommodate larger groups and yes, it takes time to prepare your rolls but it's fresh, what do you expect?! Just order multiple rolls at a time and order your next rolls of choice halfway through your meal! Never in the 3 1/2yrs that we've been going here have they ever denied us the option of ordering more than roll at a time! Just know, as with any sushi restaurant that if you order more than you are able to eat, there will be additional costs but that's understandable, sushi is not cheap! We lived in Japan for 4yrs and my husband is Japanese so we are very familiar with the quality and freshness of sushi and I must say that Sushi Zen is one of the best sushi spots in town! Not only that but their all you can eat deal is great! $25 all you can eat rolls, appetizers and salads! You spend $10-15 per roll alone at other spots and they also have a cheaper all you can eat rate during lunch time!   If you decide to give Sushi Zen a try, be sure to try the Amazon(one of a kind and not found anywhere else) and their Japanese Lasagna roll(found elsewhere but nothing like Sushi Zen's) : D"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend love the sushi from this place. It's pretty empty most of the time, so they serve us our food fast. It's very clean and we love the ice cream too. We've gotten great costumer service as well the times we've gone. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"very good food & friendly service!  I went with a group of 6 and I was the only one who didn't do AYCE&D as I knew I wouldn't eat enough to make it worth it for me but that was a great deal for the people eating at least a couple of their specialty rolls.  I had edamame, a spicy tuna roll and a cucumber & avocado roll--it was all very good & fresh.  The server and sushi chef handled my group's voluminous requests very well and everyone enjoyed their food.  I tried one piece of someone's 'the hulk' and thought it was delicious & different from anything I've ever seen...but then again, I'm just getting into sushi.  Would love to go back!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years. It's a small place, It's family owned, and they are great people. I love getting sushi bombs there. Their Vegas Roll is like no other. I cannot find anything like it at other sushi restaurants, it's so delicious. They've been experimenting with their tempura ice cream. They added cinnamon and they've also done a Red Velvet one. DELICIOUS. This place gets 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"Give them 2 stars for their effort.  AYCE menu is not big but still had fairly good selection, though nigiri on AYCE menu is very minimal.  Service was very slow, probably due to them being understaffed."}
{"text":"They should be called Rice Zen!  Yes they have all you can eat, but I think the idea behind it is to fill you up on rice ... or a beverage, the wait between rolls was a bit long and I ended up filling up on water.  Sorry to say won't be going back."}
{"text":"Awesome friendly, attentive and professional service. Highly recommend. Great daily specials."}
{"text":"Good place but they charge $1 just to use a credit card due to \"increasing fees\" which is a pretty poor practice. If you order takeout ask for soy sauce; they may forget."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Sushi Chefs both guys are phenomenal. Don't let the nonasianess fool you. He is married to a Japanese girl and was traditionally trained. Love the Lion Roll. Down the street from us. Awesome service at the sushi bar, great chefs!!!!  So attentive and friendly. Great for a Neighborhood Sushi Bar!  I'll be back. :) I was starving craving sushi after work. They really hit the spot. And I'm picky. I'm a sushi connoisseur and having worked at a sushi bar myself, where I learned a lot!!! Secrets of the trade!  Sushi Zen is great! Prices are reasonable too!"}
{"text":"I gave it one star because zero stars isn't an option. Service was terrible. 3 of us went in for all you can eat and the waitress questioned my friend who ordered 3 orders of nigiri which is 6 pieces. The food was honestly sub par and it is definitely not a place I will return too."}
{"text":"A-Ok is what I think of this place. I stoped here during hungry hour after checking my yelp app for the closest sushi place in the area which guided me to sushi Zen. I ordered two sushi rolls with a miso sup for the lunch special, service was great with the waiter and the sushi chef being very friendly and helpful with menu recommendations.  The sushi bar did needed some cleaning, it was a little stickier than the sushi rice, nothin a damp rag couldn't fix but the improvised \"office\" between the kitchen and the dining room really has to go, it takes away from the minimalist Japanese ambiance and interrupts my Zen. if I want to see clutter I would just order Chinese food and eat it inside my car.  Sushi was good, and prices are competitive I wouldn't mind eating here again and trying their all you can eat sushi deal. I know I'll find some decent sushi but I hope I find some zen."}
{"text":"This place was down the street and decided to give it a try.my husband and I were very disappointed,15 minutes after we walked in finally after being ignored for a while we finally got someone in to give us a roll then we had to wait another 15 minutes just to get a second roll and still were being ignored the server was pretty nice they were not too busy but seem to act like they were."}
{"text":"Our experience was terrible, do not go to this place.   I'm originally from California which has pretty good sushi, I have also lived in Okinawa Japan for 3 years so my palate knows what sushi should taste like.  The service: between waiter/sushi \"chef\" running around while the waiter ran back in and forth between tables, kitchen ( he was also drinking a beer hike he threw food around back there) the atmosphere was one of dysfunction and disorganization. We did not get a refill on drinks and had to flag them down in order to pay our tab.  The restaurant itself was hot... Who wants to eat room temperature sushi and rolls?  Food: rice consistency was as if I was eating steel cut oats ( somewhat soft/ slightly hard) so long story not as long, the sashimi was not good, sushi rolls blew and I will never come back. I read a review pre visit- someone had said they lived in Okinawa and this place reminded him of there- wrong. Commissary (grocery store) sushi is way better."}
{"text":"Personally, I adore this sushi spot. It's not too expensive, the people who work here are always so nice, and the rolls are delicious. I have tried at least 10 different sushi joints in Vegas in the past 6 months and I always come back here. Try the Hawaiian Delight roll! It's amazing!"}
{"text":"Awesome staff, atmosphere & food. They are always coming up with different designs. They do tend to serve slower as they get busy but that's why you have to choose the right time. So far its the only sushi place where they interact with the customers. Fave's here are the Fuji, Tiger, Spider & Amazon. Seaweed salad..yum! Mochi & Tempura Fried Ice Cream, (drool)! AYCE, priced just right & I have never had a problem ordering more than 1 roll at a time, but really who needs to order more than that, order what you know your going to eat!! I heart Zen..."}
{"text":"Omg I'm sorry but this place gives sushi a bad name! The sushi tastes old and the guy put too much sauce all over one of the \"special\" sushis he introduced us to. That was our first & last time!"}
{"text":"Horrible service! My husband went up there to pick up the good with my debit card because I just had a baby and couldn't leave the house. They refused to run the card and made him go get cash. When he came back they forgot part of the order and didn't even give us a receipt. They took the $60 he gave them without giving him any change. Rude people working there. We will not be giving them our service ever again."}
{"text":"I like trying new sushi places. Sometimes the best ones don't look like it on the outside or inside so it's always worth exploring a new place, no matter what.   Sushi Zen is one of those places that I wanted to explore because it's a short drive for me so I walked in feeling really positive.   Plus I love sushi!!!  Unfortunately the friendly welcome and genuinely nice staff couldn't make up for the long waiting times and 'living room' feel generated by the loud TVs hanging above the bar. Sticky laminated menus, weak green tea, loosely rolled maki and the sloppily dressed server with dirty clothing was also a no-no.   I personally would have been ok with all this except the sushi was blandly average and the atmosphere left me feeling drained and disappointed.   Would have given one star but the staff truly are very nice."}
{"text":"Great, fresh sushi. Nice staff, quick service."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Sushi Just ok. I had to find out the hard way that cheese and sushi dont mix. I got the Japanese lasagna sushi. Sushi with a thick slice if mozzarella. Yucky. I guess that was my bad for trying it. Cucumber salad was good. Not a bad place but I have No plans  to return."}
{"text":"The worst sushi I have ever eaten in my life. Beware of this place. The sushi is terrible and you are wasting your time eating here because you will be disappointed."}
{"text":"Really good.. Great customer service !! Good tasty food.. My kids live it also..we love to order to go.. Its always ready fast... I love the dragon rolls ..my favorite!! I would definitely recommend them"}
{"text":"New to Vegas and wanted some sushi so I found me this place. Food was delicious and staff and was super friendly.  I'll be back soon"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The service is good, it's clean(which is hugely important when you're talking about raw fish), the food is good and it's affordable. We come here every couple of months for the All you can eat which is only $25! Talk about awesome! Now the deal is you must finish all that you order when you take on the AYCE otherwise they'll charge you ala carte prices which is very understandable, sushi isn't cheap and if it is you have no business eating it. So prepare to come hungry and leave stuffed to the gills. The AYCE is totally worth it if you eat even a minimum of 4 rolls, since at the ala carte price you can pay far more. this place is quiet and awesome and the staff is super friendly, we usually sit up at the bar and chat up the person making the rolls. If you're going here for things other than sushi I would suggest finding a better place. but for sushi this place is definitely a good spot!"}
{"text":"This is the only place I like eat specialty sushi rolls at.  They have a good deal for $ 25 all-you-can-eat.  It's great cause I can have 3 to 4 rolls and my fav's all cost $ 13 a roll anyway.  I have been coming here for a long time and don't plan to stop. The staff is really nice too.  They also have a lunch special for 2 rolls $ 14.00.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Service sucks and food not that great I eat one roll and that's all it took for me to leave right away."}
{"text":"This is truly not a all you can eat restaurant! The service is slow and they only let you order one thing at a time. I ordered one roll and it took about twenty minutes when you only have a 1 hour time limit to eat. I wanted to order more rolls but the waitress did not want to let me order more food till I finished with my first roll. This is bad! I know how much I can eat. I only ate one roll and I was so upset with them I paid the all you can eat price for one roll and left. I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE AGAIN! I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO EAT HERE EVER!"}
{"text":"I met a friend here and didn't eat. The food I saw didn't look good."}
{"text":"Food just ok. The servers need some pointers on serving food. Their hands should NOT be touching my food. They also looked like they slept in their clothes. A little neater please."}
{"text":"We got restationed here! Our first date day choice - & still so tasty! I love the spicy jumpers & they even have more rolls! The family that runs it has always treated us great."}
{"text":"Love! The owner and family are amazing! Always great sushi and awesome conversation to be had. Absolutely adore Kevin & Kimmy!!!"}
{"text":"My new fave place!   Great little spot for nlv.   All you can eat for 24ish or Eat and Drink for 34ish great deal!!!  great service.. so friendly and welcoming!!! completely worked with me and the portions (so i could eat more!!)   the chef was amaing as well as my waiter!   love love love the lobster roll yum yum!!"}
{"text":"In the interest of fairness, I gave this place three opportunities before writing a review. All three visits produced similar experiences.  First, I will say that this place is very clean. I imagine it's fairly easy to maintain since the customers are so few and far between. 2 of the 3 visits were during lunch, and one for dinner. I was the only customer for both lunch visits and one of three for dinner.  The service is polite but incredibly slow. I was literally the ONLY customer in the place for two of my visits, and it still took 10 - 15 minutes for them to make a single sushi roll. I ended up leaving not because I was satisfied, but because I was so tired of sitting there after 90 minutes and only 4 orders delivered.  The worst part was the food. The rice was cold and horribly soggy. It was sincerely disgusting. The nigiri was a huge ball of nasty, soggy rice with a tiny dry piece of fish. The rolls were about average size, but the quality of the ingredients was terrible and almost inedible. Just the thought of that rice makes me cringe.  I have eaten at most of the sushi places in Las Vegas, and Zen is by far the worst."}
{"text":"Sorry to put this place down, because they are nice people, but I would never go back.  Everything tasted old.  I was afraid I was going to be sick, but luckily it did not happen.  Really bad."}
{"text":"I agree with the others that say they have you wait way too long to get your rolls. The place is nearly empty and you wait forever. I haven't been here for a few months for that specific reason. I just drive a little further up the street and go to another place where I know my service will be quick & attentive."}
{"text":"Horrible service!! I said excuse me about 4 times and every time the server walked passed me, there was something in my water. It took forever for them to take my order and it was a Wednesday and there was only one other person in the restaurant. Once again HORRIBLE SERVICE!"}
{"text":"I ate here more than a year ago, but I feel compelled to write about my experience. If things have improved since then, my apologies.   I love sushi, but I wasn't feeling the zen in this place. I showed up not knowing about their all-u-can-eat plan, so for me this was a bonus. When I received my first roll, I asked the chef, \"Where's the meat?\" My roll was 99% rice. I offered to pay extra so I could get more meat ... because that's what I came for... fish meat. LOL. She replied with something like, \"Everyone always asks for more meat ... more meat. And I tell them - This is it!\"   Honey, if everyone is asking for more meat, you clearly don't put enough meat in your sushi rolls. Charge an extra dollar and put more meat in it. And their sushi roll list lacks creativity as well. Everything seemed to be a california roll topped with fish.   They should rename this place 'Rice Zen' or 'All-U-Can-Eat-Rice' STEER CLEAR!"}
{"text":"I love sushi, AYCE more than anything! BUT I am 'that guy' who only eats cooked things...not much for fish, so if I am going to an AYCE sushi place the menu needs to be broad otherwise its a bunch of stuff I won't eat. Well, sushi zen rocks! Plently of rolls that you see everywhere and even more that they do in house. 'The Hulk' was AWESOME and their twist on the 'Japanese Lasagna' was great! (California roll with mozerella cheese and cream cheese melted on top) The *only* reason I gave it 4 and not 5 was that occasionally the rolls take longer than I would expect (not just the 'baked' rolls either), other than that this place is awesome. Friendly staff, remember who my wife, daughter and I are, never miss a refill on a drink, overall very nice!  We go at least once a month!"}
{"text":"Just came here from a long road trip and it hit the spot!  After being indecisive about what to order Gilo, the friendly sushi Chef, asked us our food preferences and offered several recommendations. We could tell he was attentive bc we loved every single sushi roll he brought out.   Andrei, our waiter, was also very hospitable!   The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 bc I have yet to try other items on the menu.  However, bc of the excellent service I will surely come back.   Arigato Gilo & Andrei!"}
{"text":"I've been here numerous of times. The first time I would have to say wasn't the greatest experience. For some reason the waitress suggested I try the sweet shrimp since I asked what it was exactly, it was completely nasty. It tasted totally raw and wasn't what I expected or sweet at all. I've had it at another restaurant and they were delicious I just don't recommend that to anyone unless they're fully cooked.The sushi rolls were perfectly fine and delicious. As well as the miso soup, house & cucumber salad. The yakitori skewers were tasty but very small. The bento boxes are also very good and the price isn't bad for the amount that you get. I still go here from time to time and the waiter they have is also very very nice."}
{"text":"Okay we paid $25.99 for each person tonight.  That's upper side of AYCE sushi.  Owner is Japanese for a change and that doesn't mean it's better than other place.   Food quality is mediocre and there is a huge problem with this place.    RICE! For some odd reason every Japanese own AYCE since 1990s I have visited in US has one thing in common.  They put more rice than anything.  Actual food we ate today was mostly rice not even 50/50, it was more like 25/75.   People, there are so many AYCE sushi places in Las Vegas that gives you better quality of food and charges $2-3 more than here.  They didn't even have Sea Urchin or Sweet Shrimp for nigiri.    My suggestion is don't spend $27 per person plus tip and drive to sushi koma and you tell me which one is worth your money."}
{"text":"Okay you go in and you wait a while a long while as there is no one there in the place but maybe 3 or 4 people! Than you order you first meal a roll or sushi or a cooked dish. But get this you are waiting for your order for 15 mins as you wait there  is no one there in the restaurant maybe 3 to 4 people. As you wait you think WHAT THE HELL AM I WAITING FOR ? NOTHING! They take too long and there is too much rice if u do the all you can eat be ready to do more waiting than eating really take up our time and take our money without really eating anything SERIOUSLY! I have been to so many places i have never waited so long for one dish or just waiting for someone to respond when there is really no one there. This is so bad i would never ever come here again! Just go somewhere else save your time and money. Make a trip to another Japanese place to go eat you will thank me later! The slowest Place ever! F.Y.I  NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO EAT THAT MUCH RICE REALLY ALL RICE NO FOOD ! THANKS HOPE THIS HELPED REALLY DONT GO !"}
{"text":"I ate here only once.  They served me cold miso soup and rice that was crusty.  The sushi was horrible.  The fish was not fresh.  The service sucked.  I had to ask for a check.  I had to ask for everything from drinks to napkins.  I never went back.  This place is one of the worst sushi places and I have tried a lot of sushi restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm sad, but I really didn't like their sushi. The rice was extremely sticky and had a bad flavor. The fish didn't taste fresh and it was pressed onto the gross sticky rice. I have had better sushi at Walmart or Smiths.   I'm giving 2 stars for the very friendly staff and their appetizers. The serrano  poppers are very tasty but be careful they are very very spicy. I also had the miso soup and the vinegared cucumber salad.  Unfortunately, we decided to do all you can eat and after we tasted the sushi we migrated back to the appetizer menu. Ended up paying a ton of money for a half roll that I could barely swallow, one or two orders of nigiri, which was not edible and some appetizers.   Note to self: Don't order AYCE when you are eating somewhere the first time."}
{"text":"I was dying for an avocado roll, and decided to try this place since it's been staring at me for 6 years (I live within walking distance.) I went with my sister and sat at the sushi bar. The service was friendly enough, I guess. Once the chef and the teenage guy working there saw two cute teenage girls walk in, our side of the bar no longer existed, and a girl from the back came out to bring us our rolls. No refills on drinks, and had to ask for the check. I honestly don't think one of the guys checked on us after those girls walked in. it was pretty bad.  Onto the food... The cucumber salad was really good and the portion was larger than other sushi places, but it also cost 4.00. for cucumber salad. Miso soup was standard run of the mill miso soup. My avocado roll had a tiny sliver of green in the middle and thats it. Even though it only cost 4.00, I still felt kind of scammed. My sister said her spicy salmon roll was just okay, it was finely diced salmon in rice with a huge wallop of sriracha on top. I'm not sure I wouldve trusted the fish from this place anyway, so I'm glad I stuck with an avocado roll. :X drinks cost 2.75, for kind of tasteless iced green tea, which is okay if you get refills, but when you don't, it's kind of like saying \"bite the pillow, it's going in dry.\"  I won't be back, but at least I can say I tried it."}
{"text":"I wrote a review on this place sometime ago but for some reason it isn't here anymore. So, I am going to rewrite it for everyone. About a year ago I found Sushi Zen. A couple of friends and I stopped in one night to check this place out. On their menu that offered all-you-can-eat-and-dinner for somewhere around $40 bucks. We all ordered it because it seem like a pretty good deal. We each ordered our food, a beer each, and two hot sakes to share. While we ate our meals, which were sushi rolls made out of almost all rice, we finished our drinks. Then, we tried ordered a second round of beers and our waiter informed our that we would have to pay extra for them because our hour was up. I asked him to show me where it said we only had an hour to drink and he said he was supposed to tell us but forgot. Needless to say he didn't get a cash tip from us. But I'm going to go ahead and give him is tip now. If you treat your customers right, they will treat you right. All in all, we paid around $160 to have rolled up rice, slow service, and a round of beers. Las Vegas is a city of dining opinions; I would advise anyone looking for a place to eat to pick a different opinion then Sushi Zen!"}
{"text":"Well, I stopped into SZ because I was craving sushi and it happened to be very convenient...But, man, I WISH I had bypassed this place. I think this may have been the WORST sushi I have ever had :(...It's very unfortunate because the staff was fairly friendly (though not professional by any means) and made you feel welcome...but that does not compensate for the poor quality of the food, the dark and unpleasant restaurant setup/atmosphere (it was SUPER dark and the lights in the bartop fridges that house the fish were NOT EVEN ON).  The rice was SUPER overcooked and the fish was definitely not the highest quality nor anywhere NEAR being fresh. And people this comes from someone that eats it ALL. I tried, I really did, but everything that was given to me looked as if it would give me food poisoning due to being old, out of recommended temperature and made with ingredients that were walked back and forth from the kitchen from across the room. The staff had on random clothes versus anything uniform and....it was just a strange experience overall.  My rating, however, is primarily based on the low quality food served."}
{"text":"This sushi restaurant falls short. I've been to many sushi restaurants around town and this restaurant falls in service and quality of the food.  PROS: - near my house  CONS: - quality of food(mostly warmed up in a microwave) - service (under staffed)  They're very nice but the food needs to step up. Warming food in a microwave is not fresh. And maybe hire another server instead of having one person for the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"I feel bad for this place. It was literally dead they didn't even have all the lights turned on, employees were just sitting around watching movies on the tvs. Unfortunately since it was dead I was hesitant to even eat the sushi, so I got baked salmon. It wasnt bad kind of bland the rice was hard. But the employees were really nice here..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite sushi places in town. Family owned small venue, staff is VERY friendly and attentive and also helpful with any questions you might have.  Plenty of appetizers included in the AYCE price, specialty rolls available, everything is fresh.  If you're feeling adventurous, ask about the shot they serve with roe, green onions and a quail egg =D"}
{"text":"Disorganized \"Management\" serving all you can eat smelly white rice!!  No fish to speak of in their \"sushi\"...give me a break!"}
{"text":"My sister and I always go to SZ because their operating techniques have a family oriented vibe. They are very personable and attentive. They do tend to get really busy on the weekends and do their best to serve as quickly as possible with updates for those who are waiting for a table. I love their fresh sushi rolls! They can make anything no matter how customized the request may be. The owner makes me hiyashi chuka, which is not on the menu, and it is very fresh and delicious! They always aim to please and strive for perfection on each order. I will continue to be a patron because I love the people and the food."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking to try a new place, and with Yelp's help, we walked into Sushi Zen. It's a typical strip mall sushi place. The long counter had only about a third of it open, but that's all that was needed on this Saturday night. There was one table of four, another three people at the counter, and then the two of us. Despite the small number of clients, the service was incredibly S L O W. It took a very long time before we received our first roll. And, the drink service was equal- we went empty serval times as the wait staff never came around. Oddly, as the night wore on and the three at the bar left and then the table of four, and it was just us...it was still slow. The sushi chef was nice. He's American and we learned he trained under his mother-in-law. This is a family owned business.   The nigiri sushi itself is uninspiring, a solid average. But the rolls are surprisingly incredible. We could tell there was a great deal of thought that went into their design, and the creation took quite awhile as well. Between the two of us, we tried 5 different rolls. A couple were a solid good, a couple were great, and one was amazing. At $25 for all you can eat, a $50 bill for two at sushi isn't unreasonable. If you prefer traditional nigiri sushi, there are far better places, but, if you are all about the rolls, I recommend you give this place a try. Slow, but good."}
{"text":"I went there a long time ago, but when I did go, there was only one girl working in the front. So she was the only one making the sushi. We went in the afternoon.  So my brother and I ordered AYCE, and I honestly thought it was basically a crappy work of art and taste. I don't know if it was because of the girl who made it for us, or what? But she put WAY too much rice. and I couldn't even pick up a single piece of sushi with my chopsticks (and hands) without it falling apart! Absolutely irritating!   I've been to so MANY different AYCE sushi places, and I was basically utterly disappointed with this place.  I've read recent reviews and I guess things have looked up for this place, or I had bad luck and had a horrible sushi chief.  However, although there are really alot of good reviews about this place, I'm pretty iffy about going back :("}
{"text":"Decent all you can eat but a bit dirty inside. I'd rather eat at the Denny's next door then risk getting sick here again. Yes, I said again. The meat looks like its been left over from the night before and the cooks are American so this is an americanized sushi place that just doesn't cut it."}
{"text":"Seriously FRESH AMAZING sushi with great prices! The staff goes above and beyond to take care of you. Friendly warm inviting atmosphere but seriously really great sushi!"}
{"text":"Eh. Last time I ate here the waiter understood that i don't eat meat and don't like to pay for meat im not eating, therefore he gave me Xtra Tempura Veggies instead of the Shrimp which comes with the order and is $6.95. Well tonight, the sweet older lady said Not to worry, but when she brought it out it was no more than 6 pieces of veggies. For $6.95. I think not."}
{"text":"Nice family run establishment. Gave the stars on just shear effort. They are short on team members, and could use help. Orders took awhile to come out, and our baby was getting uneasy at it got later in the night.   As for food. The fish was good, and just a tad heavy on sauces. Overall good experience, and wouldn't shy away from coming back to see if they have improved. Give'em a try."}
{"text":"My first experience with this restaurant was about two years ago. The rolls were good, the price was decent and the fried rice was fantastic! Unfortunately, every experience I have had with Sushi Zen since then has gotten progressively worse.  The food quality has declined substantially. The once delicious fried rice has become mediocre, The miso is bland and the rolls are unimpressive compared to other Sushi restaurants at similar prices. My last experience with this restaurant was exceptionally bad. I was served an iced tea that tasted like old bath water, and my sashimi appetizer was pathetic- only containing a few scraps of fish and being less than 1/2 the size of such an appetizer at any other restaurant. The one positive that Sushi Zen has going on is great service. Staff is fast and friendly and that makes the experience much more enjoyable, but just doesn't make up for the terrible food.  I'm very disappointed that this place has gone down hill since it's so close to my house. Hopefully they will go out of business and another Sushi place will take the spot that can provide better food."}
{"text":"Me and the wife have been living close to Sushi Zen and decided to go give it a try. This is my first place that I have ever been for sushi and the experience was very good. The place is comfortable and the menu is easy to read and they have a lot of options. The price for single sushi dishes can be pretty expensive so we decided to try the all you can eat which was 24.95/person.. they also have a all you can eat/drink for a little over 30/person which includes alcohol. This may seem pricey however the dishes you can get range from any appetizer, sushi, nigiri, rolls, desert. They have so many options from many varieties of fish, caviar, sea eel, sea urchin, crab, scallops, soft shell crab, oysters, squid and many others. The price we paid was well worth the experience and we will most definitely be making another visit. The employees were great and spoke fluent english. The place is family owned and everyone has a friendly vibe. I was joking about how I tried the urchin but it wasn't my thing and the guy who was making the sushi agreed and taught me about the fish and what to look for in freshness and flavor. A great experience and one that should not be missed."}
{"text":"I'm a bit of a regular here.  I have never ever had a bad experience at Zen.  It's family owned, so expect to wait a little longer for your rolls, but sit at the bar and chat with the guy making the sushi and just enjoy the place.  He's super friendly and will make custom stuff for you if you ask.    The AYCE is a great deal, as it includes 90% of the appetizers as well.  I think the sashimi plate is the only exception.  Do yourself a favor and order the salmon collar off the appetizer menu.  It's a chunk of broiled salmon with just a little salt and pepper that will have you checking and rechecking the plate long for more long after you have devoured every piece.  They only get 3-4 of these with each supply order, but they have always had one when I asked for it.      They also have a wide selection of the standard rolls plus some house specialties and weekly \"experiments\".  My favorite, the Amazon roll is beautiful to look at and absolutely delicious.  The Hulk roll is fun and tasty to boot, and the caterpillar is another of my favorites.    I have never, in the 20 or so times I have eaten there, had the problems with frozen fish or service mentioned in other reviews here.  Understaffed as they may be, you couldn't ask for a friendlier staff.  The matron of the family often comes out from working the back and I have been sent home with free items just by virtue of being a friendly, familiar face.  Eating at Zen is always a treat for me and my family and we really enjoy each and every opportunity we have to dine there."}
{"text":"it was just okay for me.. no wow factors.  I had always driven pass this place, so one night instead of driving elsewhere we went here. Taste wise I wasn't impressed. The teriyaki was dry even w/ sauce. My California roll was good, that's a pretty hard roll to mess up. I wont be going back here."}
{"text":"I love Sushi! This place just rubbed me the wrong way.  In the short, service was bad. It took 10min to get my seaweed and cucumber salad. 2 rolls avg. 15 min waits. The restaurant had, including our party of 3, 13 people in it. We ordered all you can eat sushi so time was important. We were able to get 6 rolls of 80% rice and 20% bad raw fish.   I had to vomit when I got home. And I did. I will try this sushi place one more time in a month to see if it was just today they were off.   Sushi on Rainbow is the best Sushi so far in Vegas."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place a few months back. We just recently moved to North Las Vegas and was just driving around the area. To our surprise this place was pretty darn good! We've been here about a dozen times and have told others about it. There's never a wait during dinner time and the price is about average! The sushi is pretty fresh! I highly recommend the spider rolls and the box dinners! :)"}
{"text":"My husband never tried sushi before and we were looking for a good spot so a friend recommended this place. Just horrible and never gone back since. It was lunch time and not very busy, my husband was skeptical so I told him he can just try one or some of my different rolls (All you can eat). The waitress tell me no sharing on the all you can eat (standard). I told her we weren't sharing just him tasting/trying the sushi. She said No and watched us the entire meal, ridiculous. The sushi was gross, none of it tasted fresh. My husband got the chicken teriyaki and he was even disappointed with it. Said it was dry and the flavor wasn't there. Thanks but no thanks Sushi Zen."}
{"text":"This was our second visit here and both times we have not been disappointed.  The rolls are very good, Sapporo is always cold, and the service is good.   Their sushi bar seats about 15, the tables around 25.  There is plenty of elbow room but no wasted space.  Two flat screen tv's behind the bar will provide entertainment; 1st time we were here Wipeout was on and everyone in here had a great time watching it and interacting.  Today the Spurs/heat game is on.  The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food.  Definitely on our \"we will be back\" list."}
