{"text":"We went in on a Wed night hoping theyd be like a steak and shake. After sitting in our booth for 15 minutes being ignored, we sent one of the kids to the counter asking where to order at. another 5 minutes passes and a waiter comes to the table, service was slow, we had to beg for drink refills, 1 of the kids meals was made wrong, and my 15 yr old brother ordered bbq wings from the appetizer section and they brought him chicken strips and fries, he ate that because he didn't want to wait even longer then we had. We won't go back. Tried it once, and that was enough,  a shame the food sucks because my husband really liked his shake!"}
{"text":"Worst service ever from Little girls at the register, I don't know how they got that job or any job.. because they have no customer service experience seems like. Just talking and hanging out. If your ordering out They don't care if your food has been done they won't tell you. You have to go get it, but they will cater to the young men and give them their food. Doesn't even deserve 1 star"}
{"text":"Awesome burger.  This is the first time ever eating at a johnny rockets.  This location is smaller than the ones I've seen on the strip.  Took away one star for the size of the restaurant and the cigerette smoke odor coming from the casino.   Great burger at a decent price."}
{"text":"Horrible service, the waiters are extremely unorganized. After 30 minutes of waiting for a server my gf had to go ask if someone could take our order. Amazingly, the food came out fairly fast. I never got a refill on my soda which really sucked after being full off my burger. Oh and let's not forget the \"bottomless fries\" never was asked if we wanted more. Now I been waiting here for a good 20 minutes waiting for a check. I'm sure we could just easily walk out and no one would even notice. Hands down the service here is pathetic. If I could give them negative stars I'd give them -5 stars. Never coming back to this dump."}
{"text":"First time here. Service was horrible. Seemed like no one was happy except the manager. Took forever to get the food. Order was wrong. Would not recommend this place save your money."}
{"text":"We went with a Groupon offer for a buy one get one free combo order. Never had so much trouble using a coupon before!  The manager on staff was kind enough to \"let us use the offer\" even tho we wanted to order a veggie burger instead of a meat burger.  We got charged for our drinks which should have been included with the combo offer. Whatever.  I like their food."}
{"text":"We were offered the table right be the entrance but I informed the host I'd rather wait for a less trafficked table. It took them 10 minutes to clean up after another customer, and right as I was going to sit down, the staff seated another couple that had JUST walked in, at the location I had been waiting for!  When I politely asked wtf the hostess just shrugged and stuck us at a half booth right next to the bathroom.  The worst customer service in recent memory. Avoid at all costs!!!"}
{"text":"Worst Johnny rockets ever. For a Friday night you would think that the good staff would be on duty. At time of service the place wasn't busy at all, but yet we had to wait 15 min for a server and another 30 min before we decided to leave. The cook was slow and dirty, always dropping food on the floor and not changing his gloves after picking up said food. I don't recommend this place for a Friday night out."}
{"text":"Food was ok, overpriced for burgers. BUT I'm giving 2 stars because of the service staff. 

Service staff at the counter was surly and unhappy. I had to repeat myself a couple of times as she stared at me blankly when I ordered. 

My order for a couple of burgers, drink and pie took a long time. And I had to check my order, ask for sauce, ask for plastic utensils. 

I'm on holiday, so was in a positive mood, so I thought nah, maybe it's just me. But as I was waiting for my order to be ready, I noticed her snarling at other customers as well. 

I'm not asking for the best service ever, but is it too hard to just give minimal service without the surliness?"}
{"text":"Something was wrong with the produce - burgers made me and my kid sick. Awesome milkshakes though. Fries were average. Good atmosphere and friendly service. Wish we ate somewhere else."}
{"text":"We can eat at any restaurant on the Las Vegas strip and we choose to come to Johnny Rockets to get the best customer service from the coolest dude we ever met Thomas. He's very funny, provides excellent customer service, and is a whiz on the cash register!!!   2 thumbs up for Thomas?!"}
{"text":"If you want to wait an hour for your food then you are at the right Johnny Rockets. Not only that if you say the opposite of what you want on your burger, you will get what you did not want on your burger. No Joke! 

Since we were staying at the Aliante hotel for a couple of nights, we decided to get a quick bite to eat, so why not go to the food court, it's fast anyway? Exactly my point, if I wanted to be in a sit down restaurant I would have gone to the buffet or another restaurant. At least in a sit down restaurant your food comes out at least 20 to 30 minutes and they will probably get your order right.

To start it off with my bad experience here I ordered my daughter a Philly cheese steak with no onions but with cheese and sauteed mushrooms. They gave me the total opposite of what I ordered; my daughters Philly cheese steak had onions and no cheese and no mushrooms. I decided to get the route 66 burger with cheese and extra mushrooms. There was no cheese and like 4 pieces of mushroom. Really!?!  And to top it all off we waited for 45 minutes to get our food. We weren't the only customers that was very frustrated with our orders and the waiting time. 

I will definitely not be back to this Johnny Rockets again!"}
{"text":"Worst burger I have ever eaten. Absolutely foul. Long wait to order and then a ten minute wait for the burger to be made. I do not get the hype at all. I had the chicken burger. Perhaps I should have stuck with the hamburger."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Slow, but friendly, service. Food was bland. Place was clean. Shakes were good. Haven't been to a johnny rockets in years. Don't think I will go back. I'm actually surprised johnny rockets is still around."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place, but super non plussed by the food. Extremely pricey for a tiny, tiny bland tasteless burger. The fries were obviously from a frozen brand. The food was so tiny and bad that we actually went out AFTER eating there. We never went back."}
{"text":"I work just a few blocks away from Johnny Rockets and have never been there before, so my Husband picked me up today at lunchtime and we went there for lunch. I literally sat down for less than 20 seconds and didn't even have my purse off of my shoulder before our server was hounding us for a drink order. Having never been there, I had to quickly glance at the menu which listed Pepsi products, so I ordered a pepsi. She then tells me that they only have Coke products. (??) So Coke it is, fine.  She returns a minute later ready to take our lunch order and proceeds to explain the Manager's special is \"The Original\".  Again, 1st time there, so I order the special and she asks if I would like everything on the burger.  Everything BUT mustard, I tell her. My Husband orders a patty melt.  Food arrived and I literally had a mustard soaked burger.  We tell the manager, who apologizes (although I'm feeling this was not out of sincerity, but rather obligation) and offers to make another burger.  But I explain that I am on my lunch break and do not have enough time to wait for another burger to be prepared, eat it, and travel back to work.  The server also then comes over and apologizes.  Fine.  I ate less than 40% of the burger that had the least amount of mustard on it.  There was so much of it that it was literally on my rings, and my fingers were yellow, no joke!  Then the bill arrives and I couldn't believe that there was no offer of a discount whatsoever.  What a poor first (and last) trip to Johnny Rockets.  Ugh!"}
{"text":"A fun 50's style diner with cool decor. They have a retro styled jukebox that offers classics from various artists. Very small washrooms. Staff are decked out in 50's diner uniforms. Sometimes they dance and sing but that's rare these days. 

Burgers are big and homemade. Nothing special, but better than regular burgers from other diners. Shakes are old school but they use cheap ice cream which hurts the overall taste of the shakes. The fries are average. Onion rings taste like frozen Mccain rings. 

Service varies from day to day. Sometimes they are very upbeat and service is fast. Sometimes you could wait 20 minutes for your order. There has been certain cooks in the past that spent more time horsing around than cooking your order. The downside of having an open kitchen concept. 

More often than not the place is packed with kids from the university and familes. They stay there for hours sometimes. On a few occassions my family and I went to get something to eat but it was packed and had lots of people waiting in line for seats. We decide to go see a movie first and eat afterwards. When we go back to J.R.  sometimes we see the same kids still sitting in their booths 2 hours later. Insane since there's so many people always waiting for seats. 

We've eaten there 20 times last year. My kids love the burgers and decor. My daughter loves to sing and dance with the waiters."}
{"text":"Dissapointing. Gone is all the fun things that made it tolerable to buy a 10 burger. Counter ordering, no singing, and the experience of being in a diner is gone. As well as having a very limited beverage selection. My burger came cooked so far past well it was crazy, like a gray cardboard puck. 

Ob the plus side everyone working there was friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered two simple burgers.
An original with only lettuce, mayonnaise and American cheese. And a veggie burger with only lettuce, mayonnaise, tomatoes and cheese.
We got an original with tomatoes and onions and a veggie with onions and no cheese. 
Ended up being the driest and most terrible burger I've had. Should have asked for my money back, go anywhere but here for a burger -__-"}
{"text":"I was starving and stopped here to have a good burger. The burger tasted horrible!! Just horrible!! If you are starving, anything should taste good, but this was a nightmare and mere waste of money. Also, burgers are expensive here!! Warn you not to waste your money here."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill! $15 for a small burger fries and a drink. No selection on the menu, not like it used to be at least. Shakes are $6!!! I regretted coming here as soon as I saw the menu. We could have gone across the road for a $15 steak with 2 sides"}
{"text":"This Johnny Rockets is located in the Excalibur Hotel.  Very bright and clean, it offers a good selection of good old fashion hamburgers.  The burgers are excellent.  Very juicy like your mother used to make.  The fries and onion rings are another matter however.  These are both bland and taste like you had picked up a frozen package of fries for the local grocery store- very disappointing for the price.  The only bright spot here was the sweet potato fries; very good."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of eating food that taste like melted plastic this is the place for you. Don't worry about the wait or how long it takes to microwave the plate of garbage about to be served to you , cause it will be a while. This place is top notch if you're out for a quick bite of the worst food you've ever tried. The wait is ridiculous and the food taste like the anus of a Klingon, steer clear of this place if you have taste buds or dignity."}
{"text":"After having my flight delayed by 5+ hours and getting to vegas at 1 am instead of getting there at 7 pm, I dropped off my things at my hotel and entered the Flamingo Hotel's food court and ate at this place. Best burger I have ever had in my life! The fries were fresh and the milkshake was fantastic!"}
{"text":"A differenza delle recensione, sarò stata fortunata ma ho assaggiato l hambuger più buono di sempre. Lo straconsiglio sopratutto quello con bacon e cheddar,la fine del mondo. Ci ritornerei volentieri se potessi."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for a quick bite and am not impressed. 

You are going to end up paying Chili's price for a burger, but with drive-thru quality. If they toast your bun, consider yourself lucky. If your fries are hot, consider yourself lucky. If your burger fix-ins aren't spilled out all over your plate like a gutted pig when you get it, consider yourself lucky.

This joint definitely needs to work on quality and consistency."}
{"text":"Good Customer Service, nice people. I like Rachel. When i Went Friday, she welcomed me with a good greetings and great smile. Apparently had problem with the shake we bought night before that. She fixed it for me and gave me another shake. The best shake in town. We will keep coming back me and my family."}
{"text":"Visited Kennywood for the first time with friends who live in Pittsburgh. Went to Johnny Rockets for lunch. The service was great! The sever recommended a delicious burger, Route 66 highly recommend that now as well. Next time I visit, I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good service despite the rush from the hockey game.  Tiffany, our server, was tops!  Good food, good service!"}
{"text":"Food was good but very expensive and waited about 45 min to be served."}
{"text":"I thought this place was easy on the wallet and I found out NO it's not. This place is too LOUD. I have to say that the service we received was good. The overall bill for 3 burgers 1 kids meal and 3 sodas was $45, that's a lot dough for me. Then I got to thinking damn I should have taken my kids to In and Out and still had 20 bucks left over. For me the value to what I ate wasn't there. But I have to say the server we got was great. Just not for me."}
{"text":"Gegenüber dem Hard Rock Hotel gelegen ist Johnny Rockets eine super Empfehlung für den typisch amerikanischen Snack zwischen den vielen Casinobesuchen.
1986 eröffnete in Los Angeles das erste Johnny Rockets. Seitdem begann eine beispiellose Erfolgsgeschichte. Mittlerweile gibt es Johnny Rockets Restaurants in über 20 Bundesstaaten. Allein in Las Vegas sind es momentan 8 Filialen.
Jedes Restaurant ist im Diner-Style eingerichtet: Rot, Chrome und typische Accessoires eines All-American-Restaurants. Auf jedem Tisch steht eine kleine Jukebox.
Die Karte hält alle Sünden bereit: Hamburgers, Sandwiches, Chili Fries, Shakes, Malts, Brownies, Sundaes etc."}
{"text":"Came to this place while on a lunch break they were no to busy sat there a good ten minutes before even acknowledged then they ask what I would like they guy stop wiping down the tables and starts cooking my food without washing his hands"}
{"text":"average classic burger for $10 and pretty quick service."}
{"text":"My bro and I had a milk shake and it wasn't to the top like other johnny rockets,I asked the server and he  said his manager tells him 3 scopes only and that's why it isn't to the top,but they charger over 6 dlls and it's a rip off cause it should be to the top,never going back to that place again"}
{"text":"Worst restaurant experience I've had in my life!

I had over $100 in comps on my totals rewards card, which you can pay with there. Of course after eating and trying to pay my bill they tell me the machine isn't working and that I have to pay with cash or credit. This defeats the purpose of me going in the first place. Instead of finding someone to resolve the situation, they decide to treat me like a criminal and threaten me and call security as if I'm running off without paying. Security comes over and calls a casino rep, who was extra nice to me and took care of it so fast. The whole ordeal with management at Johnny Rockets took almost an HOUR! Why couldn't they just have handled it better and called the casino rep themselves? But no, they decide to be total asses and make threats and treat me like a criminal. Why would I EVER want to go back there? Absolutely the WORST people in the business. DON'T GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY"}
{"text":"Did not hate it.

Took a long time. 

Was mediocre perhaps. 

Thought about returning, never have.

Hmm..."}
{"text":"I would have to say the service was maybe four stars. Food, ambiance and pricing for sure two stars. Hot and stuffy. I was expecting to hear good ol oldies on the jukebox while there but they only turned up the music loud enough to hear it twice.. and they did their clapping and dancing. The fact that a burger or sandwich for $8 plus does not come with choice of fries or onions rings is kinda a joke. Make a meal for $4.50 more? Pretty steep guys. Food took long time to come out. By the time it had been sitting in the window and got to the table it wasn't very hot. Onion rings and fries kinda stale and the meat patty on the burger overdone. The bussers  need to do a more thorough job at wiping the tables with at least a clean rag.. and don't forget the booths. Being in the restaurant management business over 20 years here are my suggestions... if you don't have the staff to efficiently serve customers.. close off a section of the place. If people have to wait to be seated then so be it. One kitchen line for the patio, and two large dining areas? I can see why it takes forever and the food ends up being cold. Perhaps you need to have more cooks on hand. But then again, it may be difficult to find quality help and people that want to work. It might be nice to have a manager go around to tables and check in with customers."}
{"text":"After a busy day shopping, my boyfriend and I decided to stop for lunch at Johnny Rockets.  We had an extremely enjoyable experience thanks to our sensational server Sherri.  Sherri greeted us as soon as sat down and we ordered water and shakes.  Sherri even gave us some ideas on what to do in town later that night, an added service for sure! 

I've never been to a Johnny Rockets so wasn't expecting to see singing and dancing.  I absolutely adored seeing our server Sherri participate in the entertainment and it added a nice oldies feel to the restaurant.  The food was tasty and the shakes were really thick.  I would definitely come back and request Sherri every time!"}
{"text":"1st time at this location. Ordered a $3.99 Chili to go. Small cup not even half filled. I showed employee and was told thats stardard amount. I measured chili volume as only half a cup which is only 4 oz of chili. WHAT A RIP OFF FOR A $3.99 CHILI. PLUS IT'S A HIGH TRAFFIC AREA. HARD TO PARK. I'LL STICK WITH WENDYS."}
{"text":"Both me and my wife got food poisoning from this place. It was the only meal we had in common all day."}
{"text":"In a word.. my experience at this location of Johnny Rockets was HORRIBLE. 

The bathrooms were disgusting. The fries were cold, even the cheese on the poutine hadnt melted at all since the fries and gravy were SO cold. my grilled cheese sandwich smelt like a strange mix of hairspray and oil used to fry onion rings. 

Never.Going.Back"}
{"text":"Taste is better than presentation.  Burger didn't come out looking like the picture on menu, order of fries was small for upgrade you pay, and the restaurant could use some cleaning up for a slow week night. But like I said, taste was not bad. Bread was buttery and 1/3 lb of meat is a lot to make you full.  They do offer birthday deals so go on their website and sign up."}
{"text":"Came in during breakfast... Ordered the Western Omelette, added sausages. And a Krispy Kreme doughnut. And everything came out EXTRA FRESH & delicious!! 

Shared this plate with my bf and we were actually both stuffed like turkeys! 

Loved their customer service! & they did a dance for the crowd....with the song \"R-E-S-P-E-C-T\""}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING. 
Last Thursday evening decided to stop and eat here because the Flamingos cafe was closed and food was good. 
Took a drink of ice tea and it tasted so foul it was unbelievable that's when I also noticed a smell coming from the Tea. 
I notified the employee and they also noticed the smell and came back after talking to manager and stated \"it always smells like that its always like that we filter it\" well I knew better and drank water and it pretty much ruined my dinner. So about 4-5 hours later WHAM nausea and vomiting time and cramping. Thank god the vomiting stopped quick. When notifying the assistant managers they showed no concern and really didn't care maybe lack of training so I filed a complaint with the health dept I'm sure they will get them to clean the lines and the tank etc"}
{"text":"I'd rather kill myself than eat at a johnny rockets. The absolute worst chain I've ever had the displeasure of going to. Horrible business model with no oversight from corporate, none of the staff care at all. Health code violations are rampant, no burgers come with fries. When you order fries you get 9, half of which weren't properly trimmed from whatever crappy factory they use to freeze them as they taste like rotten potatoes. The meat has no seasoning and tastes like a worn leather shoe. The bacon was floppy and so greasy you could use it to run a car engine. You'd think being based out of Arizona, at least the ones here would be decent, but no. My advice to corporate: please don't reproduce. Humanity doesn't deserve your offspring."}
{"text":"Gross restaurant. Needs to be cleaned. Floors are dirty. You can see food crust at times. Kinda stunk too. County needs to inspect!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely positively disgusting. Food is so oily, even for a diner. Serve staff was very good but god never again. About to throw up as I write this. Got a Philly Cheese steak for 16 dollars. The meat was like elastic and chewy and smelt and tasted funny. Disgusting and not even worth a penny."}
{"text":"Worst effing service ever! Sat down before 2 other parties right next to us. They were greeted and had their drinks and food ordered within a couple minutes. Meanwhile , we had to get our own menus from the cashier station then proceeded to wait 5 minutes with no sort of acknowledgement, greeting, or that our server/order would be taken. I know the fat cow of a server or manager saw us.....how could she miss us?......we were the only non-whites in the effing place!!I guess since we weren't a primarily white party that our money wasn't good enough and we're lowly second class citizens, even though we got there first. Had a good overall weekend at Silverton but this just ruined it. Thanks Johnny Rockets Silverton! (Insert sarcasm).  Yeah that one star requirement is obligatory bullshit."}
{"text":"This place was horrible . The food they served me looked nothing like the picture and was cold when I got it . Look at the photo I posted . Also the service was horrible! Trust me save your money and don't eat at this place ."}
{"text":"Food looked just like the picture in the menu, which is rare. Manager was accommodating."}
{"text":"Loved this place! Simple good food and great service! We sat at the bar area and our waitress was so nice and helpful. Food came out fast and it was delicious! Great selection on the menu and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect! Our server (Brad) was very attentive AND had a very fun, easy going personality. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We used a Groupon too, although we've been to Johnny Rockets at other locations.  Two burgers, came with fries we didn't want, and two drinks, $33 before Groupon.  Are you kidding me!?  Could have gone to The Grind for better burger and environment for that price."}
{"text":"How is it that a manager has blue hair? To what I know most food companies don't allowed that kind of stuff, (pink, blue, green) those kinds of colors. Besides the fact that their customer service is HORRIBLE! Not looking forward to coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting to sit down for a real meal at Kennywood. I'd been to other Rocket locations before and knew the food was good so I said \"What the hell?\" And I went for it. The service was slow and they did these dumb dance routines while I waited for my food and others waited to be seated. It was good food, meh service that was slow. There was a 45 minute wait for some people and so many open tables! The review is getting a 3 cause of the sauce that comes with that smokehouse burger- the sauce is a must on any burger you get!"}
{"text":"Quality right up there with Steak n Shake & In n Out. One waitress for the whole dining room. Service was good, but slow because of this.  All in all a good experience"}
{"text":"Food is usually great but service was horrible this time. The hostess was not friendly at all. Sat us at our table and we did not have anyone take our order for drinks. I noticed 2 more families came in after us and got their order taken. They passed our table a few times without acknowledging us. So we just walked out."}
{"text":"Great food and service every time.  Huge shakes.  We've made it our before a family movie place."}
{"text":"Went to the arrowhead mall location and I will not be going back. The food was disgusting, the waiter looked like he got ready for work about 3 min before his shift. This was my first time trying this restaurant and I will actually recommend people going to red robin for around the same price."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner because I honestly love their chili. Expecting just the regular Johnny Rocket's experience, I was blown away with how attentive our server, Calvin was. He was funny, made us welcome, and seemed to really enjoy his job. And he was a SHAKE MASTER. He made me a peanut butter and banana shake and it was amazing. So thick I think I may have broken the straw. Amazing service and good food. Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"The hamburgers are decent but nothing to write home about.  I have yet to try their milkshakes because I feel they are overpriced but may one day suck it up and pay for an expensive shake.  Their food is a little on the pricey side but I think that is because it is in a casino.  I have noticed that restaurants in casinos have a tendency to have overpriced food that is not the greatest quality but the food is by no means horrible.  The only reason I tried this place is because of a groupon and I still had to pay extra because the food is overpriced.  They do not bundle a meal or make combos.  Everything is a la carte.  So be prepared to pay extra."}
{"text":"Husband and I checked this place out while in Vegas... I am really picky about chilli cheese fries and theirs were pretty darn yummy! Kind of expensive but still good... I think the only thing that bothered me was the proximity to a kids play area. And since the restaurant isn't enclosed, the screaming kids got on my nerves a little bit"}
{"text":"Good burgers and fries just ok. Service quick and efficient. Place nice throwback to yesterday's."}
{"text":"This was the worst fast food place I've ever eaten at. I had the grilled chicken sandwich which tasted like plain, lukewarm rubber. It was so bad I couldn't stomach more than a couple bites. The French fries were soggy and lukewarm too. The food here is overpriced and poor quality. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Better than nothing...  The food choices at Mandalay Bay suck.  At least I could get a piece of grilled chicken breast with lettuce and tomato.  Everything else in the food court was pretty much deep fried."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch after walking around AZ mills, The place was PACKED! the hostess said there would be a 20 min wait for a booth, so i ended up just getting a milkshake to go. I ordered the apple pie shake( which was $5.42 with tax) I waited 25 min for the shake :( it was an OK shake and a regular size, definitely not worth the $5.42 and a 25 min wait. Next time ill go when its not so busy. I gave 3 stars because I've eaten here before and the burgers are pretty good."}
{"text":"Thank you Johnny Rockets for having such a tasty buger (for a food court), friendly staff, and 24 hr service.  It may take a little longer to get your food here compared to the other fast food joints in the Aliente food court but it is well worth the wait."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times, mostly because it's cute and at a convenient location. 
Most of the times I've gone hasn't been too bad, pretty average and not outrageous prices so I've been back a few times now, but I definitely won't be back again.
The service last time I went was just awful. We were seated right away and then I guess just forgotten about? The server came back a while later to take our orders and then it was probably 40 minutes before our simple burgers came.
I still give  stars because there was nothing wronggg with the food, but after a few times of mediocre food and service, this one bad experience ruined the place for me. :("}
{"text":"Amiss hearing bad things about it, my husband and I decided to try out Johnny rockets for the first time. The atmosphere was fun, the employees seemed to be having a great time, dancing and singing along to the music. The choreographed dance all the servers did was great, the sunglasses were a cute touch too! Our waitress's red lipstick, 50's style hair and charming personality fit the theme perfectly. She was a delight! The food took a very long time to come out but once it did, it was well worth the wait. We defiantly got the full Johnny Rockets experience!"}
{"text":"Food was slow & not very tasty. The peppermint shake advertised tasted nothing like peppermint & cost $7.95!! I expected a thick, creamy, heavily flavored peppermint shake. Nope. Thin, lumpy vanilla flavored. Not worth it at all! Plus it wasn't ready by the time our food was at the table but weren't told it was still coming.  We just assumed they forgot to make it & looked for the waitress to ask.  She hadn't brought my friend's ice tea either. When she finally came over she had forgotten the tea but the shake was still being made.  When my friend said at this point just cancel it she immediately brought the tea.  We had a $12 Groupon & they had to remove the nice military discount on order to use a groupon. Food too expensive for its lack of taste & quality.  My first & last time to Johnny Rockets."}
{"text":"How can you do this? Terrible is an understatement. No more table service. No refills on drinks or fries. No service!! We won't be back!!enter a que. place order. Sit down and wait for minimally interactive staff to bring food in a paper bag! When we got our order me and my wife felt
Like they wanted us to take our food and leave! Really?? Talk about cutting corners! Overpriced is also an understatement. Charge me over 3$ for a drink and then avoid coming around to offer a refill. Really?? Fountain soda is pennies in cost and that type service goes a long way. At this rate you might as well close and allow another cafeteria type product to be there! We won't be back unless this changes"}
{"text":"Peanut butter shake is to die for, ask for well blend thick/ heavy . Individual/counter seats are available ad well as tables (food court style). Some items may not be available as this is not a full sized restaurant. Be careful when ordering \"original\" as it might be mistaken between burger and a milkshake.
Staff is good ."}
{"text":"Had launch today, route 66 with lemonade. The route 66(burger) was delicious but way oily than it suppose to be. Staff is friendly and seatings are quite sufficient."}
{"text":"We got there at 1230 for lunch before our movie at 150. They only had two waitresses working despite in being a si day agtwrnoon and pretty busy. We sat and ordered relatively quickly but it took 20min to get our drinks. Another twenty minutes later and our food came with out the fries, thise showed up 15minutes later. I had ordered a tuna salad sandwhich and they had made me a tuna melt, i informed the waitress and she kind of scoffed took the sandwich and walked away, by now we were getting close to our movie time so whe. The waitress came back to fill my drink i asked her of she could cancel the sandwhich because we had to leave. She said they already started making it and i would have to pay for two samswhiches and i dont want to. Umm ok, ill never be back to this location again. Waitresses name was Tristan."}
{"text":"I liked the reminiscent 1950s set-up, but the Johnny's burger  I had was nothing special. The fries were fine-- nothing special either. Unfortunately, as I got halfway through my burger, I spotted a blob of white solid fat surrounded by raw bloody meat, which killed my appetite. I'm sure I said \"well-done.\" In any case, I doubt I'll feel like eating here again."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would!  It took an hour to get our food, and all we had was a chili dog, a kids hamburger meal, and a cheeseburger!  The wait was made even more unpleasant by the same 4 songs playing over and over.  Oh...and the place was only half full!  I kind of expected an $8 hot dog to be delicious but the food is bland and lukewarm.  Service is dismal.  Overall experience is awful.  Don't go here.  The potato patch is 10 times better."}
{"text":"Came here with an Australian friend I ran into, we wanted to do the whole American diner thing, and boy was it fun.

Very warm welcome for us, as a Brit & an Aussie we instantly hit it off with the staff and had a laugh.

Food was superb, I LOVED the chilli cheese fries, very hard to find over here and actually enjoy. Had the Chicken Philly cheese steak and it was great, really well prepared and quickly delivered. Prices were fantastic and service efficient and friendly. I'd love to come again for lunch."}
{"text":"Only took 10 minutes to be greeted and sat and they weren't very busy.  Also, nothing like going to an American 50's style diner to have all Mexicans working.  Pretty sure I'll never come back."}
{"text":"The chicken club sandwich was pretty good. However, it took about 40 minutes to get our food. We just ordered a burger/fries and a sandwich. The server told us multiple times that our food would be coming but it never did. After we asked again, she went to check, and said 5 more minutes, when it took closer to 15 more. I have a feeling she never relayed the order to the cooks.
People coming in after us were getting their food and leaving. When the food finally came there was no explanation. Not sure if she even apologized. Right after she brought our food she came back in 10 seconds and asked how everything was....
We haven't even started eating yet! The workers would dance whenever this song came on. Less dancing, more serving please."}
{"text":"Quick and easy fast food type restaurant to grab a bite to eat while walking the Strip. Overpriced for sure but the food was tasty."}
{"text":"Was our second time here. Burgers were great. Server Diana Alcaraz was very friendly and displayed great customers service skills while dealing with other guests. There were two guests who were very needy and seemed pretty rude and she was polite and patient and did a great job. Will be back again for sure. Thank you for another great experience start to finish."}
{"text":"The burger was alright but the service wasn't good. I think I get better service from McDonald's where I don't give tips. I don't think I'll go again. At least this location."}
{"text":"Food sucked.  Service sucked worse.  Why bother when you can get mickey d's upstairs??  Overpriced and understaffed"}
{"text":"Best burger in Las Vegas!
I also love the chili and chili dogs!
This is coming from a serious foodie!
Seriously this place is so good and such quality food!




Great customer service and such great food!"}
{"text":"This is the first time I had ever been to a Johnny Rockets. The burger was okay but the waitress was not very nice. She seemed very rushed and a little irritated when I wanted a Turkey burger instead of a regular and a whole wheat bun. The fries were horrible: bland, cold and soggy.

BUT, I had the BEST vanilla milk shake ever here! It was enormous, malted and delicious. I abandoned my burger and focused on the shake. I think this place is better to get a Shake or a drink before seeing a movie next door."}
{"text":"Skip this place, its dirty and the service sucks... Grab a burger from the Cafe in the Casino, its about the same price and the food/service is better."}
{"text":"I have given this place 2 stars and the reason is because of the service and speed of food. The food quality was great, fries was good but the wait for food and our server was awful. My gf stated that if our server would have smiled it would have been a miracle. Again the food was good.. The service was awful"}
{"text":"Working off schedules at the hospital this month does have its benefits.  This morning, I saw my favorite girl and Smart Shopper Daphne Monroe on the news telling me about the deal of the day... burger, fries and milkshake from Johnny Rockets for only $3.99.  My partner has always refuses to eat there, and he was working, so why not try it?  My Smart Shopper card and I were on a mission.

I live close to one of the four participating locations, and got there at 11:30am.  I expected a line of Smart Shoppers to be waiting in line for the deal, and was surprised when there were only about 7 tables taken and 12 customers.  That should have been the first sign to run.

I quickly ordered the deal of the day, with a chocolate shake, and a diet coke.  The waitress took my order, and quickly returned with my soda and some nickels for the jukebox.  Cool.  Then I waited.  And waited.  And waited.....

After about 40 minutes and three diet cokes, I overheard a conversation between the manager and my waitress.  Mind you the place is open, which means the grill is in view, the shake maker, etc.  I wasn't even near the center and was able to hear.  My waitress told the manager that one of her customers wanted a soda instead of a shake.  The manager told her too bad, the deal comes with a shake, so they needed to pay for the soda.  Were they talking about me?  I always expected to pay for my soda, since it was an extra item.  Mind you, I still didn't get my shake, but the manager who was making the shakes was VERY concentrated on making shakes.  I mean 5 minutes to make per shake concentrating.  That's all he did was make shakes, rather slooowly.  I saw maybe 6 made in a 40 minute window.  

A few minutes later, my food arrived.  I reminded the waitress I ordered a chocolate shake, to which she said \"ok\", and walked away.  She scooted to her manager, and said \"problem solved, he wants a chocolate shake\", to which the manager replied \"too bad\".  I was really hoping he had a dry, sarcastic personality like me.

So on to the food.  The burger was delicious.  It had a little too much mayo, but I guess that's why they wrap it in paper.  The bun was rather large and a little cold, like it just came out of the fridge, but it was good.  The pickles were thick, the burger had a few crispy, overcooked spots, but flavorful.   For some reason I expected a tiny patty, but it was a good size.  It was worth buying.  The fries on the other hand, cold.  I like salt on my fries, so nothing irks me more than getting cold, unsalted fries.  Yuck.

After eating extra leisurely, in hopes of eventually getting my milkshake, it never came.  I waited about 10 minutes after I ate, and got my check, but no shake.  At least I didn't have to argue about the bill, since I was charged only $3.99 for the deal of the day.  I gave the waitress a $20. bill and got back $5. and change.  What???  After I walked over to my waitress, and explained I only got $5, she apologized and gave me back $10.  As this occurred, the disgruntled manager making milkshakes gave a dirty glare and snicker to the waitress and I.  I got the hell out of there as quick as I could.

Would I return?  No.  I may be willing to pay $2.99 for a burger a la carte, if they offered it.  Instead, you have to order a burger and all-you-can eat fries for $5.99.  I asked if someone can get the burger alone to go or to eat in, and was told no.  A soda cost $2.50, and a shake $4.29, definitely not worth the price.  Everything was slow motion, like my time machine back to the 1950's broke and I was stuck in slow motion.  It took almost an hour to get a burger and fries.  I'm sure it would have been an hour and a half if I ever got the milkshake.  The service was horrible, but when you look at the manager it's no wonder.  These poor miserable kids are a slave to the 1950's with a manager who is rude and disrespectful not only to the staff, but also to the customers.  I would also have a hard time enjoying my job and going to work under those conditions.  I know these restaurants are franchised, so hopefully the manager was not the owner.  Either way, good luck trying to stay in business with him schlepping around."}
{"text":"Anne did a great job we had never been there before, we had the Houston very good burger.  Great Music as well.  Thanks again Anne"}
{"text":"This Johnny rockets has an intriguing intro as an old time fashion place. As I got to see the interior, it brought me back to civil times. Racism and misfortune infest the restaurants as I will never come back here again. The coffee tastes like boiling water thrown into a river and shit out by a frog. The only positive about this place is the jukebox. Now that thing is litty. If you want a quit eat, I still don't recommend this place. That's all and please notice these thing the next time you come here, it gives me the chills. 1 star."}
{"text":"I love Johnny Rockets. I am Vegan and was very excited to go and get the Streamline (Boca burger with all the toppings and they sautée the onions. )"}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars, I would. They were extremely short staffed, and the food was terrible. There was a broom and dust pan sitting out by our table and it was dead silent/ no music or ambiance in the restaurant. 

My sons grill cheese was hard as a rock and I had to send it back as he couldn't even bite into it. There was a frozen fry in our chili cheese fries and they never brought our second order of fries. Also, the restaurant was so cold I contemplated leaving before our food was finished. 

My sons meal came with a drink and I upgraded to a shake, which she charged me full price for since I sent back his food. I ended up just paying it as I just wanted to leave. DO NOT EAT HERE."}
{"text":"It was so hot in there and so loud.
Took 20 minutes to get water
We order and it took over 30 minutes to get our food!
I got a chicken sandwich that ended up being removed from the bill due to hard bread and the piece of chicken being 1/2 the size of the bread.
They sang Happy Birthday to someone and the guy yelled very loud like way louder than necessary and startled a baby and made him cry and then said oh sorry but kept the same pitch and started singing even louder and shaking a tambourine and  got really really loud at the and to witch the baby started screaming louder along with the other two babies in the restaurant.
Great now there are THREE screaming babies it HOT and the food sucks and I'm out of water again
The bill comes $45! are you freaking kidding me? two other people got a hamburger and fries and I got a chicken sandwich and salad and we all got drinks. I said there is no way the food was worth this amount the quality was terrible it took forever. The manager comes over and says is everything okay?
Um no that's why you are standing here right? (maybe rude, sorry but I was so irritated)
My chicken sandwich was taken off but it was still almost $40 so NOT worth it t all.
Bummer I used to love the experience of Johnny Rockets!"}
{"text":"Don't order from Gissell. She completely ignored my son's order. When I saw the total couldn't be what we owed, I asked her to read back what we ordered, she only had my portion, not my son's. Mediocre food and cruddy service."}
{"text":"We went there on Nov. 05 with the intention of getting a quick bite and it was far from quick. Our waiter took the order but never returned with our drinks nor food. Another employee came by and had to make our drinks as our food came before our drinks did. In fact, our waiter never did deliver anything to us. When we tried to get his attention he acted as if we were invisible. It was later found he was the supervisor for everyone! WOW~Unbelievable. In any case, the food was alright and the service terrible. However, if it was not for Jesenia G. running around taking orders, making drinks, being a cook, running the cash register, and checking on everyone I don't think we would have ever made our next appointment. Thank you Jesenia for the great work!!"}
{"text":"I'm not the type of person that writes bad review I have patience with my order and I'm really friendly and I understand people get frustrated with their work because it's busy but this night it wasn't busy at all when I went there we had order some appetizers and my husband ordered Burger with some grilled onions after 30 minutes I had passed by we only got her drinks and then another 25 minutes have passed when the lady only brought our appetizers and she said that our burgers almost done that was a lie because we waited for another an hour and a half and we ask to see if we can get our Burger because we were done with their appetizers she apologized and she said that they still didn't do it but there were about to do it in 5 minutes another 45 minutes had passed and we still didn't get our Burger we asked and she said that she apologized again because they didn't even get started doing them because they're busy we said right on the bar scene everybody getting in their burgers their shakes and their fries done wheesung that for couples coming in and out and we were there before they were after another 10 minutes past we told her we didn't want neuberger say more she said she was sorry but that the patties were frozen she had lied because we seen hamburgers coming out from there so she forgot to do our order she said she can give us her check she was going to take the burgers out and that for the weight she was going to give us some free shakes we didn't care about the shakes we just wanted our food that was the worst experience I've ever had I like Johnny Rockets a lot but it was the last time that I would go to that location and it's 3 minutes away from my house I'd rather go somewhere else"}
{"text":"I went here to eat inside of the flamingo. I ordered a double burger and an order of fries.  The fries are thick cut and were pretty good.  The burger is cooked fresh to order and was almost the size of my head !!  It was fresh, hot & juicy.  I liked it and I wish we had a JR's around us here in New Hampshire."}
{"text":"ambiance - food court
service - 10 minute wait just to order and another 20 min till you get your order
food - mediocre at best for taste, presentation and quality
price - over priced

spent $40+ for 1 adult and 2 children for a light snack and we barely ate half of our food because it wasn't even appetizing. i'm no food critic but this joint failed all categories in my book."}
{"text":"We went here on Memorial weekend for lunch and it was pretty empty. (that should have said enough). The staff is young and increadibly inexperienced, spoke very broken english and made us feel like we were a burden. I am usually as cool as a cucumber when it comes to restaurants and staff but something was really off at this location. If there was a manager it did not show. They were out of root beer and orange crush so I just stuck with water. 4 out of the 6 glasses were filthy, and after asking if we could get new ones we were immed. treated like we thought we were royalty. A few minutes later I get a look directly from the cook. Thats when I asked the fam if they would rather walk across the street to Hard Rock. Needless to say maybe the staff at this location should have lunch at the HR cafe and see how things should be. I really try to not leave negative reviews but this Johnny no go deserves two."}
{"text":"You would think for the price they could get the order correct. Really? $2 for a piece of cheese added to a burger that was already overpriced. You have lots of other choices in the immediate area. Choose something else. And from now on I will consult Yelp before before ordering. Quality is nothing special."}
{"text":"This place is fun. Good burgers and shakes. Good for just a fast bite. Chase out!"}
{"text":"Burger was pretty good, but the attitudes at this place makes it a one. Work on customer service, especially when the cashier is the one who takes the order wrong."}
{"text":"I would have gladly given this a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the horrible costumer service I received.
Food was ok. 
I was there around 12am I order an original with some onion rings. I got my order taken by The cashier I think her name was Claire or someone like that.. Let me start of by saying So rude!!!!! 
She kept rolling her eyes at me after I decided to change my order cause I couldn't decide what I wanted (it's my first time in JR) she kept ignoring me cause she was too busy talking to other employees and to top it off she got my order wrong.... I'm never coming back to this location!"}
{"text":"When I go to Johnny Rockets for a burger these guys always exceed my expectations, they go above and beyond to give me the perfect customer experience. I consider the people that work here like friends. You guys deserve five stars! great job, keep up the good work! Shout out to Denice, José, and Miguel!!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever. One server and 2 cooks for a restaurant full of people. My family was there before anyone else. Waited 15 min before we got our waters and diet coke. After an hour of waiting for 2 hotdogs and 2 burgers, we decided to leave after the server couldn't tell us how much longer the wait would be. After we let her know we couldn't wait anymore, she rudely said \"so you want me to ring you up for the coke then?! \" I said \"ummmm NO I DON'T want you to ring me up for the coke!  I think after 1+hrs of waiting,  the least you could do is comp a coke! \" she said \"FINE GO!\" Stay classy Johnny  Rocket's, stay classy."}
{"text":"I'm sooo surprised to read all this negative comments and star rating of this place.  A couple of my friends and I were around the area and wanted to grab a quick bite before we went to explore hard rock!
Our first impressions when we walked in was that the place was really  clean, they had jukeboxes and it was playing 50's music.
I ordered their regular hamburger as well as an Oreo shake, which was recommended by our server.
Our food arrived in about five minutes and wow, this is not your average hamburger!!!!!
It was delicious! The shake was thick and well worth the money.
 I only wished the hamburgers would come with fries as they were all separate but considering how yummy everything tasted it doesn't matter!
 The manager was in fact the person who served our food, she was very nice and had a Russian accent.
 She was nice enough to even split our checks 3 ways after we got the receipt and told her we forgot to mention separate receipts.
If I am ever around the area I would def come back."}
{"text":"Overrated and over priced, the wait in line was awful they had only one cashier and apparently this must have been her first day at the job. I even joked with the girl in front of me that we should order a pizza while waiting our turn in line then I ordered mine to go $22.54 for a burger, onion rings and a shake then after waiting and waiting the buzzer flasher they gave me went off I went to the counter to get it and it wasn't to go, I joked to the woman next to me and she said they left off half her order. I think the CEO better go undercover boss again!"}
{"text":"Typically, you will see 8-10 empty tables and an empty counter. Don't let this fool you, because you will still be asked to wait 15-20 minutes. The management explains that the kitchen is backed up, therefore guests are asked to wait outside the restaurant in the mall. When I suggested that perhaps they should add extra staff to the kitchen, she said it was too difficult because \"nobody wants to work here!\" This is the only place in the mall that will force you to wait outside their restaurant. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"the service was lousy. i have had better service before at the one at arrowhead mall. my daughter spilled her drink and they gave her an apron to clean herself? they left the soda on the floor so we had to step on it the whole time. what?"}
{"text":"Small portions and overpriced. Go to rubio's because you can get much more food and better quality for a little more money even though all restaurants in the court are overpriced."}
{"text":"This is a brand new location and concept!! It is the only express Johnny Rockets of the nation!!! It has been open for only a month and half. I thank you all for your comments and we will continue to grow as we continue!!"}
{"text":"I sometimes switch up my burger selection of in n out by going to Johnny Rockets. The nostalgia of the 50's dinner has always been a cool atmosphere for burgers and shakes. I typically get the bacon cheese burger which comes out always cooked to temperature. Occasionally the fries & onion rings are just average due to the abundance of grease & over cooked but the shakes make up for it. Not three star more like three and a half."}
{"text":"Not a great experience, but foo was good. A very slow Wednesday night, took about an hour to get food. Not once before, during, or after our meal did the waitress stop by to check on us. I finally stopped her as she was dropping food at another table and asked for drinks when she brought the check. We were all very thirsty after eating cheeseburgers. Twenty minutes later she brought the check, no drinks. We were all disappointed and the manager waved goodbye, even though the whole group was obviously unhappy about our experience. I later saw the waitress walking and she gave me a nasty look, even though I left her a 10% tip, which she did not earn."}
{"text":"I had one of the worst experiences of my vegetarian life here. I had been to Johnny Rocket's before and gotten the vegan option so I knew I would be ok going here. I was out with my meat eating sister and my pescatarian husband so I figured this place would be the best for all three of us to get what we want. 

We get in and I ordered a burger that wasn't the Streamliner (1st mistake), and just ordered it with the BOCA burger. The waitress takes our order, my husband also ordered his with a BOCA. 

About 20 minutes later the food comes out. The patty looks right. I was a little apprehensive and I should have gone with my gut feeling on not eating here this day, but I ignored it. It had been awhile since I had eaten a BOCA patty (over a year), so I THOUGHT it looked right. (2nd mistake)

I start eating it and about half way through it the bill hits our table. It was crowded in there so the waitress must have been trying to get us out of there. So I look at the bill and notice both my husband and my burgers say Turkey substitution. I immediately start to freak out. We call the waitress over and explain to her that we ordered BOCA, why does it say Turkey? She then tells us that it is BOCA it just says turkey. I say, no that doesn't sound right. So she goes to talk to her manager I guess because we never saw her again. The manager comes over to our table and apologizes profusely for what happened. I'm upset because how the hell do you confuse BOCA and Turkey? I mean, really. I know some people might think how did I not know the difference. And I thought that to myself as well, but the truth is it slipped by me even though it shouldn't have. And it hurts me every time I think about it. I will never come to this Johnny Rockets again, if any of them ever again because of this experience. 

All I can say is, if you are vegan or vegetarian, and you go to any of the Johnny Rockets, make sure that your waitress/waiter knows that a BOCA burger isn't meat. Stress that to them. Because obviously they aren't trained to know what the difference is."}
{"text":"Customer service is terrible!  What's worst is the root beer float.  She only give 1/4 of root beer into the cup. I mean what is wrong with her?  I had to ask for more and she gets pissed off when it's their fault!
She's the Cook and the Cashier, and he has painted long blue nails and when I give her coins, she gets pissed off at it too!  Now what restaurant allows their Cooks and food server to have painted long nails?"}
{"text":"Thank you Upper Management for addressing my issues, like immediately!! Speaks highly of the corporation, as well as  their caring for Military personnel/families as well!!!! We love JR, especially the banana milkshakes and sweet potato fries! We'll definitely be back for more!!"}
{"text":"After a long day of shopping. Me and my wife decided since we were starving and this was the first place we saw we would go ahead and just eat here get it over with.

We both had a squealer burger with fries and some milkshake. The food was decent but maybe one of the most expensive hamburger I have ever eaten at 14.99. 

I would definitely not go out of my way to eat here unless it happen to be the only place around to eat."}
{"text":"The food is great every time I go there.  Edgar is always our server and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"I wish there was 1/2 a star,  we chose to sit at the full service bar with a  party of  4 on   02/26/15 at a non peak time with 6 other people in the restaurant. We all ordered  4 incredibly dry tasteless burgers.  Not only do you pay an $8.00 base price just for the burger you pay a $1.00 up charge for each add on. So basically god forbid you prefer flavor or moisture on your sandwich on that overcooked slab of meat. We have been to many J.R's  and not only do they have an expansive menu the food has never been anything but delicious. We even went to one in cancun Mexico in September that had a 3-4 page menu and the food was PHENOMENAL ... The man next to me ordered the chicken tenders and his girlfriend ordered the burger she ate 1/2 and he ate 1/2 of 1 strip and  refused to eat them. I heard him tell the server that they were over cooked and tasted like the oil was burnt, but yet she didn't take them back nor did she offer him anything in place of it. I thought that was in poor service but yet she let him pay for it on his bill. I heard his girlfriend make a complaint .  Management needs to look at what's going on in this store and maybe eat this food when we were waiting for our check I saw 2 employees bringing back to-go dinners from other other places in the food court..... Hmmmm wonder why?"}
{"text":"Went in on Sunday after 5 and waited a while. It wasn't busy but this tourist location needs TWO servers! Only one server doing 4 tables & the counter. What happened to quality customer service with a full staff. Hey Johnny! Do your homework! Backup staff & Location knowledge equals succsess!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience! We got there and saw the sign that said \"wait to be seated\" after 5 min or more  (it wasn't even busy) finally one of the staff member who had been waking by us regularly told us we could go in and grab a seat (probably could had told us first time she walked by).   Took 10 more min for someone to swing by and leave menus.  Also, place was dirty, didn't seemed they cleaned the seating areas well after each customer.  Finally what felt like 20 min later a server came by and attempted to take our order (she seemed to be under the influence of something) had trouble understanding our simple order which was a grilled cheese sandwich, chicken fingers & a milkshake.   She asked multiple times if I wanted my grilled cheese toasted?  Finally we decided the service was unacceptable and after more observations of poor hygiene around the place we decided to leave.  Our server was just a crossed the room taking a new order and hadn't put our order in yet when my husband went to tell her we decided to head out.  She said she had to bring us bill for our drinks (which was water) and cancel our order (she still hadn't taken it to kitchen) she seemed very confused once again.    My husband politely reminded her we only had water & we left."}
{"text":"8pm. A lot of parking, not much room to park a truck- parking spaces too narrow. Got there, we seated ourselves. They were busy, loud 50's music. Waited about 5 mins no one came to our table so we has to wave a server over for our menus. She came back about 2 mins, got our orders. Order the meals 1 reg burger w/fries, 2 dd burgers w/fries, coke, strwbrry shake n water. It was around 40.00. We got our meals in about 25 mins. Server came back twice to check on us after we got our meals. Nothing spectacular. But the shake was awesome, but it was like 4 or 5 bucks. We ordered from the meal deal price 6.00-8.00. Soda was about 3.00. I wouldn't take a crew of people there, seating is limited n little over priced for just hamburgers, fries n soda."}
{"text":"We thought it would be exciting, from all the hype of Johnny Rockets being inside our favorite amusement park. We thought wrong.
Extremely long wait to sit down even though it had many empty tables. We hardly had any service of any kind, for quite a while. Drinks  in about 45 minutes (which was water for a few of us). Orders wrong IF you got it at all! Frozen foot longs. 
Burgers-great taste. Which is why I give 1 star! 
Bills all confused.  Server and manager discussed in length what to do. Comped our bill since it was such a mess, only to try to make the people with us pay for it!

 Don't waste your time people! Stick with Kennywood classics, like Potato Patch!"}
{"text":"Don't. Do. It. We came here to grab dinner before a movie thinking an Express Johnny Rockets? How perfect. Wrong.  It took 40 minutes for us to get our order. 2 separate parties gave up waiting and asked for a refund.  A party next to us got the wrong order.  When we finally did get our food, the burgers were fine but the fries tasted like we were pouring salt in our mouths.  I would not be surprised if this place shuts down soon."}
{"text":"Today I decided to take my family to Johnny Rockets and all I have to say is that everything was delicious and the service was good as usual. It is always great choice to stop and grab a bite to eat when I'm in Vegas. I'm glad we decided to eat there before coming back home."}
{"text":"Our waitress was nice. But everything else wasn't. Food took forever to come out. Ask for  water in a kids cup, took them 15min or so. It was Thursday nooning, hardly anyone there.. I like Johnny rockets but not coming back to this one :("}
{"text":"overcharged me on the bill 
the food however, was pretty good but there are better places with just as good of food elsewhere in Vegas.  No wonder the place is always empty."}
{"text":"I must have made someone mad. The rest of my table got all of their food on time. Besides the general lack of service and forks and napkins, they were happy. I on the other hand received my shake later than everyone else, after sitting for around 10-15 ninutes waiting to be served.

Then I made the mistake of ordering chicken. The rest of my table ordered burgers. The waiter told me it would take longer and I knew that. I'm no stranger to ordering chicken, it does take longer to cook. According to someone at my table it sat for a bit before we got the waiters attention and he delivered it to me. My table ate their food before I got mine. Fortunately it wasn't cold! 

The service was below average. The food was good for the most part but the cheese fries were not very good. The strawberry oreo shake saved this visit from 1 star"}
{"text":"We were told there is a forty minute wait....looked inside  and the place was close to empty....took off like a rocket!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best experiences I have ever had at a restaurant. Free food for my daughter and ketchup smiley faces for everyone. The food was great and the server commendable. Definitely recommending this spot to others. I had a bad experience at the west gate location but I'm really glad we gave the arrowhead location a chance. If you see a male server with big curly hair he's the one you want."}
{"text":"Perfect drunk food. Beware, though the site claims this is a 24 hour operation, they turn away customers at 5am and reopen for breakfast at 6am. My friends and I barely made the cut. Be warned, like other Vegas restaurants in hotels, there is no closed sign and they do not turn off their signs to let you know they are not open. I recommend the chili on your fries! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Malissa the manager would rather have a 2min + conversation about counting her daily calories then acknowledge a customer or even properly cash out a guest."}
{"text":"The service is bad and I order the mushroom hamburger, and it only came with three slides of mushrooms. Which cost me $13.00 just for that hamburger."}
{"text":"Johnny Rocket's  at The Fashion show is not worth your time and money.  We had been to other Johnny Rocket's, so we were familiar with the brand.  Our server was very nice, and the food was fine, probably  3.5 stars for the food.  I'm not sure about pricing at all Johnny Rocket's since I hadn't been to one recently, but we had one Philly cheese steak with a small amount of fries, one shake, a root beer float, and two cokes ---- the price before tip was $38!  Drinks at all restaurants are over priced, but not like this.   I would have walked out when I saw the prices, but I didn't know if my son's friend would feel embarrassed.   Before leaving the shopping center, I checked  the menus of other restaurants, and the prices were not out of line, so I don't think the pricing was due to high rent.   On past visits to other Johnny Rocket's we were able to select the music at the jukebox, but you can't at this one.  The bottom line....there are better options."}
{"text":"Great family venue. Fun and helpful staff.  For the past two years, my daughter has wanted to celebrate her birthday with a movie and Johnny Rockets.  The staff is fun and friendly and they were very good with the kids getting them to dance and enjoy the bday celebration. They also took into consideration our crunch for time and served us swiftly and efficiently. Thanks for being so helpful."}
{"text":"There food was ok prices are way to high won't be back staff look Like they didn't want to be there."}
{"text":"The food was fun.  The entertainment was fun as well.  The whole vibe of the restaurant was, well fun.  HOWEVER...the waitress was amazing.  She was kind, cheerful, helpful and just a darling of a person.  My granddaughter and I had a great night.  So, hat's off to a, gotta say it, \"fun\" place and thank you, Kayla for making my February 13 evening dinner date so enjoyable."}
{"text":"I have to say the food was pretty good. Burgers were fresh, hot, juicy, and gooey cheese! I swapped out my fries for tots ($1 more) and it was worth it. Staff was friendly and looked like they where happy to help, unlike the neighboring competitors. Our wait was maybe 10 minutes, so not bad. Strawberry milkshake was awesome, perfect way to end a meal at Jonny Rockets. Side note, no pics unfortunately LOL. I took one bite and didn't stop until my food was gone..forgetting to share with you guys. Sorry."}
{"text":"Tried to find a way to rate thwm without a star but that want an option. Horrible service. The cashier girl read back to me out loud exactly what we ordered. Loaded fries, an original burger combo and kids chicken tenders.
We got the tenders (not bad so no conplaints there) Old dry hot fries as if they'd been cooked yesterday and put under a heat lamp today.  No loaded fries at all (she said it out loud but failed to put it on the ticket so still not the cooks fault). Then my burger... i asked for no cheese. I got No Bun instead. I went back and asked for them the please make it with a bun so they brought me a buttered bun. I asked again and the clerk said \"well it looks like you've been fingering your burger\" (her exact words). I said \"well yeah. I was looking for the bun. Can you please make me a complete burger?\" But then i could see the cooks disgruntled grimace as he stared at me. I asked for a refund instead. The manager came out and offered me cash instead of crediting my visa. The manager was actually very friendly and helpful. Sorry if i upset the cook but that Dolt at the register is failing you something awful. To the cook \"I never got to taste your burger so i won't comment there but had it been right the first time i would have eaten. Oh btw i asked for diet coke and it was root beer. Seriouslt WTF!"}
{"text":"Place is horrible stood respectfully abiding by the sign that says please wait to be seated, while waiting people who work there walked around slowly not acknowledging us waiting. I saw about 10 people there working but no body bothered to talk to us"}
{"text":"If you're not afraid of greasy food, this old style diner is a real treat.  They play real oldies music too, adding to the diner experience.  Good selection of burgers and shakes."}
{"text":"I debated about whether to write this review at all, as I realize that if you can't say something nice don't say it at all, however this is a platform for the good and the bad. And well here, it is just bad. I was so sad I had to come here in the first  place as it was not my choice. I was going to get the chicken salad that they show on their online menu, however salad was not offered. So then there was no chicken sandwiches on the menu, which again is on the online menu. The cashier (possible manager?) said he would substitute chicken in for any of the hamburgers. So I bought the original with chicken instead of beef. Just wasn't in a beef mood. The cost was $8.95 + tax for a sad little grilled chicken sandwich with a underwhelming portion of cold fries. 

I would normally ask for hot fries but service was so horrible and I being on my lunch hour knew it would take an inordinate amount of time for me to get any fries that were hot. So I ate the small portion of cold fries. As to the sandwich again, just bad, the grilled chicken was okay, not fresh, but whatever... but my bun was really dry and fell apart. I didn't even take a picture to share because I was just so disgusted. 

Sodas are also $3, I just got water. I asked for ranch dressing for the fries, they didn't charge me but took forever to get it. The cook put the ranch in the window and the server (using that term loosely) just walked away - I was three feet away from my ranch separated by a counter and I had to wait for the snail pace server to come back to that side of the restaurant. There is a pizza place joined with the Johnny Rocket's and the employees apparently work both sides, so if people are on the other side you are in for a really long wait. 

So sad that $9 and lunch was wasted here."}
{"text":"My wife has been talking about this place for a while how she loved the food but hadn't been in years. Well we went in tonight and it was my first time and definitely my last. The food was incredibly disappointing in all aspects. Let's just say the only thing I enjoyed was my coke which I had to get after the iced tea that tastes like dish water. My young daughter wouldn't even eat the grilled cheese and she eats EVERYTHING. It's obvious that the cooks do not care at all about the quality of food they serve and if this problem isn't fixed I will be surprised if they even stay open much longer. Sorry about the long rant but I haven't been disappointed in a restaurant like this in a long time."}
{"text":"After realizing our usual pub was full, we decided to walk down Dundas and figured we hadn't been to this place in a while.

Ordered 2 hamburgers with fries and 2 milkshakes.
They were alright, nothing to write home about...usual pub/fast food fare.

Total?
47 dollars

47 dollars for a server with 3 inches of makeup and fast food.

I think I remember why I don't come here"}
{"text":"Went to this Johnny Rockets location today after a haircut and although the service was great, I was not impressed with anything especially the burger and fries combo.  

I came in on a Friday around 1pm. It was not busy at all and I took a seat at the counter. The waiter was right there and ready to take my drink order which was great. I ordered the diet coke with a shot of cherry and took a look at the menu. By the time he got back I was ready to order. Now being in the mood for fries I debated about getting a plate of fries on the side and taking the salad option with my burger, but I thought that there would be enough fries to satisfy me so I just went with The Original, no mayo, and fries. 

Took them about 10 minutes to get the order which wasn't bad, but the order was sitting on the pass for a few minutes because the waiter was busy with other tables. I don't understand why the chef or another waiter could not hand me my order since I was sitting 4 feet from it, but whatever. So I get my order and the side of fries is barely a side at all. There were 15 fries on the plate, I know I counted them, and my burger. The burger was alright, nothing special, same with the low quantity of fries. My minor complaint would be that the food was not piping hot. It was by no means cold, but I could definitely feel the extra few minutes on the pass dinged the warmth of the burger. 

My total bill came to $8.50, which wasn't bad at all, but the quality could've been better. 

I would come here again, but would order the plate of fries with my burger instead of getting them on the side."}
{"text":"OK went here with my daughter . Was asked how many in my party and told the girl 2 . She proceeded to say the wait would be at least 30 min for a table. Looking around I could see at least 15 empty tables. I asked why and all she could say was that is what they are telling everyone. Needless to say we went elsewhere in the park to eat."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery. I work in the mall and was unable to leave so they only had to deliver a few doors down. The food was limp and old. Fries were cold and the \"chocolate\" shake was more like very light chocolate milk. Won't be ordering from them again. However, the gentleman who delivered the food was extremely nice and is the only reason for the star."}
{"text":"Bad service. Took 6 or 7 min just to be acknowledged and seated. Then sat there for another 10 min no drink order or acknowledgement from the waitress. Bad outlook of what our ordering and waiting for food woukd be. Left without ordering."}
{"text":"I had the groupon for $6 for $12 and just thought to go for dinner with my boyfriend one night. We got to the counter and the guy at the counter walked away before taking our order! 5 minutes later another guy walked up and asked if anybody had taken out order. We said no, and explained that we would be using a groupon. He took our order and did everything needed for the groupon. $11 (plus the cost of the groupon) for two burgers and fries, but no drinks, as a poor college student is ALOT of money. 

It took 20 minutes for the guy to give our order to the wrong people, and another 5 minutes for him to realize his mistake. At this point the other people had our burgers at their table and already got condiments on their plates! He took that order back and served it to me and my boyfriend! THAT'S ILLEGAL! I had watched the people that had our food and they hadn't touched the burgers yet and I didn't want to wait another half hour for a burger so I was going to eat it anyways because I was already sick of this place.

I opened the burger wrapper and there was a plastic bread bag fastener ON THE BURGER!! I took it up to the supervisor and he laughed and pointed at the cook and said \"I'll go kill him\" laughed more and walked away! I stayed there for a few more minutes to see if he would give me another burger or my money back, but he just ignored me. So we left. This isn't the only location that I have had crappy service."}
{"text":"This place is a rip off! $39.00 for two meals? That's crazy even for vegas prices.  We only ate here because of undercover boss and we don't have them in Nebraska. I can see why this place sucks. Slow service and crazy prices! I wish I was in Nebraska again with some customer service and decent prices."}
{"text":"1. Slow service 2. Wrong orders 3. Lagged long enough to where half the people finished their food and left before the other half got theirs . 4. Bad experience in general 5. And no service with a smile."}
{"text":"Sat in a booth by the window. Had food and trash on the metal stand in the booth, fingerprints all over the window, and under the table jukebox was salt, and the jukebox was filthy. Maybe they need this former Marine to run this place and give it a thorough military cleaning. Calling their headquarters to let them know this!!"}
{"text":"I love this place takes ya back to the good old days when waitstaff looked like waitstaff .love taking my 5 year old son here. Its hes favorite place. And he has a crush on one of the girls."}
{"text":"It was my family and I first time here and let me tell you it was the worse service ever!!!!!!!!!!!!! Never again will we walk into this restaurant again !!! Service was bad from beginning to end even the manager scott didn't do his job. after his employees screwed up our order .............. LIKE I SAID NEVER AGAIN AND I HOPE ANYONE THAT GOES IN THE NEAR FUTURE DOESNT HAVE THE EXPERIENCE ME AND MY FAMILY HAD ."}
{"text":"After looking at all the options at this particular food court we decided on Johnny Rockets. While looking at the menu Thomas offered us a seat at the bar if we would like to dine in and said it would be \"his pleasure\" to serve us. We decided to go ahead and stay to eat there rather than the community seating for all establishments in the food court. Immediately, Thomas was there handing us menus and expressing his gratitude for us choosing to sit there with him. Throughout the entire meal Thomas was outstanding in his service to us and every other patron he served while we were there. The food was good for a fast food restaurant on the strip but Thomas made the meal ridiculously enjoyable.... It's nice to sit down and be treated like your decision to dine there is appreciated. Thomas was well deserving of the tip..... Sit with him and you will not be disappointed at all!!!!"}
{"text":"Everything was okay. Had the spicy Houston burger. Was decent. Fries weren't bad either. Took a while for the food but no real complaints."}
{"text":"I have not been in JR in a long time. So I decided to go with my husband. The menus were changed and sadly so does the service. Took a long time to give us the menu she asked for our drinks. By this time of day they're were only other 3 families. Then same waitress came and asked for our drinks again. We said-\"We ordered them\" -oh yeah! What was it again?! She asked. Then she brought food that belonged to the next table. As for the taste of the my grilled chicken breast sandwich felt soooo buttery that I was left with that feeling in my mouth. My husband would eat anything but this time he left his original burger half way. He said for such a pricey burger he expected more."}
{"text":"Horrible! 10 employees working; just standing around not doing anything. Not too many guest in the restaurant and yet barely any tables were cleaned off despite the employees clearly standing around doing nothing. Then when our food was delivered to our table, the girl just dropped the bag on the table and walked away. She was very miserable looking walking around with a scowl on her face. I will not ever spend my money here again. This place needs some oversight to ensure the employees that are being paid to work are actually working."}
{"text":"This place sucks!!!!!  How do you have a limited menu that only serves hamburgers with thousand island dressing type sauce?  They don't even have the classic #12!!!!  I have to say that this is the worst experience I have ever had at Johnny rockets,  and will not come back to this location!!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a quick shake break here after the tour through the Shark Reef and it was satisfying."}
{"text":"Upon walking in with my family we come a across a sign that states \"wait to be seated\", while waiting we see the employees gathered around having a grand time not taking the time to greet nor seat us. A huge turn off for me, after seating ourselves we see the same issue happening as other patrons wait. Extremely rude, and I will never be back."}
{"text":"My friend and I had excellent service from the entire crew today!  Travis and his manager were terrific!  Thank you for singing Happy Birthday too :)"}
{"text":"Love that I could use a groupon on everything and they give you a coupon when you get your order! I'll be back for my free shake!!!.... Yes it's high prices but it's Vegas baby!...recommend the smoke house burger"}
{"text":"The Black Forest Malt is so good it's ridiculous!"}
{"text":"My experience with this Johnny Rockets has been \"meh.\" there is usually ample seating, so getting a table never takes long. I come here a lot for several reasons unrelated to the quality of this establishment and despite coming at all sorts of different times, my experiences are consistently poor. It takes long time to get our food (never ordering anything special) often longer than 30 minutes. The quality of the food is ok (maybe 3 stars) and the waiters are also average (3 stars). But often the wait staff is inattentive to drink refills and other key things (like order taking or checking in). So I'm dropping them down to 2 stars. Also, as a side note, when I have onion rings substituted for fries (at an additional charge) they give me a pitifully small number of onion rings--like 5 medium sized ones."}
{"text":"i went to the one in paradise & harmon. Servers are really inexperienced and stupid. Me & my sister went there and we asked if they can split the check and they said yes, of course. they charged my sister correctly but as for me, they charged me twice. They didnt even have the guts to let me know about their mistake. Not until i got home & checked my bank statement and said Johnny Rockets there twice! 
I hate it when people mess with my money, so Im never coming back to this place. 

But as for the food, its ok, a bit messy tho. Servers are completely not trained well. 
And as we were leaving, nobody even said thank you, goodbye or anything. Shouldnt have given them a tip. This place is a joke."}
{"text":"This is a terrible excuse for a Johnny Rocket's. This example has more in common with Burger King than it does with other Johnny Rocket's. Expect soggy fries, a tasteless burger, and ridiculous prices. I do not know how this franchise meets Johnny Rocket's corporate standards."}
{"text":"Burger was pretty good considering they have decent amount of toppings in it.  Just needed extra ketchup and the burger was a winner compared to the vicinities choices.  I'd try them again any day!"}
{"text":"Service here is abysmal. Took 5 minutes to get someone to take our drink orders and another 10 for them to come out. Staff ignores the other customers as well unless actively bringing them their food. Watched a woman try 3 times unsuccessfully to get a refill and the man sitting behind me was missing half his meal for close to 20 minutes. Food is as expected but I can't say I'll be back to this location again any time soon."}
{"text":"When I entered the doors, I thought this place was pretty cool, but I left unsatisfied. I order fries and they were cold and soggy-ish. The waitress was unorganized and the service in general horrible!

There was a elder man that entered the resturant waiting to be seated. The waitresses clearly saw him standing there waiting, yet they chose to ignore him. After a while, when our waitress stopped by at our table to give us our refill drink, I told her that the man was standing there for quite sometime waiting to be seated. The waitress was like, \"oh...I'll get to that\", walked away to the kitchen! I couldn't believe it! After some more time past, finally another waitress approached him and told him he could just seat himself at one of the booths. 

Horrible service, horrible food, horrible everything.

Will DEFINITELY not return....ever."}
{"text":"The meat patty was excellent. Well done to our liking. Tomatoes & lettuce was crisp. The bun was fresh. French Fries & Sweet Potatoe Fries was tasty."}
{"text":"$3.89 for a pop and no refills is ridiculous.  The food is extremely overpriced for what you get.  My opinion, don't waste your time or money here."}
{"text":"After staying at HRH multiple times and seeing this place across the street, I decided to get lunch here instead of eating in the hotel.  It was refreshing to get out and walk here.  When we got there, we seated ourselves and our server came over and made us feel welcome and at home, though we were hundreds of miles away from home.  I enjoyed being in the 1950's diner vibe because those were the better days of food service compared to the more corporate feel you get today.

So, when it came time to placing our order, my friend and I each got Rocket Doubles and a side of onion rings to share and I got a bowl of chili for myself.  At first, we thought that we didn't order enough food and then it showed up and we began eating it.  Toward the end of the meal, we realized that it was definitely a lot of food and we were really hungry when we showed up.  We barely finished our burgers and then the last of the onion rings which then left us bursting at the seams.

Overall, the food was really good and something different from the offerings at HRH.  I think our total came out to $30 with tip so it wasn't that expensive compared to what you would get at most hotels.  Anyways, I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Price Gouging at it's best!! Sent food back 2x, total disconnect on fresh off the grill. $20 for a smoke house combo, for real?? The owner is so disconnected with running great operations, store was filthy. Its time to overhaul this location or get a restaurant that will appreciate their customers."}
{"text":"I stopped by here because I had fond memories from back when I was a youngin (like, 12 years ago).  I don't know if it's all Johnny Rockets, or just this one, but things had changed.  This is no longer a sit-down type restaurant.  You order at the counter, get a number, and they bring you your food.  That's fine, but not as nice.

They used to have little jukeboxes on each table, and you could feed nickels into them to play songs, but this location does not have those, which again, is a bummer.

Finally, the food is good, but nothing special: cooked properly, but more fast-foodish than I recall.

Overall I was disappointed, but only because I had set greater expectations than seemed to have been accurate.  The staff were friendly and helpful, the place was clean, and the food was good.  It just wasn't special."}
{"text":"We got a Groupon for this burger joint and and once  we went to pay they said they didn't take the Groupon unless it was printed out. We explained that it clearly said you show the app or print it out. They said they couldn't accept anything that wasn't printed out. The manager then came back and said now the 'Owner' said they would absolutely not accept it and that they weren't participating in the Groupon (they changed their story). 
The groupon clearly said the Silverton location. They had their location taken off the Groupon site but non the less the way they handled it was very poor. They lost a customer.
In this case it was just plain horrible management. They did a VERY poor job in handling this. We purchased a groupon in good faith, we went to the location that was specifically on the groupon, and the owner was a jerk about it as if we did something wrong."}

{"text":"We tried Johnny Rockets burger the first day in Vaegas... just on the strip inside Flamingo Casino, it was amazing fresh and juicy burger with sweet potatoes and onion rings
we have to visit it again last day before leaving Vegas. . The price is a bit high but nothing compared to the food at the strip"}
{"text":"I ordered my burger with extra mushroom. After 20 mins. Finally got my order. But inside only have 2 pieces tiny mushroom  and they charged me $16 for my burger. Bad experience and wasting my time to eat here. Not recommend it don't come!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed by everything. 
Yes this is fast food and it's unhealthy but the oil was literally dripping out of my Philly steak and cheese. My husband who loves everything greasy food wise could not even eat half of his single bacon and cheese. 
The place was not busy but the table, chairs, cutlery and glasses were not clean. The service, lackluster. Add to all this it was expensive. $60CAD for 3 burgers, fries plus soda. I've had better food for a third of the price at Tim Hortons. Based on this experience I won't be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place has been my kids favorite place on their birthdays. We go there every year and every time we have so much fun. However, this year on my son's birthday, it was a huge disappointment. The place was obviously short staffed that night. No one greeted us, no one even was busing the tables. Drinks and food were super slow. And the worst part was the waitress even forgot about my son's birthday. Even though she apologized and brought back an ice cream, she tried to get the manager to sing with her but the manager was too busy to talk to a guy. It made me feel like I caused trouble for them. It's not the experience we expected and I think we should find kids some other places to celebrate their birthdays from now on."}
{"text":"This is hands down the best hamburger resturaunt  ive ever been to. Great food (BETTER than in n out!!), AWESOME 50's theme atmosphere with dancers every 30 mins. LOVED it! The service was excellent! The food was fantastic! Five stars from me."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. The place was clean and the staff were very friendly. I am glad they opened in my area. I will definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place no stars. Because this place doesn't deserve any. 
We came to Johnny Rockets for my birthday dinner, we ordered and went to go sit down. As we were sitting there my step dad sat back in his chair, he wasn't tipping or doing anything out of the ordinary and next thing we know he's on the ground! The whole back of the chair snapped off! 
Then after he got up, he had black marks on his pants because the floors were so disgustingly gross. Then the manager came over after my mother had to go ask for him and he said the black marks on his pants were probably from the chair because the chairs tend to get dirty. IF YOU KNOW THE CHAIRS ARE DIRTY, WHY DONT YOU CLEAN THEM?! 
We waited almost a half hour for food and the food came out ice cold, the buns were almost stale, the milk shakes were undrinkable. 
Happy birthday to me."}
{"text":"Horrible experience! Food was undercooked, food delivery was unorganized,  we never got our shakes, by the time they realized it we where completely done with our food.  #NeverAgain (after I told the manager the burger was raw, she offered to make me a new sandwich, but told me I could keep the other one to take home ??? Why?)"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a quick bite. Good service.  Clean. A little wait but worth the price."}
{"text":"I'm not impressed. 

This is my first visit to ANY Johnny Rockets. I was terribly hungry and not picky.

When you are hungry and waiting for your meal, the LAST thing you want to see is the crew out in the table area dancing to Chubby Checker.

The burger was passable, but for the price, I expected better. The Chili fries were delicious and made for good gas later that night."}
{"text":"1st time trying out the food and the worker didn't say hello when we walked in or said ill be right with you. Walked by like nothing took about 15mins till he came and took our order but came in a bad mood, when i asked him a question answered back very rude. I then said no thank you i dont want anything and all he did was say \"fine\" and walked away like nothing. Hes name was willie in side az mills mall."}
{"text":"Went here with my family and the food was awful! Couldn't even finish our burgers. The French fries were the only thing that was edible. Not to mention we didn't have good service. Took 20 min to get our drink refills. I will never go to Johnny rockets again."}
{"text":"Took over 20 mins to get 2 burgers, and fries. The burgers were over cooked to the point the meat was crunchy. Employee \"Jared\" was too busy eating in the back room, throwing punches in the air, and then talking to another employee about wanting to get off early, rather than help customers. My Wife and I have eaten here in the past, and the experience was bad. This time, I told her that if I suggest going here again, to smack me."}
{"text":"I was Christmas shopping for my wife at Bass Pro (she likes ducks, so I figured that would be a good place to look).  This is my first time there, and only went because I was hungry and Johnny Rockets was in the casino.  

  I'm kind of surprised by all the low reviews this place has received.....the food was really good and the service was top-notch.  The overhead music was a little loud, but overall it was a good experience. 

  I've been to many other burger places in town, and this has so far had the best tasting burger yet.  In-n-out...will never go back for another of their botulism burgers, Steak n Shake....decent but overpriced, Five Guys....meh, anything with a drive-through or a clown....forget it!  I ordered the Rocket Double and a root beer float, it was good and I'll definitely go back there again when I'm nearby."}
{"text":"DISAPPOINTED!!!!!
I have been to this particular Johnny Rockets several times and always have had a good meal and prompt service.  That did not happen today.
I walked in and sat down, had to grab a server to get a menu...She took my drink order and left, and then came back and I ordered.  I ordered a chicken sandwich and a side salad.  After waiting about 15min, my salad was finally delivered.  It was fine, but it was another 5-10 min before my sandwich came out - and it was the wrong sandwich.  They had brought me the club instead of the chicken sandwich.  When it came back, they had just taken the chicken from the club, slathered mayonnaise on a freezer burned bun, and served it to me.  The chicken was literally swimming in mayo and had the taste of bacon on it.  The bun definitely had been in the freezer too long.  After waiting for a bit longer after eating, the server came back, never asking how things were, and i paid my bill.  I will think twice about eating here again."}
{"text":"I got the WORST food poisoning from here. I ordered \"the original\" burger expecting it to be great since I've had it at the Six Flags location before. I'm so disappointed with Johnny Rockets, now I'm afraid to ever have it again because I don't want to be up since 2am-7am being sick. And I'm sure the effects of the food poisoning aren't done yet.  I don't suggest this place for anyone!"}
{"text":"We went here to eat for a Family get together (Party of 14) We had the worst experience ever thanks to our server, Clemente. He was rushing us to order and when we finished ordering he practically snatched the menus from out hands. When our order finally came out, after what seemed like hours...he had forgotten to put half of our orders in! So we had to wait more for our food. He didn't even apologize for his mistake, he just said don't get mad your food will be out in 2 minutes. To make things worse, my daughter got up from her chair to go to the restroom and when she came back He had thrown away her food. She had bearly given her burger 2 bites! We didn't notice cause we were all chatting but he could of asked especially seeing that the burger was almost whole! The food was also not good, burger parties were too dry. Do not recommend this place at all!!!!"}
{"text":"Gets the job done. Good shakes, alright burgers, and awesome building in an old carousel building that is over a hundred years old. Bravo!"}
{"text":"35 minutes for terrible hash browns and horrible response from the staff the whole time? It's in line with other Johnny Rockets I've seen before... by that I mean it's a really terrible facsimile of a bad diner."}
{"text":"Terrible location right next to a children's play area, inattentive staff, slow service. The burgers and sloppy and fall apart after one bite. The waitress completely screwed up my order. The only redeeming thing was the milk shake. Sort of. It was poorly blended, more or less ice cream with milk poured over it. I wouldn't ever recommend coming here."}

Staff was overwhelmed. Cold onion rings and fries. Burger was pretty flavorless. COMPLETE waste of money. Don't bother with this place. Sorry JR....that was nothing good about you"}
{"text":"Menu has changed, food OK, no kid balloons. floors slippery when wet, servers did a very cute dance."}
{"text":"Overall good service, kids eat free was honored when seated at 4:57pm. Was waited on by a very courteous host and food within normal expectations.
Kids eat free m-w 11-5
Suggestion: Request the discount when your order your meal."}
{"text":"The food here was good. The smoke house burger was delicious and the banana-chocolate shake was yummy as well. Unfortunately, I wasn't very happy with the service and probably wouldn't go back to this location. 

1. My boyfriend's order was brought to the table 15 minutes after I had already gotten my meal. 

2. We had only been eating for maybe 5 minutes when our waiter tossed our check onto the table. He didn't even ask if we wanted anything else. They weren't closing soon and the place wasn't packed.

Overall- thumbs up to the food, thumbs down to the service. You're better off picking a different location if you want the full Johnny Rocket experience."}
{"text":"Our food and drinks took forever to come out. Once we got our food, it wasn't as good as expected. First we got our sandwiches then 5 mins later our fries. Tried one of their new Chicken sandwiches and the chicken was super cold. Felt like it had just came out the fridge! Waited another 5-10 mins for a new one to be made and by that time I was stuffed with fries. Not to mention that the new sandwich appeared smaller. Less guac & smaller piece of Chicken. Probably won't be returning here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Waited maybe 40 minutes for a below average burger with jalapeños. La cage au sport makes a much better burger, and they are a sports bar. Fries were ok and that's about it. 

Maybe the cooks were new and took this long to make a not so great burger, I don't know. Burger didn't bother me as much as the very long wait time I had. 10 minutes? Sure. 20 minutes? Ok, I am a patient man. 30 to 40 minutes? Running out of things to do on my iPhone!!"}
{"text":"Kinda disappointed. We ordered to go and got home (centennial, from Aliante, not far but not close either) and realized they didn't give us 2 orders of fries. Had to go back and pick up, and when I did asked if I could get a few extra sauces, they went a little skimpy on the first pick up, and since I had to come twice it would have been a nice gesture. They asked if I wanted ranch, and I said yes and maybe thousand island also (mind you we ordered for 6 people so about $60 order). The kid acted like he threw sauces in the bag (and again I didn't check the bag). Got home and he totally did not throw in extra sauces. Classy dude. Food was good except on my burger the lettuce was completely wilted and gross, the piece you would typically throw away. If I come back I'll make sure to hold the tip and check my bag before leaving."}
{"text":"Took an hour for our food to get to our table and by that time we needed to get it to go. I got the grilled chicken salad and it was horrible. Our waitress, in the full hour we were there, only came to our table 3 times. Drink order and food order (at the same time), to tell us our food was almost ready (a half hour after she took our order), then a half hour later to give us our check because she had someone else bring our food. And no they were not busy in the least but fully staffed. It was ridiculous."}
{"text":"I have always liked Johnny Rockets. When I was living in San Francisco I went there a lot. The food is good and I personally love a diner feel. That was all good and well.
But I am a little disappointed in the one here in Toronto. My food was good, my waitress was nice but the fact that I sat at the counter may have been a poor choice. The kitchen staff were behaving like 12 year olds. The manager was chewing them out every time he went back there. 
There was even a point where two of the guys decided to be immature and spray ketchup and mustard all over the place. The manager was pissed off but if I were him I would have taken action and kick them in the ass. 
Honestly, especially if you work in an open kitchen that everyone can see into, act like a professional."}
{"text":"Scenario: Christmas Eve. Me and the hubster are bored, it's just the two of us this year, no crazy family (yay!). We need to kill some time. 

We decide on Silverton. It's close and we love to browse around Bass Pro Shops. But we are hungry, it's lunch time. LIGHT BULB! There's a coupon in my 2011 Entertainment Book for Johnny Rockets in the Silverton. Perfect, it has been decided. 

The restaurant is in the newly renovated/added area and it's pretty small. There is a counter with maybe 8 seats, a few booths that seat 4 comfortably, and about 10 tables (a variety of 2 and 4 seaters). The 10 tables kind of hang into the casino area, and there wasn't a clear place to go to notify someone you were waiting for a table. We just kind of hung around waiting for one to open up. Luckily that wait wasn't long. 

Our coupon was buy-one-get one, up to a $7 value so we kept that in mind while ordering. I had the combo with Fries and a Bacon Cheeseburger. Husband had The Original combo with Onion Rings instead of Fries. Each came out to $7. So with tax, tip and drink we came out of pocket $14. I think the prices are kind of high, but we are in a casino/hotel so that might be one reason why.

The food came out pretty quickly and the server was OK, not amazing, but OK. My burger was very good! Lots of flavor, loved the pickle relish, special sauced rocked and the burger was moist and juicy. The fries were just, eh. Kind of under cooked in my opinion. I like 'em crunchy! Husband enjoyed his burger too, but agreed that the onion rings were just, eh. My only other issue was that the burger might have been just a little too juicy. I know, right! But the bun was kind of soggy at the end :( So maybe the burger wasn't too juicy, but the bun was to WEAK! LOL. 

I'm sure we will come back. I have another coupon and I was very happy overall with the experience. Next time milkshakes are a MUST!"}
{"text":"Great food and quick service - can't ask for more than that.  Luis was my server tonight and has waited on me several times in the past - he always does awesome job.  Thanks Luis and team!"}
{"text":"This Place was so delicious! It is located in the food court in Flamingo's. I had the bacon cheddar burger single. I almost ordered the double but glad i didn't! These burgers are huge.I also had it with chili cheese fries which were so good!! The staff were so nice also! Will be returning."}
{"text":"Got the smokehouse burger this trip. MELISSA was my server again and took my order in no time. It was the beginning of the lunch rush so service was great. The area is clean as always. I paid a little more than I liked to but the meal was tasty and service with a smile. They don't dance here like other stores, it's a mall location. 2 other workers came in at 12p and the place got livelier.

My bad....they do dance....Johnny Be Good"}
{"text":"I placed a to-go order.  I ordered at the cash register near the entrance and then waited at the food counter with my \"table number\".  The employees were not unfriendly, but did their job without smiling or interacting with me  There was no \"Hello!  Welcome to Johnny Rockets\" or \"How are you enjoying Kennywood?\" or \"Here's your food, I hope you enjoy it.\"  The food came out quickly in about 5 minutes.

The $5.99 black-bean burger was the frozen kind you can get at the store for a buck.  Bun and toppings were not distinguished, but it did the job as \"amusement park food\".  The $4.39 side of fries was merely OK, with no taste, but a good portion size.  I later doused it with salt and pepper.  I downed the food with a $3.79 Pepsi which was half ice."}
{"text":"Skip it...unless you absolutely must have a burger and you happen to be right there.  Expensive and not that good.  

We stopped by for a quick snack after visiting Shark Reef, mostly because we were thirsty.  The burger was okay, but the fries were cold.  I had originally ordered cheese fries, but they were out of cheese?

For the money we spent, we could have had something more enjoyable, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"Food was decent,  when we finally got it.  55 minutes from order time until it arrived. Folks, with larger parties and smaller, were about done eating when we got our food.  Wife's custom built burger was not correct after all that time either. Until i started expressing my dissatisfaction,  no one even seemed to care either.  I will likely never eat here again."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for a good Philly steak. This place was a disaster. A stale bun, tough, dry meat and bland fries doomed this over-priced, dull, uninspired sandwich. Not worthy of even a second rate greasy spoon. The staff were clearly unhappy, and I can't say i blame them. Working in the food service industry can be difficult and underpaid. But the effect was to make everyone at our table a little uncomfortable and the ambiance in the restaurant was decidedly muted, which was out of place given the rambunctious nature of Dundas Square. Even the decor was lackluster, trite and contrived, as it tried and failed to capture something of the 1950s diner genre. I don't usually get particularly shrill about a bad meal, but the whole restaurant reeked of indifference and I can't think of a reason to bother going back."}
{"text":"LOVE the food, LOVE the ambiance, service is not impressive but friendly enough, but the bath room wreaks more then Chevron."}
{"text":"We gave them another try. This time at 9pm for dessert. We wanted to play some music and requested some change and was told the juke box system does not work. The guy went on to tell us they just run a Pandora list with some crappy old music on it. My friend asked of they still dance and was told, \"No we don't dance, we are a franchise not a real Johnny Rockets."}
{"text":"Sad, Sad, Sad. This place is very expensive, total bill $18.03. 
Four of us doing a test taste.
We ordered 1 double burger $7.29 with cheese $0.99 bacon $0.99 (bacon was slimy, yuck!) lettuce and tomato $0.59. On my receipt it says- add wedge lettuce and tomato, there was no wedge it was a sad piece of old lettuce and a slice of tomato. The total cost of the burger was $9.86. We were not impressed at all. We've had amazing burgers for under $7.00. (See my other reviews for that information).
Also, ordered 1 Chocolate Shake $3.99, it was okay. It tasted like drinking Hershey chocolate syrup out of the bottle and then (drum roll) one amazing Strawberry Shake $3.99. The Strawberry Shake was outstanding. The only reason why we gave them 2 stars is because of the Strawberry Shake. I migth stop in for a Strawberry Shake in the future but nothing else."}
{"text":"Burgers were great. Park map lists other item on kids menu that do not exist like a simple hot dog. But nice place with air conditioning prices seem awfully high. 3.75 for a soda 10 buck for a burger. Thats a bit excessive"}
{"text":"Good place to grab a quick bite before a show - no frills. If you think about it, all buffets and sit in restaurants are over rated and too elaborate if all you want is a quick bite, other than Starbucks.

I'm headed to the Fantasy show at Luxor and stopped by here at 9:00 pm.

Got the tiniest meal on the menu - perhaps too basic - I could have had some lettuce and tomato but that would have bern a couple bucks more - I just missed it b/c I thought all burgers had L&T to my surprise.

The patty seems to be hand-pressed. If it wasn't for that, I could have thought this was a MickyD plain burger, just a little thicker and privier.

I love the location of this joint ~ Classic/Vintage Excalibur walkway to Royal Towers - so many memories!

Hint: Ask for a plastic soufflé cup for your ketchup.

Friendly staff~

Charged my meal to my room~"}
{"text":"Food is good, but a la carte so no fries with those burgers. Also, if you are from UNLV, they no longer take Rebel Cash. Milkshakes are good and thick."}
{"text":"My wife and I came in for a quick bite before a movie. Our waiter Clemente was extremely accommodating from the moment we first walked in until we left. Something about his friendly demeanor, attention to detail and outstanding customer service was very refreshing. We really appreciated everything!"}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start!!!!! 
This place is a disgrace to the name 
Food takes for ever to be served every time I looked up the employees were always grouped up talking so It took for ever to get the attention of one to come help us out.
Don't get me wrong I was willing to let that go but When we finally got our food my burger was burned! It was hard and dry... Smh* I paid allot for my food I'm not going to just eat something I don't like I ask the cashier if I could get a FRESH burger 
And after going back and fourth for what seemed like 10 freaking minutes they finally agreed to re make it 
Horrible experience horrible costumer service I will NEVER COME BACK 
And I will make sure to tell people about this horrible experience! 
They need to change management or better train the employees cause they just don't seem to know what they are doing"}
{"text":"The waitress was so sweet, super friendly and as accurate as she could get. I ordered the veggie burger and my daughter the bacon cheese burger. Both were cooked to perfection. The fries are bottomless, can't beat that! The onion rings were delicious, especially when smothered in their ranch dressing. The vegetables were crisp and ripe and the buns were perfectly soft. Our drinks were always filled and service was fast. 

Our waitress was a total sweetheart. She noticed my daughters Keropi watch from McDonalds and told us of how many her daughter had collected. We told her we had just visited 3 different McDonald's locations  in search of that Hello Kitty watch and we had no luck. She immediately went to the back room and came back with an unopened Hello Kitty watch and offered it to us!!! I was amazed. I hugged and thanked her. She reminded me that there still are giving people in the world!!!"}
{"text":"This place always has a long wait. Every time I go, it is completely empty and I have an hour wait. The firs year it was good but then they cut the menu in more than half. It went from 20 options to 6 options. This place barely deserves two stars."}
{"text":"I originally tried my first Johnny Rockets in Los Angeles. My first experience there ever eating Johnny Rockets was awesome... unfortunately my second time ever trying Johnny Rockets at this location in Las Vegas did not prove the same results. For some reason, during my visit, it took a while for the food to come. Which caused a chain reaction because when the food was actually delivered, the fries were not hot and didn't seem fresh. The burgers were also warm instead of hot."}
{"text":"NO CHILI  How can you go to johnny rockets without CHILI. They pictures of chili burgers and chili fries but NO CHILI ANYMORE. Management trying to make it easier for the kitchen staff. There is very few places to get a good chili burger, chili fry and a bowl of chili without beans."}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience here they honestly took forever to take my order and the woman Gisselle who was taking orders  spoke to the people before us for a very long time ignoring that she had customers waiting  and then rushed us along she didn't repeat my order back to me when I heard her repeat other people's orders back to them and got kind of annoyed with me because I mentioned we waited for a long time she just looked at me like I was the rude one.  I never leave reviews at all and I just did today because I personally felt like she had nor respect. I felt like it was just rude to ignore all these people waiting in line and it was a long line and not to open the other registers and to continue talking for about 10mins which doesn't seem long but is very long if you're just standing there watching people ignore you."}
{"text":"the crew sucks, made me wait 50 min for a sandwich.. no apologies ...nothing!!!! if there is a half rating, that is what iam going to give them. they don't even deserve s star!!!"}
{"text":"Suprised to see low reviews on this spot because my visit was quite nice!  

We were seated in a huge booth that made us giggle and had great service from a young gal.

I went old school with an orange float- delicious with 2 huge scoops of ice cream.  My moms cherry Coke was just fine.

Onion rings were nice & hot!!  My patty melt was decent but not memorable... I did eat it all though!

Love the juke box & vintage decor."}
{"text":"I asked for a cup of hot water to make baby food. They asked for 1.08 charged me for the cup. I know it's Vegas, but what about customer service??"}
{"text":"The food tastes great woth its unli fries but the restroom is filthy.....the worst thing is that it's just beside their kitchen"}
{"text":"Do not have jasmine serve you,  if she is the server go to the counter she ignored us the whole time while she was flirting with guys from the pizza place , she ripped me off 7$ with my change and when i asked her about it i guess she thought she could flirt with me till i forgot but she is very immature and unattractive. So i contact corp and nothing not even an automated reply email.....sad ...so 40$ on 2 burgers and a drink and im forced to tip 50% bull****.....don't know how she still has a job... im a lil torn on the star rating cuz i was there Thursday night /Friday morning  and had the beesssst service  stacey or lacey (forgot her name, blond lady) should run customer service class for these other mindless bimbos they have there. ..ok rant over"}
{"text":"Ok food with high prices for what you get. Burgers and Shakes are good."}
{"text":"Well that didn't last long.... Less than a year and the prices are already going up.  Never really busy when I am here, at most there have been 3 other patrons during my visit... So maybe they are trying to compensate for the overhead and lack of business by raising prices, but that's not going to work people.  Look at all the other  places around you, your competition's pretty high. Four other burger places at this intersection alone. My order has gone up nearly $3 since my first visit.... Dangerous, especially in this neighborhood!

While I am thrilled to have added options in this area, if they're gonna play this game it's not worth it..

Burgers used to be juicy and flavorful, now they are just the thin dryness I expected before my first visit (see first review).  The fries are decent still if you can get them hot or fresh.  Today's visit they were downright chewy. A pigeon would probably turn the other way! When I asked for new ones the manager didn't seem surprised, guess he thought I might just keep quiet.  When I brought it up his response was \"oh, do you want fresh ones made?\" Sigh. No, I'd like more chewy ones left over from the lunch rush that have been under the heat lamp for an hour please!

As I am writing this they have customers sitting at the outside table between their two entrance doors smoking and throwing their butts on the ground.  Rude, distasteful, gross, and ILLEGAL... But the staff is too busy in their conversation to do anything, what about the manager you say? Oh well he is too busy \"Scaring the 'crap' out of\" the cashier to care...yes, crap was just yelled across this \"family\" restaurant.

Oh JRs, I know you're the lonely stepchild of Johnny Rockets, so I was skeptical to love you at all... Turns out if I just have it enough time I would be right... My love for you was shorter than a Hollywood marriage."}
{"text":"This was a huge disappointment!  I have been to many Johnny Rockets and this must be the worst!  First, the cashier did not understand that we wanted 2 shakes, we finally settled for 2 large drinks.  Which was a good choice after seeing what size we would have gotten for $7!!  
When we received our food, it was not hot, had NO taste and really did not live up to what I would get at any other Johnny Rockets!  
Save your money and head over to Dairy Queen for your burger fix!!"}
{"text":"My good friend from California was out for a visit and we stopped in to Johnnie Rockets for lunch, it was busy which I took to be a \"good\" sign. For some reason as we stood there, waiting to be seated, most of the workers appeared a bit dazed and confused, but we were soon seated with menus & water, and then our waiter \"Kenny\" showed up to offer us a beverage or ice cream shake. We just ordered our burgers and fries. The cook was a little slow getting the food out that day, but Kenny let us know right away and kept us updated - along with his apologies for the wait time. I have to say, he actually made the waiting almost \"fun\". Once the food did arrive it was very good as expected. I will be back, thanks Kenny, & thanks JR's."}
{"text":"I'm a slowly converting Vegan from California, and came to the fashion show mall on a visit, and the squad decided to get johnny rockets, well I don't like burger establishments for obvious reasons, but man o man, if you come and get the chance to meet Erwin Araiza, then you just met a Godamn God! I told him I don't eat meat anymore and he didn't Judge me! And when I told him that I've been craving a milkshake He went out of the way and preceded to go make me the best Shake I've ever had in my life! He said he made sure that it was gonna be the best! The fries were alright tho... but regardless it was a great hilarious experience! The only thing is that I might just be a vegetarian instead, I can't live my life without another Milk Shake"}
{"text":"The hamburgers were fried very thin, as if they were pressed down on the griddle so they would fill the bun.  Both the hamburgers and BLTs seemed very dry.  While I like retro-hamburger restaurants, I will pass up Johnny Rockets from now on."}
{"text":"Idk what to say, but clean, convenient, and too cool for school! 
I come to this Johnny Rockets more often than the rest! it rawks! 
the staff at the counter serves me right quick with a smile!
 I don't have any real complaints! 
I always vary my order! Truthfully, my fav is the #12, it has a nice kick! sometimes,
I ask them to add bacon and burn my meat... and they get it right everytime.
well, they don't serve me a hockey puck, they serve me the right amount of the
char-meat-juiciness I request! 
The fries are a must!  I dig the lil sweet potato fries or the chili cheese fries if I'm 
stopping by for a lil bite (no burger)
the place is open late, which is cool! I really really like the 50's atmosphere!
someday i hope they can get those retro-counter jukeboxes to work. lol  
Hey! the cool part is it has a nice 50's vibe! 
for me, it is a bit of a drive to go there and it is sooo worth it!
Thx, keep it up!"}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre....nothing like the food I had at the franchise location at Arrowhead.....The employees were not upbeat like I expected...no music, no little jukeboxes on the tables, NO SODA available ( machine not working) They said they were going to call the manager but who knows if they ever did...totally disappointing experience....$23.00 down the tubes!"}

First time I tried Johnny Rockets Burger was back in New Jersey, year 2007. I frequently ate there which obviously means I enjoyed their food- but all I could remember recently was how they make a smiley face for you with the ketchup (random thought...).

Anyways, because there is no Johnny Rockets in Vancouver, I was excited when I saw one in Dundas Square. Keep in mind that I really enjoy burgers from the Big Smoke Burger (Check out my review here) but I really did not enjoy my burger at one of the ultimate Burger spots in Toronto that everyone seems to love, the Burgers Priest (Check out my review here). So when it comes to burgers, I guess I don't always agree with the majority- and that's why I am always on the look out for new burger joints. 

I dropped by for lunch on a weekday and it wasn't too busy so we were seated right away. I love restaurants with themes (if they are done right) and Johnny Rocket has the old juke box plus booths in red which creates the old classic American diner theme and I just love it so much!!

Ordered: Bacon Cheddar Single 4/5

* Smoked bacon, double cheddar cheese, iceberg lettuce, fresh tomato, white onion and special sauce in a burger for $10.99
* Burgers are hand pattied at a full 1/3 pound of fresh 100% beef
* Substituted fries for chili fries at extra $1.99
* Burgers are fresh and their special sauce is delicious (reminds me Big Mac sauce)
* I could taste all individual veggies (lettuce, tomato and onions) 
* Bacon was thick and juicy (not too salty)
* Hamburger bun was just soft/hard enough to hold all the ingredients together
* Tasted like something between McDonalds and the Big Smoke Burger
* It doesn't taste greasy like fast-food but not too heavy like gourmet burgers
* Chili fries were just horrible (soggy)
* I've decided I hate chili fries and am never getting them again in the future
* I was super stuffed after one burger

Ordered: Strawberry Milkshake 5/5

* Hand-dipped & Hand-spun Strawberry milkshake for $5.99
* Made with the finest USDA certified premium vanilla icecream, whole milk and real whipped cream
* Their milkshake is nice and thick, you can def tell that it's made with real ice cream
* Popular item at Johnny Rockets, 3 other tables ordered it too (all strawberry!)
* Served in a glass cup with a handle and the leftovers come in a metal cup
* Can taste real strawberries
* I really don't like fake syrupy fruit tasting milkshakes
* For $5.99, it's not cheap but this is one of my guilty pleasures

Near the end of the meal, I checked into Johnny Rockets on yelp and they had a checking in special. Spend minimum $30 on entire order and $5 off! I've never used these special codes so I asked them about it first, being unsure if it's valid or not. They said that I was the first one ever to use it but it works! And now they know such thing exist so if you have an iphone, check in on yelp and get $5 off.

Summary: Johnny Rockets do their burger right but you can skip the french fries. If you have room, try one of their milkshakes and I guarantee it will be one of the best milkshakes you ever had. I've been back couple more times since my first visit and I still love it! If only it wasn't so cold out, I would even get their milkshakes to go."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant twice. The first time was ok. Food wasn't too good and my order was wrong but I didn't complain because I was ready to get out. 

When I went back recently, the wait time to be seated took  forever. The hostess told me a 5 to 10 minute wait and told everyone that signed up that. All of a sudden it was a 10 to 12 minute wait. Then it was 20. Anyway, we waited because we didn't feel like going anywhere else. By the way, we ended up waiting for 40 minutes. The whole time, 2 tables were not being used. Several people were getting angry because they were waiting longer than us but some people got seated first. The hostess/waiters failed to call the name out properly so some people that were seated or standing nearby couldn't hear. They made no attempt to be loud or ask anyone nearby if they were waiting for a table. 

The waitress we had was great and accommodating and the burger I ordered was great. The fries were nothing special. I'm assuming they were frozen. Anyway, I won't be coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"The burger was pretty good for a burger place, but there are several places in Gilbert that are better than here.  Our fries were like lukewarm and some not fully cooked which was not so good.  The onion rings we had were ok, but again, not very hot.  Doubt we will return here, the Habit Burger is consistently better."}
{"text":"I took the family last night to the Silverton for Winter Wonderland and decided to grab something to eat at Johnny Rockets. Every table was dirty.... we wiped it down our self... waiter came by 10 min later to hand us menus and we waited for another 10 min and decided to leave... it seems like she had forgotten about us... horrible service. We ended up going across the street to In N Out..."}
{"text":"Thomas is an AMAZING person and he was so attentive and made sure that we were taken care of. His personality makes the wait worth it! He also told us that it was going to be 115° out so he gave each of us ice water to go without question! THANK YOU, THOMAS, for making our experience at Jonny Rocket's so pleasant! What a great start to our day!!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience today!!! They took forever to take our order, I had to get my own water, they ran out of ice, some of our party didn't receive food with the rest of us (30 min later), our checks got screwed twice. No apologies from management! Never again. Beware!!"}
{"text":"Overpriced and subpar hamburgers. They've tried really hard to make it like a 50s diner, but have failed miserably."}
{"text":"This Johnny Rockets is better than the rest.  Even other Johnny Rockets.  Customer Service went above and beyond what we expected.  The Manager was extremely helpful.  They did nothing wrong, but acted like they did.  We would definitely return.  Food was excellent.  Shakes were great!"}
{"text":"Place is gross!! One of few places that was open late @ luxor food court. It was disgusting. Frozen and microwaved \"breakfast\". AVOID"}
{"text":"I mean this guy Jason is legit the best person yo have working here!! His cheeks are like the sunshine to your morning: he is the best!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here before a Cardinals game to avoid having to pay stadium prices for food, but that was a mistake as food here cost more than stadium food and you get nothing more out of it. The food was ok. Not great as our burgers weren't hot, but I let it slide since it was packed in there and they probably weren't staffed for a game since it was pre-season. 

Starting from the beginning, there was a wait, but it wasn't bad given how packed that mall was 2 hours before the game. We waited and made conversation with other fans in line. When we were seated we told them 4, but we only got 1 menu for the table. we saw another on a table they were clearing next to us and took it, but they knew there were 4 of us and there were plenty of menus at the hostess area so I thought that was weird. When I asked for more menus they said there weren't many options so just to pick from one. True, there were only a couple options, but why were they so weird about giving us more menus at a sit-down restaurant? 

We ordered shakes and burgers. The shakes were amazing and curbed our appetites so we weren't hangry during the wait for our food. When the food came out the burgers were tiny and they didn't look anything like the menu pictures. They were McDonalds sized burger with nothing on them. Also they were served on the tiniest paper plates. I felt like I was eating food that had been served from a truck- which don't get me wrong, it can be good, but there is a time and a place which doesn't include inside of a sit-down restaurant eating an overpriced cold burger.

I asked for condiments, but the waiter looked at me like I was crazy. I think he thought I said condoms the first time judging by the look on his face so I repeated condiments louder and slower. I did that another time, but my husband cut me off and said ketchup to which the waiter registered the request and ran off to get it. I wanted more than just ketchup, but that was all they had so I made do. 

I went to put some ketchup on the burger and noticed that it had no cheese on it. I asked for cheese and was told my burger didn't come with cheese. I grabbed a coveted menu and showed her the picture of the burger I ordered. She said that wasn't cheese, it was mustard. At this point I am hangry now and I already have my food so they can't mess with it so I quip back with something to the affect of \"Oh, I didn't realize that they started making mustard in singles slices...\". She got me a slice of cheese, but adding cold cheese to a burger is not enjoyable so I just got to eating my burger. 

I couldn't get out of there fast enough and will be smarter about my dinner choices next time I am at this mall."}
{"text":"Meat had no flavor. Needs seasoning. Meal is very pricey. $20 for single patty burger, fries and a drink. Are you sh*@ttin me??? Nice 50's style atmosphere with music and dancers. I did enjoy all you can drink self serve drinks. Will i be returning? thats a big negative!"}
{"text":"New management sure does change a lot of things. The place was clean staff stayed busy and were very friendly. I enjoyed a shake and a Philly cheesesteak. The food was perfect and I'll definatley go there again. Thanks to Metin the new manager I was very satisfied."}
{"text":"First time here and last time here. The only thing saving this place from zero stars is the fries and tots were good. The staff was very inefficient and unhelpful. I tried to order a bacon cheddar with grilled onions only to be informed that grilled onions were for the veggie burgers only. Go figure. Next my daughter asked if she could just order a burger without the combo. She was informed she could but the cashier didn't tell her the burger alone was $11.95 and the combo was $12.95 so we got charged $11.95. FYI there is no burger only prices on their menu, just combos. The burgers themselves were extremely overpriced for very basic flavorless burgers. Very disappointing. Save your time tastebuds and money and eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Would give zero stars if I could. Horrible service. Let take out food sit until it gets cold and then calls you to come get it. Pancakes hard and cold. Workers with very POOR attitudes!  Ordered just the buttermilk pancakes and they almost got my order wrong. Nasty.  Don't go here"}
{"text":"4 stars coz willie is always so nice. Dont get butthurt if it is not fancy. Its a burger place. And about the same amount of money you would spend at the drive thru. The service is good. The cook undercooks the fries so ask for crispy well done fries...."}
{"text":"The Manager's Special catches anybody eyes that is on a budget. It's about $6 bucks for a burger and fries. Drink separate!!! I like the prices...
I am not sure if the fries are refillable... you want more fries, just ask!!!
The service was slow considering that there was n o one in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Samantha was the BEST server ever! We are local  business owners ourselves and we recognize good service. Samantha had a smile the entire time! And it was closing time! How?!! Because she's professional and experienced! Best burgers on the planet eat! Just add avocado!! :)"}
{"text":"jose made the best hamburgers i've experiences here at johnny rockets and i will most definitely come back. service was very well"}
{"text":"Took my daughter and nephews to,the splash pad @ westgate they wanted rootbeer floats. So i wentover to Johnny Rockets to order 4 rootbeer floats to go. I waited about 7 minutes @ the to go counter before someone came over to acknowledge me & took my order, I waited another 30 minutes for 4 rootbeer floats. If it was'nt for the kids i would've ask for my money back and went to Cold Stone. As i was waiting the waiters & waitress kept walking by and starring at me, they could aleast said Hi. They made me feel unwelcomed & uncomfortable. The wait was ridiculous for not being busy. If it was possible i would'nt even give one star."}
{"text":"Awesome burger, especially for inside a mall. Service was great, waitress was awesome."}
{"text":"First off, we never got food here so I can't say if that's any good. 

Walked in and waited about 5 minutes before just sitting down at a table, no one greated us. Another 5-10 minutes before menus showed up. Waited another 15 minutes for a server, realized the people that were waiting when we got there were still waiting for someone to take their order.

Got up and left. Half an hour without even talking to someone."}
{"text":"Arrive 20 minutes before closing, only to be told we can't sit at the counter because they want to start closing.  Ok,  so go to take out to order 4 shakes to then be told,  sorry we ran out of ice cream.  So then I asked to talk to a manager only to be told there was no manager working.  I asked for the managers name and number. After a few minutes was told,  sorry we can't give out that information. 

What a total joke... an over priced total joke."}
{"text":"I haven't had Johnny Rockets in a while and I came to this one and the cashier Josue gave me the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE ever. He greeted me kindly and knew exactly what to recommend on the menu. The cook Ivan made a MOUTH WATERING burger that will definitely make me come back for more. Will recommend people to try these burgers and will be back. 10/10"}
{"text":"This was my first time visiting a Johnny Rockets and i loved the burgers and the staff..... 1950's theme. The side of fries should be a little bigger but overall it was a good meal."}
{"text":"Great tasting beef makes this hamburger one of my favorites. The cheese fries are over the top, had one every night leaving the Casino."}
{"text":"We have eaten at this location several times with B+ service and experience.  This evening we were lucky enough to have Marciano as our server!  The restaurant was full and we had lowered our expectations due to the crowd.  Marciano was incredible from the time we were seated through to the time we left.  It seemed like the second we thought of something we may need to refills appearing as though by telepathy. Our evening continued wonderfully and we appreciate the contribution from Johnny Rockets!
Thank you!"}
{"text":"I had a great visit at Johnny Rockets! Our burgers were tasty, while the fries were crispy. our server made sure to handle all our needs, and The staff was all very attentive while working. We enjoyed the staff dancing so much, and we received ketchup faces with our meal!! We will sure be back for a fun visit!"}
{"text":"this is the worst location i have ever been too.  i have gone into this location 2 times and both occasions i was never greeted, never waited on, and when i approached a server they looked at me like i was bothering them. the best part, the manager was working. i will eat at johnny rockets again once this stores manager is fired. he useless and can't control his staff.  both times i walked out.  do not eat here. i got better customer service at jack in the box.....and paid a lot less....i will be escalating this issue to corporate....good luck!"}
{"text":"Well theres a lot to say about this johnny rockets! First I'm disgusted I watched a chef touch the trash then without changing gloves or washing his hands started touching peoples food! And all of the servers were short and rude not one smiling face amongst the employees. The vanilla shake I ordered tasted weird and the order of fries I got wasnt more than a small handful of fries and they were cold. The floors were disgusting as were the counters and the employees kept shouting at each other across the resturant. They lost tickets for the food so they had no clue who it went to and instead of going to figure it out the employee stood there and did nothing. Over all I would not return to this place even if someone paid me to..."}
{"text":"We came here for the vegiburger..it is the best one we have found yet in LV. Sure its a bocaburger(tm), nothing special there, but it is made with care on the grill, and put on a big bun with all the toppings. It tastes great and its much better than what I could have done at home.
One tasty vegiburger, fries and an orange soda makes me a happy girl!"}
{"text":"Placing the order was a breeze and didn't expect the prices to be as high as they were.  The original burger and large fries and a kids size milkshake was $16.00. The burger was \"ok\".   It was smothered in mustard and pickles, onions etc.  It was tasty but not worth the price.   I thought the fries would be like shoestring fries but they were not.  I ordered the \"large\" size and expected there to be more. The small size must be really small.    I think the restaurant is a nice touch at Kennywood.    It was nice to sit in air conditioning and use a restroom that didn't smell like a gym locker room or was hot.   The service was good and there was plenty of seating.  The food was ok - but doubt I would be back the prices are just too above average for me."}
{"text":"Sweet Potato Fries!! Need I say more! The food is fresh and cooked. Had the Swiss/Mushroom burger & sweet potatoe fries. Both delicious and filling.

Everyone must know that any hotel on the strip of off will be much more expensive then ordinary places.Do not expect to pay McDonald's, Jack in the Box, Burger King etc.. prices. If you expect those prices then you should go there.

When in a 5 star Hotel/Casino, Expect those Prices!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came before a concert and were seated somewhat quickly. It was fairly busy, but after sitting for 10 minutes without even being acknowledged by an employee we decided to leave and eat elsewhere."}
{"text":"I got to say I love their food specially the chili cheese fries and milkshakes BUT they have really poor customer service at this location. I learned the hard way.  They got my order wrong I asked for BBQ sauce instead of mayo  which they ended up putting mayo I  also paid  for extra Cheese and chilli on my fries  which they ended up putting barely cheese and NO chilli. Is it really hard to take someone's order? Not to mention that when you come up to them and say  hey you messed up my order they give you a dirty look like you are trying to get something out of the situation."}
{"text":"Food is good -- I got the Vegan burger so I was happy they had that option for me. Convenient being in the mall close to the theatres. The atmosphere is always fun but the service was just okay. I'm not surprised this particular location only received at most 3 stars."}
{"text":"I come to Vegas several times a year and this has been one of my worst food experiences here!!!

I understand that it was Christmas Day and the food court was busy, but this service was inexcusable! I got in a line just to order 2 shakes. Then, I proceeded to patiently wait with my family while I watched many others get their orders. However, I did notice that many other customers were also complaining about being mischarged and getting wrong orders. I observed that one of the workers had \"started\" my order by filling up a couple plastic cups with ice cream... but then left them open on the counter unfinished for the next 30 minutes!!!

After 30 long minutes (and several other customers who had ordered full meals after me had received their orders), the workers finally decided to finish my shakes with the same old ice cream that had been sitting out! Even then, I had to wait for someone who ordered 2 minutes ago to get their order before they gave me my shakes. 

So close to asking for a full refund! Never coming back here again!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious!  I got the route 66 burger, with the bacon cheese fries and a chocolate banana shake which hubby and I shared both the fries and shake. My husband got the original burger. He thought it looked kind of small. 

Everything came out hot and fresh not long after we ordered. The server was very attentive and really brought us everything we needed. My hubby brought me here on a Groupon.  Both he and I were pleasantly surprised at the taste and quality of the food. I usually don't eat this kind of food at home. Definitely a good reasonably priced meal to get your day started."}
{"text":"This location is in the Flamingo hotel and it is certainly convenient for location and hours. The service is prompt and friendly. The food ranks right up there in quality and taste. The fries are nothing to write home about but the other menu selections are very good. Nice variety. The shakes are the best you are going to get for the price and convenience.  The only drawback is that it shred it's location with the rest of the food court so the atmosphere is a little different than stand alone locations. Great late night eats for sure."}
{"text":"Been here many times and totally lucked out because we always seem to get Roy!   He is super conscientious and friendly and our food always comes out as ordered.  This place is the perfect diner and Roy the consummate server.  

Thanks Johnny Rockets, y'all do it right!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Johnny Rockets I guess because I like the ole \"Soda Shop\" Feel.  This one is probably at a bit of a disadvantage because of where it is located.  Bar only, so there isn't any intimacy with your date or wife, or whatever.

The staff is friendly, and I thought my Strawberry Shake was good.  The Onion Rings didn't really sit well with me though. They were a bit TOO crisp, and I didn't care for the oil they were using. The Burger was good though, not great, but I ate the whole thing, so it was at least good enough for that!

As with all the nearby places, the prices are undoubtedly elevated to fit with the location, so keep this in mind."}
{"text":"Holy cow that was an amazing cheeseburger!!! Just started eating meat again (was a vegetarian) and I highly recommend getting a hamburger from here! Yummy!"}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten in 24 hours. Usually, when this is the case, everything I eat tastes amazing. Even if it's not amazing, it's damn good, because I'm starving.

This mean, however, was atrocious. We waited forever for it and it was expensive (we knew that was going to be the case. It IS in a casino). Yet, all this could have been forgiven if the food was standard. I've been to Johnny Rockets many times, and the consistency is pretty good. What I had this day was unrecognizable.

The fries were overcooked and soggy. And the burger? The burger was awful. It was oily and mushy. There was no tomato, onion, pickle, anything! There were two half inch long pieces of shredded lettuce. Really? If I hadn't been starving, I would have thrown it away. Did it fill me up? Yes. Would I ever it again? No. I wouldn't even feed it to my dog."}
{"text":"Just had a juicy burger from this place and I was super pleased at how quickly they brought it out to me! The waitress had great customer and my baby loved her! We'll be coming back soon when she's there"}
{"text":"Thomas was an overly attentive waiter. As much as I appreciate him in wanting so much to please, he was borderline annoying. At the same time, he seemed to be the ONLY one there who cared about the customer! He deserves a promotion!!"}
{"text":"Still on e of the best Burger joints in town. Fun place to take the kids, especially wen they break into the sing and dance at random times. The location we went to this time (Silverton Casino) did not do that though, but were there for the burger and shakes! Service was pretty good, and did not take long to get our food. You can see pretty much all the process of getting your food prepared which is always a positive thing. I always get the Mushroom and Swiss burger and this one did not disappoint. Portions are pretty generous and prices reasonable."}
{"text":"My first time in Vegas and my first time having Johnny Rockets in a very long time so I was extremely excited to get some again, however I was somewhat disappointed the young lady taking our order. Seemed like she didn't care whatsoever. 
My boyfriend and I sat at the counter waiting for our food while she goes to the back and we constantly hear laughing and little squeals like she is obviously messing around. She comes flying out of the back like someone is trying to throw something at her and she is running from it, in fact screwing around. She goes back and gets a bucket of water and stands on a step stool to clean the top of a machine. She is taking her sweet time yet constantly complaining how the manager or owner wants the employees to clean a ton of stuff to the cook (Richard which was the only name I got because she constantly kept saying his name). An older lady was already running around doing a ton of things including taking orders since the younger lady stopped doing so. While complaining about all the cleaning they have to do, she says out loud to where customers can hear, \"Well she's not doing anything\" which was very obviously untrue since we were listening and watching. The only person not doing anything was in fact herself. 
The older lady gets us our food, gives us straws and is very polite about it. She even checks up on us after awhile to asks how everything is. Very hard worker. A good 25-30 minutes later, when we are almost done eating, this younger girl is still cleaning the same machine. Not even different parts, just still wiping down the top of the machine and talking to the cook.Now she is complaining, \"I just want to go home. Can I go home Richard?\" over and over. Finally I guess he tells her to leave and she VERY LOUDLY says, \"Shut the f*** up Richard!\" then realizes how loud she said it and starts laughing about it then just over and over again is saying \"Shut up\" and laughing. Doing absolutely nothing but getting paid for screwing around.
The food was very good, the customer service from the older lady was amazing, but I absolutely wouldn't recommend this Johnny Rockets in Mandalay Bay if the younger lady is there while constantly screwing around and cursing very loudly to where many different customers can hear then complaining about other people doing nothing when she did absolutely nothing except take one order."}
{"text":"If I could rate it lower than one star I would.  Poor service, been waiting an hour for burgers.  When we questioned the waitress regarding the wait for food she replied, the kitchen isn't equipped to handle this many people.  It would be a nice location to open a freaking restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the 50's diner experience & Johnny Rockets does it great."}
{"text":"Gee. I had been wanting to try this place forever!  My boyfriend and I are on a hunt for our favorite burgers, so we are in the process of trying every burger place in Vegas.

This one was so disappointing.

I have never had staff members make me feel awkward until we ate here.  From the strange hostess to our extremely awkward/rude server, the vibes were just uncomfortable.  

I ordered the smoke house single burger with the barbecue ranch on the side and cheese fries.  My boyfriend ordered the Houston burger with an egg and grilled onions, also with cheese fries.

My burger was served with regular fries and no sauce. We told the person that brought our food that we both ordered cheese fries, so she fixed that.  Later when our server came by we asked her for the sauce I had ordered on the side.  She was like \"oh you still want that?\" Lol yes I ordered it on the side\".. After that she dropped our check and never came back.  Even when we were completely come eating we could not find her.  We tried to flag down another waitress but that failed.  We got ahold of the hostess and asked to pay.  She said our server had to cash us out, so we told her we haven't seen her in at least 10 minutes.  Finally she came out from hiding with an attitude and cashed us out and put the check back on the table.  \"Thanks.\"  Yeah, pretty rude and unprofessional.  It was one of the rare moments where I considered not leaving a tip, but being in this industry doesn't allow you to do that without a guilty conscious. 

Aside from the terrible service the food was decent.  The sourdough onion rings on my burger were different, in a good way.  Even with cheese, the fries were bland.  But dipping them in the barbecue ranch made them edible.  We were too full to try a milkshake.  I won't be returning to this location but hopefully we can try a shake at another location sometime.

Food is pretty pricey, $30 for two burgers.  They come with fries ($1 more for cheese fries).  Good thing we had a groupon."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. Had to ask to get the shake we ordered and then we had to wait an additional 10 minutes after our food was brought out for the shake... not only are the staff incompetent,they are unfriendly, and  couldn't even manage to get the soda machine working.. to the owner, restaff your restaurant..."}
{"text":"We were greeted and seated right away by Thomas who was by far the nicest and most professional waiter in the world.

I thought the food was delish!!  For fast food it might be a bit long but this place is more of an eat in kinda place with the option to order at the counter and go. 

I highly recommend and ask for Thomas if possible it will make the 10 min wait for ur food well worth it.  

Johnny rocket  ftw over in n out hands down"}
{"text":"It's a diner. You're not really going to expect anything amazing. The wait staff is really nice which is good. It is really really loud in here. It's like being in cafeteria at high school. Food is ok, burgers were tiny.. tots weren't crispy.. it was fine."}
{"text":"No wonder this place needs a Groupon...

The food LOOKS like it'll be good but then you taste it and it's just bland and soggy. The burgers just DON'T TASTE GOOD AT ALL!!! wtf??! To put this into perspective, I'd rather eat a Mcdonald's mcChicken.

The worst part is: they charge $10 for a SHITTY burger lol. I got the ROUTE 66. Doesn't the description look like it'd taste amazing???!

\"This favorite is named after the iconic, carefree, American Highway. Swiss cheese, grilled mushrooms, grilled onions & mayonnaise.\"

NOPE. Tasted really bland. It's just bad. The meat was bad, the cheese was bad...it was just a bad experience.

Then we got this apple pie a la mode. You can't mess this up right? 

WRONG AGAIN. Got the dessert half melted. Apple pie tasted like cardboard and it wasn't even warm. Ice cream tasted like fat-free milk in half-solidified form.

I just can't. Never again.....

I don't know if it's just this location, but avoid Fashion Strip Mall Johnny Rockets."}
{"text":"Terrible service. Took over 20 minutes to make one chocolate shake with only 3 other customers in the restaurant, don't know what the workers were doing in the mean time... never again at this location."}
{"text":"Today we stopped in and right off the bat Thomas an Asian guy was AMAZING!!!! He had great customer service and went above and beyond!!! The other workers just went about their day, he stood out and treated us amazing!!! Will definitely recommend people to come eat here and see Thomas!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was flipping out from all the frickin' Vegas craziness and I decided to get a milkshake. Best decision ever. Yes, it was like 8 dollars, yes it was not good for me, but God was it good. I am so happy this Johnny Rockets exists. They have amazing staff and it's very quick."}
{"text":"Flies everywhere, service was horrible and we started at dirty tables our entire meal. Don't even give it a shot."}
{"text":"Disappointing experience and food.  Lettuce was old on the burgers, burgers were charred and food tasted lackluster."}
{"text":"The Streamliner (veggie) burger and Grilled Chicken Breast Sandwich were good, but the shakes are out of this world!!  They stole the show.  I got the Strawberry Banana and my friend got the Orange Dreamsicle! YUM!"}
{"text":"So, I have been to Johnny Rockets many times but I had the best experience here today! The food was made right (as usual) but I want to give a shoutout to one of the workers. His name is Thompson, and he was the best bar attendant I've ever had - extra kind, attentive, efficient, and the way he said everything seemed so genuine. It made my and my mother's day grand!

Bottom line: shoutout to Thompson he gives grade A service!"}
{"text":"Thought I would give this place a try after I saw a great groupon offer. We sat at the bar, as there was no wait for 3 of us. The service was excellent!  Hats off to Thomas, who greeted us with a smile and made sure we were happy with our order. He deserves 5 stars for his service!

I ordered the hamburger with swiss cheese, grilled onions and grilled mushrooms.  It is made to order, however I thought it should have been hotter and came out only luke warm. The bun was grilled, but was a bit greasy and cold. My boyfriend ordered the grilled chicken club and said it was tasty and my son enjoyed the burger he ordered.

The place is clean and a bit over priced, however,  the groupon makes it a great deal. I would come back for a quick lunch, and because the service is very good!"}
{"text":"I got a call from someone that said they were the manager.  They didn't leave a call back number, and said they would try me later.  That was 5 days ago and I haven't heard from them yet.  Got an email from their corporate office that basically stated that the store I visited was a franchise and they were sorry, but basically we aren't doing anyting."}
{"text":"Food is ok for what it is. Price is ok. Service is ok. Fries were warm not hot but ok"}
{"text":"We had good food and very good service.  Cheesy bacon fries were delicious with the perfect amount of bacon and cheese, and every fry was touched by the cheese.  Other places we've gone recently have skimped on the cheese and bacon or only put cheese on some of the fries.  Our burgers were quite good too.  I'/m sure we'll be back."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast here for the first time. Awesome little breakfast sandwiches with your choice of toppings. They also give you a side order of tater tot. We ordered ours extra crispy and loved them very much. They have an employee by the name of Thomas that is beyond outstanding. This guy is going to go places in life!!!!"}
{"text":"This Johnny Rockets is located inside the Flamingo food court. I ordered three different burgers among three friends and we all decided that that the burgers were below our expectations. Each burger was extremely greasy and was dripping in oil. The fries were decent."}
{"text":"Johnny Rockets inside the Silverton is a good option for a quick and inexpensive bite to eat. I like that they stay open later than the other dining options with the exception of the 24/7 Sundance Grill, but there have been instances where I've come by before closing to find them closed, even having asked a few hours prior when they close. I like to eat late, and I'll set my alarm on my phone to be sure to show up 15 minutes before closing, and it stinks when told \"sorry, it just wasn't that busy so we closed early\", which means off to the coffee shop I go, or I have to quickly drive somewhere close by that's also closing soon. Keep in mind I'm usually staying at the Silverton, on vacation, and by 11PM, I've tied one on, so hopping in the car isn't so,etching I can do, and a $10 cab ride to the In and Out a mile away is wasted $$$. 

The food here is okay. The burger isn't anything special and neither are the fries. Just average fast food that's not cooked until you've ordered it, thus guaranteeing it'll be hot. Where Johnny Rocket's does shine is in the milkshake department, and since it's often very late when I'm ready for a snack, a milkshake is a great treat. I haven't explored the fancy shakes as a vanilla malted is a classic shake in my mind, but there are numerous options which look very appealing. 

I wouldn't bother going out of my way to eat here; I guess I actually try to plan my evening so I'm not stuck eating here, but in a pinch it'll do. The shakes, however, are worth it if you are in the mood for a guilty pleasure. Service is perfectly fine, just be sure to check in if you are planning on pushing your visit to right before closing time."}
{"text":"I don't know WHY I am giving it 2 stars...I was so sick shortly after and into the next day.  However we did have great service and that's why I felt I had to give them that.  I had a burger and some tots, it didn't taste too bad but the after effects was the worst!  My daughter, who didn't have a burger, was also having stomach problems.  I think my wife's stomach is made of iron...she was fine.  We wanted something fast since we were seeing a movie and didn't have time for a sit down meal.  So needless to say we won't be trying it out again."}
{"text":"I love Johnny Rockets' food so I was excited to find one inside Excalibur. And I have to say, I was thoroughly pleased! Not only was the food excellent, but the place is clean with great customer service. And when the staff danced, it was the cutest thing ever, I'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"good food and great customer service, thank you, Mark! that chicken bruschetta is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday afternoon for lunch. The lady (pretty sure she is the owner) was SOOO sweet and accommodating to us. Our food came out pretty quick. It was delicious and fresh. There was literally no one in the restaurant, so maybe that's why the service was so good. But nonetheless, very nice experience."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Got all 3 of our orders wrong. Forgot our shakes, had to ask twice for them. The manager there should not have a job, all of the employees seem to have no clue what is going on. On the plus side, the food did taste good, but was overpriced"}
{"text":"Genises did a great job. She was very attentive and always came back to make sure we where good. She is an asset to this establishment. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"The food was exquisite and cannot be topped. My dinning experience was tip-top. HIGHLY recommended"}
{"text":"The service was the worst and the food was horrible. The hot dog appeared as if it was cooked in the microwave.
Hard texture. The burger that my daughter ordered was super dry. Not to mention when the server brought spoons for the shakes she placed them on the table that had yet to be cleaned. When strawberry shake arrived it was ill prepared. The cup had chocolate on it and shake was dripping all over the place. I didn't even finish what I ordered because I was so disgusted with the quality, presentation and service. Take a little pride in food prep."}
{"text":"This has got to be the worst experience yet. We keep giving this place a chance and they disappoint every time. Slow server that acted like his job was a burden. Slow kitchen, burgers came out 20 min later comes the tots trio. The place wasn't even busy. Never again."}
{"text":"While I love Johnny Rockets in general, its really not the same when they don't have chili cheese fries. I mean, that's what makes Johnny Rockets! I actually spoke with one of the employees who said it was the franchise owners decision to stop serving chili. BIG MISTAKE! Without that, they are just a burger place, and personally I'd rather go to shake shack for the burgers."}
{"text":"Wish I could give no stars! Whomever is managing this Johnny Rockets needs a wake up call! The service is the worst I have ever experienced. Waited to be seated in an empty restaurant. Only to watch two severs fight over taking our table because neither one wanted to take it. Snail paced service, half the menu items \"unavailable\". Needs to step up if they want to continue to exist in this location. Needless to say I won't be back and will take my business to Humble Pie next time we want to go out after a trip to the aquarium."}
{"text":"breakfast 24/7 is such a great idea! i love the tots they are so good here. ive been to many johnny rockets and this one is kinda slow, but hey showing up wasted or starving at 130 am is what you gotta deal with."}
{"text":"Great burger restaurant. Since I enjoyed that place so much, I must say this deserves five stars because I never get enough of Johnny Rockets burgers."}
{"text":"I will never understand why people visit Vegas and eat at chain restaurants. But I guess if you gamble all of your money away, this food court is probably your best option for feeding yourself. BF has a soft spot for this chain, which is why we ended up here.

All the burgers are consistently good, I usually opt for the Original (cheese is extra) or the Route 66 (mushroom Swiss). BF always has to have the chili cheese fries with white onion added, but I personally favor just cheese on mine. 

Dine at the counter for best service, they also offer walk-up service. After you order, whip out your phone and purchase the half-off Groupon for $6 off $12."}
{"text":"Johnny Rockets has always been one of my favorite burger restaurants. The onion rings here are DELICIOUS. The burgers on the other hand are not as good as they used to be and it seems to be caused by the different bread that they use now. Regardless of anything I still recommend Johnny and will eat here again soon."}
{"text":"They seated us very quickly at the bar. Gave use are drinks, but then forgot about us where about to leave when the hostess came to check on us and took care of us herself making the experience much better than it would of bin. The guy making our shake spoke with us as he made our shake and even put the shake in a to go cup for us. Food was dilivered hot and was delicious."}
{"text":"Horrible service! This place is incredibly unorganized, with very poor management. Waitress ignored us for 15 min, drinks took an additional 10 more minutes then our order was messed up. My daughter did not receive her food and the waitresses excuse for it was that it was sent to another table on accident, meanwhile that table had already left, due to how long it was taking for food to get out. I had to flag down the manager who did not care to make anything better, she seemed irritated that I asked for them to remake my daughter's food. She never apologized or even offered to take it off of the bill. I would steer clear of this location until corporate manages to clean it up."}
{"text":"Damn - I did not check Yelp before going in.  How could I be so stupid?

Went in since we had some time before a show started.

Ordered two milkshakes and some bacon cheese fries to share.  

I won't mention the milkshake, because the review from Kanwar S. already covers it.  A small shake that comes with the steel cup with about 50ml more in it.  Too expensive.  Quality of shake adequate.  Value not there.  Quantity not there.

Bacon cheese fries.  I'm not sure if the bacon was real or not.  Cheese was this disgusting process squirt cheese on mediocre fries.  Two of us barely ate half of them.

I think I just ate them out of boredom and because they were sitting in front of me.

So they did ask 'still working on those?' and 'are you done?' and 'want us to pack those up?'  but I'd suggest \"Are these any good?\" or  \"You seem to have trouble keeping those fries down?\"  But I'm guessing the look we had on our faces was about par for the course and they didn't want to open up the can of worms by asking about the food.  Really, by that point, I couldn't care less.

Anyhow, $28 for that meal.

Another reason to say 'Check Yelp BEFORE entering.\"

And now I will have a new question to ask restaurants. \"It says cheese on the menu. Do you actually mean cheese or is it that squirt diarrhea like cheese?\"

So long Johnny Rockets on my last visit!"}
{"text":"Went there after going to the movies at AMC Westgate. It took them FOREVER to bring our food to us, and they were not very busy and there were a lot of people allegedly 'working' so I cannot fathom why it would take such an insanely long time for them to cook and bring out 2 kids meals and 2 burgers. 

My iced tea tasted really funny, like they never cleaned the crock they keep it in. My burger had a looong hair in it, and when we complained they only took 10% off the bill. And today we are all feeling rather ill. Never going back."}
{"text":"For the last few weeks I have found myself at the Meadows Mall helping a friend find clothes, but I've never found myself to be so hungry as to eat mall food, until I saw that there is a Johnny Rockets here. 

My friend and I sat at the counter, and it took a minute to order since the waiters were in the middle of dancing! And even with my starvation, I was able to be amused enough by their rendition of Stayin' Alive to wait. When you sit here to eat you get lunch AND a show!

The main reason I love Johnny Rockets is because they are totally vegan friendly. I got the Streamliner with a Boca patty, and I added grilled mushrooms. SO tasty! Definitely hit the spot. I love that you can substitute whole what buns and Boca patties for any of the burgers. My friend had an egg salad sandwich with a side salad, and she raved about the egg sandwich. 

If you're in the mall craving something tasty with a restaurant-feel, this is definitely the place to go. Their menu will satisfy anyone's stomach, and the convenience of it being in the mall is great."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this place is under new management but last time I was here everything was great but not last night. The place felt sticky, dirty, and cheap. They served me coffee in a styrofoam cup and their food standards went down. My husband and I got very sick from their oily food. One thing is for sure, hubby and I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"Worst Johnny Rockets I've ever been to...
Got my order wrong 3 times. 
Ordered a veggie burger with lettuce and tomatoes only, thing comes out with onions. Not a big deal... 
Try to get it fixed, the burger is returned with a beef patty, haha oh so that's not right again. 
Try to get it fixed again, it's returned with everything on it.. Like What in the fuck?!
Is it that do hard? 
After that last try I gave up and tried to get my money back. 
Not to mention everything took over 30 minutes and another 20 during the mix ups. 

I understand that nights can be stressful, and working in the food industry sucks trust me I work in it, but its really not that hard even if you are given 3 tries."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch after Dolphinaris. Server, Courtney, was great. Burgers were good. Loaded tots were excellent. Nice no fuss lunch stop."}
{"text":"Food is average. You know what you are going to get at each location. A little pricey for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Ate here right after the ufc fight between amanda nunez and ronda rousey the service was pretty good and the people here were friendly but the price for what I got which was a hamburger and fries and a soda was ridiculous as I spent close to 12 or 15 dollars on that I thought that was pretty ridiculous to pay that much for a small burger and a few things of fries even in n out despite me not being a fan of them give you a decent sized portion for what you pay for and when I went to get a soda from the soda machine the soda I got was watered down as a matter of fact half of the sodas were watered down it was disgusting other then that my food was good but with the small portions and ridiculous prices and watered down sodas I don't think I will make a stop here again."}
{"text":"had a free burger coupon. I had the smoke house burger double with a ranch bbq sauce with a big huge onion ring on top.   it was excellent.  my friend had bbq double with bacon, lettuce, tomatoe.  we split and shared both were excellent.  french fries were very good I always order extra crispy.  Our server was Tawnee she was fantastic on top of our order to make sure it was how we wanted it.  Tawnee  even got use to go drinks since it was so hot outside.  recommend and ask for tawnee."}
{"text":"Great service! Calvin was amazing and provided the best customer service. We ate at the counter and we were able to observe how he also provide them with great service. They at open later than all the other food court places which is a plus! Not to mention their food is great!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVED my experience at this Johnny Rocket's location (or is this the only one here in Toronto?) After my haircut, my bf and I decided to eat here...I was feeling like some burgers and I saw all those empty booths...

Intro. We were told we could pick anyyy seat in the restaurant, so I immediately skipped to the booth next to the window's...with its great view of Eaton Center and Dundas Square. Our server promptly came to us and took our orders. We both ordered burgers and I had a Mill Creek Beer.

Food. My burger was very good, and it could have been because I was hungry, but beer and burger can be no better combination. I was full afterwards, but we still had enough room for Red Velvet Cake which OMG was so moist. I am not sure if it was their cake special, or on their menu, but you MUST try this cake. 

Service. Our waiter was so charming and attentive (but not creepily so). He had this Scottish accent, he did the smiley face on a plate with ketchup for us (which is something so simple but I LOVED!), grabbed us two forks to share the cake, and asked if we wanted drinks when he noticed our cups were empty. :):):):)

All together, my first experience at Johnny Rockets was great. It could be because we came on a Wednesday night at 5:30, so we didn't have to deal with the Saturday crowds which I can only imagine to be a zoo in this area. But, it is a great mid-week restaurant if you're craving for some comfort foods."}
{"text":"Heading to Dundas, tired from a long day of classes at Ryerson, or just want a 50's dining experience? Look no further, Johnny Rockets is your place! This place is a true tribute to the 50's diner persona. The ambiance, staff, and interior perfectly mimic that persona. However it doesn't stop there, the menu reflects that feel as well. The menu is riddled with milkshakes, brownies, burgers, and fries. And do take my word when I say the burgers and milkshakes are AMAZING! Specifically the peanut butter milkshake is the one of the best I have ever had! Service too is great, it seems every waiter has an interesting accent. They are nice, quick, and put commendable effort in being a 50's waiter. The only downsides is that seating for big groups is uncomfortable and it can get loud. All in all,  this place is a must if visiting Dundas, a true gem!!!"}
{"text":"If you are a bit inebriated, it's late, you don't care about food quality or price and you just want maximum greasiness with your alcohol antidote burger and fries, this is the spot. Otherwise, I'd recommend avoiding when you have your senses and taste buds with you and fully functioning."}
{"text":"My first time at a Johnny Rockets, and my last. We stopped in for a quick lunch. My friends both ordered burgers and fries. I ordered a salad.

The salad was supposed to be made with spring mix. Instead it was only red and green tango lettuce, one of the ingredients in spring mix. I had to look it up to figure out what they made the salad with since it was obviously not spring mix. There was a tiny amount of diced tomatoes. The only redeeming thing about the salad was the grilled chicken. It was moist and flavorful. So, I ate the chicken. Not much of a lunch and certainly not worth almost $9.

Our server did a fair job, but never cracked a smile. When I pointed out that the salad was not made of spring mix, he had no response. 

My friends liked the burgers and fries. For that I'll give two stars, but they dropped the ball and lost a potential customer with the salad."}
{"text":"I had to come here to try out the burger for sure. The 60s/Retro themed décor is a nice touch and makes the place seem very inviting. Just go in and sit wherever, and each table gets its own song selection thingamagjig for the jukebox. Never really tried it though. 

I can't really diss this place as I've come to realize it's more of a kids spot more than anything. It'll be like me giving a bad review to Alvin and the chipmunks because I didn't enjoy it. The food isn't bad, isn't good, but I doubt this is the main reason people visit."}
{"text":"We spotted this Johhny Rockets after spending some time in Flamingo's casino! It is located in a small \"food court\" on the side near the slot machines! It was the only food place open in the food court at the time so we decided to eat here!

FOODS
--------------------

- Onion Rings - REALLY good!
- Regular Fries - Good
- Chicken Wings - Yuck.....
I honestly don't know how they messed up the wings, but it didn't taste good.


SERVICE
--------------------

I was surprised at how long it took for them to prepare food! It was past 2AM when we went and it still took long! Other customers were visibly getting impatient as well. 

Overall, it's a good place to grab some late night munchies! They are open late and because it is located in a food court, there are plenty of tables to dine at. Come here if you don't mind waiting long for fast food!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and food! Had a Groupon and was excited since we like Johnny Rockets.  No one moves with a purpose there. After waiting to be seated which took forever decided to go to the kids area right next door because it took so long. After the kids played went back and was seated. Ordered a $15 Squealer and a kids hamburger combo. When the food finally came out the Squealer was the same size as the kids burger and just as over cooked. Sent back the squealer and all they did was stack another patty in the burger and added a tomato. Really! At least remake the whole burger. Was completely unsatisfied with the whole experience but on a positive note the location is ideal since it is in the mall."}
{"text":"Friend ordered at 2:34pm. About 10 people total including us in the restaurant. After 40 minutes, decided to check on food. Realized 3 other people were waiting 45 minutes. Workers didnt even acknowledge or talk to me at the counter so i sat down. 5 minutes later, I got my burger without the sauce on the side I ordered and cold fries. My friend still had no food. After 10 minutes waiting at the counter behind 2 other people complaining of cold food or no food, I was spoken to. I was nice about it. Then I got my sauce and ate the burger before it got cold. After 58 minutes total waiting, my friend got his chicken tenders and fries. I also received my fries. No one apologized nor checked to see if the food was okay. Total service time was 58 minutes and it was not even busy. They also had a good amount of staff working. I managed a corporate McDonald's for 4 yrs in college, there is no reason besides pure lazyness and indifference for this experience. NEVER EAT HERE! Tried to submit post with no stars, but it's not allowed."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the service was horrible. Really the worst service that I have ever experienced, ever. It took awhile for my group to be seated, and it was only the 3 of us. Our server seemed to have the worst attitude ever, and she had a supervisor name tag on, I would have never expected for a supervisor to to give the worst customer service, but after her being our server, I will never eat at this location again. She didn't check on my party. She was rude with the nastiest attitude during our entire time there. And we seriously had to ask other employees for refills and Togo items because apparently our server decide to go to the back for what might have been our entire time eating there, and only came to run our card. This really was the worst and I really mea THE WORST SERVICE EVER!!!"}
{"text":"We went here today. Monday 11/14 for dinner 6:45pm. The food was great... They have fast service... great customer service. and our server is Mariel she was very good and polite. We are definitely coming back... the grilled cheese was soooo delicious... thank you!"}
{"text":"Thomas is the best server I've had in a while. He's always checking up on you and making sure everything is okay. The food was amazing I would totally recommend it and make sure Thomas is helping you out ! :)"}
{"text":"Nous voulions des Burgers, nous avons été servi ! Ils sont juste énormes ! Ils sont bons, et très copieux ! Pain brioché, Steak, fromage, bacon, salade tout y est ainsi que le goût. Pas saturé ni en gras ni en sel ! Les frites sont très bonnes. 
Mais ce n'est cependant pas le meilleur Hamburger que nous ayons mangé durant notre séjour à Vegas."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today and there wasn't much that stood out.  It's right next to the Chandler Mall Harkins, so we decided to stop by.  The burger I ordered was good enough (the classic) but the fries were sub-par and were limp, un-salted, and flavorless.  My sister's swiss-mushroom burger was super greasy (the bun was soaked and dripping wiith grease)... looked gross.  Their chocolate milkshake we all shared, we agreed, was tasty and thick...

It was OK for me.. nothing that was special or unique eating here for me."}
{"text":"So their menu has changed. I used to get the streamliner burger which had a Boca patty. They don't have that on the menu anymore. Now you have to order one of the regular burgers and ASK to substitute with a Boca or turkey patty. Fine. I ordered a classic burger, substituted the meat patty for a Boca patty. When my food came the patty was light colored and resembled a turkey burger. I told the waitress who alerted the chef who insisted that it was not a turkey burger. Boca patties are pretty distinguishable. A light gray patty is more than likely a turkey patty. They remade me a different burger and the moment I took a bite it fell apart. It was their new bun! They now serve very thick split top buns which break in half the moment you pick up the burger. The only reason I am giving this place three stars is because the manager just came over and discounted my bill significantly. Not everybody likes the changes you've made Johnny Rockets. I will not be back because the food isn't awesome like it used to be."}
{"text":"Food was great and our server Edward was awesome and a sweetheart but they had gnats inside the restaurant"}
{"text":"Big shout out to Karli! Big smile, so friendly and not at all pushy. We had stopped in before heading to the movies for a quick snack. Got milkshakes,  fries and a root beer float. I was sharing a milkshake with my daughter and Karli asked if she could split it for us! Might sound like a small thing but for us it just showed that she was being proactive and thoughtful. Then the icing on the cake - or the ketchup on the plate - was that she actually took the time to make little designs on ketchup plates for each of us for our fries - there were 4 in our party. Rest of the staff was very pleasant too but Karli rocked!  Thank you!"}
{"text":"Well, I specifically visited Johnny Rockets at the Aliante because I was in the area and craving a diet cherry cola. I should have just gone to Sonic and saved my money.

For a little under $16, I purchased a chicken club, onion ring/fries combo, and a diet cherry cola. The chicken was cooked fine but the bacon was burned (rather than crispy) and the sandwich was just a bit tasteless. I had the same tastelessness with the onion rings & fries. There was definitely a lack of seasoning. As for the diet cherry cola that I was craving - what an utter disappointment. I actually had them add extra cherry and still could not taste it. Needless to say, my lunch was not worth the money I spent and I will not be returning to Johnny Rockets.

I can tell you that TGI Fridays makes an excellent diet cherry coke. Too bad I have not been able to find a location with adequate service."}
{"text":"I went here because everything else in this food court I hadn't heard of before. I ordered just a classic cheeseburger and seriously I swear my cheeseburger was ran over"}
{"text":"My family and I have been fog to Jonnys for almost 6years. This past Sunday upon arriving u was told that they would be closing in 10 min. The gal reminded me after she brought the Menus that they would be closing in 10 min. The waitress that was going to take my order also told me that they would be closing in 10 min.? Very poor service or lack of service. They have lost my future business for sure."}
{"text":"Needed a late night foodie spot while in Vegas but didn't wanna do anything extravagant and was too hot out to really walk around to look for a good food spot. Thankfully Johnny Rockets which was located at the lower level of my hotel at Bally's during this stay in Vegas provided. An order of chicken tenders and fries was enough to do justice for a late night food urge before turning in on a very hot Vegas night."}
{"text":"We were waited on by Thomas- great waiter. Very friendly, attentive and fast paced. The food was good, but it's not like the original Johnny Rockets because I didn't see chili fries or onion rings on the menu and the milkshakes are pre-made (but are still very good) and didn't have the same dinner feel as others. The special sauce on the burgers is a must."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly, and we received our food quick. This place was pretty awesome to sober up from all the drinking and gambling. I got really full off of the chili cheese fries, it can definitely be shared between 2 or 3 people as an appetizer."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch on my fiance's birthday 09/19/11. The waiter wasn't even friendly to begin with. I asked what was good on their menu and healthy, since I'm eating for two. He recommended a chicken, bacon, and iceberg salad and I had asked for ranch dressing on the side. My finance a double onion ring, bacon burger, along with a sundae that would be free for his birthday the waiter informed us.
We asked if our fries could be brought out first and he was going to charge us twice if he did. We thought he was joking, he wasn't. It took 20 minutes for our food to be brought out, and they weren't even right. He ended up with a single patty burger with just onion rings, and my salad with no dressing neither on the side or salad. We called him over and he said he'd bring out the right food. He didn't even take back the food he had brought out.
So ten minutes pass and all he brings back is ranch dressing.
My fiance had told me he had liked this place, but was very disappointed on how everything was going now at this place. It was my first and final time here.
I'm only giving it one star because we talked to the manger and he apologized on the waiters mistakes. He took off my salad since I didn't touch it and the extra charge of fries, since to begin with that they are all you can eat fries, but charged for my finance's burger. The total still came out to rounded up $18, for his burger, two fries, two drinks, and we never received our sundae.
I am very disappointed in this place. It was just us and three other couples in there that afternoon, so I can't even say it was crappy because it was busy."}
{"text":"Decent burgers and fries, but since it is on the Strip, it was way overpriced. The service at this location is also very slow during peak hours (12:00 noon - lunch hour) and it looks like they need more staffing."}
{"text":"Good food and great service. Waitress was friendly and we got our food very quickly and hot! Other than the prices I love everything about this place. I tried the a1 burger and that was delicious. I would definitely go again"}
{"text":"3.5 stars 

This location is in the Meadows Mall. I purchased a $6 for $12 groupon which ended up making me feel better because I wouldn't pay regular price...ever.

The menu at this location is limited so don't expect the regular JR menu if you want to eat at this one. I ordered a rocket double without lettuce or tomato and fries. I really enjoyed my burger and fries. They were both made fresh to order. My total was $12.92 for just the burger and fries, no drink. That is too steep on the wallet if paying full price and not even getting a drink. With a coupon I would come back again.

There is a counter if you want to eat at JR or you can sit in the food court."}
{"text":"Mediocre food and service.  We walked over to several restaurants that night and every them had a wait time except for this one.  My kids were super hungry so we had to eat here.  I'd been to a couple of other Johnny Rockets locations before and think they are OK. Yeah, this was just below OK."}
{"text":"I didn't stop here because either of us were hungry, but mainly because I've never seen the place and I just wanted to give it a try. We ended up only ordering strawberry milkshake, but had the service been better, then we would have gotten a meal to split. Obviously I can't say anything on the quality of the food, but just based off the poor customer service that we received....I wouldn't recommend the place. I mean if you're in Vegas In-and-Out is more of the go to place anyhow. But boys please don't be so rude and dismissing to your paying customers."}
{"text":"After we finished going through the Shark Reef Aquarium, the boyfriend and I were starving and the food court was right outside, so we figured why not. I was craving a fat burger, so I opted for an order of fries and a Smokehouse burger from Johnny Rockets, and oh. My. GOODNESS. Soooo smack. Smoked bacon, sourdough onion rings, cheddar cheese, barbecue ranch sauce...What more could you ever ask for in a burger? I don't even like bacon, but I happily scarfed this down with zero regrets. The fries hit the spot as well. Only negative is, my food came out warm, not hot."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times, and I've enjoyed my food every single time.

The food is consistently very good.  

The wait staff is pretty cool and they are very friendly towards my children.

This is a good place to go when you're in the mood for a burger that's better than the fast food chains' and less expensive than Red Robin's."}
{"text":"We bought 3 burgers and fries for 3 of us. The french fry bags were less than 75% full. One person could of ate all the fries for 3 people. I paid almost 40 dollars for 3 meals without drinks and I can't even get full orders of fries!! Potatoes are not expensive to give the customers a decent meal for the ridiculous price. FIVE GUYS will be getting my burger and fry buisness from now on, they fill a big bag of fries for you!!! Burgers were good, but why pay premium prices for small portions!!"}
{"text":"Interesting concept here at Johnny Rockets.  Send out the fries and onions rings as an appetizer instead of as the side dish to your burger and then send the burgers out 30 minutes after that.  I'm not sure how it's possible to burn half an order of onion rings while the other half comes out raw but they managed it here (as the pic shows).  Then, the minute one clears the last fry off one's plate, the waiter appears to whisk the plate away. I was thinking.....\"hey, what if I wanted to like the grease and salt off of that plate?!?!?!\" (Not really, lol)  If they were as quick to serve their burgers as they were to clear the plates, this place would be awesome.

The only redeeming quality to this visit was the waiter.  As it was, we won't come back.  We arrived hungry and just wanted a \"quick\" bite while shopping and a wide cushy seat to rest my weary.....wallet!   Not an hour long meal, then when the burgers did arrived, to be rushed out the door so we can't even enjoy the burger.  Seriously, they were trying to box up burgers while my kids were halfway done.  NOT COOL!!!!  Next time we are at this mall, I'll skip round two and go for a truly quick bite at the food court where no one rushes your kids to eat their food.  Back to school shopping isn't the funnest chore but Johnny Rockets made this mama bear even crankier by pulling that crap.  I want the burger and fries together.  I want the food cooked correctly.  And I don't want my food boxed up while I'm still eatting it.  Pretty simple requests, right?"}
{"text":"Here is a quick review for the Johnny Rockets we went to on Saturday.  If you want to read long drawn out reviews.  Read about Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov.  My review will be quick and to the point.  
We stopped by here after a morning at the range.  My little sister wanted to try it so I did.  She ordered a turkey burger.  I ordered a burger with two patties.  Her daughter ordered chicken strips.  The burger was good.  The fries were good too.  My sister liked the turkey burger also.  This place is good.  Worth a shot."}
{"text":"I have always enjoyed the old malt shop feel at the themed burger restaurants. Ruby's, Fatburger (although not that themed) and Johnny Rockets. The first and last are more restaurants then fast food however. 

I have recently visited the Johnny Rocket's across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel and like always, I thoroughly enjoyed my time. However, as some posters have stated, you do pay a premium for the atmosphere. This is not a \"quick and cheap\" burger like McDonald's, but more of an experience. Something you may only do once every two months. 

The woman that helped me was kind and courteous and I wish I could remember her name. She was quick and attentive and on top of her game when it came to refilling my drink. My last go at the eatery was a Chicken Club Sandwich, with 1/2 and 1/2 fries and onion rings. Splitting the rings and fries is great, but I sometimes wish I had more rings, so maybe next time, I will get the rings alone. 

I have also noticed some new menu items (at least new to me). One of these items is a cobb salad and I can see that as a big seller if people aren't interesting in eating red meat (or turkey burgers). 

Overall, I have a good experience with Johnny Rocket's and I will continue to go there in the future."}
{"text":"horrible customer service....not like anyone here cares.  no combo...just say yes instead of \"no combos here\" rudely.   everyone wants a come...price it accordingly =good business.  I'll never come here again unless management   contacts me to discuss

update pending contact!

can't believe the poor customer interaction of this place 30 bucks for a couple burgers, one fry, and 1 soda.....and shitty service...what a shame."}
{"text":"I have to write a review in hopes of saving someone from a terrible meal and annoying employees. I have given this location a few chances and each time I'm very disappointed. The staff (especially the cooks) are extremely obnoxious. My family and I got to listen to them be loud, swear and be very unprofessional throughout our meal. My young children got to listen to them swear. The wait was ridiculous to get our food. Probably because the staff were too busy talking and acting like drunk idiots. Then the food came out and it was cold and hard. My husband said his cheeseburger was good but my grilled cheese was hard and gross. My Coke was carbonated water. My shake was good though. 
I will not be returning again because after several attempts and hoping it would get better it has gotten worse and worse. If you want to go and be in front of drunk idiots serving food that is cold and hard as rock then please come here."}
{"text":"The food is good and service is great however they get more and more expensive each time... you have to buy everything seperated they don't have combos anymore and now they are charging  $1 to add cheese wtf?? Like the food but I'm not paying $15 for frys and a burger anymore #byefelicia"}
{"text":"JR's is conveniently located inside the Aliante, we all visited with an Amazon local deal.  I have no idea what the deal was as it was the GF's but I do know this was one of the only locations we could use it at.  

Located in what is probably the cleanest food court I have ever seen, I set about to see what tasty artery clogging there were to devour.  This classic American eats is located inside the ultra-chic Aliante Casino.

The burgers were A-OK, as were the fries.  The highlight was the apple pie shake."}
{"text":"The worst experience in recent memory...paid 20 for the most horrible, unpalatable sandwich here...done with Johnny Rockets..total crap!"}
{"text":"Good burger joint. Being on the strip it may seem to be expensive but when you see the other food places, it's comparable. 
Good choices for burgers from beef to veggie with chicken in between. 
It's a must especially when you can get a groupon worth $12 for $6. 
Check it out!!

{"text":"To be honest about it, I have not received my food but for two people, two burgers and two fries and two waters was $37.  And I had to serve myself. Not very likely I will return here on my next visit."}
{"text":"I should have walked a bit further some more bad mall food.

The food is reminiscent of Denny's burgers. Actually, I take that back, Denny's is probably better. It was nothing spectacular but what made my experience and EWWW was that I opted for a seat at the counter, where I could watch the food being prepared. Bad idea.

Everything was dipped in butter before hitting the hot griddle also, I couldn't help but notice the filthy supposed-to-be-white uniforms everyone was wearing. Inmates have cleaner clothes.

Because this was in a mall, it was extremely busy and it took a while before the food made its way to us and even getting a refill was difficult. 

I do like the 50s music and liked singing along obnoxiously. I felt bad for the servers when they had to dance/perform for the patrons. You could tell that they hated it and it was not worth the $3/hr to work here."}
{"text":"The hamburger was okay.It was a bit greasy and hard at the edges. The fries were dirty you could taste the oil on them and its time to change it. The beverages were good. The butterfinger shake made the meal. It was creamy and thick. It tasted great. Hopefully the rest of the food will rise to that standard."}
{"text":"I tried a Johnny Rockets for the first time while at the Aliante Stations Casino. I guess I would just have to give it an OK. The bun was dry and crumbling apart as I ate. As for the burger itself there was nothing special about it. There is a lot of competiton in the area of fast food burgers, and for me there are better choices to be be made."}
{"text":"Went to have a lunch yesterday as i had the rare occasion of getting off early.  Had not been to this location in about 2 months as my last visit was depressing.  So many new faces and even some of the old ones seemed to have a new joy in them.  Service was amazing fast and professional.  Regularly was asked if i was ok or needed a refill on my lemonade.  Clearly things have changed for the better and i look forward to my next lunch adventure.    Now if counter service had been available this visit would have been perfect."}
{"text":"I give this place 2 stars because for the same price you can get better burgers somewhere else. The fries are very good though, and the onion rings are meh....  Also tried the chicken tenders.... not to great. I have been here many times with friends. My wife use to work there when we started dating and I know a supervisor there that I went to high school with. Depending on who you get sometimes it can take very long before you get your food, and for them to check up on you. I made a complaint once to the manager about a girl that never checked up on us and all he did is say... \"so what do you want me to do\" then stared. It's not like I was being an ass about it... I can understand he might have been tired as the place can get very busy but that is no reason for a manager.

Besides the food and service not being that great... the dancing is pretty funny to see, and I'm a sucker for the 50's era. The place just looks cool."}
{"text":"We went here for a quick snack and got a vanilla milkshake and a side of fries. The fries were a good portion for one person, and the milkshake wasn't as thick as we normally know Johnny Rockets for. The service was good.

Other than that this Johnny Rockets is the only place in the food court that's open 24/7, there's nothing special."}
{"text":"I was going to write all kinds of great things about my server and the manager and the food ... but I completely forgot to finish this. So I'll just say it was great!"}
{"text":"Best burgers and fries!  Love the ambience, the servers and of course, the shakes!  This was the first time I took my 7 year old daughter and she loved sitting at the counter.   A bit spendy for a burger joint but all around good food."}
{"text":"ehh always disapointed when I come here so why? I was in the mood for a burger and it was there.  It is located in the Luxor food court.  There are so many in the LV area so not sure I chose the right one.  

Anyway, I ordered the classic thinking that is what it is.. a classic burger.  No it is a meat patty with ketchup and onions.  I had to go back and ask for lettuce and tomato.  Lady looked at me weird and I felt for a moment she was going to charge me for it but she didn't. Service is lacking for sure.  

Burger has no taste and the fries are nothing special.  For the price you'd hope for a little better but nope it was as bland as I remembered them being."}
{"text":"Yelp 365 Challenge: Review 013/365 (8/13/2011)

My friend reallyreallyreally wanted to check out UNDFTD during our last trip.  Since it was lunch time by the time we got there, we walked just a few feet away to Johnny Rockets, located in the same strip mall.

It was my first time eating here.  If I recall correctly, we were the only customers, but our waiter was polite and efficient during the entire meal.  I ordered a Coke with the chocolate flavor shot and a tuna melt sandwich (I don't eat hamburgers).  The Coke was interesting in concept, but the chocolate was only obvious (to both my friend and I) as an aftertaste.  The tuna melt was edible but extremely small.  I also tried the onion rings/french fries combo that my friend ordered.  Both of them were decent.

On a completely different note (and to no fault of any of the employees), the 50s music started to drive me crazy about halfway through the meal.  By the end of our visit though, seeing the pretty cheap tab that I needed to pay (for the both of us) more than made up for any of the audial \"dislike\" I had experienced just a short while before.

Three stars for JR - it's definitely not my favorite fast food in LV, but it's definitely not the worst."}
{"text":"The young guy Tom that waited on us was great respectful curteous and food was great."}
{"text":"Tried to go before the game today and was rudely ignored.  Why I even bother with here I don't know. We left without even being seated. The had their limited over priced menu too."}
{"text":"We came in here for a good late night meal. But they were so slow getting us seated and serving food. We waited a total of 1.5 hours to get seated and another 1.5 to get our food. Waiters are so worried about their cellphones and each other. They just gather around and talk. They do not care at all if the food is being served or not. Despite many waiters sitting around, foods are not being served. Horrible place to dine at..."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch break at fashion show mall, or if you're looking for something to satisfy that hamburger craving. The staff was welcoming and friendly, there were a lot of great options on the menu. I ordered just the plain burger and added carmelized onions. I also got a side of tater tots, which i feel is a novelty these days.  Sometimes you just don't want fries ya know? The burgers were quite pricey for what you get, however I can see why Quality Meat deserves that price point. They were perfectly cooked"}
{"text":"1. TERRIBLE SERVICE: the waitress never checked on us because she was busy talking to a group of guys sitting at the counter, the same guy (manager?) Cooked the food, bussed the tables, and took orders at the counter.
2.DIRTY: luckily I didn't visit the restroom til after lunch, because I almost lost my lunch in there from the filth that covered every square inch of it. The table and menus even smelled of old mildew water.  
3. LET'S MAKE UP EXTRA FEES: they charged me extra for CHEESE on a GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH. When I asked her about it, she confirmed with the manager that \"yes, we charge extra for American cheese\" even though it was a listed choice on the menu.  Again, not EXTRA cheese, she charged me for cheese being on a cheese sandwich.  WHAT THE WHAT??!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here a couple of days ago, service was slow (at the register) had to wait a while longer for our food, but it was absolutely delicious.  We never received our onion rings (they said they'd bring them out). We finished our meal.  The manager gave us a note to bring back for a free onion ring AND a free meal.  We just stopped in and they compt our entire lunch (we only ordered 2 burgers, 1 onion rings and ice water).. We're very pleased with the way they took care of us!!  Now it's time to dig in!"}
{"text":"I was happy with this little place ,we had lunch a burger sandwich and sourdough coated onion rings.My wife had a coke float served with pepsi it was massive (tortelloni size) they give you 2 glasses it,s so big!Nice change of pace a diner in a casino"}
{"text":"Super impressed with this restaurant! When we visit Vegas - we always see Thomas. He is the definition of what customer service should be! He is very friendly, efficient & you get your order in a very timely manner. Ask for Thomas when you visit! It's conveniently inside Bally's food court - the pool would be downstairs from there. You won't be disappointed! :)"}
{"text":"This place is filthy.  Flies all over, tables, food, drink stations. The temperature is over 80. Staff is slow and unfriendly.  Never will I waste my money on such greasy, nasty food in a filthy establishment."}
{"text":"Our waitress (crystal 1022) was great. We were a little picky with what we wanted but she remembered it exactly!  The food was good and the shake was awesome!  Will most definitely will come back."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous. Food is good  but Waited 35 minutes for a TO GO  order. They were not even busy and they all act like it's normal for a burger to take this long. .. go somewhere else for faster service ."}
{"text":"I was at Arrowhead Mall and thought I would have a Hamberger from Johnny Rockets since it has been a while since I had. I remembered the freshness and could not wait. What a disappointment, they now smash the burger to a quarter inch thickness. After it was cooked and served, the edges were paper thing and actually crispy. Johnny you went from great to very poor at best, what happened?"}
{"text":"Awesome! Marley my waitress suggested the philly steak. Ohmygosh. It was SO tender. I had a ball. The staff danced to the song Rockin' Robin. I'll upload if I can. I had THE BEST food and THE BEST time. I left with a full, satisfied tummy. And a huge grin from the FUN! Taking my friends oct 1."}
{"text":"This was a horrible experience compared to the amazing location at Westgate. We waited 10 mins to be seated and then about 45 minutes to receive our food. When we finally received our food, we received toasty burnt patties so not a satisfying meal even after all the wait. The waiter was great, very attenrive. If you want rockets experience I suggest try the one at Westgate."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying Johnny rockets. The price is a little high but you get what you pay for. The burger size and taste was perfect, definitely filling. There burgers are way better than any other fast food place including In N Out.  I also order chili cheese fries.  If you had Weinerschnizel, there fries are comparable. In addition, the service was good. Nice friendly, employees. If you dine in, they do a little singing entertainment."}
{"text":"I haven't been to a Jonny rockets since I was a kid. This specific location is relatively new and very well kept. For a \"fast food\" burger joint it was so fresh and yummy. The woman working the counter was very considerate and nice. Half way through my meal she stepped away from the counter to ask my about my experience. Talk about going above and beyond."}
{"text":"I've tried to eat here three times, and only managed to actually get a meal delivered once.

The other two times, I walked in, sat at the counter and couldn't make eye-contact with a server.  They appeared to be too busy to get around to taking my order.  After a 10 minute wait, I left."}
{"text":"I got a call from the manager and she apologized for the problems I had on my visit and told me it was not there policy to serve cold fries and the wait time should have not been longer than 15 minutes. She wanted me to give them another chance and sent me a gift certificate, I hope I have a better experience. Thank you"}
{"text":"Came into to Johnny Rockets for the first time the other night.. Sad to say, but this will be the last time I come in here. My boyfriend ordered the smokehouse double and the beef patty had no taste whatsoever. Completely bland as if the cook did not season it or salt it. I ordered the bbq chicken melt and the bacon cheese fries, and quite frankly it tasted so plain and boring.. As if I could've concocted something better at home.. Needless to say the shakes were the best thing. Ordered the strawberry Oreo crumble and it was just the right consistency, had Oreo chunks that weren't too big or too small, and the sweetness of the strawberries were just right.. If anything, I will only be back to order one of their deluxe shakes.. Not their famous burgers.."}
{"text":"I give this place a one star due to the bad service and I feel it it the fault of upper management. I went to this location on a Saturday night around 8:30, the restaurant was busy but not packed waiting about 10 minutes before someone came over i noticed that there were only two cooks and two people serving, taking orders, and working the front counter. We placed our drink order then waited and waited. 25 minutes after we arrived we finally got some of our drinks except for the shake the waiter forgot about. Food arrived and it was good but cannot get over the fact that there only was four people working. Several tables around me were also complaining about the service. Management of this location: read these comments and other from other patrons, you Will find that everyone thinks your service sucks! Staff your restaurant accordingly. This was the third time I have been there and service is always the same. I will not be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Service was not good. We were the only ones in the restaurant at the time but the waitress still didn't have time for us. She was constantly texting on her phone, busy making a sandwich for herself and chatting with the cook. I had to wait ten minutes for a glass of water and my wife had to go to the counter to request a refill of her drink. To make matters worse the food was not fresh. Burger was soggy and Rocket Appetizer Trio was atrocious - not fresh and it tasted like stale food that was left in the freezer for too long."}
{"text":"Let's be frank about this restaurant. It's in an amazing location. It's Westgate, for heaven's sake! There's always something going on at Westgate! The Cardinals and the Coyotes play there. There's Cabalas across the street, a casino less than a mile away, and an amazing area with great restaurants and places for kids. But this restaurant leaves a lot to be desired.

Johnny Rockets are supposed to be fun, right? You should feel a great \"vibe\" when you walk in the door. But that's not the case in this restaurant. We were greeted with \"Sit Here\" by a grumpy man yesterday when we were there for a late lunch.  There weren't many patrons, and lots of dirty tables. One of the owners or head honchos came in (I could tell because he was carrying a folder labeled \"Social Media\") and as soon as they saw him the staff started to bus the tables! Shortly followed another \"suit\" and they disappeared into the back room. It's too bad, really, because if they spent a minute or two in the restaurant they would have seen the condition of place. 

The food is always good at Johnny Rockets, which is why I gave them 2 stars. It's served hot, and our girl was very nice.  She made us a milk shake that was great!

This isn't the first time we have been disappointed at this restaurant.  Each time we say to ourselves, gee, why did we stop here? It's sad in this restaurant, which isn't what we expect at Johnny Rockets. There's no liveliness or excitement.

If you're looking for a decent hamburger, then dine here, but don't expect to be enthralled by anything except the location."}

{"text":"So...I had a coupon and had never tried Johnny Rockets, so the family and I decided to check it out.
When we went it was dead, all the employees looked pretty bored, I guess the nights and weekends make up for it since this Johnny Rockets is located next to a movie theater. 
What turned me off instantly was the employes uniforms, they wore white shirts but they looked more dingy and wrinkly then anything. Just makes you hope they use good hygiene while preparing your food if you know what I mean. 
We tried to use our coupons but you can only use one per transaction. It was kids eat free Monday thru Thursday, so we went with the free kids meals instead of the coupons since you can only use one. We ended up spending about 40$ something. A little more than I was expecting to spend. Especially if the food was meh. 
So the food...I ordered the original burger, but the cheddar and bacon was much better so my hubby traded me. The shakes are good, the fries and the onion rings are ok. One thing I really enjoyed were those yummy and crunchy sliced pickles, found at the condiment bar. 
Would I go back to have one of their burgers, nah, probably not. There's other places that are more appealing."}
{"text":"Second and last visit to this place.

First time about a half a year ago was alright. My recent visit was my last.

When I got home I felt horrible, that was bad food it didn't sit very well and all my clothes smelled like a meat packing facility.

Then I thought about the price, what was no better than Burger King cost $40 plus tip for two to dine."}
{"text":"Since I'm currently staying at the Excalibur, I decided to try this quick burger joint. Apparently they forgot to make my order because I waited for 15 minutes for my food. When i was given my to go bag I asked for ketchup and she rolled her eyes at me and told me that she put a few in the bag. I guess she thought three packets of ketchup for a decent amount of fries would suffice. Whatever. I take my food upstairs and begin to eat it. The fries were soggy and far from appealing. The burger had very little flavor.I was extremely disappointed to have spent almost $20 on a flavorless lunch that I didn't have the desire to finish Granted it was edible but I would not recommend nor would I eat here again."}
{"text":"went here around right before christmas time, it was a weekend and teenagers coming and going thru the place like they were too lazy to walk out side, thought that was kind of odd. but got seated right away, ordered our stuff. waiter guy was really good and nice and friendly, my husband ordered a sprite but the waiter came and refilled him with water lol but he noticed the mistake and got him a new drink. i totally digged the music and the whole 50 style! the food was awesome! burgers were much bigger then any other place i have ate at around the area! when the staffed danced they seemed like it was a inconvenience for them to do their job, some even had a pissy look and gave people dirty looks. i mean come one you know what kind of place it is when you go and apply at this joint, so not like it was a surprise that you actually had to dance because its part of your JOB! one other thing is that the manger or boss that night keep telling a bus boy to sweep and do this and do that, i mean i understand telling a person to do something but dont need to do it loud enough for everyone to hear, plus i hate when people are eating and its a full house and they are sweeping around you, totally turns me off to a place and not want to come back. but over all i loved it and the food was GREAT!"}
{"text":"The onion rings are $4.95. From a distance they looked good, so I finally decided to try it. I found that the breading was rather hard and crunchy, difficult to bite into. I like the texture of the ones at BK better. I was disappointed and only ate about half of them, spitting out a few here and there because of the difficulty chewing the hard breading."}
{"text":"Our food was delicious and hot and fresh! It took a little longer than normal but I think it was because they're under staffed. Our server was the only one on the floor, and from what I could see he was making fries and onion rings, if not more. He was very apologetic and very nice though. I'd recommend it if u want a good burger or sandwich and awesome shakes."}
{"text":"Great location right on the strip and in the hotel. Service was less than average and they forgot to give us one of the burgers we ordered. The quality of the food made up for that though, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"Service was OK, felt like the cook was making it in our angry about something. Fries came cold, burgers not representative of how they appear on the menu. Also, none of the regular Johnny Rockets flair and service that you see at other locations was present. You might want to pick a better location."}
{"text":"Johnny rockets is a classic burger joint with good food and shakes. On this trip they were a little busy. Had to wait about 20 mins for food but Rebecca the unofficial store manager and Michelle the waitress were fantastic conversationalists and made the wait much more bearable. Got a recommendation for a \"secret menu\" milkshake and it was tasty. I would go back and give this branch another shot. Hoping the district manager that was on site recognizes their hard work. 
Get Rebecca a promotion/raise!"}
{"text":"Ew. Took the fam over here for dinner one evening. The sign said seat yourself. Okay there were plenty of tables open. But NOT ONE was clean.  A group of workers, including who we found out was the manager later, was sitting at the bar chattin it up. I had to pardon myself to be rude enough to interrupt their convo about justin bieber to please wipe down a table for us. Poor guy stands up slowly and wipes it down until its... uhhh... smeared with the ketchup from the prior visitor. thanks. so im already swallowing my complaints because my kids love those flippen hats. Thats when I see Mr. Cook with his gloves on by the rest of the group of workers eating his friends fries, then goes over to cook some poor customers food with those same gloves. Done. Kids, get your hats, we're outta here. We told the manager, same ketchup smearer kid, about how disappointing our experience was and what we saw. No thanks."}
{"text":"Great service and help with menu and kids options. She is so nice and good atmosphere for kids. We have finish bubbles and she let us use in restaurant."}
{"text":"Good place for dining in, especially in the evening because they do some music and magic. OK burger."}
{"text":"We went on a busy Saturday with my two little nephews. We dont live in Phoenix and it is highly unlikely we will be here or at any other Johnny Rockets ever. We went because we had little kids who only eat burgers.
This one is in a non descript mall.
 Service was great, no wait,  burgers were ok,(I dont like burgers much, so my opinion on them holds no water at all)
 Malts were yummy and big.
Not crazy about the paper serveware. They could step it up with the paper products a bit.
What made it 5 stars is that were these older couples who apparently go there to listen to the jukebox and hang out like they probably did in the 1950's.
 A few times, these adorbs older couples got up and danced. 
Really well,
Danced fast.
Not sure I could have kept up and I certainly couldn't have danced with such grace,
 I fell in love with all of them.
Yes, I know they had nothing to do with the restaurant, but this is my yelp review and if I want to give them 5 stars because I love their customers, I can. 
So there you go."}
{"text":"Not Good... BAD... Stay away!!

I had never been to a Johnny Rockets before. Our group of 10 stopped in on a Saturday afternoon, when only 4 other tables were occupied.

Most of the drinks came out wrong... Even the waters went to the wrong people. Milk shakes were served in dirty glasses. The food ordering was disorganized. Then, the food came out, some 10 minutes later, others 35 minutes later. Many of the orders were wrong.

One person ordered \"No Onions\". The burger had onions. She asked to have another one with no onions... They scrapped them off and gave it back to her... You could smell it... It was honestly insulting.

I really assumed that a national chain, located across the street from a major resort would have some standards and/or some self respect, but no... They really just did not care about how anything was presented.

My chicken club featured a pathetic piece of meat, charred bacon and flavorless tomatoes. The sandwich was around $8 and included no side, no even a pickle.

Not to be vulgar, but I was in the bathroom right after leaving... So there was something in my sandwich that was no clean or not very natural.

I would not return if they offered me a free meal. It was that bad. Maybe they should close so a good place can open in what is otherwise a decent shopping center."}
{"text":"I got a kids meal that cost $5.99 for my daughter
(Chicken strips, fries and a drink)
Then I got myself chicken strips that by themselves are $6.99 and to make it a meal was $4.99 extra. I got the same think as my 2 year old daughter but I paid a $12 difference. Outrageous prices, on a good note: food was delicious. 
But I can go to a nice restaurant for those prices. Please lower."}
{"text":"Was just at Johnny Rockets to pick up lunch for husband and I, took my order, and then had to wait almost 30 minutes for my food, then another 10 mins for my 2 shakes! By the time I got home my French fries were cold & gross! Then they got my burger wrong! I will not be going back to them! You need more people working there! This was not good for my first experience! No stars from me!"}
{"text":"Just because this is located in a food court shouldn't excuse poor service. I ordered a simple burger with no cheese, fries and a soda from the takeout counter. Twenty minutes later, still no food. My husband got his food from another place and was done eating while I was still waiting. Finally he went to check and they gave him the burger and fries which had been sitting at the prep counter to be picked up. No soda though and he had to call the waiter back to get it. Then I discovered the burger had cheese when clearly my order ticket requested no cheese. So I had to wait for another one. After all that, I ate only half of what was a fairly mediocre greasy burger that I paid almost $6 for. I love JR normally but won't eat at this one again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a considerably late bite and there was a pretty decent line considering the hour. Several of the alcohol-induced patrons were causing a ruckus so it was a bit chaotic during the ordering process... but it's Vegas, so it's what you have a to deal with.

My affinity for spicy food led me to order the Houston Burger, which had jalapeños, pepper jack cheese and a spicy mayo-based sauce. As far as burgers go, it was average... good, not great. The sweet potato fries I ordered were pretty solid though.

What makes this a 3-star experience? The wait. For a burger and fries, it took waaaaay too long to get my food. -- 20-25 min. That's just unacceptable for an \"okay\" burger and [probably frozen] sweet potato fries.

Overall, the food was mediocre with lackadaisical service. This place should be considered one of the last options to satisfy your late-night cravings. I know it will be for me."}
{"text":"Awful.   My wife and I waited way to long to get our pathetic burgers. I dont understand why this place insists on serving messy burgers on 2 inch paper plates.  After the long wait for our food the server Graham has the nerve to ask if I had cash instead of a card since their card machine is temperamental.  I think he smoked about a gram due to his slowness and lack of attention. The \"bottomless fries are pointless if your server only comes by once to drop off your food. I'd rather eat a spoiled hamburger from the trash can of a dirty McDonald's than dine here again."}
{"text":"Went to this location after seeing the Odysea.
We waited for 30 minutes before the \"waitress\" got a drink order.
We waited another 30+ minutes before we got up and left.

I got into the restaurant business in 1976.
This was the absolute worst \"dining\" experience I've ever had.

Waited over an hour, in a fast food burger joint, and still did not get served.

NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"Thomas our server at the bar is amazing. I haven't even gotten my meal yet and I just had to say how amazing he his. His energy is intoxicating and it definitely made my day."}
{"text":"This is the best customer service I've ever experienced at a Johnny Rockets. Thomas the server at the bar area was really on the ball. He took the initiative to talk about items on the menu and the different variations of how they could be ordered. He asked if people wanted to be on the same check at the beginning and overall had a great attitude."}
{"text":"Horrible service, they made me wait 40 minutes just to get my food to me because they lost my order receipt. They took no initiative to make it right. If you don't receive your order in less that 15 minutes, makes sure you ask what's going on otherwise you'll be there all night. Trust me they won't bother wondering what your still waiting for. There was only 4 other people who ordered how hard is it keep track of 4 orders?!"}
{"text":"Great place after the movies.  Fun and good food.  Enjoy a shake. Service was good and they all work hard."}
{"text":"Good burgers. Ordered the original burger and fries. Reasonable price considering it's in the grand canal at about 10.76 dollars. I would definitely say that the burger is very tasty and the fries aren't too bad although they are a little thicker than I prefer. Also the only annoying thing is that the new ketchup bottles have a really hard time getting ketchup to come out."}
{"text":"Been a huge fan of Johnny Rockets for over 10, especially fond of their tuna salad sandwich and various chicken sandwiches. However I have noticed over their years they have changed their recipes, reduced portion sizes of sandwiches, and even changed the ingredients of the tuna and smokehouse sauce. Unfortunately I probably won't return because I have had too many back-to-back bad experiences with their food quality, but I can still reminisce on the good 'ol days!"}
{"text":"Poorly managed restaurant. I have been to Johnny Rockets in California and AZ and unfortunately this location doesn't represent the usual JR quality. Chilli cheese fries were cold and the cheese was imitation cheese whiz. WTF? This while I am sitting under a sign that says Real Wisconsin Cheese. Are you kidding?  The cooking staff was loudly discussing their sex life in vulgar terms for all to hear including children. Really,  this is Johnny Rockets quality?  I will never go back."}
{"text":"This place is ok, the burgers were good I just personally thought the bun had a little to much grease. 
I love that they have the coke machine and you can add flavors to your drink. The restrooms are in the back and are fairly clean. The service I will say was great, everyone was very nice and helpful. The fries were tasty 
I'm not sure if I would make the trip all the way over here for them especially with so many other food choices but the food was ok and the service in my opinion was awesome."}
{"text":"This is not my normal opinion of Johnny Rockets, but I've eaten here several times, and this location, is not what I'm use to, when it comes to Johnny Rockets.  First of all, it took them forever to wait on me, and there were only 4 tables, that were occupied.  The wait staff, were too busy, talking about their sex and party life, to be interested in working.  I believe that's what their employer, is paying them for.  I would expect this kind of wait, if they were busy, but they were not.  After my food arrived, that was the last time I saw anyone, and I had to walk around, to find someone, just to tell them I needed my ticket.  3 strikes, and you're out."}
{"text":"We asked to speak to the manager because of the service. Not because it was crap but because Thomas was the best server we have ever had at any restaurant. His energy, personality and hospitality was above and beyond we have ever received."}
{"text":"Stayed here for the backstreet boys concert and there wasn't much to eat inside the hotel so I settled with this place after going to the gym. 

Wait was a bit but I thought it was okay since I ordered chicken tenders along with my burger. 

So I brought the takeout with me to my hotel room to eat it. Burger was good however when I got to the chicken tenders, two of them were raw. They were probably frozen then quickly thawed and deep fried. Luckily I ate only a bit before spitting it out and caught it in time. Unfortunately my flight was very soon so I had no time to show them and complain. 

Be sure to rip the chicken tenders and check that they were cooked fully. Luckily I did not get sick as I spat out the raw pieces asap."}
{"text":"Sonia and a trainee seemed so clueless when I asked questions about the menu. Sonia also gave attitude while I was ordering. Service is lacking.. As for the food, it was the best I've had and I do visit often. Probably gonna skip this location next time"}
{"text":"Inside the Flamingo hotel, this is located in a mini food court with about 4 dining options.  We got in late to LV and we were pretty hungry.  I'm not a fan of burgers, so I got the side salad which was pretty good and a vanilla malt.  I prefer the malts at Mel's Diners, but this one is better than malts at other places.  It was nice and thick, whipped cream and cherry on top.  Hubby had a big old burger with fries and Jr. Yelper had chicken tenders with onion rings (extra $1) instead of fries.  The onion rings were pretty good but the fries were so-so.  After ordering your food, they give one of those flashing lighted pagers and you pickup the food when ready.  The dining area is like a big cafeteria."}
{"text":"Good american style food. Burgers a larger with good grease and the wings are pretty bomb. Good drunk good. Not much else to it."}
{"text":"Thanks Yelp!  So I was the first person to use the yelp check in coupon.  It caused quiet the stir, as they had only signed up the week prior and already here was some guy using it in their store.  Talk about instant turnaround on their investment!

We had a GREAT scottish waiter.  Is it just me or do accents make things better? His laid back attitude and chill demeanour, coupled with the retro and truly old school american feel of a Johnny Rockets, made me feel like I had just been thrown back in time with Marty Mcfly and stepped into a diner for some burger and shakes.

Which is partly what I had.  I see some of the other reviews but for us, our food came in a relatively decent time with smiley faces made of ketchup on our plates (crazy scottish humour!).  Their Burgers aren't to die for and I probably would try something else on their menu.  I've tried better at worse establishments so I can't say I was crazy about it.  

We tried the wings as well as I am a HUGE fan of wings.  They aren't the greatest either but I would say that in the area, if you want to grab some quick wings they would be alright.  

The true secret, especially if you have a sweet tooth, is something that apparently wasn't on their menu.  Red Velvet Cake!!!  It made up for the burgers and anything else that was wrong with the world...like only a healthy amount of sugar can!!!

I am only rating it a 3 star though because that night and the next day I was sick ;(  I definitely suspect the burgers at this place, however the staff, the rest of the food, and throwback feel and the yelp discount would make me want to go try then again...just not the burgers!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I ate at this location around 5pm yesterday.  When we arrived we had to wait for about 2 min to be seated even though there was only 2 parties seated in side. This was because all the servers were standing around by one of the order terminals just talking amongst themselves.  One server acknowledged us at first but still went back to talking. Then when we were finally seated we had to wait another 5 minutes or so for our drinks. Again 1 of only three parties and 6 servers working. Also there were 3 tables that hadnt been cleaned off yet.  Once we got our food about 20 minutes later it was very good, I will at least mention that. But considering how much I paid for a cheesesteak, burger, 2 fries and 2 sodas, almost $40. I felt like I already over paid for the food and considering the terrible service we recieved on top of the already expensive food. Our server do not deserve a tip in my mind.  This is the worst service I've received from any restaurant.  I will not be returning to this location ever again."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worse service we have ever received.  First time I ever recall not leaving a tip for the server.  Too much to even say, but will never return."}
{"text":"My kids love this place and I keep getting suckered back in but never again.  Ants on the table was a bit much-and the lack of apology or offer to discount or meal sealed it for me.  This place is banned from my list forever."}
{"text":"The fun atmosphere and well prepared burgers and sides make this a nice date place, a memorable outing with the kids or place to stop for a milkshake.  The shakes are fantastic.  Burgers taste like real burgers of old diner days!  Fries are crispy and golden.  The waiters draw a cute face made out of ketchup on your plate if you order something with fries.

Give the kids a half a roll of quarters to put in the jukebox.  It's thrilling the first couple of times to hear YOUR SONGS!

Overall this is a nice place to go and enjoy a burger and fries and shake!"}
{"text":"The meat in my philly cheese steak tastes and looks burnt. It has no other taste. My chili cheese fries are mediocre..."}
{"text":"Upset to say, but a part of my childhood was spoiled tonight. As a kid growing up Johnny Rockets was my favorite place to go to. I always loved their hotdogs, burgers, shakes and chili cheese fries!!! Well, today my BF and I decided to come by and revisit our childhood memories for dinner with an old fashioned burger, fries and shake. He ordered the smokehouse burger and I ordered the spicy chipotle chicken burger while we shared regular fries and a chocolate banana shake. Well, if you see the picture I uploaded of my burger, you can see the photo of how it should've looked like right next to it. 1, the menu said it was romaine lettuce...well it was iceberg that I got. 2. The chicken on the photo looked seasoned and amazing...the chicken I got was completely flavorless and barely cooked thoroughly I could barely tell if it was healthy so I didn't finish it. Good thing my BF enjoyed his burger and our shake was actually good. As for the fries... Let's talk about them while I also talk about the service. 

Service was very very slow. Food took look to make and then throughout the meal, when we would want our waitress's attention, she was doing other things keeping her from seeing us. Our waters never got refilled. AND we nearly finished our burgers and we had to question if our fries were on their way to find out she forgot them. After when we finished and wanted the check, it was so hard trying to get her attention, it took forever to get it. 

Overall, we were disappointed and will probably leave our great memories of Johnny Rockets as kids in our head and maybe not be back unless we're craving for a decent milkshake"}
{"text":"Okie Dokie so I havent been to Johnny Rockets for like over 10 years now and came to grab some food to go while my wife stands in line at Bass Pro Santa Wonderland to take pix with Jolly Ole Saint Nick and boy was the food a little on the high end. Like $10 A BURGER high. I know that doesn't sound like a lot but because they weren't $10 good is why I'm saying that. Now granted we didn't get a burger but instead got the chicken club sand and the Philly cheese which sound and looked amazing but the actually outcome.....I think I had better at Denny's and theirs comes with fries and Denny's have bomb seasoned fries too. So I can't say if their burgers are worth it or not. So 2 so so sandwich and a side order of soggy fries and burger king tasting onion rings and a soda for $30 something bucks I will have to say I wished I'd spent that somewhere else. I'm not sure if it because it's in a Hotel Casino but even if it was I wouldn't have mind if it blew my mind. Sucks that it was the only fast grab and go food place I could find in the Silverton next year we'll eat before we come."}
{"text":"I've been to this Johnny Rockets 3 in the last week. The food is always fantastic and on that off chance it is my,  they fix it promptly. The staff is one of the best I've ever crossed paths with. The new manager (Christina?) was super friendly. Tonight they were slammed and letting people know before they were seated that it was about a 45 minute wait for orders. We sat down anyway because the food and service is worth it. My absolute favorite is the route 66 burger! AMAZING! My children and I will continue to go back here."}
{"text":"Went here last night since I had a groupon, ordered chicken strips, cheeseburger and fries and a shake.  It was ok, I don't think I would return just to go here.  The shake was pretty good, but you can get better burgers at a fast food place..ie..in and out, five guys, etc."}
{"text":"Johnny Rockets is AWESOME!

Me and my mother went in around 8:30pm after shopping for a little while. We sat down and immediately got greeted by the nicest guys you will ever meet. (Shout out to Jasper and I forgot the other guys name lol).

They made everything exactly the way we asked and despite the fact that we stayed after hours, they seemed in no rush to kick us out.

My burger was BOMB. It was juicy and the produce on it was crunchy and fresh. YAY! My mother loved her burger, too. She is kind of on the pickier side so for her to say, \"MMM this is good!\" means you guys did a good job.

I love Johnny Rockets and will definitely return :)"}
{"text":"I'm extremely disappointed I used to love going here but ever since they remodeled the place and completely abandoned the 50's look i no longer feel need to stop by. The food isn't that great and I mostly liked going here because of the aesthetic i guess I'll just have to find another restaurant to take my money to ):"}
{"text":"WORST Johnny Rockets experience Ever..!!!

My First time here at the AZ Mills Johnny Rockets and I was extremely disappointed.
This truly was the WORST Johnny Rockets experience I ever had!! I have had JRs in Las Vegas, Colorado, San Diego etc. and have Never had a bad experience like I had here,. So with that experience at other JRs, I thought that I would get the same quality here in AZ - Wrong! Way Wrong!!

I started off ordering the plate of combo fries and onion rings, there were very few fries and 4 small onion rings (I thought it was a joke) I called the server and said \"is this really all the onion rings they are going to plate?\" he said \"I'll talk to my manager...he came back with a tiny paper cup with 2 small onion rings.. I thought this was extremely cheap, at the JRs it was always plentiful when I ordered.
So after that I ordered a JR double meat cheeseburger, I waited for about 16-17 minutes (which is extremely slow for a JRs for a hamburger order) Then the server finally brings my burger, as I try a bite. both patties are seared crispy dry, no flavor at all, as if they had left it on the grill for 1/2 hour. It was dry, tasteless and crunchy, and the condiments (tomato, lettuce, onion) tasted old and wilted. This was by far the WORST hamburger I ever had - and I've had a lot of bad hamburgers in my day and this one was without a doubt the Worst!! I would have enjoyed a Carls Jr, or even McDs a thousand times better...
. 
That said I will not be patronizing this store anymore... (and that's sad because I live in AZ and this is the only JR close to me) 

I attribute this to management, they have the keys to quality control and should make sure that their staff if cooking the product by corporate expectations. 

So why didn't I complain (were are already late for a show, and I was upset about the meal - which should have got to our table 8 minutes earlier. The restaurant was not full at the time,  we were there at 3:30 pm. There is NO excuse the have poor service at this time of the day, at any establishment, Period! 

Corporate should take note of this store, no wonder it has only 3 stars rating, I am only giving them 1.

Disappointed Johnny Rockets customer..."}
{"text":"I was at the fashion mall and it was not too busy.  I was shopping and didn't want to wait to eat at the hotel.  Stopped here and the server was great.  I did not get his name but he was friendly and very professional.  Food was good but a bit pricy.....thus only 4 stars.  However 5 stars for the server !"}
{"text":"Very disappointing!  Poorly managed operation.  Only 2 people working kitchen during dinner on Saturday.  Waited 45 minutes to get 3 burgers.  Burgers arrived cold.  Cheese on cheeseburger was cold and hard, not melted from the grill, and not melted from the meat because the meat was cold.  The fries were not fresh.  They were brown, stale and refried.  I have a hard time with wasting food, but we decided to not eat our food.  We politely paid over $30 for the tab, tipped our food server, and walked out.  This is possibly my worst dining experience in 20 years."}
{"text":"FAKE Johnny Rockets stay away. They claim they are an Express and they are just bad.

Horrible service they call themselves a d express as an excuse not to offer the same services and quality. They are bigger than any rockets I've been to at a mall how can they call themselves an Express. They have no bottomless fries no counter service and no 50s style them dressed staff just jeans and a t-shirt. This is not a Johnny Rockets.

To top it all off they screwed up my order which I verified was correct on my receipt which means they don't bother to read the orders and just make them the default way like robots.

Worse than that the burgers don't taste the same they are okay but they don't taste like Johnny Rockets. #FAIL"}
{"text":"On our way out of Vegas we decided to stop in for some burgers. The service was so painfully slow you could scream, which would be fine if it was busy, but we were the only people in there! There was only one waitress working, who was short with us and just not pleasant to be around. She wandered around the restaurant and ot was extremely hard to get her attention. The food was good as always. So if you're looking to spend an hour and a half waiting to eat some good cheap food, then look no further, but it was little too unproffesional for my taste."}
{"text":"It was a busy day when we were there.  But my expectation is that it is always busy being part of the complex housing Odysea and the Butterfly Museum.  The kitchen could not keep up with the crowd, and we were sorry we went to this restaurant.  We waited 35-40 minutes and finally asked the manager what was wrong.  She said there was a big party - but we were sitting near the big party & they didn't have food either.  We also knew they had ordered after us.  When the food arrived it was good - average for this type of restaurant.  But they definitely have a problem in the kitchen and we would never go here again or recommend it."}
{"text":"Just okay. Burgers are fresh and hit the spot when you've been running around and forget to eat lunch. Onion rings are better than the fries and the chili is forgettable. Staff are awesome, though, and make up for anything lacking in the taste department. 

I was hungry. They fed me. S'all good."}
{"text":"This place gets 1 star for location. The food is premade as they get busy during lunch time. The only thing warm are the fries. You're order comes out too quickly (they don't even try to hide the fact that the food is premade).

Overall, a horrible representation Jonny Rockets! :-("}

{"text":"Do not get the pancakes for breakfast. Not good. Stick to lunch or dinner if you're gonna go but there are many better options in Vegas. Realize that this rating is mostly about the breakfast attempts. Usually I have a decent burger meal."}
{"text":"Nice oldish style restaurant in the heart of downtown Toronto! I was here a few months ago for lunch and enjoyed the atmosphere and food. They have a jukebox where anyone can go up to and pick a song and it plays throughout the restaurant. I found that pretty cool! 

The waiters are very stylish and have an oldies kind of style going on to match the theme of the restaurant. The food portions were fair and tasted good as well. 

Overall, I liked the uniqueness of this restaurant as I have never experienced somewhere like this before. I would recommend this location to a friend."}
{"text":"I usually enjoy Johnny Rockets, and this time around there wasn't much to dislike about other than the pricing. Sure, we are on the Vegas strip, but since this Johnny Rockets is at the Flamingo, there are actually a few places that you may get more of your money's worth for burgers.

The food that I received was your typical greasy burger from Johnny Rockets, but my burger seemed a little over cooked. The beef was a little tougher than usual.

Service was okay. Took a little long to get the food."}
{"text":"This is not your typical Johnny Rockets. The menu is simplified down to just their burgers (and a chicken sandwich) and fries, but unlike a \"normal\" JR, this location also offers all day breakfast sandwiches (and accompanying tots)! While you can always get take out at JR, this location is clearly designed/better equipped to accommodate quick service ordering and expediting; if you're not wanting full, sit down service, there is a separate register and menu board. 

This location is inside the Bally's food court. It can be easily accessed from the street on Flamingo near Linq Lane. From inside Bally's- follow the food court signs and take the escalator down from the casino floor, near Buca di Beppo. 

Food is good and true to the brand's identity. I am a lifelong fan so I was a little leery based on the restaurant and menu appearance, but it is exactly what I expect when I eat there. 

The real motivation for this review is to highlight the enthusiastic, one of a kind service you will receive from Thomas. He's mentioned by name in so many reviews for a reason! He is so warm and personable, making every guest feel welcomed and appreciated. His positive attitude makes dining here a memorable experience and I will gladly return to this location to enjoy his fun and dynamic service. It's the epitome of the Office Space quote- \"People can get a burger anywhere, they come (to Chochkie's) for the atmosphere and the fun. Ok. That's what the flair is about. It's about fun...\" Thomas doesn't need superficial flair, he will impress with his winning demeanor alone!"}
{"text":"I wish i could give this place less stars but I unfortunately cant. So after a long night watching the Chainsmokers we came to eat and Victor (4000701) was a complete douche! If you dont like working here just quit and stop giving customers attitude and rude service! I have never had Johnny Rockets & didnt know it was $1 extra for grilled onion or that drinks werw sold seperate. I clearly asked for a regular size drink and he charged me for the large! Overall the good was great but poor customer service & I've worked in customer service since 2008."}
{"text":"They downsized their burgers and kept the high prices. I used to love coming here for my burger/fried fix, but last visit I noticed the burgers are a lot smaller. Almost $15 for a tiny burger, ton of fries, and small drink."}
{"text":"I have been to 4 JR's and this has to be the worst one.  Which is a shame, as its close for lunch.  


The place was about 1/3rd full and I sat at the bar and got a tea very quickly.  

You notice a lot sitting at the bar watching the food be prepared, I didn't order fries, but they cook their fries and then place them in a big metal bowl and they let them sit on the counter until they are needed... how do they stay warm? 
Also all the food items are placed directly on a long wooden butcher's block that they do wipe down occasionally with a dirty white towel!!!! Use paper sheets or plates to build your sandwiches!!!! 

I was never offered a refill and as the staff was more interested in socializing, I got my own refill. 
 
I watched as regulars came in and the staff who knew them spent all their time looking after their friends/regulars and ignored me. Eventually I had to go an ask the manageress why people who came 20 minutes after me were eating and my meal wasn't being made yet.  She apologized and said she will get my meal made... when it was made while only took 5 minutes it sat 3 feet from me on their shelf while everyone else was too busy either socializing... in fact no one noticed that I got up and got my own food from around the counter. 


The sandwich was good! I have to admit even though I got it myself."}
{"text":"Simply good and affordable breakfast. However, this place's menu is the same like Breakfast & Burgers upstairs. Same coffee, same muffins and biscuits, and same pancakes. All delicious. Good and fast friendly service too."}
{"text":"I'm one of those people who will give a high review just for good service. I frequent this branch and I have never gotten bad service here. Might be because I'm local and they recognize me. But anyways, yes, it's overpriced. Yes, the burgers are good, but not mind-blowing good. However, I like the way I'm treated here, especially by a gentleman named Edgar. Very professional young man. I've seen him diffuse some tense situations with some really unreasonable customers.
Thus, 4 stars."}
{"text":"Johnny Rockets is a yummy indulgence after walking around OdySea. They have discounts for members, which is awesome! The food was fresh, hot, and arrived quickly. I enjoyed my sourdough burger immensely. Ada is a friendly, attentive waitress."}
{"text":"Johnny Rockets is an indoors eatery at Kennywood that replaced what was once a multi-food vendor pavilion. They pretty much offer burgers, hot dogs, chicken fingers - those sorts of foods, but in an old fashioned, diner-inspired eatery instead of an amusement park food stand. I stopped in for my first meal here with a friend recently and have to say, I like this addition to the park. For one thing, it's air conditioned - something that I think we can all appreciate given the temperatures we've had this summer! It's admittedly not the cheapest place to eat but it's not outrageously pricey either. I think that's to be expected in an amusement park. But frankly, given the overcooked garbage other amusement parks have tried to feed me for these prices, I can't complain about Johnny Rockets at all!

My friend went with a standard cheeseburger and I went for the Route 66 (a fancy name for a swiss, 'shroom and onion burger). I'd been worried about the food quality after the place's notorious growing pains last year, but fortunately the burgers my friend and I got were both quite juicy and tasty. We were both also pleased that side salads were an option we could order, instead of us being limited to the usual \"burger and fries\" order.  Add in the fact that the staff were super friendly and the meals came to us in a timely manner (especially considering that there was a 12-person party in the building with us - the staff were juggling their duties well that day!), and we were both happy and left feeling energized and ready for more rides.

We didn't get milkshakes this time around as we wanted to get ice cream elsewhere after we left Kennywood, so no comment on those. Still, I would absolutely stop in to eat here again - as long as they weren't jam packed, at least. Sorry, but while a 30 or 45 minute break from the park is nice on a hot summer day, any more time than that is just cutting into my ride time too much!"}
{"text":"I don't really write review but man the experience here was really bad. We came in big group so we split in two tables... We order same time but took forever for our tables' food to come( not just one or two people from our table but EVERYBODY) . By the time we got our food everyone in the other table finished eating already. Had the streamliner, the vegetarian burger but it was really dry like a cookie. It sure wasn't fresh off the grill. 

If you are used to eating JR in other areas, I sure don't recommend this location."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and great malts. In Las Vegas, there are several Johnny Rockets location. Our trip to the Johnny Rocks at the Silverton Casino was special. The manager served my daughters and me during an off-peak time. We stopped in between the Stingray and the Mermaid shows to grab a malt. The manager noticed I had a USAA credit card and gave me a discount because we were a military family. We were touched by the gesture. Our malt was generous. It was a tall glass plus more in a metal container. We were glad that the 3 of us shared one malt. Delicious for the tummy and for the heart!"}
{"text":"I had a chocolate milk shake, houston burger, and bacon cheese fries. I thought I was going to have a stroke, but it was delicious."}
{"text":"Surprisingly bad. luke warm heat-lamped Sysco quality. worse than any JR Ive ever been to. wtf"}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad meal yet! They are always hopping and you sometimes have to wait a bit for your food...but it is so worth it!!
The food is a little high priced, but groupon has deals often.
Their chili is fantastic, whether you use it for your fries or just get the chili bowl with onions and cheese. The chicken club sandwich is tender and all their burgers are more than filling."}
{"text":"It was nice to sit in an air conditioned space and relax a little on a long day at the park, but $3.79 for a pop with no refill (after we had already bought the refillable souvenir cup at another park spot) and a 20+ minute wait means we won't be back here again."}
{"text":"Horrible service placed my order 20min. have not even seen our drinks yet. Not a place to be unless you want to wait a long time. The table next to me sat here and the server never placed there food. Just horrible, if I do not receive my drinks in the next 10 min. I am walking out. I would not even give them 1 star."}
{"text":"The burger is alright, even though it doesn't have any flavor. I like their fries but it comes in little quantities. Overall an okay burger place but overpriced for what we got."}
{"text":"As you read my yelps you'll likely see the statement ,\"I'm a foodie.\" Perhaps you're asking what kind of foodie ever goes to any fastfood chain.  It is rare but periodically I must.  Usually, it is Johnny Rockets. 

I live nowhere near a Johnny Rockets!  Every other trip we take I apparently get very excited when I see a Johnny Rockets!  I don't even always go in to eat.  Sometimes I just take photos.  I don't know the genesis of this low key obsession.  I don't know what it is because I almost never eat red meat ( months at a time between consumption ) pork (never) or chicken (possibly years between)! I'm a default pescatarian.  They serve all of the aforementioned with burgers at their forefront.

Their french fries are savory. I've yet to have their onion rings.  I've witnessed my husband devour their BLT with a side of ranch dressing.  I think I mainly have fries and ice cream here. 

This particular Johnny Rockets could be a tad quicker.  It isn't McDonald's so I don't expect a 2 minute turn around but after 10 minutes I expect 1 complete order.  This did not occur.  Fortunately, they apologized and fixed the matter in under 3 minutes with a 50% discount for the forgotten items."}
{"text":"In LOVE with the crispy chicken salad! Since I work at the mall and only have 30 minute breaks the servers are extremely understanding and speedy with my order! They always remember my face and I always feel very welcome! Such hard workers over there and LOVE the outcome. If your looking for a fun place to eat come here! Even at their busiest they have to dance to songs that come on for guests entertainment. One word \"Bravo!\""}
{"text":"So like many of the reviews the service and staff are great. The food however is nothing to write home about. I brought my daughters here for a little nostalgic fun and to have some shakes. I was very disappointed when my onion rings tasted like burnt dirty oil not to mention it raised the cost of my burger to over $11.00. The french fries my girls had were bland, with a rubbery texture. If they could improve those items and align the portion size with the price it would be worth more stars."}
{"text":"Waited at the door to be seated for 6 minutes, with no one else waiting and multiple hosts waking by us. Then they sat us in the back by the kitchen and the posted security guard. We sat for 14 minutes without anyone coming up to us asking for drinks or anything so we left."}
{"text":"I rarely go to Johnny Rockets at Meadows Mall; however, I wanted to get a cold drink and sandwich.  The server, Jesus, made my experience one of best.  
Jesus was the only server at the counter.  He made certain that everyone was well taken care of.  Another couple and I were marveling at the outstanding of service we received from him.  He was pleasant, outgoing and never stopped smiling.  He came back several times to see if we needed anything and asked how we were doing.  In between, he assisted the counter cook. 
Jesus is definitely an asset to your company.  Hold on to this young man!  
Thank you for your outstanding and appealing service, Jesus!"}
{"text":"(Second time attempting to post this)

My experience at this Johnny Rockets was one for the record books. I was looking to bring in 25 people to celebrate a friend's grandmother, and the manager -- Saem -- went above and beyond to make sure all went well.

I spoke with Saem prior to the trip, and he was able to not only reserve seating for us in a little \"patio\" area to the left of the restaurant, but he was able to give everybody a discount, AND a free meal to the guest of honor. We were all blown away by the great customer service. Top that off with great food, and it was a huge win.

The lines may be long at this place, but it all depends on the time of day, and your patience. The line I was in went quickly.

Highly recommended for when you're looking for a nice, fun place to eat. 

Thank you again for your thoughtfulness and hospitality!"}
{"text":"Super expensive, I am okay with that because it's in a casino in Las Vegas but the quality of food is so poor, it's doesn't even compare to othe JR locations. I waited 20min to get my food for dine in. Burger and fries were so bad, geez.
I ordered 2 burgers, 2 fries and 2 milk shakes for $45 and everything went to trash."}
{"text":"Decent burger. Nothing special. Was a little on the dry side so it might need a little more sauce. Add a little mustard to make it better."}
{"text":"This doesn't even deserve a star. But I am forced to in order to leave a review. We got seated and after a minute, a server asked us what we wanted. No anything to drink? No asking if we had questions. What do you want. We asked for a high chair. We got one and the server disappeared for 10 minutes. She came back. Same thing. What do we want? No asking if we wanted starters. We did. We ordered one. A kids meals. 2 burgers. 3 drinks. 45 minutes later. We get all the food. Wait. Aren't starters supposed to come BEFORE your actual meal?! We could see our food ready to come to the table for at least 30 minutes. It came out cold. The staff literally was running around like chickens with their heads cut off. But I guess with all the other terrible customer service at this area, this place just follows suit. Expect to wait at least 30 minutes to get your bill. And hope your small kids can handle being at a burger place for 2 hours. Wish I read the reviews before going. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Place was filthy.  They use the same wash rag for seats as the table.  Asked for no onion or relish an then the proceed to drench sandwich with mayo to point I couldn't scrape it off."}
{"text":"The food is expensive $41 for two burgers, fries, onion rings, chicken strips, and bacon cheese fries. The food was average. Its is the same you can get at Whataburger, In n out burger, etc, nothing special to warrant that price. It filled me up when I was hungry though. I will probably not eat here again."}
{"text":"I have been to this Johnny rockets two times.  Both times the hostess was very rude to me.  At first I thought this was the hostess being rude but last night I concluded that it is a poorly managed restaurant.  I've been to an excellent Johnny rockets in Seattle.  The food isn't as good at this location, either."}
{"text":"Sitting here watching the staff #Workit! It is all women and they are killin' it. Great service and great food. Go ladies"}
{"text":"This place is dirty. Like really dirty. Slow food times, over cooked food and bad customer service. Go to the one at arrowhead mall. Way better."}
{"text":"The lady that took our order was a bit condescending. Secondly we waited a half hour for our food. There was only about 2 people ahead of us. For some reason, they made our milkshakes first but didn't tell us as they sat on the counter while we sat and waited another 20 minutes for our food. Way overpriced for the quality of food. $50 for a hamburger and chicken sandwich, two fries and two shakes. If the food quality had been there, we would not have minded paying that price but the chicken was small and rubbery and poorly put together. McDonalds would have been better and cheaper.

Also, staff would dance when Rockin' Robin would play. There's food to be made. We waited 30 minutes and they have time to dance??!! 

Never will I go to ANY Johnny Rocket locations because of this experience."}
{"text":"Okay their food is what you expect and their service is so so but you can't complain when your using a Groupon haha. I would like to think though you paid half the price they shouldn't provide you with half the service. This location tends to get busy as prices are relatively cheaper than most of the other eateries within the mall but it's located next to the kids play area so it gets pretty loud and  crazy. I recommend their chicken tenders with fries and a milkshake for sure..."}
{"text":"The place was fairly busy. The price was reasonable  for Las vegas. Their  burger was nice and juicy. Fries were good. Good for a quick meal"}
{"text":"The food was hot, fast, and tasty. I do think their buns are too thick for a single patty burger. Our waitress was really nice. I gave it 4 stars b/c I thought I was going to vomit when I went to use the bathroom. It was filthy!!! And it's not because a prior customer made a mess. It's from them not cleaning it well enough. The floor and walls were disgusting and the pipes under the sink looked like it had 2 inches of filth on it. The soap was in a bottle that you use at home and was half water and half soap. Do they really need to save money on soap so they add water to it. It looks like all they do is clean the toilet and that's it. Nasty!!!"}
{"text":"The line was long and food was as expected. They wouldn't give me a cup of water. They said they'd run out of water cups but they had plenty of soda cups... They said they couldn't out water in one. Haha. It's more fun to break the law. I tried two different employees but got no water. Good thing we weren't in a desert."}
{"text":"Not much good to say. There were a lot of employees but only the one girl was actually working.Unfortunately she wasn't our server. I ordered a shake. After 35 minutes I finally asked the manager how many Johnny Rocket scientists it would required to make it. A cook finally came on duty after we had been waiting for 45 minutes. Customers were walking out. Finally our food was served which was good. The manager finally started turning customers away and closed the place down. These same employees that stood around doing nothing just got a raise with the minimum wage increase. Then again I have a feeling they  are no longer employed."}
{"text":"Have had better food at McDonalds at a lot cheaper price, Service was OK"}
{"text":"Just flown in, and a perfect way to start the day.  Really love the sweet potato fries.  Burgers are classic, nothing fancy, and service here (and anywhere in Vegas) was great."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all.  Restaurant is dirty.  Burgers are frozen patties.  French fries tasted like plain frozen fries.  Didn't have the milk shake, maybe that is what redeems this place."}
{"text":"Was going through #thestruggle after pretty much not eating all day and needing to get SOMETHING in my system.  Luckily for me, the Palazzo is still connected to the Grand Canal Shoppes.  Which just so happens to contain the food court that's actually reasonable in terms of price and options.  

Johnny Rockets is probably the best option of all of them, which honestly really doesn't say all that much for the rest of the food court.  But the Smoke House Double got the job done for me right before hitting the club.  Gotta get them cals so that I'm not dying on the dance floor!"}
{"text":"Burgers are lame and dry, which is kind of a problem considering this is a burgers and malts place.

We ordered a combo with ($12) fries and asked if we could substitute onion rings.  \"Sure\" said our server, but when the bill came we were charged an extra $1.10...   and the onion rings were kinda soft, not crunchy on the outside.

The combo also came with a drink and we asked to substitute a malt.  Same response \"Sure\", but again an additional charge of over $2.  

I guess our server doesn't understand that it's common practice to let your customer know when there will be an additional charge for a substitution...

Malts are pretty good and it's the only thing that gets this place two stars

I feel like this location gets people by default being right next to jobing.com arena, but they don't really cater to repeat customers like a local restaurant, which means they don't go out of their way to satisfy you."}
{"text":"This is the worst service I have had. Our waitress never came by to check on drinks or anything during the meal. She dropped the check off and now we have been waiting 15 min for her to come pick that up. The food was good but not worth this type of service. The server name is Olivia I would recommend if you get her request a new waitress."}
{"text":"We ate at the Arrowhead Mall Johnny Rockets tonight. The service was terrible  and the food was cold. The waitress never came back and offered drink refills or a refill and the supposed unlimited fries. 

I worked at Arrowhead Mall when it first opened and ate at the Johnny Rockets a lot. It was a favorite.  I swore it off 2 years ago the last time I had poor service. We made the mistake of trying it again. Terrible."}
{"text":"Having eaten and enjoyed Johnny Rockets across the country, I was glad to see one in the Westgate complex. My brother and I stopped in for lunch and the place was almost empty. We sat down at a booth and waited for someone to welcome us and get things rolling. The table was clean, the music was great but where was our waitress? Finally a young lady asked us if we had any questions, and took our order. We both ordered a shake, burger and we split an order of fries and an order of onion rings. 
The shakes were delivered in about 10 minutes which was fine. Love those strawberry shakes! It took another 15 minutes or so for our burgers to be delivered, but no fries or onion rings. I asked the waitress and she said they would be right out. After another 15 minutes and us both almost completely finished with our burgers, which were great by the way, I got up, went to the counter where a group of 5 employee's were all standing talking and asked for a manager. One person said that she was the \"trainer\" and asked how she could help me. I told her our concern and she said she would look into it. 
After another 10 minutes the onion rings and fries arrived. Yes they were hot but we had completed our shakes, eaten our burgers and actually were ready to leave. I asked for the manager but was told he was in the back doing paperwork. Good for him, maybe if he actually knew what was going on in his restaurant, service would be better. 
In all the years and places that I've enjoyed Johnny Rockets, this was by far the WORST service experience that I've had. Based on this locations reviews, it looks like I'm not alone in my experience."}
{"text":"I just finished dinner at Johnny Rockets with my wife and can't say enough about it.   We had been once before a year or so ago but or service then was unremarkable and we never went back.   

Tonight however,  we had Sergio as our waiter and even before the food came I commented to my wife how much better the restaurant was and it was all thanks to Sergio.   He was so personable and friendly and the service was fast and friendly.   We will definitely be back.

Thank you Sergio."}
{"text":"Love the sweet potato fries but the rocket burger was meh. My wife's bacon burger tasted a lot better than the one I got."}
{"text":"Fully loaded burgers for cheap late night in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, stayed at the silverton for a few days and it was refreshing to have a place that was available to just get a burger. However same prices as the sun dance though, but it was worth every penny. Had a chili cheese burger and it was amazing. Great service, only wish they were open later during the week."}
{"text":"Food was delicious....am not sure how I feel abt the location it's not too good for finding seats...but over all pretty good, oh one thing I payed abt 30 sumthing dollars just for 2 burger 1 drink, I am assuming this Johnny rockets it's a bit more then other ones I have been too since it's in vegas."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad experience here. My kid always enjoys this place. Great food and super nice staff that cares and go out of their way for you. Will come back soon."}
{"text":"20 minutes later and we are still waiting on an American cheese omelette and toast. Oh and that's after she \"hit the wrong button\" and our buzzer went off. This is the worst and slowest service in this hotel."}
{"text":"Great service received to me by Ada. Great food, friendly environment. Was given a complementary bacon & cheese fries due to a table walk out. :) definitely recommend to others. Chocolate & banana shake was so yummy."}
{"text":"Honestly it's not worth the money. We opted to stop here on our way to the Cardinals/Rams game. My daughter wanted a burger so we ventured in. The service was average and the menu was significantly reduced. Basically on game day they double the prices and slash the menu. It's $10 for a sandwich that doesn't include anything. The food was middle of the road; nothing that would encourage me to return. I guess the one positive was that the shake was good.... but how can you go wrong with a chocolate shake?"}
{"text":"awesome!!!! i purchased a groupon for this meal. the food was great! no wait! and staff was helpful. prices were pretty high for a burger only but i was worth it. very good!"}
{"text":"After a night I'd either clubbing, drinking or gambling this is a great option.

This place replaced the McDonalds and it has actually been an upgrade.

Service is efficient and food comes out regardless what time of the day or night it is. 

They offer refills and have an organized condiment bar.

The dining area is shared with other eateries so keep in mind it is busy most night especially on weekends.

If you're not that wasted, remember to grab your placemat that is included in your tray. It offers great discounts for future visits and don't expire until the end of the year! 

I enjoyed the classic cheeseburger and fries. Both were delicious, and perfectly warm.

Their staff are hard working and respectable, not what you'd expect.

Thanks Johnny Rockets for keeping me and my friends fed even in the wee hours of the early morning.

See you again soon!"}
{"text":"Soooooooooooooooooo slllloooooooowwwwwww....

If you want dinner, get there right when they open."}
{"text":"Tried Johnny Rockets on a Groupon.  Had the double cheeseburger and tots.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Honestly, when you're drinking at a table, this hits the spot! I had the smokehouse burger and onion rings and both were actually really good. Not gourmet by any stretch but a decent burger! I would eat here again."}
{"text":"Showed up at 2:00, all but three tables were covered with trash and only 20% were occupied. Turned around and left in disguise. Not eating at an establishment where they don't bother cleaning up their tables, especially when it is not busy. They deserve their one star reviews."}
{"text":"Haha this place makes me giggle. 

My friend wanted to go here after work so we ended up here on a Friday evening. The place was crowded and we ended up sitting the middle of the room. Eh. 

I think the menu had only one vegetarian option so I ordered that. It was just a boca burger basically. I'm not sure why I ordered it, as I do eat meat, but all I can remember about the burger was that it was huge and just tasted like mustard. It's a good thing I like mustard though.

Besides the vegetarian burger the rest of their food is good. I've had their regular burgers, onion rings, fries, and milkshakes before and have always enjoyed them. Plus the food is cheap.

The service is always nice -- which I think can be hard to do sometimes especially with how crowded it can get.

The only thing that made me feel uncomfortable was when all the waitresses had to stop what they were doing and dance to a Bee Gees song in the middle of the room. I'm never sure if I'm suppose to watch or even make eye contact when they do that. wtf."}
{"text":"This is in a food court and is a counter rather than a restaurant like many of their locations off the strip. They have a few seats at the counter and then many seats in the food court area. We were looking for something fast to eat, so we decided on this. We all enjoyed our food. It was your basic diner-type food, which I enjoyed. The employees were nice and we got our food quickly. The food court was also pretty nice and was clean. It is also a quiet place on the strip. 
I have eaten here multiple times and I have enjoyed it every time."}
{"text":"Our burgers and chicken strips were delicious, however, almost not worth the wait. Fresh and good quality produce and everything came out warm. Their buns are the best! 

Unfortunately it took almost 20 minutes to get our food, so that definitely took away from it a bit. Still worth skipping the \"Golden Arches\" for!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!! Been coming for a couple of years usually service is pretty good but our last visit was awful.  Started out with ordering cokes when 3 of us got them they tasted like diet so I thought it was a mistake but when I called the waitress over she said no it must be the mix why don't you pick something else. So we did and instead of bringing our new drinks she just starts wondering around. I call her over and ask if we can have our new drinks and she says oh yeah I am going to get them. Same problem with the root beer and sprite so called her over again and told her I said I think there is something wrong with your mix /carbonation is off so she says I will bring you water. Doesn't even tell her manager or try to fix it at all. Then our order comes she didn't add fries to some of orders that we asked for so I tell the guy who brought our food (I think the manager but he wasn't too helpful either) he says well it wasn't on the ticket and I told him well we want them so he gets some and I requested some ranch and napkins also from him because our waitress keirsten never came to check on us. He brought the requested items and also quickly disappeared. She never came back once our food was delivered to see if it was ok never came back and never made eye contact again. Food was good thank God. We again needed water refills and when she was at a table over from us in had to yell excuse me and she stopped and said yes never did she step closer too us I had to yell to her can we have some more water and ice. She brings it over never again asking if we needed anything else. Now I know the drinks being off flavor is not her fault but the way keirsten didn't handle the situation and then choose to ignore us the rest of the visit was just wrong!!!"}
{"text":"What finally got me into Johnny Rockets was reading that they served a good chocolate malt. In a milkshake kind of world, the promise of a proper malt gets me right off the Sofa of Exhaustion and into the car like a sheepdog who just heard someone say \"dog park.\"

Besides, if we liked Johnny Rockets, we could use that as an excuse to someday try a Royal Caribbean cruise. (RCL features the chain on their ships. So far we've only cruised Carnival... but they only serve milkshakes, so this could be a personal tipping point. Page Malcolm Gladwell.)

The Johnny Rockets at the Silverton casino is right on the edge of the casino floor, tucked into a corner with slot machines close to the two open sides. On our visit we witnessed the sad spectacle of a kid sitting bored in a chair at the edge of the JR \"border,\" watching his dad play slots a few feet away. 

(Sad not only because of this kid's grim situation, which lasted our entire meal, but because he was taking up the clean table-for-two we coveted. Hey, I never said I'm not selfish, We ended up avoiding several dirty tables, all of which were still dirty when we left despite the growing number of customers in the small room, and making do with an awkward two-top in the short corner. This table was situated with the theory that it fit in the space, but only if no one actually sat there.)

Our server was polite but busy. We waited for water until just before our food came, but it was obvious that he was overstretched, not only waiting on tables but making the drinks as well.

The malts were nice enough. Not very \"malty,\" that Whoppers/Maltesers taste that sets the drink apart from a regular milkshake, but I'm easily pleased by any kind of chocolate drink. It was expensive compared to other fast food malts, though. I felt like we were paying more for the \"'50's Maltshop Experience Right Out of a Box\" brand than any real quality.

This couldn't be more true when it came to the burgers and fries. On the one hand, three-cheers for offering a vegetarian burger. On the other hand, it's a Boca burger. Blergh. With Boca, you either have to cook it with great care to get some flavour in there (didn't happen), or you have to hope for excellent toppings to mask the taste (didn't happen).

The food wasn't inedible, but it's the kind whose quality goes downhill quickly as it cools. The cheese congeals, you notice the fries are sort of mealy, and the burger tastes like one that cost much less.

Even now, as I look at the online menu, the idea of Johnny Rockets appeals. Burger, fries, and an excuse to grab a malt. Everything in the pictures looks both fun and good. (They pour your ketchup into happy faces!) The reality, though, is that this is just overpriced fast food with a strong theme. If this is authentic 1950s fare, please cancel my order for a time machine - we'll use those parts for a malt machine instead."}
{"text":"We had a great server who was really friendly and attentive and she helped to make our experience a good one.  My burger and fries tasted very good.  The bun was perfectly toasted.  The lettuce provided a nice crisp crunch and complimented the meat perfectly.  It is a small restaurant but I thought it looked cute."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh. Had the BEST customer service! We went to a Monster Jam, and even though they had a line out the door, the staff really hustled for every customer. We got our food fast, prices are always great... Love this place! Our waiter was A-Mazing!"}
{"text":"12/28/17... No beef. And no I'm not kidding! Shake machine shut down 30 min early. Pathetic operation. Not sure if they franchise, but this operator is terrible!"}
{"text":"Pictures show burgers with whole leaf lettuce, but the burgers have shredded lettuce. For a $10 burger+fries, I'd expect whole leaf lettuce. Disappointed. :(   you can order the burger without the fries, but they only take $1 off. Kudos to them for 25% off discount for military."}
{"text":"When I walked up I noticed there was a long line by the cash register and noticed that that was for take out orders, so I took a seat at the counter where only 1 person was sitting. The employee operating the register saw me, but since he was busy taking those orders I sat for a few min before anyone else acknowledged me or handed me a menu. Once someone handed me a menu I ordered a root beer and chicken tenders and fries. A few min after that, they guy that was at the register came to check on me to see if I had been helped.

My food came out a few min later, but it took another 5-10 min for me to get the sauce I had requested when placing my order. Service got a little better after that since I was being checked on every few min, but nothing to rave about. The tenders and fries were nice and crispy and pretty good. They offer unlimited refills on fries for most of their burger and chicken entrees from what I saw, however I was way too full. Some of the pricing here is kind of steep for a food court place but the chicken tenders and fries weren't too bad at $8.95."}
{"text":"Went here in early june! I have to say it was a great expierence. The place had very fresh food and was good, but I wish their burgers were a little more tasty. As for their famous shakes I must say they were very good. Our waitress was very nice and helpful. I haven't been here in probably 9 years and this was a good welcome back expierence."}
{"text":"Came here on a fairly busy time. But, we were served quickly to a point.
The malts were really good and I do not eat things like this very often. 
Fries were a bit on the greasy side. But, the food was not bad and the price is pretty good as well.
I really like Red Robin more ,but you have to shake it up and try it all. Bathrooms were not too bad. It was busy there so they did a good job keeping it all togehter. 
I like that they use paper and not Plastic. It is better for everything,including us humans."}
{"text":"The don't allow any substitutions. Even when they use the same ingredients but in other items. The manager David was very rude about it and nothing was going to change his mind. It's okay. There are plenty of other places to eat at, especially in a food court in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place need some serious management help. Waited 20 minutes for one (yes 1) $10 cheeseburger. I was the second person in line. The cashier was not friendly. After 15 minutes, I saw my order come up. It sat there, and sat there, until a girl placed it in a bag and then punched in my buzzer number. I was already at the counter before she activated my buzzer. As I handed her the blinking buzzer, she promptly turned around and busied herself with other matters for about 3 more minutes. Then she finally brought the bag to me without so much as a thank you, sorry for the wait, nothing. A convention was getting out for lunch. By the time I got my food, the line was 50 deep behind me. Those poor people at the end of the line will never get their lunch. All the while, the manager was pushing a cart around the back of the kitchen instead of getting his ass on the line to get orders out. I opened the sandwich wrapper to find a disgusting mess. The lettuce was soggy and gross. The condiments barely hit the bun. And these people want a raise?  What a joke!  JR's needs to roll some heads at this place."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for dinner. The host upfront was very good at her job but the servers following were not so good; when it came to running all the food out together. Half our table got all of their orders 30 minutes before the second half. Would not recommend coming here unless you are willing to wait for a long period of time. Shout out to soulless servers with idgaf attitude."}
{"text":"Servers *Kat* and Matthew made our experience memorable. They sang \"Happy Birthday \" to my kiddo and made it fun. The food was okay. But the service we got made it worth the trudge through the mall. *Groupon has a great deal, that's why I went."}
{"text":"Stopped here for late night snacks twice during my trip to Vegas. I have eaten at the restaurant many times, although not at this location. I had a cheese burger meal and it was good as always. Only problem I have is that I cannot get the tater tots with my meal instead of fries...they need to change this policy. The staff was very pleasant and Bertha is awesome."}
{"text":"I love Johnny Rockets. This location is a total disappointment. The girls that work there aren't very friendly and don't pay attention you order. I would recommend having them repeat your order so you actually get what you want. I ordered a tuna melt and ended up with a cold tuna sandwich that I had to throw away. It was a total waste of $10. I will pass on this place the next time I eat at the mall."}
{"text":"I've always loved Johnny Rockets and the service tonight was ok, but the last few times we've been there the food has been awful. 
It was prepared ok but the flavor is that of a good McDonalds, which is really sad. 
I don't complain to gripe but I hope someone who cares sees this reviews and makes a better effort. 
I see this restaurant closing very soon because I just think they care anymore. There's a serious lack of effort lately."}
{"text":"Great food, just like any other Johnny Rockets location. This one is just slow because they only have a handful of employees working...expect to wait a while in line to order and get your food if you go when it's busy."}
{"text":"Coming from Texas, with burger places on every corner, it's hard to view the burgers here as above average. The service was OK, the setting was entertaining, and I liked the fries. If you're in the mood for a burger, this place hits the spot."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff. The crew were fantastic, intuitive and sensitive to the customers need. Definitely recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"It is such a bad service!! Food is bad, not like other Johnny Rockets.  The server came by and said is everything ok? Without eye contact and not from her heart, walk away right away, so fake!!!  We asked and paid for extra mushrooms and the chef only put like two pieces until we complaint to the server and she went and ask more from the chief.  She said OKAY...she did order and sounds like not her problem...  Overall experience is terrible.  Never this JR location!"}
{"text":"45 minute wait to get a veggie burger and its WRONG they put BACON on my VEGETARIAN BURGER. BACON IS NOT A VEGETABLE GUYS. the food itself tastes good....once you get it right...thanl god im only here on business bc i would tell everyone i lnow to AVOID THIS LOCATION....ITS ALSO EXPENSIVE! The prives are exploitative. Period."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place...but we were very disappointed with our visit today.  The place was filled with flies due to dirty dishes remaining on empty tables.  Our burgers were undercooked.  The floors and bathrooms were filthy.  As we were leaving, we noticed the \"A\" rating proudly displayed on the front window.  There were several bugs crawling over the sign.  Pretty ironic."}
{"text":"So apparently they no longer wait on you when you sit down here. No different than any other fast food burger place. Only difference is you pay 12.95 for a double burger and the girl acted like she was doing us a favor only charging us one $2.00 fee to make it a turkey burger.. lol what a joke so $14.95 for  a turkey burger.  Maybe at wolf gang pucks restaurant. Will never be going back here again. Over priced ridiculousness and it wasnt even good food. How do you charge that amount of money and then still give your guest a buzzer to pick your food up at the counter when your already sitting down. Your corporate needs to get it together and realize most people go out to dinner and pay that and want to actually be waited on. And includes a tip but when no one brings refills or food a tip isn't left. Unfortunately corporate is ruining there employees getting extra money. Sad, I see business declining from this establishment."}
{"text":"How could I forget not to review Johnny Rockets? Oh yeah, the bay area Johnny Rockets tastes much better.

After spending hours of gallivanting around the strip with my boys, we decided to call it a night at 2am. On our way back to our rooms, we started to get hungry and the headaches started settling in from drinking too much. Out of curiosity we headed towards the food court of our hotel and find that every restaurant was closed, except for one. Johnny Rockets.

When we got to the register, the staff was already prepping to close. Apparently, the cashier was nice enough to let us be the last customers. I ordered a rocket single with fries. To complete our order for a group of 5 guys, it took about 30 minutes. When I got my order, the burger and fries tasted luke warmed. I'm not sure if they were waiting for all our orders to complete or just got lazy since it was closing.

I couldn't even finish my meal."}
{"text":"We ordered our food one sandwich came to $10.74, the cashier made change out of pocket for a $20.00 told me about my ranch sauce for our fries handed my husband our food and we left.. About 20 minutes later 2 security guards knocked on our door saying we didn't pay for the food, my husband went down stair with the guards.. Cameras everywhere they couldn't watch the cameras on the cashier but watched them enough to figure out what room we are in.. No apologies from the silverton or Johnny Rockets.. Keep your receipts they got thieves working at Johnny Rockets"}
{"text":"For fast food-ish, Johnny Rocket's is pretty good. The service this particular location, is why they're lacking stars. 

I ordered chicken tenders from a woman who seemed to not like her job very much. She wasn't very pleasant at all. After ordering, I sat at the counter to wait for my meal. Several employees walked past me, without acknowledging me at all. When my food was delivered, I didn't receive napkins. The employees were again, zooming past me until one nice gentleman asked if I needed anything. He provided me with napkins, and I asked for the supervisor. Turns out the supervisor was the woman who took my order. She apologizes for the lack of service and I'm guessing warned her staff to acknowledge me. After my encounter with her, nearly every employee spoke to me. 

The chicken tender were good, hot and fresh. They are a bit pricey at $7, and you don't get fries. I probably wouldn't order them again, just because of the price and my experience. If you have the Groupon, it might be worth. Get it to go though."}
{"text":"Over priced! Might as well walk over to Red Robin and get a better burger & more options. 

I'm pretty sure the cashier that took our order was new so I'm gonna go easy on him. Hopefully he'll get better as time goes on. 

Our order was missing an item but it turns out he didn't charge us for it. Maybe read our order back next time? Our fault too, I guess I should have looked at the receipt. 

I just can't get over the prices of their food. Far from great food."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken sandwich- sandwich only- for ten bucks. Naturally Im expecting a decent quality sandwich. Chatting on the phone for 5 minutes with my lady while waiting, I commented hag it must be bomb since its taking so long. Its not eve lunch yet and the place wasnt that busy either. When i got the sandwich, the chicken was tough and rubbery, so im guessing they zapped it to warm it up. The meat was also half the size of the bun and was slipping around like a fish- i couldnt get a bite of anything but lettuce and mayo. What a joke, not worth the money or the wait."}
{"text":"What????? Since when did Johnny Rocket change their menu??? We Love Johnny Rockets, but since we have steered away from eating less red meat, we honestly haven't been eating here. What's a Johnny Rocket Burger without eating a burger patty, right?

Long story short, We were headed to Wuhu Noodle, to only find out that they were closed. Yelp says they were open until 12 and it was a little after 11p when we walked up to see that it was closed. 
After going back and forth on where to eat, we said, Efff it! let's go to Johnny Rockets as our \"meat cheat day.\"

We grabbed a menu and sat down, as soon as we looked at the menu, my BF and I look at each other and was instantly excited that they had other meat options other than beef and chicken. You can now order any of their delicious burgers and swap out your meat of choice (Beef, Chicken, turkey, and they even have a black bean patty!!) I'm literally dying right now, lol.

Instead of my \"meat cheat day\" I ordered the Route 66 Burger with a turkey patty topped with swiss cheese, mushrooms, caramelized onions, mayo on their brioche bun. YUMMY! is all I can say. I tried just the turkey patty itself and it was well seasoned, juicy, yes, i said JUI-CY! and then the caramelized onions were cooked to perfection in my book and that definitely says something in my book because me and crunchy raw onions don't go. 

I also ordered tots (just plain) instead of the usual fries and a peanut butter banana shake. Tots were good, not greasy which I loved. They do have other tots that they have on their menu with cheese toppings and such. The Shakes are always soooo good! The peanut butter to banana ratio was perfect. I love how they give you the remaining shake that didn't fit into the glass. Makes me feel like I get my money worth.

Customer service was on par, and the gentleman that served us was awesome! Food came out quick and hot!!!

I will definitely be back for more Johnny Rocket Turkey Burgers!"}
{"text":"Party of 7, they sat us down quickly in a booth that ended up being just a bit crammed but the place was packed. Waiter was a bit slow to greet and get drinks but apologized, said there was some kind of issue and then was great after that. Lots of Burger varieties and the food was tasty and came out pretty fast.Waiter made ketchup happy faces on the plates they also do a dancing routine every now and then. If you are in the mall and want a burger, this is a good place to go. I wouldn't make a special trip for this restaurant though."}
{"text":"We had amazing service from Crystal!!! She was friendly and explained all our options to us. She checked back on us over and over and we left 100% satisfied with our service. She seemed like she really enjoyed her job :)"}
{"text":"Our food tonight was absolutely amazing Lulu did an excellent job cooking my single rocket burger to perfection. If you like great burgers, you need to come here, we will be back. Not to mention the amazing malts!"}
{"text":"I'm a celiac and its nearly impossible to find french fries out.  Johnny Rockets has a dedicated frier just for fries!  My first visit I closely questioned the young man behind the counter, and to assure me, he summoned the manager who assured me that the frier was ONLY used for fries and that they contained no gluten products, or dairy, or egg.  While I was talking to both of them, the man cooking went to the freezer to read the ingredients for me.  They were safe and I was one happy fry consumer.  

A few weeks after this I was back ordering more fries.  The same young man was on the counter, and he brought our fries and burger (mine on lettuce) and just as I was reaching for a fry, he swooped back and snagged them off the table.  Turns out this batch had been cooked in the wrong frier, something the manager caught!  I was given a new safe portion of fries and a free coupon for fries.  Talk about customer service!

Yes, their burgers are a bit on the bland side, but with the right condiments they are tasty.  Considering how hard it is for me to eat out due to all of my food allergies, this place is awesome.  I get \"fast\" food that is safe, and nicely priced."}
{"text":"Completely see why they have a 2 star rating..service wasn't the worst I've ever had but had to wait 20-25 mins for a luke warm burger. Not a fan at all"}
{"text":"The staff here is always extremely friends, burgers are very tasty and their milkshakes are to die for .... rewind to the scene in Pulp Fiction where Uma Thurman asks for a $5 milkshake.  There is no bourbon but these are some fine damn milkshakes!"}
{"text":"It had been awhile since we were last at a Jonny Rocket.   I like how sometimes a song comes on and the staff starts line dancing.  That is fun.  

This particular visit was not a good one.  The service at this location was absolutely terrible.  We waited like 30 mins for our food.  When it came to use my philly sandwich was cold.  The waiter brought us our drinks and never checked back on us.  We had to stop a different server and ask them to take care of us.   When we actually did see our server he had no personality. At least our table was not important to him.  

Now to get fries and a drink added to your sandwich is $4.50?  Really?  The food is not that good here as it is and then you are going to toss and outrageous price like that out?  We had a 4 year old with us and ordered him a cheeseburger off the kids menu and they charged $1 for a piece of cheese?


The service alone will keep me from returning to this location,  but these ridiculous prices will keep me from returning to any Jonny Rocket location.  $45 for a kids meal, 3 burgers, 3 fries, and 3 drinks?  Craziness.  

For that price Five Guys is a much better option.  If you want sub par food similar to Jonny Rockets but at a much cheaper price then head to Denny's."}
{"text":"Even in my middle of the night, drunken, starving state, I could not bring myself to enjoy this food. They have a limited late night menu and must have the 'B' team in the back learning how to cook it all up in the back. 

My fries were really soggy and not cooked all the way through and I couldn't bring myself to eat hardly any of them. Also, at the food pick-up counter, the lady was a real nazi. If you didn't have your receipt, you weren't getting your food. No exceptions. I get it, people can just walk up and grab whatever they want, but I only get it to a point. It seems to work out OK for places like In-N-Out. And really, who cares?? Everyone is drunk anyways! 

My husband and my cousin were also not impressed with their food which was made evident the next morning when we had tons of food leftover to throw out."}
{"text":"This place is run horribly. It was out of cheddar and steak for Philly sandwiches."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service from the guys manning the counter tonight! It was near closing time, but they cheerfully made my kids a milk shake! Great deal for a small snack $2.99!!"}
{"text":"Edgar is the best!!! Stopped for lunch on our way home to California and received some of the best service I have ever had. I have worked in the food industry for years and would have loved to have an employee of Edgar's caliber on my team. They were busy and Edgar provided excellent service to each and every guest he came in contact with. Thanks Edgar for everything you rock!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here about a month ago. 

The service was good (nice to get service in a burger joint). So were the burgers. We split a number12 and a Houston. I liked both but preferred the #12. 

We also split fries and onion rings. I liked the onion rings better. The fries were on the thick side and I prefer thin and crispy. My wife got a very cherry shake which was yummy. 

Playing in the background was 50s music which added to the throwback diner ambience."}
{"text":"I just want to share one of the best experiences I have had at a restaurant in a very long time. Our service was exceptional Niam had the best customer service skills, not only was he attentive but his energy and positivity absolutely sets the bar high! Great personality, keep up the great work! You made us like Johnny Rockets even more!!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly pleased by the food here. We haven't been to a Johnny Rockets in years because of how bad it used to be. 

The service was friendly, environment upbeat and we had a warm dinner on a chilly night. 

The down falls were: they left onions in my burger even though I asked for them to be removed, I asked for pickles and received 3 tiny ones. It's was VERY loud and a bit cold inside. Otherwise, it would've been a 5 star for the type of venue they are"}
{"text":"Pros: Vegetarian option for the burgers, delicious shakes and occasional coupons make it affordable.

Cons: Can sometimes be messy (once there was ketchup on the seat and we often see food on the ground), and the entrees are just meh, although as I said the shakes are great."}
{"text":"I have never been to a Johnny Rockets so I have nothing to compare it to.
I thought the place was very cute, fast paced, busy.  We were seated right away but shortly after, we noticed a wait at the door.   It was a very busy time though.

Food was decent.   Kind a pricey but typical for this type of place.   We didn't get a chance to have a famous shake but I hope to go back and try one out.  Next time I'm in Glendale....  

ONLY THING that sucked is the restroom is a 1-potter, each.  Line around the corner for the use of both rooms and the ladies room was out of soap & paper towels.  Employees were coming in and out of the kitchen and I felt we were in the way standing there."}
{"text":"If only NO STARS!! 

I have never received this level of rude service, this takes the cake as number 1 worst experience.  By the way the couple to my left were not of the African American descent and receiving a better service. The couple to the right of me noticed the same as they were also receiving rude service.  I can understand a bad day but this was ridiculous. I walked away not eating and vowing never to come back. Horrible service and mishandling of the food.   

My fiancee and I decided to walk across the street from the Hard Rock Hotel and noticed Johnny Rockets to grab a quick bit. We weren't greeted but still sat down at the counter to eat, still no greet but luckily there was a menu available. So we waited about ten minutes as I observed three servers on shift. Finally, the gentlemen server approaches the couple next to us and says \"I see no one took your order yet\" it was pretty rude but true. After he took their order, I asked \"can I please place my order as well as I've been waiting,he replied \"I'll try\". He then takes the order and walks away to the back. So we waited another 10 minutes, I ask the tall waitress with red hair \"can I please get a water\" she gets it and slams it down. The couple next to us asked for their drinks and the waitress said \"I didn't take your order so what do you want\". So about another 15 minutes passed, in that time I observed the cook on his phone and then heading back to the grill without washing hands, bacon that wasn't properly cooked from a previous order placed on another order. I didn't walk away then. So I wanted to check the status of my order so I asked another server (short female w/black hair)about my order, she went to check and came back to say \"who assisted you\" I described the gentlemen with the glasses. She asked him about the order and he replied \"transfer the checks, I'm out\". To hear that upset me, I spoke my frustration  to the wrong employee. The female with the short hair was very polite and I felt bad that she had to deal with the rude service I was receiving."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, and the service was awesome. Fast, friendly, and affordable especially for being in an aquarium!"}
{"text":"Great service and good food! Always love an old fashion Vanilla Coke! Little pricey but not out of the norm for the area! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Absolute junk at spending $13 on a burger without anything extra and then two additional burgers for my son and my daughter I think it's a joke to the guy would spend $35 at this place in have to drink water one out of five stars thank you"}
{"text":"Okay so I haven't eaten meat in years & years, aka I've tried a LOT of veggie burgers. However, Johnny Rocket's new Gardein veggie burger is amazing!!! Best one I've probably ever had. Plus the girls & chef at this location are insanely nice & courteous. Good job!!!!!"}
{"text":"So yesterday we went to Johnny Rockets....
We walked in to staff yelling Welcome to Johnny Rockets yey it seemed like a party! A party for ME! So I was excited when the cook yelled find a seat anyplace you like. I thought Oooo! So I went over to where I wanted to sit and the husband followed. Once in the booth that was all mine I put down my coach bag and pulled out my phone and checked in and gave a tip on yelp.com then it happen.
 He walked over gave us menus and lord he was such a downer. Hello he said I said Hi. Can I ask you a question he said if a girl breaks up with you after you buy her a apple 5 phone and then text you weeks later and said she was thinking about you would you take her back?
 I replied NO you must love your self and anyone willing to drop you is not for you. But I can tell your gonna take her back because if you and I were on the same page you would not be messing with me doing my dinner time to bug me about some girl who don't want u. She texted you and said she was thinking about you not that she wanted you back. Find a church and something better to do with your time because this girl is not for u. He laughed and said other people have told him the same thing. So I took a moment to pat myself on the back. I told him hey other people and I cant be wrong. If a million people are telling you something must be some truth to it. 
After that he went on and on about this girl about 20 mins later He's using profanity like he's not at work and I said to myself he has 3 mins to get away from my table before I ask to talk to his manager. 
  I was able to get him to bring our burger fires and onion rings (Please see my pictures) Now the husband ate his food soon as it got their. I on the other hand had to see my food go from hot to room temp because skippie or whatever his name is ugh Is still going on and on about this girl and asking me about this and that. So he gets a clue to leave so...I eat...& Oh wow I was blown away at how good this burger is.
 I don't know if I have angered the God's this week or what but Boy with girl issues comes back and gives a ticket I'm like look I want apple pie and my husband wants a orange shake so he opens the ticket back up and bring us the sweet stuff and I'm like ooooo! Its got a tooth pick in my apple pie a la mode that's different. Now skippie gave me a fork I was like it's dessert love I need a spoon. I had enough of that boy to be honest with you. I hurry up and ate and ran to the car. The food is extra good I will return for take out Lord knows I cant eat inside with hover boy all at my table with his million of problems I feel like my food should have been free. He needs a therapist all his problems sound like personal problems and I'm not trying to be mean but I just wanted dinner just a great burger with my husband. I swear this town seems to be bad at dinner. I can never have dinner with my husband in a peaceful manner. That's it I am gonna learn to cook at home. Eating out is driving me nuts eather they cant cook the food or they cant leave the table. Tonight I'm having steak and I'm cooking it at home myself. 
My husband kept his receipt our server his name was Andre we sat at table 32\1 our total was $38.35 almost 40 bucks for a dinner that was great but failed because Andre could not leave his personal life at home ugh! Yes I took a picture of my receipt. I give 5 stars total the food was great I didn't care for everything else."}
{"text":"Johnny Rockets has been around for a while and it just continues to serve good food!

This location is located in Fashion Square's food court and here is what they do well.  Their menu is simple. You have burgers grilled to order, sandwiches, malts and shakes.  A few other things like fries and onion rings, but the menu is pretty straight forward.  

You can sit on a stool and have a more personal experience with your server, or order it at their Take Away station.  For some reason I tend to sit at the counter when I'm alone.  I know it's an illusion, but I tend to think I get my food faster by sitting here. LOL

I really love their Egg Salad sandwich.  I know it's silly, but it reminds me of eating in a Diner or a Drugstore back in the day.  The Malts by the way are outstanding and we have never, ever had a bad meal here.  Simplicity at it's best.

Yes, Johnny Rockets is A-OK in my book, and yes, I am a fan.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great food! Our waitress was outstanding! Didn't have to wait long to order and receive our food! Would much rather eat at Johnny Rockets then the cafe at Silverton. A little pricey but worth the price!! A must stop in for a good burger."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Johnny Rockets! Our waiter Cameron was very pleasant and prompt.  He got our orders right and checked in periodically to ensure we had everything we needed.  The burgers were amazing as always.  At the end Cameron brought us waters to go--a big plus to us Arizonans who are constantly battling heat. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Went here on Christmas Eve! So literally, plus one star for the workers for still being friendly when I'm sure most of them would rather be at home.

Ordered their classic burger and sweet potato fries. Added grilled mushrooms to it only to find out that it cost extra?  (They didn't really make it very clear on the menu that it would...wouldn't have ordered it if I had known. Food was decent but not worth the price.

I'd have to say that the atmosphere of this place is outdated in a dreary way. I didn't feel much old school charm. That plus the overpriced food...I wouldn't come here again unless the other restaurants in the area were full/closed. (Sorry!)"}
{"text":"Dad and I placed our order for 2 chili dogs...no one was in front of us but it still took 20 minutes to get our food!!!  I was STUNNED at the time it took.  The dogs were cold but the fries were hot.  Figures.   I will never, EVER, go to another Johnny Rockets again ~ I hate cold food and if it wasn't Vegas I woulda demanded a refund.  What a joke.  I feel sorry for the people that came in behind us because there were 10 people in the party.  I bet it took them 45 minutes to get their order."}
{"text":"Food is good and there is a moderate wait. Ordered bacon burger with fries (drinks are separate) $14 plus
Patty didn't have much flavor"}
{"text":"Way over priced ! No discount for people who are staying at the hotel . 3 burgers 2 fries and 1 milk shake $48.81."}
{"text":"I went in after school for a late lunch with a friend. The place was really dirty and the table that we sat in was sticky.

I had a St Louis burger and the burger was so greasy that it crumbled and fell apart in my hand. 

Also the waiter that served my friend and me had a really dirty and smelly apron you could tell that he had not washed it for weeks!!

I would definitely not recommend my friends to go there!!"}
{"text":"We frequent the Aliante for movies, gambling, stay-cations etc. My kids love it and I ALWAYS stop at Johnny Rockets in the food court for my fizzy cold Mtn Dew.  Elizia ALWAYS has a smile, is very friendly, welcoming, and more than helpful! If only, her friendliness and her smile was contagious! Shout out to Elizia and the rest of the staff! Their customer service always leaves me with a warm and fuzzy feeling! 

Plus, not only are their burgers, shakes, and French fries DELISH."}
{"text":"There is usually a Johnny Rockets at most casinos in Vegas. We have so far enjoyed all of them. This particular location needs to work on a few things. Our burger were burned every single time we ordered them. The customer service was the worst compared to all of the other locations. I would recommend spending more money at the restaurants the Casino offers over wasting your money here."}
{"text":"I work in the office building next to this mall so I have had a lot of experience with the food court.  Johnny Rockets is a great option if I get sick of Paradise Bakery or can withstand the lure of Panda's Orange Chicken.  I give this four stars based on the other selections in the food court.  You can get a nice sized burger, a BLT, even an egg salad sandwich if you are so inclined.  But what I really like is the grilled cheese.  Talk about a comforting lunch if you are having a bad day at work.  They use decent cheese and its not too greasy.  If only they served tomato soup..."}
{"text":"Great Bacon Cheese Burger, the bacon was crisp and the burger was done just the way I like it (medium well)."}
{"text":"My husband's burger was pink/red in a lot of areas! Mine was cooked thoroughly but hearing him complain about his, ruined my meal. I kept telling him to take it up to the counter but he didn't want to cause a fuss. He was afraid he'd have retaliation because you never know how the cook will deal with it. Know what I mean?
We waited over 20 minutes for a raw burger? We paid $35 for 2 burgers, fries and cokes? We weren't impressed."}
{"text":"I'm gonna say that I had the blandest burger I've ever had at Johnny Rocket's. Unremarkable but n and flavorless cheese.

We also had chicken fingers, which were perfectly fried, but bland. 

The staff were all teenagers and we were lucky that we caught their screwup I bordering before we paid. 

Won't be coming back..."}
{"text":"This review is based on two visits. Both times it took over five minutes for a server to stop at the table. Food was quick and tasty. After they drop the food, you're on your own. Hope you didn't drink all of that first drink they brought you because that's all you will be offered. Even though our server and others walked right by my empty glass, no offer for refill was made. Both times server came back after we finished eating to check in on the food. Bottom line is the burgers were pretty good but the service left a bad taste in my mouth both times. Can't recommend based on that."}
{"text":"They had some great food and really great service! Adrian and Zuly were our servers and they went above and beyond to law sure we had the best of the best of Johnny Rockets! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero I would. All because of DiAnn. She had a stank attitude in the first place. Her BRF was not just a look it was an attitude.  We stopped in before the Cardinals game on Nov 9. More than enough time to get a quick burger and get to the game. It's not like there's a big menu to choose from on game days you have a choice of burger or different burger. Started off with receiving the wrong drinks. 45 minutes later no food. We noticed that some of the people who came after us had received their food was eating and eventually leaving. The table next to use received just fries. We thought it was odd.  About the same time my table and the fries only table started inquiring about the food. The fries only table was told very rudely by the DiAnn, that it was ready. Which it wasn't. While \"Dirty DiAnn\" talked rudely to table 35 not offering compensation of some sort they like us were trying to get to the game on time. So as my husband was trying to find out what had not happened to our order we found out it hadn't been started. Then they were trying to waste time distracting from the fact the order hadn't been started and  if it had it would be cold. Now everyone knew DiAnn was messing up the whole flow of the restaurant. The manager was on the grill trying to get things right. So we didn't even get to complain to the manager. On top of everything else we were so hungry, we Paid full price for order no coupon or anything for future visit and they forgot to make my milk shake. So yep we were late for a game. Thanks DiAnn. Don't know if you were mad you had to work or what. You need to work on it. By the way eat in the stadium. Burgers are about the same size and you won't feel like you've wasted the price of game tickets because the wait of your order was too long. Fair warning #johnnyrockets @johnnyrickets really really really really up price their food on game day. Don't do it. Eat inside the stadium if you're hungry not JR."}
{"text":"My husband and I were really looking forward to trying this place out but were sadly disappointed. 

The burger patty was extremely thin... each bite was all bun. My husband's bun appeared to be stale. You'd be better of going to in n out nearby if in the mood for a burger. A burger should leave you full when you're done... We left feeling like we could eat more. 

I also find it necessary to note that when we left, there were no employees in sight, no cashiers, cooks, no one. They must have all been in the back. 

For the price and quality or lack thereof, we wouldn't be compelled to go back."}
{"text":"Not a fan of any milkshakes but the burgers, bacon cheese fries and floats are great! It is always crowded so service takes 20-40 minutes for a big table (5+ people)."}
{"text":"The food here is mediocre at best, but the service is amazing.  We were lucky enough to have Thomas wait on us. He was super friendly, very efficient and very attentive to our needs.  

I ordered the grilled chicken club sandwich on a bun.  The sandwich was a bit sloppy and the chicken was just ok.  The sandwich did come with bacon and it was flavorful and delicious.  If I had to do it over again I would just order a shake and forget the chicken sandwich.   All in all, the quick meal was ok in a pinch."}
{"text":"Longest wait I've ever had.  Literally made us wait for 45 minutes and the restaurant wasn't even packed.  Employees have zero sense of urgency.  Just avoid this place."}
{"text":"Okay folks I tried the Johnny Rockets and had the vegetarian burger with fries and a soda. first things first it cost almost $18 for that. Are you freaking serious Johnny Rockets. $18 for a veggie burger with fries and a soda. It was the worst veggie burger I've had in my life. They should have paid me to eat it. The people hardly spoke to you behind the counter. Plus the place looked pretty dingy. This was at the Venetian which is supposed to be a kind of upscale place. Now it's located in the canal Shoppes. Never go there ever. they should pay you if you come eat there. I threw over half of it away. Even the fries sucked and Fries never suck. Johnny Rockets definitely isn't what it used to be. Wish I could give it negative Stars."}
{"text":"$3.99 Deal of the Day, service not included...

I too came in for the Deal of the Day expecting a mob of people, but the place was just over half full.  We were seated at a dirty table in the corner.  Once we placed our simple order (4 burgers, 4 shakes) we waited. And waited. And waited.  The server explained that they were short staffed so I was ready to cut them some slack, but we continued to wait.  It took well over half an hour to receive our food, and we again didn't see our server again until someone else brought our shakes halfway through the meal.  

Thought the waiting was finished, but we were wrong.  We didn't see our server, let alone another employee, for quite some time.  All we saw was a near empty dining area that looked like a bomb had been set off, with almost every table in the place covered with dirty shake glasses and various other food debris.  We finally had to go to the other side of the restaurant to inform someone we'd like to pay and leave.  It was almost like it was an inconvenience to them to ask.  

There was no sense of urgency to any of the \"short staffed\" employees, if I had paid $4.99 or more for my meal I'd be a little more upset.  We weren't the only ones who left this place disgruntled, it's a miracle this location has remained open this long with this level of customer service..."}
{"text":"Was happy with the food although I watched the cook go and get a drink and not change his  gloves. The service was not what we expected . We went after a movie and it seemed like they were upset people were coming in , if you tried to sit somewhere other then where they said they asked you to move not us we sat where they sat us, I watched them do this to several customers. The moved the wait to be seated sign angrily right next to us. Also never got drink refills and napkins ."}
{"text":"Best food ever got a bacon 
burger not that much bacon on it asked the waiter if he could bring me more he just 
remade my 
whole burger thats what i 
call BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!! 
Me and my husband loved it and cannot wait to go back keep it up yall!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I see bad reviews...I was there yesterday..got there...sat down...there was barely anyone in there..no one came to our table for about. 8-10minutes, finally someone came..the girl was nice but never brought our drinks n water out. I was already eating and then she remembered she had not done so. Customer service sucked..but that burger with bacon n those fries were sooooo good!!!!! I give it 3stars and she got no tip from us btw."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Food took way too long. The staff was arguing in front of people. They were unorganized people that came in after us got there food before us.I really didn't enjoy my time here."}
{"text":"Shakes, shakes, everywhere.  If you want a great shake and lots of choices this is a great place for you.   This is a great family-oriented place and what I saw when I first walk in:  lots of children.  You travel back in time to a 1950s diner with nickel jukeboxes and waiters with the funny paper hats.  Burgers, fries, and shakes for the typical American meal.  The waiters may even put on a show and dance to one of the songs you choose from their jukeboxes.  For the first time, I thought I'd try \"The Original.\"  This burger is some greasy goodness.   The burger is so juicy and tender and I inhaled it so quickly.  The fresh vegetables make this burger a classic.  I think one of the reasons it tasted so well was all the grease.  Fat and grease may be bad for you, but it just tastes so great.   
 
There's a huge selection of shakes for whatever you're in the mood for.  When you get the chance, try them all!  I tried the original strawberry shake.  When it arrived, it came in a cool mug, and another cup of the extra.  It's big enough to share.  The real whipped cream was thick.  The ice cream was so rich, smooth, and thick.  The shake went down my throat so smoothly and there were no icicle chunks.  The only chunks is the small pieces of strawberry.  Yummy goodness in my mouth! 
 
Good burgers, shakes and fun.  My calorie count skyrocketed after eating here, but it's worth it just to let loose and forget about your weight for one day."}
{"text":"Good 50 ' s diner great food even late night. Fresh rolls on the Philly cheese steak.  Fries are nice golden brown.  That strawberry milk shake was not to sweet. It was just right."}
{"text":"These guys have been lousy lately but tonight we got fantastic service from Shelby.
I hope things are changing for the better here.
Its a fun place to  take the kids"}
{"text":"Food was expensive,  greasy and side of bacon was cold.  Would NOT recommend... Definitely try n look for another place to eat breakfast...  Had omelet w side of bacon (2 orders)  both were same poor quality"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this place. The burgers we got were so overcooked and absolutely flavorless.  While waiting for our food, we looked around and this place needs to close for a few days and do a top to bottom clean.  The floors were so sticky.  Tables were nasty.  I looked at every employee and it looked like they absolutely hated their job.  Being in the Westgate location, I expected it to be better.  Definitely will not be back."}
{"text":"So I haven't been to a Johnny Rockets for sometime . . . and now I remember why.  While the food is just ok . . . wow it is expensive for what you get.  So 2 hamburgers, 2 fries and 1 shake is $30????  Really . . . .its not worth it!

The $2 double double at In-N-Out is better than the $8 to $10 burgers.  Have to admit there are a ton of fries for $3 per order.  And the shake is ok . . . .but not worth $7.

The best part of the experience though was the service.  Our server Tianah was great.  She was the highlight in an otherwise less than ordinary meal."}
{"text":"I would consider avoiding this location if you aren't the type of person who likes to wait 30+ minutes for a burger and fries...particularly when it isn't busy. While the food is good, I watched one couple leave after a 30 minute wait and I did not receive my own food until about 45 minutes after sitting down at the counter. As a big fan of Johnny Rockets this was very disappointing. Hopefully the owners will make some management changes."}
{"text":"No a real JR menu.  No patty melt!  Seriously?   Fries were horrible and not seasoned.  Burgers were average at best.  

Avoid!"}
{"text":"Arriving very late from the airport, I received prompt and friendly service.  The chili is delicious when served with cheese and onions. The burgers are of course famous and this particular Johnny Rockets serves them right. 

However, the JR fries need an upgrade. Not crispy enough and not enough seasoning. For that I'm giving it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Food same as any other location but the service here is terrible with long wait times for food."}
{"text":"I walked into the food court today at around 1pm and I saw Johnny Rockets so I decided to get a burger. I wasn't sure what to get since all the prices were way too high and even with a hangover you can still see that. I walked to the pizza place, Chinese food and the hot dogs and I noticed all the prices were high so I decided to go back for a burger. I got a double cheese burger for $12 and only for the burger not even with a drink or fries. I was surprised when the cashier asked me if I wanted to add fries and then she asked \"would you like to add a shake with that?\" Really? So I ended up getting a burger, fries and a shake for $25+ which was way too much. I should have gone to McDonald's for $5. In the end, that burger came out looking real good and when I took a bite it was really juicy and warm which made me change my opinion about the place. I still say $25 for a food court burger and fries is way too much but I was satisfied in the end."}
{"text":"The shakes were amazing, we got seated right away, and the enthusiastic servers made the experience that much more enjoyable. Great place for a shopping day :)"}
{"text":"Decent food as expected.   They could cook their fries longer every time I come though.   Wait staff seem happy and helpful."}
{"text":"Food was great as always! They are super consistent (Ate at JR's Cancun, Royal Cruise ship, Flamingo, San Fran)

Best onion rings. Price is worth every penny.

Fashion Show Mall location. Staff was friendly, our server was very attentive. Food came out fast, shakes are super yummy."}
{"text":"Went to lunch there today and it was terrible first she took 11 minutes to bring the menu we get the menu and order drinks at the same time 2 shakes 2 water water cane out quick 1st shake took about 5 minutes second shake 15 minutes after when she brings the second shake she takes the order  ok fair so far just super slow..... French fries and cheesy fries take 15 minutes still willing to wait then the fries are gone and it takes 30 minutes for the burgers!!!! Now there was only 6 other people in there besides us ( party of 4 ) here it comes ALL the burgers wrong!!!! Girl says oops sorry I will reorder .... Heck no!! I said bring me the heck for the food we ate and we are leaving manager comes over says well I won't charge u for the burgers even though we made them ..... Really?  Never go back worst service slow slow slow and expensive!!!"}
{"text":"Our server was very friendly. The food and drinks came pretty quickly. Their strawberry lemonade is delicious! The food is just \"okay\" though, nothing special. My grilled cheese was almost flavorless, and the fries were fine. Not the worst restaurant in the world, but definitely not the best. Plus, it is a bit overpriced for what they're serving."}
{"text":"Two stars for the quality of the food!

Food is VERY VERY VERY expensive!!!

One burger will cost you $15!
Bacon cheese fries runs $6 (very small portion)

A burger, drink, and fries will run you $24!!!

I took a picture of the menus and posted here on Yelp!"}
{"text":"Hubby ordered the smoke house and loved it. I wasn't hungry so I ordered the chili and it was yummy! We also ordered the half order of onion rings and fries and couldn't finish it. Adrian was quick and very friendly. Glad we stopped here."}
{"text":"Here from Honolulu visiting. My boyfriend wanted to try this place out. Even though it's not a fancy restaurant like the others in the mall it's nice. It gives you the diner vibe. The service Tyler was great, always checked on us and gave us excellent service! The food took a little long but that was okay since we were in a rush. The food was great! It was a cute diner like restaurant for so good ole fashion burgers, fries and shakes!"}
{"text":"Prices not worth the product, should have gone to 5 guys. This location doesn't have the decor and 50's vibe that most locations due. Had a groupon, but spent much more than I saved. Not really anything wrong with the food, just not worth the price tag."}
{"text":"I ate here due to being in town and on business. I wasn't sure on what to expect. I have never ate at Johnny Rockets before.

I ordered a regular burger and a large soda. The Fry's are separate, yet I did not get them.

For the soda and burger I paid almost $9. The service was basic and nothing special. The place was clean and had a good flow of people. I also noticed several televisions in the place that were on.

Honestly I probably won't eat here again, the food was nothing really special."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience here I found hair in my burger and complained to A supervisor on duty Fabiola and she was not helpful at all. I returned my food and had asked for my money back and she rolled her eyes at me. I called to speak with the manager Saem this morning to explain what had happened and he was rude and hung up on me. I can't believe this company would have such poor management and staff. Disgusting! Never go here you will regret it."}
{"text":"I got a cheeseburger and fries and they are really good. The meat is never frozen and it's fresh. You can taste the difference.they also have salad here if you don't want a burger. The shakes have alcohol which is cool. I came here at 3:48am and they were still open."}
{"text":"This place has awful service. The last 2 times I have been here each time I knew exactly what I wanted to order right when the waitress walked up. Instead of taking my order I was told I needed to wait and they walked away and helped someone else. It doesn't make any sense if I was ready why bother talking to me if they weren't going to take my order. Tonight was the last night I will ever step foot at this location again."}
{"text":"No matter how many chances I give this place... It gets worse every time! 

Chili cheese fries were mediocre and the shake was alright. It was comparable to McDonalds, except McDonalds is cheaper. I'm serious!

Service was okay. The waiter was friendly. Nonetheless, I won't be coming back. 

No more chances for you Johnny!

Note: This is inside the Silverton casino. It's near the buffet. I suggest going there instead."}
{"text":"Love It Soo Much , i wouldve give it 5 stars but my burger was small than before . i wonder why!"}
{"text":"My family and I come here every once in a blue moon when we are at the mall and want burger. It's also not as far down into the mall from the shops we frequent. 

It's not a memorable experience. Just a place to get an okay burger, yummy fries and a milkshake."}
{"text":"Just like the other reviews say, Thomas is an amazing server!! Super friendly, super attentive (even though he was extremely busy), fast and spot on. The burgers were amazing? better than the fancy Burger Brasserie upstairs! Fries and tots were \"meh\" but the burgers...delicious!!"}
{"text":"DO NOT make the mistake I made.   We decided to order Breakfast / they had huge images shown looked good.
Well - the Pancakes were Gray !!  Not golden ---
But gray.   The didn't give me my money back because couldn't find the receipt, even though it was 1 months minute prior - I had to swap for some water.
One of the Workers decided to argue with me...She said 
\"Of course they are not golden, they are cooked in a microwave\".  - note the image on menu - Golden Pancakes.   Nobody stepped up to even try to resolve 
It politely.  Total lack of Respect and management.
Customer Service is non existent.   Another family was going through the exact same thing.   DO NOT EAT BREAKFAST AT JOHNNY ROCKETS!!!    It's awful."}
{"text":"Maybe it was because I was starving that night, or maybe it was because it was actually just really good, but I had a fantastic meal here! We came in at around 11 or 12, I can't even remember! All I know is that I was having a blast in Vegas and I started getting hungry, and this is the place we hit up. We had the burgers and fries, and they hit the spot. I would definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"It was ok! Have been here before it changed names and then did go back to Johnny Rockets. No one was in the place on a Friday night around dinner time. Placed order quickly. Chicken club with a side order if chili cheese fries and a strawberry shake. 
The shake came out pretty fast, not tasting too much strawberry. 
Chicken club came out with out any bacon so it was sent back. Bacon added. 

Watched employees stand around and chat. They seem to be bored and complained it was slow. Watched a cook add money to te jukebox with gloves still on and then head back into the kitchen. Did not observe him cook with said gloves but did bring it to someone's attention. Observed another employee comeback with ChicFila. That gave me some concern, but I have also worked in fast food and it does get boring after a while. 
Will not return. Just unsure of safe food handling procedures."}
{"text":"First off , I love Johnny Rockets and I have been to multiple locations ( az Mills is best !) I didn't think I would have a problem with this location . There are not as many options as other locations , WAYYYYY OVERPRICED ! 15.99 for a single patty burger and a handful of cold ass French fries ? What !??? THEN , talking to our waitress was like talking to a brick wall , ordered an over priced milkshake and never got it , then she tried to charge us for it . When I asked her take it off not even a single apology or if we even still wanted it !! To top off the experience we watched the table next to us accidentally spill their drink and had to wipe it themselves as staff stood around and watched. This place was a joke . I WILL NOT BE RETURNING."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch here today and our server Shelbie was awesome. She was quick and very attentive. She made great food suggestions and some delicious up sells. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"I found this place inside the Excalibur Hotel and it is not Johnny Rockets, they have the exact same menu as \"Breakfast and Burgers\" which is upstairs by the food court. Definitely false advertisement and I don't think a lot of people are catching on to this. I definitely know what food Johnny Rocket makes and this is not it. Trust me."}
{"text":"I would have given this place a 0 if it would have allowed me to. Check my check in for the whole story. Please, insist on making sure your order is put in. If not and your order is lost like ours were, it's on you! I'm being honest and trust me when I tell you we walked out after no food was ever served."}
{"text":"So I am a picky eater when it comes to some home made classic sandwiches but  I actually tried an egg salad somewhere other than my own kitchen.  This had been the first time I had tried a \"burger joiny\" egg salad and it was really tasty! Try it on toasted sourdough for an extra layer of flavor. After writing this review I really want another one right now :D"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery through Grubhub. Hubby liked the seasoning on the burger and I enjoyed my fish n chips. Kiddo enjoyed her corndog. Nothing fancy but tasty to say the least. We will be ordering from again."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Johnny Rockets experience.  Nothing to write home about as far as the food is concerned.  Our waiter was really nice though.  He was very attentive and friendly while he inquired about how we were enjoying out meal.  I got chicken fingers and fries which I expected to be very greasy due to the smell of burning oil in the air however they were not.  Worth stopping by if you're in the mood for something quick while at the Silverton."}
{"text":"Came to Arizona for a football game this weekend and was debating between which witch sandwich and this place since every other restaurant was ridiculously packed.  Anyway... I am not fond of giving low ratings to restaurants unless truly deserved. . 1. Service was terrible 2. They are under staffed 3. Food was not worth the wait AND to top it all off we got charged for 3 shakes that we did NOT order.. which delayed our exit. DO NOT COME HERE unless there's a zombie apocalypse."}
{"text":"This is the worst Johnny Rockets I've ever been to, and I usually like Johnny Rockets. The prices are almost double the normal price for other JR locations. 

If you are in the Venetian, and feel urge to get a burger, there is an in n out a couple of miles from here, far more superior and way cheaper."}
{"text":"Sh*tyest Johnny Rockets ive ever been to. As i sit here, writing this review, i can already feel the diarrhea brewing.  Service was lousy at best, u have to place your order like a McDonalds and pick up your food when its ready.  The cashier was very focused on talking to co-workers instead of doing her job.  I ordered chicken tenders and chili cheese fries.  Chili cheese fries are crappy here, they use cheese sauce, and pump it all over the place.  Absolutely DISGUSTING, if i wanted sh*ty chili fries and diarrhea, i would have gone to del taco.... Even del taco uses shredded cheese!!!!...smh. I would like to give Thomas credit, (think he was a manager) he was the ONLY person that went above and beyond, ONLY person to check in on us, and the ONLY person that seemed to care about his job and service provided."}
{"text":"From 5/27/15
Came here because we had my boyfriends dad in town, and since he had never been here I went along for the ride. Johnny Rockets is located in Palace Station Casino and Hotel, off West Sahara Ave. I got the Bacon Cheddar Single; it was good. The restaurant is clean, and I really don't have too many complaints."}
{"text":"I love this places food and atmosphere, I've been coming here since I was a little girl. However during my most recent visit we received horrible service. Our server was slow, paid no attention to us or the other patrons, and we had to ask for things he should have anticipated like utensils and napkins. The counter was filthy as was the rest of the restaurant. The other patrons had to walk over to our server to get their order put in. We were left waiting quite a long time for our bill. The server seemed more concerned with chatting with the cooks than doing his job. I was incredibly disappointed with my visit. The only reason they are getting 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love their food."}
{"text":"Very good burgers!!  The food court takes away from 50's feel of other locations. The portion sizing could be better, but overall a great place to grab a good burger!"}
{"text":"We were here on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch early dinner.
Place was pretty full with a few tables waiting for their food.
We were greeted and given our menus pretty quickly and our order was put in fast enough too. While we waited for our food, I decided to go through the reviews on the restaurant. Everyone's review was pretty similar. Good food, good service but very slow. I thought, we'll see. 

We waited for a very long time before our food came out. Our server was courteous, she came to us a couple of times to keep us warm and make sure we know our food is about to come out. 

Eventually the food came out. I ordered a rocket single, no cheese with an addition of chili and a side of fries and my husband ordered Route 66 with fries. Both were delicious but honestly too small for the price. We were hungry so we literally finished our food in 5 min. Believe it or not, we were still hungry after we finished! 

Overall, the reviews were correct. Good food but very slow service (by the kitchen). Excellent service by servers and slightly pricey menu for the portions."}
{"text":"Fun place for a quick burger before seeing a show.. Paige was great...served  us with a smile! We were a little cooky and she was still as sweet as could be! Good prices... good food...great shakes.. fast family fun!"}
{"text":"Johnny rockets was just okay, the place looks nice but the price was over price and they don't have meal combo price, plus the food was pretty messy and me and my friends could probably make a better burger."}
{"text":"Lulu and Isabel are the best. Had a 6:15 movie to catch and they got our dinner in time to eat even though we ordered at 5:30pm. And it was so good I would have taken a pic but we ate it.  Lol"}
{"text":"only had iced tea and my son had a milkshake.  The tea was weak, but the strawberry shake was pretty dang awesome.  Pricey as Vegas is.  (saw the blue man group later that evening, good show, but again pricey)"}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick breakfast place and came across this place in the food court which also had a buy one entree get one coupon from Venetian Grand Canal Shopping funbook. Well, it is probably the only thing that's good about it. The omelet were awfully greasy and nothing tasteful with those greasy eggs. We cannot even finish half of them. I guess you get what you paid for"}
{"text":"AWESOME EXPERIENCE today! Justin was our server & was EXCELLENT!! Our food came quickly & was hot eventhough they were very busy. Bravo Johnny Rockets!!! Well done!"}
{"text":"POOR SERVICE today. It took 50 minutes to get our food! The manager took $9.00 off our bill. She was nice but should have comped the entire meal! Gloria was our server & had a PATHETIC ATTITUDE!!!  We will never go back!!"}
{"text":"\"Onion rings!!!  Can I get onion rings?\"  My little cutie pie asked loudly as if my ear's not deaf enough from all the noise.  It was the weekend before Thanksgiving and I had a bright idea to have dinner at San Tan Village.  Never again!  

We ended up here after snobbing the long wait (1 hr) at Gordon Birsch.  We shoulda waited!  My hubby's burger might have been sitting and waiting for about an hour.  He complained how cold it was.  I had a not-so-bad patty melt...it's a patty melt, what else can I say?   My son wanted chicken strips with his onion rings.  At least he liked his order.

I do like the fact that they hire teens.  Great stepping stone to the work force.

Overall, it's just okay.  The shakes are better than their food!"}
{"text":"Alright so I only give this place 1 star because it wont allow me to put 0.  I visited this location over the holidays and let me tell you this will be the LAST LAST LAST time I even walk near this place.  I was with my gf.  She ordered some chicken and bacon club sandwich with onion rings.  When she got her sandwich I can see she wasnt impressed.  She claimed the chicked tasted like a rubbery shoe sole.  When she took the chicked off the sandwich i tried a piece and honestly it felt like i was chewing rubber.  We complained to the waiter and was given her meal for free.  

I ordered the burger with bacon and cheese with fries and gravy.  Lets start with the gravy.  Although it did not taste bad it looked like water with brown food colouring.  The burger it self was HORRIBLE.  I have had my fair share of burgers and this is the top of my list as one of the worst burgers ive had.  The burger tasted like it was cooked on the flat top with NO added flavor.  It was straight up minced meat.  It was dripping FAT.  I finished it because I was starving from a day of shopping at the mall.

Who screws up a burger lets be honest.  Come on guys get your shit together.  When the coca cola was the best part of the meal you know there is a problem"}
{"text":"I have tried to eat here off and on for the 8 years I've lived here. NONE OF THEM WERE FULL ACCLOMPISHED TRIPS! I tried to order something just on the 4th of July. They weren't all that busy so I walked in and sat at the bar next to the TO GO register. I was in a hurry to get back to work because I only have 30 minutes for lunch. I was greeted by a hefty young man and was told someone will be with me shortly. Ten minutes come and go and the same large waitress walks past me 4 times without a hello and I can't seem to find the young man, on top of this the very freakie store manager is behind the counter helping prepare orders, which are flying off the counter fast. The manager looks at me often and never does anything but stare at me like a creepy old perv.! 4 very loud women run in to the opposite side of the counter and the large waitress tells them hello and they quickly place an order for fries and onion rings. Shortly after the 4 women pay for their order the large girl walks away like I wasn't sitting there, with a menu and waiting for *someone*.

This place can go to hell! I'm just going to act like this place never existed and warn others to do the same."}
{"text":"I've frequented this Johnny Rockets about half a dozen times in a nostalgic attempt to relive my trips to Johnny Rockets as a child (there was an amazing one in West Edmonton Mall in the late 90's/early 2000's).  I think it's finally time to admit that the magic is gone.

First of all, let's talk about the jukebox situation.  They have mini jukeboxes on the booths, but they aren't functional.  It used to be you could put a nickel in any one of them and request a song.  Now, you have to walk away from your friends and use the main one.  Granted, it's free, but it's still a disappointment.

Next, let's talk singing.  I remember being delighted when the staff would break into song when something came on over the speakers.  It was a spontaneous and glorious thing.  Now, it's very rehearsed and planned (and they even interrupt your jukebox selections to put on a pre-selected song for their choreographed routine).  You can see the dread in their eyes when they realize it's time for them to dance to 'Sugar Sugar' again.

Now, I don't remember what the food was like, but I'm certain it wasn't this mediocre when I was a kid.  The milkshakes, while incredibly delicious, are crazy expensive for what they are (I think I remember in the ballpark of $6.50 for one of their \"deluxe\" milkshakes).  However, I will give them an extra point for having cherry coke.  I can never entirely fault a place that serves cherry coke.

The serving sizes are tiny, and the prices are astronomical.  A party of four quickly adds up to $80+ after tax and tip, which is a little insane when it's essentially slight fancier fast food.  Also, they always seem put-off when I tell them not to make the smiley face with ketchup for us (my boyfriend doesn't like ketchup, ok?).

I have some friends who love the place, and I have nothing against going again if it were suggested.  It's just no longer a desired treat as much as it is a convenient place to eat."}
{"text":"This place is TERRIBLE.   I ordered chili cheese fries and got American cheese fries.  I asked where my chili was and they were like \"we don't have chili.\" WHAT. Then why did you take my order for CHILI cheese fries you stupid .  They call my name for my order, I go up to take and some girl comes up and takes it right from my hands. WTF.  THEN, I ordered a classic with NO ONIONS and they had to redo my order TWICE because they couldn't get it right.  The manager was some Asian guy and after I walked away I heard him talking to another customer about me and they were all just sitting there laughing at me.  The manager was an idiot.  Well, everyone there was."}
{"text":"This place looked like it had promise so despite a lackluster rating here on Yelp we decided to try it. The burgers were nothing special and the fries were very generic. Neither the burger or the fries were bad, they just weren't good either. The service was not very good. They took a long time before they even talked to us and that was to ask if we had ordered already, they didn't know. We had not ordered so we eventually got 2 menus (we got 1 at first and the waitress had to go find another). When the food came it was dropped off abruptly and the server quickly disappeared. The best part of my meal here was the milkshake. I got a peanutbutter and chocolate milkshake that was really good (but for over 1000 calories it had better be). As much as I liked the milkshake the other food and the service means I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Waited 12 minutes to talk to a waiter and an additional 44 minutes later for food delivery, which kept it under an hour from door to eating. Food was good with a friendly waiter and hope you have time to give , because the kitchen always seems backed up...."}
{"text":"Ol school, good old fashion fat and grease just like a burger should be. Visiting Vegas from your Healthy California lifestyle? This place might kill you, try the subway up the street. Want a fantastic burger you'll love while you're eating it, but regret later? It get's no better than this! Sit at the bar and you get amazing service. Since it's themed from the 50s, I had to do an old fashion meal; Big burger, frys, and a malt. Hang out if you can, every few songs the staff goes out and dances. It's on the strip so don't expect to drive up and park, but if you're walking, you should stop in and play a few songs on the jukebox. 

Service...........5/5
Food...............5/5
Price...............4/5
Parking..........0/5
Atmosphere.. 5/5"}
{"text":"I'll make a list

Service- Meh. 
Burger- too small and too greasy
Fries- cold, soggy and dry
Hot Dog- over cooked 
Shakes- decent
Price- too much for bad food

Since being taken over J.R. has gone down hill.  Id rather go to in and out, look at a more simple menu, pay half the price and eat better tasting food."}
{"text":"I went here because it was new.
It looks nice inside and they have a lot of food to choose from.
It's really expensive for what you get.
I got my milkshake which was small and really good.
I got my burger and fries and the waiter came out and drew a smiley face with ketchup :)
My cheeseburger was ok, but I have had way better for the price.
For the price they charge it should be top notch burgers."}
{"text":"I know the ratings at this place was low, but I usually like to ignore any reviews from others until I give it a try. The place was not poppin like other restaurants, but I like the oldies decor. The place was real clean. I know it's ironic being that I'm from Houston and I don't want to sound biased, but I ordered \"The Houston!\" Burger was only a 1/4 lb, but it was quite delish. Juicy and has a real good kick from the jalapeños and spicy sauce. Fries here are just that...fries. For a late dinner and a quick fill up, I cannot complain. Onwards to some desserts next!"}
{"text":"Sooooo slow. Nobody seemed real concerned about getting our food out. Never got refills on drinks and had to wait over 30 minutes for our order. Stay away!"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever had at any restaurant. Took forever to be seated then after getting seated 
it took forever to get waited on. Bathrooms were very dirty you stuck to the as if they had not been cleaned in a very very long time."}
{"text":"Burgers were good. But all in all kinda pricey. Will go back to try the shakes."}
{"text":"Terrible food, extremely noisy. Fries came out way early and cold by the time the burgers came. Albino Boca burger looked and tasted like a freezer burnt corn tortilla. Hamburgers burnt, only 6 fries per kids order. Laughable."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner here with my friends.

Going to the Odysea Aquarium and Pangea was a lot of fun which is something the same odysea aquarium complex which also included Butterfly Wonderland."}
{"text":"Johnny Rockets is one of the original burger joints that everyone talks about, which is fine. I don't think it affects how I feel about the place as well as the food. Upon entering, you get that old school diner feel, which is exactly how it should be.

Service was good and our server was apologetic when our shakes came out late because they didn't have any whipped cream. No big deal. However, you can tell that the server was either new or nervous. Didn't flow very well, but I don't mind it. 

I have to say that I really do enjoy their sweet potato fries, but their burgers are just way too oily for my liking. You take a couple bites and oil is just dripping onto your plate. Overall, the burgers are good, not amazing. And their shakes are good as well. Not anything too special here, but it's good for a bite to eat with family."}
{"text":"I had no idea this was a Johnny Rockets. I was over looking the receipt and saw the name on the bottom, I was surprised. Besides that, the restaurant was very clean & looked good. The burgers definitely had a good taste of them, but the fries were a bit salty. The drink station was pretty cool, there were about eight different flavors to enhance your drinks. Overall, next time I want a burger and I'm in the area I will probably stop here versus anywhere else. Great job JR aka Johnny rocket"}
{"text":"Love the bottomless fries but the burgers are not very good at all, also slow service. The shakes are exceptional."}
{"text":"Service was slow. It's like they didn't even notice us when we walked in. We just stood there waiting for someone to acknowledge our presence. Took about 15-20 minutes to be seated. Our waiter was really friendly, but the food was only \"okay.\" 

My fiancé and I got the rocket burger. Not the best burger I've ever eaten, but the price wasn't too bad. 

Also, we ordered the brownie sundae..and for that price..we thought it was going to be a lot better. 

Oh well. :/"}
{"text":"EEh it was ok. I don't care for it."}
{"text":"Waiting 30 minutes and still no food. The cook is busy on her cell phone. I had to ask for the food to go because I needed to get back to work. The couple next to us got their food before we did. All we ordered was 2 burger meals and chicken tenders. Purchased at 1206pm. Still waiting at 1238pm! The place was not very busy either. This is ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Food was okay it earned the 2 stars. The wait staff is horrible. Had to ask for silverware, had to ask for napkins and I had to walk up my cup for a refill."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  I don't know how they are still in business.  Wish like hell I would have waited in line at in and out. Stale food dry burgers."}
{"text":"I would give this place no stars if I could. Sat at the counter thinking we could grab a quick bite. The place wasn't packed, a few customers but by no means busy. Sat there for about 5 minutes, no menus, no \"hey, be with you in a sec,\" not even eye contact as they walk right in front of you! Literally, 3 servers walked right past us as if we weren't even there. The manager and a server stood by the cash register (which is probably 5 feet from where we were sitting) and talked to each other the whole time. Needless to say, we got up and walked out.

Do yourself a favor and go eat at the Sundance Grill in the same casino. The burgers there are awesome and you'll probably get served in this lifetime."}
{"text":"When your shopping and get hungry for a burger this is the place to go. You have no other choice actually when it comes to burgers at fashion show lol"}
{"text":"Last year I remembered it tasty and fresh! Just normal this year during rush hour at noon...:-("}
{"text":"You guys do realize that this Johnny Rockets is at a mall's food court, right?  The service isn't going to be the best."}
{"text":"I used to go to Johnny rockets all the time, quality of food at this location wasn't good. Milkshake was good as usual.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Listen. Because I'm only going to say this once. If you are ever near one. GO. TO. JOHNNY. ROCKETS. Aside from the absolutely adorable 1950s decor... their Service, Namely the one at the Santan Village Marketplace in Gilbert Arizona, was worthy of a 6 Star plus rating.

Then there's their food. I built my own basic burger substituting the American Cheese for provolone and it is literally what I would call the perfect burger. And let's not forget one of their staples... their shakes... AMAZING. And their pricing is quite reasonable for the type of restaurant Johnny Rockets is. My Meal, Burger, Fries  and Shake were only about 20 dollars. And that's for a proper burger. Not like an average fast food frozen meat patty from McDonalds Burger

Please. Go to Johnny Rockets. Don't take my word for it."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Johnny Rockets in such a long time. We decided to eat here today because I had a bogo hamburger combo coupon, so we got two hamburgers with fries and a drink for $12. Pretty awesome deal, but not convincing enough to make me give this place anymore than 2 stars.

In the past when I've gone to Johnny Rockets, I wasn't in love with the burgers, but I still thought they were very good. When we got our food today, it looked and tasted like they really downgraded their quality. Look how boring and lifeless my Route 66 burger looked: http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ewjc4OdQ5_ENVV5dUtoN_g/l.jpg. The buns looked like they were kind of smashed and there was a ridiculous amount of cheese inside (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6EO2CMyCBaEiSAYIMjGHjg/l.jpg). The only thing I really liked about my burger were the fresh mushrooms inside. Majority of the fries that came with our meals were undercooked or soggy. Don just ended up eating the two ends of each of his fries (weird, I know). 

I don't think I'll be dining at this Johnny Rockets again and it makes me a little skeptical to try any of the other ones."}
{"text":"They are ridiculously slow. They are more concerned with their side work than helping customers to get food. We waited in line for over 30 minutes just for them to take our order when we were the second people in line. The worst fast food place I've ever been to."}
{"text":"I come here from time to time during my lunch break and it usually has super fast service in and out within 30 mins. Today it was jammed packed and super busy. I had to wait a minute but the manager came up and apologized himself for the wait and said my food would be right out. It was, but made incorrectly (that's ok) had to send it back and was apologized too and given a discount from the events of today. Their service exceptionally good today, and of course the food was as always."}
{"text":"We've been to many Johnny Rockets and this one was the worst. The service is awful. A small stack of pancakes the size of a sausage patty for seven dollars. I don't mind paying, but when they're reheated, hard, and old, it's a problem. This location needs a serious update on service and food; it gives a bad reputation to the franchise."}
{"text":"Have been here twice and both times th kids running the place a. Got the order wrong and b. Served us burgers that werent cooked.

In fact, while I was there I saw the staff screw up a little kids ice cream, he asked for chocolate and they gave him vanilla. How do you do that?

Considering the price, the place is a joke. I cant believe the management doesnt get involved. Not only will I not be back but I would literally eat Burger King before I ever returned.

Consider yourself warned."}
{"text":"Really good burgers, great onion rings.  Price of bottled water real high but we just asked for ice water and it was free..  We split a burger and it was really enough without over stuffing,  ill definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Got the sweet potato fries to go as we were staying in the hotel.  The fries tasted like donuts,  couldn't figure out why they didn't taste like sweet potato fries, but sweet like donuts...well that's because they make Krispy Kreme donuts there as well. I am a sweet lover, but this was a bad combination of flavors.

The next few days were busy so two days later I returned to get a refund on the fries. The server told me no, as I should have called right away and returned the fries. I was supposed to save the fries and carry them down 19 stories in the elevator in order for her to believe me. 

Lesson learned, read the reviews before eating anywhere."}
{"text":"This place has great burgers and small lines compared to a lot of the eateries in the food court. I had a bacon cheeseburger and it was juicy and cooked perfectly. My lunch was the envy of everyone at my table. Just like the scene in the Indiana Jones Last Crusade the Guardian of the Cup for the fountain of youth encouraged Indiana Jones by saying \"You must choose, but choose wisely\".  So even though the line wasn't long at Johnny Rockets, I chose wisely. 

Another added feature is free refills on your soda. This is especially useful when you're not the one shopping and have at least an hour to kill. Guys, you know where I'm coming from about that endless shopping drill.

{"text":"They have a great place right on center stage. We were hungry and had to wait but the fries were hot and theu chicken strips were wonderful. They serve with Ranch sauce what a great idea and a refill on the drinks too. Could not be nicer. Everyone was smiling and happy."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. We ordered  shakes it took 30 min to get them . We got are food befor we got the shakes . Talked to the manager.  He comped are shakes. He shouldn't have to do that for a bad watrress.  She still hasn't come by to see how I meal was . If it wasn't for the manager.  I just wouldn't have walked out."}
{"text":"This is the Johnny Rockets inside of Kennywood. 

there is a line that you have to wait in, place your order, and then they give you a number to take to your seat. Someone comes around and drops off your food/drinks, and takes the number. 
This place is constantly busy, but being one of maybe 2 or 3 inside restaurants that Kennywood has, it's no surprise. The food is very overpriced for what you get, though. I didn't think what we got was worth what we paid.
It's also VERY dirty, considering 95% of the staff work behind the counter. tables don't get wiped off in a timely manner, so you are either waiting for a clean table, or cleaning one off yourself."}
{"text":"I agree that it is overpriced for the quality of the food, but everything on the strip is overpriced, tourists should know this. I have been coming this location for a while, the service wasn't that good. But the last 2 times I went the service was better. My visit on 11/5 morning, their was great service and even considering it was busy they did a great job! ....horrible onion rings though, I will not recommend."}
{"text":"On our last day at Mandalay Bay Convention Center, we hadn't eaten since breakfast and needed a little bite to eat so I found the food court outside the convention hall near the Shark Reef attraction. 

I ordered two burgers and learned that they do not just sell burgers. You have to get a burger with fries. Everything is so overpriced! The burgers sadly, were quite undercooked. I ate some parts of the perimeter of the burger but couldn't eat anywhere near the center. It was gross. It was such a long walk to go back to the food court from where our booth was, so we just said screw it and threw it away.  $29 and change for two undercooked burgers, fries and one sprite. Yucka!"}
{"text":"Klassischer Burgerladen der gleichnamigen Burgerkette. Man kann nix falschmachen: Cheeseburger, Pommes und ein Bier oder Milchshake - und mal ist gut versorgt. Vorsicht: speziell hier hohe Getränkepreise wegen der Stripnähe: 7,50 USD für ein Miller Light. Wer wie ich völlig erschlagen nach dem Flug nachts in Vegas ankommt, genau die richtige Anlaufstelle."}
{"text":"This place is inside the Flamingo Hotel  food court. Second time I have eaten at this place. 

They are going for the 50 style diner experience here . You sit right at the counter and the soda jerk comes and helps you, I guess that's what they called them in the 50's? Dressed from head to toe in white ,wearing a paper hat. and black bow tie.  

They serve your American comfort foods here burgers, malts , floats, flavored sodas, and hotdogs. I got the rocket double w/ fries .Inside the bun is  two 1/3pound patties  with  cheese,  lettuce,  tomato,  onion & special sauce. 

Burger comes out quick and stacked high. Burger was cooked to perfection and juicy. Great burger joint don't really need 50's theme but they produce good food at a good  price. Also the service  was great and quick."}
{"text":"I walked in on my lunch bc I was craving a burger, there was at least 5 employees in the restaurant. I made eye contact with at least 3 and none of them greeted me. One girl was at the counter talking to a guy who seemed like a customer at first glance but then I realized they new each other and she was having a personal conversation. She finally acknowledged me and said she would be right with me but by that time I decided to just take my business to chipotle! I probably won't try and eat here again and certainly not recommend it"}
{"text":"On first walking in, BAD. Floors were dirty, pictures hanging on the wall were dirty. There were four tables sitting down eating, six tables were dirty/un-bussed. Service very slow. I ordered chicken strips and the food took about 15 minutes, but our malts/milkshakes didn't start arriving until 10 minutes after our food. No exaggeration. Our server asked what I wanted as my dipping sauce when I ordered my food, but I had to ask 4 times for afterwards. By that time my chicken strips were cold. My shake didn't arrive until 20 minutes after our food was delivered. No exaggeration. I was looking at the time. My husband ordered a burger with a fried egg on it. They were out of eggs. Server asked what if anything he wanted in place of egg. My husband said jalepenos. Burger came out without jalepenos. Husband had to ask twice for jalepenos. My In-laws ordered Butterfinger malts. There were chunks of apple in both of their malts. My Father-in-law got down to the bottom of his malt and found a large piece of napkin in it. Disgusting. By that point I was just getting my ranch for my food and JUST getting my shake, but obviously had no appetite. The manager came to our table and tried to pass off the napkin in the malt as a plastic straw wrapper. Seriously, I could not make this up if I tried. Beyond  unimpressed with the managers proffessionalism (lack there of). It was obviously a napkin. It's one thing to get bad service, but it is very apparent there are some extreme sanitary issues going on there. I will NEVER be returning to ANY Johnny Rockets."}
{"text":"Our burgers and shakes were OK, but outrageously priced! Even with a 2-4-1 coupon, our patty melt and cheeseburger with 2 shakes cost $21 - for a food court?! 

Just doesn't make any sense when the Outback is a few blocks away, and has very good burgers!"}
{"text":"Came in on a Wednesday evening 7 pm was seated fast  , place was clean server was super nice  and waited 5 minute's ordered food it came out fast and tasted good  overall great experience A+"}
{"text":"Stopped by a few nights ago, had been to a movie and JR was on the way to my car. I felt like a burger and some fries, so I heeded the call from Johnny Rockets. Not very crowded, maybe a half a dozen or so people at tables, a few more at the counter, looked like some of the staff had just got off for the night as folks in JR attire were busy eating. Waitress/hostess seated me, got me some water and gave me a few minutes to decide. She was cordial and friendly. I ordered just a regular burger and some fries. I was surprised how long it took to get this small order, a bit over 15 minutes. Maybe not long but in that time I only saw one order come up on the line. anyway, seemed a bit  slow but I may be wrong or just over anxious. The burger came along with the fries. It was good, nothing better than good, lots of toppings a bit messy which is fine, nothing wrong with that. About regular in size, maybe 1/4lb. or so. Fries were again, good, but nothing special. All in all for the just under $8.00, it was an OK meal, I was going to say a quick meal, but, it took over twice as long to get as it did to eat, so I have to leave it at an OK meal.  I would go back, the setting is fun, the folks that work there look like they enjoy what they are doing and are friendly, the food price is reasonable and the food is OK. So, there it is an A-OK rating"}
{"text":"Am I the ONLY one that finds it bizarre that you have to order a side of fries with a burger??? An a la carte hamburger, are you kidding me? This place was a joke. The food was cold, the service was horrible and apparently there is only ONE person who knows how to make a milkshake as it took over 30 minutes for us to get ours. 

Please don't waste your time OR money here. Head down to the Yardhouse and enjoy a REAL burger/fries as well as excellent customer service. You won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"I was stunned by photos on Yelp of smiling patrons sitting in booths and at tables at this Johnny Rockets. It is not a free-standing restaurant, it is merely a store front in the Scottsdale Fashion Square mall Food Court. Yes, there are some bar stools along a short counter, but most patrons will be stuck sitting in the Food Court. 
The shakes are now $4.99 for a basic chocolate, strawberry or vanilla and $5.99 for premium shakes like oreo cookie shakes. The basic hamburger is $5.99 and most burgers are in the $7 range. The food is OK fast food. I was a little surprised that the french fries were cold. 
Since this is just a store front, there is no interaction with the staff, other than the person who takes your order and hollers your number when you are to come and pick it up and walk it to your table.
I am puzzled by all the other Yelpers who talk about customer service. What on earth are they talking about?"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch with my daughter and 2 year old granddaughter. We were seated right away and our server was terrific. I had the smokehouse cheeseburger. It was done the way I like my burgers and came with unlimited french fries for a little more than $7. My daughter had the chicken club sandwich (it was huge) with a side salad for a little over $8, and my granddaughter had the chicken fingers with french fries for a little over $5. We had to ask for a to-go box for all our leftovers.
The store is clean. The music was classic 50s and 60s rock and roll. It was a lot of fun."}
{"text":"messes up jakes order and overpriced sodas and almost everything there is too expensive"}
{"text":"BEWARE!  DISHONEST MANAGEMENT AND CORPORATION.  inspect your receipt carefully......I stopped in the restaurant at the Venetian Mall,  The manager charged me OVER THE PRICES ON THE LISTED MENU. When I complained she said that was company policy at this location....I called the franchise owner and he said he would mail me some free meal coupons to compensate.  That was 6 months ago and they still have not arrived.......I left 4 messages at Johnny Rockets Corp headquarters with customer service managers and franchise managers, and none returned my calls....They are a company that does not care for honest service or customer satisfaction.  BEWARE!"}
{"text":"Pretty overpriced burgers! They are on the tasty side. The cashier was kind of rude and impatient even though we told her it was our first time there.

Between the price and the service I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Honestly, for the price of this food i expected a little more. This is a typical fast food place but one person will pay like 20 dollars. It wasn't even that great.... I'd rather have paid more for something better."}
{"text":"This was the only place open past midnight with food available. I order the burger and fries. The burger reminded me of a MCD burger but the prices were jacked up because it was in the hotel. The only reason I give this place 3 stars is because they were open when all other places were closed for business."}
{"text":"I like Johnny Rockets, but this location sucks.

You're paying a premium price for a certain experience, and then the experience is lost because of the space it's in. I'd be pissed if I dropped $100 on a steak and then was handed a paper plate and told to sit and eat it on a park bench next to homeless deviants. This isn't much better."}
{"text":"Solid Johnny Rockets location.  Plenty of seating.  Service was friendly and not too slow.

Lots of bad reviews here, but I had a good experience.

It was A-OK!

3 stars!"}
{"text":"Mmmm I love Johnny rockets.  $22 gets you 2 orders of burgers fries and a soda. Groupon had a discount so check it out.  I hate pickeles but it was just so.good in my burger.  Sometimes it can get very greasy but they made it just right this time around."}
{"text":"The cirumstances: it was late, and I was starving. When I'm at home, it's no problem to whip up something to eat or go to Zippy's at 1am. Not so easy when you're in Vegas and don't really know what's around.

I found out there was a Johnny Rockets in our hotel (Flamingo) and I actually saw an episode of \"Undercover Boss\" where the CEO of Johnny Rockets was on, so I decided I wanted to try here anyway.

Speed-wise, I feel like it could have been faster, but I'm kinda glad they don't mass produce everything and have it sitting like McD's. Prices are okay. I was VERY happy with their patty melt and fries. Nothing like a greasy cheesy burger-type sandwich in the middle of the night! Also got a milkshake the last night which was good.

All in all, super convenient and open at all hours. I liked the Flamingo and having Johnny Rockets right downstairs is a big plus!"}
{"text":"Bruh this place is expensive for the quality ... I like johnny rockets but this place is ehh.. $30 for a veggie and an original burger and 1 drink and 1 fry was too much especially since the burger was cold. 

We had in n out the other day and got more food for less. We came here cause it was close to the aquarium. Also they do not have tuna melts and other stuff"}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever!!!!! I mean horrible!!! I was outta town, trying to get a nice juicy burger in my belly, after being in traffic all day! I arrived and sat at the bar, since.. I didn't get greeted by anyone. Sat down. 2 minutes later a waiter comes to me and says.. Are you ready to order? NOOO!!!! I just sat down.. 

Ask for water.. And didn't get my water until my food came to my table. The burger had so much mustard and mayo.. It was disgusting! I told the server that my burger wasn't good.. He offer to issue a refund. Then, he brought my change back.. But, never gave me a refund but, actually gave me less money!!!!! I was totally shocked. I told him about the money issue and he kept insisting he gave me the correct change? I told him to check his cameras and continue to argue with me, from across the restaurant he kept arguing with me. 

I think I need to call corporate to report this issue. This happen (last Saturday night) maybe they can watch their cameras!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this location. The staff could be more friendly. My sandwich was a little overdone, but my chocolate shake was great! xD"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and there food is delicious staff friendly I really like it I'll be back every time I bee in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is dope if you have children. I took my niece for a late lunch yesterday and they were really cheery and nice at the beginning before they got a tad busier then it was a little hard to order anything else from the server I think she was alone the managers didnt seem to be doing much. The server was very helpful they even give you nickels for the juke. I had a grilled cheese on sourdough with fries it did the trick. I like Johnny Rockets, for first timers its even better I like to see kids happy faces."}
{"text":"Not a bad burger

My nephew really enjoys Johnny Rockets burgers so occasionally we find ourselves going there.

The food is good especially for the price. The shakes are unbelievably good and the service is second to none. Our drinks were constantly filled  and  our server made sure we had  everything we needed to make our dining experience a positive one.


I would recommend Johnny Rockets to anyone who wanted a good meal at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Worth A Visit 

 My nephew and I stumbled accross Johnny Rockets after spending the day at Westcourt, and I am so glad we did. 

The food was really good especially for the price, the shakes were unbelieveable and the service was second to none. Our server (Beth) went out of her way to make sure our food was exactly as we wanted and that my nephew was having a great time.  Our drinks were constantly full and Beth made sure we had everything we needed or wanted.

I would truly reccomend Johnny Rockets to everyone. If you want good food at a reasonable price in the Westcourt area, give Johnny Rockets a try."}
{"text":"I gave this place 2 stars and that was probably generous but the food and shakes were really good. The service, server and the manager who spoke to us was awful. First problem was that we waited 25 minutes for chili and a burger. I had to go myself to get a refill for my pop. When we told the server the issue he got really standoffish and mean. We then talked to the guy mgr and he was rude as all get out. I am pretty ticked and will never come here with friends and will tell everyone this service is awful"}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would. This place should be professionally embarrassed. I thought rockets were fast, this should be called Johnny Snails. Had to wait 45 minutes to be seated. There's 2 people working in the joint who kept saying \"thank you for your patience\" but never sat my party down. The meat in my burger tasted like it was out of a can. Buns soggy, vegetables turning brown, ALL BAD. If you're ever in the Scottsdale area, do NOT go to this location. It will make you wish you stayed home

{"text":"First off, $7 for TWO DRINKS?! Smh. 
Breakfast was bland and not much to choose from. Staff was uninterested. 
Thought this would be a better alternative to the buffet in the Luxor but I was wrong. Still overpriced and definitely not that good at all."}
{"text":"We had lunch here on 11/8/14.  No wait for ordering or seating or at the counter which is what we opted for.  We had a BLT and a Club.  Neither were anything special.  They'd forgotten our fries and olive/pickle on the blt.  No big deal, but seemed odd since it was pretty slow."}
{"text":"This Johnny Rockets is at the SanTan Mall by the theaters.  Like any of their locations, burgers and shakes are their thing.  The original burger, chili fries, and chocolate peanutbutter shake are good stuff.  The wings are not worthwhile though.  It's a family or casual place, grab a burger, and see a movie right across the walkway.  Worth stopping by."}
{"text":"It's been less than a year since my last review, but with such a large change in performance I decided I should note it.  In the past I was always happy with this place.  They're just a burger joint, but there were a good burger joint.  And fun.  Dancing, ketchup drawings, etc.  I always rated them well.

Not this time.

I always order a burger here.  That's what they do, right?  So my burger comes out...first I asked for a double patty, but didn't get it.  They offered to re-do it, but I just emphasized they better not charge me for the double.  Which they didn't.  The burger itself didn't seem as if it just came off the griddle.  Not piping-hot.  The French fries were just sad.  They were warm, not hot, and no subtle 'crunch'.  They were not fresh from the oil, they'd been sitting a while.  

And they no longer have the dark chocolate shake!!!  Just the Hershey's regular chocolate shake.  That was something I always looked forward to here, and now it's gone!  I can get a burger anywhere, it was the combination of the burger with the dark chocolate shake that kept me coming back.

My wife thought the brisket tots looked good (and the picture DID look good!).  Well, it was nasty.  The brisket bits were sliced like bacon, were only slightly more tender than jerky, and there wasn't very much brisket.  The dish was mostly tots, and they were covered with this semi-congealed gunk that was supposed to be a cheese sauce.  Very poor performance (1-star for this one!).

And then the staff didn't dance once while we were there.  I know they have work to do, but in the past we've always had at least one (and often two) dances during the time it takes to dine here.  Not tonight.

No dark chocolate shake, no hot-fresh fries, one completely nasty entree, and not even the fun atmosphere...one more visit like this and I'm never coming back.  There are too many other choices to put up with this."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday at 3pm.  I had a Chili Cheese Dog without onion & Sweet potato fries.  The portions were not bad. Service was great & friendly.  I would rather visit this location even though it's small & inside a casino. It's clean. This location serves Pepsi instead of Coke Products because that's what the casino serves."}
{"text":"Great Burger spot inside of the Excalibur! But do I think it's worth the expensive price? The jury may still be out on that because I will say that for the prices they are charging I know some of the un named competitors who will give them a run for their money with the same prices if not lower! But on the flip side this is located on the strip inside a casino so expensive prices come with the territory! My meal came up to $22 for the burger mixed fries/onion rings and a drink! Would I return? Maybe..."}
{"text":"I am giving 5 stars because of a server I had, named Tom who served me around lunchtime Sunday 9/13/15. He was fantastic and had the best enthusiasm I have every seen. He knew how to treat the costumers and other employees. He always made sure I had everything I need and had an honest smile on his face. He made me feel like I was eating at a 5 star restaurant.

This guy could seriously  motivate crowds of people. I felt like he gave me luck on the tables just from his personality and enthusiasm. I shook his hand and told him that he should be running a company. He was professional, approachable,positive and sincere. This guy deserves to be a general manage or possibly even higher. If I had a business I would pay this guy to come join me.

I hope the people at HR or CEO see this  and reward him for amazing professionalism. Tom is the best server and generally  the best guy I ever met and he deserves better then to just be a server in a food court inside a casino hotel."}
{"text":"Around noon time and there were only two people running this joint so therefore they were slammed. I ordered their veggie burger with an Oreo cookies n cream shake. I enjoyed the sweetness to this burger and had some of the fried mushroom along with onion rings and tots basket that my mom ordered. The mini juke box on the counter took our 5¢ without playing music. The shake was too sweet for me to handle."}
{"text":"Not sure why today was better than all the other times. I always remember johnny rockets in cali having terrible service. Pretty damn good"}
{"text":"Food wasn't good. It had overcooked hamburgers and undercooked fries. Server was sweet but not very good. Only plus was milkshakes above avg and food came quickly."}
{"text":"I'm now reviewing food court eateries.  Clearly my social life is lacking.  However, at some point we're all faced with eating at one.  I was at Macy's lamenting that all the clothes I would like to wear are not flattering of my current body type.  Might as well have a cheeseburger.  Their burgers are not bad actually.  They remind me a little of Sonic burgers if that helps.  Better than Burger King or McDonald's in my opinion.  Fries are thick cut which I am not a fan of. but they are okay.  I like that I can get  a cherry Coke.   They make a good grilled cheese, too.  And no, I did not have that as a side to my cheeseburger!"}
{"text":"We actually like this franchise and are genuinely excited every time one crosses our path. During our trip to Vegas last fall we dined at Johnny Rockets. At that time we didn't have any groupons or discounts, so we ended up paying full price for or meal. Being that this is Vegas, we knew that the price would be inflated, but we didn't expect it to be quite as high as it was at that time. We noticed that some chains in Vegas stick to their standard pricing without inflation (i.e. Chipotle) but Johnny Rockets is not one.

On our second go round, during our most recent trip to Vegas, last month, we used groupon and it made a world of a difference. After paying for my groupon, my total came to $0.96 cents! Now, I'm not all about penny pinching on my vacations, but when there is a deal a deal like this, why wouldn't you take advantage?

The food here was solid, no complaints. I ordered a veggie burger and my husband got a cheese burger. They will substitute fries for a side salad, per your request also. The customer service here is a little sketchy. Each time, they have been okay but not overly nice. I wouldn't normally draw this assessment regarding customer service but, I kind of get the feeling that the staff all hate their jobs here. At one point a few of the employees danced to an old school song which was cool, but it was also a little different because this is not a typical Johnny Rockets, being that it's located in a food court."}
{"text":"This is the Johnny Rockets at the Flamingo. During my recent stay here, you would find me here at 5 AM for coffee. It was basically my only choice without a longer exploratory walk down the Strip. The java and service was OK, but isn't it interesting at this hour that it's easier to buy a mixed drink than a cup of coffee?"}
{"text":"The mushrooms & Cheddar burger was simple amazing!! Service (Johanna) excellent, poor girl, have to talk or attend some drunk guys....anyway fast ... Nice place to kill the munchies!! 

Tip 45% 

Will return 100%"}
{"text":"The location is in the food court at the Luxor hotel so you won't get the same 50s vibe as other Johnny Rockets.

And of course being on the Las Vegas strip everything is overpriced.

Burgers are okay. Don't seem to be the same quality as other locations I've eaten at."}
{"text":"AWFUL. Seriously, don't even waste your time. This location is extremely overpriced, the burgers don't come with fries included (extra $3 if you do want fries), and the tables and floor are not clean. The place could redeem itself if the food was actually any good, but sadly it wasn't. Very basic hamburger (smokehouse) with little flavor, which is surprising considering all of the toppings that come on it. If you have $9 to spend on a burger here, go find another restaurant to give your business to."}
{"text":"30 minutes to get fries and a burger. Guy handed me my order with a lukewarm apology but no one asked how they could make it right or offered to DO anything to make it right. Seriously, 15 other orders after mine were distributed while I stood there. After 6, I started asking where mine was. 

Won't ever eat at one of these places again. First visit. Only visit. You wasted my time and disrespected me. Bye."}
{"text":"There really are no words to say how bad this place is.  Been here several times out of convenience but it never gets any better just worse.

My son and I came in and sat at the bar hoping service would be a bit quicker.  There were likely 10 people in the place, 1 waitress, one guy at the grill and someone who later indicated that he was the manager.

after about 5 minutes, i walked up to what would normally function as an ordering station and the waitress indicated she would be right over...yeah...a waitress to take your order at the bar.

it took another 5 minutes to get our orders in and i noticed several seats of \"left overs\" sitting to my son's left on the bar.

Drinks came fast enough....then it was the great wait.

After about 15 minutes the waitress came over and indicated that our food should  be right out (needless to say, I'm looking at the grill...and the guy can't seem to do more than 2 burgers at a time.

15 minutes later, I've had it.  I've been watching the manager and the waitress chit chat up around the POS system for about 5 minutes without a single order going out.  I go over and indicate that I've been waiting 30 minutes for two simple hamburgers.  They go over to the grill and tell me that it will be a few more minutes.

I look over the bar, its not filthy, but certainly not clean. The left overs that were there when we sat down are still there, and ask to speak to the manager.

The kid with the greasy hair and mid sized gagues in both ears indicates that in fact he is the manager.  I made it clear that his operation of the establishment were well below par. I pointed out that we had been waiting 30 minutes for 2 burgers and that none of the left overs on the bar had been moved in that time.

I slapped down a 5.00 bill to cover the drinks my son and I had and we walked out.  

I would love to say that this was an isolated experience. However; we've eaten here a half dozen times and its never never fast, frequently we've had to buss the tables before sitting down, and from here on it, I've made the decision that no matter how convenient...its just not worth the agrivation."}
{"text":"While visiting the mall stopped in for some lunch here, cute counter style seating.  We sat down and we're approached by Jesus for a drink order, as I'd just sat down and hadn't looked at the menu I asked for a moment, not even 30 seconds later he's back, still hadn't opened the menu!  After a few mins he came back, we ordered the tater tot nacho things, Chicken bacon sandwich and sliders.  Tot dish was disappointing to say the least, picture showed fresh guacamole, chopped tomatoes and crispy tots, reality was soggy tots, mushed tomatoes and guacamole that looked brownish and came from a tube, too many jalapeños and cheese sauce, didn't eat half of it.  Moved to burger and after bite or two realized no bacon in my bacon chicken sandwich, could not get Jesus attention so waited several minutes for someone else to notice me and come over.  He asked if I just wanted to wait a few minutes for them to cook some bacon, ah no I said I'd prefer it was just recooked for me.  Took few minutes for new burger, came out juicy and fresh.  Sliders were nice.  
Personally we did not enjoy the service from Jesus, I prefer a server that's more genuine and authentic and does not linger too long, also it bothers me scooping ice to the rim then adding a squirt of soda, few sips and it's gone.
Check came out and I just about died of shock!  The tot dish and sliders had no price in menu, both were $9.95 each!  $50 for a burger, potato side and soda at a food court?"}

{"text":"Went here after a hard night of partying and ordered the bacon cheese burger, onion rings and dark chocolate malt. The burger and the malt were excellent, but the onion rights were a bit of a letdown. I was really hoping for some battered, freshly made onion rings but what I received looked and tasted like it was directly from the supermarket freezer section. Really good service though! I'll return and order the fries next time!"}
{"text":"My first time here and I found the atmosphere very laid back daddy-o. No problems with the food to report. Compared to Jack Astors (upstairs) the portion size is small (much less fries). But the change of decor is well worth it.  Try and find a coupon online to take the small sting from the bill out."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a shake after a very terrible experience at the Vegas location last weekend. Three different people greeted us. It was so very welcoming. Also, the shake was amazing!"}
{"text":"Sometimes a little slow in seating because the place is busy but worth the wait. For a fast food restaurant, the kitchen staff does an outstanding job. Our order came out quickly and as we ordered it. The manager keeps everyone on top of things and the facility is clean.
Would highly recommend to anyone coming to Westgate for an event or for shopping."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. My experience is less than stellar. The doorman is as enthusiastic as a mortician with less personality. Service was horrible--- really horrible! Nobody came to our table to ask for beverage orders until I went to the grill to ask for a server. The same doorman, who I asked politely to find our waiter, just ignored me and seemed indifferent. 

Fortunately my food was good. It's really sad when a place with good food hires employees who just don't care."}
{"text":"Four stars for the cheeseburger. It had been a long while since I had a Johnny Rockets burger. In fact, the last time I had Johnny Rockets was in college! However, during a recent shopping trip and movie night at the mall, we stopped by for burgers before the show. This is a delicious burger! It is juicy and has the special sauce and is just fatty goodness. It's definitely worth the visit if you're in the mood for a juicy burger on the go."}
{"text":"Worst service. Ordered a shake and it sat there 20 minutes until we asked if it was ready yet and then they gave it to us... seriously?!"}
{"text":"I used to come here very often. They constantly would mess up my orders, they are over priced and the customer service is bad at times. A normal sized drink is over 3 dollars and a burger is like 10. The fries are dry and very bland. One time i got my order messed up and wanted a refund and never got my money back. I rather go to McDonald's or Sonic to get food than go here ever again."}
{"text":"Not sure if Rodney F. is talking about the new location at Odysea in Scottsdale but if so I couldn't agree more! Although they said it was owned by the same franchisee as Fashion Square, food tasted different, service was terrible. Employees arguing with each other, guy in the kitchen getting orders out is screaming across the restaurant for servers to pick them up. This was right in front of people sitting at counter. Never going back, will make trip to the mall, and by the looks of how slow it was on a Saturday I'd say they need the business."}
{"text":"My son and I told our server we were going to put some nickels in the juke box.  Less than two minutes later we returned to our seats which had been cleared of our meal, our souvenir movie cups put in the trash, and new people seated at our seats.  The server handed me my bill and said sorry, bus boy took your stuff.  The manager was nice about it and refunded our meal, gave us a coupon for a free burger.  My son thinks it is fun so we will go back but be warned, don't leave your seat even if you let your server know.  You could end up losing more than your movie cups!"}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick bite to eat, with my daughter and friend. Nothing fancy. The service was good and the food was made to order. Very satisfied."}
{"text":"The fries were terrible, there are no free refills, burger was just ok, and they have false advertising with the free milk shake!! Don't eat here ever!!!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. Their logo says that they are \"The Original Hamburger,\" but I think they should check with Louis' Lunch in New Haven, Connecticut about that!"}
{"text":"Everything from the customer service to the juicy burgers made my experience a 5 star review. Definitely would go back."}
{"text":"I love the burgers...soooo delicious. Shakes everything is yummy. Kids love it. Fresh and fast. Great service."}
{"text":"Open until 10pm....if u get here at 9:50 don't plan on getting any food from the grill. I realize they close at 10pm but I come from old school customer service. If a customer comes in 1 minute before closing they should still be afforded the same menu options as all others.  Not so with Johnny Rockets. So much for dinner after a movie."}
{"text":"Fast service, good fries, below average burger. For $9.50 you would expect a decent burger. I had a cheeseburger. Cooked beyond death. A very thin patty even crispy from being overcooked. On a fat tasteless white bread bun. If I had not been so tired and hungry, I would have sent it back and asked for a refund. Carls, In and Out, even Mcdonalds is better."}
{"text":"Johnny Rockets in the United States is definitely no Eddie rockets in Ireland. I expected the burgers to be of similar quality and the experience to be kind of the same. Unfortunately the burgers at Johnny Rockets don't quite match up to their Irish counterparts.

The location for this Johnny Rockets is in side the Venetian Hotel in the food court area. The staff are prompt and friendly and Burgers tasted very fresh. If you're looking for a quick lunch and don't want to spend over $15 then this is a good place to grab a burger fries and a drink."}
{"text":"Wow - what a difference a year makes.  Gone is the table service, not to mention the free drink refills.  All self-serve and grossly overpriced fare.  Extremely disappointed as a dining gem in the park has been reduced to an expensive, yet forgettable experience."}
{"text":"Quick simple review. Food court Johnny rockets in meadows mall. Our server Jesus I believe his name was, was excellent. Breathes quality service. His personality was on point and made it fun. He wasn't bothering us and took great care of us.

Banana milkshake was thick with chunks of bananas and I love that. Plus the fact they had a veggie burger there for me to eat was a huge plus.


Only negative thing is the burgers don't come with fries. He asked if fries were ok with my burger. I assumed like any normal place the fries would come with the meal. Well me and my partner were charged for tots and fries. If I knew they didn't come with them I wouldn't have gotten them because they aren't the best to start with. So an extra 9$+ on our check wasn't appreciated. You should let them know it doesn't actually come with the burger and they will be charged. Never been to a place that does that and not tell their guests. Been here three years and this is the only place I've been to where fries aren't included....

Again just that was one thing that could have been avoided. Other than that. I would def come back when I'm at the mall for sure. Better than most other places in the food court!"}
{"text":"Service was awful. They gave us a pager to notify us when our food was ready. After 15 minutes we came from our table to find it waiting. They forgot to buzz our pager and served us the room temp food."}
{"text":"It was horrible when they first opened (took well over an hour to get our food), but this year they significantly decreased the menu and cut down the wait time quite a bit. Some of my favorite things from normal Johnny Rockets are gone, but if you just want air conditioning and a basic burger, fries, or shake, they're much  better than they were before."}
{"text":"VERY YUMMY for a late late night dinner if you're lazy and don't want to have to leave the hotel. I got the patty melt and fries to share with my boyfriend as a snack at 1am. It was SO GOOD. And we were SO glad that it was open (because not much else was!)

Service was just O-K, but it was fairly fast.

I'd definitely count on this as my late night food place while I stay at the Flamingo again!!!"}
{"text":"The burgers are so good. We got the sweet potato fries to go with our burgers. The food was really fresh.

What put it over the top was our server. He was so nice and stopped by a few times to make sure we were taken care of.

Go by, sit at the counter and make sure Gerald is your Server. He made the visit all that more enjoyable."}
{"text":"Well it could be that I was really hungry, but dang the food was really good, better than I remember. 

Yes it's inside the Venetian, so it's more expensive. The fantastic friendly service helped with that. However, they are on Groupon and yes I had one.

Good food, great service and clean, stop by for a great burger."}
{"text":"Cool place! This used to be Johnny Rockets! Now it's called JR's Burgers. They have a very simple menu and the burgers here are delicious!"}
{"text":"Today I had the horrible expirence of  eating at Johnny Rockets. Courtney was our server and needs some serious training on how to interact with customers.. We ordered a child's grilled chicken meal for my son.. When it arrived it had fries instead of Applesauce and celery. Since I remember from the menu it was supposed to have celery sticks and applesauce I called Courtney over. I explained I rather him have the applesauce and celery and asked her if she could take the fries back. She said since I already had the fries she couldn't exchange them. I told her it was an error on her end since I wanted what the menu stated it came with.. She said okay pick celery or applesauce.. I showed her the menu and it said AND, she said well the menus wrong he only gets one plus kids eat free on Monday so it's not like I'm paying for his meal.. I was appalled. First off I had no idea kids are free I didn't mind paying for his meal but I want my 1 year old to have healthy option not French fries and since the menu said both I expected both... She took the fries away and just brought back applesauce not celery. After that she never came back to our table. My drink sat empty for 26 minutes until she brought the check she never refilled my drink.. I asked another waitress to fill by soda and told her my waitress apparently didn't want to fill mine... If this is the way Johnny rocket handles business I'll never be back..."}
{"text":"There is no secret why this place is only 2 stars as an average. Excalibur needs to tell these jokers to shape up or ship out. It is a disservice to customers of the Excalibur to keep this franchise inside their casino. It is expensive as far as burgers go, yes it is Vegas it can be expensive but give us our money's worth. I am complaining because the effing burger buns were stone cold when served. The burger patty was OK that's why I still gave it 2 stars, but how can you enjoy a burger if the buns are not grilled or steamed or made warm one way or the other? Just burgers, fries, and drinks for two guys cost nearly $35? In Vegas I could have eaten in a more grand manner at the Orleans or other places, even at Grimaldi's pizza at the Venetian. Not coming back here at all."}
{"text":"What...the...hell? I'm pretty sure the only smiles here are the moment you leave. Considering this isn't a traditional Johnny Rockets format, meaning you walk up to a counter and order (no waiter), the price is outrageous. We ordered two burgers, fries, two waters and it was $36! 

The fries were rock hard and tasted like old grease. I give them an added star for having a decent burger, but even the menu is weird here compared to regular old school Johnny Rockets. 

Kinda sad, and for the price I could have eaten at a real sit down chain. Sheesh..."}
{"text":"Okay service, the server didnt have much of a personality but the food overall was good."}
{"text":"Located in the food court area at the Flamingo hotel. 
They were open pretty late when I went there. It was after midnight. 
You place your order at the counter and you get a beeper to let you know wen your food is ready. 
Seating is just some cafeteria style tables and seats. 
Good for a late night snack or meal."}
{"text":"Love me some Rockets. Reminds me of the Hollywood Blvd Johnny Rockets in LA,...the best shakes every time!! Burgers, fries, everything is always great,..and can honestly say that customer service is always \"top-notch\", very friendly service!! I've never had a bad experience with food or service"}
{"text":"Great server always when I'm served by Mai
She was professional kind and always has a smile on her face. The food was decent for the amount of money it did cost but she made it worth it."}
{"text":"Had a simple burger,  and fries. To my surprise the food was hot, and was very good.  Great service!"}
{"text":"I hate reviews that say this, but I'm giving this location the dreaded \"I wish I could give zero stars\" comment. My Mom and I were shopping and decided to grab lunch. She ordered and original and I got the bacon cheddar, both with tater tots. Our server was Anna and we saw her when she took our order, brought our food, brought the check, and brought my Mom's change back. We were done eating when she came back and asked if we wanted a refill, so my Mom asked for our refills in a to go cup. Empty drinks are a huge pet peeve for us. The food was mediocre...neither of our burgers had any sauce on them, and we were done eating by the time she came back to check on us. The service here sucked and so did the food. Luckily we don't visit this mall often, so we definitely won't be back."}
{"text":"Ended up going here after knowing we needed a cheap meal, starving from driving 10 hrs from Los Angeles (yes, traffic was horrible that day!).  We were staying at the Venetian, so we just walked over to the mall's food court.

Exceptional food.  Service was great.  Couldn't have asked for more!  Would actually bypass some fine dining options, considering you're actually getting what you pay for (and not getting gyp-ped by some stupid expensive hotel restaurant!)

Unique in terms of the food court, because it's the only eatery in the court that had barside seating and service (yet the prices were still the same if you wanted to do \"to-go\").  Their shakes are AMAZING.  SOOOOOO good!!!

Thanks, Johnny Rockets!"}
{"text":"I brought my kids here for dinner before our movie and will definitely return. Calvin helped us and I was touched by how friendly and warm he was toward my kids. I would say the service here is much better than you'd expect from a food court."}
{"text":"Kassandra was very respectful, and attentive to my order which had many of my own customizations, and she got them all right and the cooks did well preparing our burgers, although it's a bit pricey, still great burgers! Thanks!"}
{"text":"Although my husband is a big fan of Johnny Rockets, he was entirely disappointed by this joint. Our waitress was nice but didn't seem to care about her job. When my husband ordered what he thought was \"ultimate fries\" (loaded fries with cheese and bacon), the waitress didn't bother to correct him and instead brought us \"unlimited fries\". When she brought out the wrong order, she also didn't bother to offer to fix the mistake. 

As for the food...my patty melt and my husband's philly cheese steak were both greasy, small portions. If I wanted to lick my lips clean of grease after every bite, I would've ordered a stick of butter. 

This place has only earned 1-star because of its 5-star milkshake... But how can anyone screw up a milkshake?"}
{"text":"Upon arriving at this location, I was looking forward to enjoying the great food I have received at other locations. However, I sat for 10 minutes without receiving service and walked out. There's no meal worth tolerating that kind of customer service for. Would not recommend. Take your money to another burger chain like Culver's or Wendy's."}
{"text":"They goofed up my order and had to remake it. By the time I got my food most of my friends were close to done eating... They made up for it by giving me a free next meal. I guess we'll see if I use it."}
{"text":"Haven't got my food yet but Tom has given me no choice but to leave 5 stars. To put it simply Tom is by far the best server I've ever had."}
{"text":"Tom is are server. He is so efficient and courteous. His personality is great! He is really on top of everything. Top notch server. Thanks Tom."}
{"text":"Tonight my boyfriend and I went to this location to have dinner. We waited patiently for a table which was fine and normal. After standing for about 10 mins we were told that we would be helped in just one moment. Okay awesome. Anther 5 minutes go by. These girls cut in front of us and got a table. Servers didn't say anything. We finally got our table and was waited on for drinks very quickly. We knew from our last experience that it was going to take awhile for us to be able to order our food. Then the time came we finally order our food including a milkshake. You would think the milkshake would come out right away. We wait 10-20 minutes to see if we would get our milkshake. Didn't happen I had to ask my server when my milkshake was going to come out. She say she would bring it out in a few minutes. A few minutes went by no milkshake and still no food 40 minutes later after being sat out food finally came out and so did the milkshake. The customer service here sucks. The servers can't even do their jobs the cook would yell out their names to come get their customers food. It got to the point the cook was cooking and bring out people's food as well. This place has really gone down here. I don't recommend this location to anyone unless you have an hour plus to sit around and wait for your food."}
{"text":"The absolute worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. 1130 am Sunday afternoon, about 7 total customers, 8 people total working there, one of which appeared to be a manager and we were not even acknowledged  for 10 minutes. Not a hello, not a drink order, but they seemed to be having great conversation with each other! The food staff were talking loud and about raw explicit content. I actually had to get out of my seat in the middle of eating and ask them to stop. I am sure the 7 year old child sitting at the counter didn't need to hear that either. The cooks were yelling loudly for a runner while 2 employees just stood there,  again pretty sure 1 was management.  What a show and an awful experience. Blatant disrespect to the Brand."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  It's clear Johnny Rockets has fallen off the Burger Glory list it may have one time been on.

I ordered the Smokehouse Double which is supposed to have BBQ sauce on it.  I had them swap in Sourdough bread instead, horrid call on my part.  Sourdough was so hard it was scratching the roof of my mouth.  It was so flooded in butter as well, my hand ended up covered in grease.  The burger had no flavor and no bbq sauce.

The fries were good.  We all agreed the Wisconsin Cheddar was a bit over powering.  The outdoor area was filthy,  and I mean filthy.  Surprise Westgate tolerates that mess.

The one shinning star was Clemente our server.  This gentleman was HUSTLING!  He was swamped and not a single cup on my table went empty.  He was prompt,  friendly and had great customer service.  He deserves a better place.  He bumped it from a 1 star to a 2.  Although he himself was a 5 star

Red Robin is a much better choice."}
{"text":"Came here to eat with two kids. Ordered meals that would qualify us getting two FREE kids' meals but credited only ONE. The excuse was that I would have to buy two sides if I wanted to get two free kids' meal. There's nothing stating about ordering sides on the promotional add that was posted on the window. What a bunch of BS!!!! If they are pulling that stunt, then no more trips to JR."}
{"text":"So having Johnny Rockets at about 5am is not to bad. Even though I was a little intoxicated. So my gf, good friend and I get into the flamingo were there Johnny Rockets is located. We were surprised to see how many people were in line. So we decided to sit at the bar and have a server rather then stand. So from the time we sat down our server gave us menus pretty quick and took our order fast too. Now idk what they do in the kitchen but I'm almost positive it doesn't take 45 min to make a burger and French toast. Though it may seem like a weird combo it's actually really good. So after waiting forever to get our food we finally eat and finish and get ready to pay and our server was no where to be found. 20 min later she arrives and gives us our bill and we pay cash to leave fast and not have to worry about waiting any longer. So in my opinion this place had really good food just had very slow service."}
{"text":"It took awhile to get acknowledged that I was here.  Yet once I was talked to, the service was fast and friendly. 
Burger was large and tasty, fries were perfectly crisp and hot.  The lil crushed ice in the soda was cool to chew on a lil bit.
I was checked on often after my meal was served.  I only wish I had belly room for dessert. Darn it. I wanted pie."}
{"text":"I 110% agree with Elysia. I also work in the mall and my coworkers and I have been to Johnny Rockets a bunch of times combined. 

I can say that I have had one semi-decent experience out of ten. The customer service is HORRIBLE! I always order the veggie patty and twice they messed that up... I call in all of my orders and being placed on hold means listening to the hostess take other peoples orders while the phone sits on the counter. Shortest amount of time you'll wait is 5 minutes, so you'll want to hang up and call back later. The staff always seem to be in a bad mood, their is no sense of urgency, and very disorganized... come on! it's a burger joint! And they dance?!?! 

Last thing I will say is considering my coworkers and I used to always order from Johnny Rockets, you would think they would remember at least one of us and not look at us like complete strangers when we go to pickup our order. 

The sad thing is, I love Johnny Rockets, but will not be returning to this location. I will take my $13 else where..."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout for lunch for the office. I ordered a patty melt with pepper Jack cheese and sourdough bread. It was pretty good, but I wasn't impressed with the fries or onion rings. Fries were soggy and onion rings were the kind when you bite into it the onion easily comes out.  Not impressed. 

One co-worker ordered a bacon cheese burger and cheese fries. She had ordered the cheese fries before and it had originally had cheese sauce over the fries. This time it just had melted cheddar over the top and they were definitely not as good. Consistency is very important as if she had known it was just going to be melted cheddar she wouldn't have ordered them.  Her burger was pretty good and it was very big.  

The next co-worker ordered a chicken Philly sandwich and it was terrible. All bread and grilled onions. The chicken had no flavor and did not look like all white meat. She cut each bread slice in half and had enough bread/onions to make a complete other sandwich. She was really disappointed that it was so terrible. She took a few bites but she couldn't even finish it. 
Another co-worker ordered the BLT and fries.  The BLT was good but the fries were too soggy again.

All in all this place is ok for burgers/patty melts/BLT but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here. Becuase you can find a better burger for cheaper at a wide variety of other places. 

Most importantly I expect consistency when I go to a place. It's so frustrating to order something and get it one way one time and a different way the next.

Even with the limited choices that we have for lunch near the office I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"Well I ordered bacon and cheese fries but was then told that they were out of bacon. No big deal, I downgraded to the ordinary cheese fries, which looked very promising. But they tasted pretty terrible, the cheese sauce was disgusting and I can still feel it just sitting in my stomach plotting to ruin my toilet here soon. 
Service was less than great, our waitress forgot to give us menus and asked if we knew what we wanted even though we had no menus to look at. She \"could've sworn [she] gave [us] some.\" She also had to come back and ask my friend what he wanted for a second time because she forgot. Bruh. However, she was always nice and seemed fairly competent, perhaps just having a bad day or a derp moment as we all do from time to time. 
Overall, I was not repelled by the service, but rather the nasty cheese fries. I usually enjoy the rest of the menu so I'm sure I'll still come back, just keep that cheese sauce heated and stirred regularly, and above all else keep it away from my fries."}
{"text":"I guess I never reviewed this place. Well I went again today because i needed to go to the Alltel store (which relocated) and was hungry. 

I had the $5.99 single fries special. The burger was thin and over cooked, asked for Medium, they added onions when I asked for none, (did I mention I was the only person there while he was cooking my burger?) the bun was fresh and the flavor was ok. 
The fries were good but really who cares they are frozen fries. 
The Sprite was kept full but should be at $2.59 lol 

Total $11.09 for a shitty burger and fries, and a sprite. Skip JR and go to Johnny's of Chicago down the road and get a hand pattied 1/2lb flame cooked burger with fries and a drink for $10

Service was good though."}
{"text":"I am at a loss for words. Our waitress had the personality of a zombie. She did not greet us like the other waitress. When my partner ordered a diet coke....she brought over a diet Pepsi instead without an explanation.
After 12 minutes waiting for her to return, she finally took our order, without an explanation that the burgers are solo....no fries. 
Once our order was delivered, she never once returned to check to see how our food was. 
Next time if you have  waitress 1032.......get another one.
We paid 37.00 for two burger, two soft drinks and two fries.... Not worth it."}
{"text":"I was very happy with my decision to eat at Johnny Rockets. The bacon single burger I had was cooked to perfection, the waitress was super helpful helping decide what I should eat and overall loved the experience. The decor with all the vintage coca cola ads and other vintage stuff gives the diner a retro feel. 

I would definitely return to try a shake and another burger."}
{"text":"I love Johnny Rockets. My first visit was in Atlantic City, New Jersey on the Boardwalk. When I came home, I tried to find the same experience I had there. 

Though the view of the Atlantic Ocean is now replaced with over made-up teenagers carrying bags through the mall, the Johnny Rockets at Vaughn Mills has been the best so far. 

There's rarely ever a wait. The crew does their song and dance with a smile, even with the small crowd. The service is quick and friendly and the prices are comparable to other locations. The music, equipped with jukeboxes that cost a nickel, really does a lot to set the atmosphere.

I like to get the \"Route 66\" with a side of onion rings for the girlfriend and I to share. I swear I saw them empty a plastic bag of onion rings into the fryer, but they're great nonetheless. 

If it weren't for the slightly high prices for an entire meal for two, including drinks and the side of onion rings, I would be visiting more often. However, it may be a good thing to keep it for special occasions, given the amount of grease that drips off my wonderful burger."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Chicken breast could have been supplied by a rubber plant.  Service was disinterested and overall a disappointment.  When in Excalibur, spend the extra time and money and head over to Dicks Last Resort for a better meal and a fun time."}
{"text":"I love jonhy rockerts but this place is just bad. 
Waiter doesn't pay attention to the order. All order was just wrong. Yes they gave us the right order but it's just a waste of time!"}
{"text":"Arizona Burger Tour: Johnny Rockets

Judging Criteria:

First appearance: Well put together if not a little overshadowed by the bun. Nothing is sloppily hanging out or disheveled. Patty size looks to match the bun. 

Flavor:  Solid beef flavor which is hidden or muted by the copious amount of toppings included with the burger. The most stand out, and slightly abrasive, flavor is the very generous portion of mustard. Less is more in this instance. 

Meat to bun ratio:  The smaller bun is complimented by a thicker patty. Each bite had the perfect amountnof patty and bun. The full hamburger was finished at the same time. 

Included extras (veggies / condiments): lettuce, tomato, dill pickles, dill relish, white onion mustard and a mayo.

Price: $7.99 (includes fries)

Grade: B = Really good. The burger has good flavor but might have a flaw or two.

{"text":"More like 2.5 stars, but can't bring myself to round up to 3.  We sometimes eat here before Cards games.  Food wait time can be long.  It's a good thing we show up well before kickoff because our last meal took close to 90 minutes, with about 60 of those waiting for food to come out.  The place was busy at the time, but not 100% full.  Service was barely decent, almost apathetic, but not quite crossing the line to bad.  The servers (3 different ones) checked on us for refills during the wait, so that helped.  Regarding the food this last visit, three of us loved our burgers, but my husband's classic burger ended up really soggy (not the norm)  from really wet lettuce and tomatoes.  He still ate it, but said he wouldn't order that particular burger again.  All of us liked the fries.  Tough to say if this is the norm for eating there since we only go on game day."}
{"text":"Very tasty burger patty!! The Rocket single patty was tasty, and the right portion. Chili cheese fries were good, a large serving. Fresh buns!"}
{"text":"Never been to this Johnny Rockets until last weekend & was so glad we chose to get it. Jose and the team are so attentive, fast & provide such great customer service. Our meal was such a pleasant treat & enjoyed watching the cooks prepare our meal with ease & efficiency. We got half fries and half onion rings, thank you Jose for the suggestion. I got a chili dog, which was perfect, LOVED that the hotdog was split and my bf got the smoke house & he loved it. Great Job to the restaurant and team!!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed this time with them. I went to Johnny Rockets on a Friday around 2pm with my family ( fiance, 2 kids) and the service was nothing impressive. My bowl of chili was room temperature and I asked for a coke and got it after asking for it again. It was not busy at all. Probably like 6 other family's in there with multiple servers on hand. I don't think I will be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Over priced burgers and I'm still waiting for over 33mins for my Route 66 burger and chicken tenders.  DO NOT GO HERE.  There are only 6 people sitting down, so it's not busy either.  Now I was just told  it looks like my order was lost.  Was offered a free shake by the kind manager, but I'm still not happy.   My cousin just walked up as I'm typing this, and she said they took 30mins for her shake yesterday as well.  Again, DO NOT GO HERE.  Only giving 1 star as Yelp will not let me give 0."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience here. It took a long time just for someone to seat us. No one even greeted us to say someone will be with you. We finally were seated and took a long time for our waitress to come and ask us for our drink order. Then we did not see her for about another 5 minutes to take our order. It felt like it took about an hour for our food to come. She did not offer us refills nor did she give us napkins or silverware, we had to ask for everything. The waitress never came back to the table to check on us to see if everything was ok. We had to ask another waitress to get our waitress for refills, she didn't come to the table she just brought them and slammed them down and walked off. This place needs to either hire friendlier waitresses or do better training. There were too many teenagers just standing around and talking rather than checking on their customers. We had to complain to the manager to let her know what was going on. Our waitress came to our table and cleared our plates and said we were getting our meal compt and then walked off again. No apologies from her, just attitude. We got the check and only half was taken, never coming back to this place. My poor mother took it personally, like we were not good enough to serve. The food wasn't even that good, very disappointed in this place!"}
{"text":"Good food, and a blast from the past. Great slice of Americana!"}
{"text":"Johnny Rockets has that \"throwback\" diner feel to it where they specialize in serving burgers, shakes, and fries, all in a casino food court.

The Route 66 burger that I ordered was cooked at medium-well with buttery buns, grilled onions and mushrooms -- I put a hold on the mayo. It's a decent burger and comparable to ones at fast food spots, like Jack in the Crack.

My boyfriend ordered The Bacon Cheddar Double with mushrooms, which are an additional $1. He also noted that it was, \"like something he's had at Jack in the Box.\" Basically, this is like Jack in the Box in a different form and without the fast food-like service. 

What I disliked about my experience was the service. The staff bust their butts here, so either this place is understaffed or there's inefficiency in procedures. I get that the food is made to order, but it takes way too long for it to arrive. Also, what's up with having to wait in line for almost 5 minutes to receive a beverage refill? -- I kid you not.

Food is OK. Service needs improvement. The 5 cent jukeboxes are broken and left for show."}
{"text":"Ohhh im sorry i thought when you placed an order you were not supposed to get one less meal, hope my boy enjoyed watching everyone eat. chicken club sandwich was awesome."}
{"text":"Pulled a strand of hair out of the burger. Loss of appetite. Fries came before the food. And the juke box ate my money. Ehhh I've been to several Johnny Rockets and i keep forgetting why I don't like going there. The one in knotts berry farm was the only fun place. It would of got a 2 maybe 3 but the hair grossed me out."}
{"text":"We arrived at Ballys and decided that we would have a quick lunch! There was nothing quick about this meal.  Sitting at the counter we could see our meal on a tray across from us. It just had not been picked up and delivered. 10 min later of burgers sitting there. Shall I say soggy buns! Greasy! Gross! Skip this Johnny Rockets."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! Their friendly nature, quick response and good food! This place is nice and clean. Good Oldies music, great burgers, shakes, fries and onion rings! Their waffles a pancakes are fresh of the griddle! Best breakfast in the Venetian with out spending an arm and a leg. Their service is amazing, I love to be sat in Pasbe's section, she always takes such good care of me. And when she's not there Banesa is amazing as well. Even the cooks always acknowledge me and say Hi! They are very detailed, this is why I always come back

Love this place and will always come back!"}
{"text":"The food was okay. Overpriced, but at least there's unlimited soda refills."}
{"text":"The only good thing I can say about our experience is that it was clean. However service is beyond slow. We waited over 20 minutes for burnt food. The prices aren't particularly great either, even for Vegas. Save yourself the trouble and move on up to the food court."}
{"text":"I wish you could rate places with that half star. This is a 2 1/2 star place. It's a teeny tiny bit better than \"I've had better\" but certainly not A-OK. 

I ordered onion rings and a grilled cheese. I asked for it not to be slathered in butter, and they were ok with that, but it wasn't grilled the way I like it. It needs to be dark and toasty and with a crispness to it. It did not have any of those. The onion rings were ok, I did add a few on my sandwich and that was ok as well. My cousin ordered the wings and they barely had any meat on them. I'm not joking. They use the tiniest wings I've ever seen.

For the quality of the food, it's pricey. If the food were better, it wouldn't seem so bad. 2 waters, a grilled cheese with .99 add on for onion rings and 8 tiny chicken wings, over $18 seems like a lot to me! Service was just ok.

Next time I'll eat before I stop at Silvertons to play!"}
{"text":"The food was really good but they decided to change their whole menu and get rid of the root beer floats, yet the wall still said \"Floats\" like they were being sold there. Pretty disappointing because that's really the only thing I wanted."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night. Wow it was the worst food, terrible service and rude workers. I am very unimpressed. It took20 minutes for cold, dry food and worst of all it was $72.34 for 4 basic meals with a drink. VERY DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"I had a Groupon and was pleased with staff and food. The waitress was pleasant and we enjoyed the afternoon. When the busboy noticed that I looked like I needed something he immediately came over and offered to help."}
{"text":"GAME DAY MENU WHAT THE H**L we there before the 2nd last game  4/06/2017 and found out about their new Lack Luster Bad Service no fries at first Cold Chicken Tenders No Sauce or Ranch and the weather got lip service when all 4 of us asked for our Fries needless to say we had a great time at the Game and will definitely go to the game again but as for Johnny Rockets yeah that ship has left the harbor and sank right next to the Titanic."}
{"text":"There aren't a lot of food choices at Kennywood Park, so we went to Johnny Rockets. They never asked what we wanted on our burgers, so I thought maybe I could put my own toppings on. But no--the burgers came with yellow mustard, relish, pickles, onions and MAYONNAISE! I don't know too many people who like mayo on burgers. But maybe we wouldn't be so disgusted if we didn't have to wait 10 minutes for COLD burgers. My cousin's burger was also hard! Never again will I eat at ANY Johnny Rockets location. And Kennywood, take note: you should have better food choices."}
{"text":"My kids use to come here a lot on Fridays after school. The last time we went there the service was horrible! They also started charging for fries and for cheese on their hamburgers. They brought out our fries before our meal. Then forgot to bring my daughters fries out that I had to pay for. The hamburgers and club sandwich were both burned. I ended up not having a lunch to eat. We will not be coming back! Very disappointed! This use to be such a great restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I are from San Francisco so we have had Johnny Rockets; unfortunately, this one did not live up to our expectations at all! I got a chilli cheese burger while he got the bacon cheese burger. This is the part where it all goes downhill! Our buns were cold and our burgers were luke warm (luckily we didn't get sick) and my husband asked for onion rings to be added onto the burger (meaning in it) but instead our waitress gave him a side of it. She also forgot to charge us for the onion rings (lucky for us but ditzy on her part). Under no circumstances should you ever come here (even if you're drunk). We were being lazy and it was super cold outside or else we would have gone elsewhere. Now we know and will not be coming back here EVER!"}
{"text":"What an absolute ripoff.  A double bacon with cheese/ fries costs over $17.  OMG, it didn't even come with a soda.  They force you to buy the fries with the burger.  If you don't want the fries they take a paltry $1 off the $17 burger.  If you are here in mgm there are 2 eat in restaurants where you can buy a burger 3 times the size and way way better for only several dollars more than at Johnny Rockets.  Don't waste your hard earned money with them but just go to either the Pub or Tap.  You will get a much higher quality meal for only a few dollars more."}
{"text":"OMG Johnny Rockets at the Flamingo...what is your SECRET?  We just spent 4 days in Vegas for my daughters 21st bday, and just COULD NOT GET ENUF OF YOU.  You know it's good when 3 nights in a row, you eat the same exact thing at the same exact place.  Best burger I have ever eaten in my LIFE, and same goes with the chicken strips according to my bff and daughter.  Most friendly staff...WE LOVE LUCY. Don't go changing anything, stay golden Johnny. Love, Darleen, Jaymes, and Gabby."}
{"text":"Absolutely sad. There I was ready for an awesome burger. NOPE!!!! Burnt bun and no flavor. Did someone forget the seasoning? YUP! A McDonalds burger would of hit the spot harder! Thanks for the extra $15 loss! Hold your head down in shame Johnny. My experience was straight boo boo."}
{"text":"The food was really good. I ordered a Route 66 double burger with no bun. It tasted really delicious. The server was just a little slow - didn't take my order very quickly, slow to follow-up (needed more of a condiment), and a little slow getting the bill to me.
Also, not the warmest bunch of employees.
But, in the end, I was very pleased with my food. It was a little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"We came in and they said we are closed.... understand but people just arrived not even a min before us and all we wanted was a couple cups of coffee and we were told \"No, sorry we are closed\" sucky- we will not be coming back. Ever."}
{"text":"My wife came out to lunch the food was good but I have to say that the service was a lot better our waitress was Chelsea she treated us with great attitude also was very respectful and knew how to take care of us."}
{"text":"I have ate at Johnny Rockets other locations and they were GREAT! However when I decided to eat this Johnny Rockets at the Santa Fe Casino I was very dissappointed. The BBQ Cheeseburger was over cooked and the bun was hard. The cheese fries were soaked in cheese. They almost looked like someone had puked them up. I was appauled by this establishment. I explained to the cook and cashier my issues and they smiled and said we cook this way for everyone everday and your our only complaint. WOW! Customer service sucked as bad as the food did."}
{"text":"To my surprise corporate changed the size of the hamburger omg ..... not even close to $10 worth what a disappointment I was shocked it was smaller then McDonald's wow! They are definitely going to lose my business. I asked the manager what happened to the big delicious  hamburger he even stated corporate changed the size... I must say my stars are only for the manager giving me a discount.. unfortunately customer service alone will not help Johnny Rockets decision to downsize to there customers.. they are ripping us off just look at what your eating ... so sad!"}
{"text":"Was staying at Flamingo and stopped here for lunch. We sat at the counter and Debbie served us. She was super friendly and efficient. We wanted to split a burger (some places don't want to accommodate splits). Debbie was fine with that, then helped me pick out a milk shake, she made me the best shake I've ever had, orange creamsicle. Our burger was tasty and cooked just right. Then the staff did the JR dance, that just made the experience even more fun. I'd consider going back to Vegas just to have Debbie wait on us again."}
{"text":"Worst service I have had in a long time.... Alexis may be too inexperienced to handle more than one table at a time. Saw good service from other servers to other patrons. I will ask for another server next time. Manager should assist with more training especially on a weekend!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our experience at Johnny Rockets, but they are certainly going through growing pains.  When we first went to the restaurant, it was pretty empty but we were told there was a 45 minute wait because they kitchen couldn't handle a large amount of orders and was backed up. They do have a system where they send you a text when your table is ready, so at least you will know when to go back to the restaurant.
When we came back, there seemed to be some confusion about where they were actually going to seat us as some tables were apparently not \"ready\" (even though they were all empty and clean).  Our server was friendly, but there were some long wait times for simple things.  All of our food was correct (and tasty) and we all got a laugh out of the \"ketchup smiles\" they made.  
One person in our group had the chicken salad, one a chili dog and two of us burgers.  Burgers were tasty and there is a nice variety but the burgers themselves are kind of small for the price that you pay.
They have only been open since the end of June, so I truly believe a lot of it is just trying to get the right system and work out kinks.  I hope that it will improve with time and training.
If you are looking for a place to cool off and relax in the middle of your day at Kennywood, Johnny Rockets is a good option.  Just know that it will likely take a considerable amount of time."}
{"text":"We went here after a concert, and place was pretty packed. Ordered a Cheeseburger and a Strawberry Milkshake. Cheeseburger is a Cheeseburger, right? Wrong.  I wasn't feeling the burger at all, it was just meh...the shake was alright, but thats about it...

The service here is pretty lacking too, almost non-existent. Why would you sign a job application if you act like you don't wanna be working here? We should have just driven to the nearest In-N-Out where they do burgers right...Sorry Johnny, you blew it!...ALOHA!!!

YELP 365 CHALLENGE-( 309/365) \"Burger Blast\""}
{"text":"This is an inside the park restaurant in Kennywood, We ordered at the counter and took a seat at our tables with a number on a stand they gave us. They brought the drinks over pretty quickly and the food came soon after. They bring to food in bags and you have to sort out whose is whose.  It was good for family dining with a bunch of little kids. Some of these reviewers sound like they expect an Emeril Lagasse type experience. We got exactly what we expected, friendly, fun, clean and well run. Just a few items on the simple menu, probably that helps keep the orders coming out smoothly. The food was good, sort of a food court quality, It's what we expected. Pricey for what we got, but again, inside Kennywood."}
{"text":"Great food. Fast service, great place for lunch in the mall.. The price is a bit height but it's the mall. Swing by for great food."}
{"text":"On one hand, the food was very good. I had the Smokehouse and my wife had the Route 66. Both recommended! Also, the cooks were conscientious and friendly. They went out of their way, as did the manager, to make sure we enjoyed our meal. On the other hand, what spoiled our meal was our waitress, a very slender redhead. She seemed to be in a hurry to get us out of there for some reason. We barely took a look at the menu and she was pressuring us to order. She gave us stale fries and didn't even prepare the ketchup dish with the smiley face. Then when I called her to take back the fries, I had to call her multiple times, almost shouting, even though she was standing a mere three feet away from me. Unsurprisingly, she gave me a \"what do you want?\" look. Then, after we were given our food--which one of the cooks brought over--our so-called waitress completely ignored us, however, she did plop the check down when we were only half done with out meals. On top of everything was the waitress's boyfriend, who was loitering the whole time we were there, alternating between looking impatient, flirting with his girlfriend, and looking threatening. I won't say I'll never eat here again. However, I'll only do so when I can clearly see that that abysmally bad waitress and her boyfriend aren't around."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Came here around 9pm (they close at 11pm) on a Monday night. We were greeted and seated promptly. The waitress taking our order seemed like her mind was elsewhere for pretty much the whole night. (Strike 1) I ordered the Houston WITH onion rings on top at an extra $1.39. No problem. I got my burger and there was JUST ONE onion ring on it. And a small one at that. (Strike 2). My fiance had a Dr Pepper and when a refill came along, they gave her a Coke instead. She hates Coke. (Strike 3). 

I could understand the mistakes (cause they were small) if it was busy that night but aside from us, there was two other tables. AND another waitress in the house. It was a very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Avoid this place. It is not the Johnny Rockets you love. 

Never mind that the prices are double to triple normal. Your JR makes cheese fries from cheese. This place pours on processed slime food product. This place advertises chili fries, but doesn't have any. No hot dogs. No refills. 

At your JR, servers have esprit. Maybe even dance or sing. Not here. 

And, slow, even during light periods. And expensive. Try $12 for a burger, $3.89 for one cup of soda, and $7 for a milkshake. 

I went here because I thought they'd sell me something worth buying. Not this place."}
{"text":"Milkshake was supposed to be 1/2 price because bought burger and onion rings at full price, later realized over-charge.  Additionally it was completely melted because received milkshake in a plastic cup along with burger and onion rings, although it was made when placed the order.  I saw it made then person disappear.  $19 for a basic burger, onion rings and melted milkshake for lunch.  I could go to Carnegie's for a Reuben and beer for that.  You decide."}
{"text":"We stopped here to have a meal while walking in Vegas. The place was crowded and one of the employees made it a point to get people seated and served. We ordered and the food was quickly served. It was very good and the price wasn't bad either."}
{"text":"We stopped he to eat prior to going to a show. This is a normal franchise burger place. The food is good and is made quickly."}
{"text":"Amazing place to go positive vibes came in with my kids 2 young ladies help me sat me in the bar cook greeted me gave me glass of water while the the 2 young ladies was helping other guest out  we had this amazing shakes  thanks crystal and iris and cook for making this experience fun for the kids nothing like old fashion milk shakes"}
{"text":"We have been to this location a few times too. Love the shakes!!! But I fill out on the shake before my food is out, so I end of taking food home. Order the cheese fries and was disappointed to find 1 slice of American cheese melted on top of the fries. I was thinking you get a little lot cheese then 1 slice. The rocket wings are alright. Got the Patty Melt, it was a little greasier than normal. It was good!"}
{"text":"The food is good a little expensive but worth it. My mini me thought it was great and want to come again. We will on her dime. Check them out"}
{"text":"Service here was mediocre. In terms of food wise, it was ok. But I had a better burger for the price. This was built in to the Flamingo Hotel we were staying at and my friends didn't want to eat at the main steak restaurant. Ordered just a regular cheeseburger with fries and a milk shake. The dining area was shared with 4 other food counters and so it was packed. I would say the food here is ok. I'd rather take a drive to in-n-out for a better burger."}
{"text":"Great food.   Real old-fashioned burgers and malts!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast selection - Krispy Kreme and other bagels, croissants, juice, egg & cheese muffins, burgers etc. Staff were very efficient, quick, courteous and friendly. Good strong coffee - a welcome change after some awful stuff at other places on our Zion/Grand Canyon/ Vegas trip! The delicious Tater tots (potatoes) are a must have!"}
{"text":"Oh Johnny Rockets.... Where do I begin?  When our large (11 people) group walked in,  we were informed that there would be at least a half hour wait for a seat.   Even though there were  plenty of empty tables we agreed to this stipulation because the great things we heard about food quality, not to mention the size of our group.  It was 5 o'clock on a Thursday afternoon but this particular location is in Kennywood Park and it was a 'school picnic day' so we were sort of expecting a long wait. After we were seated it took approximately 15-20 minutes before we finally met our server.  Our group was somewhat complicated order wise given that we were seated at two separate tables and had planned to pay in 4 different groups.  The (very young)waiter looked a bit confused even as he began to take our drink orders.  We explained who was on the 4 separate checks again at that point as I could see he was writing all of the drink orders on the same slip of paper.   Needless to say it was all downhill from there... I didn't get my drink until minutes before the meal arrived and only after I asked him a third time for said drink-which was only water.  After another 45 minutes the food finally started coming.  The orders themselves were screwed up too.  3 people got the completely wrong meal, with one of those people choosing to eat the item that no one had ordered just to save time.  Another person ordered a hot dog and when he bit into it, found that it was still FROZEN on the inside!  Suffice it to say, he sent it back and went to another establishment in the park. At this point I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that the burgers WERE excellent and were enjoyed by those of us who got their order correctly.  But after almost 1 hour and 50 minutes of redirecting orders, sending items back, etc., no one was truly enjoying the experience at this point.  The youngest members as well as the adults of our group were very anxious to get back to riding rides in the park.  When it came time to get our checks,  we could see the server talking to the manager at length about the separate checks.  Long story short after another 15 minutes and two more interventions by various bill paying members of our group with the manager,  they agreed to comp two of the checks entirely and apologized for the whole ordeal.  The handling of the situation is the only reason I gave them an extra star. That being said however, I wouldn't recommend this location to those who are more interested in riding rides at Kennywood than waiting 2+ hours in a restaurant. Oh and as an aside,  during that whole two hours the servers only came out and sang once, which was supposed to be one of Johnny Rockets selling points-that the servers come out every half hour and break into song-glee style. Like I said, it wasn't why we were there but it's another lapse in service we experienced on this very long, very frustrating visit to Johnny Rockets."}
{"text":"Got in during midnight. Surprised that it was busy at this time. Employees working really hard to get orders in and I applaud them. Ordered an original. Got my food in around an 8 minutes. My burger cooked perfectly. I appreciate the service and food at Johnny Rockets at Excalibur."}
{"text":"My son, daughter and I arrived at Arrowhead Mall in search of a place to have lunch. We chose Johnny Rockets because it had been a long time since we dined there. We waited for about 3 minutes to be seated by a nice, young lady. We were asked if we wanted to be seated at a booth or table--I told her I didn't prefer one over the other so she led us to a table with chairs. 
A nice young lady named Julia took our drink order. After she brought our fountain drinks to our table, she took our food order. 
My daughter ordered the Route 66 mushroom burger with Swiss cheese without the bun in a lettuce wrap. I ordered the same thing but with the bun and a side of onion rings. My son ordered the double cheeseburger with a side of fries. 
We waited about 10 minutes for our order. Everything arrived fresh and hot. The burgers were hot, juicy and tasty. Every bite was delicious! Our waitress Julia checked on us often. We enjoyed our lunch. We will return in the future."}
{"text":"Not bad.  Unfortunately, we do not have a Johnny Rocket's here in San Diego (but we do have Ruby's Diner).  The food is typical 50's diner fare with burgers and shakes.  I had a Double Rocket and a chocolate malt.  That was pretty good.  The atmosphere isn't that bad.  It's pretty family-friendly with a 50's motif and a man who makes balloon animals at your table.  The downside is that sometimes the jukebox plays disco music by the Bee Gees and KC and the Sunshine Band.  They should stick to only 50's rock and roll and doo-wop from the early 60's (malt-shop favorites)."}
{"text":"Not only was our service subpar, the clearly inexperienced waitress ran my debit card for $70 on a check that was actually $9. When I spoke to the manager, her response was never \"I'm sorry that happened\" but an irritated snap when I asked her if the transaction would be voided. I've never been spoken to so rudely after someone else made a mistake. 
This offense completely eclipsed the fact that the food was served incorrectly and in a confusing order. 
Lastly, because of their blunder, I was late back to work, as this was my lunch hour. An awful experience from what is usually a decent restaurant."}
{"text":"I love Johnny Rockets and love going but my experience  here was less than mediocre. So one thing to keep in mind is this is a Johnny Rockets with the concept of a fast food restaurant; you order your food, they give you a transponder, and then you pick up your food when it buzzes. You grab your own utensils nd you clear your own table. 

Honestly, I almost didn't feel like I was in a Johnny Rockets because there were flat screens all over the place and no juke box either. It didn't have that 50s spunk that the others have and it just lacked that nostalgia.

It's Vegas,  I get it. I mean it's pretty awesome that this place is open late but I sure missed that old Johnny Rocket's feel. But anyway, I digress.

For me, the heart warming thing Bout this place are the smoothies and floats. The burgers and fries ate great too but the sweet stuff is usually so delicious! Not at this location.

My root beer float was just awful. The ice cream wasn't smooth, but rather very much frozen and crunchy. I was also jipped. My float was missing alot if you ask me. Anyone looking at it would probably think someone drank some of my rootbeer float before giving it to me. I posted a picture to share my frustration."}
{"text":"Do taste your time or money here.  
Long lines, very expensive prices and poor food quality leave little to rave about here. They appear to be understaffed and the quality of the food reflects as such. It's a food court and there are other options unfortunately not much better prices but better tasting."}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Came in after midnight and stayed for a good hour and this place was still busy with a line. Ordered a double rocket and a double route 66 and an order of chili cheese fries. Everything came out just as we imagined it, and all in all considering it is a burger place in a casino, the price wasn't outrageous. Mmm... the taste hit the spot too, not crazy greasy but it is a burger joint of course. If you're looking for a non pretentious burger that will fill you up this is your place. I especially liked the chili, non chunky, more like a sauce, but perfect for fries and a burger."}
{"text":"This has been the worst restaurant experience I've had in Vegas so far. My husband and I waited 15-20 minutes for our food, several other people and in after us and also waited, but 2 scantily clad women walked in and had their orders in less than 5 minutes. On top of that, I spent $30 on food for 2 people and my food was wrong. I asked for no tomato, onion, or lettuce on my burger yet when I got to my room with it I spent quite a bit of time picking lettuce and onions out of my bread where it had been cross-contaminated and mixed in the melted cheese was also pieces of onion and lettuce. This's visit was my first and last to ANY Johnny Rockets location, horribly disappointed and waste of money."}
{"text":"Just got amazing service from Daniel. He smiled while he explained the menu. He offered Eater cups and heated up out desert. The food was great but what made it rock was his service."}
{"text":"Needed something quick to eat after being at the pool for three hours, We couldn't decide because it was so many other option but decided on this place, The lady taking our order was super friendly even engaged us is conversation, The burger and fries is nothing fancy but delicious. It did take a while for the buzzer to go off to get our food but it was a little busy so we didn't mind."}
{"text":"This is not your typical Johnny Rockets Restaurant.  
The food menus is very limited. 
Hamburger was dry.  French fries had no flavor. 
Shakes come out of a machine that is mixing all the time.  Shake was not real cold either.   
No Malts at this location.  
Ruins the good name of Johnny Rockets."}
{"text":"Was really wanting a good Johnny Rockets burger, unfortunately that is not what we got. It was about 1am. Place was very slow, maybe 3 other customers. There was 4 in our party.
Ordered Burgers and onion rings, bill came to $64. From the time we ordered to the time we received our food 20 minutes had gone by. They messed up 2 out of the 3 burgers we got, the \"Route 66\" was like eating beef jerky on a bun, with dehydrated mushroom, (onions were good), so that was a plus. Onion Rings were super crispy, fries were excellent though.
We had eating at J.R. at another location before and it was excellent, so we were really looking forward to the same delicious food. Too bad that wasn't the case, i guess not every Johnny Rockets are the same."}
{"text":"Typical Johnny Rockets. One drawback is that the only only entrance is through the Arizona Mills Mall, so the location has to close early, at 9:00p, when the rest of the mall closes."}
{"text":"Love this joint, always the best burgers and friendly staff! The kids loved the shakes and service was speedy, highly recommend stopping in!"}
{"text":"I visited this Johnny Rockets location on the night of a nearby hockey (Coyotes) game. They had posted signs on the front door that the restrooms were only for customers which I thought nothing of since I planned to have dinner there. No one was at the front to seat people when I walked in. I looked around and saw that the 2 people I was meeting were not there yet and headed to the restroom. 

About halfway to the restroom, I was approached by a girl (who I later learned was the hostess, Agnus). I explained that I was waiting on 2 people and was going to use the restroom. Her reply was that the restrooms were for paying customers only to which I replied that I WAS going to eat there. Her response was, \"a lot of people say that\". Well... needless to say I was seriously upset and essentially told her I was going to use the restroom PERIOD. When I came out I took a seat at the counter and a few minutes later the 2 people I was waiting to meet walked in the door. After our meal (I needed some time to calm down), I asked to speak to the manager. I was told he had already left for the day but the \"super\" was there. The \"super\" was a younger woman who seemed less than concerned about my experience. I got no resolution, spent $50 including tip and left a very unsatisfied customer. I understand that they probably have people that are not customers trying to use their restrooms but when someone tells you that they are indeed a customer, it would be best to give them the benefit of the doubt. They are offending true customers with their practices which is obviously poor customer service. 

After, I left a message on the Johnny Rockets customer service line and sent a message as well. That was several weeks ago and NO ONE has addressed my concern. I will be taking my money elsewhere and I would suggest you do the same. 

Unfortunate as I have enjoyed their food for many years."}
{"text":"Good fun!  Good food!

Kids eat free with adult combo purchase.

Kids love the hats and coloring."}
{"text":"I like Johnny Rockets in general but three things were less then expected.

1) They have a counter with no counter service

2) The beef was under cooked

3) The gal at the cash register has the personality of a tree"}
{"text":"Management in this location should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. A Saturday night in an amusement park, barely half of the tables had occupants, 20+ people waiting at the door and people that were alone wanting a quick bite weren't allowed to sit at the counter (empty counter mind you). Take some pride in your establishment, fill the restaurant and prove to your patrons you belong in a theme park that serves thousands of people every day."}
{"text":"Slow service.  One friend did not get his meal till we were finished eating ours. 

Burger was just ok. Not crazy about the bun."}
{"text":"Food, service and atmosphere - bad, bad and really bad. I've been to JRs in multiple cities and even on a cruise ship.   They are mediocre at best, but the JRs at Westgate-Glendale is the absolute worst. Burgers are like hockey pucks (perhaps in honor of the nearby NHL Coyotes.) Service is pleasant but extremely slow. As for atmosphere, it was a beautiful Arizona day - as most are. So, we decided to dine outside. The patio is located next to the world's largest dumpster. The stench was indescribable. As for the restroom - disgusting!"}
{"text":"Great Burgers. Perfectly cooked beef paties. Half and Half option for fries and Orings was welcomed. Crused cubed Ice is the best.  A little pricey. Its like a stripped down (menu) 50s diner version of Red Robin. Not bad at all."}
{"text":"Food here is really good. Maybe needs a little dash of love when made though. Staff was helpful & generous but they all seem so stressed out. Supervisors seems so strict but that's non of my business about how they handle it. There was this one specific gentleman I think his name was Richard or something, REALLY awesome supervisor & his cooking skills were A1! Wish he made my food . Anywho, this Johnny Rockets the TRUTH."}
{"text":"The food is good, but takes a while. The shakes are great. The main issue is the prices, holy crap this place charges an arm and a leg. Its good if you're staying here and need something to eat before you go to bed and don't mind having to lay on your stomach to sleep after paying the bill. Also, they have a limited menu late at night. Its not posted anywhere, they just crush your dreams of getting certain items when you try to order them"}
{"text":"This morning I went to Johnny rockets for breakfast and I had Thomas as my waiter. He went ABOVE AND BEYOND his duty to ensure that I got my beverage and food in as soon as they opened. Thomas was so friendly and helpful. He even brought my food to my table to I could eat with my family. Thomas made my morning and I will defiantly come back!!"}
{"text":"Anna was absolutely amaxing waitress. she was so friendly and made the kids not stop smiling the whole time we were there. food was very good"}
{"text":"Shut the front door batman! Damn this is one tasty burger! It is a bit pricy to be honest. The food is amazing! Fries are fresh, and molten hot! It is super cute in here too, like the diners my G parents would take me to when I was a kid. So yes I am a fan of Johnny Rockets."}
{"text":"I love this place.  The people and food are awesome.  I even like their coffee.  So many places make it too strong, but not here.
I love the atmosphere and cleanliness too."}
{"text":"It's like I'm living in my own television episode of \"Happy Days\"

When I first went to a Johnny Rockets, it was about twenty years ago, at Pentagon City Mall in Arlington Virginia. I now live in Las Vegas, Nevada and have for the last ten years.  

\"Heeyyy !! \"

When I first went to Johnny Rockets, service was great, food was very satifying. The jukeboxes, one per table, one for every two seats at the bar, they all worked.

It's like I had \"Found my thrill on Blueberry Hill\".

Several weeks ago my family, close friends, and myself went to the Flamingo casino and ate at the Johnny Rockets there. 

I left feeling like Al Delvecchio from Happy Days: \"Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.\"

Just a few short days ago, my wife and two daughters went to the Johnny Rocket's at Fashion Show Mall here in Las Vegas, Nevada, the time was around 6:00-6:30pm. The place was maybe a quarter full.

Our server never introduced himself. No name tag. Kids wanted to, so we sat at the bar. One sat down and discovered that there were over a dozen ketchup bottle in front of her. Looked like the ketchup bottles were there to be refilled.

When we sat down, we were told that the jukeboxes won't work, they're just for decoration. When did this happen?

We ordered food and drinks at the same time. It took over five minutes to deliver the drinks. Mind you the drink fountain was a mere 10 to 15 feet from when I sat.

It's an open kitchen at Johnny Rockets, you can easily watch your food being prepared. You can easily watch your being placed in a prep area where it can be picked up by the server.

\"Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.\"

You will also wait another five good minutes to be served your food. MY 7 YEAR OLD COULD HAVE SERVED IT QUICKER !

The bacon on my hamburger was burnt. My 9 year old daughter, had bacon on her burger as well. When asked, she said hers was burnt too.

Just like the television show Happy Days, what once was a great place lost its charm. Somehow I feel like someone just stopped caring. Somewhere, sadly, Johnny Rockets has jumped the shark."}
{"text":"The burgers were excellent.  I had the Rocket double,  which was nice and juicy.  The service was fast and friendly.  Will come back again."}
{"text":"The Original burger was delicious.  And so was the milkshake. Service was fast and friendly.  Will come back again if in need of a burger fix."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, the food was fine, but this location is in a food court. I didn't see any jukeboxes like most other Johnny Rocket stores I have been to. Ah well. With this location I can find another place to eat. Or another Johnny Rockets at different location. I like Johnny Rocket's, but I am used to Johnny Rocket locations with said jukeboxes."}
{"text":"Quick bite before I had to leave the casino. Thankfully the wait wasn't long to put my orders in. They gave us pagers to let us know when food is ready. I think the place is a bit spendy for the meal. Mine totaled to be $13 for regular tasting burgers... wasn't that impressed but I still ate it for the ease and convenience of the location and for fast food."}
{"text":"Yummy chili cheese fries! mmmm!!!

The original burger was good too.

Nothing more to say though... this location tastes as good as any other Johnny Rockets."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. Came out extremely quick and tasted as fresh as any other place I've been to. Our sever, Courtney, was very friendly and was interactive with my baby but not in an overbearing way. Definitely willing to come back here."}
{"text":"Never eating at this location again. Ordered food for my family it was all just thrown together. Ordered the cheeseburger single, it was just meat and cheese and bread.. they didn't put any sauce or lettuce or anything else on them. Was overpriced for something that was overcooked as well. Well learned my lesson, I would go to mcdonalds  you would get better than coming here.."}
{"text":"Thus beats the other restaurants in Arrowhead mall by a mile. It's a package experience--50's theme, decor, and food. 
I'm partial to the taste of a real burger, with toasted buns and all the fixin's. I like my fries fried now not ten minutes ago, and a shake that doesn't taste like pink chemicals in a wax cup. 
Did I pay for it? Yeah. Was it worth it?  Oh god, yes. Because you will dream of JR burgers and shakes, and the memory of licking the burger juices off your lips,  for weeks to come. I don't know--because it's real food & not gast crap. JR got it right. Amen."}
{"text":"Three words: unlimited coffee refills!! With everything being so expensive in Vegas, and a cup of coffee ranging from at least $4 to $6, the caffeine habit can get pretty expensive very quickly. It is a godsend that this place offers unlimited free refills 24/7 so long as you keep your cup. Any dollar you can save is good! Don't worry, they still profit in the end-- the house always wins! And if you need at least three cups of coffee a day, you win too.

The food is okay, but I wasn't there for the food. :P"}
{"text":"Amazing veggie burger! So good I ate this three times while I was staying at Bally's. The cook times were a bit longer than I hoped but the food quality and taste makes up for it completely. Would recommend and definitely return."}
{"text":"$74 for 2 adults and 2 children my burger was not cooked bun was a week old the whole burger was cold... Kids burger the cheese was so thin it only had one side very disappointing.... Non of the buns were heated to toasted ... Will not recommend :("}
{"text":"The classic Johnny rockets. I wish they will bring back the old time where all their cooks and servers will dance."}
{"text":"Looks like a carbon copy of another burger place that has a thing for \"smashing\" burgers... service and atmosphere were pleasant however they did get the orders incorrect and left off the standard items that were advertised on the menu. Unimpressive standard white buns with no other options. Standard fries and no upgrade options. JR should stick to the kitschy 50's diner thing and not try to be something they are not until they have a menu to compete with the competition."}
{"text":"Burgers are very very greasy.  Waiter was friendly and nice. Cheap place to eat but greasy burgers not good!"}
{"text":"Johhny Rocket's slogan should be \"McDonald's at thrice the price.\"

The Good: The service was friendly and attentive, the food came relatively quickly, and the decor and colorful menus were a pleasant change. The $6 milkshake was delicious! 

The bad: The food is on par with McDonalds: greasy, bland, and served with a side of forget-me-fries. 

The ugly: The price. Johnny rockets probably has one of the lowest value for money eating experiences in the city. At the end of the day, this is just a McDonalds outfitted with plastic diner-esque furniture. 

Tip for the road: The spontanoues 50's dance session was a nice touch. Unfortunately the servers looked like they were having their teeth pulled, and in the process forgot what the steps were. I sympathized with them though; what kid working at a greasy burger joint wants to to dance for their customers? No one dear Johhny."}
{"text":"Cant say that I eat anything on the menu except for the sweet potato fries, which are pretty dang amazing!!!!  The service was a little awkward......the server didn't seem to be comfortable at the table talking to us.  Maybe his first day?"}
{"text":"Service was subpar at best. Ordered my food to go and I watched it sit for 10 minutes. I'd rather flush my money down the toilet first!"}
{"text":"Located in the food court of the Fashion Square Mall, I don't come to this Johnny Rockets location too often.  However, when I do, I like to indulge in a Single w/Cheese, $5.49.  Designed like an old school, diner, it brings back fond memories of my first experience with Johnny Rockets in Westwood, CA near UCLA.

They make their Burgers fresh here, so it takes a while for your order to come out....but it's worth it!  Because of it's location, this place is always busy when I pass by, otherwise I'd dine here more often.

Overall, it's a great Burger and good vibe.

Return Factor - 90%"}
{"text":"The new line system stinks.  The wait is horrible.  Fifty dollars for 3 hamburger meals.  Stop at McDonald's instead."}
{"text":"Ate today April 7 2018. Asked politely for a tissue from Camille and was told to get it from the service area where the condiments are. When there are tissues in front of her and could've handed me some. Can also help if she would smile. Food is great though"}
{"text":"On 6/6/18 at 4:p.m., the female employee on duty chose to stay behind the door and talk on her phone rather than wait on customers. We chose to eat elsewhere as she would not come out from the back. Hopefully management will take note and replace her with someone who wants to work."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.  Their tater tots are excellent!  It was a bit slow but there servers were very friendly and helpful.  Also, my kids loved the milkshakes and kids selections.  Fun experience for the family :)"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday and i ordered a philly cheese steak and a strawberry milkshake, extremely delicious and thanks to my waiter Erwin Araiza who made my experience even better,best waiter ive ever had in a dine in restaurant"}
{"text":"Food was delicious and server was attentive. Had the bacon cheeseburger. The burger was cooked perfect, with crispy bacon, fresh tomatoes, onions, and lettuce."}
{"text":"This place has an awesome atmosphere!

Service was quick, our food came promptly, and it was tasty. Service slacked off at that point, but we weren't in a hurry.

When I checked-in on Yelp, I was given a $5 off coupon, which our server forgot to honour...

Could be better."}
{"text":"Convenient location to grab a bite.
We got seated in a timely manner, the service was great and the shakes were delicious. Would go again :)"}
{"text":"What happened JR's?

And what's with the $7 milkshakes.  Never again will I order that.  It wasn't even good.  I was very disappointed.

I had the BLT which was very average.  The fries were too salty and the onion rings were bland.

And what's with blaring the music to have some of your servers dance to the music which they are not even interested in?

$62 for lunch for three people."}
{"text":"Home of the $11 single hamburger. 
Staff and server were not friendly. 
Had to battle gnats the entire \"meal\"."}
{"text":"The service is always pretty good. The food always tastes fine, cooked just right and ready timely. BUT the prices can't be justified. Just 2 bucks short of $20 and I got a burger, sweet potato fries, and soda. For one person. For $3.50 the soda isnt spiked and mostly just Ice, no Gordon Ramsey burger patty on my $8 burger, and I doubt the fries are organic non gmo locally farmed to deserve $5. Will I come to Johnny Rockets again? Yes. But never to this location unless they drop their prices... Which we can all bet won't happen. So if yourr looking for better."}
{"text":"First of all i was on my break from work and waited over 20 minutes for a salad and fries. The price in their menu for a garden salad is $9.98. I got a TINY little bowl of salad that I could get elsewhere for $1.50. To make matters worse I got no fork so I had no way to even eat that tiny ass salad. I will not be giving them my business again that is a promise."}
{"text":"Ordered a #12 burger. Menu said no tomato & sautéed onions, when it arrived there was a tomato & no onions. When I asked the server, he told me I could \"remove the tomato myself\" and he could bring me onions for me to \"put on my burger.\" Not impressed :("}
{"text":"It's fine and what you'd expect. It's located in the Bally's food court on Flamingo, between the Strip and Linq Lane.

I like it because it was the nearest casual food near my hotel (Westin). Sometimes you don't have time or money for another fancy sit-down restaurant, but just need a burger within walking distance. A lot of the other nearest cheap eats would require getting in your car. 

The food took a little longer than normal, but it was NYE and every other place was packed too. I thought the staff did a decent job, and felt bad that rude customers were yelling at them, unjustified in my opinion."}
{"text":"Johnny Rockets holds a special place in my heart with memories of mall trips with my friends in high school. This location wasn't as fantastic as those of my past. There's only bar-seating and everything is definitely rushed. They've done well with they space they have, but I truly miss being able to tuck into a booth, listen to our own jukebox and sip on a beautifully pulled milkshake. 

Upon our trip we ordered a Big Apple shake and a Dark Chocolate shake. We received one but not the other and had to fight for the attention of the staff to ask for our second shake, which was definitely not even on the radar of being made. Once we actually received the second shake, everything was delicious - but it's just not the experience we were hoping for :/"}
{"text":"Love the milk shakes here. Chocolate peanut butter is my favorite, but other flavors are good, too. Other items are mediocre at best. And it takes FOREVER for the food to arrive."}
{"text":"I decided to go eat here yesterday since I always love the food. This location was just OK service was good but the food took forever to come to the table. The curtains next to the tables have food spilled all over them nobody bothered to clean the house. To ketchup bottles on the table were both empty and we had asked for more ketchup. We ordered a fry to share and they only put a half a one on one person's place for us to share realize that and later had to come back and bring more fries. The fries in both orders that we received were both old and new mix together not very appetizing at all. The other irritation was the constant gnats flying around that totally took away from the experience  won't be coming back here. The only positive was the waiters were nice and the burger was good."}
{"text":"Really greasy hamburger.  Loaded with yellow mustard which masked any flavor of the meat.  Took a long time to get my order too, and barely anyone there.  Lots of trash on the counter too, and was there when I left.  Workers do not seem to care.  Saw two people get takeouts and both of their orders were wrong.  Also with a milkshake close to $ 20.00!!  Scratching this off my list for Vegas.  Positive that there MUST be a better place than this."}
{"text":"The burgers are all bread. 
Shakes are over priced. 
The fries are over seasoned. 
The prices are a bit exorbitant for what you get. I don't mind spending money on good food, but I feel like I could get something better at Wendy's."}
{"text":"Piss-poor food and service at gourmet burger restaurant prices. 

This establishment is so atrocious, one wonders whether it would better to simply toss remaining Groupon®s in the white-coloured Waste Management recycle bin. One wonders how it even stays in business.

This place is subpar even by fast food standards; the audacity that they possess to charge what the burgers would go for at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar is offensive. 

14.49$ for an original and a drink. No, not an alcoholic drink -- although it would have taken quite a few of those to make this shitshow remotely tolerable -- but a regular five cent concoction of syrup with water.

So what exactly am I complaining about? Mainly, the fucking burgers suck. They suck. Lower quality than Burger King®. Lowest quality and most charred burger I have ever paid for; worse than eating at the DFAC/Chow Hall in the military. Worse than eating at the fucking public school cafeteria. Just marginally better than literally starving of hunger (I would have to give it some further thought). 

So how the hell do they manage staying in business? Beats the fuck out of me. 

Come here if you wish for your meal to be more expensive, shittier, and be prepared slower -- and, possibly receive the wrong order (50% of the time, they have screwed up my order here) -- than if you just go to another burger restaurant, which is just several hundred meters away on the North East side of Fashion Show. 

Do yourself a favour: go to Stripburger®. They know what they are doing there and are much faster than here anyway. - E"}
{"text":"Sunday was my first time trying johnny rockets with my family and my server was esther she was friendly and had great customer service.  We need more people like her in the food industry! I tried the bacon cheddar burger and it was amazing while my kids had the tenders i will definitely be coming back here.The food came out pretty quick and i was very staisfied with everything in overall.  !"}
{"text":"This restaurant at the MGM is poorly run and the employees are not motivated to serve the customer. During my visit one of the employees was starting work and looked right at me and said I'll help you after I log in to her register. She walked away, turned around, and started to laugh. Her manager took my order and when it was ready (I had it to go) I hurried to my room. The burger was over cooked, lacked their special sauce, and was unappealing. Don't bother to buy any product here as management is unresponsive to date."}
{"text":"I have never been here before and wanted to check it out. We walked in and the place was absolutely filthy. Every table that we walked up to was dirty...not just a little...i mean there was trash on the tables, ketchup, drinks spilled on the floor. It looked like there was a food fight. 
 
There were about 5 employees behind the counter playing around and when I asked if someone could please clean a table I was told that there should be a clean one somewhere.

Ok...see ya !!"}
{"text":"Service sucked and was incredibly slow.  We sat for 15 minutes at the bar before we were even acknowledged.  Shakes were pretty good with delicious whipped cream but I wouldn't go back simply because of the service."}
{"text":"The last Johnny Rockets I was at I wasn't impressed at all, but this one, in an amusement park no less, was a very nice surprise. 

The food at this JR was way better the last one I was at. The burgers were cooked well and stacked high, the fries were hot, and the salad was huge and fresh. The service was very good, with a young waitress that had to deal with the shenanigans from our table - she handled it well. And the place was super clean, surprising. Onside ring it's smack dab in the middle of the park. 

As far as dessert is concerned we didn't have desert or shakes, but fro the looks of those around us who did order, they appeared very tempting. 

Sometimes you have try a different location for a chain to get a true feel for how good it could be."}
{"text":"The food was to expensive. Need to have a combo meal. A burger and shake should not cost $17.00. Need more staff"}
{"text":"Here's a suggestion, if your restaurant is dead and there's someone waiting to place a to go order, how about u tell the staff to tend to them instead of performig their unenthused dance routine for nobody.  Poor prioritizing!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The service is great; the food is great as is the music & dancing. A fun place to hang out."}
{"text":"I've been going to Johnny Rockets for years.  They were my favorite burger place in Cali and they are still my favorite burger place here in Vegas.  The Original is my usual and I cannot help but to stick to it.  I recently purchased a Groupon from them and we decided to go to the one at the Fashion Show Mall.  I got my usual and my hubby got their Philly cheesesteak.  He loved it!  And the location of this JR is cool because I love to people watch.  Fashion Show has all kinds of people from all over. Definitely makes for a fun day out."}
{"text":"Thomas is amazing! Great service, fast, polite, funny and efficient!  It's almost like dinner and a show!!! The food is solid, but Thomas was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Worst experience ever...cold food, super slow, had to ask for half the drinks 3 times...2 of 4 meals still not delivered. Won't come back here."}
{"text":"Amazing experience sitting at the outdoor seating at the OdySea aquarium.Food was hot and came at a reasonable time after ordering would definitely come back again"}
{"text":"This was our first meal in our guys weekend at Vegas. One thing you learn quickly about Vegas is it ain't cheap. There are no combos here. Bought the smoky house burger and onion rings for a nice 17 dollar bill and was given a pager while they made the burger. The place itself was in a food court. Nothing too interesting to describe. I got the burger and it was OK. Patty was good but on the great side. The smokehouse sauce they put in it was really good and the bacon and onion ring on the burger you can't really go wrong with it. It was a fairly great which in my drunkenness i liked but once I sobered up turned me off. The onion rings side was also very great that it made it difficult to finish. All in all the burger was good enough to make it in the 3 stars area."}
{"text":"The last time I had eaten at Johnny Rockets was about 15 years ago before I moved out of the Phoenix area. It was the Arrowhead Mall location, and it was a great experience. Now that I'm back in town, I was bragging to my family about how great the food and service was. I mean really bragging. We were in the West Gate area, I saw they had a Johnny Rockets and thought we have to eat there. To our surprise we were in the time frame where kids eat free. Perfect ! The place was not busy, we were seated almost right away. We sat in the back where you can see everything that goes on in the kitchen. Later that would be a bad idea. Our waitress was very sweet but clueless. It took forever for the waitress to take our drink orders, then forever to receive them, again forever to take our food order and forever and 2 days for us to receive that. If thats not bad enough, I immediately noticed the cooks do not wear hair nets, were often scratching their head while gossiping and cooking our burgers. We were never asked if we wanted refills, hardly saw the waitress at all. Yet it was not busy which left us confused. Forget the jukebox, you'll waste your nickel, can't hear the music anyway. The food arrived stone cold. Needless to say I was embarrassed at the bragging I had recently done. However Its not Johnny Rockets itself, its the staff they choose to operate the business. I figured since we had so many negative experiences already, I just had a feeling the bill would come and it would show a charge for the childs meal which should have been free, what do you know, yes it did. I will never return here ever, ever, ever again. There are plenty of other eating establishments at West Gate, perhaps some with exceptional service. This establishment fell very, very short."}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for Johnny Rockets and it's about to expire so we stopped here on the way home from a show to use it.  My wife ordered the BBQ chicken bacon melt and I got the Philly Cheese Steak with peppers and mushrooms.  Both came with unlimited french fries.  We also got two large fries.

The sandwiches were OK.  Nothing exceptional nor were they less than anywhere else.  The fries were not salted after frying and they were dry and didn't hold salt once we got them.  Aside from that, it is a fast food court with a pizza shop and the staff went between the two as needed.  You place your order, are given a buzzer, and you get your tray when the buzzer goes off.

The sandwiches are overpriced.  Perhaps they're covering themselves from people who take advantage of the unlimited fries.  The service was slow.  There was one person ahead of us and we waited about 5 minutes for fast food.  Not good.  In addition, there are no plastic forks or knives available without asking.  I had to ask for artificial sweetener for the iced teas.  I could pay the same amount I paid tonight at many other sit down restaurants where I have servers bring my food in a much more appealing atmosphere.

If you're a fan of Johnny Rockets and buy a Groupon, it's best for a person going alone.  Use the Groupon to almost pay your entire tab at about 1/2 price.  That would be about what it's worth.  Johnny, I met you once.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Pricey, but the burger was restaurant quality so I'm ok with that. Fresh beef and veggies, made to order, fairly quick considering how busy it was. The two people I interacted with were both very nice. The restaurant was clean, and they had one person cleaning tables as fast as people were leaving them. I agree the service in any touristy place is lacking but they did a good job tonight. Choc shake is spendy but again, very good. At home I might not pay these prices, but on vacation it's all expensive, so might as well have something unique and tasty."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the burger I had. I got a bacon bbq one and one of the best burgers and buns-(i think butter bun) I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"Burger and Fries $16!

Luckily, I had a Groupon to use for this purchase because I thought for a burger and fries (no drink) for $16.11 is pretty pricey. Not to mention it was difficult to find this place inside the Excalibur Hotel and Casino. Coming from Mandalay Bay we had to cross the Luxor and into the Excalibur and go down the escalator to get to Johnny Rockets. The nice part was we didn't have to walk outside in the hot weather to get there.

After placing our order I was surprised that I was given a transporder machine thingie that buzzes you when your order was ready. Really? I thought it was a fast food joint.  I had the BACON CHEDDAR SINGLE - Smoked bacon, double cheddar cheese, iceberg lettuce, fresh tomato, white onion & special sauce. I must say that it was tasty and delicious but for $10.95, uh-uh! The fries is separate at $3.95. It had no taste. I had to add salt. 

There are lots and lots of places to eat in Las Vegas on the Strip alone so it is unlikely that we will be coming back in this location soon. The place was kept clean and staff was okay but must try other food places before coming back here...

{"text":"My wife worked for Red Robin for 25 years however Johnny Rockets truly  has one of the best tasting all american burgers we've  ever had.We got hooked and ate here three times in 5 days.This will always be my go to place in Vegas for a really good burger and an extremely  overpriced  Heineken ."}
{"text":"We love Johnny Rockets and this one is great. It is located in the Venetian Hotel near the Canal Shops. If you are staying at the hotel and don't want to pay so much for a room service burger, just go on over to Johnny Rockets, get all you want and more and take it back to your room, still hot and you are not broke.
The service at the counter is great and fast. The prices are reasonable and the burgers and shakes are just awesome. We went there three times while staying several night at the Venetian. My grandson loved it and so will you."}
{"text":"Want to eat something awesome in a place where employees will occasionally dance with the music? Then, Johnny Rockets is just the place to go. Modeled after an old-timey 1950's diner, Johnny Rockets has a nice retro look. The food is served quickly and tastes absolutely wonderful. The server we had was real polite. He kept regularly checking on us to see how everything was and if there was anything we needed. Every now and then, the employees would line up in the middle of the restaurant and start dancing to the music. They might have sung too, but I honestly can't remember. Either way, it gave my family and I something to laugh at later."}
{"text":"I needed a grilled cheese.  I was at work, having a rough day and couldn't think of a place near my new job.  Then I looked up the food establishments in the Meadows Mall.   The grilled cheese and fries were tasty, but this was the most I've paid for a grilled cheese in a long time.  I used to work downtown with a variety of options.  I paid as much of the grilled cheese and soda as I would have at a sit down restaurant.  Sitting at the food court is not as fancy.  But when I am in need again, I will probably return."}
{"text":"The wait time was absolutely ridiculous! We were forewarned it would be about 15 minutes, but it was more like 45. I don't know who chose the music selection, but let's just say it wasn't exactly appropriate for the restaurant. One of the cooks was more interested in his phone than actually cooking and serving food. There's plenty of other options at the mall to eat or even the surrounding area. I gave a 3 since our waiter was nice and the food was good with the exception of my mom's cold burger."}
{"text":"Everyone complaining about the long wait and expensive prices.. the burgers are all made to order and fresh! I thought their burgers where so tasty and worth the price and the wait. Wish they had one of these burger places at home in dublin :)"}
{"text":"juicy BIG hamburgers...big fries...fantastic shakes
very friendly staff

inside the santa fe station casino/hotel"}
{"text":"The food is average, you have to really do it up here and order one of their shakes and get the tastiest, most mouth-watering burger you can find on the menu and then it will be well worth it to eat here. I do like the variety they have on the menu. The waiter seemed to be like a shy little kid, but overall the service was efficient enough and extremely helpful. You will be full after leaving this place. The mini jukebox on the table was also a fun addition."}
{"text":"Well, it is Vegas but wow! Most expensive hamburger in my life. It tasted good (not great). Onion rings were good too as was my malt. They were quick getting our meal out but poor kids working were clearly burnt out & going through the motions. They were polite but not the same level of service as Snack Shake."}
{"text":"This Johnny Rockets is located inside the food court at the Flamingo Casino. I love their chili cheese fries with onions! This restaurants opens til very late for those that get hungry from gambling or after the club. Nothing too spectacular about this location. All you see at late night are drunk loud people here. People just because you are drunk does not mean it gives you the right to make a mess for the employees to clean up.  Clean up after yourself and stop spilling stuff all over the floor!"}
{"text":"Waitress Nicole is awesome! I have asked for a caramel shake each time I have come here only to be told it's seasonal..and she doesn't hesitate to make me one \"in the back\". Great service and my kids like the grilled cheese and fries"}
{"text":"We had very good burgers and shakes.
The service was excellent.
The only bad thing was soggy bacon on my burger.
The atmosphere is great with all the 50's decor"}
{"text":"Being new to the valley we saw this fun themed diner and thought it would be a fun easy meal. We were wrong.  It was 6:45 and they had closed bar seating. No big deal, but that should have clued us in that this place is not busy for a typical meal time. My husband ordered a burger and a malt and I ordered a burger and a malt. Both burgers were to be without onion. When the malts came, 1 was a malt the other was a shake. Not what we had ordered. Then When the burgers came one had onions and one did not. Also not what we had ordered. They had to remake the onion filled burger. It was also clear the fry oil hadn't been changed in quite sometime. The fries, and tots were clearly fried with onion rings and the taste was soaked through our sides. Skip the gimmick.. the only thing this place has going for it is a theme."}
{"text":"A really fresh, juicy burger that was not overdone with a side of perfectly crisped onion rings and salted-just-enough fries. This was a great late lunch that hit the spot!"}
{"text":"Dancing with smiling faces! Improvement!! Thx for listening:)

No military discount at this location! Only Meadows Mall:("}
{"text":"Love a place that honors the US MILITARY!  This location is at the Meadows Mall and offers 10% off  to military families with a valid ID. Please note the Fashion Mall Johnny Rockets does not offer the mil discount:( but the burgers there are just as good.

Took the kids here and we all had wonderful burgers, shakes and fries. Great customer service despite they were getting ready to close, great food!"}
{"text":"It's been 2 1/2 days and my husband just starting to feel better and gain his strength back.  I filed a complaint with the corporate office of Johnny Rockets and have left 2 messages with the area vice president."}
{"text":"Yesterday I came to this location for the first time and ordered the crispy club salad for lunch. It was so good that I got another one for dinner, and am now back again today for my third. Delicious! The location is clean and nicely decorated. Yes, there were teens staffing the location last night, but I don't see this as an issue (unlike some other reviewers). It's not fine dining, folks, so stop expecting it to be. I'll keep coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Food taste good (even though it was cold!) but the service is horrible. My and other customers' order were ready but were just sitting out getting cold. I had to go up to get my food since I wasn't getting paged. I contacted corporate and never heard back. Won't go back again. I'll try Five Brothers next door instead."}
{"text":"Four stars just for the delicious chocolate shake that they offer.
The consistency is amazingly thick but just perfect to squeeze through a straw.
I crave for it every week. 
Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Best cashier/worker CALVIN! He's super friendly and awesome! Yummy yummy burgers and such, as well!!!"}
{"text":"Overall, this is a good location (who knew that they closed down the food court at San Tan??), where you can get a quick bite before a movie or recharge after a day of shopping. The food is ok. The burgers are decent, but definitely nothing to brag about and are a little pricey for what you get. The service can be spotty, so if you come during a rush, don't be surprised if you have to wait a few minutes before someone is able to acknowledge you or seat you.

The server we had on my most recent visit here was really sweet and friendly, she was still in training, but she did a great job of keeping water glasses full and experimenting on her ketchup faces with us. :)"}
{"text":"I never tried this place as I just thought it'd be expensive.

I was wrong as their prices were very fair.

Burgers are less than $10 but don't include fries.

I took my little bro and my cousin as they love burgers.

Both with big appetites they loved their meals.

I got a water, strawberry Oreo shake, and chicken fingers with the half fries half onion rings basket.

As the onion rings and fries were more to have a complete meal, we all actually shared just one basket.

The burgers were priced right for their size and the amount of toppings.

One of the boys was unable to finish his double western cheese burger and the other devoured their burger with jalapeños.

My chicken fingers were okay. 

I didn't like the flavor of the breading, it was a bit salty in an off putting way.

Everything was served hot and our waiter was very attentive with refills and bringing out our food together.

The place was pretty vacant which sucked but probably was probably the reason behind the great service.

Love the old school interior and music and wait staff outfits.


And my shake was awesome!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a quick lunch. I couldn't make up my mind on the question of fries or onion rings. They have a great menu option of half fries and half onion rings. The problem was that the onion rings are mediocre:(  I had the chicken tenders. It was a huge portion. I couldn't finish it. I did not really want to anyway. They taste more of flour than chicken. It was a disappointment. I should have just thrown caution to the wind and had a chocolate shake instead of the whole meal. I hear they are good. The ice tea on the bright side is fresh and washed it all down."}
{"text":"This location is not a true Johnny Rockets food suck you get better food at McDonald's 
Food suck so much I'm angered for spending $28 for this quality"}
{"text":"It has been years since I've had the opportunity to eat at a Johnny Rockets. My husband and youngest child had never been. So I was excited to be able to take them to a place that I had considered to have the best hamburgers ever. We walked in the place was very clean the staff was friendly and we were seated immediately. We got our drinks and menus pretty fast. The waitress and the girl shadowing her came and quickly got our drink orders. They were delivered to our table in a timely fashion. However, it took quite a while for her to return to take our order. That was a little frustrating.
 When they finally did come they were very nice and pleasant to deal with and took our order. Our loaded fries came pretty quick, and the meals very soon after. I had gotten  the single Patty cheeseburger and requested  no tomato  and no special sauce,  and I received tomato  but no onion. It was a little weird. There is only one female restroom and one male restroom, meaning, only one person at a time can go. The restrooms are located right by the kitchen door where the waiters and waitresses come in and out of at a pretty quick pace. This makes standing outside waiting for the bathroom to be available a little awkward. I had to go and hunt down our servers to ask them for our check. 
The food wasn't as delicious as I remember it being. The girl that was shadowing our  waitress was really friendly and always had a smile on her face, she will do well there. While I don't think I'll be very excited to return, at least to that location, I am glad that I had a chance to visit with my son and my youngest child"}
{"text":"What's going on here???

I'm still a fan of Johnny Rockets' burgers, especially their Rocket Double.  Their burgers taste similar to Fatburger in my opinion.  Burgers are usually juicy and what sets them apart is their seasoned bun.  

But my most recent visit wasn't as good.  First issue was that no one was at the counter or even the cooking area.  They even have a bell by the register, which only means they do this a lot. I didn't ring the bell because it's their job to service me, not mine to request for service.  One of the employees noticed me, apologized about the wait, and took my order.  I wasn't a jerk, but he could tell I didn't look happy.  He did his best and I credit him for that. 

Francine G. gave them 1 start for poor service and a long wait.  I had just okay service, but also a long wait. For a FF Burger Joint, shouldn't take longer than 20 minutes for a burger, honestly.  It did and glad it didn't take 45 mins like it did for Francine. 

Burger this time wasn't juicy.  In fact, it was a bit dry.  

This visit was 2 stars at most during this visit, but I have also received 4 star service/quality in the past at this location.  So, my overall right now is 3 stars.  

NOTE:  Aliante is no longer a Station Casino. I can't place it yet, but a lot of things at this casino has changed.  See Aliante review update."}
{"text":"Looking forward to eating here at 7pm and they said they were changing their frying oil so we could only have a burger and nothing else... how insane .. an hour to change oil? During dinner hours? Management ? Owners ? Approve of this? Ridiculous loosing so many customers ....."}
{"text":"We came in today at 8. They don't close till 9. When we tried to order a milk shake the guy at counter just flat out said no. Cause he did t wanna clean the machine again. Why would you stop serving an hour before you close? When people know you for burgers and shakes."}
{"text":"Worst service ever, this people think that make you a favor selling you the food, when I ask for jalapeños that told me I have to pay extra dollar and something and make a line again just to pay the jalapeños I ask why you didn't tell me when I ordered the food and he replay \"Did you ask\", I replay because is the first time that some try to charge extra for the jalapeños for a hamburger,"}
{"text":"2nd visit to this location and both times was perfect. Not sure why theyres so much negativity about this location, our every visit the staff has been amazing, the food was just as ordered and yummy; no complaints here."}
{"text":"I would have to disagree with the average rating of 3. My experience there was excellent. The burger # 21 was absolutely delicious and gigantic. Fries were hot and just the right doneness. The server was pleasant and fast. For a great burger lunch it only cost 2 of us $20.  To top it off an older couple was dancing to the oldie music that was playing from the juke box. Loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Classic diner food, I had the steak and cheese sandwich which was good.  Lean meat sandwich with hot, crunchy  french fries.  The service was a bit sucky though.  Maybe it was too close to closing time, but the server had all the personality of a mannequin, although the food did come out in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Veggie burger and onion rings. Good choice!"}
{"text":"Alicia was super courteous and sweet. Made our experience at Aliante great. She checked on me and my friend multiple times, even thought it was past 2 AM."}
{"text":"I've definitely had better service. I've definitely had better Johnny's. So, I wasn't that surprised when I didn't have a great experience.

My Peanut Butter Chocolate Milk Shake was superb. I'm talking extremely delightful. The burger on the other hand was a bit meh. Nothing spectacular. Nothing mind blowing. Simply an average burger.

The service sucked hardcore. I'm not talking Cinemax After Dark here, I'm talking that crazy stuff you come across on the internet that you instantly clear your cache, cookies, and history for. It just was overall absent. I had to actively search out help. I wish they would pay attention to their customers."}
{"text":"I can't stress how disappointed I was with this location. 
I ordered the Mexican Chipotle Guac burger with water and my boyfriend orders a Patty Melt with an ice tea. The waitress brings our drinks out and first thing I see is a fly floating in my water. I'm sorry but it was a large fly, you could have avoided that situation promptly but sat down the drinks walked away. We sent both of our drinks backs, just because I don't know if that came from the fact that you left your ice area completely exposed and open allowing flys to get in there but we gave up on the drinks and tried to wing the food.

Next comes the food. My 'Mexican Chipotle Guac Burger' was pretty much a guac burger. I had a spot of chipotle sauce on the bun that I couldn't even taste and the burger was dry and overcooked. My boyfriends patty melt had burnt onions and his burger was also dry and overcooked. At this point, I'm irritated and upset. I asked the waitress to take the food back and I'll pay for the fries we ate. While I offered to pay for my fries, you would have thought she would have said don't worry about it and let us go on our way. False. She charged us for the fries and didn't come back to our table but sent over what I assume was her manager. 

The whole experience was really a let down as I remember the first time going to a Johnny Rockets some 20 years ago and never having a negative experience since. This most definitely left a for lack of better words \"bad taste\" in my mouth and I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Me and my wife had the mini chili dogs burger and fries and a shake. all was good I will come back again. It's open 24 hours stop in any time"}
{"text":"Just left Johnny rockets. 

Will never go back. 

We are a pretty forgiving couple. Don't have high expectations. 

Prices are a little high for what you receive. We ordered a Houston burger and and Route 66 burger, one with onion rings and one with fries.  Plus a orange dreamcicle and a Oreo Shake. 

Route 66 burger: 5/10. Unevenly seasoned. Tasted quite peppery in the Center. Other than that and \"ok\" burger. 

Houston burger: 6/10. Not bad flavour, not very spicy as they advertise. 

Onion rings: Were great. Crunchy, flavourful.  Dipping sauce tasted like Kraft ranch. 

Fries: Nothing special. Like any other fry joint. 

Oreo Shake:  started off bad flavours but grew on her. Still not fabulous or worth $6.99 as we did not finish it. 

Orange Dreamcicle: tasted orangish, but that's it. Also not worth $6.99. Did not finish it. 

Water was best thing we had. 

Walk the extra block and goto Five guys and fries.

Edit: washrooms were a joke as well. Door was so close to the toilet that if the seat is off to the side a bit the door hits it and gets caught up."}
{"text":"I'm just going to say it, Monte Carlo probably has the worse food in Las Vegas. I ate at the Buffet on my most recent trip and a year prior, I ate at the Nathan's on the inside. I must say it's been a poor experience with the food. This Johnny Rocket's burger was no different. 
I ordered a standard cheeseburger with fries and last time I had Johnny Rockets, it was pretty good and tasty. This time the burger was bland and tiny, partially do to the bun being pretty smashed on the side. The fries were stale and cold and the few tater tots (a nice surprise) were very hard. Overall, the food was not great and I probably won't ever step foot back into the Monte Carlo food court ever."}
{"text":"Long wait for the food after I ordered. I got a single rocket. It was dry and over cooked. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I love the idea of the 50s style restaurant. But what I am not in love with is just a really bad greasy burger.

When you go to a 50s style restaurant like this you expect better food. It should be cooked with quality and pride like they did in the 50s. Honestly smash burger is a much better Burger for the same or less money.

There are better places to eat a good burger. I would not recommend eating here if you want a really good burger. Only eat here if you want fast food ... That is expensive and very greasy"}
{"text":"I'm an Northwest guy, having lived outside of Portland and Seattle for maybe nine years.  So when my brother got tired of the overcast skies and moved to the greater Phoenix area, I decided it was a great chance to get some sun myself.

We saw the review for Johnny Rockets and couldn't pass up the onion rings.  Don't get me wrong, they were good, but probably not good enough to deserve an extra star.  Call me a foodie, but I want something to really wow my taste buds.

On the overall, this place had an awesome atmosphere.  It was a bit early, maybe 10 or 11am, so not too many people.  At each table they have a small Jukebox, and when you sit down your waiter or waitress gives you five nickels so that you can pick some music (songs are only 5 a selection).

I ordered the Route 66 burger (mushroom burger) and my brother ordered some bacon burger.  I saw a sign in the restaurant that recommended my choice, but it was definitely a let down.  Not much flavor.  Sorta greasy, but lack of any flavor sorta killed it.  Actually, it was one of the worst mushroom burgers I've had, don't know how they screwed that one up.

Now my brother loved his bacon burger, and I had a bite.  It was really good.  I guess I should never underestimate the power of bacon.  We never got a chance for a milkshake though, as the burgers were pretty filling.

Last thing I should mention though is the dancing.  I think that everyone can agree two white boys getting down to Funky Town is hilarious, but for the whole song is a little much.  We felt so bad for them we left some extra tip.  Johnny Rockets, why can't you hire women to dance to music for our pleasure?  Why did it have to be men?  I probably would have added an extra star for female amusement.

And btw, I don't know what was wrong with our jukebox, cause I could not get Jimmy Buffet's Cheeseburger in Paradise to play.  They other songs worked, but why not Jimmy Buffet? :-)"}
{"text":"Why does it take 10 mins for them to make a simple shake ? It was not even busy and every time I come here they are super slow . Please hire a more efficient staff as half of the employees were standing around pretending to work"}
{"text":"I know I'm in Las Vegas in vacation and I expect prices to be higher. But $18 for a meal that didn't taste worthy of $8.. lesson learned. I first had Johnny Rockets on a cruise ship a few years back and remembered it to be a fun, good burger place. I expected that to still be the case being in vegas.. but when I was greeted by the monotone cashier, I knew it wasn't going to be a mind blowing experience. The burger looked amazing, but when I first bit into it.. I was met with an oozing amount of grease. As I took my second bite, I wondered why the most prominent taste I was getting was the ketchup. If I'm craving a burger .. I will hit the strip next time ."}
{"text":"I really miss the old johnny rockets:( this new look is kinda blah . Also they don't have a hamburger sliders !!!!! That sucks ! I would come here just for them:/ this Johnny Rockets has let me down sorry ."}
{"text":"This is late night drinking food place, so I wasn't expecting that much.  I had the rocket burger it was a little dry and thin, the tomato was way larger then the burger, maybe the double burger would be better.   The fries were just ok.  So if you've been drinking and in the flamingo you could do worse.  I would stumble down to the casino royal for a $1.99 hot dog or go south to planet dailies at planet hollywood."}
{"text":"Chicken sandwich: chicken tasted like it was made in a microwave. Not even fully cooked.

Sweet potato fries: old, soggy and some of them were burned to a crisp with the same microwave preparation. Like old lady titties.

That Milkshake though! If love had a taste it would be a vanilla milkshake from Johnny Rockets. Only my second milkshake ever from here and it was beautiful, like two butterflies making love atop tulips

I didn't eat the cherry, though. I'm a grown ass man. Can't be eating cherries with whipped cream in public.

I don't know why I expected Jonathan Rocket to make a good chicken sammich."}

He brightened up my day and I will definitely come back to Johnny Rockets. He definitely needs a praise for all the energy he puts into making sure all of this customers are happy."}
{"text":"I went here over the weekend to meet up with some family. 

They seated us quickly. Our server was fast and friendly. 

The orders came out almost correct. 

The burgers aren't much to write about. They are edible. But not spectacular by any means. 

I ordered mine with half fries half onion rings. They brought me 3 broken up onion rings, the onion rings are not fresh and for sure come from a freezer bag. 

At one point the music got cranked up super loud and then the staff proceeded to \"dance\" They all looked uncomfortable \"dancing\" and it made me uncomfortable to watch them. They should do away with this unless they are going to take a valiant effort to actually dance. 

Will I go back to this place? Who knows."}
{"text":"What a ripoff.  They had a special events menu with burgers over $12.  Fries were undercooked.  Shakes 1/3 whipped cream without the extra on the side you always get.  Waitress tried to hurry us out to get more people in to rip off.  Never again."}
{"text":"This place routinely has the absolute worst service.  The first time my 2 kids and I went there, it took like 45 mins to get served.  THIS IS A MALL PEOPLE! Now tonight, my kids have forgot the pain from the last time, but they said they wanted to eat there again. I overpaid for the kids tenders. While they were waiting for their food, I went to another restaurant and got my food.  I came back to the table where my kids were still waiting. I ate my whole dinner (slowly), while they were STILL waiting. So now as I have nothing to do while waiting for them to finish eating dinner, I'm writing this review. Smh..."}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would. This review is based solely on their service. It was horrific, dirty and unorganized. We waited an hour for chicken tenders that never came."}
{"text":"This location has some huge opportunities with staff and facilities. Our we went there on a Friday evening just before Halloween). It was busy but not so much as a wait. Our waitress didn't seem to want to be there that night. Other patrons would not control their own children and it seemed like a circus.  The restroom has not been cleaned up or restocked in some time and just smelled horrible. Hopefully it was an isolated issue but I have a feeling its not."}
{"text":"Our server here was Thomas and his AMAZING.  He was polite, friendly, funny, professional and I watched him juggle multiple people and orders and request quickly and efficiently.  I was so impressed with him I wanted to steal him away to hire him to work for me.  Johnny Rockets you seriously should give him his own franchise to run.

Thank you for all you do Thomas!"}
{"text":"Horrible place loved coming here till I came and got a small menu saying special event menu. There was barely 12 people in here and they has 3 choices of food you can get. Not happy server was nice so I just ordered a shake and left"}
{"text":"If dining at Johnny Rockets is supposed to be fun, this was far from it. An overpriced menu with lackluster food combined with clueless employees sets you up for an experience that you might consider skipping. Considering the restaurant was less than half full, waiting for 30+ minutes for a few burgers, a salad and chili bowl seemed a little long. I ordered the chicken club salad. Although plentiful in size, it definitely lacked in the toppings department. Chicken was advertised in their menu as thick slices, but instead I received morsel sized pieces of chicken. Hey, at least I didn't need to slice it up, right? My buddy ordered a chocolate milkshake which I tasted and found to be very thick and delicious. Long story short, skip this place the next time you're at Kennywood and opt for a couple orders of potato patch fries."}
{"text":"The good: The milkshake was delicious. Hence the 2*

The Bad: $7 for a shake isn't a joke esp when the quantity is so little. The quantity has gone down a lot compared to before. It's not worth it anymore. Denny's shakes equal and better. 

The service. Horrendous. 15 min wait for 2 shakes. Seriously. Didn't even bring or ask for water. Rude waiter. When asked why it was taking so long, replied in a rude way that the other customers needed to be served. There were 3 other tables total 7 more people in the restaurant... Some came after and a bunch before. An three waiters.. 

Last visit."}
{"text":"While waiting in line to order, a lady waked up to the counter and asked for her money back because her burger was ice cold. This didn't make me change my mind about ordering. I waited about 10 minutes just to get a burger and chili fries. When I bit into the burger it was hot. But unfortunately about half way through, the burger was cold. Guess the lady wasn't crazy :-) I went back up to the counter because I was not going to waste $8 throwing away the burger. The manager was standing right there so I told him (Eric I think) what was wrong and he asked if I wanted a new burger or just my money back. He didn't seem concerned about the cold burger. I asked for my money back. I continued to watch the manager when I went back to the table and he never talked to the cook about the cold patties. The chili fries were delicious and hot."}
{"text":"Great food. We've eaten at a lot of Johnny rockets in CA and NV. The food is always consistent but the one at Bally's Las Vegas is by far the most boring. No dancing no smiley faces on the fry plate rarely even see the staff."}
{"text":"Needless to say I was not surprised upon seeing 2.5 stars when I looked this location up on Yelp today! I live in Scottsdale, but my dog was at a vet in the area and I needed something to eat in the meantime. I picked this place because I enjoy a good burger and fries and I know this place has been around for a long time. I haven't been here in probably 10-15 years though. The food was just OK, but the service was awful. I would give it 2.5 stars if I could.

I asked for a water with lemon. We put in our order but he didn't bring me a water until almost 10 minutes later. When we put our order in, we also asked for the 1/2 fries/rings combo that they offer. When the food finally came out, they didn't bring our rings/fries. Our waiter disappeared so I couldn't ask him where they were. Also, they never gave us any utensils or napkins. I tried to get the attention of a girl who was serving the table next to us, but she continuously ignored me. We were almost done with our food when I went to find the general manager, who was very nice, but looked like he was 16. Told him we never got our sides or any napkins with our meal and he made sure they finally came out, but we were almost done with the food. The burger was boring. Nothing compared to the delicious burgers elsewhere (I.e. Habit, Portillos). the fries were eh.  the rings were alright, a little too thick for my rings preference. My mom enjoyed her grilled cheese sandwich. The plain fact is that our waiter ignored us most of the time when it wasn't even busy. 
 
When we got our bill, they left the rings/fries combo on there which was about $4. My mom asked the manager if he would take them off since we got them way late. Our server said he thinks there was a mix-up and they gave our side dish to someone else. EVEN if that was the case, it doesn't take a lot of time to put a couple of fries and onion rings on a small plate and toss it on the table. Yeesh.

Not ever coming back here. Only good part was the GM who was very nice and took care of our requests. Waste of money and my taste buds deserve better."}
{"text":"Went here this evening with my family. We walked in and there were plenty of empty booths but the sign said please wait to be seated.  We waited almost 10 mins and employees kept walking by and no one greeted us. We finally sat ourselves which was a mistake.  After another 15 mins we finally got service but instead of asking what drinks we wanted she said \"are you ready to order?\" As if we were an inconvenience being there.  We got food and shakes and luckily the food came out fast but it was horrible.  We told the waitress to cancel the shakes because we were almost done eating but they brought them out anyways. I saw at least 10 people walk out while we were there. I can understand being short staffed but on the night of a coyotes game you know Westgate is going to be packed. The least the waitress could have done was just apologize for everything taking so long.  I will definitely not be going back ever!!!"}
{"text":"If the long wait durning a slow time wasn't bad enough, the burger was a mangled, unattractive and straight average-tasting mess.

The upside was that the fries were solid."}

{"text":"This is our second Johnny Rockets and the one in Nashville was at least 1 star better than this one. The hamburger fell apart, came with to many very dill pickles and the sauce was loaded with mustard. I knew better, but tried a strawberry shake that was thick with no real strawberries and super sweet. Should have stuck with water like my wife did. The food was hot and the buns were NOT spongy - sticky and the fries were ok. The best I can say is \"It's OK\" but I would go with the anything Asian  next time."}
{"text":"I'll tell you what.  The food was ok, as JR always is but the server at the bar (Thomas) was absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"I'm so sorry Red Robin that I cheated on you with Johnny. It was an accident. It will never happen again! 

My brother really wanted to eat here and because I'm a sucker for new experiences, I didn't mind trying it out. It wasn't all that bad. The service was good and the waitress came to check up on us just the right amount. My Boca patty was juicy and although they didn't add (yet charged me for) an egg in my burger, it was not the worst burger I had. I was surprised that I had to order fries separate from my burger because at Johnny's they don't come together and they charge you 3.00 or more for it. So my whole meal came out to just over $10.00. At Red Robin I would have paid just as much but with a HUGE burger and ENDLESS FRIES. 

Sigh. But I must say, very juicy patty. That was the only good part. We left and we're still kinda hungry after that small burger and side of fries. We ended up at Taco Bell later. If you want nostalgia, go to Johnny's. For a serious burger, go to Red Robin!! Mmmmm, steak fries!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to The Fashion Show for many years and this was the first time I came to Johnny Rockets and loved it . The burger was so perfectly cooked.  Ana was so sweet and friendly.  Ana paid attention to our needs and was fast with her service.  It was a great experience"}
{"text":"We went here yesterday for lunch since my eye doctor's appt. was nearby (across the way, inside the Fashion Show Mall, right near Nordstrom). We asked if they would take the Entertainment Book Coupon and they accepted it, even though the location was not specified on the back (that's why it never hurts to ask). This was nice. 

Nice staff greeting- this is a 50's type place, with the staff wearing the hats, and complete outfits which match the overall theme of the restaurant- and they do a dance every once in a while, too. We didn't wait for a table. We got the corner one facing the mall, so it was prime people- watching property ('course they all stare at us when we're eating our food, too, haha). BTW, these restaurants are popping up in other malls in the city, like the Meadows.     

I usually get a chicken sandwich, but I opted for the Chicken Philly, with mushrooms, peppers, and onions and choice of cheese- I chose swiss, @ $10.99, this time. My husband got his favorite, a bbq sauce style burger. The crispy golden fries come with the sandwich here (not at the Paradise location- we've been there, many times). My sandwich was pretty big and the fries were too much for me to eat (only had a portion). My husband's burger was different, but better, and he couldn't place it; what made it better this time. I told him, maybe it was the place. I would definitely get the Chicken Philly again- it was really very good, the bread was soft, the veggies made it more filling too, and the seasoning used on the chicken was really good- didn't need anything else. 

Our server was very nice and so was the rest of the staff. My husband thought the dance was goofy, but I liked the fun in it; kinda went with the whole 1950's feeling of a diner, the Grease version anyway."}
{"text":"Joined the club, got a coupon  (in my email, you must print it out) for a free burger. Came here when the little one turned 6 months old, after the photo shoot.

I'm not a meat & potatoes girl (more like chicken, fish, turkey, and produce), but when I want a burger, only a few places come to mind immediately (red robin, islands, omelet house). This is one of them. 

Been to the paradise location many times, but this was a first at the meadows mall. The atmosphere is a little different, since it's on the edge of the Food Court, upper level. The three people working there (in 1950s uniform and hats) were really nice, attentive. The decor is 1950s  (just like the others) and the seating options are (1) on the stools/bar surrounding the semi-open kitchen (2) order for takeout (the line for this option, is on the right), sit elsewhere in the food court (tables & chairs- which means, more room). We didn't have to worry about the stroller being in the way because we were on one side of the restaurant. 

We all ordered burgers and then when we saw one person in our party's milkshake, we all ended up ordering one too! The burgers are really good, juicy, and not greasy (not messy on your hands, yuck). Here, the fries come with the burger (at the paradise one, the fries are ala carte), so my husband said that the prices even out. 

This is one of the newer locations, so the place is spotless. (The one at the Fashion Show Mall opened up before this one.) 

A dependable spot for burgers & shakes. It might be a little pricey compared to the other eateries in the mall, but I've been to a few of those places (meh, alright, so/so), and paying the extra $ is worth it."}
{"text":"The original location- been here about five times- solid place. Feels like you're in the 1950's-  the servers wear the cute outfits with the funny hats. Seat yourself. There are jukeboxes at each table- place a nickel for each song that you want- mostly 50s, 60s, and 70s.

Good burgers at reasonable prices. Sometimes I get the chicken sandwich- equally good. The fries are good. I don't think that we've ever been disappointed. There have been two openings in two malls here, recently, so I believe that the popularity is catching."}
{"text":"I was surprised.  This place used to be good.  Service was slow, so I thought I was gonna get a fresh burger. The meat was good. The bun was old. And the fries were cold. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Scottsdale Fashion Square closes at 9PM... I came in with a friend & after a bit of conversation & raving to him about how good the milkshakes are at Johnny Rockets, I decided that I wanted to get one... I came to the counter to place my order. The guy at the register barely made eye contact & proceeded to tell me that he \"just shut the milkshake machine down\"... The thing is, I came to the counter at approximately 8:45PM... You guys don't close until 9PM.. So you shut down your shake machine 15 minutes before you actually close? Seriously, who the Hell does that? Screw us folks who may want a milkshake anytime during the last 15 minutes prior to closing I guess... Rude service & lack of customer focus is the reason for the one star rating as the food is great once you're actually able to place an order: If someone from higher up takes ownership & makes an effort to retrain their staff at this location so that this type of foolishness doesn't continue to happen then I will gladly update my review. Otherwise, it will remain just like this. Goodluck to all who may visit Johnny Rockets at a late hour as you just might have a taste for a milkshake only to be let down in the end!"}
{"text":"Perfect place for a great American lunch. The burgers were awesome in taste and were juicy."}
{"text":"Food was ok but disappointed they charge 1.25 additional to a kids burger to add cheese then another 1.89 to get a shake with kids meal."}
{"text":"While a nice diner concept, a throwback to the 60s or whatever, wasn't really impressed with the service/attitude.  Just here to get a takeout chocolate milkshake, which was way too sweet, you'll taste more than the chocolate.  

Located ground level of the mall."}
{"text":"It was about 8:15pm last night when my family decided to have dinner at Johnny Rockets since we had been walking the mall for a few hours (Holiday Season) and so we were very thirsty and hungry.  We stood at the \"wait to be seated\" area for a few minutes until we were finally noticed by the cook. The cook  noticed us first and was trying to get the hosts attention but she was busy talking (socializing) with a man (which could easily have been a customer but seemed like it was someone she knew personally) at the bar/kitchen area and didnt hear the cook trying to get her attention.  She finally glanced over at us and came our way. We were a party of 6 and a high chair and so we asked if we can sit in the \"outside section.\" This would be more convenient for us since we had shopping bags and a stroller. She said a part of that section had been closed down already and so we could only sit on the other half side of that section.  The front entrance is very narrow and so we had to take the stroller through the outside part of it and around into the small gate. The stroller still wouldnt fit through the tables there and the host asked if we could leave it next to a table right by the entrance of the small gate. (fine whatever we could still see it where we were sitting not a big deal) We waited for the host/waitress or whomever  to come over with a high chair or atleast offer us one since they just saw us come in with a stroller that had to be left at the entrance. We waited a few minutes until I had to ask for a high chair and thats when she brought it. One of the chairs at the table was dirty (bread crumbs and onions on the chair). We asked for napkins and specifically mentioned it was for a dirty chair. The waitress laid them on the table and didnt bother to clean the chair herself (fine no big deal, I guess).  We sat down and got our menus and she took our drink orders (3 fountain drinks, 3 shakes). After our drink order was taken, 2 other tables 2 people each were seated and since our stroller was \"in the way\" we were asked if we can actually move it on the outside  part of the gate next to our table. I jokingly said to them, we'll move it outside but if someone passes by and takes our stroller youre jumping over the gate to chase them down and we kind of laughed it off but I was actually annoyed at the whole stroller situation and just the way things started out. It was obviously too early for you to close off half of the section of tables being that it is the Holiday Season and so you are prone to have more customers at that time.
Ok...so from there, the 2 tables that came in after us got their drinks AND food before us eventhough she took our order befire them!!! I understand the food part, I guess, since they were only 2 people per table (4people) and we were 6 people, BUT C'MON atleast bring our drinks!!!! At that point I was ready to leave but we  were all so hungry and I was sooo thirsty so I thought I would finally say something. I flagged down our waitress and told her to atleast bring our drinks because we were thirsty and the other tables were already served with both food and drinks. She said ok I'll bring them right now. And she did...so why couldnt she do that before?? Im not sure if she was just annoyed at the fact that we were a \"big\" party and had children with us or what.  So we finally got our food also and everything was perfect from there. The food was awesome and she kept checking in on us.  We still tipped her although it would have been more if the overall experience would have been better. Its unfortunate to see bad customer service in a place where the food is actually good! We will not be coming back to this location being that they obviously prefer smaller parties with no kids and definitely NO strollers."}
{"text":"Admits the anti JRs, I personally am a huge fan of their service and food.  There is a new floor manager and she seems to run a pretty tight ship.  I love critics when it comes to fast food joints just seems crazy to me some of the negative comments.

The endless fries are great, they are the big thick ones.  It is defiantly worth the price and the shakes are great!"}
{"text":"I was supposed to meet my friend next door at Capriotti's Sandwich Shop.  When I arrived, he wanted Johnny Rocket's instead.  I had read all about Capriott's on Yelp, so I was excited to try it.  I begrudgingly agreed to eat at Johnny Rocket's, but it turned out to be a great meal and experience.

The staff were super friendly at Johnny Rocket's.  Especially the girl with the big blue eyes.  She answered all of my many questions that I had because I hadn't been to Johnny Rocket's often.  She filled me on their new food items that I was totally unfamiliar with.  After talking to her, I decided on the Philly Cheesesteak with fries.  It was super tasty, and I was glad to have ordered it.  It turned out to be an unexpectedly excellent meal.

It honestly felt weird to be on vacation at a place like Las Vegas with a million restaurants around and eating at Johnny Rockets.  However, I was glad that I did.  I had a great experience and would not mind coming here again the next time I am in the area."}
{"text":"Great food and great staff, love the burgers and shakes! This place never fails , their burgers are juicy and the shakes are thick  would recommend to all my friends!"}
{"text":"Food was good (same as last time - and as always when I go) but they lose a star for service.  Look, you may hate your job, and hate the singing in front of everybody part of it, but YOU signed up for it.  If you don't like it - go get a new job!

Good thing I like their burgers so much or this might have annoyed me enough to not go back!"}
{"text":"I don't know if it's this location, but the service here takes forever! We got our fries first then had to wait another 30 mins for our burgers! Unbelievable. No sense of urgency here."}
{"text":"This review is for the Johnny Rockets in Bally's.  My friend was balls deep in dehydration and hadn't eaten anything all day and so we settled for what was closest which turned out to be the food court where this Johnny Rockets laid inside.  I wouldn't be writing this review if it wasn't for our high energy, enthusiastic, catering host, Tom.  His service level was exemplary considering this is vegas and half his eaters are probably drunk or moody.  He definitely deserves some accolade from upper management.  On top of this the food was cooked and put together well.  Our chicken sandwiches and burgers were tender, juicy, and just what we needed, so props to the cooking staff too."}
{"text":"We love Johnny Rockets. I am not sure what goes on at this location-or if it was just an off day-but the chicken sandwich was inedible. It tasted like nuked chicken. 

The shakes were the normal quality-great shakes. Servers were very kind-would have been a one star but not for these two positives. 

Our recommendation is to pass on this location. Not a fair example of a typical Johnny Rockets quality."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my burger. It was good to me, maybe cz i was super haangry! Sucks that everything is ala carte. A little pricey for a burger and fries. We ordered one krispy creme donut for 2$ and it wasnt even fresh."}
{"text":"I tried their Chicken Club with sweet potato fries and it wasn't bad at all, just can't say it was really good. The chicken was grilled, which I prefer rather than fried and the bacon was crispy. I got it on rye bread. Being able to have it made the way you  like it is nice, but the sandwich had 3 pieces of bread which I think is unnecessary. Why not just top the chicken with bacon and lettuce rather than squeezing a piece of bread in between? Sweet potato fries was super soggy by the time I got to work so I was a little disappointed, I'm pretty sure it would be amazing if I had it right away. 
Service was good, my food was made pretty fast and the lovely lady was very friendly and polite. 
The counter was very clean but it way of been because I was there around 11am on a weekday. It may be more packed and crazy over the weekend or in the afternoons, being that it's a mall."}
{"text":"Our boys love the double bacon cheddar. Best burger around. Place was just renovated and it looks great. Only downside is that their is only a total of 2 bathrooms. One for women and 1 for men, with one stall each. So it's a pain in the butt sometimes with the wait. Especially if it's busy. We still love the place."}
{"text":"Johnny rockets was amazing the food was great and so,was the service. I recommend this to everyone"}
{"text":"We had dinner before our evening began so we didn't try their burgers.  Michael and Mason enjoyed the chilli fries.  When ordering the chilli fries make sure you order regular fries too.  My new found favorite onion rings are from Johnny Rockets!  They were tasty and very crispy, love love them for a snack:)  I will go again for the onion rings!  We took a strawberry banana shake to go, it was creamy with fresh chucks of strawberries and bananas...very good!"}
{"text":"Balleys has a great food court with legit choices when you are eating on the run or after hours. My wife and I ate here on our way down to the pool. The burger and fries hit after a long night. Mostly,  the service was great. THOMAS is the truth, great personal service, he inspired me to be better and more positive in my job and with people. He cares about his job and service. We came back the 2nd day because of him. My wife had the chicken sandwich that was very tender and i upgraded to the double burger which did not disappoint.  Thanks Thomas,  would be great to see him in management."}
{"text":"Looking for the worst burger in Toronto? Then this is the place for you.  Imagine a McDonald's hamburger run through the dishwasher and you would be spot on for the Johnny Rockets Big Double. The bun was soggy, lettuce limp, and meat like chewing bicycle tires. 

But, in all fairness, those were the good parts of the burger. The creme de la creme were the pickles. They were hands down THE worst pickles I've EVER had. I think they brined them in ammonia. The bun was soaked in ammonia juice. 

Go to the burger joints in the mall unless, like me, it's after 9:30. Then go anywhere but this Johnny Rockets."}
{"text":"About 25$ for 2 people to eat at a fast food burger place is a little much. My burger was good but the fries sucked. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great friendly staff. Old Fashioned Hamburgers which means you need to get two or more patties because with one at $-.-- all you taste is bun, lettuce and tomato. You can't even taste the meat. By the time you add the EXTRA patties you might as well go to a real burger place where the meat is central. 
This concept is not keeping up with the changing buying and taste patterns. When it was conceptualized that one patty was at a price where two or more was still affordable but now an extra patty puts it in the gourmet price range. Will they change to compete with all the great burger places? Nope. The nostalgia craze is over. Welcome to the 21st Century Johnny Rocket. You are the last to arrive. 
While I'm at it let me mention what I believe to be TRICKY pricing at 5 Guys. There one patty burger is called a small and the two patty a regular. So you go in and say,\" Hey I just want a regular burger.\" Because you are hungry you don't want a SMALL. So they have up sold you something you didn't want. You wanted a single patty that is regular in 99.99999% of every other burger place but at 5 Guys it's called a small. No guy(?) wants a SMALL. You've been tricked by semantics. I don't like that trick and I won't go there."}
{"text":"This review is for the malts only. I love malts, but most places are too conservative with the malt flavoring. Johnny Rockets and Steak-n-Shake are the only places that make good malts.

We were making our own food crawl and came across this location. Even though it wasn't part of my plan I couldn't resist the delicious malt. This location is different than other locations. They are a quick serve location, not a sit down restaurant like every other location I've visited. This location is part of a food court setting inside of The Flamingo. You order at the counter and then take it to go or sit in the area with tables shared by the other restaurants in the food court. 

The malt was a five. I loved every sip. The only suggestion I may have is to offer smaller sizes. The regular is much too large for one person. It was also $8 which is a little steep for a shake on the go. It also took quite awhile for my malt to be made. In the end I was happy because they do make a delicious malt."}
{"text":"I've been to other Johnny Rockets in the past. The food is always solid, and it was solid here as well. What really made the experience - and made me decide to take to Yelp - was the outstanding service of a young gentleman named Angel yesterday. Cheery, attentive, accommodating and absolutely on point. When he wasn't helping customers, he was hard at it behind the counter cleaning and going about his job with a smile on his face and a skip in his step. It seems so rare anymore to see this kind of enthusiasm behind a fast food counter. A pleasant surprise. I hope the folks at Johnny Rockets appreciate Angel and the hustle he brings to the job."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 1/2 a star I would. I never will get anyone who thinks $10 for a burger in this town is 'OK' or an eight dollar shake. I used a groupon and it still cost my wife and I $20+ bucks. There's  way better places in this town to have a out of this world burger, and folks this ain't one of them. 
  First if all I hate spending this kind of dough when I'm not being served. Second our food sat in a window for 5 min while some guy took over 3 orders. \"really guy\" come on. This location sucked ball ass too. Place Station sucks. Non-Union. It shows.  I have another shit-poun for this place I won't be using. Johnny Rockers. More like Johnny Crockers. I was like why do people think this is so great? I should of read the Yelp reviews before I bought 2 groupons to this shit hole. Won't happen again. After reading the reviews people had the same complaints. Way over priced. 
 People always think the more expensive it is the better it is. Not in this case. I felt the more I got ripped off."}
{"text":"Went back twice in late April 2013.  Service was friendly & efficient both times and veggie burger and fries were pretty good.  Still not my 1st choice at Silverton, but better than the first time and perfect if you're in a hurry."}
{"text":"Nastasha has great customer service skills. The food was delicious. I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"This location is very close and convenient, but we will finally not be going here again!  This is not the first time, but for some reason we always believe it will be better service.  Finally, we have learned that this place is not getting better.  A few years ago, we were forgotten and service was horrible.  We went back after watching a movie and actually had great service from a middle-aged waiter who knew how to be an exceptional server. So, we went this time and were greeted with no smiles and as if we were bothering them.  We normally don't complain, because it is our choice to go out to eat, but then again we should at least have great service, it's not that hard.  However, our waitress was horrible, no lemon when we asked, no napkins (We walked up and got ourselves), fries came after the burger, burger was cold, fries seemed old, and waitress never asked if we wanted a refill or more fries.  We were going to complain to the manager, but we just paid for our meals and left.  We were tired and ate our food, because we were hungry from a long day.  We won't return here again.  This establishment needs a lot of work with customer service and now a better cook.  And our child noticed, we never got offered \"smiley\" ketchup :)"}
{"text":"This place cannot even make a burger to order in two tries. The manager oe waitress could care less about it until I started reviewing it on yelp the they wanted to do something. How rediculous. I would never eat here again or recommend anyone to. The burger was remade and returned with the same cold fries. Sorry service!"}
{"text":"Ordered cheese fries and it took over 15 minutes. After all my friends got their orders I went to the counter to inquire and was told the cheese wasn't melting on the fries so they were waiting on that. They finally brought them out and the cheese still wasn't melted. They wanted to take them back and run them through the heat again. I just asked for a refund and they took the fries away. smh My friend called the manager over to explain everything and he was apologetic but at that point I was just frustrated. It's too late at 2am to play around with folks' food."}
{"text":"Good service, good food. Only complaint is our jukebox didn't work. The whole appeal of the place."}
{"text":"Just opened in the Meadows Mall food court 1 week ago.

What a great idea.An actual diner in the food court here.

 It has that Great 50's greasy spoon feel & taste. 100% authentic.

They also have a counter to eat at, they all wear the traditional uniform and have the jukeboxes at the counter too. 5 cents per song!!

I love their burgers/oozing grease-ask for it well done to get the crispy edges/, also the shakes & malts and  The wings are great too.

Such a great upgrade from McDonald's here in the mall."}
{"text":"50's style look & feel. SoCal burgers & shakes @johnny_rockets .
Right across from @hardrockhotellv .

Food is always good, service is great but it is a little pricy.

I had the burger 1/2 & 1/2 fried/onion rings and a chocolate malt plus wings & onion rings for my friend. $30!! 

TRY IT!!"}
{"text":"I got sick from the food, it was not worth the meal nor all the time I spent in the bathroom last night. Restaurant wasn't all that busy when we got in yet the service was still very slow just to get drinks let alone actual food."}
{"text":"We were leaving people clogged Vegas at the end of a holiday weekend and needed something filling and hopefully delicious to hold us together for the next several hours of soul killing traffic. This Johnny Rockets filled that need. 

I had two favorites: the first was when our shared order of fries came out they made a little smiley face in ketchup. Second, we ordered a chocolate banana shake (delicious) to go and they split it into two to go cups without us having to ask. Good service. Good food."}
{"text":"Total rip off. $30.59 for lunch.  All we got were two burgers, fries, and sodas. 

Cons:
 The booth was small and dirty (especially jukebox), ketchup nearly empty,  no napkins.  

They brought our fries out early to give us something to munch on, but no napkins. 

 Burger  was so greasy my plate had a puddle of grease

 Slow service,  mediocre waitress, very loud, no music or dancing

Pros: 
Fries were pretty good and its nice that they offer unlimited,  but why would u pay $12.89 for burger and fries????

Location"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING the service is always great and on point the food is always hot fresh and great tasting oldies music always playin they always make a smiley face with ketchup for u male and female before your food comes out and the staff even does a dance for entertainment always a great time"}
{"text":"I have to say, after landing from LAX the last place I wanted to stop by is a mall. Although being hungry I stumble upon a know classic burger joint Johhny Rockets. Not only did Esther take care of me and my friend. She made the experience of something that could have gone wrong into something that she made totally right. I ordered my meal and upon arrival I tried it and noticed my fries were not \"fresh\" or \"warm\". Esther not only did not charge me for the fries but took care of removing them and my beverage off the bill and just charged me my burger. She totally made it right because of my concern and that is something very admirable from a consumer point of view. Thank you again Esther and I let Diana know how I felt with your great service."}
{"text":"In my world, Johnny Rockets is the place to go for some chilli cheese fries and a cherry coke. Not at this location! No cherry syrup for the soft drinks and no chilli fries. One star goes to the great young lady who served us, otherwise I would give one star. With so many options in Vegas, why go here?"}
{"text":"Good price and good food. Entertainment was great. It is fast food in a casino, so it is not that bad"}
{"text":"I found myself here after completely failing getting drunk at the poker table at the Sante Fe because I'm an internet kid who likes to make bad poker decisions due to spite.

I walked up to Johnny Rockets after seeing that FEAST buffet was closed since it was 11pm, I thought they were going to kick me out since I hadn't shaved in over 2 weeks and was looking quite homely.  So I had a nice exchange of words with the cashier.

Cashier: How are you doing? What can I do for ya today?
Joey: The hamburger sounds good....but the tenders seem good as well...hmmm
Cashier: Well, with the tenders you get fries and a free drink for $6.99
Joey: How many tenders?
Cashier: 6
Joey: Sold
Cashier: Ok, the price is --
Joey: Don't worry, you sold me, that's why I said sold :)

I sat at a table and drank some root beer, the service was very fast and my waiter (Joe) was pretty awesome.  I was completely digging the tenders with their special wing sauce.  Overall it was a pretty good experience.

And if anyone from the wait staff that was there before I left saw what happened, give Joe my best regards, I didn't mean to bury him :(.  You know what I'm talking about :(.  I was gonna include they reason why this in the 2nd part of my review...but yeah, sorry Joe.  I'll be a returning customer for sure if I ever find myself at the Sante Fe again.  

I guess if anyone really wants to know, well my yelp nickname isn't called \"The Social Assassin\" for nothing, ha."}
{"text":"I never venture out to the strip, but I ended up on this side of town, and I needed a quick bite to eat! I've always loved Johnny Rockets, but I've never been to this location. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich with fries! I was helped by a server named Melissa who was super helpful and kind! I was surprised at how attentive their staff is for a food chain! I walked in expecting only good quick bite to eat, but walked out having a great experience as well!"}
{"text":"Greasy food, just like you'd expect a diner to be.  I ordered a grilled cheese and tomato sandwich and had to keep wiping my hands as I ate it.  For a dollar more instead of fries I got onion rings - onions with heavy batter similar to those you get frozen at the grocery store.
Cute diner atmosphere, but when the jukebox plays, watch out - it is LOUD."}
{"text":"Service is the worst.  All tables around us complaining. This is horrible.  Place is not busy at all and it's 35 minutes and still no food."}
{"text":"Great place for an old fashion burger. There was no waiting time and the service is fast."}
{"text":"The food is dull and bland. It's not worth the price especially for soggy food. I rather eat soup at a soup kitchen."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and service. We were seated right away and our order was taken quickly. The thing I don't like about Johnny rockets it that you have to order fries as a side or you only end up with a burger or chicken etc. at this location a hamburger is already over $10 and to add fries and a drink it's another $4.50.  For five us to eat was about $70 . Two of which were kids meals. Food was good and came out quick."}
{"text":"I had my first Johnny Rockets experience in Florida. That time it was amazing. But now - 4 years later and in Nevada it was ok.

Compared to Florida and to that particular time the Burger was smaller. The pattie was cooked how i placed the order. The tomato slice was ice cold and the fries good. I had to order additional fries, but this is not a problem, as Johnny Rockets offers \"unlimited\" fries .
Had a beer (Blue Moon) with a very special taste. Got to try it. A very interesting experience ...

After all the bill was $ 21.15.

After all this is ok. Not great  but also not bad."}
{"text":"Johnny Rocket's has really stepped up there game overall. Great location, environment and a really good burger. Staff is great too."}
{"text":"After the Cardinals game tonight, my girlfriend and I decided to grab a late dinner before we headed home. I ordered the patty melt on sourdough. When our food came to the table, I noticed hair sticking out of the burger. They cut the patty melt before bringing it to the table and you can see that the hair had been cut because it was sticking out on both halves. Looks like it was pressed in the meat before cooking.

Barbara our waitress says she couldn't see it because she has bad vision so she took it to the kitchen so others can look. She brought the plate back with her to the table and asked if I wanted another one. Ya right I said. It's an appetite killer. My girlfriend didn't even eat her burger. 

We didn't even get an apology. All she said was that she took it off the bill.

Very poor customer service here. If I could give it 0 stars I would. Hope their manager reads this or someone from corporate. 

I was sitting at the table adjacent to their kitchen and everyone should wear hair nets, not just a baseball cap.

The only thing I should be thankful for with this experience is that it was a long hair and not a short and curly."}
{"text":"Burgers served here have a nice char but the meat is still quite moist inside. Bun and fixings nicely complement the burger. French fries, however, tasted like they were previously frozen. Maybe I'll have the salad as my choice of sides instead of the fries next time. Service is very attentive and prompt. Also like they way the present their ketchup, which has a smilely face. Seems like management has addressed service issues which seemed to have plagued this place in the past. Will definitely return next time we go to shop at Bass Pro Outlet which is right next door."}
{"text":"Smells u good ... But rude service I ask how much longer after wait patiently 15 minutes and a rude response from them Not professional"}
{"text":"This place served a pretty mean western style burger at 1am. I remember that the food came out pretty quick and it was super hot! (temp wise). The place seemed pretty clean even though it was in one of those mall type food court deals. The guys behind the counter kept my water flowing. To be honest that's all I got on this one due to the fact that I had been drinking all day....hence needing the burger!...whoops!"}
{"text":"We were absolutely starving by the time we stopped in at Johnny Rockets. We had our minds set on burgers and had been wanting to try this chain for awhile now. They weren't busy at all but the way the girl took our order, you would've thought they had a ton of customers to attend. Borderline rude while answering our questions, we just decided to order quickly and get down to eatin'. 
Our order was ready 10 minutes later, and my hubby and I bit into our burgers...RAW burgers. :(((( 
We brought them up to the front and explained to the worker that our burgers weren't fully cooked. With a dirty look and an eye roll she tells us she'll have the cook redo the burgers. 
We wait and snack on our sweet potato fries and onion rings-which were really freakin good by the way. 
Our food is up and is much better this time.  Not the best burger I've ever had but it was good. 
The service just left a bad taste in my mouth but I wouldn't be opposed to trying a different location. Hopefully the worker with the attitude was just having a bad day.."}
{"text":"I had never eaten here before so was excited to try it out.  We got seated right away and our orders were taken quickly.  It took about 10 minutes to receive our drinks.  Our food took almost 45 min from when we ordered.  It was the busy lunch hour but still.  All the 2 of us ordered were fries and burger/hotdog so it would have been much faster to have just gone to a fast food place.  I was not impressed with the hot do as I hate seeds on my bun. I asked for another order of fries as they give you unlimited and it took almost 15 min before i got them.  By then I was so ready to leave I honestly did not want them anymore.  The food was okay tasting but for the price I expected better.  

There was only one performance while we there and I honestly would prefer them no to do them.  It just makes the place loud and takes the waiters away from serving the customers.  Out waiter made a smiley face out of ketchup into a bowl, which was cute, but I'd prefer he take the time getting my refills, order, etc.

I will not return to this environment.  I had heard from others about the slow service so I know it will happen again."}
{"text":"bought a goupon to try this place and it was realy really good!! The staff was very friendly and efficient.  I forgot abut american sizes...the portions were huge!! i recommmend sharing the fries if you are going to have something heavy like burgers.  Really had wish i had room to try a special shake.  My recommendation is to walk to the location there and back to burn some of the Calories.  I went to some of the fancier places on the strip for burgers but I actually liked the burgers at johnny rockets better!"}
{"text":"I normally don't do reviews unless I feel the need to brag and our service here at this johnny rockets was on point our server was crystal she was super nice and fast she never let my cherry soda go empty which for me is a big thing it shows how attentive the server is. Her friendly face will defiantly have me coming back again."}
{"text":"They were out of pretty much everything when we visited which means their management isn't very good. The restaurant was kind of on the small side and their prices were ridiculously high! I wasn't impressed with my food at all and my kids weren't either and if you can't make a kid happy at a place like Johnny Rockets then you know something can't be right!"}
{"text":"Juan and his team are excellent. Attentive without hovering over you. They are friendly and efficient. Could not have had a better experience. And the food was good too."}
{"text":"Had the double smokehouse burger today and it was awesome. Well seasoned with bacon and BBQ sauce and onion rings. Customer service was five stars , the manager was top notch!"}
{"text":"Worst.Burger.Ever

Grabbed a quick before heading back to the room. Would have did better going to bed hungry. Meat was under cooked, bun was stale and fries tasted like they had been cooked months ago. Food is nothing like the Johnny Rockets in CA. Burgers reminded be of the terrible Nathan's in Ballys."}
{"text":"Food was awful... for the price you might as well hit a burger king! Service sucked also!"}
{"text":"Horrible horrible service waited over 25 minutes fir a shake. Asked to have money refunded it was trekking too long was told couldn't do didn't know how. Asked for manager wouldn't give information for manager.  Young man at register have free food away, abd couldn't even refund my money. Never will go back"}
{"text":"Calvin and Daniel provided my family with excellent customer service.  It was nice to see employees take their job seriously and still be happy and smile.  Even at a busy time, they handled the stress professionally. The food was great, but it is their service that will get me as a return customer."}
{"text":"This is one of my sisters favorite restaurants so I tend to frequent it. Its a great place for some simple food. I always get the chicken strips and chili cheese fries, however I prefer shredded cheese not nacho cheese so if you are the same way make sure you request it because otherwise you are getting nacho cheese on your fries. The desserts are always great especially the shakes. The biggest complaint I have is they always seem to take an extra long time to get you all of your stuff. Drinks, food, and even the check always seem like they take much longer then they should."}
{"text":"Ok...I have been to the one in SF - many times like I was a disciple, I have even been to one on a cruise ship...this place needs love.   Let's not kid anyone, I suspect this is a franchised shop so the folks working here are probably passing the day to get gas money or out of the heat.  The cook (who you can see) either needs anger management or perhaps needs to be hidden from view.  I get the fresh burger press it flat Schtick but making it almost paper thin by using both hands to crush this poor burger was over the top.  Then throwing buns around - first on the grill then the wood prep counter was a nice touch but his Opus was slapping the cheese down like it offended him was my favorite part.  Getting the order wrong was only the appetizer for this lovely experience.  JR - if the shakes don't look like your ads - take the ads down.  Eeeesh"}
{"text":"Worst service ever. My husband and children and I waited 45 minutes and our food never came and got out hungry and angry they never got our order. They are unprofessional.  Have never gone there again. We go to the one at Scottsdale fashion square mall when go all the way there."}
{"text":"Always a classic! They have real jukeboxes here and you can always count on the atmosphere being as you expect, particularly at this location. I love how it's rarely filled to the brim and you can pretty much get a table without a wait anytime. The shakes are amazing - they're rich and creamy, as I would expect at a diner. The fries and poutine are very good, while the grilled cheese sandwich is alright. I would prefer a sharper cheese with a bit more butter on the bread but the less greasy bread means less fat, so I guess I can't complain about the tradeoff. If you come to Johnny Rockets and order a salad, don't expect anything too fancy. It will be a salad with fresh lettuce and some toppings and dressing. No fancy garnishes - this is a diner, after all.
 
Anyway, I love the atmosphere. The service I've received here has always been great! I've used groupons here and they've always been very courteous and helpful. The staff are cheerful and friendly and it's quite a hassle free experience. I would just end with a reminder that Johnny Rockets is a diner, so you will get diner food."}
{"text":"We thought this would be a good place to celebrate my brothers birthday since we have been to other locations and had good experiences. 

We were WRONG. 

Our food consisting of chicken tenders, 2 burgers and a tuna sandwich took OVER 45 minutes to get to us. Our server did not seem to care at all. There was no apology for the delay or courtesy check in at all. Another server saw that we were looking around and offered to check how long the wait would be. 

Then, when we finally get the food, it is subpar. The pattie melt barely had any onions and looked like a sloppy mess. They also used the wrong bread. Rye bread plus pattie melt = nasty as all hell.

To say that this experience was an extreme disappointment is an understatement."}
{"text":"Came in to try their philly cheese steak. Rachell was the one who took care of me and my daughter . She was very accomodating. Best food I had for years and Excellent service too!"}
{"text":"Crazy expensive and barely edible, greasy gross food. Burgers were way over cooked, dripping grease and tasteless. Fries were over cooked. Grilled cheese tasted like oil. Only thing that was decent: the shake. Better off anywhere else. Worst ~$10 burger ever."}
{"text":"Haven't been to a Johnny Rockets in years, so was pleasantly surprised to find this one. Modernized look with a couple of the old school touches: choose the music (via app), straw dispensers...

The food was good but nothing to get super excited about. This is a decent place to grab a bite and their shakes are delicious!"}
{"text":"Came to Johnny Rockets as a second choice bc BWW wasn't open at their scheduled opening time & I was tired of waiting. Got to JR and waited to be acknowledged and seated for about 7 minutes while watching staff walk around and appear to be busy. Approximately 6 tables occupied at this time 11:20am, not exactly an unmanageable amount with a staff 7-10. After placing both drink and food order together, waited about 10 minutes for drinks and 45 minutes for food. Food was barely warm. Chicken was pretty dry.
It was very apparent that today was NOT a good day to eat at West Gate. Really disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and the service was really good. I sat at their counter and I didn't even have to wait 5 minutes to get my food after I ordered it. All of the staff that came over to me was super nice and friendly and I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Wow! Where do I begin. First off it was not very busy when we arrived maybe like 3 other tables occupied. Took a few minutes before someone acknowledged us, finally does and says how many I say just us 2 he sits us at the table next to where we were a big big table, and which fine better to have room than none. Ok then it took a few minutes before our waitress came over again fine whatever. She takes our order comes back with my drink a few minutes later my sons shake. Then she comes drops off onion rings. We start to eat them and realize we don't even have napkins we sat and waited and waited and finally caught her attention, she comes back drops off napkins and we wait and wait and wait... I'm keeping an eye on an order that is sitting under the warmer thinking I bet that's ours... waitress is completely oblivious finally goes over there brings our food and is ready to walk away I said can we ketchup she's says it's right there I say it's completely empty. She goes brings ketchup and that was that never refilled my drink never checked on us until I asked for the bill 33 dollars later and we left most of the food behind."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Johnny Rockets in years, my first time at this location. I was greeted as soon as I entered the door, the cashier a young man was very polite and courteous. My food order was correct and overall decent. I can't say anything particularly stood out about the food but I would not say it's somewhere I would not go to or run to. I will say the young man walked around and asked everyone if their food ordered was fine and if they needed anything else which I thought was nice. Overall I would say it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Decent burger, but didn't really like their menu and was very limited on your choices. The lines were too long, the person taking orders was kinda not bright. And too pricey for sure.  If you are in Excalibur there are much better choices.....try the Baja!"}
{"text":"I have not eaten at Johnny Rockets in awhile. I was in the mood for a burger and I enjoyed my Smokehouse Double. I was stuffed but completely satisfied with my order."}
{"text":"Service was terrible 20 mins I waited for a water place almost empty. Ordered shakes with food done eating then got the shakes kids had nothing to drink through dinner NEVER going back suggest maybe new management food was good though shakes too drank them on the way out the door"}
{"text":"It's very good...but OUTRAGEOUSLY overpriced.  There's not a whole lot of 24 hour food here and they know it.

My Bacon Double Burger w/Onion Rings and Pepsi came out to $19.89!  If your independently wealthy, go for it."}
{"text":"Man the line was long here to go long time cigar order I think they need to fortify their customer service line and the food is great but it definitely takes a long time to come back here maybe when it's not so busy maybe in a week day"}
{"text":"To begin with this does NOT even deserve a star . I am by far disappointed and disgusted by this restaurant! I was there last night with a party of 12 people and yes we were seated almost immediately but it took about 20 min for a server to ask us for drinks keep in mind we have 4 kids that are very impatient!!! Anyways, the drinks were awful !!!!! Coke ? More like water !! Almost 1-2 Hours later and still NO FOOD ! My father and aunt are both diabetic and haven't had any food . We did decide to leave various times and when we stepped out they will tell us that our order was almost out . Pathetic ! Since it still took more time to have our NASTY ASS food . I hope you improve on your waiting time and better customer service. As for my family and I we wont be attending this location anymore ."}
{"text":"I was so excited to hear Johnny Rocket's was coming to Toronto - given how much I love it in the US. Whenever I visit the southern States, I probably look forward to going here the most. It just doesn't carry over as well in Toronto, and that was a bit of a let down. 

The Toronto location didn't have the same friendly Johnny Rockets servers I am used to. They didn't sing or dance while I was there, but to be honest, I am kind of glad. Judging by how busy everyone looked, I think it would be a little bit forced and awkward. The place was understaffed. I only saw 1 guy taking orders and the perimeter of the restaurant was full. 

I can't complain about the food at all though. I loved my burger and poutine, and the cherry coke zero was amazing. 

I know I'll be back, but this location just doesn't provide the same Johnny Rocket's \"experience\" that I get in the South. Plus, every JR's needs a patio - come on! 

They have a deal right now with the AMC Theatre - I think it is $20 for a burger, fries, and a movie pass that doesn't expire. Pretty good if you ask me."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this restaurant!!! The food is fantastic and the milkshakes are muy delicioso!!!!!! The staff is sooo nice and they have amazing smiles!!!! The burger is juicy and the chicken is nice and fresh! If you come to the Silverton, this is the restaurant for you!"}
{"text":"After my sheer reluctance at gambling, my father finally convinced me to slip in a couple of dollars at one of the video poker machines at Caesar's Palace only to have it spit back a luscious $20 bill after what I'll always refer to as a 'once in a blue moon' lucky round. (I mean, what are the odds of that ever happening again?) My immediate impulse, being the typical me - 'let's grab a bite!' 

It was early afternoon. Our tummies were calling and I remembered a neat-looking food court right across at the Flamingo. We hopped over to try Johnny Rockets out. A friend of mine has been egging me to try it out so we gave a shot at the Rocket Wings with fries. 

For $10.95 (+ tax), you get 10 pieces of scrumptious wings with your choice of dipping (ranch, blue cheese etc.) If possible, lay off the blue cheese dip because all they're really going to hand you is blue cheese salad dressing which is comparatively milder than its counterpart dips - watery too. For dessert, we opted for the original vanilla shake. Here's where the prices started to get a tad bit ridiculous. $6.95 (+ tax) for a milkshake the size of that at an In-N-Out Burger and you could get the same thing there for $1.89 (+ tax) 

Just when I was just about ready to question why their prices were so high, Aretha Franklin's 'Respect' on pipe-in went on full blast and we saw the staff shuffle out of their counters and do a little dance at the middle of the food court, in front of the crowd. People joined in, others clapped along. It was a cute little show and in the end, keep in mind that what you're really paying for is the novelty. 

Take yourself back in the 50s at Johnny Rockets - but only if you've got money to burn."}
{"text":"Worst Johnny Rockets ever. The staff was rude and looked dirty. I asked for a bacon egg and cheese muffin. I got a cheese sandwich. I asked for the bacon, they looked at me like it was my fault. They came back with one small piece of bacon and didnt even apologize. Worst customer service ever. Dont waste your time or money."}
{"text":"I work at Spirit Halloween next to this location and everyone loves to eat there for multiple reasons. One of them would be how NICE everyone is at this store. They go above and beyond to help us out, they've even offered to drop off the food to us at our store. Another would be that they sent us the cutest, nicest package. I've been going to this location for as long as I can remember and they have never done me wrong. Customer service has always been amazing and to see the general manager Travis, being so attentive to his staff and actually caring about his establishment is something that's hard to find in most chain restaurants. I'm so glad to have an amazing go to restaurant so close to me"}
{"text":"Great burgers, fast service, and very courteous staff.  Love, love, love the soda machine!!"}
{"text":"Do not come here! Horrible service. Took 5 minutes to get our drinks placed, the waitress didn't tell us fries cost extra, she never came back for refills, and never checked on us. I do not recommend. We got up and refilled our own drinks."}
{"text":"At Johnny Rockets my taste buds do not take off. The selection and taste of their food is average.

 Johnny Rockets is a sit-down 60's diner-themed restaurant that is located deep in the Fashion Show Mall near Dillard's. The wait staff dress as 1960's diner servers. They stick to the role so well that on top of the hour they will stand in front of the patrons while dancing to an oldies tune. Keeping with the 1960's diner theme, every table features a juke box. It was so enjoyable listening to the oldies (I think I was born in the wrong era.)

  In my opinion the oldies playing on the juke box is beats the food. I rate the oldies songs from 4 to 5 stars, where I rate Johnny Rockets 3 stars.

  Johnny Rocket's menu focuses on burgers. The starting price of a burger that includes fries is $9.95. Individual toppings cost $1 extra. The toppings include chili, fried egg, grilled bell peppers, grilled onions, and jalapeno slices. If you want bacon or onion rings as a topping it is $2 extra. Each cheese topping is $2 extra. They are American, cheddar, and pepper jack. Johnny Rockets also offer protein options for $2 extra. They include a turky patty, soy boca burgers, and chicken breasts. In addition to burgers, the menu also features Rocket melts, Philly cheese steaks, hot dogs, onion rings, fries, BLTs, and shakes.

  What brought me to walk from Bellagio to Fashion Show Mall was Johnny Rockets delicious egg salad sandwich. However, in similar fashion to my Interstate 515 business listing, it is gone. Boo! Tired of burgers, I ordered the Philly cheese steak sandwich with fries. I felt that the Philly cheese steak fell short of meat. The fries were average. It was a three stars okay.

  At Johnny Rockets my taste buds do not take off and remain down to earth. Then again I am a down to earth Yelper that is giving Johnny Rockets a 3 star rating.

{"text":"This Johnny Rockets is all about location! location! location! and not about price! price! price! It is a concession in the Grand Canal Shops up on the second level of the Venetian. 

 Last week during a staycation on the Las Vegas Strip, we were up for a light meal. We were hanging out in the Venetian when we decided on Johnny Rockets. It won over its food court  neighbors including Chicken Connection, Panda Express, and Subway. 

 On account of the fact that this is a food court concession and not a restaurant, we ordered food at a counter that we would carry to a table. We could of sat at one of the few stool seats at the counter. At 8 o' clock on a Sunday evening, Johnny Rockets was moderately busy. Looking at the high prices on the overhead menu, it is easy to understand why. The Rocket burger with fries was $10.90. Of course, I wanted a beverage with the food. The large Pepsi that I ordered for the beverage was an additional $3.98. After paying for the food, the woman at the register presented us with a buzzer that would alert us when the food was ready. 

  The Rocket failed to blast off my taste buds. It was an ordinary burger with cheddar cheese, onions, tomatoes, and a so called special sauce. I would not go out of my way for this burger. Ditto for the fries. However, I would of gone out of my way for the Johnny Rockets egg salad sandwich if they never discontinued it. 

  Missing from this food court Johnny Rockets is the \"Happy Days\" TV show atmosphere that is prevalent in many of their restaurants. Regardless that there was a juke box at the counter the noise and activity inside the food court drowned out the soundtrack of the 50's and 60's. 

  From my experience this Johnny Rockets blasts off prices instead of taste buds into outer space. I would rather spend a few more dollars for a far better meal nearby at Ghiordano, Grimaldi's, Grand Lux Cafe, or In N Out. Then again this is all talk when hunger strikes inside a food court deep inside the Venetian."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Great Music. Place I go to at Arrowhead
Mall. Crispy fries; bottomless for $2."}
{"text":"I have to start this review by saying that i LOVE cheeseburgers- They are my most favorite thing. This being the case, i have tried many a burger place in my day. 

Johnny Rockets is usally pretty good. They are known for having thin, smashed, juicy meat and tasty fries. This is not the case at this particular location in the Scottsdale Fashion Square. This location is always rushed and does not have the same taste as many other locations i have been. 

My most recent vistit was to have a Classic Cheeseburger with well done bacon, side of fries and root beer. Burger was GREASY!, bacon was barely cooked and was mostly fat and fries came out WAY before the food. 

I was not as happy as i usually am after eating a burger- this place needs work- they are not living up to the name!"}
{"text":"I had the Smoke House, which is smoked bacon, onion rings, cheddar cheese, and BBQ-ranch sauce. Patties are 1/3 pound. I probably didn't need to have the double for lunch, but oh well. $10.95 for the single is a rip off, so I went with the double for $12.95, which was still pricey, but less of a rip off. Both come with fries. Even soda was pricey. $2.95 for a regular soda is ridiculous.

Using a Groupon only makes eating here fair in price. Don't expect it to be a deal. In fairness, the food was good. It's on par with a burger you would get at a diner, even though this is a chain."}
{"text":"So far the best place for the perfect burger not even greasy like other places. The employees there are awesome and very attentive with the customers and myself. Come by and visit them and you'll see what I'm talking about! Awesome people work here! Thanks guys! Isabel, Raquel, Angel, and Lulú"}
{"text":"A bit pricier and with a less diverse menu than a regular Johnny Rockets, it's still a good deal in the food court!

Ordered the Rocket Burger and a Strawberry shake.   Came out to $17.19.  Burger was good and the shake was just the right consistency to drink thru a straw.

Not as good as the regular Johnny Rockets but better than the other burger places in the food court both in quality and price."}
{"text":"Currently sitting in the Mandalay Bay Johnny Rockets.  This place is horrible.   3 out of 4 burgers ordered were pink and inconsistently cooked.  The staffed claimed that this is their normal cook even as the lady standing next to me is showing them her rock hard burger.   We also had a problem with our drinks.  Ordered 3 Pepsi's.  They have us Root Beers.  After trying to get this fixed we still got Root Beer! Asked to speak with the Manager, but they never showed."}
{"text":"Ppl here are very nice and friendly!!!!! They made a smiley face ketchup for me, good time when I was kinda feeling dwn!!!!"}
{"text":"Disgusting to say the least so gross!!!! Soggy ass burgers and fries makes me nauseous even thinking about it! Who the owner of this place plz! Start with the shitty ass workers you have working there then the food over priced and disgusting as shit!"}
{"text":"I started my day bad, so I decided to go to the movies to relax... n who doesn't love some food with it? 
Well I ordered my food with a nice young man Angel? I believe it was him. (Always like getting their names as i work for customer service) 
He was very patient with my undecided self lol 
The cooker ,LULU recommended me a burger n man let me tell u! It was soooo gooddd!!! 
Not your basic hamburger! she was so nice!! 
Really cheered me up from my cloudy day... she is just so cheerful, I didn't know somebody who could smile while talking n cooking.  

Overall experience if I could give a 10 stars I would   
Best food n best customer service!! 
(Lulu should be employee of the month!) 
U gotta meet her!! Shes like \"Aunt May\""}
{"text":"They serve breakfast!  Would have never known this.  Found out by accident!   Eggs. . Omelets,  pancakes,  waffles.   Generous with their portions and great when you dint want to go to the buffet for breakfast.   They also do to go so great alternative to room service.   We were very pleased with this option."}
{"text":"I love Johnny Rockets!!! I love the oldies music, the atmosphere, the food!!! It's great!!! The problem is, just like every franchise it's the managers, or owners that are the ones responsible to make you want to come back or not. I have been to a few different Johnny Rockets in AZ and each one is different of course on service and taste of food. I go to the Johnny Rockets out at San Tan Mall at least 3 times a month. I would go more if the service and food quality stayed consistent. It's frustrating to go and LOVE the experience and food and the next time you go back it's the complete opposite. I just visited this Jonny Rockets on Saturday 11/24 in the evening. We sat outside for the weather was fantastic. It took them 15 minutes to even acknowledge we were outside, we waited 10 minutes to place our drink order, another 20 to order our food, then another 35 minutes to get our food, at least 15 more to get our check, we weren't asked if we wanted dessert on top of that taking another 20 minutes. Needless to say, we missed our movie that was playing right across the way, it took us over 2 hours to eat, our waiter was cranky and didn't care to take care of us. Now onto the food..... it's a hit and miss every time I go! This particular time, it was ridiculous. The burgers were tasteless, the fries were cold..... I didn't understand why it was such a bad night for this place. I want to know why their food portion and the taste changes from every visit. Do the managers change; do the cooks change.... what is going on? One time we order the American Meal Deal. You get a huge burger, a huge side of fries and a drink. This time we got a small burger, a half a scoop of fries on the same plate and a drink. Their chili cheese fries are my favorite but I always have to be super clear when I order because sometimes I get a whole plate full and sometimes I get a half a plate and told its the appetizer size. Also they change from giving you graded cheese and nacho cheese on the chili cheeses fries, and when you ask the waiter they have no idea why your asking...... well I wouldn't ask if the order was always the same. I also feel like they shouldn't advertise fresh brownies on their brownie sundays if your going to serve hard stale brownies. I would love to keep visiting this Johnny Rockets, but im afraid I have to finally throw in the towel and look else ware to eat in San Tan Mall. I feel I have given them enough chances and it's frustrating to be such a flip floppy restaurant."}
{"text":"Yes please! I really like this Johnny Rockets! Every time I come here I leave with the biggest food baby! Even though this is a chain restaurant I can't get over their delicious chili cheese fries! I am a sucker for good old fashion chili cheese fries! It's nice to come to a laid back atmosphere, on any regular day and enjoy great oldies music, friendly staff, big old school burgers, chili cheese fries and an Oreo shake to wash it down with! It also helps that it's in the mall and I love to people watch! A great ending to a long day at work! Hopefully everyone enjoys an easy, quick, yummy spot like me! Remember it doesn't always have to be fancy to be great."}
{"text":"Everything was sooo delcious. Our waitor was super nicer too!!"}
{"text":"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. The service was horrific. I also found a DEAD FLY in my milkshake. The manger was useless and not whatsoever helpful. Also,the services was so bad. It took foreverr to bring out meals. I am truly disgusted, this was my worst restaurant experience ever..."}
{"text":"Oh Johnny Rockets How I LOVE you!

The atmosphere is Amazing, The feel of the place is awesome! It's like your old fashioned Diner from the 60's/70's!

Our waiter was very nice! Took our order fast and efficient! This diner is fast paced to begin with but i am still impressed by the speed. I ordered a burger and fries and my gosh was it ever good.  Waiter was very polite and friendly

Keep in mind this location is inside of Arizona Mills, as it gets alot of traffic from people shopping. So don't be surprised if there is a wait. 

The size this location is a bit small, but again its inside the mall, so i guess i shouldn't have been that surprised 

Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Ok, I normally don't eat Burgers, I stick to a pretty strict diet. However, this Johnny Rockets is amazing. THOMAS! (yes I put that in caps for a reason) is the nicest most energetic human in Vegas, he always has a smile and goes above and beyond, his work ethic is phenomenal."}
{"text":"I've no idea why this has so few stars. We got the bacon sandwich- huge and so good, the reg burger also really good, the barbecue ranch burger- holy crap- amazing! Fries n onion rings were delish! Shakes were better than most places. The bacon was crunchy and very meaty on the burgers. We LOVED it!"}
{"text":"Three Words:  No Air Conditioning

I was in town a week ago for an event and some friends of mine decided to go Johnny Rockets for some dinner grub.  When we entered the restaurant, we were greeted by a blast of hot air.  On asking the server about it, he told us that the air conditioning had been out for a full year.

Even with 2 or 3 additional customers at the restaurant, the service was slow.  The food was decent for the price although I feel sorry for the cooks who have to work there without cooling!"}
{"text":"Burgers are delicious. And the onion rings very on point. My friend and I got served at the counter by paul (asian guy). He provided very very great servicr."}
{"text":"Our group got hungry so with the lack of planning, we decided to just go across the street to Johnny Rockets.

FOOD - 1 Star: I ordered:

- Chili Cheese Fries: These were ok. They were really heavy on the chili and the cheese was barely there. It would've been way better to actually have the cheese on the top instead of under the chili.

- Sweet Potato Bacon Cheese Fries: I enjoyed the sweet potato fries myself, but the cheese... if you can call it that... was pretty disgusting. I don't know why they couldn't use real cheese. Instead they used some liquid cheese that you'd find at the movie theater and so it had this weird taste to it. The only thing that kind of saved it was the bacon, but even that was overpowered by the liquid cheese. This ruined my appetite and I had to eat around the cheese, which was almost impossible since it was all over the place.

- Smoke House Single Burger: This was pretty good, but smaller than I thought it would be. Maybe I don't come here often enough, but the burger was small. The taste was spot on. You can't go wrong with a meat patty, cheese, onion rings, and bacon.

SERVICE - 2 Stars: The staff was friendly, but literally only approached us to drop off the menus and to deliver food. No one checked on us at all during the meal. I need an extra fork and literally had to flag someone down to get it.

ATMOSPHERE - 2 Stars: It's your typical Johnny Rocket's setup and my biggest issue with the place was the fact there was no soap in the restroom. I'm glad we had hand sanitizer with us, but that's just gross.

RECOMMENDATION: Overall, I'd say you can skip this place. Go to Capriotti's or Joe's Pizza in the same shopping center instead. You'll get way better food for the money you're paying."}
{"text":"Johnny Rockets at the Chandler Fashion Center..... DIRTY, the eating area and bathrooms dirty. Two employees behind the counter and manager sitting at his desk with his back toward his customers, it was not busy we arrived at 5 pm on a Sunday.  There was one table with three people having drinks. We ordered our food at the counter- different. I used the facilities before our dinner came. No paper towels in paper towel holder the floor was dirty bits of paper scattered throughout the bathroom floor, looks like the bathroom area  had not been cleaned in quite a while.  The lobby was just a dirty as the bathroom. One emplyee did come out to empty out the trash can in the lobby however was called back to the counter for what ever reason the trash can sat in the lobby filled with trash for 10 minutes, one emplyee did walk thru the lobby noticed the trash and walked right by it not once but twice! Finally the original person who started taking out the trash came back to finish the job. Not once did the manager walk thru the lobby  to see if it was tidy. Two thumbs down will not be retuning back to this Johnny Rockets. Aside from being dirty the burgers where good the onion rings not good a disappointment. Also did not like how they brought out our french fries and onion rings first then later brought out our burgers."}
{"text":"Terrible service and mediocre food. We paid 40 dollars for 3 people at a fast food restaurant, that in and of it's self should indicate that the food is half way decent. Ice been to several Johnny rockets before and never had this expierience. The food was under cooked, I had to re-ask for all my drinks and fries and our fries were cold and stale. Never ever coming back to this location again and I don't recommend anyone else does either."}
{"text":"..I'm positive the nice waitress meant well. Me and my husband went in on Friday the 20th last month, and it was still daylight out. .. Our server was so busy, but still took the time to smile, and repeat back our order, and kept our drinks full. The only problem we encountered was watching our waitress be with many tables on the other side of the building. We chalked it down to the rise of minimum wages. But she was THE ONLY WAITER THERE!! The place was very busy, and we did notice active managers, but we were truly amazed how much they had this woman running around the entire place, making many milkshakes, seating, serving, cleaning up after her customers left, greeting newcomers.. etc etc. My husband and I have long been coming to eat at Arrowhead, but it was disappointing seeing their lack of staff. Everything we ate was good, as usual, but I really felt bad for the short staff. I truly hope they decide to loosen up the employee budget, and focus on what really matters the most. Us, the loyal customers! They should have enough staff to keep the place an enjoyable experience! And thus i had to give them a low rating this time."}
{"text":"How could you mess up grilled cheese?  They managed to.  Cute place and friendly staff, but I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Hands down for Esther. When In Sunday it was super busy and she still managed to give excellent service."}
{"text":"Sit down style but still Fast-ish food that tastes decent and doesn't cost a fortune... How could you go wrong with that? 

Stopped here on a busy Vegas afternoon but service was mostly prompt, the burger as ordered (mayo as a default option... no thanks), even the french businessmen seated next to me gave theirs a thumbs up. 

The food court setting is definitely a strange choice and there are better burgers in Vegas but it's that balance between finding something really great and finding something now."}
{"text":"This review is based on the service (or lack of) that we had. We did not end up eating anything.
We walked up to be seated and stood there waiting a few moments. The restaurant was probably only 20% full. Someone seated at the counter (who i think was a manager, eating lunch?) acknowledged us and said someone would be with us soon. A few more minutes later he got up and seated us. He brought us menus. After that we waited a literal 15 minutes  without being seen. No one brought glasses of water let alone taking our orders. We were seeing a movie after so we got up and left"}
{"text":"I love this place. I work in the mall and consider this my go to! Only problem is the younger staff. Stephanie was so rude I almost canceled my order. She made me feel like ordering my food was a bother. However; I have had excellent service from the older staff members which I will make sure I ask for moving forward."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my girls. 

The service was great & the food was to be expected. 

The strawberry milkshake was superb."}
{"text":"I would categorize this as just ok. The shakes were good. There was an outlet behind the booth where we sat which allowed us to plug in and charge, which was good. 
The service was good. The food was good. However, nothing was over the top to encourage us to return again."}
{"text":"Don't really know where to begin. I guess I'll start by saying the service is ridiculously slow! It took forever for me to get a burger and drink. Even standing in the line waiting it took forever for me to get my food ordered. When it was finally my turn the cashier just walks away leaving me waiting there. Then after a few minutes she decides to grace me with her presence and just take my order! How sweet of her right? Anyways I order and I wait another 10 minutes for my food. Well it must have sat there because the burger was cold and it tasted like crap to boot. Then about an hour later I felt a nasty rumbling in my stomach and had to book it to the bathroom. That was the first thing I had eaten that day so there was nothing else that could have caused that. For the burger and drink it set me back $13.00. I am sure that for some it is a good place to get a quick cheaper bite to eat in Vegas but for me it's not."}
{"text":"You can elect to sit at the counter and order from the menu and have a server, or you can order at the cash register and sit in the food court. 

I love this place, and how it is decorated. Dining here offers that slice of America that my parents who immigrated here in the 80s were never able to experience. I also love it for not trying to be anything other than what it is: a burger joint soaked in fat

I had the chili cheese fries and an egg sandwich. The chili cheese fries were delicious. The egg salad sandwich not so much, as the bread was dry and the egg salad monotonous. Some celery mixed up in the egg salad would have been nice."}
{"text":"Was horrible ordered our burger well done received a complete charred burger lots of confusion with the employees"}
{"text":"First time visiting prior to a Coyotes hockey game tonight. Busy but seated right away. Great service. Food was hot and fresh. Server Beairah was very nice and attentive. Will definitely come back prior to a hockey or football game."}
{"text":"Overrated hamburgers, thick chewy fries, long wait, unhappy workers. You might as well go to Chipotle which is next door."}
{"text":"I came in here with my wife to eat today and ended up walking out because of bad service. We got seated and were given menus. We were told our server would be with us shortly. A few minutes later a group of four walked in and sat at the table next to us. The server talked to the group of 4 and came back with their drinks and then started taking their order and then walked off to get their order started. I just kept sitting there wondering if my wife and I were invisible. This place needs to get their customer service in better shape. I don't really mind that the group of four were helped first but the server should have at least gotten our drink order after she got the other tables drink order."}
{"text":"Vegas is probably the only place in the world where I can burn through $300 in an hour without really even noticing. The drinks, the slots, the spa treatments... And the food. Oh my god, the food is amazing but SO expensive.

Thankfully, there's a mall-style food court in the Flamingo to save you from dropping another $50 on a buffet. The employees at Johnny Rocket's were very friendly and the food came out quickly. It was the first meal I'd eaten in 3 days that didn't include prime rib and it was almost a relief. 

Chicken strips, cheese fries and a Diet Coke (I'm  watching my figure) all for about $15. Yeah, it's pricey for \"fast food\" but it's a far cry from the prices elsewhere on the Strip. I was perfectly happy with my experience and would gladly return."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience with Johnny Rocket. The place always has great food, the staff are friendly and quick to please, the singing waiters are somewhat amusing but mostly I just like the decor and music. The food is good and the prices are fair when you consider the decor is so awesome."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Do not go to this location with any expectations -5* I give no stars stupid yelp is forcing me"}
{"text":"My son loved Jonny Rockets hamburger, fries and milk shake. He ate everything which means tasty hamburger."}
{"text":"I would have given 2 stars, but I feel betrayed by the horrible way one of my fav cuisines was handled. A philly cheesesteak is a form of chi, that no one should fuck with. Get it right or back off.
Also, when you advertise a lemon coke as a dinner, make sure it's not coke with a lemon slice in it. That is false advertising."}
{"text":"Service is slow and not very friendly. Food was cook to order so that was good. Restaurant is in a food court at the Mandalay Bay and they acted as if I was bothering them by eating at their establishment."}
{"text":"Good burgers. Fair prices also. I got the craft your own and my friend got a route 66 thought there was a mis communication with the chef which delayed us for 20 min. Id come back here in the future."}
{"text":"Delicious sweet potato fries n steak sub was amazing then the staff did the Johnny Rockets dance."}
{"text":"The burgers were perfect. We actually went twice in one day. It's good to have a choice of cheese and sides (fries, onion rings, tots, or salad)"}
{"text":"Was here on January 27. The service is incredibly slow, I agree with previous reviews. But, the hospitality & food was so good! Wish I knew the managers name that day, he was so apologetic & humble. They're understaffed, but I imagine it's not managements fault, that has to come from a higher source! Coming from someone that's worked in the industry! Give them a bigger staff & they'll be great!!"}
{"text":"Walked in, sat down at the counter.

20 minutes later, when no one had acknowledged us, and the greasy smoke had long-since overpowered us, walked out."}
{"text":"Great servers here, prompt and eager to please. Great hotdogs with amazing bun, awesome chocolate malts..."}
{"text":"Ok so Johnny Rockets is another one of those LA transplants that I long for. It's one of those things that just make me feel at home. Where I'm all warm and fuzzy. This restaurant brings back Americana at it's finest hayday. The 50's. You know like Pleasantville. The last time I've felt this great was when I slipped in the bathroom and hit the toilet with my head and I drew.....the FLUX Capacitor. That's how I discovered this place and myself when I travelled to good Ol' 1955. Yep......Oh wait that's not me. 
But it feels like 1955 when I have that juicy tasty burger from here. My regulars are the #12 with that sweet red tangy goodness of sauce and Tillamook cheddar cheese slices. Mmmmm When I'm really hungry I go for the oh so yummy Double Rocket. Oh yea --- sounds like porn....But Tastier! The fries and onion rings here are pretty good too! But Chili Cheese fries....mmmmm. Johnny Rockets also serves shakes. But what this place really introduced me to is the Chocolate coke. Yep....Chocolatey Hershey's syrup and coke. Sure they have vanilla coke, cherry coke, and lemon coke....But you haven't lived till you try chocolate coke ;) Overall this would be in the top rated burger category in Vegas."}
{"text":"***PROS***
* Located inside Fashion Show Mall
* Quick seating
* Delicious shakes, burgers and fries. Like REALLY!!! The FLAVOR of the burger is so amazing, it puts other burger restaurants to shame!
***CONS***
* A little slow to get our check so we could leave. Had to take my credit card out and wave it around to get our server's attention."}
{"text":"Came around 3pm yesterday. Greet time was slow as well as service: staff definitely could improve on their people skills and smiling because then, wait time wouldn't seem like such a drag. In all honesty, when you go out to eat you don't simply pay for food but you also pay for the experience. Not that Johnny Rockets is a high-end place or anything but that could just be my personal expectations because of my serving background. 


Overall it wasn't such a bad experience. The food came out hot and I do prefer to come to this location over the Mandalay Bay location because the food options at Fashion Show are more extensive."}
{"text":"We came here for three burgers with a total cost of  $32.99. We ordered a shareable chili cheese fries (good). But why are the burger patties so small?  The bun is big but the patty is the size of a McDonald's cheese burger. For a $9.00 I would expect more. 

The wife and I left hungry. We may come back at a later date to see if things change (since they just opened), but I am not keen on a return visit. The burger can be \"filled out\" with freebies like lettuce, tomatoes, etc, but the patty is no where near the size that is depicted on all the pictures adorning the walls.

In summary, I just expected so much more."}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow because of a rush of customers. However, the server made up for it with his great attitude! 

The food was excellent!!! The fries and onion rings were HOT! I wasn't expecting such a great meal considering the circumstances.

I was meeting up with an old friend and we caught up and had a GREAT lunch! Just a wonderful experience. 

BTW. The server could have and most would have, had a stressed and negative attitude, but he stuck with it and grinded it out with a smile! Nice job server and thanks for the YUMMY lunch Johnny Rockets Arrowhead!"}
{"text":"Well this is awkward. We went in to enjoy some juicy burgers and I saw this... Hair! Being the hungry bear that I am I just hoped it was served as a side dish and tried to get rid of it. Nope. It was shoved deep into that burger that I just gave up and told the staff. The guy was kind enough to replace it (it was replaced real quick so I'm not sure if it's actually a new burger or the original minus the extra hair). Anyways, just hope it does not happen to anyone else and that they would do a better job keeping their crown and glory intact."}
{"text":"+they have a really clean, well really shiney rang
+they have a great CS, friendly, as it is a fast pace kinda place and so, they may get a sec to stand their, really, as if they are floating, just so right their, right over their and then well, they are always moving, Mike must of train to fight and to cook a mean meal; as they can sting and they fly
+ great food and yes, loving it.

-bathrooms, I don't like the biuld up, it maybe a better, as this always makes the score go to one

So over all, the bathroom is the biggest part, I love sitting on a clean toilet and that, the way I looks nope; get a steam cleaner, that might be the best bet to get wear needs to be cleaned without taking the toilet apart."}
{"text":"Worse place ever!  I'm sure I got food poisoning after eating the route 66 burger and the sweet potato fries.   I felt like it was to greasy from the beginning but I was very hungry so I didn't care at the time.  I have been ill since the day after I ate there.  I didn't even finish my food because I couldn't hold down the taste of the grease.  I would never recommend this place to anyone for food but their milkshakes are very thick and tasty."}
{"text":"Thomas the waiter will definitely make your day so much better! If every cashier/associate/ manager had the customer service this guy did. There would be no such thing as a bad review."}
{"text":"Gross philly cheese steak, waiter never asked if it was ok or if i needed anything. Will not return."}
{"text":"We were back again.  Located in the Venetian food courts.  Not cheap food but good and a fast bite.   My wife and I ate here twice during our stay.  2 burgers plus a milk shake, $32.  Milk shakes were delicious but it was also 115 degrees outside.  We'll be back"}
{"text":"IF you can get your order correct. The food isn't bad.  Service sucks. 2 days in a row they took forever to make a simple cheeseburger and a milkshake. The manager on duty gave me a free hamburger and milkshake to use for next day. So I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt. Came back on Sunday 4/17 @130pm. Use the coupon and also purchased another burger and fries. I was told it would take  10 to 15 minutes. However it took a half an hour. And yet the order was not correct or HOT. Vanilla milkshake magically turned into a strawberry one. The hamburger and cheeseburger were ICE COLD. Never got the fries. Needless to say I was a little hot under the collar. I had to walk back from my hotel across the street into the mall to talk to the manager. I got a refund. And now waiting to see IF THIS ORDER IS CORRECT AND HOT.  Once again food wasn't coerct. Plain single hamburger with ketchup turned out to be a cheeseburger  with onions, tomatoes, mayonnaise on it.  So the bun fell apart. And the food is lukewarm again. I will never come to this locate.  Either you guys need to hire more help or train them better. And yes I called the general manager and left him a nice message. So my opinion is there are other nice places to eat around here."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with Audrey on Sunday.  Its located within the Santan villiage, tucked behind the food court and next to the movie theatre, its easy enough to find.  Service was quick and efficient, and food was tasty.  Service was adequate, and I will return in the future!! Love the theme of this place.  :-)"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Saturday morning, and I the waitress told my friends and I to sit anywhere we would like.  She was friendly, but she NEVER came to our table to take our order.  After half an hour, I decided to walk to the front register and ask for food myself, and she took my order.  I waited another HOUR, and this is fast food? This is a Saturday and there were only two people working.  Lots of other people were becoming angry and frustrated too, but I had already paid so I had not choice but to wait.  Finally, my food came out from the kitchen. Although delicious, it wasn't worth the one and a half hour wait and the management needs to fix this.  But, I could tell that the waitress and lone cook were trying there best, but it isn't adequate for a restaurant located in a casino."}
{"text":"This Johnny Rockets its located in the MGM food court. Its more of a fast food place, as opposed to other Johnny Rockets where you are served at your table. Here is more like a McDonald's, you place you order at the cashier, retrieve your food and seat at the food court tables along with people eating from all the other fast foods joints.

They are a little too busy during breakfast, so you might have to wait a little for your food, but nothing beyond reason. As a matter of fact, you can order from their breakfast menu throughout the day. And since you are in Vegas, they serve alcoholic shakes.

People working here are friendly enough, and the prices are fair. To be honest, if you are on a budget, you can avoid the expensive hotel restaurants and eat at the food court every now and then."}
{"text":"I will always love the food at Johnny Rockets. But this time when we came to this Johnny Rockets they just underwent a remodel. They have a really new updated look. It's nice and all but they removed the mini juke boxes at each table so it doesn't have that old school feel to it anymore. If they would have at least left one big juke box that would have been great.
Iguess I'm just a bit sentimental, which is what Johnny Rockets was all about."}
{"text":"Well this location is the Flamingos hotel. It was fairly busy and organized.. everything is made fresh.  Burgers are pretty juicy... And for me it was for filling so that's a great thing.

We are still got the Hershey chocolate shakes which was really yummy! at first I didn't think it was too good but then I realized I was using the regular soda straw to drink from it not recommended...

When I realize what I should have been using which is a big round red straw oh my god that shake was delicious and you could taste the Hershey chunks that come up from the bottom which was just as Ono!

Reason for the three stars was that it was really expensive ...our bill was 87 dollars for four burgers 2 malt shakes and 2 sodas. They do have TVs there where you can watch whatever sports is on so that was cool..

As for the seats they're really close together so the person that was sitting behind me kept bumping his chair into my chair which was a little annoying....

It was cool.... I don't know if I will visit there any time soon again but it was a good experience I just think that it was so expensive due to the fact that the location is in a hotel... I have tried other burgers that are better then this, but all in all it was still a good burger nothing bad to say on that part."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst experiences ever. Barely anyone in Johnny Rocket's (really dead actually) with maybe 5-6 tables tops occupied. And at least 2-4 of those tables only had 2-3 people sitting in them. Took forever for anyone to take our drink order or even notice that we exist. Once we finally ordered two shakes, we didn't even get them until our food came out (which took awhile I might add). The chocolate shakes were exactly like someone else said, \"like light chocolate milk.\" My grilled chicken sandwich's chicken breast was small and barely even covered the bun it was in. The fries sucked and were also lukewarm instead of hot. Then it took forever for someone (out of the literally 5-6 people working) to notice we were done and ready for our check. The worst part? The lady and her son at the table behind us ordered around the same time as we did. By the time we were finishing our food, she was asking where her WATER was. Poor service and absolutely no excuses for it. I think I'm finally done dragging my mom to Johnny Rocket's."}
{"text":"I'm so WOWed!!! I'm not one to frequent a diner type of joint but we didn't really like anything else the meadows mall food court had to offer so we decided on something new to us. What a great decision! 
We sat at the counter and our AMAZING waitress came over and took our orders. She warned us that it was going to take about 25 minutes for our orders to be ready but we knew how busy it was (the day after Christmas) and we were just fine with that. 
     For a Food Court restaurant they definitely tried to keep that counter dining experience...I liked a lot! But I just felt like I was too far away from hubs and daughter we could barely hear each other. Expect 50s/60s decor and nickel jukebox menus at the counter...not sure if they worked cause I don't normally carry cash or change on me but it would be so awesome if it does! 
      We waited and observed the staff...it looked like they were short staffed by at least 2 people. I saw the bit of frustration and fluster from the ladies but when it came to serving the patrons they ALWAYS kept a cool calm demeanor!!! Our server always checked in on us to make sure we were ok and always with a smile like we were her only customers! Now THAT is amazing customer service! 
      I ordered the smokehouse burger with half and half onion rings/fries...the burger was ridiculously juicy and the onion rings were perfection!!!! Heaven in a burger it was!!!! We scarfed those things down and it was so worth a $45 tab for the three of us...not like the disappointment we had at The other food court experience we had...I'm still a little bitter about that pathetic sized drink. 
     Well the burgers are AMAZING! And service is AMAZING!!! This is the place to chose out of all the restaurants at this food court! 
     P.S...they no longer have a tip line on their bill due to the new chip thing in cards...so make sure you bring some cash if you plan on letting these amazing people serve you! We were so sad we couldn't tip via card we went ahead and found an ATM and returned back to the restaurant to give our waitress $20 tip...she was worth the $3.99 ATM fee! My daughter says it was the right thing to do and she walked away with a \"fluffy feeling\" in her heart! We could have easily just left and not tipped, even the server was ok with that...but AMAZING service deserves to be rewarded! I wish I could remember her name I hope she reads this and know how much we truly appreciate her kindness! So be good to your server, eat good, bring some cash and tip well!"}
{"text":"Not the best experience I've had here. My burger wasn't even edible,bit was super greasy. We sat at the bar and had a good view of the kitchen. When we first got here, everything looked good. Then our drink order was taken, 10 minutes later I had to ask our server for our drinks. Which he apologized for taking forever mind you it was not busy.  Got our drinks and food order was taken, about 15 mins later we got our food, had to wait and extra 3 for sweet potato fries. Took a bite out of my burger and I could feel the grease exploding in my mouth. Set my burger down and when I picked it up my burger was soaked in grease, bun was so soggy, I couldn't set it down on my plate anymore. I ate the burger as grease continuously dripped from the bottom side. The taste was not good at all since I was eating so much grease. Sever was not attentive. I can't say I will be coming here again."}
{"text":"This place is good.  The shakes hit the spot.  We had this for breakfast in Vegas and it was the perfect hang over food"}
{"text":"Food here is good but the cook Nick talked smack the whole time he was making my food. He was upset that I modified my order.  As a customer I am never coming back. If you don't like your job,  find a new one.  The time I came in here before the guy that made my shake was smacking the food tongs on the side of the trash can, gross. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Where's the beef. This was my first time eating at Johnny Rockets. I ordered the Rocket cheeseburger. The hamburger patty came in pieces that didn't even cover half the bun. The burger had no sauce and was horrible. Stay away from this location if you want a decent meal."}
{"text":"This Johnny Rockets location is far the poorest and worse service I've ever been to. The tables are not cleaned, garbage can is full, floor is not mopped, service is slow. 

I remember ordering from a supervisor (his name tag had a supervisor title on it) and he was pretty rude and did not give customer service skills when I asked him about two of the burgers. 

To make things worse. I waited about 15-20 for a dumb burger. 

Go somewhere else if you want to save time or hungry."}
{"text":"Die Besten Hamburger der Welt..."}
{"text":"Ordered Milkshakes when we sat down (before our meal) they didn't arrive until midway through our dinner. Also..... not sure if \"Monica\" is new or not but I looked her in the eye, asked her to please call over our server. She made a face, looked away then pretended I wasn't speaking to her. My friend and I looked at each other like, 'Did she really just BLATANTLY ignore us.' And then I proceeded to watch her for the rest of the meal holding menus while shuffling from one corner of the restaurant to the other doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!"}
{"text":"This is inside Bally's casino food court, $8.00 for the original burger, $9.00 for a mushroom burger, size is kind of small too, well what do you expect from inside a casino on the strip... will be going to in-n-out from now on...."}
{"text":"Everything average and below the average including costumers. Place doesn`t seems to be clean and a lot of dirty tables. Turkey burgers with eggs doesn`t taste special and potatoes as well. We went there just because was desperate to find some place to eat and this place had no queue. Next time I should be veeery hungry to go there"}
{"text":"We have been to JR's many times, but not at this location by our house...and I will never be back. It was dirty, and had horrible service. There were only two other people eating and a group of teenagers sitting around. The employees were hanging out with the group of teenagers and openly hitting on them. Even though it was slow, my husband's food sat in the window for over ten minutes. The cook kept calling for our waitress, but she was sitting and talking. We were sitting right next to the kitchen...you can openly see into it....I could have just grabbed the food myself. Needless to say, the food was cold when he got it, and brought out by someone else. It was only fries and a grilled cheese sandwich, yet took 20 minutes total to get. It was an absolute waste of money. We will not be coming back to this place again. They need better employees."}
{"text":"Salt Overload. 

Decided to eat here before my boyfriend and I hit the road. Bad decision. I got the chicken club sandwich and it was awful. Soggy, gooey chicken with so much salt my mouth hurt and my lips were chapped after eating only half. I was going to go complain but I noticed another customer had already gone up three times and still nothing was done about his order. So here I am leaving a bad yelp review. And it looks like I'm not the only one who had a bad experience.  Worst food in Vegas."}
{"text":"Always loved Johnny Rockets! However the waiter we had today was so amazing! If every restaurant could offer such it would  be wonderful! 

Thomas at Bally's Johnny Rockets is the best! Seriously, what an asset this fella is! He needs to be promoted!"}
{"text":"The waitresses were nice.
The burger was good and the philly steak was okay.
In all, it is a nice fast food place to eat in."}
{"text":"Too slow. Their menu is simple, burgers fries and shakes. Yes, we. We're part of a conference group that created a line for the food court. But, while in line, we could watch unenthusiastic, lethargic employees, barely going through the motions. I know rushes are a pain for food places, but a steady stream of customers is what s place like this depends on - yet none of the workers seemed to care. Fast food is supposed to be that - fast. Not prepared at glacial speed while people wait and wait.  The cook time for my order greater than 30 minutes."}
{"text":"This location is inside the Silverton casino in Las Vegas. It's by the sport book. 

First impressions of the place are of a clean, organized, and family friendly environment. I had a boy's night out with my 9 year old son and decided to eat here.  You gotta love Johnny Rockets because it takes you back to what real diners use to be like. The red stools that spin at the front counter, the small old school music boxes, all the art hanging on the walls, and obviously not to mention the great food. 

At this particular location the service we received was really good. We ordered strawberry shakes and 5 minutes we were sipping on them. Even though there were several customers we had our food within 10 minutes which was really good considering how many customers they had. 

I ordered the Totnachos which were really good and filling. My son ordered the bacon cheese fries which was a very healthy serving. We also had a strawberry shake each. The total was $25.00, not a bad deal for good food, friendly service, and a very good experience. I recommend this place if you find yourself in the Silverton casino."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time we've been here in 5 months. Same problems as the last visit. Nobody welcomes you, but you have to wait to be seated. When seated we noticed trash on the table outside. This was the case back in October! Floor was not clean, do they ever mop? After waiting for our drinks we had to wait for 2 other tables to be seated. The waitress took their order before ours. We contemplated about leaving, but our kids wanted to stay. She finally took our order. Everything came out fine. NO NAPKINS!  Gave us a few paper towels. Seriously? We were afraid to drink all of our drink because we were not sure when we would get a refill. We were almost done with our hamburgers before we got more fries. Had to wait to get the check. She carried our money around for 8 minutes before returning with our change. Our dirty dishes sat at the end of the table until we left. 

The serve was ridiculous. 1 waitress for 8 tables at 11:15am? She was more concerned with the jukebox than the customers. Same with the manager. He didn't help his staff or the customers at all. I saw him standing in the back talking with the dish washer. Very bad management and lack of care. No apologies or any acknowledge by the waitress or manager for the horrible serve and extremely long wait. 

If you want great service go to the location at Arrowhead Mall. This location is horrible. The corporate office needs to step in. This manager is not good at his job at all."}
{"text":"This place is good, burgers were pretty yummy. Fries were super good. 2 reasons im doing 2 stars. 1, im allergic to tomato and i made sure the guy knew no tomato on my burger, it took about 15-20min to get my burger and dude comes up and tells me \" heres your burger with no tomato\" it had a freaking tomato and i told him, its right there. He proceeded to make another one. Second f up was that we ordered extra fries and they were sitting on the counter until we were half way done with our food and the guy brings it asking us if we ordered extra fries? Obviously you took the order dude ! Main guy who owns the place was there and they were trying hard to hide it from him. First time at a Johnny rockets and I'm honestly upset.."}
{"text":"Thomas always takes care of us. Extra special sauce? No problem. Better than you think - get here and go clear."}
{"text":"Everyone loves some good music and a great burger. I have been to this location multiple times and to be honest its not my utmost favorite place to eat a burger but its not that bad either. 
This location is extremely busy on the weekends so expect service to be unwelcoming when you first walk in. It almost seems chaotic and as if your in there way, which might be why they are always hiring!
The burgers come out fast and you do have to order your French fries separately along with your drink. I always go for the classic burger on the menu, never fails me. If you do order the French fries it is unlimited. They wont ask you if you want more you will have to stop them and ask yourself. 
The pricing isn't bad either but that's ends once you order the fries and drinks. so its a win or loss however you look at it."}
{"text":"Terrible service especially for a Wednesday night. Stood waiting to be seated for 10 minutes while three people walked past us. The dinner rush must have just ended and there were understandably dirty tables everywhere. Once seated it took 15 minutes to get our drink order, another 10 to get the drinks. And after placing our food order we sat for literally an hour waiting. It took so long our waiter came by and gave us a plate of fries \"on the house\" for waiting so long. The food was blan, and we had to skip on our shakes after dinner- the whole reason we went- because we were all tired of sitting after two hours. The dirty tables around us were never bussed during our entire stay and the employees all just hid behind the counter. Our bill came and turns out they charged us for the \"free fries\" that we never asked for.  But we didn't even try to get them removed from our ticket because God knows it'd be lunchtime tomorrow by the time they got it right. Unbelievable."}
{"text":"We came to the Venetian to gamble (no luck ) and then swung over to sin city brewery , we decided we were a bit hungry and headed over to the food court . We ate at Johnny Rockets and it was delicious. Anthony ,  Daniel , John and Sergio were amazing . The food was delicious and so warm . Which obviously after a few beers it's a big deal . I can't wait to come back again and enjoy a good burger and a great beer ."}
{"text":"Since I work in the mall there are only a few places we usually go for lunch and this is a place my coworkers frequent, I do not.

The food is ok, mediocre burgers and fries but my major problem with this location is the service. They continuously mess up orders and substitutions.

 My other problem is that they seem to ignore their customers. You call ahead they don't pick up, you are standing right in front of the hostess' stand and the person just ignores you. Wouldn't you think they would want to try and help you out right away? I guess not. 

Since this is the first official review for this location I will share a review meant for this location posted on a different JR:
       \"Here's a suggestion, if your restaurant is dead and there's        someone waiting to place a to go order, how about u tell the staff to tend to them instead of performing their unenthused dance routine for nobody.  Poor prioritizing!!\".

Care about your customers and you will have them keep coming back for more, don't ignore"}
{"text":"My little brother wanted to go to Johnny Rockets for his birthday, so we did. We get there and they sit us at a dirty table then they get our drink orders wrong. The sever switches and he argues that there is no cheese on the burger we were ordering. Then, the food comes out and hmm there is cheese on the burger. He took it back and my sister was the only not able to eat. The waiter didn't even seem sorry. I'm a waitress so I understand mistakes happen but it was just a terrible experience. Location at the mall is MUCH better."}
{"text":"This johnny rockets is in the Monte Carlo food court.
Service was smiling and the tater tots fresh.
The breakfast sandwhich was not. Over processed. Barely warm and an untoasted English muffin.
Not a sandwhich that will bring me back."}
{"text":"Disgusting.  fries bad....ugh.  my whole party didn't seem too enthused about this place.  and it's location sucks -- right smack dab in the middle of a PACKED food court inside the gigantic maze which is the Venetian.  we had such high expectations after seeing this franchise on Undercover Boss.  what a disappointment.  disgusting."}
{"text":"Great food, service and prices. They need to start playing the 50's music tho to get the atmosphere we want!!! That's the only complaint I have. Kids loved it!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic floats but a tad to expensive for burgers but they are delicious route 66 :)"}
{"text":"Been to a million of these places. Always good for what it is. But this place stands out. Mostly because of the friendly, attentive and advice with a smile staff. My server Nicole, was so nice. She really made you feels welcomed. Places like this need more servers like this. Bravo Nicole"}
{"text":"This place has horrible service. Take forever to get our drinks and food. This is some bullshit. I want my damn food, a bitch hungry."}
{"text":"Loved it!!! reminded me of when I was a kid going to the soda fountain with my mom. Had a Burger Fries and a shake. Everything came out hot and fresh. Shake was creamy and delish! Definitely will go back!"}
{"text":"I used to consider this a 4* establishment. But recent changes to the food and increased prices have messed it all up. Johnny Rockets seems to be chasing a more premium product now. The burgers are still good but gone are simple potato buns and now it's brioche. Gone are basic French Fries, replaced with a Wendy's style \"natural cut\" that aren't as tasty to me. And prices that rival or top Fuddruckers, without being as generous or as good a quality beef, is the stake in Johnny's heart. 

No complaints about service - a tip is to sit at the counter if you want more attention (refills etc)."}
{"text":"It was wonderful to find this place during our trip to AZ, as all of the Johnny Rockets in our area have disappeared. It was an oasis in the desert!

My egg salad sandwich (my routine JR staple) was very good except it had a bit too much mayo. If I were to return, I'd ask for light mayo. Other than that, perfect! The fries were pretty good. The salad was wonderful. We also got nice to-go containers that held up well for traveling. That was a nice touch -- when you're driving around, trying to figure out where your hotel is and the developed area is too new to appear on maps yet, it's good to know your leftovers are not spilling out in the rental car. 

The highlight was the sweet, awesome service from our sweet, awesome, super-hot waitress. She was so breathtaking that I could barely speak my order. Ah well, there are worse problems to have!"}
{"text":"The casino was hosting the annual Subie Invasion so we decided to come into the casino to cool off and have lunch. The manager was working the floor by herself and seemed to be struggling. We were not in a hurry so we grabbed two menus off a nearby table since those customers had left before putting their orders in. The manager, Kimberly, did not make any eye contact and acknowledgement at first and proceeded to take a to go order and wait on the men sitting at the counters. Once a booth cleared up we moved to it for comfort. Another employee walked in and Kimberly told him that we needed to put our orders in. It took awhile before she came and apologized for the wait and explained that the other employees either did not show up on time or they were late. The food was decent and service was ok after that. Fries were a perfect crisp. I ordered a single bacon cheeseburger and the bf ordered a chicken club and a strawberry oreo milkshake. Typical Johnny Rockets chain that needs more reliable employees who show up for work on time."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place is the fact it's open 24 hours. The food was subpar and the prices high. I wouldn't eat at this Place again."}
{"text":"My lady wanted to go here when I wanted to head to the food court for some Popeye's Chicken.   She won. She says we can go to Popeye's anywhere else, but we never go to Johnny Rockets.  She was right about that.  

 That's what you gotta do when you are a guy in these situations.  Suck it Up.

She got the Route 66 and I got the Smoke House Single.  Not bad for either one.

Not salty, which is how I like it. People complaining on YELP about \"no flavor\", I would disagree with them on that matter.   YOU DO NOT NEED THE EXTRA SALT, FATTY.  

1/2 Fries and 1/2 Onion Rings were just the right amount of portions for us both.

She got the Strawberry Milkshake and I just got a cup of H20(I've limited the amount of soda I drink each day no matter where I am)   Milkshake was very good and I got a sip or two.

Total came to about $32, which I would say is on the  high end for something like this place $$$.   The food was fine and tasty, the price was rather obscene for what I'm willing to spend usually. No mess-ups with the order, otherwise I would of asked for my $$$ or asked for a new order till done right.

Would I return, probably not. This was a one time deal only for us.  For them prices,  I will run as fast as I can into a super busy Las Vegas crowd down the strip or inside the casino.

NUFF SAID."}
{"text":"Johnny Rockets at Mandalay Bay Food Court. Quick and easy dinner for two on our arrival date in Vegas for the Chevrolet meetings. Like any food court in any mall in America, no ambiance what-so-ever, sticky tables, hard plastic booth seats and crying babies galore. A Deluxe burger, a Double Deluxe burger, two fries, 2 bottled adult beverages was $50. Fries were nothing to rave about, neither were the burgers, but the meat was better than fast food quality and I was able to order it rare without having to argue with them about it. Beverages were $7.50 each so the food portion of the bill was still $35 for two burgers and fries. Minimal wait for ordering and food

Would I eat here again?  If I had to, but not by my choosing."}
{"text":"We came here when we went to go see the dinosaur exhibit. They were really busy and seemed like they were very short staffed. Our waiter was nice, but you could tell he was overwhelmed. We ordered two burgers and a kids meal. The kids meal didn't come out until about 20 minutes after our burgers came out, so my child was more difficult... everywhere I go they always bring the kids meal out first or at the same time. We were able to have his meal removed from our bill seeing that he didn't even eat it because he filled up on French fries from our meal. 
We have been to this area twice now to see the exhibits they have, but it's always a disappointment. It's too pricey to see anything and the food service isn't a good experience. Maybe one Day they will get it together and this whole area could be fun."}
{"text":"Awesome food, great location, great new ownership! They really take care of their customers..."}
{"text":"This is our second time back to the Johnny Rockets located in the Silverton Hotel & Casino. It's easy to find and delicious to enjoy! 

We split a burger and fries. The fries were fresh and crispy, you could tell they were not sitting and were made to order! The burger was juicy and fresh, with crispy lettuce and tomatoes. 

The service was great as well with the order and food being delivered quickly! The waiter also came back to fill up our waters several time, great service. 

We will be back the next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"I've always liked JR'S  but I was very disappointed with the onion rings this time around. They are from frozen and were very hard and lacked the fresh onion flavor.  My patty melt was very good, the bread was grilled to cunchy perfection with good fresh burger and nicely grilled onion.

The sad thing is that I'm so full I could easily done without the rings in the first place! Oh well. ..next time I'll know  better and JR's will get more stars."}
{"text":"they have good burgers, fries and chicken. reminds me of red robins. yuuuuumy :P"}
{"text":"Oh, Johnny. I had high hopes for you. Any restaurant that has little jukes on the table automatically earns points from me, but in this case they were the only aspect worth any points at all.

First - the burgers are good, but they aren't anything to write home about. They are SMALL and expensive, and don't even come with fries. 

Second - their 'combos' don't even give you a break. You can get a burger for $5, a drink for $2 and fries for $3, or a \"burger combo\" for $10. What the hey?

Third - service was s l o w and for no reason...it was dead in there. 

I won't be going back. It's a shame, but that's life!"}
{"text":"It's fast food so you can't really expect much but their food wasn't totally crap, it had decent taste and wasn't a grease trap. $40 got me a cheeseburger, chicken fingers, fries & onion ring combo, oreo shake and a drink. A bit much for food court eats in my opinion, granting you're in the casino and everything is inflated but really it's ridiculous to spend that when you can shell out a little more and have a better meal at say Yardhouse. 

It takes quite a bit to get your food also so technically it wasn't FAST FOOD lol. Ordered fries/onion rings combo but was only given onion rings, no dipping sauce given for chicken fingers. They fixed it but the spotty service was still annoying. On the bright side, the Oreo shake hit the spot!"}
{"text":"OMFG this place is loud!  FIFW consider bringing earplugs!

Pert and perky service with a smile the two times I've been here, FYI.

Food is okey dokey neighbor!

Prices are fair 'ta middlin' for the burger joint grub.

This place is awash with hard surfaces...even the ceiling tiles.  Hence the loud music and other hubbub careens around and leaves you with ringing ears..."}
{"text":"Great service, and fast..   You can build a serious burger at this place.  JOHNNY ROCKETS.  Inside Silverton Casino."}
{"text":"This Johnny Rockets was a lifesaver!!!! 

We were stumbling down the strip at a very early morning time and couldn't find a decent meal anywhere. We finally stumbled upon the Johnny Rockets and went in. They had the usual menu and it served us well. 

The workers were all friendly and we had a great time laughing and talking with them at the early morning hours."}
{"text":"Can I do less then one star? Took 15 minutes before any servers came to us. Very unorganized. Employees standing around doing nothing. Had hoped for better service. Food was fine but service... Not good."}
{"text":"The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they take a long time to get food ready. We waited almost 15 mins for it being a fast food restaurant.  Other restaurants in the food court had people order after we ordered, and they got their food before us. 

I do have to say, there food is delicious. I had the chipotle crispy chicken and my friend had the chipotle burger. They were delicious!!"}
{"text":"waited at least 45 minutes for terrible overpriced food. my son's hamburger was actually bloody. never again!"}
{"text":"I've had Johnny Rockets shakes before and they're great but the service and food at this particular location was not worth what I paid. The last time I went there I waited nine minutes at the front of the line before leaving for another restaurant. Today when I went there it took them a couple minutes for a manager to take my order. She didn't even smile or greet me. Then it takes over 6 minutes for my chicken fingers to arrive. They weren't even all that good. I work in the Grand Canal Shoppes and the standard of service is greater than what I received from this restaurant. I only went there today because Chipotle was having card issues. I'd rather take my chances with E. Coli than go back to Johnny Rockets."}
{"text":"Kind of a pricy burger diner. Onion rings mediocre-clearly not fresh. The menu claims they're a guest favorite. Crispy exterior with a delightful onion mush interior. Bring these morsels to the next family reunion's ring toss game and be the hit of the party. The burgers are indeed excellent. 
1/3 lb patties, with more of a nicely seasoned home-style flava'. 
Excellent ice. What, excellent ice? Yep! It's that kind of slightly soft pellet stuff, rarely seen in Vegas, fun to chew on. 
Service has always been very friendly. Real plates and glass glasses. Very clean. Working tableside 5-cent juke boxes with mostly 50's and 60's music playing in the foreground rather than the background. 
Expect to pay a minimum of $11-12 per person+tip for the basic burger, fry, and Coke. Jonny R's doesn't blow me away, nor does it suck."}
{"text":"Super thanks to Mike Ayala who actually helped me a ton to follow up and send me a lost receipt. 
Great customer service, much appreciated.

Fresh burger and pretty good biscuit, the tater tots were really good and their live coconut was an unexpected treat. They handheld the lunch rush very well."}
{"text":"$15 for a fast food burger and cold, stale fries....and a 45 min wait for \"fast\" food. No thanks. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"First off, I'll have to say that they must have read the other reviews because my server was extra insanely attentive and friendly. He was almost too friendly. It was rather quiet at the time so that might be part of it. 

The location is great. You have a relatively nice view of Dundas square and the atmosphere is right out of a 50s diner. 

As for the food, it is a typical diner style. Extra greasy with a side of fries. Fries were fine and the chicken BBQ sandwich was a ok but a little too much in the grease dept."}
{"text":"Ok so these darn casinos will overcharge for everything, but besides costing far to much for burgers, the food was really good! I actually think it was better than the burger I had at The House of Blues. We got a classic burger with some onion rings on top, fries, chicken sandwich with onion rings, a large soda and bottled beer for $45! Yikes that's vegas for you. But at least it was really tasty."}
{"text":"Tommy was the best waiter ever!!!  That guy did everything!  He wast fast, polite, professional and just outstanding overall!  He definitely make this place great, because the rest of the team is horrible.  Tommy definitely deserves to be the manager and I would say a trainer for new employees.  He is an asset to this location and if he left, they would go under for sure!"}
{"text":"Really disappointed in this restaurant and will never return to this location.  My wife and I were shopping in the mall and decided that we would stop by Johnnt Rockets for a bite of lunch.  Being a Thursday, it was not busy at all, maybe four tables and a couple at the counter.   

We were promptly addressed by the wait staff who took our drink order (no problem so far).  When she returned,she took our order. A couple of minutes later another waitress came by to let me know that there were no mushrooms for my burger. No problem,  I'll just order another burger.

 About 10 minutes later our order arrives.  I bite in to my burger and it is bloody.  I send it back. After about 10 minutes the waitress comes back and says something about the Manager cooking it because they are backed up. She does offer me a complimentary shake for my troubles (thank you).

 By now there is probably eight tables.  Twenty minutes later, I still don't have my burger and my wife is done with her lunch. I finally had enough and told the waitress that I'm tired of waiting and to just bring me my check..  Instead of a check she brought me my burger.. Then, we got attitude because I told her that I didn't want the hamburger anymore.  Just the check.."}
{"text":"Simplified menu, good burgers, unremarkable

I like the prototype restaurant concept of this Johnny Rockets in terms of the simplified menu and quick service.  Burgers are tasty if a tad small, and the place is easy to eat at with younglings.  

Only drawback is this approach makes the restaurant completely unremarkable.  It's hard to recall anything noteworthy from the experience.  Johnny Rocket's at least had that 1950s theme.  JR's needs a signature dish and dessert, amazing service, or a decorative theme to make you pick it over anything else."}
{"text":"I am not usually a fan of places like this, but I went with my husband. I was pleasantly surprised how good it was. I had a burger and chocolate shake. The food was good and the service was wonderful. I would absolutely go again."}
{"text":"Sometimes service is slow but our food is usually consistent! Mmmmm, & the shakes are yummy!"}
{"text":"Would leave zero starts if that was an option.  Service was fine, food was what we expected.  Restaurant was disgusting.  Ladies room had stopped toilet, for quite awhile obviously based on the amount of waste in toilet.  Urine on the bottom of toilet worse than I'd expect in a men's room.  No toilet paper, and grunge on faucets made me think twice to touch.  Restaurant chairs showed every bit on grunge on their stainless steel, and floors disgusting.  I'm shocked they pass health inspections.  Eat ANYWHERE ELSE but here.  Never again for us."}
{"text":"Our first meal in Vegas. It was just as I expected it to be, plus a bonus. Our server \"Thomas\" was over the top awesome for customer service. He was excited, informative and all around impressive. We got better service here than at the super pricey buffets on the strip.
That being said...I am not easy to impress regarding customer service since I manage that aspect in my line of work. 
So, Thomas keep on being awesome.
MAHALO FROM HAWAI'I"}
{"text":"Great taste, great customer service, it is a little pricey. Not sold as combos everything's separate. Overall great experience."}
{"text":"The good: onion rings. wow they are awesome, made just right so I gave it a bonus star.

The O.K.: milkshakes, they're fine. I ordered an Oreo Milkshake, not enough Oreo flavor so it tasted like a Vanilla Milkshake with a cookie or two mashed in it.

The not-so-good: the unbelievable grease. Yes, I know. Burgers and fries are suppose to be greasy but this was ridiculous. The Bacon Cheeseburger was upsetting. How? Tasteless patty, greasy bun, chewy bacon. Sure, it was big. But it's about quality. We also ordered the Streamliner (Boca Burger) and it was absolutely tasteless. Too much mustard. So it tasted like sour cucumbers and mustard in bun. 

Service was not good. It wasn't horrible, just not good. 

Only reason I'll go back? Onion rings."}
{"text":"This place was no different from the other Johnny Rockets I have attended. Clean place and good food."}
{"text":"I took my kids to this nostalgic diner last night before the theatre.  We did not have a lot of time and I asked the server if they could accommodate our tight timing.  She was great.  We were quickly seated, had our order taken and the food was delivered very soon thereafter.  I have no complaints about the service at all.  Unfortunately, the food did not meet my expectations.  

I had previously been to a Johnny Rockets on a Royal Caribbean cruise.  We had to pay extra to go to that restaurant on the cruise but it was worth it - I still remember how good the hamburger was!  Since this is their speciality, I ordered the cheeseburger with a side Cesar salad.  I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I was in the hamburger.  It was one of the worst tasting burgers I have ever had (I did not say anything to the waitress since I did not have time to change my order).  I can't understand how anyone could like that burger!  Having said that, to be fair, my 13 year old son had the burger and fries and a strawberry milkshake and he didn't complain about the burger but he didn't say he loved it either.

My daughter ordered the BLT which is difficult to screw up.    

I found the price of the shake (for the size) to be quite overpriced ($6.50 or $6.99).  The price of the other food was reasonable.  

Overall a very unsatisfactory dining experience."}
{"text":"FAILURE TO LAUNCH. 

I generally try to stay positive when I write these reviews, even if my experience isn't great. I also try to avoid personal attacks. I'll make an exception in this case. 


Johnny Rockets is awful. I'd call it Johnny Rotten's but it would be an insult to the Sex Pistols front man, and I kinda like their music. 

I anoint this scum bucket of a restaurant with one star despite the fact that I didn't actually eat here--actually, I'd give it negative stars precisely because I didn't eat here. 

I'll provide a bit of context. 

My wife and I decided to take our baby for an outing. The weather was threatening, so we sought out some place indoors where we could walk around and stare at pretty consumer goods. 

We chose Vaughan Mills. 

It was lunchtime, and we were hungry, but wanted to avoid the food court because it was packed and loud, and the baby was asleep in his stroller. 

Got that? SLEEPING BABY. 

So, we went to Johnny Rockets for the promise of a quick sit-down lunch, a tasty burger and perhaps an order of chicken fingers while THE BABY SLEPT. 

At first glance, Johnny Rockets reminds one of the Departed Lime RIckey's chain-styled as an old school diner in the middle of a 2000-era shopping complex. 

I may not remember much about Lime RIckey's, but it wasn't filthy (Johnny Rockets was), and the vinyl booths weren't black with grime and half-torn (as they were here). But we were hungry and THE BABY WAS ASLEEP. 

A sign up front directed us to seat ourselves. So we picked a booth towards the back where we would be unmolested. A porcine server suggested we try the other side of the restaurant, where it would be QUIETER, so THE BABY COULD KEEP SLEEPING. 

We moved. 

A second server approached with menus, and COMMENTED ON THE SLEEPING BABY. She turned and left without taking drink orders. No warnings were provided. 

My wife and I shot each other a look over the menu, which was hideously overpriced-basic burgers start around $12, which is excessive unless ol' Johnny Rocket has a stack of Wagyu beef hidden up his ass. 

No sooner were we about to debate our exit than Server #2 reappeared. Holding a birthday cake. OVER THE SLEEPING BABY. And, making her way to another table, brayed at the top of her idiot lungs. 'HEY, WE HAVE A BIRTHDAY HERE!!!\" 

Right on top of our SLEEPING BABY (who soon transitioned to CRYING BABY, because of this monumentally stupid, stupid, dumb idiot who couldn't have bothered to tell us it might get a bit noisy?). 

Think of every curse word you know. Scream it at the top of your lungs. Break something. Ransack a car. Burn down a house. Invade a foreign country. That's how angry we were at these morons. 

SLEEPING BABY, YOU DUMBASSES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


Needless to say, we got the hell out, and soothed our precious cargo back to sleep. But inside I plotted my revenge against the brainless wonders who couldn't be bothered to give a new family the heads up. 

Hopefully, this review does the job. 

Avoid at all costs. Especially if you have kids."}
{"text":"Burger was decent but they've updated the menu and it's gotten worse and badly overpriced. Meal for two people at $50 with tip, no alcohol, no appetizers, no desert is badly overpriced for the quantity of food and the experience inside restaurant. Smashburger is similar quality/style half the price. Can't see how they survive with their price point this out of whack."}
{"text":"A friend and I recently had an awe inspiring visit to this particular Johnny Rockets!   

When our waitress brought our food, she asked if we needed anything.  My friend responded \"no\", but asked if she, the waitress, needed any prayer.  To our surprise, she opened up, and told us her brother was going through some difficult times, so we bowed in prayer for \"Jeremy\".

Much to our surprise, when the bill came at the end of the evening, the meal had been comped!  AND, we found out the person responsible for paying for our meal was actually one of the gals on staff.  I believe her name was Carlee.

I cannot express how grateful for, and amazed I am at this young woman's care for her community!  She has an inspiring faith and is a tremendous asset to the restaurant, her manager, and more!!  

So, wholeheartedly, I would recommend this restaurant!  Not only is the food good, but the staff, especially Carlee, is downright fantastic!!

{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever had! We waited 6 mins just to be greeted as we stood at the register. They not so much as said hello or we will be right with you. However they looked at us and continued whatever they were doing .... I finally had to ask- hello are you open, then one person pops his (Jeymar)head up and says yeah- and goes back to making whatever he is making... again not a single we will be right with you or anything! I began my timer on my phone and it took another 2 mins before someone came to the front to take our order. Once we received our order it was wrong and at this point. We had lost our appetite.  If I could give no stars I would! Smh! Terrible service!"}
{"text":"Food was good but disappointed in how slow they were. I mean my cousins and I were the first in line and still waited longer then expected."}
{"text":"Love the feel, vibe of Johnny Rockets.  Just has something different, like that vintage feel, we ate at the counter and enjoyed the classic music and oldies.  My 9 year old son enjoyed the theme and I am sure some of us older folk could enjoy the nostalgic feel of the place.
As for the food, just burger and fries cooked on a flat grill right in front of you.  Just a simple burger and has that just fresh taste to it.  Love the chocolate cokes they offer as well.
Service was above normal as most of the staff was friendly and in good spirits, singing along to the songs and enjoying the atmosphere.  I would say this is an excellent place for kids since I saw so many children here."}
{"text":"Servers are nice, food is decent, but what the hell is with the prices? I'm from LA, and no where on their menus do we have to pay more for fries when getting a burger, and shake prices here, good Lord! 

And during our visit, they blasted the music really loudly and the servers were dancing to the song. Umm, if I wanted to get a show, I would've gone somewhere else. That has never happened at any other Johnny Rockets I've gone to. That really kinda killed it for me."}
{"text":"A really good burger for a chain in a mall's food court... They really do a burger justice here and they cook it to order while you watch. I like their fries too..."}
{"text":"My kids really like this place, so I can tolerate it once in awhile. Their standard burger is your best bet. I suggest you avoid their chicken-based items entirely - BLAND. I'll gladly visit this place over a McDonald's, Denny's or any other ultra-generic-chains. Oh, and their shakes are pretty darned good too."}
{"text":"After a long day at Bass Pro Shops we went to the Silverton to eat something quick. I was ill being there as the whole place smelled like cigarette smoke. The floors were dirty and the booth table was very uncomfortable. I paid nine dollars for a burger that was only 1/3 the size of the one on the menu. I gave Johnny Rockets two stars only for their sweet potato fries. Also for those with kids, the single ply napkins are worthless. You make a bigger mess have to use so many of them. Better off taking our own wetnaps with you."}

Onion rings are my favorite kind - not too much batter - and crispy, hot. This is all about a gut bomb at 3AM after losing $200 at the blackjack table. It was exactly what we wanted and it was GOOD! Its $8 bucks, yeah but lets face it - location location location. And you just blew hundreds of dollars on the slots and cards.  Live a little"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service however is lacking.  3 people taking orders.  1 of the waitresses took our order and never saw her again.  Had to hold my card in the air to get someone else to give us the tab.  So disappointing.  The one gentleman waiting tables was good but the two woman were in a turf war and not very efficient."}
{"text":"Loved their food, but they took WAY too long to get it to us. My husband isn't much of a patient man, but being the only customers, he assumed it would go by fast. Unfortunately, it definitely did not. They decided it was training time and ended up over cooking our food while giggling and laughing about it. My food came to me a mess :( I've never had a problem with this place, so I'd highly recommend it for the food, but apparently society just lacks on customer service now a days. Their is no such thing as the CUSTOMER being RIGHT anymore."}
{"text":"Ended up here on New Year's Eve since 5 & Diner closed at 3pm for the holiday... Johnny Rockets was closing at 6pm and we made it just in the nick of time! Grabbed a seat at the counter and ordered a 9\" Rocket Dog (ketchup, mustard, relish) with fries. Enjoyed watching the cook hustle on the grill, as well as the signature smiley face ketchup bowls for the fries. The fries were really good! I also enjoyed the Texas Toast that the hot dog came on. A very tasty meal to end the year on."}
{"text":"onGreat shakes and always great service.I love the atmosphere this restraunt has. Great shake selection and the very good vegan burgers. I do think the food is a little over priced and if you are someone like me who only likes your burger well done this is not the place for you. Their burgers are always pink no matter who cooks it and to me it always that blood/ re microwaved meat taste and they never wipe down any of their seats they only brush the crumbs off the table tops and thats about it. The restraunt always seems to have bare minimum cleaning put into it."}
{"text":"Staying at the Excalibur and we saw this place down stairs. We decided to stop in because we were starving. We stopped in at 2 pm, we were only in line for less than 5 minuets. Family of 3 ordered the Route 66, Smokehouse Single, Rocket Double. 3 Large sodas later and the cost is over $45!! While we waited for our food we got our drinks and table. We each had the lemonade (delicious). The seating area was clean as well as the drink station. The food only took about 8 minuets to come out. It tasted good, but definitely not worth the price. Better tasting food at Whataburger or In and Out. This was our first time eating at a Johnny Rockets, we will never be back to another one."}
{"text":"They have the best milk shakes. I will not go anywhere else for one. They come in one size, and it's huge. They are under $3, can't beat that.  The workers are super friendly too."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! This has been a family favourite for a long time, but our last visit was terrible. The food was overpriced and the service was poor and the worst thing was the place had a bad fly problem and the tables were not cleared quickly and cleaned to a good standard, which made the fly problem worse. No music was playing and no atmosphere was present. The food was overpriced and unsatisfactory. It's a shame as this was my kids favourite place, but they have no interest in the place now. Someone needs to address the problems this unit is having with poor management and customer service."}
{"text":"We came around 11, it hadn't quite picked up yet. Even though, service still sucked. They sat us right away but that's about it. We had to ask for napkins and silverware. The burgers were cheap. You get what you pay for. My boyfriends burger was lazily put together and my chicken sandwich had sat out too long. The bread was extremely soggy so I took the top bread from one side and used it as the bottom of my other side. It had no flavor and I won't be coming back here. 

When the lunch rush came in they took forever seating people. I witnessed a couple of people stand in line and then after a wait, decided to leave. I wish I had done the same. it would have saved me money and a stomach ache."}
{"text":"Hey, this is a fast-food joint inside the MGM Grand.  The only reason you go here is because:  a) you have no money to eat out at the fancier restaurants, or b) you want to feed your kid who doesn't care about what they eat.

We fall into the \"b\" category.  Our kids were hungry and didn't want filet mignon or truffle fries so we treated them Johnny Rockets.  They liked it.  The food was okay and we were given a buzzer when the food was ready so we didn't have to stand there waiting for our number to be called.  

Overall, it serves it's purpose."}
{"text":"We came on a Monday evening and ordered their new Philly-cheesesteak sandwich ($13.95) with mushrooms for $5.08 (Used the $6 Groupon valued for $12) 

- I've eaten at JR Sacramento and Los Angeles with high unsatisfactory taste, but decided to give it another shot bc LV has a Groupon! Didn't particularly enjoy their burgers last few times, so decided to go with a Philly-cheese. 
- Lackluster taste. American cheese!? Come on! Kraft!? Yuck... 
- You know when you eat a good philly-cheesesteak sandwich when you bite into it and all the meat and cheese gush out, right!? didn't happen...fail..
- Microwaved bread. Far from toasted. 
- I've tasted better philly-cheese from SUBWAY!!! haha..that already says a mouth-full. - Almost like a Costco cheesesteak but bigger.  
- Stale french fries. 
- For a sitdown burger joint, J.R is at the bottom of my list. For $20, you can go to Red Robin and get 2 great burgers for that price. 
- Generous portions for a split meal.
- The only admirable trait that JR has would be their classic style and friendly service! A decent experience for a train-wreck meal. 
- Good thing we still had leftovers from the Nordstrom Cafe! Haha..Even our waitress was telling us \"ooo-ooo, that Panini and cupcake..Delicious.\" We ate it at J.R. haha"}
{"text":"Great old school atmosphere. The Feb of the establishment is Rebecca. She made it an awesome experience."}
{"text":"Thank you for always being open. Ate here 3 out of 4 nights.  Big ups to Johnny Rockets."}
{"text":"I'm definitely not a fast food person, especially being a vegetarian, but I was super hungry after playing a show here at the Excalibur one night and went with my band members.  Lo and behold, they have a veggie burger!  So, I ordered that and tater tots.  Enjoyed everything I got!  It's a fun, old-fashioned vibe.  The dance routine that the staff has to do was ehhh.  I could tell they weren't into it.  I would probably feel silly doing it, too.  But, still a good experience.  Definitely consider this a food option if I'm in that casino."}
{"text":"Six French fries? Six?

Ok, that's an exaggeration, but not by much. I recently went to the Johnny Rockets at Westgate in Glendale, AZ and ordered one of their \"specials\": Bacon Burger & fry. And, of course, a delicious (REAL) Cherry Coke.

I've always loved the ambiance of Johnny's, and this location, a few skips down from AMC Westgate and a few football field lengths from the Cardinals Stadium, didn't let down. The waitress was wonderful, the music fantastic, area very nice, and the food good - what I got, that is.

The bathroom stinks, however, and I'm not referring to smell. It's made for one at a time for a restaurant that holds dozens or more of people. Bad idea. Plus, I had the unfortunate experience of learning this firsthand when I opened the door and interrupted a small child who, I guess was too young to know to lock the door. Or, more likely, it's the establishment at fault for having such inconvenient facilities. 

Though I'm not Republican, nor subscribe to their way of life, I'm still conservative and I like standards kept up from place to place. This is like all other Johnny Rockets, so if you liked one, you should have a good time for a very decent price."}
{"text":"Milkshakes, 'nuff said!"}
{"text":"Very pricey! Drink not included in combo price. Had the bacon cheeseburger and it was very good. The fries were very tasty as well. It was Saturday evening and I really wanted to see the Penn State College football game and they couldn't change the channel because it was controlled by the hotel. I didn't understand this and was very annoyed by it. I will only return if it's a last option."}
{"text":"Hey it's Johnny Rockets, so the food is what it is. But they are now using  angus beef and the burgers tasted great. The customer experience was absolutely first class. Everyone was frequently and accommodating. I'll come. Ack for sure."}
{"text":"Great Customer service. The shakes are yummly. Had the Burger with Onion rings on it. Ohh so delicious. A little pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"+++ This business has closed +++

Johnny Rockets is replacing JR Burger Grill at this location (Aug 23, 2013)"}
{"text":"First time customer. I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger which was pretty good, surprised!  Worth return trip.  Only negative is the place is really loud."}
{"text":"The lady taking the order Giselle was hard to understand got our order wrong also napkins were hard to find if you don't get a drink somebody was smoking and workers did nothing"}
{"text":"Middle of the road burger. Decent enough, but nothing special. The fries are decidedly unspecial.

Service is okay, food is pretty quick, even on a game night, and otherwise, it's alright. Much prefer In-n-out or Smashburger, but this does in a pinch."}
{"text":"I remember my first imbibing (thanks to Lauren V for the word) of 80 proof peppermint schnapps.  It literally took my breath away for a few moments, finally leaving me with the minty aroma reminiscient in many a drunk tank, during the Christmas season.

I also remember my first experience with Johnny Rockets boneless buffalo wings.  It was last night, about an hour before the hockey game.  And much to my chagrin, they literally took my breath away for a few moments... it was nothing like that 1986 smash hit from Berlin on the Top Gun soundtrack.  

Picture if you will, a plate of reconstituted Swanson chicken nuggets that you microwaved, and then forgot about on the counter for an hour because you had to go and satify a more immediate urge.  Then, being the alchemist that you are, imagine crafting an elixir of 40% hot sauce and 60% vinegar, which you pour onto the plate of stale nuggets (only after re-warming them in the microwave for 30 seconds), so that it forms a pool of pungent goodness.

If \"Summer's Eve\" made boneless buffalo wings, I would expect them to be just like the one's served at Johnny Rockets.  Yum.  It was like a crappy appetizer AND a douche.  On the plus side, my yeast infection seems to have all but cleared up."}
{"text":"This place was great.  But our server, Jesus, was even better.  

I would come here again just to see Jesus!"}
{"text":"My burger was delicious; however it was on the greasy side. My friend's burger was saturated in grease. The fries were okay but I preferred the cheese fries. They have pepsi products which I prefer coke products. Paid over $20 bucks for 2 meals and wasn't satisfied for what I paid. The gentleman at the counter was friendly so no complaints there. Overall I wasnt thrilled and it wasnt terrible."}
{"text":"I was surprised that this place served beer, but they do and that's a huge plus.  I ate here with my gf while waiting for our movie to begin.  Its a cool little spot with a good theme.  She ordered the sliders, which was quite expensive for the small amount of burgers that she got.  But hey, the price is on par with what's usually charged for sliders.  I would recommend this place for a cheap bite to eat if you're in the mall and the food court is closed.  Extra point for serving alcohol!

{"text":"I used to go here a lot especially since my work was right near this restaurant. Since, I never had a long lunch break I usually order ahead of time (like 30-45mins) and pick up my order when I am on my break.  Sometimes my order is ready and other times I wait another 15mins or more.  

I have gotten their burgers and shakes and it was ehhh.  I didn't really enjoy their burgers, I feel like I could better burgers at in & out for a cheaper price.  
The times where I have eaten there, the service was okay no one really paid much attention to us. It was basically ordered our meal and then paid for our meal.  

The place is like a 1950s diner which was pretty cool and they even had a cute little jukebox that you can put your money in and play some 50s music.  I inserted my coin and the thing didnt even work.  sighs.  

Overall, I wouldn't come here or it would never be the first place I would get a burger at."}
{"text":"The other day my friend and I went out to this Johnny Rockets location. Anyways I ordered the Smoke house burger, and let me tell you, not ONLY did I receive amazing service by my waitress Jazmin, but the burger was to die for! I asked for my burger well done and it was made the way I wanted, the bacon was perfectly crisp! I never waited more than a minute for my refill, and the dancing was amusing and fun! And to top that off the French fries are unlimited!!! The Johnny Rockets at Arizona mills mall is probably the only one I will ever return to, thank you to all the awesome employees!"}
{"text":"We only went here because we had a buy one get one coupon and my husband likes Johnny Rocket's (he insisted we eat at the one on our cruise ship!). 
It's been a while since we've eaten at one on land, it's gotten really expensive for a sit down \"fast food\" type burger. Service was quick but there were only a few other people eating. The burgers were nothing special, skinny fast food type burgers, lots of topping, bun is thick and fresh. Our fries were crisp, not greasy. The onion rings were kind of gross though, not sure if they were over fried or old, the dipping sauce it came with had no taste. Chocolate shake was thick and tasty.
With all the burger places around, I wouldn't go back. Not even with a coupon. Totally not worth it."}
{"text":"I ate here after shark reef and got terribly sick and had to go back to my room...very pricey for not a huge menu"}

{"text":"This place was a pretty good place to grab a burger but they just went a la carte and now everything not only is sold separately but it all received a price hike. 
If you want a good burger stick to In and Out or take the drive and go to Fuddruckers"}
{"text":"When we were waiting to be seated, several employees walked right by us and never even acknowledged us or say they would be with us shortly. And then once we were seated we did not receive good personal attention. We received cold fries and one of our meals was incorrect.  To top it off the shake had a funny taste, something like burnt roasted marshmallows. Needless to say we will not be returning."}
{"text":"Thomas! The bomb dot com! Tell him we sent you! Fast and friendly service! Food is great, but we were hammered!"}
{"text":"We live close to the Meadows Mall and got a Groupon.  We had not been to a Johnny Rockets since we went to one in So. Cal. many many years ago.  We tried to keep it near the $12 Groupon which was very difficult as the prices aren't cheap.  Ended up splitting a single burger, fry and large drink and still went over a buck ad a half.  Burger was very good, not overlooked.  Fries were o.k., a tad limp.  Free refill on the drink was nice. Lot's of competition out there in this price range, or cheaper.  Probably won't go back unless we can snag another Groupon."}

AFTER READING REVIEWS, I AM GLAD WE PASSED."}

{"text":"Food is pretty good, old diner type...love the burgers and sandwiches. Please stop making the crew dance! They dislike it, it slows down the service, and it's not enjoyable to watch when you KNOW the crew dislikes performing. Focus of what you do best, burgers, sandwiches, shakes, etc..."}
{"text":"This Johnny Rockets restaurant is located in the Venetian Hotel and Casino's Food Court and Mall area.

I have always been a fan of the Johnny Rockets themed restaurants. Although this restaurant is different in one way only, you can only order TO GO or sit at the counter and get served by the pleasant wait staff. One thing that should be noted that if you sit up at the counter, you will always visible by any and all the wait staff....kinda' nice!

I would imagine if this restaurant were to get busy, you may get frustrated with how long the wait can get.  But I think you can rest assured that the quality of the food is the same as with the other Johnny Rockets restaurants.

During my visit to this restaurant, there were many seats available to sit at....the wait staff was quick to say hello and take our drink orders.  I ordered the Patty Melt with Onion Rings and Iced Tea...my food was up to par with other Johnny Rockets restaurants.  The food and service was excellent!

My bill came out to almost $16 with tip, which I believe is slightly higher than normal. This Johnny Rockets restaurant's higher pricing is probably due to the location at the Venetian.  But it is nice to know that the quality is the same from each of their different locations.

Four Yelp Stars!  ;-p"}
{"text":"I was VERY disappointed in this place.  50 bucks for 2 grilled cheese, 1 BLT,  1 burger a chili cheese fry and side order of onion rings and French fries.  I could have went to IHOP and paid 30 bucks for that!  The French fries should be included in the price of the sandwich!  Will never go there again!"}
{"text":"My friend Paul and I decided to check out Johnny Rockets yesterday before we went to see \"Clash of the Titans\".  What a neat place!

It's patterned after the old fashion soda shops.  Long counters, lots of space and great, friendly people.  

I had the Chili Cheese Dog, fries and an ice tea.  Tea was fresh, fries were awesome and the chilli cheese dog was fabulous.  The prices were right in line to other restraunts like it.  I can't wait to visit again..."}
{"text":"Horrible, will not go back! This was our first time here since they changed from the original Johnny Rockets. It's a poor copycat version of Five Guys/Smash Burger. The cost per person for a double burger (frozen patties) with cheese was over $8. This included these skinny lil French fries.  If they want to charge gourmet burger prices they need to have quality food! The burgers at Five Guys, Smashburger and Culvers are much better. They also need some quality fries, not shoe strings. The new atmosphere.... has no character at all, the old theme was enjoyed many. The old fashioned diner theme is hot right now so I don't understand this change. We won't be back!"}
{"text":"Went for an event and it was amazing!!! The service was impeccable. Maritza, Gabby, Kelly and Christopher went above and beyond and exceeded my expectations.  The food was great as well. I wish I could have eaten more but I was stuffed lol."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a good late night meal after drinking go ahead and grab a bite to eat. This place reaks of fried greasy food but it hits the spot."}
{"text":"Cheap food, but you get what you pay for. The Spicy Houston burger was underwhelming and had sauce that was watered down and dripping everywhere. Waiters should definitely ask if the table wants a second plate of \"unlimited\" fries (especially when the first portion was served on the side of a plate with a burger) before bringing the check out.

I'd rather just go to in-n-out."}
{"text":"The last time I'd gone to one of these was when I was in college...so I was a little curious to see how it was now.

I ordered a patty melt and onion rings.  My other party member tried the cheeseburger, fries, and strawberry shake.

The patty melt was greasy...but not more than you'd get other places.  It was decent, a little large.  I could only eat half.  I'd rather they had put American cheese instead of Cheddar... The fries weren't very tasty either, and they forgot the cheese in the cheeseburger (uh...main ingredient.)...

So why four stars?

The onion rings were scrumptious!  Crunchy and great flavor...and it came piping hot.  The shakes are so insanely creamy good.  The service was really good too.  When the waitress was told we were in a rush to go see a movie, she hustled.  The staff picks a song at random and starts to dance in the middle of the dining area....pretty amusing.  It beats the loud off tone happy birthday singing, for sure!

The specialties are the shakes and malts.  Lots of flavors to choose from, and the only one that I'd have reservations about trying would be the apple pie shake.  Something about it just sounds....wrong.  I'm picturing slurping a piece of pie into my mouth?  Ew.

It just a generally upbeat typical chain 50's type diner.  It probably helped that there weren't too many customers in the place.

Just thinking about it makes me want a milkshake."}
{"text":"How do you like your French Fries? 

 Frozen solid.  This the place for you. We told the supervisor who said, yeah that happens sometimes.  No discount.  No new fries.  
 
Milk shakes that taste like frost bite ice cream?  Come and get it!

Service that is short, fast, and runs away before you can think about the lack of napkins and silverware?  Oh yeah that's this.   

Johnny  Rockets used to be fun with singing servers, fresh tasting food, a great customer service.  I miss that... a lot. 

But the kids liked it some."}
{"text":"\"This was the most unprofessional restaurant I've ever eaten in.... While we were eating, the servers were also eating. Like actually had whole plates of food in front of them while their tables ate. The customer service was just terrible. All of the employees, from the hostess to the supervisor, were in bad moods. My boyfriend's food was burnt and my burger was so greasy that I couldn't keep it together. Not a fan of this place.....\""}
{"text":"Fun place ...Good food...nice staff...good music...good hamburgers and fries and shakes:)"}
{"text":"Last fall I had a terrible experience as a customer at the arrowhead location. This resulted in me sending a complaint to the corporate website and receiving a voucher for my whole family to eat a free meal at Johnny Rockets. The vouchers stayed on my fridge until earlier this evening, when I finally decided to use them at the Westgate location. 
   Our family of four walked into the location and they were fairly busy and looked a little understaffed on the server end. However, I was promptly seated and was given a chance to put in our drink orders almost immediately. I asked if there was a problem using my voucher to pay for the meal and our server named Julian said it was quite alright and he would double check just to be sure. By the way, Julian was an amazing server with a fantastic attitude and hustle and speed to match.
 All in all I was blown away by everything in terms of speed and quality. The meal was fantastic, they allowed us to substitute milkshakes for the soft drinks free of charge, our drinks stayed full and Julian was easily the best server I've encountered at ANY restaurant I've eaten at in the past year. He was courteous, had a professional demeanor, and most of all seemed to genuinely care about our experience there. He tried to say I will pay absolutely zero for the meal and to just leave when I felt like it, but I insisted he charge me for one of the sodas just so I could leave him a 22% tip. 
  Whoever is the manager of this location, please note you have a class act with Julian. HE is a valuable asset to this location. My family and I WILL return in the near future. A+ all around."}
{"text":"I live in California and decided to go to this Johnny Rockets before going to the AMC Westgate. The young girl who waited on us was fantastic, the place was clean and the food was great. HOWEVER, while waiting for our food I noticed a male server (with neck tattoos---for identification purposes) stashing his check tender (that folder thing they put your check in) he stashed it in the back....DOWN HIS PANTS. I mean come on, he put it down his pants INTO HIS BUTT CRACK.....ugh! So disgusting... In his butt crack then giving it to his customers for them to handle it to pay their check....UGH!!!... Disgusting and I'm sure against the Health Dept health standards..."}
{"text":"We wanted to grab a quick bite to eat before we gambled and decided to come here. Service was good, but it took longer than usual, imo, to get our food, but it was because they were a little busy

I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak and it was quite small, nothing too special, a little overpriced for what you get.  Fries were OK, I didn't care for it too much.

I noticed they forgot to sweep under the table (we sat at a booth), and I saw food and trash under the table."}
{"text":"Today was my sons 1st birthday.  My wife wanted to take him down towards the mall so we could go to Toys R Us as well as a couple of other stops within the mall.  We decided to have lunch here at Johnny Rockets.  It was my first time eating at this establishment and I came away mostly impressed.  Back story has it that Johnny Rockets was modeled after The Apple Pan.  Apple Pan is pretty delicious and I have been to it a few times in LA.  If Johnny Rockets could come close to Apple Pan, I would be happy.  For the most part it did.  Here is what we ordered....................

I went with a Smoke House Double, my wife went with The Original, we split 1/2 rings & 1/2 fries and had water and a root beer to drink.  Here is how everything tasted.............

Smoke House Double-  This burger was large and in charge!  It is a double patty (1/3lb patties) burger topped with cheese, bacon, onion rings and bbq/ranch sauce.  This is served on a nice soft bun. Kind of like a Western Bacon Cheeseburger.  The patties were juicy and cooked fresh.  The onion rings were a good addition and gave it a little crunch.  The bacon was plentiful and tasty and the cheese was melted perfectly.  The only thing I did not really care for was the bbq/ranch sauce.  I could barely detect it and didn't really add anything to the burger.  Maybe made it a bit more moist?  Maybe?  I could have done without it or gone with just straight bbq sauce instead...and way more than what they put on here.  Overall it was a hefty solid burger though and I would get it again.

The Original-  My wife really liked it.  I didn't get a bite of it, but it looked good.

1/2 Fries & 1/2 Rings-  This was a good way to sample both their side items.  The fries and rings were kind of plain jane though.  Tasty enough, but not really great.  I would probably pick the onion rings next time over the fries since the onion rings tasted better and were more crunchy and solid than the fries.

Service was good for the most part.  We had a server from San Diego which was cool...we chatted it up about SD for a minute or so.  The place was a little busy though and I think he was swamped.  We didn't get a refill on our drink until he brought our check over.  He did give us a drink in a to go cup though which made up for the lack of refill earlier.  Total for everything including tip was around $26.00.  Not super cheap but not incredibly expensive either...I thought the price was fair for the food we got.  

Overall its probably 3 stars for the food itself but an extra star for the vibe of the place (cool 50's style, great oldies music, comfortable booths etc), the friendly service and the good time that we had!  I would come back...not sure how soon, and I don't think I would come down here intentionally to come here but if I was close by and hungry, I wouldn't hesitate to come back!"}
{"text":"Overpriced for what you get, but a nice diner experience in a clean environment. Between the two of us we got a double-decker burger with bacon, a grilled cheese sandwich, fries for both of us, and pop for both of us.  It was $23! Ridiculous. The burger was good, the grilled cheese was rather pedestrian, and the fries were standard-issue. It's a \"safe\" place to go if you don't mind the prices."}
{"text":"First time eating at Johnny rockets. Food is pretty good but a little pricey. Sherri is what made this review 5 stars. Better customer service than some dine in restaurant."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, didn't see our waitress much.  They offer unlimited regular fries but not sweet potato even though we paid extra for it.  The cook did everything with the same pair of gloves...never changed them.  We watched him clean the prep table and flattop, cook, sneak a peak at his phone.  Kind of gross.  There were always a group of workers chatting."}
{"text":"Anna was our server. Very nice girl. However, I sensed an unwelcoming feeling since we walked in. This was from other servers there. It was strange. 

The food was satisfying. I was done for the whole day. The meat I've found it could use some seasoning to it like garlic or pepper, it doesn't matter it had no taste to it. Very minimal like it was only there to be there and that was all. The rest was very nicely made. The service in pace was average. Not too slow, not too fast either.

When I got the check it was $24.78 which also is very fair. But then I noticed the other servers looking to our table like they wanted us out. Which by the way we weren't taking long. 

I'd be back only for take out. As long as I don't see those other workers there again I don't have to come in and eat there, so force fully."}
{"text":"So this is my first time at this location. Me and my handsome other stopped by here on Superbowl day at about 3:30 or so. I just got the classic burger and he got a double something or another with pepper jack and bacon. They misheard his order since he said no onion but they thought he said he wanted onion rings so they made his a combo. Upon realizing that he had spoken too fast they corrected the burger and I ended up eating the onion rings and they brought him an order of fries  to make up for the mess up. He also ordered a shake later on. The burgers were both amazing and the onion rings and fries were both the perfect amount of crispy. The only thing that I did not really like is the fact it was about $20 for the meal. Which to me is too much to pay at a fast food restaraunt for a basic burger and a more complex burger meal."}
{"text":"This is my 1st time being here and it was very clean and the management were very friendly people I definally recommended this place if your looking for somewhere to chill and eat a juicy hamburger. Go Johnny Rockets!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy bringing the kids here because they love picking out songs to play on the juke box. The food is good and we enjoy ordering flavored sodas as a treat. The staff is usually super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"We've bypassed  this place several times when we've gone to Vegas...always opting for the food court in Fashion Show.  We decided eh...let's just try it...especially because I wasn't done shopping on that particular side of the mall.

First...yeah..I'd have to agree with previous reviews of the service.  It's not the worst...but definitely needs some help in that area.  

I ordered the Texas Toast Chicken Sandwich (I don't know what it's called on the menu).  It was really good...I upgraded my fries to chili/cheese.  I didn't care for the chili...kinda tasted like Hormel canned chili.

The chocolate shake was yum and well presented.  I will definitely eat here again the next time we go to Vegas."}
{"text":"The place was pretty empty to be lunch time. The girl that greeted us and placed our order was very nice and prompt her name was Daisy.  The problem I had was where we sat was in direct view of where they cooked the food and I was glad for that. So the guy that cooking the get was standing there like he didn't want to be there. I happened to glance up and he was running his hands through his hair while cooking. I was immediately disgusted! I wait to see if he would wash them he walking around a bit and then started touching food containing and mak8ng orders. I called the waitress over to ask her who he was and come to find out he was the manager! I was so pissed. I told her that he had  ran his fingers in his hair without washing his hands and how nasty that was. She went over and whispered something to him. She came back to my table I told her I don't want him making my food. He walked to the back and did something. Did not once come and apologize or anything.  I still never saw him was his hands and there was a sink right in front. The rest of my stay he was givug me dirty looks. I was very uncomfortable and the food was not all that great. The lemonade was watered down. I do not recommended this locations. I will not we eat here again. Disgusting nasty people that are unsanitary."}
{"text":"Johnny Rockets... like McDonalds and Denny's, you can count on it being the same no matter where you are.  I think it's a little overpriced for the quality of food, and sometimes the service is a bit on the light side, but the 50s atmosphere and the consistent menu is why I count on them being them."}
{"text":"Ridiculously disgusting. So oily it was falling apart as soon as I got it. I could've gave the oil to chicken now in the mall next to this place to fry their chicken with. I don't get how people who live here think this is good when u can go to the strip and get steak for the same price. Way too expensive and disgusting quality. I didn't even eat half my burger."}
{"text":"Johnny Rockets is a chain restaurant that is modeled after the 50s style jukebox days. They have the old fashioned record player selection at each table and at the counter so you can select what you want to hear. No cost to it but no guarantee either that the song you picked might be played. Occasionally, some of the staff will come out and do a \"dance' to a classic tune.

It is air conditioned to get out of the heat. My daughter and I were seated at the counter. She ordered a foot long with chili and cheese. I settled for a chicken salad. Service was a bit slow but they were quick to bring it out when ready. My daughter enjoyed her meal because she was hungry. I found that my chicken was a bit tough and the greens it sat on pretty much the same way. Normally i would have sent it back but since we wanted to enjoy the park I ate it. They do specialize in shakes and floats but we didn't have the time for them.

On the plus side service was good and our waitress attentive. I did find if you look around the perimeter around the the ceiling you will find various pictures of Kennywood in yesteryears."}
{"text":"This Johnny Rockets was inside the MGM Grand food court.  It is not a regular sit down restaurant like some of their other locations.  The food was just okay and definitely not what you can get at their sit down locations.  I ordered the hamburger combo which came with fries and a soda.  They also had a tater tots on the menu but you could not substitute them for the fries which is lame.  The burger was a bit boring, nothing like a regular Johnny Rockets burger.  Fries were crisp and flavorful.  The food did take quite a long time to be prepared even though they were not that busy.  Overall this was just okay.  Not great but not terrible.  I probably will not come back to this location."}

{"text":"Don't know if I'll eat there again. Had the Philly cheese steak for $8.64. Extremely salty. Could not enjoy it was so salty. Lettuce and tomato was xtra."}
{"text":"I've been to Johnny Rockets in California, DC, Maryland, and St. Louis. The Kennywood location is, by far, the worst I've ever experienced. It doesn't even deserve the Johnny Rockets name. We went to Johnny Rockets at Kennywood yesterday even though I'd had a pretty rotten experience there last year. All I wanted was their delicious fries and I really hyped the place up to our friends. 

Unfortunately, no one thought it necessary to tell us that Johnny Rockets wasn't really serving Johnny Rockets' food. As soon as they brought the fries, I knew they weren't the same. In fact, they were a soggy, disgusting mess. The chicken my daughter and our friends got didn't look much better. 

An employee - perhaps a manager? - came over and asked how we liked our food. I asked if they had changed their fries. He said they did and I told him that the new fries basically ruined Johnny Rockets. He then admitted that one of the employees forgot to order the fries and the chicken several days earlier so they were serving Kennywood's fries and chicken (not nearly as good at JR's and at an inflated price). The employee laughed off my complaints and said, \"thanks for your critique.\"

If you want the real Johnny Rockets experience, avoid the Kennywood location. The menu is extremely limited. The prices are double or triple what they are in other locations. And, you don't even know if you're getting real Johnny Rockets food and not some disgusting substitute. I feel bad for those who visited Johnny Rockets for the first time yesterday because they were duped into thinking they were paying for Johnny Rockets food and instead were served park fare."}
{"text":"Huge burgers, very tasty. Perfect when you are hungry in the middle of the night. My order was ready in less than 5 mins and everyone there was super nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Pretty simple...Food was awful, waiting 45 minutes for a chicken club and chicken tenders with nobody in restaurant is a little crazy. Combine that with dirt everywhere and workers with horrid attitudes and you have this Johnny Rockets. Definitely come and visit if you feel like dropping $50 and leaving with a stomach ache."}
{"text":"I ate here on consecutive late nights on a recent trip to Vegas with the guys and let me tell you that Johnny Rockets with their burgers and tater tots are a life saver when you're wandering the casino looking for something to eat after a club. Ha! 

I either got the single patty bacon cheddar or the double. That comes with  apple wood smoked bacon, Wisconsin cheddar and lettuce. No onions or tomatoes for me. It was good, it was greasy... It was just what the doctor ordered after a night on the town. It was quite tasty.

The older lady that rang me up both times was friendly despite all the late-night revelers ordering at that hour. 

Located in the MGM food court. Open LATE."}
{"text":"Ridiculously overpriced for a tiny amount of food. Staff and service was ok. 

I understand the classic diner, 50s theme - but it wouldn't hurt to update the atmosphere. The floors, tables and chairs looked dingy and dirty. 

If you ever want a good burger, go upstairs to Jack Astors."}
{"text":"My burger was not hot, just room temp. They left out the onion rings that were SUPPOSED to be on the burger. I had to ask twice to get them"}
{"text":"Love this place. It's good that no matter which location you go to, it tastes the same. We are from CA. However, the employees in CA, don't sing and dance. LOVE IT!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be great, a little expensive but great. Now it's still expensive and has really gone down hill. I ordered my food and was told their soda machine was broken. They let me know I could order a shake... but they were out of flavors. I then had to wait 20min for my food. Plus the staff was super rude (that came free) plus the food was just not good.id think  twice before going there."}
{"text":"SLLLLOOOOOOWWWWWW busy place on a busy weekend with two people working food and one working register. Sat at the counter took a few min to take my order others got up from counter and stood in line. Idk if someone called in, or others were on their break/lunch. But severely understaffed and it shows. Poor guy running register sweating and doing his best to keep up.  
One more guy just showed up did check one half of counter to see if had been helped yet but bypassed the other half after clocking in or back in. Hopefully things speed up a bit. Others walking away from ordering because the line. 
Food arrived about 5 min after I got my float and it was as expected. Seems rush is over or it was break time when I arrived. Guy apologized for not being able to hit chat, which makes this an ok visit. I understand he was busy."}
{"text":"The food is the same, but the retro experience I love is lost at this location. It's not sit and serve; it's pay, sit, serve. It's closer to a Smash Burger experience than a true JRockets :("}
{"text":"What a fun time we had at Johnny Rockets. The old time malt shop feel is great and the shakes are amazing. We really enjoyed the burgers and fries and I especially like the crisp sweet potato fries. The management staff was very attentive and friendly and the prices were super reasonable especially considering the location in Westgate. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this place was one girl working there Desiree. She wa since friendly and attentive. We ordered 2 blts 2 fries and 2 shakes to go. The shakes were about 8 bucks a piece. I love Johnny Rockets in la so I thought this was a good choice to go too, boy I was wrong. We received our food and our shakes were forgotten about. So I politely asked about our shakes they said sorry and stared to make them. Okay fine I understand that. Finally after about 15 mins we get our shakes. I wanted a dark chocolate malt and my cousin a peanut butter. Mine tasted just like vanilla, no chocolate, no malt. Hers was better but still not great. We were staying at that hotel so we decided to order to go and take the food up. We got to the room which only took 5 mins from the restaurant. And our fries were brown and hard and cold. Of course I expected this because they made our shakes AFTER our food was made and given to us. All in all a waste of 50.00 didn't eat any of it!"}
{"text":"Negative stars.. Just ate half a moldy burger and they offered to make me a new one.. No thank you. Never again."}
{"text":"So I never had this place burgers until last week.  I'm at a mehhh... as far as the overall taste of everything.  The Burger was good (Just good) but for $12.95 I would expect the burger to be a knock out.  The fries weren't good at all.  I mean I thought McDonalds fries were better than these fries.  Soggy and greasy potato sticks would be a better description.  Of course my large soda was $3.95.  I'm sorry that movie theater prices.  For the mehhh food and the Super price thats why I gave this place 3 stars.  I don't understand why its so expensive here.  The place itself is in the Excalibur hotel.  You see all kinds of bleacher creature tourist in that place.  The line was pretty long the whole time.  After I ordered I had to wait about 10 minutes for the food to be done.  They give you a pager with a number on it.  The dining part is pretty big.  I would think it fits 100 people at least.  The food was ight...  But from looks alone the milkshakes looked like the best thing here.  Maybe I'll go back for a milkshake next time."}
{"text":"A quick lunch before hitting the road. Located in the food court in the Venetian.   Pretty much chose the place since they had a counter with waiter service. No self service. 

The chicken fingers were really really good. And my BLT was totally loaded with bacon. 

Our server was attentive yet kept his distance."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it zero. Limited menu because of a \"special event.\" Though they certainly weren't busy enough to warrant it. Food was disgusting. Watching employees break health code regulations over and over kind of makes your stomach turn. Server Barbara was rude to say the least. It's not hard to be polite but apparently for her it is. Entire experience was bad. I mean, what the hell is with the flashing lights when they dance? Don't eat here unless you want shitty service and food poisoning."}
{"text":"Hugely surprised.  I've eaten at a Johnny Rockets in Maryland and it was nasty, this one, to my surprise is quite good.  Just had a basic burger and my son has waffle with strawberries.  Even he commented that the food was better than the Guy Fieri Mexican place we eat at earlier in Rio (that was not good).

So I can't believe I'm saying this, but tonight Johnny Rockets beat out Guy Fieri's place by a mile."}
{"text":"This location is a lot cheaper than the ones at the malls. Everything was pretty much the same, minus the metal cup your extra milkshake comes in at the other locations; just better prices."}
{"text":"The guy running the to go register was more interested in flirting with a girl that just sat down than taking my order. Heard him say \"Don't worry, I'll pay for it\" while I'd been standing there for 5 minutes waiting for him to take my order. The great thing is that we even made eye contact several times... We left without any of the employees saying a word to us"}
{"text":"The service here is outstanding- the best service I've had in Vegas. Thomas was our server at the bar and he was incredible. Nice, attentive, quick, and efficient. Another woman at the bar was so happy with the service she spoke to the manager. The food is good- classic Johnny Rockets burgers and fries. The shake was really good. No more malts, but Thomas recommended ghiradelli for those. Eat here and get five star service from a fast casual chain burger joint."}
{"text":"The cookies and cream shake for $6 is a rip off. They sprinkle cookie crumbs in the bottom the cup, and some soft serve. What a joke, the finished product looks nothing like the photo that entices you to come in."}
{"text":"I purchased a groupon thinking it was a good deal. Boy was i wrong. We didnt wait a whole long like the other reviews.  We waited like ten minutes for our food, which isn't bad. Our waitress was super nice. We recieved super good service. Our food on the other hand was disgusting.  I had the wings and fries. My wings tasted like they were frezzer burnt. That's all I tasted. My husband had a burger, it was disgusting.  No seasoning, no flavor, bread all bad! We couldnt even finish half our food. Beware."}
{"text":"After four days of going to restaurants, it was nice getting a quick straightforward breakfast without having to be waited upon.  The omelet  was good, fresh made and a big portion size.  Will definitely stop back here if I'm staying at the Venetian and need a quick breakfast without all the wait."}
{"text":"We are still on the search for the great milkshake, tasty burger and yummy fries.  I have to admit they have the best cherry coke in town and I love the tiny pieces of ice.  I had the turkey burger, it was okay.  My husband had the vegeterian patty.  He said it was just okay, pretty dry.  He asked for their special sauce and they didn't put it on.  My daughter liked the milkshake, she didn't say it was delish tho.  The fries were thick which is good, but no flavor, which is bad."}
{"text":"Stayed at the hotel this previous week, and pretty much had Johnny Rockets at night while gambling and also stopped here for breakfast.  The staff is super friendly. and the food is great.  I didnt know Johnny Rockets served breakfast, in the morning after gambling i had pancakes and scrambled eggs with american cheese.  So Good!!!"}
{"text":"It's okay for a fast food burger place on-the-go."}
{"text":"Walked in for lunch on the weekend and it was not busy at all. Maybe 5 tables at most. Staff greeted us right away, there were about 3 servers and the cooks. Our server was nice and attentive. Came over to check on us at just the right times, refilled my husbands soda. 

Food came in a timely manner and was cooked perfect. Burgers were just as expected and fries and tots were crispy just the way we like it. They did not skimp on the cheese either. 

Great experience for a Johnny Rockets and cute diner theme. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this is a Johnny Rockets Express...they usually have one person working the grill and one person working the register during the lunch rush. One time I waited 25 minutes for a veggie burger and fries. 

The quality is so-so...still a good lunch spot when you go after the lunch rush. I work right across the street at AMEX and they give me 10% off, which is nice. 

The employees are usually super nice and get the order right for the most part."}
{"text":"I'm from California and love the John Rockets the fries and onion rings are always hot and fresh the burger is nicely put together and the milk shakes perfect. So when I was visiting my grandkids in Chandler AZ I couldn't wait to take them there wow what a disappointment we went to the San Tran mall location and everything about it was bad it did not seem clean our waiter looked like he was sleep walking the fries and onion rings were cold and stale the lettuce on the burger was wilted they were stingy on the expensive milk shake portions what a disappointment"}
{"text":"Fast and friendly retro burger counter service, food cooked to order. Plenty of options. Would go back again.

Lots of seating. Great before a show, or during a break from the Strip."}
{"text":"Not satisfying.  This meal was pricey and not filling.  It's just slightly better than licks in terms of taste.  They are way understaffed at this location and we were overcharged on the bill.  Dirty tables were not cleaned at all for the whole time we were there. Burger meat crumbs on the table when we were seated.  They need more staff on weekends.  Definitely a one time thing. And don't bother putting money for the table side juke box. I was there for 45 mins and song never came on. Just eats your money"}
{"text":"JR takes mediocrity to the next level.
I came here because I have good memories from when I was a kid. I know JR is basically overpriced fast food, but I was still shocked at the poor quality.
$15 will get you an overcooked burger in an untoastdd bun (they don't ask you how you want it cooked), cold fries, and a shake in a plastic cup (why!) 
If you don't have kids and you're not stuck at an airport or something where it's your only option, I don't see why the hell you would come here. Go to red robin instead."}
{"text":"Sweet staff! Fast service! But dear lord don't eat the chicken wings they r so over crusted  and although they r thoroughly cooked they are almost rubbery u can't chew them at all. Sadly I won't be back the food I ate there today just went right through me !"}
{"text":"Kind of disappointing for a johnny rockets. French fries were cold and they've changed to a different type. Not up to expectations"}
{"text":"$13 95 for a hamburger? Nothing worth raving about but the prices. Come on... A $7 shake. Yes, I ate here. It's a burger joint, but so is Carls Jr. at a fraction of the price. It's at the same level unfortunately for Rockets but good news for Carls I suppose. $13.95??? Ouch!!! As for the service, strong A. Nothing but good things to say even though they messed up our order twice. It happens."}
{"text":"I don't get these bad reviews. I love this place so much, and I can relate to these workers because I'm also a server and really young. Service in all honesty is great, they really do go above and beyond, and they will find the answer to your questions even if they don't know it. I had a Oreo milkshake, a cheeseburger, and cheese fries with bacon... I know unhealthy, but I was celebrating being 21 and didn't care about my health that day lol"}
{"text":"Don't get the Route 66 burger... probably one of the saltiest things I've ever eaten. I guess this is just Vegas, but it was also like $9 for just the small burger itself--fries and drink are separate.

Lastly, I came around 12pm on a Monday and was the only one in line, but it took about 15 minutes to get our food. Terrible service."}
{"text":"The waiter Tom was a great guy and that was it. We waited for 20 minutes to be seated, then were ordered. So far all okay but here we go, it took over 35 minutes to get our food and during this time the table in front of us asked to get it Togo as they had too long of a wait. While this was happening the table behind us asked the waiter where they food was at. During this we could see the massive miscommunication going on and the lack of training with all of their staff. The table behind us finally got their food but they forgot the salads that were supposed to come before the food. The table declined the salad since the food was already there. Johnnys took it off their bill but it again took a while to get the bill. Okay my turn now again Tom was great but the manager lady is a joke. So, there was so much of a back up in the kitchen the manager decided to interfere and she obviously had no clue how to run a backed up line. So our food got delivered well 75% of it anyway. They forgot my wife's pattie melt they made sound like it was on its way. since we were sitting right next to the kitchen we over heard everything. Long story short another server took our food, they said they lost it and had to remake but they would take it off out bill. Another wait which by this point my food was cold. Well they didn't take it off our bill or even get a discount. To summarize most johnnys have great food but DONT GO TO THIS ONE. At least until this crew gets retrained."}
{"text":"My 1st time trying Johnny Rockets and wow! Visited this location while we were staying at Bally's hotel during spring break 2018 around 1am,Saturday night. They are open late which is extremely convenient. It is located inside Ballys food court by the pool. The wait is worth it. We did take out to eat upstairs in our room and food didn't get cold like other places. 
Staff is great as well. Nothing better than employees who care! The young lady who took my order suggested the strawberry shake and I was sure not disappointed! I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Johnny Rockets in the Flamingo Food Court has the advantage of drawing more customers by staying open late, & by employing young people with manners & helpful attitudes, regardless of location, in my experience.  

My Cheeseburger was fresh & juicy, though Vegas-pricey.  JR's has really good Fries, & the Hot Fudge Shake was absolutely sinful 

A quick satisfying Lunch that lasted the few hours until Dinner."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to try Johnny Rockets for a change. We walked in and were seatrd by a waiter, that was the last we seen of him. After waiting for about 20 minutes for a waiter to come to our table, I decided to grab the 2 available menus and plan our order. This place was not very busy, so there is no excuse for a staff member to acknowledge us. After finally getting fed up with no service, I walked up to the manager and told him we have not been waited on after 30 minutes, he said nothing to me and walked over to one of the waiters and told him to wait on us. The waiter seemed highly irritated and was very short with us, only doing the bare essentials. He made it clear to us  that we were not his table.

Our food came out fairly quickly, but the fries were stale and warm. We were never asked if we wanted more of our \"never ending fries\" or drink refills.

IF  you want some good advise, head over to the nearest In N Out were you always get great service, great meal at half the price of Johnny Rockets."}
{"text":"The food was a little greasy but it was good and filling. The kids had a good time.  The waiters danced and attended all the tables even though the place was packed.  A little high priced but the kids meals were decent priced and we'll proportioned."}
{"text":"Expensive burgers, delivered in a paper bag thrown on your table by a surly uncommunicative young man who didn't bring the rest of the order. Had to go to counter to ask after the drinks. Discovered the burger was stone cold and returned it to total confusion of eight children behind the counter. Stood there waiting for new burger which was barely recognizable as the type I ordered. What a crappy experience. Just because we adults at a kid park doesn't mean we want crappy food and surly service. I hope you review training procedures with these staff, particularly the kid bringing out the food -- and why aren't we given plates when we eat in the restaurant??"}
{"text":"I ordered a shake here while a friend was eating his lunch.  I wasn't too hungry.

The shake... meh.

I got a straw to drink my shake.  Bad idea.  I went back for a spoon.  Bad idea.  There comes the dilemna... spoon or straw?

The shake itself was pretty much one note.  Butterfinger, butterfinger, butterfinger.  I got pretty sick of it after a whie.  Too much sucking for me.  I don't do the sucking in Vegas man, I just don't."}
{"text":"I went here because it's about a half mile from my house and next to my fiancée work so I walked there in 100 degree weather and told the cashier and other employees I'm picking up dinner for myself and my fiancée and she wanted a Milk shake and they instantly gave me the milkshake while I waited almost 45 minutes for the the food and it was melted as they were bagged together although they ran my credit card was ran twice because I wanted them separate she hands the burgers back to the cook and they opened them back up to and dissected and ended up all over the bag because they were thrown in like my bag it was a garbage can or something appearntly because the wrapper was sitting in there like a wet napkin and they still couldn't get the burgers correct and mind you I'd totally understand but the Houston burger has jalapeño so that would be a dead give away but as this complaint is going on going and on and I never make resturaunt complaints but the icing on the cake is my burger was missing a patty and had tomatoes on it which is lovely because I spent 40 dollars and I'm alergic to tomatoes so instead of walking another mile to fix it I went with out dinner so thanks soo much for their horrible service and lack of communication from their staff staff never again.."}
{"text":"I love Johnny Rockets Route 66 its filled with mushrooms and swiss! i always get the strawberry banana shake! i do come her often and they are very quick and always are so fresh!"}
{"text":"Great turkey burger. I used the build your own burger option and it turned out great. We ordered the 1/2 fries and 1/2 onion rings and only got 5 onion rings. Pretty disappointing. Anyways, service was slow for it not being busy at all in there. It's conveniently located across from the Hardrock next to a lot of other eating choices. CVS next door is always a stop when in town."}
{"text":"The are WAY over priced, I know being on the Las Vegas Strip things are little high, but this was inside the Fashion Show Mall, our bill was over $45.00 and we just got soda and burgers. I mean seriously a fast food place like this really needing to gouge people. I wont go back to this location again, the service was good it was dead in there but the food is overpriced for what you get..."}
{"text":"I used to johny rockets all the time in California and their burgers are good. My bacon cheese burger was good but this location in the fashion show mall is wayyyyy overpriced $$$ and the dining area is located next to a loud ass Kids play area with children screaming and yelling during your meal."}
{"text":"Sucked worst service ever, no attention to detail snail paced and the kitchen is serving undercooked chicken pink in the middle gross! Ill never take the kids back there..."}
{"text":"Good service, not so good food.  My wife and I split the Philly Loaded Street Tots and a Smokehouse burger.  For $9.50, the burger was small and not really anything special.  The tots ($10.50) were a good concept spoiled by over-salting.  And $3 for soda. Way overpriced for what we got.  Next time I will just go with my gut and go to 5 Guys it Habit.  Or just wait until we go to the theater next door and have movie theater popcorn for dinner."}
{"text":"Went in because all other Dundas Sq. restos were jammed while this was almost empty. Now I know why. Bad food, with horrible iceberg salad on the side. Served by the most  alienated indifferent waitress I've ever experienced. Even though it was empty, service was slow. 50s music was great, though"}
{"text":"Johnny Rocket's is a mix between a 5&Diner and an In and Out Burger with a dash of Ed Debevic's (May it rest in peace).  

Great burgers with good looking fresh ingredients.  Shakes that are out of this world.  But I've never seen one that wasn't in the mall. This particular location is in Arizona Mills and it's a pretty good sized location.  Not one of the largest ones, but it has counter and booth seating.  Though, like many other locations, during peak times you can expect to see a line forming outside.  We've stood in line before - just for a shake to go.  

At this mall one of the other advantages here is that this isn't a part of the official food court.  It's pretty much on the other side of the mall.  So if you're there and hunger strikes - you don't have to walk to the other side of the mall.  And in this mall, that could take you awhile - longer with kids, even longer with window shopping friends.  

By the way - they have Boca burgers and Turkey burgers.  You want an egg on it?  They can make that happen.  They also have other sandwiches - from a grilled cheese to a Philly.  I suggest ending it all with a Hot Fudge sundae.  

And after all that, you'll want to do a few laps of the mall just to breathe again of course.   So if you need to leave soon, make sure at least one person in your party has some restraint.  Let them get a salad.  The rest of you will be too deep in a food coma to be trusted behind the wheel."}
{"text":"The worst place ever, it's a seat yourself and we sat on the patio as there were dirty tables and no seating inside! We sat on the patio for 15 mins with other servers staring at us and not even approaching. It was a disaster and unorganized. I do not see this place lasting. I was a server for 3 years and would never think about treating customers as they did here. Will never come back even if I'm starving!"}
{"text":"Lack of management visibility. Dirty tables. Food sitting forever waiting on the staff to deliver. No one except Daisy wears their name badge. (Awesome job Daisy!!!) Food is fine but management is seriously lacking. This place needs and overhaul. It wouldn't take much to clean it up and step up the service. Good leadership would fix that. Whoever owns this place should really take a look at the folks running it on their behalf."}
{"text":"If you make it into the food line,be specific and know what you'd want. There are menu options and each order is cooked to order."}
{"text":"We only ordered snacks and not full meals. Place was very clean and service was great. I'll try the meals next time and see if they can get five stars."}
{"text":"Located within a small food court in the Flamingo Hotel. I got a BLT with bacon cheese fries and a vanilla milk shake. The shake was great! The fries were extra cheesy but a lot of the bacon pieces were burnt. So was the toast on my BLT (a bit darker than I like it even though I said lightly toasted). Wheat bread is available. The cheese fries were super messy. They don't provide any forks at the front unless you ask and there aren't any available at the napkin and condiment station and there should be. Even if you get your shake to stay you still get a to go cup. They give you a pager even for to go orders so you don't have to stand around. You can go play some slots or have a seat while you wait. There's tables and booths."}
{"text":"Gabe and I were carrying Mauricio back to the elevator when, suddenly, he jumped back to life. \"I gotta eat,\" he said, so we let him go. 

It's as if he were possessed. After all, how did he know where we were? How could he sense the foodcourt? Did he smell the food cooking?

Walking on his own two legs for the first time that night, Mauricio deliberated as the neon signs in the foodcourt harnessed his attention. He stumbled a little as he passed Pan-Asian Express, but it was the red 1950's style barstool that finally beckoned him.

\"Johnny Rockets,\" I thought to myself, \"gross.\"

Mauricio plopped down on a barstool and looked for a moment at the wonder that was almost mechanized behind the bar counter. Meat sizzling. Buns toasting. Frenches frying. \"My god,\" he thought to himself, \"this is a kitchen!\" He buried his face in his hands and took a deep breath. He lifted his head back up after what seemed to be an eternity. 

As quick as a shot Mauricio stood up, and painstakingly walked over to the cash register. Gabe and I stood close, but slightly out of sight. \"God this guy's fucked up,\" Gabe confided. \"I know,\" I hesitantly responded. I was embarrassed. I felt the blood rush to my face as men and women walked past us. \"Soon this will be over and we can get some sleep,\" I thought. But sleep didn't come soon enough.

The clock strikes. \"My god, it's 3am,\" I say to Gabe. We exchange a mutual look of disdain. Finally, Mauricio walks back to the bar stool and sits down with the same intensity as he had standing up. I look at him. He's tired. He buries his head in his hands again. Then I notice the stool.

The stool was bright red vinyl with a polished chrome stand. The kind that my mom must have told me about a million times. A round, backless seat that's connected to a cylindrical pole, which is then connected to the ground by means of 4 or 5 large bolts. The stool was certainly sturdy enough to support Mauricio during his stuper, but I wonder what it would take to break it. The vinyl was clean and looked new. It had the shine that new vinyl has. It was crease-less, and plump. \"They used to have matching benches like this in the 50's,\" I relished."}
{"text":"I am a burger snob and simply love their burgers and shakes. I brought my nieces and nephews for an old fashion All American lunch and had a great time. Our server was super friendly and the food was delish as always. Til the next time!"}
{"text":"Really bad service, crappy food that takes forever to get to your table, bathrooms were disgusting.

You have to get your own napkins and ask for silverware."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the 50's ambience and music.  Egg salad was excellent - Like the old days.  Manager was extremely nice - I think his name was Julian.  Going back soon.."}
{"text":"Because I haven't been thrilled with the hamburgers here, this time I sat at the counter and ordered a Patty Melt for lunch.  With a fairly plain but very good side salad with tomato pieces, fresh lettuce, Cheddar Cheese shavings, and Honey Mustard Dressing, it was a really good sandwich.  The medium well beef patty was hot and featured grilled onions and melted Cheddar Cheese on the buttered and grilled rye  And, I learned that a Vanilla Pepsi tastes almost as good as a Vanilla Coke--but not quite.  And there are free refills on Pepsi.  This was the best substantive food I have had here to date.  Only a shake (and in the past they have been very good) was missing.

On the negative side, a fly zipped around the open counter, and one cook and one shake maker were attired in filthy aprons.  When I tried to settle my bill and pay a server standing near the cash register, I was told to pay my server directly instead.  But she was engaged in other tasks, and I needed to leave right away.  Finally, Diane arrived from an eye exam and effected my release by giving me correct change, and I was able to place the payment and tip on the counter and leave. But I don't think I should have been delayed and horsed around in this manner by the restaurant staff."}
{"text":"Have to say based off the reviews (that I read after already eating and leaving) my service was completely different. My waitress Mel-I believe was polite always made sure we had refills, she brought enough napkins without me even asking for more which is my biggest pet peeve when you don't bring enough napkins. The burger  I had was the smokehouse cheddar bacon aka *mouth watering* it was cooked just right and huge slices of bacon (in my eyes) I have no complaints. In addition to my burger we had; chilli cheese fries and a hot dog kids meal. I also didn't know about their children eat free special which as a parent I felt like I hit the jackpot! I gave it 4 stars only because we were the only ones in there to service had it been busy I wonder if the service and demeanor would've been different."}
{"text":"We missed out on the family dinner (traffic in LV is terrible) so I ended up taking my two nephews to dinner at the hotel. I made them pick the restaurant and of course they picked Johnny Rockets. E me. Lol

It's a fast casual joint in Bally's food court. Go to the counter, place your order, pay and wait for the beeper to beep. Pick up your food and seat yourself. 

I got the The Original w/ Fried Egg. It's a good burger, very juicy. The fried egg was well, fried. Fried to death. lol. No yolk to add more creaminess. Skip the fried egg IMO. 

Smoke House w/ Mushroom. This is The Original with bacon and cheese. My nephew added mushroom to his burger. He liked it. 

The Rocket is an Original with cheese. A cheeseburger in other words. My nephew inhaled this burger. Lol. 

Fries were okay. But at almost $5 an order, you don't get much for your money. 

For drinks, two of us got the root beer float. It was really good. My other nephew got the strawberry & banana shake, he liked it. 

Price was on the high side. Dinner was over $70 for burger, shake & fries for 3. Yikes. 

It was a good dinner and I got to catch up with my two young nephews.  But I should have just taken them to McDonalds instead. I think they would have enjoyed it there as much as here and it would have been considerably cheaper, lmao!!"}
{"text":"Lunchtime on a weekday is pretty slow. Maybe 4 families in here. We got our drinks quick and my wife and daughter got shakes that were really good. The waitress was not busy but could not seem to find the time for refills. Not even when our food came. We had to get up and get them ourselves. The brisket tots were amazing and the smoke house burgers were great too. They have unlimited fries for $2 with meals so make sure you say unlimited and not small or large because those are $2/$3. Not sure how they perform when this place is full. All I can say is beware of coming here if this place is full and don't have a time limit. They are not speedy with the food. But the food is really good."}
{"text":"Great staff that's very friendly. With people like Hector, Ana that work this location makes it nice to see someone that always says hello and ask how you're doing today. The mangers are great people that will stop and talk to you other than asking the normal \"is everything ok.\"
Food is always great and is brought to you nice and hot.
If you like spicy food I recommend getting the Houston burger, it comes with pepper jack cheese and jalapeños. Just the right spice to it.
Stop in and enjoy the friendly atmosphere and the fresh hot food."}
{"text":"Staff could of been a little more friendly. Order and pay first than sit buzzer goes off get your food they will not bring it to you even if you are sitting at their counter. Don't get your drink until your food gets done unless you pay separate.  Took way to long to cook the burgers they were just okay not great especially for the price."}
{"text":"Came in before a concert on a Friday night. Around 6:30p. Didn't want to pay a lot for dinner due to Mandalay Bay being so busy with concerts and comedy shows this particular night. The whole food court was very slow. Chose johnny rockets for a quick bite. Cashier was not very friendly (Maritza). She wasn't friendly with other customers after myself while I was waiting for my food. Ordered the cheeseburger with fries. While sitting at the their seating area where you can see your food cooking, the cashier is telling an employee how to do a task. TELLING her co - worker. instead of SHOWING her. Very rude. When the co worker didn't do the task correctly, Maritza rolls her eyes and says\"that's not how you do it. Get the water from over there\". Stomps off to shows the employee where to get water for this particular machine. She slams a refrigerator door right in front of where I was sitting. It's not professional to treat other co workers rudely in front of customers. Needs work. Food was great. Good job grill man!"}
{"text":"Let me start with saying we walked out of this restaurant before receiving our food. When we arrived they had 4 tables filled out of roughly ten available. All of the booths without customers still had the leftover trash from the previous customers on them. We waited for them to clear a stable, in which they did not wipe down. It took about 5 minutes to receive menus. 5 additional minutes to receive our drinks. There were three of us and it was not a busy time. The sodas we got had no carbonation at all. It was syrup and water. We waited again for yet another 5 minutes and the waiter, Gabriel, took our order. That's where it became horrific. We didn't raise any concerns about the poor service to that point as I didn't want them to spit in my food. The other booths still had trash in them. A larger group had already gotten their food before us. It had been roughly 32 minutes and we decided to go to a different food restaurant, in which we had better soda and our food within 5 minutes of walking through the door. I wish I could give a zero star rating. Do not go here. It's unsanitary, unprofessional, and not worth waiting for. Especially not for an hour."}
{"text":"We stayed at the Excalibur during our 5 days in Vegas. As we walked in the hotel, we could smell Johnny Rockets burgers. The smell was fantastic! So we go in. I ordered a regular burger. I ordered a small drink. I was told they only had large. I said \"but you are advertising you have small.\" I was told, \"We only have large.\" Bad start. I whipped out my debit card. \"Can I see your I.D.?\" As  I hand it to her, I said why do you care?. No reply. I get my burger, drink and onion rings and sit down. I then notice a lot of customers have brought cups from the casino to get a drink without paying. Unless MGM resorts owns Johnny Rockets this is stealing. The entire meal was awful. How do I know it was awful? I took 3 dumps within an hour and a half of eating it. So Johnny Rockets can suck it!!!! I would have asked for my money back but that would asking a colony of ants to build the pyramids."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Everyone was polite. Even the chefs greeted us. Crystal especially was an amazing employee"}
{"text":"Anyone else got sick from eating at the location at Venetian in the last week? Service was horrible and the attitude of the staff was insane based on their response to a very unhappy customer while we ordered. I hope they didn't give me that persons contaminated burger."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write this review since my trip to Vegas a few months ago.  Thomas is the only employee I've ever really remembered and sticks out in my mind as being an extraordinarily attentive and friendly server.  I mean WOW this guy really defines customer service.  Was in a great mood, smiling and super helpful for our time there.  It was really busy when we went in and he was helping several people all at once and this dude never was overwhelmed and was in tune with our needs.  His whole demeanor was one worthy of a stellar review.  If I owned a restaurant (or any other business for that matter) Thomas would be the ideal employee.  He made such an impact I felt compelled to spread the word.  The food was good but even if it wasn't he made the experience one that would most definitely make me want to return."}
{"text":"The food was extremely overrated and overpriced i urge you to find something else before eating here"}
{"text":"Pretty good but over priced. I went in and has a burger, fries and a shake and it was $17! That's just too much for lunch. But don't get me wrong, food is good, just not great."}
{"text":"Burger bun suckkkkkssss ... Dry , fell apart in my hand..made a big old mess !! Otherwise it would of been a good burger ."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????white bread??????????????????????(^^)"}
{"text":"Well we landed here unexpectedly after walking 2 hours on the strip and after getting drinks right next door...i was hungry and for the mood 4 something heavy that i know would fill me up. Just a heads up it is at the mgm food court.. and the reasons y i didnt give it 5 stars was because 1. They didnt have their own napkins  and 2. They didn't have ranch other than that food was on point"}
{"text":"I heard about this place after watching Undercover Boss. Heard it was a staple in America and realized there was a location here in Mississauga so I gave it a shot.

I can't remember the exact price but I ordered the Cheese-steak sandwich. With fries and drink their \"combo\" was still pricey and it came to $20. I didn't care much because I was trying it for the 1st time.

The sandwich? It was bland, SALTY and the bun was a bit tough. I waited about 10 minutes for sub-par food.

I don't get or see why people like this place. It's a fast food chain that sells fast food food that you have to wait for in restaurant time with fine dining prices (in a way but still pricy) 

Won't even try their burgers at what they charge. I could go to a mom n pops place or even Burger King and get 2 combos with everything for under $20.

Never again!"}
{"text":"The phone number listed on their Yelp page and on their official website for this Meadows Mall location is in fact used for their fax machine. So good luck trying to reach a live person over the phone to see what time they close.  (I had to check the business hour of Meadows Mall for that day to avoid arriving after the mall has already been locked up for the day.)

But as far as the guest experience goes at this location compared to the other Las Vegas Johnny Rockets locations I have tried thus far, it is light years better.  Maybe it is the way this particular location is setup, with counters you sit at and orders taken right there, instead of a walk-up counter at all the other fast food restaurants where you place your order and come back later to pick up your order. Of course if you are placing a to go order, the cash register is ideally the spot to head to to initiate this transaction.  So if you have a choice between the various locations throughout LV, and this location is not much further away, then by all means come here!

Even though I have read somewhere that the menu is limited here, and I do believe that to be the case (based on what I can remember seeing on their burger menu vs the full burger menu I found on their official website), I still usually just go for their Smoke House Single or Double and their Hershey's® Chocolate Malt.  So limited menu or not, what I want is still available, thus made no difference to me whatsoever.  And the order came out quickly, so I was only able to distract myself on Clash of Clans and Snapchat for a minute.

On my most recent visit here, during the Christmas shopping period, the mall was bustling and there were only a handful of open seats at the JR counter.  So this place can get busy.  But the young man who took my order was on point, and the entire crew handled the holiday rush like badasses.

The price point is the only downer for JR.  Which is the main reason I don't stop by here half as often as the number of times I shop at Meadows Mall.  Groupon promotions are good, but might as well share some of that marketing dollars that Groupon receives and lower the price for all their customers.

Anyway. Decent burgers, good shakes/malts and efficient friendly crew at this Johnny Rockets.  I would come back in the future. Just not sure how soon that would be."}
{"text":"Just about everything I had here was just MEDIOCRE.  I ordered their SINGLE Rocket which is their classic or signature burger.  Their single patty included the thousand island sauce, American cheese, lettuce, and plain white buns.  There was nothing too extraordinary to mention at all.

The beef patty itself was not juicy with a basic taste while the cheese was non-melting.  Overall, mediocre!

The fries were slightly better.  I enjoyed it more than the burger!  They were large, crispy and soft.

My main complaint went to the slow service, thirty-minutes for mediocre food is unacceptable!  For all I knew my burger was waiting in the cold.  

Sorry JR of Arrowhead, I don't think I will be stopping by again."}
{"text":"I totally agree with the rest of the reviews on this location, the service was atrocious! It's a tiny restaurant and we were not even checked on once - no refills or anything! I finally got tired of waiting for her to come by the table so I went up to the counter to pay my bill. I'm a waitress myself so I know how it is when things are busy, but honestly it was not busy in this tiny restaurant and this was the very first time I refused to tip. As far as the food goes, it was not good. I ordered a cheeseburger and my boyfriend a philly - he picked his up and the grease was dripping down it. That'll be the LAST time we go there."}
{"text":"Slooooooow, and they are very very unorganized. Avoid like the black plague!!! You have been warned."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever!

Went there after doing some miniature golfing and got seated, and the waitress promptly took our drink/shake orders. She came back awhile later and asked us what we wanted to eat, all the while asking us again what our shake/drink orders were.

She then brought out our shake orders one every 5 minutes but not in any rhyme or reason. She took to sniffing every milk shake to see which one was which and still giving us the wrong ones. (which was a little scary cause we had someone allergic to bananas and one of the friends had ordered a chocolate banana shake). 

One of the glasses had food on the inside of it so we asked to have it remade, but pretty sure they just dumped the shake in a to go cup and added new whip cream on top. 

Then came the orders.....fries came out before actual entrees, people were getting the wrong burgers. Some didn't even get their burgers and we waited an hour. (there were only two other tables taken so there was hardly anyone there). They brought my order out and it had onions on it (which I said I can't have) and I sent it back. They brought it back out and it was the exact same burger! All they did was take the onions off! Seriously? You can't do a remake and make things right? 

By that point we had had enough as we had sent back three burgers cause they were wrong and two people still hadn't gotten their food. 

On top of that they were just a dumb staff and didn't know what they were doing. I wish that things could have gone better or that I could have liked their food but after all of this I really doubt that I will even give johnny rockets a second glance."}
{"text":"We been to many Johnny Rockets. As for this one... At first our experience was okay we got our seats soon. After we ordered... It was very slow. We had two tables and ordered at the same time and we didn't get our food until the other table was done eating. And one of our food order wasn't how we wanted. I would expect better since other Johnny Rockets was a good experience. I know restaurant jobs is not the best but atleast try to make the most of it and be more caring because the service we received felt fake."}
{"text":"THOMAS makes the experience! Absolutely wonderful service and great food. I like Johnny rockets anyway, but when in Vegas have to come to this one to see Thomas for the full experience. He is absolutely wonderful!"}
{"text":"Four stars because the manager (Rob) retired and unsure of the future of this location. We used to come here at least once a week and the service, staff, and environment was everything we came to expect and love of Johnny Rockets. We will miss Rob, but will still keep the dream alive."}
{"text":"Great portion sizes, shakes are great and the employees are very nice. They make
Lunch quick so I can get back to work on time."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick bite on New Year's Eve we knew Johnny Rockets would be a dependable choice. 

Service was great. Our server was on top of it with every table and was so friendly it made our meal that much better. The food was safe and we shared a smokehouse burger and a side of onion rings.

The food and service was what we expected and its a solid choice when you're looking for a basic snack or meal at Silverton."}
{"text":"Bacon Cheddar Burger with Bac Chz Fries Side and Strawberry Shake. 
Really good food. Nice staff. So good;)"}
{"text":"Was at the outlet stores and it was lunch time. We went to a place that we usually ate at when we were at the outlet only to find them now out of business. Me being on a high protein diet we went to Johnny Rockets. After we got there and seated I read the reviews which were not all that good. We did not have the experience the others had, had. Service was quick even though it was lunch and the place was fairly crowded. Food came out in a reasonable amount of time and tasted good. 
Now for the bad. There was a water leak at a serving station and there was water on the floor being tracked everywhere. Not safe. The upkeep of the place looks as if it could use a good cleaning. No visible dirt. Just expected it to look crisp if that makes sense. There were to many tables and no clear path across the 
restaurant. 
With that if I was in the area I would give them another try. Their burger was better than most places."}
{"text":"Pretty much a simplified version of the original Johnny Rocket's menu.  
Food is cooked to order, which is always fresh tasting.

Minus one for tiny teacup plates the burgers are served on.  The onion ring and french fry portions have been cut wayyy down; don't expect the same portioning you received when it was Johnny Rocket's."}
{"text":"We had a very late dinner tonight at Johnny Rockets in the mall. It hadn't even occurred to us what the time was until after we had already ordered and we were waiting for our meals. It was 8:54 so we apologized and told them that we could take it to go since they close at 9pm. They were so nice and told us that it wasn't a problem and to take our time. We tried to be quick about it and ended up taking some to go just to get out of their hair and left a hefty tip to show them we appreciated them. 
I know a lot of people who would just say that it's their job and not worry about it but I don't like to be \"THAT\" person. 
Shout out to everyone working tonight. We appreciated the delicious food and the wonderful customer service!!"}
{"text":"What a fun atmosphere to start off with. We came on a Sunday before noon so it wasn't too packed but it is your diner experience in a chain restaurant. The waiter was really attentive and it was our first time taking our 3 month old and he was a trooper. The little touch with the ketchup faces was really fun and the burgers we had were delicious. Definitely a place worth coming back to!"}
{"text":"10 minutes to be seated in an empty restaurant. Food came out extremely cold. Seemed like Fries had been sitting there for hours before served to us. Dinner was Horrible!!!"}
