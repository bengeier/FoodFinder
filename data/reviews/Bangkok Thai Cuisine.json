{"text":"The place looks good but the food....... I will try other place better."}
{"text":"No many how many times I have come here with my family, the food and services are always great! Food is delicious! Best service in town! What not to love about Bangkok? The devil of the sea soup is still my favorite soup ever! The Green Curry with pork is fantastic! Its not sweet like the other Thai places and this is how green curry should be! I have lived in Thailand for 2 years and this place is the most authentic!!"}
{"text":"I've been slacking on reviews lately (lately = about a year), but this place deserves props.  I am picky about Thai food.  It doesn't have to be authentic, although that's obviously preferred.  It does have to be good.  And the staples should be good.  If you cannot make pad thai, you are not a good Thai restaurant.  End of conversation.  Bonus points if you do cheap takeout.  Just stumbled upon this strip mall gem because I had to go to Richmond Mall, and yelped to see what was nearby to eat.  (Note - not much.)  So pleasantly surprised.  Ate in, which was quiet and simple, though had a solid 4-5 tables on a Monday lunch hour.  Tried a smorgasbord of basics just to check them out.  Spring rolls were the worst thing, which is sad, given my belief that it's hard to ruin something deep fried.  But the wrapper is more Chinese egg roll than Thai spring roll, which means way too much flavorless breading.  Filling was ok, but not recognizable as Thai either.  Then it got better.  I'm not a big dumpling fan, but these had a yummy chicken filling and a lovely sweet brown-but-not-soy sauce.  And a few pieces of broccoli on the side to actually eat, not just garnish.  Tom Kha Gai was delicious.  As good as any I've had in Thailand.  Mains of pad thai and a curry were totally solid.  (And they listen when you ask for veg with no tofu.  Give you copious amounts of actual vegetables, which I appreciate.)  I'm not saying this is the best Thai food I've ever had, but across the board I would say it's definitely the best in Cleveland.  (And I've been looking, tried Lemongrass and Mint and Ty Fun and Phnom Penh.)  Extra awesome that price points for mains are right where they should be, around $8.  (And if you get an app, the main will = two meals.  And leftover pad thai is amazing.)  If you live nearby, I highly recommend getting takeout from here on a cold winter night.  Will warm you right up."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying this place redeemed itself after making me a potentially miserable patron.  I went to pick-up food yesterday. It took about 30 minutes for everything to be ready once I placed the order. I walked in, and though the place was really charming. It looked really clean, the colours were warm, and the décor was really pretty (along the back wall).  We ordered 5 items, which I'll go into detail about later: chicken Thai spring rolls, emerald green chicken curry, steamed rice (cause apparently the curry doesn't come with rice), glass chicken noodles, and spicy noodles with chicken.   I usually take inventory of what we get before I leave a restaurant, but they tied this bag so tight that I could only count by sight. I counted 5 containers, which was great cause I ordered 5 items. Well, you can see where this is heading, I get home and we were missing the glass noodles.  This happened because the spicy noodles came in two separate containers.   The servers DID notice this and called me twice and left a message. Well, of course I couldn't answer, being a responsible driver and all. So I got home and called them back. They were really apologetic and drove the food over themselves (which isn't a service they usually offer).  That isn't why I gave 3-stars. I felt they really went above a beyond, it was a human error after all! We all make them. But the food just wasn't anything overly exceptional in my opinion.  The spring rolls and glass noodles were the best part of the meal.  -The glass noodles were flavourful with bok choy, chicken and onions.  -The spicy noodles, really weren't spicy at all. But they had a lot of chicken and bell peppers, so it was still tasty enough. It was odd to me that we had to mix the noodles and sauce ourselves. I am curious why they serve it this way, not that it makes a big deal... -Finally, the emerald curry... it was pretty standard. How a restaurant can offer curry without rice, is beyond me. That aside, the chicken was good, and the few vegetables in the dish (broccoli, bamboo shoots and mini-corn) were cooked well. But it's a whole lot of money for a really mundane dish.  I would probably go back, but only for lunch when they have their specials. Our entire meal came to $53"}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed Bangkok yet?  Best stuff around. Friends from out of state thirst for it when they visit the area. Weekly trips with coworkers to grab takeout.  Never been before? Pork Thai Gra Pao, add two eggs. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"So, Ive only ever had the Pad Thai from Bangkok and thats all I really ever care to try haha. Ive had a few of the soups and they are decent. But the Pad Thai..... I am obsessed. I live about 200 yards away and this is my default dish whenever I want something quick. (your order will be ready for take out in 10 minutes, and if you eat in be ready for your food just about as quickly as you get your drink) The interior is clean, with a few decorations, nothing spectacular. Service is stupid speedy. Price is very reasonable. As for other dishes, my girlfriend has had no complaints.  Oh, if youre a meathead like me and want to customize your meal, theyll add as much chicken/shrimp as you want. Love it."}
{"text":"This has become a regular place for my husband and I. We think it's the best Thai food in Cleveland (at least on the East side.) The balance of sweet, tangy, hot, and salty is always perfect. My husband favors the basil chicken or the crispy noodles in gravy. I tend to fall back on mango rice with chicken and shrimp. All their soups are fantastic. If you go to Mint on Coventry, this is worth the extra few minutes' drive east down Mayfield."}
{"text":"Had dinner tonight again. Never disappointed. Love the Thai basal with duck. My whole family has favorites here.  Worth a try."}
{"text":"Always outstanding.  Nice people and excellent food.  Found Bangkok Thai by accident and I am now a regular.  Can't find better in Cleveland.  Hidden in a small strip mall, it is worth a visit."}
{"text":"The food and service is outstanding. Great little hidden gem in Lyndhurst. The mango noodles is a must try. The servers give great advice on ordering. Do your self a favor and stop in and get some of best Thai around."}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for a good Thai restaurant, and this is far and away the best in the area. I would eat here every day if I could. I have yet to be disappointed with any of my menu selections, and they have a very diverse set of offerings. The spice level is right where we want it -- hot when we want it hot, mild when we want it mild. The staff is very friendly and helpful. If you like Thai food, you will NOT be disappointed."}
{"text":"We ordered 6 dishes take out. Although dishes were relatively expensive and small portions, they were flavourful. Our fav was the mango fish and pad Thai. The restaurant was very accommodating to our shellfish allergy."}
{"text":"I don't eat Thai that often, but this was very good.  Went with my wife and oldest son and we shared entrées as well as the Shrimp in Blankets appetizer.  My son got the Thai Gra Pao which lived up to its three star spicy billing.  My Wife had the Pad Thai Woon Sen (clear noodles) which was also very good - i liked how the peanut taste was there but didn't overwhelm the other tastes.  I had the Garlic Salmon which was a mistake on my part.  It wasn't bad, but it was basically Salmon with a lot of garlic on it - I can do that myself.  It was certainly good and actually helped balance out the whole meal.  Next time we're going to ask for more plates so we can share more easily.  Yes, that means we're going back."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt my favorite Thai restaurant. I was so happy we found this gem. When I go here, I have to have their Pad Thai. We always order something else but the Pad Thai is our staple when we come here. The service has always been good and friendly."}
{"text":"Two of the best dishes between here and Boston: Thai Gra Pao (pork) with two fried eggs and the Thai Larb (pork). Get them spicy you will not regret it."}
{"text":"I have always been partial to the Mekong River on Lee but Bangkok Thai is a gem.  Food is excellent, service is fast and courteous.  Excellent for take away as I live right up the street :)"}
{"text":"Go there frequently. Clean, nice atmosphere. Great food at a reasonable price. Daughter and I usually have the Tamarind Currie Chicken.  I usually have an Asian beer to suite the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went here almost every other week for lunch with my coworkers roughly for 6 years. Not once was I disappointed! This place is located in a small strip so its easy to miss. But once in, you will be greeted by the friendly people of this restaurant.  I have tried a lot of the dishes from the menu. From Thai iced tea to different curries, stir fry dishes and fried rice. My personal favorites are the Crazy Noodles, Hot Basil, Pineapple fried rice and Veg Gyozas. The prices are very reasonable, portions are huge and the service is excellent. I have never got a meal that lacked flavor.   I have tried Thai food at different places from East to West coast and this is by far the best Thai place. Now that I have moved, I miss Bangkok Thai!"}
{"text":"We were promptly seated on an early Saturday evening. Excellent attentive service. The menu offers an astounding array of options to choose from. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We had the dinner in last Saturday night, which was close to their closing time. We order our food and surprisingly they are hot and fresh. Especially, the Pad Thai is very good and the taste is what I had before in Thailand. You should try and the price is reasonable. The warm and polite welcome greeting with the friendly services."}
{"text":"Definitely not recomended. My wife and I left  before we could even finish our meal. We found  this restaurant on Yelp and had never been so disappointed before. Will not come back again."}
{"text":"Bangkok is a real hidden gem. It has an easy to pass by location in a rather drab strip mall. For that reason, it took me several months to first visit it after it opened. Don't let that outside facade fool you as Bangkok makes some of the best Thai food in town.   Like the outside, Bangkok's interior isn't anything spectacular. It is neat and clean but nothing fancy. The interior \"storm door\" doesn't add to any ambiance but it's nicely decorated all things considered. The service is always friendly and usually very efficient. Bangkok is also great for carry out.   There's a few things that I almost always get there. There's their awesome Thai Iced Tea. The pad Thai is among the best I've had anywhere. Any of their fried rice dishes are excellent choices although I'm rather fond of the Bangkok and Mango Fried Rice dishes. All their dishes are always beautifully presented.   Bangkok is easy to miss but if you're in the neighborhood, stop by and give it a try. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This place is very nice, they have nice waitresses.... They are up to date in technology with there takeout ordering service.. the pad Thai & duck is very good.... I would recommend this place for good pad Thai only thing is it's alil dry so that's the only downside but still good so I give it 4 stars cause I would return!! P.s I would've had a pic but I ate it up lol"}
{"text":"Didn't expect such quality / delicious/ good Thai food. Been regular to nice Thai places in & around NYC. Don't get fooled by the appearance of the place nor the decor inside. The service is good - attentive & responsive. Food took around 15 minutes. I went on a Friday evening. All tables were occupied, the only time tables were empty when they had to be cleaned.   The magic is in the food. Tried spring roll, Shrimp & Chicken Basil & Pad Thai.   Will visit again to try the rest on the menu."}
{"text":"Tiny portions. Curry doesn't come with rice and it's 14 dollar curry literally the size of a small bowl. What kind of curry dish doesn't come with rice? It was takeout and I had to ask for cutlery after I noticed it was missing, really? Am I going to eat curry with my hands? Ripoff."}
{"text":"This is our favorite restaurant in Cleveland. It is family-run, very modest, but the food is wonderful. I have been to other Thai restaurants in Cleveland, which are mostly fancier, but Bangkok really stands out by far. Both the attitude of the waitresses (who I guess are all members of the same family) and the freshness of food make it a wonderful dining experience. My wife and I always go to Bangkok whenever we need to feel good."}
{"text":"Don't let the curb appeal fool you!  This place has amazing food, great service and greatly priced.  Pad thai is very good along with many other dishes. I would definitely encourage everyone to try this place.  I'm glad I did. I've lived in this neighborhood for years and have driven by several times but unfortunately their curb appeal has kept me out  Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"The pad ped and drunken noodles are the best I have ever had in any Thai restaurant. Still trying to find a place that matches this."}
{"text":"It is one of the best Thai restaurants in GTA. I am originally from Asia and love Thai food. The curry here may not be the best in Thailand but certainly way above average here. My son loved their pad thai and said this is the best pad thai he's ever tasted (he is a pad thai nut and only orders pad thai in a thai restaurant :) ) The mango salad is a bit too sweet for me but my wife and son seemed to like it very much."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service, typically no wait make this our go to Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"A friend of mine had recommended this restaurant to have the best Thai food in the area. This recommendation, affirmed by the great yelp reviews, took us to this restaurant.  What else I can say - the moment we parked our car (we parked behind the restaurant kitchen) - it smelt like heaven. We had to wait for 15-20 minutes (it was a saturday evening), and the awesome fragrance was really killing us.  For our meal, we ordered Bangkok Fried Rice and Tamarind Crispy Basil Chicken, both on a spiciness level of 3 stars. Both were perfect on flavors. I personally loved the Tamarind Crispy Basil Chicken; it had the right amount of sourness, sweetness and hotness. Bangkok Fried Rice was little too hot for me. But, my boyfriend simply loved both the dishes.  Now to come to other stuff that we had ordered. Spring rolls were very crispy and came with a very nice sweet and sour sauce. Dumplings were okay (I would not order them again). Tom Yum Kai soup was perfect. Khao Tom Chicken soup, which we tried for the first time here, was surprisingly good and had nice simple, beautiful flavors.  After so much tasty food, we were too full to try out the desserts. Maybe next time!  A word about the decor: This place may not look like the fanciest place in town from the outside; but on the inside, it is pretty cute!  Can't wait to go there again!"}
{"text":"Outstanding food every time. I am addicted to the hot basil stir fry. Will continue coming back often.  Very friendly staff as well."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding. I highly recommend the Bangkok in Love. The peanut sauce is AWESOME! Can't get enough of it. The pad Thai is great, too. And the staff is fantastic. Can't go wrong eating here."}
{"text":"Best one in Cleveland. And authentic per our Thai friends. We def like it.    Tip:  Pineapple Fried Rice -- Great!"}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough! Cleveland is not really a city known for it's culinary treasures but amongst the few handful of places in the Cleveland area this place certainly stands out. The food and the service were exceptional! The fried bananas were out of this world delicious! Highly recommend and will definitely dine here again when back in Cleveland. :)"}
{"text":"First time here....  This is a small Thai restaurant in a strip mall, which makes it easy to overlook.  Lovely red interior.  The food was pretty good and appears to be homestyle.  I had a most excellent Tom Yum with the perfect balance of sourness.  Personally, I feel that a good Tom Yum is an art.  Also had the Pad See Ew noodles, with tofu.  They tofu was well prepared (good tofu is also an art :) ) - stir fried slowly so the tofu looses it's moisture and becomes chewy and dense, rather than deep fried.   Finally, they have an excellent house made hot sauce, which is necessary since the spice level here seems toned down.  Downsides were that it was a bit too oily and needed more veggies.  I will try this again...."}
{"text":"The best Thai food around! It's one of my favorite restaurants. The waitresses are always very pleasant and happy. The food is always served quickly and is very delicious. In the 4+ years I've been going there I've never had a bad meal. Their Thai iced tea is soooooo good too!"}
{"text":"Awesome pad thai! Good prices, very fresh. Casual attire. Be prepared for the lunch and dinner rush, long wait but well worth it."}
{"text":"Local restaurant had very good reviews, but we were like \"meh\".  I thought Crazy Noodles were good, and my wife's Pad Pik King was also good.  That being said, the Golden Rolls and Shrimp in a Basket were almost inedible due to overcooking.  Service was ok.  We found the 4* rating a bit high.  For the price, try Golden Dragon about a mile down the street."}
{"text":"I have never spent one night in Bangkok nor travelled around with Anthony Bourdain so I have no idea what authentic Thai cuisine should taste like. But my daughter invited me to share her takeout order of Beef Pad Thai, Emerald Chicken Curry, veg spring rolls (so crunchy and delightful),and Sticky Rice (pass next time). Loving sticky rice on Sushi, I thought it would be the same....didn't expect 2 flat lumps of goo but like I said, maybe it's supposed to be that way? All I can say for sure is, the food was positively delicious and addictive! Mmmmmmmmm!!!"}
{"text":"We were on the way to the cavs game and we stopped at this restaurant. I loved the food but it was way to salty for me. If they can adjust the salt for me I will more then happy to come back. The owner seemed to be very kind. I will call next time to see if they can adjust the salt."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great for dates and family. Service was good also. Food was fantastic.  Flavours are authentic, as well as, presentation."}
{"text":"Love the food. Fast service and the food comes out hot! I love the Bangkok Thailand fried rice. A little spicy and beautiful presentation."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had our first date at Bangkok Thai one year ago today-- we ordered the chicken spring rolls first-- they were delicious.  I had the chicken PadSee Eaw and it was the best I've ever tasted...  He ordered the Crazy Noodles...I believe...we can't seem to recall.  Regardless--we are headed there this evening...looking forward to celebrating our one year dating anniversary...  I recommend Bangkok Thai for quiet romantic evenings (reasonably priced for eating in...it seems a little expensive for take-out) and for a nice night celebrating with the family. :-)"}
{"text":"My name is Paul and I'd like to say this is my go to restaurant.  The staff is friendly, funny and eager to make your order PERFECT.  The food is absolutely FANTASTIC, best Thai food in the Cleveland area.  If you haven't gone to this restaurant I highly recommend that you do.  I signed up for YELP reviews just to tell you how WONDERFUL BANGKOK THAI really is!  ENJOY!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!!!! Never had a bad dish. The service is quick and friendly. The mango paradise is amazing. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it. Most dishes you can tell them how hot you want it."}
{"text":"Both the food and service at Bangkok Thai are just delightful.  We've tried a number of things on their menu, and every one has been excellent -- from appetizers through dessert.  This is easily one of the best Thai restaurants we've ever eaten at.  If you're in the Cleveland area, we'd high recommend giving your business to this family run restaurant.  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Thai in the area! Bangkok in Love is by far my favorite! Delicious, crispy chicken with amazing peanut sauce!  Also definitely cannot go wrong with Pad Thai.  Staff is very friendly and the place is rarely very busy so food comes very quickly.  Worth a try, for sure!"}
{"text":"Two words Mango Curry; the best $13 you will spend.  The Pad Woon Sen was good.  Place is clean and well decorated. Attractive and attentive waitress. Desert was ice cream surrounded by bananas in springroll wrapper flash fried....excellently crisp, hot sweet and cold."}
{"text":"I travel all over the US and enjoy Thai food.  I had their mango curry, extra spicy what a treat!  For desert fried banana with ice cream.  And a glass of Pinot.  Highly recommend. Will come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Great food! Service and decor seem typical of strip mall restaurants, but since I only use them for carry-out,  I gave them 4 stars. My opinion is based solely on the food."}
{"text":"Ever since my former go-to Thai place on Mayfield Rd. left years ago I have struggled to find a restaurant to fit that niche. I have tried several Thai places around Cleveland and some in DC and I have to say Bangkok Thai is one of the best.   First off, My family and I ordered take-out by phone. The young lady who picked up the phone at the other end was fast, precise, and polite. I placed an order for Beef Satay, Vegetable Pad Thai, Bangkok in Love (with extra peanut sauce), and Mango Curry with Chicken which would be ready in 20 minutes.   When we arrived for our pickup, the food was already waiting for us. The kind hostesses reread our order to make sure everything was correct and went in the back to get us even more peanut sauce.  Digging in at home my family and I found the food extremely enjoyable. The Beef Satay was high quality and the spicy cucumber salad served with it was thick and had a complex flavor. The Mango Curry was delicious and when all ingredients were mixed together it offered the perfect balance of flavors, textures, and colors. The Bangkok in love was just as good and was packaged with the chicken and sauce separately as to not make the coating soggy. And the Pad Thai was the pièce de résistance. Normally I put peanut sauce on my Pad Thai but the flavor of this one was so exquisite that it needed no supplements.   Overall, this restaurant is a hidden gem in Cleveland with excellent efficiency, atmosphere, and food."}
{"text":"I visit the East side quite often, and I've been to this place before when looking for some inexpensive but tasty Thai. Unfortunately, this place has gone downhill substantially since my last visit a few years ago. Though the service was friendly, the food was just not up to the same level as I had previously experienced. The pad Thai that I ordered was swimming in sauce that was overly sweet for this dish (and I've had quite a bit of Pad Thai at various places over the years). My husband's Bangkok fried rice was rated as \"two stars\" (medium), but barely had any spice at all. His hunch, which I agree with, was that perhaps this restaurant has changed its preparation methods to cater to an older American clientele that might not be used to Thai spices. This is a pity, and I hope this restaurant reverses course soon. Not sure if we'll be back."}
{"text":"Friendly service, quick food turnaround, great prices for the portions provided and tons of flavorful food are what set Bangkok Thai apart.  The staff are all very friendly, and will happily explain ingredients or make suggestions if needed.  The most popular dish among my friends is by far the the crazy noodles with shrimp, but I prefer it with chicken. My personal favorite is the hot basil stir-fry with chicken, and my wife prefer's their orange chicken.  Save some rice for the delicious broth on the bottom!  If you are like me and enjoy spicy food I would recommend a spice level of 3 or higher. People rave about their Pad Thai but i have yet to try it. It sounds and looks amazing. They also have some great lunch specials worth stopping by for.    Please note: They don't accept American Express"}
{"text":"This place is great. THey have some of the best thai food I have found in Ohio. Moving to Cleveeland from Seattle I had gotten so used to having Asian food on every corner.   I love the vegetable Pad Thai as well as the Ginger Chicken."}
{"text":"The service is super friendly, the food tastes amazing and the prices are incredibly reasonable. Literally, what more could you ask for?  I ordered the Coconut Veggie Soup as part of my lunch special... I could eat an entire pot of this is was so tasty. It had a rich coconuty texture with a citrusy undertone that is common in Thai dishes. It was awesome. My lunch special also came with a veggie spring roll, and the dipping sauce was very tasty. As a main I ordered a spicy eggplant dish that didn't disappoint.   I would say in terms of value, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love Bangkok Thai. A coworker of his told him about his hidden gem about two years ago and we go/order take out once a month. Food is delicious and portion sizes are decent. I normally stick to ordering the Crazy Noodles but my boyfriend has ordered the pineapple fried rice, mango fried rice, basil fried rice, pad Thai, and some duck dish. All of which he's enjoyed."}
{"text":"Delicious thai food! I wish I had been able to try this place sooner. They have the best pad Thai in the Cleveland area - and I've tried pretty much everywhere. The lime/tangy taste makes all the difference. Also tried the yellow curry and it was very good. Perfect level of spiciness and creaminess. Takeout was ready quickly - 15 mins. Price seems on par with other places."}
{"text":"After finishing our meal, the first thing we said was \"Wow, we should have tried this place sooner\".    This place really is a gem, hidden in a rather nondescript plaza on a rather boring section of Mayfield Rd.  The interior of the restaurant was comfortable, clean, and had sort of a low key niceness to it.  I have been here a few times in the last few months and have been satisfied everytime with the quality of food and service.  Try the black sticky rice dessert!"}
{"text":"Always good food and hospitable service.  This time I ordered drunken chicken. Ooh yummy.  The chicken satay is good too.  I wish they would put more meat in their stir fry dishes.  They get too vegetable-heavy for me."}
{"text":"The drive between Richmond Hill and Newmarket north on Yonge street is rather scarce when it comes to reliable food options that aren't being served from Drive-thru window. So when my buddy and I were looking for something to grab quick and he recalled his visit to Bangkok Thai, we made quick moves to Yonge and Mulock to visit this spot.  To be fair I was going to give this place a fourth star based on price alone, especially given that my buddy and I were able to both eat for around $20. I mean you don't get a soup, spring role and main course for $8.95-$9.95/person. Anywhere!  From a price perspective I felt the prices werecheap, however as Shawn mentioned, the portion sizes were small-ish, so from a value perspective I would have to dock them a star. Standing alone it is good Thai food, not the BEST I've ever had but it is still pretty darn good. I had the coconut chicken soup and Pad Thai and I felt both were very good and would likely order them again!  The only other star I am removing is based off of aesthetic appeal and location. It's buried in a plaza, so some would argue this is a hidden gem.   In reality I award Bangkok Thai Cuisine 3.5/5. This is the best local option for Thai around and you'd be remiss to not give it a try.  Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"This place has always had good service and quality food. Been coming here for 5 years. Prices are a bit high and they  close at odd hours but its still one of the best places around."}
{"text":"Fantastic fresh flavors beautifully presented in a casual and unpretentious space. Housed in a simple and unassuming, small strip of shops, I was surprised by the sophistication of the flavors and presentation. This is more than just run of the mill Thai food slammed together. I especially appreciate that they offer brown rice. I had a veggie curry and all the vegetables were market fresh and very crisp and lightly cooked. Unfortunately this place is off the beaten path for me or I would be a regular. I'll definitely be visiting again when I'm shopping at Legacy village. It might not be right next door to all the mall shopping but it sure beats all the chain fare. Do yourself a favor and head here!"}
{"text":"We got take out and the food was spectacular! We ordered the Drunken Chicken, Seafood Dynasty, Coconut Chicken Soup, and Steamed Chicken Dumplings. The food was ready in less than 20 minutes. The staff is incredibly friendly! I would highly recommend the restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"ATTITUDE I have been visiting this restaurant for almost five years and this is one best restaurants I know of in this Cleveland area. Of late although the taste changed a bit, more than that the servants attitude changed and they become more arrogant and reckless. One day I ordered four Basil chicken fried rice, the taste was disgusting as the rice not cooked well and taste was bald. When I called the front desk they responded as if WHAT SHOULD I DO. The worst is they didn't even talking apologetic. Of late I also found similar feedback from couple of friends. Bottom line is the attitude brings more business more than good taste."}
{"text":"Food is bland. Beef more chewy than i could swallow. Soup and curry more watery than expected. The ambience and service is nice and possibly please those who like mild food. $10 lunch special leave you asking for more. Veggies are crisp and fresh. I would pass on this place, but i had been curious so i went in for it!"}
{"text":"There aren't many Thai restaurants in Newmarket. They have good, authentic flavour (no MSG!!), Good service. Unfortunately the portion is small in comparison to other similar restaurants and while the price is no cheaper. I had wished their curry comes with rice."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of \"crazy noodles\" because it takes the traditional pad thai noodles and adds a different spin to it.  The crazy noodles with pork is what I selected as a lunch meal. It was $9 which seemed a touch high for a lunch in a rather small container. The pork and vegetables were abundant and the food had a lot of flavor. A bit salty for some I would think but for me, it was just right. I couldn't stop thinking about how $9 translated to such a small portion.  So, besides the price for a lunch, a super small portion, and a touch on the salty side, it was good."}
{"text":"This was my daughter and I's first time eating Thai food and it was amazing! We'll definitely be going again."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here with our 2 year old. We came in a little late but they still served us with pleasure. They brought us a high chair, plastic cutlery, plate and cup for the baby. Food was delicious as well. Very friendly. We ordered a soup, two entrees, and 1 sprite and it came up to around $50."}
{"text":"OMG fried bananas - with 2(!) scoops of ice cream (mic drop)  The mango salad - can't say enough!! The food - sooooo fresh.  Listen, I wouldn't waste your time - try this place."}
{"text":"This was the first Thai restaurant we tried after moving to Cleveland & it's the one we always come back to. Service has always been prompt and friendly. We've tried a variety of dishes, but mostly stick with the Pad Thai, and have always been happy with the flavors. Their soups are amazing and shouldn't be overlooked! Overall, I think this is a very solid Thai restaurant and a great go to in the area."}
{"text":"Food is adequate for this region. Compared to other Thai restaurants outside of Northeast Ohio the food is unimpressive. Stay away from the crispy Tamarind chicken. The Pad Thai smells  like it had peanut butter mixed into the sauce. I would still prefer to eat poorly made Thai food than most other styles of food."}
{"text":"You will like the ambience that this restaurant brings. Once you walk in, you will notice a little bit of Asian inspirations. There are fresh plants in the place and that is always a positive thing in my books. I have been to this restaurant a lot of times... and I do wish to come back again and again. You will never go wrong with anything that you order from their menu. I have pretty much tried a lot of their food and they are all incredible. I love that they now have an option to substitute white rice with brown for only $1.00 more. Their portions are pretty reasonable for the price also.  My new fave is the fish with curry sauce. I wasn't expecting to like it so much, but I did. The fish was more likely basa, ( I forgot to ask) but it was still really tasty and soft. The sauce had a hint of spice that wasn't too overwhelming for my pallette.  Overall, i will come back again. Since it is only a stones throw away from my home."}
{"text":"I lived in Thailand for 3 years before moving here to Cleveland. This place is about as close as you will get to real Thai food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Amazing.  Dare I say the best north of the GTA and probably even better then any Thai cuisine I've been to before.    The owner is amazing.  She takes the time to ensure her customers are treated very well and it's always a pleasure to converse with her while waiting on the food.   The food.. Delicious!  I order the pad Thai here numerous times and it is definitely top notch.  Lots of flavour and with a generous portion that no one can complain for the price.  The soup, skewers, down to the mango salad -  don't think I've had better.   Take the time to venture out north here if your not from around the area like me for this gem and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.  Do wish it was closer =(!   Keep up the great service and food!"}
{"text":"We ordered 5 different  meals. crazy noodles were good. pad Thai was ok dumplings were big."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was in high school, a college graduate & married with 1 kid and I still do take outs and dine in occasionally. One of my favorite Asian places, my kids love the pad see eaw, Tamarind basil w fish is my all time fav that I cant get over until now. My husband loves their Panang curry and he could eat that almost everyday. The taste has never changed & still owe by the same family with the same friendly service and that's what make us keep coming back over the years.   Ms. Kimmy"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had outside of Thailand! The mango chicken curry is absolutely divine, with huge chunks of fresh mango and the most delicious curry sauce I've ever tasted! There was a week in which I ordered the curry 2 days in a row and the only thing keeping me from ordering the 3rd day was pure shame of eating the same meal for dinner 3 days in a row. They also have a Thai chicken rice soup with shreds of ginger that was unbelievably delicious, just pure joy for your tastebuds.  I have also tried their Crazy Noodles, Pad Thai, a few appetizers as well as their coconut milk rice with sliced mango. They were all good but nothing could outshine my beloved mango curry. By this point I think you get the point, YOU MUST TRY THE MAGNO CURRY! I have never dined in so I can't speak as to the dining room experience but it seemed like your typical Thai restaurant decor complete with beach tiki hut acting as the hostess stand/front counter. So order the mango curry and thank me later!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food!  Friendly staff!  We love the Pad Thai Noodles and the Siam Rice!"}
{"text":"Best Chicken Pad Thai in Newmarket by far - sizzling spicy if you like that and the prices were decent. They have a large selection in their menus and their customer service was fantastic!!! If you love Thai food; give this place a try. I'm certainly coming back here again!"}
{"text":"I've been here now for lunch 2 times. Service was very quick in spite of the fact that the restaurant was packed for lunch. Both times the food was excellent. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"A well maintained diner for some amazing Thai food.. Scores for the neat and organized ambience, service and courtesy, delicious taste and the quickness of serving food.. This place is definitely atop my list for Asian flavors..!"}
{"text":"One of the good Thai places in Newmarket. Their lunch specials are reasonable priced and tastes great! They do not use MSG so that is always a plus.  My go to is their chicken pad thai lunch special (spicy) with a coconut chicken soup and a spring roll. Everything is always delicious, fresh and fast.   I'm not sure what authentic pad thai should taste like but this seems pretty legit to me! Stop by if you get the chance!"}
{"text":"OMG the Pad Thai I dream about.  Sucks I was only visiting.  Sucks I didn't find this place at the beginning of my trip because I would have come here every day.  Everything was perfect, the sauce, the noodles, the veggies were cooked perfectly..not mushy..still firm and kinda crisp.  Perfection."}
{"text":"Their Pad Thai is literally out of this world. I cannot stop talking about it. Please give me more pad Thai."}
{"text":"Me and my friend went to bangcock Thai and it was one of the best experiences that I had at a restaurant. We had the sesame beef and one of the best dishes I always get it when I go there ! We also got the garlic shrimp and also very tasty and cook well ! Service is amazing ! Thank you !"}
{"text":"Solid Thai food if you're in the area. We moved in nearby (coming from out of state) and hit this place three days in a row for lunch since we didn't have our kitchen unpacked.   Portions sizes are generous, the menu is pretty diverse, and the service is good. I recommend the Bangkok fried rice and the Tamarind chicken. It gets pretty busy for workday lunch, which is also a good indicator of quality to me.  I consider this place our go to restaurant for a quick and inexpensive meal out. You won't go wrong."}
{"text":"Visited Bangkok for a company lunch. Service was fantastic. The hostess managed to seat a group of 6 during the lunch rush in less than ten minutes.  I tried the Pad Thai and a glass of Thai Tea. The Pad Thai was sweeter than I've had at other Thai restaurants, but it was a great (and large) meal. Thai tea is one of my weaknesses and I'd definitely recommend trying some at Bangkok!"}
{"text":"I would say it's the worst Thai food I've ever had. Don't know if other people have tried Thai food in other places. But this restaurant was not even close to authentic Thai food I've had before. It was not real Thai. The curry was basically water and all vegetables were overcooked. It was my first and last time at this restaurant."}
{"text":"This review is based on one visit and one dish. I told the waitress that I liked very spicy and that I don't normally eat coconut curries. She recommended the crazy noodles. She said it was very popular. I thought well Mcdonald's is very popular, what if the clientele that comes here are moron's? I said I would like to have the crazy noodles with pork, thai hot! As hot as you can make it. She laughed a little and then retreated to the kitchen. As I was waiting a couple came in. I was assuming a Father and Daughter from the age difference but who knows. He had no idea what to order and she was telling him that she liked spicy. She said two stars was all that she could handle. She said that Mike orders three stars and he sweats like  a really sweaty guy when he eats it. I thought holy crap what have I done. I've ordered a heat level off the charts. How am I going to eat this. Is the waitress going to laugh some more and bring out the kitchen staff to laugh at me too. And who the hell is Mike anyway. She brought out my crazy noodles with some water and told me to enjoy. I was apprehensive. It looked hot. It looked damn hot. It had chili seeds everywhere. I took a bite. Ok, maybe it's one of those sneek up on you heats. I took another. Ok, this is spicy but not debilitating. This was delicious. I enjoyed every bite, thinking Mike is a sissy. The waitress came back and asked if it was spicy enough and I said it's fine. I can handle hotter. When she handed me the bill I saw that she only placed 3 stars next to my order. It was not thai hot. I still don't know if I can eat their thai hot.  I wish I knew how to convince the wait staff at Asian restaurants that I really want it hot. They never seem to believe me until after I'm finished eating."}
{"text":"Went there with my family last week and fell in love with it. I had panang curry and iced Thai coffee. My family has a lot of dietary restrictions and they were able to accommodate everyone. I also had enough food leftover to have lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Great food.  The flavors were non-bland which is what I'm looking for.  restaurant ambience is nice."}
{"text":"Tremendous Thai food can be found at Bangkok Thai.  I've come here to eat 4-5 times over the last 6 months and i have yet to be disappointed by the quality of food.  I usually go with the tofu pad Thai, which is among the best I've had in the Cleveland area.  When ordering meals the waitresses usually ask how spicy you'd like the food, on a scale of 1-4.  I made the mistake of ordering a 4 once, which I would to be way to overbearing, and this too coming from someone who has an incredibly high threshold for spicy food.  Other than that, a 2-3 will provide a very nice level of spice that won't take away from the flavor of the food.  My only critique about this place would be the service which at times can be slow, and the fact that they don't carry vegetable spring rolls.  Nevertheless, I'd still recommend this place if you're out on the east-side and are in search of some good Thai food.  Don't let it's location in a random strip mall on Mayfield fool you.  Stop by and enjoy."}
{"text":"Had a huge urge for curry that night, so decided to fly over for some. It's quite close to my house, so there was no hesitation lol The restaurant is located on the north east side of Yonge and Mulock. I went during dinner time, so lighting was dim and very steakhouse like.  We were seated promptly by a polite gentleman, looked to be in his 20s. He was a nice guy, well mannered and attentive. The second time he came over (3 minutes later) we gave him our order. I had the green curry with chicken and the lady had a shrimp pad thai. I'm sad to say that the food was only mediocre at best. It wasn't the worst, but not the best either. The curry was supposed to have a coconut in it, but I could barely taste it. I think I'm just use to Restoran Malaysia, where the coconut is strong. The pad thai was also not what I expected because it was on the soggy side. The noodle was way too soft and would break apart easily.  Like I said, service was great. I would come back based on the service alone. Mediocre food I can deal with, not had service! :) 3.5 stars"}
{"text":"The Best Thai food in Cleveland...by far the best!   Dont go by the the exteriors of this place...the Interiors are real good and simply awesome food makes it even better!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice. It's good food don't get me wrong but for the price, I don't feel I get the atmosphere or the quality of food I want. It's good just not great so for the price it's more just run of the mill average Asian food with average sized portions"}
{"text":"Food is always great here! Service is the best! Always friendly and smiling! I have an addiction for their Thai Gra Pao with a fried egg! Must have it at least once a week!"}
{"text":"With a sudden craving for Thai and at a loss for somewhere close, my friends suggested Bangkok Thai which was in walking distance to their house. Honestly I was surprisingly impressed!!!! I know the saying \"don't judge a book by it's cover\" but I always ignored this little gem due to the random strip mall location. Then after my first bite I felt ashamed. I learnt my lesson. I am a repeat offender of the Pad Thai which you can order as is or with your desired level of spiciness added. Both are excellent. And I do have to say...the to-go portion is huge (optical illusion maybe but I think not...). As for the rest of the menu...friends and family have yet to be disappointed.   Lesson learned."}
{"text":"Came by for lunch with my son and also my friend and her son. Amazing service. V was super nice and so sweet! She was very attentive and so great to our kids! I had the lunch spicy tofu and it was delicious! They've got a lunch menu which is great! Big parking lot as well! It was a yummy lunch for all of us! Will definitely come back! :)"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for a while.  I had dinner here on a Friday night, it wasn't crowded, but business was pretty steady.   The hostess was very welcoming.  I was immediately seated and proceeded to place my order.  I ordered the chicken spring rolls and Pad Thai.   The spring rolls were tasty, nothing extraordinary.  I have a mixed review about the Pad Thai, it was was well prepared, but WAY too sweet for my taste.   I will definitely return, but will opt for something more savory/spicy."}
{"text":"This quaint little place has superior food.  I highly recommend the Crazy noodles.  I absolutely love this dish with chicken and I request crushed peanuts.  The spice is a little inconsistent , sometimes spicier or mild but always delicious."}
{"text":"My father and I thoroughly enjoyed the pad Thai. My mother loved the mango fried rice. Very friendly and speedy service."}
{"text":"It has been a while since we have traveled over to this area for Thai food.  We were pleased with our meals as well as the service.  We had a vegetable and chicken pad Thai as well as tofu soup and chicken potstickers.  The tofu soup was fresh and delicious, full of complex flavors including cilantro garlic and lime.  The chicken potstickers were very flavorful and cooked to perfection.  Our entrees were done well and were presented in a very colorful way with the lime and carrot garnish.  The cabbage was crisp and the over flavor was just on the sweet side.  Homemade hot sauce was sweet and just a little spicy.  The homemade chili oil was full of heat and just a little on the heavy side with chopped peppers still in the oil.  The decor was to the region and was interesting to look at.  A little dusting on some of the items would be our only complaint.  Enjoy your meal for here... or to go!"}
{"text":"1st time i went the food was spot on. 2nd appearance, food was rotten Bangkok. Chicken satay was disgusting and tasted rancid.  It was if they were serving spoiled food. Wont return"}
{"text":"My husband and I base most of our restaurant selections off of Yelp reviews. When we moved to the area Bangkok Thai seemed like a must! We love the Bangkok fried rice! Food and service is always amazing! I also love the Thai ice tea. This is definitely a place that will keep you coming back!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight for dinner. The place looked nice considering its in small strip plaza. I walked in & saw it was a quaint place decorated for Xmas. The other usual decor was Thai head dance gear along with paintings;traditionally nice. I waited for someone & looked for someone but they were busy serving food so I decided to take the table to my liking. I waited for another 10minutes before the girl finally noticed me. She was very friendly so I decided to stay. They have a an organized flow in a disorderly fashion to their serving & assisting people if that makes sense; but they are Slow! Slow to come slow to cook slow to serve. I ordered 2 appetizers, deep fried squid & lemon prawn soup. The squid was tasty not oily & simply prepared with a dipping sauce, arranged in rows which was cute. The soup was balanced well with salt n sourness. I waited for my chicken & shrimp pad Thai for 30 minutes. It was lacking chicken & shrimp, the portion was decent. The saving grace of this place is the food is very tasty, & friendly service. Oh and of course clean! Im giving the place 3 stars & not more cause of slow service & protein lacking in pad Thai. I think they have a lunch special which I'll come back & try. Ps the food smells amazing when you walk in."}
{"text":"One of my husbands co-workers, whose family is from Thailand, recommended this restaurant to us.  We know nothing about Thai food, so we figured someone from Thailand would probably know best how Thai food should taste.  We've gone here several times and more often than not have had a good experience.  I did have one meal that I didn't really care for and found bland (I can't remember what it was, but it had clear noodles), but everything else has been very good and flavorful.  It really depends on what you order. I've had the Bangkok In Love dish a couple times, and it is a definite favorite of mine.  I usually don't care for sweeter/rich dishes, but this was very addicting (my mom and husband have had it and loved it too).  Our last visit, my husband and I had their Pad Thai and loved it.  It was our favorite thing there so far.  They asked us how spicy we wanted it, which was nice since we have very different spice tolerances.  I will probably order that again the next time I go.  They give you a lot of food, and the prices are pretty reasonable and on par with other oriental restaurants.  The servers are very nice, and we've never had any mix up with our orders.  The restaurant is clean and nice, so don't let the outside hole-in-the-wall facade fool you."}
{"text":"It's been a while since my last visit but food remained to be very delicious here! We had lunch portions of basil fried rice and crazy noodle. It's a little too spicy for me so I think I'll do mild instead next time. Price is very affordable as well. Would recommend and would most likely return!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Cleveland. Their food is great and service is awesome. I have been visiting them for several years and didn't see any change in taste. My favorite dish here Crazy noodles and chicken himapan."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious and kind service. Pork crazy noodles a little spicy is my fav."}
{"text":"Sometimes you cant help getting high-headed when you have lots of praise. I wish I could separate today's experience out from the other good times I've had at this place. But today.. oh my...! We were served 3/4th of food in terms of quantity that we normally get. We ordered some curries, which typically ends in food being boxed. But today.. the food served was so less that .. forget boxing the food... we left not-filled and totally unsatisfied. The servers (or managers) even tried to rationalize why we were still hungry even after our meal.. someone suggested we were too hungry to begin with!!   So.. an otherwise 4.5* day got reduced to a 1*, thanks to arrogant service, less food served (without acknowledging that it was less food served) and nothing done to be a good hospitable place."}
{"text":"Awesome Thai food. I've heard good things about this place by word of mouth for years and we finally tried it. So delicious! I had the pad Thai 2 stars (heat) and my hubby had the Bangkok fried rice (3stars). His dish was a bit spicy for me but everything was seasoned just right."}
{"text":"Had a team luncheon there about 1/2 hour ago.  I must go back!  Great food, real nice service, just a totally enjoyable time.  Everything was cooked just right.  I'll drive from Medina for this experience."}
{"text":"This is my favorite thai place in the Cleveland area. I usually order the pad thai and have not been disappointed! The restaurant has parking out front, but be sure to enter the parking lot in the right direction! There's additional parking in the back as well. Inside, the decor features artwork from Thailand and has a darker color theme. The servers are attentive and food comes out fairly quickly.   Their pad thai is one of the best I've tasted. Each time I ordered, the noodles and sauce had great consistency. There is a bit of kick to their pad thai even in their \"mild\" flavor. The meats (chicken & shrimp) tastes fresh and flavorful. Be sure to add a splash of lemon juice in the noodles to balance out the sauces and spiciness!"}
{"text":"This is the areas best Thai food restaurant. Pad see we and pad bai gra pow are both outstanding. Coconut or mango homemade ice cream for dessert. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have had dinner at Bangkok Thai a few times with my book club - it's one of our favourite spots. I have had the Thai Basil chicken and the pineapple or chicken fried rice, both of which are very tasty. Service is great and portions are generous. My friend really enjoys the papaya salad and orders it every time we go. Most of the main dishes (curries, stir-fry, etc.) do not come with rice (as stated clearly on the menu) but it's too bad because the pricing would seem to indicate that it should be included. That's my only one tiny complaint but it's not an impediment to dining here."}
{"text":"We are huge fans of Thai food, and based on the rave reviews on Yelp, we stopped by for dinner at Bangkok Thai. Just walking into the restaurant, we were hit with an awful stench, which made us rethink our decision to dine in. Once we sat down, it took a while before someone took our orders, and also took about 40 mins for our 2 dishes to be served at our table. The noise level was more than an average restaurant, and stench level even worse. The saving grace was the Thai iced tea, which was one of the best we've had in the Cleveland area. Not going back here again, and always refer to a restaurant with good Yelp reviews which turn out otherwise as a \"Bangkok Thai\"."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant in an unassuming strip mall in Newmarket.   Seating was comfortable and the ambience was nice.   Service was prompt and friendly.  The pad thai was quite tasty but the portion size was definitely on the light side.  The pineapple curry was good but we found the curry a bit more watery than other places-we ended up drinking the sauce like soup :).   Lastly was the seafood noodle which was good in terms of taste and portion size.  The overall experience was quite positive and definitely worth a try when you are in Newmarket.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Having tried some other Thai restaurants in Cleveland, this restaurant has been one of the best! I've only tried the crispy tamarind chicken and the crazy noodles, but both were amazing.  They also serve Thai beer, which my friends loved!"}
{"text":"I have to disagree with the masses and say Bangkok Thai is definitely not my favorite. It's disappointing because I wanted to love this place, but just don't after a few tries. It's not bad food at any means, but when you've tried dozens of other Thai restaurants like I have, this place ranks a little low on both the flavors of their dishes and the style they're done in.  The Pad Thai I got on my first ever visit was strange with no flavor and I also got a vegetable soup that had the same situation going on. I vowed I would never go back because there's so many better options in the area, but fast forward a year later, I've tried it again.   This time I got the Pad See U and the highly rated vegetarian potstickers. I ate some and the leftovers sat in my refrigerator for a couple days before revisiting, which says a lot to me. The potstickers were more like mashed sweet potatoes with chunks of peanut in a deep fried wrapper which was not the vibe I got from the description.  I am once again vowing not to go back, which is too bad because I really did want to love this place! Service is very good and the restaurant is beautiful inside, but the food just didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere, it looks rather plain located in a strip mall, but you are surrounded by buddhas and elephants once you enter.   I ordered the zap beef as an appetizer and pad ped with chicken for the entree. The zap beef soup is a wonderful summary of Thai food, in a light soup form. The spice, the herbs, the freshness is all right there. As for the pad ped, it was such a wonderful dish, how many other Thai restaurants in Cleveland offer a dish with sliced galangal mixed right in?   The service is just as good as the food and atmosphere too.   I just moved in about 5 minutes down the road, so hopefully I can expand this review soon."}
{"text":"We ordered 4 different takeout dishes and the food was delicious.  Good size portions. Sauce was not too heavy. I'd eat from there again."}
{"text":"This is my favourite Thai restaurant and all of york region. Love their lunch specials. The food is always amazing and authentic . The service is great, David is so nice and friendly! I love that they always clarify my order to ensure my dietary requirements are met!"}
{"text":"I'm still on the search for Pad Thai that taste like Thailand. This place was close but no match. I will say that I enjoyed the Pad Thai and mango sticky rice very much. Also, the price is very good. It has a nice comfortable feel too. I set near the window enjoying good food on my lunch break and I didn't really want to go back to work."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this restaurant. As soon as we entered the restaurant we were immediately greeted by the waitress/host. She is extremely nice and accommodating. She makes you feel welcome. Restaurant itself looks and is very neat and clean. Very well maintained.   We were a group of six people. We ordered their chicken pad thai, mango salad, apple salad (i believe that's what it was called), an egg plant dish and two red curries. All of our dishes tasted amazing and we have tried many Thai restaurants all throughout Richmond Hill and Toronto. Personally I had the chicken pad thai and it was very delicious. It was not too watery or too oily, it was just right.   The waitress is very fast, clears your table quickly, checks up on you often and asks you how the food is, which is great.   The prices here are also very good and reasonable, especially considering what you get for what you pay. I will definitely come back and highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"First timer. Wanted to try Pad Thai as that is my decision maker with Thai restaurants. Instead, I opted for Crispy Noodles with Pork with number 3 Spicy and Gyoza apps.   I love spicy food and honestly, it was perfect! I probably could have gone 4 but for my first time, I wanted to taste the food. I was not disappointed! I cannot wait to have more dishes from there and someday, someday try the Pad Thai.   Go, eat, love. Isn't that a movie? Eat, Pray, Love- Bangkok Thai!"}
{"text":"While in Cleveland recently around lunchtime & getting hungry, I quickly went to Yelp to find a place to eat. I was pleased to see Bangkok  Thai was located very close to me. Located in a strip mall, it is easy to miss but worth a visit. I found the last parking space in front, but no worries as I spotted the sign for additional parking in back.  Inside, was a cozy place of maybe 20 tables. After being seated, I was quickly greeted and my drink order was taken while I was handed a menu. When my server returned with my drink, I had selected my order of Chicken Pad Thai.   My dish arrived in minutes! It was great. The chicken was tender and tasty. The heat was just right. Very filling and satisfying!"}
{"text":"When we lived in Stow, Pad Thai on 91 or 18 never let us down. Now that we're in Mayfield, this place is doing the job for us. We've been there 3 times and I'd say a fifth star is really just a matter of brightening up the room slightly. The quality of the food is nearly there. Very good. It's a bit outside my travel range for lunch but I intend to try that next."}
{"text":"Best pad thai in Cleveland, hands down. I'm always begging my friends to drive me here from CWRU just to get it lol. Order it with 2 or 3 stars of spice :) Portion size is pretty big; I always take my leftovers to eat for lunch the following day."}
{"text":"This is now my favorite restaurant. I've always loved Thai food, but this food is outstanding. I will be returning here a lot."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant on the Eastside thus far. I order the shrimp and chicken Crazy Noodles or the Mango Curry. My boyfriend loves the Pad Thai. Portions are huge and full of flavor. I knew there was a reason I liked this place. The owners are related to the owners of Sweet Mango in Strongsville which is my favorite Thai place on the Westside."}
{"text":"I moved to Cleveland from Queens, NY, so I was really worried about finding good Thai food here.  Queens is home to Sripraphai and Chao Thai, which are widely considered the best in NYC.  Also, I've worked in a Thai family-run restaurant, so I can be pretty picky about Thai food.  Bangkok Thai was a truly pleasant surprise.  If it were in NYC, I'd probably give it 4 stars (just because of the competition), but I believe it is hands-down the best Thai food in Cleveland.  I never feel like I'm missing out, and it satisfies my cravings.  The people are great; the food always delicious.  I go there as often as I can!"}
{"text":"The food is really good and the service was charming; very good value for money.  it is in a nondescript strip mall so the ambiance is OK.  We had masman curry and various other curries.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Best thai in Cleveland and possibly the US.  I travel a lot for business and often try Thai restaurants throughout the country.  While most are good, I have yet to find one as exceptional in taste and quality as Bangkok Kitchen right here in Lyndhurst, OH.  The curries and noodle dishes are all delicious and appetizers and soups are scrumptious.  No need to drive any further than Bangkok Thai for a delicious trip overseas."}
{"text":"The chicken and pork pad woon sen is by far my favorite dish. I eat here twice a month at least. Sometimes more."}
{"text":"I forced my wife and kids to come here to try something new. Everyone was in the mood for soup so we all started with different kinds of soup. I had the Tom Yum Goong. It was spicy and delicious. The lemongrass flavor really came through. One of my daughters got the chicken coconut soup. It was sweet but still had a nice flavor. My other daughter got the shrimp thai rice soup. This one was one of our favorites. It was similar to a normal chicken rice soup you would think of but the ginger taste came through and tasted wonderful.  For entrees we got the pad thai and the bangkok fried rice. I asked for the bangkok fried rice at a level 3 out of 4 and it was spicy but not so spicy my wife wouldn't eat it. The pad thai was great like others have mentioned. I think it's one of the best I've had here in Cleveland.  The dining area is small and it started to fill up by the time we left but it didn't feel cramped. I liked that it wasn't a huge place it gave it a warming more comfortable feeling. I highly recommend anyone to stop by and give it a try don't judge it just be the odd location."}
{"text":"Good, fast and cheap...3 things I like in my restaurants.  I've only gone for lunch and had take out here so I can't comment on the dinner menu..but judging by the lunch one this place is GOOD.  I generally pick from the lunch specials which are under $10.  With that you get soup/egg roll/main dish which for me is perfect.   How can you possibly go wrong with that.  There is a nice kick to the dishes - but not overtly spicy....which if you are eating for lunch and then have to go back to the office - well that's a good thing!  This restaurant is pretty big inside so great for groups.  It's clean and all the staff are super friendly.  I always get their Lunch specials so don't know if they have more variety for dinner.  It's a great Thai option in Newmarket...but it's not the best Thai I have had."}
{"text":"Nice food, I usually eat only vegetarian and the staff is helpful in making most of the dishes vegetarian even if not mentioned in the menu. Highly recommend trying out this place."}
{"text":"We've been going here since they were in University Heights. Food is very good, service great and friendly"}
{"text":"I was looking for takeout in the area and decided to give Bangkok a shot.   The chicken pad thai might honestly be the best I've ever had - they even accommodated my request for a bit of added spice (it comes with zero unless you ask for it), and at a '1' out of '1 to 4' spice level, it was just perfect.  Service, both over the phone and in person, was friendly and prompt.  10/10 recommendation."}
{"text":"Wow, good Thai close to home, that could be dangerous.  I can not believe I have never tried this place.  I guess I may have been put off by the name, sounds so commercial.   Oh how wrong was I!   I only got one dish and a soup and it was pretty dam good.  Lets start with the tom yum goong. It was very good there was plenty lemon grass and just enough cilantro.  Please put more shrimp in the soup. Please, please,please two is not enough.   Next the Thai Basil with ground chicken.  Yeah I should have gotten the pork, because we all know that pork is more gooder : )  The chicken was still really good. I asked for it Thai spicy. No, 3 stars out of 3 stars for spicy is not enough.  I heard the really sweet woman who waited on me tell someone something in what I think was  not English, and I knew it would have a kick,  I was not disappointed. I finished half the  portion and chugged a bottle of water. Nice. I am going to attempt to prepare this at home.  Great job Bangkok Thai. Keep it up. I shall return.  One night in Bangkok and the tough guys tumble  Can't be too careful with your company  I can feel the devil walking next to me"}
{"text":"Damn good Thai food, probably your best bet on the east side. Service is attentive, timely, and friendly. Prices are just right. Decor is surprisingly quaint and welcoming given the unbecoming exterior.   We ordered pad thai and mango curry with chicken. There is a lot of talk about Bangkok Thai having some of the best pad thai on the east side, and after having eaten here a couple times, I'd say the hype is legit. It's hard to get the combination of flavors just right with pad thai, but I think Bangkok nails it or at least comes closer than anything on Coventry or Lee. The portions are pretty good too.  As for the mango curry with chicken, I think it stole the show for me. I rarely deviate from my usual, safe order of pad thai, and I am not a fan of Thai curry in general, but after tasting my girlfriend's mango curry, I traded my beloved pad thai with her and proceeded to inhale the rest of her dish. Easily the best mango curry I've tried anywhere, and it was a couple bucks less than other restaurants.  I think I found a winner here, and I'll be back to try more menu items.  Protip: Try the Singha Thai beer. It just became my new favorite beer."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious.  I've like many dishes here like the panang curry, holy basil, red curry and mango sticky rise.  Peppermint thai is also very good with a nicer atmosphere.   The price range is 12-20$. This one of better Thai restaurants in Cleveland.  The restaurant is pretty small, seats about 20 people and theres a tight parking lot.  Check their hours before going the close relatively early."}
{"text":"Good service.  But, food was sub par.  Not very flavorful or fresh.  Decor looked hurriedly put up.  Bad odor of paint or some such.  Table was sticky before we sat down."}
{"text":"I really owe this place an update. I went there on the busy Family day weekend. We were greeted relatively quickly but it took them some time to find us a spot. I wasn't surprised since the restaurant looked super busy and many of the tables hadn't been cleared up. I guess they were short staffed.  We got a complimentary order of Chicken Spring Rolls. They were delicious! So crispy, light and packed with a punch of great flavours. They tasted even better with the sweet, sour and spicy sauce. I ordered the Shrimp Fried rice. I loved the garlicky taste....the shrimp was cooked perfectly. The Mixed Seafood Basil was also very nicely done and had loads of shrimp, mussels and squid along with plenty of veggies. Another dish we tried was the Crispy Basil Chicken which was a winner as well. The food was incredible. It was lighter than many of the other thai restaurants which put loads of grease and heavy cocunut milk in their dishes. At the same time they had a pretty huge portion...enough for us to take home for another meal. So don't worry, you wouldn't leave this place feeling hungry.  I know that in my last review I compared them to SukhoThai but it absolutely doesn't make sense now. The food is equally fabulous and much more reasonably priced. Also, this is a restaurant where the customer is king! They won't leave you waiting at the front for more than 30 mins just to get you seated.   The owner Vi was super friendly and chatty. She really cares about all the customers. I mentioned that I would love it if they put some lemon grass in the curries. She assured me that the next time I order she would make a special request to the chef to include lemongrass in it. I was really impressed.   Here's another example of the impeccable service we received that night. My husband forgot to tell them that he likes his curry spicy and when the food was delivered we asked them if they could give us some chilli sauce. However, the owner is so awesome, she offered to get it done properly. They redid the curry with the spicy chillies and it was at our table in no time. Of course, it also helped that we were the only ones left in the restaurant.  Everything about this restaurant from food, ambiance to service deserves 5 stars. I can't wait to go back and try other dishes from their menu!!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Bangkok for great Thai food for 10 years since they were on Warrensville Ctr in S Euclid.  Back then, and still today I have found you can pick anything on the menu and it will be delicious.  Their service is equally superb, and the food is very consistent.  Good date night pick."}
{"text":"Really good Thai cuisine. Moderately priced, service is excellent and the staff very friendly. The coconut soup is a must have."}
{"text":"After reading several rave reviews, we decided to try Bangkok Thai, and found ourselves disappointed when leaving. Our server was attentive, though almost disingenuous with her level of enthusiasm.  We both ordered soup as appetizers, Zap Beef and Vegetable Tofu, and they were truly delicious. My friend was very pleased with his entree of Pepper Beef, and I wish I could say the same for my Green Curry. It was watery and bland. I left most of it and the server didn't seem to care why. My friend took his leftovers, which our server took to the back to package. When she returned, it was clear that she left off at least half of what he had remaining, which is just careless and lazy. It finalized our decision not to return again."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood restaurant.  Good service, friendly staff.  Definitely worth it if you live nearby.  We liked everything we had on our first visit: Chicken coconut soup, Chicken Satay, Pad Thai.  The shrimp in the Pad Thai were plump and delicious.  I give it 3 stars because my 5 star Thai restaurant in the area is Peppermint, and Bangkok is not quite there, but close!  Could use a better wine by the glass list.  But over all we were pleased with our meal and would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"The Bangkok fried rice and crazy noodles are our go-to! Sooo delicious, generous portion sizes and quick easy takeout on the yelp app :)"}
{"text":"I've always driven past this place and wondered about it. No need to wonder if it's good anymore. Walking in, it looks like a regular Asian restaurant. Gangly decor and kind of comforting to me for some reason. Made me feel good about eating here.   We started off with bowls of tom yum soup. First of all, the bowls of soup are much larger than I've gotten anywhere else, so this was a plus. Flavor was great, but I think they could have had more vegetables in it. The broth/veg ratio was definitely off. All they had in there were mushrooms and the shrimp along with bits of lemongrass. Kind of skimpy on the vegetables all around I thought. They aren't so expensive...so what's a few more to help fill up the bowl? Eh. Oh well, I was hungry.   Entrees: panang curry and pad see ew. The curry was ok, could have been spicier for my taste. Also lacked a little flavor, but otherwise acceptable. Plenty of veggies here- string beans, baby corn, red peppers, carrots. Pad see ew- was meh. Noodles weren't fresh...in fact they were hard/chewy. The flavor was pretty good but really, the noodle texture didn't make a good impression on me. Again for this dish, they were scant on the vegetables. Few bits of broccoli. Mushrooms were there, but they don't stand out against the color of the noodles.   Service was very friendly. Waitress was nice and provided good customer service.   So bottom line...would I return? Just maybe if I'm in the neighborhood. It's decent enough."}
{"text":"After almost more than 15 visit, this time was worst experience we had. Really bad attitude even in start while taking order. Food was all burnt, and was smelling really bad. More over they were not ready to accept that. Instead kept on telling that we were hard to handle. Worst restaurant experience of my life. Never gonna be back to this place again."}
{"text":"Hands down favorite Thai restaurant in Cleveland. The service is excellent. The ambience is wonderful with beautiful decor. The food is delicious with a great selection of Thai dishes."}
{"text":"Bear in mind, I probably have 50 lunch visits under my belt, so I may be a bit biased, but Bangkok is consistently excellent. Staff is always on top of things and the food is amazing. I always want to get more adventurous with the menu, but by the time I get there and smell the food, I usually end up going back to my tried and true favorites, which are any of the fried rice dishes or curries."}
{"text":"This is our favourite place to eat Thai food. We love the basil beef and crispy basil chicken...so much that we get it every single time. It's fresh with delicious flavours and good sized portions. I like getting it not spicy because I find it almost too hot otherwise. I like to be able to really taste those flavours and not be too overwhelmed with the heat. We also love the chicken Thai spring rolls and the fresh spring rolls for appetizers. We often get take-out but the restaurant itself has an authentic atmosphere and very friendly staff. The prices are also quite reasonable. This is definitely a favourite place in my books!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with a friend and former colleague, and could kick myself for living and working so close for 7 years and just now trying it for the first time.  I had the coconut chicken soup, which was like nothing I've ever had before, but positively delightful.  I also had the crispy basil chicken, but I asked for it to be 3 stars of spicy (out of a possible 4) where it normally comes as 1 star (or maybe 2, I don't remember).  And unlike any other Asian restaurant I've ever patronized, it came out the right amount of hot (it is NEVER hot, despite the warnings).  Intensely delicious, an absolute wallop of flavor overwhelmed me.  And mid-way through my properly portioned lunch dish, I was breathing a little heavy and my nose was running.  Yet, the complexity of the flavors remained through all of it.  This is the perfect kind of spicy.  Heat, for the sake of heat, is a waste.  I left, feeling satisfied and full, but not stuffed, for a reasonable price, and in good time.  Oh, I was there for 90+ minutes, but that was just time catching up.  Our service was prompt and friendly.  Can't wait to start taking some home after work and making this a more regular lunch stop!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I don't go often enough, but when I do, I order the drunken chicken (I think it's called)... number 5 spicy! I love it! Can't get enough :)"}
{"text":"Very average Thai food. Sub-average, actually. Service was good and friendly, but the food lacked subtlety or complexity. The seafood curry I had was hot enough, but pretty much a one note dish, which wasn't helped by being soupy. Perhaps they were using canned coconut milk, the dish just lacked substance. Dumplings for an appetizer were good, but again very plain."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant while searching good thai restaurants in town. Good Yelp reviews made my choice easier. And, no surprise, I have just to give another 5 stars to this awesome place!  Firstly, their customer service was excellent. Our waitress (sorry I missed your name) was so delightful, she made us feel so warm and welcoming. She very well explained the dishes that we had questions about. She even suggested us what spice level would go well with our ordered dishes based on our taste buds, which turned out was a brilliant suggestion. Very happy with her service!! We ordered Bangkok fried rice, crazy noodle, massaman curry and thai tea. Bangkok fried rice comes with shrimp, crispy fried chicken, eggs and few veggies. Its good enough, in fact great enough to be eaten without any side dish. As suggested by our waitress, we ordered crazy noodles with a spice level of 5. It is crazy indeed (crazy good) with a 5 spice! If you love spicy food, you must try this crazy noodle as spicy as you can! :-) Massaman curry was good too, it was mild and was a very balanced dish. Loved their thai tea, would just request light sweetness next time I'm there.  Their seating area comprises of both booth and table seating. The seating area is a tad bit tighter, still once seated I felt comfortable though."}
{"text":"Thai food must not be Cleveland's thing. At times, I wondered if I was eating a meal or a bowl of sugar. Everything was overly sweetened and although the portions were generous, I did not enjoy my duck curry or my coconut soup as much as I would have liked."}
{"text":"I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this place before since we go there all the time.  This is my favorite Thai restaurant in the Cleveland area.  Their crazy noodles are fantastic.  The pineapple fried rice is also very good.  For something different, try the Pad Ped.  It's fantastic.  They will make things very spicy for you, if you're into that. They can also make almost anything vegetarian or vegan.  Oh, the mango curry is super tasty too.  The service is usually very good."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food!  Had the Tom Yum with Shrimp and their version of Kee Mao Gai - they call the dish \"Crazy Noodles.\"  The place was rather empty on a Tuesday night when I first arrived, I sat and ordered my food, several other customers then came in to pick up \"to-go\" orders.  The Tom Yum soup was okay - not as spicy as I would like, but acceptable. However, the Crazy Noodles were crazy good! Rich, succulent, spicy, and delicious. The carrots, broccoli and what I thought was spinach - combined with the sauce - was really scrumptious!  They don't accept American Express here. Visa, MasterCard, cash or cash is accepted.  I'd definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai of all the places I have tried (about 10). A must try is the Bangkok Fried Rice! Also the Pad See Eu and the Crazy Noodles are amazing. I have been told that the Green Tea ice cream is a must, but I have yet to try it."}
{"text":"This is a great little place. The service is great and they have a sweet potato curry dish that is delish. Cute atmosphere too."}
{"text":"I got the Pad See Ew, and it was below average.  The beef was very dry.  The worst part was it was $13 just for the Pad See Ew.  That is really really expensive for a weak Pad See Ew.  I would go there much more often if it was $9-$10."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant. Authentic Thai cuisine with plenty of flavor.  Family owned and operated. The service is friendly and congenial."}
{"text":"Bangkok Thai is my favorite restaurant in Cleveland. I eat here at least once a week and debate stopping in at least twice more.  Best thai food I've ever had and it is so consistent. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Considering that I can walk to Bangkok Thai, I'm not sure why I haven't already reviewed it.    Overall, in the dozen times I've been there, the food has been very good.  I've tried just about everything on the vegetarian menu and haven't found anything I don't really like.  (I do LOVE the pine nut stir fry - although they're out of pine nuts fairly often.)  Had the masaman curry on my most recent visit and it was just ok.  I'm hoping it was just a fluke of a meal.  The restaurant was busier than I've ever seen it (I actually had to wait for a table which made me happy for the business owners), so maybe the kitchen staff was overwhelmed?  An important note to people who can't get to Bangkok Thai as easily as I can.  They tend to change their hours on what seems like a whim, so you might want to call before you stop by.  I can never really keep their lunch hours or days straight myself because they're always changing.  And don't bother looking for a web site with a menu.  They don't have one.  (although a little Google-ing goes a long way and some other sites have pictures of the menu posted)"}
{"text":"Got the Crazy Noodles with Seafood.  Great Lent Option.   And super flavor as usual.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"I'd have to agree with my yelp friend Rachael N. on this.  For all the good reviews, this place was very disappointing.  I came here with three friends, and they conveniently ordered three Pad Thais, with spiciness levels 5 (max spice), 3, and, 1 (no spice), for my reviewing pleasure.  I ordered the Pad See Ew.  We all did not enjoy our meals. 1) Pad Thai, spicy level 5 - My friend loves spice and she found it to her taste.  However, it was way too salty!  Whatever was making her noodles spicy also overwhelmed it with salt. 2) Pad Thai, spicy level 3 - Also, good level of spiciness, but found it too sweet. 3) Pad Thai, spicy level 1 - Same thing.  Way too sweet.  The noodles were nice and moist, but the tanginess of the sauce was just too strong. 4) Pad See Ew - My dish was way too salty, probably because there was too much soy sauce in the dish.  Also, the noodles weren't cooked well - in fact, some of them were burnt.  Conclusion: They pack a ton of flavor into their dishes.  So much that it really overwhelms you."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Cleveland!  We moved here 8 years ago from California and had given up on finding a great Thai option in town. A friend told us about Bangkok Thai a few years ago and we've been coming back ever since. Great curries, chicken satay, golden rolls, pad Thai, emerald noodles, and Devil of the Sea soup. We've never had a bad meal and the service is always excellent. A fantastic find in an unassuming location!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years, and I absolutely adore! I'm especially a fan of their fish in curry sauce, the peanut filled crispy dumplings, and the black rice with mango dessert."}
{"text":"Omg where do i even begin? I love love loveeee this place! The service is by far the best i have ever had in my life. They are always smiling and so super friendly. And i have been coming here for 5 years and is never disappointed. Now lets talk about the food....panang curry with pork is my go to! Now if you like spicy, this is the place! They do not play! My boyfriend always get their Pad Thai with 2 stars spice and it is the best combo. Their pad thai is so goood! Another thing to try is their Tamarind Fish! The crispy fish and the tamarind sauce is very good! If you are in the area, this is a must try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to go there all the time. We love their Bangkok in Love, emerald noodles and pad Thai. We frequent every Thai restaurant in Cleveland and they have the BEST tom Kha gai (chicken coconut soup) in all of Cleveland."}
{"text":"There is not one bad item on the menu. Best pad Thai in the area in my opinion. Always fresh. Very tasty."}
{"text":"Bangkok Thai is a fine gem located on the east side. I have been here several times and each experience has been pleasant.  The menu has a nice variety apps, noodles and rice dishes to choose from. The spicy dishes have a strength option of 1 to 4 stars.  Go for 4 stars if you have the courage to. My spice threshold here is 2 stars and I really like spicy food.   On this visit I enjoyed the Bangkok Fried Rice which had lots of spice and ample bits of chicken.  A tasty portion of crispy fried chicken is served on the side.   On other visits I have enjoyed the Pad Thai and Crazy Noodles."}
{"text":"This place has delicious Thai food. Love it. Their Chai tea is amazing too. Nice little place to have dinner. Kind, responsive, professional servers."}
{"text":"Arrive for lunch at around 11:50AM. The dishes and drinks ordered were fairly decent. Definitely not a blow-my-mind taste experience, but good enough to fill up on for lunch. Actually, I would have to say my favorite item ordered was my Thai Iced Tea. My Pad Thai was well made, but had no spicy-ness to counteract the sweetness. I even added extra dried chili peppers, but they did nothing. Thai food that is not spicy is a negative to me!  Items ordered: Thai Iced Tea, Thai Lemon Tea, Pad Tofu Triangles, Pad Thai, and Yellow Curry and Pineapple."}
{"text":"Go with the crazy noodles. Great flavor. Not the best Thai I've ever had, but definitely one of the better Asian places on the east side of Cleveland. Pad Thai is also very good. Be warned, the level 3 spicy is very spicy!"}
{"text":"a bit of a newcomer to the Thai food scene .. I do not enjoy coconut or anything too spicy but friends assured me that the staff at this place would make sure that I ordered something I would enjoy since I do like other Asian fare .. the waitress could not have been more helpful .. she helped steer me towards something different rather than pad thai or fried rice & I really enjoyed what she recommended .. saw a lot of things on the menu that I would also like to try in the future (same for my husband) so we will be back .. they make a point on the menu of giving no refunds if you order something too spicy w/out discussing heat preference w/the staff yet the couple behind us both complained about the sweet taste of their pad thai (which is notoriously a sweet dish) & they got it removed from their bill so I wonder .. if you order something too spicy no refund but if you order something too sweet no charge? .. go figure .."}
{"text":"Ate here twice.  The first time, the food was very flavorful, with very nice presentation.  Second time, sure the food looked pretty, but it was bland and the noodles we got weren't that great.  So averaging out my two experiences, I give Bangkok Thai 3 stars."}
{"text":"One thing to keep in mind--there are up charges. While the food is spectacular, they will hit you for the little things. For instance, I wanted my pad thai half chicken/half shrimp.  This was a $4.00 up-charge.  There were 4 pieces of shrimp included in my pad thai. Despite the flavors, I just can't justify paying $1.00 for a baby shrimp! Extra refills or switching from Hot to cold tea will also be extra charges."}
{"text":"The Mango Curry here may change your life.  Wow.  At the suggestion of a previous review, I ordered this dish, and I cannot thank said Yelper enough!  The dish was colorful and so unbelievably flavorful.  Tender white chunks of chicken, fresh tasty mango, assorted veggies, and an incredible mango/coconut curry.  Do not even look at the rest of the menu, this is the dish you need.  The service was attentive and quick to provide refills.  I also tried a thai iced coffee, which was standard, but so delicious.  The restaurant is clean, well decorated, and was pretty busy on the Saturday evening I attended. We visit my boyfriend's family often, and have tried several Thai restaurants on the Eastside, and this is definitely my favorite so far!"}
{"text":"Went there with friends ordered a thai tea and Chicken crazy noodles.  1. Chicken crazy were decent.  2. The red thai curry that we got home was weird. 3. Thai tea was nice."}
{"text":"We had a Bangkok Cuisine back in Michigan. Is this the same? Not sure, but it was almost just as good. Almost. Best Thai we've found in the area, though, and will for sure be going back.   Price was right. Carry out rocks...and it's Thai food. Who doesn't like Thai food?"}
{"text":"We ordered the \"Appetizer For 2\", Chicken Basil Fried Rice and Shrimp Pad Kee Mao. All the dishes were tasty especially the Chicken Fried Rolls and Fried Rice. I found the \"Pad Kee Mao\" tasty but slightly oily and also the noodles were not the flat ones which are typically used but more like the ones used in Pad Thai. Of course all that does not matter if the food is tasty which it was."}
{"text":"Here's a gem tucked away in the stripmall mayhem that is Mayfield Rd.  Although I have been only once, my nephew swears by the place.  Beautiful presentation, tastefully prepared and reasonably priced.  Family owned and operated.  I really enjoyed the appetizer called \"Bang-Bang\".  Looked like pita bread, but actually a dough with chicken and shrimp in the batter.  Addictive.  We also had a very good Pad Thai, a spectacular fried tofu/green curry/coconut entree`, freid rice and dumplings.  All were nicely done.  Looking forward to exploring this menu more.  Prices top out at 16 bucks."}
{"text":"I found this because my parents disowned on the street where this restaurant was, it was a fantastic place to go into and get adopted from"}
{"text":"The staff here are really friendly and very nice.  I have gotten take-out here twice and I was happy both times.  I got the Crazy (drunken) noodle with tofu and I've also had their chicken spring rolls.  Both are really yummy, hit the spot and will keep me coming back for more.  I am also glad to see they have Chiang Mai Noodles (Khao Soi) on their menu.  This dish, in my experience, is difficult to find.  I can't wait to try that next!"}
{"text":"Good variety and despite being there during a slammed lunch rush, the food and service were both good.  The soups are great!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Pad Thai I have ever tasted. Also the Crispy tamarind chicken has a relly nice spicy and sweet tangerine sauce. This place is a must try for lunch or dinner"}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food on Mayfield rd to be sure, It's sort of a living legend round these parts. I highly recommend drunken noodle If you're binge watching Making a Murderer on Netflix (Steve Avery is definitely innocent- there was no blood splatter for god sakes), anyway, the food is great, the Wisconsin justice system, not so much."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai food I have ever had. I will travel out of my way, for Bangkok Thai. I live in Toronto but will make the trip for this food!  Must have is the Pad Thai. And the Chicken Cashew!  I love it! A must have!"}
{"text":"Reasonable Thai food for Cleveland.  Tom Yum soup is tasty, but not quite as strongly flavored as I'm used to having. Pad Thai was a little too peanut-buttery for our taste, and the green curry was extremely rich. Portions were generous, though, and shrimp and vegetables were fresh and well-prepared. Mango with black sticky rice dessert was delicious, and probably the best part of the meal!"}
{"text":"Moving here from Seattle, I have a really high standard for any Asian Food. My fiance and I went here not expecting much. The inside is decorated really nice. The first time we went the waitress wasn't great, but we have had better service as time goes on. The food is REALLY REALLY good. Try the steamed dumplings and the ginger chicken. We live on the Westside of Cleveland and we will drive just for the food."}
{"text":"There are only a few places on the east coast that serve Shrimp in the Blanket. I'm glad this place serves it as well. For any Shrimp lover's out there..give it a try.l...One of my fave appz. Another dish I love is Thai Basil fried rice.  No matter who is cooking, the flavor is consistent visit after visit. That 's a big thing for me. The zap soup is niiiiice! Lemongrass flavor. If want a little more than miso soup, give Zap a try.  I've been fortunate to have go to spot like this. The staff is great - attentive, cordial, and know their menu. The food, for me, is great. I've  been eating here since 2014 or maybe a little earlier."}
{"text":"1st time and very impressed! Everything was delicious and will definitely be going back for more.  We did take-out and had pad thai, emerald noodles, Bangkok fried rice, orange chicken and thai vegetarian gyozas."}
{"text":"There is new ownership in place here since I first started coming here, the food is just as good, as the new owner says she hired the cooks of the previous owners.   I knocked off one star only because I have noticed the portions are a bit smaller. My last visit I was here after the sign said they were open, but no one was here, just as we gave up a cook showed up, unfortunately she couldn't take our order because she didn't speak English, and the person I was assuming was the new owner showed up ten minutes or so later. Other than that the meal was still fantastic."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant with fair prices and excellent food.  I enjoy thai food, and this low profile place does the trick. Fast service, relatively small, place with attentive wait staff.  Just spicy enough."}
{"text":"I've been looking for great authentic Thai food and found it at Bangkok Thai. We ordered the spring rolls, shrimp wraps, pad Thai, and beef broccoli stir fry. We were pleased with the quality of all our dishes and the service."}
{"text":"Driving down Mayfield, you wouldn't expect this strip mall joint to be memorable or outstanding, but one meal here, and I've learned not to judge a book by its cover!  I ordered steamed chicken dumplings as an appetizer, which I highly recommend to anyone. They're plain on their own, but the dipping sauce added to texture and flavor of the dumpling, turning a simple item into a flavorful appetizer.   I went with a group of friends so I was able to sample several items in addition to my own order. The chicken spring rolls were perfectly fried and savory.   My main dish was the Chicken Massamun Curry. The spice level was perfect, the sweet potatoes were unexpectedly essential to the  dish, and the chicken was tender and juicy. The simmering coconut milk base was rich with flavor and spice. I also tried some of my friend's Pad Thai. As a standard dish on which to judge a Thai restaurant, this classic delivered on its expectations.   The place could improve on its cleanliness, but we were also seated towards the back, so it may not be a fair assessment on the establishment's cleanliness as a whole. Overall, while the menu lacks diversity, the restaurant excels at the dishes they do prepare. Amazing Thai food, definitely one of the best places I've experienced."}
{"text":"Delicious food and great service. I had the pad thai and my husband had the curry duck. Both were delicious and the server was spot on. My one recommendation would be to change the menu covers. They are a satin type material that obviously haven't been washed in many moons. A cleanable plastic menu cover would be much better and cleaner. We enjoyed our meals very much."}
{"text":"Omg this place is the bomb! Hidden treasure in Cleveland :) I recommend the Pad See Ew!!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is about 4 blocks from my house so my family and I get food here pretty often, mostly take out.  The sweet potato gyozas are our favorite. The portions are huge so bring your appetite!  They probably have the best pad Thai in Cleveland.  The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is that on 2 occasions, they forgot a portion of our order which they always apologized for and made it up to us."}
{"text":"Had a great meal here around lunch time.  Quaint little place, very unassuming. No frills but good enough for great food, no real ambiance, but not distractingly so...and very clean. Small place, but would be fine for a group of 8 during an off-time.  GREAT food, and made to order exactly as requested (omitting some ingredients, custom heat level, etc.)   Very affordable, full meal around $7.50 plus beverage. Quality of ingredients was very good as well. Everyone at our table seemed to really love their menu choices (6 of us).   Waitress was pleasant, friendly, quick and out of the way when appropriate.  Can't beat it, can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I love this place! They are friendly, the food is great, the drinks are great, the black rice custard is perfection! I personally recommend the green noodle curry (probably not the real name for it).  It's one that is good when you get it and even better the next day (if you manage not to eat it all at one. A difficult feat.)"}
{"text":"Great local restaurant. We do mostly take out, but have dined in a few times. Quick service, for both take out and dining in."}
{"text":"By far my fav thai place in Cleveland.Since 3 years I go at least once a week to this restaurant. I have tried most of their dishes and love all of them especially their 'Pad Thai'. Staff is very friendly and the food comes very quickly. Overall a very nice place to try for sure!"}
{"text":"I love that the food here is very authentic. The place is not as big or nice looking, but I usually notice that that smaller the place the better the food taste. It's not always true but due to my experience of going out to eat, I can say that . I love the chicken sauté, Pad Thai, Basil fried rice , Penang curry, mango sticky rice and best of all is the fried ice cream ! It caught my attention so that's the only picture I have for this place is the fried ice cream ."}
{"text":"This is place has the best beef drunken noodle everrrrrr! Their pad thai is also not bad! The chicken satay is average, but the spring rolls were good. The waiter was really indifferent. He barely said a word. I do recommend coming here, just for the drunken noodles and pad thai."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite restaurants ever! My two favorite things to order are the crazy noodles and the pad Thai. The shrimp in a blanket appetizer is great as well. The service is great and usually fast. I have gotten takeout countless times as well. Pretty much the only Thai restaurant I will go to now and I've tried a bunch in the Cleveland area, this being the best so far! I come every time I'm back in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem!  The exteriors within the shopping strip is unassuming, but the interiors transport you to Thailand.  We arrived for dinner shortly after dinner opening hours and the restaurant had several dinner parties already.  I agree with previous reviews that the staff is very nice. You definitely get the feeling that this restaurant is a family-owned and operated business, which is my favorite kind of restaurants.    1. Beef satay - comes with 4 skewers, peanut sauce, vinegar/cucumber dip.   The meat is tender and not tough.  I wished the flavoring was a bit stronger, but it's not bad overall  2. Basil fried rice + chicken - the addition of the button mushroom is excellent for me. We didn't adjust the spice level and the spicy-ness was just right.  The kick was there but you could still enjoy the dish without gulping down water after every bite!   3. Crazy noodles + chicken - I ordered this dish based on numerous previous photos/reviews.  The flat rice noodles stir fried is excellent.  I can see why this dish a favorite for so many because it's definitely mine.  I'll be coming back.  There are several other items on the menu that I would like to try."}
{"text":"My daughter eats there all the time so she asked me to try it so I did. When I called and place the order I told them I was allergic two fish and mushrooms and they told me what I could order so when I got there I found out that my order was in  fish sauce, so the manager came over and was extremely polite and told me he would make my food I trusted him and did not look which was my fault but the other food that I had ordered was cold by the time I got home and then when I open up my food there was shrimp in it. So not only did they get the order wrong once they did it again and I had nothing to eat and my daughter's food was cold. I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some Thai again, with my now former co-worker, Mark.  We thought we'd try this place again because it was very good the last time.  On this trip, we were promptly seated and our drink orders were taken.  The lunch menu was pretty big with appetizers, entrees, and fried rice dishes to choose from.  We both decided to go with Pad Thai for $7.95.  The waitress asked us how spicy we wanted it and we both said, \"Just a little\", using hand gestures to indicate as well.  Within 10 minutes, a hot, steaming plate of noodles was before us!   It was nice to chat with Mark, since we don't talk much since he left the company.  Hi Mark!  (He reads my Yelp! reviews.)  Back to the Pad Thai.  After squeezing a fresh lime over the dish, it still had very little kick to it, so we agreed to ask for some hot sauce.  The waitress returned with a cup and a spoon of dry rub and a bottle of red sauce.  I tasted the sauce and it was mild.  So we sprinkled a little of the dry spices on the dish and it immediately hopped up on the Scoville scale.    It was a very tasty dish, but both plates only had two pieces of shrimp.  Both of us would have liked a little more shrimp.  There was plenty of chicken though.  I really liked the dish.  This was my first time ever eating Pad Thai and it wasn't what I was expecting.  Maybe if I get it a more upscale restaurant?  I'll bet some places go nuts with this dish.  I would definitely order it again, but it would have been nice to have a small side dish of some sort along with the Pad Thai.  Recommend!"}
{"text":"Wow. I came in here on lunch today and I have to say that this is the best Pad Thai I have ever had."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant on the first visit. Prompt service and great food.  The atmosphere was nice and not your typical Asian decor. The menu was extensive and items reasonably priced. I would go back in a minute!"}
{"text":"I LIVE for Bangkok Thai Cuisine's Chicken Pad Thai. They balance out the flavors of the dish perfectly here and the portion sizes are amazing. My first time as Bangkok I ordered take out, and one order lasted me almost three separate meals - and it reheated so well! The chicken is cooked to perfection and you can order different spice levels depending on how you like it (I tend to stay pretty mild). Because I had such a great experience the first time my Mom and I went back and ate in for dinner. The portion was just as big when you eat in and tasted even better. I seriously have dreams about eating this Pad Thai. Now it's our go-to place for whenever we get that craving! They have an abundance of menu options that I would like to explore more of as well. Love it here!"}
{"text":"Oh dear goodness, how in the world does this place have good reviews?  This place is not that good. I mean, don't get me wrong- the decor is pretty and it seems like it would be good. My co-worker and I have been meaning to try this place, so as it is just right around the corner from me, off we went to get some thai food.  We ordered thai tea to start off with. It came out not even concentrated..and slightly watery. Huh?  We ordered the pad thai (classic americanized thai food, right?) and I got some curry noodles, and it took like 30+ minutes just to get it. In the meantime, the waitress plopped the wrong food down in front of us. I had to be like, \"umm.. that's not ours?\"  Our noodles came out....and it was unflavorful, not spicy, and the noodles were bad quality. And where was the meat? Ugh.  I don't understand... I wasn't a fan at all. There are much better places here in CLE..."}
{"text":"This place is kinda isolated from other asian food area, but Im overall glad to find this place. I have start with the statement that their service was great and their entree and dessert were great but the appetizer really turned me off.   We ordered shrimp in the blanket and the shrimp looked so small. I took a bite and it tasted very shrimpy or fishy. I was not sure why and then i took a look at my shrimp, it was not even cooked. Perfectly cooked shrimp will have this pink skin on the outside with easily separated meat strands, not too dry, not too hard but very bounce. The shrimp that I had in the blanket was raw appearing. the skin was still gray. the meat was transparent. That was a little disgusting. When the waitress came and ask us how it was going. I was going to tell her that the shrimp was raw but she didn't give us a chance to say anything. Seems like she's just checking for the sake of checking. Don't get me wrong, she's very friendly but just it didn't seem genuine.  The entree was very good, which made up for my disappointment. We ordered bankok duck and the pad thai. They were both on the sweet side but the bankok duck was very crispy. Perfectly done. We also ordered the mango rice dessert. It was cold cut mango on top of hot sticky rice with coconut milk for garnish. It was great. Large portion too.  Overall, a good place to go if you are a simple person and just needed an entree. but I thought the appitizer was a failure and I didn't expect that kind of technical error to happen in a restaurant that's charging a decent amount of money for their food."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai Restaurant  in Cleveland. I visit them once in every two months. They are friendly, the food is great. I am big fan of their crazy noodle, pad thai, Bangkok Fried rice, Chicken himmapan."}
{"text":"The best Thai in Newmarket...very nice dining room, friendly service, full menu & tasty food!"}
{"text":"Ordered tofu triangles, pad thai, coconut soup.  Employee was very nice. Food was horrible. Tofu was so greasy and soaked with oil it was as if it had soaked in oil overnight. Pad thai was dry, flavorless, and somehow kind if greasy.  Coconut soup was like a can of coconut milk dumped over raw tofu. Inedible. I feel bad writing such a terrible review, but I threw the food out."}
{"text":"This place looks like a hole in the wall from the outside, but that sometimes is the best restaurants.   In this case, it is.    The restaurant is small and we had a wait to eat there.   Luckily, the yelp reviews, helped us be patient and stay.  The seats in waiting area were pretty comfortable.   I am glad we did.  The food was excellent.   The only comment I have, is I wish that it was a bit spicier and that they ask you a spice level (something that many do).   My veggies were still crispy (I had a red curry).    My husband got a seafood dish and he said that it was amazing as well.   It is tricky to park.   The best thing is to park in the back and go through the back door.   this place also does take-out, which might be an option if there are no tables."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my appetizers here. Service was courteous and attentive. I had fish with ginger sauce and Pad Thai for my entrees. The fish was generous in portion and was just on par in flavor. What I am disappointed to say is that I am underwhelmed by the Pad Thai. Based on other Yelp reviews of patrons who say this is, in comparisons, some of the best stuff around, I was bracing myself for full on flavor and their version just plain under delivered. Perhaps it was an off day? Note how my plate of Pad Thai pales even in color to those previously posted by past reviews. Not totally bland, but over-hyped. It wasn't bad, it was ok. Nothing laudible to me. Will be back to try again someday, perhaps a taste of their curries. They have an extensive menu and it only may be that I've yet to find my match."}
{"text":"My in laws have been visiting Cleveland for nearly 30 years every Thanksgiving, yet they don't know any restaurants outside of the two places his aunt and uncle will go to. When extended family dinner plans fell through we pulled up Yelp to find someplace delicious on Thanksgiving eve and Bangkok Thai looked to be the best of the ones nearby.  We arrived around 6pm and easily were seated in a booth; our sweet waitress helped us hang our coats and immediately brought ice water over. We shared three entrees: red curry chicken, eggplant basil chicken, and chicken pad thai (no shrimp, food allergy ), and his parents had a beer and Thai iced coffee, which was strong and delicious.  All of the entrees were fantastic! The chicken was cooked well, and the individual sauces were very flavorful. We didn't have to pay extra for brown rice either which is a rarity at most restaurants. Overall a wonderful dining experience with friendly staff, nice casual environment, and seriously yummy Thai food!"}
{"text":"Prbly my fav Thai place in Cleveland. 4 stars  spicy is actually spicy ( unlike some other Americanized Asian restaurant). The flavor is good. I think I've tried almost every single dish on the menu, as it is my fav lunch place. I luv pad ped, pad pik king, crazy noodles... The rice noodle of the crazy noodles is a little crunch, and I luv it. My only complain is that the lunch portion is kinda small"}
{"text":"Loved the food here. I had the Thai iced tea - the sweet milky tea is a nice complement to spicy dishes. For appetizer I tried the vegetarian gyoza - filled with sweet potato and peanuts, really good. I also had the Bangkok in Love with crispy chicken pieces and a spicy peanut sauce - it was a nice choice. Portions are pretty big. Our waitress was so friendly and service was quick - loved her.   I usually get Panang or Pad Thai at Thai restaurants, but I will definitely be back to try something else with more veggies. They have a great curry menu as well as a lot of other dishes that all sounded good.   The restaurant is in a small plaza that you can easily pass right by, but don't! I definitely recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner on friday evening. As soon as you walk in you are greeted by a friendly host and seated. They have a lot of options in their menu from their noodles to fried rice to stir fry to their duck specialties. This is my second time being here and the food is amazing as always. I started off with the shrimp in the blankets which was very delicious, but very small. It comes in set of 5. After the appetizers I ordered the crazy noodles with seafood and the spice level being hot. The noodles very delicious but i would order it next time without the calamari and scallops. The shrimp was very delicious. Next I ordered Bangkok in Love which comes with crispy chicken. Although I love their food this one was not my favorite. And finally I ordered the Pad Paradise with the spice level of medium. This dish was very very flavorful and it also comes with white rice which I think goes really good with it. Overall this is a small restaurant with friendly staffs and amazing food. If you are looking for a good thai place this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"- Appetizer platter was lackluster. Not worth ordering. - Mango salad tasty, but rather small portion for the price. - Fried fish was super salty, as was the soup. - Watery chicken curry with overcooked veggies  and not much flavour. The chicken looked & tasted like it was just boiled. - The seafood dish was the only one everyone really enjoyed: lots of shrimp, mussels, and squid, all perfectly cooked.  Not sure if we'd go back..."}
{"text":"Food: 2/5 blended. Tasteless. They use frozen vegetables Location 3/5 parking is free Price 2/5  Service 3/5"}
{"text":"a nice Thai place on the East Side. The food is spiced very well --- not damped down too much for American tastes. Affordable and friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious!!! Loved the Pad Thai, General Tso's, and Crab Rangoon!  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Their heat had gone out the night we went, yet it was still busy -- which tells you all you need to know about the quality of the food and service.   We started with two soups, both of which were delicious. My Zap Beef got one star for spiciness, but it brought tears to my eyes. That's not a bad thing, but if you don't like heat you might want to be wary.   Our mains were Pad Thai and Green Noodles with Shrimp. Again, both very good. The Green Noodles came with lots of plump, firm shrimp.  My wife loved the coconut ice cream. I had the mango with black sticky rice. Tasty, but the mango was not quite ripe; took a bit of pressure with the spoon to cut it up.  We've been having a run of disappointing Thai recently at places closer to us. Bangkok is a medium-long drive away, but worth it."}
{"text":"My niece's and I came here for Thai food. Our appetizer of choice was an order of steamed dumplings and an order of fried dumplings. I was pleased that the dough was not as thick as in other places.  I was craving curry and ordered the Green Noodle Curry with Tofu and Vegetables.  While the dish was not as spicy as I anticipated it to be, it still was tasty. Next time, I might ask for it to be spicier.  The environment has artifacts and Buddhist wall decors that I enjoyed very much. I really liked the music as it reflected the culture.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"What a find. We had been passing by this unassuming, drab storefront for many years, not feeling any particular need to give the place a try. Then a foodie recommended it heartily. Boy, was she right. Nicely prepared and visually attractive dishes, a quiet and pretty dining room and service with a huge smile add up to a fabulous experience. Discover it for yourself."}
{"text":"Thai food is my favorite kind of food.  I've had it all around the world, for dozens of years, seeking the best of the best.  I've come to realize that Bangkok Thai, however, is my first and only true love.  This spot is the best Thai food I've ever had, serving that good good from when they started in a hole-in-the-wall on Warrensville to upping their digs (and prices, justifiably) on Mayfield.  You wouldn't expect this from suburban Ohio, but, like, it's amazing.  It's amazing.  The Pad Thai is the standard-bearer, nailing the sauce's sweet-savory tang and texture.  Emerald Noodles, the Tamarind Crispy Basil, and Drunken Noodles are also excellent.  Their curries are rich and flavorful with fresh produce and well-executed meat, tofu, and seafood.  Smash a Panang or Mango curry for a try.  Their mango + black sticky rice dessert is bomb.  Go here."}
{"text":"I used to live right down the street from Thai town in LA and was spoiled. I had yet to find a place that served as good as food as what I had there. And low and behold, I found it within 15 minutes from my house!! I'm thrilled!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai food around Cleveland. Their Chili Duck is seriously to die for and they have the best fried rice that comes with crispy chicken and chili sauce. I also highly recommend their satays, chicken coconut soup, khao soi, thai ice tea & mango sticky rice :)"}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant in Cleveland by far. Staff is always extremely friendly. I highly recommend the Silver Soup to start. For dinner you can't go wrong with the Chicken with Cashews. For the price and quality of food, it's a slam dunk!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was great - the food was delicious and the service friendly and attentive.  Satay, tofu triangles, yellow curry and both basil and pineapple fried rice tasty.  Pad Thai very good, although noodles slightly overcooked.  Excellent Thai Iced Tea.  For the area, an excellent choice."}
{"text":"1st time at Bangkok Thai, and it will be the first of many returns. Loved it!  The service is friendly and attentive, nice decor, and from the traffic coming in for take out, obviously a neighborhood favorite.  Great menu with so many choices. I had the Bangkok Love. I asked the server if I could up the heat, no problem. It was perfect. I opted for 3 out of 4. Nice back heat that lingers just enough for you to go in for the next bite. My dinner mate had the Chicken Pad Thai. Very delicate and great flavor.  I can't wait to try more for my next visit. I eyeballed the tables next to us seeing so many delicious dishes.   It's a kinda hidden gem in a strip plaza. Don't let that intimidate you. Plenty of parking in front and back, and if there's a wait......just do it!"}
