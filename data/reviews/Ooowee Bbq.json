{"text":"I went there for lunch today for the first time and it was absolutely amazing. The staff was so nice and seemed to really care about their customers. I got the \"sundae\" they are known for and it was insanely good. I will definitely be going back here and will be telling everyone I know to go as well."}
{"text":"Great bbq, happy to see the owners of the tasty food truck opened up a restaurant in downtown Pineville. Brisket and smoked chicken were good, and the variety of sides should please a variety of tastes. We had the baked beans, Mac and cheese, both favorites from the food truck, along with smoked green beans and a smoked sweet potato. It's an order at the front restaurant, and tonight, the owners were there and greeted all guests and talked to all tables. The restaurant just opened recently, and the bar wasn't yet open. There is a bit of road construction on the road where the restaurant is located, but don't let that keep you from stopping in. Quick food service and good prices. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Ooowee BBQ is one place that sells some of the best BBQ that I've ever had in my entire life.  If and when y'all go there, YOU HAVE TO ORDER THE SIGNATURE BBQ SUNDAE!!!   Layers of Jesus!!! The owners, who are both really really Tall and ex collegiate and professional basketball players, must have been chefs in their past lives.  Also, they sell some awesome craft beers. 

The atmosphere is more like a family reunion with close family and dear friends.  The people that work there are extremely friendly and helpful.  This place is just flat out amazing.  This place is quickly becoming the MECCA when it comes to good BBQ, friendly service with a smile, and occasional funny stories that the owners and employees tell that make you feel as if your granny, aunt, or uncle is telling it to you."}
{"text":"Holy Cow!  This place is soooooo good!!!!  We had the sundae, mac and cheese, cole slaw, and Mac and cheese egg rolls.  All of it was amazing.  The owner is super nice too.  We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Jackpot! Great find on a trip to Pineville for a baseball tournament. BBQ Sundae was unique and incredible. This place hits the spot and my boys ordered seconds. Owner stopping by to check in was icing on the cake. Very nice atmosphere, great food and PBR. What else is there?"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ. Enjoyed a pork sandwich and mac and cheese with sweet tea. The mac and cheese was so delicious and bbq was fantastic. Enjoy a seat outside and savor the flavor. Definitely worth the drive or stop by."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Born and raised in the country of NC I grew up on good bbq. 
I will say the bbq itself is good. 
Negatives: portions are small
No hush puppies on the menu (that is a southern staple at a bbq joint) I would also recommend adding French fries. 
Service was horribly slow and there were two tables  seated that night . 
Our server had no idea about the menu. I asked him a question about a side and he looked at the menu himself to see. Also when I asked about beers (bc there is no list of beers) all I got was \"sycamore beers\" not being from Charlotte I had no idea what sycamore beers are . 
I can give them the benefit of the doubt being new, however being new- I would expect the service to be top notch. 
This place needs major work to keep them open. Maybe just stick to being a food truck ."}
{"text":"I was a little disappointed in the opening of the restaurant the food truck is good.  As always I order pulled pork an mac n cheese lol I thought for what I got it was pricy , good but I can get more for my $$ at other Bbq places. When we went it was a cold night it was freezing in there.  I hope they do well great spot nice outside seating if the weather ever warms up. If your in pineville give them a try :)"}
{"text":"Love the location, the house/restaurant has plenty of parking and the interior, while a bit sparse on tables, is welcoming. The entry can be confusing, because you can go in at the back by the parking lot (where takeout counter is) or in the front by the bar. The first time we went there, my husband and I entered in the front and wound up standing there, with the bartender in front of the bar watching a basketball game, until after about three minutes he told us (kind of rudely, but whatever) that we could seat ourselves. 

The waitstaff is great. They're polite and fast, but I never feel rushed, which is nice.

This is probably my favorite BBQ spot in southern NC/northern SC. First visit was on 3/17/18. I ordered the BBQ Sundae (layered from top to bottom: cole slaw, meat, macaroni and cheese, and baked beans) expecting that I wouldn't like at least one of the layers, but they were all amazing. My husband had the brisket that day and loved it.

The next visit was with a group of 4 around the beginning of April, on a Saturday night at 5 PM. I got the BBQ Sundae with pork, it was as good as before. Everyone else wanted brisket, but when they ordered they were told the restaurant was all out of it (at 5PM on a Saturday??). So, everyone else got BBQ chicken instead, which was good, but still disappointing they didn't have one of the basic BBQ staples early on a Saturday night.

I will definitely go again, though, and highly recommend it to those looking for great BBQ in Charlotte/Pineville/Ballantyne."}
