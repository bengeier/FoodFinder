{"text":"New favorite! Always trying to find something more than fast food chains, at a reasonable price in this area. The menu has many creative sandwiches, salads, and soups, along with rice bowls. The rice bowl had so many fresh ingredients and was the perfect portion for only $5.00 Highly recommended, needed a close spot to have a healthy lunch during work."}
{"text":"Super yummy and healthy for days I forget to pack my lunch. Their Asian chicken salad is my favorite and their broccoli soup is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff.  My favorite sandwich is the chicken parm.  So good."}
{"text":"I work in a nearby office building so I have been eating here for the past 3 years at least once a week. The staff is always friendly and my order is always ready for me. My faves are the bacon breakfast burrito,the turkey cranberry and the chicken ceasar salad. I highly recommend Ladybug Cafe to anybody."}
{"text":"I recently started working in an office building next to the Ladybug Cafe office. A few of my coworkers would occasionally eat at the cafe, so I tried it one day and fell in love. The owners are always very friendly and helpful and the menu is fairly diverse for a small office cafe.  There are several healthy and very tasty food options. I usually grab lunch there once a week. I tried the vegetable soup last week and it's pretty much the best vegetable soup I've ever had. A little bit spicy with a wide range of vegetables. I also always grab the fresh vegetables in the fridge to add as a side to my lunch.  If you're in the area, I suggest trying it. It's kind of out of the way, but I think it's better that way. Kind of like a hidden gem."}
{"text":"First time here. I ate the club wrap... lunch meat... hard to find... goofy music. (PS I did not go here recently.. this was old review from 2011 or 12)"}
{"text":"Adds hidden charges to my order not listed on their menu.  They just put on there.  Avoids giving you a receipt and you have to go out of your way to ask for one  to make sure you're charged accurately.  I have been here before but this is my last due to the same issue. Treat all customers fair and equal.  Always offer a receipt so customers don't feel ripped off."}
{"text":"I think if I worked in this building or one of the many nearby office buildings in the massive business park, this place would be a God send.
But I don't. I work about 3 miles away and this place is well hidden and involved parking and navigating a massive parking lot. Not really what I want to be spending my lunch break doing, driving, looking for parking and then trekking from the spot to the café. Know what else I don't want to do? Leave one office and go spend my break in another corporate-y building that looks just like the one I desperately needed to escape. 
OK, now that I got my complaints out of the way, I can say the service, diverse menu and good food are all pluses in my book. I couldn't help feeling like an outsider since I don't work in the building or nearby buildings, but that didn't matter. And besides, I certainly looked the part in my business casual attire and with my reading material. 
The menu was impressive, diverse (Hot Teriyaki Veggie Bowl) and with tons of hot and cold lunch staples (Club Sandwich, Pastrami and Cheese, Chicken Caesar Salad, etc.). And that breakfast menu! Again, I would love to have this downstairs from my office. 
The service and the quality was also impressive. I used to work in a large building downtown that had a deli in its lobby. The service wasn't very good and the quality and prices worse. They took full advantage of those too busy or who couldn't be bothered to bring their lunches since there weren't a lot of other quick options in the area. But Ladybug didn't seem to shirking at all. The service was fast and friendly and my Southwest Club Wrap was just what I wanted: fresh and refreshing (thanks to the cucumber, tomato and lettuce) and pretty good. I got a half portion of the wrap, chips and an iced tea for $7. Totally reasonable. 
Had I noticed the smoothie menu before I sat down and watched one get delivered to a table, I would have considered getting one, it looked delicious. Well, a reason to go back. I think I will, despite the aforementioned complaints. I think this place is worthy of its salt, even out of context of an office building lunch counter."}
{"text":"This was a great little find! The staff were lovely and the menu is expansive, but full of great options. Our food was delicious and the portions were perfect for the price."}
{"text":"Ladybug Café is great for a quick lunch that is reasonably priced.  They offer a variety of sandwiches as well as salads that are really good sized.  They also have great breakfast burritos if you are looking for a quick and fresh breakfast."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch spot nestled inside a professional office building. The food is great and the service is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"This is a family run lunch counter place for the local business stooges to grab some soup or a sandwich without having to drive 20 miles and battle with other tools just to have lunch.

They're friendly and personable, but you can't eat here too often, because the food isn't anything special.

They're nice and it is okay, but if you eat here too much you will not be a happy office wage slave.

I used to come in to the corporate mothership nearby here every so often and usually went it on my own here for lunch for some blissful solitude."}
{"text":"It's a tough thing to believe I have never written a review for Ladybug. I have worked in the building next door for over 6 years. I have gone through an almost love hate relationship with it. I love that it is close by and they provide lunch. I hate that I can literally make the same thing for a fraction of the cost at home. 'Tis the price you pay when continuously forgetting your lunch nearly every single day for over 1/2 a decade.

I was recently asked, \"what's good from here\"? I had a hard time nailing it down since I seem to have gone through phases. They offer 1/2 orders with salad or soup for a special price or a whole item that comes with a bag of chips. Realistically, I am not convinced it's less expensive for the 1/2 than it is to ask for a half order and then get a sm soup. I also had issues because not all of their specials are available on their menu however, you can't just get the sandwich at a lesser price without the chips or drink because it comes with the chips and drink and that is the set price and that is how it comes! If you order something on special by name that IS on the menu, you will not get the drink you will only get the sandwich and chips at about the same price. So, if you mean the special, ask for the special. I have either experienced these instances first hand or witnessed them first hand.

At first, every day was the chicken ceasar wrap, sometimes just a half wrap and vegetable soup combo. I loved it with Siracha and eventually started ordering it without croutons. I went through a phase of their egg salad as well as tuna salad, both on wraps. I like both of them, they're pretty good with all of the veggies added. The croissant deluxe is good, I prefer it without the pineapple. The bogey is good on the sub roll with onions added. I also enjoy the Veggie Lover that comes with 3 separate types of cheese, all of the veggies and avocado without the extra charge. The breakfast burrito with saugsage, hashbrown and veggies is alight. The salsa is the highlight of the burritos for me. Nailed it on the salsa! I would buy tubs if they offered it.

They have stopped carrying the vegetable soup, big joke is the msg is what makes it taste so good. I believe the soup is all canned since they don't appear to have much of a kitchen. I believe much of what needs to be cooked is done in the microwave, from the soup to the chicken and possibly even the eggs.

I am not a huge fan of their terryaki and they charge additional for brown rice, the korean beef sandwich is good and so is the green chili chicken sandwich when they have it. 

It is just really difficult for me to justify paying around $10 for lunch everyday for a sandwich easily made at home or a cup of soup at a +200% markup. It's still less expensive than our new vending options here. 

The ladies who work there are very hard working women. I have a lot of respect for them as they do keep the place clean and they do very well for a petite cafe inside of an office building. Would I go out of my way to grab lunch here if I am not at work? No. I would simply head to the grocery store and have lunch for the week at the same cost. 

I will probably be in again, I will probably stare at the menu as if for the first time and I will probably be upset for all of it."}
{"text":"Very good food, super fast, super friendly  service at lunch time. Best kept secret in the area."}
{"text":"One of the best Hidden spots in Phx! 

Ladybug sub is one of my favorites, not to mention all the other goodies they sell. 

Staff is super friendly and keep the place very clean. 

Prices are moderate, but then again I believe there's no price high enough for good food.

It maybe hard to find but definitely worth the try."}
{"text":"NOTE: This is a 4.5 star, not a 4. I wish Yelp would consider making more options for ratings, but I'll live for now...

This little cafe is tucked in an office building next to the Papago Spectrum building where I work. Obviously, the majority of their clientele is employees of the 2 office buildings, as well as Sonoran Quest Labs peeps, but I'm so happy they're in business. 

Prices are a sliver too high in my book, but it doesn't stop me from doing business with them, because their food (sandwiches) are tasty and cashiers are very friendly!

Would I frequent this cafe if I didn't work in the Papago Spectrum? Ummm... probably not, but they seem to do just fine with office worker flow during the day. 

Plus, I really like asking my coworkers, \"Hey, are you going to the BUG today?\". Ha ha!"}
{"text":"Ladybug is a small office building lunch room with the usual lack of ambiance, frayed menus, and informal service (order at the counter).  However, it has three things going for it that place it near the top of its genre:  a good variety of food, lower than average prices, and most importantly tasty well-prepared fare.

HINT: There aren't too many tables and no good alternate place to sit, so if you want to eat in, try to get there at 12:00 or a little before."}
{"text":"The ladies running Lady Bug are super sweet and such speedy service. The place is always clean and food is always delicious. They have a lot of great menu items and fountain drinks, but also have quick snacks and bottled beverages.I am a frequent flyer as they are located in our building. ALWAYS HAPPY WITH THE SERVICE :)"}
{"text":"This sandwich place is so good!  The ladies are always super friendly! They also have lots of vegetarian options.  The Veggie Deluxe is really good if you add pineapple and jalapenos!"}
{"text":"Love this deli!  Best salads, sandwiches and soups. At a very reasonable price too!"}
{"text":"For the life of me I don't know how this place has 4 1/2 stars. The wife and I stopped by for a late lunch as she wanted a cup of soup and half a sandwich.  We came in at around 2 pm. to find that they were out of soup. My bad but strike one. I ordered chicken teriyaki. It consisted of a processed chicken breast with no grill or cooking marks which left me wondering how they cooked it. ( steamed, microwaved?) Strike two . Wife's chicken cordon bleu sub had the same mystery chicken with the thinnest pieces of ham and cheese I'd ever seen. Bland and strike three.  The lady's running the place are very nice and the place is spotlessly clean but the food is terrible."}
{"text":"The owners here are super nice and the food is really delicious.
I tried the Korean beef sandwich and it was unbelievably delicious. Their chicken rice soup is really good too."}
{"text":"Never disappointing!

I've been getting breakfast and snacks here almost 85% of this past month. My coworkers introduce me to this spot on day one of my new job. It seems I've become quite the regular as the very wonderful staff remembers me and treats me just as nice every time I come in. The breakfast burritos are to die for and man that salsa has kick! They keep me going on days when I'm pushed to a late lunch due to a pile of work that unexpectedly jumps up in my face.

Plus, I don't have to cross any major intersections to get to it. Nor do I have to walk that far. Always a plus in my book! Ladybug Cafe with your cute lil' ladybug decor, I will continue to frequent you as long as I'm employed within the area! :)"}
{"text":"Ate here twice on a recent trip to Tempe for work, the first time sort of by accident because it was in close proximity to where I was going. Had I realized how ... basic... it is inside I would have gone elsewhere. While I think the place is great for lunch food if you work in the nearby offices, I certainly would not go out of my way to eat here. It's more like a cafeteria than a restaurant. The second day we ordered lunch for our group because it's close by. Definitely order the extra meat on the hot sandwich, I didn't and my pastrami was super lackluster. Nutty Salad Sandwich and the Asian Sesame Chicken are very good."}
{"text":"Stopped in here while working nearby on a business trip.  There is no signage to speak of so if you don't know where this place is, it will be hard to find.  It sits inside the 1st level of an office building complex.

I opted for Teriyaki veggie bowl.  It was really good.  All the veggies were super fresh and cooked perfectly.  

The person working the counter was so friendly.  If I'm ever in the area again, I will be stopping in."}
{"text":"Buried inside on office complex, LadyBug is a hidden gem when you're looking for a great, quick meal on your lunch break.  Soups, sandwiches, salads, even breakfast."}
