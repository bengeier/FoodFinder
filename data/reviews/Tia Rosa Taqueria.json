{"text":"omg the chicken burro with no salsa fresca enchilada sytle green with no garnish is the best ever! i would have it every day if my waist would allow it..... :) i also love the green salsa they have with chips... much less money than the big resturant and you can order togo and take back to work..yummy!"}
{"text":"Horrible! If you want Utah-Mex go for it, but for those of us expecting Mexican don't waste the time or $.  Loud music, poor decor...hated it!  If I could give it less, I would...that's what I took away from them."}
{"text":"Having been a frequenter of Rosa's in old school Mesa, then the original Taqueria while the Rancho Tia Rosa's was being built and finally the current Rancho Tia Rosa -- I can attest this is some quality food.  Check it out!"}
{"text":"I just can't understand all of the negative reviews that this place has received on Yelp.  I guess you can't put too much stock in a review where the person says that Taco Bell is authentic Mexican food.  Yikes, you need to get out more!  In my opinion, the food here is every bit as good as the original Tia Rosa's in North Mesa.   I've had the Fiesta Burrito, Crab Taco, Shrimp Taco, Quesadilla, and a few of their unique salsas and everything has been wonderful!  The portions are awesome for the price and the food is very fresh.    I was skeptical due to the negative reviews here but I can say after a few visits that this place should do very well."}
{"text":"Well...First off, I LOVE good Mexican food.  We arrived around 6:00.  The place was PACKED.   I put in my name, and was told around 15 minutes.   We took a seat 15 feet from the receptionist.  25 minutes later, I asked when we would be seated and our name had been crossed off the list.  I told her that they seated the wrong people and she snapped \"Well there must have been two people with your name\".   I did not see another \"Hamburgerler\" on the list and pointed that out to her.  In her snotty attitude she came back with something, but I was walking away to tell my wife it was time to leave.  Before I had a chance, someone said \"Sir, I have your table.\"  Reluctantly, we followed and were seated in the worst table in the restaurant located in a cold echo chamber between two tables filled with 8 people on the left and 12 on the right.  The people on the right were having a party with lots of drinks and lots of loud voices making it impossible to carry on any kind of conversation with my wife.  All I ever heard her say was how cold she was.  We placed an order and started with the Queso Fundido, which was more Queso than Fundido and I was looking for more Fundido than Queso.  It was basically a cheese dip only appitized and neither of us would order it again.  Next we both had the Carne Asada.   It took 25 minutes to get the main entre and the meat and vegetables were OUTSTANDING.  The Refried beans were ... uh ... bland, can't really find a word.   We had to ask the waitress why we didn't get any tortillas that are suppose to come with the meal and 15 minutes they made an appearance.  Of course my food was half gone, and my wife's food was untouched and cold (cold room) because she was waiting for the tortillas. She barely ate anything and NOBODY ever asked either of us if everything was ok, or even how we liked, it or anything.  To summarize our experience at Tia Rosa Taqueria - Eating out is expensive and should not be a hassle.  In addition, I don't care much for hostess's (or anyone else for that matter) with snotty attitudes.   The room was cold and noisy, the fold was tasty but cold, the tortillas showed up when we should have been considering desert options and we both decided, shortly after we arrived, that there was no reason to ever come back."}
{"text":"Wow. I really enjoyed the service I received there. The cashier was very friendly and helpful. She made the trip worth it. Ordered the veggie burrito and the deluxe nachoes. The food was very good. Nothing to complain about. Loved the middle area where a friend and I dined in.   Will return!"}
{"text":"I don't think it quite compares to the main restaurant in north Mesa. Food is decent, but there is kind of a weird sterile creepy feel to the place. Why doesn't it smell like Mexican food? Or anything at all?   It beats the Taco Bell across the street, but I would hold out for the main restaurant if possible."}
{"text":"Yuck pretty much covers it.    There is a serious diconnect between atmosphere and food here.  If Tia Rosa put as much thought into the quality of their food and the authenticity of their recipes (or at least call it what it is...which is to say *Not* Mexican) as they do into their decor, they might really have something.  until then, if you want to eat someplace cute, enjoy! if you want to eat someplace good, try something else.  (I didn't finish my fish taco here...I am kinda famous for cleaning my plate, even if I'm not that into it...does that tell you how much I didn't like it?)"}
{"text":"While the service was fast... My meal reminded me of  a school lunch's \"Taco Day\" where the food is made with the the least amount of flavor and uses the cheapest possible ingredients. The beans tasted tinny like they just came out of a #10 can, and the rice tasted like instant. My tacos were generously filled, and they served a LOT of food for the money, but when it has no flavor, and I find the majority of my meal inedible - it's not worth it.  Like another reviewer mentioned, it didn't even smell like Mexican food inside. With so many local, authentic , less expensive Mexican Taquerias, I can't imagine ever going back. I was really hoping for better,  since I drive past it nearly everyday."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place since it's close and I've liked the original full service place. However, each time I've gone I leave feeling like I really didn't get much for what I paid for. Think I'll stick with Costa Vita on Baseline & Val Vista."}
{"text":"okay.... so this is my 1st review as a yelper & unfortunately it is not a good one - I felt compelled to write this one asap!   I work around the gilbert/baseline area & was excited to see a new taqueria opening up! I went today for the 1st time & was sorely disappointed. At 1st I thought \"this is going to be awesome\" because it was very busy and the food coming out looked good. I ordered my food to go so didn't make my discovery until I was back at the office! I ordered a combo plate with a fish taco & rice/beans. The beans were okay, but the rice bland. My 1st bite into the fish taco had a sweet flavor - completely not what I was expecting! I have to say the fish itself wasn't bad, it was grilled & not breaded... but with the sweet sauce - it wasn't very good. Here's the worst part... I also ordered a green corn tamale on the side- DON'T GET IT!! It was very dry & 1/2 of it was inedible! The salsas were okay - didn't try any of their specialty salsas but was intrigued. It is well overpriced for the quality of food I received!!  So needless to say.... I may go back to try something else, maybe I ordered the wrong things? If it's better I will update my review.   Sorry Tia, but so far.... no bueno!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here and we did not enjoy it. The food was plain and overpriced. The cashier was not friendly kind of snobbish. We will not be coming back."}
{"text":"average across the board.  no \"wow\" flavors here.  btw the drive thru is for carryout orders that were called in only."}
{"text":"I do this not because of the food, it is excellent, but because of the poor operational execution of this place.  I order food here regularly so I feel like my opinion carries some weight.  Here is what needs to be worked on: - Phone in orders.  Either get a second line or drop the program.  I've called in before and either been on hold for 10+ minutes or I've spent 20+ minutes trying to get through to anyone. -Adequately fulfill the quoted order times.  I have yet to receive an order within the time designated by the call. -Parking lot....well that's a complaint for another time.  The food is some of the best Mexican in the East Valley but my patience has run razor thin because of those aforementioned execution issues."}
{"text":"We go here now and then.  They are closed on Sundays.  I think the decor is nice, and why on earth would you need to be hit with the scent of Mexican food as you walk in the door, as other reviewers apparently think is necessary?  My husband always gets the flying saucer, I like the quesadillas.  The only complaint is that the kids cheese crisp is a greasy mess."}
{"text":"Bummer. That's all I can say - I wish I could like this place, but it's too ostentatious.   Basically, this is a Mexican restaurant going through a identity crisis. You walk in and it's really clean, but there's no smell - I mean, where's the spice, the flavor, the umph? There was none.   Moving on...the people behind the counter - very friendly, no problems there. I get my food and hortacha, and this burrito is the size of a burrito from Taco Bell...except at TB I pay $.99 and here I paid $2.50 - the beans were runny and I was a bit disappointed in the taste/texture of the tortilla.   The hortacha was tasty but the same as a Fili-b's, and a few cents more.  Here's the thing...we have Baja Fresh for the over priced, Rubios for the beachy/hip feel. We have all the -bertos and Taco Bells for the authentic and cheap...and all of these provide overall better tasting food - why would I go back to Tia?  What I really need from Tia, is some proof that they really care that I come back. I need them to show me they are ready to compete...because right now they're not cuttin' it and I know I've experienced better."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Family friendly, great service, delicious food. I always order the beef nachos. Ridiculously good."}
{"text":"I must admit, I had high expectations due to the Tia Rosa name.  But I guess I should have been warned by the total lack of customers at 5pm on a Monday.  Since the place is a taqueria, I figured I'd skip the usual burrito or chimichanga and get tacos.  Seeing the $2.99 price, I had to ask if it was for more than 1.  I was told it was just one, but they were pretty large.  I was really hungry, so I ordered 1 chicken taco and 1 pork taco, with a side of guacamole and a soda.  Scouting for a seat, I was about to sit in one of the booths nearest the counter, but then noticed a funky wintergreen smell just like the Skoal smokeless tobacco that some teens used when I was growing up.  Needless to say, I found other seating.  After a few minutes my number was called and I got my food.  At first I thought I got the wrong order.  The tacos were laid out flat, with all of the contents piled on top.  Looked like a soft tostada.  On the side was some extra shredded lettuce, but it was all wet and mushy, and starting to brown.  Clearly not fresh, and cut with dull knives.  The tacos themselves were smaller than I expected, and pretty bland.  A rather small amount of meat, some bland white cheese, a lot of pico de gallo and lettuce.  No beans.  And the toritillas, although doubled, were way too fragile to facilitate eating the tacos without a fork and knife.  The plastic cutlery was that really cheap bendy kind, making it hard to use.  Guess the owners never tried eating here, or they'd have realized the need for some better quality plasticware.  I honestly couldn't tell which taco was chicken and which was pork, by taste alone.  Only upon visual examination of the meat could I tell the difference.  I know they call pork the other white meat, but come on, where's the flavor?  Lastly, the guacamole was really weak.  No spicyness at all, and it was somewhat runny and salty tasting.  What'd they do, make it with saline solution?  Blech.  And not even some chips on the side, without paying extra.  I left having spent over $10, and while I wasn't hungry anymore, I certainly didn't feel like I got my $ worth.  I'll stick with Chipotle, thank you."}
{"text":"What Happened? The original Tia's is very good, but something went terribly wrong here.  The food is cold and has a very 'Gamey\" taste to it.    Sorry, i think this is my 1st 1 star review, but I just can't get over how bad the food & the service was."}
{"text":"Wow. What a disappointment. I've been to the North Mesa restaurant and expected the same from here. NOPE. I noticed another reader commented on how it doesn't even smell like there is Mexican food cooking here.It didn't. We just walked in and realized you didn't get to sit down and get waited on. You went up and ordered as if you were at a fast food restaurant.We had just barely walked in the door and 3 people behind the counter asked if we were ready to order. There were 5 more people around them. This would explain why many tables had dirty food on them. I ordered a mole enchilada and a fish taco. Do you think they could have put them on the same plate? No. The mole was good, but pricey. The fish taco was good, and pricey as well. You have to pay for chips and salsa and they give you salsa in little cups. I asked for the hot and it was not hot and very vinegary. This is a do not return for me."}
