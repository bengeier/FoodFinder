{"text":"Waitress we had was rudeeeeeeeee! She was rude when we got in, rude when we ordered, rude when she brought our food, rude when we told her she forgot one of our sides and rude when we asked for the bill.  I went with a small group.  Food was just okay. It's pretty hard to screw up breakfast, but it happened. One person in my group ordered a sandwich. Disappointed - thoroughly. Bits of small chicken pieces which fell out every time they a bite of the sandwich.  Barely toasted bread, which was also soggy from the chicken that was probably sitting in the sandwich and waiting for the slow waitress to pick it up. Pancakes were forgotten by the waitress. When they came they were not hot, not surprisingly.  Home fries were soggy.   Won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this all day breakfast place recently so I decided to come in for breakfast and it was quite good!!  The waitress was amazing all throughout and gave us space when we needed it. The service was quick and the food as great.   As a brief overview, this is what was ordered: breakfast burrito, omelet, and regular eggs with turkey bacon. All orders came with home fries (which are so so good), some fruit (a slice of orange, cantaloupe, and pineapple), and two pieces of toast cut in half and buttered (excluding the breakfast burrito plate!). Each table also has your sugar, sweetener, and spreads, including jam and peanut butter. Beverages ordered were tea, coffee, and French vanilla (a bit pricey for hot beverages but they were almost $3). So good though lol  The only thing about my plate (three eggs, any style, with turkey bacon) is that my scrambled eggs didn't really look like three eggs at all. But that was a blessing in disguise cause I was way too full!  Recommend :)"}
{"text":"Uhh okay..am I the only one here who had a bad experience here?  - the waiter was not attentive..did not check up on us after we received our food  -maybe I got the wrong thing but the EGGS BENNY...sucked. C'mon, Cora's eggs Benny tastes better. It tasted like the sauce was store bought   I would not go back here again!"}
{"text":"Had the big breakfast maybe to much the avg person but I finished it. Pretty decent menu  and a fair price."}
{"text":"Panagio's is my favourite breakfast spot in town. Their French toast and French vanilla are to die for!"}
{"text":"The food was decent but the service was terribly slow.  I had to get up a number of times to just grab items and our server barely checked in on us.  Many other better breakfast places given the food and service."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. The food was mediocre, quality is questionable. Morning waitress was rude, no professionalism show towards me and my girlfriend. I was looking for her to get the bill, and I found her at the counter counting her tips...after she noticed me she just turned to another waitress and said \"this ones yours\" and went back to counting her tips...do not go there unless you want to be treated poorly."}
{"text":"Hidden gem - Decent place great portions food is good, nice variety, good value.."}
{"text":"I think I may have found my go-to breakfast/brunch joint. :)  My boyfriend and I visited Panagio's for brunch on Saturday around noon. It was busy, and there was a bit of a wait, but it was more because the tables needed to be cleared and cleaned. In the meantime, we checked out the big take-out menu that was hanging on the wall.   Panagio's offers everything from typical breakfast eats, including pancakes, waffles and sandwiches, to burritos, grilled cheese, poutines, burgers, soups and salads. It's better than your typical breakfast joint! Seeing as the menu was so extensive, once we were seated, we asked the server if she had any recommendations. She kindly offered a few suggestions, such as Panagio's Big Breakfast, Panagio's Western Holiday, Eggs Benny, the Mexican omelette, and the Oreo pancakes.  We opted for the Big Breakfast -- we substituted the classic pancakes for Oreo pancakes (additional $2.50 I believe) -- as well as the 6 oz Steak & Eggs. We were hungry! :) My boyfriend also ordered Bottomless Coffee.  True to its name, the Big Breakfast is indeed big. For $11.99, you get 4 eggs, 2 strips of bacon, 2 links of sausages, 2 slices of ham, and 2 fluffy pancakes with a bit of fruits, a lot of homefries AND thick cut toast. My eggs were cooked perfectly, the bacon strips were crispy, the sausages and ham were seasoned perfectly (not too salty, particularly the sausages), the fruits were fresh, and the bread was lightly toasted and buttered the way I like it.   The BEST part about my breakfast was the Oreo pancakes...by far. The Oreo cookies add a nice crunch to the big fluffy buttermilk pancakes that were lightly dusted in icing sugar. I added some syrup and I spread peanut butter over them, and it was deeelicious! ;)   As for the homefries, they were not as crispy and seasoned as I would like. The pieces were also not consistent in size, so they were not cooked evenly.  The Steak & Eggs consisted of a 6 oz steak, 3 eggs with a bit of fruits, some homefries and thick cut toast. We asked for medium rare and it came out medium rare, juicy and tender all around.   Our server popped by our table every now and then to make sure everything was good and my boyfriend's coffee cup was never empty.  All in all, my boyfriend and I enjoyed our brunch at Panagio's, and we're looking forward to our next visit! The restaurant was bright and lively, the service was quick and friendly, the food was fresh and delicious, and the prices were reasonable, especially when compared to other breakfast joints such as Cora's and Bobby's Hideaway."}
{"text":"Love their brunch menu. It was my first time and will definitely going back with my friends. Staff are friendly and attentive. Clean restaurant and great food. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"A friend and I opted to try something off the beaten path & local.  We opted for Paganio's... we won't make this mistake again. The service was incredibly slow. Our server failed to remember to bring water after several requests. My poorly grilled \"grilled cheese sandwich\" was a step up from the plate my friend received. Undercooked eggs and missing pancakes left much to be desired."}
{"text":"Breakfast is a meal that could easily be made at home, so your eggs better dress to impress!  We went here after dutifully consulting yelp for a place between my friend's place in Scarberia and mine in Fair Markhamia. Panagio's had a decent rating and the price was right so we went right in.  ATMOSPHERE  Can you say 'unremarkable yet clean' and 'diner'? Smaller than expected inside, the tables line up right along the window facing McCowan. Light! Beautiful light and grimy winter highway. Thanks, Canada. Tables fit two to four and several could be joined for a larger table, but I wouldn't recommend trying to get in a table of 10 or 12. The biggest group we saw was five.  Good for your friends and a casual breakfast. No dates!   FOOD  I ordered a three-egg vegetarian omelette with a side of toast. It came with five respectable pieces of fruit and golden brown potato wedges. The omelette was fine, though I can't remember it. The potatoes were nicely crispy and possibly deep friend - it was Christmas so I slathered em in a massacre of delicious, sugar-filled ketchup OM NOM NOM,   It was acceptable and nothing was wrong with it. My coffee was pot-coffee and it was also acceptable.   SERVICE  Our server was very sweet and we never lacked for a good smile or topping of my endless coffee pot.  LOCATION  Interspace highway where the Earth used to be. Really, it is a fully detached box next to a Staples and a Canadian Tire. In the middle of nowhere, just past the 401. Parking is plentiful, at least.  OVERALL  Come here for a perfectly respectable breakfast for the going-rate price. Health nerds, cry into your non-soy coffees, this menu isn't going to help you. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast and the service was excellent even for a very busy morning like New Year's Day!!! Had the big breakfast with banana pancakes, delicious!!!!!"}
{"text":"My favorite  place to go for breakfast  it's well priced and great service. They have amazing coffee and they have a great atmosphere Great for a date or even going out with family. It gets super busy on Saturday  and Sundays morning so make sure u wake up early!"}
{"text":"This is very close to my house , I go very often, and I love their food! Good variety and taste and the staff usually try their best during rush."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast spot. I love their home fries. Bacon, eggs, sausage all standard fare. Ambiance is nothing to write home about but its clean and comfortable. Prices are better then at other breakfast spots in the city. Bottomless coffee was good although we had to wait forever to get our re-fill. Portions are pretty standard.  Give it a try if you are in the area but I probably would not venture too far out the way to go there."}
{"text":"One of my go to breakfast place. It's always busy on a weekend morning. The staffs are friend and would fill up you coffee before it reach the bottom.  Food is delicious with big portion. You will definitely get your money worth here."}
{"text":"Decided to go for brunch one Saturday morning and boy, this place is packed. Arrived at around 10am and after queueing for (what seemed like an eternity) an hour, we were finally seated. Ordered normal breakfasts with eggs, bacon, sausages. My family had waffles and omelette too. The food was okay but the experience was marred because of the initial long wait to get seated. It's not really the restaurant's fault that they are so popular. Having said that, I suppose if I were to go back, I'd have to schedule it in the summer when I can wake up earlier and have proper breakfast."}
{"text":"Service was great. Food was good. Fries weren't good.  Place wasn't very busy. Food didn't take long"}
{"text":"We usually come here when Cora's is super busy and don't wanna wait or don't feel like driving out.  I have been here many times and they seem to be slipping each time. This will be my last.  There is one particular waitress that seems to drag the place down and this time she had help.  Walked in and noticed there were a few tables open. Made eye contact with said waitress but she pretended not to see us. Got seated soon after when her collegue saw us.  I ordered the big breakfast, which I normally do here and at other establishments,  and the wife ordered eggs with bacon. Simple order, right? To them it was asking them to build a spaceship.  Well, this visit carried much of the same experience from the previous trip. We waited 20 minutes and nothing. Wife flagged down one of the girls and asked for our food. Told us 5 more minutes. Are you F-ing kidding me!?!   My bacon was over done to point it just fell to pieces. While the wife's looked undercooked. I noticed that my pancakes were sitting under the heat lamps waiting for the rest of the food, exactly like the last time, for so long that the butter packets melted!  What was worse is that even though they sat there for so long they still tasted undercooked!  The only thing this place has going for them is large portions...but what's the point when the food sucks and the service sucks even more.  I'll gladly pay a bit extra and go to Cora's down the street."}
{"text":"This is our go to place for breakfast in scarborough.   Decent places are hard to come by out here and this place is the best.  Great breakfast potatoes and good size portions.  I like the scrambled eggs.  Seems like you can't mess up scrambled eggs, but believe me, it happens.  The line can get long as it is a small place so go early  on weekends."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  Food was tasteful.  Service was excellent.  Portions were large.  Lineup was managed well.  Great option for brunch."}
{"text":"Great, friendly wait and kitchen staff; good food; great prices; food comes out fast. A perfect place for lunch or breakfast especially if you're in a hurry. They have a nice patio, a couple of TVs with CP24. I eat here almost every work day. Feels like home!"}
{"text":"Thank you to my brother for introducing me to this place. I've been here a handful of times for breakfast/brunch. You do get a lot of food for your $$$. I've had the opportunity to try a lot of different dishes here and I can say that not all of them are a hit but majority of them are fantastic! Their pancakes are always nice and fluffy. Their home fries are seasoned very well. They cook your eggs the way you want them and their omelets portions are huge and full of whatever you want. They also have amazing breakfast poutine there. TRY IT!   The service there is...eh. I mean there are times the wonderful waitresses are amazing and on point and then there are times that you will be sitting there WAITING for one of them to even look your way to refill your coffee. Overall, this location is a 100% better than Markham Station but it is no Cora's. For the amount of money you pay I don't mind that I don't get a lot of \"fresh fruits\" on my plate. I go here all the time and will continue to do so until further notice. =)"}
{"text":"Had to update my review because the service was much better. I didn't have to wait for my drink or utensils!! Tried the spinach and feta omelet..soo good...my mom had the classic French toast..another win. Plus, the fruit it comes with is actually fresh.   I'll keep coming back as long as the service is good!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Panagio's for breakfast!! I'm glad to say I can sleep in on the weekends and still be able to come here in time (since they serve breakfast all day). It's also great because they are located in a great location with tons of parking space and only 10 minutes away from me.   Their menu is refreshing as they have a variety of options to choose from. I like picking something new every visit. I always leave satisfied because they never skimp and always provide more than enough. My personal favorites are their: omelettes (you can customize your own) and their eggs Florentine.   In terms of service, their servers are super friendly and helpful. The environment itself has a cool, modern feel to it. I would definitely recommend coming to this breakfast joint!"}
{"text":"Great food. BUT...if you ask for tomatoes on the side INSTEAD of home fries and toast, they still want to charge you 2 dollars. There's a principal here and I will never visit this establishment again."}
{"text":"Overall the breakfast at this location was awesome. I had the texmex messy burrito and it rocked. Was HIGHLY disappointed though that I was not informed that the little side of sriracha hot sauce I requested was going to cost me an additional dollar! Ridiculous! Beware of crazy add on charges."}
{"text":"Today I chose Panagio's for brunch. Based on another reader's recommendation, and my general like of tex-mex, I chose the Texmex Messy Burrito [TMB]. The burrito itself was palatable, mildly spicey, and very filling. The plentiful potatoes were mostly good and flavour-fair although some tasted a little undercooked on the inside. I would have liked a little more fruit, as my plate contained only a meager piece of melon and a garnish of orange. (See photo.) At $10 the price of the meal was right. Free wifi, as offered by the competition would have made my visit a little more interesting and comfortable, as the dining room was unimaginative. The server agreed that the TMB was a good dish, but sadly the service afterwards was about as scarce as the fruit. On a positive note, the cooks seemed happy to be there. Unless there are improvements I think I would skip the dine-in experience, and MAYBE pickup for takeout. At this location they need to turn up the sunshine quite a bit. Brunch places are supposed to be warm and comfortable. Right now they are barely pulling 3-stars."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast place. Unlike other breakfast places, this place is not loud. The staff are very friendly and accommodating.  I have been here for breakfast numerous times. The pricing is reasonable. It is hard to find decent breakfast places in Scarborough."}
{"text":"Food wasn't that tasty. We ordered eggs Benny with kielbasa and steak and eggs. Kielbasa was just regular sausage and salty. Was nowhere a polish sausage . And the hollandaise sauce was kinda eggy, wasn't good at all. Steak tasted funny, wasn't the best cut of meat. After spending $45 all we were able to stomach was the home fries ( which was surprisingly good ) and toast. It was super disappointing   Service was good though. No Complaints there .."}
{"text":"Decided to give the new Panagio's in Mississauga a try for breakfast/brunch.  Was surprised of the decade since most of the breakfast places in Mississauga, look like the typical greasy spoon.  Nice wooden tables with booths.  Got there just around 11am and only had one couple in line ahead of us.   There does not seem to be a hostess and it seems that the servers do their own seating.  Was surprised when we were seated ahead of the couple that was in front of us.      We ordered the diced corned beef with homefries with the two eggs, eggs with toast and fresh fruit, kids pancakes with a side of bacon.  All meals were very good.  The corned beef was a different approach to the typical corned beef.  It is a large meal so watch out on ordering sides."}
{"text":"Wow!  The special included 3 eggs, ham bacon or sausage, home fries and two pieces of fruit and your choice bread.   I wish I had taken a photo of my plate.  No doubt this will curb anyone's hunger.   The service was impeccable.   I didn't have high expectations coming here, but they quickly made up my mind."}
{"text":"I recently moved to the Markham - Sheppard area and have driven past Panagios a few times and always wondered about it (since I hate Coras and eggsmart). I finally decided to try it out because, well, yelp ratings almost never lie!  let me just say that I'm picky when it comes to food because (not to brag or anything) cooking is a hobby of mine and I make pretty darn good eggs bennies,  pancakes and French Toast! So suffice to say, impressing me in this area is hard!  I have to say, none of the food was out of this world. It was simply OKAY, but I likely won't return again because okay food and uncomfortable atmosphere don't cut it for me!  The restaurant seemed clean, although I usually judge by the washrooms and I didn't visit them when I was there .   It is a large open concept area just like Coras, the grill and cooks are behind a counter making your food. I personally dislike this because it makes the area a bit too noisy and uncomfortable which makes me not want to hang around too long. I prefer breakfast spots with booths and closed off kitchens kind of like Perkins family restaurant.   We didn't really have one specific waiter, they kind of rotate and each person on the floor kind of helps whoever is near. The staff that helped us were smily and friendly and our coffees were refilled promptly without us having to ask each time.  Our food came quick, we didn't wait too long. Like I said, the eggs Bennie were average. The French Toast was also average, I have had and personally made way better and fluffier french toast. I had toast and poached ggs, nothing special.   Also, surprisingly, on the menu it says each plate comes with fresh fruit. We literally got a sliver of a peice of orange and a small piece of pineapple...really? That's totally cheating! Serve least 1 cup/serving of French fruit on a plate before putting it on the menu!   I wish I could have enjoyed this place more so hubby and I could have a go to breakfast spot right next dooe.. but, for now it's still lady marmalade all the way downtown :("}
{"text":"Food is nicely presented, a nice smile from our server, fast service even thought it was busy, coffee was good,friendly place , I like it."}
{"text":"Great place to meet up with friends over brunch.  Lots of choice and delicious.  Be warned that you may have to wait a bit but a line up also tells you that their food is great and worth trying.    Food:  Lots of variety.  You're bound to find something you want.  Our group ordered a variety of items from Big Breakfast to omelette, hash, grilled cheese and soup.  See attached photo.  Personally, I had the grilled cheese and it tasted great texture and taste.      Atmosphere: Casual and friendly.  Nice bright clean environment.  They don't' rush you even if there is a line up."}
{"text":"A great place with hearty portions.  The staff is friendly and welcoming.   Coffee and water refills come frequently."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot in Toronto!  Hungry after our morning walk around the beautiful Great Lakes Waterfront trail the other day, we spotted Panagio's on our walk back home.  We weren't expecting much, but were pleasantly surprised when we walked in to see hip decor and lighting, high exposed beamed ceilings, and comfy and clean booths.  We learned from our server that they had just opened 5 months ago.  They had great breakfast menu options and our dishes were yummy (I had the eggs florentine, and my beau had the vegetarian omelette).  Our server was sweet, friendly and efficient.  We will definitely be returning to Panagio's after one of our next walks around the harbor and lake!"}
{"text":"Been driving by this place for eons and have heard good things about so finally made the effort to go and check it out. I mean, how can you go wrong with all day breakfast, right?!  I'm a huge eggs benny fan so their Bennyrama menu caught my eye.  What especially caught my eye was their Smoked Kielbasa & Swiss Benny. The platter came with their perfectly seasoned and fried homefries which alone, I'd go back for.  It was THAT good! I'd give that 5/5.    Their portion was also pretty generous as with the amount of kielbasa they give you.  Was thickly cut and grilled nicely.  A little bit on the bland side but I would still order the kielbasa on its own as a side if I were to create my own platter.  I'd rate the kielbasa 4/5.  The eggs however were a huge disappointment.  It was so overcooked that they were practically hard boiled eggs.  I thought it was just mine but my friend who ordered the Eggs Florentine had the same thing.  Either the cook needs to learn how to properly poach an egg or they need to ask their customers if they want their eggs well done.  I personally prefer my eggs to be poached just enough that the yolk is still runny.  The hollandaise sauce also could've used a little more lemon.  If I were to rate the eggs alone, I'd rate it 0/5.    As I enjoyed it enough (again, where can you get kielbasa on an eggs benny and those amazing homefries?!) I would go back but will have to make sure that they are advised not to overcook the eggs."}
{"text":"Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing because my experience does not jibe with the other glowing reviews.  I ordered the California chicken clubhouse (no mozzarella) with onion rings. The onion rings were your standard frozen onion rings. Nothing to get excited about. Even the clubhouse wasn't as great as the description sounded. I mean, guacamole, yay! But there was hardly any guac on my sandwich and it was pretty flavourless.   My dining companion ordered the eggs benny and he suspected the Hollandaise was from a mix and he was therefore not impressed."}
{"text":"Busy restaurant for breakfast so get ready to line up. Great interior decor. Very modern. Awesome food!"}
{"text":"My new favorite brunch spot in Mississauga. How was this gem missed? There's not much to NOT like about this place, and the fact that the wait can get quite busy shows.  First of all, generous portions for reasonable prices. 1 main order is definitely enough (2 people if you have a small appetite). I ordered the Eggs Florentine (Eggs Benedict with spinach) and the Tex Mex Poutine. It was delicious.  I would recommend ordering any variety of Eggs Benedict and poutine (for extra fat and flavor of course). Other people in my party were content with their egg breakfast or sandwich. Lots of varieties to choose from! Most orders come with an addictive side of homefries, therefore you will be full and won't need to order any extra sides!  Great service. Wait staff are attentive and we sat there for a few hours chatting away and were never rushed out.   -1 star because if there's an extra charge of $1.99 for substituting to fruit (and you don't get too much so a bit steep for fruit)."}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in, we knew that its going to be a long wait as there was a line up but it moved quite fast. The food is great, taste is nice and the portions are healthy and tummy filling. Their menu is decent and attractive.  We ordered their 3 egg breakfast which comes with toast and potatoes. I went with make your own omelettes which also comes with toast and potatoes. I got them to put in mozzarella, onions and green peppers. The breakfast was quite nice.  The service is good and the server comes back to see if everything is good. The price point for the quantity and quality is decent as you come out satisfied.   The restaurant is not to big and has plenty of seating but does get busy on weekends. There is plenty of parking."}
{"text":"Solid classic diner fare with an affordable menu in an area with not much in the way of brunch selection, so an oasis of sorts, if an oasis had eggs and bacon.   Located between a Canadian tire and a closed down Staples, the place feels a little out of place with its surroundings, but in a good way. We sat in the patio with umbrellas protecting us from the sun while we whiled away the early afternoon.  Ordered the Messy Tex Mex burrito with eggs, bacon, and cheddar, with salsa verde on top and home fries. Portions were gut bustingly huge! Everything was fresh as expected and home fries looked in house made and not frozen, so an added bonus.   Solid value for money, and this is definitely a go to brunch spot in Scarborough along with Markham station."}
{"text":"After seeing all the reviews on here I was expecting something special. I was a but disappointed. The service was good and quick but the breakfast wasn't too great. The home fries are ridiculous. Basically lumps of hard potato. The bacon was good and there was a huge portion. The pancakes were my favorite but it was a extra 1.75 for a bit of Nutella which I think is a bit extreme. They catch you out on the drinks aswell. I paid 2.99 for a chocolate milk. I don't know if I would come back again. Not in a rush. The waitress seemed ok but had to keep looking out for her as she would disappear a lot."}
{"text":"OREO PANCAKES.  That's all I have to say.  No but really, this is the only breakfast place I've been to that serves Oreo pancakes! And you can bet that I ordered some! Delish!! Definitely something that you can make yourself but soo much easier when you can just order it!  Wasn't craving breakfast when I came here (I know, crazy right?!), for some reason I was reaaaaalllly craving smoked meat and to my surprise, they had it on their menu! I'm drooling just thinking about it  I came on a Sunday afternoon and had just beat the rush! We were seated right away in a comfy booth. Our server was friendly and food came at a reasonable time. No complaints there!"}
{"text":"This is a popular place, so be forewarned if you plan on coming here on the weekends! Our party of three arrived at 12:30pm on a Saturday to find the place absolutely packed! We ended up having to wait almost 40 minutes before we were seated, or even truly looked at. While I understand that they're busy, the customer service could improve.  I ordered the three eggs (chose mine poached) and chose to pay an extra $3 to substitute homefries for fruit. I wanted to replace the toast, but apparently the fries and fruit are more expensive and ergo can only substitute each other. The poached eggs, poached medium, were heavenly. I was also given a sizeable amount of fruit - it was a pretty layout of alternating pineapples and orange slices. Yum!  My friend ordered the three eggs (sunny side up) with smoked Polish sausage and the homefries. I had some of hers... Delish! The other friend got the banana peanut butter waffle, which comes topped with whipped cream. It was utterly heavenly. The banana and peanut butter wasn't too sweet, but had the perfect pairing.  Our waitress was friendly, but you could tell that they were super busy and a little understaffed. Nevertheless, still a decent brunch place in Sauga City!"}
{"text":"This place is in the middle of nowhere. I happened to stumble upon this place when I was in the area for driving school.  I think it's better than Eggsmart! The breakfast is quite cheap. Everything is made fresh - even the fruits are fresh! My boyfriend had an omelette meal and I had a burger. Surprisingly, both the breakfast and lunch food were great! My burger was quite big and tasty. The omelette had many miscellaneous foods on the inside. The portions were huge.   Servers were a bit slow (it was very busy). It took a while for the food to come but it was worth it in the end! There is free wifi. The atmosphere is nothing special."}
{"text":"Ordered a big breakfast on a lazy Sunday here. True to its name, it is a huge portion, especially the generous amount of home fries I was given. Unfortunately, half of the home fries were over cooked, perhaps it could be cooked better if the potato pieces were cut into smaller bits. Major pet peeve, I asked for sunny side ups for my 4 eggs (part of the Big Breakfast) and 2/4 of the egg yolks were broken when it was brought to me. The staff there were nice, and offered to top up my coffee when needed. I would be a more frequent visiter if their working hours were extended."}
{"text":"My husband and I went and almost all tables were full on weekend morning we walked in got Sat ordered a few minutes later and got our food within 5-10 minutes. Food was hot fresh and yummy and waitress came a few times to check on us. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Meh. Typical breakfast joint - nothing special from food, atmosphere or service. I've seen this place change numerous times over the years and it's not necessarily because the food/service is poor, it's also the location. There's nothing around there - even the Staples closed ages ago. Would not come back."}
{"text":"it was okay - the food was mediocre and the service was subpar - we literally had to ask for everything. from water to ketchup to refills.. it was actually quite annoying.  I guess because it was kind of busy and they seemed short staffed; I felt we were getting rushed to pay our bill and leave. not my idea of a good brunch.   I had the eggs Bennie with bacon, my friend had the Oreo pancakes, my bf had the Montreal meat Bennie and my other friend had the French toast.  I found it ridiculous that substituting the home fries for veggies was an extra $1+ and that included sliced tomatoes... who pays that much for tomatoes?????"}
{"text":"I finally accompanied my Sister and her Boyfriend to Panagio's, with our Mom, for a late Thursday Brunch. They are frequent diners here, and kept telling me that I have to try it so finally we had our golden opportunity.   We arrived around 2 and they close at 3 so we were the only diners there with one server. With lots of great menu options it took us all 5-10 minutes to decide what we wanted to order.   My sister's boyfriend went with his usual favourite, the Breakfast Burrito because he loves their salsa verde. My mom ordered Carlito's way and also said the salsa verde was really good, but everything else was fine. My sister ordered the Califonia Burger and said it was good. I ordered Panagio's Western Holiday and enjoyed it since it is very similar to the Western Crepomelette at Cora's which is my favourite thing on their menu. Just swap a crepe for a tortilla and there's the difference. The stand out item here is their homefries, which are seasoned and cooked perfectly! The five stars in this review come from their home fries and extensive menu.   I will definitely return to try more of what Panagio's has to offer. As their website says, \"We won't Disappoint.\""}
{"text":"Very friendly staff which makes the place feel like such a cozy place to grab breakfast. I love their chocolate chip pancakes!"}
{"text":"the BREAKFAST CLUB is ultimately the best deal. huge well-rounded portion for cheap. twice i've boxed up leftovers and had enough for a small breakfast the next day :D  not a fan of the BREAKFAST PANINO, flavour was bland and panini bread was quite dry - i had to douse each bite with ketchup.  brunch business is steady on the weekends but the wait isn't bad at all. it'd be nice if they had a stronger fan to extract the greasy fumes, but no complaints otherwise"}
{"text":"HUGE portions. Good food. The service was amazing. We would  come back if we lived here but  we were just here for business. Only negative is they don't take AMEX."}
{"text":"I am in love with this nice little restaurant, the Kats Grilled Cheese is the best breakfast I have had in a long time. The chef puts it together perfectly so that the feta and cheddar aren't too overpowering. Going to have to make this a weekly visit!"}
{"text":"An admission: I've been eating at Panagio's since 2012 when I moved to Scarborough. I've visited over 50 times since and have never had a bad experience (some 3 star days for sure, but never bad).   Overall, Panagio's offers great value for money. Portions are huge and the prices are reasonable. Seating is comfortable. The restaurant is clean and the bathrooms have change tables. There's lots of parking and it's conveniently located at Sheppard and McCowan, just off the 401.   A couple of negatives: it's not a huge place so I avoid peak periods. It can feel understaffed at times leading to longer waits. There are no really good options for vegans and vegetations; it's a greasy spoon at heart.   I vary my orders between one of their delicious omelets, the\"big\" breakfast (for pigs only) and occasionally I'll have one of their special breakfasts like the \"huevos on the ranch\".  Panagio's is good. My wife and I like it and so do my girls. I'll be there for breakfast today!"}
{"text":"Okay, service here is not the best. I've been here at least three times to know that the servers are usually MIA when I need them, or aren't very interested in providing great customer service. Sure, I might get a forced smile, but it's really unconvincing lol.   Anyway, Panagios is a good all day breakfast grill that offers great portions of food that tastes pretty good. It's definitely better breakfast food than some other brunch diners I've been to (eggsmart, sunset grill, Coras, anyone? ), but it's still not living quite up to my expectations."}
{"text":"Good vibe nice decoration and the Rancher eggs delicious I will definitely will come back."}
{"text":"This is my family's go to place for breakfast. Their menu is extensive. They have the classics, as well as chicken and waffles and breakfast poutine. My favorite is the chicken and waffles. The big breakfast is massive and gives you the most bang for your buck. Pulled pork poutine was ok.  Big portions, good prices, all your breakfast faves in one place makes this my number one family breakfast place. Get there early because the line is sometimes out the door!"}
{"text":"Fast excellent kitchen and dishes, uneven service. The food here is pretty great for the price and honestly a little surprising for a box restaurant with a not incredibly appealing exterior design (it's new and clean...just kind of ugly and unremarkable).  I'm an eggs benedict kind of guy, so I enjoy their 'Eggs Benny' and 'Brekky Poutine'. The first is a well done simple eggs benedict on ham and English muffin: the egg is always poached well and the hollandaise sauce is excellent and creamy. And the poutine...the first time I saw it I knew I'd have to avoid this place or else I'd have a heart attack. Haha. It is fries topped with a poached egg, cheese, and bacon (not bacon bits or anything, but actual crispy bacon), all covered in hollandaise sauce. It is about as disgusting as it gets, but in the best possible sense of the word. Awesome.  Everything else I've seen served has looked great and what I've stolen off other people's plates has tasted as good. I assume the non-breakfast food is cooked as well also, but I've never had the opportunity to try it or reason to NOT order the breakfast food. Unfortunately, I haven't had a great experience with the service here. A little example: after a long breakfast meal my companion and I made repeated attempts to get one of the two waitresses over to our table to refill our coffee for the second time. It took way too long to attract anyone's attention (there were only three tables full at the time...1.5 tables each!) and when I finally did, after five minutes of waitresses in the back and at the other end of the restaurant, I pointed at our two cups and said: 'Can we get some coffee?'. She came over poured coffee in my cup, ignored the one directly beside it and walked away. This was so just brain-hurtingly-silly after such sub-par service the entire meal my guest did a spit-take with her potatoes and we couldn't help but laugh for a full minute at the inanity of it all. You're a breakfast place! Keep the coffee coming! Heh. It shouldn't be that hard and I shouldn't feel like I'm imposing on you to get you to come to my table. This could just be fluke, and one of the three times I've been the service was adequate, but it is stopping me from giving this restaurant the higher rating the kitchen deserves. I will keep coming occasionally and hope the service improves."}
{"text":"The food good was as usual , but the service was meh today!  Please note: they recenlty hired a lot of new servers, and from my personal expericene, it seems like it has started to vary  I was not greeted with a smile, and my server never did a table check on me( they all do at this place )  but did a table just across from me.. Why? I wonder....also they charge $2.50 bottomless but did not offer once to a refill?   Server's name Vanlentina!!!!"}
{"text":"Breakfast/brunch places are finally showing up in the west end. Found this particular one via Yelp. Showed up around 10 am on a Sunday. Lot of people in line but it was organized. We got a seat easily. The vibe is very trendy, exposed pipes and cooler than most breakfast diner places in the suburbs. Extensive menu with the usual breakfast options including speciality waffles and a nice kids menu. Service was great, didn't feel like we were being rushed despite the line waiting to be seated. Look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill. I used to love coming here, but lately the service has been lacking. Yesterday was the last straw. We came in a little past lunch, so the morning rush was dying down. We waited 45 minutes for our food, and this was after asking the waitress where our food was at the 35 minute mark. All she said was, \"Yeah,  I know, but we had so many take-out orders and big tables to serve\" before walking away. THERE WERE ONLY 2 OTHER TABLES THERE AT THE TIME. The waitress faked an apology when we finally got our food, and by that point, I was pissed. It doesn't take 45 minutes to make an omelet wrap, eggs, hash browns and bacon.   Terrible service. Never EVER going back, and I'll be sure to tell everyone to steer clear of Panagio's unless they want to wait almost an hour for eggs."}
{"text":"I've passed by this place countless times, finally decided to give it a go. It's a smallish place, with a good selection of food - your regular eggs&toast, eggs Benny, Florentine, omelettes and a good selection of flavoured pancakes.  I tried the eggs Benedict with homefries, banana chocolate chip pancakes side order and a coffee. The eggs Benedict they replaced the meat with sautéed mushrooms per my request.  The banana pancakes were good but a bit pricey.  Slightly expensive for the quantity but a diverse, delicious selection. I would maybe come here again, would definitely come if it's cheaper.  My coffee also wasn't refilled until the hill was coming so I feel like I didn't get that much out of it.   But in all seriousness when is Toronto getting its IHOP?!?"}
{"text":"I wish it didn't take so long for us to get service. Honestly other than that I really dig the environment and food (the food was fantastic). I ordered the bacon waffle and black coffee, both fantastic (and finished it!) but the waitress took another tables order that sat after us before ours. I'll perhaps try it again."}
{"text":"I've spent the last three days in Toronto, sampling breakfast across the GTA, but none compare to Panagio's in Scarborough.  Toronto life blog ranked it as the best breakfast in Scarborough, but I'm here to tell you it's the best in TO period.  The food was excellent, prices were very reasonable, portions were large, and the service was fast, friendly, and genuine. I'm not sure what more you could ask for."}
{"text":"I ordered a big breakfast which consists of 4 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, 2 ham, and 2 fluffy pancakes served with fresh cut fruits, home fries, and thick cut toast.   Everything was so delicious and I always have leftovers - it literally is a really big breakfast! If I had to compare, I would choose this over coras."}
{"text":"Went here during the week for breakfast once and enjoyed their breakfast special. Basic sausage, eggs, home fries and toast for under $6.   The food tasted good, but breakfast usually does taste good wherever you go. Good serving sizes as well, nice sized sausages.  Service was good. Our waitress was friendly and she came by pretty often. She only gave us one set of cutlery but it wasn't a big deal.   Orange juice was outrageously expensive for Minute Maid orange juice. $3.50 for a bottle of orange juice... Giggling tomatoes charges that for freshly squeezed orange juice pressed right in front of you so personally I wouldn't order orange juice again.   Inside was nice with plenty of seating. The mural on the wall was beautiful... The eyes were stunning.   Bathrooms were also clean so that's always a plus!   We definitely plan on going again but I plan on ordering something different - their pancake selection looked amazing! :)"}
{"text":"Best Hamburger ever! Fresh lettuce and tomato! Just got into Toronto and very hungry! Fast service!"}
{"text":"Good stuff made fresh. The prices are reasonable for large portions of food. The place was quite busy and the service was a little slow but it was weekend breakfast, so I'll cut them some slack."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I stumbled upon this gem of a breakfast establishment one morning while searching for something other then your generic Cora type place. Everything I've ever eaten here has been fabulous. The staff is just as wonderful, they always have great recommendations. Eggs benny with pulled pork... genius! porker burrito mouth wateringly great. I haven't been to another breakfast place since finding panagios. It's totally worth the wait!! Mississauga needed a place like this and panagios filled the void!"}
{"text":"My favourite breakfast place in Mississauga!   Whether you're into a typical eggs and bacon or a savoury chocolate chip pancake, everything they serve is in now quantity at good prices   Quick clean service.   great casual place"}
{"text":"The service is great, the food quality is mediocre, and there is nothing special about the menu. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in my order - the eggs were swimming in grease. How do you mess that up?"}
{"text":"Let me tell you a little story. Two boys one breakfast place. The service was outstanding! That girl... Oh that beautiful beautiful girl. I believe her name was based off a spice... Pepper or something like that. The boys found gold! Friends would come from far to eat this treasure. I even got a birthday card! Then paprika got let go :( the service went down hill... The boys stopped going..."}
{"text":"I love to come here for a solid breakfast. They serve tea in mugs and give you pots to refill with, so you can enjoy full slugs from your mug without having to refill every five minutes. The food is properly prepared and served with a smile, with portions adequate to squash that hangover and fill you up for hours to come. I love the breakfast scrambles, and the menu includes all the regular suspects from pancakes and French toast to eggs benny, omelets, and just plain bacon and eggs. I haven't hit a bad dish yet, and I will continue to fill up on the good food and good value here as long as I can."}
{"text":"Great service, my breakfast is always hot fresh and amazing. I love the environment, able to relax and have a good brunch with friends ! Btw the Chef is amazing, gave me my tea for free."}
{"text":"I don't get the positive reviews at this place. It's below average at best. Eggs Benny were ok... Cooked  properly but Holindaise sauce is a cheese sauce. Some people may like this, but not this guy... No way.  What really got me at this place is there inability to deviate from their menu. Even everso slightly. I asked for eggs Benny with a side of corn beef hash and they said no they cannot do that. Seriously?! Come'on Panagio's, I see both items on the menu. What's up?!"}
{"text":"The food and service is quick. Don't worry about the line up, it's fast and worth it. Here is pic of my Cowboy ( western). Sandwich.  Good job Panagio's!"}
{"text":"I had the $4.99 breakfast special which is only served Monday to Friday before 11AM. You get 3 eggs, one choice of meat (ham, bacon, or sausage), homefries, 4 half slices of toast (white, whole wheat, or rye), and a little bit of fruit. I also added 2 pancakes for $3.49 and a bottomless coffee for $2.49.  The toast is buttered as usual. But I was impressed with their complimentary assortment of individually packaged spreads. I recall seeing: peanut butter, orange marmalade, strawberry and raspberry and blueberry jams.  My scrambled eggs were off-timed and arrived a little cold. The sausages weren't dripping in grease. They were pretty thick and had great texture. I'm not a huge fanatic of pancakes but they were nice and fluffy.  My favourite part of the breakfast were those homefries. Oh man, I was still thinking about them on the drive from work. The homefries had a thin yet crispy exterior surrounding each piece. They barely had any trace of excess oil and were dusted with some red seasoning to give them a bit of flavour. However, I could taste that the large pieces were not as thoroughly cooked and tender as the medium and small pieces. But I was given so much potatoes in a wide assortment of sizes that I could work around it.  I was so stuffed that I didn't even think about lunch. The food was good. The service was pleasant and attentive with our refills although there were just 4 people at 7:30am. I think that Panagio's is a nice addition to the plaza it's in and I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Panagio's, the perfect spot for the perfect breakfast. Fast and quality service is what you get when you go to Panagio's. The breakfast menu is well balanced and has a little bit of everything! My go to dish is the big breakfast it has everything you need!"}
{"text":"Awsome place for breakfast or brunch. Great value and food is good.  It is now my favorite go to breakfast spot and go quite frequently. It is the only place I actually like the home fries and don't have to ask for them well done. I fine everywhere else they taste under or not cooked. Service can be a bit slow if your in a rush. But if your l99k8jg to sit down and enjoy a meal with someone it's great."}
{"text":"Great service, great breakfast! Especially the special from mon-fri before 11:00, only $5.99."}
{"text":"Decided to try out a different breakfast spot than the usual Markham Station and Honey B. I got the Eggs Florentine, and it was very tasty. I'm not a huge fan of their home fries, but that's just me personally. The pancakes aren't dry unlike some other places. Service was a bit slow, and I could tell some customers were getting impatient. Overall not a bad place to go to, a solid 3.5/5."}
{"text":"My all time, #1 brunch spot! I would highly highly highly recommend the banana chocolate chip pancakes! The sole reason why I always come back to this place.  Their sausages are tastey, their home fries are crispy and their eggs are cooked exactly how you want them. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Panagio's has still been my fave breakfast spot so I've been going back quite a bit but decided to try something new this time around!  I got Carlito's Way; an omelette which has mozzarella, tomato scrambled together, drizzled with salsa verde. Along with toast, homefries and fruits. It was my first time trying salsa verde as well, after Googling what it was.  It was pretty busy that day so service was slightly on the slow side plus I saw miscommunication in the servers because some drama that happened while waiting for food.... Very unlike most of the trips I've been - this was slightly more chaotic. Along with tons more customers.  Food came slower than usual but it could be because they were making my omelette. To be fair, I don't like tomatoes but still gave this a shot. Not exactly the best - I was debating against this or the Greek Omelette and regretted not getting the Greek instead. Salsa verde was slightly spicy as it does have a slight taste of jalapenos in it. As much as I like spicy food, it wasn't my cup of tea for breakfast on eggs. With the salsa verde and the tomatoes, it made the meal overall tasted really watery/soggy because of the liquid-meat ratio balance of the food.  I hope to try something new my next visit and fall in love with it as I do enjoy coming here and would like to find more delicious items."}
{"text":"Our server looked like she hated her job. But maybe that's a breath of fresh air from all the servers who act fake.  Food took a while to arrive. But it was busy so that's understandable.  Omelette I ordered was very dry and unenjoyable. This is the main reason I'm giving 3 stars.  The poutine was okay. They have some unique choices which is a plus.  I've been here a few times over the years but the most recent visit reminded my why I stopped going here."}
{"text":"Was craving breakfast so decided to check this place out. It was super packed when we got there with a lineup at the door but the service was pretty efficient and we only waited about 15 minutes for a table. Read a few reviews while waited in line and it seemed like everyone was ordering their chicken and waffles and pancakes. We opted for the Panagio's breakfast which was totally worth it for the portion size and my fiancé created his own omelette. My big breakfast came with home fries,  2 sausages, egg, bacon, toast and 2 pancakes! Totally worth it for the price. The only thing I would say they were lacking was flavour in the eggs. Considering how busy they were, the food came quick. Overall, pretty good service and food. Would definitely come back to try their other grill items."}
{"text":"Waiting lines to sit is the best way to gauge wether a restaurant is good. People don't wait for crappy food. The service is excellent and the food was good. Even on a busy day the food comes quick. Kudos to the kitchen. I would definitely come back"}
{"text":"I came here during the weekday and they appear to have specials for $5.99 which includes eggs, fruit, bacon/sausage and toast.  I asked if I didn't get meat and if it would be the same price. They said it would be so value wise, I didn't think it was worth ordering without meat.  I decided instaed on the Eggs Florentine because who can resist poached eggs? Definitely not me.   Well, the dish was okay,the eggs were poached well, but the Hollandaise sauce was quite bland.  It also came with hash browns, which tasted amazing. Loved the seasoning on them.  Verdict: It's your typical breakfast diner joint. It doesn't have a lot of specialized dishes, but it will do the job for a diner-type breakfast."}
{"text":"First time coming here. Food and service was great. We had the bacon waffle and the cluckin' good and some hit chocolate. Will definitely come here again and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"I went to Panagios with 4 friends on a Saturday morning for Breakfast/Brunch. It was very busy but we were able to get a spot before they filled up.  It is very bright and welcoming, with fun decor painted onto the walls, and they have a very wide array of breakfast options to choose from. They were even able to accommodate my friend who is gluten-free, lactose intolerant, and allergic to eggs! I had the breakfast poutine, which was very good, and my other friends enjoyed the Oreo pancakes and bacon waffle. They both got rave reviews and if I went back I would probably try the Oreo pancakes as they looked really good.  The service was a little slow, but that was expected for a busy Saturday morning at a breakfast spot, so we were alright with it. Our server was very nice and friendly. I will likely return to Panagios to try other things on the menu :)."}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic little gem!  They do breakfast in a fun interesting way! We ordered the chocolate chip banana pancakes and rooster burrito. The rooster burrito was good but I found it needed a tad more flavour! Some extra sauce of some sort. Just something! So I switched with my boyfriend for his pancakes. They were amazing! Just the right amount banana and chocolate chips. Perfecto!   Final verdict? Another visit in the near future for myself! Everyone should try the chocolate chip banana pancakes! Mmm yummy."}
{"text":"I had a Family Day Brunch here.  I had the peanut butter/banana waffles and my spouse had the breakfast special (3 eggs, home fries and pea meal bacon)   The waffles were tasty and light.  Sadly the peanut butter was a little sparse but the side bowl had some more to even out the waffle.    The special was done to order.  Eggs over easy and the home fries crispy.  My spouse really enjoyed the meal.  Our daughter had the grilled cheese. Unlike most places they used sourdough bread which is our family's favourite.    The service was fast and friendly.  The house coffee was decent."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend for breakfast here and I am so happy that we picked this place!  We came at around 7:30 on a weekday and it was a lot less crowded then I thought it would be, which was awesome because it was nice and quiet there. I loved the atmosphere, it was such a nice place for catching up over breakfast.  The coffee was really good and my cup was never empty. The service was great! I wish I could remember the server's name because she was very nice and attentive and she answered my questions that I had about the menu!  The menu had a great variety of things, it was hard for me to choose what I wanted. I ended up getting the banana French toast and the portion was so big for the low price that paid! It was very tasty! I tried my friend's breakfast potatoes and those were really good too. Cooked and seasoned perfectly!  If I'm ever in the area again, I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"My favourite go-to breakfast joint in Mississauga! I've come here more than a few times that I've worked my way around their menu. Great and filling selections of savory and sweet. Their hash browns are seasoned and better than other breakfast joints.  If I'm not going for classic breakfast choices, I'm ordering blueberry pancakes."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place hands down!!!!...the ambience is warm and inviting. The food is fresh and tastes divine."}
{"text":"Honestly, I come here more for normal food rather than brunch. Unless you consider spicy chicken poutine to be brunch? They also have fluffy blueberry chocolate chip pancakes that are just delightful.  A cheaper than your average brunch place (think Coras, Eggsmart, Sunset Grill...) and located in a sketchier than normal area. But no worries. The food will guard you and your stomach.  Can't compare with the best in the GTA, but very good joint in East Scarborough."}
{"text":"I came on a Monday morning, and it wasn't busy at all. Inside had a very diner-like feel to it. Although the waitress was very friendly, the wait time for food was long.   The two of us shared the Panagio's Big Breakfast, which came with 4 eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, 2 ham, 2 pancakes, toast, potatoes, and fruit. It's just enough for 2, and you get a bit of everything!  The bacon was extremely crispy and surprisingly thick which I was happy about because there was actually substance to it when you bit into it. Similarly, the slices of ham were thick. The pancakes were quite average. The potatoes were too salty for my liking, even when eaten with ketchup. I'd recommend trying the rye bread - it was toasted with butter and absolutely delicious!   Overall, a good meal! I'd come back if I was in the Scarborough area and craving breakfast food."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast early on a Saturday morning and the food and service was excellent. The portions are huge. The homefries/potatoes were moist and seasoned well. The menu is pretty impressive and has many options to choose from. I had the corn beef hash combo with two eggs sunnyside up and homefries. They have bottomless coffee too. This place became very busy as the morning progressed. I would defiantly visit again. I would prefer to come here, over Markham Station, anyday!"}
{"text":"So.  This morning Kayra and I went to Panagio's on McCowan Road for breakfast.  Kayra had a craving for poutine.   I placed our order with a waiter at 9:28 AM the order included coffee and tea.  Ten minutes later, I asked the waitress for the coffee and tea.  The waiter passed by and said, \"oh I was waiting for a fresh pot\"  (yeah, right lol).  At 9:58 AM I decided to ask the cook if my order was in process and if not please cancel.  The owner looked and found no order.   Apparently the order was placed in a takeout package waiting behind the cash.  I offered to pay for the coffee but they said it is free.  We left.  Comments:  when we arrived we noticed many tables not cleaned after patrons had left.  A fly buzzed by several times.  The waiter never once came by to give us an update nor to check on us. After we checked with the cooks and owner regarding our order, it seemed no one cared to remedy or apologised .  During my last five visits I noticed a decline in the service.  It seems to get progressively worse with each visit.  I will never return to this location on McCowan road.  We drove to Sunny Up on Kingston Road where the service was awesome.  In five minutes we were served (one waiter with the same amount of patrons as were at panagio's).  Not a big variety on the menu.  Breakfast with an Indian flair hmmm not bad. The regular potatoes served with eggs had onions and green pepper with a touch salt,  tasted great."}
{"text":"Went to eat here around 11AM. It's not a busy place at all, looking at the outside and the empty parking lot you might even think this place is closed. there will probably be 1-2 different guests aside from you. The waitress is really friendly. I noticed she would try to really converse with the guests. The service was really quick which was great and the place was really clean  I ordered the Nutella and strawberry waffle w/ whip cream- I opted out of the whip cream. The waffle itself wasn't the greatest. It was really chewy and unflavourful, had to include a lot of strawberries in each bite to help swallow it. Presentation was great though   My parents ordered the morning special (3 eggs any style, 3 meat of your choice (bacon, sausage or ham), toast and home style potato all for $4.99). I had a few bites.. The sausage was good, however my parents did find it a bit on the oily side. But the potatoes were the best part (it had spices over it)   All in all I don't think id be ordering the waffle again. And I don't think id come back unless I was srsly craving the breakfast special (since it's so cheap)."}
{"text":"A reliable basic breakfast spot in the west end, an old-faithful, and a solid go-to for groups, families, and people of all ages. I've visited this location several times in the last year, and while it isn't a gourmet, knock-your-sock-off experience, it's a reliable, casual, basic breakfast and brunch joint with a pretty extensive menu and lots of options to choose from (which, sometimes, might be all you really want after rolling out of bed on a Saturday morning). It's a nice, safe choice, and you really can't go wrong with a meal here.  Location: Located at the northeast corner of Creditview Road and Britannia Road in Mississauga (about 7 minutes away from the Mavis Road exit of Hwy 401), Panagio's is located in a pretty busy plaza (the same one as No Frills, Tim Horton's, etc.) However, there's lots of parking available, so that shouldn't be an issue.  Menu: Lots of options - both sweet and savoury. They have the usual eggs, omelettes, corned beef & hash, etc. And they also have sweet options like Oreo pancakes, chocolate chip pancakes, etc. Portions for some dishes are quite large, and decently tasty (i.e. I quite enjoyed the chocolate chip + banana pancakes, although I did find their home fries a little raw and undercooked).  Overall: A safe choice for breakfast in Mississauga, and the dishes I've ordered here have been decent. My one criticism is that they don't take reservations, so lines can go out the door at peak times on weekends, and it can be difficult if you want to secure a table for larger groups. Other than that, check this spot out - it's reliable, with a nice, clean modern environment suitable for groups large and small."}
{"text":"Bustling place for breakfast on the weekend. Very interesting atmosphere: talkative, wooden tables, friendly-as-anything staff, rapid service.  Food is almost as good as the place advertise; interestingly, out of the 4 of us, 3 got eggs Florentine, which was fairly well done. Would have preferred a sharper mozzarella, a less done egg and a little more flavor. Hollandaise sauce was terrific. home fries are good. Fruit?? - a piece each of cantaloupe, pineapple and orange...that's called fruit, disappointing. My friend's greek omelette looked pretty solid too. We also got an order of pancakes - pretty good."}
{"text":"HOLY S#%&! I seen their locations around and never gave much thought to them. Today I was in a desperate need for some breakfast. Called in and ordered off their menu. Was ready in ten minutes. Hands down - the BEST pancakes I have ever had in my life. The best breakfast burrito I have ever had. And all reasonably priced. Staff was great and the inside was very clean. Food tasted so fresh and home made. I am very happy I found this place."}
{"text":"They taste GREAT!! Except that it came in sooooo much we only managed to finish half of the dishes. On the down side, there were only 1 waitress serving in the not so busy morning breakfast session so had to wait a little bit if you want to order."}
{"text":"We ordered the Greek omelette and the corned beef hash. The portions were very generous... The home fries were really good!  Coffee was quite fresh and strong. Service was friendly and prompt (there weren't too many people at the restaurant at the time).   Ps: clean washroom!"}
{"text":"I'm used to the Scarborough location and was down here for work. Food was brought out fast and hot! Everything was delicious!  I've just noticed they have some difficult clients at this location, rude one lol...but the waitress handled everything with grace and professionalism.   Clean shop, well lit, everything was proper!  Glad I had the chance to stop by!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat breakfast. Moved a bit away but we still drive back often!   Eggs are always done to your liking! Big portions for a great price. Coffee is topped off regularly and tastes good!   Just one of \"those places\" you can get a good home cooked breakfast or a good regular burger!   Busy but never too packed."}
{"text":"We were searching for a cheap breakfast place because Cora's was packed. We found this place nearby, were seated within five minutes, and served probably within 10 minutes (all on a busy Sunday morning). I was a bit skeptical just because I thought nothing could beat Cora's breakfast but this place has the most tastiest breakfast I've ever tasted in a restaurant. The home fries are amazing!!  I got Carlito's Way which is scrambled eggs with cheese and tomatoes with a green salsa on top the eggs, two slices of toast, a decent portion of home fries, and two slices of fruit at the side. My sister got the Big Breakfast which included eggs, toasts, bacon and sausages, two pancakes, home fries, and two slices of fruit. We both LOVED our meals. I also loved the homey feeling of the restaurant. It was nothing fancy but nonetheless very homey with amazing food.   I've found my new breakfast spot! Will definitely be returning and will be recommending this place to everyone."}
{"text":"I went here for Sunday morning brunch with my wife. We showed up fairly early (9:30am), just as it was starting to get busy. We didn't have to wait for our table, but we probably would have if we came in an hour later.   I ordered the eggs benedict (\"eggs benny\") with peameal bacon. The eggs were delicious and runny, and the english muffins well toasted (they had a good crunch). The home fries were also really tasty -- I think they use a bit of sugar in the seasoning for flavour. The coffee was decent (very drinkable), but nothing special. Overall, this is one of the better \"standard\" brunches I've had.   The restaurant itself was clean, cheery, and had nice modern decor. The service was good and fast (I suspect they aim for a high turnover on Sunday mornings). The prices were all reasonable -- on the cheaper end of what you would expect to pay for brunch in the GTA.  Overall, I had a very enjoyable experience and will probably return."}
{"text":"My go-to favourite brunch/breakie place in Scarborough. I like the service and the food is really good and the portions are worth the price. I am a fan of their bennys and they don't cheap out on the ingredients. They're sure to make your tummy happy. If you are sick of the same ol franchises that are in Scarborough then I would definitely give this place a try."}
{"text":"I've been here twice not, and it's not bad, but the food is quite... average. It's not super cheap but you do get large portions, especially for the \"Big Breakfast\" sets. (The $2 upgrade to the French Toast is probably worth it though!)   I think if I were to go back for a visit, I'd try the Oreo Pancakes that everyone's been talking about."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the staff very friendly. The restaurant doesn't look the nicest but the quality of the food made up for it."}
{"text":"Well it took 3 tries, but I finally got to have breakfast at Panagio's last Monday. They were closed early on Civic Holiday, and were closed for maintenance another day I went by. But it was worth the wait. The restaurant itself was very nice, bright inside, large windows, bold colours. An attractive look, which is not something that I usually pay much attention to. The servers were pleasant, and the service fairly quick.  As for the food, excellent. I had the cinnamon apple French toast, 3 pieces of thick toast covered with apple slices and apple sauce (which was really hot when it arrived), and some fruit on the side. With coffee, the total was $14, and very well worth it. The menu has a wide variety of breakfast choices as well as sandwiches, burgers and poutine. I will definitely return to try some of the other breakfasts."}
{"text":"Very very good!!! I ordered the chicken and waffles and coconut water. Wife and Son got an incredible California club, and Daughter got the classic waffles with strawberries and whipped cream. Wow OMG wow...the home fries have real nice seasoning on them.   While I did enjoy my chicken and waffles it was not the best I have had. We will definitely come back here again.    The place is small and very busy so you might have to wait a few minutes but the food comes quite quick so all good."}
{"text":"Oh my god, there was so much food you could feed 3 continents with a dish.   I got the Big Breakfast, which I'm never getting again because I felt so bad for leaving so much behind. Dude got the guac melt, and upgraded his side to get a poutine.   Okay so lots to talk about here.  Ambience: The whole place screams GOOD MORNING!!!!!! to you. It's like a pre-corporate Cora's. Everything's happy but without murals of smiling cartoon food eyeing you down as you're eating. Lots of natural lighting, and staff were great. Not the most attentive but their attitude was impeccable. Once you step in here, you just KNOW that everything's going to be beautiful.   Food: portions are H U G E . Big Breakfast was 2 pcs of ham, 2 sausages, 4 bacon, home fries, 2 pcs of toast, 3 eggs, AND 2 fluffy pancakes. I tried everything and I managed to finish maybe 50% of it. Hooooly. Best bang for your 15 bucks, friend. Ham was pretty good, sausages were stellar. Bacon was a tad too burnt for me. I got rye and it was alright. I had one pancake and WOO it was great! Fluffy and light, I like the dash of sugar they put on top. It wasn't stuffy at all. Eggs were probably their weakest link: they tasted average.  Dude reached Nirvana when he bit into the guac melt. It was so good that slow, civilized eating was foregone and he just went to town with that guac melt. Ladies, look for a guy who treats you as well as Dude loved his guac melt. He said it was beautiful. I trust him.   That poutine, oh my goooooooodness. I've been to Quebec City and Monreal and I have to say, this poutine is on par, if not better, than QC poutine. And you know what's great? The gravy they use is vegetarian gravy, but it sure didn't taste like it. It was amazing!! They also put a ton of cheese curds so I just fell in love with this dish.   I want to live here and inhale all the poutine they have. Fries were a great consistency and super T H I C C . Gravy was on point, and cheese curds galore. Granted, the curds didn't squeak but they were still super delectable.   If you haven't been to this Panagio's yet, PLEASE come!!"}
{"text":"Go here about once a month, set us is great and efficient. I've never seen the line be unmanageable,  even at their peak times.   Food is along the lines of other greasy spoons but with more lunch and waffle options. But I wish they had more healthy options than turkey bacon or salad.   Love that you can do poached, fried or any style eggs with no issues.   Family friendly with nice children liking servers!   Inside def looks better than other breakfast joints with more than enough tvs set on channel 24!  Portions are good and prices are even better!"}
{"text":"As a family restaurant, they really failed miserably. Service is bad and the wait staff who suppose to be the person in charge is just rude. We left there without even getting our food. We paid for the drinks and left. Would never go and won't recommend this place to any of my friends."}
{"text":"This was my fist time at this place, I have driven by it a few times.   I of course decided to go with a breakfast, I ordered the Eggs-N-More with a Verry Berry smoothie, the smoothie was quite good there is no added sugar. The meal was great eggs, bacon, home fries, and toast. It also came with pancakes which were really bland and flavorless. The coffee is coffee nothing special same like everywhere else.   Overall the place is small but it has its charm, the staff if courteous. I would definitely come back and I do recommend it."}
{"text":"Pour up, Bacon, Head shot, Bacon...  Kendrick Lamar lyrics on the wall first thing upon entering - how could I not love this place? As mentioned in other reviews, this is a modern looking restaurant in a suburban strip plaza, and seems slightly out-of-place in Mississauga. Well this definitely the good out-of-place.  I visited Panagio's during brunchtime on a Sunday. They were quite busy, but I was able to get a table for 2 fairly quickly. For my order, I had the \"Huevos of the Ranch\" - their take on the huevos rancheros. The dish consisted of 2 sunnyside up eggs, tomato, salsa verde, and feta on a tortilla with sides of guacamole and home fries.   Admittedly, it was my first time trying huevos rancheros, though it's been tops on my to-try list for a long time now. I really liked how all the flavours mixed together and having salsa, tortillas, and guac during breakfast was a totally new experience for me. The feta cheese was my favourite part, as it tasted firm and fresh.   Will definitely be back at Panagio's in the near future - I need to try their Oreo waffles."}
{"text":"I would always drove by this place but I never really thought about going in. Mind you my boyfriend and I love to go out for breakfast food. After I read the reviews on yelp about the Oreo pancakes I HAD TO GO OKKKK. We arrived on a Sunday afternoon and it was packed. The wait went by pretty quickly and we were at like the end of the line (at the door). We got seated and then our server came by, I think she was new because everything she did was so slow. She was also very forgetful. She didn't fill our coffee once or get our water we asked her for and I also had to remind her to keep on getting out bill which we got like 25 minutes later after me nagging her about it. The Oreo pancakes weren't as outstanding as I expected but my boyfriends egg Benny was good!"}
{"text":"Times visited: Once  Customer service: Decent customer service but it can get slow and hectic when its a full house esp with two servers. The atmosphere is kind of depressing but i guess thats normal for a breakfast place. The servers are kind and nice but not professional. No uniforms, dirty aprons, and kind of lost.  Food: We ordered katis grilled cheese and California club sandwich. It was decent and tasted okay nothing special but worth a try."}
{"text":"One of my favourite breakfast spots in the area. It may not be 24/7 like it's competition, but it makes up for it with higher quality food at the same price.   I've probably been here around 6 times in the past couple years and it's been great every time. I always get their standard breakfast with scrambled eggs and sausage. The food here is just so much better than nearby spots like Markham Station or Honey B.   Recently it hasn't been as amazing as it was before but it's still going strong! 4.5/5"}
{"text":"A causal breakfast place, good for groups and families. We got there at 9:50am and were seated right away but by 10am the restaurant had filled up and there was a line out the door! I ordered the oreo pancakes which were fluffy and the perfect amount of sweetness. I would definitely try it first before adding syrup! The portion sizes are quite large and the prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"Came here as a party of two at 1pm on a Sunday. First thoughts were this place is busier than expected (no line, but no free tables either) and has a cool contemporary layout.  We ordered Oreo pancakes, Greek omelette, side of French toast, and OJ.  Oreo pancakes: great with maple syrup - fluffy and good amount of Oreo chunks. Satisfied my sweet tooth :) Greek omelette: omelette contained black olives, feta cheese and onions - tasty combination, and the accompanying homefries were well seasoned French toast: maybe it's made differently as a main but these were really underwhelming... pretty bland  OJ: served a bottle of Minute Maid. The menu didn't say freshly squeezed so guess that's fine  Service was slow - seemed to be understaffed. We had to wait at first to be acknowledged, and then again for the bill.  Overall - decent, would be fine with returning here and trying other menu items, but in no rush to do so."}
{"text":"If only it were possible to give this place 6 stars!!Had breakfast here on a Sunday morning. If you love breakfast food and you have a big appetite you will love this place! We got there around 1030am and after we sat down the place filled up! A few large groups of people were there and soon there was a line up. Our server was a friendly and muchacho with some pretty awesomely sculpted facial hair. I'm always envious as now being a married muchacho myself with a wife who disdains facial hair of any kind, I sometimes have a little envy for men who are facially hirsute. He thought he recognized me and had welcomed me back. I had never been before but I thought his mentioning it was a nice touch. There is a definite dearth of that kind of customer recognition in the world these days. Put plainly: The food is great! I had eggs, sliced tomatoes, pea meal bacon and home fries. Everything was very tasty and landed on the table in a jiffy! My 3 sunny side up eggs were perfectly Sunny n Runny! The back bacon had me singing Baby Got Back! The crispy seasoned home fries had me thinking I was in a North Carolina greasy spoon! Ruggedly handsome muchacho kept the coffee mug hot and full! Price was great! Next time I find myself anywhere near this place and hungry I will beat down the door to get some breakfast in my belly! They also have a great burger and sammies menu for lunch, I almost ordered a burger. Next time I will!! When I tell you this place is awesome my word is bond!! Baby Got Back! (It begs saying it twice.)"}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for breakfast with my triathlon girl group. We got a table right away which I was surprised about since there are 6 of us. The waitress was super friendly and did not rush us at all even when it started getting really busy around 10am. 4 of us ordered waffles (two Nutella strawberry, two banana peanut butter), one BLT and one Western. I got the Nutella strawberry sans whip cream. The waffle was fluffy and good flavour, they did the perfect amount of Nutella and lots of strawberries. The coffee was typical diner coffee but in a good way, I always enjoy diner coffee on the rare occasion I go for breakfast. Everyone really enjoyed their meals, I do feel like it was a bit pricey for a waffle, and although I would totally recommend this place I have other favourites. Word of warning get here early because the line up was huge by the time we left."}
{"text":"The food is good, nothing amazing, but holy for the breakfast deal of $5 I am COMPLETELY IMPRESSED! I'll be back for more."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday morning around 10:30. There was a line up that extended out the door, however my wait time to be seated was 15 mins which wasn't too bad. The food was really good but it took 40 mins for the food to arrive. The waitress didn't take down my order correctly so I had to wait another 10 mins for my correct order to arrive. The waitress didn't even apologize. She was a bit rude through out the whole service.  The food wasn't greasy some some breakfast places. Home fries were really good. I will try this place again. I just hope I get a different waitress next time."}
{"text":"Very busy place that had a big lineup when we got there but it moved pretty quick.  I ordered the waffle that comes with eggs, bacon and sausage...waffle was a little thick but still tasty, overall the meal was good but maybe I ordered too simple of a dish to really give it more tan 3 stars, but other people had much bigger dishes and it all looked great."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. Usually get the big breakfast which is really good for the price. Wanted to try something different, so I got the corned beef hash. Was disappointed, majority of it was just onion and hardly any corned beef. Other than that great place"}
{"text":"Very good place for breakfast or lunch. Menu is quite large and has lots of different tastes/cravings to choose from. Atmosphere is nice and the prices were very good. Pancakes were delicious, pretty big and fluffy. Everything tested fresh, and the home fries are different from most places, also they give you a small section of fruit with most meals which is great. Service was very good and our server came by quite often to check if everything was good. Food came out pretty quickly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I chose Panagio for breakfast solely for the Oreo pancakes and I had no regret. We came in early on a Friday morning and there were few other people there already.   I got the oreo pancakes with strawberries and the bf got a greek omelet. I was a bit worried that the pancake would be overwhelming sweet, but to my surprised it wasn't! The pancake itself was only slightly sweet, so with the addition of oreo/whipped cream, it was perfect! I was also really happy with the amount of Oreos in my pancakes! I took a few bite of the omelet, it was good, but I was all about my oreo pancake that morning. I didn't really like the side potatoes. I found it tasting a bit raw or some sort but the bf said he digged it!  Portion wise, you get a decent amount of food. We were only about to eat half of the food that was served. We boxed the rest. I enjoyed my pancake later on just as much!  Would definitely come back for more oreo pancakes!"}
{"text":"There are a few Panagio's locations all over the GTA.  if you're looking to try your local, traditional breakfast, you won't be disappointed.  This particular locations has been here for a few years, and so it was time to give this place a try as per my aunt's recommendation.  What used to be a donuts shop, Panagio's provides you a range of traditional breakfast choices.  From bacon and eggs to omelettes and steaks.   With our cups of coffee hand we made decision.  For food, I ordered their smoke Kielbasa special which is a favorite, served with some fruits and their homemade potatoes.  The dish was somewhat disappointing, you'd expect to see a whole sausage and have a more smokier flavor..,,hmmmm it felt though it was missing something. The portions are more than enough, and at a glance you can see some patrons taking away (para llevar) the rest of their orders. Price, well you certainly get a lot of what you pay for.  Essentially its bang of buck! The ambiance is nice, nothing fancy, but has that typical diner vibe minus the 60's looking decor...nothing close to Wimpy's. Only draw back is the seating between the two rows of tables are way too narrow to pass through...however that was just my observation.  Overall this place was a delight, and I wouldn't mind coming back."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast establishment but nothing to rave about. My favourite is their brekkie poutine, and their service is great!"}
{"text":"We have never are inside yet.  We usually get an omelette or something to brin home and share with the kids.  Omelettes are berry good, will need to try other things on the menu in the future."}
{"text":"It was our first time here we got the butter milk pancakes only ate less then half they were very unappetizing service was ok will probably never go back and don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Three words - The Heart Attack!!  Now, to start...I don't personally order this burger as I could never eat it all.  I always let someone else in my party order it and then steal away a bite or two for myself :)  It's too good not to eat, it's just so large.  The Heart Attack is a burger on the menu...the tastiest burger in TO so far that I've tried, but I may be biased for 2 reasons.    1) Panagios is located in central Scarborough - an area that doesn't see a lot of good non-franchised burger fare. 2) I adore corned beef, and the Heart Attack is loaded with corned beef :)  Aside from the burger which I recommend, the Eggs Benedict are also wonderful.  I've tried a couple other sandwiches/wraps on the menu, but they weren't too special.  The actual establishment has adequate free parking, lots of natural light and the service has always been decent.  There are a couple of TVs tuned to CP24, perfect for catching a dose of morning news with coffee and breakkie."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars  Located in my old stomping grounds in Scarborough, this breakfast/brunch place serves up just what you need after a long night of drinking.   The menu is pretty standard with the typical brunch fare - eggs, made your way omelettes, pancakes, sandwiches etc.  I ordered the Montreal melt 'grilled cheese' sandwich- smoked meat, Swiss cheese, mustard.  It comes with a side of fruit (cantaloupe and a few pieces of pineapple).  The sammie was a bit on the salty side and the mustard a little too overpowering but overall a solid meal choice.  A little on the small side if you are hungry, but I wasn't and don't like to eat heavy things for breakfast anyways.  For $6.99 you can't complain.  My friend had the Chicken Ciabatta (chicken, onion, tomato, garlic aioli ) which came with a side (he chose salad).  He liked his meal well enough and the portion size was pretty decent.  The service was friendly and quick considering at one point it was a full house.     For 2 meals with juice/coffee and tax/tip for under $30 is a great bargain especially when your bank account is whimpering after the holidays."}
{"text":"I always pass by this place so I decided to eat here the morning I skipped breakfast . it was your standard fare, and I honestly the only thing good about this place is the pricing. I did not enjoy my breakfast here at the same time did not despise it. rather eat at Starbucks instead. unfortunately will not return ."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast diners in the area. Their scrambled eggs are always perfect and their pancakes are fluffy and warm. One of the best coffees too. Hands down will be returning."}
{"text":"Shopping centre diner. Ate a regular breakfast (eggs, meat, toast). Food and coffee is generic. Service person was very nice. TV sound is on. No music."}
{"text":"Went with my mom, boyfriend and brother.. we found hair in ALL of our food. Do not recommend going here.. its outrageous that we found hair in all 4 plates."}
{"text":"I came here about a month back for a bite to eat with friends. I really thought it was interesting that this place had open concept kitchen, so you could actually SEE your food being made in front of you, or within close proximity.   Service was a little slow. Food itself was cooked fast, but the waitresses seemed overwhelmed. There were 2 that were working, managing maybe 3 tables each...so it took a really long time to get our food and our bill. They never really had a chance to check on us either, which was a little surprising, considering each table consisted of smaller groups (2, possibly 3 dining individuals).  In terms of food quality - extremely well cooked, very tasty and totally worth it. Portion sizes are much bigger than I had anticipated. There are very few GOOD breakfast places, so this place definitely makes the list. The price is reasonable, maybe a tiny bit on the high side, but nothing too extreme.  It's too bad that this place isn't open later than 4pm. Come for the food, but don't expect too much from the wait service."}
{"text":"The food was decent diner fare. The service was okay.  Nothing spectacular. I might try them again sometime and update my review."}
{"text":"For the price, this place is solid. Great flavour and quality for breakfast and lunch. The big breakfast is really good. Preferred over Cora's and other hotter breakfast spots.   Service and speed is one thing to look into. A bit inconsistent for my liking."}
{"text":"Small jewel in the heart of Againcourt. Came in at 12pm on a Sunday - long weekend. Place was packed but didn't have to wait for a table. Prices are great for the portion sizes. Three adults and a child we had three breakfast orders and gave the little one pancakes from one of the meals. No one at our table was able to finish our food. Next time shareable orders."}
{"text":"Dont be fooled by the enticing Instagram pictures. I regularly go out for brunch and thought of giving this place a try. The place was rather small and kind of shabby looking. The food was below average - the waffles were okay. The coffee was not good and watered down. The service was ok - i wasn't a fan of being served by the same guy cooking my breakfast and. Seeing the dirty apron on him and smelling all sorts of food when he would walk by was not pleasant. I wouldn't go back again."}
{"text":"Not at all great food, I'd go to a different breakfast place - their smoothies are ice and juice ew"}
{"text":"I'm pretty much a food snob and stopped in here on the r commendation of a friend. Pleasant surprise. Staff was fast and attentive. I had an omelette with turkey bacon, cheese, and mushrooms. I asked for egg whites. Order was perfect.  Came with seasoned potatoes and toast. Everything was good. Staff kept checking on me to make sure I was ok and if I needed anything. Will definitely be back again to try other items. Glad I went. Kudos to the staff and one of the owners who came out to also see if things were up to pat and satisfactory. A1 place."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot in Scarborough. I had the breakfast special, $5.99 for 3 eggs, sausage (can also get bacon), toast, fruit, and hash browns. The hash browns were home made with spices. Great experience overall and really good prices. Will be back"}
{"text":"service is nice, food is quick. food is super bland. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone  nor coming back."}
{"text":"A group of friends and I stopped by this place on our way out of the city for a road trip. There was not much of a wait, although we had made reservations just to be safe.  Although the service was a little slow, the food was worth the wait. They were very attentive.  I definitely would like to go back."}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday morning at 11am. The restaurant was packed and clearly understaffed. After sitting down, it was awhile before we even got our menus. Around 20 min wait before getting our food. After getting our food, we had to asked multiple people before we got cutlery. The food was decent for an average breakfast place. Surprised they do not offer fresh squeezed orange juice. Only bottled drinks available."}
{"text":"This is a great spot for breakfast. Portion sizes are hearty and you can rest assured that you will undoubtedly leave satisfied and full. I have the Big Breakfast and my eggs are always cooked to perfection. If you are looking for fluffy pancakes that melt in your mouth, with a warm buttery taste, then you must try them here. The Pancake variety is out of this world and nothing less than delish. The staff is very friendly and the service is quick despite there is always a line-up for breakfast on the weekends. The Corn Beef Hash with Eggs and home fries is heavenly and one of my absolute favorites at this place. If you are looking for a great spot for breakfast in Mississauga, you will not be disappointed at Panagio's. You can count on freshness in food, a quality menu that is sure to keep you coming back and above all great service. You have to check this place out, your Belly and your wallet will thank you."}
{"text":"Panagios to me is better than your average breakfast dine-inn spot! I have tried quite a few things on the menu and this includes lunch and dessert options. Portions are very generous and food is really good! Just a bit pricey but you will leave satisfied! Service is really good here as well!"}
{"text":"I am a local and was very excited then this place opened in our hood. However the quality of food was disappointing. I always older pouched eggs bennies but this place fails to cook them to proper runny yolk consistency. It was just hard boiled inside. We hardly finished our breakfast not that the portion were big it's just that food unbearably bland! The couple next to us left with safe almost full plate. I so wanted to love this place but the first thing first coming to breakfast place I want my eggs done right! I think this place needs better cooks in the kitchen. Please train them to do proper eggs, it's breakfast place for god sakes! Other than that the ambience the waiters all good."}
{"text":"Had court in the morning at the Scarborough Landlord and Tenant board and have been meaning to try this place for a while and was in the area.   $5.99 for a breakfast. 3 eggs, a meat (sausage, bacon, or ham), served with home fries and toast.   Ordered my eggs over medium. Perfectly cooked. Home fries were a bit cold and that's where they lost a star from me. Sausage was typical, frozen mass produced meat. It was ok. Toast was good.   Service was great.   All in all a good place to grab a good, wholesome breakfast for a cheap price. Coffee was $2.50!which was a rip off to me but meh! Whatcha gonna do.   Solid 3.75. Rounding up."}
{"text":"I find myself underwhelmed each time I'm here. It is a solid breakfast place, with plenty of options but nothing that blows me away. For every good thing, there seems to be a negative so you end up feeling like, meh it was okay.  As an example, the home fries are executed really well with great seasoning. Absolutely the best thing on my dish. On the other hand, I ordered the three eggs to be soft poached but they came almost fully hard. I was disappointed since eggs is a basic staple of any breakfast joint, and should have been the first thing to be done correctly. Meh, have had better."}
{"text":"All I can say is YUM!  FINALLY a brunch joint in my neck of the woods! Our waitress was great! The food was awesome! I was definitely pleasantly surprised. You have to try the cluckin' good and the sausage is pretty good here too! The Nutella and strawberry waffles were amazing as well! Adding this place to our new go to brunch spots. Look out Bobby's, Panagio's is truly a gem!"}
{"text":"After moving to Brampton we experienced breakfast-withdrawal.  Although there are many cheap places for breakfast, there are not a lot of restaurants that offer quality food.  I'm talking real hollandaise, a well poached egg.  I'll even pay a little more, but there was *nothing* around the airport for this (seemingly).  We found this place, and we were so pleased, this is my favourite place for breakfast.   Well made breakfast entrees ranging from eggs benedict, to omelettes, to standard sweet fare like pancakes and waffles.  Oh, and there's chicken and waffles, and eggs huevo with a kick, breakfast burritos and about five different iterations of deliciousness in the form of grilled cheese.  And bacon.  Don't forget the bacon.  It's even written on the walls of this place.  I haven't found anything to complain about.  I've been there about five times now and the service has always been prompt and friendly.  I even went on December 28th on my way home from night shift thinking I deserved a nice quiet breakfast and entered into a mad house as a table for one.  It didn't matter, I got seated right away.    I've ordered Huevos of the Ranch (eggs with salsa, guacamole, tomatoes and feta served over crispy fried tortilla chips), the corned beef and hash (self-explanatory), the smoked kielbasa and swiss eggs benedict (sooo delicious), Kat's Grilled Cheese (turkey, feta, cheddar cheese and mayo).  I liked them all!  Maybe the eggs benedict more than the others but I don't know if you've noticed.. I have a thing for hollandaise."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!!!  Is this a franchise? Food is salty and the eggs they use are very small.  I find it expensive as well. Close to $20 with my 15% tip for 2 tiny eggs potatoes and corn beef and of course coffee.  I will not recommend this place....other places are more reasonable. Waitress is very nice and quick in her service (only thing I like)."}
{"text":"This is just okay. The website makes this place look a lot better than it actually does. I can't speak for the Mississauga location, but the Scarborough one pretty much looks like an old Mcdonalds inside - with crowded tables.  Not worth making a trip here, but if you're in the area its a cheap option."}
{"text":"A good place for breakfast/brunch  Quite good choices in the menu. We had omelette with mozzarella cheese, mushrooms and tomato from the create your own section. And had french toast glazed banana. Both were good, no artificial taste booster or additives. Tastes great!! The servers were very nice and service is prompt. A nice place to go again."}
{"text":"Split the Panagio's big breakfast with my bf, it was very filling overall and was a good deal.   However, the waitress was rude in a quiet way, and it really bothered us.   Really liked how the toast actually had butter on it, unlike at the other breakfast places I've tried.   The fries were really good though, but it had some weird flavouring that tasted like bbq chips.    Overall, good food worth every dollar but could have better wait staff"}
{"text":"It was a good meal. Coffee was great. Service was ok, too. It was a good experience for someone like me who'd prefer dimsum and rice over toast ,eggs, and homefries for breakfast."}
{"text":"I came here with my sister after reading the good yelp reviews. I was not disappointed. There were lots of options to choose from, I got the Panagio's Western holiday. It was a western omelet wrapped in a tortilla smothered in hollandaise sauce. DELICIOUS! My sister had the basic 3 eggs and turkey bacon and a side of pancakes.. everything was  cooked really well. I am coming back for sure to try some of their other options. It wasn't very busy and all the customers in there seemed to be enjoying their food. Nice little joint and the serve was a little scattered brained but nice."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast spot in North Mississauga. Why?  - Service is friendly and while there are line-ups, they move quickly - The menu is great. Lots of variety and healthy choices (if you want) - The food is great and not just piled on a plate (nicely arranged) - The Home Fries are really good! - They don't put those little plastic containers of jam directly on the food (hate that!) - They'll give you a booth, even for 2 people, if it's available (no, \"sorry, that is for 4 people\") - The prices are reasonable for the service and quality - The hot chocolate is awesome! - The hours are easy to remember 7am to 4pm, 7 days a week. Easy peasy!  So refreshing to see a clean, diner style environment with friendly staff that isn't as \"country\" as Cora's or as plain as Sunset Grill. You'll pay a couple of dollars more than those other breakfast spots, but it's worth it. And if you do luck out for a booth, you'll be very comfortable.  Finally, go when it's not busy if you're trying it for the first time. Then you'll know that it's worth the wait when it is busy."}
{"text":"If you looking for a filling breakfast to start your day then look no further.   Tried the big breakfast just to see how big it was. 4 Eggs, 2 bacon, 2 sausage, 2 Ham, 2 fluffy pancakes, 2 buttered toast, 2 slices of cantaloupe and a huge pile of Cajun spiced potatoes. This meal will fill the biggest of eaters and will put you in an instant food coma. I think the meal was $11.49 but don't quote me on that. I was so out of it after finishing the meal that I forgot how much I paid.  Also got a chance to try the smoked kielbasa Swiss Benny and I believe it was $12.49 for this meal. The hollandaise sauce was okay and the eggs were poached really well. The smoked meat was like sausage meat which was good but I much prefer smoked salmon.  The service was quick as there were not many customers. Overall, a pretty decent breakfast joint."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in the area by bar and amazing service !  The breakfast special is amazing value"}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Panagio's today! Ive been here a couple times and it is also great from the friendly staff to the fresh and fast food. I had my usual Eggs and more with french toast and it was amazing! they use a special yellow halla bread hand cut every day for the french toast and it is so thick and tasty. The homefries were on point as always and i left feeling like i needed a nap cus the portions are huge.   This is definately my new regular spot, oh and the free wifi is a nice touch!"}
{"text":"Great classic breakfast with amazing server. The restaurant was busy but service was quick. Ordered Panagio's big breakfast and Oreo pancakes (a must!). Four of us left feeling so stuffed. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Came in here one morning around 10 am and only 3 tables had people eating. There was only one server working. My mom and I both ordered coffee to drink. When I was about to take a sip there was bright red lipstick stain on my cup. I advised the server and she looked lost, until I suggested she change the cup. I watched her pour the coffee from the stained mug into the new mug. I was going to say something but didn't drink the coffee instead.  I ordered the big breakfast, it comes with 4 eggs, sausage, bacon, ham, fruit, homefries, and 2 huge pancakes all for 10.99 which is a steal. The food was great, I have no complaints it really hit the spot. I didn't finish all of it, it was a lot of food. I didn't touch my pancakes either, kinda forgot about them cus there was so much food.  The customer service lacked a little. The server didn't come over to our table once until I had to ask her for the bill. Everytime I looked at the chefs corner we locked eyes. Which made it uncomfortable and kinda wierd.   I would come back again, it really is a great breakfast place, and its cheap."}
{"text":"Greetings!! Here right now having breakfast and so far so good. Home fries were delicious and our waitress Michelle was awesome!!! Definitely recommend and would return whenever back in the area!!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places I've been too. My waitress was super friendly and helpful with the menu and ensuring I was enjoying my experience at the restaurant. The food was really good and they have a lot of creative and delicious items on their menu that you won't find at other breakfast joints. The place is very clean and has very modern yet trendy decor. This will definitely be my new breakfast spot (and being somewhat close to work is a plus for me )."}
{"text":"Not sure what the craze is about this place. Would rather go to any other breakfast place. Too much time was placed on the seemingly witty pop culture nicknames on the menu and not enough time teaching service and crafting a good menu. Guacamole advertised but came as a paste, laughable that places still serve this!   What was unfortunate is our server was training another server and not once was my water refilled or coffee. Only came to drop off the food and to bill. Place was almost empty except for two other tables. What a terrible place. Asked server for suggestions didn't really tell us anything to try. 'Everything's good'.   Also the washroom smelled like death. Not a good thing to write about this place. Food was less than mediocre, poutine had potential but fell flat."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I like to come here when we're feeling the need for some extra love in our breakfasts. It's always busy in the restaurant, so come early! Service is usually pretty fast and the atmosphere is cozy and fun! They have some pretty great waffles and pancakes (their chocolate chip banana pancakes are pretty good and I LOVE their banana peanut butter waffles), but my only qualm is that there isn't a whole lot of selection for non-meat eaters. Not really complaining though, because when I come here, it's ALWAYS for the waffles or pancakes."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to trek out into the snow this morning to have brunch at Panagio's. A friend of mine suggested that I should go try them out and I'm glad I finally had a chance to.  They have a great breakfast deal where you get 3 eggs, bacon, ham, or sausage for only $4.99. However, we arrived shortly after 11 am so we weren't able to get the offer :(. We both decided to get that meal and it was served to us all fresh and hot pretty quickly. The woman serving us was friendly and made us feel welcome during our visit.  Overall, it was a pleasant visit and I would definitely visit and try something different. They have a variety of choices to choose from, including Oreo pancakes :O."}
{"text":"Went here a few weeks ago for the first time. We were a table of 3 and the place was clearly busy. We didn't wait too long for a table but we waited about 15 mins before anyone came to take our order. Menu has a lot on it and prices are fair. I got the tex mex messy burrito. It was decent but the service was horrendous. Our waitress barely ever checked on us to refill drinks. We finally got her to grab us to go boxes then we could no longer get her to our table to grab the bill. We kept trying to get her attention and she completely ignored us. We tried to get other servers attention and nothing. To the point where very loudly we were saying \"excuse me\" but nothing. I was so tempted to leave without paying. It took us 20+ mins to get the bill!!! Plus there was a line up out door.. you'd think they wanted to get those people in. Finally a cook saw us and grabbed our waitress. Will not be returning. What was supposed to be a quick brunch turned into a 1 hour and 45 minutes frustrating ordeal."}
{"text":"Probably my favourite breakfast restaurant! Great place to spend the mornings with family and friends. I always go with my parents and it's a great place to spend quality time together. Love the food there and servers are really friendly."}
{"text":"What a great place for breakfast, brunch or lunch! So many different choices of what to eat from the usual eggs, bacon, sausage combos to pancakes, waffles, wraps, etc. They also have a breakfast special where you can get 3 eggs, 2 slices of toast and choice of bacon, sausage or ham for $5.59 before 11 a.m. Other items on the menu are reasonably priced at around $10 or so. The place is nicely decorated and clean, just enough natural sunlight coming in, not too loud and great food. I'll definitely be back to try their pancakes or waffles next time!"}
{"text":"I've passed by this restaurant so many times and I've been dying to try it ever since it opened. I never got the chance to come here because I always ended up going to Cora. I have to say, I like this restaurant much more than Cora! The only downside is that it's a lot smaller than Cora so if you're waiting for a seat, you might have to wait a while. The number one reason why I like this restaurant is because of the variety of selections they offer - sandwiches, burgers and breakfast food. I decided to stick with breakfast food the day I came here. I got the omelet which came with a side of fruits, toast and hash browns. I was particularly pleased with their hash browns because they seasoned it so that it didn't taste like potatoes that you get at any other breakfast restaurants.I also couldn't help myself and ordered French toast. They added cinnamon to their French toast which really elevated the flavour. I appreciate the extra spices that they add to their food which makes them stand out from other breakfast restaurants. This is the perfect go to breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"MY FAVOURITE BREAKFAST SPOT! Came here with my boyfriend today around 12:30pm for a late breakfast. Our server greeted us right away, told us to sit anywhere, and said she would be right over to clean the table we chose to sit at (all the empty tables were dirty, busy morning I'm assuming).  We both ordered Panagio's Big Breakfast ($15), which comes with 4 eggs, 2 slices of ham, 2 slices of bacon, 2 sausages, 2 slices of toast, the best home fries in the world, fruit, and 2 fluffy pancakes. That's a ton of food for $15 if you ask me, and it all tasted DELICIOUS.   We were able to ask for 2 of the eggs cooked over easy, and the other 2 scrambled, instead of having all 4 eggs the same way, which is nice that they do that if you request for it. The bacon slices are thick and cooked perfectly, and the home fries are my absolute favourite.   I highly recommend this place. The prices are very reasonable, the food quality is great, the service is very fast and friendly, and the amount of food you get is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Clean place fast service good food! loved the waitress she was fast and attentive one of the best waitresses I've had in a very long time!  Good job Helen!! staff is friendly make you feel welcomed i defiantly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Fist time here this morning for brunch and was impressed! We had some eggs benny. Everything tasted great (especially the seasoned home fries). The service was great too. Got a bit busy by the time we were leaving. Definitely would reccommend."}
{"text":"I was in Mississauga for a day and was searching Yelp so I decided to try this place out. I had a Greek omelette. I wouldn't consider it great when considering the high rating of the grill, but it was good. The 'home fries' (really potato chunks) were crispy, well flavoured but slightly salty for my taste. So the food was good, but not amazing. However, I will say the service is really good. I got my food so fast. So I think this place deserves a four for good food but great service."}
{"text":"Great food! We ordered a number of different dishes from the menu and we all enjoyed everything. We got the following menu items: - Grilled cheese with poutine - Grilled cheese with home fries  - Waffle with strawberries and whip cream - Greek salad  - French Toast - omelette with home fries and toast   Grilled cheese melted in your mouth. Poutine had the right amount of gravy and cheese ratio. The service however needs improvement. We got served coffee in dirty cups that had lipstick stains. When we asked for other cups it took about 5 minutes to get. Please clean comes properly before giving to customers. We will come back and try other items."}
{"text":"Pros: - awesome homefries - pretty diverse menu  Cons: - a bit pricey for me  Recommended Dish: Anything with homefries"}
{"text":"This is more of a family run type breakfast joint. It's probably one of the best I've been to in the Scarborough/Markham area.   They have all day breakfast, as well as diner style food. Portion sizes are on he larger size, prices are slightly on the higher side, and food quality is also pretty good. I'd say it's worth what you pay.   There are a few vegetarian options, but not really anything vegan-friendly, even if you were to alter ingredients.   I would say it's in between Markham Station and Cora's, which are generally the most popular options in Markham/Scarborough.   I'd definitely give this a visit. I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast today . The food taste great !! Great portions and very tasteful . Everything was well done and hot like I like it . Customer service was alright I have no complaints just happy I came here . I definitely recommend this place ."}
{"text":"I've been to Panagio's quite a bit and I loved the breakfast place in the beginning. However, things are going way downhill recently.    The mugs are not cleaned properly (i.e. lipstick stains) and has a strange dirty smell. The service is pathetic. I'd sit and wait 10 minutes without getting WATER. I've even waited 30 minutes for pancakes and when I finally did get my pancakes, it wasn't even cooked properly (raw in the centre, yummy).  Goodbye Panagio's, forever."}
{"text":"3.5 star? Come on, Yelpers, how can we be friends?  Admittedly, it took me a while to venture to Panagio's but it's mostly because I thought that it's a greasy spoon type of joint. Not so. I've been there twice now and I'll definitely keep coming back. Best part: it's closer to my house than Sunny Morning, which so far has been my favourite breakfast/brunch spot in Mississauga.  The space is kinda cool, with plenty of tables and a nice decor. Service is super nice and quick. I tried the Greek and spinach and feta omelettes, breakfast burrito and Pete's panini. Everything was really tasty and not at all greasy. Their home fries are yummy! The portions are generous and the food is reasonably priced.   I really hope that you can look past the 3.5 star and give it a try!"}
{"text":"Move over Denny's!! My new fav breakfast spot. The food is so good & the portion sizes are very large."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for the next best breakfast place, and was super happy to find one in my area. I was skeptical at first since this place is a chain, but I was actually pleasantly surprised.   Price Range(Not including tax and tip): $3-$6 for beverages, $5-$18 for food. On par with most breakfast/diner places.   Food (Taste/Portion/Menu) - 5/5 I've only been here once but I really loved what I got. I had a coffee crisp cappuccino and man it was amazing. I was worried it would be too sweet but it was not, I could really use another one right now. I also had the breakfast burrito and I added a 2nd meat (bacon and sausage). It was really filling (had to take a nap when I got home) and tasted amazing. It was filled with a lot of meat and had the right blend of veggies.  They have a LARGE menu full of breakfast and lunch items, they really have anything you're craving.   Atmosphere - 4/5 It has a very basic look, looks like almost every other small/mid sized breakfast place. It's nice on a Sunny day because this place has a lot of windows so the sun comes right in, which I really liked. There are a fair amount of seats so it does work for mid to large sized groups, we had a group of 6 and found a table really easily. We went on a weekday during the Christmas break so be-careful on busy days as this restaurant isn't really big. It has its own parking lot so parking is easy to find.   Service - 3.5/5 So the waiters/waitresses are really nice, easy to talk to and super friendly but you could tell they are overworked. They aren't super on the ball with things like filling up water, but they do come and check that your meal is going well. I will say if you're in need of a quick meal this isn't the place for you because it takes a while (about 20+ mins) for the food to come out. I would avoid going during busy times cause I could see the service and waiting times taking an even bigger hit during it.   Would I go again? For sure, I want that Coffee Crisp Cappuccino again.   Lash's Recommendations  Coffee Crisp Cappuccino - Great if you want something thats sweet with a hit of coffee.   Breakfast Burrito - I recommend adding a 2nd meat to it, but if you're a fan of breakfast burritos, this one is really good."}
{"text":"Thoroughly enjoyed the grilled cheese. Best bread ever!!!!! Good prices for the amount given. Staff was friendly and attentive. Pretty busy place on the wkd, so definitely get there early to grab a table. Unlimited coffee for dine in, so come prepared :)"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday around 9am and we were seated right away, however after 10 mins there was a line of people waiting to be seated. The food portion is huge and I recommend only getting one plate, and not splitting a plate of pancakes or waffles w your party as a side; you're not going to finish everything. Food tasted good too. Our server was super nice and took his time to explain the basics and gave recommendations. Atmosphere inside is very nice and clean. I would definitely come here again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying WOW, not sure why they have low reviews but also humans tend to complain about the smallest things and we love to place blame. This was my first time here, I usually go to the Scarborough location (amazing food), been to the Creditview location once (thumbs down). Boy am I glad they've decided to open up shop here in Mimico, no more trekking it to scarb for my big breakfast. First of all the server , I think her name was Julia (I have the worst memory) I went on November 1st around lunch hr. Anywho, she was amazinggg. Super friendly and efficient, I mean the place was half full and she was handling things on her own w a breeze. Food came out in adequate time, was hot on arrival, she came often enough to ask how things are going, chit chatted w us a bit, asked us if we needed anything, didn't try and drop the bill before we were ready to leave. there were kids eating nearby as well and she was so cute w them.  After i asked her name I kept addressing her by name and she didn't get annoyed lol (i was mostly teasing) I can literally say its the best customer serviced I've ever received at a restaurant. I went with my sister, we both ordered the big breakfast which we knew we couldn't eat but she was adamant about bringing some left overs for her baby (aka dog) lol. The big breakfast comes w like 4 eggs , sausage/bacon and ham, 2 pancakes, toast, and homes fries(seasoned potatoes). so much food for only like 13$ I believe. Everything tasted great and great value for your money for sure. I especially love the home fries , they are seasoned so well and have the right amount of crunch to them yummmmm Ok this is becoming too long.. In conclusion, great place , new, clean, amazing vibe and fully recommended"}
{"text":"Food- Big portions!! If you're hungry and looking for a great breakfast place in Mississauga I highly recommend this one. I was feeling a benny so I ordered the Turkey Kalbasa & Swiss (comes with fruits and home fries). Hit the spot! Came with about 4 pieces of kalbasa, a poached egg on each English muffin, Swiss cheese and hollandaise sauce! Pretty good. Not to salty, filling, and flavourful! I tried my friend'a benny, the Bonjour Benny, and my friend who owned a deli shop pointed out to me that she could taste that the Montreal smoked meat was previously frozen and not fresh. Yes, a little bit of a turn off, but overall pretty good in flavour. I prefer the kalbasa if you're stuck between the two!   My other friend ordered the big breakfast, and it's true to its word... it is BIG! Served as a whole breakfast with 3 eggs, home fries, sausage, bacon etc plus 2 pancakes, you're bound to be more than full + have leftovers if ordering this one! Highly recommend as well.   Price- $8-20. Average pricing ranging from about $10-15! You get a lot for the quality, portion and price.   Service- came here on a Sunday morning after partying all night. Line was almost out the door. Decided to wait and it surprisingly went by fast! Less than a 15 minute wait and our party of 6 was seated. When we sat down we were given water right away (as asked) and menus. Throughout we were helped with our menu, checked up upon and overall had a great experience.   Verdict- if I'm ever in the area for breakfast i would definitely drop by and try something new!"}
{"text":"This place has a comfortable atmosphere, and their Oreo pancakes are a must. I'm pretty sure I didn't even stop to breathe while eating them. Great seasoning on the home fries as well! Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"I've been to Panagio's twice & overall, it's just okay.    Food: - The Big Breakfast does fill you up.  It gives you a huge amount of food for your $.   - The Breakfast Burrito - very bland.   Service: One of the waitress makes me question what she's doing half the time.  She doesn't come around to refill coffee - actually, she barely comes around at all.    Overall, it's a decent place if you want a large average breakfast."}
{"text":"I came here after work for a late breakfast. I ordered the Apple Cinnamon french toast. I've always considered french toast a fullproof meal but I was clearly wrong. My french toast was thick which I love but it seemed like it was very lightly dipped in the eggs bacause the middle tasted like regular toast not like bread that soaked up the eggs, milk and cinnamon. Also, I was very disappointed in the apple cinnamon topping. They didn't peel the apple before cooking them down. Anyone who bakes or cooks would sum that up to laziness. When you cook apples they become melt in your mouth soft but the skin remains chewy. You would never want the eat an apple pie with those contrasting textures. Overall my meal was meh but the servers were friendly and the restaurant was bright, open and clean. I'm sure other items on the menu are much better. I also liked the fact that they offer turkey bacon and coconut water in the coconut. I can't say for sure if I would go back to try it."}
{"text":"Awesome place for brunch! I came here with a group of friends since we wanted a change from the usual, Cora's, and this place definitely met expectations. I was craving something sweet this day, so I ordered the peanut butter banana waffle with whipped cream (because what new year's resolution...? lol). Great combination of soft and crunchy, and it even came with a bit of fruit on the side (would have loved to have more fruit, but whatever). My friends were more on the savoury side with eggs and toast and bacon. One of them forgot to order her bacon well done, but the waitress was super sweet and friendly and offered to take it back to crisp it some more. Nothing fancy in terms of food, but definitely satisfying overall. When I arrived, there was no line which was perfect for us! But the line grew quickly - so when the other reviewers warn about lines and waiting, they know what they're talking about.  Can't wait to come back for more!"}
{"text":"I really dislike the staff. They are not very accommodating and quite snobby.  We walked in at 3:20 and they wouldn't seat us. They close at 4. There's was at least 5 tables occupied and they had lots of space but they made us do takeout (which they start at 3:30). But either way this was ridiculous because 40 mins is plenty of time to sit and eat and be done before 4 for two people."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious, this is my go to hangover breakfast spot. I usually go for the eggs florentine or the breakfast poutine (I love hollandaise sauce) but the breakfast burritos are always a good option as well. The servings are a decent size (I rarely finish the entire plate) and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Panagios has always been my favourite when it come to brunch resto! This is my first time to try the BLT poutine and it really delivered satisfaction and exceeded my expectation.The blend of lettuce with the cheesy goodness of the poutine is a real flavour one can devI can honestly say panagios is one of the best brunch Restos in Mississauga..Our server is not that impressive though,I'm soo turned off of how she was constantly asking the table beside us how they are doing but ignoring to ask us??This is just so wrong and I got turned off..good thing the food was good but the service from this one server is disappointing.... If you will treat all customers with equal respect and genuine service then you can truly say you're doing a great job..A note to the server-Treat all customers equally,I don't know how you judge customers but you need to know how to respect all individuals regardless on how you perceive them. Other than that food was great!!To the management: Please screen your servers carefully,they should be respectful and courteous to all customers regardless of their own judgements..."}
{"text":"The line-up is pretty long on the weekends if you get here during late morning.   This is not a huge place but it's definitely nice inside; clean and modern. After the wait is over you are taken to your seat by one of their friendly staff and seated. Their service is great. If you come in a small or in a large group they are able to split your bill.   The food is delicious. Their menu is extensive and it has everything you would want/need for a great brunch. They are accommodating to your diet as well in cases where you can't eat meat."}
{"text":"Panagio's is an all day breakfast joint that caters to an underserved part of town. Located at the intersection of McCowan and Nugget, this place serves up brekkie and brunch well into the early afternoon (closing daily at 4pm).  The prices are modest and portion sizes are generous for what you pay. As far as taste goes, I think the food stacks up to pretty much anywhere else, spare for a few places. It's also pretty comfortable, with the entire facade featuring large windows and retracted blinds for an unobstructed view. Politeness and speed also seem to be the standard, with a single server and a cook or two being able to handle multiple customers at any given time.  If you're hangry and anywhere near Scarborough during said emergency, Panagio's got'cho back, no problem."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot. Good size portions, and the home fries are awesome (crispy and seasoned). I'm a big fan of the texmex messy burrito."}
{"text":"I think panagios is a type of place you have to go knowing what to expect. This isn't a high end brunch joint like the places you'll find downtown. This filling food at a good price to fulfill your brunch needs. They have a lot of things on their menu but the classics seem to please everyone.   Personally I found the service to be fine really enjoyed meat lovers omelette had a high meat to egg ratio. Home fries were great. All of it was salted a little too much but nevertheless was very satisfied."}
{"text":"Disgusting!!!  At first I already got a bad vibe because they seated us and never gave us our menu. Other people that came in after us got their menu. Then we ordered and asked for water and they never brought it to us until we asked for it. The waitress was like 'Oh right'. Wth kind of service is this?   I went in there and I ordered a burrito and my friend ordered and benedict and when he was eating, he found at least 3 short curly hair while eating his. Yuk! Mine was ok until I decide to eat the honeydew slice that comes with our food. When I bit into the honeydew, it was sweet and not bad. The second bite..eew there was a hair! like curly black hair! Ewk! I looked to the kitchen and I was like oh...they need to cover their beard or something.   At first when my friend spotted the hair, we were like fine who cares and didnt want to create problems but 2nd, 3rd, 4th?? are u kidding me? At the end, we didnt doggy bag any food and the waitress asked why and we told her and all she said was sorry and gave us the bill.   Never going back there again!"}
{"text":"The wait when you arrive at Panagio's is a bit disorganized as they didn't have a hostess. Everyone would wait there between 5-15mins just to be approached and asked how many was in the party. The server that approached us (we had a party of 8) decided to give a table of 8 to the guests that were a party of 3 and was lined up 2 parties behind us. That was definitely a bad decision on her part. I questioned and another guest questioned why she did that and she stated that it might be crowded- yet she never asked if we'd mind. Either than this hick up, the food was great and the server who took care of our table was great when we finally got sat. We got the big breakfast, huevos of the ranch and the piggy smalls poutine. The big breakfast was typical, but their bacon was cooked perfectly. The huevos of the ranch wasn't what I had expected as I've had something similar in a few other establishments, but it was still yummy. As for the poutine, living in the states for more than a year and a half, I had to get one for breakfast and it was definitely satisfying!!!"}
{"text":"The food is great and fairly inexpensive. The problem is their staffing, there were clearly very short staffed we had to ask for water 3 times and it came in paper cups because they ran out of actual glasses. It took 45 minutes to get simple breakfasts!"}
{"text":"Panagio's Breakfast & Lunch is a new franchise restaurant currently have 2 locations in GTA.  One can get quite confused with all these breakfast/brunch places which all have similar setup and menu: Cora's, Sunset Grill, Egg Smart just to name a few.  This location used to be a Baker Dozen's and Panagio's did a good job in remodelling, the layout is really similar and I got confused for a split second thinking it is a self served place.  With the East facing windows, Panagio's is a great place for that early breakfast with the bright sunlight beaming through.  3 Eggs any Styles ($4.99) was served in a reasonably amount of time.... not everyone is that lucky to have a hour for breakfast. The potatoes though plenty were a little over seasoned.  Wait staffs were friendly and checked on me frequently to see if I need refill for my coffee (bottomless $1.99)."}
{"text":"The food was alright but the service was bad. The employees seemed outright miserable, our waitress left halfway through our meal without us even knowing. It took forever for us to order and to pick up the check. I love breakfast but I'll be eating it elsewhere"}
{"text":"This is my new breakfast spot! This place definitely pays attention to detail. The spinach & feta omelette stood out to me. Even though the portion wasn't as big as other breakfast spots, the taste and quality was A+. The side potatoes are seasoned too & taste amazing. Try the Banana Foster French toast too, one of the best French toasts I've had in a long time!   Only thing keeping this place from getting 5 stars is because we were rushed, so we didn't get to fully enjoy the food. Other places usually let you stay until you finish your meal, a couple of minutes after closing, but our waitress definitely did not, and kept on reminding us how many minutes we had"}
{"text":"My partner insisted we try out this place for brunch. The place was quite packed for a Friday morning and the walls were decorated with words on a canvas that would make you laugh or rethink about food. It certainly caught my attention.   I like the open kitchen that was in front of me since we sat at the high table. The service was pretty good and fast. I didn't like how they couldn't sub the cheese for another item which other places would kindly do so. The hot sauce I asked for was Tabasco sauce which I don't particularly like.   Happy:  The atmosphere was nice and casual. There was two tv mounted on the walls/ceilings so you can see the news which is nice. My soup was hot which is great. I don't like cold soup. It came with buttered toast which if I knew, I wouldn't want butter on them. The home fries was crispy and the right size.   My partner loved his egg Benedict as he likes it gooey. My other friend was very full from his waffle, but I felt that the chicken could have been a better cut, instead of chicken strips that you can buy from a box at M&M.   Not happy:  The fruit portion is very small. I still love Cora's for their large portion of fruits for a breakfast place.   Verdict:  Overall, for the value of the price and the atmosphere, I would definitely go back to it. I just wish they can sub stuff out for other stuff."}
{"text":"Pretty decent breakfast/lunch spot that seems to run your standard breakfast menu. Portions are generous. Quality is pretty good compared to other breakfast diners in Scarborough. I particularly like their home fries. Well seasoned! I would have given this spot a 5 star but I found a few undercooked potatoes in my homefries, and the wait for my food was a little longer than I had hoped on a Friday morning at 9am."}
{"text":"Flight was held up, so we all ended up exploring a bit. Stopped by this place which is in a plaza on the way to the mall. Quickly attended to by a very friendly waitress who explained the specials. Started with an amazing soup. Others got Omelette's, a Benedict of sorts, and simply eggs with bacon. Overall very good and worth trying, but relatively pricey I thought."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times- most recently on Mother's Day and even on a busy day the service was still quick and attentive.  I love their pancakes because not only are they fluffy and large but cooked perfect on the inside which I find is a miss with a lot of breakfast places.  Their side of home fries, sausage and crispy bacon are great additions to traditional breakfast goers!   I've had their Mexican omelette and it was so yummy! The ingredients tastes fresh, eggs cooked perfectly and the salsa verde was the perfect kick.  I highly suggest coming here for some great breakfast options ;)"}
{"text":"This is one of those 'you get what you pay for' kind of places. The food was fairly good for a greasy hangover breakfast type of place. I had steak and eggs and my friends got big breakfasts. Everyone was happy with their food and coffee.   The food is typical breakfast diner food. All the food was good. The service and cleanliness could use a little work though."}
{"text":"The service here is pretty slow, if they were a bit faster, I would've gave them 4 stars. I feel like their \"home-made fries,\" aren't good. Their pretty burnt and don't taste good. I've definitely had better, other than that, the food tastes pretty good! The eggs benny tasted good, also the vege omelette tasted amazing; two dishes to consider."}
{"text":"Just went here today for brunch.. Expected better. Walked in and stood there for a good 5 minutes, in FRONT of the server.. and she didn't even acknowledge us. I was thinking maybe it was seat yourself, but nope, there was a sign that said please wait haha. Eventually, I asked if we could be seated, and she walked us over and mentioned she would bring the menus... waited another 15 minutes until the menus arrived. Then, waited another 10 minutes, until I flagged her down to take our order!  When the food arrived, the homefries were WAY overcooked. On top of that, I was given no utensils.. no syrup (french toast), no ketchup. My goodness it was a trip of me trying to get the server's attention. Now, the server herself was super nice and kind, maybe she was super busy, but honestly I felt super invisible and irrelevant there. The food in   The food itself was decent, nothing 'wow' and not bad, but just same ole' brunch place. Expected a bit more. The pricing on it is acceptable though.   I don't plan on returning."}
{"text":"This place has some really great breakfast food, and their menu ranges from classic North American dishes to non-traditional breakfasts, so there's definitely a little something for everyone. As other reviewers have pointed out, this is a busy spot, so it gets packed quick - especially on weekends. I'd recommend going either early/late on weekends just to get a table. The service is great, but can get a little slow as the restaurant packs up."}
{"text":"It was my first time at Panagio's today and I left a fan!   Panagio's was really packed at 1030 in the morning on a Sunday, as expected, with the dining room full and lineup for a table out the doors! I knew that I had picked a great place for brunch.  As I was waiting for a table, I watched servers and cooks have all hands on deck to help one another out which was really great to see. Servers' shirts read different breakfast-related saying such as, \"Bacon is the main reason why I am not a vegetarian\" which was really cute.  I had Bonjour Benedicts and was eagerly excited as it was my first time having eggs benedicts, EVER. Yes, it took me 29 years to finally try it! In my defense, I only started eating \"runny eggs\" about two years ago (I am a scrambled eggs type of girl). It was DELICIOUS. Being from Montreal, the smoked meat in the eggs benny was just such a great pairing.   Portions are also very friendly and the price is right! Certainly recommend this place to others and will be back!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for breakfast in scarborough. Prices are fair, portions are good and the food is yummy.  I usually try to have every item on the menu if I can. Like the Mexican breakfast stuff they offer."}
{"text":"Portions are huge, prices are fair, quality is great. Delicious pancakes, eggs, home fries, and turkey bacon. Good little breakfast spot"}
{"text":"Had the California Club.  Chicken was bland N needed seasoning. Had to add mustard to the sandwich which helped a little. The potatoes also needed something more to it. Coffee was weak.  My friend had the pancakes which were heavy and under cooked.  They promote their love for bacon and all things pork. But their Ham meh and the Bacon just ok. Nothing special.  The service was great and price was decent.  3* Bc it was it's just middle of the line ... nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"Your typical breakfast/lunch diner. It's a step up from Denny's, but nothing special. Unfortunately, there aren't many good breakfast places around this area."}
{"text":"First time customer here and I'm very happy with food and service. The portions are large that I couldn't finish what I ordered. Helen, the server provided exceptional service. The quickest and most attentive server. No complaints here :-)"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Tuesday morning to satisfy a craving for Eggs Benedict.  The restaurant was half full and I was told to sit where I like.  My waitress was polite and did not appear uncomfortable when I asked her to decide between peameal bacon or ham for their Eggs Benny.  (I always ask servers to choose when options are given and sometimes that doesn't go over well)  The eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise sauce was also very good. The peameal bacon was a bit large for the English muffin so I had a few bites without muffin. Not a big deal but a slightly larger muffin or smaller cut of bacon would stop people like me from complaining about not having a proper bacon-to-muffin ratio on the plate.  Potato squares were cooked well and the fruit (orange slice, pineapple wedge and melon slice) that were on the plate were so small they shouldn't have been there. That being said they were fresh and juicy but could have been larger. (Like the muffin) ;)  Overall experience was good and I will most likely return."}
{"text":"Very quick service at this Panagio's.  The portions are large and the price is very fair.  The breakfast potatoes are seasoned perfectly.  Lots of parking available.  Plenty of seats however it does get very busy at 11:30 ish."}
{"text":"We were visiting Mississauga and Toronto from Florida, US and decided to check this place out for brunch. I tried their Rueben sandwich with onion rings and they were both delicious. My 4-year old son loves his waffles with scrambled eggs and I could tell he really enjoyed his meal. Turkey bacon strips were to die for. We will surely stop by here next time we are in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Early bird special is a steal!  A good all-day breakfast place, which I hope will last for years! (Also super selfish with this wish as it is only minutes from home.)  ATMOSPHERE: Nice and casual. Suitable for family, young kids, or come with friends. Good sized dining room, with a mix of 4-person booths, and tables which can accommodate larger parties.   SERVICE: Very friendly staff, although during busy breakfast hours they seem short-staffed sometimes.    PRICE: Very good portions for appropriate prices.   FOOD: They've got all the basics. And some nice twists. Not a \"WOW\" place - but pretty consistent, and hits the spot when craving breakfast foods. Again, good portions.   Love the breakfast poutine - but often served beginning from lunch time on only.  My family regularly comes here, and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"The food here is the bomb!  While it's hard to screw up breakfast, some places do.  These guys kick it up a notch with their menu and portion sizes.   Prices can't be beat either.   My kids loved it more than Sunset Grill which is a win even though they're pretty consistent too.   Still, Panagio's is a great way to change things up a bit.  Had to wait quite a while to be seated as they were pretty busy.  Still, was worth while!"}
{"text":"First thing I saw when I settled down and ordered my food was an ant... Then there was another one... And another one. Never sit beside the windows!  I went on a Monday morning, the service was kind of slow but they only had 1 waitress and a cook.  I ordered the big breakfast with chocolate chip banana pancakes. Honestly, there was A LOT of food, so I took home a little more than half.  The food was good, but who can mess up breakfast food! The home fries, I love, it's like fried potatoes with Cajun dressing!  What I have to complain is the pancakes, I ordered chocolate chip banana pancakes... All I got were chocolate chips! But the food was good nonetheless.  I would probably go back because I love their home fries and general breakfast food :)  Minus the ants, which might be a problem... It is overall a good breakfast place to visit!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Scarborough/Markham area. Fresh , big and made to order!!  Lunch burgers massive!   Great place to grab a bite to eat. Coffee refills and service is quick!"}
{"text":"\"eek! methinks not\"  yup  couldn't agree more, this has to be one of the worse breakfast places I've ever been.  I was very excited to try this place with my best friend for one of our breakfast dates and this place left a bad taste in my mouth. the service was not very good at all, we started out with a lady for the first portion of our meal and then her shift was over so she left half way through our meal...didn't say goodbye or gave us a heads up, but the guy who replaced her sure did. the food left me wanting something more completely. it was pretty bland, even with ketchup and hot sauce. another thing that I couldn't get over when I was eating was how dark the actual atmosphere is, everything was dark colors and then not very bright on the inside, felt very unwelcoming.   I feel personally if you can cook at home, it would be best to do that rather then come and spend hard earned money on lackluster food.  transit options is the 501 queen streetcar/bus, and parking is on site and on the street if you can find it."}
{"text":"Delicious food in sizeable portions- I never finish my plate! Place is a bit small but the ambiance is great. Perfect for a date or brunch date with friends. Coffee is delicious!"}
{"text":"Hands down My Favourite Breakfast joint in the whole of Scarberia!  Came in on a Sunday Morning around 11:30am and the place was packed. Slight line up with 3 couples ahead of us waiting to be seated. We waited not more than 10 minutes I'd say before we were seated.  The restaurant itself is not that huge but they from what we observed they pump out food fast and so you never have to wait too long for a table.  We were seated in the front at a four seater table beside a window that ran down the entire length of the restaurant. I liked that table had a fully stocked caddy with a selection of various jams, jellies, and even peanut butter!  The menu is pretty standard of any chain breakfast spot consisting of a variety of egg dishes, create your own omelet, breakfast sandwiches, waffles, and pancakes.  I decided to keep it simple and order the 3 eggs any style served with fresh fruit, homes fries and toasted bread - I think it's a steal at only $4.99.  My fiance steps it up a notch and orders the Eggs-N-More combo which includes 3 eggs any style, choice of bacon, sausage, or ham and choice of 2 fluffy pancakes or 2 slices of french toast plus the accompanying fresh fruit, homes fries and toasted bread - Again I think it's priced very fairly at only $8.99  To drink we both order 2 cups of black coffee which smells delicious and tastes equally delicious and comes piping hot. Our waiter is very attentive and friendly and refills our coffee prior to alerting us our meals are coming up in a minute.  Boy oh Boy was I pleasantly surprised on how large the portion of food was that I received! And the Taste....Phenomenal as a simple breakfast like this can get! The Home Fries are out of this world! I absolutely love them, thick cut, crispy outside tender inside dusted in a delicious cajun sort of seasoning. I could eat a plate full of these on there own. My sunny side up eggs are cooked perfectly with slightly runny yolks just the way I like them. Oooo and the French Toast! Thick cut slices of fluffy egg bread slightly sweetened and dusted in icing sugar is spot on!  Overall I have nothing negative to say about Panagio's! Attentive waitress, prompt service, huge portions at an affordable price, tasty delicious food, steaming hot coffee and CP24 playing on the tvs......What more could you want for a Sunday Morning Brunch?"}
{"text":"We popped in here on Family Day for lunch, arriving at 1115. After a short (5 minute) wait we were shown to our table. Service from start to finish was excellent and incredibly attentive with the kids meals arriving virtually immediately. The meals themselves were hearty and tasty, everything you want from a breakfast. Our drinks were refilled regularly as well. Overall very impressed with this kid friendly breakfast spot, particular given how busy it was. We'll be back!"}
