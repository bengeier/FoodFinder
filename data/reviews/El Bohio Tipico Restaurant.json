{"text":"I read a critical review of the service at this restaurant, and that prompted me to share a different perspective. I've eaten here many times and hosted informal meetings here with people who appreciate international food. The restaurant hosted a lunch for me for 40 people on a tour of Charlotte's international restaurants, as the place is able to accommodate large groups. The service has always been extremely friendly on each of my visits and consistently top-notch, on par with any of the city's popular restaurants -- often a lot better. And by the way, I'm American. 

The food is hearty Dominican comfort food. You can arrive as early as 9 or 10 a.m. and still find plenty to choose from. You'll see lots of stewed and fall-off-the-bone-tender stewed and braised meats in pan sauces, as well as rotisserie chicken. These are served with flavorful rice and peas, yucca (cassava) or plantains on the same plate as a combo. Tacos are also a specialty, available with roasted pork or other fillings. The menu has much more that I haven't tried. The tropical fruit drinks are a nice change of pace from the usual soft drink or sweet tea. And you may find that you need a to-go box because portions are generous. 

The restaurant, cafeteria-style food line and restrooms have always been spotless on my visits. I appreciate that so much. If you are interested in trying Caribbean food in Charlotte, this is worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great food and service at this casual Dominican restaurant. Servings are huge.  I had enough left over for a second meal. Delicious roast pork, stewed chicken, oxtails, roasted skirt steak, plantains, and  your choice of several rice dishes. I love their fruit juices, especially soursop.  Sounds bad - definitely isn't!  The service is great.  They make you feel very welcome."}
{"text":"Food is good but extremely racist restaurant the first time I let it slide but this is the second time the staff ignored me to wait on Latinos behind me in line its a cafeteria style restaurant not worth the time I speak Spanish but since I don't look Latino the staff passed me by unfortunately for them that attitude doesn't fly here in America I will never return there, I have other choices for Dominican style food here in Charlotte without the racist attitude"}
{"text":"Simple and to the point, this restaurant is a cafeteria-line style restaurant with lots of options for Dominican-Caribbean comfort foods. Yes, it is authentic. The staff is friendly and courteous. 

Plus side, this Dominican restaurant serves huge portions for a good price - a bit cheaper than some of the other Dominican restaurants in the area. Appropriate for bringing kids too. The space is clean and tidy - and plenty of parking outside. Quick, casual and delicious. I will be returning to El Bohio Tipico. If you work/live in the area, definitely give it a try - you wont regret it, promise."}
{"text":"I had the ribs and white rice. Food was fresh (but it was 10:30am and taste was good. Clean atmosphere. atmosphere. Good place to go for some Spanish food."}
{"text":"Meh! This place reminds me of Blue Sky in Miami where they serve food by the pound only not as good. I ordered the Roasted Pork which was dry and the rice and red beans were bland. 

The restaurant is attached to a latin supermarket which baffles me as to how they would run out of platano maduros! A Dominican restaurant without maduros is like a Peruvian restaurant without Ceviche. 

It's in a sketchy neighborhood so be aware of your surroundings. I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"The good is amazing here.  Wow!! Fresh Caribbean food.  So much flavor.  Really tasted like homemade. The service is great.  They made suggestions, explained what's in their food and well answered all my ridiculous questions I usually have when I'm in a new place!! Very friendly.  I'm definitely coming back for more with my family."}
{"text":"Me gusta mucho la comida de este lugar, aunque el arroz le ha estado saliendo un poco granundo ultimamente, pero me encanta este lugar, el sancocho delicioso."}
{"text":"So disappointed, I ordered a soup took it to go since I was on lunch break. Started eating good flavor but the meat in my soup had blood in it, I thought maybe I was tripping. So I grabbed a piece of paper and dab the meat on it and it was blood... wish I could of took it back so they could see it ."}
{"text":"I'm from Atlanta and have visited this place both times I've been to Charlotte, NC. It's Dominican food at it's best. Good food and plentiful. Modest price. This is the place to go to for Dominican food in Charlotte."}
