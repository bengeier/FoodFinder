{"text":"Absolutely a great place to eat.  Their menu has everything from salads, Gyros, burgers, and wings to awesome meals like Greek Chicken, Chicken Parm, fantastic fish dinners, steaks and everything in between.  Service is fast and friendly.  The portions are very generous.  The staff is very helpful and attentive.  The owners are there every day to see that everyone is served properly and enjoys their meal. I highly recommend Big Bitez for lunch or dinner.  You won't be sorry."}
