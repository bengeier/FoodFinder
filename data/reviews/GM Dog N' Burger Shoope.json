{"text":"Came here for lunch.  Got a chili dog and bacon cheeseburger for less than $5.  Not bad for the price.  It is a small place.  However, don't expect much.  Three of us walked in and sat the bar.  Both the ladies working there looked up then went back to what they're doing.  One was on her phone the entire time and was forgetting customer orders left and right.  The beef patties were frozen, they use american cheese (fake cheese), and white buns.  They basically cooked a fast food joint burger which is expected for the price.  The chili dog was decent.  Chili tasted good as well as the dog.  Overall, it is cheap eats.  I can't say the food was amazing but for the money it is ok.  I'd say it is about the quality of a fast food joint just a little bit better prepared.  I do not like the idea that their cup of water came from the same faucet where they wash their hands though."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go when I come home. Everyone seems to be a regular, they're only open early, and everything is just cheap, good, and fast. I'm so happy to see them still in business every time I come back and I feel like one meal there and you completely understand Bloomfield."}
{"text":"When you go into this place you must be patient.  Chances are that you are going to have to wait to get your meal.  The place often gets very crowded and you always meet new people to talk to which makes the time goes by quickly.     I always feel more welcome by the customer, including the ones I never met before, than I do with staff there.  The food is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Do you like cheap food? Good service? Neighborhood vibes? Places that remind you of childhood joints you love and miss? Come here and remedy yourself with some tasty hot food."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in our so called visit here. We drove over from Virginia to see a Steelers game Friday 8/12 and planned to eat here. We got there a little after 4:00 pm and they were closed when the sign and there online hours say opened until 5:00 pm. Needless to say we were very disappointed we had our hearts set on eating here after seeing the reviews of the food, but we won't be coming back to try and eat there at our next visit to PA."}
{"text":"I have been passing by this little greasy spoon, dive diner for some time. I decided one Saturday that I needed to stop in and try it out. There is not a lot of seating present and you can tell most of the patrons are regulars. We found one table open and sat ourselves.   The cook/hostess/server/busser was with us in moments of being seated and taking our order. We both decided on the 2 egg breakfast with water and she was gone instantaneously. It was amazing how ephemeral she was in her movements and appeared as though she was in multiple places from time-to-time; an obvious benefit of working in such a small diner coupled with years of experience.  Our drinks and food were quick to come out and nothing looked out of place. Nothing that we ate would ever be considered gastronomy, but it was all tasty and cooked properly. The real shock was the price tag; I don't know that I could cook breakfast for that low a price. I will definitely return when I want a quick breakfast."}
{"text":"I'm becoming a regular here for breakfast. Its a great little dive diner with limited menu and open concept grill/seating at the counter. Definitely a Bloomfield thing with the regulars that seem to know everyone and welcome everyone and the staff knows everyone by name, kinda like Cheers, but not a bar. Its rare that you wait for your food and its always quite tasty, and CHEAP, and not the kind of cheap that would send you across the street to the hospital, the delicious, full happy stomach kind of cheap."}
{"text":"The BEST place to get a cheap, delicious burger in Bloomfield. It's right on Liberty Ave, but you might miss it if you don't know what you're looking for. When you walk in, you'll notice right away that it's a diner-type of environment with a fast-service motto. Great food. Great service. Great place! Cash only."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have never come in here before. I literally walk by every single day. It's your average small diner. Just what you would expect and want a greasy spoon to be. I was so hungry that I stuffed myself silly. I'm sitting here literally trying to breathe and relax so I can make the five minute trek home. I'm not kidding you guys. I'm so mad at myself because I finished my food so quickly and it was then I realized I hadn't taken any pics. Oh well just an excuse to come back again. So I had two eggs scrambled with toast, homefries and ham. Comes with coffee but I substituted with tea. Under $5. Delish!"}
