{"text":"This place is excellent for a quick and tasty slice, or get a large 1-topping pizza for $8, ready in about ten minutes.  Don't expect any miracles here, but this is good, cheap pizza. Open until 3 am on Friday and Saturday so check it out if you are drunk and hungry on 17th ave. They also sell Coke products in 12 oz glass bottles if you are into that, which I definately am."}
{"text":"One of the most popular places on 17th Ave in the wee hours of a weekend morning.

Wanna know why?

Because nothing helps the drunken state better than greasy chicken or a massive slice of pizza.

Open until 3am on Fridays and Saturdays alike, Express Pizza and Chicken draws the post-drinking/post-clubbing/early morning munchies crowd.

The food is cheap and fresh and is the ultimate reward after a drunken evening of debauchery."}
{"text":"I drive all the way across town to get this pizza... At ten bucks for a large I buy 3 and take them in my lunch. It's sooooo good!! May I recommend the pepperoni and bacon!!!"}
