{"text":"Like most people you go to sushi places I love sushi, and Sin City is some of the best in town. Their all you can eat is fair priced at $25.95 for dinner ($22.95 for lunch) and if that's not for you their rolls are all priced between $8-11.

I had three rolls in my visit the Spider roll, the Jackie, and the Durango. The spider and Jackie where absolutely delicious and some of the best sushi I have had in Vegas. The Durango, which is a deep fried roll, was just ok. They put cream cheese in it which I normally like but the taste was too overpowering and was all I could taste, even with my soy sauce and wasabi. For desert I had the fried banana which normally comes topped with chocolate syrup and vanilla ice cream, but they had neither so I substituted the strawberry ice cream and it was still very delicious.

The service here was also wonderful. It was pretty empty when I first entered and there was a lady dotted at the back near the cash register. At first I was a little skeptical since instead of seating me she talked across the restaurant to me and said I could sit anywhere. After this though they where very attentive and took my order vet promptly and I even got a few suggestions from the chefs even though I was sitting at a booth and not the bar. So all in all I would easily recommend Sin City Sushi to anyone who loves sushi."}
{"text":"August 2011, the sign out front says under new management and they are doing something right. Hopefully they keep it up, because I was here last Spring and I couldn't give them the same review. The spicy tuna roll has an extra kick of spice and they put kaiware daikon in it, so it has a fresh, peppery, smooth creamy feel. The nigiri was all fresh and sweet, the hamachi was from the belly. I can't wait to get back here."}
{"text":"Excellent service, and amazing food. Probably the best all you can eat sushi experience ive had in my area. Food always comes out quick, and everything always tastes great. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food here is repulsive. All the joy and wonder that sushi brought my life was striped away like the day I found out Santa clause wasn't real. I now know what Simba felt like eating grub in the lion kind when I bit into the rubbery mess that is the udon noodles. The rolls, I'm not sure where to start. I know realize why it's called sin city sushi because it's a sin to consume this vile 3 day old supermarket sushi. As I sat here I saw the looks of unsuspecting victims that couldn't fathom the level of disappointment that was about to ensue. The only reason this place gets 1 star aside from the fact that I can't rate it 0 stars is that the Japanese lasagna was the only thing that didn't make me wanna go to the bathroom and throw up."}
{"text":"Este restaurante de sushi es mi favorito! No hay mejor en toda Las Vegas! Muy barato y riquísimo!"}
{"text":"Wish i went the first time i was in LV. Ugh this is the BEST BEST sushi i have ever had. I'm not really one for sushi but this place just made me a regular shopper, lol. I might even go again before i leave LV. 

If you come to LV an your looking for a clean nice place to eat with fresh an delightful food, you have to attend!"}
{"text":"Great place to have sushi.  My husband likes their rolls and I like their sushi.  Yellowtail, halibut or mackerel are very fresh and served in big slices.  The service is also good.  We highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Interesting spot, great sushi rolls, great service friendly staff. Would recommend all the rolls that I tried don't think they could make a bad roll! Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"There is a all you can eat option that is a good deal, staff is friendly, sports on the TV. Try the Jaime special roll its great! Warning if you order take out they only put only a small amount of condiments, its my only complaint."}
{"text":"if you want sushi this is the place to go! we drive 15 miles across town to go here and have never been disapointed make sure to say hi to Sushi Chef Mr Jimbo he is the best!!"}
{"text":"Our first visit to Sin City Sushi -  The sushi was fresh, the service was courteous and the food was affordable.  Our favorite was the Stacey Roll."}
{"text":"Sin City Sushi has a lot of different options to choose from in their AYCE menu but if your not that hungry their a la cart menu is pretty delicious too. Their screaming O is amazing, I also love their Stacie roll, Moon roll and Misty roll. They have a lot of different types of Mochi ice cream. Their baby tako is really good too. Overall all their food is delicious and the sushi chefs and moon treat you like family."}
{"text":"Customer service is nonexistent/rude. I've had way better sushi for the same price. But if you like being ignored and waiting half an hour for your first thing to come out; then go head and hit this place up. Good luck, bring a barf bag with you!!!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place to go.. After many years  of not living on this side of town we decited to give it a shot as we didn't know of any new places that were reasonable in price we gave it a shot.. it is our new favorite place, the staff always remembers our drink orders and appetizers to start us off with. Friendly and comfortable.. a very nice environment. Most importantly outstanding food! Try the oyster shooters and ask them to add quail egg, or If you're not into that try the drumroll!! Amazing stuff!!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Sin City sushi's new location. The ambiance is fantastic, I felt very relaxed. The service is very hospitable. The chefs did a great job at preparing the sushi, it tasted wonderful! I will definitely be going back again!"}
{"text":"Yay my favorite sushi spot has re-opened!!!  Place was empty but that was better for us.  Poncho was great.  Me and my boyfriend has been going to this chain since Kai sushi days and they never disappoint.  Well maybe sometimes their service is really bad but hopeful they got better. Go eat here!!! Some of our favs

Vampire roll
Stacie roll
Ugly roll
Charlie hand roll
Baby tako
Baked green mussels 
Oyster shooters 
Jalapeño poppers"}
{"text":"THEY ARE BACK!!! Poncho, Jimbo, Moon, and Yong have finally opened they're new location and the sushi tastes as good as ever! So happy to see the Sin City family back in business!!
I went for lunch and I walked into a restaurant full of Sin City's regulars(me included) and I felt like it was some kind of reunion celebration with everyone talking to one another!  The quality of fish was exceptional as always! And it was so nice to have my favorites(Zesty Salmon Handroll, Kasia Roll, Vampire Roll, Baked Mussels)! I plan on visiting more often to reacquaint myself with the menu and hopefully try some new rolls soon!"}
{"text":"Great place! Clean, friendly, high quality sushi...a definate A+ in my book.

A crowded sushi establishment means only one thing....it's good sushi! And that is exactly what we got here...really good sushi."}
{"text":"hey everybody!! sin city sushi is now open at 8790 s maryland pkwy suite 100!!!!! quickly come down and get your sin city fix!!"}
{"text":"Wow, the sushi is sooo goood! Super fresh ingredients and the best sushi rice I've ever had. I've heard that there were big differences in sushi rice but never experienced it till now.

I did have a few little knit picks but the friendly staff and super good sushi more than made up for it. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Im supper picky with my sushi and i love this place. You feel like family. Sat at the bar had all you can eat and the chef asked what we liked and after that the dishes kept coming our way every single one was great."}
{"text":"Super slow, there were only few tables of customer, but it took almost an hour to have all our food out! Miso soup very salty, eel thin like paper. That was all you can eat, we ordered 5 orders of uni sushi, few minutes later, a guy told us that they only have 2 orders left, after a while, he came back again and said the uni is not fresh, so they cannot give us any...what the...I don't recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"My new favorite AYCE sushi place!
The moon roll was divine, but so were the other dozen rolls my group of 6 tried.  I'm serious.  Really good stuff.  And I couldn't get enough of the mussels!  

Friendly, fast service too.  We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"The staff is really friendly and makes you feel welcome here.  Got the AYCE and was pretty stuffed.  The non-sushi items were great, especially the Kushi Oyster shooters...if they WERE really Kushi Oysters.  I had the iced green tea and it was good, but I've had better.  All in all, the sushi is pretty good for the price."}
{"text":"I eat here once a week, that's four times a month folks. Young has the freshest sushi in Vegas. I dare you, I dare you! Go in there and just order a few pieces of his garlic tuna sushi and it will most likely be the best you've ever eaten. There's a joke around this restaurant that the sushi you're eating today was swimming yesterday. The owner pays a premium and buys his fish from one of the premium dealers in the industry. This establishment also has the best spicy tuna handroll I've ever had the pleasure of eating. Other rolls of note are the Stacy Roll, Sin City Roll (nice and spicy), double seared roll, Vampire roll, so many, so delicious. Aside from rolls they have a great screaming orgasm, beef yakitori, poke (Salmon or tuna), and the best damn baked mussels you're going to find out here. Absolutely incredible. As for the service, I can't comment because I'm always here mid week before 4pm and have 2-3 chefs at the bar making me food for two hours. Obviously it gets very busy at night and yes there isn't a huge amount of tables so try and get here earlier. If you want massive tables go to one of those franchise restaurants with tons of staff and chefs on board. Sin City sushi is a diamond in the rough so don't expect a ton of people waiting on you. Show up early, grab a seat at the sushi bar, and experience finely crafted seafood concoctions crafted in the elysian fields and prepared in a utopian synergy of incredible flavors and chat with some of the friendly locals as you order each new selection. Again, this is the only place I bother eating sushi anymore. Negative service reviews be damned, you will love this food. As for those of you who have gotten sick here, interesting. Like I said, I eat here four times a month and have gotten ill, never. Perhaps your little tummies shouldn't be eating sushi anymore because you can't digest it. I know lots of vegans and vegetarians who still try to eat sushi occasionally and guess what........they all get sick. Each and ever time lol. I love this place, that is all."}
{"text":"The food is awesome, wait staff is very attentive  and the atmosphere is easy and fun. The somethings wrong roll is addictive! Our new sushi place for sure!!"}
{"text":"me and my husband went to eat all you can eat yesterday and i was so happy with the food surprisingly great quality, flavor, and best of all the appetizers were great poke salad, mussels, asparagus temp, oysters and KOBE :) i couldnt believe it most ayce places dont serve kobe but they apparently just recently added it to the menu and i was happy even if it was just an order of nigiri.

id recommend this...
i love spicy so the sin city was delicious
no name hand roll yummy
stacie was recommended to me and i loved it so id recommend it to anyone

was happy and would def go back :)"}
{"text":"I almost fell asleep waiting for my food. They also forgot to serve 1/3 of our order. Most of the food were good. Just don't order anything that has garlic sauce. Sit at the bar for faster and better service."}
{"text":"For the people that said service was Excellent, I question your opinion in Excellence.
   The food here is Pretty good if you're really into sushi. The Vampire roll is my fave and has garlic ponzu sauce on top, they have Great Udon and Miso. LOVE their Poke and seaweed salad and they have a few other good ones too AND out of the 6 times I've gone, I never had to wait for a table. 
   BIG But however, Absolutely Trust in these words and the others that say the service is not good and the woman that are waiting on you are mostly standing in the back doing nothing. I have not sat at the bar yet.  
   
   If you have somewhere to be, do not come here. It's the slowest sushi restaurant I've been to in LV and I've been to at least 10 in this city. Look forward to them bringing someone else's order to your table, not checking up on you for water until after it's gone (not every time but enough times to be parched), they take your AYCE card away and don't return it so you can order more; you have to ask for it back. And thats about it. They're pleasant though, not mean at all, they just don't have things very organized and don't tend to you as they should.  

  Great food, bad service. I have not been there once out of 6 times and the service changed. Literally. I don't just bash restaurants and I hope you see I'm not doing that. I'm not hard to please and LOVE sushi. I wish SO much the service was better b.c the food really is good, it's just not here. Thats the only reason for the 3 stars, the food. So, go for the food and if you're hungry, expect to be there for a bit."}
{"text":"Ok so this isnt really a typical review. I know i know, what am i doing this review for?

WELL, im happy u asked! :)

 I reviewed the menu. As i usually do before i go to a restaurant. and this menu was uhhh, hmmm. eh :/ who made this menu?!?!?, LMAO. jk (am i?)

ANYWAYS, after trying to read this menu. im curious if this highly rated sushi spot has a few things:

 ICEE (i see) Uni, is there a limit and is it fresh or that usual ayce pre boxed stuff. IDK, but id like to know :) ICEE (i see) Salmon, do u also serve salmon belly? like goyemon does. MMmm... oh oh and ICEE (i see) Tuna, but i dont like tuna, but i LOVE white tuna (like oyshi) and fatty tuna (like yonaka). Would you happen to have white tuna at least?

IDK, maybe im blind and i dont see these fishes in the nigiri part of the menu. maybe i have to call and ask, but then what is the online menu for. maybe they focus more on the rolls and appetizers (meats) than the nigiri, but its a suhi place isnt it?  sice when is deep frying, adding mayo, cheese and extra sauces the right thing to do to fish :(
no offense to all of us over eaters, because we need the extra sauces :) (do we?)

but i shall not leave without saying something nice. from the pictures. awesome food presentation. just not a fan of all the extra fatty ingredients. 

AND sorry for eating \"my friends\" brownie on accident and thinking it would be fun to write a review about a places menu and pictures. but hey, its still my first impression, and its my personal opinion. and you may be able to pay (a lot of $) for my silence, BUTT!!! u will never take away my thoughts.. MUAHAHAHA!

next menu please :)"}
{"text":"OK sushi snobs, here's by nomination for best sushi in Vegas.  Had great  Yelp reviews so I went to check it out. Bottom line is that the food and service were exceptional. Only held off on giving 5 stars because the ambience, although clean and modern, was nothing to write home about. Besides that, this place rocks. I've never had fish so tender in particular. This from a certified sushi hound. Jessica, our server that night was super friendly and attentive. Their all you can eat is also a good deal if you're ready to fill up on sushi (which is pretty much always for me)./"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some sushi. I was visiting LV from San Francisco. I had Yelped this place and found the reviews to be overwhelmingly good. Hence, I wanted to try it even though it was off the strip. I was meeting a friend there who informed she was going to be late. I sat at the sushi bar and was greeted by Jesse (sushi chef) who offered awesome customer service as well as great recommendations, i.e., vampire roll. He handed me some sushi rolls while I waited. I ate them fast to Jesse's shocking face. I wanted to hid the evidence that I had already started to eat, lol. What makes this place great is 1. You are eating all you can, seriously. Don't let your eyes be bigger than your stomach because you don't want to waste this precious food. For 22.95 you get all your faves. I wanted Uni for lunch and its only offered on the Dinner AYCE (all you can eat) menu. All they did was charge me for the Dinner Menu 24.95, lol, awesome. You cannot beat this place. The fish is fresh. Yes, FRESH. A lot of people will say some sushi place is fresh when it's really not.  Jesse was awesome, the waitstaff was friendly. A must for any sushi lover. Jesse if you are reading this man, mahalo. Jesse complemented my sushi eating skills, lol. I dipped my fish into the soy and wasabi and put back on my rice and then ate it. I guess that is a proper way of eating sushi. If you love sushi go to this place. If you are coming from the strip and following all the directions remember its on the right side. You can make a right at the lights on Serene. I got lost so I know this is important.  If a place like this was in San Francisco a lot of AYCE places would shut down. Todai and all these other previously frozen places are just not worth it. Sin City Sushi come to San Francisco. There are great sushi places here, but not all you can eat freshi sushi at 22.95-24.95."}
{"text":"I just recently stopped going to sushi bay because of the bad service. This is my new favorite sushi spot in vegas!! I LOVED IT!! The chefs are so nice, and you get served fast. I loved sitting at the bar. They have unique items that are included in the AYCE like fried pepper poppers! Which are amazing! This place is the place to go for sushi!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent sushi!  Sin city has the best sauces and fresh fish. Mussels are the best I have had. Service was very good today. Very friendly staff. Menu selections for AYCE are good."}
{"text":"Love this place but it happens to appear that its been closed permanently. Would anybody know if there is a new location or something please let me know:)"}
{"text":"This place has worst customer service ever. Waited over an hour after ordering sushi roll. All you can eat is a joke because they never bring the order. People were walking out left and right. Owner doesn't care about your business. Do yourself a favor and try any other sushi places but this one. Horrible experience. The scam they pull is let you wait forever for food until you just get so aggravated you leave and still charge you full price! What a scam."}
{"text":"The service is unbelievably terrible. I haven't gone here and a year hoping the service got better, it didn't. Officially never coming back. Waited way too long for food and drinks when there was hardly anyone here. Forgot some of our orders. the cleanliness is awful we had stacks of plates the entire time of our time here. Just a terrible place to eat."}
{"text":"Our friends told us about this place and as luck would have it, they used to own Saporro Sushi which we used to love to go to until they sold it.  Needless to say, we couldn't wait to eat here.  We, of course had ayce and no kidding, everything we ordered was delicious!!! Our favorite rolls:  Stacie, Vampire, Wet Dream, Japanese Lasagna, Orleans & Lew. Must haves:  No Name Hand-roll,  OMG soo good!! Loved, loved, loved the baked green mussels and tako, downed several orders of the oyster shooters and also the Ikura (salmon eggs) is worth mentioning.  We also ordered our usual, California roll, shrimp tempura edamame etc. Waitress was wonderful and the timing of the foods being brought to our table was perfect.  Most  places (that we've been to and we've been to alot of AYCE) bring your rolls out all the same time but here, they brought out 2-3 types of rolls out at a time which I thought was good. It gave our party a chance to really savor the rolls in front of us and just when we thought we just ate the best rolls yet, our waitress would deliver the rest of our sushi.  Yummy!!  Our waitresses were very attentive to our needs and made sure to come & take more orders of sushi from us when needed.  The restaurant is small but I like that it gives you more of a warm, inviting sort of homey feeling.  You have to try this place.  The restaurant is clean, the fish is fresh tasting, so good it melts in your mouth, best sushi chefs and wait staff.  You can't go wrong coming here.  The only thing I wish I knew before coming here though is that they do charge you for your little kids.  It's half price so was $13 per child for dinner.  We had a 3yr old and an 18 mos.  They don't eat much and ate off our plates so I was a little bummed about that but the food was great and that made up for it.  So be ready to fork out some cash if you decide to take your kids along.  If not, go to Island Sushi down the street where we've gone to many times and they never charged us for kids and the food there is good too but in my opinion their sushi is not as tasty as Sin City Sushi."}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi spot in Las Vegas.  I love the atmosphere, location, wait staff, food, menu... everything.  Before I came here, I thought the same thing as everyone else:  \"An AYCE place in a strip mall in Henderson called Sin City Sushi?  No way.\"  Let me tell you right now that you're wrong.  The name and location are misleading.  This place has amazing quality fish.

The AYCE is something like $27 per person and that includes appetizers, nigiri, rolls, hand rolls, a bunch of other stuff and a dessert.  Obviously you can't get sashimi and you do have to eat the rice.  But it is still an excellent value given the quality of the food.  Oh, and the AYCE is not a buffet -- you have to order each round.  They don't make you finish your previous round but there is an implied expectation that you'll eat all or almost all of the food that you order -- which I think is a perfectly fair expectation.

The last thing I want to mention about this place is the waitstaff.  They are unbelievably friendly and attentive without being overly in-your-face.  They really put this place over the top."}
{"text":"Worst Sushi in vegas. I ate at alot of different sushi restaurants in vegas but \"sin city sushi\" is by far the worst. I understand all-you-can-eat sushi as more rice on nigiri sushi and rolls. The rice was absolutely huge for nigiri sushi more then 3x the size of any other sushi place i been too, it is literally 5x the piece of fish on top of it, rice balls. The service was the worst also the waitresses there don't check up you, not very friendly, and when i went there it was not busy and my food took 25 minutes to come out. Also had to wait another 15 minutes to get my check after i told the server and we were the only customers by then at the restaurant , the server was talking on the cell phone and making us wait wtf. There are great sushi restaurants in that area i would high suggest going to Sushi Wa or Sumo Sushi they also have all you can eat . Want to waste your time and money try sin city sushi."}
{"text":"Sushi was good. All you can eat was limited. Service suck big time."}
{"text":"Fresh and yummy. A lot of local places smell horrible this place doesnt smell like a dirty fish market. Great for a local spot not on the strip. I didn't give it 5 because the chefs weren't to creative but they can still make a great roll....as long as its on the menu."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot, but I've had better. Special menu rolls were really good. Other rolls not as inspired. My chief complaint here is the sushi rice, which is closest to the dreaded Costco or supermarket style of sushi rice: bland and mushy. Sushi rice should be fresh and have a slight tang from a little sugar and rice wine vinegar. You should not be able to smear it on the roof of your mouth with your tongue. 

You could do a lot worse though. Service was fine, but strained due to severe language or accent barrier. Hey, we had a good time and we left full and happy, so there you go. Yeah, we'd go back. 

Sapporo roll, my boyfriend, and vampire all were hits."}
{"text":"Great service , great attitude , lots of options on the menu. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Good selection. 

When I went, the place was packed! The food that I ordered came out within reason.  I wasn't thinking \"okay... wheres my food.\"

Felt like they were understaffed, but they definitely picked up the pace to meet the demands of customers."}
{"text":"Came here for my lunch break ordered the lunch special veggie and shrimp tempura and a Japanese lasagna. The oil that was used to fry the tempura tasted old and left a bad taste in my mouth. The sushi roll was not good lacked \"real crab/lobster \", sauce used was a bit sour. Not good will not be returning. Not sure why this place has such great reviews"}
{"text":"Love this Sushi spot, everything is fresh and the ppl are awesome. I don't eat Sushi anywhere else. All u can eat is like $25 bucks. It's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Great Sushi! In fact amongst the best I have ever had. Defenitely try the oyster."}
{"text":"Our favorite place in town by far! The chefs are great at what they do and everything is always fresh and delicious! They have a wide range of appetizers included in the all you can eat as well as many rolls. Recommend the baby tako, baked mussels, seafood salad, sin city roll, and the salmon nigiri! You won't be disappointed here!"}
{"text":"I used to go to Sin City when it was located on Eastern and Serene. The new location is a welcomed upgrade to a sushi spot that was already hitting the right notes food wise. They have a reasonably priced AYCE option and the food is always well prepared. I enjoy the side board that they use for seasonal/limited items that are available in addition to the menu. I also notice that the owner seems to be very active in the business. Always a good thing.

The only negative is that the service can be slow and the serving staff seems to get things confused often. It occurred a couple times on my last visit in the beginning of January. Not a deal breaker at this point, but there is room for improvement. Nevertheless,  staff were friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"We found our new sushi place! Went the other day around 3:00 and seated ourselves at the bar. Took a minute for someone to help us but as soon as we did we received excellent service for the rest of our visit. Both my hubby and I got all-you-can-eat. It was $23 bucks which is comparable to other all-you- can-eat sushi places. 
What I especially love about this place is that no matter what you get everything is made with excellence. Their oyster shooters were on point and it's hard to find good oyster shooters!
The guys that were working there were very thoughtful in asking us if we wanted to try certain things that they thought were good...I'm so glad we did! We tried this awesome baby octopus salad and baked mussels to die for! The guys working there said that it gets pretty busy on Friday and Saturday nights so I think we'll stick to afternoons and get the extra attention! 
We took a chance on a new place and it really paid off this time. Literally, everything that we had was amazing and tasted so fresh. Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"This was a really good sushi place. If you are in the mood for good rolls, this place is it. I'm sad & surprised to see this place closed. The chef Young is a friendly guy. I will miss their vampire, stacy, lion rolls :( 

Does anybody know if they have moved to a new location ?"}
{"text":"I love Sin City Sushi!  The food is always amazing - any roll with their  garlic sauce is to die for!  The service has been good every time we've been there and usually there's no wait to be seated.  We've been going there since they first opened and we never go any where else!"}
{"text":"THE WORST I HAVE EVER HAD!

The quality was beyond bad - the fish looked old and stale, not fresh at all.. I got home with upset stomach and diarrhea!  

Slow service - we waited for about an hour to get our order.

Horrible customer service - after telling the server that we did not enjoy the sushi because it was not fresh, she told us that this was the best sushi in town and we just did not know \"how to taste it.\"  Ridiculous! 

I love sushi and I have had sushi at so many places, and this was by far the worst I have ever had anywhere.  I definitely do not recommend going there."}
{"text":"Friday night my son, husband and I decided to go here. because we received a $50 gift certificate from our friend. I looked up the Yelp review and was very excited to see it received 4 star rating. 

When we got there I hesitated on staying to eat because the restaurant was a little on the warm side. We waited a few minutes, looked around for someone to find out if there's a waiting list or do we seat ourselves. After a few minutes a waiter came by, told us it would be a 15 minutes wait. As we were waiting I looked around to see there are food on the ground. I gave them the benefit of maybe the previous customers had kids and they threw it on the ground.  We were seated probably 5-10 minutes later. 

Our server's name was Ramon. He came over with a smile, took our order, and went and got us water. My son decided on the AYCE. I was hesitant so decided I was only going to order the tempura Udon with vegetables- it came with two soggy shrimp tempuras, a few slices of mushrooms and a little spinach.  We also ordered salmon nigiri, Drum Roll, miso soup, Sin City Roll, Dragon Roll, and Tiger Roll. The fish were sliced paper thin. The rolls were soaked in sauce. When you bite into the sushi you can only taste the rice and sauce, where's the fish? The only good thing about this restaurant is Ramon, our waiter. We definitely will not return."}
{"text":"The place is 15-20min away from the main strip.  A traditional sushi restaurant that also has a $26 all-you-can-eat menu.  Overall food is very good, really enjoyed it.  Many dish were heavy on the sesame oil, but I love sesame oil so that was fine.

The GOOD: (what I liked)
Oyster shooters - puny but sweet/succulent/excellent.
Soft Shell Crab - batter fried cruncy delicious.
Sweet shrimp - sashimi tail & fried shrimp head good.
Scallop hand roll - scallops, mayo, topped /w masago yum
Spicy Tuna roll - it's very good luv it.
Baked mussel - juicy, excellent.
Masago & Ikura - small eggs/ large eggs.
Shrimp/Veggie Tempura - (the usual)
Edmame -  (the usual)
Dessert - green tea ice-cream /w mango/strawberry mochi. Yummy!!

The BAD:
-fish were sliced paper thin, and too much rice on the nigiri sushi.  Seriously this is just a waste since most people are not going to eat the extra rice anyways.  The thinness of the cut also impacts negatively on the overall taste/mouth feel of the nigri.

The UGLY:
-took foreeever to get our food.  Apparently they had too many customers that day and they were short staffed.  I hope this is a one time fluke as the server apologized repeatedly. 
-many items were out of stock.  Seriously we showed up around 6:30pm yet they were already out of the good stuff like uni, giant scallops, clams, torro.. WTF

NOTE:
-everyone gets only one order of sweet shrimp & uni
-each order of sushi comes in 2 pieces.  marking 6 orders = yup u guessed it, 12 pieces."}
{"text":"Poncho is on point tonight with the sushi! Can't beat the food. Service is the usual. Not too busy, good night to be here. Try the ugly roll and the seared albacore hand roll two best things on the menu."}
{"text":"We visited Sin City Sushi on a Saturday night after leaving our usual sushi place because it had closed down. We were in the area and decided to try this place based on Yelp's suggestions. It's not much to look at, but we were greeted immediately and told to find our own seats. We had a lot of questions and our waiter was very patient and answered everything. We ordered a ton of food between the 4 of us and it didn't take long before they were bringing out appetizers, rolls, drinks left and right. It was great because we didn't have to keep calling him over. They kept clearing our plates and filling our drinks. Everything was delicious and priced fair. I was actually impressed because it was a Saturday night, but we had a great experience. I loved the Jackie roll and the Stacie roll. Will visit again."}
{"text":"its supposed to be all u can eat sushi buffet but they limit you in what you can order!! EPIC FAIL.. you just lost my business, going to eat next door from now on..and poor customer service with the waitress constantly on her phone checking her mail etc.. not professional."}
{"text":"Just moved over here on windmill and 215, decided to try sin city sushi with my boyfriend!! SOOOO bomb, every roll we got was better than the last. The Mario special was my favorite!! the sin city roll and gf roll were awesome as well. So good so fresh, cute clean little place! So glad we tried this place out!"}
{"text":"So this is my first yelp review. This is the worst service I've vet had at any restaurant. First, we walked in and had to set up out own table. They didn't even set up our plates, they just threw a stack on our table and we set it up. We had to walk to the front and grab menus for ourselves and when we were done we had to pass it to the tables around us because they didn't even get a menu yet. Our family ended up leaving an hour after we got seated because we were barely just getting our appetizers. They had one person bussing and serving the whole time. Everyone was getting their food before us after arriving after us. They even had the nerve to charge us for food that we didn't even get or order. I'm obviously not one to complain, but seriously..the worst service...and before I arrived here I expected 4 stars and didn't believe the picture of the poop still in the shrimp, but this place doesn't even deserve one star and there was poop in the shrimp!

ALSO! Midway through bussing the sushi bar, she stared serving the food. Didn't even wash her hands! Filthy vermin!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for some lunch hoping they do takeout. They have a separate take out menu because they do have all you can eat. The prices for lunch and dinner ayce is only a few dollars difference. 

When i walked in. I was greeted like most sushi places and i had a lovely conversation with the host who was telling me most of the customers are regulars. I feel like soon enough i will be too because i live across the street. 
I picked up a rainbow roll and a california roll for my lunch and it was good. I appreciated that they offered me water while i waited for my sushi to be made and the chefs were friendly as well. 

I wouldve posted a picture but i ate it too fast. The sushi was good quality and the rolls were tight and not falling apart. Im definitely going to be back. Hopefully ill be known as a regular soon enough, a lot of my friends have heard of this name before and i can see why."}
{"text":"My favorite sushi spot on this side of town. They have a large appetizer selection that comes with the AYCE sushi. The owner and staff are really nice people!"}
{"text":"As a sushi enthusiast, I've been to MANY MANY places in Vegas/Henderson. This place is by far the best! As friend and I went after work around 9PM, and ended up spending a few hours there. Everyone was so friendly, and being that it was a bit later, the only people in the restaurant were the regulars. It was a very family like atmosphere. All the sushi chefs were very nice, both the manager and the owner were there and they took great care of everyone. 

As I read in other reviews, people were complaining about the fish to rice ratio, to me it was perfect! I had a lot of fish for all of my sushi and just the perfect amount of rice. Everything tasted fresh too! I will be back, possibly on a weekly basis. 

You are missing out by not going here! Best sushi place in town, hands down!"}
{"text":"This place gave me food poisoning and the service was horrible! A friend brought here for lunch and I got a tuna hand roll and one tempura roll and I got sick from it! The worst sushi I've ever had. Store bought sushi is better than this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, fish is so fresh, staff polite and friendly. The best green muscles,  will make your mouth water. Definitely worth the trip. Very reasonable in price."}
{"text":"Consistently least fishy tasting sushi, my favorite. And for those naysayers? Sorry you don't know how top make friends and have fun in a sushi bar. For the privileged theres no netter experience."}
{"text":"Great place for all you can eat sushi.  We went in the afternoon very good service and the sushi was much better than some of the higher priced places I have been. Definately worth a try!"}
{"text":"This was not only amazing sushi but ,we sat at the bar, the sushi chefs are great conversationalist. Very friendly staff.  Quick service.  Great suggestions on rolls too by favorite ingredients.  Will eat here again every time we drive through."}
{"text":"First time here with my family. Good quality sushi. It was kinda slow and we didn't get all our orders. But we a party of 11 hungry people from hawaii and we eat alot.  Alittle unorganized front of house but the staff was friendly and the food was good. Oyster in the shooters was fresh. Dessert menu was lacking in selection."}
{"text":"I almost hate to rate 5 stars just because I want to keep the location a secret so it doesn't get as crowded, long waits like the last location.

Service and food are the best. Love this place and the people in it!

The two must haves would be the green muscles and Joe's special roll."}
{"text":"first of all i dont understand people when they only give couple stars when service is bad and the food is bomb!!!????
like clearly the lady that works here cant speak english very well...and shes not rude thats just the way she is....u clearly go to a restaurant for the food not the customer service. your not a fing queen or a king! get it through your thick skull. wake the F up!
for me the food is ridiculously bomb here and if i dont give a shit about the service cuz the food is so damn good!!!"}
{"text":"Been back a couple times recently and had some much better experiences with Sin City Sushi.  Once was an AYCE and the extra appetizers and rolls I tried were all very good.  The waitress was quick to recommend some additional items and service has been speedy each time.

I'm a fan of this place and given the size of the joint, I can see how they can get overwhelmed some nights with large groups of AYCE'ers coming in."}
{"text":"Worst sushi place I've gone to, by far. I was nervous about being sick after eating.
Staff was slow, and forgot items.
Most of the food was basically spoiling and/or fishy.
It was a struggle to eat most of the meal, with a few exceptional bites. Never coming back here.
Avoid at all costs."}
{"text":"Food service was great. Staff was attentive and quick. The sushi itself was so-so. Dry was overly dry. It seemed more like plain rice than sushi rice. The sauces were off. Sweet sauces were too sweet. The garlic sauce was too vinegary and sour. Dynamite roll was just a California roll with baked scallops on top, instead of baking the entire roll. Uni, which is my friend's favorite and subpar, \"Like they left it out to be jerky\". Presentation was plain, not bad, but not impressive. I'd rather go to Sushi Mon down the street. 
ps. I my opinion most sushi reviews for Vegas are abit inflated."}
{"text":"Jesse is sushi chef to the stars. We just sat beside Justin Beaber at Sin City Sushi. It was the highlight of kimba and pats sushi career. Yessssss. As always the sushi was awesome. Vampire, stacey, japanese lasagna, the muscles all rocked harder than mr beaber evet will. We love sin city sushi."}
{"text":"The sushi was great but the service was not so great.  We've been to this location a few times and frequented the previous location many times and have always had great food and much better service. 
Oh boy, where do I start with the service.  To begin with we had to ask at least 3 times to get wasabi and ginger which should be one of the first things that is brought to the table once an order is made.  Next many things that we ordered never made it to the table during the meal:  we ordered oyster shooters, poke and salmon skins that just never arrived.  When our food did arrive we had no idea what was what aa the server literally dropped it and left.  We got something we didn't even order as one roll was fried and had some sort of cream cheese mix inside something we are not a fan of.  Water refills were non-existent as was clearing our empty dirty plates.  The waitress literally served our dessert and ignored the pile of plates we stacked ourselves in the hopes that she'd remove them.  She seemed very scattered and dropped our desserts and ran away.  Finally a male waiter saw our pile of dirty plates and did remove them as we were a few bites into dessert. To say we were disappointed with service is an understatement.  We did leave a 20% tip as we know the sushi chefs get part of it and as the food was delicious I felt it unfair to them to leave any less.  We only live a mile away and this could be our favorite sushi place but due to the piss poor service we received tonight we have no desire to return any time soon.  (The food is the only reason there are 3 stars - otherwise it would be 1)"}
{"text":"I've been eating sushi for 26 years and the last 18 of those here in Vegas. I've been to sushi bars, sushi restaurants, restaurants that 'serve sushi', and of course many 'all-you-can-eats'. That being said, the chefs are nice, the fish quality is average, and the service is so bad that I can't understand how they keep the doors open. 

You'll find a lot of reviews where customers get so excited about all-you-can-eat that they'll eat a sh*# sandwich and smile about it. I won't. As with most other AYCE joints, you're servings will contain a lot of rice and little fish. This practice is normal as rice is cheap and they want to fill you up. If you love rice, this is your place. I don't want to eat two servings to get one serving of fish. You also won't find many of the more exotic items on their menu. Uni isn't exotic and it's also not on the lunch AYCE menu. Figures.

Service is horrible here. Many new sushi hobbyists won't mind the rude and callous behavior of a waitress if they think that reason is 'the way it is' or language barrier. In Sin City's case it's neither. I was told about the waitress and was warned of her behavior. My friends were right, and she lived up to her reputation. At one time our party of four sat with empty drinks (soda and water), and a stack of dirty plates so large we could barely eat around them. To top off our experience, she spilled a scalding bowl of soup on two of the guests in our party. The waitress had no response. No napkins, no rag, no clean up, no apologies, and still continued her callous, rude, and insensitive behavior. Can I at least get a refill?

Like Janice, Erin, and Nestor said, stick to your guns and go get better service and sushi elsewhere. The chefs are really nice and I feel bad for them. The food is average, but the chefs do what they can, with what they have. The service is what kills it for me and we won't ever return. See all the good reviews for this place? Those were written by noobs.

There's a reason why Osaka is 'Best of Vegas' many years running. Head down Eastern and give them a try. I've been going there every other week for over a decade."}
{"text":"This isn't just my favorite sushi place. This is my absolutely favorite place to eat in the world. I honestly can't believe this place has bad reviews. My favorite food is sushi and this is by far the best sushi place I've ever been to. 
I used to go to their old location as well. I've been here over 100 times and I just can't get enough. I've even dreamt about this place XD
I can honestly make a huge list of things to try but I'll try to post a few favorites. 
For starters you have to have the 
baby tako (this stuff is crazy addicting. I've never had octopus that was this good) 
Baked mussels (these might actually be my favorite food in the world. They are crazy good. I've never had baked muscles that compare to these)
Screaming o (the fish melts in your mouth and the sauce is to die for) 
Jalapeño poppers (so good and creamyCan get spicy)
Unagi (my favorite nigiri. They are honestly all good but unagi is definitely the best) 
Ugly roll (my personal favorite)
The scallop roll is also super addicting and delicious 
Vampire roll
Lew roll
Japanese lasagna 
I have mini review of all the rolls I get in my pictures If that's helpful. 
Some of the reviews complain about the older woman server who is the owners wife. They say she's slow or doesn't pay attention. I've known her for years and she is incredibly sweet. Maybe it's because she know who I am but I've always has incredible service with her."}
{"text":"This place is SO good! I just went today for the all you can eat and i ate so much and i couldn't top eating. I was amazed on how much i ate, it was just so good! I was in love with the oysters they were so good and i dont even like oysters! The baby tako was great and just like oysters i have never really liked it but this was delicious! The soft shell crab was super yummy and so was the miso soup. we also had the stacie roll (which was super yummy!) and the wet dream (it was ok but i thought the stacie roll was a million times better. The desert was just as awesome.
My friend had teh mango mochi ice cream and let me try it and yum yum that was good! But i got the banana with ice cream and wow that wa ooo delicious i wanted to buy more. (since you can only get one desert per person) i cant wait to go again! It IS pretty expensive so i have to save up to go again but its worth it! Defiantly the best sushi place i have ever been to."}
{"text":"Awesome sushi place! The sushi chefs are super nice and service is quick. Fresh ingredients and great specialty rolls. Couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"Was super excited to try this place out since I live across the street and seemed to be doing well since its recent opening...it was ok. Nothing special no one greeted us upon entering establishment for or made eye contact even when they passed by us about  4-5 times for at least 15 min. The sushi took quite a while my husband and I did all you can eat had sake nigiri hamachi nigiri a few of their specialty rolls none memorable as well as ebi hand roll tuna poke salmon Kama and unagi nigiri which appearently were forgotten and never made. When we finally got a waitresses attention (which btw she never returned our order sheet even though we did ayce) the sushi chefs were confused as to which one had the our order last. Needless to say my 1 year old had enough of the waiting before we even received our initial complete order after being seated there for about an hour at that point and had to walk out leaving the hubby to finish on his own poor service! Do give credit for the nice hamachi and poke were nice but they need to get a system as they don't have one! The ambience or lack there of needs work maybe music wall art waitresses with personality..."}
{"text":"Place is ok. AYCE is a decent price. The rolls they give you though are really long. 8 pieces, I was expecting 6 pieces which disappointed me as this meant I couldn't try as much sushi as I wanted.

I'm honestly not sure if it's worth getting into what I ordered. Overall it was all just ok, and I honestly wouldn't return unless someone else I knew wanted to come back here."}
{"text":"I've been coming to these same owners for 13 years and the food is excellent! I never ate sushi before 2003 and the owner Young and his wife Moon were very helpful and said they would find something for me that I would like. I never forgot that day and I'm pretty sure I've eaten at least 100 Stacie rolls since 2003. This is THE place to bring friends or family for exceptional sushi. :)"}
{"text":"This place is okay, the sushi is not the greatest, alot of it was really bland. Nothing stood out like wow. They need more variety when it comes to the appetizers I usually go to Yama sushi and they have spare ribs which I absolutely love! The service was okay too our waitress didn't speak English so some of our orders were wrong but the chef are friendly. All and all I don't think I will come back since I can play the same price and have more variety and taste"}
{"text":"This is one of the best places hidden in Henderson. Its right next to Rubios and you would never know it. Right off eastern and the freeway. Excellent service and sushi."}
{"text":"The service is awful. They are irritated when you want to do the all you can eat sushi and will avoid your table so you don't order as much. After ordering your 3rd roll, they try to push the check on you so you can leave. We had a large party so we ordered quite a lot. Around the 6th roll, they would combine rolls. So if we ordered a philly crunch, California, and spicy tuna, they would take pieces of each to make one normal size roll. No where on their menu does it say they will do this. From our first time there to our second-in a matter of 1 week- they had shrunk down all their portions for appetizers, side dishes, and desserts. They also had some of their staff deliver us food while they were on their lunch break. One guy was in the middle of eating his own food while serving us our food. That's not hygienic at all. If you don't want people ordering a lot of food, don't make it all you can eat. But don't ignore people for 30 minutes because you are mad that they are eating so much."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh amazing sushi and Amazing sushi Chef! First of all these people showed so much gratitude that my buddy and I were even there; and just so you know the restaurant was packed. We were seated and immediately taken care of. I want to make a shout out to Leo the chef who not only quick to make the rolls but an awesome conversationalist. You just can't beat $26 bucks for all you can eat, high quality sushi. Great work guys you deserve the 5 stars"}
{"text":"A friend told me about Sin City Sushi after they opened this location. This past Friday we decided to go for All-You-Can-Eat lunch. I had been craving sushi for a while so I was ready and was not disappointed. 

Located in the shopping center (Eastern/Serene)  the exterior is nothing fancy but upon entering the interior was simple, clean and with other Asian restaurants, specifically Japanese/Sushi, you are greeted right away. The staff were all great and made us feel very welcome. 

We ended up going after 12PM which turned out to be great timing. It wasn't that busy so we easily got seated up at the sushi bar. The main chef was very nice and quick with preparing various rolls. 
One of my favorite rolls that I find just about everywhere is the Dragon Roll. It was as delicious as ever. Upon recommendation from the chef I had their Stacie Roll and loved it. My friend had their Moon Roll and Vampire Roll so I sampled both and added to my list for next time. After doing some of the larger rolls I need to get my nigiri fix with some Salmon, Hamachi and upon the chef's recommendation tried their Albacore which was prepared spicy. Loved it all and although I was stuff I couldn't leave without some strawberry mochi. 

This will be one I definitely visit again, hopefully sooner than later. Next time I plan on doing All-You-Can-Eat dinner with some tasty beer to wash down some rolls."}
{"text":"Interesting spot, great sushi rolls, great service friendly staff. Would recommend all the rolls that I tried don't think they could make a bad roll! Highly recommend this place will be coming back again in the future."}
{"text":"Food is really good, if you don't mind waiting over an hour to get your food. They put in your orders, and you still don't get half the food you wrote down. Service here sucked and super slow, when it's not even busy. This is our second time here, thought we give them another chance, but still the same. Other customers around us had the same complaints.....We're done here!"}
{"text":"We order take out sushi here all the time. Pretty standard, the moon roll, drum roll, wet dream, and small sashimi. Quality sushi and great service every time!"}
{"text":"By far the best sushi I've ever had. Yes if you sit at the table the service is not the best. But if you sit at the bar and end up with Leo or poncho  great guys amazing sushi chef's . First time I went  I sat at a table and dealt with a grouchy old lady from this place and holy shit she can't get a drink order right and she throws the plates on the table. She is known for being a grouchy old lady which I think makes the experience even better. But once I've been there twice and sat at the bar Leo knew who I was he knew my name exactly what I wanted the minute I walked in this guy is top notch and a all around great guy .He makes the experience amazing. I honestly believe I could never get a better experience at a high end casino compared to the amount of detail and service provided by Leo as well as the quality of sushi. This will be my go to place when I visit Vegas I had friends who were visiting from out of town  and they were blown away by Leo and the sushi. For those who complain about this place have no idea what real sushi is stick to your grocery store made California rolls .Sin City Sushi is the spot for one of the kind sushi and one of a kind sushi chef's named  Leo and poncho. I can't say enough good things about this place or it's chef's. By the way order the jalapeno poppers and then the blackjack with the same sauce that goes on the poppers and yes you can name your first born after me for that amazing tip. If there was more than five stars I would give it to this place.F-in epic/Mind blowing."}
{"text":"I'm devastated!   I tried to visit SinCity Sushi only to find them closed!  If they have moved, please post their new location.  :("}
{"text":"Came here for the all you can eat and had to wait forever for our orders. We ended up being here for way too long and not wanting to be here anymore because of the ridiculous long wait. The sushi chefs decided that the to-go orders are more important that the dinning room. Everyone was complaining about the wait and people where not even getting the correct orders. Sorry to say I will never come back after this experience."}
{"text":"Amazing!  I tried this place for the first time about a month ago and I've been back every week since.  It has replaced 'I Love Sushi' as my favorite sushi spot.  Jesse is one of the sushi chefs and he makes the best I've ever had.  My personal favorite is the Vampire roll.  Definitely make the trip to this one."}
{"text":"Best AYCE sushi in Vegas. Freshest fish, great rolls and nigiri. The chefs are top notch. The garlic tuna nigiri is to die for."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on yelp, my wife and I decided to try this place out.  By the way, we are avid sushi diners.  In a month, it would not surprise me if we go to 4-5 sushi dining experience.  Yes, they are AYCE too.  Fortunately, I run alot.  Otherwise, I would be a big hippo.

Anyways, here is the deal with this place.  The sushi selection was not that great.  My wife and I love sushi with cooked eel.  They had like 2-3 selections only.  This was a bit of a disappointment.  In addition, per the sushi chef, they only serve \"half\" orders when you \"make\" your final orders.  This kinda sucks.  By ordering \"half-orders\", we could experience a greater selection.

We ordered the catepillar rolls, dynamite, unagi, edaname, cucumber salad, miso soup, seaweed salad, and other rolls.

The seaweed salad and cucumber salad was served in a micro-size bowl.  It was like a \"doll\" size serving.  We had to make a couple orders.  Seaweed was a bit salty; however, cucumber salad was very good.

Sushi was average.  It was nothing that you could say WOW about.  you know???  Towards the end of our meal, our sushi chef made a recommendation to try the mussels and oysters.  Unfortunately, because we had the \"full\" order sushi, we were stuffed.  Granted, we still took his advice and tried the mussels.  Surprisingly, it turned out to be their best dish.  I wish they mentioned this to us before we started to order.  Wished I had room to try the oysters.  Maybe, next time.

Overall, with the exception of the mussels, the food was a \"2\".   Mussels was a 5.

Now, for service... The reason why this is a 3 or 3.5 is due to service.  The wait staff are very friendly, professional, and really took care of us.  They made the restaurant feel \"welcoming\".  It was a bit \"homey\".  Everything was clean and down to earth.  We kinda like that.

Funny thing, my wife and I agree that we would be back because of the service, not the food.  Total price came to about 70bucks with tip.

In our opinion, our two favorite sushi spots are still Sushi Mon (quick, good sushi, great selection) and Extreme-Sushi (slow service - depending on the chef - takes forever for sushi orders to be made, but has the best sushi in town -- also great selection)."}
{"text":"Alright where do I even start with this place?! This place is a complete disaster and joke. Save yourself some time and money and go somewhere else. Not only is the customer service a freaking sh*t show, but the food is just as bad. Honestly, it's pretty hard to ruin sushi, but this place managed to do so.

I came here for my friend's birthday celebration as a recommendation of another one of our friends. It took them 10 mins to sit our group of 6 down. Just stood at the door while they didn't even bother acknowledging the group. We had a reservation so I didn't think that would even be an issue. Finally the group got seated after too long. 

Then when we ordered, the rolls literally took an average of about 20 mins each to come out. We ate as they came out to the point where we were just hangry and bored of being there. The servers looked cranky like they didn't want to be there as well. Literally only got one drink refill each and the sushi did not make up for all this nonsense. 

My friend is vegetarian and this place doesn't offer than many veggie choices. Poor guy was probably still hungry after we left there. For $27 you can definitely find yourself eating better sushi somewhere else. Somewhere where you wont feel extremely bloated afterwards or get FOOD POISONING!!!

Woke up feeling sick as hell today and my tummy is just a mess. Thank you Sin City Sushi. I will never be coming back ever again."}
{"text":"The best Sushi in all of Vegas. I went there the first time last year looking for Jimbo after losing touch with him for a few years. I been eating his sushi for since I was 15 and I'm now 36... so 21 years now! I have had sushi all up and down the west coast in such places as: San Diego, LA, San Fran, Portland, Seattle, ect. and as well as many places in Scottsdale, Phoenix, and Vegas. Nobody does as good as JImbo! Though many of his old menu items are not offered at this place he has brought a few of the items craved by many with him. Even so the rest of the folks there and the menu is still to die for! The service is great and the sushi is the best in all of Vegas no matter who is making it here. It really doesn't mater if it's the the little guy in the Titleist golf cap, or the funny hyper Hawaiian, or the \"old man\" its all great! I have told many of my friends and coworkers that are traveling to Vegas to make sure to try Sin City and make sure to set aside the time to go there while in town. Not one has had any regrets! Many have made sure to tell me it was the best they have ever had. I now live about 2 hours away but try to make it at least 2 times a month to get my fix. Due to health reasons now  I'm on a strict diet and reward myself with a \"bad night\" on sushi 2-3 times a month. If it wasn't for Sin City Sushi I wouldn't have a cheat night at all! If I lived closer and wasn't ill I would be there twice a week just like the old days with Jimbo at Manda. 

If your traveling to Vegas make sure you eat here... It's only 10 mins from most of the strip and a cheap and easy cab ride over if you didn't drive. The place is simple to find and located just feet off of the freeway exit. If you have a guest in your party or a picky spouse this place is a great choice as well. They offer more than \"raw fish\". Decent menu of beef, chicken, cooked fish, noodles, and some of the best tempura I have ever had. They also have plenty of room for a larger party and also offer a big screen TV to watch the game on if that's what your into. They offer a small beer selection and a few premium hot & cold sakes as well. There are also plenty of other places to eat in same parking lot if you need to accommodate others in your party that don't want to try anything on the menu.... their loss!

I recommend you try:
Star Roll
Oyster Shooters
Special Scallops- if seated with Jimbo
Baby Tako
Paradise Roll- one of the best things you have ever tasted.
My Girlfriend Roll
Vegas Roll- cut or hand roll both as good as other.
Blackjack Roll- Salmon and cream cheese stuffed Jalapeno deep fried =YUM!
Vampire Roll
Halibut (Hirame) and the Red Snapper (shiromi) is the freshest I have ever had and they almost always have it!
Caterpillar Roll-If you like a Dragon Roll and are a avocado lover this roll is for you! Though very popular at most sushi joints theirs puts the rest to shame!.

If your ever headed there or wanting to try it and looking for some normal friendly down to earth company I'm almost always down. I'm always looking for a sushi partner... Just give me a day or so heads-up."}
{"text":"Best sushi spot in Vegas , Stacie roll, Ugly roll, screaming O! Must have . All you can eat"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch with a friend. Great sushi. Was hard just to decide on a couple of items as I wasn't doing AYCE for lunch. Finally decided on the Lion Roll & the ever great Rainbow Roll. Will have to go back to do an AYCE soon as I was craving their poke, baked green mussels, oyster shooters, soft shell crab & so much more. Service did lack a but but this isn't the 1st time that I have been there & the other times the service well made up for what it was on this visit."}
{"text":"Great sushi joint!  Girlfriend roll is spicy goodness. Be sure to check out the board with new items - soft shell crab is fresh and perfectly fried with a unique citrusy sauce.  Hamachi is always my favorite, and Sin City's is like butter!  Their Baby Tako is the best we've had anywhere.  I highly suggest their All You Can Eat - dinner is $25.99 and you can order rolls, nigiri, tempura, salads, etc...  Great deal if you're looking to eat lots of great sushi!  Want just a few items?  Go a la carte!  You can't go wrong at this place.  Fork up!"}
{"text":"I eat sushi almost once ever two weeks.  This place was HORRIBLE.   They have a very limited menu for sushi.   They don't even have snapper not sure how or why.  This time going i was with a large party over 8.  I want clarify how dead the restraunt was (only one other table of 4).  They gave us one piece of paper to order (the waitress said it was easier)  once our food finally started coming we got wrong items.   I asked out waitress what it was and there was a language barrier.  She got the paper form the chiefs and brought it to me.   I asked where the pieces of fried chicken were orders.   She handed it to me and said you find it and walked aways.  Once she came back I asked her to find it because we didn't order it.   She left again and came back and said wrong table.    Also the albacore tuna came out HOT.   Either the fish wasn't warm or the ricw was on fire.  Once the check \"came\"  she walked around the table and told us a number.  One by one we had to walk and go pay with the number she told us minutes ago    unorganized and horrible derive.   O yeah did I mention our table was full of dirty dishes the entire dinner...  I would never go back to this place again"}
{"text":"I tried the Spider and Bomb rolls as take out. They took awhile to make but it was worth it. They were so delicious."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly surprised at the quality of sushi here. My sister and I were in the area and on a whim decided to take a gamble and try Sin City sushi. We were greeted by a friendly hostess who was also our server. She quickly seated us and took our drink order. The inside was spacious and clean. We opted for the a la carte menu (lately I have been steering away from the AYCE, even at places that do offer it). We had an order of baked green mussels which were spectacular and rank among my favorite out of all of the other sushi joints. We also shared two rolls which were both delicious and packed with fresh fish, minimal rice and were rolled tight. I believe they were the Vampire roll and Something Wrong roll. Our lunch was very reasonably priced for the quality of the fish and rolls themselves. The server was friendly and we chatted for a but as it was not terribly busy. I would recommend this as one of the sushi spots if you are on the south side of town."}
{"text":"This was the 2nd time I've been to Sin City Sushi. I'm definitely a fan of the food. Just not the service. It definitely would've gotten 4-5 stars if the service was even a tinsy bit better.

We ordered ala carte. I'm not sure how our experience would've been if we did do AYCE, since it does require more waiter service. 

All the food was good, and definitely reasonably priced. Rolls we had were the Ugly Roll, the Stacie Roll, and the Something Wrong Roll. My favorite was the Ugly, and we almost didn't order it! Even my son's teriyaki chicken plate was generously portioned for a lunch serving. We accompanied it with some edamame and baby tako. Everything tasted fresh :)

The 1st time I was here, I ordered take-out, which took a while to get. This time, it took a while to get our Ugly Roll and we had to ask for our check twice. It even took a while to get to the table after asking for it again. The restaurant wasn't very busy, either, and the servers didn't appear overwhelmed. Hmmm..

We might make a return visit, but we'll probably try some other sushi spots before coming back."}
{"text":"I've been to three different sushi bars since I moved to Vegas a month ago and this is easily the worst. The California roll was barely passable for more than something out of a vending machine. The other rolls were very bland. I don't feel I should HAVE to add soy and wasabi to get flavor from a roll. There are much better choices than this in the same surrounding area. Maybe I just went on an off-day, but with the variety, I won't be back."}
{"text":"OK so I lived in SE Asia for about 13 years. Believe me when I say that I've had some awesome sushi in Manila, Singapore, Thailand and Japan. Perhaps one of my favorite places was Buddha Bar in Manila. Me and the wife would go there at least once a month, typically every two weeks. 

This place blows them out of the water. Hands down the best sushi that i have EVER had. I've taken a number of people here since discovering it and they all say the exact same thing. The menu is VERY unique and extensive. The pricing is reasonable.

Try the \"Wet Dream\" roll (yeah yeah, I know)...it's by far their best in my opinion."}
{"text":"Very average at best, 
dynamite roll was falling apart
Service so so, not a serious establishment - someone owns it for fun...And is not serious about their food...
Stay away, I am not coming back...
I bet other reviews are fake..."}
{"text":"Decided to stop here for a quick eat. Sat ourselves and was greeted by those behind the bar. Our server/host didn't really explain anything to us but was pretty friendly. We decided to order from the lunch menu and share. We ordered the Wet Dream,Dragon roll,and Tiger roll. Overall not bad. Some things such as the wet dream were a real hit. You could tell it was fresh. Others like the chicken katsu were just ok. If you had imitation crab then you could definitely tell. Each special was 12.95 which isn't bad for sushi. We got each item as it was made. 

3 stars and a good quick place to eat."}
{"text":"I am done with this place.  I, as well as several of the other reviewers frequented this place often.  My girlfriend and I have introduced over 10 people to this place and dined with them probably 4-5 times a month in the past.  It was our absolute favorite, not only was the food great, but the service was unbeatable.  The manager and waitresses knew us by name as well as the chefs behind the bar knew who we were.  Once the manager left and this new older Asian lady took over for him this place has gone to absolute hell!  We have on 3 separate occasions taken friends to dine here after ranting and raving so much about it and it was absolutely terrible.  We  placed our order then after the other couple we were with received their food we proceeded to wait an additional 40 minutes for the lady to come and ask us \"if we needed anything else?\"  WE HAD NOT RECEIVED OUR FOOD YET!  No apology was given or even any acknowledgement that they had made an error she just simply looked around and walked away.  Please note this similar experience happened on 2 separate occasions.  We have began looking around for new Sushi places, yet kept coming back to give it another shot in hopes that it would be better.  Well, I am sad to say that we gave it the final go tonight and once again we left irritated and disappointed.  Our order was taken and again half of it was forgotten.  When we asked about it only part of what we originally ordered was brought to us.  Only one time in our hour in the store were we checked on for drinks or any dishes picked up.  We ended up just cancelling the rest of our order and leaving because we were fed up.  I will still admit that I love the food there, which is why we kept going back so many times after being treated so terribly each time, but until this place is under new management I will not step foot in there again."}
{"text":"We ended up here after walking out of another AYCE place up the street (see my other reviews to figure out which one that was). The first thing I thought was \"Oh, this place is sooooo clean!\" Brein (husband) and I scored a table right away and went to town. All of the rolls were fresh and tasty. (two things I look for in AYCE)! 

Among our favorites Rolls: 
Garlic Tuna
Orleans
Poncho
Sin City
Wet Dream

Our server was friendly, the chefs were all happy and the beer was cold. The only thing keeping this place from a 5 star rating is not allowing the customer to order half rolls. We love sushi and we love variety, so ordering half rolls allows us to try so much more. Especially with such a large selection."}
{"text":"Our waiter was not attentive, I had to get her attention to place for more orders. The language barrier is a challenge. Did not get all our order. The food is decent- SUSHI MON was our first choice. This place brought us here through a friend- won't be coming back. I've had much better sushi and better service!"}
{"text":"If this is not seriously the best sushi you have ever had in the entire state of Nevada, then you do not know sushi. The family that runs this place picks only the freshest, most tasteful ingredients and fish. The oyster shooters? Delish. The green baked mussels? My gawd. Do yourself a favour, and just let Moon pick your sushi for you. Now, i see some of the reviews complain about the \"service\". Here is the deal, have the freshest sushi you will ever have with a true sushi master behind the sushi bar and TRY to overlook that fact that not everyone's first language was 'MERIKUN."}
{"text":"I won't be going back. After eating at there different locations after the last 15 years after one place would close , then they would open up somewhere else. 
Well the last 4 times I ate there , within about 20-30 minutes I found myself looking for a restroom as fast as I could and I ended up with diarrhea. 
So sorry I won't put my body through that again. I thought maybe it was all the sauce they put on the rolls but now I'm not sure. 
Plus there menus are a joke now. They have a lot of items that are priced wrong and when you get your bill it's a higher price on the rolls than what it shows on the menus. 
On there all you can eat menu , they have some rolls listed but they won't make them for you. Like a zesty salmon roll. They say they are no longer on that menu even though it still shows it. 
The staff says the guys that made the menus messed up on printing them. So they have menus that are still showing items that you can't order and they refuse to make them. 
So I guess it's time to look for a new sushi restaurant.
Be careful if you try and eat there"}
{"text":"horrible service, boyfriend was yelled at twice because he did not want to eat the rice with the nigiri sushi.  So he only ate the fish and not the rice and the waitress comes running over yelling at him very loud in front of the entire restaurant that he can't do that then did it again. If I order a burger and dont want to eat the bun you cant tell me that I can't do that.  I finally the second time asked her to please stop yelling at us and to get away that if he does not want to eat the rice he does not have to..  If you need to charge us al la carte fine but leave us alone and stop being rude.  She then proceeded to yell in Japanese to the other waitress for 15 minutes.  we had to ask for our check and wait for another 10 minutes while she yelled in Japanese about us.  the sushi was just ok the sushi chefs very nice but the wait staff was absolutely rude and horrible and I will never recommend this to anyone.  She could have simply said if you do not eat the rice we will have to charge you al la carte pricing.  I am not a child and dont appreciate being yelled at while trying to enjoy dinner while everyone stares at us in the restaurant.   Wish Yelp would finally start a zero star rating somehow"}
{"text":"The all you can eat sushi is fantastic. Japanese lasagna is my favorite! The bacon wrapped asparagus was a surprise hit at a sushi place. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"GREAT SUSHI :)

i love that they're open late because i don't get off work until at least 10 or sometimes later so it's nice to know there's somewhere i can go besides a drive thru late at night that's close to home. the staff is friendly and i always get my food in a timely manner! 

Thanks guys! keep up the good work :)"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Sushi in town. I have been going to them for over 16 years. Been a happy customer back from Sapporo days. YES! It is that good."}
{"text":"I thought this was a new spot, but recognized one of the ladies that work there and realized this is the same owners as the one on eastern.  First time at the new location and left with a bitter taste in my mouth.  Service is still poor.  Didn't get all my orders.  Only got to order once for all you can eat, so if you decide to eat here, order all at once.  I just feel bad that these two elderly ladies has to do all the waitressing.  Maybe if they had help it would've made my experience a little better.  One thing is for sure, I won't be stopping by here moving forward."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here about a month ago. I've been eating sushi since I was four and I'm twenty nine now so for twenty five year, so I know good sushi when I come across it. This is one of the best AYCE sushi spots in the Las Vegas Valley. The fish is fresh and the rice is cooked to perfection and the staff is extremely nice and helpful, willing to answer any questions you may have. I defiantly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"Sushi was amazing here. I've been around town tried several sushi places but have never has these kind of flavors before totally mouthwatering.. sushi is so fresh! Glad I found this little Gem!"}
{"text":"Very excited that we found this place again.  Only after being there for a moment and talking to the chefs did we realize this was one of our favorite sushi restaurants that used to be on Eastern and Serene.  The food was just as great as we had remembered."}
{"text":"They have the best sushi in town! Also the chefs are very friendly. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves sushi!"}
{"text":"I miss all of you and wish I could still make your sushi!!! I wish of you the best at Sin City and Haoli Makahiki Hou!!!
Aloha,
Ken"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness the Sushi  here is incredible and I've never had sushi that I didn't like here.  

They have all-you-can-eat Sushi  for lunch until 3pm for $22.95 and after 3pm it's $25.95 for dinner.  

The restaurant is clean, great parking lot in a lovely community and they are always happy to greet you. 

Highly recommended by a total sushi lover 

I added a photo of my husband loving the sushi rolls!"}
{"text":"Not the biggest selection on the AYCE menu, but what IS on there was fabulous! Everything tasted super fresh, the rolls are huge, very flavorful and served in a very timely fashion. The Staci roll is ridiculous good, so good a had two, back to back! Sin City Sushi has earned a new customer in me."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place. Unfortunately they do not clean their shrimp so any roll you order with shrimp in it.. Will come with shrimp poop. 

I'm usually not picky when it comes to my food but this is just unacceptable ."}
{"text":"I love this sushi place! The chefs are very friendly and helpful (they suggest to you what's good and what's popular). The vampire, ugly and stacie are my faves. Their baked green mussels, the screaming 'O' & soft shell crab are also super yummy. I mentioned that their unagi are not so fresh so I just kept in mind that I won't be ordering any rolls with unagi but since everything else, i.e. the fishes, are really good and fresh, I still give them 5 out of 5! :) I think I'm a regular here!"}
{"text":"This was our favorite sushi place.  So excited to hear they opened back up. Went tonight and food was great but the service sucked. We didn't get quite a few of the items we ordered and when asked the waitress she argued with us that we got them.  We were ignored the rest of the night never eating our fill. Sorry to say but they lost my business."}
{"text":"Only tried to place once. Wasn't to bad! Would go back to try again. Forget how much it was to eat all you can eat! But the waiter was cool not charging me for all my leftover! And he pack it all up for me. So I had to drop a phat tip for him cause I took food home that could had feed two people! Which it did!"}
{"text":"ONLY PLACE TO EAT SUSHI!! Wonderful staff and the amazing flavors of different than the rest"}
{"text":"Not the same sin city sushi that it used to be. Maybe we just made the mistake of coming on Valentine's Day but this experience almost makes me want to never come back again. We were there for an hour and 45 minutes while having nothing in front of us for a majority of the time except for dirty plates. Our first part of what we ordered arrived about 5 minutes after we ordered it (screaming-O) and the next course of uni and salmon nigiri followed 5 minutes later. After that we didn't get anything for almost 25 minutes. Every individual item came out about 20 minutes spaced out. We ended up cancelling a lot of what we ordered just cause we didn't want to wait any longer. My husband never complains and even he was getting frustrated. Might have to wait at least 6 months before I think about stepping back in there. They need better service and betters  sushi chefs."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've ever had!!! I came in for the first time with my fiancé yesterday and loved it so much we came in again today. The nigiri is fresh and their rolls are amazing. We usually have the tiger roll every place we go and this place has by far the best one. We also had the \"what the heck\" which has quickly become a new favorite. A few other ones we tried that were good are the bomb roll, the Stacie, and the boyfriend. We will definitely come here whenever we have a sushi craving :)"}
{"text":"Quality of fish: great! Especially the salmon, very fresh and fatty

Fish to rice ratio (nigiri): 1:1.5  - a little too much rice IMO, but it just depends how you prefer your nigiri.

Service was a bit slow, but the restaurant was pretty busy during lunch hour.  I would give this place another shot, probably during slow hours."}
{"text":"Great new/old sushi spot down the street from our house. My husband and I really liked all they had to offer. Service is kinda slow but it should improve. It's a spacious restaurant so it can accommodate large parties easily. The appetizers are good especially jalapeño poppers, calamari and mussels."}
{"text":"Food is very delicious. Yung and the crew are always very friendly and attentive... but make sure you sit at the bar or go during non peak hours. During busier times, food takes a bit longer but it is very tasty. AYCE is good value."}
{"text":"I have been here on many occasions and am always glad I went here and not the many other sushi places you can find.  I love how they listen to what you request and make every order fresh.  I have read some other reviews saying it takes forever but that is not true and I would be willing to wait if it means FRESH.  We have been to other places while Sin City was relocating and were disappointed in everyone of them.  I especially like the way they do the baked mussels and Rainbow cut roll.
We were so glad when they did relocate and open.  Thank you Moon And Yong for a great sushi place!"}
{"text":"GO ELSEWHERE!

Restaurant ambiance is dull.  Large, open space but nothing much to look at.  

Sushi is all frozen, color is bad, uni was black/grey color.  Texture not firm either.  

Half the sake list was out, and there were only a few items on it to begin with!

Got rushed into paying check around 9:40pm when they close at 10pm.  Very uncomfortable when trying to relax and have a meal.  By 9:55pm they are anxious to go, the chairs are put up and I can assure you all of your plates in front of you have been cleared (hint*** LEAVE).

Don't go here when there are so many better choices nearby.

The only saving grace was Leo the sushi chef.  Friendly guy with a great personality.  

D RATING OVERALL"}
{"text":"Decent AYCE sushi. The staff were very friendly, the hamachi and albacore were top notch, and the rolls were plentiful and varied. Minus one point for the slight overuse of Sriaccha. They also had a vinegar based sauce on a few rolls that didn't impress, but beyond that, all was excellent. Good prices, too."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for a couple years and every time is well worth it. The sushi is super fresh and always really yummy. Their albacore is probably the best I have ever had, especially because it is topped with their garlic sauce. The salmon is always spot on too. My favorite cut rolls are the Vampire roll, Kasia roll and Sin City roll among many others. It is important not to forget to order the Green Mussels too. The sushi chefs and waitress are always kind to me and I always feel welcomed. If you are looking for a great sushi spot then this is your place. The all you can eat menu is priced right, consistently great and you will leave feeling like you had a great meal."}
{"text":"If you want amazingly fresh sushi with lots of flavor and variety than Sin City Sushi is the place to go. If you want waitresses who practically throw your food on the table and run off before asking how your meal is going, or waiting thirty minutes between rolls when getting the all you can eat (or really any type of meal), or never being able to catch the attention of the waitress who never comes back after dropping off your food to merely ask for a napkin, then this place is for you as well.

I will say that the only reason I keep going is for the sushi!!! I have found better service everywhere else but the sushi doesn't even compare to Sin City. I put up with the waitress (really one in particular (an older lady) who we manage to get every time we are there.) because the food is so good. The owner is very friendly and the chefs always greet you when you walk through the door or say goodbye when you leave.  

The Lion roll is my favorite and the soft shell crab practically melts in your mouth. So good! My 3 year old gets a free bowl of rice (which is usually all he will eat there) so that's nice. The all you can eat for $25.95 for dinner is worth it if you can get your food in a timely manor (which for this place is rare).

In the end for good sushi go here but make sure you are not on a strict time schedule and don't mind horrible service."}
{"text":"Okay so I kinda see what everyone's complaining about the dining room service...  But I don't think it's as bad as some people are making it out to be. I honestly think there's just maybe a language/ cultural barrier with the two older servers.  They had two younger servers last night that seemed to be a little more on the ball.  Figured if you order all your rolls on the first order it's a little easier. Considering I live across the corner from here I'll definitely be back. Highly recommended the wet dream, dynamite and lasagna rolls."}
{"text":"I have to say that this is the best sushi place I have been to. It's the same company as Kai sushi over on Durango and Flamingo but if you are over near the Henderson area this is the place to go!

Aside from their food the service is absolutely great! It's a small place, so the servers get to every table and make you feel so welcome. The rolls are so amazing, the fish is fresh and every roll doesn't taste the same like every other sushi place. My favorite roll has to be the vampire roll, it has soft shell crab and yum sauce inside and cajun albacore and garlic sauce on top. I also tried their signature stacie roll, sin city roll, crazy chic roll, & the no name hand roll. They were all delicious! The lobster hand roll is my favorite though it is just not in the AYCE menu. Have to try their oyster shooters and baby tako for appetizers! The AYCE dinner is $25.95 lunch is $22.95.

This is my new sushi spot and I have to say it was my best sushi experience!"}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if I could. I've never written a review on yelp before but this place was so terrible I felt I had to write one. I have absolutely no clue how this place has so many good reviews, as eating here was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had in terms of both food quality and service.

My friend and I were seated right away but it took at least 15 minutes for someone to take our drink orders and bring us a menu. We ordered some nigiri, a couple sides, and two rolls - nothing overly complex and not a lot of food. It took about 45 minutes for them to bring us one order of nigiri and more than an hour and a half for us to get everything we'd ordered. 

The fish did not taste fresh at all. I hate wasting food but we couldn't even finish eating some of the items we ordered because they tasted so bad. My friend started complaining of an upset stomach before they'd even finished bringing the food and I was sick as well by the time I got home. 

We politely informed the server that we did not enjoy the sushi and that it did not taste fresh. She insisted that if we didn't like the food it was because we didn't know anything about sushi and didn't know how sushi is supposed to taste. I was struck speechless at this incredibly rude response. 

The server then went on to claim that they had never had a complaint about their food before, that their sushi is the best in town, and that everyone thinks so. I responded that their sushi definitely isn't the best in town and the server abruptly walked away. It then took them another 30 minutes to take payment on our check. This was, without a doubt, the worst customer service experience I have ever had in a restaurant. 

On top of all of that, the restaurant was very dirty; which, in hindsight, probably should have been our first clue as to the quality of this place. The menu they brought us was soggy and gross from (I guess) food and drink being spilled on it. There were also streaks of food/drink/who knows what on the wall next to our table. I was also given a dirty plate to eat off of. 

In sum, everything about this place was terrible. I will never eat here again and would not recommend eating here to anyone."}
{"text":"We made the mistake of going here on a Saturday for a late lunch.  The older lady with the poor English acting as our waitress ruined the experience.  The sushi wasn't great but also wasn't bad (except the oyster shooters...yuck!)  The service however was practically nonexistent.  

Our party of 3 got the AYCE.  After being ignored after several hand waves to come over to our table (that got direct eye contact), I finally had to yell at her to get her to stop & take another order.  We never received several items we ordered & were there for over 2 hours due to the fact that it simply took that long for her to take our orders via checkoff sheet & finally give us our bill.  

Also, the AYCE is not truly AYCE.  Apparently during lunch time, the sweet shrimp is off the menu unless you are willing to pay dinner prices.  We were told this after we had ordered.  You are also limited to ordering other items...baby octopus & soft shell crab come to mind.   I recommend going to Yama if you want high quality AYCE (is there such a thing?...Yes!) where everything on the menu is fair game & the waitstaff are attentive."}
{"text":"Seated quickly. Not many tables. They only had 2 servers and 1 person busser. Orders came out in segments with a lot of down time in between. Over 2 hours here and 6 orders never came. On the bright side... The uni was pretty good. I don't usually write reviews, but management needs to get their business in order."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service. We come here often because it is the most consistently good all you can eat sushi we've found."}
{"text":"Eh... Nothing crazy about this place. They rolls are decent but the service is terrible. When I went it wasn't very busy and they had 4 or 5 sushi chefs and three servers. It took us forever to get our food and they kept forgetting about what we ordered since they never took our all you can eat paper and tried to just \"remember it\". 

It's very spacious unlike other sushi places that try to cram you in there like sardines. It was very clean as well. They only do full rolls but I wish they did halves as well.

Would I go back? If friends wanted to go to that specific place, sure but would I die to go here when I'm craving sushi? Probably not."}
{"text":"Not good food. They put smelt eggs in everything
The waitress is very mean. 
The chef wraps each roll in so much rice it's crazy.  Will not return"}
{"text":"I really hate writing reviews like this but it's my duty to warn you all!!!  Their 4 star rating is false! 

The service here is horrible. We came 1.5 hrs before closing time and there was only 1 person sitting at the sushi bar. So it was not busy at all. 

The elderly lady hostess/server here gave no care in the world to service us. I felt she was very short with her answers when I had questions about the menu and gave such a rude tone in her answers as if I was wrong for asking questions. She had no idea if she had certain items on the menu. To top things off she fell asleep at the register. Our sushi was at the bar waiting to get delivered but she was asleep. My wife had to walk to the bar and pick up our sushi as we got tired waiting for her to wake up.

At the end they delivered our check before we got our desert. While I was still eating my ice cream they asked for us to pay the check. I was surprised as I was trying to enjoy my desert. It kind of made me feel like they were rushing me out the door. I lost my appetite and left right after that.

The food here is good but there are so many other sushi restaurants in the area that nothing really stood out. If I were you go to another establishment as this one will probably disappoint you.

I definitely won't be returning here."}
{"text":"It's the best sushi place around 89123 zipcode. 
Sushi rolls are delicious .
Don't forget to try Stacie and lion roll. Ask the chef about poke, baby Tako . Do finish your meal with oyster shooters.
Totally worth your money. 

I gave them three stars due to below reasons:
One of the serving lady (Owner's Wife) is always grumpy. Seems like she is always mad at the world. Rest of the crew seem to be friendly and down to earth."}

Update on 07-03-2016:
so i went to eat sushi and asked for my fav chef \"Jimbo\" and shocked to hear that , he passed away. I met him 2 months back (At there new location on Maryland and Pebble) and he seemed healthy , cracking jokes all the time i was there.
Evidently some kind of cancer in the stomach took his life away and the fact he did not realize he had it until the last stage. \"i hate cancer\"
That's Jimbo in the Picture."}
{"text":"BEST Sushi place in town....! You can actually taste the freshness of the fish that they use. I believe the chefs name is Son, not positive, but he is very friendly and helped me with a few different items. Vampire roll is INSANE......AYCE price is well worth it. Better than any other sushi place I have tried out here since moving 2 years ago. I have been to about 12 or 13 total, and Sin is the one I keep coming back to...."}
{"text":"Best AYCE Sushi in Las Vegas. And since Vegas has the best sushi in the world, I'm betting it's the best AYCE sushi place anywhere. 

Best green muscles. 
Best creative rolls. 
Excellent appetizers."}
{"text":"Words can't say how much I love this place!  The baked mussels are too die for!  Also my favorite rolls here are the Drum Roll and Stacie Roll. I've never had a combination of sushi like these before. I wish I could give more than 5 stars. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Came back to give this place another chance because i remembered the food was good. Waited at the front for at least 10 minutes with my whole family, and was not even acknowledged ONCE!! The only time the lady acknowledged us was to shoo me and my son away from the register area because a customer was about to pay. Literally, rudely shoo'd us away, with hand gestures and all lol. F*ck this place!!!!! Forever on my shit list now. 
................................
I'll give it up; 3 stars for the food!! It was really good. Almost everything we ordered tasted great and really fresh.

It's a shame that we may never come back because the service was horrible!!!!!!!! Not too many seatings are available at this restaurant, so not very many customers are there at a given time. There were plenty of sushi chefs and a few waiters. Our orders took for-evererrrrr! We didn't even get one order because we were already annoyed by then and canceled it. 

The worse part was when the waiter tried to lie to me haha. I asked for a couple of our orders we've been waiting so long for and he said I didn't order it on my sushi sheet. I didn't argue until I asked him to show me my sushi sheet. He could have said they no longer had it but he gladly obliged and said he'd be right back with it. When he returned with it, i knew right away it wasn't my sushi sheet because the orders were hash marked. He literally instructed me from the beginning not to write in hash marks because two hash marks can be mistaken for 11. I took note of that and wrote in regular numbers with 
my sheet hahahaha. When I told him that he apologized and said it was another table's sushi sheet. 

Don't come here for AYCE if you're hungry lol, OR order everything all at once. Maybe, just maybe, you'll get your order."}
{"text":"Got seated quickly. Service started off badly, they took my drink order but not my moms, had to ask twice. Ordered a fried roll with high hopes but wasn't great and feel apart at first touch. Ordered their special edamame appetizer but was only delivered half way through the meal and didn't taste as advertise. Overall the place seemed very rushed, if they just slow down and pay attention to detail, they may get it right."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmm. Went here today for my birthday and the chef recommended the Stacie roll and mussels. They were amazing. I will be back here real soon. I'm addicted now. And $26 for all you can eat was an awesome price for the high quality sushi."}
{"text":"I was looking for a new sushi place in Henderson and Yelped in my area. Found Sin City Sushi, and when I walked in, I realized that it's owned by Young and Moon, the husband/wife couple who owned Sapporo Sushi off of Stephanie and Sunset years ago. Young's sushi is what made me fall in love with sushi 15 years ago, and he still does not disappoint.

I don't order off the AYCE menu, since I truly believe that if you are going to pay $20-$25 for AYCE, you get what you pay for, and if you're going to complain about an AYCE at a good sushi place (like Sin City), you are probably one of those people who  A) don't eat the rice the way you are supposed to and/or B) you are one of those freaks who end up eating 10 rolls by yourself in one hour (the AYCE rules are made for people like you)... OR C) you are a sushi snob who honestly thinks they are going to get a la carte sushi quality at an AYCE price. NOBODY does that. They'd lose their asses on profits. Business 101, people.

So, for those of you looking for good sushi at an AYCE price or REALLY good sushi off the a la carte menu, then Sin City is for you. 

Their baked mussels are delicious, and most sushi places should take a lesson from Sin City on the baked topping, mussel quality and SPLITTING the mussel so you can enjoy it in two bites.

Great handrolls. My old time favorite is the zesty salmon with mayonnaise, masago and lemon. Give it a whirl, but FYI, it's not on the AYCE menu... with good reason.

Baby tako is tasty and not rubbery the way many sushi joints give it to you. Another tasty bite is the oyster shot, which is tangy with a bit of spice. 

I'd comment on the cut rolls, but honestly, I ask for most rolls in a handroll. Their ingredients are fresh, their sushi chefs are friendly, and their atmosphere is just fine.

Read the AYCE reviews with a touch of caution. Sin City is a good sushi joint. Period. And those of you All You Can Eaters who are bitching about \"quality\" and \"staff rudeness,\" you get what you pay for, baby. Stop walking in like a fake baller and order AYCE and then complain. You probably ate them out of the day's profits, and you know it, so shut up."}
{"text":"Incredible prices for all you can eat. The sushi (fish) was so fresh and delicious. Real, very fresh crab, incredible specialties rolls, and winning service. It might even worth going out the strip especially for lunch."}
{"text":"Desperately trying to compensate for the bad AYCE experience I had the day prior (at a different restaurant) this place definitely made up for it! Their service and food quality undoubtedly deserves a 5 star rating. 

Were immediately seated, and served with our drinks within the first 5 minutes. There was a good amount of people in the restaurant but enough space at the bar/tables so people wouldn't be sitting shoulder to shoulder. Two different chefs introduced themselves and took turns serving us as wells as the rest of the consumers at the bar next to us. I don't think there was a moment where any of us were waiting for our food. We always had something to eat!

Something that really stood out to me about this place is how the chefs/waitresses interact with their consumers. In most cases waiters/waitresses take your order with minimal conversation and they do the same thing over and over to all the rest of the tables. In this case, both the chef/waitresses took their time to ask us what we liked and even gave us recommendations to try some of their specials and off the menu stuff. Connecting with your consumers isn't easy which is why I give them extra kudos for making the effort. Speaking of, it seems like they have a lot of regulars. Every group that left while we were still eating PERSONALLY thanked the chefs (by name) and even asked about the ones that weren't working that day. 

As for the food, the fishes were fresh and melted so good in my mouth. Order the Cajun Albacore Nigiri, for sure! We never got the chance to try this one sauce the waitress recommended, but if you like spicy, ask the chef to make this habanero water dipping sauce thing. I forgot what she said it was called exactly. 

Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. Very good variety , personable staff and they food was delicious on top of that you can get 4 oyster shooters per person !!!!!!"}
{"text":"When it comes to sushi, I love exploring the variety of rolls and taking my tastebuds on incredible journeys. That being said, this place was friendly, clean, decently priced, and tasted fine. 

But there was some pizzazz lacking. The roles were fairly standard with few options of real raw fish (lots of crab and shrimp options). Plus, I was also hard pressed to find many options without mayonnaise based sauces.

However, I tried handrolls for the first time and they were delicious! The Unagi handroll and the No Name Handroll were both superb! 

Given the wide variety of sushi joints in the area, this one was not for me. But I will recommend it to all my friends who love good California rolls and Handrolls. The fish was fresh and the service was fantastic! Plus, a friend of mine swears by their Udon soups!"}
{"text":"This place impressed me! The Green Mussels are must! My favorite roll was the Drum Roll. Also noteworthy were the Crazy Chic and the Jamie Special. A lot reviews weren't too crazy about the service but I thought it was great! And we came during dinner rush on a Friday night! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"OMG it's Mr. Jimbo from the old Sushi House Manda. Special scallops, how I have missed you."}
{"text":"PLEASE do yourself a favor and never come to that terrible place!!! The worst sushi I have ever had in my whole life! The service is nonexistent and we have to put dishes in stack otherwise they won't take it away. They want to save money so the sushi is full of rice and a little fish on it. They should open a rice ball restaurant instead of a sushi restaurant. We ordered shrimp tempura and got a bowl of fried flour and so difficult to find a shrimp."}
{"text":"So happy to have a great sushi place again. This place is bright, clean, friendly staff and the sushi is bomb!"}
{"text":"Absolutely my vote for the #1 sushi restaurant in this town hands down !!!!!

The freshness of the fish the creativity of the rolls the next of traditional Japanese sushi with American fusion. 

The service is awesome"}
{"text":"Best local sushi hands-down! Great new location with lots of parking. New place is roomy with more seating. Great to have them back in business. We tried many substitutions but no one can compete with their quality of fresh fish, and the Taste and flavor of their sushi. There at another level than most local sushi places. Great job"}
{"text":"It's been a couple months since Sin City Sushi opened in the Scottsdale Plaza and I've gone at least once every two weeks since then. I go back so much because this sushi restaurant really is the best. The quality is so fresh, I almost cried in delight after taking my first bite of the Jamie Special roll. 

[Editor/Husband note: She actually texted everyone she knew in the city after trying it with the text 'the Jamie roll at Sin City Sushi is so good I want to cry']

Pros
-------------------------------
- sushi is the freshest I've ever had
- all rolls are flavored to perfection and quality is important. (I recommend the Jamie Special, Crazy Chic, Double Sear, Anna, and literally everything I've tried.)
- the staff is very friendly and personable.  They remembered us even on our second visit.
- the atmosphere is very chill, with no loud music interfering your meal. If you sit near the sushi bar, there's a single TV displaying a sports channel. You can actually have a really relaxing beautiful meal experience
- all the customers I see are regulars from their former location. They did almost nothing to advertise their opening, but they still have a big following. It's not just the Yelp community raving about their sushi!
- The bath rooms are clean. The whole place is clean; everything looks new because everything is!
- As you finish your dishes, a waiter will remove them so your dining space remains uncluttered.

Cons
-----------------------------------
- Tap water sometimes tastes terrible. Get a lemon or enjoy the extra minerals.
- This place is great, so it always has the chance to be busy. When it gets busy, sometimes they are understaffed. I've never had too terribly long of a wait to receive my dishes, but I know service varies depending on the crowd. There's only a few sushi chefs, so your order might be backed up. However, I promise it's worth the wait.

Prices currently are $23 for AYCE lunch and $26 for AYCE dinner. But you can always order à la carte. Since eating here, I've been disappointed with sushi experiences at other restaurants. This place truly sets the bar high. I look forward to the next time I get to eat there."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite sushi place in Vegas!! And if your lucky enough you will be dining with local professional athletes sitting next to you!!"}
{"text":"All You Can Eat! We did just that! The Uni, Baby Taco, Green Mussels, Stacie Roll...all brought back memories of Sapporo!"}
{"text":"Service was horrible my friend and I came for my birthday , we literally had to ask for everything including water. Worst sushi place in Vegas !!!!! Will never come here again.  If this app would let me post with 0 stars I would leave it 0"}
{"text":"Excellent!   Although we were \"out of towners\" (visiting from SF where we have loads of good Sushi joints) we were in the mood for some Japanese food.  Everything on the Strip seemed so overpriced so decided to look elsewhere. This place is a short drive (15 min or so) from the Strip and well worth it.  Service was great as well."}
{"text":"I hold off on 5 stars only because I'm not the best judge of quality (hey, at least I can admit it, right?  I'm not pretending I know what I'm talking about).  If it's tasty, I'll like it. And most sushi places pretty much taste the same to me, although I will admit there are some I like better than others.  

This is one of those places.  The fish is sooo fresh.  I like sitting at the bar, because you can converse with the sushi chefs and they can suggest things for you to order.  This is how I discovered my favorite roll, the Stacie.  The staff is very attentive and friendly.  Kinda pricey, but for the quality, it's reasonable.  

I've only ordered AYCE and I can order probably 3 rolls max. when I start to feel overstuffed.  It comes with appetizers and 1 order of dessert.  The shrimp tempura (1 piece) is made to order so it's super hot when you get it.  The cucumber salad is another favorite of mine.  It's sprinkled with sesame seeds and the dressing is very light.  So, yummy.  Another favorite is the miso soup.  

They have TVs above the sushi bar and the couple times I visited here, they were playing sports programs.  It's an intimate place, consisting of a bar, 3-4 tables, and 3-4 booths along the wall.  The place is lit quite well; it's not dim.  

I love this place a lot and stands as 1 of my top 3 favorite sushi places in town."}
{"text":"Was in this area and saw a sushi place and decided to check it out. There's nothing from this sushi place that stands out from other sushi places. Considering it was lunch time I ordered the teriyaki chicken which came with rice, the teriyaki chicken and a sushi roll of your choice. Service was very slow even though there was only three tables including us. The price is fair for what you get, but nothing really stands out. Service was good, but the food was just okay. The teriyaki chicken lacked flavor as well as the sushi roll."}
{"text":"Hi yelp, this place is good in regards to the food tasting delicious unfortunately, the service is bad. My group of friends and I are here to celebrate my friend's birthday. The staff is slow even though the cooks and chef are making the orders but the waitresses are just plain out ignoring us."}
{"text":"Tried Sin City Sushi for the first time tonight. We ordered the happy roll, zesty salmon roll, salmon and eel nigiri. The eel and salmon were very fresh, and the zesty salmon roll was amazing- I definitely recommend!  We'll have to go back to do AYCE."}
{"text":"We came here for AYCE sushi for lunch and we were impressed. Between my boyfriend and I we ate seven rolls of sushi and
 shared jalapeño poppers. 

Our favorite roll was the Stacie and the Vampire roll, very tasty. Our least favorite roll was the Sin City, it seemed to be lacking flavor. 

What made our meal even better was sitting at the bar and chatting with our sushi chef, Jessie. He was awesome, very attentive and efficient. He even made me a special sauce because I like my sushi extra spicy!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service...check! Best sushi in town...check! Watching table argue with staff about not getting their 30th order of baby octopus...priceless."}
{"text":"You guys have to try out sin city sushi! One of the best dinning experience, i have ever had! Let me start off by saying ive never felt , so comfortable eating at a restaurant.  Staff is so nice and friendly, they make you feel like family! Also i liked that theyre the only place ive been to with no time limit, so i didnt feel rushed, just enjoyed my meal! Freshest all you can eat food ive ever had from there amazing salmon, to the baby tako!
Great for big parties too! I made a yelp account just for i could wright this review!"}
{"text":"I've loved Sin City forever. I was so glad when they opened at this location. Newer, clean, fresh and nice location. 

Is the service a little slow at times? Sure. Is it the end of the world to us? No. The older woman who serves customers at tables cracks me up. My son loves her and she remembers us every time. I love all the guys making the sushi - all of them are friendly and great to talk to. 

I suggest sitting at the bar. When you do, they make lots of suggestions and you try rolls and nigiri that maybe you normally wouldn't try, and every time it is delicious. This is the only place we come for sushi, and we will follow this group anywhere they go!"}
{"text":"Sin City Sushi is, so far, my favorite sushi restaurant, mostly because they understand my allergy and are super friendly. I normally have the same female server each time I go and she remembers exactly how to order our rolls - no eel sauce, no ponzu sauce, no sesame seeds and no soy sauce. Ever. I have yet to leave there getting glutened, but at the same time, I don't eat the wasabi, I bring my own soy sauce, and I don't get Uri or anything that is normally marinated in soy sauce/ponzu, and I don't eat anything that is deep fried either. The prices are also very reasonable for the quality, and they've never timed me for the AYCE which is nice. Nobody breathes down my neck to finish eating! Thank goodness!

The nice thing about their rolls is that they are small and tight. The rice doesn't break apart, it isn't overcooked, it is just right. I love that the rolls aren't all rice, especially if we have every decided to do AYCE. The sake bombs are only $2 all day long, so my husband is a happy man after a couple of those. A large sake is about $6, but it comes with your glass already full of sake and is very good. They do not have a happy hour, but a happy hour isn't needed when the prices are so reasonable and the food so delicious!

Our favorite rolls:  Moon Roll, Scallop Roll, Surf and Turf Roll, Dynamite Roll, Rainbow Roll (substitute shrimp for Krab), Zesty Salmon and many others.

The service is great, the atmostphere is chill, I love this place. Go here and you'll be just fine, especially after a few of those sake bombs! 

P.S. Buy a couple sake bombs for the chefs and/or staff - you'd be amazed at what happens after that :)"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed in this restaurant. I went there today for AYCE lunch. It may be because I am really picky about my sushi, being that I am Japanese. The tempura rolls we ordered was not what I was used to. Sin City fries the whole roll in breading, I like mine with the tempura on the INSIDE of the roll. The raw fish in any of my rolls didn't seem fresh. I noticed a fishy smell when I walked into the restaurant. That may have been a clue.  The service was VERY SLOW.  Maybe it's different during dinner but I will never return."}
{"text":"Appetizers: pretty good. get the fried tofu and baby tako. They have softshell crab. 

Nigiris: REALLY thin fish with LOTS of rice. Fish was okayish fresh. Blahs. Kinda a waste of calories...

Rolls: I like the Kacie one...it's really yummy with garlic ponzu sauce but again the fish on it were all paper thin. Others rolls i tried were all so-so.  

Handrolls: my boyfriend likes the dynamite and scallop handrolls. The scallops are too small though.

I kept going back recently mainly because of the oyster shooters. I usually order a lot of them but today something terrible happened... They told me that I can only order 3 orders (6 oysters per person) max now. 

Really?? Since when?? Should have told me earlier or...better yet, DON'T EVEN BOTHER putting the item on AYCE menu anymore. They complained that people have been coming in and ordering a huge amount of oysters so they run out by the end of the night. So what's the problem? order more.   

The sushi chef always make this SURPRISED face when I order oyster shooters too and the waiter always scream \"OYSTER SHOOTERS!!\" out loud. what the eff? unprofessional...He calls me \"Mrs. Oyster\" really loudly too. Helllllaaaa rude! The waitress was really nice though.   

Conclusion after 3 visits: Sorry sin city sushi. I'm just not happy in this relationship anymore. It's not me, it's you. At least Xtreme Sushi's not stingy with me.  You really have some growing up to do."}
{"text":"A must-go stop every time I'm in Vegas

I'm parchal to the \"Anna\" roll , naturally ;)"}
{"text":"This place is my go to place with my boyfriend! The waiters and chefs are so friendly and treat us with the best customer service. The sushi is always the best! I recommend the double seared, the anna roll, and the crazy chic. It's a tradition we always get a plate of kani rolls too! I definitely recommend this place with a taste for good sushi. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Eat high end sushi without breaking the bank. All you can eat is very popular and I prefer this one as well. They don't skimp on the fish and shellfish. Pricey shellfish such as Uni and Oysters are included in the all you can eat menu for lunch. There may be a limit but I've always asked for 1 order only. They serve all their sushi fresh and always plated  neatly. They've been in business for years, just moved to a new location and it's still a rare gem. 
I stay at the bar and all the chefs are pretty attentive. I noticed that there's not a full crew to wait on tables but I came here for the food. When you do find a waiter/waitress, they do attend to your needs immediately. I have a lot of friends in Vegas, this is where locals go to. It's about 15 minutes  from the strip. Reasonably priced.  Spacious dining area.
Interiors of the restaurant is simple and unpretentious.
The owner who is one of the sushi chefs
behind the bar is truly gracious, accommodating, friendly, and serves his sushi with precision from taste, cut, and plating.
Always a great place for sushi!!!"}
{"text":"I love this sushi place! It's hard to find a good sushi spot near me but this is one of my favorites! My boyfriend and I usually sit at the bar since we like the chefs there. The chefs and the food kept us hooked on this place. Their chefs are very friendly and engaging when appropriate. They don't just stand and work, they actually make you feel comfortable and makes sure we enjoy our food. They have plenty of sushi to choose from and all fresh. Even though this place is not fancy, it is definitely our go-to sushi spot with great service and great food!"}
{"text":"The food was good, but the service was very slow.  The restaurant was just about half full when we came in and became full as the night went on.  I would recommend to order as soon as you can, it took us awhile for the waitresses to take our sushi order after she had taken our drink orders awhile before.  There was only one waitress for the whole restaurant, with 3 sushi chefs, but another waitress was there soon after.  I think this place could do really well if they just had more sushi chefs and servers.  Food was good and the mochi is included in the all you can eat :)"}
{"text":"Have to say, the service was so bad and slow I didn't even leave a tip. Never felt inclined to do that in the history of all my dining until today. Food is good though, but the service is not worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome place to have sushi! I have been going here for almost 18 years. They originally was in green valley by the galleria mall and I have been following them since then. Their sushi is made with love that's for sure. Their Stacie roll and garlic tuna roll is amazing!"}
{"text":"We happened to visiting my boyfriends family while we were in Vegas and they decided to take us to get some sushi.  We arrived here around 7 for the dinner buffet which was only $22 dollars.  There was no wait time for a table and the service was fast and very friendly.  We had a pretty good size group and they were very accommodating.  I LOVE sushi and i am always very skeptical when I go to sushi places, ESPECIALLY for an all you can eat sushi.  I have a very weak stomach, so FRESH is definitely key.  Some buffets that you go to that serve sushi usually have their sushi sitting over ice and sitting there for who knows how long.  Here at Sin City, you order all that you want and they make them fresh as soon as you finish eating some of your other rolls.  Also, I'm not a big octopus fan, but they offered us some octopus dish that was cut up into pieces, it was very good.  They offer an array of custom roll's, but of all, I would have to say that the Tiger roll is my favorite!  The Ahi spicey tuna on top is literally so tender, it's almost like butter, it totally melts in  your mouth.  It doesn't even have that fishy taste and the spice on it, is JUST RIGHT.  I am definitely coming back here when I visit in December.  I totally think  they need to open one up in LA!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi spot in town. Been coming here for 5+ years. The staff is always friendly, the sushi chefs are amazing and always have good suggestions. 
For AYCE, i recommend screaming O, baked mussels, dynamite hand roll, California hand roll, vampire roll, lion roll, and baby tako. But anything you order is going to taste great! The fish is always fresh and tastes fantastic."}
{"text":"I barely ate anything to really judge the food but it was okay. The service (that one specific server really) was disturbing. I was here with my friend and there was only one other table occupied. I shrugged off the fact that we were seated on a dirty table and our servers only half-bussed it while we were seated. I was in a great mood, I was hungry, annnnd I looove sushi.

So, there we were in a near-empty restaurant. Just one other table occupied. There were two servers. Three sushi makers...

We were told we could only order ONE item at a time. This was really dumb for AYCE. 20 minutes later, first roll comes... it was good! I could also hear the 3 sushi makers talking about whatever...I wondered why none of them were doing anything most of the time. Finally! The second roll comes about 15 minutes later only to be devoured in 30 seconds! We were kinda done trying to keep conversations going because we just wanted to EAT!

OMG. Yay! Our server comes by so we can order another roll! This time, our server goes \"Woah! you're STILL EATING? It's been an hour! Jeez!\" (She should work at Dick's Last Resort tbh) Anyhoo, our roll never came and the nicer server came and asked us about 3 times every 5-10 minutes if our food came yet. Nope. Our favorite (blech) server comes back and shrieks that we've been eating too much of their food and that she should cut us off. She did this while we were just sitting there, still not eating. She was probably joking but she came off as really awkward and rude.

WOW. That third roll STILL didn't come. It's nice to know they are so concerned if that third roll ever came or not and after the 5th time we were asked about those \"bites of deliciousness\" (as that weird server kept referring to) and it still never made it to the table. Lol.. it was pretty ridiculous.. I mean, the sushi makers are like 10 feet away..  I got the impression that this place offers \"All you can eat, if you can even get your food.\"

I was tired of waiting for the food and my friend was so annoyed by our server acting like we were eating the entire time. Eventually I felt offended too because she was making us feel bad for eating what we were not eating! She didn't say smack to the people occupying the other table who kept getting roll after roll after roll.. Was it Opposite Day or what? 

Sigh. With a total of two rolls for two people, we left really hungry and ate somewhere else. Way to turn a great mood into a frown :( If this was an off day for them.. Wow. That was off-er than off. Haha. I don't know. OOH. WAIT. OOOH  OH! GET THIS! Ask for the check and suddenly service goes lightning speed and the check comes in 15 seconds! It was amazing!! Yea, you get that check girl. You run and get that check because I'm STARVING for that check. *stomach growls*"}
{"text":"Great food, kind hospitable service- Moon and her husband are the sweetest the other sushi artists are pretty friendly as well, Stacy Roll is so addicting!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic ayce sushi ! Our favorite place , we were regulars at the old location so happy they finally opened this location . Best quality of fish friendly staff !"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE Sushi and I enjoy trying out new and different places. When my partner and I went to SCS on a refferal from a friend we were pleasantly surprised. Well.... sort of.

The restaurant itself could use a fresh coat of paint. It looks like a generic burger cafe with beige walls and no interesting decor, but if they painted the walls Red and added more Asian art, possibly make it a bit more intimate they could probably charge more for the experience.

As it is, the staff was typically friendly. But the food was extraordinary. Every Sushi restaurant I go to I always get their Japanese Lasagna. I have to say that SCS Japanese Lasagna is the BEST in Las Vegas. It is topped with just the right amount of Cream Cheese and Ponzu sauce but they add a delicious smokey flavor to it that makes every bite (down to the last piece) worth the effort. I saved it for the last because I knew if I were full with Sushi (which is typical) I'd still want to finish that.

Well done Sin City Sushi!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Sin City Sushi.  The sushi was fresh, the service was great and the all-you-can-eat made it affordable.  My favorite is the Jamie Roll."}
{"text":"Fresh fish, tasty rolls & super friendly service make for a fantastic sushi night out. The restaurant was busy- always a good sign. My friends and I, a party of five, originally sat at one of the middle tables as all the booths were taken, but our awesome waitress offered to transfer us to a booth when one was available. After fifteen minutes or so, a booth was available, and we made the easy transition w/ the help of the servers. I wasn't that hungry so I opted for the a la carte menu while my friends went for the AYCE, but seeing how much they enjoyed the food, I will come back for the AYCE when I'm in the mood. 

After looking over the many roll choices, I ordered the Sue roll- tuna, avocado, shiitake mushrooms & cucumber. Even though the place was packed, my order came out relatively fast. Simpler than most of the rolls offered, the Sue roll was the perfect choice as I wanted something light. 
Pros: The roll was sweet (from the rice & tuna) which complemented the salty & spicy flavors from the soy sauce & wasabi mixture, and the crunchiness of the cucumber balanced the creaminess of the avocado. 
Cons: I couldn't taste the smoky, earthy flavor of the shiitake mushrooms, and consequently, forgot that they were in the roll. I also didn't like the deep red/purple color of the tuna (seemed too unnatural). 
But, overall, I enjoyed the roll and thought it tasted yummy. 

And even though sharing is not allowed between AYCE eaters and a la carte eaters, I tried a bite of my friend's sweet potato tempura (no complaints), one piece of the Wet Dream roll (In: Shrimp tempura and cucumber; Out: Salmon, Avocado & lots of garlic cream sauce...awesome) and one piece of the Jackie roll (In: Calamari tempura, yum sauce & masago; Out: Avocado & Uni Sauce...really good). She was getting too full, so she asked me to help her out (How can I refuse? Wasting food is not cool. Don't judge!). 

Only one dessert per AYCE order. I think this rule is implemented because of the low profit margins that desserts bring in, but, still, desserts are usually the cheapest items on a menu, so I think this rule needs to be no more. 

Three stars for the food and one star for the service. Definitely not the best sushi I've tasted, but definitely better than some other sushi places I've tried. I need to go here for AYCE next time!"}
{"text":"definitely one of my favorite spots for sushi in town. I'm biased since proximity is important to me and this place is next to my apartment complex, but the quality of the fish is always consistently fresh and delicious. 

I never crave sushi much, but when my friends want a good recommendation or dinner, I always recommend this place! the owner and staff have a family mom and pop style rapport and are honestly very nice and accommodating. 

I usually always do the all you can eat when I come here, but I do recommend their a la carte menu as well because I get it on occasion for lunch to go. 

some of my favorite rolls Include the Stacie, the Sapporo crunch, and wet dream with sauces on the side! 

due to their smaller staff, you have to be a little patient at times, but honestly worth going overall"}
{"text":"The best hole in the wall spot in Vegas. The food is amazing! I suggest u try the \"screaming orgasm\" & the \"stacie roll\" for u beginners who are not into raw sushi just yet. Ask for Young and tell him DJ Franny sent you."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite sushi restaurant in Las Vegas! I've been eating with this great group of people for over 10 years since Sapparo in Henderson. Yung, Moon, Poncho, Jimbo and even Milton (who came out of retirement) are all back in action. 

Everything here is amazing! Screaming O, Green Mussels, Salmon Collar, Vampire Roll, Ugly Roll, Dynamite Handroll, Cajun Albacore Nigiri, Garlic Tuna Nigiri, Tuna Poke, Yellowtail Nigiri & even the House Salas are a few of my favorites. 

Tell them Franny sent you!"}
{"text":"I've been searching for a good sushi place that has some great spicy tuna. Unlike what most people think, not everyone can make good spicy tuna rolls. 

I read the reviews and placed an order for pick up. The downside to such a great place is that they only have pick up but no delivery. I recommend the Misty, Sin City, Spicy Tuna Roll and Baked Mussels. I tried the Poncho but that was a miss. 

Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"customer service sucks! They are very rude. a comment was made because a child was eating all you can eat while an adult was ordering off the regular menu. Just because a child is eating all you can eat it don't mean you are rich. Also when we received our check we gave a credit card to pay once we received the receipt to sign the totals were different when I confronted them they basically tried to tell me that's what the bill said then said it was for the left overs (Mind you there was 5 pieces of the scallop roll left cause it was junk) so I told her fine I'll pay for it. that's  $2 less for your tip. (lucky you are even getting one)."}
{"text":"We sat at the sushi bar and had good food and good service from one of the sushi chefs. However, the support from the waitstaff was awful. Water? Tea? Beer? Napkin? Menu? Hello? Someone help me over here? The waitstaff seemed incongruent to the vibe of the restaurant. These women were like the dim sum cart pushers at Lotus Garden. This is was not Japanese style service at all.

I had the salmon kama and some very good sashimi, but honestly the service was so haphazard that the next time I have sushi, I will probably go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Never go here, it the worst ever. Servers are old and confused. Place my beer away from me where I couldn't get it. Whole a lot of yelling and looking for the right  tables. The guys behind the bar are talking and not making them faster then other place I have been to. This place suck all in all."}
{"text":"I could eat here everyday. The sushi is very fresh.  Very friendly staff and excellent service.  One of my 2 favorite all you can eat sushi restaurants in Henderson."}
{"text":"I think this place is excellent for an all you can eat sushi.  The quality is very good. I'm addicted to sushi and have it about 3-4 times a week during the hot months. \"I love sushi\" in Henderson is my favorite of all, but they don't do all you can eat. If your looking for a great deal with the best quality, Sin City Sushi is the best around."}
{"text":"Just attempted to dine here as I had heard good things.  We walked into the restaurant and we not greeted.  We stood there awkwardly and then decided to seat ourselves.  We were there for about 5 minutes when we were never given a menu or even had our presence acknowledged.  We left without a trace!  We headed to Kaizen where the service is impeccable!"}
{"text":"Awesome service!  Our waiter was fun, efficient and he had great recommendations when we asked.  I thought they were reasonably priced, right on par with other AYCE places.

The rolls were pretty good.  I wish I could be a more informative reviewer for you, but I don't remember all the names of the rolls we ordered...there were quite a few.  I preferred the rolls without sauces, but I really didn't come across any that I disliked...everything was pretty tasty.  The chef brought out mussels for us eventhough we hadn't ordered them and I was glad he did because they were pretty good!  I ended the night with vanilla mochi and my AYCE sushi experience was complete :)

I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"i love this place, way better than sushi mon haha,, reasonable prices .. and food is delish :)"}
{"text":"We use to love this place.  Actually a year ago I gave it 4 stars.  Now we will NEVER go back!  There is a old lady server there who has no business being a server.  She is far to confused and senile to work there.  So the food was good until it was ruined by the fact it sat there rather than being delivered to the table.  The sushi chef actually had to deliver it to our table because she could not keep up.  We saw people coming and leaving before us.  We had one list and never received all the items, until then we were getting two of each item?
Then the servant said \"you, you, you\" and \"so what do you want\".  Amazing?!  So if you don't want service where you will be verbally attacked or you prefer not to watch a server run around like a chicken with her head cut off...I suggest you drive to the next sushi bar as there are PLENTY here in town for which you don't need to feel like you are inconveniencing them for serving food."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times over the past five months... four of which I did the AYCE. The quality of the fish IS fantastic- I don't feel grody and full when I leave even after stuffing my face. I'm not a rice Nazi so I can't say whether the rice was up to par or not... because it's rice- plain and simple.

Service: always good! Friendly and thorough wait staff and informative sushi chefs! I frequent about five different sushi places and if I don't die of mercury poisoning this place will stay at the top #2 spot for me."}
{"text":"I've recently been back to Sin City Sushi. I'm confident to give it another star now. The quality of the food and the in-house service has improved. I feel like they are taking more time with the sit down customers than before. I will definitely go back. The cucumber salad & ultimate tuna roll are great!"}
{"text":"Poorly constructed sushi. It was falling apart on my plate before I even picked it up. The fish were cut improperly. My four year old could have probably done a better job. Salmon was bland.. Did not taste fresh at all. Not sure how this place gets good reviews. Their rolls were all rice, other bad reviews were right. Feels like you're eating rice balls. It's obvious most of these reviewers have not eaten at an actual good sushi restaurant, or haven't eaten sushi before, if your standards are this low. Sushi you get at Smith's grocery or Costco taste better than this place. Try Goyemon or Yama sushi for AYCE. Then you can tell me what you still think about this place."}
{"text":"Wow. Completely difference experience now from the previous times I have been here. Service sucks. Period."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here.  Food was amazing.  Service was fast and friendly.  Ramone was the highlight of my awesome visit."}
{"text":"been going intermittently for years

grouchy heavy set waitress finally wore us down and refused to go anymore

reading these reviews helped to not take her terrible attitude and service personal

the best ayce rolls keep us thinking about the place"}
{"text":"Adequate AYCE sushi within walking distance from my house. The menu is standard, and the space is not that big. Service was okay.

Price was as expected/typical for AYCE sushi. There is nothing particularly special about this AYCE sushi place, but it is clean and tasty."}
{"text":"My fave sushi spot EVER period. Been going here since they were on Eastern and I consistently crave their mussels, oyster shots, uni, ikura and pretty much.... everything. It's always a great place to go when you're having a rough day or wanting to celebrate a great day. Heck, why even need a reason other than to eat high quality sushi around super friendly peeps?!"}
{"text":"This review is long overdue as my husband and I have been regulars here since they opened earlier this year. This is the sister restaurant of Kai Sushi (on Durango and Flamingo), our other favorite sushi joint.  

There is an abundance of All You Can Eat Sushi places in town and everyone swears by their favorite. I swear by this one and will fight to the death with anyone who disagrees with me.  

The owners proudly guarantee to their patrons that they have the freshest fish in town.  They truly do. My favorite appetizers are their famous green mussels and baby tako (baby octopus).  I like to order the No Name #2 hand roll, Kasia roll, and the Vampire roll.  Sometimes the owners give us some complimentary nigiri like the freshest albacore belly I've ever had. 

Aside from their food and decent prices, the welcoming and friendly nature of the owners and staff is what makes guests into regulars.  Sin City Sushi is my personal favorite sushi place in town and, if you give it a try, I'm sure it will be yours."}
{"text":"First of all, the only reason why this place is even getting 2 stars from me, is because the food was pretty good.

But.... Omg the service, or lack of.... I cannot even deal.

We got an older asian lady and her service was so horrible we weren't even going to leave a tip. She took about 15 minutes to even seat us. And it was not even that busy; she brought food to another table, saw us standing there, passed by us and went to sit behind her counter in the back of the restaurant. Looked up at us at least 10 times THEN decided she wanted to get up to seat us. Without even a \"I'll be right with you\" in between. Really?!?!

Honestly, I don't even remember what we ordered. The service was so bad, that is pretty much the only thing I remember. I just remember that the food was pretty good & because the Spicy Salmon is one of my favorite rolls, and I always order it, I remember it was really good.

First orders are made using the checklist style menu which isn't even printed clearly. Whatever you plan on eating, you better order it then because she did not even come back to check on us until 25 minutes into our meal and we wanted to order more food. (We sat at a table because the bar didn't have space for me and my boyfriend to sit together).

FINALLY after several attempts of trying to wave the lady down, a younger guy from BEHIND THE BAR came to help us and take our orders. He was great, really nice, apologized that the lady didn't see us, and took our orders and remembered all of it to the T. Even refilled our drinks! And he is the only reason why we left a tip and handed it directly to him.

The only way I would go back............ Actually, nope, nevermind. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"OMG this place was so freaking good. My boyfriend and I almost didn't want to check this place out because of some of the bad reviews we saw on here but don't believe everything you read. I'm really glad we followed our instinct and came anyway because this place was great. The food was absolutely delicious and the staff was very accommodating. All you can eat is definitely the way to go. The sushi chef kept recommending all these tasty rolls and appetizers. The green mussels were the best I've ever had and the sauce was addicting. I don't have any complaints and I highly recommend this place to any sushi lover."}
{"text":"This is our go-to sushi place. Do not be turned off because it is an all-you-can-eat joint. Their fish is fresh, their service is good, the menu has a nice variety, and we always leave super happy. 

1. Baked mussels are a MUST. Unbelievably yummy.
2. My favorite rolls are the Jaime Special and the Kasia. But there are so many to choose from, we've tried most of them, and they are all good.
3. The baby tako is one of our favorites, too. Delish!
4. You can call in your order for take-out! You can't get the all-you-can-eat pricing though."}
{"text":"I will definitely be back to this place. The sushi is delicious BUT the must have is the GREEN MUSSEL'S... Beyond delicious. I don't know what they put on them but man are those bad boys yummy. The service was also ok from our waitress but an older gentleman and one of the sushi makers made up for it. They were awesome. All in all a good experience."}
{"text":"Okay, we've been here about 2 or 3 more times since my last review and its always been consistent as far as the food and service goes...what's very cool is that you are not on a 60 minute time frame to eat all the sushi you can, Jesse and da boyz like to \"talk story\" and that makes you feel more appreciated as a customer and you don't feel that they're watching you and the time so that they can turn tables and make as much money as possible.

We took my sister and her boyfriend this time, and Jesse hooked it up as usual and we all had a great time.

Nothing negative to say about this place, and I love their \"you can order from the menu, or we can just feed you\" style of all you can eat as well...
Looking forward to seeing all you fellow Yelpers Tuesday night....ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"What's better than a sushi place so close to home? Decided to take a family evening walk to Sin City to pick up a few rolls for dinner. Went in and ordered and requested for a to go order. Got my basic California roll and spicy tuna roll. No complaints there.  Husband ordered the Durango & one other. He noted a weird heavy feeling in his stomach that he never just gets. Went to sleep like all was good until I was woken up at 4 am to him rushing to the toilet! Horrible horrible horrible. Seems like this has been a recurring problem at this location recently! Stay far away if food poisoning doesn't sound appealing to you! I warned you!"}
{"text":"Can I say SHIT on here?

The WORST! I cannot say it  enough...cold dead fish and it smelled, threw it in the trash...

Can I say SHIT again?"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite sushi places in Las Vegas. Awesome service. Wonderful rolls. I love this place."}
{"text":"I've never reviewed a restaurant because most of the time i just don't care enough. I hate the idea of writing a bad review because I'm empathetic toward small business owners. 

However, this restaurant seems to have enough unwarranted raving reviews for me not to feel guilty revealing the truth. I've lived in Vegas for 8 years and I have my regular sushi spots. The only reason I decided to try this joint was because it was a Friday night and my regular choices had a 1-2 hour wait. I remembered reading all of the positive reviews for this place so I decided to check it out. Maybe the fact that there was no wait at 8pm on a Friday night should have been the first indicator...

The service was really slow. The food took a VERY long time. My friend's spicy tuna roll took twice the time as one of our deep fried rolls. Our server was sweet and I had no problem with her demeanor but SHE was just as slow. I say this because there were several times that I saw our rolls sitting and waiting to be delivered for quite some time before she brought it over. The amaebi nigiri that I ordered was sitting on the counter for so long before I got it that the heads were completely cold and soggy. Strangely enough, the busser was EXTREMELY efficient...almost too efficient. It began to irritate me that they were so quick to clear the table but couldn't get any help to deliver the food. I know that sounds extremely critical but it just did not sit well with me. Again, the server was extremely nice and even apologetic for the slow service so she got her 20% tip but I was a server for years...I'm not sure if others would be as patient.

Now I am usually forgiving of slow service if the taste is worth the wait. In this case, the taste was definitely not worth ANY wait. The rice was too watery and ruined the taste of the rolls. The sashimi did not taste fresh and some of it even lacked any taste at all. I ordered the uni and it was literally stale and dried up. This may be one of the worst sushi places I have ever been to just based on taste. Additionally, the AYCE menu is limited in comparison to others in city. Natto and toro were not included on the AYCE. Toro I can understand but why not the Natto? Same goes for the side orders.

There are much better options in town for sushi. I Love Sushi is probably one of the best in town and I would suggest Yama Sushi or Sushi-Mon for AYCE over this place any day. You just have to be willing to wait to be seated...but there's a reason people are lining up to eat there."}
{"text":"Yayy! Back in business! 1st day open at the new location!! We are happy sushi eaters!!!"}
{"text":"This is our go to sushi spot!! Everything is always super fresh and consistency is very important to us!!! They do offer AYCE, but we order by the roll... Top faves:

*Jamie's special
*starburst
*joes special
*wet dream
*ultimate tuna

The new location is new, clean and wonderful!! Highly recommend!!
See you here!"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite sushi restaurants in Vegas!  Me and my fiancee are avid sushi fans so after hearing about this new joint up out in Henderson, we decided to give it a try and see what Sin City had to offer.  Upon arrival, we were greeted and seated right away.  We also only (usually) do all-you-can-eat so we let the friendly server know and he brought us out the AYCE menu.  He also gave us a run down of the staff working, introduced us to them, and gave us a background on their restaurant and workers which I thought was awesome!  After our order was placed, our sushi came out right away.  The Japanese Lasagna, Vampire roll and the one with the mushrooms and scallions (I'll update with the name when I get a chance) *Edit: The mushroom and scallion roll is called the Lew Roll :)* were the most killer rolls out of the entire AYCE menu (IMO of course haha).  The thing I liked about this place is that we kept ordering and our sushi kept coming out right away.  What more can you ask for right?  Plus, the staff (especially the manager) came over and asked for our opinions on the rolls and service and was delighted to receive as much feedback as he could in order to make the experience even better.  They also had a TV behind the sushi bar for the avid sporting fans and actually changed the channel to accommodate the people at the bar; definitely a nice touch.  The low lighting was nice and the simple yet fitting decor made the restaurant seem real \"homey\".  Not much else to say except EAT AT SIN CITY SUSHI and you definitely be delighted.  So far so good in my opinion and best of luck to this new sushi restaurant and looking forward to seeing you folks again!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular...GRUB...I always roll out of here after eating AYCE.  The chefs take pride in their creations.  I know there are other spots but I keep coming back here for my sushi fix."}
{"text":"Food was good however...service was horrible. It took a while to be greeted when arriving, took so long to get our order, in fact they didnt even ask us if we wanted a water refill. Each order took about 30 minutes till we received it. They have \"all you can eat\" but the real good plates is only one per person. I wouldn't come back here ."}
{"text":"Service: 5/5
Their service is amazing!! OK, there were only about 3-4 other occupied tables when I was there, but the workers are really nice and don't ignore you. My friend and I got the AYCE lunch and it was definitely worth it. Their a la carte menu is a bit pricey, so if you can eat more than a few orders of fish go with AYCE.  The waiter was really nice and came by very quickly to continue to take our orders. He also made suggestions and encouraged us to eat more.  They are really nice and accommodating. As long as what you want to eat is somewhere on the AYCE menu you can request them to make certain rolls for you.

Food: 3.5/5
The food was good.... not great. If you have the rolls, do not order too many fried rolls because they fill you up really quickly. I tried a few rolls and the only \"complaint\" I had was that there was TOO much sauce. (I'm sure others think it's just fine, but if you don't like too much sauce, I'd just ask for the sauce on the side.) 
I mostly stuck with the salmon. I didn't really enjoy the tuna as much... and the one order of yellow tail did NOT look much like the picture. I appreciated the rice to fish ratio and liked that the rice had a good texture and taste."}
{"text":"I would say I'm middle of the road on this place. The service was ok. The sushi was ok too. It seemed fairly clean. We didn't have an awful time but it was just average. Nothing dazzling here."}
{"text":"I ordered a Salmon Teriyaki lunch special and all I got was white rice and the salmon teriyaki. No soup, no salad and other extras. I asked the server who looks like the owner too. She said that sometimes customers do not like all the extra stuff so I should have asked her. There's a reason why it's called a lunch special. You feel special for less the price. Only place in Vegas who serves lunch special this way. I think they're penny pinching like me. Never asked me for refill on tea too.  Otherwise, the salmon teriyaki was good."}
{"text":"We came her for dinner it took more than 30 min to get a salad we order we ordered a beer which they forgot to bring to get 7 things on the menu too more than two hours the sushi was not that great it was not the worst I've had but would not come back the young girl was trying but she favored the tables close to the back and because she was trying is that I'm giving it 2 stars if not  I would of done a 1 star"}
{"text":"yeah this place is amazing! going to vegas for the weekend and just wanted to find a good sushi restaurant, so i was yelping around and found this place. the food is great and the server is really friendly. they offered some really good suggestions and it's just great. the ones i like the most is the vampire roll and the green muscle. I'm going to make this place a must visit  every time we come."}
{"text":"Outstanding!!!!!  Salmon nigiri is like butter!  Garlic sauce is a house secret recipe and delicious! All the specialty rolls were amazing! Mario special was off the chain. The garlic tuna and Kashi was as well. Yuzu ice cream is the best!!!!  Very fresh and very fast service!!! Ramon was our server. He is very friendly and great service!!!!"}
{"text":"It was a quite disappointing experience.  The fish weren't fresh and the rice is flavorless and hard.  The ratio of fish to rice is not proportional.  Typical AYCE...I'm giving this place a 2 star because they are friendly.  Don't waste your money here.  I rather go to Sushimon and Goyemon"}
{"text":"Wow. I don't know how this place has 4 stars. By far the worst experience I've had anywhere in my whole life. 6 of us walked in, several tables weren't bussed. We set up our own table and waited and waited and I finally just got up and picked up our own menus. After that, the server came by and took the menus because we wanted ayce and ayce was a different menu. After that she gave us 3 menus and we had to beg her for our waters. Lol. Gosh we should have left  then. So 45m pass and we only got 2 orders or shrimp tempra and 4 orders of albacore. So pissed! 4 parties walk in and got their rolls and I Asked her, \"why are they getting their food first?! We were here way before them\" And she said because they were al la carte. Wtf!!??? I told the kids to get in the car and told her we're only paying for what we got. So I walk to the register and saw what she was charging us and she was writing the rolls we didn't get and I told her we never got those rolls and she can check the plates that  were still left on the table. Bill came out to 64$ and I still left 6$ tip. I def don't recommend coming here. Sooooooo stupid!!!"}
{"text":"Worst sushi I have ever had in Vegas so far. Walked on a Friday night, was told to wait(literally one word\"wait\") then we sat down and ordered some sushi. After we saw the sushi there, we are shocked. Those were RICE BALL, don't fk tell me that a small tiny piece of fish meat on the top and a HUGE chuck of rice underneath that is so big I even forgot to be angry      Is SUSHI!! we were not offered with wasabi(no ketchup when you order fries) the whole time. Uni here not fresh, smelled like toilet, so dinner price we paid is wasted. At very last he server came to us ask how much we would like to give.....Mouth wide opennnnnnnnnn!   I mean for real, there are tons of good ayce sushi here like sakana, Yama and jingja, double the fish and half the rice and same price, we would\"t go there if we weren't around anyway. It was a disaster !!"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  I wouldn't come here. Places like jjanga and 808 are affordable and have much better service"}
{"text":"Went with a friend from the area and apparantly since the managment changed in Feb the quality, selection, and service has gotten significatly better. The all you can eat menu is made to order and includes an extensive list of delicious specialty rolls, very fresh traditional nigiri, great appetizers (my fiancée loved the oyster shooters), and a good selection of desserts.  Highlights included some of the tastiest custom rolls I have ever had and fish so good that I never poured a drop of soy sauce. I can't wait to visit my friend in Vegas again and come here again. Apparantly he says he will be back next week for sure in the meantime."}
{"text":"The family went here last night after our friends recommended it. We don't normally eat at ACYE sushi bars. I prefer to eat at Hyamkumi in Caesars Palace or I Love Sushi in Henderson. We arrived around 6pm and were promptly greeted and handed menus. It was $26 for adults and $13 for kids...luckily they don't know our kids eat like adults. We started off with the Ahi Poke and it was really good..tuna was of high quality. We then ordered the Screaming O...and it was not the same tuna. It was light pink like it had been frozen and then they poured thousand island dressing over it...yuck! The kids didn't mind it. We ordered a wide variety of rolls but after the first round the tabloes started filling up and the service slooooowwwwed way down. My husband was ready to walk out. The salmon and hamachi nigeri were both delicious. The girls finished with mochi. We walked out very full, but decided we prefer quality over quantity. Do not think we will return, but if ACYE is your thing this place was better then Yama."}
{"text":"Cooked food and oyster shooters were good.  Sushi and rolls were ok but they came with a lot of rice.  Service was slow but understandable because there was only one waitress serving the whole restaurant."}
{"text":"We are from California and love eating sushi everywhere we get a chance. We were really hoping for an extraordinary Gastro-Glossal experience . The sushi was average in contrast to other places we have had. The waitress we had was very difficult to understand due to her heavy accent. She never checked in to see if we needed anything and had to physically be flagged down for the orders which took a long time to be served. When we finally were handed our sushi rolls, waitress practically threw the plate at us and almost dropped our food. She didn't even notice to say the least! The baby tako was unfortunately not good and a waste of money. 
If u are in town and looking to eat sushi I suggest you try somewhere else. The roll we did like was their \"Ugly Roll\". We Spent $70 dollars and it hurt, felt like I threw sand in my eyes."}
{"text":"Ok, here's the deal.  This place is now my favorite sushi restaurant in the world.  Speaking as someone who has traveled A LOT, that is saying something - trust me.  When taking into account the food, service, selection and value you just can't beat this place.  

I normally hate sushi buffets, or all you can eat sushi because the fish grade is normally quite low - NOT HERE.  This is the same qualify fish you would get at a place like Nobu.  I only came here because a friend wanted to go and I didn't want to argue.  I'm glad I went now!

I've been to Sin City at least 15 times now and each time I'm never disappointed.  I've never had a single bite of food there I didn't enjoy.

Did I mention the service is amazing?  I've seriously never met a friendlier group of wait staff.  They are amazing.  The food comes out quickly too.   

There should be an option for 6 stars for this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite ayce sushi place. Chef is very picky about the freshness of the seafood. My faves: garlic tuna nigiri, Japanese lasagna, baby tako salad.
The owners are so humble and nice. This is already the 3rd time back since the reopening in the new location."}
{"text":"I was referred by a friend and love the sushi! Always delicious Moon now knows  what I like to order and my name by my third visit! She sees me walk in and gets it going. The all you can eat is fantastic! My whole family loves Sin City Sushi"}
{"text":"This is the first place I tried mussels, and they are the BEST.  Also the first place I tried the Screaming O, and many more firsts.  If I get a seat at the bar with the chef there's no other place I'd rather be in the world.  He recommends different things and everything is great.  I always get the AYCE.  If you are at a table, the service can be a little slow.  But it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place out because of all the good reviews on Yelp and was disappointed. Bad sign when it only had white folk eating there and we were the only asians to be seen.  Aside from that, there were a number of reasons for the disappointment:

1) First off, when you go to a vegas ayce sushi joint you expect mediocre quality fish because of the sheer volume these places put out as well as the fact that you're in the middle of the desert.  That being said, the quality of the fish at 808 Sushi and both Sushi Mon locations are better imo.  

2) Rice. It was over cooked & gummy, and they put way too much rice on their nigiri!  Good sushi has a nice slice of fish covering a small dollop of sushi rice, but not here.  Each piece had a lot of overcooked rice underneath. Bleh.

3) Selection wasn't very good for the side dishes.  Most of these ayce sushi restaurants have their special side dishes in addition to the sushi to give your tastebuds a rest from all the sushi you consume.  Tried the teri salmon (meh), pork katsu (thin and dry), shrimp tempura (okay), soft shell crab (too much batter), and oyster shooters (pretty good).  Other places offer hamachi kama, kal bi, miso cod (butterfish) just to name a few things--not here. Sides were weak sauce here.

4) I've read about how you \"MUST HAVE\" the vampire roll, baby octopus, and fried banana for dessert, and all were painfully mediocre.  First two I had at the beginning of the meal while I was still hungry, and both were a struggle to finish.  Maybe I'm spoiled from living in Hawaii, but think of somewhere that has tako poke that is \"just alright\", and it probably tastes better than this baby octopus app.  Fried banana was pitiful--after one bite i opted to finish the green tea ice cream that came with it instead (Maeda-en, which isnt that great to begin with).

Maybe all of the 5 star ratings got my hopes up a little, but that doesn't change the fact that this place is below avg when it comes to Vegas ayce sushi.  Service was alright, nothing terribly wrong happened, just had a below-avg dining experience here due to the food.  Seriously--808 Sushi, Sushi Mon (both locations), Oyshi Sushi, Hikari are all better than this place.  Hell, if I was in that part of town jonesing for some ayce sushi I'd just walk across the street to Island Sushi!!  Will not go back."}
{"text":"We had quite a nice AYCE experience last night.  3 of us ravenously dined on all the tasty offerings.  

Service was quirky but very attentive.  Much friendlier and more helpful than your average sushi place.  

AYCE was $26 and included everything you would want and expect with a ton of specialty rolls, and dessert.

We had miso soup, seaweed salad, baby tako, 7 or 8 rolls, sushi, gyoza, baked green mussels, soft shell crab, and so on.  

The miso soup was very flavorful, the baby tako was a lovely, tender sesame flavored surprise, and the baked green mussels were extra caramelized and delicious.  The hamachi and garlic tuna was fresh and delightful.

We were very pleased with most of the rolls.  

Our food came out very slowly, and was well paced.  Normally, you are bombarded with everything your ordered within minutes and you can hardly discern what is what.  All the items we ordered came out individually, 5 - 10 minutes apart.  It gave us plenty of time to chat and enjoy each item.  

I would definitely return and add sin city sushi to the list of my to go places for AYCE."}
{"text":"While the food here was pretty good, the service is sub par. We waited literally 15 minutes between rolls so we got full pretty quick from the food settling. They even forgot some of the appetizers that we had ordered. Probably would not come back here if I had other choices to choose from."}
{"text":"For an AYCE establishment, this place gives plenty of fresh fish and doesn't overwhelm you with rice. I love the fact that their scallop hand roll doesn't consist of imitation crab mixed up with baby scallops... It's ALL scallop. They don't skimp and are very generous with their portions. They also give a generous slice of avocado, not just a sliver like a lot of other places. Awesome, awesome, awesome!!!"}
{"text":"I seriously go to Sin City every few weeks and I live all the way across town.  Last night I tried a few things I had never had at Sin City before:  

Blackjack roll - Deep fried, jalapeno, cream cheese and salmon
Jalapeno Poppers - Half a jalapeno, filled with cream cheese, tempura breaded and fried (So good!!!)
Seafood Salad - This has a variety of fresh fish on a salad bed.  Very good

Every time I return to Sin City after cheating with a sushi restaurant closer to my house, I am amazed at the awesomeness of this place.  I just wish you did a frequent diner card b/c I would rack up!"}
{"text":"This place was recommended by two different people who did not know one another.  So I thought I should try it.  We walk in and basically seat yourself.  We then sit down and order drinks.  We ask what the specialty rolls are and proceed to order three rolls, edamame and miso soup.  The miso comes out, then the edamame.  We then wait, and wait and wait.  In the meantime there is a couple that comes in after us and gets four rolls.  The waitress apologizes and tells me it will me a few more moments.  Finally we get a roll, it was mediocre at best.  We wait and wait while others around us are getting their food.  Finally I couldnt wait any longer and told the waitress that we wanted to leave.  I will make it a personal goal of mine to go out of my way to tell people how horrible this place is. DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!  I got in my car and went to I love sushi, which by the way is awesome.  I highly recommend the I love sushi roll."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Their all you can eat is amazing.  Great selection and high quality fish used in all sushi.  Chefs are friendly and helpful.  Can't get much better then this place."}
{"text":"Time to add one more AYCE-capable sushi place to my Vegas list.

I was wondering how this place was different from other sushi restaurants, and I was pleased to see a board with a lot of one-per-person or two-per-person options. The more unique ones include bacon skewers, beef yakitori skewers, oyster shooters, baby tako, asparagus tempura, and poke that can come in chicken or salmon or oyster varieties instead of just tuna.

There were a few issues that I wanna highlight. First, the food seemed to come out a little slowly compared to, well, any other of my usual sushi destinations. Second, even though we had to mark our first order on paper menus, they did not really fulfill that order completely and left us having to do at least one reorder. Finally, I was kinda not impressed by the nigiri. The pieces were unusually large, with a slight bias toward the rice that wasn't even done that well. I mean it wasn't normal rice, but the texture at least was off and it didn't stand up as well as other nigiri that I've had in the area. Also, in terms of fish that I tried, only the hamachi was good (disappointments: salmon, garlic tuna, super white).

The one thing that really made me not drop this below a 4-star review was when they came out to explain that they were out of salmon kama and offered to replace it with hamachi kama, which is normally not on the AYCE menu. This type of gesture hasn't happened at two or more other places that I've been to. On top of that, the hamachi kama was actually really yummy and tender, and aside from having to remove the burnt skin, it was the highlight of the night for me.

Other items that I enjoyed: the oyster shooters (I think it's two per order) were pretty balanced, even though I had to reorder them; the baked mussels were good, if mayo-y; the salmon teriyaki was really good and could be a pre-dessert (since this is a one dessert per person place); the soft shell crab was so good (and small, compared to Blue Fin Sushi) that I wished it wasn't one per person; the vampire roll was nice and the surf and turf roll had pretty nice beef on top; the fried banana was sundae-like and was a pretty filling dessert.

Oh, and I also appreciated the lack of lemon in the water. I'm really put off by the lemon that permeates the water. No, I don't really care if it's just tap water that might not even be filtered, I want just water.

I wasn't expecting the next coming of Goyemon or anything, and there's definitely some ups and downs. Still, I think it's worth a first try if you're in the mood for something new."}
{"text":"I so hate to write this review because the food was really good. At least the food we received, we never got the rest we wrote down on the liitle paper. The service was bad, not slow just really really bad. I just paid $57 for three rolls and 2 appetizers.  Never again, so sad! Dont waste your time!"}
{"text":"We like sushi this place is ok. Some rolls are great some not so much so I recommend go all you can eat the first time and stuff your self with Stacie rolls."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat sushi in Henderson/Las Vegas.  Although the service can be slow at times, the food is great!!  The sushi chefs will make the food as spicy as you want and there is great variety!  The fish is always fresh and never a bad experience since starting to eat with Young and Moon in 1999!!"}
{"text":"DISGUSTING!!!! 
The crap of the shrimp is left in the shrimp..... When I told the waitress about it she at 1st she seemed stunned and said she was going to show the cook and even said \"I don't know why it is like that\" refering to our shrimp tempura that had alot of mushed up black shrimp crap inside of it. Then after a few minutes she came back with a different demeanor.... she said all their shrimp is like that and that she could bring us more vegetable tempura but that all their shrimp dishes uses the same shrimp. I said \"I'm sure you use the same shrimp but \"good/clean\" restaurants clean out the shrimp. Her response was \"No one ever complained before\".... 
My sister said well maybe your poor customers don't notice or even know that the shrimp should be cleaned. Your cook is lazy and your customers are being tricked....
We asked to speak to the Manager and she said she was the manager- yeah, I don't think so.... She took off $4.00 -which came down to $1.00 per shrimp that wasn't eaten... 
 I have reviewed this place before a few years ago and I'll tell you one thing if their shrimp at the time had as much shrimp poop inside their shrimp as it did the other day I would've noticed and gave them a 1 star. So they must have had a change in management or they need to review the cleanliness aspect of preparing their food for their customers to eat. 
Don't get me wrong the food itself taste wise is just fine and maybe that's why the shrimp crap is overlooked by most of their customers but it was just disgusting to me. 

We eat out alot and most of the time it is for sushi and I can't imagine a (good) sushi chef who truly cares about the sushi they are preparing and serving to their customers will be willing to serve unclean shrimp..... NO!! That's just a NO!!! 
Shrimp poop is not made for consuming......"}
{"text":"Definitely the best sushi I've had in Vegas so far (only tried 3 places before this though). 

Fish was fresh and tasty. Nigiri was the best. Everything except the uni was fresh and the texture just right. I'm fairly picky with my uni though, so it may have been just fine for some people.

Rolls were hit and miss. 

Vampire,  Lew, Spicy hamachi and Wet dream tasted great. Just the right amount of everything to let the flavors come through.

Lasagna and Poncho was alright. I felt the sauces overpowered anything that the sushi roll could have offered. 

Spider roll and Double seared were total misses. The spider roll was by far the worse I've ever tasted. The soft shell crab was way too mushy. And the double seared, the fish had an off taste to it. I know it wasn't the fish itself because we all had the nigiri version of the albacore and tuna and it was delicious."}
{"text":"Great sushi always good service even when they were at serene and eastern. I will follow them where they go in Las Vegas Vegas Bedt Bet for good food"}
{"text":"The food disappointed us. My stomach not feels good when got home. Either my friend. And still feel really uncomfortable when this morning woke up. Terrible place. And some waitress service really bad. It'll ruin your appetite & destroy the atmosphere. I won't choose this restaurant again. Bad experience!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and everytime is bad service! The sushi chefs are good but the wait staff is horrible! I've never had to ask for refills, napkins, anything as much as I have here. The owner was also rude when I asked for something. Not the freshest not worth it! Don't waste your time go to YAMA!!!"}
{"text":"Ok I like Sin City Sushi. I thought it was fairly good and they offered sweet shrimp on their AYCE menu as well as uni.  When we first got there, there seemed to be a good amount of people for a Saturday night. We were seated at the bar quickly.  After looking through the menu for about 5 minutes we placed our order. I think all of our sushi started coming out 5 minutes later and everything that we ordered was done in the span of 15 minutes. There were 3 different sushi chefs handing us our rolls and nigri. I felt overwhelemed by so much sushi around me. Everything was fairly good, but after awhile the rolls just seemed to look the same and taste the same. Our main sushi chef, Jesse, was friendly and like I said the service was really quick for our first round. They started getting a rush of people coming in so for the next round we had to wait a bit...which meant we started to get hungry again.  We were able to leave full though.  Service is good and the sushi was good; however, since its across the town from us, I'm not sure how frequently we will be coming back.  

P.S. No pictures were taken since I was starving!"}
{"text":"I've been to Sin City enough times to be considered a regular. They've already recognized my face and manage to make me feel very welcome each time drop by. The sushi definitely seemed to improve over the first time I reviewed this place, which is why I updated my review to 5-stars. Everything comes out super fresh and not overly drenched in sauces, which is a common thing I tend to see in AYCE sushi joints. Sashimi was delish, the baby tako and oyster shooters are always a must-order each time I go, plus the specialty rolls seemed to have gotten better than I remembered. Be sure to try the fried banana dessert to end your meal: fried bananas topped with vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup. Always leaves me happy. 

Service is also impeccable each time I go. They make sure I'm satisfied and I always do end up feeling that way at the end of the meal.

I can't say enough good things about this place. I'd like to keep it my little secret, due to the non-crowded, laid back local groove that this place has to offer. But, I'll be kind and share the love."}
{"text":"Great service! Our waitress even brought us out a couple of slices of a roll for us to try free of charge! It was slow when we went as we were there at an off time. 

My only complaint was that there were a lot of rolls that had mayo on them. Nothing grosses me out more than hot majo slathered all over a sushi roll. Shudder. But the non-mayo rolls were great."}
{"text":"It was my first time trying this place. I've always wanted to try it but never had a chance. Went there around 2pm and it was empty. Service was good. Food was great also. You have to order the VAMPIRE ROLL and the STACIE ROLL... It was the bomb. And the FRIED BANANA ICE CREAM.. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"My last experience here actually made me want to start a Yelp account. I've been coming to this place off and on for the past 3 or so years. Typically, my experiences have always been amiable. However, warning to the customer that there is a HUGE gap in the quality of service you recieve whether you are at the bar or sitting at a table. Quite frankly, the waitresses are terrible here. Every time I have ever sat at a table, I usually find myself waiting forever for them to come by and take my order.

The food, typically, has always been fairly good, although, my recent experiences with their nigiri makes me wonder if it's just whatever sauce they use to mask the quality of their fish. Despite that, several items I've come to enjoy, the No Name hand roll being probably my favorite.

My last time there, however, I sat in a booth with my fiancee and as we finished a small round of food (which took a very long time to come out), we sat there waiting for a long time. I finally stopped a waitress and asked if I could put in another order, which I did, and proceeded to wait another 20 minutes while the waitresses sat behind the cash register with blank stares on their faces (it was not busy). I finally got tired of waiting, got her attention, and just asked for the check. After paying, I asked if my food was still coming, and she proceeded to tell me that my order was 'complete'. That pretty much tipped me into anger, as I wasn't just sitting around for no reason. 

The waitress scrambled after I was so upset and he had the chef make my order which was out in less than a minute - that made me even more angry. I ate a few pieces, but lost my appetite and left. I doubt I will return here again. So sad that they lost a customer of so many years!"}
{"text":"This place truely deserves 5 stars.   Thank you Yelpers for sharing this place.  Coming to Las Vegas every couple months, sushi is something I typically reserve for back home in Los Angeles as most strip places are overpriced and underwhelming.  This place allows you to order essentially everything off the menu - from katzu to udon to sushi for a measly $22!  The sushi is 4 star quality, but the amazing value catapults this place to 5 stars.  You will not be dissapointed and it's well worth the 9 mile off the strip drive.  Tip: this place is near the airport, so make it your last stop before leaving the city."}
{"text":"Great sushi and great atmosphere. I had an amazing experience here and Leo was a great sushi chief and made the sushi to perfect"}
{"text":"This is easily my favorite sushi joint in town, when I stayed on that side of town I'd be in 3 nights a week! The fish is always fresh and their sauces are spot on. Plus I believe they have the baked mussels in town! 

It's always a plus sitting at the bar when you have great chefs there making your food and giving you some good conversation. Kudos Sin City, keep it up!"}
{"text":"Read all the reviews before coming seemed like it was going to be delicious and looked clean. Sat down table was dirty.  The server this older Asian women took our order no customer service at all.  She started cleaning all the tables around me then came and dropped off my food wtf?? HEALTH CODE?? So gross. The food started to come out first was the seaweed salad that was YELLOW. Rolls we're all rice. Fish was not fresh.  Not once did she come over to pick up any of the empty plates off the table. Overall a terrible experience I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"A new favorite! The rolls were delicious, especially the Kasia. The atmosphere was clean and the employees friendly."}
{"text":"I have the opposite view of most of the reviews of this place. The service was great, but the food was only okay. There are a lot of good sushi restaurants in Las Vegas. We are kinda spoiled by that fact. I give this place four stars because of the fact that they are decent."}
{"text":"So glad they are back!  I've seriously been missing the mussels, delicious sushi and the fried banana!  They have the freshest tasting sushi in town.  Service was excellent.  You have to come here, your belly will be full and happy!"}
{"text":"Good sushi and selection! Service is really great and we got our food quick. Best thing is the Oyster shooter!!!"}
{"text":"Oysters aren't in season so they don't offer oyster shooters, instead you're given half shell oysters and limited to 1 order per person.  The nigiri was not good at all, the salmon was mushy and my uni was a dull orange.  The rice to fish ratio was also off, too much rice for a small piece of fish!  I also noticed that a majority of the rolls had a garlic sauce that I wasn't too fond of after a couple rolls. And they only offer 1 piece of mochi per customer, they wanted to charge $1 extra for another piece of mochi, usually ayce sushi places don't care..  

Other than that, the baked green mussels are the best here.  And I enjoyed the baby tako very much!  I'd recommend the Vampire roll as well!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place 5 stars for many reason. The rolls were very good. The sushi was fresh. The chefs very attentive and friendly. The waitress was nice. I had a great experience! 

The ambiance is cool for a sushi place. I have frequented Yama Sushi and I love shushi, and I needed a new place that had good ratings. Thank god I found you. I will return! The taco salad was great!"}
{"text":"Oyster shooters. Gotta luvem. I stopped in for a little yellowtail and Oyster shooters. Service was good. It smelled non-fishy and that's good too. I didn't have any issues really. The shooters were a bit different tasting and seasoned better than I'm accustomed.  Nice surprise.  Overall,  I  was pleased and I'll be back."}
{"text":"This family run sushi joint has some delicious and creative rolls with funny tongue-n-cheek names like the \"Drum Roll\".  The service at the bar is always friendly & top notch but at the tables can be hit or miss.  I HATE having to ask for my ginger & wasabi AFTER I get my sushi (happened once & have observed it at other tables).  & I really hate having to wait for my beer. The quality of the fish is pretty good, the place is clean.  I guess I am considered a regular now because the"}
{"text":"This is the absolute best sushi place in Las Vegas! My husband and I love it so much we go almost once a week. The sushi is always fresh and the nigiri just melts in your mouth. The staff is really friendly and its always a pleasant experience. We have tried several other sushi places in town, but always come back to sin city."}
{"text":"Got to go on my way home.  Picked the best rated place on yelp.  Got 3 rolls and chic teriyaki for the gf as she doesn't like sushi, I know right?  Sushi was good.  Place was busy even for a Sunday night.  Hope to go back and dine in."}
{"text":"I like a sushi bar where everybody knows your name.  Since I've only been twice, we haven't gotten to that point yet.  but there were patrons there that were on a first name basis with the staff and vice versa.  one day soon, maybe i'll get there.  i mean, the service is friendly, the food is good, the place is clean and the seats are comfortable...not much more to ask for?  These things make me a pleased customer and keep me coming back. 


Likes:
-their rolls are tiny-ish.  they don't try to stuff it so much that all you can get is 2 rolls and then you're done 
-the \"screaming 'o'\" is available during lunch
-sides like salmon kama, fried tofu, bacon skewer, poke salad, screaming o....
- service was excellent!

Dislike:
-the green tea...  there was no taste to it, despite adding sweetener.  oh well!

I'm glad i searched on yelp to find another sushi spot aside from my favorite Sushi Wa...because of it, i now have 2 favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this has 4 stars. SO disappointed!!! Every time we ordered something for all you can eat, waitress said only allowed one. How is that all you can eat? Screaming o- only 1. Shrimp shumai (btw, order has 1 Shumai)- only 1. Desert- only 1. Marinated octopus- only 1. WTF! Lol The rolls fell apart and the unagi was fishy tasting. We will NOT be back. There is a reason we were only one of two tables in whole place at 630/7pm.... it's not good! Go to sushi 21, Sakana or sushi mon before you come here!"}
{"text":"Have no idea how someone can rate this place higher than a two.  What Cici's pizza is to pizza Sin City is to Sushi.  Sort of like eating in the high school cafeteria - if you take your sushi seriously this is not your place.  This place is about volume."}
{"text":"I come here all the time! The service can be improved there's no doubt. It can be down right terrible in waiting times on certain days. That being said, the sushi is fantastic. Fresh fish and an amazing fish to rice ratio that I appreciate. They aren't trying to fill you up with rice. They are trying to give you value for your buck. The Stacy roll is a favorite of mine. Their mussels are great. Absolutely love their nigiri. The staff is super friendly. This is not the fanciest place but it doesn't pretend to be. They are here for one thing ALL YOU CAN EAT. They just do sushi. When you want to eat so much that you enter a coma, this is my place to go. I'm probably here once a month even though I live about 30 minutes away. Vampire is another good roll. Don't be afraid to experiment and try new things."}
{"text":"This place is great!  Both myself and all my friends eat here as our all you can eat HQ!  Their chefs are pleasant and the sushi is excellent!"}
{"text":"This place was probably one of the worst sushi places that I have been to. The sushi quality nigiri was great but the rolls were all drowned in sauce. 

The service is why I'm giving this place 1 star. My party of 4 wasn't acknowledged at all when we walked in. Finally we just sat ourselves. The server came over to give us our menus. We finally ordered and I got my nigiri first. We had ordered 6 rolls. Waited for awhile and kept seeing food go past us to another table. I was looking at our neighboring table and was wondering what they got because it looked really good. Lo and behold those were actually our rolls. Instead of the server going to get us new ones she just picked up the dishes from the table and brought them over to us. Most of our rolls were just sitting on top of the sushi bar not delivered. By the time we got them since there was so much sauce our rolls were mushy messes. 

We didn't get 2 of our rolls and mentioned it to the server and she said that that was all we ordered. Instead of giving us another paper to order more she just ignored our table for 15 minutes until we had to openly chase her down to get another ayce sheet. Finally ordered two more rolls because we were fed up at the time and just wanted to leave. Rolls once again were just left sitting at the sushi bar. For 27 a person, it was a waste of money. 

I will never come back to this sushi restaurant. Kaizen and i love sushi are so much better and worth my money."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and I can only give it 2 stars.  Normally I am sure this is an ok place, it was rated at 4 stars with 103 reviews, however, that does not justify the treatment we received on this night.

We had 5 people in our party and 3 of use decided to take the all you can eat sushi.  We each ordered an appetizer and 3 rolls each.  3x3=9 in most places.  

So, first off the staff was friendly upon arrival and we were seated fairly quickly.  Our drink order was taken pretty fast as well as our order.  The appetizers came pretty quickly, however then the service came to a crawl.  First one roll, then finally another, by the end of an hour we had received 6 rolls.  I only got one of mine, someone else got two of hers and of course the last person got all three of hers.

We continually had to ask for refills on the tea as they were not coming over and checking on us.  They would come by and take the empty plates but would not always ask if we needed anything.  Finally our server came over and asked if there would be anything else?  NOW THE BATTLE BEGAN!!!!

I stated yes, I am still missing two rolls and she is missing one.  The server stated no your are not, I was told you received everything you ordered and I was told your table is done.  I stated that was incorrect and the we were still missing three rolls and named the three we were missing.  She again stated that she was told we received everything we ordered.  NOW WE ARE GOING TO BATTLE.  I ordered three rolls and only got one, DON'T\"T TELL ME I ATE THREE WHEN I DID NOT.  She then stated, let me go get your ticket and check.  She came back to the table and proceeded to read the entire ticket to me.

When she was done, I again stated by NAME the three rolls we did not receive.  With a frustrated sigh, she said let go check with the kitchen.  NOW HERE IS MY QUESTION; 

If I am ordering all you can eat, WHY ARE YOU GOING TO DEBATE ME ON HOW MUCH I RECEIVED?  The price is the same if I order one roll or twenty rolls, yes???

A few times through dinner we had to request refills instead of it just being done.  To clarify, they came to the table several times to pick up the empty dishes but would not always check to see if we needed anything.

When I am paying for something, I don't expect to be debated on what I ordered and received.  With several sushi places within a 5 miles radius of this place all offering all you can eat for about the same price, I can get better service without being debated by the staff on what I received and what I did not.  If you are the only person bringing me my food then maybe, but when there were two other people bringing stuff to the table, who the hell are you to debate me on what I received???

In closing the food was decent and does warrant 3 to 4 stars for quality.  We still left an 18% tip, 15% would have been too generous for the way we were treated.  None of the five of us have a desire to return to this place.  Like I said there are several places to choose from within a 5 mile radius of this place with the same quality or better and you will not be harassed by the staff or have to encounter and ugly battle or debate about what you received.  

ALL YOU CAN EAT MEANS, I ORDER IT, YOU HAPPILY BRING IT.  IF I DON'T EAT ALL I ORDERED, THEN YOUR POLICY IS TO CHARGE EXTRA.  NO WHERE IN YOUR POLICY DOES IT STATE YOU WILL DEBATE ME ON WHAT I RECEIVED AND PLACED IN MY MOUTH.  

I came here hungry, I believe I would know if I received and ate three rolls.  Two stars is more then generous for the treatment we received.  The good part, we now know a place we will NOT RETURN TO EVER AGAIN...."}
{"text":"Good sushi in Vegas!! Ok, I was quite surprised. 

I was feen'in for some sushi and yelped a place close to where I was. Tons of parking near the restaurant. 

Customer service was not as good as I expected, especially since it's a new sushi spot. There were not many people in the restaurant and seemed like the servers barely spoke English. 

Took almost 30 minutes to order our food. For a moment I was thinking that they forgot about my table. But after getting their attention they cake to our table.

We ordered:
Wet dreams $9.95
Kasia-12.95
Paradise- $7
Touchdown -7.95

To be honest everything was SUPER GOOD!! If I complained about the food I would be wrong. My all-time favorite was the Wet Dreams. OMG, Just the picture of it has me craving for more.

They also have an, \"All You Can Eat\" option for lunch and dinner. Lunch is $22.95 and dinner is $25.95. Do the math first and see if it's worth it. My table pretty much got full with the four sushi rolls we had so the option of all you eat was not worth it.

I would definitely recommend this spot but before I come back I would like the customer service to step there game up a little."}
{"text":"Forgot to write a review the other night. Me and my girl had a little date night and we like to try different sushi places. Sin city was a great place to eat. I forgot the names of the guys who worked. I believe one of them had glasses. Well. The food was great so yummy. Everyone should try this place."}
{"text":"As my wife and I sit here during a late lunch I had to take break to write this review. The food is fresh and delicious. Jessica who is waiting on us is friendly and efficient. We are eating a lunch that would have cost at least twice as much elsewhere. What an incredible find!!"}

{"text":"I went to this place last week.  We  went around 6 for dinner and got AYCE.  The rolls were ok, nothing super great about them.  The sushi was not very good.  Well at least the hamachi wasnt.  It was just sort of bland no taste.   I also didnt like how their app. menu was so small for the AYCE.  I love japanese food and part of what I love is being able to get various apps with my sushi.  I probably will not return."}
{"text":"Same great sushi in a new location on Maryland Pkwy. The quality is far above the majority of sushi places in Las Vegas."}

{"text":"Big time follower here from Sapporo sushi on Stephanie. Before it was all you can eat. We loved it.

Server was ok,  but the chef's and food made up for all of it. After they moved to eastern and serene, they had a chef named Jesse. He made excellent food! Experimented all kinds of stuff and sauces. Then he moved back to Japan is what I heard last. But the original chef Jimbo is still making masterpieces. 

I will sit at bar next time, to experience first hand. Sushi chefs are artists, it's amazing. Attention to detail. But the salmon skin handroll is one of my fav's!"}
{"text":"My sister ate here one day, and ate for hours! She was on vacation, and wanted to eat there twice in two days. If you have ever eaten at Sapporo Sushi on Stephanie, this is the same owners as the original. But the original closed down but they never had AYCE, but they do here. My fav is the baby tako, screaming orgasm, oyster shooters, maybe all of it!"}
{"text":"I want so bad to give this place five stars! The service was AWEFUL!! And I really don't say that often. 

My husband and I came for dinner late Friday I planned ahead and bought late movie tickets carving out 2 hours for dinner. Normally sushi restaurants have a time limit of an hour for dinner so I thought 2 hours would be fine. We were seated promptly and put our drink order in however it took about 20 minutes for someone to come take our order of food. we waited about 35 minutes before the first part of our order to arrive, keep in mind we ordered two salads, 3 orders of nigiri and a roll. It was not entirely busy as their we're open tables and spots at the bar and there was 5 chefs behind the bar. They brought out our order of salmon and one salad. 20 minutes after the nigiri and salad came the other salad was brought out 10 minutes later followed the roll. We decided not to order more with how long it had taken to put the order in and receive the food. We waited for them to come ask if we wanted more but no one came. The lady who was waiting on us kept stopping at the table next to us but never made it over. After an hour and forty minutes approx. (total time, 20 was just waiting for someone to come over) my husband got up and asked for the check. The salmon we did try was great and fresh and the roll was good. I am just super disappointed at the service and lack of assistance. I would not have cared at such a long dining experience had we received multiple rolls and orders of nigiri."}
{"text":"Sushi was awesome. Would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for good sushi. I will be back. Thanks for the great sushi"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for ages ever since I read Jessica T's review and discovered they have Oyster Shooters as part of their AYCE menu. I finally got my chance at last night's UYE. Thanks to Nelson Q for setting that up. There were about 16 of us sitting at an elongated table. It was great meeting new faces and conversing over good sushi.

Unfortunately, I can't name everything we ate. We went omakase style i.e. we mostly left it up to the sushi chef to decide what to make next. We did have the option to order whatever we wanted individually, but I opted to just eat whatever came. And boy did I. Pretty much everything that came out was good or very good. I can't say that anything blew me away, but I'd return on the strength of what I experienced.

About them Oyster Shooters. That's definitely a reason to return. A few of us had a couple of rounds. This was actually the first time I've had an Oyster Shooter in my life. Until recently in fact, I just wasn't into oysters.

Another first for me was Uni. I don't remember exactly why, but they've always been on my avoid list. However, Cin T's recent persuasion made me want to give them a shot. I enjoyed them and was surprised at how mild the flavor was. Quite the contrast to how totally NOT yummy they look.

When it came time for dessert, I went with the Fried Banana (banana tempura with ice cream). It was delicious, as expected.

Overall, it was a great night. Although I'm still partial to Yama Sushi, I'd return here for the Oyster Shooters. I also like the idea of coming in, sitting at the bar, and going omakase style."}
{"text":"I have never reacted like I did when I saw this place had opened back up. I literally jumped up and down in my seat driving by headed towards GJ's and screamed pointing \"they're back, they're back!!!!!\". And boy are they ever!!

Cravings for the perfectly sweet savory and sumptuous mussels, and the expertly marinated extraordinarily tender baby tako, don't just go away on their own. And when you get to have it again after so long unexpectedly, especially when it's better... Pheew!!! Satisfaction achieved exponentially. Mama. 

Not to mention the superb freshness of the fish. The artistically crafted and balanced rolls. This is the epitome of the perfect sushi joint. Add in the welcoming feeling you get when you walk in the door, like you're about to dine with family. Yeah buddy. Welcome back Sin City Sushi. So happy you're back. You have no idea!"}
{"text":"So I'm pretty partial to really fresh sushi growing up on the west coast... And needless to say I've been a bit hesitant to really delve into the Las Vegas sushi experience since I've been here (yes I've been depriving myself of my one true food love for over four years), but boy am I glad I checked with yelp before hubby and I gave it a shot.

Sin City Sushi exceeded my expectations. We went for the AYCE since we didn't eat a thing the whole day saving up our appetites for our date night. Sat at the bar, pretty early, around 5:30, was greeted very kindly by all three sushi chefs, and we began our feast. My favorite roll was the Lion, and their Hamachi and Unagi sushi were very fresh and yummy. Everything we tried was excellent, came out fast, and even got a few recommendations of orders to change when the chefs thought we'd like a different roll better than our selection.

By the time we left (7ish) the place was completely packed and everyone there seemed to either know someone's name or were being welcomed back again by the staff. 

This will not be the only time we visit Sin City Sushi. I was thoroughly impressed and now I can resume my food love affair once again. Thanks yelp!"}
{"text":"Amazing food quality, service and atmosphere. Servers were nice upon walking in. Chefs were in pint with food prep and show. Everything tasted fresh of that exact moment and not a day old. Halibut was top notch and the Orleans rolls is a must for the spicy lovers. Goota come back quick. Must visit!!!!"}
{"text":"I really really really want to give this place 5 stars because the workers are nice & the food is great, but the service is just so slow. I think they are understaffed because they only had one lady taking orders. 

The food was excellent though! I don't remember the rolls we ordered but the quality of the fish is excellent and the rolls were pretty unique. 

I've only been here once & we sat at the bar. Even then, our food came pretty slow. There aren't any other complaints besides the fact that the flow of the food was slow."}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE sushi spots ever! 

Signature rolls are so good!  My faves were the Hamachi Lover's Roll and Misty! 
Owner/ Chef had us the try the Green Mussels and WOW!  Must get them!
Included is also mochi ice cream and the green tea one so GOOD!

The only downfall is the owner/ Mrs. tries to manage, serve, bus tables, cashier, etc and seemed a bit overwhelming for her at times... so sometimes the \"sushi\" would sit on the counter before she had a chance to bring to the table..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Everything I had was absolutely delicious and the chef kept recommending things I wouldn't normally have tried, so the fact that I still loved everything so much is really phenomenal! Best green muscles I've ever had in my life! Great oyster shooters, and their sauces have so much flavor I can't wait to go back!
 Update: I now come here at least once a week, and am addicted to the ugly roll and something wrong roll (which is weird because I used to think I didn't like soft shell crab until I had theirs)."}
{"text":"Great sushi bar great people and amazing food!  Got to go for the all you can eat sushi.  Try the Anna roll.  It's my favorite."}
{"text":"If only this place were on Long Island with me :(

When I was going to Las Vegas I was on yelp looking for some reasonable priced Sushi places not far from the strip. If you love Sushi and you don't want to be charged an arm and a leg for good taste and quality you *must* come here. You *will* come here..

The all you can eat sushi is not like some sweaty buffet - you tell them what you want and it is freshly made. Everything tasted delicious and clean. I must have ordered about 5 peices of Ikura on top of some fun rolls - I really got my money's worth for the all you can eat price. 

The server, Kelly is his name I believe? He was so helpful and cool. As a complete Sushi addict - I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to relax in a casual atmosphere and enjoy purely good sushi."}
{"text":"When it comes to all you can sushi quality this place is the best! You can really taste the difference in quality of the fish. The chefs are super cool, the young guy Jesse is awesome! Their only downfall is how long everything takes, don't go if your in a rush and I typically don't go with larger groups. To be fair it is because they take so much time and care in every roll but that's the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great food, service is bad (very slow). Came here twice. First time was slow but good food so we came back (good price for all u can eat). Second time was even slower. Took over 2 hours to complete the order. I'm sure it's their policy for all u can eat. :-/"}
{"text":"I came here again for the UYE the other night. I am glad I did. We had a huge table filled with people and sushi..and the sushi kept on coming out. I tried so many different rolls it was crazy. I have never eaten that much before. I was stuffed! Jesse did a great job as usual behind the counter. It was so nice to meet some new people and gorge on yummy food. I am so glad Nelson put the event together. It was fun. I am now a fan of oysters!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me here tonight, I had not been, so I was nervous lol I do that when he suggests places. Any way to my happy surprise it was sooooo good! We had all you can eat and sat at the sushi bar, which I actually liked because the sushi chef suggested many good rolls that we loved. My favorite was the Stacie roll, amazing and the ama emi was also fab!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrid service. Abysmal. We should have walked right on out. Instead, this happened.... Walked in the door and saw a lady cleaning a table in the front, she looked up at us and then continued about her business. Another lady walked by, she didn't address us either but one upped the other lady by pointing us to an empty booth. Words weren't exchanged. The first lady dropped off menus and took our drink order. More waiting then ensued. Placed our orders and the first of the food came quickly but the rest of the order very slowly. Maybe they were hoping that the wait would allow our stomachs to settle and we wouldn't want anymore? My last roll actually came a full 5 minutes after finishing up a previous roll. I ate it up and continued to wait for the server to  come back to place my second order. I had to flag a lady down who was sitting at the register. I explained that I wanted to place an order and she said that they assumed that I was done because I ordered a few rolls already. Hmmm. I thought this was all you can eat? The last order came out quickly only to be disappointed with even more waiting for any of the ladies that were working there to see if we needed anything or God forbid pay for the decent meal that was coupled with the worst service I've ever had. If I could find zero stars I definitely would. Instead, I have to settle on the fact that I had to write my first ever review because the service was atrocious."}
{"text":"i just don't like that the staff rolls in right at 11am and sometimes later! i am ready to sit and eat and spend my $$$ at 11am when your  supposed to open!!! otherwise very good!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Fast, Friendly, Flavorful!! 

we always seem to go in thinking that we'll only eat a sushi cut roll each so nah, no need to do AYCE! forgetting about all there yummy appetizers! our must haves every time we go there are the baby tako, oyster shooters, edamame(for the baby), shrimp tempura and Japanese lasagna (not an appetizer but a favorite for us)! lol! then we have our sushi rolls along with all that! 

oh man! i'm drooling just writing this review even though I was just there last night! lol!"}
{"text":"The place was really hot, the service wasn't good at all , and the sushi was horrible. Never again!"}
{"text":"What a great all you can eat sushi spot. The fish taste fresh and great service. Nice little spot for a casual evening out. The owner is very friendly, she is always attentive to our needs there. One of the best local spots in henderson, my wife and I go at least once a week."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their sushi is really good. There is a very big selection of AYCE sushi rolls. My boyfriend did the all you can eat and was extremely satisfied. I am on a special diet so I ordered the seafood salad with the garlic sauce on the side. Delicious and HUGE portion with lots of cut sashimi. Their staff is great too. They were all on top of everything and were polite and friendly which added to our experience.  Glad they opened in neighborhood. Definitely try this place out. We will definitely be returning ."}
{"text":"went in because of all the good reviews it got. we went in right before lunch pricing for AYCE ended, which was perfect. there was probably one other table in there besides us, but we didnt mind.

service was great! food was great! loved the oyster shooters and the hamachi lovers roll. some of the hot items werent a favorite, but the rolls were all really good. 

another part i liked about the AYCE - dessert is AYCE too! the other places we've gone to, you only get 1 dessert per person, which kind of defeats the purpose of AYCE.

if im ever in the area and craving the favorite items i listed, im sure i'll be back!"}
{"text":"AYCE sushi.
Pretty decent selection of sushi to choose from.
Rolls came pretty quick after ordering.

This is where the problems begin.
Just skip trying to tell to the ladies running the front.
Grab a pile of the order slips by the register and mark down a few things for everyone at the table, and then after you wave that in the air to get them to pick it up.
Start on the second slip, and add as you decide what you want, then give it to them when they bring your first order, rinse and repeat.

This is my second favorite ayce place"}
{"text":"Sushi is out of sight. I will always be back. The choices and the skill of the chef is like no other. Great for family and friends or just solo. Will be back."}
{"text":"We heard about this place through Yelp and we were not disappointed. We had come out to Vegas for the Kings preseason game and our group had a craving for Sushi. Saw a lot of mixed reviews about the sushi joints in the casinos so we gave Sin City Sushi a try. 

This place is fantastic!! By far the best AYCE sushi I have had. The Vampire roll is insanely good (I think they must put crack in the garlic sauce). The hamachi was really fresh, scallops were great, and the chef talked us into getting the baby octopus salad: its was amazing as well. 

Sin City Sushi also has a great list of appetizers and other dishes that come with the AYCE price. I am a HUGE fan of soft shell crab and I ordered plenty for myself. The baked green muscles were very tasty as well. 

My wife and I plan on making this a regular stop now when we go to Vegas. I just wish we went more often."}
{"text":"I love the Jamie roll. The chefs are always friendly and always offer to get things that they think I might like. Which I usually do. Maybe once have I not like something they offered me dozens of times. 

I always suggest this place to people asking where another sushi place they haven't tried would be."}
{"text":"What happened?  I was so looking forward to trying this place.  Ever since it moved from Eastern and Serene in Henderson to Pebble and Maryland, i was hankering to try this place.

I am not sure what happened...

1. Service - On a windy Friday and the sushi bar was 80% full but the tables were mostly open.  Greeted right away, seated and given great service!  Menus, water, drinks and etc were quickly arranged.

2.  Ordering - Also great, attentive adn giving a lot of explanations.  2 of were going for AYCE and two were for the bento box style combinations.

3.  Food - The bento boxes were a bit, not bento like.  For some reason, i was just expecting the lacquer type boxes with sections for all the tasty goodness of beef,  rice, salad, California rolls, and your veggies and what nots all raring to go.  Instead the food was served on plates and separately.  The miso, then salad, then the roll, then the tempura, then the rice plate with a bit of the beef... Very strange but oh well.  I would say, everything lacked in presentation, but the taste was not a problem.

4.  AYCE - all the standards and a bit more unique ones.  I don't think it is necessary to go over each roll, as this is your standard menu. We had rolls and nigiri.

a. The Ebi - A bit rubbery.
b. The Scallops - Nice
c. The Uni - good, but small.
d. The Amai Ebi - good and the fried heads were good.
e. Scallops, Uni, Maguro, Hamachi, Albacore - all good.
f. The rolls, not bad, just a lot of \"stuff\" on these as normal.
g.  I also liked that overall there were not too much rice in the nigiri

5.  Service while eating - what happened?  After our first order was put in, we got the sushi after about 15 minutes after the bento boxes were delivered, so we really did not \"eat\" together.  The AYCE sushi came out very slow. It seemed to take forever.

Then, when we wanted to reorder, that took a very long time. I was getting a bit irritated.  We also had to ask for ginger and wasabi and also ask for our own chopsticks.

5.  Overall, I give the food about a 3 - 4. However, ambiance was very bare and the service after the initial seating continued to decline throughout the meal.

GK says, check it out, but order your AYCE quick because if you dabble, the reorder can take quite a long time!

GK says, check it out, however, Sushimon and others, you won't have anything to worry about."}
{"text":"Go for it!

As you may know, I end up going to alot of these all you can eat because many people like it. I am a traditionalist nigiri sushi lover, yet this place is pretty darn good.

1.  Parking - Strip Mall so no issue.
2.  Service - Very casual, almost family like, so pretty good, just casual is all.  Friendly.
3.  Ambiance - kinda odd, but well, okay. Big booths and odd use of space. Furniture a bit worn out, but who gives a hoot, when  you are wearing flip flops, shorts and t-shirt.  Come on!
4.  Food - very nice American style \"Kitchen Sink\" sushi.  They have all the big rolls, the regular stuff, soup, salad, edamame and etc.  You cannot go wrong at all.  Price wise, a tad bit expensive, but they have reduced price for kids, so that is really cool.
5.  Go Back factor - I will, when I am near and in area, however, it is not a top priority.  This will be a convenience place for me to go to, 

GK says check it out."}
{"text":"When it comes to AYCE, we've always been going to Sushi-Mon if we're looking to stay on our side of town but this time, we wanted to try a new place out and came across Sin City Sushi based on the reviews.

Walked in, saw a sushi chef that I previously worked with on the sushi line so we decided to sit at the sushi bar. Sat down then realized that we would rather sit back at a table since the sushi bar table was awkwardly low. To sit there, I would probably have to yell my orders to my friend since the height gap between him and I were extremely long. You're not even in eye contact with the sushi chefs. You would constantly have to look up. Uncomfortable.

My boyfriend and I aren't rolls eaters so we tend to stick with nigiris and side orders. It was about 12pm with about several tables and the service was REALLY SLOW. I cut the waitress some slack since she was the only one on the floor until she would suddenly disappear at times and personally answer her cell phone with food from the kitchen on her other hand. Unsanitary! It was as if she wasn't trying. She was going to keep at her own pace and that's that.

We came to this place very hungry, having to knock out our order with a long list to start. Nigiris shouldn't take more than ten minutes to arrive. It just shouldn't. I've been to a number of AYCE joints (usually all being a full house) and the average wait time for nigiris would be around five minutes tops for a single type of fish. Dug in and was disappoint at the first bite. We've never tasted nigiri so bland before.

Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with the fish there. It's just how they prepare the sushi rice is what got me. You're suppose to taste a hint of rice vinegar since that's the key ingredient to keep the moisture of the rice together but instead, it was bland like a side of room temperature steamed rice box from a mom and pop Chinese restaurant.

So we thought maybe a roll would be better. Ordered a couple and was told that they don't do half-orders. (What?!) Told her it was fine to keep them whole in hopes that they'll make up for the orders of nigiri. Rolls came out (15 minutes later) and it was bleh. I think this was the first time we've never finished everything on the table and was NOT charged for the leftovers since she probably guessed that we were over it midway through our meal.

If you're a sushi feen, this place is not for you. I don't think they experience a lot of table turnovers to keep rotating the freshness/quality of the fish/rice around. The restaurant could use a makeover too since it wasn't inviting when we walked in. Overall, this place has a lot to work on. I would rather not have sushi for an entire year than to eat here if this was the last sushi restaurant on the planet."}
{"text":"It's the best sushi around. Everything is delicious here. Everyone with whom I've gone confirms this. The service is consistently pretty fast. The young servers are always warm, chipper, and attentive with great attitudes. And there's never a wait to be seated. [Update: I went during prime dinner time on a Saturday, and the wait was about 10 minutes (they estimated 20 min, but over-delivered.)]
They've got things that other sushi places don't. E.g. oyster shooters (for lunch too!), salmon kama, and delicious lychee ice cream.
I come here on average once a week. Sometimes 3 times a week. I may have a problem.
AYCE lunch is $22.95, AYCE dinner is $26.95."}
{"text":"I have traveled to Japan over 40 times, my daughter is half Japanese and lives there. Sin City Sushi is by far the best I have ever had. Poncho is an amazing sushi chef. I highly recommend you visit this restaurant and enjoy some of their amazing creations. Tonight poncho created one just for me and named it The Crazy Sean. I feel honored but more over I loved it so flipping much!"}
{"text":"The sushi was ok. My friend and I noticed the fish was gray on one of the rolls. We didn't mention it to eachother till we left. I don't think we will be going back there. They need to fix up the place. It's so blahh... you will know what I mean when you get there. Lol"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this out since it's been hyped up by my Elite buddies. Apparently, my boyfriend beat us all to it and found this place when it first opened with his buddy who lives nearby and kept telling me that \"when we're over there we got to go\". Yeah, we're almost never in Henderson so fast forward a few years and I finally got here. I'm in Los Angeles more often than I am across town. 

They said their grill was down, but hey I wasn't here for hot food so we sat happily to AYCE and stuck with raw or fried. 

The BF and I started off with:

Hamachi- it's good quality and fresh. 
Albacore- most people put a bit of green onion and ponzu, but this is the first that I had a drop of hot sauce on it. It's pretty good that way.
Kasia Roll (soft shell crab with yum yum sauce roll topped with albacore, salmon, avocado, ponzu)- pretty good. I'm not a roll person usually because I find they're uninspired or not balanced. This has an interesting balance of crunchy, creamy and soft textures and flavors from spicy to tangy. 
Soft Shell Crab- noms. a little lemon and ponzu set it off. 
Seaweed salad- it's standard like anyplace. Just a good palette cleanser.

We then thought lets ask for a chef surprise. 

He made us a vampire roll (similar to kasia but topped more simply with albacore), and stacy roll (tempura roll with shredded krab, masago, yum yum and eel sauce with some crunchies) because it's their top 2 rolls. Vampire is good because we already liked the kasia. I haven't had a roll that I've enjoyed in a while though I keep trying rolls at places. Stacy was pretty good considering I'm not a krab sushi kind of person. The two sauces and the crunchies are what sets it off. 

I then go off and order us some No Name Handrolls (fried squid chopped up, masago, chopped tuna, sesame, eel sauce). He recommended a bit of soy sauce on it to enhance the tuna. This was quite nice and again, I was appreciating that they're doing different things. I like that the squid was fresh and soft- not chewy at all so that the BF can eat it too (he has braces). 

I was feeling adventurous and asked if he can make me a piece of uni because I don't know if I like it.  I hear \"its sweet\" all the time and what I tasted the one time I had it was like sea ass- very briny and iodine tasting. He said he wants me to try it when he has fresh good ones since they are down to the bottom of the uni. 

He then asks if I like oysters and proceeded to make oyster shooters. I normally shy away from oyster shooters because at most places it's made to be like some inside fucked up joke with whats in it. Here it's oysters, a bit of sauce and hot sauce. That's it. Just sweet oysters and a little bit of sauce to flavor it. It's not like most where it's also with some raw quail egg, sake, wasabi, hot sauce, etc. etc. I can get behind this kind of shooter.

I then noticed baby tako on a menu. I thought it'll be like little whole ones with a dipping sauce, but it was a nice surprised that it was the Japanese octopus salad I love so much- Tako no sunomono. Theirs has a nice smokey flavor to the tako, a bit of chili slices and the sweet vinegar sesame marinate ties it all in. I also grabbed the ika tempura since the no name roll had some nice fried ika in it and it was quite nice. 

BF starts tapping out so I grab some saba (this was just ok in freshness), and a salmon skin handroll. I like that their salmon skin has the usual components of skin, gobo, cucumber, sprouts and theirs also adds takuan (picked yellow daikon) and a light drizzle of eel sauce. 

Now here is the rub- food came out a bit slow. We were there from 4:30 to a bit past 6. I normally wouldn't complain but I was hungry, yet had someplace to be heading to before they closed at 7pm and there was only a 1 top, two 2 top and a 4 top between two chefs.  Nigiri rice was nice and sweet, but rice to fish ratio wasn't as proportional as some of my favorite spots. Slightly a bit more than ideal. 

It seems the favorite is Jesse who wasn't working so next time I come back I'll try to come in when he is here. It seems that was also the chef my BF had which he said was very good service. 

So far it's a positive experience but not quite 5 stars. I at least gives hats off to some creativity to the rolls and the food was overall fresh."}
{"text":"I thought I lost them. They used to be on Eastern and Serene. This new spot is much nicer. They still have the freshest sushi in town. This is my favorite place."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb. Definitely the best sushi I've had in vegas, and potentially ever. 

I couldn't believe how quickly they got all the sushi out with so many people there for the all you can eat deal and only three guys making sushi. It was so fresh and delicious. Decently priced even if you don't go with all you can eat.

And the servers were really friendly and on top of things. 

I'd recommend this place to everyone!

I was a little worried after reading some of the negative reviews, but after going there, I have nothing negative to say about the place."}
{"text":"Hands down, my BEST AYCE sushi experience I've had in Las Vegas! Everything my fiance and I had was GOOOD!  We had edamame, gyoza, and 4 oyster shooters from the none sushi menu.  You can order mussels and a buncha other stuff like miso soup/udon, teri beef/chicken.  For sushi we had the Stacy roll, vampire, wet dream, nigiri yellowtail (generous portion of sashimi!), scallop handroll, salmon skin hand roll and finished it off with fried bananas with vanilla ice cream.  We will definitely be back and bring our out of town guests here."}
{"text":"Tasty sushi for a decently cheap price! Unless you know for a fact that you are going to eat more than four plates, then I recommend eating ala carte instead of AYCE. The Japanese lasagna and paradise rolls are my go-to sushi rolls. Another recommendation is the Stacey roll!"}
{"text":"I go to a lot of sushi places, and this place is consistently on point with their sushi. Parking is never hard to find and the prices are the same as other AYCE sushi places, around $22. It took me awhile to learn my limit on sushi, but after going to sushi ten times a month with my sushi-holic friend I learned that five to six rolls, three orders of shrimp tempura, mochi ice cream, and one more roll after that makes  my stomach the most happiest stomach in zee world. 

My staples here are three stacie rolls and two lasagna rolls. Their stacie rolls is always freaking perfect to my mouth. If they could my taste buds would marry the stacie rolls. It has the perfect amount of crunch and the perfect of amount of soft yummy-ness. It always sets the mood right for  a night of ayce sushi eating fun. The lasagna roll is no exception too. IF my taste buds did marry the stacie rolls the lasagna rolls would be that ex-girlfriend trying to win my taste buds back. All you have to do is put it in your mouth and let the rolls do the work. It freaking melts in my mouuuuthhh and as soon as it melts and you think it's over...a explosion of delicious gooey-ness happens and a mouth orgasm beings to happen. 

Anyways I go there enough that the sushi chef knows my name and if I do have anymore room in my stomach he lets me try some rolls that are new.

Although the place is small, the service is always top notch. A must go if you are around the area."}
{"text":"This was definitely one of the best place for sushi! (no lies). I live in LA and sushi is so expensive. To be able to get an all you can eat sushi for only $25 is beyond amazing. I was able to get yummy appetizers (love their baby octopus), all you was able to eat sushi rolls, AND green tea mochi at the end was LOVE. It was sooo good that it made me want to write a review on yelp for the first time :) plus the service was great! the servers were really nice."}
{"text":"ALL TIME FAVORITE SUSHI PLACE!! Whether you want to do AYCE or Ala Carte, this place is AMAZING!! Their green mussels here are the BEST(there is no one that makes them like this)!!!
I Highly recommend the No Name Hand Roll as well. In all honesty.... there isn't a better Sushi spot in all of Las Vegas. The fish is Always Fresh"}
{"text":"We went back here again during our Vegas trip. This time we went during the dinner hour. I'm really happy to see that every time we go back, the place seems to be more and more busy.

The food is still really yummy. The vampire and wet dream are still delicious. I love the variety of rolls they have here! :)"}
{"text":"I have never experienced anything like this before in my life. Putting this experience into words will be difficult but I will try.

This was the most awful sushi experience that I've ever had. I was in a party of six people and our food was just not coming out. We waited a full hour before getting any rolls. Then they kept bringing us rolls that we did not order and it appeared that this was happening to several other tables in the establishment. 

While this was occurring, two men were at the bar purchasing shots for the chefs. The chefs took three shots in the one hour that it took to get any rolls, their inebriated state probably explaining the complete mess. The servers did not know what we had coming to us as they kept asking us if we ordered anything else. Shouldn't they know what we ordered? We also had to ask repeatedly for drink refills and for mussels. Tables that sat down after us were served before us; the servers had no idea what was going on and the chefs were drunk.

The taste of the food was horrible; everything was loaded with cream of some sort. Our rolls were half cream cheese and all of them were covered with some type of mayo based sauce. Now I enjoy cream cheese in my sushi, and yum yum sauce, but this was overkill. I ended up sending back a whole roll without eating it because I was getting sick. One of my rolls was swimming in cream sauce and literally had cubes of cream cheese sitting on top. My friend's hand roll was filled with scallops and dripping with cream sauce. 

Finally, without being able to handle any more, we asked for our check. We did not finish the hand roll or the roll described above. The server had the audacity to tell us \"uh oh, you have some leftovers.\" I explained to him that the food was disgusting, the service was awful, we waited an hour for food and we received rolls we did not order. I will pay for the all you can eat and my iced tea and that was it. He said the decision wasn't up to him and left. He came with the bill and had put a left over charge on it. I explained that they were lucky to get paid at all, as we didn't receive our correct order and barely ate any of it. The commotion caught the attention of the manager who came over and apologized. 

The server went to fix our bill and came back, charging us for six AYCE when we only ordered 4 (2 members of our party ordered a la cart). We finally were able to pay for what we ordered and left.

The unprofessional nature and audacity of this establishment is appalling and I will never return."}
{"text":"I love sin city i went there because it is close to my house but ended up loving it! 
Get the lion roll its great and add jalapeno if you like spicy rolls
stacy roll is also great so is poncho and misty
the best desert is ther fried bananas 
Good food, friendly good service and good prices :)"}
{"text":"Nice Sushi place... but just nice -_- I understand that when you do ayce u expect a little more than normal rice, but this was insane! Ive never had that much rice on rolls. Most likely will not be returning."}
{"text":"I have to admit I have been going to this spot for quite some time and the quality has gone down."}
{"text":"Another Sin City fanboy here - So glad they reopened! I have been following Yung around since the Sapporo Sushi days, around 15 years ago! I was so bummed out when they closed their Eastern location, then super excited to see that they had reopened close by! If anything, their nigiri quality seems to have improved! 

Went in last night and they were slammed. Full tables and we got the last two seats at the bar. I always sit at the bar and will admit, yes their two servers that wait on the tables are not that great, but who goes to a sushi bar and gets a table anyways? They are two middle aged Asian women that don't speak great English, but they are never rude. They try their best I guess. Behind the bar is Yung the owner, Jimbo, and Pancho. Don't know if Jessie is still with them. Yung is always super friendly and pushes you to eat as much as you possibly can, even though it's costing him money! They were having a hard time keeping up with orders last night, even though all three were slicing and dicing as quickly as they could.

My favorites have always been - the baby tako and the double seared roll. Their garlic sauce is good, but I think they overdo it a little with the yum/creamy sauce sometimes. Their rice is fresh and has a touch of vinegar to it which is how it should be and helps give it a tiny briny taste. The nigiri was solid with huge, fresh, and creamy portions. This place is right near my place - so excited to see them reopened. This place is in a different league than the dozen other sushi places up and down Eastern. Yung I wish you and your crew the best of luck in your new location!"}
{"text":"We will not return to this place , a friend recommended it so we tried it. There were 4 of us. If you are doing all u can eat , I suggest ordering a few rolls at a time if not u will wait 20 mins to get ur next roll. People are rude and they all drag there feet when they walk!!!"}

10. Sin City roll
11. Lychee ice cream, 1 order*
12. Fried banana with vanilla ice cream, 1 order*
for $66 (*limit one per person, **limit 2 per person)

- Sat in right away. Bar was open around 7pm. no one there at bar. Booths full. Chef of our own!  
- Great soft-shell crab. less tempura, better and more soft-shell. 
- Ordinary nigiri. 
- Excellent Salmon skin. Crispy. Best AYCE by far in Vegas. Lots of avocado. 
- Nice presentation for oyster shooter. Tangy. 
-  Their special rolls collectively have a bit too much sauce for my liking, but overall, good. Sin City roll is a definite must-try. It's the name of their restaurant for tarnation! haha. 
- Green mussels taste like it's from a Chinese buffet. 
- Must get Salmon Kama! 
- Poor Ice cream selection. Fried banana fail. Don't get it. Lychee ice cream had some lychee jelly pieces inside that were very satisfying. 
- Great price!  Friendly service."}
{"text":"Will not return. What they lack in customer service is not made up for in food.  I went in a party of 5. Every person at the table received everything that they ordered off the menu before my husband and I received one roll and The fish was warm. 
We canceled the rest of our order and left full of soda and ice tea and still had to pay the $26 per person.  
Was not happy."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave them a 3 was they addressed the issue, but with arguments. The food was good. I ordered vegetable sushi  and pointed it out on the menu for takeout.  When I got home,  it was \"krab\" sushi.  I  returned.  asked for my original order. The hostess,  in very broken English,  said I ordered the \"krab\". No. I did not.  I emphasized my statement for vegetable sushi  and that I pointed to it on the menu.  She arranged for a replacement.  We won't go here again."}
{"text":"Went here couple years ago and wasn't impressed. Gave them a second chance recently and still wasn't. The wait staff are polite. Very polite. The food is decent, not amazing, 7/10. I've had worse. The location kills it, pretty small, I wanted to bring a group from work,but unless we wanted to take up the entire counter, there wouldn't be a spot for us. Also, the chefs take way too long in making the food. It was pretty empty when I went, only 2 other tables, and it took nearly half an hour to make cold Nigiri. Lay down a finger size clump of rice and lay a piece of raw fish over the top. 30 mins really?? The chefs were just standing around chit-chatting and not focusing on serving us. I really hate that, hence 2 stars. Can't say enough how polite the wait staff was though, 10/10 for them~"}
{"text":"Baby taco, baked green mussels , stacy roll... Ohh my! So darn good. Friendly family owned and operated place, not fancy, but the food is amazing!!"}
{"text":"Okay it has been a long time since I had a visit to Sin city sushi. I stayed away from Vegas for over a year which is a record for me. I took a group of 13 with me to the visit for lunch.

1. I had called and booked a res for lunch to accommodate 16 people but 3 flaked at last minute.

2. When I arrived they had set up  a table for us which was nice.

3. The service was much better than my last visit (rated excellent), had the the ladies running around like crazy taking our appetizer orders.

4. The food was good as usual everyone loving the wet dream roll the most.

5. The sushi chefs were really nice when I asked them questions about the rolls.

Yes definitely going back again with a group when I need a sushi fix in Vegas.

Everyone was so nice to us...


Plus: they gave us separate checks and didn't charge a mandatory 18% for group. 

I give them props for a nice family business... I think the food, price and good service they gave us puts this restaurant as good as it gets for an all you can eat sushi bar in Vegas."}
{"text":"So many people talk about the competitors around Sin City, but most of them cannot even compare. The service was endearing and the food is delicious. I also appreciate the fact that when the uni was not up to standards they warned us, gave us a taste, and did not hold it against us when we did not like it either.

For starters; baby tako, soft shell crab, and baked green mussels are the way to go. As for rolls, many of them come heavily sauced. I am not the biggest fan of that, but the one's without kind of fell flat. They need to meet somewhere in the middle. The Ugly was tasty, but three different dressings and the amount was overkill. The Sapporo Crunch Roll was one that stuck out because of all the different kind of veggies. The generous amounts of avocado and less rice was much appreciated. Their hirame does not come with a ponzu or anything, so I could tell that it was fresh.

Now a days, I have turned into a senior citizen and eat dinner around 5. It was nice to meet some of my Yelpie friends here for a late dinner. Even though I did not eat as much as I would if we had met earlier, I still left feeling full without feeling like dying. We sat until almost closing and no one rushed us out. The restaurant looks like it is ran by a family and they definitely treat their guests well. I would make this a regular haunt."}
{"text":"Have you met Leo?  One of the best sushi chefs I met.  And he is from Guam. Great new spot, clean! The sushi is bomb. Hotate with calamansi is a winner. Leo even made a roll off the top of the dome and it was Ono.  Good spot for a date. Come sit at the bar with Leo, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"This is an updated review. Saturday 2-21-15 my niece & I returned to Sin City Sushi.  We arrived at about 630 and it was busy but few folks sat at the bar so of course we had to! We always get the AYCE option. 
And we had a great time!  Folks were friendly,  the chefs were happy and the sushi was excellent. We ordered the Orleans roll which has soft shell crab in it & has a crunchy internal texture.  The Sin City sushi roll and the Mario roll were very tasty.  I always have to have the baked muscles which are the best I've ever had and luscious. Niece had albacore,  ahi & salmon nigiri which were smooth,  meaty & so fresh!  Yes, we were there a while & paced ourselves,  bought our chef a Soporo and munched ourselves into sushi comas!  We will be back! ****note: If you choose table service you don't get 5 star service. The ladies are nice but without a sense of urgency. It's a family business."}
{"text":"This is my 4th review of Sin City Sushi. 1st 5 star rating. Everything was humming tonight. Fish was as usual, delicious. Chefs were happily busy and service was very good. We arrived just after 5 and by 6 the place was very busy yet, our Chef at the bar remained attentive & we had a great time. He even recognized us from our last visit! 
Overall, it is our go to sushi place and based on our experience of 2 yrs with Sin City Sushi, consistent quality of excellent fish, excellent chefs, welcoming atmosphere, we won't be going anywhere else for sushi."}
{"text":"Nice sushi place to stop by for a quick bite. Not fancy at all. Small staff and very friendly. Fish seems to be fresh the few times I've gone. The sushi rolls aren't sexually explicit but you might find some orgasm sauce on them. Overall this place is consistent and hits the spot."}
{"text":"Disappointed - after being seated the cart full of dishes right next to our table was never moved.  Was at the table for a while but was never approached by a server for a drink order or offered menus.  Watched as a couple instantly get menus after sitting at the bar.  Walked out after that."}
{"text":"I never write reviews but I really enjoyed this place. I don't really like going to AYCE sushi because I feel rushed and I really like to sit and enjoy my meal. I understand that it is a business and they can't have people sit for hours and I don't. But it makes me feel uncomfortable being forced to eat every single bite or they threaten to put it on your bill. (especially because I rarely eat enough and we usually rack up a large alcohol tab) This place was not like that at all. I took my daughter there for Thanksgiving we both enjoyed everything we ordered. Everything tasted fresh and it took some time to get our apps so I know it wasn't sitting around. Plus no rush whatsoever. The owner was even pushing us to eat more after we were already full. He was suggesting rolls he thought we would like based on the rolls we had ordered. Usually they want you out! He was so so nice to us and we were sitting at a table not the sushi bar. The service was good and they never looked at us funny when we didn't eat every morsel. The atmosphere in my opinion is not bad at all, I liked it. It didn't seem like we were in the Walmart shopping plaza. This is my favorite sushi place. second is Yama sushi. I have also been to the sushi place across the street Island Sushi did not like it and very funky atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best SUSHI in Vegas!!!!  My favorite rolls are the Moon Roll, Stacy and the No Name Hand Roll.  This place used to be called Saporro's in Henderson.  They have another location called Kai Sushi off Flamingo and Durango.  You will not be disappointed!!!  Yum yum yum."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. 1 waitress for 7 tables plus 6 people at sushi bar. Food is kinda meh but for the price they charged not worth it. I wouldn't recommend this place to my friends or anyone else."}
{"text":"My husband and I have eaten here three times - the first is what brought us back and the food and service was great.  The second time we ate with another couple and we are all very patient customers until the service took forever and we noticed many of our items were not coming (we did all you can eat).  After you asked for something that hasn't come to the table be prepared for the servers to snob you the rest of the time you are there and pretty much throw the food on your table. We thought this was an isolated incident and maybe it was just a rough day for them - it was lunch time and kind of busy.  

It was our third and FINAL time eating here yesterday and what should have been no more than a 45 minute dinner turned into well over and hour and a half.  There were only 4 tables being served - one table of 6 adults.  Seemed like an average dinner time - so tell me why my husband had to get up to ask to be able to order more (all you can eat) and he had to stand up again to inquire about the orders that weren't coming.  After that -- HIS water was refilled and mine was left a third full, no smiles no words to ask how everything is going, no apologies for the HORRIBLE service, and again the food was just being dumped on our table.  

If you dine here just hope you're the only table and that they're in a much better mood than usual."}
{"text":"New location, same menu, same awesome sushi chefs, same unendurable service in the dining area. Come here for the sushi and sit at the sushi bar where you'll get taken care of and you won't have to deal with any of the service issues we've had to deal with. The sushi is good enough where I'm not waving the white flag yet, but they're sitting on an 0-2 count in the bottom of the ninth.

I can't chalk it up to coincidence that I've received bad service in the dining area two times in a row. Recent reviews also support that it's not an accident (8 of 17 most recent reviews are 2-star and under). Unfortunately, sitting at the bar is not an option when I have my family so I have to deal with the servers that walk with their heads down and won't even make eye contact with you like they've committed some shameful act. And if they do happen to bring their eyes to your table, they won't notice any empty plates, empty glasses, or that there is no food in front of the customer. I ordered four times during my AYCE meal and each time I had to physically wave and verbally call the servers each time for the next order which should never have to be done if the servers are attentive and aware. Estimating from time stamps from my first pictures and our receipt, we were there for two hours which is unacceptable for a restaurant that was nowhere near capacity (see picture) after the dinner rush.

From ten years working in the industry, I'm one of the most forgiving diners when it comes to service and sympathetic to a server/bartender that's weeded because the restaurant is too busy and is understaffed. But this has not been the case. The ship is carrying some dead weight that needs to be thrown overboard.

As said before, the sushi has stayed consistent. For appetizers, the oyster shooters, baby tako, and soft shell crab are standard for me. There are generous portions with the dinner specials at an affordable price. I'll only be back if I happen to be in the area and if I know I'll be sitting in the sushi bar for sure. There are literally a handful of other options within a 3 mile radius."}
{"text":"I usually stop in here every two or three months for AYCE and I can usually count on everything being solid. This visit missed with the service. I had the family with me and sat at a table instead of at the bar where I usually sit when I'm with my buddies. We came in at 8 on a Friday night and were able to sit immediately. The restaurant was at full capacity after we sat.

My wife and daughter loved their teriyaki chicken combo boxes. The combo actually comes with half a Stacie roll instead of the typical California roll. I had my usual nigiri lineup with a couple of hand rolls and a Japanese lasagna roll. No problems or issues with the sushi, it was as good as it usually is.

Some things that I like about Sin City are the cucumber salad has crab meat or fish topping the salad, the oyster shooters, the soft shell crab, and the mussels.

The service was pretty bad. We were there for two hours spending most of the time waiting and not eating. My daughter actually fell asleep at the table because she was tired of waiting. There were three servers working the floor. Two older women and a younger woman. I wouldn't be surprised if the younger server suffered a back injury after that night because she was carrying the other two women piggy back style all night. She was working hard and I felt bad for her, but when she has to cover for the other two, the customers really suffer. One of the older servers was spending most of the time caring for the patrons at the sushi bar and busing tables, the other one was MIA for twenty minutes at time leaving the younger server hanging out to dry.

I'll continue to make my regular visits here, but hopefully all the servers will have their work boots on."}
{"text":"Horrible service
The old lady that rings up is a thief. When brought to attention she refuses to listen and starts yelling at you in another language. Horrible customer service, will not  be returning."}
{"text":"Excellent Sushi. I go here pretty regularly AYCE is a great price and decent size menu. Vampire roll is a must! OH! And the green muscles!!"}
{"text":"Not bad, didn't knock my socks off.  When we got there I only saw about  6 people sitting up at the sushi bar {& 3 sushi chefs behind the counter}. After we ordered our first couple of rolls {it's all you can eat} they place got slamming busy. It's not that big and I counted like 35 people in there. Looked to me like a lot of 'regulars' go here, b/c it appeared that some of the sushi chefs had relationships w/ their patrons.  They have like 3 difft kinds of beer and like 3 difft kinds of sake not a large selection and nothing that got me excited.

Sushi wasn't bad you can't order sashimi so you have to eat your rice, which is something they stress with signs all over the place. I hate being told what I need to eat and don't eat, if I don't like it I'm not going to force feed myself so I can finish my rice. PS I don't eat that much rice and when I do it's typically not white rice, I did not see the option to change your white rice out to brown rice either which I typically do.  They rolls are good size though not too big just right to pop a piece in your mouth and not have a hard time chewing it.

I didn't have any particular roll that I was overwhelmed with amazement on, there's some really good ones at I Love Sushi, anyhow it's good enough. I don't know if I'm going to run back there anytime soon but if you are close by and you have a sushi craving it will suffice."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, I don't eat sushi. So, this is kind of an odd place for me to review. That being said, I came here with 4 of my friends and enjoyed my dinner. I ordered the Teriyaki Chicken and it was delicious. Not the best I've had, but far from the worst. There were, however, not many choices for those of us who don't eat sushi, but how can I complain when the name of the restaurant is sin city SUSHI?

As far as the sushi goes: Two of my friends really seemed to enjoy their sushi, but the other two said that although it was okay, they probably wouldn't return. 

The prices seemed fair, and our the service was good. The manager even checked on a couple of rolls my friends had ordered when they seemed to be taking slightly longer than the others.

Overall, good, but not the best."}
{"text":"I rarely review places to eat unless it's amazing or terrible. Sadly, this was a TERRIBLE spot. The service is hands down the worst in Las Vegas. Food was mediocre and the environment was laughable. 

Our waiter couldn't speak English, didn't understand English, and simply made our experience unbearable. 90% of the time our waitress was actually on her phone and ignored our request for service. She was very short when we asked her questions about the menu items, looked annoyed when we did order anything, and it seemed like she would toss our food in front of us when she \"served\" it. I tend to give people credit, especially since I've worked in the service industry, but I couldn't ignore such God awful service. 

The food was edible. That's all I could really say about it. We paid for AYCE and in all honesty, 50% of the food looked disgusting.

Now what definitely put this place at the bottom of the garbage heap is the actual environment. The booths look like they were recycled from the restaurant that vacated this location previously. There's a random office cubicle near the kitchen and bathroom. And there's shipping boxes stacked up all around the restaurant. 

If you're one of those people who just read the conclusion, READ THIS: AVOID THIS RESTAURANT AT EVERY COST. You'll be disappointed by the food, angered by the service, and questioning why this sushi place hasn't folded yet."}
{"text":"I have Raved about Sin City Sushi in the past and told everyone that they need to try it.......Well after 2 visits is the last 2 weeks unfortunately.............................You have to here me recommend this place some more, Come on you didn't really think I was going to say it was bad did you? This place has been nothing but consistent every time we have been there. The only change we have found lately is that it is getting pretty busy. But I would rather it be busy and have to wait a few to eat and the place stay in business. '

The wait staff is always very very good about giving good service, and I totally understand waiting for a little while for service when the place has every table full of people enjoying the most delicious sushi around. These guys are always coming by and making sure that everything is good and asking if there is anything they can change to make the place better. Even when the server walks up to your table when you are mid conversation and all he hears is,\" My mom is coming to town so I am buying a gun\" he still asked it I wanted more water haha luckily enough we have been there enough for him to just ask what the hell we were talking about. 

This place has come through every time and We will continue to eat here until they either run out of fish or we move away because I do not see the  service or quality falling.."}
{"text":"Loved the sushi here!! My personal favorite is the Stacie roll. It's all you can eat and the prices are fairly reasonable. The chef and staff are friendly and attentive. Highly recommend this place if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is extremely mediocre. The prices are what drew me here because it seemed cheaper than other places in the are. It's certainly gives you the sushi fix you need. However the service was not great. Our waiter seemed to really push the All you can eat menu. After we explained to him we just wanted to look at the menu first and then decide, he continued to push it. Once he finally understood we were doing A LA cart he took our menus and gave us new ones claiming that they are different. They were the same. The environment in this place is not appealing and I did not feel welcomed. More than likely will not try this place again."}
{"text":"Food: we paid $3 more for the uni sushi and osyter shooter.  Keep in mind that each of us can only order ONCE for the uni and osyter.  The uni sushi only had \"ONE PIECE\" of uni on it that it barely can cover the rice.  Osyster shooters are in a small cup about the size of your finger.  The rolls and cooked food are okay.  All the sushi made with a THIN slice of raw fish and BIG piece of rice.  Couldnt even taste the fish at all when the rice is so big and fish are cut this thin!!! I know this is all-u-can eat, but quality like this is very unacceptable.  I'd rather pay a little bit more so I can have some REAL sushi!!!  

Service: Not so good service.  Average wait time for all the food to come is about 2-3 hours.  Bad bad bad service from the waitress.  Chiefs aint friendly either.  

I wish I can give a zero star to this sushi place."}
{"text":"Literally my favorite AYCE establishment in town for nigiri.

The fish is so delicate, fresh and flavorful it seems wrong to be able to order all you want.  And they have oysters - and don't limit you on them.  The rolls are not overbearing and are pretty small, good so that you can eat enough variety.  But the star at Sin City is truly the nigiri.  

My only gripe is the seafood salad, while good is made with iceberg lettuce.  That's pretty much it.

Otherwise, I am sad that every time I go here it doesn't seem to be nearly as crowded as any of the other over-hyped AYCE sushi places in town."}
{"text":"When we arrived there were only a few other people eating. After about 15 minutes, people just started coming through the door like crazy! I was pleasently surprised at how good their sushi rolls are, and the variety of them is quite extensive! My boyfriend and I sat at the sushi bar and Poncho was our bartender. He was fantastic. The location is a little hidden, and that worries me as far as business goes. But I think I've found my new favorite AYCE sushi!!!"}
{"text":"Wow oh wow. I came here for my birthday wanting to try something new. Reviews seemed ok. Unfortunately, a happy day turned sour when everyone around me is getting their food and I've waited 40 minutes after ordering. Very disappointed with this place. The service was just absolutely terrible. I was so frustrated by being ignored by wait staff as I was raising my hand for 3 minutes trying to get someone's attention. When mentioned that we had been waiting long, we got a shrug. I will not be going to this place again. Food was to mediocre for what I had to endure. Wish it was possible to give 0 stars. Thanks for a ruined birthday."}
{"text":"Just average sushi, nothing special. None of the rolls or any other dish really stood out flavor-wise. If you don't eat sushi much, you might like it. Service was sold though."}
{"text":"The wife and I have been waiting 8 months for Sin City to open, that's how much we love this place and the people! The sushi is fresh all the time and what makes even better are the people who prepare it for you. I recommend coming here anytime of the week and all start off with the Stacie roll, green muscles, and the Charlie hand roll they are THE BEST!!!!"}
{"text":"Friendliest sushi place in town. The sushi here is always fresh. Good size sushi rolls. My favorite is the Stacy roll. Very good selection for an AYCE. BEST Screaming O and Baby tako in town!! Keep in mind that this is a self seat restaurant so if you see somewhere you want to sit, go ahead and sit down."}
{"text":"I've enjoyed sushi all over the country from New York to San Francisco.  This is my favorite joint in the nation.  They have some very creative signature rolls and everything is included in the all-you-can eat so you can try everything you want.

If you go here you gotta try the Vampire!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is probably great if you want to get your AYCE fix. Other then that it's average at best. We could barely understand our waitress, they were out of both saki's we picked and we ordered ala carte. The food was good, but again average at best."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Went on Saturday night and the place was packed. We sat at the sushi bar and watched rolls being made as we waited for our food. Jesse, our sushi chef, chatted with us and introduced us to some regulars. We never really had to wait too long since Jesse could see when we had finished one roll and would promply make another. We were there for around 2 hours and left FULL! We ordered 10 or 11 rolls and a few pieces of nigiri between 2 of us and felt we got our moneys worth. Everything tasted great and was really fresh. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is very spacious and will look amazing once they get a little more decorations set up. The sushi is good, can't say anything stands out but it fits the bill. Rolls are mediocre, handrolls are where they shine.  As other reviewers have mentioned though, service is suuuuppppperrrr slow. For the time I was there there were only 6 people in the restaurant and it took forever to get things. I will say that I do like the owner and the chefs of the place so I hope they succeed but they still need to work out some kinks and speed things up. But all in all a legit sushi spot."}
{"text":"When I heard this place opened up again. I immediately came down here to try my favorite rolls . The drum roll and the happy roll. Place is bigger and just has a nicer vibe. Better than a lot  of sushi places I've been to."}
{"text":"After hearing great things about sin city sushi we had to give it a try. I'm quickly becoming a sushi fanatic so i had to give this place a try. First impression, super small place and of course we got there on a Friday night @ 730 and was told it would be about a 15-20 min wait but it ended up being 40 mins and the bar top is not first come first serve. I have to say I've never waited that long for sushi but i was eager to try it and see if it lived up to its name. They do offer a handful of special rolls for the day that are on the ayce list. The Ugly roll was a special roll and i hope it stays cuz its to die for! I think it's the best roll I've tasted anywhere. We also had the vampire roll that is a must order too. The mussels are a contender to Yama sushi mussels, juicy and flavorful. My standard orders are a cucumber salad which wasn't impressive unfortunately, it was small and not too flavorful. The edamame was good, hot n salty. My fiance ordered the beef curry but wasn't impressed. I had ordered two rolls myself
that came to the table 20 mins after my finances order (ugly roll, vampire roll and beef curry) even tho we placed the order all at the same time. So that was kinda upsetting being that I helped myself to his rolls and was full by the time mine came out. I ordered the girlfriend roll which was also a special, good but not as good as the ugly roll. They only offer half rolls on your last order which stinks b/c I like variety and half orders allow that w/o ordering too much. Overall a must try for all sushi lovers!"}
{"text":"I found this place by accident and I have a new favorite place! The sushi chefs are fun and the fish was so fresh. Tasty rolls and a clean spot."}
{"text":"For people that only appreciate only the finest all you can eat sushi & an extra special all-la-carte menu try sin city! It's not your average place, you will leave addicted and wanting more"}
{"text":"Unfortunately the terrible service outweighed the food tonight.  The older Asian lady with the resting bitch face is going to take this place down. I believe she is one of the owners or a wife, anyhow, the food, as always is amazing. The sushi chefs are fabulous, but when this woman is here, the atmosphere is bad. Even at the old location it was the same. The staff is intimidated of her and she is just straight out rude. So sad that this happens at what should be a great place. 
The only reason for the 2 stars is for the food. Please, keep this woman out of the resturaunt! 
Advice. ..if you go in and see her, turn around, her attitude will make you loose your appetite."}
{"text":"This place was the reason why I completely fell in love with sushi and baked mussels five years ago! I was completely sad that they closed down for a bit because this place brings back so many memories with friends and their service is always awesome. 

Their baked green mussels are the best of the best and this is probably the only place where I would order rolls. Since I haven't been to Sin City in awhile... The wet dream, kasia, drum roll, the Stacy, and the Japanese lasagna was just as I remembered it to be. The best rolls hands down. If you love garlic flavored sauce, kasia and drum roll is the roll for you! Completely melts in your mouth. The Stacy is amazing as well because of the crunchy flakes all around the sushi. You can definitely tell that the quality of the fish is fresh. Oh and as appetizer, don't forget to order the baked green mussels and baby tako! Really flavorful, fresh, and very juicy. Definitely love the sauce that goes with them. 

Very happy that they reopened the sushi place again. It's a bigger venue so it's more open compared to their other location. Their service was always good. Since the owners work there with their daughter and son, it gives you such a homey feel to their restaurant. I'll be back here again very soon!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I saw all these reviews on yelp and thought it was something I can go to often and have some great sushi. I am sad to say I was a little disappointed.

The service was fantastic and their decor is a nice. I walked in and sat at the sushi bar. I was immediately given wasabi and ginger. The sushi chef informed me that their stacy roll was their most popular roll. I ordered what the chef suggested along with baby tako, 2 orders of yellowtail and 2 orders of salmon, tiger roll, Kasia roll, and their baked green mussels. 

The baby tako was definitely my favorite out of everything I ordered. Their stacy roll was ok, nothing amazing. Their baked green mussels were definitely better than a lot of places I have tried. What disappointed me, was their sushi. 

Their fish is not as fresh as some of the other places I have tried. Their sushi rice, sorry to say, was awful. The sushi rice was so sweet it almost tasted like candied rice. It was a little gummy as well, a sign of over mixing the rice. Sushi rice is supposed to have some texture to it, a firmness and a subtle but not overpowering sweetness. I was taken aback by all the amazing reviews this place has and everyone seems to like it, however, this rice can't be overlooked, as any sushi place should have amazing sushi rice, regardless if its a AYCE place or Okada. It is just unacceptable to have bad sushi rice. 

I can't see myself coming back here, unfortunately. Their rice is something I can't overlook. I can't go back because of that sushi rice. Their fish is not the best as everyone claims. It is just ok. I have had better at many other places. Yama sushi and Sushi mon both have better fish than this place and their rice never tastes gummy or overly sweet. 

If you do happen to go regardless, try their tempura banana with their vanilla ice cream. That was great! The 3 stars go for the friendly service, and some of the appetizers and their dessert. I can't give many props for their fish nor their rolls. They were not amazing by any means. I was expecting better, especially from a place who is given 5 star reviews."}
{"text":"A good quality and good service sushi joint. Small place with great sushi flavors. We have ate sushi from many different sushi places but Sin City Sushi is our favorite AYCE sushi (All you can eat) now! A must try sushi packed with flavor is the Vampire roll. There are many choices of sushi and food to be cooked but I couldnt get enough of the Unagi (eel) roll and the Vampire roll only. Also the poke and salmon collar was great as well. Lunch 22.95 Dinner 25.95. A sushi place to try out."}
{"text":"Well, I have to say I would have never stopped in if it wasn't for yelp! This place is great. Got the all you can eat and just said \"feed me\", and feed me they did. I love that I didnt have to go through the menu and pick what I think I want. Nice variety of sushi!! Everything was fresh tasted excellent. Friendly staff! Can't ask for more!"}
{"text":"My favorite! This place use to be Sapporo Sushi on Stephanie in Henderson, they moved across town years ago. They had moved again and Amazing I found them again! My favorite place for over 15 years!!!! Stacie roll is one of my favorites and you must try the spicy green muscles :)) Enjoy!"}
{"text":"2 stars because their customer service is horrible. 
The food is great though. 
Price is reasonable for AYCE. 23 before 3pm.
Don't expect to see your server. I've gone numerous times and I wait more than I eat to order. I always give them a chance thinking their service will change BUT it never does. 
Faster service,  sit at sushi bar ... the chefs are great. 
Bad customer service makes you want to go elsewhere !"}
{"text":"Rude servers
Deliberately walked by and started sweeping as to not take our order.
CHARGED MY 8 year old the ADULT price even with having a notice that child's ayce was $5 less.  

To be fair the food was good.  Therefore the 2 stars."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today around 1:30p. There were about 6 people sitting at the sushi bar. 3 of them regulars from their previous location. So many choices to choose from. Good option for the customer who does not like sushi. Teriyaki chicken and beef. I got the Stacie roll with chicken katsu. So filling. The two gentlemen making sushi asked us if we were enjoying our food. A first for me. Our waitress was great. Hard to understand her English at first but very thankful for our business.  Plenty of seating. They have one area capable of seating 10-15 more customers. Asked the waitress if more tables were going there and she said space could be available for bigger parties. Within walking distance of my home it kind of scares me how many times I'm going to eat here. Plenty of parking. Especially around dinner time when most of the other businesses close by are closed. Located right behind vinny's pizza"}
{"text":"Maybe I should have stuck to my guns and actually gone to my Go-To Sushi spot in town... 

But alas, I am trying hard not to direct business away from business. Sin City Sushi is located in the corner of the \"Wal-Mart-Strip-Mall\" 
Ample parking, bright lights, and a Rubio's right next door!

While the sushi was on par with other places I have tried, the service became the nail in the coffin for my decision to ever return. 

The AYCE is fairly priced, but when we only got to order once the entire 45 minutes and were not checked on nor could we flag down the hostess/server/cashier (2 woman for a pretty decent sized restaurant) I was a bit irritated. 

Sure, if you're in the area and don't mind sitting at the bar where I'm sure the chefs will take great care of you"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite sushi place in town.  Excellent, super attentive service, big selection, decent price, AYCE. This place is my go-to for fish rolls"}
{"text":"Quality of food is on point and they have a good selection of different things to order. I did the AYCE sushi. I think it's worth it.
Was a little weary at first because when we walked in a couple was walking out and said, \"good luck getting service.\" That's not a good first sign. We still took our chances and I'm glad we did. 
This place seems to be family owned and operated for the most part. Drink orders were taken and brought right away. The food was a little slow to come out so I kind of see where the other couple was coming from. They had oyster shooters which were really good. It was surprising to see on the menu. I tend to just order a lot of nigiri. The fish was good quality and cold like it's supposed to be. Good portion of rice so I wasn't getting full just on that. Waitresses were nice, but you would kinda have to wave them down if you needed something.
Overall even though the service might be a little off I would still come for the food."}
{"text":"Let's start off with...wow...great selection for AYCE sushi!!! My group did AYCE which included appetizers, hand rolls, cut rolls and nigiri. You order from the menu so it's made to order, which means FRESH!!! We ordered baked mussels, fried soft shell crab, seafood salad, cucumber salad, fried tofu, edamame, cut rolls and nigiri. AYCE dinner is approximately $25 per person, this includes dessert. The server checked in on us constantly to see if we wanted anything else. 

This restaurant is only about 10-15 min from The Strip. Well worth the drive!"}
{"text":"This place needs to learn some customer service or hire enough waitresses to put up with the demand. I stood for 10 minutes without being as much as acknowledged, same for the couple next to me who had been there before I arrived. There were two seats at the bar, that couple could've been sat down.

As for us, we had a party of 5 and expected to wait but without being acknowledged what is the point? 
The two waitresses walked around helping customers, they were obviously busy which I under stand but really how hard is it to say \"hi, I will be right with you\"? 

I will take my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Lunchtime with my work peeps and they want sushi. The last sushi outing was unsuccessful so this time I consulted my bookmarks. I had been wanting to try Sin City Sushi for so long but never got around to it so I insisted we go there. 

We arrived and were seated promptly. I recognized a few of the staff from my the now defunct Kai Sushi from a few years ago. We decided to order a few rolls to share and then I was able to get a little bit of nigiri to try as well. I don't normally order many rolls when I go to AYCE sushi places, but was trying to accommodating. The food came out pretty quickly and everything was pretty good. Some of the rolls we ordered were a little over sauced, but everything was solid and the flavors were really great. My favorites were probably the salmon skin handroll, mussels and nigiri. 

Service was friendly and very quick. Definitely a plus when you have a limited time for lunch. I look forward to coming back really soon and trying out more of their nigiri and hot dishes from the AYCE menu."}
{"text":"This would have to be the most terrible restaurant experience for me, EVER! I'm still trying to figure out how this place averages four stars, mind you, as I lay here recovering from food poisoning...the worst food poisoning EVER!!!

Even if I didn't get sick, my opinion of this place would not change. I have been a server & bartender for a combined 15 years - and the horrible food handling I witnessed was absolutely insane!! It's actually no surprise to me that I feel like I'm dying. 

I watched our server remove dirty dishes from our table, set them down, and proceed directly to the sushi counter where she grabbed prepared food (often making direct contact with her fingers), and then taking them to a table, as she adjusted the rolls and other food with her fingers as they shifted and rolled. I even witnessed her take a roll that was mistakingly put on our table and then place it on the correct table, even after my daughter had already started to pick it apart with her used fork. And yes, we pointed that out to the server, as well as her bad food handling practices - but she didn't seem to care. 

Need I mention, that it took 55 minutes for my daughter to get a veggie sushi roll during her \"all you can eat\" meal, which she ordered 5 minutes after we sat down. A few of her other dishes that were clearly marked on the paper were also \"forgotten\" and after I questioned our server she became confrontational and agitated, raising her voice (practically yelling) and throwing her arms in the air as she continously told me she had brought everything out. \"What's the point in lying\", I asked her...\"it's AYCE.\" Seconds later, they called her to the counter for the few dishes that had been forgotten. Again, just terrible. 

It was just plain AWFUL!!! I am so glad I'm the only one who got sick. And to think I was doing myself a favor by eating clean and ordering the hamachi kama. Let me just say bad fish is NO JOKE!! This place however is just that, a joke. 

Drive farther and get the quality and freshness you deserve - and spare yourself the barf fest, your insides will thank me!"}
