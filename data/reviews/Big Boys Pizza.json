{"text":"Got the large 1 topping with 10 wings special. Bought a side of marinara to dip the crust in.  Awesome pie. I've had a lot of types from different places and this was def very good.  New to the area and found this place on yelp. Menu and reviews looked good so I have it a shot. Glad I did.  The dough and crust was some of the best I've ever had on a pizza. Reminded me a bit of soft white pretzels at the mall. Really really good. The bacon was perfect.  The Honey hot wings.. No complaints at all. They were huge and tasty. The flavor was on point.  The marinara was 49cents and was worth every penny.  The ranch that came with the wings was perfect. Tasty and thick unlike a lot of places  now days.  Both the ranch and marinara come in a big container.  Got delivery and it was very quick. Food was plenty hot.  Not a single complaint at all."}
{"text":"When I got my pizza box and opened up the lid...I was in shock. Inside the box were the BIGGEST slices of pizza I have ever seen. I ordered three slices for a measly $7 and it was like the size of a pizza pie. I couldn't even eat more then one slice because they were soooo freekin big. And the taste was very good. I wish I lived closer to BIg Boys pizza..because now that i'm talking about it, I WANT that pizza right now! Give I to me Big Boys Pizza!"}
{"text":"I am extremely picky when it comes to pizza I called them and got this guy on the phone who didn't understand what I was ordering so said someone would call me back. Well a few minutes later I am called back and they include my wings for free because of their mix up. Pizza , wings and garlic knots came and all were amazing like the kind I got back east I'm sold on this place never ordering from anyone else again."}
{"text":"I have been disappointed in the pizza I was getting lately so when I saw this place I tried it.  Very good pizza.  Well balanced, chewy crust, good sauce and good toppings.  Toppings like sausage are of very good quality.  Very clean place and very friendly people. Nothing to not like."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in the valley.  Was scared when they were down for remodeling.  But they came back as Big Boys Pizza."}
{"text":"At first I thought $4 for a slice of pizza was expensive. When my pizza was ready, I changed my mind. The slice could have wrapped around my head twice and it came with a drink. I made the right choice in ordering artichoke hearts as a topping. My only mistake was not trying the garlic knots. I will next time for sure!"}
{"text":"Pizza was very good.  Business seems to be struggling.  They ask for cash to save money on credit cards during the summer.  Soda machine was broke but they had cans that were nice and cold.  The personal pizza was made quickly and it was great.  Actually reminded me of New York pizza!  Rare to find around these parts.  The owner seemed to be a nice guy.  I think the food is actually under priced for the portions and quality of the food.  If your in the neighborhood check them out.  They deliver after five too.  Couldn't give 5 stars due to outdated interior and the watery ranch."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza. Period. I found this place because I had just moved to Mesa and my boyfriend and I wanted to find \"our\" pizza place. We found it. Note: \"Large\" is their smallest pizza. The flavor is amazing. We unfortunately live outside the delivery area, but that's probably good for my wallet and my belt! Driving home with the pizza in the car is torture because it smells so amazing! They also recently expanded to include more seating which made me happy. The ice cream they offer is also really good!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from here a couple months ago. Had the buffalo chicken pizza with an order of the garlic knots. They were fantastic! Just moved to the area and was excited to order from here again. Placed a pick up order today for the buffalo chicken pizza with an extra side of buffalo sauce and blue cheese. Brought the pizza home to find it was only a cheese with chicken pizza soaked in buffalo sauce. For someone who loves buffalo sauce enough to order an extra side of it, the food wasn't even edible. Per the Yelp menu, the chicken is tossed in the buffalo sauce not the entire pizza. It was also missing the ranch and onions that were supposed to be on it. The blue cheese side tasted spoiled. The food was such a disappointment that I almost called to ask for my $20 back. Super bummed that this place is not consistent with the food they make. I provided two stars because of the past meal I had with them."}
{"text":"With all the 5 star reviews I just had to try this place. Good on the customer service. I ordered a large pepperoni pizza. It was good but definitely not 5 star quality. I would give Papa Johns or Dominos like 2 stars. This place is just a notch above them. Places like Oreganos, Floridinos or La Famigla rank at 4-5stars."}
{"text":"The pizza was incredible! This place is around the corner from me and it's now in the top 10 pizza places I know. I look forward to ordering again. Added bonus, the garlic knots are awesome."}
{"text":"Great for lunch specials but not so much for delivery. YOU SHOULD PROBABLY ASK FOR PIZZA WELL DONE. OTHERWISE IT'S A LITTLE SOGGY Lunch has affordable slice specials with a drink and salad or wings. Deliver is hard because they don't have a website. Also My pizza showed up half folded over and messy like the driver slammed on the brakes and I was handed a 2 ltr covered in dirt and crumbs of some sort like it was rolling around in her floorboard or something...kinda gross. The wings and garlic knots were good though."}
{"text":"\"Big Boy's\" is in our \"delivery zone\". It's a nice change up from the usual delivery joints. \"Big Boy's\" is independent, authentic style pizza, and they even have \"Thrifty's\" brand ice cream which I have to say is a bit of a gem. A real diamond in the rough! I recommend this place for dine-in and delivery."}
{"text":"I started going here after I had a mishap with some of the national chain pizza places... I haven't been able to keep myself away from them.  They will give you any 2 toppings and a soda for 5$.  They have making some awesome changes to the place, you are actually able to refill your own soda now.   I highly recommend the Hires Rootbeer to go along with the pizza.  The pizza you have to try is Artichoke & Bacon."}
{"text":"First time trying them and I'm sold. Quality, service, all top notch. Ordered online, quick and easy. Looking forward to trying other menu items soon!"}
{"text":"I found Big Boys Pizza great place to get a pizza. A friend of mine from Mesa, told me about this place on the phone last night. I decided to go in today to get pizza. I came in today this afternoon. Got a Pepperoni Pizza for $5.99. A special they do every Tuesday and Wednesday every week. I tried the pizza look and tasted great. Just like the kind of Pizza, I had when used to live on East Coast, many years ago. I had great service. Try this place for lunch or dinner, before you go to any other pizza place if you are in Mesa.    Michael Katz Chandler, AZ"}
{"text":"This ills the best pizza I have had in years. The quality is consistent and they deliver on time every time"}
{"text":"Always a good pie! Giant slices and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Wow. I'm not sure what sort of pizza reviewers are used to eating, however, this has got to be some of the worst pizza I've ever had. :( The people on the phone were nice, the pie was ready to go as soon as we got there (we were early), and smelled fantastic going home... So much potential! That's where the love affair ended. The toppings look shriveled and gray. We got the veg head and added sausage. I've never tasted a pizza with so little flavor. The sauce was bland, the cheese non-descript, even all of those topping tasted like nothing. The lack of flavor was the biggest surprise and lasting impression.  My quest for a respectable east valley slice lives to see another day..."}
{"text":"Great Pizza!! We aren't from around here so I used the helpful tips from yelp! Salads are huge and delicious along with the pizza!!! So glad we made the decision to come here!  Also love that's its family owned!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying that I appreciate great food and rather picky, a \"foodie\" if you will. I stumbled on Big Boys Pizza nearly a year ago, and it's now a staple in my rotation of favorites. I felt compelled to write a review for a couple reasons. Today I went and the pizza was once again amazing, along with the customer service and friendly, cool vibe it has. What initially struck me most about this place is that all the employees go out of their way to treat you with kindness and are extremely personable and friendly! I feel as though I'm among family each time I've gone and have NEVER been disappointed. The second reason is that from day one, Natalie deserves the utmost credit and kudos. She is fantastic! Always greeting me with a warm smile, and very attentive to the customer, even during the busiest times. It's evident she genuinely cares about delivering the best customer experience, and her amazing personality shines through, even when they are short handed and the place is packed. I was appalled at a couple of the reviews posted, specifically Jodi R.'s review which was derogatory and classless. It couldn't be further from the truth, and just because someone chooses to wear piercings is purely self expression and has no bearing on their job performance. Natalie is a compassionate person and clearly cares about others and takes pride in her work. Take a minute to speak with her and you'll see for yourself what a wonderful person she is. I have no bias or motive for writing this, other than I hate to see good people get bashed by someone who clearly has issues. Big Boys pizza rocks!"}
{"text":"upsell upsell overcharge overcharge  thought i would try this place again- was there twice in past year, each time they try to upsell you on their greasy pizza- ordered 2 slices and they charged extra for cheese- (doesn't pizza come with cheese?)repeat they charged extra for cheese- im serious, when i questioned it, she removed the charge, but i left, as i remembered my neighbor reminding me as to thier desperate upsell rip off tactics. do not waste your time at this place- and the pizza box is dripping with grease  greasy spoon pizza"}
{"text":"You need to stop by for their lunch special! Not only is the pizza the largest pizza I've ever seen but also taste very good as well! They are a small company but well worth giving them a shot. If location was better, they would be more popular."}
{"text":"With all the rave reviews I have read about Big Boys, I was expecting great results! Maybe I expected too much out of this small pizza joint. We ordered a 16'' pizza, mozzarella sticks, and chicken tenders for dinner to be delivered to our house. People mostly compliment the place's large single slices, and maybe for the price that would've been a better option for lunch time. But for dinner and a full pizza for the price, it wasn't anything to write home about.  Delivery: 5/5 Pretty standard delivery times. We ordered around 8PM on a Sunday night, and received our food at around 8:30 or 8:45. The ease of online ordering was great, also!  Pizza: 3/5 Okay pizza. Tasted more 'home-made' than the big-brand counter-parts like Pizza Hut or Domino's. Pretty decent amount of cheese, and the pepperoni used was good. Nothing really 'special' though.  Mozzarella sticks: 2/5 It's pretty hard to mess up mozzarella sticks, but these for some reason just tasted... off. Maybe it was the oil used to fry them, or maybe the flour/breading used. Just didn't taste 100% to me.  Chicken Tenders: 3/5 Same complaint as above, really. They had a weird after taste, either attributed to the fryer oil or breading. The chicken itself seemed like a pretty decent portion for the price.   All in all, I probably WOULDN'T order another full pizza from this place again. I may try out some of their other options, like the fries or garlic knots and only order a slice of pizza, as others have done."}
{"text":"Fantastic as billed. Slices are not pre-made, so you can order them as you like. Definitely warrants a revisit!"}
{"text":"I was hungry and looking for a place for lunch and saw Big Boys Pizza with twenty four 5-Star ratings here on yelp.  So I decided to check it out.  As others have said the slices are huge.  I got a lunch special:  1 slice with 2 toppings and a drink for $4.99...so it's very affordable....but...........  There were 4 other people (2 tables of 2) already served and eating when I ordered.  After ordering I sat down with my drink and something to read.   I don't think anyone else came in while I waited...and didn't keep track of the time but it started to seem like it was taking a long time.  When at last my slice was brought out to me....immediately to my eye it looked over cooked.  They provide a pizza slicer and since the slices are big I decided to cut into it.    Crunch....crunch...crunch.   The crust was like a cracker.  When I got home I re-read some reviews here talking about a chewy crust.  This wasn't even close.    Having never been there though, I had no idea if this was \"normal\" so since I was hungry I went ahead and dug in.  At one point, I looked at the bottom of the slice and although it wasn't burned it seemed to me like it was very close to getting there.  I'm no food connoisseur and normally couldn't tell you what spices are used in something...but on one bite I got a VERY strong taste of something and then realized it was garlic.  From then on I noticed that there was a lot of garlic and oregano on the pizza.  It's now been an hour or so and I can still taste both very strongly.  If you're really thirsty you'll want to pace yourself...because I asked about re-fills when I ordered...and was told they offer just one...but the woman who took my order did indicate she'd be willing to break the \"rule\" for me.  I'd estimate the plastic cup they use is 12 to 16 oz.  I definitely am full and got out of there for 5 dollars and change.  So if you're just looking to fill up and don't want to spend a lot...I can recommend Big Boys Pizza for that.    But for me...I had a poor experience and this'll be my last trip there."}
{"text":"Flavorful crust but low quality toppings leave pizza greasy. Huge slices but unappealing bites."}
{"text":"A slice of pizza is A FULL MEAL. A delicious one at that. My favorite pizza hands-down. Super excellent customer service, these folks know how to make some flippin pizza. Mmm. I just made myself want some."}
{"text":"I had 19 teenage boys at my house to say the least. That was two weeks ago and they still can't stop talking about how phenomenal the pizza was. Best pizza in the valley!"}
{"text":"Friendly customer service - from ordering to pick-up. Order was ready fast and on time. Pizza was great and reminded us of home (East coast)! It's been awhile since we've had pizza this style and this good! Wings were great, but garlic knots were so-so. Very pleased! We will be back :)"}
{"text":"Pizza and wings were tasty but here are the reasons I will NEVER go back!  1 spent $120 to dine in and they charged us 50 cents for ranch dressing 2. Bathroom inside was employees only, had to walk down a slope and thru rocks and gravel around the back of the building for restroom 3 no wet wipes for 30 wings  4 extremely rude staff"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I am a fluffy guy. I enjoy sitting on my couch, eating food and watching trashy reality shows. I love this place. I ordered a pie with meatball and sausage and some spicy BBQ wings. Yummy yummy!!! Wings were meaty with a perfect mix of crunchy and saucy. The pizza was actually tasty. The delivery was so fast my food was still hot. This is my new go to place. And they deliver Thrifty ice cream!!!"}
{"text":"They no longer honor the special. New owners. Fountain drink dispenser doesn't work correctly and the drinks come out flat with no carbonation."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Their lunch special is served all day and includes one humongous slice of pizza with your choice of 2 toppings made fresh and a drink.  They serve it to you with a pizza cutter because it's so huge!  Their sauce and crust are good and their toppings are fresh.  Place reminds me of a lot of mom and pop pizza shops from back in Chicago.  Great stuff!"}
{"text":"Giant slices! They keep you full for the entire day haha no joke! Their fried foods take forever to get so call ahead if you want anything from the deep fryer.  Overall its great low quality pizza!"}
{"text":"This place is in a random strip mall but is pretty yummy! The salad is actually fresh and not a big mess of iceberg lettuce. Friendly staff too. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"We used Yelp to find this hidden gem and LOVED IT!  After spending a week on vacation spending too much money on tiny portions and trendy food, we finally found Big Boy's.  We are a family of four picky eaters and everyone LOVED the pizza.  The owner was very friendly and helpful.   This place is perfect for everyone, as they sell 14 inch slices for someone alone to pizza ranging from 14 to 28 inches.  They sell other side items and have two cases of ice cream.   The only thing better than the prices are the slices!"}
{"text":"@ Steve S. Why would you give 1 star when you haven't tried the place and are asking a question?  Well the answer to your question is YES the pizza is as good if not better.  Since the new owners took over my orders don't get messed up and WOW have they cleaned the place up!  The Big Boy slice is a great lunch deal.  The staff is friendly and the cooks don't stand there and mumble to themselves.  I really like what they have done with the place and will be going back for more!"}
{"text":"They are literally within sight of/walking distance from Jimmie and Joe's, they also make an enormous slice of pizza for lunch.  Big Boy makes a far better slice-for less.  All I can say is Well Done!   Stop by, grab a slice, order a pie....don't make me keep this place in business all by myself.   This is REAL Neighborhood Pizza-like I remember from my days Back East."}
{"text":"Good food great prices!! Always fast friendly and on time! Love this place and the staff"}
{"text":"the pizza is very greasy and the cheese is rubbery. It is well priced, but I would rather spend more somewhere else then eat what I think was basically soy oil."}
{"text":"I loved this place when I first tried it but after I had tried to order with the $19.99 offer they show on their yelp page- I disliked them. They did not want to give me it for that price even though they offer here online. If a Dollar makes that much of a difference to them then I will take my money else wear. Personally it's not the money that makes a difference it's the fact they didn't stand by their offer. Never will eat here again."}
{"text":"Natalie is a supposed manager here and was the biggest bitch today!  Not only did she get the order wrong but she blamed me for the mistake.  She was rude, nasty, and needs to get those ugly piercings off her face as a manager.  They charged us for drinks when the lunch special we ordered included them.  They also charge $.23 per box for take out, which is ridiculous.  Ownership has changed in the past year and service and pricing along with it.  Taking my business elsewhere and my co-workers agree as well.  Natalie is a common example of how today's employees in Corporate America don't care about themselves or their jobs.  She's an ugly piece of shit!  Pizza is still good.  :)"}
{"text":"That the slices are so large, and loaded with toppings (if you decide on them), and the crust manages to remain CRISP is something that should be acknowledged.  No soggy slices! Ever. Been here a couple of times for the lunch specials, and it is easily the best deal you'll get for around $5 - $7, depending on which special you want. The slices are enormous, and the salad is fresh and great - not the standard iceberg lettuce.   Absolutely recommend for a lunch stop (11 AM - 3 PM) if you are in the area. Today me and a girlfriend were able to feed ourselves and our two sons for roughly $25, and there was food left to take home."}
{"text":"Overwhelmingly greasy.  we ordered the 18\" supreme & it was so greasy that when we picked up a slice the toppings all fell off. Not enjoyable whatsoever. I would not recommend."}
{"text":"The appetizers are so tasty. We've always had delivery from them so you could imagine getting fried mushrooms; once they get to your house they should be soggy, right? WRONG! I mean seriously, best appetizers ever. All of them.  Pizza, oh my lord. Delicious. Their crust is excellent, it's kind of twisty like?  Their varieties for sodas are those of the off brands, so that's the only \"complaint\"  I love the fact that it's SUPER cheap, but doesn't taste cheap."}
{"text":"So this review has nothing to do with the quality of Big Boys Pizza and only the customer service  I received from a guy named \"Ralph\" who claimed to be the manager on staff at time.   I live outside the delivery zone by a block, when I first started ordering from Big Boys I had to talk to the owner/manager and he told me that to ensure freshness they couldn't deliver to my area, but he made the exception to gain a customer.  I knew the pizza might be a tad colder than if I live a block closer but who cares if its good pizza.  So with that settled Big Boys became the new delivery spot.   Saturday night, have friends over for the UFC fight and I call to order some pizza, I place the order and when the computer brought up my address the guy said that he can not deliver to me because I live outside their delivery area.  I explained to \"Ralph\" that I know, but its ok because I have ordered multiple times and there has never been a problem.  \"Ralph\" said that their zone had changed and that he was sorry but he couldn't deliver to me.  I explained that I wouldn't be in the computer system if I had not already been getting deliveries.  \"Ralph\" was very short and told me that they are to busy to deliver a pizza to me within a timely manner, and kept repeating I live outside their delivery range.    This is a manager that cant handle management.  Total lack of customer service skill and resolve.  He pretty much told me to f off and order from some place else because he already has enough deliveries and he's behind enough to be making exceptions so tuff luck kid!!!    So much for ordering food from this place, hopefully \"Ralph\" gets fired and goes back to Walmart where his lack of intellect will serve him better."}
{"text":"I have to agree with my fellow Yelpers on this one! Great pizza at great prices. This pie has flavor from top to bottom & front to back! We ordered ours a little crispy which added even more flavor! I love the garlic brushing they do over the crust. It came piping hot from the oven and we were not disappointed. Be sure to check their specials. On Wednesday you can get the smallest (and it's not even that small) cheese pizza for $4.99! Next time I want a pizza I know where I'm going."}
{"text":"Joshua is who we always see here. Fantastic customer service- we come here for lunch once a week and he knows our orders and greets us by name. As for the food, it's amazing- the lunch special s are an amazing value. $6 for a huge 2 topping slice and a drink. Savory sauce, melty cheese, and a crisp crust make this our go-to pizza place in Mesa."}
{"text":"Great pizza...and you won't leave hungry.   My wife wanted to try a new pizza place and we read the raving Yelp reviews about Big Boys and thought we would give it a try. We each ordered a slice, which equaled about 3 pieces of any other local pizza. Great crust, thin and chewy.   Super friendly staff and lots of specials to choose from. Have been back twice since our first visit and I am counting the days until we order more Big Boys Pizza!"}
{"text":"The best pizza crust in town!  Love this place!  My go to pizza delivery.  The delivery people are always so nice too. You should really try this pizza. Good food, great prices, and stellar customer service!"}
{"text":"Bad really bad pizza.  This place is defiantly quantity over quality. Yea the slice is huge but it's not any good. The soda is watered down.    I ordered a slice of cheese and a soda. It took 20 minutes for them to bring it out and they weren't even close to being busy.   This type of place makes me wonder if yelp is deleting negative reviews. There is no way this place should have as many stars as it does."}
{"text":"Me and my wife invited my brother in law here. Not to mention he is a crazy pizza fan. We order a meaty pizza with all sort of great toppings. The price was right and the cleaning of the restaurant was great. If anything this place is a must go when craving pizza."}
{"text":"Had lunch here for the first time this week. Great staff, great pizza. Anyone that knows me will attest I save my 5 star Pizza reviews for the ELITE. Not quite that, but very good nonetheless."}
{"text":"Still amazing. With their $6 large pizza special on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and $5 off GrubHub codes, I am able to get two large pizzas for less than 10 bucks. Best delivery deal, hands down. You'll never find a cheaper and tastier pizza place."}
{"text":"I've been pining for a local, mom-n-pop type of pizza place for some time, as I prefer to support locally based businesses and the food almost always tends to be way better.  My search (via Yelp) finally brought me her to Big Boys.    Thus far I've had a few different pizzas, the garlic knots and the chicken tenders.  All of it has been really, really good.  The pizza dough is very well done, topped by a very good, tangy sauce and they have a fairly diverse selection of possible toppings.  The garlic knots are heaven.  Covered in butter, garlic and all manner of tasty things.  If you a bread person (like I am), you will love their garlic knots.    I've also had the chicken strips.  I've asked for them crispy both times I've had them and that's exactly how they make them.  Golden and crunchy on the outside with ranch and wing sauce to tip them into.  Super good!  If you are looking for a local pizza spot, you should absolutely give Big Boys a try. Quality food and the staff has always been polite and very attentive.  Good stuff.  :)"}
{"text":"Buyer beware! Truthfully, the pizza's pretty good, it's the management that's severely lacking. We ordered for delivery tonight - a large pizza, which arrived as the smallest large pizza I'd ever seen. The menu states 4 sizes - 14 in, 16 in, 18 in, and 24 in. Which size would YOU guess is large? WRONG! According to Big Boys, a large is 14 inches, at least in the alternate universe they live in where small and medium pies do not exist. When I called and asked for a credit, I could clearly hear the owner/manager tell the sweet girl who answered the phone \"no.\" So oh well - order if you will, but if you're feeding more than 1 teenage boy you'd better go for whatever they call the 24 inch, and enjoy. Can't say we'll ever again be doing the same."}
{"text":"This is THE value pizza joint in the area.  You're not getting gourmet pizza here but you'd have to pay a lot more to get more or better pizza than what you can get at big boys.  Not to mention they have wings, chicken tenders, salads, ice cream, a little of everything to fill that hole in your tummy. I figured that if I bought a slice of piZza I would be picking from a selection of premade pies sitting out all day - not so!  I picked out my toppings and I got my custom slice for four bucks.  Gotta like that"}
{"text":"Really enjoy their slice and drink special here, I come in every time I'm working in town.  The slices are huge and pretty filling(usually get the pineapple and pepperoni.)  their wings are pretty great as well , always piping hot when they come out. I'd wish this place was a little bigger as I always feel so enclosed in their eating area but overall great place"}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday, was starving after a day at the Phoenix Open.  Read several Yelp reviews and felt like this would be a great place to eat.  Ordered the garlic knots, they were outstanding. Ordered a 18 inch onion, sausage and mushroom pizza.  Let me first say,  I think they forgot we ordered, our knots and pizza arrived at the same time and we waited for too much time. The knots were great, the pizza was flavorless.  That's the only way to describe it. I' m still trying to figure out how they made that pizza with no flavor.  Confused?"}
{"text":"After a long day with no energy to cook, I still needed to feed the fam. I'm so glad I tried this pizza joint.  This place is amazin.  I don't have the words to describe.  If your looking for pizza just order from here. You will thank me!"}
{"text":"Really good Pizza and salads but, even better, super nice people and I try to patronize local small businesses when possible. Great food, nice, folks, kudos to the owner and employees"}
{"text":"Coming from NY, it's difficult trying to find a good pizza spot.... Especially one with quality food, good prices and a decent size.   This spot is beyond good! It's great! It's definitely going to be a regular spot for me :) can't beat a GIGANTIC slice, drink and a side salad for under 8 bucks!"}
{"text":"Cheap and yummy. Their crust is on the thinner side (not a bad thing) and I personally love their all-veggie option. The garlic knots are flavorful and chewy. For the price, it's definitely good. Not particularly fast so I wouldn't recommend showing up with the intention of grab and go.  They actually have a challenge where you and a buddy has 28 minutes to eat a 28 inch pizza. Good luck to whoever wants to try lol"}
{"text":"Our family is so glad to have found this place! They have great dinner deals and their pizza is a great quality the ingredients are so good weekend to get the one topping pizzas and enjoy them very much their wings are a good size not some mainly little things like you get at other places. They do very reasonable delivery"}
{"text":"Favorite casual pizza place at the moment. Love the freshness of the dough! It's kinda small, but it's more of a quick lunch spot.  Single slices are huge!"}
{"text":"It's pretty decent pizza but boy if you try to deliver expect a half hour to hour later that they tell you,twice in a row 45 minutes turned into 1.5 hours and luke warm pizza..."}
{"text":"This is the only place  I go for pizza.  NY style with a nice crispy crust.  Large slice and reasonable price. Great neighborhood pizza place."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  It's a nice, old-fashioned local pizza shop.  I got the slice special which is big enough to feed 2.  It comes with a handy pizza cutter.  All of the ingredients have a lot of flavor.  They use the crumbled sausage instead of the little nuggets that the national companies use.    The crust is thinner under the pizza, but thicker on the edges.  They coat it with a garlic butter that makes it taste like garlic bread.  Very good texture, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  It really adds a nice touch.  Easy to find, really easy parking, free refills on soda, very friendly staff.  It's one of those local shops you want to see succeed so give them a try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We order a bunch of pizza, usually from Costco....I have to say, this pie was one of the best we have ever had!  The delivery was really quick, the pizza and wings came pipping hot and were crowd pleasers.  I also had a House Salad, it is big enough for 2 people.  Every bite was absolutely delicious and the delivery guy was very polite and professional.  I would highly recommend this spot to anyone.  Next time we will eat in and enjoy some ice cream too!"}
{"text":"My bf and I have always noticed this place everytime we passes by. So one day we stopped in checked out their menus and ended up ordering pepperoni and Hawaiian pizza with wings. They pizza pies are huge and if you order single slices those are pretty huge as well. You can make it into like 3 slices. Anywho we took the pizza home ate it and its pretty bomb. They have a variety of other toppings. Oh and they sell Thirfty Ice Cream. Say what?! Yum! Oh and if you live within their delivery area, they will deliver too."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for habit but breaking free from my usual spot down the street, I tried Big Boys Pizza today. I walked in and was immediately greeted by the friendly staff. The small dining room is clean, quiet, well themed and upbeat. There are two flat-screens mounted for your enjoyment. One can hear pizza sizzle and toppings being chopped from their seat as they wait for their order.  I felt like I was back home at the family pizza joint.   Cheap, quick, easy, enormously sliced and flavorful, this New York style pizza was just what I was craving. The menu features a comprehensive selection of toppings and specials. The staff isn't afraid to make suggestions or adjust their specials to your wallet's benefit. Though the prices are on par with with the lower-tier pizza chains, the quality of the pie is up there with the best of the valley. I honestly can't wait to order their 28'' Big Boy pizza for my next party.  My only gripe was the $5 minimum required for credit/debit transactions. I've noticed many business implementing this policy but there are many companies that have developed technology to ease this issue i.e. Paypal Here, Square. I'll just have to remember to bring cash next time.  Keep in mind: Big Boys also delivers."}
{"text":"I called to place an order using the coupon on Yelp and they hung up on me. Lol don't use it!"}
{"text":"My family has ordered pizza and wings several times from \"Big boys\" and theses guys are awesome! Every time that we have received pizza and wings from them it's been 10 out of 10!! Very fresh, always hot and never been disappointed with the quality. Customer service is outstanding. Quick delivery with honest and quality employees. Thank you \"Big boys\" for such great service and amazing food!! You won't be disappointed! Won't go anywhere else for pizza or wings!"}
{"text":"After a long day of travel,  called in for a pizza late on a weekend night. Wonderful friendly service and our pizza was ready when promised.  We prefer thin crust and theirs delivers. Love their sauce, it has a nice blend of seasonings and garlic. Will be back for more pizza and to try some of the other goodies on their menu!  They are known for their huge pizza which someone was picking up as we were waiting. It looks wonderful for a party or group of pizza lovers."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill ... Pizza a solid OK and the customer service and polite employees a 0!   There is better pizza pie out there... don't waste time and money."}
{"text":"Wow. $3 for a slice of pizza larger than most medium pizzas. It's the closest thing ive found in the valley to the pizzas back home in New York. It's family owned and operated too. I love supporting a (good) local small business. I'm a fan. I just wish they would ditch the RC cola for coke or Pepsi."}
{"text":"Without question, this is the best pizza I have had in Arizona.  While it does not taste like anything \"special\" at the beginning, once you bite the crust your taste-buds will experience an overpowering orgasmic sensation.  Its a homemade dough and I think they season it with garlic and butter or something.  While i said the rest of the pizza is not anything super special, it is still really good - as good as  any quasi New York style pizza can be (i personally prefer chicago stuffed style pizza if i have the option)   Also, its cheap and their are always specials going on just ask.   Also, FYI, while they have a few tables, I would recommend getting carry out - its not the best \"ambiance\""}
{"text":"I LOVE this spot. Put it this way, I live in NW Phoenix & drive here for pizza. The people are friendly and make sure you love your food & have a good experience. I am the type of person who never eats their crust, but this crust is so on point...love it. Their garlic knots are homemade. The sauce is sweet and full of flavor. It's a fun place to bring a friend to so they can see their massive pizza by the slice which they serve on a pizza pan with a pizza cutter. I love coming here. Prepare to be addicted ; )"}
{"text":"I wouldn't go out of the way for it. Pizza and wings are mediocre, and the wait time was 1hr from my email confirmation. Ranch was not complimentary with wings nor encouraged to be purchased. Customer service was above par but that might be the only redeeming quality."}
{"text":"I just moved into the area and was looking for something to \"replace\" my favorite Mom & Pop joint in Gilbert. Big Boys Pizza is damn good, especially for the price! Delivery guy was super friendly and he even gave us plates, napkins, etc. We will be ordering from here regularly!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to get some lunch after seeing good reviews on Yelp. They have a lot of signage pointing you in, which made it a lot easier to find. The staff was friendly, if a little abrupt (I said I wanted a slice of pizza to go and the guy responded, \"Why don't you want the special?\"). The slices are indeed gigantic. Nice amount of cheese and great crust. The sauce could use some improvement and they only have RC Cola, but all in all, I can see the appeal of Big Boys for a cheap and tasty lunch."}
{"text":"If I could give these guys six stars, I would. Everything was just excellent. The slices are ridiculously big and very reasonably priced, but they also know that quality matters- it was all so fresh!!  The guys at the counter were great- even hooked us up with some garlic knots while we were waiting for our slices... yum. We will def. be back- and I'd recommend you stop your lunch/dinner search and head there now!"}
{"text":"This place is great, man the 28 in big boy is a huge pizza and you know sometimes with quantity you don't get quality.  Well that is not the case here, the pizza was delicious, the wings were awesome and the garlic twists were very tasty.  This is on my pizza place short list for sure."}
{"text":"Went to Costco to grab a pizza and the ovens were down.  Quickly yelped a pizza place in the area and this came up.  Called in a large cheese pizza for pick up.  $7.55 with tax.  The smell of the pizza was amazing and very garlicy.  The look was thin with lots of dripping cheese.  I brought it to a friends house and it was devoured.  Everyone loved it.  Unfortunately I wasn't hungry so didn't get the opportunity to taste it.  I WILL be back though!!"}
{"text":"Best NY pizza ever!  You will love the garlic buttered crust and their perfect sauce.  Get there!  Now! (Bad reviews are likely competitors or agents for competitors IMO.  The pizza business is super competitive.  These guys will crush their competition.)  I work in Mesa and stumbled upon this place one day at lunch.  Brought it back to work and EVERYONE who tried it, loved it."}
{"text":"I am soooo happy we tried this place. We live around the corner. The BEST pizza in the East Valley. I know many love Nello's, but this place is a cross between New York and Chicago pizza. Yummy!  Coming back, for sure!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Just moved to Arizona and we're trying to find pizza similar to our favorite place back home and this is pretty dang close!"}
{"text":"ever since i moved to arizona i cant find a decient pizza. this place is awesome. im so impressed.. the pizza was great the antipasta was really good, fancy lettuce and 3 meats and 2 cheeses. meatballs were great and my kids loved the chicken fingers."}
{"text":"Super greasy, soggy pizza, ended up eating one slice each and threw the rest out. The wings were so soggy, the breading was like a mush consistency. We were going to throw those away too, but we actually salvaged them by throwing them on the grill for 20 minutes. Whoever is doing the cooking needs to re evaluate their methods, because texture of the food is an issue. After spending over $50 (delivery) and being super disappointed in the food quality; especially after reading good reviews, I will not be trying this place again any time soon."}
{"text":"The place reminds me of a place in Hoboken, the slices are huge and the pizza is as close the pizza I grew up with in jersey as I can find. The value for lunch is awesome it's a huge slice and a drink with two toppings for 6 bucks and u won't leave hungry.  The service is friendly and inviting. I will be eating here more often"}
{"text":"The pizza was super good but greasy, but not overly greasy. Garlic knots... Careful if you like bread, you might not, be able to stop.... Good deal."}
{"text":"I ordered from them twice this week both times were amazing.  today 3 / 22 / 11 I ordered 1 thing different which was the garlic knots(not abig venture but...so!) after I had my grand mal seizure from the exploding massive amount of grand mal ish flavor, I decided to write  this review. I have never tried crack, well not that I know of at least, but I would venture to say that this is as close an addictive substance as crack but what do I know. My son who will eat nothing asks for seconds and steals his sisters slice of pizza so what the hell just happened? There has to be something awesome in there That makes me feel addicted as if I was addicted to crack and literally changes my son into a completely different little kid that eats food. What the hell is in that stuff? Hell I might even be back tomorrow."}
{"text":"I just lost my review as I was about to enter it.  This just adds to my angst.  I called and ordered my beloved \"TOMB\" pizza, it was 25 minutes as they had predicted.  The crust was not as good as before, more bread like, perhaps under cooked a bit.  The sauce was scant, the toppings not as tasty as I remembered, less cheese, but still looked pretty but tasted dry.  Staff as pleasant as always, still upbeat and friendly.  In my review a year and a half ago I said \"You won't be disappointed eating here\", well I was tonight.  I will wait awhile and give them another chance."}
{"text":"Giant slices of Traditional pizza, great prices and the staff is friendly and fun.  Stop by, you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Oh. My. Goodness!!! We stopped in based on the other reviews and we LOVED it!! We each got a slice and drink, order of BBQ wings and an order of the garlic knots....all amazing! The wings were nice and meaty with great sauce coverage. Garlic knots were tasty and the pizza was amazing with a crispy crust to boot! Great value and super awesome girl at the register :-) Next time we come up from Tucson we will be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Thanks for the great pizza tonight. I burned our Costco pizza and the kids cried.   So we picked up the phone and bam, pizza and ice cream where in minutes.   Now I know better.  Big Boys Pizza from now on"}
{"text":"They where  bought out by new owners, and the first thing they did was change the soda to Pepsi and I hate Pepsi, used to have rc cola. Then they raised the prices. I am pretty sure they started using cheaper ingredients too. I used to eat here 3 times a week now I won't ever go back. I don't know why people buy a successful restaurant and just start changing stuff to maximise profits."}
{"text":"Hope your hungry... Great Pizza and the garlic knotts were awesome.  And a reasonable delivery time."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first time trying out Big Boys Pizza. We are very satisfied with the quality of the food and service. The delivery guy was very nice and quick. It was the best looking and tasting pizza we've had in our area! We've tried some of the competitors in the area, but they are over priced and mediocre...Big Boys is the best!"}
{"text":"I freaking love this place.  I live clear across town and drive all the way here for thier garlic knots and Calzones.  Always.  Idk what happened tho... Today they came out rock hard, no butter. Terrible.  I asked for a new one and they came out less hard but still ridiculous.  My calzone was burnt.  What happened guys?  So devastating.  New kitchen guy?  :("}
{"text":"Just finished eating here and it was really good! The Pizza, the Garlic Knots, and the Fried Zucchini were all very good! Don't try to use the Yelp Check-In promotion because it has expired."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from Big Boys for the past few months and really enjoyed their pizza and wings.  The last week I have ordered from there twice.  The wings the first order tasted like they were made a few days prior.  This time I ordered and the pizzas were late to the tune of 45 minutes.  I called and the girl that answered was not accomadating at all, condecending at points.  I asked to speak to their manager and it took them time to figure out that the manager was not there.  She was extremely rude so I asked her name and she said it was Natalie.  The delivery driver got there and said,\"sorry man...  headlight went out on my way here..  Had to call my wife\"...  what a crock of sh.."}
{"text":"I have no idea how I ended up here, driving by I concluded that I didn't want to eat here. It looked like a non-descript, darkened window blah storefront but Boy am I glad I came back!  The lowdown *HUGE HUGE HUGE slices, it takes up a big pizza pan for only the one slice UNDER $4!Also comes with your own pizza roller to cut that baby up. *Whole pizzas are ridiculous, about the size of 2 large pizzas. *Always crisp never soggy, I hate soggy pizza~ Streets of NY I am looking at you! *Toppings are fresh not canned, sauce is excellent, crust nice flavor. *Thrifty ice cream *See photos for lunch specials  This is my off-diet day place to come. I wholeheartedly recommend this place because the people are actually very friendly. No hitting or throwing things at you! They look at you and smile! They actually thank you for coming! Unheard of these days to extend human kindness."}
{"text":"Pizza is amazing. 3 stars is for the dining in service. No bathrooms for the public?? Come on man! Huge pizza slices are great,  wings are ok."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Great prices.  Excellent service!  I come here about 2-3 times a month.  Only negative I found was that the pepperoni pizza is sometimes a little greasy.  But nothing a paper towel can't solve.  My favorite local pizza place!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had, and at a good price!!!! The serving sizes are huge too, and the flavor is very fresh and authentic. Good atmosphere, clean place, overall awesome experience!!! 10 out of 10 would recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible! I needed to bring pizza to a business meeting with 10 hungry men, and although Big Boys Pizza doesnt open until 11, they began making my pizzas at 10:30 when I called. They were extremely friendly and even offered to help me drive the food to the meeting because the boxes were almost too big to fit in my rental car! Not only was the service exceptional but the pizza itself was delicious. My clients were in awe at how big the pizzas were. I definitely made a lasting impression and my clients will remember my company because of Big Boys. I only wish I had a Big Boys at home in Orange County, CA. Thank you!!!!"}
{"text":"The slices are huge! Delicious pizza and friendly people working there. This was not my first time, but wanted to share a good review- last time I went in they apologized because i would have a longer wait, they had to remake my pizza... They were kind about it, offered me a free fountain drink while I waited and offered a 2 liter again once the pizza was ready. Nice gesture. Their prices are reasonable for the size of the slice. They also offer lots of premium topping choices that other pizza places don't offer."}
{"text":"Good pizza place. We ordered the 28 inch pizza. I loved the garlic crust."}
{"text":"Good but not impressed.   I live very close and have given them a couple of tries mostly because of all the raving Yelp reviews.  Pizza is good. Better than pizza hut or dominoes but not as good as Nello's or Venezia's.  They do have awesome garlic knots though. Definitely a must add to any order."}
{"text":"In town from San Diego for the weekend to go tubing.  On our way back to the hotel, we grabbed two pizzas and some garlic knots.  Everything was delicious and very affordable.  Thanks for a yummy dinner!"}
{"text":"We searched yelp for a new pizza place by our house. First time here. It was good. The wings were particularly good. Service was great they were super busy but the young guy at counter was polite and friendly. We would try it again. Excited about a local place!"}
{"text":"I have only tried the pizza by the slice but this place is perfect for when my husband and I can't agree on pizza toppings. We can each get a pizza by the slice and customize what we want. The slices are huge and delicious, especially dipped in ranch!"}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've had in recent memory. STAY AWAY. Total experience was very lackluster and for a restaurant rated 4 stars on yelp I'm VERY surprised at how truly bad it was. I really don't have anything good to say about them except the pizza did arrive hot and within the quoted time frame.  The pizza dipping sauce was FOUL for my garlic knots. It had this acrid taste that was like vinegar or spoiled beer. It was truly awful. The knots were super hot when they arrived, but they didn't have too much of a flavor. Very doughy tasting, not much garlic or parmesan.  The pizza itself... well, the toppings just slid off the pizza. There was zero volume or cell structure to the dough. I don't know if it was too old and the yeast had died, or they just didnt bake it long enough, but it was lousy.  The delivery driver was garbage, too. No customer service skills and probably didn't even speak English (is it too much to ask that you hire American citizens?) She just gave me a receipt to sign and dropped the pizza off without confirming my order. When I opened my garlic knots the dipping sauce had spilled inside the container, and my pizza was all smushed to one side where she had obviously let the box tip over.    They also didn't bother bringing paper plates or napkins even though I told them I was staying at a hotel room. The order taker on the phone was not particularly polite or engaging either.  It is worth repeating. WORST PIZZA I'VE HAD IN RECENT MEMORY. WOULD NEVER TRY AGAIN."}
{"text":"WOOOW.  That's the only word I can use to describe this place! Truly a family owned establishment with employee's that actually care. The single slice of pizza is 3.00, and was more than enough to fill me up. It tastes extremely delicious as well!  All in all, THE BEST pizza i've had in AZ so far, and the price makes it even better!"}
{"text":"First time I ordered from them was for delivery through Grub Hub.  I ordered several appetizers, pizza and salads.  They forgot half my order and had to re-deliver.  For my inconvenience I was given a coupon for a free pizza.  This time I ordered a pizza, salad and chicken strips for pick-up.  And yet again, they screwed up and gave me the wrong pizza.  When I informed them of this I didn't even get an apology, only an excuse that they were really busy and my pizza went out on someone's delivery.  They didn't even offer to fix the problem until I showed up with the wrong pizza and requested the right pizza, to which I was rudely told, \"Well, you're gonna have to wait.\"  Which is what I'm doing right now, although the kitchen staff seems too busy with their phones.  Unbelievable.  Never again.  And I asked for no peppers on my salad.  Looks like they just took a pre-made salad and picked off the peppers by hand as there were still a couple left in the salad."}
{"text":"We were there last weekend for the opening day of Spring Training. Apparently, so was everyone else. Every restaurant was packed. We decided to look for NY style pizza. We were delighted to find this place, and with awesome reviews to boot. Well, there is a reason for that. AWESOME cheese pizza. The guy behind the counter was extremely friendly, and the price was very inexpensive. Wish we lived in the area, as this place would be a regular stop for us."}
{"text":"We have been in town visiting family over the holiday, and we were feeling some pizza, so I saw that this place had great reviews. I now see why! We ordered a large pizza and wings special, which comes with a large one topping pizza and ten wings. Additionally, we had to try the ultra-hyped garlic knots and a 2 liter soda. On our pizza we chose sausage for our topping, and we decided to go with the Honey Hot sauce for the wings. First off, the pizza. The crust wasn't the best, but the cheese and sausage definitely made up for it. It was fresh and delicious, and had quite a lot of food for us to munch on. But the best part for me personally was the wings and the garlic knots. The wing sauce was frankly dynamite. It had just enough kick without being overbearing, and just enough sweet without being boring. I'd recommend them to anybody. And the garlic knots are honestly worth the hype. I knew we made a good choice when I opened the takeout container and there was a small pool of garlic butter at the bottom. They were perfectly seasoned, and went great with a little bit of pizza sauce and ranch. TL;DR: Badass pizza. Even more badass wings and garlic knots."}
{"text":"The pizza slice is big, and the crust is pretty good. Deducted a star because everything costs $1 to $2 more than the menu on their website. So they're either false advertising, or they've been too lazy to update their website in a couple of years.."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in town by far. Seriously I think they sprinkle something special on this pizza cause it's so good. The staff is always nice and it smells absolutely delicious when you walk in. There is a huge tv if you dine. Oh and did I mention the pie sizes are HUGE!!!! Just do your mouth a favor and go."}
{"text":"Ok, so it's my second 5 star review of Big Boys Pizza. I get it.  But I just have to post this. It's a moral imperative at this point.   Just ordered and wolfed down a bacon hamburger pizza. Simple enough, right?  Allow me, gentle reader, to paint you a mental image:  hand kneaded crust so golden brown the yearning (dare I say the needing?  Dare!  Dare!) is palpable. bacon so crispy-so delicious, and the hamburger so pervasive-so omnipresent one could hardly glimpse the cheesy awesomeness bubbling, oh so gently, underneath.    In a word: masterful!  Well played, Big Boys. Well played indeed."}
{"text":"What can I say about big boy. Ate there during their first month and I hated it. I really thought it was the worst pizza I had ever tasted. Several months later I thought I should give it another shot due to being so close to my apartment and I fell in love. No idea what changed since they first opened but I have a weekly tradition of going there and getting pizza and fries and I recommend it to anyone who will listen."}
{"text":"Update 7/5/15 I called to place an order using the Yelp check in special $19.99 for 1 extra large 1 topping pizza, 10 wings, 10 garlic knots and a 2 liter soda.   They informed me that they are not affiliated with Yelp and did not place the coupon on Yelp. They have been trying to work with Yelp to have it removed.  They're price for the package is $23.99+tax.     That's a pretty good deal so I ordered it. They were friendly both over the phone and when I picked up my order. They are still 5 stars in my book.   *****************************************************  This is my fav pizza place!  They serve pizza by the slice and whole pizzas.  The first time I went in I was not expecting the size a slice was.  When they say\"huge\" they mean it. One slice is about two and a half slices comparably.  The crust is thin,  the pizza cheesy and oh so good.   The staff friendly.  The dining area is small but never crowded. Most ppl pick up to go.  I've not ordered any other menu items so I can't comment.   Highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Dieters beware: Big Boys Pizza will be your worst nightmare.   ... Or dream come true. Hee hee hee!  Dude and I have only ordered twice from this place, but seriously some of the best pizza I've tried in the area.   Great price for a \"small\" two topping pizza.  Yes, these babies are MONSTERS!  Yes, it's rather greasy. In a good way of course. I warned y'all! Somehow though, both times the crust has been perfectly crisp and not soggy like you would expect.  Also, the employees here are hilarious.  Recommended. Now I have to remember to actually come back next time we want pizza!"}
{"text":"The pizza portions are huge and the price is fair. The only down side is that the seating area is small and they don't have a restroom for customers."}
{"text":"I'm done ordering my pizza from this place. We started going to Big Boys a few years ago but it's gone down hill. Whenever we order the pizza, whether it's slices or a full pie, it's never fully cooked. I have to finish cooking the pizza when I get back home, which obviously defeats the purpose of ordering take out. I've alerted staff of this before and they don't seem to care."}
{"text":"It's now Piece of Pizza! The original owners bought the place back and changed it up! It is the best pizza I've ever had! Great customer service and delicious food! My husband and I share a pepperoni pizza and get an appetizer or two. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Just okay.  I ordered the pizza well done, which it wasn't, but the manager insisted it was.  Why argue, it's after work and I want to go home.  The reheated leftovers were better the next day,  Think I'll just call Pizza Hut next time and spend about the same money without the travel."}
{"text":"I love this place. I refuse to have pizza anywhere else. The people are awesome, slices are huge! The tomato sauce is freaking fantastic, cheese is fantastic, pepperoni FANTASTIC!!!!"}
{"text":"Visiting Chandler on business and arrived on Super Bowl Sunday.  I needed to find someplace rather quickly to order pizza for a group of co-workers and found Big Boys.  They didn't deliver to my hotel because of distance but something convinced me to order a couple of jumbo sized pizzas anyway for carry out.  I must say that the pizza was very good and the size was perfect for our group.  Prices are good too - especially with the specials they have available for 2 pizzas at a time."}
{"text":"The slices here were probably the largest I have ever seen... EVER.  Not only were they big, they were delicious too!  I usually do not like crust, but their crust was wonderfully soft and flavorful.  You cant beat that, especially for only around 3.50 a slice."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, so amazing in fact that it persuaded me to finally make a Yelp! account just to spread the word. I love pizza, and in my opinion this is pretty much as good as it gets. And their prices can't be beat! Just had lunch there for $6, which got me a 2 topping slice as big as my head twice over, a drink, and a cone of ice cream (they have Thrifty by the way, delicious). Great service too. It helps that I live about two minutes from the place, but even if I eventually move, I'd still make the trip to frequent Big Boy's Pizza."}
{"text":"i've been ordering from this place for about a year. why? because they have great pizza! i usually have them deliver it to me, but i went to pick up my last order. they were friendly and timely. my go to place for great pizza!"}
{"text":"I have have this pizza delivered 5 times now and because of that I feel more than qualified to leave a review.   If you are in the mood for pizza and are trying to look past the chain restaurants, this is the place for you. It's not \"fancy-pants pizza\", as my brother in law states. It's just simple, cheesy, greasy, damn good pizza. It always comes steaming hot and the service is great."}
{"text":"OMG, Great. Looked like a hole in the wall and it took over a year to try it. Of course the Pizza was delish and inexpensive as others described, but the salads were amazingly fresh and good. What a find."}
{"text":"In town from Los Angeles yelped for pizza and VERY happy with the pizza we ordered!  The pizza, wings, and salad we're very good.  It was delivered promptly and customer service was excellent.  If your in town don't hesitate to try them;)"}
{"text":"Amazing! This is our \"go to\" pizza delivery spot. The toppings are always fresh and plentiful and the delivery is always prompt and courteous. Just like the other reviewer said, the appetizers are just as delicious. We always get either the fried mushrooms or zucchini and they are never soggy or cold. My only compliant is that they list many different flavors of thrifty ice cream on their menu but the last two times we've ordered it, we've received phone calls stating that they were out of what we wanted. No big deal, just a slight negative."}
{"text":"The Pizza and Garlic Knots are good. The Wings are breaded and below average. I am not a fan a breaded wings though.   WARNING: THEY WILL NOT HONOR THE YELP COUPON."}
{"text":"Small local pizza joint, big slices, good prices. Pizza made from individual orders, nothing setting around. Salad is a surprise, not your tossed green salad, it comes with shredded cheese sliced tomatoes, olives. Red cabbage, spinach  and the works.   Interesting there is no customer bathrooms unless you access it through the kitchen  and limited table seating with a lot of counter seating available.   Questionable clean forks and knives, my first knife was sticky.   Over all. Excellent pizza hot out of the oven with little lag time, salad a delightful surprise. Wish they had ice tea vs soft drinks. Excellent price and values can be found here, just a few quirks with bathroom and knivesand forks."}
{"text":"I am sad to revise negatively, but I just cannot believe my last experience with Big Boys. Let's see.. we ordered pizza at 12:30 pm on Wednesday. Big Boys said the pizza would be delivered in 45 minutes. An hour and a half later I called to see what was up because our pizza still had not arrived. The woman didn't have a reason, but offered a free 2 liter! Um no thanks, we already had 2 on the way with our original order. I asked if she would throw in some garlic knots, and she agreed. Almost another hour later and still no pizza! I called again, and the lady said it should be at my house in 7 minutes.. she gave me a few bucks off. Whatever. The pizza finally arrived, but with only one bottle of soda instead of the 2 we had ordered. The delivery guy tried to say he was taking money off.. and put $23.00 in the tip section of the receipt. This seemed shiesty to me so I made sure to scribble it out. I always always always talked these guys up, but now I will just go back to Venezias. Bummer, cuz the pizza is great. It's just too bad the other employees outside the kitchen can't seem to get it together."}
{"text":"Prices are great. Pizza is one of the best I have had in Arizona. Garlic knots are also top notch. Wings are average, hots are not even hot. Had issues with delivery services."}
{"text":"Super yummy pizza. We love the veghead. The garlic knots are good as well. Not greasy or over-oily like some other places."}
{"text":"Nice big slices of pizza. The combo deal is amazing, the pizza tastes good and the price is right."}
{"text":"This place has the biggest pizza I have ever seen! You have got to try the 28\" big boy :-) with friendly staff and fast delivery for a reasonable price I would definitely recommend this Big Boys Pizza to anyone"}
{"text":"The toppings are great and the variety is awesome but the crust is so mediocre that it would make Jeter cry for the real deal!! On another note, unless you plan on picking it up and eating at home don't even dare; the dining room is smaller than most convenience store bathrooms!!"}
{"text":"Best pie in town! Great service with quick delivery. I ordered a pizza around 9:30 the other night. They told me that they close in a half an hour and that they could not deliver. So the gentleman asked me where I live, I told him I live down the street, he then said I got you covered, I'll deliver it on the way home. Now, that's service!   I recommend this place, The pizza is great..Great neighborhood pizzeria.  They have a customer for life. 5 stars!!"}
{"text":"Believe the hype. This place is awesome. The slices they serve are utterly massive, it's hard to tell just how big they are in pictures, but trust me - one is a meal for almost anyone. The lunch specials are great - I had a 2-topping slice plus side salad & drink for $6.99. For that you get plenty o' pizza (very GOOD pizza, not just a lot of it), an excellent side salad made with a nice spring mix and extras like peppers, olives, tomatoes, and mozzarella. Counter peeps were super-nice, place was clean. Big Boys just made the lunch rotation, looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"We tried them on a whim, still on the hunt for \"back east pizza\". The garlic knots were good but the pizza was even better!  I eyed up the huge slice, I might have to try that next time. Great laid back friendly service and good food. Felt like a mom and pop Philly pizza parlor."}
{"text":"HUGE amounts of pizza! Very yummy! Much better than Venezias! We ordered the supreme, the meat lovers, the pineapple, and the pepperoni with wings and knots. My only critique would be that the knots were pretty chewy and could have been softer.. The ranch was amazing!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. That's a tough title to earn with Jimmy and Joes right down the street."}
{"text":"Not only did they provide super fast delivery, but this was the first pizza joint I could order ice cream to be delivered and it was super yummy!!  The pizza was good, can't complain...but that ice cream tho..."}
{"text":"So I really wanted to like this place but ..... The drive showed up with a tazer and preceded to charge it while standing next to my 2 year old nephew. (To show him). Then the antipasti salad was the worst I ever had. Lettuce was bitter and they give u ranch??  The pizza was cold and the wings were over breaded. They delivered fast and the soda was cold bit otherwise it was a bust"}
{"text":"False advertising at its finest, $19.99 checking offer that staff (and apparently management) refuse to offer. You should be ashamed of yourselves. First investigating the checkin offer was an absolute nightmare, well that's it I have very little respect for businesses that don't keep their online presence active or have the customer service to honor such offers. How is that my fault? This could be every other blue light special on the Internet with the same price and a different name. Not only is your staffs refusal to honor said deal disgraceful, you raise the price. Bravo on offering an actual deal periodically.   I'm really sad it's come to this, your pizza Is a reasonable product both in taste and value (I guess). I love the giant slices and huge (what is it 23\"?) pizza concept, hopefully I'll try it again.   My expectations for service and honorability  might be a bit, hope this clears up soon."}
{"text":"Loved my huge slice of pizza that was equal to at least two slices at other eateries. The mango habanero wings and lemon pepper wings were excellent! The wait was short, they offer great combo deals and the guys working there were great! Smiled, stuffed ourselves and complimented the excellent food. I'm from NY - first time out west I've gone to a place claiming NY style- THAT IS!"}
{"text":"I Actually enjoyed the pizza -- crust was amazing even had like a pretzel flavor too it I couldn't tell but tasted really good.. The chicken wings well not my fav.. either the texture or taste wasn't to my liking however there wing sauce and dips where really good."}
{"text":"Surprisingly delicious! I have always had great food and customer service here.   That paired with their awesome delivery makes this spot my go-to for pizza if im ordering in."}
{"text":"I happened to just walk in the joint out of curiosity one day with my mom. I ordered a big boy slice of pepperoni and even though my mom wasn't craving anything with bread, after I made he try a bite, we were both hooked and ended up ordering the 28\" pizza and the whole family was satisfied! The current owners is a nice little family that just make you feel comfortable.   This is definitely a place I will be recommending!!!!! Hands down this pizza is delicious and well priced!!!!"}
