{"text":"We ate here for the first time tonight because they were on the list for AZ Restaurant Week and not far from out house.  We were impressed when we first walked in - it was a cool modern vibe with a very large bar.  We decided to sit at the bar and eat there.  There was live music (Friday night) which was very nice.  We received our menus right away, but then it took awhile for someone to come back to get our drink order. After ordering, the bartender brought my wine, but had forgotten what my husband ordered.  He asked again for the Cherry Bomb.  She came back again later and said this was no longer available on the menu, so he instead ordered the Peachy Mule, which was delicious.  After bringing our drinks, the bartender asked if we wanted to order food- we said not quite yet, in a little while. That was a big mistake because she never came back.  We finally were able to call the bartender over to let her know we wanted to order food.  For the prices they charge, I find this level of service unacceptable. I also had to call a different bartender over to ask for a 2nd round of drinks and to ask for my water to be refilled.  It seemed like the 2 bartenders were not really helping each other out, like they each had their own set of customers. The best bar staff (in my opinion) was the woman who apparently had the job of washing glasses.  She filled my water later without my asking and also took our bill when we put it out with our credit card to pay. If she hadn't done that, who knows how long it would have sat there.  For the food, I ordered a salad and the salmon.  My husband ordered the chicken and fingerling potatoes.  They brought out everything at once.  It was very awkward to have my salad at the same time as the salmon.  The salad should have been brought out first. This was another example of poor service, especially for this level of restaurant, based on the prices. The reason I am giving 3 stars is because all of the food we ordered was very delicious. We also ordered the chocolate flourless cake to share as a dessert.  This was average as far as other chocolate flourless cakes I've had.... not the best.  During our time at the bar, there were 2 separate small groups of people at the bar wearing uniforms from the restaurant. I think it's fine for the staff to have a drink after their shift is over, but I don't think it's very classy for them to sit there wearing their uniforms. The restaurant should have a requirement that they change before sitting there.  Also, the bartenders seemed to be more attentive to them, then to the other customers (like us). My last comment is that the bartenders were not only inattentive, but they were also not friendly at all.  They weren't rude at all either, but it's always nice to have friendly bartenders who talk to you.  Without that, why would we ever want to come for happy hour?  It's too bad because I feel like this place has great potential, but the below average service at the bar made it so that we most likely will not be back again."}
{"text":"Wow, my wife and I went for our anniversary on a Sunday afternoon.  Fantastic creative dishes and drinks in an incredible setting. You have to check out what these young people are doing here.  Alfred, Michael, and John keep it up."}
{"text":"This is our first time here and we are so impressed with the food and service. My husband had the prime rib and I had the rack of lamb. Both served at the proper temperature. Wine reasonably priced. Beautiful setting looking out at Camelback and Mummy mountain. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Overall, we enjoyed our experience at Hearth 61.  I too was a little concerned I would be disappointed after reading some of the mixed reviews, and while there are some areas I think they need improvement on, overall, I would recommend and will go back.  Pluses:  -The setting, nice atmosphere, calm, relaxing, elegant but not \"uppity\". -Food, in our group of 4 we had a mix of entrees, the daily special (a pot roast, was told it was so/so), Salmon (excellent), Fish of the Day (excellent), and my choice the vegetarian option (blown away, rarely find a great veg dish at a place like this).  Shared A'La'Carte Sides; (Cauliflower, so/so), (Risotto - to-die-for), (Fingerling Potatoes - Good but nothing special).  We all shared the Bread Pudding for Dessert which was pure heaven!   -Wine List/Cocktail options a nice selection with good price points (decent wines for not overly expensive, especially for a resort, interesting cocktails, etc.).   -Nice bar area, large, comfortable (have a cocktail before or after your meal).  I even asked them to make me a \"custom\" cocktail that is not common and the bartender did his research and made it happen.   --Service (specific to the server only). We also had \"Sally\" as our server, she was attentive, knowledgeable, friendly, and made great suggestions.  Had it not been for Sally, there were other areas of service not quite as up-to-par as she was.   -Pricing - Quite reasonable overall, especially considering the location, quality, and that it is in a hotel/resort.    Not-So-Pluses (only #1 really):     -Other than \"Sally\" our server, the rest of the service was mediocre.  Food was VERY slow to come out (and not in a \"enjoy your meal European style\" just slow and it was not that busy that night).  Bussing was also slow and getting water refilled, etc. was not the best.  -Parking - You will see that they hotel charges $10 for guest parking (Valet) BUT just bring your valet ticket and the restaurant will take of it for you (you won't have to pay)."}
{"text":"What a beautiful renovation so sad the restaurant was just okay.    Service was so bad and the restaurant was empty .Glasses  of water un filled drinks on table and never was asked would you like another.  Server had a helper not sure why. No manager touched table to see how things were. Food was so  average and I'm being nice.  Reservation and hostess knew we were celebrating a birthday guess no one told waitress . Starters were good but that's all I would say.  I could go on but just not worth the visit with all these new restaurants in town skip this one. Stopped at end of meal and actually told Manager we would never give this another try."}
{"text":"Sally our server was awesome - just the right level of fun and knowledge of food/wine. The ambiance was solid with those views of Camelback.   Food was solid. Had the Tuesday Pork Roast with grain risotto and a glass of Pinot.   Do it!"}
{"text":"We visited Hearth 61 at the new Mountain Shadows of the first time on Sunday evening with friends.  We sat at a \"common table\" since there were four of us and we wanted to be able to visit with one another.  What we didn't know was that the door to the pool area was just at the end of our table.  People were coming and going through that door, some with only a swim suit on, during the entire time we were there.  It also seems that some of the staff is not well trained.  Our table had debris on it, and even after greeting us and bringing us water, our wait person did not wipe it down or seem to notice.  We finally asked if they would kindly bring a towel and wipe it down before our friends arrived.  We ordered the American Charcuterie board which was quite pricey, but very sparsely populated.  Unfortunately I don't think this will be a place we'll be frequenting."}
{"text":"If you're interested in a very slow, deliberate meal this is your place.  We were there for my father's birthday, ordered some wine, apps and entrees.  Other than bread and pesto, we saw no food for 45 minutes.  After the appetizers we waited another 45 minutes for our entrees.  Food quality was good, prices high, room loud without table privacy, and SLOW service.  Did not stay for desert.  Oh - and don't even think about self parking, it is valet only."}
{"text":"Even during construction the setting is excellent. View to Camelback across the pool is beautiful.   Nice menu selection,  although a bit pricey. Ambition to be one of the high end resorts... it's possible.    Very nice appetizers,  we had the tuna tartar and the harvest chop salad. Both very well executed.   Main course was the short rib pasta and the fiat iron steak.  Niman ranch is typically good and preparation here was very nicely done.  Short rib pasta was tasty,  but a little overdone. Smoky flavor was a bit more \"burnt\" than probably intended.    Desserts are always my favorite. The brown butter apple tart from the restaurant week menu was ok.  More tart than apple.  Little disappointing.   Our server Sally was a true delight.  Hope the management staff is smart enough to keep her around.   Not sure what is up with their open table interface,  but don't rely on the accuracy for table availability or seating preference.  With a little time, this could be a 5 star location.  For now,  4-."}
{"text":"What a big disappointment.  First, the area is a construction zone.  Mountain Shadows Resort is still under construction and it was very confusing to figure out where the restaurant is.  I'm truly wondering if the resort will make it.  Talk about a place that looks institutional, this is it, we thought we were pulling up to a hospital.  All the surfaces in the lobby and restaurant are hard, making it very loud.  The evening we were there the restaurant was nearly empty and we had trouble hearing one another.  The place is so austere looking, no warmth at all, not a place I'm interested in going to relax.  The food was good, menu is expensive, not anything to write home about for the price.  We had a table of four and only one of us said they would come back in the future. No value for the dollars spent."}
{"text":"Incredible food, impeccable service, and a lovely romantic setting!  Hearth '61 is ideal for celebrating a special occasion, as the menu is rather expensive (but rightfully so, because you get what you pay for!) We came here for dinner and then had breakfast the next morning. Both meals were perfection--our waitstaff was so helpful and made some great recommendations, and everything was cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful. My favorite from the dinner menu was the tenderloin filet, and my favorite from their breakfast menu is their waffle with fresh berries and sweet cream!"}
{"text":"The steak just melts in your mouth!  Probably one of the best steaks I've had in a VERY long time!  It beats most steakhouses! Only one small issue is to have the chef cut back on salt...otherwise everything was great!"}
{"text":"I was anxiously awaiting Hearth 61's opening and they did not disappoint! First of all the decor and the views are stunning! The Ahi salad was incredible; fresh flavors with the perfect amount of dressing. I did indulge in some crispy french fries and they were incredible- tip- dip them in the sauce they bring you for the bread! I can't wait to go back for dinner!"}
{"text":"We went for a work lunch a few weeks ago. The resort is beautiful. You can tell they are wrapping up some of the last minute touches, but the overall look is great! I love mid-century modern. The food was delicious. I ordered the burger. The serving was perfect (maybe even more than I could eat!) Service was fast and friendly. Need to try the desserts next time!"}
{"text":"I went to Hearth 61 in March of this year, which is the high tourist season in the Valley of The Sun! I went to Hearth 61 with friends because the resort is new and we wanted to see the new resort and new houses. The resort setting is lovely with spectacular views of Camelback Mountain.   Unfortunately the setting and the views did not compensate for the poor experience at the restaurant. We were seated outside at a dirty table with food left on the chairs. We got the table cleaned and then we waited and waited for someone to show up with menus and water. The waiter finally brought bread but we had to ask for napkins and silverware which seemed to be an irritant to the wait staff. We finally got our food after a long wait. One friend had a salad that appeared to have no dressing, tired lettuce and she had to hunt for the chicken that was supposed to be on the salad. I had a sandwich which appeared to be made ahead of time and was tired, but okay.No one ever came to see if we needed anything or followed up.   Hearth 61 is supposed to be an upscale place to eat but I was very disappointed in the service, quality and price. As a result I will not go back or recommend it to friends."}
{"text":"What a magical experience.  I am so surprised by the previous comments regarding poor service as that was not our experience at all.  We had a 5:30pm reservation and due to the rain and traffic, we were running late.  We called to let the hostesses know and they were beyond understanding and accommodating.  Everyone we came in contact with from the valet to our server, Daniel (who was just awesome!) was so friendly and efficient.  The food was incredible.  It was a bit pricey, but honestly - worth every cent.  We ordered the Valentine's menu and each course was superb.  Even our pre-dinner cocktail was unique and delicious.  If you have an occasion to celebrate or just want to treat yourself to a wonderful dining experience - I highly recommend Hearth '61!"}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars because the manager made an attempt to fix the evening for us, but still left us quite disappointed.  We arrived and were seated outside. A nice view overlooking the pool and mountain, however, construction employees should not be allowed to be walking through the pool area, especially at 7pm.  We were greeted by two servers, they were confused as to who should take our table, but it was quickly resolved.  A side note- servers should NOT be allowed to wear cologne or perfume...it's overwhelming and gross when you're trying to eat.    We started off with appetizers, a burrata for me that was awful- literally two balls on the plate with  a dry beet and dry salad greens, nothing else. No seasoning, no drizzle of balsamic, nothing.  The burrata had been sitting out too long and had a thick crust on one of the pieces- yuck.  My husband's flatbread however was delicious and perfect.  We then waited an hour for our main meal and thought our server went home for the evening....we finally saw a manager walk by and asked if he could track down our dinners.  They came out two minutes later...ice cold.  Had we not been starving, I would have sent them back, but we would have had to find our server to do so.  The Short Rib Angolotti was very good however, as were my husband's scallops.  The risotto was inedible unfortunately- it was crunchy and completely flavorless.  When the server finally came over to ask how our meals were I was honest and said we were disappointed, especially with how long we had to wait.  She immediately got the manager who came over and tried to make things right....that's where it got confusing.  We explained that we understood it was a new opening and that glitches occur, but we just wanted to be honest about our experience.  He was very nice and said to my husband as he tried to pay- \"Put your credit card away, the meal is on me.\"  He then said \"I want to get your name and address so we can invite you back again; wait a minute and I'll get a piece of paper for you to it write on.\"  We waited another 10 minutes and the server comes back with a bill for us!  No paper to write our address on, but a business card of the manager....She said \" the manager took off your entrees for you, sorry your meal was cold.\"  Ummmm, what happened to \"put your credit card away\" ??  Just wanting to leave, we paid the bill and left- wasn't worth making a stink over it.    So many amazing restaurants in the area....they've got some work to do here.  Another side note-  a couple was seated next to us that came with a dog, a Weimareiner!  While it was realtively well-behaved, we had to listen to it drag its retractable leash on the ground and shake its collar tags throughout our meal.  I love dogs, but this was completely inappropriate and shouldn't have been allowed."}
{"text":"Just returned to Hearth 61for a second visit and had a nice lunch.  Both of us enjoyed the Ahi Tuna Salad.  Service seems much improved. Such a lovely room with gorgeous views! Will return soon!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!! Great food, service and wine! Sarah was our phenomenal waitress. I highly recommend you ask for her. She made our anniversary dinner even more special with fantastic recommendations on everything from our main course to wine and dessert. The Branzino was outstanding and the salmon was really good too. The food was so good, we ate their a second night. The second night my husband and I tried the beef. We had the tenderloin of beef and short rib agnolotti...amazing! We had Belle Glos Pinot Noir and Peanut Butter Mousse for dessert. It was a night to remember. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. Bon Appetite!"}
{"text":"Dined in here for dinner for the second time last night and ate here again for brunch this morning-Hearth never fails to impress us! We stayed at the Mountain Shadows resort for a quick stay-cation for Memorial Day weekend. Everything from service, presentation, ambiance, food, cocktails-amazing. The tuna tartar was one of my favorites, the steak was cooked perfectly. The shrimp ceviche was very refreshing and a good dish to share for an appetizer. The banana and ricotta pancakes for brunch was to die for! The servers and support staff were very professional and friendly. Great wine and food knowledge. Definitely will be back and bringing more friends and family!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food!! Great service. Everything is supplied by local farms and is organic. Fresh, unique and nice atmosphere. I've been twice. Last night the music in the bar was a little too loud but it was still a Superior dining experience!!"}
{"text":"What an amazing experience!  We decided to venture out on our typical Tuesday date night. We stumbled into the Hearth 61 bar, had dinner and enjoyed the company of the super friendly bar staff.  We even happened upon my favorite chef in the Valley Mr. Chuck Wiley. What a great night thank you Mountain Shadows for making my Typical Tuesday into a Terrific Tuesday"}
{"text":"I take it all back, Hearth '61 totally redeemed themselves. Management had reached out to me after our brunch experience and invited me and my husband to return for dinner to give them a second chance. From start to finish it was fabulous. We chose the duck confit for our appetizer per our server's recommendation, it was tender, the sauce was flavorful and the buttered Noble bread completed the dish. We were also given complimentary warmed Noble bread with a nice basil pesto and an amuse bouche of stuffed squash blossoms. For our entrees we chose the brown butter roasted Branzino, beef tenderloin and sides of the ancient grain risotto and broccoli. Both were cooked perfectly and were large in portion. The tenderloin melted in your mouth and puts a lot of the other steak restaurants to shame and the Branzino was flaky and buttery. We also really enjoyed the sides, the risotto was rich and creamy and stayed warm in a Cassoulet serving dish, the ancient grains gave it some nice texture, and the broccoli had a flavorful shallot parmesan sauce. For dessert I took a risk and ordered the bread pudding (which I'm not typically and fan of) and then also went for a safe bet with the molten lava cake. The bread pudding changed my mind about bread pudding, it had a delicious whiskey caramel sauce with brown butter ice cream and wasn't dry at all like other bread puddings I've had. The molten lava cake was awesome too, it was served with a black cherry ice cream and luxardo cherries which was a perfect combo. Service was on point the whole time, very attentive and our server made some great recommendations and was very knowledgeable about the food. It was overall a great evening and dining experience, and that tenderloin was seriously one of the best steaks I've had. I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I love when westroc opens a new hotel and restaurant. Their style and design is always too notch, and I always know that the restaurant is going to be amazing because chuck Wiley is in charge. His food is delicious and his staff is always trained amazingly. I have dined here twice and loved it both times. The Burata cheese was amazing. So fresh and delicious. I also ate the tuna salad and it was one of my all time favorites. I added more dressing to it than is standard. Our server was knowledgeable and excited to help us. I plan to take. Large group there after they finish completing the build. This restaurant will definitely be a staple in Lincoln and in pv."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in for a drink at the bar before heading out to dinner this weekend.  We were excited to check out the new Mountain Shadows Resort after so much anticipation of it being built.  The bar area is very nice and looks out onto the pool...kind of surprising that they didn't take advantage of the beautiful views of Camelback Mountain.  The bartenders were friendly and they had a decent selection of wines by the glass.  I ended up with a glass of rose and enjoyed it.  Excited to staycation some time and really enjoy the whole experience!"}
{"text":"Four of us were at hearth 61 for the first time this evening. Since the restaurant is relatively new we did not have high hopes for a meal but we were all extremely pleased with every aspect of the food and service! The highlights of our meal included the amazing scallops which are perfectly prepared with delightful flavors and vegetables and grains along with it. The Ahi tuna tartare appetizer was spectacular.  Other meals which we found delightful included the short rib stuffed pasta and the ancient grains vegetarian meal.   We found the service was excellent with attentive and knowledgeable yet fun staff without being over bearing and stuffy. And of course the view from our table of the pool and Camelback Mountain were fantastic. We highly recommend Hearth 61 and are sorry we didn't try it soon or after its opening."}
{"text":"Truly loved this place! Tried it during restaurant week ! Great value and exceptional food/service/ambience! The patio seating looks out over the pool and Camelback mountain. The bread from Nobu along with the pesto sauce is amazing and the amuse bouche from the chef was a nice touch! The drinks were strong! The duck, ceviche, and short rib ravioli are worth coming back for! All around a very pleasant dining experience! Going back tomorrow for breakfast."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best meals we've had. Everything was beyond delicious, and the service was impeccable all around. The duck confit, beet salad with orange dressing, and short rib agnolotti were each stupendous. Even their warm, crusty bread with pesto and salmon amuse bouche were best in class. Evidently their kitchen and menu have improved over the last 6 months to earn a place on your \"must visit\" list while in the Scottsdale area.   Daniel, our waiter was also attentive and gracious.   Loved our experience overall in this hip and delicious restaurant."}
{"text":"Our waitperson was so knowledgeable!  I ended up ordering the short ribs based on her recommendation was spot on. Clean,new, modern and great al fresco dining."}
{"text":"After reading some mixed reviews about this place, I found myself looking for dinner, and finally took the plunge with Hearth...I'm so happy I did! The ambiance for me was great. I loved having a view of the mountain while eating. As for the meal...  Sally started us off by going over the menu, and she was such a joy. I loved her honesty, and her passion for the menu. She had a few recommendations and I'm pretty sure I ordered them all?   I started with a cherry bomb cocktail that was so drinkable you could definitely get into trouble drinking a few. I loved the presentation and that isn't wasn't overtly sweet.   The next course was the heirloom tomato salad and the burrata salad, both were delicious. The burrata had grapefruit/pistachio, good, but the tomato/panzanella salad was so delicious. Definitely something I wanted more of.  If you order one thing, one thinggg! It must be the braised short rib agnolotti! They come with a bit of horseradish cream that makes you not want to share.   The next thing ordered was the rack of lamb with a lemon preserve, which was medium rare and perfectly cooked. I also ordered a side of cauliflower, which, I think I might've been able to do without honestly. But I couldn't turn down golden raisins!   Dessert was the bread pudding and also a side of the blood orange gelato. I definitely enjoyed both!   I will definitely be back (happy hour looks amazing) and service was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Scallops and steak was to die for. Wasn't feeling the vibe but went for dinner and the food was on point. Everything was so good and fresh! Will be coming back next weekend bar and dinner service was amazing! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Came back to Hearth '61 tonight for our first dinner experience there and had a fabulous time! Sally took care us of and I highly recommend her. She was charismatic, funny, and relatable. She also pointed us towards some excellent food and drink recommendations. For cocktails, we had the Peachy Mule, a fun take on the classic, and the Cherry Bomb, a drink that reminded us of something we  drank in the Caribbean that we couldn't get enough of! For starters we tried the burrata and beet salad, and the duck confit. I'm a sucker for both burrata and beets so I was thrilled with my choice. The duck confit is a dish I think we will return for on its own when the mood strikes- it was so delicious. Duck, a gravy, bread, potatoes- it literally melted in your mouth. So Good. For entrees we got the scallops and the lamb. Both phenomenal. To pretend to be healthy we also got the broccoli side, of which, my vegetable hating husband ate nearly all of. Then there was dessert... because what is date night if there isn't dessert? The raspberry lavender panna cotta was the perfect light note to end it all. I highly recommend Hearth '61 for dinner, whether it be a special occasion, date night, or a Tuesday where you feel like being treated well in a beautiful atmosphere with fantastic staff. The chef Mr. Wiley came out to our table and he too was just an awesome individual with quite a vision for the menu and your dining experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"I had heard about this place from a few friends of mine. Decided to check it out. I sat down and was promptly greeted by Sam the bartender (Like from cheers!). He recommended the salmon bites, I went with it and they were amazing. Fried perfectly with a great flavor. Sam was an awesome bartender and I will definitely be back because of him and the whole experience."}
{"text":"We came by Hearth '61 during a staycation at Mountain Shadows for our first anniversary. Service at first was a little short/cold, but here's what we ordered:  Starters - we got apps from the lounge food menu! Chips a guacamole and queso were very good. We also ordered a rum punch cocktail and a martini.  Mains - the roast beef prime rib (Saturday special) and the filet. Both could not have been cooked more perfectly at a medium rare, just fantastic. ?We split these and nabbed the fries as a side. The dipping sauces were SO good. We then ordered another round of drinks which did not come till we got the bill, so they kindly took care of that for us.  Dessert - the brown butter apple tart was on the dry side but we enjoyed the ice cream that came with it."}
{"text":"I just made my first visit to Hearth '61. Because of the construction going on at the Mountain Shadows resort, it's a bit difficult to find the entrance. That said, once I did find it, the valet was exceptionally friendly and I found my way right in for lunch.  The interior decor is beautiful and modern and the views of Camelback Mountain are stunning. My friend, who I was dining with, had been there before and suggested the ahi tuna salad. She ordered a chopped salad. Our service was terrific and they clearly cared that we were having an enjoyable time. We were one of only two tables there at lunchtime but that is probably due to the newness and the construction.  My ahi salad itself was a bit disappointing. The tuna was fresh and plentiful and it was served on a bed of Napa cabbage with cashews - the description made it sound like a good combination. The problem was the green goopy dressing that was everywhere! My salad was literally lathered in it. It didn't have a lot of flavor, sort of seemed like green mayonnaise and it really spoiled what would've otherwise been a terrific salad.  I will definitely go back and try again and would love to see what they do for happy hour. I just won't order that salad again."}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast in town. I've had many waffles but these ones stand out. Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. The cast iron Green chili pork is also delicious! Must try this restaurant!  Did I mention the brunch that's ALL WEEKEND?"}
{"text":"My wife and I recently stopped in to enjoy \" happy hour\" and to see this new Scottsdale venue. Sadly, first impression was not favorable. The bar/restaurant was not too busy at around 4pm and appeared the bar staff was on shift change. There were probably five gentlemen behind the bar more interested in talking to each other than assisting customers.   After waiting about 5 minutes, waived down one of the bartenders and asked about ordering drinks and see \"happy hour menu\". Not much of a draft beer selection but they did offer prosecco for my wife. The bartender did not introduce himself and continued to talk with the rest of the staff while we were interested in ordering some food. We saw a few other customers at the bar having this same concern so not just us.    The venue itself is very promising but not impressed with initial bar server. One of the other bartenders did take over and was much better/more attentive but by that time we decided to close out the check and move on to another restaurant. As they say, first impression is most important so doubtful we'll be back."}
{"text":"I'm an \"Old School\" diner who lives nearby and hadn't been yet because the ultra modern architectural style just turned me off. The restaurant deserves a 10 however for the food and service. Ambiance was \"hotel bar lounge\" loud but the food was amazing. Really amazing."}
{"text":"Dined here last night with family. Honestly I can hardly even remember what I had!  Oh yes, the scallops. They were nice. Dessert was a chocolate lava thing or a strawberry something. We had both. The strawberry was delicious!  I wanted this place to blow me away!!!  It did not!   The waiter was obviously experienced, but he was intrusive and made us feel rushed. I don't know why he cleared the plates before we were finished. The place was NOT busy!  Anyway,  this posh restaurant has plenty of potential, just not there yet. Please Hearth, strive for something more!  Something special, worthy, and exclusive!!!!  Teach your wait staff to NEVER pick up a plate unless everyone is finished. It is RUDE!  I will try again in six months. (Because I know by then, you will be great or you will be gone!). Yes, I have been harsh, but honest."}
{"text":"Food was average but the reason for the 1 star is the service. Our waiter brought our food then went to bar tend. We've been waiting for a check for about 20 minutes. The hostess pretended to do something and said he was coming soon. Still waiting, now he's just avoiding eye contact."}
{"text":"One of my favorite visits while in Scottsdale. I mean, step out on their outdoor patio and grab a seat. You're going to get a beautiful view Camelback Mountain, especially at sunset. If you pay close enough attention, you can get a few nice views of the pool.  Our waiter recommended we take advantage of their restaurant week special, $41 for the three course meal. I had the pork croquet, amazing, followed by salmon, equally amazing, and ended with a chocolate torte cake, oh so worth the calories. My friend had the steak for his dinner and shared a bite... all I can say is wow.  Especially when the weather is great (when is it isn't in Scottsdale?), sir outside and enjoy the view. Even if you sat inside, it's beautiful there. It's sleek and sleek. I especially like seeing how you can the chefs preparing the dishes.  I loved this experience."}
{"text":"The only thing that made me give 2 stars is that the food was delicious, but not enough to bring me back to dine again. The service on the other hand was some of the worst I have experienced. We had dinner on a Friday night and the service was unbelievably slow, which made no sense as the restaurant was pretty dead, only about 5 other tables dining during our entire time there. We could see servers standing around near the kitchen, yet we just sat waiting for everything. There was way to much wait time between finishing one course and waiting for the next to arrive. At the end of the meal it was even hard to get our server to take our dessert order after she had brought coffee.    My other disappointment has to do with the amenities. As a parent of a toddler I was disappointed because the family bathroom was closed due to maintenance issues and there was no other option for diaper changing. I had to resort to lying my child down on the floor in one of the bathroom stalls. Not something then any mother wants to do."}
{"text":"We did a little staycation for Mother's Day and knew we wanted to try Hearth '61 but wanted to make sure our five year old was on his best behavior. We started in the lounge which had live music and great drinks. The bartender whipped up some delicious blue cheese olives for my dirty which was very kind of him. We ordered a grilled cheese and fries from the kids menu for the little guy and it was outstanding....so tasty i'm not sure he fully appreciated it, but mom and I did. The fries are super thin, piping hot and crispy and tossed with parmesan and herbs. Overhearing us talk about wanting to try the full restaurant, the lounge server brought us a menu for Hearth '61. One glance told us this was a meal we didn't want to miss....and our son was very content after his grilled cheese so a relaxing meal seemed likely. *We would normally not bring our kid to a nice restaurant like this and would never want to inconvenience others, but the staff were great with him....and he was on his best behavior the entire time.  After being sat, we perused the wine list (great selection and price range) and were then taken through some highlights of the menu by our server, John. I am not sure I've ever had someone be so descriptive about a menu before. He was able to tell us about every dish and not just what was written on the menu.  We started with a half dozen oysters that were incredibly fresh, the perfect size and came with a very nice mignonette with shallots alongside. I ordered the filet with a red wine reduction and blue cheese sauce. It was a medium rare that I can only get with a sous vide at home...absolutley perfect. My wife had the whole roasted branzino which was equally good. I was especailly impressed with how simple the preparation of the fish was. Nicely seasoned and with an olive relish it was evident they were using quality ingredients and didn't feel the need to overpower either dish with sauces.  Our son had a molten lava cake that they brought out with our entrees and no one else got a bite so I would say it was good.   We greatly enjoyed our stay at Mountain Shadows and after seeing how fun the lounge is and the quality of food coming out of the kitchen at Hearh '61, we will be back."}
{"text":"I didn't have very high expectations for a newly opened restaurant inside a hotel. However, I was completely blown away by how amazing our meals were. We decided to stay at Mountain Shadows for Memorial weekend staycation. For the sake of convenience, we decided to stay on site and check our Hearth 61.   A few details that can really go a lob game way...I can always appreciate when a restaurant offers a black napkin instead of their usual white when you are wearing dark clothes! The hostess saw that I was pregnant and offered a pillow for my back which was very sweet.  They happened to be participating in restaurant week so my group opted for that. They start you with toasty bread and pesto as well as a small tasty amuse-Bouche. We all started with either the flatbread, burrata, or ceviche. All we delicious. For the entree, I had the filet which was superb. I sampled my husbands short rib pasta with horseradish and the flavors were incredible. Lastly, we enjoyed the bread pudding and lava cake which were both exceptional. Highly impressed with the food at this new restaurant!"}
{"text":"This is the new restaurant in the rebuilt Mountain Shadows Resort. It is beautiful with fantastic mountain views from each direction. The service is what you would expect from a new place. Eager beavers trying to please,but rarely happens. That is because of lack of training. The apps are a strong point. We liked the Tuna Tartare and Duck Confit crostini. The mains were just fair. Strangely, the Branzino tasted like Trout.  And the Guinea Hen tasted like Chicken. Will try again."}
{"text":"We recently visited Hearth '61 for dinner. I could not have been happier with the experience. The ambiance is great and the seating is comfortable. We were greeted and seated immediately and our server was welcoming and knowledgeable.   They offer a wide variety of dishes and between our table of 4 we tried a good portion of them ranging from seafood to steak and several of the appetizers. My personal favorites were warm duck confit and ahi tartare under the appetizers and the moroccan spiced rack of lamb and scallops under entrees. They also had excellent oysters.  Each course was served at the exact right moment and each dish they brought was amazing.     I highly, highly recommend that you visit the restaurant during your stay, or if you're a local just for a night out - It was absolutely the highlight of our stay there."}
{"text":"Hearth '61 is located inside the beautiful Mountain Shadows luxury resort.  The place when I went is still under construction, but the restaurant and pool is open.  The place kind of has that retro Rat Pack feel and look.  I came with friends to check out their brunch menu and have a few drinks.  Menu is definitely a modern American fare; some healthy and some not so much!  I started with a Bloody Mary to wet my palates.  I have to say it was a perfect mix of sweet, sour, and amount of spice!  Great start!  For my food I went for the Banana Ricotta Pancakes with a side of sausage; later I was told they ran out of sausage so I changed to their ham.  Needless to say, I loved it!  Bits and piece of pistachio and bacon was sprinkled on the pancakes while chunks of ricotta cheese was layered within the pancake.  The warm caramel syrup was perfect and blanket the pancakes at just the right amount!  My friends, however, had a different experience.  Their Green Chili Pork's eggs came over-cooked (I had 2 friends that ordered this dish and both were over-done) and the Belgian Waffle was pretty basic.  Moreover, we complained about both my friend's eggs, which they were quick to say they would replace.  However, replacing it took some time....a little too long.  We were pretty much done eating before my two friends began eating.  In the end, it wasn't so much the food was bad it was just the service wasn't up to speed.  I didn't feel there was much communication going on since the servers seem to be left on their own serving and cleaning off tables.  I get the oversight of the cooked eggs, but that shouldn't take long so I'm not sure where there was a hiccup. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Mountain Shadows for a staycation getaway for our 15th anniversary and decided to give Hearth '61 a try.  Our server, Sally was awesome!  We started with the duck confit appetizer. This was very tasty but a bit overpriced for what you get. We enjoyed it but again, not worth the price. Our entrees were both outstanding.  My husband had the short rib agnolotti. DELICIOUS. Tastiest pasta dish we've had in a long time. Filled with delicious, tender short rib and served with a horseradish creme.  I had the scallops and they were also amazing. 4 scallops for 35 bucks which is a bit steep but they were fantastic. Charred perfectly on the edge and so rich and yummy.  They gave us a dessert for our anniversary and we picked the bread pudding.  Very tasty.  We also enjoyed a pretty decent bottle of Bordeaux. We will likely return."}
{"text":"Hearth isn't your typical hotel/resort restaurant, they are refreshingly creative, consistent and execute well. It's inside the mid-century vibed Mountain Shadows resort but you don't have to stay there to eat there.  Why go there: It's got professional staff waiting on you and cooks who care about the food that come out, the service has always been consistent. I have been there for about 4 meals now, and each time they have outdone themselves whether it was a full house or just a few 4 tops. They are great for lunches if you are having a business lunch, their options for lunch are fresh yet hefty and the kitchen seem to be eager to please with altering anything on their menu.    Don't miss: Their salads are plenty for two to share, add some protein to it and you have a hefty lunch.  The desserts are outstanding.  Overall: The restaurant is bright and open, the staff is smiley and the food is good and seasonal. Hard to beat that when the team executes in unison with the beautiful setting that Hearth '61 occupies at Mountain Shadows, dining room or patio."}
{"text":"We were a group of eight here for dinner last Thursday.  Our table was a gorgeous piece of wood near the bar area and gave us a really nice view of Camelback Mountain.  Our cocktails were very good and they had a nice wine list.  The food was just OK.  My girlfriend and I split the beef tenderloin and an order of roasted cauliflower.  I ordered the beef medium rare and it came out medium plus.  They must have split the beef portion before it was cooked and that was why the smaller pieces were overcooked.  Our other friends thought their food was OK but not particularly memorable.  There were two times that one of my friends had to get up to find the server to get another drink and the water refills were definitely lagging.  This might be a better place for drinks and appetizers than a full blown meal.  Maybe they'll get better in time."}
{"text":"No response yet from the restaurant. Quite surprising given the other negative reviews they've had. Certainly not the kind of service I'd expect from a new high-end hotel property."}
{"text":"This gem is located in the newly built Mountain Shadows resort, which is a sister property of Sanctuary and shares the same chef as Elements for all you fans out there! The construction is so new you can still smell the new construction. Everything about the hotel is very sleek, clean, and modern so of course the restaurant shares this type of interior design. The restaurant offers normal indoor and outdoor dining, high-tops, bar, and living room seating. Whatever your mood, you have options. We requested the outdoor patio, located by the pool with Camelback Mountain in the backdrop. The whole aesthetic of this place is picturesque!  We came here on a weekend evening and had a reservation, but I suspect I would not need one for the future.  There were few dinner parties but most patrons were at the bar. My party was seated immediately by the hostess and our server John followed shortly after. He wasn't the warmest person, but he displayed expert knowledge of the menu items and did his job well. He took time to explain the menu, giving us recommendations and explaining particular items. He was very engaging and even took time to clarify certain flavors with the chef. Everyone else did a great job as well. Our drinks were constantly filled, and our table clean. Service here is superb.  Now for the food. I ordered the duck confit and rack of lamb for myself but was able to try other items. My favorite were the duck confit, lamb, and Vanilla Lavender Panna Cotta. Duck can sometimes taste too boring and bland, but the chef did a great job flavoring the duck. It was essentially shredded and placed over slices of bread with the ratio generously in favor of the duck. The lamb had a preserved lemon and mint puree that was a perfect complement to the lamb. Even without the lemon/mint, the lamb itself was an impressive soft and tender inside, combined with a perfect crunchy exterior. I don't know how to describe it other than the best lamb I've ever eaten. As for the Panna Cotta, it was rich but not overwhelmingly, and its texture with just right. If you're looking to eat some food, I recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"This place definitely feels like a hotel restaurant. Food was actually pretty good, though on the pricey side.   - Started off with thick slices of a yummy bread and pesto sauce. - Green salad ($12) with goat cheese and sliced apples was fine. Nothing special and they forgot the radishes. - Burrata was nice and creamy with a few slices of beet and maybe two citrus wedges. Tasty, but not sure I'd order it again for $17. - Scallops ($34) came with 4 pieces, nicely cooked, 3 mushrooms, and a few tablespoons of barley. Again, the dish was tasty, but not very much food for the price. - Roasted branzino ($29)- this was the best dish of night, though you can't really go wrong when the dish is topped with brown butter. - Side of roasted cauliflower ($9)- also very good with plump golden raisins - Chocolate mouse for dessert ($9)- sweet and good for sharing, loved the caramelized bananas on top.  Overall, good food if you are staying here, don't want to leave the hotel, and can afford resort prices."}
{"text":"We stopped off here for a drink at the bar before dinner and the place is very upscale with great views of Camelback Mountain. The service here was not good. Plain and simple. We sat at an almost empty bar and were not given a drink menu or even acknowledged by the bartenders (there were two of them) for at least 15 minutes. When they eventually got around to asking what we wanted, we ordered a couple of their signature drinks. It then took another 10 minutes to make the drinks. The drinks were very tasty, which saved this place from a lower rating.   Overall: Good drinks, poor service, very pricey. Can definitely find better in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"They did an excellent job on the renovation here! Walking in the main lobby and seeing the lit-up tee-pee against Camelback Mountain was a great start. The views are amazing! We walked down to Hearth '61 for dinner...our waitress was great. She was super knowledgeable of the foods and even explained where the name \"Hearth '61\" came from. The restaurant itself is very trendy but with an awesome ambiance. We used the Travelzoo coupon, which is a great value and had no issues using it. Salmon and scallops were both very tasty, not my favorite that I've had in AZ, but definitely good. Bread pudding was excellent (our waitress recommended it). I would go pack, great date night spot."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely delicious. We had the oysters, ahi tartare, tenderloin of beef, cauliflower, and risotto. Personally, I love the ambiance and decor. It's sleek and modern - it all makes Hearth '61 stand out from the rest. Love the open kitchen, too. Hearth '61 is brand new on the scene, so it wasn't very crowded when we went. I look forward to it becoming more popular!"}
{"text":"Stop looking for a place to eat and go here!!! I have never in my entire life had a dinner that every single thing that came out was the best I'd ever had until tonight. The Duck Confit is what they serve in the Elysian Fields, I swear to you it's heavenly. Just go: I can't even. It's just SO good. C. Wiley does it again!!"}
{"text":"First off this place is very hard to find as you can't see any street side signage. But the decor is very modern. A great place for a date or for conversation. the food was very tasty especially the ahi tartare which was a very healthy serving. we also had the rack of lamb which was delicious. Everything was served ala carte.  the desserts left a little bit to be desired and our server was a bit over friendly. Overall a great place that I would try again."}
{"text":"Utterly disappointed. Chuck Wiley wasn't on premises on a Saturday night. We were served mozzarella in a salad that was spoiled. My prime rib was so salty it was almost inedible. One past the crust it was grizzly. Just not good food.  Let alone fine dining. Do not go!"}
{"text":"We want Hearth '61 to succeed, because we like the resort and its sister resorts and we live nearby.  Unfortunately, the food and service are not there yet.  Please fix this!  Three of us just ate breakfast.  The food was not bad, but it was not that good.  The omelette with sun-dried tomatoes and goat's cheese was pretty good, the high point--but still was not somehow \"integrated\".  The organic preserves for the toast were good, though barely enough.  In general, portions were too small, much smaller than comparable restaurants nowadays.  Eggs need to be served with salsa or something else on the side, not just as-is.  Breakfast potatoes need to have some taste, such as adding onions and peppers or spices, they are currently very bland.  Schreiner's sausage is a good idea, but it was cut in half and overcooked, taking away some flavor and the aesthetic appeal and character of a whole sausage.  Water and iced tea need be refilled quickly, without being asked.  The only fast thing about the service was the bill being brought, which sends a weird message when that seems to be the main service priority.  Valley Ho and Sanctuary are great, and I have faith that you will get your act together, but please make improvements faster than you are doing.  Would love to go back and boost my rating!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Beautiful mountain backdrop, impressive property and excellent food- the perfect combination for a special dinner.  Did not expect such a great night, but Hearth61 really delivered.  The tuna appetizer was lightly washed in a luscious citrusy marinade and served with house made rice puff crackers that rocked!  Duck confit was savory and rich - no idea how it was prepared but it was delicious.  Definitely will be back on the next trip."}
{"text":"Tough to give this new restaurant an outstanding review because of the poor quality of service our waitress gave us, but the menu and food may bring us back.  (The two young women who served us bread, water, etc., were truly outstanding and even gave us more relevant and enthusiastic information about dishes than did our disinterested waitress - how can we tip just them?!) But back to the food.  Very interesting menu with decent variety and forward-thinking pairing of ingredients.  The squash soup is to die for - I'd return just for that.  The roasted Brussels Sprouts Caesar salad was an admirable effort, but the dressing needs more pop.  The Brussels Sprouts were good, but I think I'd rather them hot and roasted.  The lemon grass chicken had a very nice coconut curry accompaniment, and was reasonably priced.  The spare rib agnotti was very flavorful - definitely something a meat lover would love without being over-the-top with meat, so somebody who mere.y likes meat would enjoy it as well.  The scallops were delicious and perfectly prepared.  The special was pork roast in a pineapple chutney- out of this world good.  The pork was roasted just right - still moist and perfectly paired with the chutney.  We really enjoyed the cauliflower polenta (which had to be re-ordered because our waitress entered the wrong side); the incorrectly delivered canaloni bean ragou seemed fine, but I didn't think it had much flavor (I'll admit to not being a fan of large white beans).  So the food was foodie-good, the ancillary waitstaff (and managers, who visited us twice because our waitress was struggling to get things right) were terrific and the ambience was really nice. We'll try to make it back."}
{"text":"OK folks this is a pretty cool place that has potential but service is lacking,food is inconsistent and I don't like to wait forever for my food and when I gets here it shouldn't be cold. Sorry I can't offer a more positive review. We will be back for shrimp and polenta. Steak was above average. Pot roast was outstanding, perhaps the best this foodie has ever tasted. Not sure why the vegetables were under cooked."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food. My fiancé and I both agreed we haven't had a meal like that in the longest time. The steak is perfection and the salmon was to die for. We loved the entire experience. Definitely a good date night spot."}
{"text":"We the Lamb last night with the Burrata salad that tasted smokey it was heaven....then this morning the Charred Eggplant & Ancient Grains killed it! The grains were huge and the sauce they have in it truly makes the dish. Night or day I'm coming back for that...the Ceviche was amazingly yummy and fresh."}
{"text":"Our foursome had a reservation for brunch.  We chose to sit outside on the patio with a pleasant long view of the pools.  Initial seating missed a beat with one menu shy and water for just three.  Then an error in the drink order.  The patio was empty but a large, loud, group was subsequently seated directly next to us.   The service after the blips was attentive.  Although the food portions and presentation were a notch above average, we were looking for exceptional food.  Both the egg bennies & tuna missed the mark."}
{"text":"Banana Ricotta Pancakes with caramel compote and smoked bacon...  Stuffed French toast with orange cream and fresh berries ... pot of French press coffee Valentine's Day morning breakfast was a treat.  Dinner the evening before just as decadent."}
{"text":"Came with friends here for lunch. Terrible service, table not cleaned before hostess seated us; long wait just for water; staff  seemingly not trained-rude. Food was sub-standard, very disappointed. Won't return. If I could I would rate this \"0\" stars."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself is wonderful and would be even better somewhere other than Mountain Shadows.    Being a native Phoenician, I was curious how Mountain Shadows had resurrected itself.  Suffice to say the Town of PV and some non-Valley resident somehow have taken a property with great bones and overthought it into what could be a cultural and financial disaster.  The details are for a different review, but unfortunately for Hearth '61 a lot of the mistakes spill over into the restaurant.  On the positive side, I couldn't rave enough about our waiter and the food.  Our waiter knew the menu, the ingredients, the preparation and the wine/cocktails inside and out.  There wasn't a question he couldn't answer, but frankly we didn't have a whole lot of questions because of the descriptions and recommendations he volunteered.  We were never neglected for a second, and the food itself was outstanding.  The menu has a good mix of tried and true, and less often seen items.  The food itself was prepared so expertly, and they surprised us with an amuse bouche and little dessert bites (brownies topped with bavarian cream and chocolate ganache - yum!) which were a nice touch.  Hats off to an over the top food experience.  The food and service were horribly overshadowed by extensive construction surrounding the restaurant, unfinished decor throughout and what was finished was in poor taste.  The restaurant has no views.  We were seated in front a bank of windows directly in front the base of a purple wall about 15 feet high or so, above which the greeter pointed out that we had a view of Mummy Mountain.  OK. let's be honest here - first of all, the table allowed only one of us to see the \"view\" because one of us had to sit with our back to the \"view\", you had to crane your neck all the way back to see the tippy top of Mummy Mountain and who ever wants to see Mummy Mountain anyway, and besides what the view really is is a bunch of construction garbage cans and debris in front of a huge purple wall.  The restaurant itself could be beautiful because it's very similar to the former Four Seasons restaurant in New York - big and cavernous inside with a gorgeous fountain and pool in the center over which is a huge skylight.  It really could be quite dramatic, but it's been decorated more like a casual beach shack than elegant desert restaurant, and the tables don't allow you to enjoy the center pool at all.  After dinner (about $75 per person with a drink and tip), we walked the property and found ourselves in front of the most stunning view of Camelback Mountain you could imagine.  In back of the property they have a view of the entire Camelback Mtn - none of the rooms were built to face it.  I felt cheated that Hearth '61 doesn't have that view.  For the price, I'd love to experience Hearth '61 someplace else, but sadly I don't really want to go back to Mountain Shadows for it."}
{"text":"Such a beautiful restaurant and bar. The Angela Ferrari band was playing in the bar area so the ambiance was on point. We did a lot of small plates and they were on another level, great service, wine selection and cocktail menu. The high tops near the open kitchen and bar is more of my vibe but the dining area is beautiful as well."}
{"text":"Had a group lunch here - the decor and service were really superb. Loved the large windows over looking the mountain and mid century vibe. We had a table of 15, everything was on point, and we had a great time.   Laura helped us plan the menu, and she was super helpful - she was easy to work with and her recommendations were right on (especially the pumpkin spice crème caramel - MUST GET!).  Highly recommend to take advantage of if you are at the resort!"}
{"text":"Had the filet with red wine Demi and blue cheese fondue....it was amazing! Seriously the best steak/cut of meat in town, and that I have ever had. They also had live music - such a fun Friday night!"}
{"text":"I got food poisoning from the Salmon on my Anniversary weekend this past weekend on the 6th and 7th. Had to go to the hospital. Was very disappointed in the hotel and restaurant. Only plus side was the staff at the Restaurant"}
{"text":"Food flavor is the most important thing to me when it comes to restaurants, and Hearth 61 hit  it of the park for my dinner. I had the Beef Tenderloin dinner during Arizona Restaurant Week and it was absolutely amazing.  It was a very high quality piece of meat,  cooked to perfection.  The flavors were unbelievable! The cocktails were also delicious and the bread pudding desert decadent. I absolutely recommend trying this restaurant."}
{"text":"We had a GREAT experience.  After touring this amazing, new hotel property, The Mountain Shadows, we continued the fun for dinner at their restaurant.  Even though this is a five star restaurant, it is comfortably casual.  All the staff we're welcoming and professional.  All five of us were hospitality professionals.  The open kitchen concept was a perfect way to sneak a peak at menu items in different stages of creation.  Because the branzino looked so good while the chef was preparing it, two of us ordered it.  It was delicious!  Everyone loved their selections, especially the beef tenderloin.  I would go to this restaurant just for the amazing views alone.  The perfectly prepared cuisine made it a great experience."}
{"text":"We had a party of 11 people the food took a very long time to get to us. Jasmine was one of our servers she was very nice she made sure to keep all of drunk filled. She was really sad that our food did not get to us soon but her service was EXCELLENT!!!!! She helped me with the menu and recommended my dinner. It was delicious!!! They also made it up by bringing us like 15 desserts out to us free of charge!!! I would definitely go back just because Jasmine made us feel very well served! The manager also came to apologize which was very nice"}
{"text":"After a horrible experience at El Charro, Hearth 61 welcomed our Meetup group with open arms. Amazing services, roomy and accommodating to large groups. Skip other places and have a great experience at Hearth 61"}
{"text":"In the past I've to come to the Mountain Shadows all the time. Glad they finally rebuilt and opened up a new modernized resort with beautiful views accommodations and the property is great to walk around. Very nice selection of drinks and the bartenders know how to pour them. Definitely worth checking out if you've never been or if you've been here in the past you will be pleasantly surprised on the new hotel from the ground up."}
{"text":"This restaurant was absolutely amazing some the best service of any luxury restaurants in Phoenix.  Hearth 61 is one of the best new restaurants in Paradise Valley, I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes amazing steak and swordfish entrées. For cocktails and I would highly recommend the cherry Gastrique Manhattan and they have a vast wine selection."}
{"text":"Went with friends on Saturday evening and had a wonderful time! We were celebrating both of our anniversary's and were surprised by a complimentary bottle of champagne which was lovely and quite delicious! Sally, our server was amazing. She is warm, welcoming and attentive. She also has great suggestions what to order from the variety of dishes to wines. This was the second time Sally was our server and I had requested her this time because of her great service. I  will continue to request her and highly recommend that you request her too. The food was amazing! The beet salad was so tasty with fresh greens and a light dressing with goat cheese which compliment the beets very well. For main dishes my husband and I ventured to try the prime rib which on our very first visit was terribly salty. But Sally assured us that was no longer a problem and she was right! Chuck Wiley, a renown chef has conquered and succeeded! The prime rib was wonderful perfectly cooked, tasty and non-salty. Our friends ordered the swordfish and the filet mignon and they raved about both. Our sides were the Brussels sprouts and broccolini  both were excellent. For dessert I ordered the peanut butter beeramisu which was a great twist on tiramisu, so very light and creamy. Our friends shared the warm brown butter apple tart which they loved. The atmosphere is contemporary, comfortable and relaxed. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Just opened. Hotel overall is very sleek & modern and this is an extension of that. Bar is simple & restaurant nice. Food & drinks were good & while service was good, felt rushed. Update: GM immediately reached out & asked us to try again which we did--service/food/atmosphere was great! Will go back!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and service.  We had brunch and dinner here. Brunch service was slow . Took a while for my wife to get first cup of coffee.  Dinner was on point.  Very attentive staff. We ordered prime rib and salmon. Cooked to perfection, never had salmon so flaky"}
