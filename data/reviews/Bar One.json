{"text":"Please let this review serve as a cautionary tale, entitled \"DON'T EAT CRAB CAKES IN CLEVELAND!\" 

I should of known better when I arrived in Cleveland at 8pm and nothing was open. It was a ghost town. The only thing that even looked remotely open on this strip was this bar. I was hungry and they had beer, so I sat down and ordered a drink. 

When the bar tender put the glass of Stella in front of me, she said, \"My name is Sarah, I'll be your server tonight. Welcome to Cleveland the biggest meth producing city in the whole United States, as well as, one of the largest cities for adult services.\" 

I immediately like her. She was funny. So, I decided to stay and order food. Being the exotic food eater that I am, I decided to order the crab cakes with chipolte mayo on a bed of coleslaw and forcancia bread. When Sarah brought out the food it looked fine, smelled great, and tasted delicious too. I ate those crab cakes voraciously while Sarah entertained me with a story. 

After that, I had one more drink and paid my tab, since it was getting late. 10pm to be exact. I walked back to the hotel and had a relaxing night until I was rudely awakened by a gurgling in my stomach. I looked at the clock and the red numbers said 3am. 

I rolled over and tried to go back to sleep, but the rumbling in my tummy was getting worse and before I knew it, I was in the water closet on my hands and knees, hailing to the porcelain goddess. 

So please take my advice on this. If you find yourself in a place like Cleveland, where nothing is open past 8pm on a Saturday night, no less, except one little bar, do yourself a favor and don't eat the crab cakes. Choose the grilled cheese and fries instead! 

I'm sure my story would have had a happier ending!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best sushi place Downtown.  I might say one of the best in Cleveland.  The fish was some of the best I have had in Cleveland.  The salmon was rich, almost buttery. The specialty rolls had a lot of flavor but you could still taste the fish.  The Foo Foo rolls (fried stuff with lots of sauce) were very creative but not overwhelming. The service was very attentive and efficient.  So if you like the raw stuff this is very, very good. If not there are plenty of Foo Foo rolls also.  My only complaint or suggestion is to have more lunch specials or combinations.  They close at 9:00 so if you like to have a few drink you will have to hurry.

I think they went out of business.  They were a little funny the last time I was there,  They told people they had run out of rice and they may only get a few rolls.  Weird?  Any how it was good untill the last time I went,  If you see  a restaurant that is being funny about portions or the staff is reduced from the last time you visited,.I advise leaving as the place is going out of business, and can care less. Oh well it was good while it lasted.  Good place  bad marketing and like I said more lunch specials would have brought in the downtown crowd.  Asian restaurant sometimes just dont get it in the Clev."}
{"text":"Oh, thank God.  Something worthwhile has replaced Bar One.   Once a bastion of fried garbage served at least one hour after you ordered it by the world's dumbest servers,  now Bar One Sushi serves decent sushi and features great service!!!  

THE ATMOSPHERE:  Mood indigo.  Deep blue walls, high black tables, cool square tableware, stainless steel and loud music.  A little too loud.

THE SERVICE:  Ultra attentive.  No fewer than three people asked us if we were enjoying everything or if we needed anything.  The owner, or manager, I presume, even gave us some free crab salad to try.  Not only was it free, it was damned tasty.  Drinks were always full.  The food came quickly.

THE FOOD:  The place is affiliated with Fujiama, so the specailty rolls tend to favor tempura ingredients.  However, there is reasonable selection of traditional sushi rolls, sashimi and nigiri.  The selection of sashimi is much more varied than the selection of traditional rolls.  

I got the JALAPENO INCIDENT  (that needed caps)  yellow tail with pickled jalapeno, flying fish roe and some yellowish wrap rather than the traditional nori.  I scraped off the huge glops of mayonaisse based spicy sauce on top.  After that, I was in heaven, if , in fact, heaven requires you to down three glasses of iced tea to quench the subtle and building heat of your sushi roll.  

The traditional plain salmon roll I had was very fresh and well executed.  The salmon was really creamy, without any stringy bits to ruin the texture.

Mon cher chou's SPICY KILLER (that needed caps, too)--spicy salmon with tuna avacado and black pepper on top--was decadent.  The fish was smooth and delicate-- more like a French tartare.

So forgive and forget Bar One.  Bar One Sushi has redeemed the space."}
