{"text":"It was okay, nothing special. I really like rice noodle and this place specializes in it. The \"On Bridge Rice Noodle - original broth\" is really bland but my friend who ordered it said that with the toppings it was good. I had the Specialized Rice Noodle with beef tenderloin and it was okay. Service and atmosphere was average."}
{"text":"First time here, I don't find it as bad as the previous reviews TBH. Arrived around 8pm, there were 3/ 6 tables. There are customers, just not a lot. Restaurant is small and can only seat about 15-20 people max. I didn't ask for the use of the bathroom, but I did not see one during the time I sat there for dinner.

*Yunnan cross bridge noodle is suppose to be like this with 2 piece of meat and variety of different types of vegetables. Be understanding to the dish itself and the background before you make yourself sound so uneducated or inexperienced!!* 

I think it comes with normal amount of variety of vegetables. In fact, it comes with 2 quail eggs when most places only comes with 1. I find it filling. 

Soup- NOT hot enough, quail eggs were only cooked till poached level and my beef was like blue rare-ish even though I put those in first and stick them at the bottom. 
- soup was blend imo, not really to my liking. Yet I only tried the tomato soup base. My partner had beef brisket noodle and was meh. It wasn't bad with taste.. just that we had better ones... and there are better ones around the corner or near the restaurant. 

Price- quite pricey ($3-5 dollars difference) in terms of cross bridge noodles, and given the fact in that area along with other competitors, I can see why customer level was limited.  

Not my #1 place to go to, and not something I would crave for that I must come to this location for this type of food or kind of flavor."}
{"text":"Excited to try yet another noodles restaurant at Yonge and Finch! This place was quite busy when I went with my boyfriend so despite the mediocre reviews on Yelp, we took the plunge! The atmosphere of the restaurant also drawn me in - it feels quite cozy and homey. I also saw bread faces coaster which I found super cute! Another plus is that they actually have legitimate seating in the restaurant. The other noodle places are way to cramped! I ended up ordering the on bridge rice noodle with tomato broth. I love the display of the food on a wooden plank and the colour pot. I was happy with the portions we got and really liked the variety of toppings as well. I was a bit confused because the server didn't quite explain what to do with the food (ie what should be cooked first etc) and I had to ask. I think partly because the restaurant was quite busy at the time, but for someone trying this for the first time, definitely needed some guidance. The price is a bit more than other noodle places, but I feel that it was a pretty unique experience compared to other noodle shops so I didn't mind as well. Overall, I would return to try out the different broths!"}
{"text":"I had the noodles in soup; and was it ever gimmicky! Seriously, I think the garnishing would have been better had they been \"cooked\" and then served with the lid on. Seeing the 20 or dozen item is neat aesthetically, but in terms of how it ultimately tastes and feels in your mouth, it misses my mark. Finally, the rice noodle was over cooked - sorry to say, and much more sorry to have had to eat soggy noodles.

I've heard of service with a smile. You won't find this here. Trying to understand the menu was a bit of a challenge. Engaging one of the girls was an even greater challenge. Finally, one of them actually spoke and spoke English. It would help if they complemented the menu with pictures; especially, if the waitresses do not like talking.

The other meals were too wet for my liking. I typically fancy dried fried noodles and not wet fried. If you like you food mushy, and if you like to pick out (in this case, not put in certain items), this place could work for you. It'll even work better if you don't like to communicate much either!"}
{"text":"First time here. I ordered noodles with tomato broth and all veggie toppings. The interesting part is that the the broth, the noodles, and the toppings all arrived separately. The toppings were served on what resembled a chopping board. Yep some assembly was required. I didn't mind that but the tomato broth was not tasty. The rice noodles were alright. But overall I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing experience. Toppings here are worse than the toppings packets in cup noodles (very little variety and small portions). Also, the soup is not even hot, making it very difficult to cook the raw frozen toppings. 

TLDR; this place sucks!"}
{"text":"We went to this place and ordered, ate, and then read the review. Now i would say i regret that, we should've read the reviews first, because they are spot on, about how this place is not good at all. There are so many problems its hard to just go with one. The food was the main problem of course which is the core of every restaurant, the food was not good at this restaurant, it is not going to wow anyone, its taste was plain wrong, just overly salty, and it seems not many people enjoyed it either, cause reading the other reviews has solidified that not a lot of people have found redeeming features in the restaurant. 

it is sad, considering that Yunnan noodles are something that could be good, but it seems to be really hard to find a decent one in Toronto. The service is also not good at this place as the servers are confused in 3 languages, Mandarin, Cantonese, and English. which makes you clear that they are just confused, they get the orders wrong, multiple times, and are slow to react to people even when its not busy at all. 

i would recommend people to save some money and go to the other noodle places in the area that are nearby and much better."}
{"text":"It was interesting to try at least once but not sure if it's worth it. I got the professional version which came with 14 toppings but don't let that number fool you; it's not as elaborate as what I got.  I got two small pieces of meat, some veggies and a whole lot of noodles that fill the top of the pot.  It did leave me feeling with a bland taste of noodles. Very little flavour here. The putting stuff was somewhat fun but then again, they could have just put all the toppings inside especially since you don't get refills.

Food: 2/5, kind of bland tasting and lukewarm noodles never help.

Service: 2/5, nothing out of the ordinary

Ambience: 2/5, seating is quite bad as they are all stools and Asian food is not good for that. Seems like they thought of style more than function 

Price: 2/5, about $17 per person. And they only take cash or debit: I find this sketchy ."}
{"text":"DON'T TRY THIS PLACE! It's the first time I've ever tried such a complete shitty restaurant. It sucks in every way. The rice noodle texture is wrong, the soup is not hot and taste plain, the server seems know nothing she should know, and the speed is slow. Moreover, it is very over priced as a tiny and far below average rice noodle restaurant. I had the professional on bridge rice noodle. the portion is very small and it is $13 before tax and tips. 

If i could i wanna give negative star.......... so definitely not gonna go back nor recommend it to anyone."}

We came here after the lunch time rush around 2pm. I have seen the place a couple of times and thought it might be good to try this place, because I really enjoyed this type of noodle when I was working in China.  

I ordered the 12-topping noodle, with the tomato broth and it was good, but the amount of toppings was pretty small. What they did have, was ok. I will say, I did stumble upon a piece of plastic wrapper in one of the toppings, not a big deal, but it lowered my impression for sure. The soup was hot and cooked the toppings properly. Overall, the taste was pretty good. The toppings were also pretty fresh.

The cost is a little pricy. That being said, when I was working in China, this was a pricier meal too. That being said, you're paying more for the experience than the actual food here. There are plenty of other noodle places that offer much better value.

The decor is really clean, but to me it doesn't really fit the style of food. On the bridge noodle, to me, is supposed to be a type of comfort food. The atmosphere is almost hipster, with all the little cute things

The service here was good, there is only one person serving, but the restaurant is small enough that it's not an issue

The place is very clean, maybe due to being new, but they look to be quite thorough when you watch them. 

An interesting style of noodles if you've never tried it before, but not on the top of my list of places I'd recommend."}
{"text":"What makes this restaurant interesting is that everything is laid out and you can make your own noodles. However, this is also their downfall... (my boyfriend doesn't like to have to make his own food when you're going to a restaurant)

I ordered the original broth with classic 12 toppings. You're presented with your platter of toppings (all very small amounts, but enough), a bowl of noodles, and a pot of broth which sits on a cute trivet shaped like a toast. They instruct you to put the egg and beef slices into the broth, cover and let sit for 1 min before putting your other toppings in. The toppings are chilled (not fridge cold) and the noodles were nuked, so by the time I had all my toppings and noodles in the pot of broth, my pot of food wasn't hot to my liking any more.

Taste-wise, it was good. Their selection of toppings were good but I've had better bowls of noodle that I didn't have to make myself at a restaurant."}
{"text":"This place really doesn't deserve the 2/5 stars it currently has. 
I brought my friends in for lunch on a weekday, and looked it up on yelp. The 2 stars nearly made me bolt for the doors. 

The decor is definitely the strong point, with cute bowls and plating (we had a toast-shaped coaster with a happy face!), and my inner pinterest nerd was obsessing over every detail.

With decor like that, it was a high bar for the food to live up to the expectation. And it didn't. But it wasn't THAT far off! For $13 (all in), I had the Classic 12-topping noodle with tomato soup. The broth was savoury, but a bit thin and bland. The variety of toppings really helped with flavour, and the hot soup was perfect on a cold day. Plus, I could choose to portion my noodles (I ate half the bowl so didn't walk out bloated - as I tend to do at other noodle shops).

My friend were impressed with the food, presentation and price point. Would definitely come back for lunch."}
{"text":"Way too overhyped and it took forever to get our meals. 

Quantity was lacking, service was not polite and the wait was long (seriously, how long does it take to make a bowl of noodles). Don't expect more than 3 small pieces of meat in your ramen. 

Once the hype is over, I will be looking forward to another restaurant to take this place."}
{"text":"If you walk by this place and happen to see that there's no one inside on a Friday night then you probably know why I rated 1 star. No need to explain further because it absolutely sucks."}
{"text":"Even I can cook better.  This place is more about food presentation. They put the ingredients on a plate nicely. Anyways it tastes bad."}
{"text":"This used to be my ALL TIME FAVOURITE place to have noodles
However, my recent two visits have changed my opinion of this place completely.
1. On my second last visit, the meat tastes really weird. It is not rotten, but it tastes like meat that has been in the freezer for two weeks.
2. On my last visit, the vegetable (Shanghai Bak Choi or ??) is rotten and COMPLETELY UNEDIBLE, I had to spit it out (my friend couldn't swallow it either)
In my opinion, the flavour of the soup is really nice, but the quality needs huge huge improvement. It is truly disappointing to see a place I've loved so much became so awful. Not to mention that the portions have been small since day 1.
This is the longest review I have ever written in my life. Owners, please take my suggestions into consideration."}
{"text":"Wow.. this place is not good. Extremely overpriced and the portions are really small .. my fiancé and I had to eat elsewhere afterwards.  Noodles are definitely store-bought. It's just a bunch of hotpot stuff dumped in a little pot... Tables and chairs are uncomfortable and wobbly.... just wish they can do better...You know, why bother to open a space if you can't offer anything special on your menu? 

FAIL.... -___-"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try since I've never been and I'm a huge fan of noodles. When we walked in during dinner time, the place was empty which sort of raises a red flag for me but we decided to try the place anyways. 

After we sat down, I looked on Yelp for recommendations of what to order, and I noticed this place only has 2 stars. I regret not looking on Yelp before entering this restaurant but since we were already there, I felt bad to leave. I realized that the place doesn't have a lot of reviews to begin with so it may not be a great representation of what the place is really like until I try it for myself. But because the reviews were so bad, my friend and I decided to order one bowl of noodles and just share it because we didn't want to spend our money here. When the waitress realized that we were only getting one bowl of noodles between the two of us, she gave us a dirty stare. I got a little annoyed when she did that but I guess I can't blame her since we were being cheap with our orders. 

We ordered the original braised beef noodles with soup. The dish didn't look too bad when it arrived but after trying it, I realized that the reviews made by other people were pretty accurate. I'm a huge fan of rice noodles and this did not taste authentic at all. The broth was salty and plain. Even though it was a beef broth, I couldn't taste the beef flavour at all. I tried adding vinegar and the chilli oil to the broth but it didn't make it much better because the chilli oil sauce was pure oil with no chillies at all. At first we thought the bottle ran out, so we went to grab the chilli oil on the table beside us but it was the same thing. 

This place is not worth coming back to. There are so many noodle places on yonge street that are way better."}
