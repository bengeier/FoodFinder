{"text":"This is my favourite place to grab a bite to eat in the mall! It's always fresh and they make everything right in front of you. Even if the mall is a complete zoo, you can get your food relatively quick as they have a good size staff ready to help. I would recommend getting a sandwich! It come with fresh fruit or veggies and a cookie! Yum!"}
{"text":"I work at Chinook near Saucy Bread so I go to this place all the time for my break. First it's more convenient for me to get to than the busy food court, and second their service and food is exceptional! I haven't tried everything they have to offer and rather stick to my favourites, but the food has always been delicious. I remember getting fresh bread for my sandwich once and I was in heaven. They've also renovated their seating area recently, it's not bigger but it looks nicer. Price is really reasonable too. My only problem: People don't seem to know where to line up and therefore I have been cut off a couple times but that's just a minor thing."}
{"text":"This review would be five stars but there are two completely different people that I often deal with when I come here. One, is amazing, so helpful, so kind, caring about the food he makes and always communicating to see if you are okay with the ingredients they are adding as they add them. The other, horribly rude, couldn't care less about the food or you, and just makes you feel like an awful person for even asking a question or requesting a modification. The food here is good and fresh so it'd definitely be a 5 star rating if it weren't for some less than friendly employees. My favourite is the Mandarin Chicken Salad - but order it without cheddar cheese... for some reason they added that to the list of ingredients recently and it just wouldn't suit the salad in my opinion."}
{"text":"A terrific place to have in this huge Chinook shopping mall.  It's got fresh baked goods, sandwiches and looks like a franchise, love the red theme.  Situated in a corner location by anchor store Sears on the upper level.  Just ordered the fruit bowl on my work trip a few weeks back, and have to say it was pretty fresh, much better than the Starbucks, which obviously, tastes just the way one would expect when you bring it in elsewhere.  But here, they buy and cut the fruit fresh.  Nice owners too, and good service.    next time i'm in town, worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, I love the food here! It's a regular spot for me to go if I'm in chinook mall. The soft pretzels are sooooo addicting,  all the flavours taste good! The soup is always delicious, and the sandwiches are freshly made. They have these scrumptious ham and cheese biscuits, and berry scones, that are also always fresh. All in all, a large variety of choices for a quick meal. The staff are friendly, and it's a family run business that I'm happy to support."}
{"text":"The soft pretzels are my favourite thing to get after I do shopping at chinook mall!   The other day I picked up a huge cheese pretzel for me and a pepperoni topped one for my husband!   Piping hot and totally coated with crispy meaty cheese....Soooooo good when grabbing a bite to eat and the middle was so soft and hot!  You gotta go try these awesome pretzels! So yummy!  Shop till you drop at the mall, but treat yourself to one of these for sure...."}
{"text":"As far as dining in Chinook Centre is concerned, this is the tops. I rarely buy lunch, but my backroom is a constant revolving door of co-workers coming back with salads, sandwiches, paninis, soups and cookies from this place, and it puts a smile on my face. I was a huge fan of it when it was still located beside Zellers, was concerned for it during the new wing's construction when it was literally in no-man's-land and seemed deserted, and am thrilled at the stream of business it receives.   The workers here are bar none the nicest in the whole mall, the mall employee discount is generous, and of course the most important - the food is delicious and quick. Save the madness of the food court and come enjoy a quiet and tasty meal at the north end.  4/30"}
{"text":"A warm, chewy, soft pretzel with cheese and pepperoni on top. What more could you ask for?  It was a tasty snack while doing a little shopping. Not the greatest pretzel in the world but it hit the spot. Skip the cheese sauce though, its just regular crappy nacho cheese.  Service was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Okay, so I used to eat at this place every single day when I worked at Chinook Mall, so I say with pride their food is satisfying and delicious.  I worked at a kiosk just below this store and everyday the smell would waft its way down a level and into my nostrils.  As soon as I would smell the glorious smell, I knew I'd be having it again that day for lunch.  Each day I went to work I would tell myself that I'd be getting something different but my willpower was no match for this insatiable place.  The bread is warm and soft, the veggie's are crunchy and fresh, and the meat is real and delicious.  No you know why I wanted, ney, NEEDED to go back time and time again.  Saucy Bread makes the best sandwich know to man!  Okay, they are a little expensive, but I totally think it's worth it.  Along with your sandwich you can choose the soup or just the veggie side, and each comes with a cute little danish for dessert.  I always got the veggie side because I loved that they give you carrots, celery, a pickle and a little container of ranch dressing.  I always asked them for extra pickles and they weren't hesitant about giving them to me.  Nice folks over at the Saucy Bread Co.  If you're in Chinook Mall and you feel like you're fading, stop by Saucy Bread for something a little different for lunch.  They aren't located in the food court, though, but instead over by the Zeller's on the second floor.    I just want to say thanks to Saucy Bread Co. for filling ym belly all those days with their delicious, oh so delicious, sandwiches.  I miss you!"}
