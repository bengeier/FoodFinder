{"text":"I have drank margaritas around the world and never ever have I paid $22.00 a margarita.  Watch this restaurant they will over charge you given half the chance."}
{"text":"probably the worst service and food i've ever had in charlotte. im normally not a complainer, but this was beyond terrible. the service was rude and slow, and after waiting over an hour for food mine came out with a chunk of hair in my burger. ill never ever go back."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Currently sitting here for over an hour. We've gone to the bar twice for beer but have not once been offered service from one of the two waitresses on the patio. Good atmosphere. Still drinking. But would appreciate an offer of service from someone.... jeez"}
{"text":"I live very close to this place so come here fairly often to watch football.  My softball team also comes here a lot after our games.  I really like this joint.  Its got a \"hole in the wall\" feel inside but that's not a bad thing.  The outdoor patio is huge and great on a warm summer night.  The staff has always been very friendly.  The servers are alway great and friendly and I've never had a bad server experience here.  Same with the bartenders.  Always attentive and friendly.  If someone is at the door checking IDs those guys are always great also.  No \"meathead attitudes\" that I've seen.
Only reason I give 4 stars is that the bathrooms are pretty gross.  But what do you expect from a hole in the wall?  Luckily, I've never had to use the bathroom to take care of any serious business.  I would probably go home instead!  Haha.
The food here is very good, too.  It's your typical \"bar fare\" and I've never had a bad snack here.  Burgers are good, love the pretzel bites, nachos are on point (they build a whole nacho on each single chip, pretty cool), and the buffalo chicken bites are great. They have tater tots, too.  Who doesn't love tater tots?  They have great fries, too.  They have a crunchy coating on them which I love.
Highly recommend this joint to kill an afternoon or night watching sports and relaxing in a chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"They have a great selection of food! There Mac and cheese is to die for... I love love love this food! Also very dog friendly and they bring water out for your dog! Great business"}
{"text":"Allow me to provide a review from two different perspectives the crazy college kid and anyone else other than a college kid. 

College Kid Review: Man this place rocks pitchers of beer galore- plastic cups oh my! When drunkenness sets in there is nothing to break! Lots of younger twenty somethings where you are bound to meet someone new and makes lots of noise. A plethora of TVs for numerous college sports viewings and cheapish bar food tops the list. When the weather is nice the large outdoor patio can be used as a giant outdoor party. 

Anyone else other than a college kid review: Two words to describe this one: scary larry. One of my coworkers got sick from the wings. I don't recommend it if you have some expectations. This place serves your typical sub-par bar food. The same goes for the drinks. My review may be skewed because once someone I know gets sick from the food is warrant enough for me to stay away. The only positive I can see is the large outdoor seating area which is why I gave two stars instead of one. If you go there good luck and lower your expectations."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere and great service! No matter what day of the week you go you can usually find people hanging out on the huge patio at Angry Ale's. Plenty  of large TV's to watch a game."}
{"text":"If you come here and don't get the sweet potato fries, there is something wrong with you. No, but really, the food is good for bar fare and the prices are on point. There's plenty to do in the area and a great place to meet on the weekend. Outdoor seating on a beautiful day is a must. If you don't have time to sit down, you can always pick up to go."}
{"text":"Taking a break from my morning on the toilet to write this review. Went to Angry Ale's last night with some friends for food and beer. Got wings, burgers, fries, nachos...normal bar food that SHOULD be easy enough to cook right. Food was decent enough going in...not so much COMING OUT!  Spoke to my buddy and he's having the same \"issues\".    

Our bathrooms are on different floors of the house, so I haven't seen my wife in about 12 hours. I hope the dog doesn't need to go outside anytime soon or we may be dealing with more than just my wife and me.  Food poisoning on an Italian cruise ship run aground or a North Korean labor camp may be the norm, but I thought this was America!  Clean it up Angry Ale's!"}
{"text":"The Kendall's favorite that I secretly call one of my own.  I sneak in for lunch and a beer... or three. Then I go about my day. Best place on Montford. And there are a lot of those, but this place is a keeper."}
{"text":"Our company is close to them and we had went a couple times before. The outside deck is nice in good weather. The inside is kind of crappy, run down, dirty, and just smells. The bathrooms are the worst. One Friday probably 15 people from our company went for lunch and got brutally sick with the Nora Virus. We will NEVER go there again, just from this expirience! Wich is a bad thing for them cause we go out every Friday for lunch and happy hour, and tend to spend some cash."}
{"text":"Sat outside on the patio and had a great lunch. Our waitress was excellent. Pimento cheese dip, tater tots and salads were excellent. Large menu."}
{"text":"Terrible bar and terrible service. Every time I have come here I've waited twenty minutes to get a drink while some fratboy high school all star has gotten free drinks all night because they know the bartender. Owners also own the train wreck that is Andrew Blair's next door. 

This bar along with Andrew Blairs is a recreation of the Charlotte high school scene. If you did not go to high school in Charlotte, you will not get drinks and not know anyone here. I was completely miserable. 

Let's not forget the bartender who gave free drinks to young men who paid her for haircuts during the week. This kind of stuff is not how you run a business and I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"A good place for a burger, but not high on service. Ordered teriyaki chicken wrap - doused in sauce...not marinated. Thanks for the liquid wrap. Sub-par for food, but cold beer."}
{"text":"Good prices, great food and atmosphere.  Fun place to watch a game or just grab a beer.  Friendly people and good prices"}
{"text":"I'm a fan.  After a long day at the office, it's nice to belly up to the bar for a man can and a bacon cheddar fatty melt followed by another man can.  If you're looking to hang out with some down to earth locals in charlotte, look no further.  If you have stuffy fine dining on the brain, you're in the wrong place."}
{"text":"Wonderful!  My favorite restaurant in all of metro Charlotte (and that's saying a lot!)...

No matter if you want to come here to grab a drink and chill or go for a full-out meal, Angry Ale's is awesome.  My husband and I routinely go here once or twice a week, and we've never - NEVER - been disappointed.

The service is fast and friendly.  The prices are fair considering the quality and amount of food you get.  Drink specials are AWESOME, especially on weekdays.  Haven't been for the trivia yet but I plan to!

The food is STELLAR.  Get one of the burgers - any one will do - or some Redneck Fondue.  The fries are great, crispy, and the salads are pretty rockin' as well!

Best thing, for us, is that we can bring our dogs on the patio.  We have an elderly Golden retriever who loves her weekly trip to Ale's (as well as some occasional cheesy fries).  :)  An all-around great neighborhood grill that I'd recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"I ordered through Postmates for delivery so no comments about what is going on INSIDE. I ordered the pretzel bites. DELICIOUS with a queso dipping sauce. It's a little pricey, however. They arrived warm, too. I also ordered the nachos which were great! With ground beef, they did a great job of distributing the items among the chips, meaning, every chip was covered! I'll order again for sure."}
{"text":"Very fun laid back atmosphere! Had the bleu burger, soooo good! Service was awesome! Love it here! Great music too!  Bye bye miss American Pie!"}
{"text":"great for a quick beer or snack, or bringing your dog up there to hang out. i love how dog friendly they are. the service is a hit or a miss, some of the waitresses r great and some arent. i love the pretzel bites. the buffalo bites r quite good. overall nice place to be, bathroom is dark and small and youd think theyd have more than 1. it would be nice if they cleaned the patio more, the picnic tables can be sticky sometimes."}
{"text":"Awesome venue with lots of indoor room and a well heated deck!  Always enjoy watching the Panthers & doing dabs on Sunday, keep it high CLT!  I dig the old plate collection on the wall!   beer is best when it's free, thanks Miller lite & if the hot waitress didn't already have 2 boyfriends I woulda got her #"}
{"text":"Service was awful... We had to keep asking for our waitress. She was in the back stuffing her face the whole time. The food on the other hand was great. Fried pickles were delicious! Love the atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Ive yet to eat anything bad here great food good drink specials the staff are very friendly if your not a snob. And the patio is awesome."}
{"text":"Ordered to-go food from here for my first experience. Pricing is decent, but I was not impressed at all. The food was mediocre at best. With that being said, it's not difficult to make a good buffalo chicken wrap with tots, but maybe I'm wrong?"}
{"text":"Great good and drink! Free shots galore! Highly suggest the chicken parm sliders! Trivia on Thursdays is a blast"}
{"text":"Got the large size of fried pickles, which wasn't all that large, and could hardly, if at all, taste the pickle because they were sliced so incredibly thin.  It truly tasted like fried breading and on top of that, they were cold.  SO disappointing because I love fried pickles!  Also got the Tree Hugger Veggie Burger, which is a homemade concoction that looked like it had been scrambled and then placed on the bun (rather than in patty form) and absolutely smothered in mozzarella cheese.  Should have been called a mozzarella burger instead.  No tomato, no onion, just one very thin piece of lettuce on the bun.  Very, very unsatisfying, especially since this \"burger\" cost $7.49.  It came with a choice of sides, which were several different varieties of fries.  I chose garlic fries, but that isn't what I received.  Their beer \"special\" is $2.50/bottle, which is just okay, certainly not a drawing card.  There are many other places with much better food that have better specials than that.  The service was \"acceptable\" but nothing more.  My bill was $22 and I ate less than half of my food and left sort of feeling as though I had just been robbed.  At least the beer was cold."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an unexpected lunch and it was surprisingly good!  We ordered burgers, fries, and the kebab dish and each was perfect.  I will say that I thought $40-$45 (w/ tip) was a little overpriced for 3 lunch items but the food and service was spot on."}
{"text":"Great place to hang, lots of games and a good patio. Food is american and greasy, but good. Gets real busy on some weekdays but definitely check out the outside area on a nice day."}
{"text":"Came here just on a random off day from work around the holidays...read reviews and wanted to check it out for myself. Definitely a nice spot to come and have a drink seems like they had a few drinks specials and alot of beer on tap. I'm sure on game days this place can be pretty quick! Bartender was nice and made a strong drink for me. I ordered the Buffalo shrimp it was pretty good i will return to try more food! I know it would be a good spot for a good drink though!"}
{"text":"On recent trip to Charlotte, I found myself at Angry Ale's on no less than three separate occasions.

Away from my home turf on the recent Nuggets playoff run, I found AAs a go to spot to watch the game.  The staff and crowd was friendly and accepting of my explicit Nuggets fanship, as I was clad in a jersey and not without boisterous comments.

Also, I made it here on Wednesday for trivia night, which was awesome.  I am a regular trivia geek at Woody's Pizza in Arvada, CO...thus it was quite interesting to be exposed to a different format.  I found the competition stiff, the questions written with wit and intelligence, and the overall experience quite invigorating.

Finally, on this most recent trip to AAs I noticed how friendly the wait staff is.  They truly do epitomize a sense of Southern Hospitality that is difficult to find elsewhere.  Lindsay is awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is the tits! Had a double burger with bacon grilled cheese as the buns! Nom nom, also tried fried banana and PB burger, so delicious!!! Service was great, and there's a million TVs! Pool table and huge beer selection. Bam!"}
{"text":"Just got into Charlotte. Wanted to watch the Panthers game. The place could be very nice for outside during the summer time. However, the inside is too small. The place is crowded and the TVs are somewhat in weird spots. I will return here during the summer. Like I said the outside has potential. The inside is well below avg.

#YelpingChris"}
{"text":"Good place to watch the game, have some bar eats and beers. Big patio with several TVs too. Went there recently to watch the Wisconsin game and after about 2 minutes we figured out the spot and the waitress was kind enough to change the the TV for us. Wasn't too busy, which was a nice change as some bars on game day just get ridiculously busy and it's hard to get good service. That said; it wasn't slow by all means, just a good crowd. 

Ordered the chicken nachos, which were OK. Came on separate tortilla chips with all the fixings. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but when I think of or want nachos, I want a stack of chips with the ingredients dumped on top, but that's just me. Had a bite of the wife's burger and it was good as well. Menu is full of special sandwiches and burgers as well as salads and apps. 

Only negative was that the PBR was $2.50...now that's steep for a PBR, even knowing how much I love it."}
{"text":"Angry Ale's reminds me of bars I used to frequent when I was in college.  When we didn't have any other choices.  The restaurant/bar is a series of interlocking rooms.  Some with tables, some with bars, some with pool tables.  Great for mingling in crowds.  In college.  

We had a coupon for Angry Ale's so decided to give it a try, hoping to find a new local favorite bar at which to hang out.  It was a nice evening, so we sat outside.  They have a big outdoor seating area, but AA was seriously lacking any atmosphere.  No color, no theme, no spark.  

The service was a-ok, as was the food.  Nothing stood out.  It's your basic bar food -- apps, salads, burgers, wings, sandwiches -- but they had a pretty good variety of each item.  

Maybe if they did something with the look and feel of the place, Ale wouldn't be so Angry?"}
{"text":"Place was fun, clean and a cool atmosphete. The pretzel bites were.really good as well. Frink specials on sunday are cool and good prices. Definitely will come back for sunday gameday."}
{"text":"The fishbowl that says it has SWEDISH FISH does not ever have Swedish fish and when you ask about it, you get an attitude. Just FYI."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere but the waitress turnover is high so service is def hit and miss!!"}
{"text":"Food is decent...except for the pretzel bites always seem to come out overcooked and dry.  Beer selection is decent...and if you get there early enough, you might even get one that's COLD!  Service....usually horrible.  If someone orders an appetizer, why not bring plates and silverware right off the bat so they don't have to wait another 10-15 minutes until you come back again?  

Overall, I would not go to this place unless you are meeting someone for some game watching.  Even then, don't drink too much because the bathrooms are disgusting.  For months I've seen the same broken faucets, toliet paper dispensers, and even missing mirror!  Whoever the owner is..Target sells them for like $10.  Invest in a decent wait staff and non-\"porto-potty\"-like bathrooms, and maybe people would like to frequent AA more often."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I'm giving Angry's 2 stars even though I've been there a TON and still plan to go quite frequently.. (it's like 3 minutes from my house, let's be honest - I'll be there again)

Positives: Has all the games, lots of TVs, almost always has a good crowd, decent drink specials, decent food, great outdoor seating area. Perfect spot to catch a game and a beer/quick bite. Decent amount of parking, good location near Park and Woodlawn.

Before now I would have seriously complained about the smoke issue, but with smoking no longer permitted inside, Angry's is a much better spot.

Middle Ground: Hit or miss service. Can be great or can be awful. Just depends on the waitress and the day. 

Negatives: Constantly changing their menu. They were known for their mac and cheese - gone. Entrees constantly coming and going. I don't know if there is management issues but the menu and wait staff never seem to be the same. Only the guy at the door.. 

Kinda weird set up. It's divided into 3 rooms and then an outdoor area. Which would be good I guess if you had a group and wanted an area to yourself, but it's hard if the group is particularly large or if your group is in a room and you show up late and it's just impossible to fit another chair. 

I would say the biggest negative is if you did not or do not go to Queens or UNCC, the people are probably going to annoy you. Young crowd that can get obnoxious at times (and I'm in my 20's so it's annoying enough to bother someone in the same demo). Very \"Greek friendly\" aka FRATastic! Clearly a flip flops kinda bar but the girls show up in their heels and pearls anyway. 

All that being said.. it's not a bad place. But when I read \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" it just seemed to hit the nail on the head.

Foghorn Chicken Wrap is good... if they still have it on the menu? Good pizza, awesome potato skins (but I'm pretty sure those are gone now), Granny's Fried Chicken Salad (something like that) is really good. I'm almost afraid to recommend any food, but most likely it won't be there if you choose ot try Angry's out. (Seriously)"}
{"text":"Location - average, nothing spectacular, enough to feel comfortable at.
Prices - cheap, food is under ten dollars
Food - you get what you pay, but for 7 or 8 dollar sandwiches and burgers, it's fine. The menu has a few interesting ideas. 

Overall - Can't find anything terribly wrong with this place, nor anything that wows. If you're in fun company, this place should be fine."}
{"text":"The crowd here SUCKS if you have any depth to your soul! The shallowness and snobbiness of the night time crowd here is unparallel to any other bar in Charlotte that I know of. That said - the staff is really really nice and the patio rocks! They typically have great live music in the summer time in the open air. The food is descent and the kitchen is quite accomodating. Parking is a bit limited but there are several bars on that street that you can visit within walking distance, as well as a bowling alley.  If you do descide to check it out make sure to say hey to Vita!"}
{"text":"Had a great time with friends, chicken nachos were great and the staff was friendly and right there when you need them...:)"}
{"text":"Good dive bar.   No complaints, and worth hopping to if you're already in Montford.  

I would come only come here to eat if I'm going to simultaneously obtain intoxication.  (i.e., I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for dinner.  But, if I've knocked back a few, I may as well order some nachos)."}
{"text":"So I came here with a group of coworkers for lunch. We were promptly seated and greeted by our server. She was very quick and efficient at taking our drink orders. When she returned with our drinks, we put in our food order. This is where the experience derailed. After taking our order, we waited probably 30-35 minutes for five sandwich/burgers to come out. Additionally, half our orders were mixed up. I had the angry as hell burger with tater tots. The tots were literally ice cold. I ordered the burger medium and it came out well done. Not sure what the kitchen was doing but they certainly are not doing this place any favors."}
{"text":"I wish there was an option to give Angry Ale's a negative score. I am extremely disappointed with my recent visit to this place. A family member flew in from out of the country to visit me and we were not allowed to go in because she did not have an \"American ID\". She's a tourist? With a valid visa to be in this country but the bouncer simply said im sorry you can't go in we only accept American Ids. I asked to speak to the manager but he was too busy to come out? To me this is discrimination, how would you feel if you're in France and cannot go in to a public bar because you only have an American passport and not a French ID. This was the same scenario for us. Before this incident I enjoyed going to Angry Ale's for lunch or drinks. However I do not support discrimination or racism therefore I will not go back to this place and incidents like this should not be swept under the rug this is why I went to the trouble of writing this review."}
{"text":"Me and my husband stopped in for lunch the other day for the first time and really enjoyed it!! Our waitress was super nice and provided great service. We got the pretzel bites as an appetizer and they were awesome. We both got burgers for lunch- my husband got the black n blue burger with tater tots, and I got the PCP burger (pimento cheese and fried pickles) with fries. The burgers were big and very tasty! We could only eat half because so much food. We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Was shocked how good the food was.  I highly recommend this place

I had the meat skewers with grilled veggies.  They were cooked perfectly and the price was reasonable 

The service was excellent.  I really hate I didn't eat at this restaurant while I lived near Charlotte.  I will go back on my next CLT visit!"}
{"text":"*hic*

The bartendress was beautiful and liberal with the booze.  I'm coming back!  

Oh, and the food was excellent.  I had the fish tacos."}
{"text":"This is a solid little bar in Montford. It reminds me of a college bar that you'd find in Athens or Chapel Hill. A little divey, a little loud, but mostly a-ok. The night we went, they had two alcohol promoters giving our free alcohol, so our tab was nice and cheap even with everyone enjoying their fair share of booze. They have local beer and lots of drink specials, even on weekends, which is a plus. They had TVs showing March Madness, a nice outdoor area for warm nights, and servers that came to your table so you don't have to fight for a spot at the bar. Not the kind of place that would become my favorite bar, but just fine for a few drinks with some friends."}
{"text":"As a tourist in the Queen City, I was looking for a good spot to hit up for lunch after a round on the links. I have a friend that went to Queens University and he suggested I try Angry Ale's. He's never steered me wrong, except for the one time I should date a girl just so I could be eskimo brothers with his friend...not the best decision on my part. There was also an occasion where he said I should do just 3-4 more Jameson shots and I woke up on a bathroom floor. Happy New Year to me.

I went in for lunch and ate the pulled pork burger in about 2 minutes. It was delicious and the 5 local beers I had with it hit the spot. The bartender was extremely nice and didn't even throw me out of the bar after I mentioned the friends name who recommended it to me. Apparently he built himself quite the reputation during his 4 years down there."}
{"text":"My wife and I head here often as Angry Ale's is close to our house, has a great patio, and often has good drink specials and pub food. As you would expect with anything in Montford, the day scene and weekend night scene are very different. My personal favorite time to go to AA's is in the afternoon to grab a drink outside and watch a game. The patio is dog friendly, which is a big plus for us as we often walk over with our dog from our house. Draft selection is decent and the food is what you would expect with pub fare. My favorite are the 'tot-chos' - better known as nachos with tater tots substituted for the tortilla chips. There is a reason why it has been around so long, definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Worst Packers bar ever. They try to please too many crowds on Sundays. You're either a Packers bar or you're not. Don't cater to the Panthers games on the outside area over Packers. Every single other bar does that. Cheeseheads come here for a reason."}
{"text":"Location is what gives it 4 stars. 
What gives it 0? Out of every beer almost on beer list. Ironic part is we were the table that ordered them. Took the waitress each trip to realize what they were out of. (Wouldn't you just keep a list? )
Also change your kegs and be prepared this is usually when beers change flavors and opening week of college football. 
Sorry this bar would never cut it in the big football cities. 
Seems they have tons of mixed shots which is cute if your back in the frat or need quick buzz."}
{"text":"I wish, I wish....

I wish #AngryAle's lived up to potential that oozes from its glamours and amazing patio area. 

I wish all the hype and noise you hear about this place around the Charlotte area was more than just noise and hype.  

I wish I liked this place more, but the undeniable fact, that I keep tucked away in the back of my mind, and that I only admit when I am writing yelp reviews at 2:00pm on rainy Monday afternoons, is that this place is a cool, hip, and popular, disappointment.  

What exactly makes Angry Ale's a disappointment?  First, the service.  I've been here a hand full of times and I have NEVER had what I would call good service while seated at a table, either inside or out.  I've sat at a table on the patio area and waited for what seems like an eternity for a waiter or waitress to take my order.  There's been times when I simply refused to wait any longer and migrated to the bar.  The only hope you have of every getting a decent level of service is to sit at the bar.  The tables might have salt, pepper, and napkins sometimes not.  Sometimes there will be ketchup, sometimes not.  Too often, disorganization and slow service are the thoughts I have when I leave Angry Ale's.  

Then there's the food.  Every time I look at the expansive menu, I see countless things that I want to try, and that seem like they would be really good.  Unfortunately, they  rarely taste as good as the menu describes.  Take the Big Chuck's Nacho's, for example.  Not very good.  Chips were really soggy, wasn't really hot, and the chicken didn't have much flavor (hence the need for salt and pepper).  In its defense, I can say I've had the Chicken Bacon sandwich at Angry Ale's and it was pretty good, just not close to great. 

Cool bar, with an amazing patio area.  Service can be described as uncaring and lackadaisical at best, and the food is only slightly better."}
{"text":"If this were simply a sports bar/grill spot I'd probably give Angry Ale's 3.5-stars. But, Angry Ale's is a Packer bar, so it gets a 5-start review. The food is always decent. The wait staff is always super friendly, even if they're sometimes slow. They have a good craft beer selection and always have a Packers game food special!"}
{"text":"I love Angry Ales for both night life and Sunday afternoon football! The food is great and the drink specials are even greater! It's a Packers bar but they have all games on various tvs in the bar as well as the patio. It's a great atmosphere and definitely will be back for many more Sundays!"}
{"text":"The Official Packers bar in CLT. Really In Charlotte N.C. Official Packers bar. WOW.Good Luck with that."}
{"text":"Love this place, especially on game days! Lots of tvs..great people! It's a packer bar so when their playing you have a nice group of green and yellow and a special menu. Love the specials and trivia night! Great food, must try the buffalo chicken dip! Is it your cheat day?..then please try one of their mac & cheese dishes...yum!"}
{"text":"I loved this place it was a great stop after visiting the dog park. I love the fact that dogs are welcomed into the patio area. When I had to use the restroom the waitress actually sat with my dog while I was gone. The service was excellent they were timely and even brought out a doggy water bucket for my dog.it actually wasn't a bad pace to enjoy a quiet lunch alone. I do wish the patio area was closed off since it's pet friendly but my dog had no problem being leashed to my chair. I had the bacon cheddar burger and it was really good. I can definitely see me and my dog coming back here."}
{"text":"I wish it were possible to leave zero stars for this establishment. Tonight I witnessed a bouncer physically grab a patron by the neck and throw him over the fence into a bush. There was no verbal warning before doing so. After the manager was informed the chaos continued. While standing near the next scuffle our drinks were spilled all over us and we were shoved during the process. When I attempted to share my concerns and frustrations with the manager he told us that we can just get the fuck out and that he didn't have the patience to deal with our problems. After paying for multiple drinks this is not how I was expecting to be treated. If you want to be treated with an ounce of respect do not go to this bar. The men that work there have a God complex and it's a lawsuit waiting to happen."}

{"text":"Just sat in there for 15 minutes & no one ever came to us so we left. We're a little bummed as it looked like a cool place to hang out."}
{"text":"Fun outdoors atmosphere. Decent staff though nobody will approach you unless you seek them nor greet you when you walk in or wait. 
Food mediocre, & don't try to eat while seated outside as your food might taste like ashes considering the number of smokers who I'm assuming come to the establishment for that sole purpose."}
{"text":"Every so often we would get tired of the other spots on Montford. Leaving us with Angry Ales as a choice. We would go there, but always regret it after mediocre food, lunches taking 1.5+ hours, and the least helpful servers around. 

One Friday a group ventured to the Angry Ales patio. Another regretful experience that spiraled into what I could only call 'near death weekend.' Angry Ales infected 19 of my friends including myself with the Norovirus . Take food poising and amp it up 10x and that's what you can expect from the Norovirus. Thirty Six hours of pure pain, vomiting, a fever, and other flu like symptoms. 

All of us filed complaints with the health department. The inspector went out and confirmed multiple reports of the Norovirus being spread from a cook."}
{"text":"Dare I say I actually like Angry Ales?  I only go here during the week, but everytime I go I have a good time. The bartenders and bouncer always remember me and the drinks are cheap.  I have had the potachos here which were good, but I'm not really expecting anything from a bar.  Though they do have what I like to call \"grease truck sandwiches\" which are things like steak sandwiches topped with mozzarella sticks.  The crowd is usually varied from 21-30 with it being more weighted towards 21.  Also, I really like the deck in the summer.  Its a good place to go out and just talk to random people who don't deserve my stupidity.  I never been here on the weekend, but its on Montford so there is always somewhere to go if its beat."}
{"text":"Service needs some serious improvements! They have a dive bar vibe going on but that doesn't mean you should be ignored by the servers. I have had to chase them down to get another round or a check. Its definitely a place for college kids to hang out at."}
{"text":"So this place gets a 3.5 Stars from me.  It's a sports bar... not my typical m.o., but good for groups if you are  with a bunch of drooling sports fans.

Outdoor seating, cheap prices, pretty good service.  We had a sweet little thing named LA who successfully deflected all of the pickup lines from the married men at the table next to us while keeping a smile on her face.  Impressive.  You go girl - extra points for her.

The food was nothing to rave about, but the hand cut fries were on point.

They typically have some live music (90's covers mostly), girls that are just tipsy enough to not walk a straight line, guys in pastel polos & khakis, and pounders... lots and lots of pounders.  On a weekend night this place is wall-to-wall people.

Cornhole in the parking lot.  Within walking distance to lots of other bars & restaurants.  

Overall, not too shabby!"}
{"text":"My friends and I come here pretty often, and we really like it. The atmosphere is awesome and the patrons are always friendly...It's a \"happy drunk\" sort of bar ! 

The food is good- no complaints. We've gotten the nachos, pretzel bites, burgers, ect. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because sometimes the drinks don't taste as alcoholic as they should be lol !! I asked for a double rum and coke, but it tasted like a single. But no big deal... It was on special."}
{"text":"Ok. Been here multiple times. Good food good drinks great looking staff!  ;). Ok more than multiple times. This is MY neighborhood.  Stay away from the shrimp dip unless you are a horse in need of your salt lick. Fried pickles are great but not nearly as good as the \"DIAMOND\" 's.  OMG OMG OMG.  The cuban sliders are crazy good!!!   I lived in fl. for a short min. And know what a good cuban is.  This far north...  This this is good.   I gtg. There is one more slider left.   :)   - corbin"}
{"text":"GREAT DRINKS! Good bar food, too, if you are fan of all things fried! Definitely go and check out their deck. Good for big groups."}
{"text":"Looking for a place to have lunch on Saturday and everything was packed.  We pulled in here and although this looks like and is more of a bar than a restaurant the food was sooooo good! I had the philly cheese steak and my mom had the shrimp Po boy.  The philly had lots of onions and peppers and a queso cheese which gave moisture to the whole sandwich and made it great.  The fries were fresh and soooo good.  Usually fries are just a mediocre afterthought but these were medium sized, spicy, and crisp. Great service.  I would like to go back for more of a night time bar visit.  They had a whole menu of cool shots to order."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this restaurant if you are a burger fan!
I ordered take out here and got a burger and it was absolutely delicious. 
The service was fast, the employees were very friendly & not to mention that my burger was exactly how I liked it. 
If you are ever in the area or would like a great burger with a cold ale, check out Angry Ale's."}
{"text":"I come here all the time after work and never had an issue with service but today is a sad service day.

Update: Service and wings were amazing!"}
{"text":"Any food I have had here has been amazing especially the mac'n'cheese. They have really good drink specials too. There is one bartender that I love she is always so nice and always works wednesday nights."}
{"text":"I know angry ale's for years.. this place is awesome to finish your day and meet up friends for a drink! For a bar they have a great mane and great food!"}
{"text":"Definitely a place for the younger twenty-something crowd, the thing that sets Ale's apart for me is the patio. The inside is decent but not overly spacious, and can get pretty crowded and definitely smoky in a hurry. 

A smaller seating area exists to the right of the bar area, and a single-table pool room leads to the patio, which sports its own bar to alleviate the need to take on the crowd to get a drink.

Thursday evening seems to be the time to experience the true Ale's crowd, which ranges from scantily-clad socialites to volleyball and softball teams looking to relax with a pitcher or four. 

I've only eaten here once, but I recall the menu as being largey burgers, sandwiches and bar food, but faily extensive. They do serve until 2 am though, which is great. 

Toss in live music on some Thursdays as well, and its a decent place to spend a summer evening."}
{"text":"The outdoor patio is kinda nice, sure could use a bath though, really sticky dirty tables. 
Our server was training someone why I don't know, she was in such a hurry if you didn't blurt out what you wanted quickly she was gone, no real check to ever see if anyone wanted more to eat or drink, if you didn't grab her when she was buzzing by it wasn't going to happen, keep in mind there was a total of 6 other people on the patio with our group of 4, no idea why she was in such a rush. 
The food was decent, actually probably better than I remember, probably because I had no fork or napkin, kind of hard to eat buffalo bites without at least a napkin (especially after touching the dirty tables). 
I'd probably go back, as long as I brought some wet wipes. 
Overall I would say this is more of a younger type bar, like 25 or younger."}
{"text":"If you are looking to run into someone from high school then this is the bar for you.  Or if you are 30 and looking to meet girls in their young 20s that have nothing better to do than hang out at this bar all the time.  The bathroom was a complete shithole and most of the people there seemed like douche bags.  Some guy knocked my beer out of my hand and I yelled at him.  He then smirked at me and told me that if I apologized to him he would replace my beer.  This place only gets 2 stars (instead of 1) because I ran into an old friend who was working there and that was a nice surprise."}
{"text":"The beer here is very good, we tried a couple of things off they menu and pleasantly  surprising all of it was good!!! Try the mac & cheese, AWESOME!!!

We sat out on the patio and it was awesome as well... The service is so so but who cares once you get your beer, right, Lol."}
{"text":"Good place to hang with friends and have a beer.  Live music was playing this past Saturday night and the pool tables were rockin and the outside was slammed.  Funny drunk people watching!"}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!!!
Horrible customer service!! Racist employees and managers!! IF they do serve you, the odds of your order being wrong are higher then the contrary!
I work too hard for my money, to be treated like it's less green then... The bills of my peers."}
{"text":"This is supposed to be a Packers bar, but being a Packers fan it is quite disappointing. Sure the game is on with the TV sound in the two side rooms, but if it were a true Packers bar the beer would always be flowing and the waitresses would be more attentive to making sure that was happening. 

Service has always been terrible no matter what time I've been here: happy hour, dinner, Sunday after softball, Packers game. Don't come here and expect to be served. You might even have to get up from your table to get your own drink. 

I will say the food is good though and that buffalo chicken dip is fire"}
{"text":"Always great, always fun. If getting chicken, opt for the fried over the grilled. The mac and cheese is killer too. Also a good place for App State games."}
{"text":"I am not really a huge fan of the food, but I give it three stars for the beer selection. They even had Cold Mountain!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give zero stars.  I wrote in a compaint on their website over a week ago and have yet to hear back from ANYONE.  This place has no respect for their customers' privacy and credit card information."}
{"text":"Great place to order from late at night when you're studying for finals or working late. The buffalo chicken dip is by far the best I have had. I was surprised that Angry Ale's had better buffalo chicken dip than Wild Wing Cafe. The tortilla chips are always fresh and never too salty. The spinach artichoke dip is also really good. It has the right consistency and has the right amount of ingredients. I have had spinach dip with too much artichoke, but this is perfectly balanced. I usually don't get regular food because I don't have time to sit down and eat a meal. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a pub style restaurant or bar/grill."}
{"text":"The place to chill with a few pitchers of beer after a group sport. I've only ever sat in the patio and it's wonderful when the weather is mild, i.e. not humid. Couple of TVs spread around, always tuned into some sports game. Service is really friendly but can be slow, so expect to wait if you need anything from a waiter/ess, unless you chase em down. Food is just aiite, they no longer have the tree hugger burger or portobello burger. Veggie wrap is just okay and fish tacos would be much better if they provided a lime to go with it. 

Great place to just hang out and watch a game. You can probably find me here at least once a week...but don't, bc that'd be stalking."}
{"text":"Met a girl friend here for lunch yesterday.  I have some slight concerns about how expensive it was (I got a BBQ chicken wrap and 2 vodka drinks which were on special and it was $30 something).  The tater tots were great, the wrap was good, and the drinks were strong.  Had a good time."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever experienced. I am not only talking about one server, but we had at least three different servers taking our order and not one of them gave us respect. At one point, after we waited 15 minutes for a drink order, the waitress who dropped off our drinks told us she couldn't take the rest of our drink orders because she wasn't our server. And then continued to walk away after we asked if we could order a drink from her. Our appetizer also came after our meals did. Our server didn't even know who ordered what at our table and told us after 20 minutes of waiting for the tab that \"it'd just be easier for her if we would split the bill in half\"."}
{"text":"Time went: 11:20pm-ish

Crowd: Busy, people come to hang out at the bar, table, or patio just to chill and out with friends.

Music: Okay, actually... I don't even remember

Service: Good and attentive - the bartenders that is.

Place: Typical bar place, but feels blah. Another 2 restrooms place for the women's while there is a long line to wait..

This place is fine just to go to for a change of scenery from Andrew Blair's and Brazwells.  But I don't like staying here too long since its just not my cup of tea. I can tell you this, the boys loved the place - guy's hangout place :)"}
{"text":"I'm being generous by giving 2 stars. I've been hearing about Angry Ales for months from coworkers, boasting about how good these burgers are. And in my pursuit of happiness and the perfect burger, I decided to step in and try it for myself.
   I like to buy groupon or living social coupons just for reasons like today. My wife and I walked in about 1130am and there were a few patrons at the bar. Waitress shouted across the bar, \"you can sit anywhere!\". Nothing like being greeted in an kind and hospitable way. Our waitress was friendly enough. 
   I asked for the beer special, a 32oz \"\"Blue Moon\" and it was brought out promptly in a large plastic cup. Not cute to me. 
   For my burger, I ordered the \"Angry as Hell\" and it did make me angry as hell, because it was not good at all.
   My wife ordered the big kahuna and it was underwhelming. Very small and she didn't even finish it. She did enjoy her fries she said. 
 Another first and last."}
{"text":"This place is next to my house and it is a great place to go. Located on monford where there is plenty of other bars that you can walk to. I love that their is an outdoor picnic area and they are pet friendly, my dog loves to come with us which is perfect.
There Mac and cheese is amazing!!!!!! I love it, it's so cheesy and you can add jalapeños. 
Great atmosphere and great place to watch sports"}
{"text":"Very friendly bar staff. Food is delicious - options are your average bar fare, but prepared very well. The pimento cheese burger is delicious. 

Nice beer options. I am becoming a regular."}
{"text":"One of my fav places to hang out in Charlotte. They have a nice big patio and lotta screens to watch a game or two. 
Nice beer and food options."}
{"text":"Very dissappointed. Sunday afternoon..hardly anyone in the place and our order took a long time to come out. Not surprising because the burgers were overcooked. Ordered the PCP burger - with pimento cheese, fried pickles and bacon. The burger lacked taste..could only distinguish the bacon..everything else had no distinct flavor. The French fries were overcooked and soggy and had a slight taste  of fish.. No kids menu so ordered them sliders. The sliders had better taste..which leads us to think that the sliders are fresh made and the larger burgers are frozen. Hence the lack of flavor on the bigger burger. Family consensus is go back to Five Guys."}
{"text":"I always enjoy Angry ale's.  It's a great bar with decent food.  Just this past weekend I had their Mac & Cheese with bacon and steak. It was great. Their french fries were amazing! They always have great specials even on the weekend."}
{"text":"i love this place its typical dive bar setting with a great porch and the wait staff is very friendly and attentive.. what makes this place stand out is the food they have some very creative sandwiches. when we go i always get the fat Sanchez its a cheese steak with mozzarella sticks french fries and jalapenos smothered in cheese and some funky sauce. we usually get the not yet famous egg rolls they are amazing. i highly recommend it and will go back often."}
{"text":"Great patio with shaky tables (without the patio this would have been two stars) The beer selection is okay but better across the street at Ducks. I had some wings that were below average with about 3-4 cases of soggy chicken skin which is a big no no for wings in my opinion.
On of the beer \"specials\" were 5 dollar domestic tall boys."}
{"text":"While Angry Ale's is DEFINITELY frat-tastic (over-the-top preppy behavior is on display here: pink polos, croakies, short shorts), with a demographic largely made up of UNC grads, it's pretty good for what it is: a fratty bar. 

We love going here during basketball season, when every UNC (and ACC) game is on TV and the bar is packed with enthusiastic fans. You can catch pretty much any sporting event you'd like here, although don't plan on being able to focus/hear. This place is rowdy. 

Good beer and drink specials, and a nice (rowdy) outdoor area that gets totally packed when it's warm out. This place gets wild on Thursdays. 

Decent food of the pub variety. Decent \"games\" too--pool, foosball, that slidy game. Fun place."}
{"text":"Great flavor. Nice ambiance.  Good menu. Clean and comfortable.  Good lunch spot.  Had chicken and steak kabobs.  Plenty of food and priced reasonably."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. Been here for lunch and been here at night for drinks. And I like it here.

The food is pretty good. It's bar food. But it's better bar food than a lot of places around the way. I like the burgers and wings especially.  

It's a great place to hang out and have pitchers of beer with your buddies and chill. Lots of tvs. And the patio situation rocks! 

A+++"}
{"text":"I just came in for a beer to kill some time.  

The actual bar area is nice and large with plenty of seating around it.  Because this bar is very deep, the TV's seem very far away.  There is outside seating as well.

The servers/bartenders were doing a great job & were very friendly.  

The bar patrons themselves were a bit of a mixed bag, with some definitely drunk & scruffy individuals wandering around and standing about talking to themselves.

This isn't probably going to be on my bar list as somewhere I'd feel comfortable going by myself."}
{"text":"I think A-OK is the definition of this establishment. I have been a few times and each time the food and service were fine but not exemplary. The bar specials are pretty decent (Thursdays 32 ounces of a variety of beer, Blue Moon included for $4), but the bar gets so crowded it is a liability to walk around with a beverage. They also have a single bathroom for women which is never enough especially for a bar this size. The inside of the establishment always seems unnecessarily dimly lit as well.

The menu, however, does offer a good selection of food for a very reasonable price. My favorite entrée is the $9 protein plate - chicken skewers, zucchini with onion and spinach sautéed with tomato.  I love that this bar has a healthy option that does not involve paying $$ for a bag of salad mix like many other bars. And this way I can feel better about downing my 32 ounces of beer. 

I also love that they allow pets on the patio and they brought out a pitcher of water just for our dog."}
{"text":"I use grub hub to order takeout from this location about once a week. I almost always order the crazy Greek (Greek style turkey burger) with fries along with some other things. No matter what I order the food is always delish and different from anything else in Charlotte. I work in a kitchen so I appreciate quality for a good price. I would recommend this location to all my friends. Compliments to the chef (:"}
{"text":"Yep.  Four stars my friends.

It started as a party of four at Good Food on Montford.  Yes, I know the place is fantastic, but after we had spent a lot of money already and were still somewhat hungry.  What is there to do?  Yep... Angry Ale's.  

We finished off the night with an order of Chicken Fingers.  Some tossed in buffalo, some basic with dips.  I know I was already a few glasses of wine into the evening, but I know great chicken tenders when I eat them!  These tasted so fresh, so moist, and perfectly fried crispy.  

We have been here before and support the local bars, but this stood out and I had to leave a review.  Great beers and well-above-average bar food!  The menu gets creative and the staff is excellent."}
{"text":"About what you would expect. Typical dive bar.  Been here a couple times and recently for football Sunday/Halloween pup crawl. Just went for drinks and service was slow both at the bar and with waitress at a table outside. Cool place to hang out and watch football on a nice day."}
{"text":"The first time I went to this resturaunt I knew I would be coming back, and I did...and I brought friends! I would recommend sitting on the patio, even on a warm night! The food is really excellent bar food. I would highly recommend the southwest salad with hot ranch. My husband loves the burgers and macaroni and cheese. Everything on the menu is great. Just keep in mind, that on game nights, it does get really loud. 

The staff is nice. Also keep in mind on game nights the wait staff are not as quick to serve you. They also keep the televisions quite loud. They have great drink specials."}
{"text":"I've been here on several occasions for drinking purposes (late-night), but haven't had the pleasure of eating here until a few months back. The mindset behind thisvisit was clear: loading up on a ton of classic, greasy American food before my summer in Tokyo, Japan. 

 Let me say this: Angry Burger delivered! Their burgers are absolutely amazing (I got their signature), and simply cannot fit in your mouth properly. This was fine, as I housed it in the messiest way possible. And what better than their delicious sweet potato fries to compliment said burger? Of course, washed it all down with a delicious Sweetwater 420. Pretty much had to be carried out of the restaurant, thanks Grace (yelp elite '12) for your assistance!

ANGRY ALES FTW!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was the fact that my team (Wisconsin Badgers) was killing San Diego State...maybe it was the fact that Angry Ale's was pretty open & not filled with drunkies mid-Saturday afternoon....maybe it was the tasty sweet potato fries....or maybe it was my husband's low key company but I really liked Angry Ale's. 

I went in with modest expectations - I wanted some good bar food, a table and a chance to watch the game. Overall - Angry Ale's delivered. Now, don't get me wrong - it's a sports bar with a menu. It's not a place to bring children or expect gourmet cuisine. It's not the nicest sports bar I've ever been to, but it's certainly not the diviest. The bathrooms were clean, the waitress (Lindsay) was nice and attentive and the food was pretty good!

I ordered the Baby Burger w/cheese - A 4 ounce patty with cheddar, lettuce, tomato on a toasted bun. I choose sweet potato fries as my side. The juicy burger was just enough to satisfy me and I adored the toasted bun. The fries were a total winner - nicely cut sweet potato fries with cinnamon sugar dusted over the top. NOM.

Prices were affordable for food and drinks and TVs were plentiful. I'll definitely come back to Angry Ale's to watch another game - as long as it's not super crowded!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Order the Jack Daniels Burger. Much better and tastier than the 
TGI Friday's version. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"We've been here a couple of times and the poor service does not disappoint.  I'm not sure if they're understaffed or the staff has tables inside and out that causes them to be so slow but both times the service has been painful.  The food is average at best, bar food and not good enough for us to come back.
The bar itself seems like it could be great.  They need a lot of improvement to beat the competition that's right next door!"}
{"text":"Soooooo good!   We got the redneck dip which was delicious and their fries are indeed crispy and great.   For entrees I got the mac and cheese with chicken and broccoli and my husband got the po boy.  Both delicious and huge portions.   Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Quick and attentive service. Excellent fish tacos and tater tots! Portions are huge."}
{"text":"Yuck. All around. Dirty, nasty, and tacky! We had wings there which literally glowed under the \"awesome\" black lights. We call them Snot Wings. There are plenty o'dive bars out there which are good and good for ya. This is not one of them."}
{"text":"Ehhh, if you are going for the young sports bar feel - this is your place.  Food is ok, very bar like, and atmosphere is a little dirty, bathrooms especially. I kinda new this, coming here - but were looking for somewhere low key to have a beer with a group of 10 friends.  I'd maybe come back, but wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Food was good and that is the only reason for the rating being mediocre. Our service was horrendous. Our server was extremely rude and short with us- acted like she would rather wait on the table or mid-twenties men instead of pay us attention. She then took our cards for payment and took fifteen minutes to run them. She instead flirted with her other tables until we reminded her that she had our cards. The food was good but the terrible service killed our experience."}
{"text":"A good, solid place for multiple occasions.

I have been to Angry Ale's on multiple occasions at different times during the week.  I usually go here on a weekend night to let loose after a long week, but have also been here for a few afternoon drinks and lunch/dinner.  I am not sure if Angry Ale's is trying to market itself as a restaurant that serves drinks or a bar that serves food.  If it is the latter, then they definitely have some of the best bar food around.  It is a very diverse menu that goes beyond the traditional burger and chicken fingers that seem to be the flagship items of most bar menus.

I am a little mixed on attending this place during the winter.  One of the great things about Angry Ale's is the outdoor seating, but it is not too much fun when it is 20 something degrees out.   Needless to say, this is one of my go to places during the spring and summer months.  

On weekend nights, Angry Ale's seems to attract a college and just out of college crowd, which is right up my ally, but might be unappealing to others.  During afternoon hours, it is sparsely crowded with alcoholics with very entertaining stories and other locals who are just looking for a chill spot to hang out. The pool tables are a nice outlet for entertainment if you are looking to pass some time.

Overall, I would recommend Angry Ale's to anyone of my age and lifestyle."}
{"text":"This place is open til 2am.... Not too many places are in Charlotte. In the mood to watch a game... there are multiple TVs on the inside and outside. College football is in. #Godawgs #SEC Service is GREAT thus far and the place is spacious!!! Even have room for pets on the outside patio."}
{"text":"Angry ales in one of my favorite bars. The food here is amazing and the drink specials are great. I love coming here for panther games. I come here at least once or twice a week and this place never fails. I recently attended a playoff packers game and had such a great time. This packer fans were legit. Anyway you should check this place out."}
{"text":"We come here once awhile because it is close to home.  The food is good in general, fries and tots are the best.  While their burgers are my go to meals, they seem to always have the meat well done. So be aware.  
Good outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Angry Ales is one of those a places where you can just hang out side and have a beer, 2, or 3.   

The wait staff was helpful the crowd in general was inviting.

The food was average bar food but that won't stop me from coming back. Good places like this where you can comfortabley go and watch a game are awesome places to find."}
{"text":"In the world of bar food, this place is alright by me! They have great drink prices and options. I've had everything from a blue moon to cherry limeade and have been pleased. 

We are pretty much creatures of habit here. My boyfriend always gets the mac and cheese with steak, bacon and jalapeños. He loves it and never wants to try anything else. I stick with the buffalo chicken wrap. My favorite sauce for the wrap is the hot honey (or is it honey hot?). I've tried different sides but my favorite is the homemade chips. They are cooked to order and can be just as crunchy or soft (which I prefer) as you'd like. The portion sizes are huge and we've never been able to finish what they give us. 

Fancy? Nah. But tasty and consistent? Yes. Therefore, it's a win in my book."}
{"text":"Honestly I love this restaurant bar but today will be my last day EVER going into that place. Usually their wait staff is quick & efficient in how quickly they come over to greet and take your drink order but today I waited 20 minutes to even be glanced at. I sat down by myself on my lunch break and was waiting to be greeted but it didn't come until a couple came and sat directly behind me and THEN a waitress sauntered over, I completely understand having a large lunch rush and I have no problem with waiting but what really ticked me off was the fact that she came over promptly and greeted them and said nothing to me as if I wasn't there. And then happened to look back at the table and then see me and just said \"I'll get to you in a few minutes,\" reassuring isn't it ? Not at all. Maybe you need more wait staff or maybe you need to train them better but you've lost a customer of a long time."}
{"text":"Why are you so angry?  Is it because you had to paint everything since the fire in a red and black motif from your previous green and white?  Or maybe it is because you got a mixed drink here that tasted awful?  That is why I am...well, I guess more bummed than angry.  

Atmosphere -   college kids, softball leagues, occasional trouble maker, red and lots of black paint, same setup as before, cool deck area w/ TV's, pool area (fyi, not for swimming).

Food - I ate here pre-fire and the food was okay bar food, as in I loved their tater tots.  They were really good tots.  I have not eaten here since the renovation.

Drinks - This review is on the drinks, which when they were of the mixed variety were bad.  I am not sure what was wrong.  Maybe the syrup mixture was off or the bartender was off.  Whatever it was, the mixed drinks went down like broken glass.  Speaking of breaking glass, that is not a problem here.  The cups and pitchers they serve in are of the plastic variety, which is probably a good thing when a rowdy softball group shows up after a game.  

Price - I forget...it was either the same or cheaper than Brazwells.  So you got that...

Overall - I would come here for the drink specials, as in domestic beer drink specials.  As for anything else, I am not sure about that because I would not want to make you...bummed."}
{"text":"I have gone to this bar a few times and each time I've gone there have been issues. The worst came a few weeks ago when I attended  a friends \"going away\" party. We got in and set a table, the whole nine yards. We all got food but it wasn't until a plate of some sort of fried chicken was delivered to our table that I cringed. Halfway into her bite, a friend noticed a beetle looking bug about the size of a penny in her chicken. She scraped it off thinking there was no way a bug that big could have made it, but alas, it did and she was lucky she didn't bite into it. We showed the waitress who then took the food back. That's it. No apologies, nothing.  We then barely saw her again but when we got our bill.  Upon leaving the 3 of us who had ordered food all felt sick. I spent  the next two days throwing up and so did my boyfriend and a the third person who ordered food. Seeing as how we each only got single drinks, alcohol intoxication was out of the question.  When we got home we realized that not only us, but several others sitting with us had been charged for extra drinks. When I called up to discuss things with the manager, the lady that answered informed me I must be wrong, because that waitress wouldn't deliver us bad food. The manager then said the same thing, denying there could be a bug because he \"inspected\" the kitchen the day before and we must all have gotten sick a different way.  This was followed by 10 minutes of us going back and forth with him saying that he would refund the 5 dollars for the extra drink. No real apologies, or decent customer service. This place is disgusting."}

Great wings and I'll admit it and eat my words, it's a Packers spot to watch the game. My original review was based on preseason which wasn't completely wrong but regular season the fans come out to support America's True Team. With that being said, AA is a cool spot to watch the Packers. I was contacted by someone on Yelp saying it's a Packers bar, so I felt the need to update my review. I stick with my review in part of the NC Panthers love this spot as well but there is a dedicated Packers room but they should deck it out in Pack gear and truly support the team. The room is always Pack only so I've officially dumped Blackfinn in Ballentyne for AA.  Blackfinn was cool but sometimes I need to curse when the boys are playing bad and Bkackfinn is a family spot.

NOT A PACKERS BAR!!!! It's a Panther's bar.

Not one Green Bay Packers anything on the wall just nothing. They claim to have a Packers section and that's BS, I saw more Panthers crap than anything.

Go Pack Go, still trying to find a true Packers home, the hunt continues.

Now my personal feelings aside, their bartender was attentive and I enjoyed the diversity here. Their outside patio has several wide screen TVs and a full bar. I didn't get to try any of their food but the folks there looked to have enjoyed the food. My main reason for going was bc they said they were a Packers bar. I'm going to give Angry Ale's another try during a regular season game just so I get the full experience.

To any Packers fan reading this, Blackfinn in Ballentyne has agreed to host all Packers game and currently working towards becoming a Packers bar."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a better rating if the service didn't consistently suck. The food is good and I like the atmosphere but we continue to get horrible waitress after horrible waitress.

At first, I thought it was just the waitress we had. She would wait on us every time we went. But it wasn't. They forget about you or take forever to get something you asked. Orders come out wrong, etc.

Last night, a group of us went to Ales to watch the game. It probably took the waitress 20 minutes (not joking) to greet us. She seemed flustered and even without us having to say anything, she told us it was her first night. Ok management - maybe its not a good idea to have a girl start on a night where the city's professional football team is playing in a prime time game. But even then, they weren't THAT busy. 

It probably took our appetizers AT LEAST 30 minutes to be brought out after we ordered them. We could never find our server to ask for anything. It was just awful."}
{"text":"Light blue polo shirts. \"Six gill\" pleated khakis. 40 oz. $3 beers on Thursday night. One of these three things is really sexy. Guess which one? 

Angry Ale's has lots of TVs to watch sports and a \"high tech\" shuffle board that keeps score electronically. Pretty advanced. What isn't advanced is the service. Our server, while she was very sweet, seemed to have misplaced our table and we had to wait a while between beers. Angry's seemes to be short staffed and, according to my local friends, this seems to be a constant problem. The prices and variety of bar food and beer makes up for this. Another good thing is the patio. Lots of room to escape the smoke. Just be sure to let the server know where you're going."}
{"text":"My boyfriend got up to go to the bathroom. I had noticed that they changed the bowl for the Mac and cheese, so I asked about it. The server said yes, it was smaller. The manager cut in and said no, it was the same. Smirked at me and asked if he was going to have to prove it. I asked him not to smirk at me. He leaned on my table and told me he had NOT smirked at me. At this point I'm essentially trapped between him and the wall. Now, if you're picturing this at home, you also need to know that I was wearing a brace on my leg, so he knew I was disabled when he made the move to intimidate me. I said, please don't be so aggressive with me. He informed me that I didn't need to be rude to him, that he was TRYING to be polite, and repeated that the bowls were the same. I said, that's fine, okay, please step away from me. He said, I'm the general manager, are you going to be a problem? Escalated the whole thing way beyond a simple question. This is the place we went on our first date, so it's someplace really special to me, and now I don't feel like I can go back. I'm very hurt and disappointed."}
{"text":"I honestly don't know why this place doesn't have a better rating! The wait staff is awesome, the food is way better than your average bar food, and the bar itself has a great atmosphere. This place is always a go to."}
{"text":"Typical bar food but the drinks are where it's at. The moonshine slushed are yummy!..especially when you mix them together!"}
{"text":"The BEST salad on Montford!! The best salad on Montford is called \"The Montford\"! I wish I would have thought to post a picture before it was almost gone.. Great mix of lettuce, chopped sweet pecans, I sub out the blue cheese crumbles for Feta and add blacken grilled chicken. No where compares to this salad! As I tell my friends and co workers \"it's the best salad I have ever had\"! Balsamic vinegette!"}
{"text":"Yes, I have become one of those sports league people who hang out here after a game.  Quite frankly that free pitcher of beer (Angry Ale's partners with the league organization) is the highlight for us (look... it's our first year and we don't \"suck\" per se, we just haven't quite figured out how to win yet, haha).  There's always a decent crowd for a Tuesday night.  One reason is music trivia, which is fun if you like that kind of things (winning free beers and gift cert can be motivating).  However, it's loud, and they play inside and outside so there's no place to hide.

The most disappointing thing of this place is the service.  It's fine when you're with a group of friends, or watching a game, not in a hurry and just enjoy being there.  But if you want to order food right away because you just broke out of prison starving, or if you want a cold beer PRONTO because... heck that's why you are at a bar to begin with, well, good luck buddy!  My advice: go up to the bar and do it youself.  

Food/drink are your typical neighborhood bar offerings.  On Tuesdays they have $1.75 silver bullets (Coors Light). Tater tots are awesome (I had the loaded one as well... I wasn't too impressed, the melted cheese was just there on the top, not evenly distributed).  I just tried the Ale's Burger, which has fried egg along with 1 onion ring, lettece, tomato, cheese & mayo (I skipped the pickle).  It was pretty good.  I ordered the small portion (1-4oz pattie instead of 2) and it's plenty for me, $6 for a burger with tots.  Before the fire, they had the most awesome onion rings, I haven't tried it yet since they re-opened.

I give it 3-star instead of 2 simply because I do like it enough to keep coming back.  It's a good chill spot on a street where drinking has become a little high-end."}
{"text":"A dive-ish sports bar, it's an interesting spot with excellent burgers, a billion television sets and a reasonable selection of mass-produced beers.

I met a few friends here, but I was late to arrive. By the time I showed up, they had already placed their orders and the menus cleared. When i was able to flag down a waitress, I ordered a burger (someone suggested the Carolina) and the sweet potato fries. And a PBR, because it seemed appropriate.

The kitchen was able to fast track my burger so it showed up at the same time as my friends. The Carolina is seriously messy but it's loaded with fatty meaty greasy goodness. And the sweet potato fries were excellent.

We didn't stick around for long - down the road to bowl!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went for a quick drink before going out to dinner to meet some friends! It was busy, but it was so fun to see all the App fans there to cheer on ASU. Even at random tables! 4 stars because at one point, all the TV's in the bar glitched, so we had to watch on someone's phone. (I was with some hardcore App fans)"}
{"text":"Decent food and patio but really bad service. I still come here every few months because I live a few blocks away but the service is consistently poor."}
{"text":"For being called an \"ales\" place. There's barely a beer selection. The beer menu isn't actually accurate, in addition. The Mac and cheese I got was THE BOMB but it was so massively salty I took 5 bites and bloated up like a blue whale. Everyone with me agreed it was barely edible. It's a great place to chill with friends and a PBR and watch a game outdoors. But other than that....eh."}
{"text":"I said three stars - my boyfriend said four - so let's say 3.5 stars. 
Went for a quick bite before a movie. We had the pretzel bites for an appetizer. I had the El Camino Cesar salad, my boyfriend had sliders with fries. Fries I stole were yummy! Salad was a little blah but as a vegetarian I am always pleased to see several options on a menu for me, I'll try something different next time. 
Service was fast and friendly. We made the movie with time to spare."}
{"text":"What makes AA so great?  Patio, Patio, Patio!  Location helps too... it's located off of Montford so it's pretty easy to walk to after some bowling or drinking at the other \"hot\" spots to go to.  A good bit of space inside as well on the colder, not so nice days to be inside.  Tons of TVs to catch sports games and a variety of menu items to keep the drinking stomach fueled and ready to process more alcohol... or whatever spirits you deem worthy.

The parking for AA's is like other places on Montford, a bit of a challenge.  Never-the-less on the street parking never fails, and there is a decent size lot around the place.  Don't park at Andrew Blairs for fear of towing (if in doubt, look for the signs).

Had some decent half priced wings on Saturday afternoon on the deck.  The atmosphere and quickly prepared wings with some extra wing dipping sauce made my afternoon complete.

You can imagine the night I had... since I left my credit card in the bill-fold.  Luckily I called the next day and it was waiting for me behind the bar after some photo ID checkage.  I did take my \"walk of shame\" back to the car the next day since I was not coherent enough to remember to get my card after paying the bill.  We'll blame it on \"forgetfulness.\""}
{"text":"I mean, I get why people wouldn't want to go here. However, if you're a fan of patios, beer and good times close to home, this is your place."}
{"text":"This place seems like a high school or college hangout, but my volleyball team used to meet here after matches.  The food is good and they have lots of TVs, I'll give them that.   Typical bar food."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. Bar waitresses pay no attention to you, granted they're busy, but service is service.
Also a weird, lingering bathroom freshener smell.  Kind of gross."}
{"text":"I placed an order for a large to-go order from Angry Ale's on Saturday for a birthday party on Sunday.  I was coming from out of town and wanted an easy way to get some bar food for the party.  When I went to pick up the order, I went to the bar and paid and they kindly offered me assistance to carry the food out to the car.  So far so good.

Unfortunately, as I was unpacking the food at the party location I saw that one order was missing and three orders had the wrong side.  The food was fine but I made the mistake of ordering items that didn't hold for very long in to-go containers.  Nothing was crispy and the food got cold quickly.

I reached out to the restaurant through a link on their website to see if they could give me some of my money back for the incorrect order.  It's been a few weeks now with no contact.

My experience was disappointing to say the least."}
