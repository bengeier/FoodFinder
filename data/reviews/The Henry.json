{"text":"The wait was twice as long as they said it would be, the ambiance is refined, the drinks were cold and tasty, the appetizers expensive for what they were, the food was good but not great and on the expensive side.  We might try it again just for drinks, but it was not as good as we had expected it to be."}
{"text":"Food was good. Wine was good. Ambience was good but we did not care for the loud and up beat 50s/60s music. 

The octopus appetizer is great. We split the veal Parmesan and the spicy vodka rigatoni. Both were good. We had a glass of leviathan and Barolo. 

It is a bit expensive, in my opinion for what you get. 

Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"The Henry has delicous food and great service. Stopped in for a quick bite and left extremely satisfied.  Can't beat the location and ambiance of The Henry."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here today with a mimosa
Let me just tell you best mimosa I have ever had!!!
Great food too! Enjoy"}
{"text":"Henry the food here Tastes good amazing full of flavor awesome repeatedly coming back. This Cosmopolitan is the spot. Food for the whole package."}
{"text":"I met with a group of friends for dinner, and it was the first time any of us had been there. The decor was inviting and I loved the attached coffee bar, patio seating and the open kitchen. The atmosphere was lively and comfortable. We each had some cocktails, a main dish, and an appetizer. Everything we ate tasted fantastic, and I was happy with the food. However, service was very slow. We had to send back our guacamole because one half of the avocado was not ripe enough and was sitting at the bottom as a solid chunk. They did remake it for us. It took over 30 minutes to get 4 cocktails (highly recommend the fig and ginger mule!) because they missed our drink ticket at the bar. Our waitress did give us free dessert (the bread pudding was amazing!) for the troubles, but it took us 3 hours from the time we sat to the time we paid because of how long we had to wait for the various mistakes to be remedied. At the end, when we got our check, our waitress told us she couldn't split our checks individually and we were already there past closing time, so we just put it on one card so we could just leave already. The food and atmosphere were great, but the service left a lot to be desired. It will be awhile before I return."}
{"text":"What a great place -- I can't imagine anyone leaving The Henry disappointed. Everything from the eclectic but spacious ambiance to the inventive dishes -- The Henry is the perfect choice for a quintessential weekend brunch. 

We visited Phoenix from New York and The Henry was our first stop from the airport. Although it was only 10a, since we had been awake for 9 hours, we settled on some of the more lunchtime options: the Short Rib Potstickers, the Roasted Turkey French Dip, and the Brussel Sprouts Caesar Salad with Salmon. 

All dishes were fantastic but the salad was truly original. Chopped brussel sprouts with four different types of lettuce in a perfect Caesar dressing. Every bite had such a beautiful blend of flavor and texture -- it was really amazing. 

I also had a gourmet Bloody Mary, with infused vodka of your choice, bacon, olives, and the freshest herbs you could ask for (they were picked right from the plant!) made table side by a very kind Bloody Mary expert. 

Finally, our server (a very sweet young lady) was very kind and accommodating. Great service all around. 

Hands down, I would recommend The Henry to visitors and locals alike."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Good clientele, decent selection of wines and liquor. Food quality was very impressive, only giving 4 stars because had to remind server multiple times for drinks."}
{"text":"It took forever to get a table and I witnessed a couple of parties leaving.  The server was attentive the entire time but the food was slow coming out.  Although it was slow coming out, it was quality food although the portion size was somewhat small considering the price."}
{"text":"ATTN: GLUTEN FREE PEOPLE:

My husband and I pretty much only stay at the cosmopolitan because we like it so much, and an added bonus has always been that we can eat at the henry. we've been there maybe 5 times total, and it's great because they have a gluten free menu. Tonight, the place was completely ruined for us and we will never go back. My husband has a very serious gluten allergy. It's really hard for him to find places he can eat at while we're in Vegas. We went to the henry last night, and everything was great, like usual. Tonight when we went, he ordered the potato skins like he usually does, specifying gluten free, and the server comes back and says \"the potato skins are fried in oil that other items are fried in and may not be gluten free\" This made no sense to us because he always orders these and there's never a problem. For his entree he orders the gluten free chicken salad sandwich. When the sandwich came out my husband picked it up to take a bite, and noticed there was cole slaw on it. There's no coleslaw on the chicken salad sandwich. the server had ordered him the fried chicken sandwich....but on gluten free bread. That makes no sense. He then tried telling us they made my husband a special gluten free fried chicken sandwich. THAT DOESNT EVEN EXIST!!! he was lying through his teeth. we called over the manager and he was an even bigger waste of time. he tried justifying it saying it was on GF bread. He also suggested my husband make a report to security because of his \"gluten problem\" WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN. this restaurant has been ruined for us and if you're gluten free, be extremely careful about eating here. The staff is obviously not knowledgeable enough on what is and isn't gluten free.....even though they have a gluten free menu (makes sense huh)."}
{"text":"The Henry is located to the right, just as you walk through the Northern, Bellagio-side doors of the Cosmopolitan (please click \"useful\" below for the previous statement alone!)

A curiously small place in the heart of foot traffic, one has to wonder if Cosmo intends this breakfast specialty-house to be its \"cafe.\"  You see, nothing is traditional in the Cosmo, thus there's no restaurant labeled casino cafe or steakhouse.  And that's just how it's clientele like it(?)  I just don't know; because while it seems dudes who wear moustache wax and gals whose parents played electro dance music to them in their cribs are the people who come here - I genuinely believe people don't like ambiguity.

So if The Henry is your casino cafe, I recommend going with the staples: eggs, bacon, and the like.  If you just have to have something like crab cakes for breakfast, be my guest, but know that something can go wrong.  I had the breakfast burrito everyone talk about, good, but you'll need to put something on it.  Eggs benedict was the real winner.

I'm looking forward to going back for dinner.  If this place is really 3 stars, I'll give it 4 for attentive service."}
{"text":"Best and beautiful latte.  Ask Kyle to make yours!  Beautiful designs.  Love all of their breakfast foods!"}
{"text":"happy hour is happy awesome
server super 
warm feeling 
our new fav spot
Caesar salad with asparagus
Korean tacos"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place.  Been here twice since I'm staying at the Cosmopolitan, makes for convince.  Nothing spectacular about the food but I like how they made my chicken salad blacken when I asked.  Came out pretty good.  Second time I came here, I ordered the french dip sandwitch and it was just okay.  Nothing really special about it."}
{"text":"Had a less than perfect experience.  Indicated so in a YELP and the manager responded quickly.  Will definitely return for another visit.  Good management!"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with this restaurant, not only the food and ambiance, but the service as well. It was nice to find a place that had more of a European feel. I highly recommend this restaurant!!  Our server, Ruben, did an amazing job making the environment feel welcoming and his knowledge and descriptions of the food were really helpful!!"}
{"text":"This is a very comfortable restaurant. The food is very good. We had the kale artichoke dip with lavosh and pita. The dip is very flavorful. It is a bit salty but it goes well with the beverages. The prime New York strip was perfect and the combo of scalloped potatoes and steak sauce were magnificent. I had the Korean skirt steak. Perfect for me but it could be s bit spicy for other people. The braised short ribs were melt in your mouth, warm your heart comfort food. We brought our family. Our 7 year old wanted \"meat\" and the chef graciously made a spiceless skirt steak and French fries, which he literally gobbled. The  server was great.  He was knowledgeable and thoughtful and very attentive. Fox restaurants always deliver 5 star quality."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding.  Staff were friendly and attentive. The food was delicious, but a little pricey for breakfast.  I guess that's the norm for these mega-hotels though."}
{"text":"From the very start this place looked amazing. But in this case, looks were not deceiving. The coffee and bakery options were great and tasteful. The interior layout, eclectic style, and furniture selection were not only comfortable but stylish. The service was outstanding and on point. But best of all, if this was my last meal... I would be more than satisfied."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Very cute comfortable setting. We had ahi tuna salad and house a salad with house homemade buttermilk dressing. Hand cut fries get an A. Had the house made fruit lemonade with Grey Goose. Excellent flavor and muddled fruit throughout. Would like to visit again for something else on the menu."}
{"text":"These guys serve a really good meal every time. They always have a surprise twist in their flavor that has me wondering what each dish will taste like. I come to Las Vegas twice a year and The Henry always delivers a great meal for a reasonable (for Las Vegas) price. I love their breakfasts.

Update: I just had their Chicken Fries Steak on my last day in Vegas. Soooo gooooood."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast and it was so good! The portions were large and great flavor. The breakfast burrito was incredible and even the salsa was flavorful and spicy. The oatmeal is good too. The illy americanos were rich and delicious as well. Service was fantastic"}
{"text":"the henry breakfast is gross over price great services 3 eggs more like 6 eggs NASTY went here on a Sunday wish I went somewhere else most part they didn't make us pay for the nasty food"}
{"text":"Sam Fox is normally renowned for such great restaurants.  That's why this one was such a surprise.  We made reservations for a party of seven and asked for a specific table.  When we arrived, the table we asked for was not available.  I've been in the restaurant business for many years now and I understand that restaurants cannot always guarantee specific tables.  That's fine.  However, they crammed us like sardines into a booth.  The place is incredibly noisy so, even though we were incredibly close, we couldn't really hear each other.
Now, I like to study and peruse the menu, so, as a courtesy to my fellow diners, I do it ahead of time on the restaurant's website.  We were eating at 1pm on a Saturday so, stupidly, I decided to check out the lunch menu.  When we arrived, we were only allowed to order off the breakfast menu.  At one o'clock.  On a Saturday!  Now, every restaurant I've worked at, from low end to high end has been able to accommodate any menu request at any time.  It's just basic customer service.
So, disgusted, we began to peruse the breakfast menu.  About 25 minutes into our meal, we FINALLY received glasses of water on the table.  And little did we know that we should have cherished the water as it was the last we'd see.
The food was decent - not great but not bad.  However, the whole meal was horribly marred by the substandard customer service.  There are so many great restaurants in this area that I find no reason to ever return to this one."}
{"text":"Had the burger.  They grind their beef each day!  Added fresh jalapeños.  Absolutely delicious!  Excellent service!"}
{"text":"I went there to have lunch with friends. I sat outside and it was beautiful! The waiter was super courteous, even when we couldn't decide what kind of pulp drink to get. Try the citrus pulp drink btw! I got quinoa and chicken tacos which were super filling and tasty. Overall, it was beautiful, everyone was smiling and welcoming. The bartender, Tanner was nice too! I will be going back, again and again."}
{"text":"Our spontaneous dinner at The Henry ended up being one of the highlights of our most recent trip to Vegas. I still think about that meal. Started with chicken (?) and veggie stuffed lettuce cups that sound simple enough but were surprisingly delicious. The main course was the best scallops I've ever had, served on a bed of corn. By the time dessert came I was so stuffed I couldn't finish it- which was painful because it was chocolate creme brûlée and it was amazing. Five stars for this unexpected dining experience. Will definitely go back and see if it holds up to my memory."}
{"text":"Amazing hamburger!!! And of course amazing cosmopolitans!!! My boyfriend had the ribeye and a French onion soup--- it's as so delicious! And the service was friendly --- it was all in all a place I will definitely come back too!!!"}
{"text":"When in town, I love coming here for their breakfast/brunch.  Some people come to Vegas and look for $6.99 steak & eggs, but for some reason I'm always drawn to The Henry's steak & eggs.  Although it comes with a larger price tag (~$32), the 14 oz ribeye steak is legit!  The steak was very juicy prepared at medium-rare.  It also comes with made to order eggs, breakfast potatoes, and 4 slices of toast.

I also had a side order of corned beef hash ($7).  This was an averaged sized portion, and nothing too special about it.  I'd stick with the steak & eggs.

Combined with a friendly staff, I always seem to come back here and I recommend for late late night dining or mid morning brunch."}
{"text":"We went in to celebrate my daughters 21st birthday.  We were a party of 11, and even with our large group the service was friendly and fun.
Food was great- the short ribs were a huge hit. 
They made the night special!"}
{"text":"Rarely does this happen...but we loved everything! We shared the spare rib pot stickers, the Brussel sprout Caesar, the kale dip, and each had the skirt steak with fried rice. Seriously everything was incredible. Delicious old fashioneds too...and I ended my meal with a whiskey and cream beverage! Beautiful space, super good service, absolutely incredible food. Well come here again next Time in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"one of the best tasting burgers i've had. great atmosphere for meetings or catching up over brunch"}
{"text":"Friendly service. Great for quick but nicer breakfast or lunch at The Cosmopolitan hotel.

Food is mostly average to above average. Location and staff good. This is my second visit.

Expensive; like most things at this hotel."}
{"text":"Truly exceptional comfort-food breakfast at a fair price for the neighborhood. Best coffee-shop coffee I've had in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Won't be back. While I love many other Fox concepts restaurants, I wanted to love The Henry. I was excited to try it but was very disappointed in the food and the service. The ambience is lovely. I had chicken and my boyfriend had salmon. Both were dry and lacking. Regardless, we were still going to tip 20% to our waitress even though she only checked on us once and our water glasses sat empty. We paid cash and when we got the change back, the waitress gave us our same 20$ bill back so that we didn't have change to tip the $17 20% tip. Ridiculous. We will stick to True Food Kitchen and Dough Bird."}
{"text":"The Cosmopolitan hotel houses some of my absolute favorite restaurants, one being The Henry. I checked this place out for breakfast once and tried the short rib benedict and Belgian waffle.

The short rib benedict is a little mountain of goodness, composed of two soft poached eggs, garnished with chives, balanced on two pieces of braised short rib meat sitting on two delicately cooked hash brown patties-- masterpiece of layers of deliciousness, all sitting in a puddle of what tastes a bit like... BBQ sauce. Like, why...? To me, a sauce like BBQ sauce is for covering something that lacks flavor of its own.  Next time I'll ask them to hold on the puddle. I can tell the hash browns are top notch, so I'm looking forward to trying them in their purest form!

The Belgian waffle was wonderful. Will definitely be ordering that again! The whipped cream really added to it, too."}
{"text":"The ONLY reason this isn't 1 star is because of my waiter. I am a regular here and have to say I don't know that I will be back. I came here on a Sunday without a reservation, which is something I never do.  I was told that I would have a table in 20 minutes as I was the only person in my party. 45 minutes later I asked the hostess if she knew how much longer and she sat me outside where people wait for takeout at a table that was a wet. When I asked if I could sit at a drier table, she told me that I am lucky I was sitting at all and put down some napkins. When I asked if I could order takeout, she answered no and walked away. 20 extra minutes went by and just as I was about to walk out, a waiter asked if I had already received my food. When I told him no and that I was waiting for someone to take my drink order, he immediately sat me at a STILL EMPTY dry table, rushed my food, and comped it. I tipped him the entire amount of what my bill would be. Fox has so many amazing restaurants, maybe they could teach their college age hostesses to be a little kinder to all customers so they don't scare regulars away."}
{"text":"This restaurant officially opens next week. I had a pre-opening reservation for tonight, but when I called to confirm, my booking was not there. The girl on the phone was rude and obviously thought that I was lying and trying to get a free meal. A word of warning to you all, make sure you have the name of the person you make your reservation with! I hope their food is better than their customer service!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times so far and each time I've really enjoyed it.  I've been to brunch twice and ordered the carrot pancakes (yum!) and another time I had the eggs with kale. Both dishes were outstanding. Another time, for lunch,  I ordered the quinoa tacos and cleaned my plate!  The staff is wonderful and service impeccable. I have the decor of the restaurant as well.  It always seems to be crowded when I go there. I recommend this place and look forward to returning to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"Warning - Don't eat here at 2:00 AM.  Food was bad, service was bad, and since it is an open space to the casino, everyone was drunk."}
{"text":"We went for dinner, and had made reservations. The ambiance and decor are very appealing, and seating very comfortable. The server and other staff were pleasant and knowledgeable. Cocktails: Boulevardier, Texas Paloma, and Manhattan were delicious and well done. The White Truffle Parmesan Fries were crispy (as they should be) and perfectly topped- not too much, not too little. We split the Roasted Brussles Sprout Caesar salad and enjoyed every bite. The Korean Style Skirt Steak was amazing. I can't wait to have it again. The Roasted Chicken was juicy, and delicious along with the spectacular cauliflower Polenta. The only problem is deciding whether to try the brunch or come back for the Korean Style Skirt Steak."}
{"text":"The Henry was amazing!  You must start with the duck confit flatbread!  The Ginger beer is amazing.  The kale salad, the porkchop - it's all pretty amazing in a chill atmosphere."}
{"text":"deserving of the 4-star rating on Yelp. quality food, hipster scene, parking sucks but is not impossible. 

have passed by The Henry many times and finally got a chance to go. definitely one of the hot spots for the Phoenix in-crowd. service was very pleasant. this looks like the Fox flagship restaurant, because it looks like the corporate office is right next door. i am normally NOT a fan of the Fox design/service/menu, with the exception of True Food, which is consistently solid. but The Henry clearly is given a lot of attention in all aspects (ingredients, presentation, service)...my guess is this meticulousness is because the big bosses are right next door.

you might have to circle of few times before you find a parking spot...but they DO open up, so that makes it tolerable.

not a bad spot."}
{"text":"Excellent food - fiance and I went for breakfast. We had the smoked salmon avocado toast and brioche French toast  However, we waited aboit 45 minutes for our food which is why we gave it 4 stars.  We'd still visit again, jjsdt for the avocado toast!"}
{"text":"the late night breakfast was very good.  We all could not stop moaning with pleasure over the potato cakes."}
{"text":"I always love the coffee and atmosphere here! I got hooked on The Cleo, a latte with espresso, almond milk, and hazelnut. I've always gotten it got because I love hot drinks, but they do offer it cold as well. It is so delicious. It is he perfect balance of espresso taste and sweet hazelnut. I love it, and I'm sure I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here with my friends this morning and was disappointed. The place looks great but the service is lacking - very inattentive. We waited a long time for our server. Once we ordered, she seemed to disappear. Our coffee and water were empty for long periods. Empty plates sat for a long time. The food took a very long time to come out (30+ minutes). I was not impressed with the food - I've had better at other places."}
{"text":"VIVA LAS VEGAS! For a weekend I headed over to the city that never sleeps. Amongst the relaxing, sun tanning, gambling, celeb-seeing, shopping, and partying, I made sure I left some time for my favourite hobby of all time -eating!


For the duration of the trip, we stayed at The Cosmopolitan Hotel  that just opened last new year's eve, making it the newest hotel on the Las Vegas Strip! If this was a hotels review blog, I would tell you that The Cosmo is probably the trendiest, most glamorous modern hotel I've been to, and how I can never stay at another hotel in Las Vegas again. But I'll save that for another yelp post.

The Henry is located inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel on the main floor right next to the Chandelier Bar (fun fact of the day, the chandelier hanging over the chandelier bar is actually the largest chandelier in North America!). It has a pink and mahogany theme to it, and was comfortable yet classy with its comfy padded seats and chic decor. 

The type of food they serve here are mainly classics like burgers, fish and chips, and pot pies. Since this was Vegas, I decided to go all out and order lobster for brunch. It was in sandwich form, but I guess its the thought that counts!

\"Maine Lobster Cub\" ($19)- Bacon avacado, citrus aioli, with your choice of fries, truffle tater tots or fresh fruit

The club was very good. It had chunky pieces of lobster tossed in a light mayo with a hint of lemon and parsley. In combination with the tomato and avacado, this sandwich was very refreshing...perfect for the Vegas weather! Even something so simple as a side of tater tots were delicious. They were deep fried so crispy and hot, and sprinkled with seasoned salt and truffles.  I don't know if I can go back to regular tots now. 

\"The Henry\" ($16) - three eggs, slab bacon, smoked ham, apple sausage, taylor ham or country link sausage with Henry's breakfast potato 

Most other people ordered regular brunch food. They serve all day breakfast here, and there is a Henry's special that is a pretty hefty plate of breakfast items. It doesn't look that big in the picture, but I for one would definitely not be able to finish this as the first meal of the day.

\"Chicken Pot Pie\" ($17) - slow roasted chicken, braised vegetables & pan gravy

Rob ordered the chicken pot pie, and it was a ridiculously large portion, even for a guy. It was served in a huge bowl filled with a hearty chicken stew, baked with a crunchy pastry layer on top. When I think of chicken pot pie, I think of a salty corn starch concotion with either fist size or non-existent pieces of chicken, green peas, and a pastry that becomes soggy on the bottom by the end of the meal. At The Henry, the chicken pieces were reasonably sized and wasn't the least bit dry. The stew had lots of other vegetables like potato, mushroom and carrots, and wasn't too salty. Tasty and filling! 

Really enjoyed this meal, definitely recommend this as a breakfast/brunch place. Make sure you come hungry though!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but i had an awful first experience, and that's enough to turn me off.  Yep, i had the dreaded, HAIR IN MY SOUP!  Then the staff looked at me like it was my fault.  WTF, take it away and comp it.  Don't you dare try to not take full responsibility.  It can happen, i understand, but it's your job to make it right."}
{"text":"I have wanted to  visit The Henry ever since it opened.  My wife and I are big breakfast fans and travel all over the valley in search of great breakfast places.  The November issue of the Phoenix Magazine featured the breakfast at The Henry in Phoenix, a Sam Fox Restaurant.  What enticed us to go on this Sunday morning was their description of a great French Toast dish with a photograph of a plate of nice thick bread, slices of apple, oozing with a Carmel sauce.  Both my wife and I ordered that dish.  Pictures can be oh so ever deceiving.  (You know FRENCH TOAST is bread drenched in an egg batter, etc. etc.)  Our dish did not resemble the promo photo at all.  We received 4 pieces of sliced white bread, halved and toasted.  To give the toast a well done look they were prepared on a flat grill and pressed down, most likely with a spatula, which burned the exterior of the bread and which was now about 1/4 inch thick.  There was no egg batter, it was TOAST.  There was 7 small slices of apple along with the 8 pieces of toast.  This was accompanied by a thimble full of maple syrup.  THATS IT.  Man oh man!  We were so hungry that we ate the dish, saving one piece each to show the manager that under normal conditions the toast was burned and uneatable.  She told us that she would convey our complaint to the chef.  I would hope so.  If this is indicative of the type of dishes served as a breakfast meal, we will never return.  On the side, I love to cook and know first hand when something is good and when it is bad.  This was a BAD dish.  Further, I have paid much more than the $10 cost of this dish and would never complain about the price, but I could reproduce the same dish for about .15 cents, no more than .20 cents.  I had high hopes for The Henry (The place is neat and comfortable and the service was spot on) but the preparation of our meal has turned us off."}
{"text":"This place hits the spot every time! The food is delicious, the environment is awesome  and service are on par with other Fox Concept restaurants."}
{"text":"The service is very fast. The restaurant looks cool and unique. The food was ok. The prices are decent  - good place for lunch (sandwiches, soups)"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere but ssslllooooowwww service!! After one hour thirty minutes of being sat at the table with no food out, we talked to the manager. She apologized and helped out allot, she was really really nice!!!!the manager def saved the experience! The popovers were different but still enjoyable...wouldn't order them again though. Chicken fried chicken was pretty good. I would make a reservation if coming, it's a busy restaurant."}
{"text":"It was just okay. Had to sit on the patio because it was so busy. Sorry but the patio completely lacks any personality. Staff was very nice. Service was good but food was average at best."}
{"text":"Place looks great but sevice and food is AWFUL!

I GOT FOOD POISIONING HERE from the Loaded Totor Tot Nachos....avoid at all costs. I have been puking all day any trying to get better. It was not the drinks last night either as I had two beers the entire night taking it easy.

The service was awful as well as we had to ask where our server was twice since he was no where to be seen."}
{"text":"We loved the Henry! It seems like this place is always crowded so make a reservation ahead of time! The portions are perfect so that you're full but not stuffed. Everything was cooked perfectly with a great mix of flavors."}
{"text":"Great service   Pro tip, when ordering a drink, ask for it \"on the rocks\".  It costs a bit more but u get 2oz of liquor in your drink. Much cheaper than \"ordering a double\". Not sure why but that's just how it is in Vegas. Had the Cobb salad and it was a generous portion."}
{"text":"I just had the Henry breakfast and it was perfect! The hash brown was amazing. I don't usually eat a lot of hash but the entire breakfast was awesome! I love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"We went to The Henry for a very late dinner as our flight didn't get in until 9pm. It is right next to the door to the Strip so it made for some good people watching, but there was also a draft coming in from outside. The Henry is also right next to one of the Cosmopolitan's bars so we also got to watch their models and window box dancers which was nice. It's pretty loud, so don't expect to have a lot of conversation with your party unless you're ok with using 'Outside Voices'. There are a bunch of tvs so you can also watch a game if you want.
I ordered the Croque Monsieur which was very tasty and much bigger than I thought it would be. The Boy got a Tuscan Salad with Chicken which he devoured. I also got their 63rd Chromosone drink which was very good. Our bill was $55 which I thought was reasonable for a drink and two entrees. The service was quick and Marco was attentive. I would definitely stop again for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"A taste of heaven
Chef must cook with love
If dining after hours take a snack. You'll be waiting a while

I have been here after hours and the food is incredible

I gave it a 4 star because they are always short on staff and I have had to wait 10min for waiter to take my order and another 40 min for my meal to be served


There have been times when there's drunk people dining and being obnoxiously loud and staff did nothing about it"}
{"text":"Went to The Henry for the first time last night with my family to celebrate  my daughters  50th birthday.  Jenna was our server and she was terrific,  she answered  all our questions  and provided great service.  By the way the food was awesome too.looking forward to returning  to The Henry again"}
{"text":"I came here tonight to celebrate a good friends birthday. We were seated promptly (but I think she had called in advance to reserve a table). Once seated it took awhile to get water or start our orders. 
The food here was tasty! I ordered the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich, which came with fries, and upgraded to truffle fries. The fries were delicious! Note that although on the menu it states that the sandwich comes with havarti it ALSO comes with american cheese. I returned my sandwich upon arrival because I don't really care for american cheese ( the manager had told me after my switch that the menu does NOT list all the items that may be included on the entree....too bad) This wasn't a major event, however because I needed a new entree, most of the rest of the table was completely finished with their meals and waiting to order dessert. When the new sandwich came out, they included the kale apple salad and that was very light and refreshing. 
To drink I had the chai lime ginger beer and that was amazing! It tasted like Christmas in a cup-- you must try it!
For dessert I had a few bites of the croissant bread pudding. It had rum (or whiskey?) soaked raisins and caramel ice cream--very very delicious and decadent. 
Our server was very pleasant and friendly. The manager was nice, but I wasn't too thrilled that when I had pointed out that the menu just lists havarti and not american cheese, she checked to menu to see if I was right.
It's VERY loud here, I had read that in other reviews, but they aren't kidding! Be sure you don't really want to \"catch up\" with someone if meeting them here!"}
{"text":"You won't find many poor reviews as their cuisine is heavenly, and this review does not dispute that finding. On Valentine's Day at breakfast around 9:15 we waited 25 minutes for a table and waited another 15 minutes while one coffee was served but not the other. No milk for another 10 minutes. Then napkins came out after another 5 minutes. You're getting the point. The logistics are amateur hour, which belies the absolutely fabulous creations from their kitchen."}
{"text":"Short Rib Benedict is very delicious and the service was excellent. Our server was so helpful when we ordered"}
{"text":"I came to the Henry for the first time last weekend on my birthday. We showed up without a reservation and there was an hour wait but we were able to be seated right away at a community table even though there was four of us. We ordered a bottle of champagne and one of my friends ordered a bloody Mary from the bloody Mary cart which was freaking awesome. The bloody Mary cart had six different infused vodka is to choose from and a bunch of garnishes. The guy making the bloody Mary was really cool and even went and got fresh bacon for my friend. My friend and I shared the caramel apple French toast and the avocado toast. Both were absolutely amazing. I also got a free dessert for my birthday, a peanut butter molten cake that was brought out with a candle. I will definitely be back again for brunch!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Sarah was amazing and her knowledge of food topped off the experience. The Henry is located inside of The Cosmopolitan. Little on the pricey side but the quality of food makes it well worth it. Made from scratch breakfast on the strip."}
{"text":"Yep. Ham butter. HAM BUTTER. Are you serious? Ham butter! This p,ace is beautifully decorated, nicely appointed and the food rocks. Our server was attentive, accommodating and quick. Excellent cold-brewed Americano and grapefruit mimosa. Easy parking. Deliiiiicious. We will definitely be back- order the popovers. They will not make you sad."}
{"text":"We had a pleasant experience here. The ambiance and decor are all very nice.

Our server was friendly, and the food came out quickly. There were plenty of different menu items.

We ordered the kale and garlic dip, which was very good! For dinner, we had the burger and the veggie pasta. Both were good. We probably won't be rushing back here, but it was definitely worth a try. And I'm sure we will return again in the future!"}
{"text":"A solid establishment

I have to say the best customer service in the last decade of dining out, along with high-level food and good ambience."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant & beautifully decorated. I am not a big fan of open kitchen restaurants because I always end up smelling like food as I leave. The menu was more limited than what I was expecting but the food was good. More of a trendy place to go with friends rather than a food destination."}
{"text":"Amazing!  We went on a Monday for lunch without a reservation.  We decided not to wait 30 minutes for a table and placed our order at the bar.  

Orange hibiscus soda - light, tangy, and refreshing.  

Brie toast - great! The pairing of the Brie, pears and pomegranate seeds was perfection.

Popovers - light, fluffy, crispy. I preferred the herb butter (to the ham butter)

Chicken (main dish) with brussel sprouts and macaroni & cheese - the chicken was crispy, and a little dry.  The sides made up for it. The brussel sprouts were amazing. I might try to order several side orders the next trip. The Mac & cheese was deliciously creamy. 

I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Needed a reasonable dinner for 4 before a show that was in the neighborhood between Bellaggio and New York, New York. The Henry at the Cosmopolitan had a diverse yet interesting menu, so we elected to meet there for dinner.

Salads were delicious. Plate on which the Tuscan Kale salad was served was awkwardly shaped and as a result, much Kale Salad ended up on the tablecloth but otherwise was excellent. Salmon nicoise salad was also fantastic.

Highlight was dirty martini with blue-cheese stuffed olives. Great prices, good service, fun location for being right in the action of the casino. Would definitely return for dinner before adjourning to the Bond or the Chandelier bar in the Cosmopolitan."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch for our friends bachelorette weekend. We had a great private room which was perfect for our big group! The service was good and prompt. The tableside Bloody Mary service was super fun for our group! We all enjoyed our food and drinks too."}
{"text":"Cheers to another awesome Fox Restaurant concept. Upon my first step into the big blue building I immediately fell in love. 

The atmosphere is perfect with a mix of tasteful urban, east coast, and early 1900 era decor. It's very open and inviting on the inside with endless visuals that hold your attention.

I could see my self here in the mornings for my ritual intake of caffeine, lunch, or with friends getting lubricated for a night out on the weekend. 

I had the arrogant butcher coffee, a nice drip coffee infused with espresso and dark chocolate, delightful. 

The avocado bread simple and tasty, followed by the French dip which I found delicious.

Welcome to the neighborhood Henry, I'm all in!"}
{"text":"The Henry is a super cute place. I walked in and everyone was very nice. I came with a friend and the hostess informed me that it's going to be a about a 1.5 hour wait, but she gave us the option of eating outside in which we decided to do so. Our waitress came and was nice. She took our order and the food was out promptly. 

As we were eating, small little bugs kept coming on the table. I get it, it's the middle of summer in Arizona. I tried to ignore or shoo them away, but then they all started coming on my plate and I immediately lost my appetite. For a place like The Henry, you would expect them to have a good exterminator to not have a bug issue. 

The waitress came back and I kindly asked her if there is some sort of discount for having bugs all up in my plate. She gave me the, \"Are you F'ing kidding me look?\" We both looked at my plate and you could clearly see movement that was not from the food. She grabbed my plate in a very rude way and practically ran away. She came back with the check without an apology, dropped it off, quickly said that she took 50% off, and ran away if not quicker than the first time. My friend and I put the credit card down, and once again she was suddenly running a marathon. She didn't make eye contact and was clearly trying to avoid us at all costs. She was just rude in general all because I asked her about a discount on something you would think they would be understanding of. Even if she said I'm sorry we can't do anything about it, I would've understood because like I said, we're in Arizona. We still tipped her even though she didn't deserve it.  

I just feel like this situation could've been handled differently. It's a very nice place, but she definitely ruined the good time my friend and I were having."}
{"text":"Oh.My.Word. 

This place is amazing!  loved the atmosphere and the vibe. I visited with friends on a business trip and we had a simply amazing experience.

Shane was our waiter...he was the bomb! So nice and paid so much attention to us!

Our food was SO fresh and everything has an amazing flavor to it. The wine selection was perfect for our food and paired nicely with all our entrees. 

We ordered the Peaches and Cream for dessert, and if you read this, go, and don't order it you should be ashamed. AMAZING.

I literally cannot wait to go back and eat her again!"}
{"text":"Breakfast was fantastic! Eggs were light and fluffy. Our server Ray was outstanding and friendly. 
If you want a enjoyable dining experience then \"The Henry\" is the place to go!"}
{"text":"The salon of \"The Greatest Neighborhood Restaurant\" exhibits an inventory of classics. Above a Davy's Gray and Carolina Blue patterned settee hang five frames of abstract art evocative of Damien Hirst \"spot paintings.\" Metal Tolix chairs border a polished wood table aglow under the lights of burnished antique two-arm table lamps. An emerald velvet booth extends to an entryway, which reveals an Arcadian terrace that offers a generous cue of shade. This American brasserie, dubbed The Henry, exemplifies a Roaring (Twenties) sophistication.

A remarkable accomplishment is discovered in the duality of the culinary cues at The Henry. Where classical dinners are supplied in the evening, contemporary breakfasts are enjoyed in the noontime. In his book, American Food: The Gastronomic Story, Evan Jones, the late food writer famed for his efforts to bring the winning accents of American cuisine to the fore, references this mealtime character called brunch. He traces its culinary heritage to 1930s' America. This dynamic that sees a harmony amid design and cuisine at The Henry is one that advances the restaurant as a space of fulfillment and gathering for family and friends."}
{"text":"We ate at The Henry twice during our stay at the Cosmopolitan. The first was for breakfast. The first time was on a Sunday morning and there was a 30 minute wait. I had the pancakes which were delicious and my mom and aunt both had the Henry breakfast. Everything was delicious, no complaints. The second time we decided to go there around 11 pm for dessert. My mom ordered the apple pie, my aunt the cheesecake, and me a chocolate fudge cake. They were all delicious, however the wait was extremely long and the server a little inattentive.  Overall, food was delicious both times. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"I want to expand my horizons beyond the breakfast burrito. I really do. But I can't do it, it's just too good. So much pepper jack cheese, but there's quinoa, so it's totally healthy. I think I lose weight when I eat it. 

Also awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"After seeing the long line at Eggslut, we opted to come here for our last meal in Vegas.  My husband ordered a breakfast burrito and a milk.  I ordered latte and the Henry breakfast (eggs, potatoes, meat and toast).  I explicitly asked for scrambled eggs, well done.

The cons:
-runny eggs that were crusty on the outside and complete mush on the inside, despite asking for well done eggs.  They were almost liquid.  Not edible.  Our server didn't even notice that they were left untouched on my plate.  In a hurry to catch a flight, we didn't have time to request, and then wait,  for replacements.  
- the service.  

The pros:
-my husband like his breakfast burrito.
-the latte was good.

Everything else was mediocre.  The pros were not enough to make the $60 breakfast worth it.  We will not be returning."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Fox Restaurant Concepts and The Henry was in line with my other favorite restaurants in this family.  We went early before a concert and it was busy at 5:30pm (in summer).  It appears that they attract a big happy hour crowd. The set-up is a little confusing if you've never been here but the staff was friendly and welcoming.  I loved the atmosphere and the food was yummy!  

I started with the strawberry rhubarb collins which was tasty and refreshing.  The popovers were good but a little bland.  I had the quinoa tacos and they were amazing.  The tacos are small but full of flavor and surprisingly filing.  I also tried my sister's chicken with creamed corn.  Love the creamed corn!  It's just like the corn at The Greene House.  It sounds weird to be so excited about corn but it's really that good!  

I frequent other Fox restaurants that are closer to me but I would certainly return to this one if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Ambience is top notch. Lots of energy every time I've been there for brunch. All the pretty people definitely go there. The food is always very good & creative. The Bloody Mary cart is something to behold. It's hard to go wrong with the brunch menu but the avocado toast... not so much. The masses of wi-if sucking dudes on their laptop is a little unseemly but hey, that's the kind of joint it is on the coffee bar side. The staff is always great. 

The only downfall is it's pricey and loud. It's hard to hear people at your own table. And no, that's not a cool thing Sam."}
{"text":"We had the worst and most embarrassing experience.  I came in at 4pm Friday Jan 20th for a business meeting and asked for a table. The hostess asked to clarify what I planned to order and insisted that the dining area was full service. I explained that I wasn't quite sure (only 2 of roughly 30 tables was occupied) I was hopeful to be seated. She explained that they anticipated a busy night and again demanded to know if I would be ordering \"full service.\" I again asked if I could please be seated. Unfortunately I wasn't prepared for hostility from a \"hostess\" nor did I expect to provide a digest of what we had planned to order so I was stunned and unsure how to respond to her demands since I wasn't sure what my party planned to order. She refused to seat me. I asked to speak to the manager. The business person I was meeting had arrived and scanned their eyes across the fully empty restaurant and asked why I was sitting in a chair waiting and what was the problem. Having met this person for the first time my face was beet red and embarrassed; my answer was I was trying to get a table. They looked highly confused as their eyes scanned the empty establishment and I was overwhelmed with embarrassment. The hostess returned after 5 minutes (it felt like an hour) and said she could seat me (remember I asked for the manager and at 4pm the restaurant is 80% empty). I again inquired who the manager was and she pointed to a young gentleman 5 feet from me. He was clearly aware of the issue but clearly had no plans to respond until I approached HIM. When I approached him he seated us and explained he was confused why there was a problem and why the hostess even came to him since they were not serving full service, only appetizers. He also said she had been there a long time so he was shocked. He shouldered the blame to her and was unfazed. He was clearly not the least bit concerned about my experience. I on the other hand was off to a tremendously embarrassing meeting. I had no choice but to rebound so I could carry on with the meeting but I was left stunned, and still remain stunned. The hostess was incredibly rude; beyond belief. The manager was unconcerned and unfazed and offered nothing to sooth my shame and embarrassment; or improve or enhance the experience. I still can only scratch my head at this experience. It was off-putting to say the least. Highly apathetic, unprofessional, and disrespectful to customers; thats the summation of it. It was very hurtful to say the least; not to mention completely unnecessary. Sad."}
{"text":"Just got done eating here. Had the chicken sandwich for lunch with fries. Food is excellent. Great atmosphere. Had the desert which was good too.  Staff very friendly and service was excellent. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"We had a large group and they offered us their private kitchen free of charge.
Food was phenomenal.  Especially the ravioli, veg lasagna, branzino, almost everything.  Decor, ambience and staff couldn't have been better. 

Would def visit again if in the area."}
{"text":"My favorite entree is the Korean skirt steak. Yum! Also, the Henry also has some of the best coffee in town. The ambience and service is second to none! I just took some guests that were in town to the Henry, and they could not stop asking if they could go back. This is high praise from people who live in Beverly Hills.

This place is worth the wait, and I highly recommend that you try the Henry."}
{"text":"Had the French onion soup and it was delish.  The service was excellent!  Decor is different but cool."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing brunch! What I ordered:

+Mary Pickford (Sriracha Bloody Mary) = YES
+Crab cake benedict = YES
+Cinnamon roll French toast = YAAAAS

All of these above were so good! I even ordered the Bloody Mary and French toast twice. The Bloody Mary was delicious, not spicy, not too strong, but a perfect adult beverage pairing for any brunch entree. The French toast is a croissant French toast and it makes all the difference. Sure to satisfy any brunch snob's sweet tooth. 

Will be back.. And will try to order something else.. In addition to all of these :))"}
{"text":"After arriving late to Postinos for the Board and Bruschetta night, and facing a long wait, we decided to check The Henry out. It was pretty busy when we arrived, and told the wait was 30 min. After 40 min, hanging out in the nice coffee shop there, I went to the hostess to see about our table. They said it was ready, which I then wondered at what point they were going to tell us.
After sitting, we asked for water. They brought lukewarm water with no ice in pint glasses. Ok, maybe the ice ran out, they're busy. 
I was super hungry and decided to order the Diner Burger. However, when it arrived it didn't have grilled onions, as advertised. Just lettuce, tomatoes and a smattering of 1000 island dressing. Also, the patty was a well-done, ¼\" hockey puck. The fries however, were great, but came with only a half mini-cup of ketchup. Maybe they ran out along with the ice. 
So I got to experience, for the 1st time in my life, the experience of sending something back. I always thought they would spit in my food, like in the movie Casino, so I've never had the balls to try it. But hey, it probably would have been an improvement for the super dry, burnt burger. As a comparison, the Arizona Snowbowl cafeteria burger is better, but by a very slim margin.
A manager came over and said they were trying to improve their menu. I opinioned that an In'n'Out burger was similar to theirs, but four times as good.
After ordering instead the Gemelli and Black Truffle pasta, I was asked if I wanted any meat with it. Which probably was a warning sign since the dish included homemade bacon. When the dish arrived it was great, but only had 5 to 6 slivers of ham (and no bread!) Also, it was tiny. Plates of pasta are much bigger in Italy, and they aren't exactly supersizing everything. Also, most important I was promised BACON.
I gave this place 2 stars, because the wait staff was excellent, and they tried their best to make excuses for the food."}
{"text":"Bottom line:  everything was delicious.  Our fourth visit and consistently good restaurant.  This visit did present one small problem:  longer than usual wait for first course.  The wait staff was pleasant and attentive and apologized---there appeared to be a snafu in kitchen.  No matter, manager comped first course and when my husband complimented the steak, the chef comped dessert.  All in all, a very enjoyable night at a great savings.  Even without the wonderful service, I would return."}
{"text":"Bread pudding to go was not very good :(  The raisins were tough and chewy and far too many of them.(  More raisins than pudding)  Maybe I had high expectations due to reviews and radio interview, but still disappointed -service was very slow as well.  Nice atmosphere and decor though."}
{"text":"Food was amazing!! Went with, Group of six, every one of our meals was amazing. And thank god it was, because it was some of the worst  service I have ever received. Service was so slow, it took 40 minutes for our first drinks  to be received, it was an hour by the time our appetizers hit the table, which was the same time the other half of our drinks came to table. It was a chore to track down our server, when we asked someone else for help it happened to be manager... His level of concern was underwhelming and he offered to buy my drink, which he did... But on a 300 tab it was tough to notice, when all 6 of us received poor service. This place could easily be a 4 or 5 star rating, food no complaints, atmosphere awesome and what you expect with a fox concept, service needs extreme improvements."}
{"text":"Disappointing. I was so excited upon arrival. Looked so pretty from the outside and there is parking! Such a huge plus in that area. 

Sat at one of the comfy seating arrangements in the bar area. Big mistake. As the restaurant fills up, people waiting for tables start to crowd into this area as the hostess stand is located nearby. It started to  1) get claustrophobic and 2) we completely lost sight of our waitress so ordering more drinks, obtaining water, and getting our check all proved difficult. 

We ordered drinks and appetizers at the same time. Another mistake. Appetizers all came out 10 minutes before the drinks arrived. I can understand drinks before food but the reverse is just awkward. 

My suggestion would be to wait a few weeks and given them some time to work out the kinks. With their corporate offices upstairs, I would assume they can work out glitches soon."}
{"text":"NEVER EAT HERE. Just came here for one of my birthday dinners last night. Although the waitress was friendly, the service was insanely slow. To start we had the shrimp cocktail which was absolutely disgusting in all honesty. Something just tasted...off.I ordered the brussel sprouts Caesar salad topped with scallops. This was the worst salad I have ever had. It came with probably 3 whole brussel sprouts and the rest was wilted romaine. It was dry as if they didn't put enough dressing on. The scallops were also dry and VERY rubbery. I was hungry so I ate them though... big mistake. My dad and mom did not enjoy their bolognese either. They both reported that the garlic bread was extremely burnt and my dad said the dish lacked the truffle flavor. We were brought out a complimentary peanut butter chocolate molten lava cake which was nice. The cake was cold though and did not taste very good. It was probably the highlight of the meal though. Soon after leaving the restaurant I started to feel queasy in my stomach and extremely nauseous. I ended up taking a melatonin and going to bed in hopes of waking up feeling better. I woke up this morning still feeling ill and sick to my stomach. I ended up vomiting this morning. My dad vomited as well. My mom did not throw up, but she never took a bite of the shrimp or scallops. I'm thinking food poisoning. I will never be back to this establishment."}
{"text":"A little loud for conversation. Seth, our server, was friendly, available, and professional. 
Family of 6 adults out. We had the pork chop, rotisserie chicken, Korean skirt steak, and short ribs. All pleasing, savory food. Portions satisfying. They were out of the bread pudding desert . Will be back."}
{"text":"Came here late night as we couldn't find a decent place to just get a little something to eat. DH ordered the Reuben for $18 and I the $11 kale salad. Never mind that the \"techno music\" is sooooo loud that one can't have a decent conversation, but my DHs Reuben was as dry as the desert I'm in. After complaining the mgr decided to take the $11 salad off the bill BUT HE COMPLAINED about the $18 sandwich. This place is a hell hole"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant at the cosmopolitan. It's so easy to get too wherever I'm at on the on the strip. Just walk in. The menu is awesome. And the chef is very accommodating to my dairy allergies. Customer service is absolutely amazing.I truly recommend going there anytime breakfast lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"So I don't know how we got to our table because our host never said a word to us! LOL Then he turned out to be our serve and thank goodness he finally said something then. I started out with a Bloody Mary which was delicious and spicy but no olives or pepperoni like one of the other reviews said! I had the omelet which was OK and I say that because for the price I felt we should have been able to select whatever we wanted in our omelet and unfortunately for me my 3 items for $16 didn't hit the spot.  Their potatoes side dish was awesome though if you like garlic which I do! Honestly for what they served I would have liked Denny's much much much better. Oh and it came with toast and 3 different jams but it was this nasty hard wheat bread! Gross, but I'm sorry but when its late at night I just want some delicious soft white bread. However, considering where they are located (Cosmopolitan) their prices were pretty reasonable ( 2 omelets and a bloody Mary for about $60 not including tip). After all the places I have eaten in Vegas, this is my least favorite! The service was unfriendly and the food was sub par at best."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast and it was amazing!!!! Alex was our server and he was very good at his job. He was friendly and personable. He knew we were in a bit of a rush so he put our order in quick. It was perfection! Definitely recommend the California omelette if you go. Only downside was it was a little $$$ but worth it for the quality of food and service!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this place, it has a great vibe.  The customer service is excellent, which is common for Fox restaurants.  The food is always generous portions, fresh, inviting and creative, but not crazy!  The only reason i give it 4 stars is because I feel  it's a bit expensive!  Business lunch for 3 was over $50 with tip!  To try to take my family of 6 would easily be over $100 just for lunch!  Wish there were smaller portions for smaller $$$."}
{"text":"Quoted a 35-45 min wait and was seated after an hour and 14 mins. Had come for brunch for my daughters birthday with her friends but since the wait was so long they ended up ordering burgers instead of brunch. The Henry would NOT have been my choice for burgers and I was very disappointed. The food arrived 26 mins after ordering making it just before noon by the time we were eating (good thing they didn't order breakfast). To make it worse, one of the girls burgers had a hair in it and therefore she didn't even eat it. I had been to The Henry before and thought it was the perfect place to take my daughter and her friends but I was incredibly disappointed. I will never return to The Henry, nor would I recommend it."}
{"text":"This was a mixed bag of a meal. We ate dinner on a Sunday evening. Our server was very nice and helpful. I ordered the Parisian Chic cocktail, which was very good, but not that strong. The french onion soup was flavorful and the cheese was beautifully browned and crispy. My son had the breakfast burrito and was very happy with it; however it really needed a small side of some sort. Fruit would be good. The major downer was with the french dip sandwich. Both my husband and I ordered it. The bread was good, if boring. The horseradish sauce was creamy. But the meat was clearly MICROWAVED. That is a sin in my book. French dip is usually made from last night's prime rib sliced and warmed in boiling au jus. This was dry and tasted of microwave. We all know Vegas food is expensive, but for $18 I still expect the food to be cooked--not nuked. That aside, it was still a good meal and I would go there again and order something else."}
{"text":"This place is great!!  I got the western omelet and it's one of the best I've ever had. I substituted the ham for chicken sausage - it was STUFFED with so many veggies and thy don't skimp on the meat either. The hash browns are to die for and the omelet in itself was huge!"}
{"text":"Food consistenly good and a touch above other FRC outlets.  Korean skirt steak and quinoa tacos very good. Smoked salmon appt and artichoke dip were nothing special, however.  

Liked that the booths were well separated so that it wasn't that loud given how crowded it was. However, though we had reservation, weren't seated until an hour later. Quite the scene (like Olive + Ivy during the boom years?), I could have cast RHOS there. People in more expensive cars than you have no problem parking poorly in the narrow parking spaces, making the process of getting into your car after dinner Cirque-du-Soleil worthy.

Sam, please put in a valet.  These \"millionaries\" can't park!"}
{"text":"It's all about consistency. 

In Scottsdale for a conference. Came here one night and had such a great experience that I booked a group reservation for a few days later. If only that same level of care had been present the second night. 

My first visit:
Crowded. Popular. Patrons were all having a good time. Nice large dining space. I was impressed with the unique selection of specialty cocktails. The service was good. The guy was timely and not imposing. Attentive. Helpful. The food was deliciously impressive. Which is why I booked a group reservation for a few nights later. 

Second visit:
We were all late getting there. The hostess was nice about it even though the hostess was consistently kinda crabby. Which reminds me... The hostess stand is a serious problem in this place!  The hostess stand faces the interior to the restaurant - not the door. When you walk in, it's hard to know where to go or with whom to speak about getting a table and the hostesses act like they're doing you a favor. But I digress... 
So after we were seated and ordered our drinks, the server disappeared for about 30 minutes and never took our order. After we flagged down a different guy, our server returned finally with drinks. She took our order then and generally was just slow. After we all finished our entrees, once again our lovely server had disappeared. We might have ordered dessert had we not feared growing old and turning to dust before she decided to return. Our meals were good. Everyone was happy with that but the slow service wore us down. Basically, the server could have gotten us to order at least one more round of cocktails and a round of desserts had she been more on-the-ball. More food and drink & better service equals more business for The Henry and more tips for little Miss Amnesia. It's simple math."}
{"text":"I am somewhat conflicted on my feelings of The Henry. I've been there several times, and was pleased with most aspects. The lunch menu has some nice choices, and I was turned onto the Kale and Apple salad by one of the staff. Admittedly, I eat far too much crap, so adding the salad to my diet a few times a week is probably a good thing. Service for lunch was solid, no complaints.

Another time I sat on my lunch break and did some work on their WiFi, which was a bit slow, but hey, it's free. I ordered a coffee that was quite good, and the employee was more than happy to chat with me about some of the nicer cars in the parking lot. Good dude, and made good coffee. Definitely a fan of the coffee bar there.

The liquor menu is pretty diverse, and has some harder to find stuff on it, which is nice. They're lacking both Macallan and Highland Park though, which are must haves as far as I am concerned. I had a glass of the Yamazaki 18 there recently, which had nice flavor and complexity, but I'm definitely still a scotch guy. Nevertheless, the rise of Japanese whiskey is still relatively new, so it was cool to see it on the menu.

One thing that does bother me is that the higher ups appear to ride the employees pretty hard. My friends and I were getting lunch, and all noticed that the staff seemed to tense up when a manager would walk by. My server was killing it with our service, but I noticed he got pulled aside and chewed out for something. I've seen a few other people get grilled too. Granted, I don't work there or know what it's like for the managers, but the added tension when they're hovering around can be a bit uncomfortable. They've got a solid staff, let them do their thing.

I've generally been a fan of most of the Fox Concepts, but The Henry just seems like it's run too tight for my taste. The place has a ton of potential though.

Oh, and apparently breakfast ends at 10 and lunch doesn't start until 11, and in between neither menu is technically available to order from. You're essentially in food limbo for an hour. Who the hell though that was a good idea?"}
{"text":"I will give this restaurant 5 stars because I really did enjoy it. A bit on the pricey side, but it's trendy and more for yuppies. I had a fabulous burger and my cocktail with grapefruit was yummy. Can't quite remember the name of it. I do recommend this place. Oh yes and the Kale Garlic dip was very good."}
{"text":"I love this place! I went here with a few girlfriends and we sat on the patio next to the fireplace. It was happy hour and not too busy, the service was fast and very good. I recommend this place to anyone, if you are dining alone, having coffee with friends, or on a date! Its great for every occasion!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food here but the prices are way high. I ordered the corned beef hash with 2 over easy eggs & 2 slices of toast. That really shouldn't cost $17. They make a killing in profit every time someone like me orders it.

With that said, we're probably paying for the ambiance, which is pretty nice - modern & clean. Staff is great. If you're going for breakfast, make a reservation. Wait time can be long otherwise.

Hardest part was finding it in the hotel. On first level in the back past the chandelier bar."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! A bit pricey, but the great service makes up for it. I had the cinnamon roll french toast which was amazing. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I've eaten breakfast here four times, only because my friend thinks this the best place on the strip. Two times the food was average. And two times the food was not good at all. Denny's has better quality food and it's cheaper. My friend is going to be eating here alone from now on. Too many other great choices on the strip to pay a premium for below average food."}
{"text":"I had my birthday dinner here with my friends and boyfriend. We all loved it and had a great time. Second time, my boyfriend and I took my sister and her husband here (they're from out of town) the service was not good. Our waitress took a very long time for everything. I've been a waitress myself so I try not to say anything . But other than that everything was great. My sister loooooved the food!"}
{"text":"Not great. Appetizers are great.  Very boring entrees.  Not good either.  Desserts OK!!"}
{"text":"W O W!! This place was impressive from the moment we sat down! What a beautiful Spot! The ambiance is cozy and comfy yet classy! Jenna Our Server was the BEST we have had in a long time. She was genuine and sincere. I have been in the restaurant business for over twenty years and I know great service when I see it. She is on top of her game! She was VERY knowledgable about the business and the menu. She was able to answer all our questions and we had A Lot because it was our first visit. Coffee and sweet treats were a great start to a good breakfast! This will definitely be a new favorite spot. Can't want to bring my out of town guests here in the near future!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Had the kale & garlic dip, kale salad and the cod. All simply wonderful. Ask for Craig! He was super attentive and genuine! I will return!"}
{"text":"Came in with my family at 12:40 on a Sunday. It's 1:27 and still no food. I see five empty tables so it's not like it's super busy. Maybe super unorganized. The manager came and brought us some appetizers. That was nice but would have liked them 30 minutes ago not right before our food. They brought out food at 1:31. Overall it's kind of overrated. There are other really good places to eat on a Sunday afternoon."}
{"text":"I went with a group of girlfriends for brunch & we all loved it! Good food & atmosphere!  You can have a healthy meal if you choose, or a more comforting dish if you feel like it; the menu gives options."}
{"text":"Good HH ... drinks are great, bartenders are cool and the food is good too but more appetizer 
options might be a good idea."}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice place to have breakfast/lunch on a Sunday morning.  After walking by this restaurant the day before and seeing everyone waiting in line, we decided to give it a try the next day.  This was a big mistake.  While I expect to pay high prices in Vegas for food, I also expect to get better quality.  This restaurant certainly was lacking in quality.  I ordered the french dip with hush puppies.  The french dip was one of the worst I have ever had.  Bland, to say the least.  Arby's would have been a better choice.  My guest had a traditional breakfast, and also was not impressed.  Skip this place."}
{"text":"Had a nice dinner here with my wife last weekend and we were quite pleased.  We like to take our time when we were out so it was funny when the manager brought out our appetizer and said it was on the house due to the wait.  We hadn't even felt like there was a wait but hey who doesn't like free food.  At the end all of the food was terrific and we even shared two of the deserts which were just as good.  

We will be back."}
{"text":"California Club omelet. Simply Amazing. Perfect for after the club or brunch the next morning. Great smoothies too."}
{"text":"Great overall experience! I got the roasted chicken...AMAZING. So juicy and you have a variety of side options! If you go, ask for Sarah as your server! She is cute as a button and provides wonderful service. She engaged our whole table and was a delight to chat with. I will be coming back again soon:)"}
{"text":"Pretentious, over priced, and snooty. Since I live in Arcadia and have tried most resturants in the area, I thought to try this place. We were a party of 7 so I called ahead. I was advised that no reservations were necessary, however, when we arrived all heads turned. Perhaps b/c we were a diverse ethnic party? We were told the wait was 45 minutes, even though seating was available. We walked out...and won't be back."}
{"text":"While in Vegas this weekend, we found The Henry across the street from Planet Hollywood, where we were staying. The restaurant is busy, but the Staff and Breakfast were amazing. We went both days!! My daughter had the Belgian Waffle and I had The Henry Special day one and the Bagel and salmon the next. Yummy!"}
{"text":"This was our first visit to the Henry and we will definitely be back. Reservations recommended. We arrived at 8:45 for our 9pm reservation and it was still packed. The atmosphere is great though to sit and chat and have a cocktail, which we did. We had their \"figgy mule\" an it was delicious!

When we were seated the staff was courteous and we were greeted promptly by our server. He had a great personality and was super helpful with menu Recommendations. We started with the popovers with ham butter.  These were absolutely delicious. The only strange thing about this was when we got the bill. I'm assuming the order only comes with three popovers but we are a party if four so they charged extra for the single popover. Not a big deal but it would be nice if it was mentioned on the menu.

For out entrees I ordered the Gemmeli with Black Truffles and my husband ordered the Branzino. The Gemmeli was incredible!  The house made bacon delicious. My husbands Branzino though, not the greatest. Which was sad because it came highly recommended by the server an it was on the higher price point on the menu. The greens and mushrooms were phenomenal but I feel the fish wasn't cooked the way I'm used too. Most sea bass I've had melts in my mouth. This not so much. 

We did end the night on a high note with the croissant bread pudding. Absolutely amazing!!  I would go back for the bread pudding and coffee alone. 

Overall, a great experience and we will definitely head back!"}
{"text":"The Henry is located on the first floor of The Cosmopolitain right off of LV Blvd, so if you are walking down the strip in front of The Cosmopolitain it's literally just a few steps inside off of the strip. Great place for a solid meal 24/7. They really fun presentations and the food quality is exceptional. On top of that, the servers are very friendly and helpful and really do a great job at recommending the best dishes. Must haves: the pretzel bread with cheese sauce, donuts and beignets that are shaken in a bag filled with powdered sugar table side! Great spot, will come here again."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch this morning. Food was good but the staff was oblivious. I went with a stroller and the person taking us to the table kept walking with my two kids following. Not even to look back to realize I was stuck at set of stairs going up to the patio. Numerous patrons eating asked if I needed help with the stroller but the person showing me to the table could care less. 

Next came the service for food. Forgotten order then the guy looked completely miserable. 

Gotta say, all the great food was ruined by the terrible service attitude. Food 4-5 stars . Service 1 star."}
{"text":"We grabbed some grub here before our pool party reservation.  Breakfast was pricey but hey its Vegas right? Overall, food was good. I'd come back to it."}
{"text":"The taste of the food was the only thing good thing.
And the company.
They sat us outside NOT IN THE SHADE NOT IN THE RANGE OF THE MISTERS.  The waiter took forver to just get us water.  Not to mention taking our order.
A number of other servers went in and out with the other tables ariund us who were in the shade.
This is after bad service from the hostess who ignored us. And scoffed at us when we had mors people than expected and sat a smaller party in a much larger table than they needed.
The drinks took too long to get to us. And our second round of drinks were used in the same glasses as our first and had MORE ICE AND was practically all ice.
 The waiter didn't ask us if we wanted to separate our checks."}
{"text":"On the Sunday night of the President's holiday weekend, the strip and the Cosmopolitan were packed with people. The Henry was the first restaurant we were able to get into without a long wait. For immediate seating, we sat at the bar. The young bartender, Dan, recommended the munchie burger and most of the people sitting at the bar were eating one. So, we ordered the munchie burger and the pan seared salmon. The munchie burger is made with homemade potato chips stacked under the bun and was an excellent burger. The pan seared salmon was well seasoned and was served over a bed of small cubed potatoes, green beans, bacon, and some spring greens. We would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast. The restaurant has a fantastic open vibe. No issues with noise...from start to finish we had a great time! 

Brent provided excellent service and Doug made an unbelievable Bloody Mary. 

We ordered eggs and the lox plate. The dishes came with a side of potatoes. They were probably the best potatoes I've ever had. I would order both dishes again!

Great job Fox Restaurants!"}
{"text":"Well as stated in a previous review I wanted to give this place another try hoping my experience would be different but I guess not I got the same server and sat at the exact table Oh and you guessed it she didn't introduced herself, she had her back to me everytime she came to our table , she spoke mostly  to my bf  and we felt rushed the whole time we were there. I had the salmon which was cooked perfectly and my bf he had a burger which he liked as well that was the best part of the service. Poor customer service.....will not be back....."}
{"text":"good food , good service and I think its open all the time if I'm not mistaken. Had some sort of eggs benedict here and it was good. Honestly , I like the fact that this is across that bar with the loud amazing music. Like I want to have brunch here and then go drink with amazing music."}
{"text":"The best thing I can say The Henry has going for it is the venue -- spacious - and the customer service - friendly and accommodating.   But honestly, I wasn't impressed with the meal.  

Even with a week and a half lead time, the only time available (for four people) was 4:45pm on a Friday evening.   We ordered the artichoke hearts for appetizers and our drinks.   My friend tried the drink recommended by our server - The Red Stiletto - but like the food, the name was way more impressive than the food actually tasted.   For the record, I honestly thought the artichoke heart appetizer was delicious, but we all joked and asked when the rest of the appetizer was going to be served.

I ordered the Chicken Gyro sandwich.   I'm use to the Greeks who pile on the meat.  This sandwich had very little chicken (which was pounded down to thin strips).  The flavor was great, but the pita bread was overpowering any meat or filling.

We ordered the bread pudding for desert.   It was good, but kind of dry.  

So the short of this experience is this:   I can't find anything really wrong with this establishment. The restaurant definitely caters to Scottsdale (yup, I just stereo-typed) and to hipsters.   It's loud, but I liked the roominess of the room and the patio.  But after all the rave reviews, I was left under-whelmed by the foodie-experience."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst fox restaurant in the valley. We came here with a party of seven and were immediately turned away saying they, \"Couldn't seat that amount of people.\" However I noticed other reviews indicating parties greater than ten. 

After this I decided to give them another chance. We stopped by for a dinner and was informed that it would be a 45 minute wait. After an hour and twenty minutes our table was, \"Finally\" ready. After taking our seats the we eventually received a glass of water after 10 minutes. We ordered the Korean style skirt steak which came out Luke warm. The rice was slathered with chili sauce. It tasted like a poor mans bimbimbap. We also ordered the seafood Henry salad which can only be described as a side salad. It barely covered 1/3 of the plate and had no flavor.


If you're that curious to try this restaurant:
1. Make a reservation.
2. Don't show up hungry
3. Expect a long wait
4. Enjoy the ambience because that is the only worth here

I've lost hours of my life at this restaurant and it was one of my worst experiences I've ever had."}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars for the food and a little extra for being open late. The salads and shrimp appetizers were great but the scallops were too salty.  To all those who say this is the Denny's of Vegas, I say: you haven't been to a Denny's lately.  The Henry is far better than a Denny's and frankly is one of the better places in Vegas to get a reasonably priced meal."}
{"text":"Great bartenders, I had an old fashioned and the chicken fried chicken and a beer for Sunday brunch. All excellent."}
{"text":"great healthy oriented food in a nice atmosphere. the salads are large and almost a meal in themselves. I had the brussels sprout caesar, excellent. also tried the scallops which came in very flavorful sauce."}
{"text":"Their staff is fantastic!  We had a catered event here and the food was great, loved the kale appetizer and the chocolate cake dessert was great.  The decor is spectacular and I wish I lived closer so I could visit more often.  I recommend for events and for a fun dinner."}
{"text":"Great food, potstickers were amazing, best I've had. Skirt steak was a bit heavily seasoned, but good. Service was great, sat at the bar all night to watch the ALCS Wild Card Game, which was 5 1/2 hours long, but was comfortable the whole time and kept in good sprints by the bar staff. Great decor, nice staff, solid food, great location."}
{"text":"The Henry, what great atmosphere and food! We had the best waiter he was so personal and gave us great personal suggestions on food! He suggested getting the Black cod saying it's the best fish in the valley and he underestimated how amazing it is! The sauce pared with the black cod is a toooooo die for coconut sauce definitely the best fish I have ever had in my lifetime! Then for dessert we had the croissant bread pudding best bread pudding you will have! The bread pudding is pared with a homemade Carmel ice cream and whiskey raisins perfect touch! The croissant is their famous salted Carmel rolls that they service for breakfast! I can't help myself from using exclamation marks after every sentence because the Henry is that amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Suffering from a late friday morning hang over, my buddies and I found this great place on a mission to find some good lunch (a Cosmo bartender recommended it, since none of us had ever stepped foot in the Cosmo before). Upon seeing it I thought \"oh another expensive so-so Vegas restaurant\"...but I was wrong. Well...I was right about the spendy part, but what isn't expensive on the strip? The food was awesome. Okay start over.....the hostess was very friendly and didn't seem like she was going through the motions of hosting. We didn't have to wait to sit, which was nice. We ordered $12 bloody maries and sandwiches...I had the french dip, which was tasty. The fries weren't bad either, and being hungover, the fruit cup was flavorful. Service was actually good. We were actually really impressed with our experience. So much we came back the next day for breakfast/lunch, in which I had the reuben, which was also awesome! Okay we're not crazy and actually do like to try new restaurants, but we ended up back at the Henry a 3rd time the day we were leaving, but had to go else where because the wait was too long. I'm a Henry supporter!"}
{"text":"Having known nothing about The Henry, last trip to Phoenix, a girlfriend and I stopped by for lunch. I was a little thrown to be asked if I had reservations at 11am on a Friday, but we opted for a flat top for lunch. We started out with the popovers with the smoked ham butter, and WOW, don't let the idea of ham butter throw you, they were amazing. I had the roasted brussels sprout chicken caesar salad and it was probably the best salad I have had in years. The wait staff was well presented and very attentive, including other waiters who stopped by when our drinks were in the \"danger zone\" to make sure we were doing okay and to see if we needed another one. They also took the time to tell us about their weekend specials and where they were opening locations in the future."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of dining at The Henry threw times now. The ambiance of this place is AMAZING. The decor is so cute and homey, a nice lounge area too with couches.

The first time I went I had brunch and it was delicious. Great coffee, mimosa, pastries, and breakfast entrees. 

The other times we went for dinner. I don't remember what I had the first time, but it wasn't anything memorable. This time I had the chopped salad ($14) and I was not in love with it. 

The cocktail menu is extensive though and the drinks are delicious!"}
{"text":"My experience here was wonderful! Their menu indicates which items can be gluten free which was very convenient. And their kale salad is honestly the BEST I've ever had in the valley. Sooooo good."}
{"text":"Stopped for an ice latte and added a salted caramel roll. Heaven! Both so good!
I will definitely come try lunch here."}
{"text":"We have missed this place very time we've gone to Cosmopolitan. We took my parents there and they both adored it. My mother could not stop talking about her French Onion soup.

My husband got the fish and chips and loved it. Service was stellar and even though its adjacent to the casino and we sat right by the windows out to the floor it was not noisy or too smoky.

Loved it!"}
{"text":"came here with my friends after a night out because it was the only restaurant in the cosmopolitan that offered soup.

Our waiter did not have any other tables to wait on except for ours yet service was abysmal. He didn't know what the seasonal soup was, only two of our party of 5 ordered starters (not the share-able ones) and he assumed that the other three would want to wait for the entrees to all be brought out at the same time after the starters. The french onion soup was inedibly salty, the crab cake is above average but very small.

The bread for the table was brought out after we had finished our starters. The entrees were only so-so, the chicken pot pie had a great filling but the crust was worse than the crust on microwaveable chicken pot pie-- the kind you get from the frozen dinner aisle. The blah food combined with the painfully neglectful service was so not worth the 30 per person lunch bill, for that same price you'll get better food at a vegas buffet!"}
{"text":"Best pancakes ever? I must admit i didnt expect a lot fir a breakfast menu. But this place is a hidden gem. Not all food is ggod cuz its vegas and people mainly eat for convenience, however i ate here 2 days straight.i have no idea what ingredient makes these pancakes delicious. But i will gst them whem im here. Oh by the way..the staff is super cool and friendly for tourist spot!"}
{"text":"I wasn't with the regular eating crew . with mom grandma an auntie. They all ordered burgers an were pleased . mind u these are old world women  they don't eat out much. I had the meatloaf. It was comfort food at its best. Well done, peas with bacon wow  an mashed potatoes great dinner. I've been  fooled at these small diner with nasty meatloaf not this time"}
{"text":"The food was good, I'm vegan so that makes what I can order limited but I got the guacamole and quinoa tacos with no cheese and both were great. I loved the he atmosphere of this restaurant. I could have sat all night drinking and relaxing if they hadn't been so busy. I would love to come back for a relaxing late brunch or happy hour."}
{"text":"Another Fox miss.  I admit, I've yet to find one of their places that's good and yet I had hopes for this one.  Went with my BFF Friday at 5 for some drinks and appetizers.  Between us we tried 3 - none of them were that great and I couldn't even finish mine.  Had the popovers and brie toast - just ok.  Our server was inattentive and eventually went MIA so we had to hunt her down just to pay.  The hostess stand is in front so people linger by it and crowd the chairs in the lounge.  Bar was full but I'm not sure I'd want to sit on those odd, cheap looking bar stools anyway.  The patio looked like it might be interesting when it warms up - I think it has views of Camelback albeit looking over a parking lot.  Problem is there would be no good food or drink to have while you are sitting there!"}
{"text":"First time at  The Henry.  Great atmosphere .  Real wood butcher block tables, real leather on the booths,  oh yea, the food was good too!
Unique combinations and great drink menu
Acoustics were not good though"}
{"text":"I had the vege omelette which was just eh.  The egg whites seemed like they were cooked up 2 hours earlier and brought out and reheated, like a Subway breakfast sandwich.  Nothing fresh about it.  The veggies themselves were good - fresh and cooked just right.  But the entire meal was lackluster and seemed just a half notch above fast food."}
{"text":"I went here today for a friend's birthday. We had reservations at 12:30, but weren't sat down until 12:45-1pm (don't remember exactly.) It was busy and we had a large party of 7, so none of us were upset at all. When we were seated, the manager or owner came by and asked us if we had ordered appetizers, where we all said no, not thinking anything of it. He came back with complimentary cake slices, apologizing about the long wait. It was a complete surprise and really showed how much he values his customers! Food was delicious, I had the flower child scramble and the go north coffee. We all had a wonderful time, I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Food is Excellent,  wait and bar staff top notch. I just don't get the hostess team, horrible. A 20 min wait for a table outside when there are 8 tables available???"}
{"text":"The short rib Benedict is the best tender season with a dark sauce covering everything is worth it"}
{"text":"Consistently good food, great atmosphere, good service.  Seating is not easy and wait times for a table are excessive.  Well worth the wait as there are community tables and/or the bar area is just fine for two."}
{"text":"I visited for my fourth and fifth trip to the Henry my late trip to Vegas. When I stay at the Cosmo this is my go-to breakfast spot. The short rib Benedict, traditional Benedict, yogurt parfait (the Greek yogurt reminded me of ice cream and the granola was awesome). I haven't ever walked away disappointed."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant. We had our first experience here about 3 weeks ago and our server was Dana. She had so much personality and love for her job that she made me want to return. This is nice e my second visit and my server was Patrick. Definitely would ask to be seated in his section my next time around. This seemed like his \"in between\" job. He seemed so unhappy to be a server and it showed throughout the evening."}
{"text":"Oh Sam Fox ... Another win in your restaurant book. 

The restaurant is as beautiful as they say in other reviews.  It is contemporary, yet hipster, with a Euro flair. Whether you sit inside, outside, bar or at  the large coffee table it is a nice relaxing atmosphere.  

We went there for breakfast and chose the bar for the TV {football Sunday}. 
**Weekend Note - Arrive before 10am - NO waiting**

Le Pig $11.00: scrambled eggs, ham, havarti cheese & mayonnaise on a toasted croissant.  Review - AMAZING. Perfect portion and havarti cheese is a nice addition to a traditional sandwich and truly didn't need the mayo and was glad to have requested it on the side. 

Caramel Apple French Toast $10: brown butter cinnamon apple & maple syrup. Review - Okay. It is a thinner bread and not filling. We did have to send it back the first time because it was cold. However, the manager quickly came over to apologize and she removed it from the bill.  

Iced Vanilla Latte:  One of the best latte's I have had in town ... 

Thanks Sam for another gem in Arcadia, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Fabulous Atmosphere!  Great food too!  Exceptional service!  I visit here quite a bit!  If you are thinking about a visit ...just do it...it is worth it."}
{"text":"Reconciling after our Ingo's spat (see previous review) Companion and I stumbled into The Henry on New Year's Eve and were greeted by three men in tuxedos and women in elegant gowns.  Taking them for Maitre D's and Hostesses, I immediately tipped the one who looked like he was in charge.  He dutifully escorted us to two seats in the center of the bar.

Our bartender, Teddy, a cross between Nikki Six and late '70s Ronny Wood, informed me that the tuxedoed gent did not work for The Henry.  I was out a quick sawbuck.

Undeterred, Teddy poured Companion a mean Martini and a capable Coors Light.  (No Miller Lite, so loss of a star immediately). The Menu was divided into appetizers, which looked great, and main courses, which looked expensive and enough food for the massive Offense Lineman of the visiting Fiesta Bowl Teams.

Opting for smoked salmon and chilled shrimp, the food was tasty and filling enough for our needs.  Our attention turned to the atmosphere and people watching. The restaurant is cool and the clientele in the place was a combination of the hoi pollio, social elite, literary cognoscenti and hardened criminals.  Surely a good mixture for New Year's Eve celebration.

The evening moved on to champagne, served in a traditional glass and not a flute! (Stay Classy The Henry!) The crowd got bigger and more energized and very well dressed.  Stepping out to use the facilities, when I returned Companion's chair was empty, the tuxedoed crowd had left and the large limo parked in the front was gone. She had opted for a better celebration.

Consoled by Teddy and another Coors Light and running into my favorite The Henry person, Monica, I suffered through another sad New Year's Eve. HOWEVER, The Henry was a winner and I look forward to going again!"}
{"text":"The Henry is Arcadia's elegant twin to Scottsdale's oh-so-scenester Olive & Ivy.  Where Olive & Ivy is flamboyantly contemporary, boisterous, and as loud as it can possibly be,  The Henry is cleverly Olde English Riding Club, self consciously refined and keeps its volume well under control (all without being stuffy, however).  Both are phenomenal places to get together with friends, it's just The Henry exudes a more intellectual and intelligent atmosphere while Olive & Ivy is about letting your inhibitions drop as much as you can in public.  I love them both.  The food is spectacular at both.  Just know that The Henry is the place for young hipsters who want to act like Old New York Moneyed types, and Olive & Ivy is for affluent Middle Aged professionals who want to enjoy playing at being Kardashians.   Get into the right mindset and you'll have a fantastic time at either one!"}
{"text":"The Henry is a gorgeous place to grab a bite.  Everything we ordered was tasty and fresh.  Service was fast a friendly. A+"}
{"text":"Place is great.  Nice set up, staff was pleasant. Steak was delicious! Ordered steak and it was beyond delicious! Definitely will be coming back a few more times!"}
{"text":"Solid French Dip sandwich & truffle tater tots! Very attentive service. Perhaps best of all: open 24/7"}
{"text":"Well the fam and I have made it to Las Vegas.  We are staying in the Bellagio and of course we love, love, love that hotel.  What's not to like about the Bellagio?  Everything is A++, BUT we decided to walk over to the Cosmopolitan and have breakfast at The Henry. 

i guess I can see why some people would consider this fine dining but honestly, it was in the walkway shortly after the entrance to the Casino and it felt more like a upgraded cafe than anything fancier, but it was nice enough.

We all ordered eggs and a protein (sausage, bacon, etc) and entres came with potatoes and bread and we are big aqua drinkers so the two sons who were with me ordered water.  Since I really don't eat carbs, I asked for extra sausage and an unsweet ice tea.  How about the ice tea was $5 and the extra sausage was $7.  So for three people our bill came to $68.00. plus the tip.  That's expensive even for Vegas.  I mean I have been here a few times and since I cannot use colorful language here I will just say we got screwed.  Food was not \"that\" special.  Ihop, Sizzlers - heck any of those breakfast places could have served us the same thing at about equal quality.   I guess the big difference here is, we did have cloth napkins, and our waiter had on this nice little pants set with the matching vest..it was nice.  No, no really it was just downright cute, now not $68.00 worth of cutieness but I was trying to find something that would help me comprehend why my breakfast cost so much.  Sat there stunned for a few seconds, couldn't figure it out and so we just left and went on our way.   

The Cosmopolitan is a beautiful hotel and casino but if you see the Henry, just remember what ya girl KB told you okay?  Average food, high prices...cute little guys in pants and vest.  If you think that's work $$$ go for it!  Next day we went back to the Bellagio for the $19.99 per person buffet includes all drink and I cannot even begin to explain the variety of choices.  It  is unbelievable and hands down the.best Buffet I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying (disclaimer: minus any cruise ship that I have been on because they are the king of buffets)."}
{"text":"Came here tonight for my birthday for the first time and I will DEFINITELY be back! 
Our server Patrick was extremely nice and helpful and gave us some of the best service we've had around! 
We started with the guacamole and oh my goodness it was so amazing! We followed with the steak sandwich and chicken which were both so delicious! 
Drinks: we ordered two different mules but the best was the pineapple and passion fruit mule!!!!!
Looking forward to our next visit!"}
{"text":"Delicious!!! The food is amazing!!! We order our food and got served in no more than 10 minutes. I tried almost every appetizer and my favorites were the potstickers and the salmon one. The place is beautiful and the service is great. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The Henry is a beautiful location however the wait staff and general management is unwelcoming to say the least. We tried the Henry on a previous occasion and it was just as poor. Wait staff was clueless as to menu. After two attempts we will not be back. Sad as it's such a pretty place."}
{"text":"This place has a stellar ambiance. I give their interior designer five stars but the food, prices, wine selection, quality, brunch menu, etc. far less. The brunch menu is not that tasty at all if you're a foodie. If you are hung over and just looking for something quick to eat not going for a quality perhaps this is your place. It's very trendy and has a great appeal but again, the food is way overpriced and not that great. The only reason I continue to go back is because their coffee bar atmosphere is really great for me to study. I ended up studying late last night and ordered some food there and was charged a two dollar up charge for a piece of bread with my already overpriced pasta. $14 for a salad that was the size of a starter plate, not worth it. They have fine dining prices and the quality is just not there! Do not be fooled by the myriad of Teslas, Porches, and S class Mercedes that you see in the parking lot. I think this place gets away with the prices and low-quality food because it's become more of a hook up joint. If you're a cute girl, be prepared to be hit on multiple times while dining or studying! ;)"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful dinner at The Henry last night. The service was great and the bartender was very knowledgable on the menu. I ordered the lemon and herb chicken, which was executed beautifully. The seasonal vegetables were crisp and fresh. I will definitely make it a point stop here again on my next trip into Vegas."}
{"text":"This is a must every single time I go to Vegas. The best eggs Benedict you will ever have. Order the potatoe skins with pork, they give you a green sauce to go with it, it is amazing. The Henry is 5 stars every time, the flavor a explode in your mouth, the good comes fast"}
{"text":"Dude, The Henry?! 

Food - So good. Never had anything here that I did not really like.

Bar - Everything about this is awesome. The bartenders are super friendly and fast. The drinks are awesome. The look of the bar is cool. 

Service - This place makes me want to bring all my other 5star reviews down to 4 so that it is fair to this wait staff. Every person I've ever had is super friendly, fast and helpful. Only once have I ordered something on my own accord. Every other time I have asked for a recommendation and the nail it. They never recommend the most expensive or anything like that. Good people.

Notes: Great place. Can't say enough about the staff (waitstaff and bar)."}
{"text":"Came here for a late, weeknight dinner in August when we were staying at a resort nearby. We'd put off dinner and then needed to find a place that was still open.

I loved the decor, great vibe and tons of people, though we were seated immediately. I had a good cocktail and enjoyed my burger.

It looked like they do a great morning program with good coffee. I'd love to try that and to go back for dinner."}
{"text":"I tend to eat quickly, but the food at our brand new neighborhood restaurant, The Henry, was so spectacular that I took the time to savor every delicious bite.  

From the starters (grilled artichoke hearts with Parmesan and truffle aioli, and some delicious cheddar popovers with ham butter) through the main course (wild mushrooms in hand-rolled tortelli with roasted squash and Brussels sprouts) to dessert (salted peanut butter bar), everything mouthful was a delight.

Welcome to the neighborhood, Henry!  We're going to be good friends."}
{"text":"I would probably give this place no stars if I could. First of all the waiters do not know the ingredients in the food. Managers don't know ingredients in the food. And then when they get something wrong they blame the customer. I told them no truffle butter in my bolognese. There was truffle butter in it so I told them could you please remake it and The manager said the chefs said there was no truffle and it. Everybody at the table confirmed that there was traffic in the food and the manager all pissy said fine I'll remake it. Tasted horrible on the remake and my fav dish, I will never go back again! Usually love this place but this is the first time they've ever had attitude like this!"}
{"text":"Maybe this place is good but it was so crazy crowded we had to leave.  Parking is very limited.  If you have a Porsche and worried about a good parking space, forget it.  you are going to get dinged in this crazy parking lot.  I saw several women with huge Suburbans trying to squeeze those into tiny spaces then slamming the doors into adjacent cars trying to get out.  Anyhow, very stuffy and entitled, spoiled hostesses like you are bothering them to put your name in.  Then they want to 'text' you for your reservation.  Well, i gave a number went outside, 45 minutes later no text.  I dedided to just leave rather that go into those snots and asked what was going on.  so, i didn't get to try the food because I couldn't get past all of these challenges."}
{"text":"Would honestly give this place 4.5 stars if I could.   Admittedly, the only meal eaten here was breakfast but we ate breakfast here 3 out of 5 mornings during our Cosmo stay.   Found the service to be great (Larry is an excellent waiter).   Sure it's pricey but it IS the Cosmopolitan.      Loved the touch of fresh OJ served from a martini shaker and found the huevos rancheros to be among the best I've had."}
{"text":"Decor is lovey and the food is average. The Moscow Mule should have stayed behind the iron curtain. The corn beef was \"aged and cooked for half a day\" translated it was too salty and had not have time to develop flavor. The fried chicken sandwich was as flavorless as a chicken breast could be. Service was good. Waiter nice. Kitchen slow and the bar tender needs an education. I would gladly have them decorate for me but not feed me."}
{"text":"Brunch so delicious we went twice! A group of 6 starving girls were looking for an awesome brunch to kick off our weekend in Vegas. The Henry exceeded our expectations!! 

We started with Bloody Mary's. I had the Mary Pickford as I love a Bloody Mary with a kick! It did not disappoint! Perfect amounts of dill and spice without being over heated! For our first visit I had the short ribs Benedict and I was very impressed!! There meat was melt in your mouth good!! The flavor combination was too doe for! In highly recommend it! Form my second visit I had the breakfast burrito and it was equally excellent (be sure to add avocado)! 

If you are in Vegas and looking for a fantastic breakfast you definitely want to visit The Henry!!"}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to dining here since they opened and have seen my friend's rave reviews. Finally got the chance on October 15th for my belated birthday dinner with my beau. Everything was perfection! We were seated right away for our 8:30pm reservation. We were sat at a roomy booth which was perfect for my BF to finish up some work on his laptop. Our server Luci was great! It was her 1st night serving on her own (without a trainer) and she was a gem! Very knowledgeable about the wine and food menu. Fabulous job Luci!

We shared the Smoked Norwegian Salmon appetizer, I had the Roasted Rosemary Chicken with cauliflower \"polenta\" and brussels sprouts and my BF had the Korean Style Skirt Steak. It was all wonderful! We shared the German Chocolate Flourless Cake, which was just OK (I wasn't expecting it to be spectacular without flour...the BF has to eat gluten-free, though) and Salted Caramel Ice Cream...delish! Also had 2 specialty coffees with dessert.

A wonderful dining experience from start to finish and added to our \"Favorite Restaurants\" list!"}
{"text":"Was excited to see this new space from Sam fox right next to their office. Per usual the decor is awesome and the place is buzzing. The food was good and pretty well priced and they have the best Moscow mule in the city and I love me a mule! The downsides were that it's so freaking loud in there you can't hear anyone, including your waiter. They need to adjust the acoustics. Seriously. And it took a long time to get our food, so long that a manager came out an apologized for it. Overall it was a pretty good experience. I would say that everyone seemed to be the Scottsdale over 45 crowd...who may wear their daughters jeans and have had some work done. But to each their own so if you are in the market for some good looking middle aged people go get yourself a drink and a date here!"}
{"text":"Breakfast is good but dinner is not worthwhile.  If you want a savory bread, go to Beckett's Table for the bacon cheddar biscuits.  My boyfriend and I agreed we like those much better than the popovers here.  If you want bread pudding, City Grille's is better than what we got here.  Just wasn't worth the cost."}
{"text":"What happens in VEGAS does not stay in VEGAS! I had a horrible experience here at about 3 in the morning...maybe the employees at this time think it's okay to provide crappy service during these hours, since most people are drunk anyway. They messed with the wrong sober person! The restaurant was not busy at all, but we had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated due to limited staff. When we were finally seated, about ten minutes went by, and no one had come to greet us or ask for our drink order. During this time, I looked around to see who might be our server, and met eyes with one of the servers working there a few times, but nothing came of it. Finally, I flagged him down to ask if he knew who our server is, and he told me he was our server. I was very confused at this point, because he had seen us sitting in his section for the past ten minutes, and did not greet us. His excuse was that he did not see our entire party sitting down at the table, so he did not greet us. He was correct about our party, since we were missing one person, but I thought it was odd that he would think it's okay to ignore us until this missing person showed up. My friend and I put in an order (two over priced burgers). About 20 minutes passes by, and we're wondering what happened to our food. We flag down the manager to ask him what is going on with our food, and he comes back to tell us it will be an additional 10 minutes, because the patties are thick and take long to cook. At this point, I\"m pissed, because our food should have been brought to us within 15 minutes od ordering. I become even more pissed when the manager takes no accountability for the service that went wrong in this situation, and says the waiter put it in 15 minutes ago. That's what put me over the top, because I knew it had been about a half hour at that point from the time we put in our order with our waiter. To top it off the people who sat down about 15 minutes after us got their food right after we did. At this point I was expecting some type of discount or free fries...something! The manager only repeated that they did nothing wrong and followed all of their policies, which is to wait until all of the party is seated before greeting a table and the food was brought out within 15 minutes of being ordered(forgetting the part where the waiter didn't put our food in right away, which made it take 30 minutes to come out). Therefore, he told us there was nothing he could do. Very upset that he was refusing to take any accountability for the horrible experience we had, I went up to another random server on my way out to ask him about the policy they had on greeting tables. The server totally refuted this so called policy they have. So not only was the service horrible and the food was over priced, but the manager turned out to be an asshole liar who apparently thought it was okay to provide shitty service to us because we were just another group of drunk people to him partying in VEGAS! I think I could have gotten a better experience at McDonalds for $1."}
{"text":"First time here and won't be the last.  
I had the carrot cake pancake that was amazing. Was worried that it would be too much but was perfect.  Doesn't come with sides so I ordered the potatoes as a side.  Both are items I would have again but curious about the apple caramel french toast.
They have a table side cart of Bloody Mary -they use several different infused vodka's.  
Ambiance is great.  They have a patio if you want to chill outside and your fur babies can join you table side.  Inside looks like a beach house.  Very comfy and inviting.
Will be back to check out the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Best drink I have ever had. So fresh. Fig and ginger mule. Spring 44 vodka figenza fig, lime, pomegranate, ginger beer.."}
{"text":"Amazing food, amazing style.  We had mixed drinks, appetizer, salad, main course, and dessert; each 5 stars.  And this place feels like home.  Not my home, but maybe a rich friend's parents' home.  So much so that I felt appreciative that they offered to let me eat with them.  Stupid I know, but it's the truth.  That being said, I LOVE a place that feels fancy, where I wonder if they are okay with me bringing my toddler, then they bust out the high chair and kid's menu.  I'll no doubt be coming back here, often.

Definitely note that you'll want a reservation (at least for dinner on weekends from my experience).  We eat dinner early, like 'old people' early, but getting there at 5:00 was not early enough to get us a table on a Saturday.  The next weekend I called on Thursday only to find Saturday was already fully booked, so we reserved for Sunday.  Point of story, call ahead."}
{"text":"Service was scarce even though I saw a number of servers running around. Waited 15+ minutes for our second drink and when another waiter brought it out he didn't even pick up our empty classes. At 20+ dollars a round of drinks I expect more quality service. It was a beautiful day and we would probably have stairs for a few more but the wait and lack of service we moved in to the next watering hole. Sorry Henery we won't be back there s just to many other great places with impeccable service that will get our hard earned dollars."}
{"text":"For my first visit here it was a great experience. For my second visit, it was terrible! I originally made reservations for 6:00, then called back and made them for 6:30. When we got there they hadn't changed the reservation time and had nothing available for us. This was supposed to be a special night for my aunt and uncle's anniversary. Also, there was no seating in the waiting area and my husband is disabled and can only stand for a short period of time. While we were waiting, a bartender came up to us and asked if he could take our drink order, which is the only thing that kept us from walking out. (So, thank you bartender with the glasses.)
  

Neither of the managers by the hostess station even acknowledged anything was going on, even though I went up there multiple times to check on our status. By the third time up, they finally sat us or else we just would have left. 

We ordered a salad that  we never got and the manager never came over to our table to apologize for the reservation mix up or offer us anything! I feel like we would have got better service at a lower end restaurant.

I went back the next day to talk to a manager to see if the salad was on our bill and while he was very nice, we still didn't get any compensation.

I will only come back here if friends really want to go, but will never come here again for a special occasion. Which is sad because it's such a cool place."}
{"text":"My favorite Fox Bros restaurant though they all seem to be great.  This place just seems to be even more exceptionally well managed. Great Bar staff!  Great food!  Great service!  What more could you ask for.  The best short rib in AZ.   Korean skirt steak is also absolutely yummy!  I haven't had a bad dish here nor a bad drink (Mimosas, Bloody Mary's, Paloma's, Mules,etc.).  Busy on the weekends but you can usually find a seat at the bar and will get great service there."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Scottsdale west hands-down!  I try to come here whenever in town for business - stay at the Phoenician, it's only a few miles away.
Although the food is fantastic, I come here just as much for the Gin and Tonic No. 8.  Best G&T ever!!  Nolet's Gin, grapefruit peel, grapefruit bitters, tonic.  Wow, amazing!  Still trying to recreate it at home...
I have been here maybe 8 times.  Never had a bad dish.  the short rib is amazing.  The Skuna Bay Salmon is really good - and I'm from Seattle and rarely order salmon outside of the west coast.  Had a new black cod dish tonight with a coconut sauce - delish!  All the sides are good, all the starters are good.  Like I started with - never had a bad or even mediocre dish here.  Service is usually quite good - prompt, knowledgable on food and the drinks, but not overly formal or pushy.  Fun, lively ambiance - kind of upscale business casual.  Love the patio - if it's a little cool they have the heaters on.  If it's hot, they have misters on.  So you can be outside in most temps unless extreme.  Like I said - my go-to place!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but the selection was a little limited and seemed a little expensive compared to other places. They said they had just changed to a new menu.  The place itself looks great. Service was great with plenty of suggestions."}
{"text":"We had a great dinner at The Henry last night.  Great atmosphere and the waiter was very good.  I had the pork chop and it was amazing.  My husband had the branzino and said he would definitely order it again.  They have a great drink menu as well.  Suggest making reservations since it was pretty packed by the time we left with quite a few waiting for tables."}
{"text":"***This review is for the breakfast bar.***

I've been thinking about going in for awhile now and I am so glad that I did! This place is adorable. It looks like a library meets a hotel lobby. It definitely could be a wonderful place to work from home or for a business meeting. 

As for the food, I tried the egg sandwich and the salted carmel sticky bun. OMG the salted carmel sticky bun was out of this world and it was especially nice because it wasn't too heavy like a normal cinnamon bun. It was thinner and lighter. The egg sandwich was solid and enjoyable.

The only downside (which wasn't big) is that the coffee is just so-so and they only have one option to choose from, but that could change since they are new.

Overall a great experience and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This review is based on the customer service I received. Was in town for a Bachelorette last month and decided to make a reservation for 12 ladies. For larger parties, reservations had to be made with the Sales Department and a Deposit will have to be placed prior to the event. In addition to the 8.25% sales tax, there is a high 21% Service Fee that will need to be paid as well. I had requested that my party's orders be placed before we arrived, as we were on a time schedule between events and I did not want to waste time ordering after being seated. With that, I also requested that our first appetizer be brought out shortly after seating to save on time. I had sent a copy of our party's orders via email a few days before my event. I had worked with Jody, who was quite helpful during the whole reservation process. She made it very easy for me and answered all of my questions. Overall, great customer service pre-event. However, I had to knock down a star for the customer sevice upon arrival, I found out that our orders have not been placed beforehand--- Fortunately, I had printed out a nice hard copy of our orders so I was able to just hand that over to the waiter. In addition, explaining the situation to the hostess was not the most pleasant as well, as she could have been a bit more understanding and helpful. After all the work i had done beforehand to schedule our time efficiently, we ended up having wasted time anyways waiting for the food items to come out immediately as they were not prepped beforehand. You would think that with the amount we paid for the dinner, they would cater to any of our requests without issue. Overall, the food quality was fine, each of our 3 courses was satisfying-- no problem with that."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed the first time at The Henry, and subsequently, my best friend dined there and rated it one star, Against better judgment, we decided to give it another shot. We went with another couple, to celebrate his birthday. Our server made the evening enjoyable, simply by her incompetence providing laughs.

He ordered a bottle of champagne , and was served a glass. We pointed it out,, and she tried to tell us that we did not order a bottle. Well, we all heard it, and she was wrong. She relented, and said she would go get it, and tried to take the glass away. We all know it was going in the trash - so when we told her not to take it away and she said she'd add the glass to our check, we all looked at each other, then her, and asked her to leave it. She agreed, and said she would have to charge us for it. I was flabbergasted. Ultimately her coworker witnessed the event and took it off for us.

The entire evening went like that. It was like she couldn't agree with us on anything. She closed out the evening without disappointing our expectation of more poor service and argumentative behavior.

We asked for dessert menus. She told my wife that the bread pudding was amazing, and practically melts in your mouth. My wife said, yes, I'll have that. Our friends ordered an espresso. She said she'd be right back with the espresso, and dessert menus, so we could see if wanted to order anything.  We said, we just want the previously ordered bread pudding, which unbelievably she didn't agree that we had just ordered. In fact she got confrontational about it. I'm sorry, but are we not the customer?

One star, not going back. Thanks Henry!"}
{"text":"Great And friendly service... Ordered the burger and truffle totts! I'm not a huge Tott fan but they were good! Ordered the burger medium rare to medium but it came out well done.... I was hungry so it was still good at that point... And for a late night spot! Nice waitress/hostess.....I'm torn between 3 & 4 stars, so I'll be nice and round up since the service was friendly!"}
{"text":"We stopped by the Henry for brunch while in Vegas. The service was great. Our sever was very attentive and was able to accommodate my requests. He was great. The decor and ambiance were good too and so were the drinks. The food however was not great. It was regular brunch food. How do you mess it up? Just bland and tasteless. The French toast was good though. It's on the strip and inside the Cosmopilitan so it's super convenient. However, if you're looking for mediocre food I'm sure you can go elsewhere and pay less."}
{"text":"We were seated quickly, as it was not busy, but then waited and waited for someone to come and take our drink order/bring water. Then we waited and waited for our drinks. Food was alright, but not worth the price. Husband did not care for his roasted potatoes.  Probably won't eat there again."}
{"text":"It's the cutest restaurant in town with great service and fun menu.  Only problem is as other Sam Fox restaurants the food was quite salty."}
{"text":"This place was WAY overpriced for what we got.  I ordered an Eggs Benedict which was $17 to take back to my room. 

First of all, there was no hollandaise sauce (I will try to find a way to post the picture I took).  Second, the English muffin was chewy and burnt (so chewy, I broke the plastic knife).  Third, my toast was burnt.  For $17, I'd expect my breakfast to be nothing short of amazing.  

Although there was a nice antibacterial wipe, which I appreciate, and a tiny jar of jam, this breakfast was most definitely not worth it."}
{"text":"Great place for Sunday Brunch. Bloody Mary custom  made at your table. I had the cucumber vodka finished with a crisp slice of bacon. Best I've ever had. Service was slow due to crowd. Make reservations and your party will be seated right a way."}
{"text":"Argh!  Why did I come back!!  I just love the ambiance of this place, I want the food and service to match!! After having to flag down the bartender to give is menus it all just went down hill!  The final insult was when we told him how incredibly salty and inedible the hamburger was he told us to tell them no extra salt on the tomatoes next time!  Sorry won't be a next time!!"}
{"text":"The Henry exceeded expectations this morning. Immediately upon walking in you know you're in for a treat. The staff was friendly and service was exceptional. Our outstanding server, Braden, recommended the Chicken Fried Chicken along with The Chevy Chase. I ordered the chicken and was not disappointed. Eggs cooked perfectly, chicken amazingly crispy, and the English muffins were phenomenal.

Can't wait to return and give dinner a try, I'm sure it will be similarly fantastic. Not sure what's more surprising; the level of service for this new of a restaurant or the quality of food delivered."}
{"text":"The Henry gets 5 stars for one reason and that's because they used Van Gogh Dutch Chocolate in the best chocolate martini ever. Had this Delicious cocktail for brunch and for this reason alone The Henry gets 5 stars.

I also ordered the sandwich with truffle tater tots."}
{"text":"This review is for breakfast. The food and service were excellent compared to other casual restaurants on the Strip and for being in a hotel. First , the piping hot strong coffee comes in these large mugs which are perfect. The first day we had the All natural omelet made out of butter less egg whites and veggies (no meat) and the breakfast sandwich. Both were well prepared with quality ingredients and tasted delicious. The second day we wanted to come back for the French toast which looked amazing. We were not disappointed- full of butter and the right amount of sweetness and accompanied with warmed syrup (a nice touch). We also had the huervos rancheros which was full of marinated steak and no beans! The portions are just right and you won't leave being hungry. The prices are reasonable (for the strip and being in a hotel)...most of the entrees are $14-$17. Breakfast for two will run you about $40 plus tip. That may seem high but being from san francisco its wasn't that much that more.  Go to the Henry if you want quality, well executed food and service ."}
{"text":"Definitely won't be back here. Starting from the beginning, we have a party of 10 so we put our name in and asked if we'd be able to be seated near the rest of our party, hostess said it was no problem and we'd have a 20 minute wait. Okay no big deal. We didn't expect to all sit at the same table but at least close to where we could visit with our out of town family but we instead got seated across the restaurant from each other. That's cool, it works because we're hungry. It takes 1/2 an hour to 45 minutes to take our order then as we're waiting, the waiter spills hot coffee down my uncles back! All he says is \"sorry\" and walks away to help another table. Few minutes later the manager, Elizabeth, comes over to check on the accident. My uncle is clearly covered in coffee and upset so he asks Elizabeth to make sure our party is covered. She had the worst attitude and made it very clear that SHE makes the decisions and while she'll cover our table, she won't cover the rest of our party. Repeatedly telling us that she makes the decisions and \"it was clearly and accident\". As our waiter clears our table, all he says \"I apologize, it wasn't my fault.\" Needless to say, we'll be going through higher channels than Elizabeth because she was very rude and unhelpful.   We didn't expect any royal treatment but at least try to make it up instead of throwing attitude and making our party feel at fault. Just wow..."}
{"text":"My mom had breakfast here a couple months back and has been raving about the potato hashbrowns ever since. We stopped in during brunch hours. I looked over the breakfast options, $16 for bacon and eggs? I think not. The build your own burger for $15 seemed like a deal by comparison. We were able to sub the fries for the hashbrowns.

I had a medium burger (actually prepared to order) with monterrey jack, carmelized onions and bacon. It was surprisingly good. The bun was soft and airy. I was pleased how well it complemented the burger. Too often bunds are dry and dense. The hashbrowns were breakfast potatoes formed into a cake. The didn't thrill me. Even my mom was left wondering why she recalled them being so tasty. 

Service was prompt and friendly. I'd return."}
{"text":"PROS: the Henry is open 24 hours, it's a nice to look at, and the food is pretty tasty.
CONS: Wow, is it expensive. 

I am willing to throw caution to the wind on vacation and I will pay a lot for a truly wonderful food experience. But the prices at the Henry are on par with the inflated cost of room service and it's basically diner food. Granted, it's better quality, but not *that* much better. I say, if you want to go out and have a comfort food in a stylish environment, go for it! I don't regret stopping there for dinner on our first night in. However, had I thought about it and looked at the prices more closely, I would've stayed in my room, ordered breakfast the next morning, and luxuriated in my pjs on the terrace for roughly the same price.

Saying that, I can see The Henry being an excellent stop for food after a night out. The decor is lovely, with over sized fringed lamp shades, cozy booths, and  leather chairs. The wait staff is friendly and attentive. I had a pretty decent french dip and truffle tater tots (honestly, they just seemed like straight up tater tots, but they were still good). The french onion soup is really good too. I have to say, I wasn't all that impressed with my omelet at breakfast the next day. But, we were in a hurry and they got us in and out quickly. 

I'm glad The Henry exists. For a 24 hour hotel restaurant. it's actually pretty fabulous. Stop in for dessert or an appetizer for the best value."}
{"text":"Nice, relatively quiet place for breakfast on the strip. The bacon was some of the best I've had. I'd come back for that alone."}
{"text":"what a delicious spot! I'm not sure I've done this before but we ACtually went back twice in the same day for their omelet + breakfast potato. 

pleased to report that it tasted just as amazing when sober.

their french toast is also to die for, but it's decidedly a better option if you're wrapping up your night as opposed to starting your day - very sweet & a bit heavy on an empty stomach. brilliant for a stomach full of liquids.

the fresh squeezed OJ is a must.

only (tiny) complaint - the tables for two are...well, cold. if you sit opposite your date and stretch your arms all the way across, you won't reach your counterpart. if you're seeking cozy, ask for a table for 4 and sit on the same side, lol.

dinner menu sounds delish as well - will have to give it a try the next time I'm in town.

all in all - great spot in a great setting. the Cosmopolitan is easily my favorite place to be in LV!"}
{"text":"Been here twice now, love the open feeling of the restaurant.  The servers treat you really well, very friendly. Great drinks as well.  I would go with the short rib or the roasted chicken, really nice on both."}
{"text":"Just had Sunday breakfast here: the food, service and people watching were exceptional. I had to take a star off for the coffee which was awful. It must be a cheap low grade- it was so acidic it curdled soy milk even when cool..."}
{"text":"It brings me joy. Oh wait that's the opening for a different review.... Ehem. (Clears throat)

It brings me great indifference. 
\"What does?\" You may ask yourself. 
This place. I swear I was kidnapped and transported right into a Polo catalogue. It's got a cool layout and the patio is nice with a pretty great view. 
The yelp said it was $$ and the menu actually says it's $$$. Which is fine. Well, by fine I mean money is worth spending on goods and services that have an equal and fair market value. Half a butterflied chicken breast an two 4oz sides should not equal $18. 

If you go here and you like artichokes. They have grilled ones. If you don't get them. You will feel like you are missing something.. Like how it feels when you lose your keys.  They were perfection on a plate. I would go back for these. 

I ordered dessert. The menu said chocolate cake!! What! Who tha! Yes come to pappa. 
When the cake was delivered it was shoved in a small mason jar thingy. Ok cool, be hip and innovative and all that but what happened to being amazing first, like pre innovation? Chocolate cake. Bake the thing and slice it, then put a slice on my plate. If you do simple amazing it doesn't seem so simple. 

Overall the experience was a welcome one. Ohhhh wait. Let me back that thing up. So it was not busy, yet from the moment of inception till the moment of completion took almost two hours. 30 mins of that was spent waiting for the check. 
Ehhhh to sum this up- \"meh\"

And I'm out!

{"text":"Friend and I went here for dinner this week. We opted to sit outside since it was a nice night. The drink menu was great- great choice of wine and beer and interesting cocktails. As far as food, we ordered the guac to start and did the chicken and bolognese as our mains. I'd skip the guac- too many weird things in it, clementines, pistachios etc. there was more 'stuff' than avocado.

As far as the main courses both dishes were good but the Bolognese stood out! It's a perfect portion with unique noodles- think really big elbow noodles.

You're probably thinking why 3 stars if the food was good. Well, our waiter wasn't great. When we asked for his recommendation on food, it was clear he was trying to upsell us. When my friend ordered the chicken he literally said 'the best thing I like about it is the sides, and you can get chicken anywhere'. He then suggested the steak - which spoiler alert- you can get anywhere. We spent most of the night talking about the service than the food! I'd go here again but I'd hope for a different waiter."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here. Restaurant is open 24/7. Great pancakes and breakfast platters. Go early as it does tend to get busy."}
{"text":"Favorite coffee and breakfast spot! They have a restaurant and a separate area where you can order coffee and food to-go off to the side. After 9am on the weekends, it gets pretty busy so you'll want to go in early. The quinoa burrito and the wildflower coffee are my go-to items!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful! It can be pretty busy but it is a nice atmosphere! I was confused at first how it worked, but in the morning I learned you walk up to the register, order, and they give you a number and serve you at your table. In the afternoon and evening, you are seated and served as a regular restaurant. Hope this helps! I'm looking forward to going back again soon!"}
{"text":"Ate there twice during our stay.  Not to exaggerate, but fantastic service both times.  A call out to our waiters Steve and also Larry.  Could not have asked for better service.

For breakfast the Short-rib Benedict was great...and for late night try the short-rib tatertots!"}
{"text":"My group had a great experience overall at The Henry. We dine out a lot, and we're picky about food. We were initially concerned after looking at the menu that there weren't enough choices. But we were wrong. The food was flavorful, and I loved the dish I ordered. The atmosphere is perfect for a Saturday night out, it was lively, comfortable and almost felt like a modern speak-easy. I felt like I was at a bar restaurant back East. I personally loved the coffee bar too.

I think our good experience was also attributed to our waiter Luis. He was patient with all of our questions, answered every question carefully, made sure we were happy with our meals, made suggestions based on our needs, and then allowed us to sit and talk after our meal without rushing us out. This is a rare experience in the restaurant industry. 

Amazing food, first-rate service, another win for Fox Restaurants."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to trying The Henry for quite some time.  Unfortunately, the visit didn't live up to expectations.  

Our server seemed somewhat awkward with her recommendations, but I remained optimistic.  We started off with the duck confit flatbread, and found that the duck was extremely salty.  The date portions were very large and my husband found a pit on one of his slices.

We ordered the shortribs and black cod between the two of us.  Although, I thought the black cod had delicious flavor, it was, again, too salty.  The shortribs were very tender and the texture was perfect, but it lacked depth of flavor, and in this case, lacked salt.  

Between dinner and ordering dessert, our waitress actually spilled my fig and mule cocktail.  I told her that it wasn't necessary to replace the drink because I would be ordering wine with dessert but when the check came, she hadn't take off any of the drinks, including the drink she spilled.  
We ordered the peanut butter banana cake, which was tasty, but seemed a little disjointed with the room temp cake with frozen chocolate bananas on top.  The best part of my meal was the glass of '11 leviathan red blend that I had with dessert.  

Overall, loved the ambiance, decor, and ease of getting our table with our reservation. Disappointed with the server and lack of recognition of her mistakes with the meal.  Also, would have expected more with the meal in general; seasonings were off.  I would be willing to try again for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"This is the first Fox Restaurant that I want to return to.  Normally the food is mediocre at Fox Restaurants but this place definitely stands out.  The ambiance is very trendy and it has a very fun vibe.  Make sure you have reservations though otherwise you will not get a table.
Now for the food...everything I tried was delicious!  The chicken gyro is very tasty and their half baked chicken leaves you wanting more.  The mac n cheese is a great side dish too!  I had the bread pudding for dessert and it was enough for 4 people.  
I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Very, very good.

Not as good as the owners would like you to think, or the ladies of leisure having lunch would want you to believe, but pretty darn good.

Lots of people watching, but if bad plastic surgery horrifies you....I would suggest steering clear."}
{"text":"Been here a few times for client lunches and recently for a date night.  Great environment, tasty food, strong cocktails, terrific atmosphere.  Service was fantastic.  We had 4-5 different staff members assist throughout the meal (take orders, remove plates, refill water, pick up check), but never felt smothered or overwhelmed, they were working together lock-step.  The kale dip appetizer was the best app I've ever had, and for $3, the ice cream dessert can't be beat."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee shops in Las Vegas:)

FOOD & DRINK: At first I was hesitant to eat here because the dishes are $20-25 on average. I have now dined here a few times and I can honestly say it's worth paying for. I highly recommend getting The Henry Breakfast which is served all day. I get the bacon and eggs with fruit and white toast (you have to ask for fruit or white toast or they will give you potatoes and country toast). I also love any of their salads with grilled shrimp. They use really fresh ingredients. Nothing too fancy on their drink menu, just the usual.

SERVICE & ATMOSPHERE: The few times I've been here, it seems like they are redecorating so the furniture always changes. I'm sure it will look great when they are done. The service is nothing special here. The waiters all seems really busy so you have to wave them down if you need anything. They are very accommodating if you ask for something."}
{"text":"Their breakfast is excellent.Coffee tasted great,Orange juice tasted great,omelet was awesome.Service was good."}
{"text":"For myself, The Henry is the place to grab coffee and breakfast while I do some work.  However, when friends were in town last weekend, I couldn't wait to show off this spot to them and we headed over for lunch.  We started with the white truffle Parmesan fries with spicy ketchup and creamy truffle aioli, they were fresh and hard to stop eating.  For the table we got the Roasted Brussels Sprout Salad, Original Chinese Chicken Salad and the Kale and Apple Salad.  Clearly ladies were lunching healthily.

In all honesty, the food was good but we had expected that the Roasted Brussels Sprout salad would be full of shaved Brussels sprouts and not just a few halved into the salad.  When you list it as a Brussels Sprout salad, I think people assume it's more Brussels than romaine but that's only my opinion and I'm a Brussels Sprout lover, I eat them every week.  The Kale and Apple was well done but the Original Chinese Chicken salad was my favorite.  My friends were put off by the strong ginger flavor but I love ginger, the stronger the better."}
{"text":"This place is great. If you are hungry in the middle of the night or after partying, visit this place and you will not be disappointed. The food is good and the people are friendly. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich, it was really good but it was not as greasy as I hoped to absorb all the alcohol I had previously consumed!!!
Overall a clean, vibrant restaurant."}
{"text":"Had the Salmon Bagel Lux. On point, Bloody Mary cart was excellent and the Mimosas are to die for. Recommend the grapefruit and Yusuf. Iced coffee was great as well.  Server was a little absent, but we were the only table in the back of the patio also. She was a great server though,"}
{"text":"OMFG!!!  Best french toast!! Steaks, tots and sandwiches are great too.  Pricey but services were nice.  YUM!"}
{"text":"I have been there twice. The second time was for my 35th wedding anniversary. The food was great but I was not happy where they sat us after I requested something special due to our anniversary. Also, I would not have chosen if I knew the noise level was going to be that high. And one last thing - I know it is in Arcadia but how do so many families afford to take children to a rest of this caliber with a high price point? They have a pisco sour drink which is to die for."}
{"text":"My husband and I loved everything about this place! The decor is gorgeous with a lot of big windows and high ceilings and our meal was delicious. This is one of the few places we've been able to find a Pisco sour and it was perfect. Next time we're in Phoenix this will be one of our first stops!"}
{"text":"Woe this place is awesome. The food is delicious. The atmosphere is incredible. A bit of an industrial deal. Open floor plan, can be loud once it gets crowded. Service is excellent."}
{"text":"Great environment, decent food, weird service. This place is all about being seen at the scene. I went there the other night with a friends and it took forever to order then too long between dishes. The waiter had a strange side kick who followed him around everywhere he went. The two of them together were like two lost puppies. I don't know why the extra guy was there. It was almost like a scene out of The Grand Budapest Hotel.

On a better note I do enjoy the breakfast and it is a nice place to get coffee. I would recommend this place for breakfast and brunch rather then dinner."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast and service. Omelette was delicious and eggs Benedict was fantastic. My husband switched out to add smoked salmon to the Benedict and Sarah was great about it. She even offered a fresh coffee to go. Good prices for a Vegas meal and comfortable atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and most importantly- HEALTHY meal choices. Thank you so much!!!! Can't tell you how happy it makes me to find a restaurant in LV that serves healthier selections."}
{"text":"Food is good, but service in the morning is horrible. They have you stand in line to order for 30 mins, but there are tons of people working here. Is there a reason they can't take your order? Very particular about where you can and cannot sit as well. Customers were coming in, being directed to wait in line then leaving."}

Yelp Review
The Henry
4455 E Camelback Rd
Phoenix, AZ 85018
(602) 429-8020

Went to The Henry for brunch last weekend with my friends, and I think we had a good time overall. The Henry is a very busy and trendy restaurant and, to be honest, taking good pictures was one of the reasons made me and my friends go there. 
Although we waited for half an hour before we finally got the food, the slow service didn't make us mad. First, we didn't make the reservation under the circumstance that we've already knew there would be a lot of people during the weekends. I strongly suggested making a reservation before you go especially during weekend. What's more, they have sofa and chairs outside at the side patio for people to wait. The patio and the wall with their name The Henry on it are good places to take pictures with friends. 
We then got our seat and I had to say the ambience was very good. The design of the restaurant and the decorations made it a good choice for family and friends at weekend. Our waiter was friendly and willing to help when we ordered. 
We had Smoked Norwegian Salmon and dumpling as appetizer. The dumpling comes with six pieces in delicious sauce which is a perfect appetizer to start a meal. Our slide was French fries which was finished really quick by four of us. The French fries was only $6 and it tasted so good. As a result, we then ordered the second one. We then ordered two Egg White Turkey Omelette, a Spicy Sausage Scramble and a Chicken Fried Chicken from the weekend brunch menu. The coffee there was so good to drink. There were four of us and each of us had different coffee. It came out that all of them were really good to have. For the Egg White Turkey Omelette, there was roasted turkey, smashed avocado, tomato, and swiss cheese in it. Egg White Turkey Omelette is essentially a brunch staple so how could anyone go wrong with it. One of my friends had Chicken Fried Chicken which includes Buttermilk biscuits, country gravy, and sunny side up eggs. Another friend ordered the Spicy Sausage Scramble. There was Chicken sausage, eggs, zucchini, corn, spinach, grilled onion, and havarti in Spicy Sausage Scramble.  It turned out that I will definitely go to The Henry next time and I will try Spicy Sausage Scramble next time because all the other dishes may be a little bland for me. While others may consider no flavor to be the best to have in brunch, I would like to eat something spicy. 
The price was not so high for bunch and I think the food deserve this price.
Therefore, I give The Henry a five point because I like the food, the coffee, the atmosphere, their service and their price. Although we waited for half an hour, I think the food deserve waiting. Moreover, one of my friends was form Japan and she said she love waiting and actually most of the Japanese love waiting. [504 wds.]"}
{"text":"I found a piece of glass in my dessert.  The GM apologized and said he'd look into the issue and make it right.  He came back and said it was likely plastic from a fruit skewer and that the desserts would be taken off the bill.  $14 (~10%) off the final bill - don't do me any favors.  And don't tell me it was plastic when I was the one who shattered it in my teeth.  

Garbage experience and worse recovery."}
{"text":"I enjoy dining at Henery's. Always great food and wonderful service. I have been coming here for the past five years and I go out of my way to come here and eat for the above reasons, plus it is not a rip off like the rest of restaurants on the strip.
Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Great vibe. Wonderful food. Well-trained staff. Tables are not jammed right on top of one another. This is a can't miss place on your places to eat and enjoy"}
{"text":"Loved the seasonal salad! Butternut squash and nuts-yum! Try sweet potato semifreddo was fantastic! My husband enjoyed the chopped salad too!"}
{"text":"I have been looking forward to going to The Henry for months and I finally went today.  The ambiance was great! I first had the wildflower latte and I must say it was fantastic, I wish I would have ordered a large.  I was seated quickly and everyone seemed to be kind.  I ordered the French toast for breakfast, and all I can say is that it was absolutely fantastic.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is because the waiter I had was quite slow and seemed to forget my friend and I were customers.  Other than that, I would go back again and again!"}
{"text":"Amazing. Delicious food. Fabulous service! I was visiting family in the west valley but luckily was able to bring them out to the Scottsdale/Camelback area this weekend to sightsee and try this fine dining restaurant. I had never heard of the Fox Restaurant Concepts because I am from the east coast, but I could not help but want to try all of his restaurants to see inside his imaginative mind! First of all, the design--interior/exterior, was amazing! Very modern but also felt homelike with a nice industrial feel but the art was much more old fashioned. The bathrooms were very clean and nice as well as the tables and booths. It was very open and I felt very airy and free in the dining room. What was extremely nice was the fact that the kitchen was ALL open! Customers could watch the cooking and it felt very comfortable knowing that I could see how they prepared each meal. Normally these open kitchen setups would appear loud and obnoxious as a normal kitchen would be but this arrangement didn't seem that way! The people at the table next to us were louder than the kitchen 2 feet away! Next-- the service! It was so pleasant! Our waitress was so sweet and very open to talking about food and the area as well as her home town of New Jersey. All of the waiters/waitress were dressed in the same outfits and it looked very put together and added a nice touch. The manager was very nice as well as the other waitstaff. I definitely had a good experience with the customer service. Lastly, food and pricing. This is definitely a place were one wouldn't go on a regular basis. This is a FINE DINING restaurant so if one comes in expecting a cheap meal this may not be a place for you! But it wasn't unreasonable either. Entrees ranged from 15-25 dollars and sandwiches were anywhere from 10-15 dollars. The food was so appetizing, from presentation to taste Fox really knew how to prepare a meal! I came in very hungry and came out fuller than the moon that night! I recommend this restaurant to anyone if they'd like to a have a great experience in fine dining, fabulous customer service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"Went to the Henry yesterday.  It was a Saturday and they only offered the brunch menu.  Was very excited to go after reading most reviews and knowing fox usually does a nice job at restaurant concepts.  The location and the building its self was exceptional.  Great decor and ambiance.  That is where the compliments must stop.  The food was sub standard and the service marginal.  When we first arrived, we were invisible.  Bartenders, hostesses, and even managers walked right past us, no eye contact or a hello. When we tried to get a glass of wine from the un-busy bar, the bartenders were to engaged in talking to each other and a group of girls.  Once again totally ignored.  

Now the food.  I have NO idea how anyone could rate the artichoke appetizer anything other than detestable.  It was a boiled, unseasoned artichoke in a bowl.  Has anyone had the artichoke at Houstons or Hillstones? They are fabulous, tasty, grilled, seasoned.  I was embarrassed how this undercooked, boiled, colorless artichoke was sent from the kitchen.  Next disappointment:  was the battered chicken sandwich, the chinese chicken salad the the french dip sandwich.  All the food was almost cafeteria tasting and looking.  I have had tastier chicken sandwiches at Jack in the Box.  the salad was tasteless and dry.  I asked for more dressing and 10 minutes later she arrived with a thimble full of dressing.  The french dip was the most discouraging.  A un-toasted white dry roll, with slivered beef.  So simple to make the bun tasty by grilling it and adding butter.  Once again, since the Henry is trying to have several menu items like Houstons, they need to get it right because the french dip at Houstons is to die for.

I wanted to like this place SO much and it was all miserable except the pretty couches and great decor.  :("}
{"text":"We had the chance to have two meals here on our last trip to LV. 
First comments on the restaurant. Great Location, Great people watching by the entrance to The Cosmopolitan Resort, beautiful decor, non smoking.....Too Small......... Just about every time we walked by it, there was a wait... 
Now the food 
The first time I went my GF was at the spa as part of her birthday present. I went down for a late breakfast and there was a line (see above). 
The hostess said the bar was seat yourself , so I did and the bartender took my order while I enjoyed a complementary New York Times newspaper. 
My ham and swiss cheese omelet was excellent and the jams to go with my rye toast was perfect. 
On Sunday afternoon we both went down for a late breakfast, a 15 minute wait (see above) and we were seated and quickly waited on. I had the corned beef hash with 2 eggs over-easy, hold the hollandase sauce. Excellent. My GF went the non chopped up route and had a Reuben. Large, but not HUGE. It was very good also, I should know , I finished the half she could not. 
Great service, very good food ... one star off for the always wait. 
If fact we went elsewhere at least one other time because I did not want to wait."}
{"text":"You can not go wrong here. Breakfast is great !!! Service rocks and the drinks aren't bad either ! The smoked salmon plate was to die for ."}
{"text":"Poor service and the food isn't impressive. They totally messed up my order and my the time they brought me the right plate, everyone at my table was done eating - and the unfriendly manager wouldn't even comp my entree. There are a lot of options in Vegas - don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"I had the Black Truffle Lasagna and it was amazing. The lasagna was individually baked in its own tin and came out warm. I also shared the Warm Croissant Bread Pudding and Peanut Butter Banana Cake - they are the absolute best. With a party of 4, it wasn't difficult to finish both of the desserts, but I definitely had a sugar rush afterwards. 

The atmosphere of The Henry is very relaxed, perfect for both family dinners and casual business meetings. I would definitely like to come here again."}
{"text":"Very hip, and visually appealing.  The food was great- nothing out of this world, but very good.  The service was excellent, too.  Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"It's tough to find somewhere in Vegas serving breakfast opposed to brunch...the Henry fits the bill. We ordered Traditional eggs Benedict on toast with a side of hollandaise & it was very good. You can't really go too wrong with breakfast but it was still very good. They also serve fresh oj."}
{"text":"A service business that cares!  After posting my disappointment in last weekends service I had a response from Chelsea the GM. She apologized - which was great to hear but not really necessary as we liked The Henry. She even went as far to say with advanced notice they could make those great carrot cake pancakes. They may even get back on the menu!  Seems like they were a customer favorite. She will look into training, as that was my theme in both posts. She ended with a very courteous and generous offer to \"make it up to us\". Chelsea is the kind of GM who watches the store and cares about customer feedback. She was positive and made me feel like my feedback was important to her. We will go back and see how things shape up. Cannot loose if the carrot cake pancakes are on the menu."}
{"text":"Since my fiancé's family are all fans of the Fox Restaurants, we were excited to try the newest addition, The Henry.  It was a Thursday night, and it was still lucky we had reservations; especially while the hype is high, this place is hoppin'.  We were seated very quickly, and our server walked us through some popular appetizers and beverages.  Though several of the cocktails looked delicious, we opted for their specialty sodas which did not disappoint.

Our server recommended the salmon appetizer, served on potato cakes.  We also got the artichokes, knowing how good they are at the other Fox restaurants.  The salmon was a hit, the artichokes were not what we expected.  I still liked them but the rest of the table wasn't as impressed.

All the entrees were superb.  I had half a chicken with Brussels sprouts and kale/apple slaw, and the slaw was the highlight of an all around great meal.  My fiancé's skirt steak was tender and flavorful.  Future Mother-in-Law's Branzino was, according to the fish lovers in attendance, very good.  

Dessert was the Peanut Butter Bar dish with chocolate ice cream, which I highly recommend!  Our service was excellent all evening.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is a classy, old-timey place with classic menu selections.  It's definitely a cool place, and I'm sure we'll be back!"}
{"text":"So delicious! Another success by Fox Restaurant Concepts.

I had the CB & Rye (a reuben with a twist, basically) and it was so delicious!  Love the decor and our server was knowledgable, friendly, and prompt.

I had been wanting to try this place out for awhile and I'm so glad I did.  I didn't realize they also added such a cute patio to the building.  I'm definitely going to go back as there were plenty of other things on the menu that sounded fantastic."}
{"text":"Homey, charming, comfortable- a perfect place to spend time working, having a meeting or enjoying a delicious meal or celebrating with friends. The coffees are delicious, the food is great and the cocktails are wonderful as well. If you've never been, it's a neighborhood must."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here. In my trip to Vegas I loved being able to get a great breakfast at 1AM. Our server Jesse was very accommodating and on his job. The atmosphere in the Cosmopolitan was awesome, cool lighting design and the DJ was playing some smooth mixes. 

I had the The Henry breakfast with avocado, and sourdough bread. Hot coffee to balance out all my beer drinking. I can't wait to come back next time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food here is yummy but the vibe is a little off. Our waiter was cool but the hostess said a snarky remark to us for no apparent reason."}
{"text":"Went to The Henry for a late breakfast.  The atmosphere is chill and the same can be said for the staff.  

We had the egg Benedict traditional style with avocado.  It was not the best but in line of what you would expect.  The star of the show was the vanilla French toast.  No syrup needed for this treat as the use of a croissant style breaking with a flaky sugared crust and powered sugar on top.  This provided a perfect buttery sugar blend that was the best I have had, even better than Lynn's Paradise (the winner of the French toast battle against Bobby Flay).

This is almost worth a plane trip to get and then fly back to Cali..."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious, the service- ok.  Our waitress was nice enough, not overly friendly but not rude by any means.  

We had the Mediterranean salad, the Chinese chicken salad, the roasted turkey French dip, and the warm croissant bread pudding along with scoops of dark chocolate and salted caramel.  It was all very yummy.  Our favorite was definitely the roasted turkey sandwich, it was so so good.  

Not only did we enjoy the food but we loved the ambiance and the décor.  I loved the café in the entry, much like an upscale starbucks.  I found this restaurant to be quite eclectic and just beautifully done.  The food was the cherry on top!"}
{"text":"I like the decor of the place, but the food (at least the plate I had - CB and Rye) was just ok...definitely not worth the price they charged. However, their homemade sodas and lemonade was good."}
{"text":"We celebrated our daughter's birthday with our server Seth and the amazing team at The Henry, and it was an event worth talking about. From the moment we walked in, the service was second to none. Seth gave us great recommendations, in-depth explanations of the menu items, suggestions on pairings, and was impressively attentive to us. And then the food came!  WOW!  Every bite was awesome! The flavors popped and were balanced; and each item from the short rib potstickers to the salads to the soup to the salmon, tuna, steak and Mac & cheese for the kids -- WOW!  And, then dessert!  I'm still dreaming of the chocolate/peanut butter cake with the Banana gelato!  Awesome.

I get to train service consultants in the automotive world on what great customer service looks like, and Seth and his team at the Henry are always in my list of examples of Truly Exceptional customer service.  Great Job!!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"My review is for their breakfast only. I ordered the country fried steak and it came 20minutes later with soggy potatoes at the bottom of it. The food was a little bland and my friend ordered the fish and chips we didn't like that dish either. For vegas the presentation and quality just wasn't there."}
{"text":"Love going to the coffee shop on Saturdays to study then enjoying a meal and a drink after my study session. Also great for brunch with friends or intimate dinner with your spouse.  The ginger black cod and the the caramelized scallops are my favorite meals to date, but still trying to have a taste of everything. They have freshly squeezed grapefruit juice with pulp and it is wonderful in a greyhound cocktail."}
{"text":"Wonderful brunch. The Short Rib Eggs Benedict was absolutely wonderful. The Cinnamon Roll French toast was great. The only thing that keeps us from rating this higher is a mixture of the price and the \"maple syrup\". It was certainly better than the fake \"syrup\" but not as fine as quality as we expected. It had an off-taste that reminded us of caramelized sugar."}
{"text":"The coffee is amazing but the breakfast food isn't that good, honestly. Pretty place and good vibes but wasn't blown away by the food."}
{"text":"My favorite fox restaurant! I need to find out who did their interior design because it's beautiful! And the food is great! I'm the kind of person who hates eating salads unless someone else makes it for me so this is where I go when I want a salad. Their menu changes and right now they have an ahi tuna salad. One of the best salads I've ever eaten and that's no exaggeration. This is the perfect place to come eat or grab a drink with a friend."}
{"text":"A friend who was staying at the Cosmopolitan recommended The Henry. After a night of shenanigans, seven of us requested a table. Due to the time (1:30am-ish), we were sat relatively quickly. The restaurant was nice and had an open atmosphere. Our server was Elias, who was very friendly and took fabulous care of us! I couldn't decide if I wanted the breakfast burrito ($17) or french toast ($16), so I ordered both! The portions are huge and the food was fresh and delicious! My friends ordered their doughnuts, nachos, and buffalo wings, which were devoured. I definitely suggest gettin' your grub on at Henry's!"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss... I really don't understand why it's always so crowded. They have an amazing kale salad but their breakfast sandwiches have way too much mayo."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.  Had great service although I thought prices were high for the offerings.  Happy Hour was kind of a joke, only available at bar and no food on special.  Would probably save my money and just visit their coffee shop that appears to serve some light baked items."}
{"text":"The place, as all FRC is really nice.

The food, as all FRC is meh. 

The avocado toast was pretty good, though. With a hint of smoked flavor was really interesting.

The short rib was fair but nothing memorable.

There's a coffee bar inside the place which adds a nice touch. The Butcher was good.

I had also a home made soda (pineapple) which was really tasteful. 

Be aware that this place is a little pricey for what you get.

I talked to a friend of mine about this place and she said that when she went there were bugs everywhere. When she said that I remembered that while I was waiting for my friend I saw a tiny spider descending and landing right at my table. Yes, I wacked it. Shame on me.

If you don't expect much food wise, this is a really nice place.

Cheers"}
{"text":"I went to the Henry for my birthday dinner with my husband and a few friends. We found out when we got there that it was restaurant week and there were some good deals to choose from on the restaurant week menu. Our waitress kept our glasses full and did a great job handling our excessive questions about the menu and drinks. 

The drinks that came from I'm the bar were fantastic, a majority of the food was delicious, service was great. I would recommend the Henry to friends.

What I would suggest trying: 

Cocktails- From the menu, Ole Kentucky and Texas Paloma were solid. Also had a mojito and it was just good.

Appetizers- Made to Order Guacamole and Smoked Norwegian Salmon

Entrees- Skuna Bay Salmon and Braised Short Rib (The Roasted Chicken wouldn't be a first choice)

Desserts: I tried the Lemon Meringue Tart and Warm Croissant Bread Pudding and didn't care for either of them."}
{"text":"Love having breakfast here! They have an awesome baked goods selection. I always get a blueberry muffin, soooo good! The flower child omelet is delicious, filled with chunks of veggies like Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes. The avocado toast with smashed egg...need I say more? 

I've been there for dinner a few times. I really like the lobster salad. Patio seating is great when the weather is nice.

Good vibe, decent service, and lots of seating."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar for brunch.  Staff is nice. Bloody Mary wasn't that good at all.  Breakfast was delicious.  I had the crab cake with eggs Benedict. Then a mimosa."}
{"text":"Always good! The service is excellent as is the food. The short rib potstickers are amazing. Their patio is great for a relaxing evening."}
{"text":"For the price of the food you would think that the food would be amazing. Actually let me backtrack, from the look of the place you would think the food would be better.  The Henry is actually a really cute brunch place tucked in the corner of the Cosmo. We went there for brunch on Sunday and was kind of disappointed.  First of all the waiter couldn't understand that I wanted a sweetened iced tea.  When he did he brought me a raspberry one that tasted like the ones you get from brisk (too sweet).  We ordered the corned beef has and the build your own omelette. The beef hash was pretty good, but in whole it just seemed lacking. (and the bacon, which was thick strips was cooked way too much so it was like eating bacon chips instead of nice crispy bacon).  The omelette was the same it was good but nothing more, it was just and ok meal. 

But, the best part of breakfast was definitely the jam.  So good, not where they got it from but it didn't taste artificial."}
{"text":"24/7 dining with Vegas flair. Not your typical 24/7. For starters, the pulled pork potato skins with jalapeño aioli are a wonderful version of the traditional. They can be a meal on their own! Truffle tater tots..yum. Burgers really good. $18 good? Only with the tots! Breakfast looked good haven't tried yet."}
{"text":"Came for breakfast, ordered an omelette. It was massive and delicious. The eggs weren't that hot, and it kind of fell apart, but it was very tasty. Lots of avocado and goodness inside of it. They don't skimp and the service is super fast. I liked this venue and would reccomend for a low key meal."}
{"text":"Checked this spot out for AZ Restaurant Week and was not disappointed. The food was great and service was great, even my 10 year old loved it, the kids mac and cheese was great..I am not ashamed to say that I stole a few bites. I ordered a salmon dish and it was grilled perfectly. We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Love the Henry, great service, great ambiance, great food & drinks. They have live music for brunch on weekend, wasn't too loud which was perfect! 
The Henry will definitely remain one of my top favorites for brunch. They are fairly busy all the time, so just expect to wait a little while, but they always offer you to go to bar and get a drink or something while you wait."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here and it was very good. Shortrib Eggs Benedict was excellent and so was the Croissant Sandwich."}
{"text":"There isn't a single thing on the menu that will fail you! Roasted chicken with Mac n cheese and mashed potatoes is the best! The chicken is so tender and the best chicken over ever had!"}
{"text":"This place has been in East Phoenix for quite a few years now. It's still busy all the time. Which means it's pretty good. 
 My friend made us reservations for lunch. Because, she said it so busy it's the only way to get a good table. We had reservations for 1:00 but, we still had to wait about five minutes which was fine . 
We got a nice table against the wall.

 They have a huge menu for drinks. Which is what a lot of new places do,push the alcohol. However, The Henry also have a lot of choices for nice drinks with no Alcohol,but, still fancy and flavorful. Love that.
 The food here is absolutely divine. It is hard to choose what to get.
For an  appetizer my friend chose the Smoked Norwegian Salmon. It came with potato hashbrowns and arugula for $14. It was great.
My friend ordered  roasted chicken with rosemary. Skinless and boneless I had a bite and it was great . 
I got the prime rib sandwich which came with horseradish Aioli. We both got sides of brussels sprouts, really good.
 Of course this was far more than we could eat so we took some to go. Then we got dessert. Since were celebrating my birthday. 
 Chocolate peanut butter molten cake.  It came with banana gelato.  As well as the Pear Basque Cake,  that came with Pear sorbet , which is the best sorbet I have ever tried .

 If you're having lunch or dinner here I would suggest giving yourself plenty of time so You can enjoy the ambience and the food. The parking lot is packed. However, they do have complimentary valet service which is nice. 
 The restrooms are located by the coffee shop. Yes, there's a coffee shop located inside the restaurant as well. So if you just want something quick and relaxing there's that. They do provide the upstairs for private parties. So it's quite a all-in-one fine dining restaurant."}
{"text":"I thought it was me,  do had to do a little research.  Ordered the cod and noticed it smelled and tasted fishy.   Thought maybe that is what cod is like,  but found out fishy taste in cod means it's not fresh.   If I can taste it through he ginger glaze then it must be sketchy."}
{"text":"Tiny portions. After receiving my pasta entree i had to order more food because it was as if they were feeding a 2 year old. The pasta was a little on the salty side. Took over 30 minutes for us to receive our food although the place was slow. Ther server was very nice though."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I often office here for the day. The Turkey French Dip and Kale Slaw is my favorite lunch. Le Pig is my favorite breakfast meal. Good atmosphere.  Be prepared to wait during hot peak times."}
{"text":"Its ok... food... if you are hung over this is the perfect place for a burger to soak up the liquor.... staff is ok.. now pricey a little high for a burger. .. but once again you are im Vegas. .. everything is high"}
{"text":"Literally, the cutest place with excellent food and amazing service. Like, literally. 
Already planning my next visit!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, spectacular service! Prices are a bit higher than other options in the area but the food is well worth it.

Amazing place to grab a nightcap, the bar staff is phenomenal. Great place to people watch as well :)"}
{"text":"If you don't know where this is, it is in the Cosmopolitan on the first floor to the left of the main street entrance. If you're looking for privacy away from the casino you won't find much of it. Most seating allows for patrons look out onto the casino floor & for passer byers look in. I found this distracting while trying to hold a conversation as there was so much people watching going on. There are a few tables where you're hidden, but not much.
We made reservations for a Tuesday night & arrived early. There was no need for a reservation as the place was pretty empty. Getting our drinks took longer than it should, but when we got them they were quite strong. We ordered the Naan bread which we got w/o olives. It's pita bread w/ pesto, cheese, and a few other goodies. Very tasty.
I had the fish & chips & my date had the steak & fries. Both meals were also very tasty. Keep in mind that the menu is small, a few items in each of the categories. The food was great, the atmosphere & decor were on point. 
My only negatives are what I stated earlier & the slow service. Everything seemed to be delayed. Our server only had 2 tables when we arrived & we were 1 of the 2. 
If you're staying at the hotel or near it, it's worth it to check it out, but don't go out of your way."}
{"text":"I was expecting this place to be great... went for brunch last weekend. Busy but meh.... The food was very average... My friend had the carrot cake pancakes with a cream cheese icing... they sounded like they would be interesting but they were just plain gross. I had something more normal, the egg white turkey omelette, this was much better than the carrot cake pancakes but very plain tasting. We ordered a bruleed pink grapefruit ( this was better than both our entrees! yummy). We also liked the Bloody Marys, they were good. The atmosphere didn't seem that special, almost like someone's living room. It wasn't bad but I was not excited by The Henry either."}
{"text":"My server/bartender was Erika....I was hungry at midnight at The Cosmopolitan.  She did a great job serving up the drinks, and the Tater Tot Nachos with short rib were delicious.

The kitchen was a might stingy with the short rib bits, but the overall dish was a winner.

I ate at the bar....the only downside was some really moronic patrons who hadn't quite figured out where you a can and cannot smoke indoors in Las Vegas.

I'd eat here again(hint.....ask for the tots extra crispy, helps keep them from getting soggy)"}
{"text":"I was surprised when I called they let me put in a reservation for 2 for breakfast. Doesn't happen often but they did it here. The food was good but service a little slow."}
{"text":"Came in for Mother's Day Brunch and so glad I chose this place to take my mom and sister. I had a reservation, but I did have to wait an additional 10-15 mins to get a table as they were running behind. Despite it being a busy day, I thought they did a good job with bringing out our food because I didn't feel like we were waiting too long. We were given an additional order of truffle fries because they thought we were waiting too long even though we didn't notice lol, it was a nice gesture. I must say, if there was one thing I could change about my experience, it would be the food I chose to get which was the Turkey Omelet..I personally didn't like it and thought it was bland. Our server was awesome and everything else was great."}
{"text":"Really great breakfast spot. They have a lot of options to please diners of all breakfast types. Their signature pancakes are bananas foster, if that gives you any indication. They have a few other griddle options as well. Lots of omelets and scrambles and a pretty large a la carte selection too. My sister and I split the veggie scramble and brioche French toast. Both were really, really tasty. 

Atmosphere is good. Even though it's right on the strip and inside a casino, it's not the typical Vegas spot. It really felt like we weren't in Vegas at all. A plus, if you ask me."}
{"text":"French Dip Sandwich & Cold ice cream with Hot Chocolate Chip Cookie dripped with Chocolate, total Heaven!! 

That's the best for me and the only thing I eat every time in Vegas. \"The Horseradish is my dip for the fries. Best Horseradish ever!!"}
{"text":"Custom bloody mary cart? Amazing decor? Delicious and healthy food? Fox knows their restaurants, and this place is no exception. The decor is so stunning and interesting, it's enough to keep me coming back and bringing guests by itself. No need to rely on the decor though. Their kale salad is one of my favorites, and their food is healthy and tasty."}
{"text":"Nice service and I've been to this place several times over the years. The food was about as bad as it can be. French dip was awful with many pieces of bones in it which I thought chipped my tooth, luckily not. Asked for tots got soggy limp fries. Huge disappointment for a food service place that's typically reliable in an otherwise great hotel."}
{"text":"I stopped by in here late one night because it is one of the only restaurants open 24 hours at The Cosmopolitan. The restaurant is located right by the side doors leading out of the casino, and since it is an open-air restaurant and we were in the middle of winter, the place was cold!

We ordered the tater tot nachos, which were pretty good but heavy, as expected. We also ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with the tomato soup, which was absolutely divine. I highly recommend it.

The only issue we had at this place was the service. The host and our waitress were very nice, but everything was just extremely inefficient and both of the dishes ordered came out without our requested alterations. We were issued a small credit for the mix-up, but weren't very satisfied because no one was coming around to check up on us. (We were only given one set of utensils for two people, no napkins, etc.)

If you're looking for a late-night bite in the hotel, this is not a bad option. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here though."}
{"text":"Must try the avocado toast and Bloody Mary ask for the bacon vodka! Soooo good! The waitress was so friendly there, shot out to Moriah!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favorite spots to kick it at. This place hits all three aspects. You can go on date here , get work done in the coffee/lounge area and you can also do your occasional brunch here. 

Great place to people watch and even network as well. You'll get the occasional cougar with a healthy and hearty appetite."}
{"text":"Great menu, love the space. The only bad thing is that the hostesses are facing the room with their devices....not the door. I stood there for maybe 2-3 minutes. Just watching them...But Nate, who said hello  when I first walked in, saw me still standing there when he passed by again, got me quickly squared away.  Now I was well on my way to having a marvelous lunch. Nate took very good care of us for the remainder of our visit. We ordered this skirt steak sandwich and it was delicious. Tip: get the fries with the truffle-whatever-its-called. So Yummy!! Can't wait to get back here."}
{"text":"I've been here three times, and have had excellent experiences each time.  The service is friendly and the menu has good variety and high quality.  I recommend the reuben with sauerkraut and yellow mustard.  Incredible!  

Definitely one of the \"must visit\" places on the strip."}
{"text":"New favorite restaurant and meal! This is an incredible neighborhood eatery. I got the roasted chicken with Mac & cheese and mashed potatoes and I don't think it could've been any better. 

The service is also the best I've received at any restaurant I've been to. Everyone was kind and went over the top to please us. 

I HIGHLY recommend The Henry to anyone looking for somewhere to eat in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner during CES.  While service was good, the food was not.   Many people had the sirloin, which looked like the sole of my shoe.  Presentation looked like a TV dinner.  I had simple pasta ragu.  While it wasn't bad, it was something I could have whipped up in my kitchen.  I'm not much of a cook.  The beer and wine lists were small and underwhelming.  All the beer offerings were Anheuser Busch brands with no local or independent craft brews listed.  Very underwhelmed. Probably best for breakfast/brunch, but stay away for dinner."}
{"text":"One of my favorite brunch spots (they are not as vegetarian friendly on the daily menu)... I adore their coffee drinks and the cheddar popovers (my meat eating friends use all the bacon butter while I stick with the herb butter), but the Bloody Mary cart is my obsession. House infused vodkas and personalized garnish options for your adult-size glass make them a solid choice. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Was just here with fellow yelper Lila H. when we were in Vegas this past weekend...

Overall experience was not so bad...but I've definitely had better brunch elsewhere for a fraction of the price we paid. I was here on an incredibly empty stomach and hunger was clawing at me like an angry animal, but considering how food usually tastes phenomenal when you're starving, the Henry didn't quite quench that hunger. Sure my stomach was full afterwards, but other than filling the empty void, my mouth and tastebuds were left wanting more.

Lila H. ordered the Henry burger which she ate open-faced. She said that without the buns, the burger really wasn't that special. The fries that came with it though, were delicious. Not quite shoestring, but skinny enough.

As famished as I was, I ordered the caesar salad, short rib benedict, and a side of the truffle tater tots. 

Caesar salad was okay - lacked the spiciness that I think Caesars need to be considered superb. 

Short rib benedict was recommended by the waitress when I couldn't make a decision between two entrees (fyi, i always love to ask the waitstaff what they like)...i wasn't really disappointed but I felt that the sauce created for the short rib could have a little bit of sweetness to it. Maybe it's because when I think of short rib, I think of the Korean version (galbi), but something was definitely missing and it fell short of culinary excellence. The meat itself was moist and succulent and my eggs were poached perfectly, but overall, the dish lacked a certain je ne sais quoi. Also, in addition to the potato base, I think I would've like the addition of some sort of bread.

My favorite part of the meal was the truffle tater tots! I absolutely love love love truffle flavored anything and the tater tots had a healthy dose of truffle fried right into them. Lila H. thought that it was too truffly, but I absolutely loved it. The truffle flavor was so aromatic that I could smell and taste it simultaneously with every bite and the tater tots were fried to a perfect crispity crunch."}
{"text":"The Henry is my go to spot after hiking Camelback Mountain. The coffee, pastries and cold pressed juices are so delicious! They also serve awesome breakfast. Anytime in around the Henry I'll usually stop by for at least a coffee"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our brunch at The Henry. You will need reservations as the restaurant was full at 10:30am on a Sunday morning. I liked the menu variety and the fresh food offered. Bloody Mary cart is a must!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 3 1/2 stars, I would. The reason? The service wasn't that great and the food was alright. During Happy Hour, we had a cheeseburger, whipped cheddar dip with ciabatta bread, and short rib tacos. The cheeseburger was really good, the dip was unique, and the tacos weren't that great. The real star of the evening? The fig and ginger mule!

We'll have to give this place another try again. Hopefully service will be better next time.

*Why the service wasn't that great: I ordered a cocktail with my meal and after almost 20 minutes, I had to ask our waiter about it and only then was it brought to our table after an additional 5 minutes or so. We also had originally ordered truffle fries to go along with our meal. Everything else we ordered came along so we started eating and we kept waiting and waiting for the fries. Our waiter was nowhere to be found. I had to actively go and find our waiter to let him know our fries were never brought out and, at this point, to just remove them from the tab and to please bring the check. We noticed every table around us was being serviced regularly throughout their meals but not our table. Chelsea, thank you for reaching out to me about this."}
{"text":"Like many of the other reviews the food was mediocre. We ordered the salmon on top of quinoa and roasted chicken with creamed corn and kale and apple slaw. The salmon and chicken were dry. The parmesan truffle fries appetizer was the best part of the meal.

Upon arrival we waited about an hour for our table. Our waitress was very short with us, but the manager was very professional and kind. 

The stars goes to the actual building. No doubt, the restaurant looks very nice outside and in. There was plenty of parking. And indoor and outdoor dining."}
{"text":"Food was ok and serving sizes were good.  $5 for a cup of coffee is exhorbinant - not talking cafe au lait or anything - just plain coffee.  Waiter was slow to show up.  We waited nearly 10 minutes after being seated and then nearly another 10 before coffee showed up.

Another observation - the restaurant is \"open air\",  within the casino proper.  Whatever sweet smelling air freshener scent that they pump through the casino it's awful - our eyes were burning and I was sneezing and sniffling within 10 minutes of entering the Cosmopolitan.  Asthmatics beware."}
{"text":"Visited this location on 4/17/17 for brunch 

When I was doing research for places to eat, The Henry caught my attention with their short rib Benedict. 

Made reservations for The Henry for 11:30 and we were seated in 2 minutes. Thankfully I made the reservation because I didn't realize how small this restaurant is. 

My boyfriend and I both ordered the short rib Benedict and our server, I think her name was Sarah, was very sweet and attentive. Our food arrived shortly, the meat and eggs were so delicious and soft. The only thing I didn't love was the hash underneath. It was okay but I wasn't a fan. 

I'll still come back for the short rib Benedict though! 

Short rib Benedict $19
Soda $5
Cappuccino $5"}
{"text":"The service was wonderful! The food however, was mediocre at best.. the mimosas where $15 each and for my husband and I we paid $100 and I left feeling severely ripped off. I was so disappointed, I won't go back, it's not worth the price at all!"}
{"text":"Ok....went here yesterday for a birthday celebration with party of eight. Asked for waters for all...two people were brought water. Finally, all of us received water, after asking once again.  I ordered Cab Sauvignon wine and was poured a white wine...which I refused. My husband ordered a second can of Hef beer (they only have four beers on tap - the rest is canned or bottled)...when he ordered a second, he showed the server his can and she SNARKELY said \"Sir, I KNOW what you ordered.\" My husband and I exchanged glances. 

When the bill came, I grabbed the calculator on my phone....and figured out what my husband and I owed....then added up what everyone else put on the table so that we could leave our server a 20-25% tip. It added up. Then a SECOND person at our table added everything up...came out the same. When all was paid, the server was sent BACK to our table because her manager said we didn't leave enough money to cover the bill and leave a tip!  The manager then came over to speak with us.  HOW, when TWO separate people added everything up prior to giving our money to the server, we agreed  that there was enough to cover the bill AND leave a nice tip????  I have NEVER HAD THIS HAPPEN TO ME.  We have two daughters in the food industry and KNOW the importance of leaving a generous tip.

My husband and I frequent the Fox Restaurants often as we support local. HOWEVER.... After this experience it is doubtful that we will eat at another Fox Restaurant for a long time.....there are other locally-owned places to spend our time and money....LGO and Chelsey's Kitchen, Upward Foundation's Postino, Federal Pizza, JoyHouse Taco, and Windsor, Oregano's, Bianco Pizza, Cibo, etc., where our money, and our friend's and coworker's money can be spent and we won't have this kind of treatment. 

SHAME ON THE HENRY STAFF.... This was not a good ending to an enjoyable night out with friends. I LOVED the decor and feel of this restaurant, however it was so loud that we had to shout across the table to talk.... the service was so-so.... the food was GREAT!"}
{"text":"Wow Henry, you never cease to impress me with your consistent quality and amazing taste. While everything else (especially the rooms) in Cosmo has been quickly deteriorating around you, you still continue to maintain the same incredible service and food since the beginning of time, like an untainted blossoming lotus amidst a spoiling pond. Congrats and keep up the fabulous work. I will no longer be staying at Cosmo because I refuse to walk on the soiled carpet that stink of puke, because of the bath towels with strangers' lipstick prints left in my clean room, but no worries as I will go out of my way to pay you a visit everytime I'm in town ."}
{"text":"I think I've dined at half of the places in the Cosmopolitan but this is one of the places I haven't been to and so I said why not?  I came here twice and decided that I would order the same thing on both days.  I know I'm adventurous.  Anyway since I was on a business trip I decided I would eat some greens since I normally don't and so I ordered the grilled chicken salad which came with tomatoes, cucumbers and walnuts.  I didn't even realize this the first time but apparently the chicken was cold, ice cold.  Anyway I was short on time so I didn't ask for the chicken to be heated up.  The Henry feels more like a cafe, maybe a nicer hotel cafe with a fancier name and the prices are Vegas prices but as I said it's Vegas and it's in the Cosmopolitan.  I wouldn't mind coming back since it's close to the entrance and it's a comfortable setting.  I'm giving it three stars because I wasn't wowed by the place or anything."}
{"text":"Overall it was okay. We went here with our two teenagers. 

The braised beef was good and tasty, melts in your mouth. The salmon was cooked right, but the rest on the plate was  boring.

We were disappointed that 3 items out of the advertised restaurant week menu was no longer available as early as 8:30pm. No more crab cakes, no more pudding and choco lava cake.They made an effort to add yogurt panna cotta, but it was not good. Same thing for the strawberry cake, cake was dry drizzled with syrup that was very sweet then topped with maybe 3 strawberry slices.

Table next to us didn't even finish half of the choco lava cake,  which made me wonder if it was any good."}
{"text":"Fox Restaurant Concepts has done it again. This is another amazing restaurant with the same great service and good food you expect from a Fox Restaurant.  The servers are very friendly and always have good suggestions.  I would recommend anyone to try there hand made sodas and the kale dip."}
{"text":"We came to The Henry after being dumbfounded at how busy their upstairs restaurant was (The Egg Slut). We only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table-pretty quick for a busy hotel! 

The food was delicious! All of the plates we ordered were definitely big enough to be shared between two people! I recommend the french toast but the pancakes were delicious too! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had the salmon which was the best ever. Carlos had the black cod which was amazing. This is a great place . You must go!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals in Vegas yet! Burger and Wedgie salad YUM!"}
{"text":"Visited on a Tuesday just after 8, there was a short wait for the patio, and we're seated at a small table in the corner. 

The initial greeting of the table took a bit longer than it should have, but the cocktails were worth the wait. We started with the popovers which were so flaky, light, and delicious. The ham butter was phenomenal. We tried the roasted chicken and the short ribs which were both such great choices. So much flavor, and the sides fit both dishes so well. 

Our server Chelsea was SO helpful in picking dishes, and had a genuinely helpful attitude. The dinner was paced out so nicely, and made the experience even better. 

The Henry definitely has everything to keep me coming back for more! Great decor, wonderful menu, good music, delicious food, and fabulous details like their antique looking martini glasses and beautiful silverware"}
{"text":"Atmosphere...vibe..food...and especially the drinks all great. I had the steak and it was great. This place is 30 mins from my place but I drive down to get the \"upstate gentleman\". Great drink. The value is great for the quality and service here. This is what is call a no brainer it's gotta be in your top 3 or 4 if you live in the area"}
{"text":"Went in for Brunch- while this has been a favorite I was disappointed this morning - 
A friend and I met for brunch - I had the Flower Child scramble and ordered a side of fruit. The scramble was great but the fruit was bland and not worth ordering. We ordered lattes and they took forever - 20 minutes for a latte when we were there at 8 am ?  They need to work on their timing."}
{"text":"Great first time experience. Food was terrific. Mimosas were spot on. Excellent service."}
{"text":"The Henry is not what one would expect.  It's a very relaxed but intimate setting.  Like their sign says, it's a neighborhood restaurant, but provides good food and great service.

Last night we were treated to superior service by Matthew.  It was obvious he enjoyed his job, and made us feel welcome in the restaurant.  He was pleasant, and his tempo of conversation and dinner flow was not contrived or forced, as what we experienced at Lon's at the Hermosa the previous weekend (see review).  Matthew could, and should, give the waitstaff at Lon's a refresher course in hospitality immediately!  

As for the \"libations\",  a term that I love and it's hardly used, were very well made.  My husband ordered the Old Fashioned, which was stiff and well mixed.  He commented on the very dense cherry.  I had a Malbec. What stepped up the service level was that Matthew made sure we were happy with our selections, and if not, would have offered us another choice.

Dinner portions were just right, not too much, but not overwhelmingly gigantic, which I find as a way a restaurant compensates for using sub par ingredients in exchange for large portions.  My roasted chicken dinner was simple but tasty.  The brussel sprouts were nicely cooked, maybe a tad too salty.  My husband's bolognese sauce with home made pasta was very good.

Since it was a birthday celebration, we were treated by the house with a dessert of choice.  The bread pudding was delightful, warm and decadent.

The following day my husband commented again how he enjoyed his experience at The Henry, and especially Matthew's attentive skills.  It really soured our experience at Lon's to another level!

We will be back again, and hopefully get to see Matthew again!  We found out he has been a server for a long time, enjoys walking patrons through the menu and proud of the culinary creations and experimentations that The Henry and FRC provides.  He took the time to chat with us, and sharing tidbits of his life, albeit without a tone of rushing through.

To The Henry, please keep up what you're doing.  So far, this is now our favorite of the FRC options!"}
{"text":"I had a delicious bowl of steel cut oats with fresh berries and honey.  Also they have fresh squeezed OJ and grapefruit juice.  Hostesses and server were very kind and accommodating."}
{"text":"What a great way to recharge in the morning. These bloody Mary's set us right every morning. I loved the Italian! Wow what great flavors. It was sad to learn I didn't love the bacon bloody marry quite as much."}
{"text":"Fabulous brunch spot! It was hard to decide but my girlfriend and I split the gooey caramel roll as an appetizer. Oh my goodness! Layers of flaky pastry and Carmel-y sweetness. Then, I had the California scramble. Yum! She had the power quinoa bowl which was huge. She loved it. We both enjoyed a mimosa as well. Service was great, even on a busy Sunday morning."}
{"text":"Food was great even with a hangover but their French onion soup is exploding with flavor and you should get that !"}
{"text":"I love this place! We tend to stop here after work for happy hour and enjoy their delicious guac and chips along with some delicious cocktails. The service is wonderful and the atmosphere is very cool."}
{"text":"Five star for popovers. Light, airy, served with rounds of regular and herbed butter. Gorgeous interior with Luxe Mag detail, from antique repro seltzer bottles as bathroom soap dispensers, to fresh herbs between rows of butcher block tables.  Five star for an inventive menu. Though not 100% to my personal taste, the Caesar with roasted Brussels sprouts was interesting. I like both, but I discovered that I prefer them separate.  The Caesar salad was anchovy traditional rather than creamy, if you are one to differentiate."}
{"text":"Every time we come to vegas we go here for breakfast . The short rib Benedict is bomb and the country fried steak is unbelievable! 5 stars for sure !"}
{"text":"One interesting restaurant. Looks amazing and that's it. Its all for the looks that you pay the steep price. They look at vegetarians like aliens from another planet. We were still optimistic and tried to alter an order of sandwich similar to grilled cheese. Now we got a look from the waiter that was more like you are wasting a table. That is not acceptable for any time, anywhere. Not going back and will not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I have never had this bad of service in the Phoenix Scottsdale area.  My boyfriend and I came in and waited for a table for over an hour at the bar.  After being sat we received no service for over 20 minutes.  We were not even greeted.  I have been here multiple times and spent hundreds of dollars on food at this restaurant. For this to happen is astonishing.  It is our anniversary now we are hungry and having to find somewhere else to enjoy ourselves."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and I love it. Dope atmosphere. Food and coffee have been delicious. Chicken sausage scramble was incredible. The service has been outstanding. Ron found an issue on our bill and found us before we left to correct it which was awesome. Justin the second time went above and beyond to make sure our meal was perfect and made sure all our specific (and likely annoying ha) requests were granted."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic and the ambiance was very cool. I was there for Saturday brunch so there was live music. I'd love to try their regular menu!"}
{"text":"The best find in Phoenix.  I like what I see in the brunch menu creativity. The ambiance is casual with a hip crowd that is drawn here to meet up with friends for a brunch. I opted for the Turkey Au Jous. It was so delicious! 
I had my pet traveling with me. This place is pet-friendly! I enjoyed a nice meal with my dog on the outdoor patio."}
{"text":"I guess if it's close to 3am at The Cosmpolitan, then The Henry is a decent, easy choice for food. It's unspectacular but it gets the job done plus you can do some late night/early morning people watching. 

I had the French dip sandwich (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Er8DpPwf_lHHv64ncWhD8g?select=CmMrGPKOfzd2f3txCLHh4w) and it was decent except the jus was WAY too salty. It had probably reduced all day yet no one thought to taste it before serving. They are pretty generous with the meat so it's quite a mouthful and the meat was relatively moist so that negated the need to dip the sandwich into the salty jus. Think the highlight was the truffle tater tots. Tater tots are always a winner but drizzle them with some truffle oil and bang! Late night indulgence. 

Service was decent here although our server looked a little swamped. Still he got our food to us quickly and we were on our way quickly following this early morning pit stop. If you don't want to travel too far out of the hotel for food, The Henry is one of your few options late night."}
{"text":"I'd say closer to 3.5 stars.  I've been here at least twice every time I stay at the Cosmo, which has been a fair number of times.  Not bad, not great.  None of the dishes will blow you away, but it's the only real Diner/ breakfast place in the Cosmo.  The service everywhere in the Cosmo is great, but the rating of 3.5 stars is for the food.  For the somewhat limited menu, you'd think the dishes would be phenomenal.  Although, I'll say that their oatmeal is awesome (that is, as good as oatmeal can be).  I've always left my meal somewhat unsatisfied."}
{"text":"Our server Alex, was so hospitable. He gave us great recommendations on what to order and everything was DELICIOUS. We can't wait to return - but hope they open one in San Diego! 
We enjoyed the Grilled Shrimp, New York, and heavenly bread pudding.
Thank you for making our last night in Scottsdale so memorable. 
Best, Haley"}
{"text":"Food wasnt bad and the coffee selection and taste is good, i just wish the customers didnt act so stuck up and rude especially the elderly ladies. Will be coming back just maybe next till ill order to go."}
{"text":"My girl friends and I came here last night for dinner to celebrate my bachelorette party. The food was amazing. The service was great. The atmosphere of the restaurant was very relaxing. We will definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"Loved the decor of the restaurant and the service was excellent. I only had the spinach salad but it was delicious. It was my first time here and I would come back"}
{"text":"OK... I don't have anything good to talk about this place. The only good about this place is that it is open 24 hours. 
The food they served is not good at all. I went here for two nights and tried the Henry burger, which was tasteless and the second night I had chicken fingers which was garbage. You could find better quality at a Burger King for a fraction of the price we paid here."}
{"text":"When on vaca I'm all for indulgence & here at the Henry they have the best idea but it just didn't come into fruition for me.  Deep friend mac & beer cheese. Sounds good right? Just the ultimate in decadence. Alas it was ultimately disappointing. Just lacking in flavor all the way around it.  The Henry redeemed themselves in an traditional & delish way. The Reuben minus the 1,000 island & it was good as it gets for this traditional sandwich. The truffle tots while good as tots but should re-think the truffle of it all. I couldn't taste the truffle oil at all. I had to take one for the team & just try them all to make sure I wasn't missing it in one. Great tots! The espresso martini, Reuben & tots I will return for shnizzle. So good! See you next time Henry. XXOO"}
{"text":"Quality of food was solid but not amazing. No pancakes was a bummer. It was just right for brunch. Short ribs Benedict and salmon Benedict were both good."}
{"text":"Not forthcoming about certain items being freshly made vs frozen.  We had to pry the truth out of the server after the food came and it was obvious the item was frozen before.  In addition, the server prided the restaurant on making everything fresh from all fresh ingredients, however, out came the powdered eggs. I dislike when serves give false information.  I've never been a server, but I have friends who are and take pride in knowing and being transparent about their restaurants menu.  The hotel is amazing, but The Henry was a big disappointment!"}
{"text":"After an afternoon of house hunting In Paradise Valley and Arcadia we decided to check this place out as all the realtors in the area recommended it. We saw 6 houses and every realtor sent us here so we can get the vibe of the neighborhood.

We came in around 4:30 ish and they were in between menus. As we weren't starved this was a perfect time for us to try an appetizer and split a sandwich. We decided to start with the Kale/truffle dip with pita slices and the flatbread. It was truly delicious and really filling. After nibbling on a few slices we started getting full. The dip came hot and every morsel was delicious. It was literally melt in your mouth stuff. If it was possible I wanted to take an order of this home and just have it as an emergency snack. Yes it was that good.

About 15 minutes later our Turkey sandwich with dipping sauce came out with a nice salad. It was nice they split it in half and plated it for us with no extra cost. The sandwich just hit the spot for our appetites. Even though I didn't use the dipping sauce (came out nice and hot by the way) it was very light tasting. The sandwich was fine the way it was, simple and full of flavor. What was also good was that the side salad that we opted for wasn't heavily coated in salad dressing. It was just nicely done. It too was light tasting. I know I used this word twice in this review but after a day of house hunting, we looked forward to food that didn't drag us down or put us into a carb coma.

The whole experience was great. Nice neighborhood feeling of hipsters, families and retirees, great atmosphere (you can hear yourself talk), decorated beautifully and clean.

I can understand why everyone recommends this place.

Can't wait for our next visit to try something on the dinner menu and to hang out at their coffee shop."}
{"text":"This place is great after a night of partying in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. A bit pricey for my taste (since I can get much for food in chinatown for the same price), but still really good if the \"partying munchies\" are calling you.

I had the Reuben and truffle tots... and let me tell you... these tots are RIDICULOUS! I love tots... and this is where I first found truffle tots (the second one was TastyBunz... please see my review on that too!).

The first bite of those tots was like as if an orchestra was playing \"alleluia\" in the background. I can't have tots now... unless they are truffle tots. Also, I am a HUGE reuben fan.... and this was awesome. The bread is not soaked in oil. It isnt healthy, but it doesnt give you super oily fingers either. 

If you go during a weekend, be prepared to wait a bit"}
{"text":"The carrot cake pancakes with whipped  cream cheese topping is a wonderful and unique treat!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place for my sister's graduation brunch. My Mom ordered their Carrot Cake Pancakes, I ordered the Caramel Apple French Toast, my sister ordered something from the dinner menu as well as the Smoked Norwegian
Salmon. Everything looking amazing, it wasn't until I started eating that I started feeling funny. I'm allergic to nuts, so I came to the conclusion that something from another dish must have gotten into mine. I told the waitress about it and she offered to take the french toast off the bill. 

I'm still giving this place 4 stars because my mom and sister both said it was the best food they have had in a while - but if you have allergies just make sure you inform your waiter or you may have the same issue."}
{"text":"Good service & unique menu. Worth checking it out. The appetizers were all great. I would probably get something other than the sea bass next time."}
{"text":"After semi-retiring from clubbing, my boyfriend and I now plan our Vegas trips around our meals and we have been huge fans of all the restaurants we tried at the Cosmo. Glad to add The Henry to the list. 

During my first visit, I was hesitant to try this place out. I was fixated on getting Egg Slut but the line there was unbearable for morning hungers so the bf convinced me otherwise. I had the croissant bacon and cheese sandwich. Thank goodness it was good! The hanger subsided and all was good again. I got a taste of the short ribs benedict which was a little rich for my breakfast liking but it has layers of deliciousness from the savory ribs to the runny poached eggs. The side of truffle tater tots was OMG YUM ! 

Came for the second time last weekend. And the experience was better than the last. 
Our server Larry was attentive and has an unique radio jockey voice. He also never failed to let us know his name was Larry. 

Croissant wasn't on the menu so I opted for the HENRY BURGER. THIS IS EVERYTHING!! Everything I've been looking for in a perfect burger. First off, it was so beautifully constructed. The ingredients were simple: bacon, onion, cheese, tomato, butter lettuce with a side of pickle and placed in the right order. Nothing like the Google emoji. The brioche sesame bun was lightly toasted and perfectly round. The half inch patty was a perfect medium and juicy. I had zero guilt finishing it all by myself. Larry thought I would like a side of fruit to go with the burger but nah dude. I'm here for the truffle tater tots. Mmmmm.... Also, the brioche French toast was glorious. The berries were fresh. It tasted just as good as it looked. Portion size were huge. 

The Henry may not be the most popular tourist hotspot at the Cosmo but it is totally worth a visit. And don't forget those Identity points."}
{"text":"Solid spot for breakfast/brunch. Good service, smack dab in the middle of the casino. Get the avocado toast with salmon and pass on the wagyu beef salad."}
{"text":"Had a great brunch experience! Fast service, great food (had breakfast burrito with avocado added and to die for truffle tots). Reasonable price for strip"}
{"text":"So... They stop serving breakfast at 10. Sharp! They start lunch at 11. So basically, if you're out driving around and want something to eat at 10:03, you're out of luck here... No questions asked. How do I know? I tried asking if they'd be willing to serve a group of 4 of us that walked in at 10:03 and was met with that cold Scottsdale stare. You know the one I'm talking about. The one that proclaims if you want it your way, go to burger King. Fox is getting too big to keep tight controls on quality of service, and that my friends is sad because I used to love most of his establishments."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here for dinner on our Anniversary.  We were seated immediately although the table for two was anything but private located right in the front of the restaurant and between two other occupied tables when there were plenty of open tables.  The menu offered many choices.  The restaurant was quite elegant for diner type food.  I ordered the signature meatloaf with whipped potatoes and peas with bacon.  From my first bite to my last the flavor of the meal was amazing! The potatoes were whipped, fluffy and delicious.  My husband ordered the Ragu Bolognese, which was a huge portion and looked equally delicious.  We both cleaned our plates and left feeling full and satisfied. I would definitely return for another meal here!"}
{"text":"Came here after a late night out at Omnia. The line at Secret Pizza was waaay too long for us tired and hangry people so we went downstairs to the Henry. Just a note for all you people coming back from clubbing - you need to wear shoes before you enter the restaurant. Our friend found this out the hard way and they wouldn't let her sit down until she had them on. 

It's not the cheapest place but honestly for food at late night I'm fine with that. If you come at this time you HAVE HAVE to get the TATER TOT NACHOS. There's no chips with this but it's layers of crispy tots, sour cream, brisket, tomatoes and cheese. SO good and perfect for 3 am. 

We also got the:
Omelet - which was super fluffy and yellow. Yum.  
French Onion Soup - Can't compare to places like Mon Gam Bi but tasty nonetheless.
French Toast - the syrup that comes with it is really good!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place 2 stars only because of the waiter my husband and I went there for late burgers and they had dancers in the casino near us which was nice the waiter very professional but sad to say the burgers hmm lack of salt and to me that is no Bueno but we ate anyway because we were hungry but I still can't forget the lack of salt ........"}
{"text":"Came for a late-night bite and had the steak and eggs. All our food was great but the service was less than pleasant, especially after several mistakes. Instead of apologizing and fixing it, excuse after excuse was made. I'll still come back for the food because it's great!"}
{"text":"Finally! A fox-con that lives up to the hype.

My girlfriend and I came here new year's eve before making our way to a party later in the evening. The Henry is spacious and its classy interior is eclectic without being whimsical.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable and didn't hesitate to recommend only the most expensive items on the menu. So I wouldn't recommend just saying yes to whatever they recommend to drink or you might end up with a $200 bottle of sparkling rose. 

Everything we tried on the limited New Year's Menu was fantastic.  The Cheese popover with the ham butter was unique. I would highly recommend the short rib. It's a true short rib in a delicious bourbon sauce that you can cut with your fork. Try the cauliflower polenta too. It was bright and buttery. 

This place is going to be a mainstay of the area and perhaps the most successful of the Fox concepts in the city."}
{"text":"The Henry is a very chic and relaxing place to visit, if you wanna get out of the old town bar scene. 
I loved and enjoyed the service from our waiter and hostess. He recommended wonderful drinks for us to try. 
The food was okay not breathtaking for me. I had the Heirloom Quinoa Tacos with steak and they were dry and in need of some flavor or spice. I see others loved them but they weren't my favorite. For dessert, we had the strawberry cake and that was very delicious. The vanilla basil ice cream and strawberry jam was a nice combination. 
Overall I'll go again and probably try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. Cool music playing (not too loud). Had a nice time. Like that there isn't valet parking."}
{"text":"$18 for a breakfast plate?!?  $15 each for mimosas?!?  No.  My boyfriend and I split a plate so that we could spend a normal $9 each for a good breakfast.  To be fair, the cuts of ham were fairly thick, but the breakfast was just okay for the $$$$ it cost.  

My mimosa was very heavy on the orange juice.  Not okay if it's going to be $15.  I better get a goblet of mimosas (or, preferably, bottomless) for that price."}
{"text":"The food, atmosphere, and service is amazing!  Kelly is the best (manager)!  We met family & friends for brunch and had a great time.  I will be returning to try the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Sad, sad experience and now my least favorite Fox restaurant. Visited the Henry for the first time this past Friday for happy hour and dinner. Happy hour here is only for draft and well drinks, so we didn't benefit from it food-wise. We were greeted by a timid, shaky waiter on the patio and ordered the truffle fries (Applebee's-quality) short rib/s and pork chop. The short rib/s were quite small and lack-luster for the price (the similar dishes at North and Chelsea's just down the street could knock this tiny nightmare entree out). Pork chop was gigantic, but let's be honest- my mom makes better and it doesn't cost me $20+. 

At the end of the meal, I felt horrible paying $92 for 3 \"happy hour\" priced drinks, a fry appetizer and 2 entrees. HUH?!"}
{"text":"One of the best meals I've had in quite some time. Every detail from the moment we walked in the door to our very last bite was exceptional. The ambience is like you're in a super chic yet comfortable living room and makes you feel right at home. Our server Alex went above and beyond to take care of my mom and me for our dinner. He was so knowledgeable, made great suggestions and was on top of everything at every step of the way. We have very restrictive diets but he was able to accommodate all our needs and the food was still INCREDIBLE. We started with the grilled and chilled shrimp which was a perfect light and delicious start to our meal. For entrees we shared the Chilean sea bass (omg) and the NY strip which was worth every penny- perfectly cooked and seasoned. Can't remember the last time I had a steak that good. Not a morsel was left of anything. They even specially prepared their squash to meet our needs. We were so well taken care of and left with such a wonderful memory of a meal. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Of course, designed in the same manner and decadence of the Cosmopolitan hotel, there's a tiny retreat nestled in the corner where you can forget you're inside a casino.

I really like the space.  Couches everywhere, leather, a swanky little bar, and a stellar staff.

Not only did the hostess address me by name, but when I left, she remembered my name.  After only like 2 interactions.  I thought it was a nice gesture.

My server, very friendly and eager to please....  

And my food was wicked delicious. I had the eggs benedict.  My only complain is that price is a little high, I only got the two muffins, canadian peameal (hard to find in an american restaurant) eggs and a thick and rich hollandaise sauce drowning out the meal...  but that was it.  no side potatoes or whatever...  and it was about 16 bucks. it does include caviar but I am not a fan.... I had the dish sans caviar.

Pair that with freshly squeezed orange juice ($5) and you spend about $25 with tip and tax.  It felt a little steep for me, and I left hungry still.

Nonetheless, the food was spectacular, and the ambiance pretty swanky.  I liked it and hope to return to try other dishes."}
{"text":"It's convenient if you're in the Cosmo.
Prices are a bit steep, but it is Vegas. 
Our favorite is the breakfast burrito. We ate that every day. So. Delicious!
Friendly service.
Nice ambiance.
If you're in the Cosmo or staying there, it's a good place to eat."}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. I moved from Chicago last December (where i appreciate good food). There food is absolutely the best. My favorite meal is the Braised Short Rib that has bourbon caramel, roasted mushrooms, fourme dambert & smashed potatoes!!! I'm telling you ...you have to go. If you are in the downtown area you should try one of their sister restaurants....The Arrogant Butcher!"}
{"text":"I eat here as often as I can, the dinners are super, the wine is good, the servers rock, the brunch is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I have been a regular at the Henry for a couple of months now and each and every time the service is spectacular. The servers are attentive but not badgering at all. The food is always reliably amazing and the atmosphere is to die for. I love going there for happy hour because their deals are spectacular and the other restaurant goers are never rowdy and bring a special experience to the restaurant. The business of the place allows you to be in your own world but also allows a great place to people watch. The coffee bar is also ideal for doing homework or having meetings. The food is so delicious and being a vegetarian it can be difficult at times to find tasty food. The staff is always accommodating."}
{"text":"Went to the Henry for breakfast and we very much enjoyed it. The braided rib Benedict was great. Also had a virgin Bloody Mary that was probably one of the best I've ever had! Great service. I'd definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Awful, had traditional Eggs Benedict, eggs were raw, $17 and nothing else on the plate. Total rip off, stay away."}
{"text":"Went to this bar last time I was in Vegas with a few friends. We were meeting up with someone my friend knew so it was in a good location and had a nice atmosphere. I wasn't that hungry , but I ordered a Caesar salad that was good.

Five stars mostly because the bartender made THE BEST cosmopolitan I've ever had in my life. Not surprising given the location (in the Cosmopolitan) buuut it's worth mentioning and every time in town I'm coming for the cosmos."}
{"text":"Located on the first floor of the Cosmopolitan, The Henry is a more upscale dining option. They serve breakfast and dinner, but we just stuck to breakfast. 

Per my fellow Yelpers, I had the Shortrib Benedict. Ahhh I don't know about this one.... the braised shortrib was sooo tender and the egg was perfectly poached. However, I was not too crazy about the homemade hash brown. Instead of the crispy kind that you think of from a diner, mine were small little patties that were tough and chewy... not sure what they put in it. This replaced the English muffins FYI. But sigh, that's what brought this down a star. So disappointed. 

I didn't get to try any of my fam's meals, but they had the omelette and the breakfast plate. They seemed to enjoy it, so maybe I ordered the wrong thing? 

Service was great - our server made sure our glasses were full of water and our mugs filled with coffee. 
Overall, if I stayed here, I might try to go back. Otherwise I'm not sure if I'd be back. 

Cheers to brunch, may you have a better experience than I did!"}
{"text":"I keep promising myself I'll order something different but I keep coming back craving the kale salad. My son keeps coming back craving the caramel apple French toast. Every time we cave to our cravings that only The Henry can satisfy."}
{"text":"Lovely brunch spot with a great atmosphere. I ordered the quinoa breakfast burrito and my boyfriend initially ordered chicken fried chicken, however they ran out so he ordered the all American burger medium rare. My burrito came out fine and his burger came out medium well which was a little disappointing. It took a while to get seated and to receive our food, but the waitress apologized and took one of our beers off our bill."}
{"text":"Upon arrival, the Hostess was stuck up and rude. I will say the waiter was pretty good. The menu has some unique selections. I did enjoy the meal and the wine. I would like to see a little more selection on the dinner menu.  I probably would not go here again."}
{"text":"The prime sandwich had a perfectly cooked steak shingled with mushrooms and greens. I enjoyed the sliced steak opposed to a large slab of meat that requires I tear the meat with each bite. The slices steak was a small sign of thoughtful dish execution and a upscale experience. I chose the slaw as my side and it provided well dressed fresh crunchy veggies.  Overall the price point for the dishes were slightly higher than I expected but fit provided the environment. This industrial rustic location has a relaxed upscale chill atmosphere. A hodgepodge of vintage couches, chairs and tables provide plenty of seats for walk in customers.  
A great place for a date with that special someone."}
{"text":"Solid service in a nice atmosphere with a short wait for breakfast. I had the breakfast burrito per the server's recommendation and I can safely say it was a solid burrito, nothing too heavy, but nothing too unique about it as well. The table ordered the corned beef hash (which was phenomenal, the person who ordered it was in a true food-trance the entire dining experience and loved the balance the hollandaise brought to the dish), the smoked salmon plate (which was good but not particularly note-worthy), and the Cinnamon Roll French Toast, which was a nice balance of sweet and satiating. 

Essentially this is a solid place to start off the day. The drinks looked amazing, however we veered away from them just so we could pace ourselves (the French Kiss seemed very popular while there)!"}
{"text":"The Henry is a great go-to spot for breakfast while @Cosmopolitan... Friendly staff, variety, and decent appointments (comfy chairs and booths). 

Definitely 4 stars fresh..."}
{"text":"Best breakfast on the strip! The wait times in the morning can be long but the food is well worth the wait. The short rib benedict will forever change your views of breakfast. Great service, very prompt. The Henry gets 5 stars."}
{"text":"My wife and I have eaten recently at The Henry--twice! Once for lunch and once for breakfast. It's near where we live and we plan to become regulars there. 

The food is creative and delicious, the service is just superb, and the facility is a wonderful blend of the casual and the classic. It just feels good to be there in an unhurried, pleasant atmosphere. The wait service team is just superb. They all pay close attention to what's happening at the tables. There was no time when the staff didn't seem focused and hands-on in making sure guests  had what they needed, when they needed it. 

The XV Cafe opens early daily for casual breakfast, and it's outstanding. Along with a regular breakfast there this morning, my wife added a chocolate croissant at the end and I had their almond joy/raspberry brownie. Both pastries were impressive to the eye and our tastebuds. 

If you haven't been to The Henry, just go and see for yourselves. You may decide to become a regular, too."}
{"text":"Great French Onion soup: right amount of everything! Aromatic organic tea with kettle which keeps the water really hot and suitable for brewing throughout the whole meal. Open 24 hrs, right across hip lounge where you can continue after a tasty late night meal."}
{"text":"Decided to see what the hype was about for my birthday!!!!! The Henry has earned every ounce of praise that it has received! 

The guacamole is amazing!!!!! From the crafted cocktails, the wine menu, flavorful salads and amazing salmon dish I am a fan!!!!!

The outside seating next to the fireplace is so relaxing and boasts of the ambiance that the Henry has to offer! The open kitchen is really neat and it hosts a separate bar on the side of you just want to come in and enjoy a cocktail and watch the game. 

We had all ages from 17-75 and everyone loved the experience, the food and the drinks! 

Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went to The Henry last night for the first time with my daughter and friend from back east. Great atmosphere, service,food and drinks. The patrons ranged from a Mom and young son to singles, younger and older couples. Very inviting for all! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this spot! Only reason I knocked off a star is because the service was super slow. 

This place is massive! The patio is darling and the decor is unique & old school chic. 

Came here for brunch and sat outside. The food was great. Had the 2 egg breakfast, severed with delicious homemade apricot jam for the toast. The breakfast potatoes were so perfectly seasoned and cooked. The caramel roll is a MUST... It's simply perfection. The brûlée grapefruit is excellent: juicy sweet tart goodness.      Yummy Bloody Mary. Tasty iced coffee.

The price is right. The location is right. 
Cannot WAIT to come back for more!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to grab some lunch and burgers have been on the menu for the last 2 days  (seriously...how many burger joints does Vegas need?). I ordered the lemon and herb chicken which was delicious!!! Decent plate for the price of the plate and the staff was nice and informative (waitress informed me the chicken would be about 15-20min)
Price is a little up there but it's Vegas and everything is more expensive. All in all, a nice experience and I'd eat here again!"}
{"text":"After a long painful night of walking around in heels henrys was the closest place to grab a bite. The food was good but not amazing for me to remember. Our waiter, although very tentative to us, kept forgetting to bring me my hot tea after having to ask 3 different times. They weren't busy so I couldn't really understand the hold up. I did like how it was close to one if the bars where they played throw back music of the 80s an top 40s of the 90s."}
{"text":"Ok. So I actually have to WORK at toning down my excitement about this place. Came upon it by accident today for breakfast, thinking it was a different place I had visited just across the street. Decided to give it a try anyway since I'm always down for a new experience and...

... ... WOW. Could NOT have been more pleased. The decor, style, and ambiance of this place is right in line with other Fox Concepts, which means that it toes that fine line between quirky and elegant without being overbearing. You feel at once at-home and enchanted.

The Henry was busy when I visited it today (a Saturday) at around 10:30am. In fact, there would have been a 20-30 minute wait for the dining room had I not decided to sit at the bar. Fortunately, the bar and lounge areas are full service, so it worked out very well.

Everything about this place is simply wonderful. The food menu is diverse with notably healthy options. It's clear that a lot of thought went into their food. VERY fair prices, too, considering the portion sizes and mouth-watering combinations. I ordered the Quinoa Breakfast Burrito and savored every bite.

The drink menu is also pleasantly diverse including everything from craft brewed coffee, to special house coffee drinks to truly upscale alcohol offerings. I tend to prefer out-of-the-way single malt scotches and The Henry had it all! I'll definitely be coming back here for a good scotch!

The building is open concept, but it still segments nicely between dining room, bar, coffee bar, and cafe. There's plenty of seating both indoors and on the outside patio, so even when it's busy (like today), it's easy to find a spot and camp out for a while with your laptop if you're into that sort of thing.

Service was outstanding across the board despite the large number of visitors, and everything I ate/drank was phenomenal. I will absolutely be back, and it will absolutely be to introduce new friends to the place. I highly recommend this.

If you haven't been yet - GO! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Been to the Henry twice now, once for dinner and just this past weekend for brunch.  I've gotta say, I really love this restaurant.  From the decor to the menu I think everything is spot on.  Service has always been friendly and consistent, while also helpful.  A+ for this Fox Restaurant!

It's been awhile since we had dinner here, but I can remember everyone in our large party was satisfied with their meal.  We were celebrating a birthday and the restaurant helped make that special.  This place is quite \"open\" so it was kind of loud, but really the atmosphere makes up for that.  For brunch, I had the egg sandwich, which was delicious... just like the one I like and Olive and Ivy.  The Hubs had the chicken fried biscuit thing and man oh man was that good.  Loved that it was heavy, but light... you don't feel like a fatty after eating it, which is nice.  We also shared a caramel bun and each had the fresh squeezed lemonade.  Both were so good... I could eat/drink both every day of the week.

For sure, hit up the Henry.  You won't be disappointed, but get a reservation... this place seems to be always busy!  Oh and the coffee place that is attached looks awesome, gotta try that!"}
{"text":"Hello peeps ... last night was another great tasting event ! This time at The Henry!!! Fox sure does do it right from decor to atmosphere , service to great food presentation ,and above all popping great flavors busting on the palate.
As usual grab your peeps , dates, and friends and give it a try. For the four of us with cocktails and dessert it was around 250 ! casual nice dress . If you go let me know what you think and as usual enjoy!
Be on the look out for my next outing ."}
{"text":"Really great timely service. I ordered huevos rancheros it was delicious. The pancakes are also yummy. Highly recommend at least for breakfast."}
{"text":"I thought 24/hr open automatically means not quality. But I was pleasantly surprised. Everything we had for breakfast was top notch! Better than most breakfast places I usually eat at (including brunch). 

Breakfast burrito is amazing! 
French toast amazing!
Pancakes amazing! 
Benedict amazing!!"}
{"text":"Come here for breakfast an ideal place to just hang around.

Great atmosphere, good coffee drinks, good food in general. The kind of place you could spend a while in getting things done or hanging out. Portions are a bit small is the only negative."}
{"text":"Everything was good. Portions are huge! Share a plate. The brioche French toast was mouth watering delicious."}
{"text":"Slow and poor service: Never got to eat. We had brunch reservations for a group of 30 and they thought it was for 20. We waited 25 minutes for them to bring extra chairs to our table. Finally, we went and grabbed three chairs from other tables. After being at the table for an hour, our order still had not been taken, and my wife and I had to leave to checkout. Not sure how it went for the rest of our party."}
{"text":"Such a legitimately cool concept. 

Came here lastnight to check this spot out, hangout, and maybe try the coffee. Totally worth it. It's ultra-loungy, super chic & very diverse. I love the living-room style setup with the couches and chairs. Great place to study, relax, have dinner, or stop in for a martini. 

I ordered the avocado toast and a vanilla latte. The latte was pretty average (eh), on the other hand, the toast was phenomenal."}
{"text":"Birthday brunch for my son...everything was amazing..truffle fries are amazing. Everyone had different breakfast dishes and we all loved it..ate so quick we forgot to take pics...Angela was amazing at tending to all our needs."}
{"text":"After clubbing at Marquee, we came down to the Henry to eat. Food is pricey expensive as expected. We got the: 

* Build Your Own Omelette  with toast & Henry's breakfast potato - $16: We got it with slab bacon, mushroom & monterey jack cheese. They didn't give us our slab bacon. We asked the server and he quickly and kindly offered to either bring it back to the kitchen or give it to us on the side. To save time, we just said on the side was fine. He brought out a little cup (which was a lot!) but it was unfortunately cold. Yuck. 
the Henry's breakfast potato was DEELLISSHHH! :) It's like a little pancake of yumminess. 

*Side of Truffle Oil Tater Tots: Ehh, I don't get the hype. I can get  a huge basket at The Rock Bar in PH for MUCH cheaper. 

It's a nice place to dine late night but if you're looking realll messed up, I suggest you go somewhere with a more casual atmosphere.

Menu for your convenience: http://www.cosmopolitanlasvegas.com/pdf/menu/TheHenryUpdatedMenu.pdf"}
{"text":"The food was awesome! I was a little under dressed, but if you do a business casual you will blend in. There was an hour wait, but they offered us outside seating right away. It was chilly, but they have heat lamps so it was perfect.

We ordered the duck flatbread and short rib potstickers for appetizers. They both were amazing!  We also had the pumpkin porter(seasonal beer). For our entrees we both got the turkey french dip. It was better than I expected. I got the apple slaw (it was okay),my friend got the mac and cheese (fabulous). The dessert menu has 5 items and all 5 were tempting. We went with the croissant bread pudding and we were not disappointed. I would love to come back and try other items on the menu"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. Spacious and elegant. The braised short ribs are to die for and reserve dessert for their croissant bread pudding is one of the best!"}
{"text":"Interesting set up with a relaxing area to chill and eat, but also a place to eat.  Places can be sectioned off for private rooms at a cost.

The appetizers were good as well, the shrimp and kale / truffle dip were good.  The parmesan fries were very strong, but still good.

The salmon was pretty good, not overcooked and quite tasty.   Good combination with the arugula. 

The bread pudding was warm and served in a hot bowl with some cinnamon ice cream to balance the sweet bread pudding."}
{"text":"This was a few miles walk from the Mandalay Bay, but the food from this place looked good. So we made our trek over here after getting settled in our hotel room.
This place is located at the Cosmopolitan, and sits on the first floor of this resort. When we came here, it was not busy at all. We were seated promptly, and ordered drinks while we perused the menu.
I went with my usual: steak and eggs. The food didn't take long, and it was delicious. Our waiter was a friendly guy, and took care of us well. I asked him about custom drinks, and he gave a good recommendation. Apparently, drinks with cold brew or espresso are not as commonly made as I thought. But this place improvised, and made me a very good drink. Their beer selections are good too!
This was a great option for dinner. And from the looks of it, it would make a great stop for breakfast too."}
{"text":"Love Henry... Every time we come to Vegas and stay at Cosmo we eat at Henry's always looking forward to it... they have fresh orange and grapefood juice you must have especially with your breakfast .... their menu has changed a bit but still amazing. You don't have much items to choice from but everything on their menu is delish"}
{"text":"Walked in for breakfast on a Sunday. We took the bar seats to skip the wait. We started with the cheddar pop overs. They were light and airy with cheddar inside sprinkled with fleur de sel. It came with ham butter and herbed butter. They were ok, not something I would order again. I ordered the chicken fried chicken. I love the way they make this comfort dish because it doesn't give you that \"I pigged out\" feeling. The chicken was tender, not heavily battered. The gravy was light and the biscuits had the right amount of buttery goodness. My husband got the spicy chicken sausage scramble, substituted toast instead of the breakfast potatoes. He enjoyed it. Service was timely, on the expensive side for breakfast but overall a good dining experience."}
{"text":"Great food and moderately priced for Vegas.  The Lemon Herb chicken was amazing and the mashed potatoes were the creamiest I've ever had!  Truly a great meal!"}
{"text":"Great place!  The food and service is outstanding. The menu has some very unique offerings. We were there for lunch so didn't have the opportunity to try the dinner menu. I had the club sandwich and while that sounds very pedestrian it was the best club sandwich I have ever had. And that is saying a lot as it is my favorite sandwich and I have had many.  My wife had the spinach salad, again one of her favorites, which she said was fantastic. Our friends had poke and the \"pig\" sandwich. They both thought their lunch was excellent. We will certainly be back for lunch and dinner. It is very busy. Reservations are a must if you don't want a long wait. Give it a try. I think you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"The overall experience was pretty good but the quality for the price of food was horrible. The food was nothing special. Had the Cobb salad and a chicken buffalo wrap."}
{"text":"Hmm, I would call this place average at best. Now mind it, it doesn't have to be awesome considering it is on the casino floor with high foot traffic. 

As we waited at the hostess stand, an employee came up and said she would be right with us. We proceeded to wait more than five minutes for her to come back, even though the restaurant was almost empty. 

When she did come back, we were seated right next to the casino floor. We asked if we could be moved to a table farther inside the restaurant to escape some of the noise and smoke. She claimed the servers could only service a small area. The tables were at most 10 feet away from each other. Doesn't make sense to me but whatever.

Also, their menu switches over at 11 PM. We arrived right at 11, and the server seemed super confused about what menu we could order from (or if we could order from both). She told us at least three different stories and finally let us order from either the dinner menu or the late night menu.

The food was good, but not great. Nothing terrible though. Good option if you are on the casino floor and in need of a quick bite any time of the day. 

The hash browns were AMAZING though! This is worth a star bump! I don't know how they prepare them, but I finished them before any other part of my meal!"}
{"text":"The Henry ROCKS! Great meal & Great Service. Our bartender Angelina had impeccable timing, humor and suggestions. Loved the experience here."}
{"text":"I've been here half a dozen times when I come to Vegas. Good food and good service. I used to love the cinnamon roll French toast and they served it 24/7 but now they just have regular French toast on the brunch menu. Very disappointed they got rid of that item. I got a soy cappuccino this time and it was very good. Strawberry shortcake pancakes tasted similar to IHOP's fruit pancakes but with a much larger price tag. The fiancé loved his chicken club. We will always come back here for a good meal."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch on 4/11/18 with family. First time there. Parking was a little difficult but once inside was greeted and seated promptly. The menu is a little pricy but the food was great. Of considerable mention was the roasted chicken tortilla soup, hand shaken mixed berry lemonade, bloomsdale spinach salad and the glazed winter squash. Patio table service as friendly and professional. I live on the far west side of Phoenix and would eat there more often if closer to home. Will stop in again when in the area."}
{"text":"Went here with some friends visiting from out of town and everything was great. The service was consistent, the food was great, sufficient and not small portions. Definitely recommend to others!"}
{"text":"The Henry is the NEW place to eat at. My boyfriend and I went on a Wednesday night and it was poppin!! The food was delicious. I would absolutely recommend the grilled & chilled shrimp and the roasted chicken. The service was professional and very fast, even with the high volume in the restaurant. 
The layout is a little interesting with the more casual, low tables, paired with the larger chairs, in the front of the restaurant. (Not my favorite) I was happy we got sat at a cozy booth in the back. 
The hostess stand is easily missed if you have never been and the host does not wear a uniform. We stood for a few minutes, confused on who was supposed to greet us. Other than the short wait in the beginning, the experience at The Henry was great!"}
{"text":"Got the steak. Its not good at all. The steak has too much fat. I asked for medium rare but it is clearly medium. The server was nice though"}
{"text":"Very nice place, great atmosphere, good place for a conversation entrées portions are small $20 - $30"}
{"text":"On the road for my wife's graduation led me to spin the wheel on Yelp to find the perfect celebratory setting. Thanks to local reviews and photos I made the decision to rsvp at the Henry as this place fit the bill for everything I knew she would enjoy:

Great cocktails, homemade desserts, and unique/seasonal entrees all being served from a spot that looks like it came out of a Restoration Hardware catalog!

As we were a bit early for our rsvp, we were open to enjoying some cocktails in the front until our table was ready. This was the only downfall of our experience as I needed to flag down a waitress before we could get any service. Once our orders had finally been taken and arrived, we started to realize that this place was going to meet the expectations we desired. The fig and gin mules are on point as were the brandied cherries in my wife's drink.

On to the entrees! The perks of going out to dine with a family that loves to eat is that we get to sample everyone's dishes. Our selections included: the Mediterranean branzino, wood grilled pork chop with cauliflower polenta, Thai blackened cod, beef short rib, buttered lobster salad, Korean skirt steak, and orders of bread pudding and chocolate,peanut butter, banana cake! 

OH and only the best cheesy popovers you could ever put in your mouth w homemade ham butter. Yes..HAM butter.

We obviously spent a grip but if you're going to do it big then you might as well do it right, and I got some major cred for the night's dinner selection. :)

For a party of 6, this place was impressive the moment you stepped foot in the door. From the open kitchen delivering mouthwatering dishes to the small patisserie on the side, the Henry has something to appeal to a variety of individual tastes."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. Everyone is polite, the food is wonderful, and I love the environment.
I always get the Heirloom Quinoa Tacos, my mother gets the Salmon Salad (however she changes it to chicken due to allergies); the food is ALWAYS fresh and tasty! Not to mention the Bread Pudding Dessert is to die for..

Now that being said.. today there was an employee dusting in the middle of lunch rush. Not only was it very distracting but it was not acceptable for a meal of that price. 

Would i recommend this restaurant? Yes I would."}
{"text":"We had breakfast here before some client meetings, and it was hands-down one of the best meals I have ever had in Vegas. Period. Maybe it was a good day for them... I don't care. If I ever stay at the Cosmopolitan again, I will be eating here more than once.

I tried their take on Eggs Benedict, with perfectly poached eggs resting on beautiful short ribs, which were perched on crispy-creamy-delicious potato cakes. The dish was drizzled with one of the best sauces I have ever eaten. Just thinking about it now makes me want to jet back there for breakfast tomorrow. So good, and at under $20 it was a bargain.

The atmosphere was cool. The only complaint I had was how close the tables are pushed together... I like a little room when I'm eating, and the people next to us were a little too close. Other than that, it was great."}
{"text":"My first time trying the henry for coffee,
Delicious,
Not acidic, smooth creamy 
A great late I ordered the Dropout, so very yummy 
Happy to give the XV at the henry a try for coffee 
I will be back shortly,  this coffee stop is added to my list of favorites up there with Royal coffee and Four till four coffee 
All yummy spots 

Pros: nice menus perfect to get work done,
Cons none I can find"}
{"text":"The henry,

The food was greta at The Henry. I had the kale dip and the quinoa tacos and they were delicious.  I guess the three stars are for the ambiance and host area. The host area is one \"hot mess\" they have no clue what they are doing at all. Its not clear where to go for a reservation or to sit yourself. The hostess was rude in person and on the phone when making the reservation so I'm assuming all of the hostess have attitude. It one instance since it was taking a while I asked the hostess how much longer and she literally and I mean literally snapped at me and told me they were working on it and had to wait, keep in mind it was the first time I asked.  the other star is because of how loud people were being at the bar watching a hockey game. The Henry seems to want to portray that of an upscale restaurant but if you look a little your right you will see tvs at the bar and guys screaming at a game. Are we a high endish/ trendy restaurant or a sports bar please decide and if you guys are sports bar than lower your price and make the menu longer."}
{"text":"This was my third time eating here. Previously, I've been for a casual lunch & a romantic dinner. Today, I enjoyed an awesome brunch with friends! I would highly recommend making a reservation, especially if you're coming on a weekend. It's been extremely busy all three times I've dined. Ours was for 1pm but they were running late so we didn't get seated until 1:20pm. We started with Prairie Breeze Cheddar Popovers & an Everything Bagel with cream cheese. I ordered the 2 Egg Breakfast & I also got to taste the Caramel Apple French Toast & Huevos Rancheros. Portions are great & every single bite is delicious. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the bacon was! It seems to be pretty basic everywhere I go but here it was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Came in last night for my birthday and sat at the bar. Ryan was exceptional! I have a gluten allergy, and he made sure everything we ordered was gluten free. He was very attentive and made great conversation! We will be coming back just for him! But the vegetable soup was perfect. The grilled shrimp cocktail had an amazing smoky flavor - an amazing twist on a traditional shrimp cocktail. See you soon!"}
{"text":"Nicole R was seriously the best server I've ever had. Everything she suggested we got and it was all so good. I recommend going here a thousand times over. I love everything we got. I suggest the bread pudding, scallops, NY strip, branzino, and the short rib potstickers! So amazing! We were here for my birthday dinner and they were so sweet about it #sobomb"}
{"text":"Visited this establishment for the first time recently. Great vibe. Happening place. One of the best gin and tonics I've had in a long time. So, what's not to like? The menu. We were a party of four. One of us had just come off the golf course and was starving. Sadly, not too much for him to sink his teeth into. There was little on the menu that I personally was interested in. The menu doesn't seem to know what it wants to be when it grows up. The food goes back and forth between American, Asian, Mexican, Italian, etc. Let's start with the appetizers. Spring Vegetable Crudites. I don't know about you, but I personally can't get excited about raw vegetables, crunchy or not, and certainly can't get excited about paying $12 for them. Moving on to the Short Rib Potstickers. Nah, probaby not. Made to Order  Guacomole. We actually ordered this and it was good. Only problem was the serving dish was small and unremarkable. Need to get it into something that would make a better presentation. Also, very few chips. Moving on to the Smoked Norwegian Salmon, need to get this off the menu. No one associates smoked salmon with a lunch menu. It's strictly breakfast or brunch. Warm Parker House Rolls? Hmmm. Wouldn't be my first choice. Warm Kale & Truffle Dip. We didn't have, but doesn't sound too bad. Roasted Chicken Tortilla Soup. When was soup an appetizer? Thought it was usually in a category of its own or under soup and salads. Speaking of soup, they need an alternative soup to the Tortilla soup. A corn soup would be a good alternative. Grilled & Chilled Shrimp. We ordered these and they were actually quite good. Can't say as we cared for the $16 price tag however. One would have thought for $16 the shrimp might have come out on a bed of arugula or something. Finally, the White Truffle Parmesan Fries sounded intriquing. However, one would normally see fries as a side dish, not an appetizer. One of our party ordered a burger with fries, but I don't think the fries were the White Truffle Parmesan Fries. I didn't notice a single pork dish on the entire menu. Pork barbacoa tacos would be amazing. They would cost the restaurant almost nothing to prepare. A few pork butts cooked overnight for less than $20. Sliders would be a great appetizer. Ono, mahi mahi or scallop sliders. Well, the overall impression of our party was that the food here is secondary. It's really too bad as there is so much potential here for an amazing menu. Even though it appears a lot of business people frequent this place, it doesn't mean they can't serve good food? Keep tuned in for my review of the next segment of their menu. Oh, did I mention the tables are small on the East side of the restaurant? I lived in fear the whole time I was going to knock my gin and tonic onto the floor."}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails and their truffle fries are TDF. I have tried several things on their menu and never disappointed. Staff and very professional & very knowledgeable. If you are looking for a place in Arcadia to go, def go here. Another well established Arcadia culinary must.."}
{"text":"The Henry was on my food list for my October trip.  I went and it was fabulous. 

My object of affection at the Henry was the braised Short Rib Benedict that I had been reading about for months.  And the pics for this dish really made me want to try it.

Dining solo, I sat at the bar, had a great (but busy) bartender and a wonderful large mug of hot coffee.

The dish itself was a delight.  The tenderness of the meat, the tangyness of the braising liquid, combined with the smoothness of the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce made for a great breakfast.  You know how you take a first bite of something and all you can do is close your eyes and lean your head a little - yeah it was like that.  My only wish is that the portion was bigger.  It's pricey, but worth it.

I will return for that dish."}
{"text":"This place is horrible. Do not come here. So many better choices on the strip. My parents food never came, and my salad was my entree which was the only thing served at the same time as the appetizer. The server, Ray, then argued with me about it after I pointed out the problem to him. Zero service recovery. Miserable experience. Felt like no one cared at all."}
{"text":"Pros: pastries and drinks are very good. Prices are affordable for Vegas. Good for family and people on a budget after losing at Vegas!

Cons: slow service, limited options for brunch, recommend going to the eggslut if you are in the cosmopolitan. Food is ok not great. 

Donuts are nasty. Bacon was good, yogurt was ok as well. 

Overall food is ok and reasonable. But there are better establishments to spend your money on."}
{"text":"The breakfast at The Henry was amazing! Me and my girlfriend woke up extra early and couldn't find many breakfast places open before 9am besides The Henry so we decided to give them a try and it was definitely worth it!! I had the short ribs Benedict which was by far the best breakfast I've had in Vegas and my girlfriend had the Belgian waffle that was great as well! For being in Vegas the prices were very fair! I will be back next time I'm in town and I highly recommend The Henry to anyone staying in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I sat at the bar and Tom was a very friendly, genuine bartender! I ate here for breakfast and they have an amazing Bloody Mary! They make their own Bloody Mary mix which is fresh and fantastic!"}
{"text":"We went to the Henry for a Saturday lunch and they were packed. We sat outside on their patio, luckily it was not 115 degrees outside.
I ordered a salad that had chicken and pistachios in it. I took my first bite and almost broke a tooth. I bit down on a piece of hard shell. I did let our waiter know and he proceeded to inform me that that has never happened before. I suggested that he let the kitchen know so it does not happen again and someone else breaks a tooth. I finished my salad carefully. 
The food is decent, although a bit over priced."}
{"text":"Great place. Was open late so after a long night of booze and gambling this was a great way to end the night. Got the burger and it was amazing."}
{"text":"The ambience is very very nice.. The menu for me didn't have enough options. So the only thing I had was the grilled and chilled shrimp appetizer. The shrimp were large. The were very grilled (burnt) on some pieces. But still tasty.. Our waiter was just ok, he disappeared for a good portion of the time we were there. All in all I'd like to back to give it another shot!"}
{"text":"I hoped for a far better meal coming from a restaurant inside the Cosmo. Seating sucks depending where you get put. I ordered The Henry Burger and it comes with mushrooms, caramelized onions and cheddar cheese however I had the shrooms left off. The bun was toasted and hard and the burger was dry. Just because a burger is big doesn't mean it's going to taste good. The onions were in abundance and and the cheese was good and since there was a decent amount of cheese it helped me get the dry burger and bun down. It came with a side of fries that were actually cooked perfect. I had no issue inhaling the fries. I did have a problem with a $18 burger that wasn't great let alone wasn't even good and $5 for soda is a complete rip off. Service was okay but I wish I didn't have to wait as long as I did for drink refills."}
{"text":"Great menu along with service! Make sure to call ahead to book a reservation. One of my most favorite spots!"}
{"text":"Went here with the Wife the day we were leaving Vegas so it was a little bittersweet..   

First I would like to mention that the restaurant and the hotel itself are so well decorated and designed.  It was obviously a very serious consideration when building the place.  

We were seated and given water, I ordered the french dip with truffle tater tots as the side.  The food came in decent time, the french did was AWESOME and the tater tots were so unique.  I hadn't really experienced truffles yet so it was interesting to have tater tots that were tossed in truffle oil.  It just classes up tater tots.. :)

Overall this was a great place to grab a bit for lunch, the dinner prices get up there and the lunch wasn't very affordable either for myself.. I could barely afford to eat anywhere in Vegas though.

Great place if you want to stop in a beautiful hotel for a bite.  Don't forget to walk around the rest of the Hotel to see it all!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere at The Henry is fantastic. We came for Sunday brunch, and were absolutely over the moon with the food and coffee. I had the smashed avocado toast and brûléed grapefruit with a cup of chai. I couldn't have been happier with the food. Despite the restaurant being pretty busy, the wait staff were relaxed and really on top of it. I would highly recommend this place. I wish I lived here so I could eat here more often!"}
{"text":"I am writing this review after four visits, I've tried breakfast, lunch & dinner.

Start with positives:
Overall friendly staff. 
(On ordering, sent a note of my food allergies to the kitchen. Great!) 
Nice place.
Decor good.
Clean.

Negatives (I am a special case!):
Slow service at times. 
Nothing much to eat for me on the menu as I have food allergies and they don't really accommodate.
Nothing Vegan on the menu. No real dairy/ cows milk substitutes. Only offer gluten free. 

(I can't have cows milk, eggs, yeast, cashews or peanuts!) 

My last visit was this morning. 
I went with a friend for breakfast after hiking Camelback.
I ordered a side of bacon, chicken sausage & (what should have been SMASHED) avocado (as they don't have guac ?? - disappointingly, it came out whole.)

I also ordered a small Americano, I didn't drink it, it wasn't great and CERTAINLY not worth $3.50!!!!

After sitting outside at our table for a short while, I was called back inside. I was told the chicken sausage is actually made with cows milk (thus no good for me. Appreciated that they told me, so that's a plus!) 
They offered ham or a small bit of steak, I said no thank you & I asked if I could have some grilled chicken breast instead, the chef agreed. 
I was really looking forward to my food (hungry after my hike) 
What came out on my plate was thin gross rubbery 'lunch meat' - was not very impressed with that at all. 

My overall impression of this restaurant is a little over priced & pretentious. 

'The Henry' wouldn't be my preference. 
I wouldn't want to go again, however I guess if I HAD to go there I would be ok with it lol!!"}
{"text":"This is a great, fun restaurant.

My fiance and I were really impressed by how everything looks here.
They have a nice patio, as well as a fun area to sit near the front.

Service is excellent.  Our waiter was very kind.

The food is great, especially the Skirt Steak.  Delicious.  The Short Rib Appetizer is also great.  My fiance wasn't a big fan of the fish she ordered.

We weren't happy with where we were sat.  They seemed really busy so we didn't want to ask to be re-sat.   don't sit next to the kitchen.  It's busy and loud.

We were impressed enough to return in the future, but there's definitely room to improve.  

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Fox Restaurant concepts & after visiting The Henry, I'll say I'm quite pleased with this restaurant! I came here for Sunday brunch with a group of people and we all had a great dining experience. A table was reserved for us so we were able to get seated upon arrival. Our drink orders were taken shortly after. We were waiting for a couple of people who were running late, but our waitress came by to make sure we had full cups of drinks, asked if we had questions, etc.

After a look over the menu, we all ordered a variety of different things, breakfast selections as well as lunch selections. I got the Wood Grilled Chicken sandwich with truffle fries. It was good; I wasn't super amazed with it, so I'm not sure I'll order it again, however I pretty much got exactly what I expected & what I was in the mood for. The only let down on the plate was the truffle fried which I upgraded to for an additional charge. They weren't crispy/crunchy, but more so soft/soggym however the truffle sauce that they came with was the saving grace.

Everyone else really enjoyed their meals. The cost was pretty high, especially for breakfast food, however I think it was worth the treat. I'd say The Henry is a great meeting place for a group. The decor inside is really pretty & the floor layout is very open so you're not sitting directly next to the table to your right or left. They also have a small coffee shop next to the restaurant, which I'd also be interested in trying out. I think we'll be back."}
{"text":"Poor is my rating for this place and it is totally based on just one thing I ordered. 
CHEESEBURGER!

If you like your cheeseburger with a huge chunk of meat badly \"well done\" with a soggy bun and some uniquely weird thin fries \"DEEEEEP FRIED\" and you would like to pay 20$ for it this is your spot.

Sorry but my neighbor's 6 year old can make a better cheeseburger. So try something else and Good luck!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! The atmosphere is homy and welcoming, yet upscale and classy. Fox did a great job accomplishing this. The managers are helpful to staff and customers & the hostesses are extremely nice. Aj was my server. He was very friendly and professional. I told him to surprise me with his favorite coffee and dessert. He made great suggestions! The dessert was rich and tasty. The coffee was refreshing. I will definitely go back again soon and recommend it for any occasion."}
{"text":"My company had a banquet here. The food and sinks here are SO BOMB and. It to mention the staff is super friendly and knowledgeable. Their little appetizers were delicious I loved these crunchy potato with cheese things, I'd totally come back with my husband. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Got the Chicken Fried Steak for breakfast. Definitely an amazing meal. One of the better non buffet places I've had in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We were a party of 3 who arrived at 7pm. The place was packed so I was glad to have a reservation. The service was excellent from the time we walked in until the time we left. It was evident that the management takes the time to train the staff. We ordered drinks that were prepared to perfection,  then ordered an appetizer that was equally delicious. We were not rushed and after enjoying our drinks and starter we ordered our dinners. Our main courses were wonderful. Thanks for a great dinner out with friends."}
{"text":"Food good but $$$ for the portions. Staff was meh. Sunday late breakfast time was busy but server and bus staff were waaaaay inattentive."}
{"text":"Best place to brunch in town, however The Henry's dinner menu is not the best out of the FRC."}
{"text":"The Henry has to be one of the greatest places in Arcadia if not all of Phoenix. They have plenty of seating and an impressive menu. I've ordered almost everything and it is all really good. High quality food. Attention to detail. Cool ambience. Good service. Go here!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Cool atmosphere, beautiful patio, great brunch menu that includes lunch features.  Turkey and Swiss omelette was great and the salted caramel pastry roll was to die for! Service was decent. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I appreciate the fact that it's open 24hrs. The late night menu is varied but it's very graveyard shift. I'm pretty sure it was one server to the entire restaurant at 2am. It took longer than I would've liked and my order didn't come out correct but it was still very good. The specialty cocktails weren't all that great. Probably won't order drinks there again. But good atmosphere and great spot to people watch."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here. The staff was attentive because I was in a hurry. Both food items ( pulled pork sandwich and omelet) and cappuccinos were delicious. Highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Henry, you hit it out of the park today!!!  Great service, good company, and fantastic salmon over hash browns. As always, the coffee was wonderful and the popovers sublime!  The meal made my day and, combined with an uber-short wait, it earned the coveted 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I always eat breakfast/ (or lunch depending when i wake up) at Henry's after a long night of \"vegas\" activities. 

Their tatter tots are amazing!!!!!  Everything on the breakfast menu is good. Their bloody marys are stiff and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Oh Henry, you have my attention! A beautiful building and even more exciting interior. The patio is gorgeous with plants and strung lights. The inside takes on a fresh twist to an old world charm study in someone's million dollar mansion. Upholstered chairs and love seats, modern ceiling to floor curtains, open concept and beautiful slabs of dark wood tables. The Henry has everything--dining, drinks, coffee, and baked goods.

I recommend the kale/garlic dip, tomato toast, quinoa tacos, bolognese pasta and of course, BREAD PUDDING! Fantastic service and amazing food, this place a favorite of mine in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I have been here a number of times and and for the most part have had good experiences.  I was there today for lunch and ordered the Chicken Bahn Mi sandwich.  My friends ordered salads.  I should have known better than to have ordered this as it was not even close to being a true Bahn Mi sandwich.  It was laden with sauce, soggy bread and just flat out inedible.  I took one bite and didn't touch it again.  The wait person (Jacob) came over a number of times to fill our water but never asked me about my sandwich which I was clearly not eating.  I had also pushed the plate over to the side.
Finally as he was clearing the salad plates from my friends I told him to please advise the kitchen that if they are going to put a Bahn Mi sandwich on the menu, they need to know what it should taste like.  Later he came back to see if I perhaps I wanted a pastry!  Really?  I told him it was too late for him to ask me what I would have wanted instead.  

Insult to injury, he didn't take my sandwich off the bill which I didn't eat.  If he had done the right thing, I would not be writing this review.  This has left a bad taste in my mouth and I doubt I will go back to The Henry as a result."}
{"text":"Went Down in quality from 2 years ago but still really good. Before it was 5 stars and mater chef. Now it's about what u would expect from 24 hr dining in a nice hotel. Great."}
{"text":"Ended up here 3x during our stay at the Cosmopolitan for breakfast, lunch, and late-night. Not only was it convenient (location and hours) but the food did not disappoint. 

-Corned beef hash topped w/eggs over easy - Great breakfast option. Really enjoyed how they cooked the corned beef. 
- Henry burger - It was good but nothing special. Ordered it medium and it came out very pink. I didn't mind, but worth noting. 
- Deep fried mac and beer cheese - Fried deliciousness. The dipping sauce complimented it well. If you're going to try one thing here, I recommend the mac and cheese.    
- Truffle tater tots - So crispy and tasty. A nice alternative to fries."}
{"text":"Excellent Cobb salad with very fresh ingredients. Good service too. Nice place for a quick casual meal of quality"}
{"text":"Very good! Had breakfast with my travel companions.  I had the corned beef hash with 2 eggs and sourdough toast.  It came with hollondaise sauce, but I opted out.  The corned beef was crispy on the outside and still justify on inside.  I would get poached eggs next time, Instead of over easy.  (My bad). My friend had the crab cake eggs benedict with the poached eggs and loved it.  She skipped the hollondaise as well. Illy coffee is to die for and the decor and service is amazing."}
{"text":"Best french onion soup, and the martinis are still amazing, only four stars because the water taste unfiltered"}
{"text":"This place is extremely average went for breakfast it was good but nothing special maybe a little over priced for what it was"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Consistent, service is always great and we always forget to make a reservation and they get our 4-5 person family seated with minimal wait. The short ribs are my fav! Never have I had a problem here ever!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, fantastic french fries, fun environment, competitive prices and personable service. Plus you earn Cosmo Hotel Identity points, simply put an amazing place to eat that I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice. The service has been outstanding, and the food reasonably priced and top quality! The Henry is a hidden gem. Great place to catch a sporting event and comfortably enjoy watching it."}
{"text":"Thought this was somewhere else so initially was going to leave and find the other place instead. GOOD job I stayed, the waiter was brilliant, the food was cooked well, lots of it too and quite prompt, especially for somewhere on the strip. But real credit goes to the barman, one of the best margaritas I have had. Price was reasonable and overall, the Stars say - I am a fan and will return."}
{"text":"One of the best places in the state.  Everyone wishes they had a place like this.  The flow of people makes my head spin."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a foodie, but when we drove up and saw what a huge place it is we were doubtful -- usually, we find restaurants that seat that many people focus on quantity rather than quality. We were wrong -- the food was outstanding! Grilled & chilled shrimp were perfectly cooked, and Brie toast was decadent and fresh at the same time. His short-rib was fall-apart delish; my tortellini was excellent, though the sauce was a bit thin. Desserts were good, but not TD4. We arrived at 5 pm on a Saturday, with no reservation, and while the place was definitely busy we didn't have to wait for a table. When we come back (and we will), we'll sit on the patio because the open kitchen & hard surfaces make it really loud inside. It's a real mix of clientele...hipsters side-by-side with granddads, which I think is cool."}
{"text":"The Henry is a place that clearly doesn't need any help getting the word out.  I was visiting Scottsdale for a wedding and went here based on the reviews.  It lived up to its reputation.  We went on a Saturday morning.  Called ahead to see what the wait was.  We were told 15-20 minutes. We arrived (parking was tough but we found a good spot.  yay) and were sat immediately at a bar top.  I love the huge ceilings and the immense personality (books, sofas, etc) inherent in The Henry. Service was fast and friendly.  I ordered a bloody mary and it was appropriately spicy.  Honestly, it was the best bloody mary I've had in a long time so I was quite pleased.  I ordered the huevos ranchero and it. was. amazing.  Beautifully presented, the eggs were perfectly cooked, the potatoes delicious and not too soft, not excessively crunch (juuuuuuust right).  I love the chip to egg to bean ratio.  And it was the perfect amount of food.  Based on the quality of food and service I would have expected the price to be astronomical.  But au contraire, it was very reasonably priced. If I was a local I would be going to The Henry all the time.  It has something for everyone.   Personality?  Check.  Amazing Food? Check.  Variety of seating options?  Check.  Fantastic place."}
{"text":"I ordered the burger for take-out and asked for extra pickles on my burger.  Who the F*&K puts bread and butter pickles in their burger?  Just saying."}
{"text":"A beautiful restaurant with friendly staff. But the key part is always the food. I got the Short Ribs Benedict ($19) because it's what a large portion of Yelp reviewers had recommended. It was absolutely amazing. The thing I always worry about poached eggs is that the yolk gets overcooked and begins to harden. The first thing I did when my food arrived was run the knife through the center of the eggs and was super happy to find that the yolk ran out perfectly. The ribs were tender enough to cut with a butter knife and the potato cake under the ribs were cooked well. There was a jus covering the ribs and a wonderfully made hollandaise over the eggs. The flavors blended together were heavenly. I also ordered the apple juice and it was totally worth the $5 because it was fresh, and it was completely different from everything I'd ever had before. I could just imagine that with some kind of caramel vodka and some cinnamon schnapps to create an amazing baked caramel apple kind of drink.

My friend ordered the Cinnamon Roll French Toast ($15) with bacon ($6). The french toast was equally amazing. The buttery flavor of the roll with the cinnamon swirled through it brought a unique flavor to it that I hadn't had before with other french toast. The bacon was cooked incredibly well with a good crunch, but not overly done. 

This was an absolutely amazing breakfast and I couldn't have asked for any better. Everything about this place gave me the best start to my morning. I would highly recommend it and I would go back again. For what we got, it was worth every penny, and the cost of it felt well justified. Try this place. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"What are all the great reviews of this place about?! 
I am convinced the raving about The Henry is coming from hungover, haven't gone to bed yet, people who love to spend $50 on a \"just okay\" breakfast.

We got a great night sleep so maybe it skewed our opinion of the food?
We made a reservation via Yelp's Open Table link and were seated upon arrival. 

The wait staff was very kind, very patient and offered honest opinions and suggestions about the menu, which we greatly appreciated. 
We started with the fried mac-n-cheese (5 stars) and it was amazing. However our entrees were okay. 
The Huevos Rancheros were fine, but nothing stellar.The \"marinated\" steak was actually teriyaki marinade, which I didn't finish and left most of it on my plate. For $17 I could have had this dish and more at any local mexican restaurant in Old Town San Diego.
The Henry was also fine, not stellar. The apple sausage was tasty, but the potatoes were just blah. 

Overall we were both really disappointed with our experience. For all the rave, \"you can't miss this place\", \"you can't go to Vegas without going to The Henry\", 5 star reviews we were set up for great disappointment."}
{"text":"This is a good place to sit and work if you have taken the time to dress up and shower. So like most places. Sorry to say but I wish their green tea was sweeter - fortunately/unfortunately this is NOT Starbucks. Heard they also serve dinner and lunch and other stuff here but, I just went here to have a deep conversation and it served it's purpose in this regard."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! Really cool atmosphere, the patio outside is nicely shaded and the inside has a lot of neat decorations. The egg white turkey omelette was delicious and the original breakfast sandwich comes on a fresh soft croissant type bread. Every breakfast option comes with breakfast potatoes. You can either sit and eat or order at the coffee bar for a more casual atmosphere. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a wonderful breakfast here today. The atmosphere is really great and the food was amazing. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I ate dinner at The Henry on a busy Tuesday night - we were a table of four.

Tried the shrimp, artichoke, smoked salmon and brie appetizers - all were excellent. 4+/5

Tried the skirts on fire and the pork entree. Very tasty as well. 5/5

Mule mixed drink excellent! 5/5

Everyone loved this place(one of fox's best yet)

The decor and ambiance is perfect, the coffee bar is a plus (I hear business breakfast is awesome here- no waiter service but you can use the restaurant facilities...) 

The booth tables are VERY comfortable...

I figure Mr. Fox would not disappoint in this restaurant which sits right below his corporate offices...

EXCELLENT SERVICE!!

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Btw, desserts were superb, and pricing is fair!"}
{"text":"Fox concepts restaurant. Made a reservation ahead of time for a late brunch. Wait time was about 30 minutes. The look and feel of the place had elements of an office and other unique pieces. 

Servers were dressed in a light pink button up shirt, striped ties, vertical striped aprons; and the men seem to be wearing oxfords to complement the look. Spiffy. I asked Seth, our server, to do a run through of the menu of the favorites. 

Some of the breakfast/brunch favorites are the quinoa burrito, carrot cake pancake, chicken fried chicken,  smoked Norwegian salmon, roasted turkey french dip and CB and Rye. I opted to go for the Le Pig which had diced potatoes  and scrambled egg, ham and gruyere cheese squished between a pillowed toasted croissant. The chicken fried chicken had biscuit halves with fried breaded chicken on each and 2 sunny side up eggs with gravy sauce surrounding the set. Every bite of each plate was scrumptious.  

I'm not a day drinker by any means but I had to try the Henry's Private Island drink made with some acai liquor and some acai juice and other juices. 1/3 of it was just enough for me! 

Had to try bread pudding since I'm a huge fan of it! Vanilla bean ice cream scoop sat on top of the bread pudding with large golden raisins sprinkled throughout. Paired with the Cleo which is almond milk, hazelnut and espresso. 

Super service from Seth and the staff. Seth was helpful, cheerful and had an amiable personality. I'm planning on coming back here to try the rest of the menu!!"}
{"text":"Bacon infused makers mark for breakfast. That deserves high fives all around. Taylor ham. ..  For a jersey boy, sold. Shortrib benny,  crispy corned beef...  Maybe just my staycation love of cosmo, brunch, off shopping, cochon soon..."}
{"text":"Overcooked the burger.  No follow up on the quality of food from the server.  Also forgot a drink for my wife."}
{"text":"I find it hard to believe that The Henry has been open two months.  My experience there this afternoon was more like a soft opening experience. 

I arranged to meet some friends at The Henry to try it out.  Being a big fan of Fox Restaurants my expectations may have been high.  Combined with the fact that there has been a lot of news about Fox going national AND the corporate office being upstairs....  I was really expecting something like Olive and Ivy +1. 

Finding the front door and hostess station at The Henry is your first challenge.  They are both well designed to cause confusion.  I managed to wave down a server and ask where the front door was and she let me know I had just entered it.  Imagine my confusion as I was standing in the middle of the dining room.  She then pointed out the hostess stand where 5 bored looking servers and 4 confused hostesses hunched over something on an old office desk.  I followed an equally confused couple to the crowd and listened as it was explained where HH was served.  The couple walked away after having a minor melt down similar to the one I felt brewing, as did the servers, leaving me alone with 2 of the hostesses that (not realizing I was not with the couple) turned back to their desk and completely ignored me.  This after telling the couple it was their first day.  Listen ladies... first rule of the hospitality industry.... be hospitable??!   

Once I stepped up and overheard them talking about their outfits I interrupted to let them know I would sit on the patio with my 6 friends (which she had JUST explained to the couple was open seating).  I witnessed SHEAR PANIC on this young womans face as she stammered out: '\"Six?!... Ummmm.... The server should be here soon for that area I'll see if I can find them if you want to wait\"'.  Really?  Its open seating, its not staffed, I've been in this restaurant for 15 minutes now, and I havent spoken to a single person I didn't initiate conversation with.  

I eventually found a seating area inside, 1 foot from another couple, on my own, and we had our drinks.  HH is drinks only, and kind of weak at that.... $2 off well and $5 beer from 4pm-6pm M-F, no food specials.  Not that there is any munchy food on the menu... its all pretty frou frou, as is the crowd: botox be thy name.  

I've heard over and over that the food is amazing, but I couldn't care less.  If you cant make me feel welcome and blow me away with atmosphere and HH specials there are about 1000 other places in the area code that can,  including North Arcadia where we had a amazing dinner after hastily departing The Henry.  Do yourself a favor and wait another 6 months for The Henry to work out its growing pains."}
{"text":"This is a very presentable place to take friends and relatives.  They have vegan items on their menu and a delicious bakery for those with a sweet tooth.  Nice!"}
{"text":"The Henry is one of our \"go to\" restaurants in Vegas FOR LUNCH and Breakfast. It is good food, great service at the bar, and they pour a stiff drink. You will, however pay a premium for all of the above. We always sit at the bar and get the Chicken Salad Sandwich and the Truffle Tots. For breakfast the Henry breakfast. The hash-browns are amazing, bloody mary's are yum. Attila is a great bartender to sit and have a chat with.

My suggestion, sit at the bar to have a nice lunch or breakfast. Follow that up with sticking a $20 bill in the video poker machines at Bond for some \"free\" drinks and some great people watching."}
{"text":"We were in Phoenix visiting friends and our friends brought us here.  My friend who had been there before could not stop raving about the pork chop.  My other friends and I were skeptical as a pork chop has never been high on our list of things to order in a restaurant.  

As we walked in, we were pleasantly surprised by the inside.  We liked the decor a lot.  It appeared that there was a coffee/pastry bar right in front with a lounge area with sofas, chairs and coffee tables.  Looks like a great place to grab a cup of coffee in the morning!  We were seated fairly quickly and were greeted by our server Caroline.  She was really nice and we all joked about how we wanted to be friends with her and we should just ask her to sit down with us.  We ordered drinks.  I got Henry's Private Island which was fruity and delicious.  It went down very quickly!  =)  Caroline heard us cheering our friends birthday and quickly came over to wish her a happy birthday.  So nice!  

For appetizers, we ordered the kale and garlic dip which was amazing!  We devoured it.  For our entrees, everyone except for me ordered the pork chop.  I ordered the short rib and planned to share with a friend so we could try both.  We received the meals and I thought that the short rib was great.  But then I tried the pork chop.  WOW!  The pork chop was amazing!  Two of my friends stated that this was one of the top 10 best meals that they have ever had!!!  I have to agree as well!  It was at least two inches thick which I've never seen before.  It wasn't dry at all.  It was moist and the flavor went all through the meat.  So delicious.  

For dessert, we shared the sweet potato semifreddo which was yummy.  We also got the salted caramel ice cream.  Amazing!  My Phoenix friends commented that it was better that the salted caramel ice cream that they get at their favorite local ice cream place.  

Overall, we all really enjoyed our meal.  The food was delicious and the service was fantastic.  I can't wait to go again the next time I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST FOC Concept Restaurant! Took my family there and EVERYONE enjoyed it. The atmosphere was fun, classy, and yummy! Our server David was very knowledgable about the menu. Check this neighborhood spot out!"}
{"text":"Such a great experience. The fiancé and I haven't been out on a date in a while and this was the perfect spot to go to. 

Nice location. Nice structure. Interior design and decor is cute (as she would say) and sophisticated. Food and service was absolutely amazing. 

Everything we ordered was great. We seem to love starting our meals with dips and their Kale and Garlic Dip was an awesome pick. Served with pita, which you can't go wrong with, and wheat crackers, which I thought complimented the flavors of the dip really well. For our entrees, we ordered the Korean Style Steak and the Braised Short Rib. Both were phenomenal. (Note: Our waiter was excellent in describing the entrees. His descriptions were mouth-watering!) The Korean steak was served with fried green beans over vegetable fried rice. It actually had some hints of Vietnamese and Thai flavors, but that just added to how much we loved it. The braised rib was really amazing. I was very impressed with how it was prepared. Already off the bone, and the meat just slides off with each bite. Everything it was served with were perfect, especially the bits of blue cheese. 

Drinks selection is quite decent. There were several beers to choose from and the wine list seemed pretty standard for high-end restaurants. In addition is their House Browns. It's a selection of different whiskeys from different regions of the world. We are both whiskey drinkers and practicing connoisseurs (hah!) so we enjoyed that. 

Again, service was awesome. Welcoming host and friendly waiter who was very knowledgable about the contents of the menu. When my fiancé ordered whiskey and he saw that she didn't really like what she ordered, he immediately offered to replace it with a glass of another type. 

Sure it's a bit pricey, but I hope you are aware of that before you walk in. I have nothing negative to say about The Henry. Loved it there!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious. I tried everyone else's meal (shameless) and i liked everything. The service was great! One of our appetizers came out bland and we mentioned it to our waitress who was much more offended than we were! She took it back and brought us another and made sure we didnt pay for either. The only knock against that its \"coffee shop\" are, though a nice place to sit and chat, makes mediocre coffee for the same price as really good coffee :/. Save your money and get more food!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner because we had always heard good things about The Henry. I wish I could give it a better rating, but the food was just very mediocre.  I ordered the branzino and chose sides of brussel sprouts and orzo.  The fish was an extremely skimpy piece and the brussel sprouts were tough and very hard. The orzo was by far the best food on my plate.....but it's pretty hard to screw up pasta. My daughter got the tuna poke bowl and again, it was VERY skimpy on the tuna. Not sure if the fish delivery didn't make it this week or what. All in all, a pretty disappointing meal. The ambiance was nice, but definitely not a place I would rush back to."}
{"text":"Excellent menu selections for quick but elegant and tasty treats. Food is prepared quickly by a group of very professional cooks."}

{"text":"This place has the best coffee in Scottsdale. The service is always great, Alex our server was very friendly, fast, and had great suggestions for the menu and the drinks. The atmosphere and crowd at the Henry is always very vibrant and appealing. I will definitely be back. 
On Saturdays and Sundays they have a Bloody Mary cart, not a huge fan of bloody Mary's but these are great!! Five stars for sure."}
{"text":"Great place! Tons of space, funky decor. Cute! Had the best french dip ever, turkey and some kind of yummy aioli or something. Nice big room to bring a group for a work lunch or bring your laptop and chill with a coffee from the coffee bar."}
{"text":"Loved the open space here and the food! 

I'm surely coming back!!

Our waiter Vince was exceptional and very polite!

The rib eye was to die for and you have to save room for their dessert! 


 Molten Chocolate ice cream fudge 


Love the decor here"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the FOX restaurants - high quality food, service, atmosphere.  The price is a little high, but worth the consistency.  I love the idea of The Henry - FOX corporate upstairs, beautiful upscale family/neighborhood diner feel with a busy bar and beautiful coffee/study area in the same place.  The design, decor, patio, service, and ambiance are all top notch. 

You may already deduce that my low rating must reflect the food.  Correct, Watson.  Breakfast/brunch is great, but the lackluster dinner menu disappoints.  I've done it (dinner) 4 times just to be sure; but nothing is jaw-dropping or inspiring.  Plain fish in smallish portions, short ribs that are blah, other items that other places do better.  Furthermore, the menu has been the same since the beginning.  I will come back for breakfast/brunch, a drink, or coffee; but - especially for the price - never again dinner.  You will see in another related review that I prefer Chelsea's Kitchen, a cousin right up the road."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had Easter dinner here and were surpised at the functionality of the place. They have a lovely outdoor patio where we comfortably sat and hung out at for awhile, a full bar, a complete coffee shop/cafe area, and a large inside restaurant as well. My boyfriend and I agreed this was \"Lux Coffeebar for grown ups\" and that we should hang out here more. Our waitress was lovely and bubbly, and gave us some complimentary macarons at the end of our dinner. We ordered the kale dip and both got the salmon with sunchokes (neither of us knew what they were until we asked. They're like a cousin to potatoes). Overall the food was tasty and the atmosphere was comfortable and fun."}
{"text":"A bit on the pricey side, but I loved the food and environment. We sat outside on the patio to enjoy the beautiful evening."}
{"text":"Disappointed for the first time at a Fox Restaurant.  I brought in a party of 12 for a work function.  I have raved about The Henry so they were looking forward to my recommendation.   Several of the items that we wanted to order were not available.  The Grilled and Chilled shrimp, Tuna, and NY Steaks were all out.  It was a very busy Wednesday night but this was very disappointing.  The Restaurant was also extremely warm and my guests all complained of how uncomfortable the evening was."}
{"text":"We finally made it to The Henry!

Despite the long wait it was worth every minute. 

We were greeted by a really nice hostess and she right away told us about the wait time as she told us to get a drink at the bar and make our self's comfortable in the waiting area. We did, and the time went by really fast.

The atmosphere was amazing. 

The interior design was right in our back yard. Music was perfect and drinks from the bar were the bomb. 

40 minutes later, we were escorted to our table on their patio area. It was perfect. The weather outside was perfect and atmosphere was divine. 

My boyfriend ordered Roasted Turkey French Dip and I ordered Warm Salmon salad. We shared and we were both stoked. Every bite was so delicious. We did not want it to end. For drinks we ordered Upstate Gentleman and Old Fashion. Yummmm

We are going back for sure and would recommend this place to any of our friends. The only disappointment we had was the fact that we waited this long to go when it is so close to us. 

Thanks to all \"The Henry\" staff!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast (ate at the bar). Great food, great service. Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Only reason I give it a 4 and not 5 was because I made reservations and still had to wait to be seated. 
The food and drinks were amazing like everything else in the Cosmo! 
Hubby and I will be back, was the best brunch and local place to be with the best ambiance!"}
{"text":"Hands down probably the best breakfast and food I've had in a long time!!  I ordered the short rib eggs Benedict (MUST TRY!) also had the Rosè all day (mimosa type drink), really good. You can tell there is alcohol in it unlike some other brunch places I've tried. My cousin had the breakfast burrito and she LOVED it. The bacon was made just right. The sausage links were good. Coffee came in nice large cups (perfect for \"morning afters\") and if you're a coffee snob, this was good quality coffee!"}
{"text":"Bottom line: 
When the managers promise that your credit card has been refunded because of their staffs blunders, they're lying.  
No refund ever received. 

As a follow up to the really dishonest and disrespectful treatment we experienced from the hostess and \"manager\" as detailed in my previous review, I was contacted by a manager named Kolin, who told me to contact another manager named Nate, who told me that they had \"fully refunded\" my credit card.  
I didn't ask for a refund, I didn't expect a refund (and the truth is I didn't believe it when I was told as Nate didn't mention it until the middle of the conversation as though he was making it up at that moment) but he said they had already refunded my card so I said I appreciated it.
And guess what?  
NO REFUND AT ALL.  
NOTHING.  
JUST MORE LIES.  
At least they're consistent.  
Lied to by the hostess, lied to by the night manager and lied to by the day manager...that's the trifecta of bullshit!
I'll chalk this experience at The Henry up as truly my worst experience with any staff, at any restaurant, anywhere in the world."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant was amazing. The service - Top Notch. The food - Delicious. I even loved the dishes! I never love the dishes! 

While here I got the Braised Short Rib Benedict, which did not disappoint in any way. The gravy was perfect, the eggs were perfect, everything was effin perfect!"}
{"text":"Whatever you do, don't get the omelette. For some reason it did not taste right, it was a California omelette made up of bacon, cheese and avocados. Too much avocado not enough cheese and the egg wasn't cooked enough. My dish came with hash browns, fruit and figs. The fruit and figs were good, hashbrowns not so much. It was a bit too expensive for the quality of the food, especially an omelette and hashbrowns."}
{"text":"Yum! Love The Henry. Their short rib potstickers are to die for. I highly recommend cutting them in half and soaking up more of the sauce it comes with. I'm also a fan of their turkey French dip and quinoa breakfast burrito. You really can't go wrong with anything here."}
{"text":"I've been super picky with my 5 star ratings... but these guys deserve it!! 

The service was really good, but the food and drinks were even better! 

Finally checked this place out during a work lunch, I loved the interior decor, visually captivating with different seating areas, wall papers, even the ceiling was decorated. Truly a delight to all your senses. 

I had the harvest quinoa bowl. The amount of flavors and textures was just incredible. Still not sure what a melted sweet potato is... but every bite was filling and tasty. 

I'll definitely come back to try more of the menu items!"}
{"text":"The Henry is terrific--the space is great looking and very inviting.  They were packed on a Saturday afternoon so we sat at the bar--which was terrific--I wasn't in the mood for day drinking so I had a virgin mary--it was fabulous--can't wait to go back and do the make your own thing--had breakfast--just simple eggs and potatoes --everything was just right and one of the best breakfasts I have had in a long time.  Definitely plan to go back and try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"The Henry has become a staple the moment we arrive in Vegas. I love their wings and Long Island Ice Tea. Bring back the artichoke dip..... Please!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with my husband and a few friends. Fantastic quality food that's perfect for sopping up the rest of that liquor. Service was a bit slow, but other than that, everything was spot-on. I highly recommend the steak and eggs. The steak is huge and perfect for splitting. I think I found my Vegas brunch spot for life. Added bonus: gluten free bread!"}
{"text":"best place for late night breakfast. one downfall is that it's not the same menu at all times of day. The food isn't OUTSTANDING, but it's perfect for that late night hunger after partying in Vegas. The short rib tots and french toast are awesome. The cocktails are good too."}
{"text":"After a night of clubbing, gambling, and drinking, we went to the cosmopolitan to get some secret pizza. The line was HELLA long, so we went downstairs to The Henry. Worse mistake of the night. The food was terrible! I got the country fried steak and it tasted so bad. The meat was all mushy and not seasoned at all. The gravy tasted bland as well. Definitely not worth $19. The bill was over $200 and no one in my party thought the food was anywhere near that price. The service wasn't great either. The waiter took our order, brought out the food, and never came back. I recommend you pass this up. Plenty of other options on the strip. The end."}
{"text":"After hearing great things about this place over the years, I finally got a chance to go try it out! 

The location is prime...couldn't be any better. The menu is ok. I just don't see how it's unique to any other nice restaurant. I did really like the mixed berry lemonade tonic water!!! 

The service was good but there was nothing that stood out to me about it."}
{"text":"Reason for visit: rough day at the office 

Service: friendly, helpful and will help you when ordering which I appreciate

Cool points: the patio is awesome for outside dining and if the table next to the fireplace is open - jump on that

Food: I am limiting my score to only 4 stars because this was my second visit - but each time, I've only ordered cocktails, appetizers and salads. That being said - the cocktails are the best I've had in the Arcadia area and the appetizers have always been tasty....I recommend the brussel sprout caesar salad, the short ribs potstickers and for dessert - chocolate molten lava cake. I ordered the Fig and Ginger mule which was the perfect start and finished with the Fox on the Run which is light, delicious and refreshing. The bf ordered the Boulevardier (sp) and the mischief - he loved trying this new place out. I'm positive we'll return again."}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Well trained employees always seem to get it right.  Great place to escape and get some work done in relative solitude."}
{"text":"I ordered the Mediterranean chicken salad.  It had so much dressing on it that the greens were too soggy to eat. The flavors left something to be desired.  I probably ordered the wrong thing. That's the negative.  The positive is our waiter, Chad, was awesome.  The French fries are a must. The breakfast menu looked more appealing.

Even though the decor is cool, the noise is very distracting."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, but this was the first time I was beyond starvation and trying to soak up alcohol!!! My drunk food of choice is chicken nachos (which they don't have on their late night menu ), but when I saw tatter tot anchors with short rib I jumped at the chance. Our waitress also said they were phenomenal so why not? They came out rather quickly and my first thought was, \"that's cute\". My friend and I laughed because we intended on sharing this plate that was obviously smaller than a personal size serving. Lol. We indeed shared and had to order something else to hold us over so fish and chips it was! Thank God it was a bigger more shareable serving! 

Usually serving sizes here are pretty big and they come with a big price tag considering. $18 for the nachos and they could've gave us an ample amount of tots. 

I also noticed an all female staff! Not sure if that's Thierry thing but all servers and the manager were female and I thought that was pretty cool. Maybe it was just Wonder Woman night?!?"}
{"text":"I was very excited to finally go check The Henry out, so when friends invited me for brunch I went. My first impression was that it is a bit confusing on where the hostess stand is located. I think there were like two different entrances, and no one really greeting you as you walk in. The menu is great with lots of options. I ordered a omelette, and it was good. We had a party of four, and we all ordered our beverages first, and by the time the food arrived our drinks still hadn't been made. It wasn't until the end of our meal that the guy serving our table brought out our drinks in to go cups! That was very disappointing! Food was good, but the service was lacking."}
{"text":"Really enjoy The Henry. Been there 3x! 
Love the interior, but will agree it is a bit loud at times for conversation. The menu is eclectic. I tried the chef's breakfast special just because it sounded so unusual and Seth recommended it, so I trusted and wasn't disappointed. Very good.

The Kale and apple slaw surprised me and is my favorite item right now. And the white truffle and parmesan fries.. well just order and thank me later.

I always ask to be seated in Seth's section! He's the school teacher by day/server on nights/weekends! His great people skills allows him to give amazing attention without hovering, good suggestions, fun personality. He definitely completes the dining experience ! He's the best!

This will become a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"This is an interesting place. 

We dined here on a Saturday evening while traveling to Phoenix.  When we pulled into the parking lot,  it was full of 30 and 40 year old people, some with children,  and it seemed lively and upbeat. 

This impression carried over when we entered, there were lots of people having a good time, and the restaurant was full.  

We were seated quickly at a small table,  there was a banquette for my wife, and I had a chair facing the wsll, which eliminated my ability to enjoy the restaurant's pleasant and upbeat  ambience. 

The waitress was helpful and friendly.  The food was tasty and presented quickly.  If you're keeping track of such things it was about half again as expensive as it should have been.

Now, the pacing of a dinner is important. No one wants to sit for an hour or two just waiting for dinner to arrive.  Here, the opposite is true. We were seated at 7:10, and at 7:40 we were walking out the door. 

As I said, the food was tasty,  portions a trifle small, but the best thing about this place is the ambiance and the people watching,  and there was just no time to do that. Depending on your seating placement some in your party may miss a lot of it anyway. 

Maybe I will return if I am back in town some time in the future."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, fantastic kids menu, delicious food, outstanding service, and in the neighborhood. So excited to have The Henry here. We highly recommend the Swedish meatballs, the cauliflower polenta is amazing, and sitting by the kitchen line is fun to watch."}
{"text":"I was here for lunch on labor day weekend and ordered the short ribs benedict with poached egg on potatoes.  This was my favorite item on the menu here.  The short ribs didn't come out as hot as I wanted them.  Later on in the day and evening we return for the wings, fish and chips, artichoke dip and french dip.  Not too shaby but I had better.  The buffalo wings were pretty small and I enjoy the fish and chips.  The french dip had more bread than meat and the artichoke dip taste like artichoke dip.  Can't go wrong making that."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor. Well thought out, open kitchen, with considered, consistent theme throughout restaurant and outside seating area. Started with the salmon appetizer, and though had high expectations, was still blown away.  Main was the Korean skirt steak; incredible.  Coffee at end of meal also on point.  Varied menu with lots of interesting choices, as well as accommodating chefs for those in party with quite strict dietary requirements.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch or breakfast.  The breakfast scene is lively between business or work people meeting and moms dropping in for coffee after delivering the kids to school, etc.  the baristas handle the load and the kitchen delivers.  My favorite bfst is the California burrito.

Lunch is more of the same as far as it being a great place for a work lunch.  The food is all good and a wide choice so all can be happy.  Very nice wine list.

I hit the Henry at least once every time I get to PHX!"}
{"text":"Went in last night for dinner and our server Dana was wonderful! Super friendly, very attentive and was able to answer every question we had about the menu. The food was amazing, but the service we received really made the night great.

Thanks Dana!"}
{"text":"The Henry is the perfect restaurant. 

I was blown away by every aspect of The Henry. It's so beautiful inside, every detail is perfect and it's so spacious I could not get over it. Fox group could have added an additional 50 tables, but instead they left it open and it's just perfect in every way. 

The food was exceptional from start to finish. I won't bore you with the details but it was all amazing.  In one visit- I had to reorganize my list of favorite restaurants, with The Henry at the number one spot, it is incredible in every way. 

I look forward to many figure visits here. Amazing job everyone!"}
{"text":"Fun, great vibe with wide open spaces.  Because of the very high ceilings, it can be a little noisy/hard to hear, but there are quieter places toward the back.  Lots of seating.  Could use a few more tea selections (not everyone drinks coffee!).  Great location and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Wow! went to The Henry last night to check it out. The food WAS amazing. There were eight of us so we literally ordered every appetizer available and  the wild mushroom  tortelli as well to try. All of them were great, really delicious. My entree was the star of the show however. A pork chop that was both smokey and succulent atop spinach and a cauliflower polenta that was out of this world. The pork was Niman Ranch the best meat you can buy and you could tell !!  The service was spot on.  It was very noisy in there but we were seated next to the open kitchen .I am sure there are more quite sections. I  highly recommend The Henry and  cannot wait to go back and try some of the other enticing options on the menu."}
{"text":"Truffled tater tots here are amazing.  And I'm not just saying that because I was drunk and it was some various hour of the early morning.  The tater tots came out piping hot and with a good truffle flavor. I just wish there had been more of them!"}
{"text":"I'm giving The Henry props for taking a group of thirteen of us on a Saturday for a bridal brunch without reservations. We had about a half hour wait before we were seated, which was fair. And they ushered us to a quaint little secluded corner of the restaurant, points! I ordered The hash and eggs, which was ok. I wasn't crazy about the taste however the presentation was nice. I also ordered a specialty bacon bloody Mary which ended up being way too spicy for me. The server graciously took it back after I expressed this to him and replaced it with a wonderful champagne. The service was top notch. The overall experience was pleasant, that in itself would be worth returning for."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers, probably one of my favorite burgers in the valley.  The burger is really juicy and the bun isn't too thick.  I hate it when places use dense buns with their burgers.  I want to fill up on the actual meat and toppings, not on flour.  The burger comes with grilled red onions and in my opinion, that is a no-no.  I don't like red onions cooked at all, I personally think they should always be served raw.  They will easily do this for you and I am sure if you wanted grilled yellow onions or what not, they would do that for you as well.  The place is very nice inside but you can still go casual here.  I haven't had the breakfast before but it looks like a happening place for it.  They have excellent service as well."}
{"text":"Trash... the bartender \"cat\" is a snob who doesn't know what Benedictine is or a post vs pre prohibition old fashion but told me he can make it any way I want, I told him which bitters to use and he said it normally comes with orange juice, and by that time I knew it was time to move on, I am a craft cocktail expert and like them a specific way and if you can't make them like that I'm fine ordering beer, he wanted to make it seem like he knew what he was doing and that I didn't, but whatever helps him sleep at night, the chicken and prices were decent but service was the worst so 1 star"}
{"text":"The most amazing happy hour. This place is gorgeous, has amazing food and amazing drinks. It's the total package. Our server was incredible and sitting on the patio even in the winter was amazing. There are heat lamps and a huge fireplace to keep you warm and toasty. Seriously everything we had for dinner (guacamole, Caesar salad burger and Korean tacos) all had a flavor that was like any other restaurant! I highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Another great find in Phoenix.  Came here for brunch on Sunday. Nice, open decor, friendly attentive wait staff and a great fresh and diverse new American menu. I have the quinoa tacos, came stuffed with a roasted corn and black beans, cotija cheese, stopped with a smoke avocado guac -- so yummy; side of delicious white bean salad.  Hubby had the triple decker club sandwich, fresh ingredients and delicious. Sis had the bagel sandwich with smoked lox, cream cheese and all of the accoutrements.  Great salads and variety of soups and sandwiches.  Can't go wrong with this restaurant."}
{"text":"Decent food and decent prices...

The Henry was our \"sobering up\" choice this past weekend after a day of drinking on the strip.  We ventured in for an early dinner at about 5:30 pm and the place was not busy at all...just a few other patrons...which was nice.

We ate at the bar and had an awesome and friendly bartender serve us.  I didn't get his name (young, bald, cute), but he really was great.  The service is also fast.  I ordered the chicken Caesar salad and my husband had the salmon.  My husband really enjoyed his dish.  Mine was good, but could have used a bit more seasoning in the dressing or chicken or somewhere???  The croutons, however, were almost life changing...so good!!!  The prices were about average...not cheap, but not expensive either.

I would suggest The Henry to anyone looking for a quick, but non fast food bite to eat.  I will most definitely be returning to The Henry on my next Vegas visit!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for my friend's bachelorette celebration. It was our first time. The place is rad. Very elegant, but not overly elegant if you get what I mean. They have some killer coffee! I liked the chai/coffee drink. The service was great-very friendly and attentive to our needs. The server gave my friend a complimentary dessert for her special night. It was delicious. I'll be back. I recommend putting in a reservation ahead of time. It can get real busy!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday and Sunday while staying at the Cosmo because it was so amazing the first time we had breakfast here, we just had to have it again! I had the steel-cut oatmeal with soy milk and strawberries -- an absolutely huge portion that kept me full until dinner time. Service was excellent, staff was great and the food was delicious. Will definitely be coming here again on my next Vegas trip since vegan-friendly food is hard to come by in sin city!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and usually order a cheese burger with french fries. It's always very good, good quality beef, good burger overall. This is why I've come back so many times with my fiancé and several family members. Service is usually pretty good although we've had one who wasn't the greatest. Great atmosphere in the Cosmopolitan hotel and casino in Vegas. It's basically this casino's cafe and I highly recommend it if you'd like to eat good food without waiting to get in."}
{"text":"I usually have pretty great service with Fox Restaurants but this one was really disappointing. We waited 2 hours for a booth for seven people with a server who didn't seem pleased to get us drinks and took forever to check in with us. A few of us had to go to the bar to get drinks since he didn't come over for a really long time.

When we finally were sat, our server was not up to par. It took 10 minutes to be greeted and she seemed disinterested in checking on us. I'm not sure what happened because normally Fox restaurants are pretty good about service (I used to work for one and they were super strict with training us). We asked a few questions on the menu after ordering a second round of drinks and she had to leave and check on a menu item. When she returned she said the Bolognese was out of pasta but we could order with the kids mac and cheese noodles that aren't house made. A few of us were fine with that so while she took our order she must have had a realization that it didn't sound correct because she said she would be right back and then told us once she returned that actually the sauce was sold out, not the noodles.

The food was amazing (loved the Ahi dish) but we were disappointed the Bolognese was sold out at 7:30pm after waiting 2 hours to be sat. No managers ever visited our table and she didn't seem to notice, or care, that we appeared annoyed with the poor service.

4.5 stars for food taste and quality and 2 for the poor service. I've dined here a few times and never had great service so finally decided to write a review."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, okay food, slow service.

While the restaurant was beautifully designed, the experience was certainly not worth the price. The servers were incredibly slow and the food was honestly just OK. I would recommend it for a drink date or coffee but that's about it."}
{"text":"The Henry is a great place for anything. If you are looking for a meeting place for business, enjoying time with friends, or just someplace nice to sit and get work done - you can't beat it. The food is delicious and the staff is very friendly and willing to help out with special needs/requests. Morning/noon/night - they are ready to take care of you and make you feel right at home."}
{"text":"Almost an hour wait for a table after being told 35 min. 30 min wait for the food to arrive. Food was good but not good enough to outweigh the slow service and the high price."}
{"text":"I think I'm in the minority of people who feel that The Henry is a bit overrated. Don't get me wrong, it's fine. I've never had a terrible experience here... but I've also never had a mindblowing experience either, and have been here probably half a dozen times. I'm usually a huge fan of Fox Concepts, but this one just kind of underwhelms. Also, there's just something about the tagline \"The Greatest Neighborhood Restaurant\" that really grinds my gears, specifically if the neighborhood is hoity-toity Arcadia. 

With comfy leather booths, mid-mod inspired chairs, and large wooden tables, The Henry pulls off a sophisticated look without being overly pretentious. The restaurant space is huge, stretching much farther back than you'd ever imagine looking from the outside. The most recent time I was here, we were celebrating a friend's birthday so our large party was placed in the test kitchen for a little more privacy. I didn't even know this room existed, but it was awesome being back there and getting to peruse some cookbooks and magazines while dining at the massive marble counter. 

My service here has always been pretty standard, nothing to write home about. Everyone is always nice enough, but there are always little things with each server I've had--this ranges from being a little slow despite a not-too-busy restaurant, to some light confusion about fairly simple requests. Totally not a huge deal, just follows the \"middle of the road\" feelings I have about this restaurant. 

I've mostly been here for brunch, and have tried a handful of the menu items including the Le Pig Sandwich, the California Scramble, and the Original Egg Sandwich. Pro-tip: ask for the Original Egg Sandwich on a croissant and with havarti instead of american. It's probably my favorite breakfast entree, which is telling, considering it is a pretty basic breakfast sandwich that you could get most places for half the price. It's always good, just maybe not $11 good. I feel the exact same way about the Truffle Parmesan Fries. $11 for french fries is actually absurd.

Generally, I'll just opt for a coffee and a pastry--the saving grace of The Henry. Their coffee bar, while a smidge pricey, is excellent and has wonderful pastries as well as great espresso drinks. The fella loves that they have gluten-free options for him, and says the bundt cake is one of the better gf desserts he's ever had. I love the Brown Butter Caramel Roll, though it does feel a little bit like you're just eating diabetes. But paired with black coffee (also superb here!), it's perfect. I'm also a sucker for chocolate and almond croissants, and both are great here. 

I have no major issues with The Henry, I'll just never be the one to suggest coming here. It's pricey for the perfectly fine food that you're getting, so I guess you're largely paying for the environment. However, I am always a fan of a quick coffee and pastry stop."}
{"text":"Another Fox disappointment. First of all the design of the restaurant is convoluted. It is a mix of formal and industrial elements that just give you an uneasy feeling. The turkey French dip was not worth the price. The French fries were limp and mushy. The prime steak sandwich was a bunch of beef strips on a bun. The meat was tender but lots of sinew and grisle.

Not a good value. Try wallys across the street. Way better and not a corporate restaurant."}
{"text":"We had brunch at the Henry during a recent visit to scottsdale. The ambiance is nice and the service was great but the food was okay. The brunch menu sounded pretty good but nothing was excellent. We ordered a bunch of different pastries to start, a seasonal veggie scramble, the egg sandwich, 2 egg breakfast and quinoa breakfast burrito. The burrito and egg sandwich ended up being the best dishes but weren't anything amazing."}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Las Vegas, my party and I decided to try The Henry since it was conveniently located inside the Cosmopolitan. The wait wasn't bad; maybe about 15 mins. The place is pretty spacious. We ordered the...

Signature Short Rib Benedict - $20
Chilaquiles Style Scramble - $17
House-made Maple Granola - $9
Chicken Sausage - $6

Overall, the food was decent. The short rib benedict was good. I wouldn't say this is a must-try sorta spot or anything but if you're looking for breakfast & it's not out of the way, you could check it out."}
{"text":"Ate here 3 times during our stay at Cosmopolitan. Once during lunch upon arrival and twice after going out to the clubs. The place was pretty decent every time we went. The service was good, but nothing over the top. Prices were somewhat high, expected being in such a nice property like Cosmo. The food was actually very good. I love that they give you options to get tater tots in substitution for anything that comes with fries. I always prefer the texture of taters vs fries, so it definitely worked out in my favor. 

Their French Dip is awesome and their burgers are extremely good. Breakfast items are OK. I'm no expert in beef, but their burgers must be made with some high quality beef, it was amazing! 

Looks as if this restaurant is 24 hours a day, so it would be perfect for anyone looking to party out at Marquee or someone who is partying right there on the property."}
{"text":"We stay at Cosmo quite often and Henry's is a go to place for breakfast. I prefer it over walking to he Bellagio or even the Buffett at the cosmo. This week I ordered the California omelette with egg whites. It was cooked perfectly, not to crispy or brown and it had bacon, avocado, tomatoes, and I added fresh jalapeños! The avocado added a lovely flavor and even though I passed on toast, it held me all day until dinner! We love to sit at the bar for quick in and out service too!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  The service and the food and the drinks are top notch!  The Fig & Ginger mule is one of my favorites, with Spring 44 Vodka, figenza fig, lime, pomegranate and ginger beer!!!  The food is just as great too with many choices."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you're starving. Went there with a group of friends after spending the day playing in a softball tournament. We were all starving and were hoping to have a nice meal.
When we got there, the place was not very busy. It took the waitress a long time to come take our drink orders. The food took a very long time to get to our table and was very disappointing. The burgers were dry and tasteless, the chicken pot pies had absolutely no flavor. If you don't mind having the awful taste of truffle oil, I guess the truffle tater tots are ok.
Overall, I would not recommend this place to anyone. There are much better eateries."}
{"text":"Here's the skinny: food, good. staff, bad. Hence the rating. 

Where do I begin? I came to the Henry last night with my mom for one of our last dinner in Scottsdale's. Everyone had been hyping me up so much about this restaurant, so I was ready and hungry and willing. First thing, made an 815 reservation that they \"did not have in the system\". So we waited for about half an hour before the manager came over to assist. Meanwhile, there just so happen to be no seats at the bar or in the waiting area so we just stood there in the middle of it all. 

By the time we got a table, I was ready to leave. But, that all changed with the short rib potstickers. OMG. Top 5 thing I have ever eaten. I ended up getting the roasted chicken (so juicy). 

May return; staff won't keep you coming back but those potstickers......."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot in Cosmopolitan, its hard to find a decent breakfast on the strip so this place really stands out.   Their version of the corned beef is very good, great coffee as well.  Gets busy though if you go at peak times."}
{"text":"This place is stylish & swanky, love the Moscow Mule!  Great service atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast at 10:30, a little more than half full, would have expected impeccable service, but was sorely disappointed.  I must say that, at least for breakfast, the menu os fantastic.  The food did not exceed our expectations.  Overcharged, but the waiter politely corrected the bill.  Very slow service after the meal was delivered,  in fact we were totally ignored with empty water glasses, coffee, and mimosas until we begged for our bill.  It was \"service by committee, with at least five different people bringing food.  Didnt know who to hols accountable.

Menu - 5 stars
Foood -  3+ stars
Service - 2 stars

Host was excelent and very accommodating

Likely to return for breakfast: yes.  I think they can do better and wiill give some other items on the menu a try."}
{"text":"Recommend smoked salmon sandwich. Omelets are good, service are good. Will come back if there's another visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious and filling brunch is just what was needed after a long night. 

I ordered the \"your choice\" breakfast. It comes with an omelet (your choice of 3 ingredients) potatoes and toast ($17.) I opted for ham, spinach and tomatoes with egg whites. Hubs went with the eggs and hash which comes with toast ($17.) 

The food took 20 minutes. The portions are large, food was fresh and tasty. They didn't skimp on the ingredients in the omelet, it was packed. Their house potatoes were phenomenal. It was grilled so it had a crunchy outside with a cheesy warm and seasoned inside.

I love the assorted small new jams and jellies that are served along with the whipped butter. Of course we tried all of them. 

Chuck was our sever and did a great job. He made sure to keep my coffee mug ($5.) and our waters filled. 

Our total with tax was almost $43. it might sound high but it is comparable to the surrounding restaurants prices."}
{"text":"The food is good but overpriced!  Service is okay.
I ordered the salmon entrée the other day for lunch and although I enjoyed it I felt $28 was definitely overpriced I could've had the salmon on a Caesar salad and that would've been $22 
I live in old town Scottsdale I can go anywhere in Scottsdale pretty much and get a good Caesar salad with salmon for $16-$18 max
We also could not have a conversation without raising our voices as it was so loud in there and we have eaten there three or four times and the noise level is all the same though I know we had a 12:30 PM reservation for lunch this time around so we were in the middle of the noise for lunch but it was still just absolutely ridiculous 
I also didn't appreciate that we were put in the side small table squeezed in between couples on both sides of us and because I had to raise my voice so my husband could hear me a couple next to us could hear everything that we said and the the man sitting to my left even commented on something that I said is if we were all there together for lunch which I found unnerving 
I really didn't feel like we had any Privacy at all and I'm sure if we would've had a little more quiet in the place or at least not the noise level at the level it was I wouldn't of had to raise my voice and my neighbors to my left would not of heard our conversation 
I don't know how that can change 
I'm sure it's the way the building was built and the acoustics of the building and it is unfortunate I doubt that I am the only person that feels that way and in fact my husband and I are sure that we are not in the minority when it comes to noise pollution
We do like the coffee shop area and that short menu and have frequented that as well
We will probably return but try to pick a time when the volume is turned down and I'm not sure when that will be 
But not going there for lunch on a Friday - definitely the wrong time if you want to have a conversation
It would have to be a special occasion for us to spend that extra money"}
{"text":"I can't express how much I love this place. I have had nothing but amazing experiences here. The Henry is upscale casual and I never feel awkward if I am running in in my workout clothes or dressed up for the night. The bolonagse is unbelievable , the short rib potstickers are life changing."}
{"text":"Be sure to ask for Shane!  He was very acccomadating, friendly and offered yummy recommendations.

I met w group of friends for dinner and everybody enjoyed it.  For starters, the grilled shrimp cocktail.... my goodness....it was the best I've ever had in my life.  It's definitely something you can't live without.  Grilled, smokey, and perfection.  Didn't need cocktail sauce.

I'm not a lengthy yelper but please try this place.  It's awesome in so many ways."}
{"text":"Always a solid breakfast spot with bonus of being open 24/7. Ate here twice while staying at Cosmo with music at the neighboring bar being too loud for our 1am late night snack."}
{"text":"BEST breakfast in Vegas!!!! And I mean it!!!!
I think I only at breakfast out once this past trip out there as I opted most mornings to get to the pool early for a chair while munching on some Quest Nutrition bars I packed.  After a few days at the pool and a nice sunburn, I opted for less pool time and a nice breakfast.  
I took pictures of most of my food to post along for my yelp reviews, but kicking myself that I didn't photograph the beautiful omelet I consumed here.  Actually, all of the omelets looked amazing and I'm sure if you browse the photos there will be some in there!  

I got the California Omelet accompanied by a bloody mary - both very good! It also came with a side of toast (I got sourdough) and hash browns. The omelet was stuffed with bacon and guacamole (not so much chunks of avocado) and super filling. We were seated right away, our service was great...I highly recommend this spot for breakfast or brunch."}
{"text":"We originally come here because we saw on yelp that the lobster sandwich looked amazing and sadly they don't carry it anymore. Very disappointed. The waiter said they change the menu frequently. I had the French dip, it was alright. The tater tots were very good though. I probably wouldn't be back, there are far better restaurants in Vegas, but that's just my opinion."}
{"text":"If you want somewhere to go for lunch or dinner, that isn't going to break the bank and you can go in wearing casual clothes and get decent food, then go to The Henry.  When the 4 of us walked in at 6:30pm, we thought for sure there was going to be a line and probably not be able to get in.

Nope!  Sat us right away.  We all had a cocktail (they have decent beers too) and ordered a light dinner. 

Ordered-
- The 'Wedge'
wedge of iceberg, crisp bacon, pear brulee & pt. reyes bleu cheese dressing.  This also came with chicken on it.
BRILLIANT!  It wasn't crazy filling, it was perfect!
- The Henry- hearts of palm, marinated baby beets, slow roasted tomato & crumbled goat cheese.  She asked for the goat cheese to be omitted (and it wasn't!) but she said it was good.
- Roasted Free Range Chicken Breast
smoked gouda mashed potatoes, market vegetables & pan jus
There wasn't anything left on his plate!

They bring out delicious bread sticks before your entree- yum!

I would definitely go here again for a quick bite to eat!"}
{"text":"Steak salad was blah.. tough steak and warm cherry tomatoes.

Friend had a smoothie and it was warm too...

It is pricey too."}
{"text":"Just returned from a shockingly mediocre dinner.  Am really angry to go to a restaurant that used to enjoy a great reputation, and now has me rethinking of ever returning.  I ordered the Poke, and it did not resemble any Poke that I have ever had.  Yes, the Ahi was fresh, but it was just slices of ahi tuna with sticky rice and Ponzu sauce.... Not what I anticipated.  My husband ordered a hamburger and told the server that if it doesn't come out medium rare, it will go back.  It went back 3 times.  If you can't properly cook a burger, then don't offer it.  I can make a burger perfectly at home, why can't they?  That chef should return to cooking class 101 or take a lesson in BBQ to learn the tools that are available to make a simple burger.  The fries came out warm and soggy, not hot and crisp like we requested. We order truffle fries and they came out as plain fries.  The darling, and lovely manager was mortified by what happened, and she picked up a great part of our tab, but that is not the point.   We went out for a simple dinner with friends, and got plain aggravation.  The restaurant was not busy like it used to be, so maybe this isn't an isolated incident.  Our friends ordered a pasta dish that was luke warm and a salad.  Service was not anything to brag about.  The manager, as I mentioned before, was the most professional.  She apologized numerous times, and Ajira should be commended for her diligence in trying to right a very wrong evening. She tried.  The molten chocolate/peanut better dessert was the best thing that came to the table tonite, compliments of Ajira ( I hope the spelling is close)!"}
{"text":"One of the best places in Vegas to get some breakfast. This restaurant is located inside the Cosmopolitan hotel. The portions are huge and can be shared family style. I love their French toast! It tastes sooooo good especially with some strawberries and syrup!

The service is also impeccable. They were really quick in their movement, checked up on us at adequate times and refilled our drinks on time. 

This place is open 24 hours so it's amazing if you have the munchies."}
{"text":"Went there with family for a Saturday brunch at 11a.m. Made reservations a few days ahead of time, which helped expedite getting our table. Several of us ordered a Bloody Mary, which was divine! The Bloody Mary prep guy could have had more personality and generally been more friendly (because seriously, what a cool job to have), but oh well.  We ordered several different things off the menu and everything was tasty. The atmosphere was very lively and fun. Some people were dressed in workout clothes and casual, and some were fancied up a bit. Diverse crowd, which was nice.  All in all, my only wish is that they had more gluten free options, but regardless I will for sure be back."}
{"text":"They were out of the mac&cheese fried balls that everyone raves about on here, so I didn't get to try. Tater tots remind me of the school days, they were fine - but nothing I was too impressed by. Service, on the other hand, was great, and the decor was beautiful. I'll probably return if I stay at the Cosmo again, otherwise a place easily forgotten."}
{"text":"Fox does it again!!!!! So if you are not familiar with Fox Resteraunt Concepts and you live in the \"Valley of the Sun\" I demand you get with the program. I have been living in Seattle and missed out on the opening of his truely chic  new lil  joint. So after bebopping round the city with my Real Estate Agent (see reviews)  He took me here for lunch. What  a treat. I mean it was lunch and I literally had a salad and a drink, but OMG did I have a great version of an old classic and a delectable drink! So let me start with the decor... This place is drool worthy. Sumptuous robins egg blue leather stools, and mustard gold leather chairs (button tufts... SWOOON). Mixed with restoration hardware style worn bomber leather couch/ banquettes, a good mix of raw wood, open duct work, subway tile, and the Phillip Jefferies Rivet Grass Cloth wall paper.... YASSSSSSSSSSSS! Perfect mix of classic and Industrial. I see you Fox...  I SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE you!. I swear I wanna marry the mans brain he has created a team of Master Chefs and Designers that cannot be touched... You are all Gods and Goddesses in my eyes... Now the food I had a brussel sprout ceasar with chicken. the brussel sprouts were cooked to perfect and chilled to a crisp, tossed lovingly, at least in my head,  with a cousin to romaine  called lil gem, radicchio and a very classic ceasar dressing. The chicken on that although grilled tasted almost like it had been smoked over wood so whatever you did there was just brilliant with the brussels. I immediately gravitated to the orange hibiscus cooler for a drink... I mean I am a sucker for hibiscus, but there was no room for disappointment... I literally asked for a to go cup... and I do not know who this Hank who creates this is, but he is a GOD too. I cant wait to come back and test out an espresso from what looked to be the Bentley of Coffee Machines. My agent had a Seared Ahi salad, and although I cannot attest to the taste, I can tell you it looked like was cooked exactly how Ahi should be...  I LOVE YOU FOX RC!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for brunch on Sunday. I appreciated that they still served breakfast items at 2:00pm in the afternoon. And the options were great - everything from basic eggs and bacon to delicious sounding french toast. They also have a great cocktail menu.

To drink I ordered their twist on a bloody mary - it was made with garlic vodka and basil. Very yummy! And for an entree, I opted for their signature short rib hash. The short ribs were perfectly done - super tender. And major props for the eggs being perfectly done too - just the right amount of firm and runny. And my date wouldn't stop raving about whatever it was that he ordered.

The service was slow - and it wasn't busy in the restaurant at all. But the food was great enough that we didn't really mind.

So based on the brunch experience, we will definitely be returning to try out other menu items.

And I really liked the atmosphere / decor too."}
{"text":"Delish! Came here for sunday brunch and snagged a spot at the bar. Service was great. Had some tropical cocktail and the fig mule, both were great. Popovers with ham butter are super tasty..and come on...ham butter! Shared the chicken fried chicken and the biscuits were amazing. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I had the short rib bennie. I was disappointed in the flavor as the ribs and the eggs were bland. The potatoes were also not very flavorful.  The chicken fried steak and eggs were amazing though, and our waiter was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Awesome place, awesome food!
Is there gonna be a next visit? Definitely!

Food: Good
Price: Good
Service: Good

{"text":"The Henry is absolutely beautiful. It just makes you feel special just being there. If it was my last meal, the bread pudding from the Henry would be part."}
{"text":"Aesthetically this place was gorgeous! I was so excited when I walked in yesterday! The manager does a great job of walking around and checking on you. However, for such a lovely restaurant the service was below par. I'll leave names out, but I had to ask for my water 3 times. I also had to remind him several times for a glass of wine that I ordered. He was very slow and he would come up to the table to ask if would need anything completely spacing anything we were already waiting on. We voiced to him and he said he had a huge party in the back. So apparently they were getting the good service. He should have relinquished us to another server. We did eventually (and kindly) mention our service to the manager. In response we got a \"thank you for letting me know\". You can draw up your own opinion here, I'll just say first impressions are everlasting. Only other thought is that the menu wasn't too extensive. Not much to choose from. Again, I did however enjoy my meal and the restaurant itself. Better service and we're in business."}
{"text":"A good breakfast spot.  They have all the basics, and it's loud enough that a small group of noisy kids can do their thing, without anyone really noticing. :) 

One small mix up on our order, but they were quick to fix it."}
{"text":"We went to celebrate a birthday and had reservations still had to wait 25 mins. The waitress took so long then they took our utensils after our appetizers so he had to wait until we saw her again. I was very disappointed I go there a lot and now not to sure I'll be back anytime soon :/"}
{"text":"We've been here many times but I never got around to writing a review. Came here for brunch today since we slept in and didn't feel like heading to the gym. Figured we would also get our flights booked for Cancun while we were there since we had the maids at our house cleaning. 

We both got the pineapple & passionfruit mimosas. They were yummy but I think I prefer the traditional mimosas. Always nice to get something you haven't had before though. Brian also got some espresso - needed the caffeine to start his day. 

For my meal, I went with the spicy sausage scramble - it had spinach, zucchini and and deliciousness (I honestly can't remember because I annihilated it). It came with some breakfast potatoes. I was craving breakfast food while my boyfriend wanted a lunch entree. He got the turkey French dip with French fries. The French fries are bomb and the truffle aioli is definitely a nice dipping sauce. I'm a big fan of truffled anything. 

Coincidently, we were seated next to a table celebrating a bachelorette party. I believe it was the mothers that showed up a little later and there weren't enough seats at their table for the 2 of them so Brian and I moved over to another table so they could be with their party. We found out that they wanted to pay for our tab because of our gesture to switch tables. My boyfriend is from Philly and he sure does love his sports - we found out that the lady who wanted to pay our bill has a daughter who's father-in-law is Ron Hextall (GM of the Philly Flyers). 

Small world! Plus, our server grew up in Philly/NJ. She was very friendly and seemed to be a great server. I wish I could remember her name. 

I apologize if this review was more about us instead of the food but I had to share!"}
{"text":"Went with Misses Beautiful for Happy Hour. Great atmosphere and food. Service was ideal. Has the guacamole, tacos, toast and popovers. I loved the guacamole, Misses B liked the tacos. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"HELLO FOX RC!    First of all, um, The Henry rocks. 

What I love about this place: When I walk in everyone is dressed up either like they spend their Sunday sitting in lounges like Mad Men or they just left church. Either way, I'm digging it. The decor is wonderful, it's a Mad Men era-esque style with a modern vibe. 
 
Call ahead, seems like breakfast on the weekends gets busy and you need a reso.

They have a juice and coffee bar with danish and other delights available for eating in their sofa / lounge / community table area if you don't want to wait. Full menu isn't avail there though.

Service was a little slow but it was 10 AM on Sunday, and who's in a rush anyway?

My friend had the moscow mule (it comes in the correct copper mug), it looked awesome. I wasn't drinking, only having coffee, but their bloody mary cart looked cool and had infused tito's vodka selections.

I ordered the egg white turkey swiss omelet but with the whole egg, not just the white part. LOL. Also I had the fresh grapefruit juice and aforementioned coffee + cream. Very delicious. Breakfast potatoes came on the side. 

Not a huge menu but definitely something for everyone. Looks like they have good sammies and salads too. 

Will most definitely be back. :D"}
{"text":"The first time I dined there they had just opened and I remember the menu being more upscale- I believe I had ordered veal or something. On my recent stay there, I literally ate here at least once a day. I can swear on a bible that they don't make fresh coffee after brunch- seriously. I kept coming back for coffee at random times so I noticed this over the week I spent at the cosmo. I highly recommend the Lobster club, the tater tots are the BEST. I never thought I would like childish food this much! They are made with truffle oil. I also liked the Latte, but they can't make Caps. Also the henry breakfast was very good. Hum- I also enjoyed the grilled cheese, but believe me, if you eat here you won't be hungry until the next day. Skip the so called fresh squeezed OJ, its not. The staff was AMAZING and the hostess is a sweetheart. Basically, I'd say its a casual male oriented environment. They have a large picture of a horse with the hair of a woman- I'm an artist, I get it, but come on I'm trying to eat here. Also a great place to people watch and meet guys. But I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here. It's nice that it's open 24hrs, especially when you are at Bellagio and don't want to go to far for a diner."}
{"text":"Definitely not a place I'd normally eat at but it was a solid breakfast to have before we left Vegas. It was also nice because it was practically free. We had won credit because of a swipe with our player's card. Woot!

I had the French dip with tater tots. Very filling. I had half and took the rest to go. Fiance had the hash and eggs. He ate his right up. I forgot to take a picture. Service was good and attentive. 

Overall not sure if I'd come back on my own unless I had credit again. There's just so many better (and cheaper) options to eat brunch at in Vegas. Um Chinatown or the Cal anyone? LOL"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, upscale decor, and has a good feel inside.  A little concerning is the fact I've never seen this 24-hour eatery busy when we've passed by.  Granted, we tend to go to Las Vegas during the weekdays and are seldom there on weekends.

The service was excellent and the food excellent.  We didn't order anything too difficult or fancy... just the house burger (caramelized onions, mushrooms, melted cheddar on a soft roll) and fries, along with the fish n chips (with homemade tartar sauce).  Definitely one of the top burgers & fish n chips orders we've ever had.  It arrived piping hot and the burger was exactly as ordered (well done, but still juicy and delicious).  The pickles that came with the burger reminded me of the homemade kind my grandmother used to make many years ago -- sweet, tangy, delicious.  They weren't your standard bottled dill pickles at all.

I hope more people discover The Henry at The Cosmopolitan.  It's off in a corner, features booths and a relaxing atmosphere.  Combine that with great food and service, and it's certainly worth a try.  Glad we did."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite restaurant inside the cosmo hotel, but this time around I was dissatisfied with the slow, and bad service. The breakfast burrito was a big slop on my plate that cost $17.00, and had no presentation. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while scrolling for some bomb brunch places. Had no expectations as to the quality of the food here, but turned out to be one of the best brunch places for eggs benedict.

Service: 
- quick, polite, and attentive

Food:
- Short Rib Benedict: try this before anything else. No English muffin on the bottom, just hash browns. Short rib was tender and pulls apart easily. Poached eggs poached perfectly.

- French Toast: fluffy, smooth, and perfect for the sweet tooth. More fruits needed, but other than that, will definitely give you food coma.

Drinks: 
- Rosé All Day: sweet and perfect mimosa to pair with your brunch selection. Fruity and fizzy to cut through the heavy meal you're eating."}
{"text":"Fox does it again....

You might like this place. I thought it was really good. The atmosphere was different and what I would call comfortable elegance. I felt as if I was nestled in a nice library in someone's home. Love the high ceiling. Kind of an odd location but once you're inside you forget where you are.

I had a chai lemonade ginger soda. Be sure to stir it up before you drink. Food was also good. The owners go out and pick their own tomatoes for the salad I had! I also shared the turkey French dip and it was fresh and fabulous.

I liked it because there is a full beautiful bar dining and sitting area on one side and then on the other side it is  more of a coffee soda bakery kind of environment.

HH everyday 4-6.  Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner. Also a coffee bar and pastries open regular business hours. 

What I found to be a little wonky was the open space on the very far west side of the establishment. Very different atmosphere. There is a television where you can watch sports. There's lots if empty tables scattered awkwardly and brighter lights.

Food for though Fox... You might consider having live music in that area...... Perhaps a coffee house featuring smooth jazz or acoustic, Spanish guitar...Plenty of good musicians looking to play for their supper, perform and be heard by patrons out for an evening of relaxation.

Or maybe you're transforming that area into a pizza parlor .....keep on truckin'....;-)

Overall with the exception of the far west side of the establishment The Henry is definitely worth a look. Parking can be a little precarious but can be found. I can say with confidence you'll find a space to settle in at The Henry.

{"text":"I ate here every morning during my last venture to Vegas.  They have a nice selection of choices for breakfast.  I could hear the staff bickering a bit to each other as they walked by or whatever and sitting close to the kitchen exit was kind of annoying due to all the servers constantly flying out so close to me and the seating in that area wasn't great either, I felt like I was a spectator at a Nascar and the servers with constantly clip my chair or the back of my sweater.  Whatever, this place had a great value for being in the Cosmopolitan, highly recommended food spot if you're in the Cosmo.  Ask for another table if you're seated near the kitchen/bar."}
{"text":"Limited menu options. Cocktail style setting. Neat, but not for just dinner with family. Drinking and social atmosphere. Neat experience and beautiful decor."}
{"text":"Omyyummness!!!  This was my first time eating at \"The Henry\" and this won't be my last time! At first I didn't think it would be worth the drive from Goodyear, but when I tasted the first bite of my \"Smashed Avocado Toast\" , I was in love!! The bacon was cooked to perfection with a crisps in every bite The atmosphere was chill and that made me want to stay longer.  C'est Si Bon!!"}
{"text":"I've dined here several times and while it's good - it's nothing special. I would say typical of what you will find at most resorts in an all night cafe, salads, sandwiches, chicken wings/tenders and some all day breakfast items. Good, consistent comfort style food"}
{"text":"Love this place for brunch with friends or a business meeting. Coffee is good, service is attentive, and food is stellar. Great location and lots of outdoor seating to enjoy the fall/winter AZ temps"}
{"text":"Very long wait to be seated (45 min). Very long wait for food service (30 min). Menu was not extensive. Friendly waiter. Blue crab quiche had 3 flakes of crab and a side of human hair. Corned beef hash unremarkable. Burger was good. Waitstaff replaced my hairy quiche. We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Love Henry's for everything they offer. I've been twice, for brunch and for a weekday lunch. Both times service has been great and the quality of food/drinks has been tremendous. Great ambiance and place to be at for any time of day. Highly recommend making a reservation as it does tend to fill up. We had the Smoke Norwegian Salmon, the Guacamole, Harvest Bowl, Tuna Poke, and the Smashed Avocado Toast. All items were delicious and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Great place to dine if you somehow end up drinking and are hungry after a night of dancing. The food was delicious and the service was great. My only complaint was that the tables were so close together that I felt I was also dining with the people next to me. Yes it is a little pricier but you are dining on the strip in the cosmo, you won't be finding a dollar menu here. Highly recommend if youre in the area and want the most amazing breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Had to stop in for their Signature Short Rib Eggs Benedict! I'm not a big fan if beef in the morning, but this just melted in your mouth. Service was good for the morning and I was pleasantly surprised how busy it was. Definitely will come back again. Really impressed with many of the Cosmopolitan bars and restaurants."}
{"text":"First time dinning at The Henry, and it was not what I was expecting. So I was at the Cosmopolitan this last weekend, having a great time with friends, and at the end of the evening, after I dropped them off at their room, I wanted some breakfast. I asked around and was told The Henry was open for service (This was roughly around 5:30am) So I found my way towards the back of the Cosmo property to where The Henry is located. 

When I got there, I was surprised there was nobody standing at the entrance waiting area to seat you. Instead, I just walked past the entrance, and sat myself at the bar. There was one couple at the bar, and the bartender was having quite the conversation with them about his life in New York, why he moved to Vegas, and all the shenanigans that come along with that (Yep, I've got great ears to overhear convos this late in the overnight LOL)

About five minutes after I sat myself down I made eye contact with the bartender, upon which time he looked at me like I was there begging for something. He asked if I wanted something to drink, I said \"Yes, water please.\" Thereafter, he got me a glass of water and asked if I'd like a menu. I told him I did, and he handed me the menu and off he went on his conversation with the couple.

After reading the late night menu, I beckoned him to let him know I was ready to order, at which time I went ahead and ordered The Henry Breakfast - 3 scrambled eggs, sausage, roasted potatoes and toast. Little did I know that for that it was $18.50. Good god that's up there in price LOL. Where did the days of a great breakfast for under $5 in Vegas go? LOL

So about 15 minutes later I get served the breakfast by a server. All the while, I believe the bartenders name was Alex (or Mark, one of those two,) the bartender was still chopping it up with this couple instead of tending to a customer. The breakfast came with toast, and I noticed there were no jellies or chutneys anywhere around me, but realized that some of the tables around did have them, so I got up, and got my own jellies for the toast that came with the breakfast. What I couldn't find was any ketchup (for my roasted potatoes) so I had to 'disturb' the bartender again, so he could get me some ketchup. They had the ketchup in these little metal jars inside a fridge under the bar tables. So I had that at my disposal and thoroughly enjoyed my breakfast, once I had everything I needed to enjoy it. 

The sausage had a great taste to it, wasn't burned, and the potatoes were these small rounded baby potatoes, which I prefer to sliced roasted potatoes. The bread was meh, at best, but overall, the breakfast was a good one. This would have been a 4-5 star review, had it not been for the lack of service/attention by the bartender. That is not how you treat a patron, regardless of time of day. There is a reason you work in shifts, so you're alert and attentive to your patrons, regardless of time of day, in a city that does not sleep, like Las Vegas. 

I wouldn't return back here, unless someone was paying my way for a 3 course meal."}
{"text":"Parking lot and not valet
The grilled asparagus appetizer was very good
We got the Quinoa tacos and added salmon so it was $11 + $8 = $19 (See photo)
That was a better deal than the Skuna Bay Salmon. Both were very good but the Quinoa tacos are better deal.
Service was also excellent"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast and dinner. Breakfast was better then dinner but both were over priced for what it was. Cool place and nice atmosphere. Patio looks amazing but it's been to hot to use it the couple times I have gone. I would say try it out at least once."}
{"text":"Darn good.  Everything we had was good. The artichoke toast as an appie is a must!!  
Nice patio, big fireplace.  Really great place!"}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast recently.  Had a business meeting and Michelle in group sales took my reservation even though I called the wrong number.  When the size of our party changed, Sarah cheerfully changed it.  We arrived early and were seated promptly.  Service was good.  Food was lovely."}
{"text":"Best prime rib in a long time! 

The dining room has a warm but masculine vibe in rich brown, greens, golds. Hints of plaid, argyle and leather makes you think that Henry is a dapper fellow. The dining room is adjacent to Cosmos poker room so there's ample people watching to be done if that's your thing.

We wanted a quick quality meal and that what we got. Prime rib was a lovely mid rare. The au jus and creamy horseradish also good. Nice baked potato and veg on the side. My dining companion proclaimed her meatloaf massive, but hot and tasty, and the creamy mashed potato was her favourite part.

Staff were friendly and attentive.

I'd go back next time for the all day breakfast!"}
{"text":"Awesome place to people watch. I stopped by for a few drinks and sat on the front patio facing Camelback. Really fun to watch beautiful, fancy-looking people come in and out of the place. I called ahead about happy hour and was told 4-6:30 $5 wells and $2 off cocktails, wine and beer. Turns out it was just 4-6pm and $2 off draft beers and wine. But the wine list doesn't show which are on tap so good luck with that.  My waitress also tried to convince me we that ordered a round of drinks after the 6pm cutoff. She gave some attitude and made it seem like a big deal having the manager make the price change.  Unfortunately for her, I had closed another bill at the bar just after we had ordered said round of drinks and the time stamp was 5:52pm. I circled that time on the receipt and left it with my tip. 

I was really liking this place and she kind of ruined the mood for me. I told her I wasn't trying to be cheap ($2, no big deal) but I like to receive the correct price for something I order and not be lied to about it.

I've yet to try the food but will update this review once I make a return visit."}
{"text":"The desert is so good, and the service here is awesome.
I'll recommend the chocolate peanut butter molten cake with a up of Latte."}
{"text":"Amazing...The ambiance, the service (from the hostess to the bar to our server Rose...) And the food were all amazing. I highly suggest the kale and artichoke dip to start. We walked in on a Saturday afternoon without a reservation, had a ten minute wait at the bar, which was fine and they got us seated as soon as a table opened. A fabulous brunch find and we look for to many future visits now that was are here in Phoenix. Thank you for a windy experience."}
{"text":"The Henry is right across from the lounge, Bond. 

We came through on Sunday night to have dinner at 9pm and there was a PARTY going on at Bond. The DJ was in full effect & the gogo dancers were in on top of the tables. 

That's all fine - but the music is so loud that if you are having dinner at The Henry you really can't hear you friends at the table or our waiter. We asked our waiter about it and he said it was really use to it but when he goes home his wife is always telling to stop yelling so loud because he's so use to talking over the music. 

The food is fine - like \"nicer\" 24 hour hotel restaurant food but nothing special. At least the prices weren't that bad....for Las Vegas at the Cosmopolitan."}
{"text":"Amazing food and great atmosphere! Highly recommend the Short Rib and the Skirt Steak. For appetizer the pot stickers was amazing, and for dessert my favorite was the pear basque cake."}
{"text":"This place always makes me laugh because it seems like everyone that walks through the door is chic and attractive. Usually I don't frequent that type of trendy hot spot but the food and service is always stellar and consistent, so I dine here often. My favorite is to grab the quinoa burrito and coffee for breakfast to go (pro tip, get an extra salsa, as each serving is just enough for each burrito half). It's a bit pricey but you kinda have to expect that considering the location and high-end ambience. Good spot to see/be seen/enjoy a delicious meal."}
{"text":"Came here for a glass of wine.

I like the high ceilings and the couches and chairs in the front.

The bartender was very nice.

The glass of Pinot Noir was great with a generous pour.

I ordered the kale dip appetizer. I should have listened to the bartenders suggestion and gotten the burger instead.

The kale dip was strange. 
Tiny pieces of Kale (blended I assume) with some milky cheesy substance that reminded me of cream of mushroom soup. It had a sweetness to it I couldn't place as a specific spice. The pita bread it came with was soggy on the end so that combined with the cream of mushroom type dip was sort of... Gross. It didn't even have a dip consistency but rather was like a thick soup. Double gross. 

The bartender upon hearing my unenthusiastic response to the dish offered to get me something that wowed me which I appreciated but nothing else looked good to me at that point. 

I guess I ordered the wrong thing.

Oh yes I almost forgot. No one acknowledged us when we sat near the couch. We got our own drinks from the bar. But later we realized the people next to us were being served drinks and we had been overlooked. So that was huge gap in service since we sat for a good ten minutes before getting our own drinks.

The coffee bar looked inviting. That said there were definitely people around that looked and acted rather snobby. Luckily they were balanced out by others who seemed down to earth and friendly who were enjoying meals.

Parking was tight.

Not sure if I would come back.

The menu had some pricey items that I hope would be more impressive than the Kale dip."}
{"text":"The breakfast and coffee gets 5 stars, but the restaurant gets 1 star. Love love love the coffee drinks and all of the pastries and breakfast items. I've been here several times, and have tried (I think) all of them and have not been disappointed yet. The restaurant, on the other hand, is gross. I cant find a single thing that I like. It's also very crowded, to boot."}
{"text":"A local took us to The Henry while on a business trip and it was a great experience. The ambiance is so classy and romantic, but also great for anyone. I had the bolognese with added short rib, incredible! We also enjoyed the delicious pot stickers appetizer. I also recommend their hand crafted cocktails. A must see/eat if in the area, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Interesting menu and drinks. Lively with inside/outside dining. Wait staff friendly and accommodating.We go regularly.........."}
{"text":"Just another thing the Cosmopolitan has done well.  We stopped in for breakfast on our way out.  A lot of space to stretch out after a long night.  They serve a quality cup of coffee.  The service is sharp - and attentive.  And the Huevos Rancheros with steak is a tasty lump of food.  Among the better breakfasts I've had in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My ribeye was better than I could expect i just wished I ordered it more rare.  They are really spot on with the doneness!  So order exactly the way you'd want it cooked.  The truffle oil tater totes weren't very truffle-ly sadly, but they were very nicely fried and crispy!  Our waitress provided excellent customer service.  It's just too bad the restaurant is inside the casino area... i couldn't stand the amount of smoke i had to inhale especially considering there were 3 men just standing 10 feet away from our table conversing and chain smoking their lungs to the grave!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and was shocked to notice I've not reviewed. I've tried so many things on the menus and have never had anything that wasnt terrific. Fresh ingredients and they always have unique twists that work perfect with their items like clementine and pistachios in the guacamole, pastrami on a pretzel roll, banana gelato with chocolate peanut butter molten cake. Not the same ol', humdrum food. 

I've been here when they're swamped and today they were quite busy, but the service is always the same. Genuine, welcoming and quick. We were seated immediately today, but, if you have to wait for a table, the drink service will make the time pass so fast. You'll forget you were waiting. 

The short rib potstickers are a must try in my opinion. My favorite salad is the ahi tuna salad. The Brussel sprout Caesar is a close 2nd. Their coolers and signature sodas are great too. 

Speaking of drinks, they have a fun cocktail menu with lots of beer and wine options. Then there's the coffee bar. Either way, you won't be disappointed. 

Sam Fox does a great job creating his concepts and hiring people great that deliver the experience. I just wish I lived closer. I would be a regular for sure!

P.S. I love the spoon tie clips!"}
{"text":"The Henry is good but almost a little over rated. 
It's like the stuffy version of olive and ivy. A little too uptight for me vibe wise and I come from Scottsdale so that might be saying something. The food is great though. I've had all the salads and the cheeseburger. If you decide to go I'd stick to the cheeseburger it's just like a Big Mac (but healthy). And the pasta with cream sauce tastes amazing. Brunch is fun here but again I'd stick to an olive and ivy brunch where you can have more fun staff wise and demographic wise."}
{"text":"Let me start off my staying I am NOT a big fan of Fox \"concept\" restaurants. I find them to be rather trite and pricey for the quality of food. I would not normally choose a Fox restaurant but my husband had a gift card so ....there you go. 

I got off work a little early so we decided to try The Henry for their early Happy Hour (3:00-6:00 pm). We walked in to this large, open concept type of seating area. There was a coffee bar, sitting areas with wingback chairs and settees, dining booths and a regular bar. We stood there awkwardly for a long moment, looking for the host/hostess station.  When we were finally greeted the hostess explained Happy Hour was limited to the bar, patio or lounge area (comfy sitting areas) which was already full at 3:30! I spied a gorgeous fireplace on the patio so we were seated there 

I loved this patio! The oversized brick fireplace had a nice fire going. There was intimate seating all around. I'm not on the tall side so I found the seats to be a little too deep to comfortably recline and relax. 
Lighting overhead consisted of Edison light strings with misters attached! Very clever idea. Nicely trimmed shrubs lined the fence to block out some of the traffic noise and add to the intimate garden setting. 

Our server, Lalo, was perfect! He was polite, friendly and didn't hover over us asking \"is everything tasting good?\" every 10 minutes! Gosh that irritates me. He just seemed to have a great sense of how long to leave us alone before checking in. 

We enjoyed a couple of cocktails (hubs had beer) and took our time to linger over the menu.  I had the Fig & ginger mule and Peach & pomegranate mule. Both were good, but unfortunately the ginger beer overpowered the other flavors.  My husband was disappointed that they didn't have at least one whiskey-based cocktail in the happy hour menu.

Since I am so indecisive about meals, we generally go for a smorgasbord of appetizers to share. We ordered the white truffle parmesan fries, warm kale & truffle dip, Korean short rib street tacos and a burger to share. 

Admittedly, each dish was delicious. The street tacos were my absolute favorite!! Sweet and spicy sauce and tender beef. The kale dip was served with warm pita and lavash crackers. It was quite rich. The burger was good and large enough for the two of us to share. I was actually full so hubby finished it all. 

Overall, I enjoyed dining at The Henry. I would definitely go back for happy hour.
The dinner menu is pricey, like all Fox restaurants, but happy hour was just right."}
{"text":"Came here while in PHX for work. Actually are here twice. For drinks: order the Apple Blossom Punch - so good. All of the apps we had were great too, especially the truffle fries and popovers. For dinner? The scallops and sea bass were divine. Make reservations, this place gets packed."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot in Vegas!  Not that I've had enough of a sampling to be an expert on the subject, but I've been to The Henry twice and recommended to others with nothing but good experiences all around."}
{"text":"Honestly, I wouldn't have come here except that (1) it was stupid cold outside and I wasn't about to put on some clothes and (2) my friend suggested it, it was in the Cosmo...and yeah, that was that.

Despite the obvious Strip-inflated prices, there's actually some pretty damn good food here! Was dying from the night before, so that means the only option was eggs...which means I needed a damn omelet. Croque Monsieur omelet it is!

The one thing I actually realized was that this omelet ACTUALLY HAS EGGS. You know how you get an omelet, it looks like it just left the club drunk, and it's barely any egg with a bunch of stuff inside? Yeah, this omelet actually looked like a proper omelet and tasted like a proper omelet. Lots of egg and ingredients on the inside. I was actually pretty impressed.

Service was ok, I got my fill of water refills lol. Not exactly on the list of my must-go places in Vegas, but hey it gets the job done if you want to be lazy."}

{"text":"This places is super cute and a must for coffee snobs. It's like walking into a European fancy hotel at first with subtle shades of blue and mustard vintage couches. Swoon.

I had a large wildflower which was a vanilla based latte it was smooth and well made. The scramble was not that exciting for the price --forewarn the food here esp breakfast is a bit steep ...I would have liked the scramble to come with fruit and a piece of toast."}
{"text":"I have one favorite item for breakfast here and it's the steak and eggs. They've never overcooked my steak, which is pretty awesome. I don't enjoy chewing on cardboard and they've been great about getting the doneness correct so far. It's really more than enough for two people and after I'm done with my food, I'm good to go until (almost) dinner. Nice hearty breakfast.

And...the French dip sandwich with truffle tots is yum-a-licious, too."}
{"text":"I've always been wanting to go here every time I drive by it on Camelback and when I had time to go, it was definitely a great experience. The exterior and interior of the restaurant is amazing. I've only been here a couple times at night and I still have yet to go during brunch or during the day time. I ordered the Korean skirt steak on my first time and then the 4 time after that, I still ordered the same thing. It's just SO GOOD. The garlic fries here are pretty good here and I recommend sharing them cause it's a pretty big portion. I will definitely be coming here again, but I can't guarantee that I'll order something different, I'm too addicted to the korean skirt steak.

#CERTIFIEDBANGER"}
{"text":"My husband and I had heard good things about this place, but overall, left disappointed. 

ATMOSPHERE: We had a reservation on a busy Sat. night and were seated right away. Nice. The vibe here is trendy, relaxed, and NOISY. Cool, but almost impossible to have a dinner conversation...maybe the patio would have been better. Nothing wrong with the noise if that's the vibe you're looking for. Maybe just not for a date night away from the kids, where we actually wanted to talk. =)

On to the SERVICE. This was disappointing. We had an emotionless server, whom we rarely saw. When we had a problem with our food the manager should have handled it differently, but chose not to. A better people experience could have left me writing a different review and willing to give this place another shot. 

FOOD: We had the brussel sprout caesar salad to start. Not sure if someone accidentally threw the brussel stems in the salad instead of the trash, but that's what we were served. Chewy brussel sprout stems, mixed with radicchio and a few sprigs of romaine. 

Next we had the smoked salmon appetizer. This was spot on. Delicious. The potato hash underneath was just the right amount of crispy and salty to go perfectly with the smoked salmon. 

I had the blackened Cod entree. YUM. The sauce was so creamy and delicate, and worked nicely with the flakey cod. The \"blackened\" top was so good! I had asked the server for a glass of wine with dinner. The wine came just as I was finished eating (and I am a slow eater). 

The big miss was my husbands $47 New York Steak, ordered medium rare. It came out well done. We rarely send food back, but for $47, this steak better have been cooked to perfection - not hard to do. If we'd been at Outback (which we wouldn't be), cool. Let it go. But we expected more. He sent it back and we waited a good 15 plus minutes. I was long done with my dinner, plate cleared already, before they even brought his back out. We got a half-assed apology from whom we think was the manager. That's it. Wasn't expecting a free meal or anything, but something....even legit customer service would have left us feeling ok about the entire night. 

There are so many other places out there to try....don't think we'll be back here again. My tip to the manager is - if your back of the house can't deliver killer food, then the front of the house needs to make up for it. Neither happened here."}
{"text":"Even though I walked in utterly confused because there are like 7 things going on in one space, the Henry was a great experience. 
I sat outside with some friends and enjoyed the wonderful happy hour menu. I had the Cactus Blossom Margarita, which was delightful and the truffle fries. The staff was kind enough to turn the heaters on around us because it was a bit chilly. Genelle was a wonderful server and answered all of my questions. Great happy hour and great place to enjoy good company!"}
{"text":"So freakin good!!! Cinnamon French Toast. Sooooooo freaking good!!! There is nothing like it!! And the chicken fried steak. O m G!!!!"}
{"text":"Wow, this food was great!! I recommend the kale and garlic dip for starters. It's not heavy and tastes great with the bread and crackers. The Korean Skirt Steak was absolutely, wonderfully delicious (just amazing) so tender with a little kick and very filling. The Chinese Chicken Salad was fresh, light and the perfect summer salad. The Salmon Salad was incredible! Brussel sprouts, cauliflower, mushrooms and kale with a light lemon vinaigrette topped with a wonderful piece of salmon. Split a piece of the peanut butter/dark chocolate covered banana custard and you won't be disappointed. I'll be dreaming about this dinner until next time!"}
{"text":"Okay, this is a great new place.  Has the Hillstone vibe.  Beautiful furnishings, incredible staff.  Really, I mean incredible.  Our waitress was phenomenal, and one of the guys (A.J.) was extremely friendly, and knowledgeable.  There was also a guy named Doug that was very friendly and stopped by to say hi.

The pros:

1.  Really nice ambiance (great place to take your clients)

2.  Great staff (knowledgeable, energetic, and very friendly)

3.  Really good food 

4.  Fair and honest drinks ( a tad pricy mind you, but that is par for the course at a nice restaurant).

The one thing you CANNOT GO WRONG ON is the artichoke appetizer.  I am not lying when I say that is the BEST I HAVE EVER HAD, and I doubt anyone can top it.  It comes with an amazing cream sauce, and will BLOW YOUR MIND!!!

The cons

1.  Parking isn't the best, but okay.

2.  Main courses (limited selections (which I often think is a good thing, but compared to Hillstone - my caddilac of restaurants, it doesn't compare.

3.  I would not waste $28 bucks on the short ribs (which is what I ordered) - you get like two ribs and one was basically all fat - horrible value for the money).  

4.  I can'e be much more positive over what my wife ordered (the Chevy Chase steak sandwich), which was just okay and not worth advocating for (I n fact, I wish I could have charged it to the Underhills bill if you know what I mean)!! Maybe that's how they named it?   Hahahaha

5.  Sam Fox, the owner, was present, but he did not come by to say hi.  If it were me, I would take an hour and make the rounds.  

All in all, it is a good place, I will go back to sit at the bar, sip a nice wine, beer or cocktail, and order the artichoke appetizer.  To me, that's where it's at.  I will still take my best guests and business clients to Hillstone.

Have fun, and find your sizzle!

{"text":"We were celebrating my friend's BD there, so what can I say... Service is terrible. Our server was extremely slow. I got the salmon and when I was still working on it, server took out my plate  though my plate was almost full... and he even didn't ask me if I am still working on it, or advise me to take it to go... I have been surprised because I have never met such unpleasant service... By the way they took the full price for their meal. Then, there was confusion with checks... the servers didn't know how to create separate bills for each guests so we were waiting them for an hour to pay... The most stupid thing I've ever seen when they gave us a check  - they took CAKE FEE !!! One minute, friend of mine brought her cake for BD party and they should just cut it for each person, about 16 people. I supposed to see it as complementary service in \"upscale\" restaurant, but they took a fees like 2$ from each guest!!!??? Seriously??? For what??? for you to cut it? or for your dirty plates? OMG, it the worst experience in my life! BTW they included 18% tips in every check and didn't forget to create one more line - ADDITIONAL TIPS!!! I guess for most drunk clients. I'll never ever go to this restaurant and won't advise to anyone to go there. That's it."}
{"text":"Restaurant was slow and so was the service. Food wasn't great. 3 stars cause I like the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Over priced & the food SUCKED! We left hungry, the only reason they didn't get 1 star was because the service was fairly good."}
{"text":"The Henry is a wonderful place! It feels fancy and upscale without being stuffy. It's a perfect place for date night, meeting with girlfriends, a work lunch/chat. I loved the design and atmosphere of the place.The menu has vegetarian and gluten-free options, and has interesting healthy options. My favorite item was the brown butter salted caramel roll, which is like a normal cinnamon roll but way better."}
{"text":"I had breakfast at THE HENRY and liked my entree (Eggs Benedict) and thought my side (Potato Hockey Puck) tasted funny. I don't know why, I ate at it and picked at it and couldn't figure out what was in it that was off. Mystery...

Cool place and probably worth another shot.

3.25 stars."}
{"text":"The Henry is great!  I have always had a great time there and so have my friends.  On my last experience I had a little issue though.  Hence the lost star.  I could tell that the lady in the booth across from me was trying to steal my air.  I was reaching out and trying to gather my own air but she had really big nostrils and was sucking up my air like a kid drinking a coke on a hot day.  Other than that this place is great.  Please work on your other guests breathing.  thanks"}
{"text":"The Henry is one of my favorite fox restaurant restaurants. I really enjoy going to the coffee bar. There are lots of cool seating options. It's a great place to study, being work or a lap top, or hang out with a friend."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous! We went for brunch on a Sunday, there was a bit of a wait but it was well worth it. The atmosphere is delightful, very comfortable and the staff were all polite and friendly. The food was fantastic, delicious and excellent quality. The little coffee bar and lounge area looked super inviting also! I am excited to come back, happy to have found a new favorite spot!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing decor and ambiance; it's a big place with many interesting seating options and showcases it's chefs with an open kitchen. The wait staff are helpful in finding the right cocktail for you. The burger is very tasty as well as the truffle fries and the apple kale slaw. The brussel sprout cesar salad was good but a little heavy on cheese and dressing and a little monotonous without the protein option. Great food overall, can tell they make their everything high quality and fresh. I might rate this place $$$ instead of $$ just FYI. A shared appetizer, two burgers (cheaper option) and shared dessert with drinks and coffee for 2 was about $100."}
{"text":"Love the place. I never had a bad experience.  Food is great, amazing drinks. Reservation recommended."}
{"text":"The Henry seems to be the crown jewel of the FRC (I've heard their kitchen is the test kitchen for upcoming Fox Restaurant Concepts). This can be seen just from its outward appearance with its patio, and the tables lined up outside. Its interior is well made up with its classic contemporary look. There are couches in the lounge areas, and oversized booths with mismatched lamps, and the bar area next to the open kitchen gives this place a look of a true European Brasserie. I went on a recent Saturday evening that was abuzz with people, from the onset with the close to full parking lot, one can see this is the current \"it\" restaurant of Phoenix. It's great for people watching and it attracts a diverse crowd. 

I went with some friends, and it seemed difficult to order a drink from the bar since it also served as a dining area that left little room for bystanders peering through the seated persons in attempt to order a cocktail. They have a good selection of wines, limited beer selection, and their cocktails selection is not huge either but I have to say they are all superb. I had the white cranberry punch which was refreshing, a friend had the red stiletto (which to me tasted like cherry Robitussin *shudder*) that she enjoyed, as well as the Prayer Meeting topped with a cabernet float that was exquisite. Other friends ordered the Fig and Ginger Mule served in a copper mug *kudos* and the Pomegranate 75, and heard praises for both. 

Dinner was started with two appetizers, the cheddar popovers and the truffle fries. The popovers were good not spectacular but the butters served alongside were the stars of the app, actually the ham butter was the star, and the chive butter was good. I'm tempted to get the ham butter alone because it reminded me of liverwurst pate (the ham flavor was subtle and texture smooth). I ordered the Pork Chop although I was tempted to get the half Roasted Chicken because of the sides but I'm glad I got the Pork Chop because it was delicious. The bone-in was moist with flavor. The Swiss Chard served with the Pork Chop had good flavor and the Cauliflower polenta is something I will order again as a side because it was delicious. I made sure to save some room for dessert because prior to my dining experience at The Henry, I had seen a picture of the dessert menu someone had posted on Yelp, and although The Henry was a resto I wanted to try, my eyes were on the chocolate cake from the very beginning. Yes, I was disappointed it wasn't a slice (I was thinking it would be similar to the chocolate cake at the Parlor, which imho is still one of the best chocolate cakes served in Phoenix) but with the layered vanilla and chocolate ganache, this chocolate cupcake (served in a small jar) was enough sweet for two, it's too sweet because of the ganache but it is good but not something that I dream about unlike the Monkey Bread of Culinary Dropout. 

Overall, The Henry is a solid four stars, and I can't wait to go back either for dinner or brunch.

{"text":"Their coffee bar could use some improvement, the drinks sound great but most of them are terrible. They have a good variety of appetizers. I would highly recommend the branzino if you are there for dinner. The happy hour with music is a nice touch. There is also tons of seating."}
{"text":"Friendly service and good food combine to provide a pleasant surprise in the Aria. I had the fish and chips. The cod was flavorful, white, and plentiful. The dish was served with fries sure to satisfy your salt cravings. He had the veggie burger the likes we'd never seen. Actual chopped veggies held together with an egg, milk and bread crumbs concoction of some sort. The truffle tator tots delight. A good value for The Vegas."}
{"text":"another culinary fail for the cosmo.
i absolutely love this hotel but i'm so disappointed by the majority of their food outlet selections.

the henry is the cosmo's 24/7 food option.
we dined here late at night during one of our stays.

we ordered:
the fish n chips - $18
totally basic.
nothing special about the batter or the fish they use.
we've had much better at less expensive places.

build your own omelet - $16
the omelet was good.
was it $16 good?
no.
it came with truffle tots that had no truffle essence whatsoever and were definitely refried.
quite terrible actually.
a good tot = crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.
these tots were as hard as a rock thru and thru.
bleh!

deep fried mac & beer cheese - $12
crispy on the outside, COLD on the inside.
seriously?

the chefs at the henry need to take some lessons from the folks at tasty bunz!
they either don't know what good truffle tots and deep fried mac n cheese are or they simply don't care.
yes, i do believe there is an art to good fried food.

i'm more than willing to pay an arm and a leg for comfort food...
so long as it's good.
unfortunately, the henry is overpriced and underwhelming."}
{"text":"I visited this establishment on a Sunday afternoon. Very spacious! Apparently, they are open for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I did all I could to keep from purchasing a Danish! I love the large tables... Promotes socialization. I waited over ten minutes (in the lounge area) before I decided to flag down someone to take my drink order.  Which was the only one I got because waiter never came back to check on me.  I stopped another waitress to request my check. The original waiter brought it to me... Nothing said."}
{"text":"When you walk up, you see an open ambience restaurant with no walls in front. Blends in well the Cosmo's glitzy style. 

Very rich but relaxing setting. Beautiful speakeasy-style overhead lights. 

I had the Rose All Day and the Henry Burger. They were both amazing. The drink was surprisingly strong and smooth.

I went with work friends and we all enjoyed our food and drinks  (except one - she didn't love her drink and I can't remember the name darn!).

I give 4 stars instead of five because of the small menu. I would have liked to see more options especially some higher quality dishes. I was hoping for a filet, but there were no steaks.

Would have loved to see a larger drink menu too."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to eat here for a while but we live in Ahwatukee and don't get to Arcadia that often. We were up for a long run so we stopped in at the Henry afterwards. Had a wonderful breakfast. Between the three of us we ordered the spicy chicken sausage scramble, the quinoa burrito, and the egg White turkey omelette. Everything was delicious. I really loved the portion size. Small enough that we didn't feel stuffed at the end of the meal. The design of the restaurant is so beautiful I want to move in. Please Fox Restaurant Concepts, can you build something in Ahwatukee?"}
{"text":"Great food. Great wait staff. Kitchen is pretty slow. You're gonna wait at least an hour for your entrée.

Good thing they serve amazing drinks."}
{"text":"WOW!!!!
I am so impressed and can hardly believe this is a Fox concept. Most his restaurants are good, but this is GREAT! The food, drinks, atmosphere AND service are all excellent and come together to make a truly fabulous experience.
We live 2 minutes from The Henry and kept wanting to go and decided to drop in tonight for my boyfriends birthday... It is Saturday, it was 9:15 pm and we had about a 10 minute wait. 
We started with cocktails- I got the Fig & Ginger Mule and he got the Old Fashioned. They were both wonderful... It was so nice to have a drink in a restaurant that was balanced and perfect. Finding well mixed cocktails is not that easy in this city...
For dinner I had the Wild Mushroom Tortelli and he had the roasted turkey french dip. The Tortelli was fabulous- the sauce was flavorful and the textures in the dish were so balanced. The Turkey dip - OMG! Seriously, I don't know what they did to this turkey, but there was so much flavor packed into it it my tastebuds were dancing. 
Then we moved onto desert (we rarely get dessert, but couldn't resist after the outstanding meal) The Warm Croissant Bread Pudding- let's just say, it was worth every calorie!
Our server Matthew- it has been a long time since I have had really great service, it was so refreshing to be helped by someone who you can tell loves what he does. He was knowledgable, kind, helpful and just an all around great person.
Thank you for this one Sam Fox! You hit the nail on the head..."}
{"text":"We started with drinks at the bar, EXCELLENT bartender, Teddy. We got a table in the dining room and had a wonderful evening. Our servers name was Adam. (my wife said BEST SERVER EVER! ) THANKS THE HENRY! can't wait for brunch!"}
{"text":"Pros: beautiful decor, delicious mimosa's

Cons: open concept kitchen is loud, brunch food was okay, dinner food was disappointing, way overpriced

Many people I know rave about this place, yet apart from the decor, this place is very mediocre. I've dined here for both lunch and dinner. Though drinks were good, all members of our party found the food sorely disappointing - especially for the price tag. Didn't care for it - sorry!!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I ended up here for brunch on a Saturday. Had a GREAT experience there! Didn't sit in the restaurant but ordered from the coffee bar. A friend and I split a scone and the Spicy Sausage Scramble. Both were very delicious. The scramble was a little small for the price - but a great ratio of sausage, egg and vegetables. 

I ordered The Chloe for my morning coffee and I was NOT disappointed. It was sooo good. If I lived in Phoenix I think I would drive here solely for that drink alone. 

The ambiance was nice. We ended up in a room filled with causal seating and tables - many people working on their laptops. It was packed with a lot of people but the service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I chose Western Omelette sans bacon. It was quite a big plate with delicious vegie omelette with hash browns and your choice of bread on the side. Could have shared it with a friend if knew about the size."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst service I've ever received. My waitress maybe stopped by the table once. Very rude. The food came out cold. Overall overpriced small portions and rude service"}
{"text":"If I were not sitting here with an empty water glass and still feeling a bit hungry after having finished my delicious Wild Mushroom Tortelli lunch, this would have been a five star review. 

As I was writing this, I had originally put 3 stars, but then a manager just came to apologize for the small portion and to offer a complimentary glass of wine or desert for my disappointment in the portion size.  (I'm only 130 lbs so it doesn't take a tremendous amount to fill me up).

I declined the atonement.  Perhaps I'll give them another try sometime...as the flavors were fabulous!"}
{"text":"So delicious! The food is divine, the atmosphere is great, the coffee is perfect, and the cocktails are out of this world. 

Tanner is the best bartender there! He recommended the fig mule and my boyfriend and I were not disappointed. In fact, it has ruined all other mules for us because we can't find one in town that is as good. 

My coworker gets an iced tea from here that she raves about. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Probably average with the key exception of the chili that was just added to the menu. That is 5 star chili!!! Get the chili. Promise it's not an evil suggestion to keep you corralled in the Cosmo hotel rm bathrooms, but they are pretty nice. I really want the chefs recipe because it made my taste buds dance happily. Right amount of spice, the meat was just right - no weird chunks (hey I have high expectations when other people cook). Fiancé gave it his approval as well. Plus this food is wayyy better than the room service food. Worth the incremental effort to come downstairs."}
{"text":"- Bad Coffee. Espresso was very bitter (their machine is not adjusted properly) and not really strong. It seems impossible to find a place that serve good coffee at the strip. Starbucks is your best bet, but well, it's still Starbucks

+ The food is delicious and makes for a good breakfast. Usually it makes sense to put out a reservation in the morning unless you don't mind waiting for 20 minutes."}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  My fiancé and I came for dinner.  The patio was really comfortable  even on a hot summer night.  From the exceptional amount of well adjusted misters, the lighting, to the great background music. Easy to talk and very relaxing.  

We had the artichoke appetizer.  Which was great.  I had the braised short rib & my fiancé had the gemelli and black truffle pasta.  Both dishes were nothing short of exceptional.  Although I will say the gemelli has a slight bitter taste, from the red cabbage I think.  We also had desert. Peanut butter and banana for me and sweet peaches and Creme for Courtney.  Awesome as well.  

Portion sizes for all the dishes were on the medium size.  Which I happen to like.  Bottom line, service was great, atmosphere was great and I will definitely be looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"Oh em gee, I literally think that I could eat the Turkey Chopped salad every day and not get sick of it! It was absolutely delicious. The salad was loaded with turkey, tomatoes, grilled corn {the best part!}, asparagus, basil, avocado, blue cheese {I subbed feta} and the most amazing croutons. I came here to work today and loved the relaxed vibe during the afternoon, between 2-5. If you have a mobile workspace, I completely recommend coming here to work + order the Turkey Chopped for lunch!! I guarantee that your day will be productive! ;) Free Wifi too!"}
{"text":"I love the patio at the Henry. It's comfy, beautiful and really nice at this time of year. This time we just had sandwiches but included some of my favorite things there..fries with truffle oil, a kale dip that I could eat a bucket of...and a flour less German chocolate cake that was so good that we could split it three ways. Service is great and I plan to return next week! One of Foxes best eateries!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat while in Vegas! The pretzel cheese dip and the breakfast burrito are very good. Our waitress Kat was very personable and friendly! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Docking one star for the terribly slow service.

Located conveniently in the Cosmopolitan where we were staying, this was the perfect brunch spot to top off our Vegas Trip. We tried to go a day earlier but the wait for brunch was 45 minutes so we ended up making a reservation for the following day.

The food here is dreamy. They're also definitely not joking about the \"Big\" in the Big Brioche French Toast."}
{"text":"Great place, went for a dinner but end up with few 
Appetizers that were great.
First of all the place has a great atmosphere and good music.
The whisky sour was very good. We had the kale salad and the Brussels sprouts salad top.
As appetizer we had the asparagus& egg,the Brie toast and the Parmesan French fries Delicious."}
{"text":"Went to The Henry for breakfast in early January. Fantastic! Great atmosphere and even better service. Cody was our sever and did a wonderful job! For drinks, my wife got the breakfast smoothie and I went with the Cleo. Both great. For food, I ordered the fried chicken and biscuits. Homemade biscuits with fresh fried chicken and topped with an egg. Perfect dish, not overwhelming. The homemade biscuits made it. We sat on the patio which was great as well. Overall, great place for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Being a Fox Concept, we assumed it'd be competent though maybe not exceptional.  We were floored by how absolutely terrific the place, food and service proved to be.  This is an experience very different than typical Fox.

Korean skirt steak with tempura green beans atop curry rice is not to be missed.  Tried the wife's roasted tomato black bean chili which was terrific as well, though the Korean skirt steak is in a whole other league.

Club house margarita was terrific.  Mule was good, thought I'd suggest it needs more ginger beer since the lime overpowered a bit.

Croissant bread pudding was very yummy, didn't leave one bit of that.

The space is really terrific, quite refined w/o being stuff.  Will be back to try their coffee shop and breakfast too.

btw, might suggest reservations.  You might have a long wait if not unless you get a seat at the bar.  Lounge area is very nice, comfortable couches and chairs so that's a pleasant place to hang out with a drink and appetizer."}
{"text":"Loved it!  I definitely recommend the cinnamon French Toast. It was amazing. The perfect amount of sweetness. Not too rich, the flavors blended together perfectly. My husband had the breakfast burrito which he raved about and my son loved his omelette. He couldn't stop talking about how good his toast was. Great atmosphere and kid friendly. My daughter really enjoyed her chicken fingers. Great place for family brunc at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"This was an unexpected place to find a coffeeshop, it is just down the street from Carmel's. They have a few fun drink and baked good items on their menu."}
{"text":"A handful of us stopped by Henry's after our night at Marquee. We were all buzzin' and wanted breakfast. Steak and eggs all around.

The restaurant had a old steakhouse feel. Cushy booths and great service. 
Sadly, the food was just A-OK. My steak was cooked medium as I requested, but flavors were lacking. The eggs were not runny at all. I love a good runny yolk. I liked the fried potato mash, it was herb-y and had a crispy crust. Good stuff. 

But, overall it was just okay for a $50 breakfast."}
{"text":"Reccomendation: Get the Henry Burger with the Garlic Tator Tots. That's what I ordered and it was a five star rated meal."}
{"text":"Egg & cheese sandwich with a side of fresh fruit and a smile from the SUPER friendly wait staff. 

Now, I realize this sounds SIMPLE, however, NORMALLY when I order fresh fruit on the side, it's like one strawberry on the top with melons and then some more melons. No thanks. 

Their fruit had mangoes, black berries, blueberries, grapes and all kinds of other yumminess. I dig it.  

My girlfriend and I super enjoyed breakfast here - her favorite special item was the fresh grapefruit juice. I liked the overall experience, the food was great and so was the service."}
{"text":"I have eaten brunch multiple times at The Henry, and always get the two egg breakfast with HOMEMADE whole wheat toast... it's the classics done exceptionally well! I could eat a whole loaf of that bread... The food is always consistently good, and the servers are always friendly... just as a neighborhood restaurant should be! 

I just recently experienced dinner for the first time and had the Lemon Chicken... it was incredible! A fairly large piece of chicken thigh that was juicy, moist, and packed full of flavor. I enjoyed it with a side of broccoli and asparagus. 

I LOVE The Henry. And would highly recommend:)"}
{"text":"OY!  My mother would turn over in her grave!  Not because of anything bad but because The Henry's matzo ball soup is almost as good as hers!  And here we are at a trendy Arcadia restaurant.  Well,  mom, its true!  What a great place.  My head ached from turning around so much to look at everthing.  Amazing decor, something for everybody.  Whether you want a full breakfast, lunch or dinner, sit up at the bar, grab a danish & coffee, eat on the patio, or do business in the rooms set up for business and WIFI.  Our waitress, Dana, was helpful and guided us through our first visit (and it won't be the last).  Our Bloody Mary's were good and I had the matzo ball soup with the brussel sprout salad.  Perfect lunch before a movie.  But he best was the Prairie Breeze Popovers.  OMG.  They melted in our mouths.  I didn't partake of the dessert however, my friends had the bread pudding and said it was wonderful.  I held off on my 5th star for when I go to order a full meal.  And kudos to the ample parking lot.  Not usually available in that area.  Thanks again Dana."}
{"text":"Open late. Not too expensive by Vegas standards. Usually no wait. Inside our hotel.
We ate here too much during our stay because it was so convenient.
The food was ok. The service was good. Calm atmosphere. 
I'd eat here again, but mostly because it's quick when my blood sugar is low."}
{"text":"I love the Henry because it's great quality food which is open 24 hours, located at the Cosmo.

The ambiance is great, it goes really well with the hotel, cosmopolitan, vibe. The service was fantastic and the food was great.

I've only eaten here past midnight - trying out their wings, chicken tenders, and beef eggs Benedict. The wings and chicken tenders were very average, the tenders were a bit too tangy with the Buffalo sauce. The beef eggs Benedict is fantastic though.

It's great food to eat when nothing else is open at the Cosmo. It's my go to spot past midnight, but there are much better options to eat within the Cosmo and the strip during normal hours."}
{"text":"The Henry
One of my favorite dining buddies and I went for the last night of restaurant week - neither of us had been to the Henry before - and the menu looked fantastic. We have made a habit of dining together at least once each restaurant week - and find a place heavy on veggies or water protein (she doesn't eat anything that walks or flies), so we can share all courses and get a better range of the menu. The Henry had at least two veggie/fish options for each course - so it would work well for us.
For drinks, I ordered the Final Word (my current favorite drink, which I make at home quite often), she had the Old Fashioned.  Hers was perfect. Mine was a bit heavy on the chartreuse, so I sent it back for a touch more luxardo to balance it out - then it, too, was perfect!
For the appetizers, we split the salad (spinach, roasted beet, fennel, stone fruits, puffed grains, goat cheese, and pistachio) and the smoked salmon (potato hash brown, crème fraiche, and arugula). Both were good portions, both fresh and very tasty. The salmon was saltier than it should have been - almost like the chef forgot smoked salmon is already salty, and added a pinch too much as final seasoning. But the flavor was dead on, and the overall construction of the bite was fantastic!
Our entrees were the sweet pea tortelli and the salmon, served with quinoa, beets and arugula. The pasta was light and well made, the flavor rich and delicate, and the sauce was creamy without being heavy - the best part was the fresh sweet pea flavor in every bite. I'm not even a fan of peas, and I could have eaten a vat of this! The salmon was a bit of a letdown. There was nothing wrong with it, but it was just really average. The quinoa was stellar (if I could only get my version at home to be so good!), and I love beets in just about any dish - these were incredibly fresh and perfectly roasted.
Dessert was bread pudding and the lemon meringue tart. Both were well executed and worth enjoying every last bite of. I can't pick a favorite between the two - they complemented each other perfectly, along with a cup of fresh coffee. I don't think either would have been quite as good without the counterpart.
I liked the setup. It feels classic and comfortable; the patio will be fantastic in just a few weeks when the evenings are nice again. The tables and booths are large and spacious - and at a decent distance from each other so you don't feel you have to speak over the neighboring conversations.
The regular menu prices are a bit higher than they need to be (keeping format with the other Fox restaurants), but not so high I would decline an invite back. It may not make it to my regular rotation, but I will happily go back for more meals."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. After 2 hrs of dead ends it was the only thing we could find open on a sunday night to get some food believe it or not.  Little bit pricey though."}
{"text":"I had Beignets the first morning and the donuts the next morning. Both excellent. Bartender fixed up my mimosa with some strawberry  rhubarb juice that made it deli.  I was looking for a treat and I got it!!"}
{"text":"As with most Fox Restaurant Concepts restaurants, this one was tasty with a good atmosphere. I went for brunch on a Sunday with some girlfriends and we started with the Bloody Mary bar. Although I have had tastier Bloody Mary's (this one was a little more on the thin side than I prefer), you get to choose from 4 vodkas: onion and celery, bacon, and two chile flavored ones (I forget which). My only qualm with this process is that they have someone personally come to your table to make them and there's an unspoken expectation to tip (there is a tip jar with money). I completely understand why one should tip (and we did) but it feels tacky and frankly unnecessary--I'd rather just have mine brought to me like other restaurants. My own cheapness aside :), it was undeniably yummy.  I split the Prairie Breeze Cheddar Popovers and the grilled asparagus and poached egg with one of my friends and it was the perfect meal for the two of us because we were not overly hungry.  The grilled asparagus and egg dish was delicious---the egg was done perfectly and the asparagus were really flavorful.  My friends liked the Cheddar Popovers a lot but I think I had too high of expectations because they really just tasted like 'normal' croissants. Overall, I liked the experience and I'd go again but would try something else."}
{"text":"I guess I may have to accept the fact that I'm always gonna have a bone to pick with Sam Fox.  Once again, I step into a restaurant that hits a home run on aesthetics but falls short on the cuisine.  Its seems to be a running theme that I just can't shake with Fox's concepts.  Perhaps its all a matter of playing the expectations game, but for the prices they charge I would expect something at least somewhat worthy of the decor I'm eating in.  But like so many of Fox's other concepts, the food leaves me with one emotion.  Meh.

The Henry is a newer addition to the Fox lineup, set in what was an old office building in the super trendy Arcadia neighborhood in east Phoenix.  The building itself is spectacular.  Its a two story structure that's open from the inside (though the restaurant only occupies the first floor).  The restaurant is actually three parts.  On the west side is a banquet area for private parties, on the east side is the main restaurant and a great outdoor patio complete with a fireplace, and in the middle is a little coffee and juice bar.  The furniture and wall paper have a pretty contemporary feel bordering on English tudor-ish.  The place has been jam packed since it opened but fortunately we didn't have to wait long on Sunday (we got a table in just under 10 minutes).

The dinner menu of The Henry has no rhyme or reason nor any discernible running theme.  I did pickup the fact that they use mushrooms in a lot of their dishes.  Great if you love mushrooms, not so great since I don't care for 'em.  For an appetizer we got some of the grilled artichoke hearts.  I love artichokes, but these tasted pretty bland.  And there weren't that many on the plate.  Worse yet, it was $13 for that little dish.  We also shared the white truffle fries with parmesan.  Much better.  Fries were cooked well and the truffle aioli was excellent.  They also come with a super spicy ketchup (seriously, it'll surprise ya).  My brother had mentioned some good reviews about the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich (particularly the BBQ mayo that comes on top), so I got that for my entree.  The chicken was fried adequately, but I didn't pick up hardly any of the BBQ flavor I expected.  For dessert I got the blueberry pie.  This saved the night.  Blueberries with greek yogurt on top and tiny hint of lemon zest.  Good, clean, simple, delicious.  My family also shared the chocolate cake and bread pudding, but I wasn't terribly impressed with how either of those tasted.  To drink, I had their homemade mixed berry lemonade.  Super refreshing drink as it wasn't too acidic or overpowering, but the big downside was the absurd amount of pulp in my drink.  My straw kept jamming up because of all the pulp getting stuck in there.

So just to recap.  Five stars for the ambiance and the friendly service.  No issues on either front there.  But two stars for the food.  As with so many other Fox restaurants I've been to, I feel like I'm paying three star prices for two star food.  And the items I ordered tonight were on the cheaper end.  The women in my family can't seem to get enough of whatever Sam Fox touches, but my experiences have been habitually average.  For happy hour, I probably wouldn't mind coming back here, but I'd probably pass if asked to come here for a full meal next time."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for the price. If you are looking for a more upscale place to eat (after you are done with the buffet life) with some decent healthy choices this is it. 

The ambiance is great,.The hotel is beautiful... And the quality of food for the price is unbeatable. I didnt give it give stars because it (salmon) wasn't as flavorful as I prefer, but everything else still made it worth the price."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Fox Concept restaurant.  I couldn't believe it.  The place is beautiful and so far the food we have tasted has been amazing.  My husband cannot get enough of the Korean skirt steak.  I took a few bites and I almost wanted to order that.  I rather save my calories for the drinks and dessert.  The Fig and Ginger mule is my favorite, specially when Tanner makes it, although Christina did a really good job also.  I cannot have enough of the Croissant Bread Pudding, it is a diet buster, but so worth it.  Next time I am going to have the salmon appetizer, the person sitting next to us at the bar recommended it highly.  It looked delicious."}
{"text":"Okay, I am usually skeptical of the hot restaurant owner in the city and his or her concept restaurants. However, I was truly wow by the Henry!  Five stars all around for ambience, service, and quality of food.

First, ambience. I love that it feels like the den or library in someone's home. The lighting is soft, the music is not too loud, and the seating is extremely comfortable.  I particularly liked that if you don't have a reservation and don't want to wait, there are a series of sofas that you can sit at and still order from the full menu.

Second, the service. Everybody that I encountered at this restaurant was delightful. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted with a smile.  When I asked where the restroom was, one of the hostesses actually walked me to it!  Not only was the server nice, he was well-informed! Often, my food allergies require the waiter to run into the kitchen, but this guy had the answer to everything about every dish.

Third, and most importantly, the food. Every single thing that I ate was delicious. I started with a simple house salad that had one of the most delicious ginger miso dressings I've ever tasted. But dinner was an even bigger treat! It's really hard to wow with chicken, but the Henry did it!  The perfect balance of crispy skin and juicy meat presented simply with rosemary and thyme.  I was also impressed with the side of apple and kale slaw. I normally hate coleslaw and mayonnaise, but this combination was perfect. The sweetness of the apple countered the bitterness of the kale and the creaminess of the mayonnaise and finished off very lightly.

No room for dessert, but I will definitely go back and report back to you."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a breakfast of short rib and poached eggs.  Others in our group had everything from breakfast burritos to classic poached eggs.  No complaints by anyone. Conveniently located and great way to start our morning."}
{"text":"This place is a really cute place.The food is good so is their coffee. Also it's Instagram worthy  also if you sign up you get a free birthday dessert. There is also a patio where you can sit outside."}
{"text":"I was visiting Scottsdale Arizona from California and my partner took me here and met up with one of his friends for brunch. Love the ambiance, decor and vintage look. The walls and high ceilings and lots of natural lighting that makes the place looks open and bright. I would love to come back here again sometime. The only downside was the customer service isn't as quite pleasant. Server wqs always In a rush and not that friendly. Also, the food can be better as well as the eggs were a little burnt lol. I am willing to try this again, this time for dinner. Nevertheless it's a good experience just a little room of minor improvements"}
{"text":"You get what you pay for, great location in an awesome hotel. We had breakfast, it was perfect. Service was great and the coffee cups are huge. The food is quality and the presentation is on point. I had the avocado toast with smoked salmon, radish and caper to start. Then had the ham hawk hash with two perfectly poached eggs finished with hollandaise sauce. Roasted peppers, onion and a base of potatoes at the bottom completed the dish. Every bite was packed with flavor, very good dish and filling."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE !!!

Its small, not a lot of seats, but so so good. Did dinner one night. I got fish and chips and a Guinness, husband got pot pie. Excellent excellent. Service was good.

Did breakfast the next day. Excellent. 

The menu has a great selection. The food is really really good. Service is good. The location w/i the hotel/casino is nice ( faces the strip ). I really liked it."}
{"text":"After a 30.minute wait we were rewarded with fine food and good service. I had a breakfast burrito,  my dining partner had the California omlett. Well prepared and served promptly. A place worth coming back to."}
{"text":"A bit on the expensive side, but hey, you're in Vegas and you're in the Cosmo.  I was pleasantly surprised at my meal here.  Wait time wasn't too long for the large party we had and the place is pretty spacious and accommodating.

We came here looking for Fried Mac & Cheese Balls and a breakfast burrito (which they do not have), but most of us ended up with the Short Ribs Benedict, which was a hit for me.  I split half with a friend and you may think you wouldn't be full after a small portion, it is just enough.  It's really rich and the sauce is packed with flavor.  I definitely recommend it and seldom praise eggs benedict this much because I think it's hard to do it right.  But come here for the Short Ribs Benedict!  Splurge a little, and the price isn't that bad at all.

Service was attentive and the people in my party were impressed with how many cups the waiter and waitress could carry at one time.

Adding this to my Vegas hit list."}
{"text":"Great bougie brunch experience. Patio is well shaded and misted in the summertime. The Bloody Mary cart is a must try!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here last night for the first time with our 2 kids (age 4 and 6) and my parents for their anniversary. We love all the Fox restaurants and this one did not disappoint! 
My girls and I can't have gluten so I called she ahead to see if the kids Mac n cheese could be made gluten free and is the short ribs was. I was told the short ribs were gluten free but they had no gluten free pasta. The manager got on the phone and I asked if he could get GF pasta if I made a reservation this weekend. He said no problem, he would stop at the store on his way in on Saturday. 
When we arrived we all loved the atmosphere of the place. There was lots of outdoor seating and the inside was beautiful. It reminded me of Chelsea's but much larger, brighter and not as loud. They didn't offer any crayons for the kids but I always bring my own. We just asked our server for paper and the kids were happy. We ordered the Parmesan fries which were delicious. The kale salad was fantastic! The cheddar vinaigrette was delicious. The short ribs did not disappoint! They were tender and cooked to perfection on top of mashed potatoes. My dad ordered the steak sandwich and he loved it. My girls loved their homemade mac n cheese and our reservation was already noted to use GF pasta.  It came with broccolini or fruit. My kids got the broccolini and loved it. 

Dessert was delicious. My husband had the key lime torte which was gluten free so I had some. It was excellent. The salted caramel ice cream my 4 year old ordered was to die for! My parents enjoyed their bread pudding. Overall this place was really great! The manager checked in with us and remembered our conversation 3 days prior about gluten. I will definitely be coming back to this place! It's a great place for date night or to go with friends. Taking kids isn't bad either. We sat in a booth which kept them contained."}
{"text":"Yelped for best brunches in phoenix and picked The Henry. Specialty coffees and a tables idea bloody mary cart? Duh, of course!
Crossed my fingers that we could get in as I needed a reservation for the next day which was my birthday on a Sunday at 11. Open table let me book 6 and then I had to call the restaurant to add 2 more which they accommodated at 1115.
 Pulled in after Church at about 1050. Reservations were for 1115.  Adorable spot with beautiful decor. Parking is full so drive through to the back but it's free.  We waited outside and got seated at 1125 at a round table on the patio. Adorable. Not too hot and we were mostly covered.

Our server, Sara was a delight. Very enthusiastic and she knew it was my birthday. So sweet and helpful.  
One of our guys said to surprise him with a drink. It was funny because they forgot it and she joked with us that it was the surprise. The coffees were delish and most also had a brunch cocktail. We were informed that the bloody mary cart can't come outside up the stairs but I ordered a virgin spicy bloody and it didn't come halfway through my meal. When one of my friends told Sara, she apologized and got right on it. The lady came up and brought it at no charge. And the surprise drink for my friend that they didn't bring cause it had no protein powder was also on the house. Very nice.  They did bring an extra order of French toast by accident and said to enjoy it. All the food deliverers kind of mixed up the plates as they sat them down.  You should have seen my hubby's face when they tried to give him am omelette that looked healthy cause he ordered the carrot cake pancakes.
All in all, the food was good and even though so many little things went wrong...the service thanks to Sara was really great. 
Appreciate her putting up with us and even bringing me bread pudding dessert as a present.

Beautiful posh interior and high quality everything.
I'm glad I got to treat my friends to a nice brunch and we could see camelback pretty much Birdseye view across the street.  We went home and changed and climbed it! 

Great  birthday brunch."}
{"text":"This place is good for lunch and happy hour.  I didn't try the coffee but it was busy.  The vibe really isn't dinner, to me.  The rib pot stickers were really good."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Miserably bad service but the food is a solid 4 stars. 

Ordered: 
- Tator tot nachos: yum! I love tots and these were awesome. Obviously overpriced, but it is Vegas.
- Potato skins: also very good, but these are hard to mess up.
- (bf) Roasted Herb Chicken with Veggies & Mashed Potatoes: he enjoyed it a lot. Portion size was reasonable for the price and the chicken was juicy. Veggies were well seasoned. 
- (me) Cobb Salad with Grilled Chicken: delicious! I was really impressed at the presentation and size of this salad. Definitely one of the best salads I've had. Only downside was that they forgot to bring me dressing and it took another 5 minutes to get that to the table... eating dry salad isn't fun. 

Service here is very, very slow and inattentive. It took an absurd amount of time to get the waiter to notice us whenever we had a request or even to get the check. Prices are a little steep but still a decent lunch or dinner choice if you are staying at The Cosmopolitan."}
{"text":"The Henry is one of those places where the food isn't absolutely amazing, and can be on the pricier side, but somehow I keep coming back. The service is great, and the decor of this place is beautiful. It has that modern rustic feel to it. This restaurant is definitely perfect for brunches,  dates or dinner with the girlfriends.

I always start with the white truffle parmesan fries which is delicious. I've had the roasted chicken on their dinner menu which is good, but not amazing. All the salads are pretty good too, so are the cocktails. I am a bigger fan of their brunch menu on the weekends. I absolutely LOVE the spicy sausage scramble. The sausage and the zucchini and everything else they put in it just mixes well together. I took it home because it was a pretty big serving and it still tasted good as a left over. 

On the other side of the restaurant is the coffee area. You can't go wrong with their coffee either!"}
{"text":"The Henry is located conveniently near the entrance/exit of the Cosmopolitan hotel. I had breakfast at this restaurant when I stayed at the hotel and had the best experience ever thanks to the waitress that served us that day!

I heard great things about their Eggs Benedict and decided to test it out. Wow, the egg was perfectly prepared! Such a pleasant way to start the day off! Freshly brewed coffee paired perfectly with my food. *4 stars for the food.

Service was the #1 thing that I wanted to compliment about this restaurant. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much when I walked in, but the waitress made sure that my experience was pleasant from the start to the end. She made sure that my food tasted good, I had enough coffee and that I left awake and with a full stomach! I will come back here just for the service! *5 stars for the service.

Cosmopolitan hotel is such a elegant hotel, and I don't know if it's me but I don't smell the heavy and disgusting cigarette/cigar smoke when I'm here. Since the Henry is located near the entrance/exit, the bad smell of cigarette/cigar was hardly noticeable so I was fully able to enjoy my meal. Seats were pretty comfortable and I ended up relaxing here for about 2 hours (I felt bad afterwards for taking too long). *5 stars for the atmosphere.

I honestly wanted to give 5 stars instead of 4, however the only downside was that the service offered by the other waiter/waitress were not up to par with the waitress that helped me out. I may not have been impressed as much as I was if someone else helped us out, so to give a fair review I am going to stick with a 4 star for my whole experience. Rest assured, I'll be back here for breakfast when I'm in town again!"}
{"text":"Such a cute kinda quirky restaurant right by the casino in the Cosmopolitan. The wait can be kind of long for larger parties so keep that in mind. Wasn't sure if reservations were possible so we just did a walk in. The food was delicious! A friend in Vegas told me to try this place out for their eggs Benedict and it was tasty and well-seasoned. I had the tomato bisque with grilled cheese sandwich and oh my god I finally found somewhere that does it right! The bread was a little crisp and chewy yet soft and the mixture of cheeses was great and super melty. The tomato bisque had a little pesto drizzle on top and that was great and cut through the creaminess a bit. The beignet was more like a malasada or donut so that was definitely disappointing! My friends had the French onion soup and it was perfection! Cheesy, with a nice soaked bread, soup that wasn't too salty or overpowered with weird herbs! Definitely a tasty place."}
{"text":"Really flavorful food at a pretty decent price. It's located on casino level, tucked away on one of the far ends of the hotel, so it wasn't as crowded as the other restaurants that are clumped together on the 2nd & 3rd floor of the hotel, and the price was much better, too.

Went for lunch and the burger and lobster roll were quite delicious, not cafeteria-like at all."}
{"text":"Best place for memories!!

The first time I had been to The Henry was for one of my first date nights with my boyfriend. I was blown away by the ambiance and the service! I felt very unsure of what to order and I went with the Kale and Apple salad. Great choice! Another visit was with my grandma for brunch and we had a wonderful time! The waiter just loved talking to her and made the experience fun and friendly. My grandma tried the Roasted Turkey French Dip and she LOVED it! I can't remember what I had, although I do remember loving their berry lemonade. After this I can't remember how many other times I've been here for breakfast/coffee with my best friend to drinks at the bar with my boyfriend.

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came for dinner on a Sunday night and had a delicious meal. There's also a coffee bar when you first walk in which faces into the restaurant. The potstickers and artichoke toast are must must haves!!"}
{"text":"Oh my, I have just one word for this place: yumazing!  But reviews need to be longer so let me just say bacon, bacon, bacon, omg bacon, crispy bacon,  2 friends and I ordered 3 more sides of bacon, bacon.  The Bloody Mary cart was a unique feature.  Every dish we ordered was perfection, lox and bagel, French toast, brie toast, popovers, truffle fries, all so good.   As was the waitstaff.  Kudos to the general manager,  Kelly, for taking the time to make us feel so welcome.   Because of our central lcation @ table 13, I noted that it wasn't even special,  she really took the time with every table she can get to.  Highly recommend this spot."}
{"text":"my only complaint about the henry was that it was hard to find for us.  we came from the aria and there were no signs for the cosmopolitan from the aria.  and once inside the cosmopolitan there were no signs were the henry.  there was one sign that said restaurants but it pointed to an all saints store!

we had brunch here and i thought it was good!

the service wasnt bad but it wasnt stellar either.  

i had the soup of the day which was a prime rib soup with seasonal veggies.  when it came it was bright red so i was skeptical.  it was actually more like a beet and prime rib soup.  it was actually pretty good.  i had the henry which is just a normal breakfast of 3 eggs, a meat, and potatoes which i subbed for fruit. i asked for sausage links but im 50% sure they gave me chicken sausage instead.  i wasnt too picky so i ate it anyways."}
{"text":"We visited Scottsdale for our anniversary. The Henry was our first dinner out. A simply PLEASANT experience from start to finish with amazing flavors surrounded by passionate workers.

Our server made multiple outstanding recommendations and even helped steer us away from one that wasn't a specialty of the restaurant. Many servers aren't confident enough to do this.

We started with the short rib potstickers, which were a perfect appetizer. The richness of the reduced ponzu sauce played well with the hearty textured braised meet and dumplings. Fresh cilantro for some life, and the six portion was a perfect lead in to the main courses.

My wife had the mushroom paella w an add on of seared scallops. The layers of flavor were well balanced, mixing in earthy vegetables and a sweet and smoky profile. The scallops were exactly what you want out of a scallop: buttery, salty, and delicious.

I had the ginger glazed, seared cod. It was served with fresh roasted vegetables over a delightful coconut broth. The broth stole the show, so much so that my wife was dipping her scallops in it before long. The dynamic flavor of the broth, underscored by spice and ginger was so subtly delicious and of course the cod was fantastically mouthwatering.

We finished with the house special bread pudding, all scratch made with caramel ice cream. Everything was spot on time wise, and the patio space was inviting and relaxing. Do yourself a favor and indulge.

Only possible complaint was my cod serving size was a little on the lighter side, but I am a Midwestern man, so I think I was just missing my potatoes! 5 stars, go enjoy the flavors and polished ambiance!"}
{"text":"You MUST try their truffle tossed tator tots!  Holy yummy, Batman!  They haunt me...they also have gluten-free bread, which is awesome since I have Celiac's. Service is always great, the restaurant comfortable and clean, the food excellent. As a local, I rarely visit the strip but when I do I make sure to visit The Henry even if it's just for the tots!"}
{"text":"After another decadent Vegas night, I wasn't about to be up at the crack of dawn for some breakfast and there was no way in heck I was going to drive to dine at a ill mom n pop place despite high recommendations by my reliable Yelp buddies. I'm just too tired, too lazy and too dang hungry and nobody got time for that!

So I end up rolling out of bed at 12:00pm, brush my teeth and hobble down stairs for some much needed grub.  Just when I'm about to exit the hotel, what do I see? The Henry. Right across from Bond at the strip entrance. They serve a limited breakfast menu all day, I don't need to leave my hotel so that sounds good to me! 

The wait for a seat was a tolerable 5-10 minutes, and our server Billy, was energetic and friendly, albeit it on the frazzled side but he kept our coffees topped off and waters full, which was fine by me

He served up my coffee in a jiffy and since they proudly serve Illy, they get extra points!

We had to wait a bit for our food but it came out piping out and delicious! 

I highly recommend the breakfast burrito. This beast was packed with all sorts of good stuff: melts cheese crispy potatoes fluffy scrambled eggs and a side of zesty salsa and cool sour cream. 

We built our own burger with avocado cheddar and caramelized onions. I ordered a medium rare patty and it came out medium, no biggie. Oh but those truffle Tate tots were a plus! They were crunchy and had the most irresistible truffle aroma despite me immersing them in loads of ketchup! Yum

Both dishes were quite substantial so we decided to forgo dessert. We charged the bill to the room (hello identity points) and we were out of there in record time. 

Thanks Henry, you're the perfect cure for a Vegas hangover 

Happy Eats!"}
{"text":"I came here during my recent stay in Vegas and had breakfast. The staff was okay, not that friendly but in the end they got me what I needed. The food was good but on the expensive side. I had the blueberry pancakes and was very satisfied. The pancakes were light and the blueberry were fresh. 
If the prices weren't so high I would have defiantly retuned the next day."}
{"text":"The architecture of the restaurant gave a unique feel. The food was unique. I had the mushroom paella and it was loaded w flavors and topped w a bed of kale which was different. Overall, food was good and the service was as well."}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast 2 days in a row here. Lots of choices and great service. Enjoyed the natural omelet and my husband loved the corned beef hash."}
{"text":"Vegan options for brunch suck. The drinks are great. I really loved the venue and ambiance. I will go back for dinner to try some their vegan dinner options."}
{"text":"If you love European design and atmosphere then you will love The Henry! Developed by Fox Restaraunt concepts this is probably one of the most lavish and hoshposb coffee shop and eateries I've been in. Everyone is friendly the staff is amazing and the scenery is exquisite. The food being served here is next level stuff I'd expect out of a Michelin star rated restaraunt. Tons of plush comfy seating with several rooms in which to work from that look and feel Uber contemporary from a European sense. Basically your going to want to put this on your to visit list."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a large sign at the center top of the building, making the restaurant easy to find.  Because the door handles are in the shape of a round sign, we found the door difficult to locate.  Once we figured it out we were inside.

The inside of the restaurant is well lit and attractively decorated.  The restaurant was loud, but we could hear music playing in the background.  The temperature was comfortable.

DINING ROOM
The spacing between the tables was tight, but provided adequate space.  Our table had one chair and the other seat was a bench attached to the wall.  Both seats were comfortable and looked new.  The menus were clean and in good repair with no typographical errors.  The napkins, plates, glasses and silverware were all clean and appeared to be nearly new.

Short Rib Pot Stickers
The pot stickers were served hot, attractively garnished with sesame seeds, mizuna and a yuzu ponzu sauce.  The portion size was large and enough for two to four guests.  The ingredients tasted fresh and delicious.  This appetizer exceeded our expectations and will be one reason we will return to the restaurant.

Roasted Turkey French Dip
The turkey French dip sandwich was served hot with a delicious horseradish aioli sauce.  It was attractively arranged with a simple, but tasty salad.  The serving size was large and enough for one to two guests.  The natural au jus was enjoyable and complemented the turkey and havarti on the parmesan roll.  The sandwich exceeded our expectations.

Wood Grilled Burger
The wood grilled hamburger was cooked to a proper medium rare and delicious.  I was an appropriate size for one person.  The French fries were also enjoyable, but many of them were overcooked and burned.  I set them aside as I ate and was surprised that about one-third of them had been ruined.  While the hamburger was made from quality ingredients, I thought that it was slightly overprice at $13 and did not represent a good value.

Chocolate Ice Cream
The chocolate ice cream was a medium sized serving of rich, creamy ice cream and was a good size for one person.  It was served cold and had not melted in the dish.  The ingredients were of high quality and refreshing to consume on a hot day.  At only $3, we felt the ice cream was a good value for the price charged."}
{"text":"The place is hip (yikes!) and definitely fun, however the prices are a bit much for the entrees and the cocktails. Four cocktails for $57 (wth tax and tip) is a bit too much for my blood.

The service was very, very good however some of the apps were a little small for $12. Smoked salmon was an inch and half wide 4 pieces on toast. 

The cheddar popovers weren't as good as everyone claimed - they were dry and overbaked - too dark. 

The kale and spinach dip was okay but not flavorful enough for all the pita bread and crackers served with it.

The roasted brussel sprouts ceasar was okay - the brussel sprouts needed more heat - they were too raw and although the dressing was good the whole thing felt dry because of the finely powdered parmesan sprinkled all over.

The truffle fries was one of the best tasting apps we had (fries could have been a bit crispier) but $10 for a bowl of fries dusted with parmesan, really?

The short rib potstickers were the best app of all with regards to flavor.

We had breakfast here a few weeks ago and they were nice enough to split the entree onto two plates. It was very good.

Absolute favorite things here are the espresso and the salted caramel cinnamon roll made with croissant dough. The coffee is not cheap either but it is amazing. The espresso was a ristretto consistency so if you like that this is the place to get espresso!"}
{"text":"Service was slow. Not very busy. Food was mediocre. It was a last minute choice since we only had a little time before our show started. Considering all the food options in Vegas, this place is not one that I would choose again."}
{"text":"Food was fabulous and bartenders were great. Only negative was the hostess. Arrived at 9am w/o a reservation on a Saturday morning. Told it was a 40 minute wait. Optioned to sit at the bar. Noticed 5 open tables. Checked OpenTable and found there was plenty of immediate availability."}
{"text":"Whether I've been there for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, the atmosphere is always energetically sophisticated. Service is friendly and fast. (Although getting lattes takes a bit longer than other places). Food tastes fresh and moderately priced."}
{"text":"I have been to The Henry a couple of times, and dined last night. 

My server, Matthew, was very engaging, attentive and suggested the featured appetizer off the menu which was the Tuna Tartare. It was excellent and I was happy with the suggestion.

There are selective choices on the menu, but I would definitely recommend trying various appetizers vs. one entree to get a better taste of what the restaurant has to offer. 

They make sure that your dining experience is pleasant and that your accomodations are met which I really like."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! I came for lunch with a friend and received awesome customer service and equally awesome and much more delicious food! 

We split the mushroom cheesesteak and rueben sandwiches (about $15 each), which came with a side of your choice. We got yummy fruit, which was a cup of pineapple, raspberries, blackberries, blueberries, grapes, and a slice of orange. 

We wanted to share our sandwiches, and asked for them to swap halves on both plates. At first, our waiter (BILLY IS AWESOME!) said they cut the sandwiches in half, but it was busy, so the chefs probably wouldn't want to swap them on the plates, which was understandable. 

When we got our food, another gentlemen brought our swapped sandwich plates, which made our lives THAT much easier! 

Also, we didn't order any drinks, and Billy knew we needed a break from the night before, with much sympathy. He was super fun and really nice to talk with. (THANKS SO MUCH, BILLY!)

Totally down to come back next time I'm in town! :D"}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot especially if you need to get work done. The food is really great as well. The chop salad is very very good. The place has been around for a long time. Great lunch spot check it out !!"}
{"text":"Came here at 4 in the morning post-clubbing with one of my friends after we saw the wait for Secret Pizza. We weren't super hungry, so we decided to split an order. We ordered the breakfast burrito. The burrito came with chorizo, scrambled eggs, peppers, cheese, pico de gallo, and potatoes. Sour cream and  salsa were served to us as well. The burrito satisfied my drunchies (aka putting food in my stomach), but other than that it wasn't particularly delicious. It was just okay. I think I would only come back to this restaurant if nothing else was open and/or there were long waits everywhere else."}
{"text":"The braised short rib was cooked to perfection. Easily consumed without a knife. And the glaze that comes with it was delicious. The salmon dish is also cooked just the way I like it: crispy on the edges and tender throughout. 

The truffle fries with parmesan are just okay, a tad soggy to me. Compared to everything else the fries seem kind of like an after thought.

The artichoke toast is great but a bit on the small side (it is an appetizer after all). The peanut butter chocolate lava cake is rich and decadent, we substituted the salted caramel ice cream for the banana Gelato and thought it went perfectly. 

The drinks are good here, I recommend the Old Fashioned and the Pinot from the Willamette Valley."}
{"text":"When the ladies are still in bed & you are starving, fine dining is in order. Girls Trip on the strip. I love elegance & great decor, this place definitely fits the bill. The server, Sarah was delightful, attentive, and warm.

Everything on the menu looked great, but since I couldnt eat it all I tried the short rib benedict...their signature dish. Delicious!!!! The short rib was tender & succulent. The poached eggs were perfect & the hash browns were golden brown. The meal was delicious & service was great. The only drawback.. no free wifi service at the restaurant.. at this day & age that should be an automatic given

To end my meal I had the warm donuts. These weren't simply ordinary dinuts.. these were banana foster infused donuts topped with a delectable maple glaze. All I can say after this great meal is Oh Henry !!! You should try this place."}
{"text":"Beautifully decorated and trendy ambiance. Asian fusion. Friendly staff, although service seemed a little slow. Appetizers... warm kale truffle dip was mouthwatering while the short rib potstickers were just okay. Ordered the Prime New York Steak which was just okay but the cauliflower polenta was OUTSTANDING! Order the Warm Croissant Bread Pudding.. you'll crave it for days."}
{"text":"Very comfortable bar chairs and a nice bartender. Juicy burger cost $14 but came with delicious truffled tater tots.  A nice escape from the mayhem at Bond."}
{"text":"We had high hopes for The Henry when we walked in. We really liked the ambiance/ decor and our server was great. She had this DIY spoon tie clip that she made herself that was very cute. 

Shortly after ordering, our prairie breeze cheddar popovers came out. I wished they were a little warmer but overall they were tasty and came with some yummy smoked ham and fleur de sel butter. 

Our entrees arrived 55 minutes after we ordered our food. We ordered the ginger glazed black cod and the roasted chicken with rosemary lemon pan jus. We were one of a few tables that inexplicably did not receive our food in a timely manner. We saw restaurant patrons come and go and were very disappointed as the experience started strong and was rapidly deteriorating. 

The manager came by and apologized and asked if he could do anything but said the food would be out shortly. In my opinion and based on prior experiences if things aren't going well, the restaurant proactively brings out something to appease the patrons such as a small appetizer to hold them over. We continued to wait and wait and then the waitress came over and apologized. Eventually the food came and the manager said our meal would be comped which definitely helped our irritation.

The entrees were really good and based on the reviews I would imagine this was an off day. If we happened to be in town again we would give this place another shot and hope for a speedier service."}
{"text":"There are soooooooooo many other places to eat breakfast on the strip. Sure the short rib egg benedict situation sounds great in theory--which is the hype my date bought into---but it tastes like pot roast and eggs, on top of rich hash brown cakes. I actually went for a standard 2-egg breakfast (eggs, multi-grain bread, hash brown cakes, and bacon). My bacon was overcooked, bread was dry and hash-brown cakes were cold. When I asked for fresh potatoes, it took 15 minutes for them to arrive and of course, all of my other food would've been gone--had it been edible. Overpriced with mediocre service--drinks are incredible (Rose All Day and Manhattan)--but they should be at $15-18 a pop."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the worst breakfast set up on Camelback, if you could call it breakfast. Shuttled around like cattle trying to find a seat. Waiting in a long line only to be told there is no more breakfast and you can't order lunch! But we were offered pastries. Don't advertise breakfast if you don't have it. Won't be back"}
{"text":"We had a 1pm reservation at \"The Henry\" for a party of seven people on Sunday, August 21st.  We were seated promptly at our reservation time.

This restaurant is on the main floor of the Cosmopolitan, right near the exit that takes you out to the side of the building towards the Bellagio.   The decor of the restaurant is very upscale/chic; however, casual at the same time.    It is beautiful.

So, we had a server that was VERY friendly and attentive. He was so kind and nice; however, I'm sorry to say that I forget his name.

So, although there were seven of us, I am speaking for two of us as far as food. I had the Cobb Salad which was a plentiful portion size and absolutely delicious. My boyfriend had the chicken fried steak, which he thought was pretty good; however, he ordered his eggs over medium and they completely did not follow instructions well as far as the eggs.  We did not say anything, because we really do not like wasting food.  

Anyway, our experience overall was very good and we would definitely return again in the future."}
{"text":"Great food, I loved the pancakes and the fresh orange juice, this place is really busy and wait times may be really long, a tip is to go sit at the bar because it is first come and first serve there!"}
{"text":"The French Kiss is a must if you are going to come here, it is a cocktail drink consisting of Ford's gin, st. Germaine liqueur, rose syrup, and prosecco. Just the perfect strength when mixed here, and it is just delicious. What I usually love to get from here is the Reuben, you will never find a better Reuben than at Henry's! Always nice and friendly service, a highly recommended place to grab a bite all day and night!"}
{"text":"Since I enjoyed a pre-fixed menu I can't give the full details of the restaurant. However, you can clearly tell that this is a restaurant inside a $4.6 billion hotel and casino. The interior is very lavish, chic, or whatever word you prefer. I'd say the price is a bit high for the quality of food provided. The calamari tastes like it's from a less extravagant place. Fish and chips will always be fish and chips. They had a nice chicken dish, but the veggies were a little undercooked. The cheese cake made for a solid dessert and the wine was pretty smooth. All and all, it is alright but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner. I am usually a really big fan of Sam Fox restaurants, but this unfortunately fails on a number of levels.  First, I have to say the decor is really spot on great...it LOOKS good...and you would expect good food, service and clientele would follow.  The hostess asked if we had reservations...and when I said no...didn't know that we needed them..and she shot me a \"bwah..of course you do stupid\" look. Strike one.  She said we could sit at the bar or wait 2 hours. So we sat at the bar.  The bartender was very nice and sympathized with us not having reservations. Then we ordered. The food was very average...nothing special. Nothing stood out...it reminded me of ordering food at an average high end hotel restaurant. Meh. Strike two.  Finally the one thing was the clientele. When I turned around from the bar to look at who was dining....it was filled with Scottstitutes, cougars, and typical Beemer and Range Rover crowd.  Strike three. There is this magic line that runs down 44th Street that keeps these types away from Acadia and Central Phoenix...unfortunately The Henry sits on the wrong side of this line.  Again..Sam Fox does some wonderful stuff but if you want awesome food I'd opt for somewhere else."}
{"text":"I love the vibe in this place. Great ambiance! The cocktails were delicious and so was the food. Our waitress was great, very sweet girl, but the food took FOREVER to come out. We also made reservations for 9 pm and weren't seated until about 20 minutes after that. I'm pretty sure they confused our party. However, the low tables where you can get drinks were great and overall i really loved the place. I am dying to go get brunch there so i can see it during daylight."}
{"text":"Great coffee shop in the Cosmo with delish food, friendly servers, and great atmosphere. Highly recommend after a long night in Vegas...or even a quiet night in Vegas. Loved it."}
{"text":"LOVED IT! 

We got the Salmon App & Butter-Poached Lobster and it was great. Our server recommended the salmon to us and we are happy that he did cause it was fantastic! The New York Strips were flawless and are HUGE portions. I bought half of it home at least.

Loved the molten lava cake for dessert. Not crazy about the lemon tart however! 

Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I went to the Henry twice for breakfast during my stay at the Cosmopolitan.  The wait wasn't very long either time.  The wait staff is super attentive and efficient.  My favorite server was Larry.  Breakfast was also tasty.  I got the Belgium waffle with fresh strawberries and whipped cream twice- no syrup necessary.  The waffle was soft and fluffy and oh so good.  I also got a side of bacon.  The cafe lattes were delicious as well.  The portions are a good size.  The prices are a bit high, but I feel that this is standard for Las Vegas, and the food WAS good enough for me to go back a second time.  I would definitely eat here again, and would recommend anyone to do so."}
{"text":"Well, given the name, I just had to dine here. 

My co-worker and I had dinner here one night and we both thought the food was great. I appreciated the separate gluten-free menu, which had lots of offerings beyond the usual salads. I ordered a turkey club sandwich on gluten-free bread with fresh fruit on the side. The sandwich was delicious and filling. The fruit was definitely fresh and a good size.

This was Vegas so the price was more than I would have paid in many other locations. Still, the food, service atmosphere -- and of course the name -- all made for a terrific dining experience."}
{"text":"I've been to the Henry a few times now and haven't been disappointed in a single bite. A creative drink selection (try the gun and tonic 8) has accompanied skirt steak, short rib, sea bass, the rotisserie chicken and the popovers! All well made, perfectly prepared creative and delicious dishes shared and enjoyed by everyone who tried them. On our way out I scoped out the breakfast menu and the coffee bar and clearly I have to return. Of course the icing on the cake had been the first class service. Tonight at the bar, our bartender was really on point. Everything you would expect in a great establishment."}
{"text":"as the only place that open mid day and late you dont really have a choice but to go there. 
the food was 4 stars but little pricey which is normal for a place like cosmo hotel... the service was the worst i have seen in Vegas, the server was a kid that it was so clear he is high on something strong and this is exactly how it felt..."}
{"text":"Best late night steak and eggs ever. Great scene. There's  a bar across the restaurant where you can enjoy great dance music while you enjoy your food."}
{"text":"The service was nice and not too stuffy or stuck up.  Fries and tots had some kind of delicious seasoning I couldn't place, but all done nice and crispy.  The burger was good and the French onion soup hit the spot!  The chicken noodle soup looked delicious!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is neat with little separations so its not just one giant space.  The ceiling's really high, pipes showing all industrial like.  The music is audible but not blaring which is a nice change from other trendy restaurants.  Its loud with people sounds but not overpoweringly.  This is a great place to sip cocktails and enjoy a leisurely dinner.

We tried the appetizer of the day which was short rib potstickers and also the smoked salmon appetizer which is basically a potato hash with sauce, smoked salmon, and arugula on top.  The impressive thing about both these dishes was that the potstickers and the potatoes were fried to an even browned crisp almost to the point of burning but not having a bit of black anywhere.  Perfectly browned and even.  They were both pretty good, but slightly on the salty side.  

We also tried the burger with the kale and apple slaw.  The burger was slightly above average.  Cooked well, nicely sized, not overly greasy.  It could have used some onions I think, maybe some pepper.  It was decent with the slaw and sauce on it.  Pretty good bun too.

The roasted chicken was also a good dish.  Relatively moist and maybe a little too salty.  We got the smashed potatoes and mac and cheese as sides.  Both were delicious, but the mac and cheese is probably one of the best I've ever had.

So why the 3 stars?  Service was so slow.  They were nice and all, and there were 4 different people that came around, but every step took a long time to ask for and then attain.  Definitely not for the impatient or those having a busy day."}
{"text":"The Henry is a \"good\" restaurant.  Drinks are unique (sort of). My entree was delicious (Black Cod) and the service was average.  Two drinks two glasses of wine one appetizer and two entrees $143.00.  

The one odd/ maddening thing occurred when I order a glass of wine and they bring the cheapest restaurant wine Glass glass for the wine.  I asked if I could have an actual Crystal Glass and she said she ask.  Back she comes with the \"Good\" glasses. Normally we only use these glasses with the reserve wines.  The wine for $14 per glass was the Cheap non- good glass qualifying wine (Pine Ridge Forefront).

The shrimp was shrimp Grilled and then Chilled $16. Nice size shrimp.   The black cod though was absolutely a melt in your mouth fish experience. Never have tasted a fish that was so succulent. My dinner companion had the Salmon. She could barely eat it in comparison- if you go, just have the Cod you will kick yourself and want it afterward.

The place is loud and if you're looking for a a place with no intimacy and you have $150 for dinner for two, this could be your place.  

PS - don't forget to ask for the good wine glasses - we all deserve good wine glasses, even if we don't buy a bottle over $100"}
{"text":"Really bad first impression. 

Drove 40 minutes to try their breakfast and was told it didn't start for 2 hours. 

So when you say breakfast what you really mean is lunch. 
 
But I'm an understanding guy. Obviously this wasn't their fault it was just a mixup, no big deal. 

I waited 30 minutes in line for a coffee that I could've gotten it at any other coffee shop. 

I guess my only quip is this:

It was so loud in here. 

You cannot fathom the immense collection of hippie, yuppie, trendy, self righteous douchery that congests here.

Why are all Fox Concept restaurants magnets for these forms of puerile human existence? 

I'm not against Fox Concepts, I've even liked a number or two of the restaurants. 

But can I just say goddamn the hipster! 

Fuck you. 

it's just not politically correct to say we hate you.

With your man-bun & all natural eco friendly beard wax & potpourri scent wreaking up the atmosphere & fuck your
Needy, Lip-quivering desperation for acceptance. 

If we could, we would pit you against one another in gladiator arenas; watch you weak-wrist slap fight each other bloody. 

I've heard nothing but good things about the Henry. But from my estimation I would say It appeared to be nothing but a glorified Internet coffee bar-- The iDouche generation of Apple fanboys present & accounted for; plugged into their laptops or glued to their cell phones."}
{"text":"so while i was staying in vegas i happened to be staying at the cosmopolitan. its regular dinner food with maybe a little upgrade. i had the fish and chips which i substitute the fries with their tater tots. the food itself is so so, but the service is kinda slow and not the most attentive. i went there three nights in a row and each time the service was kinda slow. but the tater tots are to die for hahaha they are truffle tater tots cooked to a perfect crunch.....

if you come here during a weekend the bar across plays the music really loud and if your looking for a place to be able to talk after a night of clubbing might not be the best idea. overall its a cool place just needs the servers to be more attentive.

and yes during these times the restaurant wasnt crowded and there were times where all the servers gathered by the bar and stood there chit chatting with their backs towards the customers. tsk tsk not the best practice."}
{"text":"A good solid breakfast.   The cinnamon french toast is very filling and the coffee is good too."}
{"text":"Here for a work gathering...  The place is unique and has fancy design, but I was not impressed by the food.  The cocktail shrimp was tough and everything else that we ordered was average.  Maybe my expectation was too high when I reading the menu with the price tag."}
{"text":"I have never had such a good pasta dish in my life.  The service was superb on busy evening and the drinks were smashing.
We loved it so much we went later on Sunday evening, and didn't have the same experience with service.  We were there at 8:45, and very soon we felt like we needed to hurry.  As soon as my dining partner was done eating, his plate was whisked away.  Then she asked him about dessert and gave him the menu.  Meanwhile, I'm still working on my main course.  What does she expect, that he has dessert, leaves, and then does the whole dessert spiel all over again because I'm the only one remaining?  There's a difference between going out to eat, and dining.  That is what is the difference between 5 stars and 4 stars.  When waitstaff don't understand progression and timing of service and meals, then we're just grabbing a bite.  I still can't believe I'm being read a dessert menu when I'm still eating my dinner.  It really just ruined that evening's meal for me as I felt really rushed. 
Otherwise, the food and atmosphere were still stellar.  I would continue to go back, but I'd be wary of a Sunday night, or the errant untrained waitperson who doesn't understand dining."}
{"text":"Many thanks to the Henry for being so accommodating to my best friend and I on new year's eve. Our waiter, Jada, is wonderful and provides excellent service and is very personable and sweet. The food was very good. I especially enjoyed the tator tots. The Henry is inside of the Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino which plays great music and has spectacular lights/LED displays. I recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is always good. Gamble. Get your drink them bring drink in when you eat. I have eaten here several times. Fish n chips. Ok- nothing spectacular. French toast brioche- must get. This is the most amazing French toast ever. Braised rib hollandaise breakfast- heaven on a plate. I like to order then then split French toast order. Steak n eggs good. Stay away from libations and your check is reasonable for a place this nice."}
{"text":"Staying at the Cosmopolitan during our trip, we were looking for a good breakfast, lots of good options downstairs so we decided to give The Henry a try. Since we were a larger party of 10, we had to wait a little, but overall not too bad since you can kill time drinking or at the casino.

Drink orders were taken quickly and our waiter was attentive. I ordered the cappuccino and my fiancé ordered the vanilla latte, while the drinks were made to order, they were just OK, especially for the price point. I probably would save money for the Starbucks 50 feet away. Now on too the food...

I ordered the Smoked Ham Hock Hash, it was good, potatoes were a bit small. But I couldn't get the idea out of my head that it taste similar to the hash skillets at a local Denny's. For the price and portion of food, I expected a better tasting meal. If you're looking for something in The Cosmo that's 24/7 I guess this would be an ok option."}
{"text":"I've been to the Henry twice for my anniversary as well as my birthday brunch, so my expectations were high for these special occassions. =) 

The location is very aestetically pleasing. The outside has some patio seating with some really comfortable outdoor furniture. There is a rather large parking lot for the location and even some space for bicycles in case you bike there from nearby. The decor inside is very well done, gorgeous drapery, lovely tuft couches and very comfortable booths. The colors are blue and earthtones, it feels so welcoming you feel like staying for a while. The kitchen is open, so if you happen to sit near by, you can watch as the dishes are prepared. Note that it does get busy. I am an EARLY bird and have not needed a reservation, however I did notice it get rather full as we ate and there was a wait. 

The Henry has a main restuarant as well as a Cafe in the same building. I have not eaten at the cafe part, but I am sure I will. I did order from the bakery at the Cafe, but I am gettng ahead of myself and will describe the macarons I got later. 

The staff is wonderful. They are attentive, without being intrusive, helpful and happy to help. I like salsa with my eggs at breakfast and they were quick to bring us a very delicious roasted veggie salsa that was just the right amount of smokey, fresh and spicy! The coffee is delish and probably has something to do with the cafe. I usually will have one maybe 2 cups tops and I had 3 both times I went. I've tried the egg white and turkey omelette. The turkey is made in-house fresh roasted and carved, it was so succulent and well seasoned that it made sense to pair it with eggwhites so that the turkey flavors really stand out. It was served with what they calles smashed avocado; it was reminicent of a chunky guacamole with out lime. I thought that was a nice addition to the omelette. My company had the turkey au jus and LOVED IT. the bread was just the right amount of crusty but so soft in the middle to really soak up all the turkey au jus (which was amazing, so savory and such a comfort food taste given that it was turkey, much lighter than you'd get from beef, but still interesting anf a great addition to the sandwich). I also tried the New Yorker, which was GREAT! They make thier own corned beef, so I suggest your try the omelette or the sandwich as its cooked to perfection, not fatty at all and the kind ofitem you'd wish they sold by the pound to take home. 
The portions are generous in my opinion and they are very accomodating with what you'd like and substituing side orders. We tried the grapefruit brulee and it was warm, juicy and the sugar crust cracked with every spoonfu. the caramelized sugar went perfect with the fruit. The desserts were AMAZING, we shared a berry muffin and I could literally smell the butter; it was full of fresh berries as well, so well worth the purchase. I ordered strawberry macarons and they were delightful. The filling was not overly sweet and you could really taste the dab of sweet yet tart strawberries; it really tasted like summer time. My parents tried the bear claw and they highly reccomend it. My mom commented that she was pleasantly surprised by the dash of sea salt carefully dusted over the pastry. While she was not expecting this she mentioned it really added some depth of flavor, brining out the tastes in the the sweet almond filling. 

On a side note, I found the restuarant to be a great place to dine whether you are grabbing a quick bite to eat, are heading out with the family including small children or celebrating a special day with your significant other. I have and will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service was a bit slow. Otherwise, this was one of our very favorite meals in Vegas!! We went all out with the brioche French toast which was HUGE!! We also ordered the donuts which were outta this world! They were warm and had the perfect hints of caramel and banana- delicious!! My husband got The Henry breakfast which came with some baby potatoes that were so, so good! Cappuccino was great too and they even gave us fresh coffees to go."}
{"text":"The Henry's a stylish diner that authentically feels unique through its menu, service and interior design. I recommend planning a reservation with the concept of experiencing The Henry moreso than consuming food -- it's memorable from start to finish and each of its menu items comes equipped with talking points making it a great daytime date spot. I recommend giving the coffee varieties a try -- consider the wildflower or the dropout (both can come iced as well!) if you're interested in trying more artisanal caffeine cocktails. While it is typical diner food, it doesn't ever feel like a typical diner."}
{"text":"After failed efforts to find a decent late dinner menu, I found this plush but reasonable spot on the strip and sat at the bar.  Knowledgeable, efficient bartender and quality American beef (devoured the prime rib) made me want to return.  Extensive selection of wines by the glass is also fantastic with great bang for the buck. 

This place has value."}
{"text":"If you see my check-ins you'll know I'm here just about every weekend! We love the Henry for brunch on the weekends. Everything we've had is amazing!! Spicy sausage scramble, egg white turkey omelet, chicken fried chicken are our faves for breakfast! The turkey French dip and short rib pot sticks are amazing for lunch!! The Bloody Mary cart is the best!! The infused vodkas are amazing! Literally I could never have anything bad to say about The Henry and I don't think there are adequate words to express my love/obsession with this place! I will say they recently got rid of the carrot cake pancakes and I am CRUSHED!! They were our favorite and everyone we brought here from out of town tried them and loved them :( maybe give me the recipe so I can make them on my own? Or better yet bring them back!"}
{"text":"We had a reservation at 12:45pm, and when 1:45pm rolled around, we had just been seated but hadn't ordered yet. The food was good, but I probably wouldn't wait out that long for something I didn't absolutely love. I got the grilled chicken, which was tasty, and the whole meal was very filling! It's a cute location, and taking a photo by the sign out front is a MUST! I hear dinner really good, so I might have to go back for that. I wouldn't mind waiting if it wasn't so hot outside, and there was more room to wait inside. While we were waiting, we had to stand the entire time. I just suggest going when it's not as hot, so you can wait it out outside since it can get cramped. 5 stars if the wait wasn't so long!"}
{"text":"Indulgence at The Henry this week to beat the Valentine's Day rush.  Appetizers fail to knock our socks off and Swedish meatballs appear slightly undercooked.  Service is very good and quite professional. Main vegan (squash) entree was a bit sweet for my taste - was it supposed to be accompanied by a side salad? Salmon salad does contain fun surprising flavors. 

Wine list is not for the budget minded and is committed to a low price point of $59 bottle.  Also, a happy hour was not noted. Hmm, how about a little give back for future loyal customers?

Quite glad that we ate outdoors as interior is way LOUD, as reputed.  Crowd appears to be from local zip code. The patrons are fully aware that partying here is hip and reduces the drive home plus use of a dishwasher. Clearly, good marketing by Fox.

Indeed, the patio is well laid out and invites folks to relax and spend hours here in the comfortable benches and fun outdoor textures. Unique patio trees. Please relocate gas heaters from touching overhead outdoor lighting. Perhaps the only design flaw?"}
{"text":"The selection wasn't huge, but the less the better when you're deciding at 2 am, right? The Henry was there, delicious and open just as I was getting the hunger dizzies from the long days of indulgence.

I stuck it out and opted for the chicken salad sandwhich with seed-encrusted berry toasted bread and truffle tots. I chose unwisely at first with the fruit cup, which was way to small. Just choose the tots and run it off on The Strip in the morning like I did. You'll be pleased.

Overall, reasonable prices for the quality of the sandwhich and the service is quite good."}
{"text":"I love this neighborhood restaurant! The atmosphere is cozy and the staff  is friendly and attentive. The salmon appetizer is a must! I love the braised short ribs and the kale salad. Happy hour is available daily in the bar area. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I was here in April 2015 for a birthday brunch on a Saturday. I was so excited because I had heard good things about the brunch here. I ordered the turkey omelet. I got it made with full eggs instead  of whites. It came with a couple spoonfuls of potatoes also. The portion was way too small and not satisfying. I was still hungry afterward. I felt cheated, considering the price of the meal. I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Had pretzel rolls and cheese dip that were very salty. The champagne supernova tasted like alcoholic apple sauce (in a bad way). Granted we were here at 3AM, so maybe their B-team was preparing the food and beverages? If there's no other option, go for it. If there are, go with those."}
{"text":"Ate here for brunch on Sunday and had the most amazing cinnamon roll French toast. The roll appeared to be made from some sort of croissant. It was just the right amount of sweet and crispy."}
{"text":"My whole experience was amazing from start to finish! The meatballs were perfectly paired with huckleberry compote and Greek yogurt; do not miss. I had the salmon salad and I can't get it out of my head. I loved the white beans and Brussels sprouts... The cornbeef sandwich with the kale apple slaw was phenomenal. And lastly for dessert, the chocolate cake was moist and very rich. Service was friendly and attentive but not intrusive. Grant was an exceptional server. It is a little loud but if that deters you, you are seriously missing out and don't deserve such a great meal.

You have to go and try out The Henry once it opens. You will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"came here for brunch. the wait was a little long just for two of us. the husband ordered a normal breakfast combo, while I had the short rib benedict. 

the pros: the coffee mugs are a proper size and the coffee was good.
                the short rib on the benedict was delicious, as well as the hollandaise sauce.

the cons: the potatoes at the base of the benedict weren't crispy which was understandable but disappointing. 

I would return, though."}
{"text":"Really neat looking place. Very large on the inside. Everything looks of high quality. The kids choices were ok. Bourbon selection was above average to good. This is a higher end place in terms of prices. I can see this being fantastic for after work dinners or a special night for a couple. Feels really high end for Lettuce Entertain You restaurant. They call themselves \"a neighborhood restaurant\". Seems a bitter higher end than that. We enjoyed the food, regardless."}
{"text":"Another great breakfast option in Vegas. I'd say it's more of a fancy traditional breakfast. We had the chicken fried steak which was big enough for 2 to share as well as the eggs Benedict and traditional breakfast. Everything was very tasty and delicious. You could tell the ingredients were very good. We got in pretty quick and the food was great. Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"My review will strictly be on what I ordered:

French Dip Sandwich - Yum! While the sandwich itself was tasty, unfortunately the dip was way to salty.  Instead of literally dunking my sandwich into the au jus as I normally would with a french dip, I had to do one of those quick-dips to big bite ratios to balance out the saltiness.  The french roll was nice and flakey on the outside and tender on the inside.  Just the right amount of bread to hold up to the ratio of meat.

French Onion Soup - Unfortunately this too was also on the salty side.  I thought it was just my tastebuds for the day, but my girlfriend agreed that the au jus and soup was salty.  If you love a ton of cheese on your french onion soup, this is definitely the place to be.  They don't shy on the cheese at all.  Great flavor overall minus the saltiness.

Beam Me Up Scotty - WOW.  If you are a coffee enthusiast you will adore this alcoholic beverage.  Definitely a slow sipper as they are not shy on the alcohol.  Has a nice deep espresso flavor without being overwhelming.  I love the touch of chocolate syrup and chocolate cookie around the rim.


OVERALL:  Great place to dine in late at night considering this is 24 hours.

Like I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!"}
{"text":"What a great place for breakfast service was fast and friendly and the food was just amazing. Put this place on your list of must tries."}
{"text":"Sam Fox seriously has a monopoly when it comes to restaurants in the Phoenix area. When researching dining in Scottsdale, his renown concepts were always the first to pop up. The Henry is one of his newer restaurants and is well received judging by its popularity and wait times. Fortunately, I was able to easily snag a seat at the bar and watch the restaurant in action. 

It's spacious with couches indoors for lounging, a large outdoor patio, and a coffee shop. The servers are helpful, friendly, and quick to provide suggestions if you need. I was able to stay a while without feeling rushed by anyone to leave. 

I started the evening out with an Old Fashioned made with Angel's Envy, which was not too sweet and beautifully presented. They have a good whiskey selection and one of the bartenders gave me a tasting of Orphan Barrel rye on the house! Their food menu has an array of options from small bites to steaks. I ordered the avocado toast and a side of brussels sprouts. The brussels sprouts were fantastic- crispy, fresh, and flavorful. The avocado toast was decent but lacking in a certain spice and would be better served with goat cheese over queso fresco. I rounded out the night with a delicious Regan's Final Word (rye, chartreuse, luxardo) to complete the experience. 

I really appreciated the great service at the Henry and the overall atmosphere and would definitely go back in the future."}
{"text":"Honestly, you pay for the place. The breakfast was so-so and definitely overpriced. I've had better breakfast at simpler places. I'm giving this 3 stars because the coffee was good."}
{"text":"Quick lunch while finishing up some work...yes working in Vegas...*sigh*
i had the Short rib Benedict and the Cool hand Luke to drink, both very good and flavorful. The drink was light and refreshing. As expected a little on the pricey side, but it was worth it."}
{"text":"Bomb dot com. Seriously, you have got to try this bad boy out. Best hamburgers, EVER!!! Their truffle fries are out of this world as well. 

Beautiful atmosphere. 

If you're in the mood for a cocktail, order yourself a Moscow Mule. Hello mama! Delish."}
{"text":"I liked this place. It was friendly, and surprisingly busy for a Sunday night when I went with my parents."}
{"text":"Good place to grab a drink at the bar at the Cosmopolitan.  The food menu didn't look that impressive, but the wine list was quite nice and decently priced, for Vegas."}
{"text":"I heard a commercial for this place after I had driven by it so we decided to try it. After sitting at the bar for 10 minutes without being acknowledged we left.  Won't be back."}
{"text":"The interior is outstanding! Absolutely inviting, homey, and well designed! 

But, unfortunately, I have to report that the food is mediocre. I ordered the chopped salad, and it tasted a bit sour, lack of flavor...odd in flavor. 

Good service, perfect ambiance, heart felt neighborhood vibe, just not my preference for a meal."}
{"text":"Breakfast lunch & dinner- all GREAT!
The food & service are excellent! 
Love the vibe at happy hour- Get the  cheeseburger."}
{"text":"I came here on a random moment after leaving the club, since my guy friends asked if I wanted to eat. After dancing my butt off for a few hours, you work this appetite, but I wasn't that hungry. I decided to meet up with them anyways, since good company is always nice to be around.

The Henry is right across from this performance bar called BOND. They had some loud house music bumpin' and I asked the hostess if she could seat us somewhere that we can hear each other and the music isn't ringing in our ears. She walked me over to this Huge round booth that could fit a large party of six. I asked her if she was sure this is okay, since I didn't want to occupy a table when it's only three of us. She told me, since it's a slow night, it's fine and this is the only table that is the farthest from the music. It was nice and comfy. I do love the decor of The Henry, being it's open 24hours.. this place looks ravishing! A lot of warmth in this place from the colors. 

The men ordered some \"healthy\" egg whites omelets and even though I didn't try any.. I'm sure it was good, since they finished everything. I love when a man has a great appetite and isn't afraid to try new things. It makes the whole dining experience much more enjoyable and you actually have a bigger appetite yourself. That was the case with me this night. I asked the server what he thought was the highlight of this place for late night dining. He suggested many, but the Cinnamon French Toast he mentioned was the one I was curious about and I haven't had that in a long time.. So that was my pick of the night.

The food came out shortly after and when I saw my dish.. I was already beaming with joy. Not only did it smell good.. It looked So delicious! Now this isn't your regular French Toast you make or order at IHOP or something. It was enormous for the size and thickness of the bread.. Lovely :) Even the maple syrup tasted yummy!!! I poured some on top of the toast and took the first bite... Sky rocket of flavor! Perfect perfect perfectly made French Toast. The texture from the thickness of the bread was unbelievably addicting.. so light, fluffy, soft, and had the most amazing flavor! The four thick slices of bread are dipped in french vanilla custard and I swear it was divine. Simply put... you could be having the best dessert/breakfast of your life. It tasted like candy, but in a good way.. not too sweet, but you have this happy smile in your tummy that candy sometimes give you.. yes that kind of feeling. Then the texture makes you want more and more and... I love eating the corners of this toast... when you try this.. you'll get what I mean ;) It also had candied pecans and creamery butter to finish off this brilliant breakfast creation. I loved it. 

If I ever wanted French Toast again and by the way... I Love French Toast. This place would be my #1 spot. It was SO good. I shared a few pieces with my guy friend and he loved this dish too. I thought he wouldn't want any since he works out hard and all, but with this dish I had.. he didn't care at all. He even said.. it's so good!!! Every time I asked him if he wanted another bite... he just opened his mouth without Any hesitation :P The plate was shining clean. Remember when I said I wasn't really that hungry... well after tasting this Cinnamon French Toast.. I magically became starving for another bite!!! Crazy I know!?!! 

This Cinnamon French Toast is the best to satisfy any hunger anytime in your day... Breakfast, lunch, or late night eats. So happy I came here and caught up with my friends. The BEST!!!"}
{"text":"We made a reservation and enjoyed our dinner Saturday night at the Henry...clearly another great Fox Concepts restaurants!  To start, the atmosphere is great - beautifully decorated and complete attention to detail.  The service was great too - we were warmly welcomed, promptly seated and helped immediately.  

We started our dinner with the cheddar popovers...sinfully good!  They serve them with a ham flavored butter and a fleur de sel - simply amazing!  We both opted for the roasted chicken entree with two picnic sides.  I choose the creamed corn and the mac 'n cheese - wow, both of these were amazing!  My husband chose the mashed potatoes and the cauliflower polenta...the polenta was crazy good!  I am actually craving it just sitting here typing up this review.  

I wish we had saved room for dessert as I hear their choices are amazing...next time for sure!

I am excited to come by in the morning and check out the coffee bar and make the work space mine for a few hours...great idea and can't wait to try it out!

Another home run for Fox...way to go!"}
{"text":"So a coworker chatted up going here recently and I thought I would treat my bestie to a nice lunch.
They only take reservations on Sun for full dining since they get very busy but you can walk in and hope your wait time isn't too long.
When you walk in, there is a nice bakery and coffee station if you're just in there to grab a quick cuppa. Off to the right of them is café seating. I had to go left past comfy chairs and sofa to find the hostesses who were seating for the dining area. They told me that it would be a wait so I put my name in. As I went back to the little bakery area, one of the baristas told me that the seating along the bar as well as these long, high tables with blue high-back chairs were also full-service and you would be served if you sat there. I opted for that.
My friend showed up soon after. Right away a server came by, dropped off menus and took our drink orders. I had hot chocolate and both of us, waters.
Our waiter was very knowledgeable and was able to steer us to good menu choices for someone who is vegan and needed gluten-free and other who wanted a hearty but healthy breakfast/non-vegan.
Since we were both hungry, we started off with Parmesan fries with white truffle oil as an appetizer. Very, very tasty.
She had the Flower Child scramble and I had the Egg white turkey omelette with Gruyere and avocado. Both came with potatoes. I have to say we were both ...underwhelmed. She asked for Cholula sauce to give her meal a little more Zing. We weren't quite sure if I had a turkey fillet? Or pressed turkey meat? We thought it was ricotta added in the middle but I think it might've been eggs not cooked all the way. Uugggh wished I had tried something else.
Anyway I'm not sure if I will come here again anytime soon to try something else. I will say the wait staff and service was impeccable. Nice Fox concepts restaurant. We both enjoyed the live music singer."}
{"text":"I was shocked at how much I liked the place, I know that sounds mean, but I really was. I think as places to go in that area, this was a real step up for Fox. The drinks are delicious, and I love the old library feel of the place!"}
{"text":"First off, I love the Cosmopolitan so they already get points for location. 

Let me weave you a fairly short tale, on this particular day I swore to my compatriots that come hell or high water I would dine on steak that day. However a busy day at a convention held us up longer than expected and most guys settled for fast and cheap, leaving no opportunity to have said steak. Afterwards was the obligatory gambling, drinking and after parties. After inhaling a piece of Secret Pizza (another gem in the Cosmopolitan), I remembered my vow from earlier. I wandered alone and at 4 am was directed to the Henry. It was in this promise land that I received excellent albeit slow service (it was 4 am, they get a pass) and dined on some of the best steak and eggs I've ever had in my life. Pretty pricey, but when you're drunk and craving some classy eats, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The first time it took us 1 hour to be waited on and we got mediocre coffee, at best, but this time my friend and I were seated right away. This time I was given awful coffee with no latte art. If called a 4 star restaurant with a coffee bar, then at least perform like a coffee bar."}
{"text":"Fox Concepts with another winner here folks. Stopped in with some family for a little Sunday brunch and it was a great experience. It was packed, but with a reservation we got in right away with very little time spent at the hostess stand. The environment is a very modern, almost coffee shop like environment which is very enjoyable for a breakfast/brunch joint! 

We started with the white truffle fries which were great despite me not loving truffles! It looked like they had some awesome appetizer options.

My main course was the Huevos Rancheros. The Henry takes a unique stance on the dish and makes it without a red sauce which is a staple in the southwest. I was kind of surprised but it was good enough to make up for no sauce. Plus the black bean puree was tasty and nearly acted like a heavier sauce. 

Great spot for brunch/lunch on the weekends. Next time (when I don't go out drinking the night before) I will be sure to try their fully stocked Bloody Mary cart! 

Great spot, highly recommended. Also, be sure to be extra basic and take a picture outside the front door next to The Henry sign that is Instagram famous!"}
{"text":"Lunch service has really started to slip.  Today I had  the slowest server and service I've ever had at a Fox restaurant.  Unacceptable.  I have noticed a steady decline in service the past few times I've been.  I really love Sam Fox restaurants and hope his manager will get a handle on the declining service."}
{"text":"While they have the absolute best kale salad in town, the staff customer service is lacking. 
My parents recently tried to go in for a nice meal, and were ignored or spoken to rudely. They left. The valet was nicest person they talked to. Pretty sad. I guess they didn't look important enough. I certainly won't return or give them my business."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and got a seat at the bar right away. Ordered the breakfast sandwich. Bacon, back bacon, egg and cheese on a croissant. Fast service and the sandwich was delicious.
Next time short rib eggs Benedict"}
{"text":"My husband and I were here for brunch right when The Henry opened and we hadn't been back until dinner tonight. We didn't make a reservation but we're still able to sit on the patio which was perfect. Not too loud, great ambiance and plenty of heating lamps. I ordered the mule and it was great. We shared the braised beef pot stickers and I could have eaten an entire bowl of them. We also shared the Brussels Caesar salad which was good. My husband loved the Korean skirt steak. I got the branzino and it was very good, not the best I've ever had but still good. This is a great place to take out of towners when you want to impress but not break the bank. I thought that entrees in the twenty dollar range that include sides is pretty good!"}
{"text":"As we were killing time waiting to go to the airport, we decided the Cosmo would be a good place to finish up the trip. For a little breakfast we decided we would go to the Henry. In terms of price for the amount of food we got, I thought it was very good value. 

To start off with - coffee and they know how to serve it too, with a large cup!

I got \"The Henry\" which consisted of eggs any way, toast, sausage (or bacon) and breakfast potatoes. Eggs, well its hard to mess them up, and I did ask for mine over easy - cooked perfectly. Toast is toast. The sausage though - it was a chicken apple sausage (they gave me three); wonderful flavor and the it wasn't overly fatty like some breakfast sausages can be. The breakfast potatoes were also very good - lightly crisp on the outside, soft on the inside AND full of flavor, just the way I like them. Would gladly eat here again."}
{"text":"Brought the whole family. They went out of their way to make a steak my youngest would eat. Everything we ordered was delicious and our server did a wonderful job. The atmosphere was trendy, but you could also bring your kids. 
We will be back."}
{"text":"The food was great. Service on the other hand. ..I ask to have time between our courses.  Not only did or food come one after another, they did not clear the dirty plates before our next course arrived. By the time our wine was poured we were half way through our main course. 
I am sure in time this will be worked out."}
{"text":"We have gone to the Henry a few times and always had a wonderful time.  We decided to share our love for the Henry with some friends a week before Xmas.  The experience was not good but we decided to over look it as a fluke.  

June 25th, a Sunday, we returned.  We had a reservation which we have never done in the past.  We sat and waited for 20 minutes to be seated and we were not offered a cocktail from the bar (in the past we were always greeted and offered a drink).  

When we finally were seated, we sat for another 10 minutes waiting for water and our server! 
  
Finally we placed our drink order... and waited another 10 minutes just to get our cocktails.  This was on a Sunday when the restaurant was not busy.  

Due to all the waiting around and a staff unaware of our pressence we were fuming.  However, Gray Goose can fix anything right?  We decided we would cool down and maybe it would get better.  The Gray Goose didn't help and our server never returned! 

We finally were approached by a different server who saw me staring at her every time she walked by.  Generally she would avoid eye contact which was highly annoying because it was clear by my body language I wanted to talk with her. 

She asked if we needed anything on about her 10th pass by us.  We explained we didn't know what happened to our server.  She then said she would just take over.  It was apparent to her that were were not happy and she seemed annoyed to take on an extra table.

She asked what we'd like to order and I politely told her that we would just take the check for the drinks.  

She then replied in barbie dream girl fashion - Ooh Kay!  

I found it appalling how we were treated and we will NEVER GO BACK! I regret telling so many people about this place."}
{"text":"The Henry, situated on the first floor of the Cosmopolitan, just off the casino floor, was a great option for breakfast on our first full day in Vegas on my most recent visit.  They were open early (in fact, they are open 24/7), we didn't have to wait for a table, the prices weren't astronomical, and the food didn't give us gut-bombs.  We continued after breakfast to walk over 20k steps all over the north end of the Strip.

I had the corned beef hash and eggs, substituting poached eggs for the over easy, and asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side.  Our server was happy to accommodate my request, and my breakfast was delicious.  The eggs were perfectly poached, and the corned beef hash (more of a patty) was crispy and flavorful.  The hollandaise did require a few dashes of hot sauce,  but most that I encounter do.

We had a lovely meal to start our first day.  I would absolutely consider returning for a quite bite."}
{"text":"I have not been to a FRC yet that I have not loved! Since I used to live in this area, this is where I often come back to for trendy dining and watering hole options. I had been wanting to try The Henry for some time now and a girls night last week lead us here, finally! 
Apparently we entered into the less crowded area right of the coffee bar thinking we were sneaky in beating the crowded door. Ha! After being by passed by the wait staff a few times, one of us got up and went to the bar to see why. Well, duh. We were in the coffee area! Silly girls. We moved to the crowded area and started our wait like everyone else when some sharply dressed guys took pity on us and offered up their high table. Nice! We were quickly greeted by a friendly waitress who cleaned and dried the table. A plus, because anyone who is a frequent diner knows this doesn't always happen and you end up that way! This waitress was informative, spot on with her service, sweet and attentive. 
We started out with the Vodka and Pulp from the intriguing cocktail menu that features fresh cocktails and even a handful of soda and juice mixology's that are sans alcohol. Perfect for the one third of us that is starting her family. For the other two thirds of us: The Vodka and Pulp was a refreshing mix of Ketel One vodka muddled with a citrus orange press and topped with club soda served up so nicely in a tall glass. Perfect on a hot desert day! The Red Stiletto was as pretty as it sounded. Belvedere vodka mixed with grenadine and cherry bitters in a old fashioned champagne glass. 
We moved on to our starter of the Wood Grilled Artichoke. The artichoke is grilled to perfection to the middle of the tender heart and served with a perfect truffle alioli. It could easily be shared or as a meal for one. My friends ordered the Short Rib Potstickers with ponzu and sesame. There were four of them and they raved over how good they were. Our main meal consisted of us all ordered the Roasted Turkey French Dip. I had the kale salad as side and again, that was a hit. I even took half the sandwich home for the next days lunch. 
The wifi was fast and had a strong signal the entire time we were there. That is a plus, as no one can be far from their smart phones or emails these days. 
I would loved if The Henry had valet parking because it was seriously hard to find parking on a busy Thursday night. Again, a first world problem! That is not enough to deter me from coming back to The Henry and trying out the coffee bar and more of the innovative menu. I loved the vibrant decor and the atmosphere, just as much as I love all the other FRC places in the valley!"}
{"text":"My favorite coffee spot in Phoenix. The coffee and atmosphere are great. This place is always hopping, yet they have enough seating. (Parking can be tough.) 

The food menu is very good; however, they only serve meals at certain times of day. Consume all their tasty baked goods with reservation; your waistline will thank you! (The vanilla bean scones are absolutely addictive.) I would like to see more quick, high-protein menu options as an alternative to the bakery sweets."}
{"text":"This place is super bombtastic from the food to the mixology drinks to the coffee to the embiance.  Great place to eat with a big group or just grab a drink.  I also enjoy coming here on weekends just to read and relax, they have a large area on the side that looks more like a hip library lounge or something.  Personally love the steak dip sandwhich and the french onion soup when they are serving it."}
{"text":"Had Easter brunch here. We made reservations here just in case it was going to be super busy. It wasn't, but there were still a few people waiting.

Food was delicious. I ordered the California Club Omelet-bacon, tomato, avocado, cheddar cheese, hash browns cakes and it came with toast. Portions were perfect too. It wasn't those ginormous size portions that made you feel like crap afterwards. Boyfriend got the Breakfast Burrito-scrambled eggs, chorizo, pico de gallo, crispy tots inside the burrito with monterey jack cheese. Honestly, I kind of like his a bit better than mine. 

We both agreed we picked the right spot for brunch. I know there are plenty of other places on The Strip, but you really cannot go wrong with The Henry. Restaurant was spacious and well-lit Service was good too...our waiter kept up with our drinks and he cleared our plates/brought us the check in a timely manner. 
It is also located conveniently by the Las Vegas Blvd pedestrian entrance. 1st floor, casino level."}
{"text":"I had the chicken wings and they where very good!!
But the service is not the best they took long taking my order and they took longer getting my refills. At one point they forgot that i had order a drink. Not good for buisness!"}
{"text":"I had a high hopes as I had been told how great this place was... To say I was greatly disappointed would be an understatement. The popovers were barely palatable. I ordered the Porkchop and well the flavor was good the meet was one of the toughest I can remember ever eating. My friend commented that it looked like I was getting a workout just chewing my food, and that's how it felt. I will say that the bread pudding was amazing. Had it not been for that it would've been a total bust.The other people at my table both had the roast chicken and it was a sad looking plate and neither of them thought it was anywhere close to as good as a Costco rotisserie chicken tastes. With tip and drinks and two desserts the three of us spent $180 on a below average meal. We were scouting out a place to have our office Christmas party, suffice it to say we will not be holding it there."}
{"text":"It was hard to have a normal experience here because of the excruciatingly loud construction going on about 50 feet away at the Bond Bar. If you could tune that out (which you couldn't), it was nice. I actually had one of the best Eggs Florentine I've ever had, and eggs benedict are always hit or miss at hotels. Either the hollandaise is thick, gloomy, and cold, the english muffins soggy, or the eggs just aren't perfect pockets of sunny goodness. Needless to say I was nervous to give it a go, but I'm glad I did. I ate every last bite. My boyfriend wasn't so lucky, he just wanted a big heaping bowl of greek yogurt, homemade crunchy goodness granola, and some berries. What he got was a \"goblet\" of watery flavorless yogurt. The waiter was nice about taking it back and he just brought him a bagel. I had a delicious \"martini glass\" of fresh squeezed OJ and the total bill was about $35 which I at first thought was a steal until I realized that my boyfriend only had a bagel...."}
{"text":"My, no, our, recent family experience at this establishment compels me to rate them at 5 stars.

It started out with the unwarranted trepidation that I felt when pulling into the parking lot considerably earlier than our planned arrival time. As had been my previous experience dining here during the lunch rush, it has always been packed, and parking is dreadful. I was consigned to anticipating a prolonged wait.

As we walked in, my daughter immediately notified the hostess that we were here earlier than our reserved time. And, as I prepared to handle the prolonged wait by responding to emails, I was pleasantly surprised that the hostess was already escorting us to our table with nary a delay.

I had previously stated, my trepidation was unwarranted!

They handled our introduction with aplomb. It was important to me for this to go without a hitch, since it was my wife's idea to eat here, and it was my daughter's planning that got us to this point - so far so good.

As we were seated, our server, Patrick, introduced himself and took our drink orders. Patrick is a professional - well mannered, polite, and efficient. And, our initial introduction with him would pave the way for an entirely wonderful experience throughout the evening.

The place was bustling with a plethora of customers within the facility, and we could have experienced table service in a dreadfully dilatory manner, however, Patrick would have none of it. With the assistance of the rest of the wait staff, the hand-offs with the drinks and the meals were well executed.

Speaking of meals, everything we ordered was simply sublime.

My beloved wife had the Roasted Chicken, my beloved daughter had the Korean Style Skirt Steak, and I had the Wood Grilled Pork Chop. I also had the side salad to accompany my meal.

We truly had nothing but great things to say about each and every dinner entree.

My Pork Chop was perfect. Patrick did not neglect to mention that this would be cooked Medium, and he could've not been more spot on in his description. It was perfect.

My wife's Roasted Chicken was so wonderfully and delicately flavored that it was as simply divine within as it was on the outside!

Additionally, my daughter's Skirt Steak tasted as heavenly as it looked. 

And speaking of heavenly, this wouldn't be a proper early Mother's Day celebration if we skipped out on dessert. We each ordered a dessert that was appealing to our palates, and absolutely none of us were disappointed in our respective selections.

Between the Chocolate Peanut Butter Molten Cake, Dark Chocolate Cheesecake, and the Warm Croissant Bread Pudding, each provided a delightful wonderment with every bite.

Just as we had opened with Patrick's exemplary service manner, he continued his attentiveness even after our table had already been cleared, the bill had been settled, and all we were doing was simply conversing and discussing my daughter's wedding plans.

I was so glad and relieved that The Henry provided such a superlative first time experience for the rest of my family. Now that they had experienced what I had been raving about all this time, this establishment managed to make even more new friends.

Any previous apprehension on my part to recommend this place, both for lunch and dinner, can now be summarily dismissed."}
{"text":"Excellent food. It's better value then the other places at the Cosmo. Gat for a quick bite. They stock Fat Tire beer too."}
{"text":"This might be the greatest country fried steak I've ever had. The meatloaf was a great try as well. If your in Vegas and want something simple this is the place. We're a party of 9 and everyone loved their meals. If there is any negative the service is a little slow but still very friendly. I'll be back tomorrow for breakfast."}
{"text":"Some of the best service I've experienced during my 5 day trip here. We had the short rib potstickers and kale dip for appetizers and each got fish as an entree. Very fresh, colorful, and with lots of good seasonings. The place is quite spacious which makes for quick seating even without a reservation. I enjoyed it and would certainly visit again."}
{"text":"Great place and great food. I took my wife here for the first time and she loves  the food and their price were not that high. I will be coming here again.  my server by the name of Jody he's an awesome dude did a great job made us felt like we were home!! Thank you"}
{"text":"We tried The Henry at Cosmo for breakfast yesterday. I have to say I was impressed with the food (and that's pretty rare I'm sorry to say, especially for breakfast). I always order a steak and egg breakfast when I try new breakfast spots just to have a baseline of comparison. As far as that went, I have to say it was one of the best I've had. The steak was no joke. This is not a rubbery cheap steak from ihop. They serve you an actual bone-in ribeye steak with your eggs. Something I'd expect at a high-end restaurant for dinner. And it was a well cooked and seasoned steak to boot. It was $35 (so pricey) but honestly for that type of steak I thought it was a good value for what they give you. Poached eggs were delicious and the hash browns were casserole style and really good too (cheesy). Just nice to have something prepared a bit different than what you always get. 

Not as nice an ambiance as some other breakfast spots on the strip like Veranda, Bouchon or Mon Ami Gabi but the food more than makes up for that in my opinion. I'd try it again."}
{"text":"Food is great but the staff is almost as unfriendly and unwelcoming as they come. What really bothered me about this restaurant is the brunette morning manager who is obviously completely miserable, gossiping about the company/other managers, servers etc. with customers at tables next to customers that are obviously not deaf.. Professional, right?! And do not ask her for anything when she drops off your food- her annoyance is palpable."}
{"text":"Pretentious people are going to rave about this place just because it's a new overpriced restaurant that they can say is their hangout. Love the interior and the patio, but seriously chik fil a has better chicken sandwiches (tried it twice). Nothing special about my partners club sandwich either. Orange hibiscus drink was excellent!"}
{"text":"Oh, Henry! Another fabulous addition to the Fox Concept family. Plus 1 right off the bat, a self-parking lot. Very large restaurant with multiple seating areas including a bar, a lounge area and an outdoor patio. 

The bf and I decided to risk showing up at 6pm without a reservation on the first Saturday night of its opening. 9:15pm was the first available table but we waited in the lounge area where you could order drinks and apps. After stalking a couple until they left, we grabbed a seat at the bar. For a busy night our server, Tanner, was awesome and attentive. As others have said it's loud, mainly because it's crowded not due to blaring music. 

For drinks, I ordered the Vodka and Pulp. Delicious and not too sweet. My boyfriend had the Fig & Ginger Mule which was a tasty twist on the traditional Moscow Mule.

For apps we got the artichoke hearts. Grilled to perfection, flavorful and lined in a truffle aioli sauce. Perfect for two to share. We also had the smoked salmon on potato has browns. Came with 4 servings. Highly recommend this dish! 

For entree, we split the Korean Style Skirt Steak. Winner winner amazing dinner. The combination of flavors and sauces made this dish outstanding. Steak was perfectly cooked to a medium rare. Ended with the bread pudding. It was good. I'm not huge bread pudding fan but my bf loved it. The caramel ice cream atop was delicious. 

Oh, and they have a coffee and juice bar. Will have to try this and their breakfast next time!"}
{"text":"Went there last night with a girlfriend for the first time. I heard so much about this place and I love all Fox restaurants, so we wanted to try it.

I am so glad we were able to get a table as I have tried a couple times before and they were booked. Well long story short, we loved it. Starting in the parking lot, this place is extremely easy to find, park and get to. The atmosphere is so unique and inviting, love the tall ceilings and the patio area (although we didn't sit there). The food...my goal is to literally try everything on the menu. We shared the Quinoa tacos and the warm Salmon salad. It was perfect amount of food. The waiter was great and split the plates for us at no cost! We inhaled every last bite and vowed to make it our new spot.

Love The Henry."}
{"text":"LOCATION
It's located inside the Cosmo on the 1st floor, near the casino, to the right of the entrance going to the East side. 

SHORT RIB EGGS BENEDICT
Yummmmmyyy. This was the only dish we got that was stunning. The poached eggs were perfection and the short ribs just fell apart in my mouth. It's a good dish to share and probably the best dish at The Henry. 

CORN HASH EGGS BENEDICT
This was also very good, but the short ribs are better. I would actually get one of each, and share the dishes. 

HENRY'S BURGER
Very mediocre. I wouldn't get this again. I only had a small piece, but the burger was dry and bland. We asked for it to be medium rare, but it was pretty much medium. 

CROISSANT
I didn't get to try this, but my friend didn't rave about it...so I think it was just ok. It comes with bacon, which she gave to me. The bacon was a bit  soggy and not crispy at all, which is not good in my book. 

COFFEE
They use Illy coffee so you can't really go wrong with that. 

BLOODY MARY
Nice presentation. Taste was just ok. 

GINGER COCKTAIL
Tasted ginger, which is a good hangover cure and good start to the morning in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Net:  Clearly trendy, popular lunch location with excellent food.

Food:  Wife had ahi tuna salad and I had salmon salad.  Two of the best salads we've had.  Absolutely high-quality, and tasted excellent.  Original and unique flavors.  Portions were a bit on the small side, but not overly so.

Price:  Reasonable for sit-down service in the Scottsdale area.   $70 for 3 people for lunch.

Atmosphere:  Trendy, vibrant.  Not very quiet... lots of different formats (bars w. stools, couches, tables, booths) inside and outside seating.  Feels like a bustling Starbucks.

Service:  Friendly, quick and went above and beyond what one expects (gave us a refill on our drinks to go in disposable cups)."}
{"text":"We had a very memorable breakfast here! The croissant sandwich needs an aioli of some kind, good but dry! The ABC omelette was fantastic. Also got the Eggs Benedict with Bacon instead of Ham, really good! Our waiter was on some kind of upper drug, which made the experience weird. He got a few things wrong, etc..."}
{"text":"The Henry is a modern style hotel coffee shop.  It's near an entrance and not enclosed, so you have good views of one of the bars and the casino.
My BFF and I went for breakfast and both of us really enjoyed the food.  I had the egg white omelette with mushrooms, spinach, and asparagus.  I was surprised how tasty it was.  My only complaint was the price...$14.00.  Yikes!  My BFF had 'The Henry' which was 3 eggs, bacon, ham, sausage, toast, and breakfast potato.  She raved about the breakfast potato, and liked it so much that she ordered another one.  Her dish was $15.00.  It costs us about $50.00 for breakfast, including tip.  The food was great, and they use quality ingredients and upscale tableware.  My only complaint is that it's overpriced."}
{"text":"Very nice room. Food was tasty. Definitely a perk for those who live in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great, decor reminded me of by southern upbringing.  The drinks were tasty and the food was fantastic.  Will definitely go back. Fox does it again."}
{"text":"Had the fried Mac  & cheese which was pretty good. The sandwiches sucked though. Reuben was bland, and the ham& cheese just was blah."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was great, service not so much. Had a parade of \"not busy staff\" stare at me for 15 minutes before I asked the hostess for a menu. Still that didn't spark service. When our server finally surfaced, I asked for any specialty vodka drinks. She said there were none. After my wine arrived, saw their signature drink, vodka pulp. Went to bar, same server wiped off food from bar, or at least 6 inches of it. Asked again to clean, then gave up and cleaned myself including heaps of food on bar chairs .  She sure was there when I asked for the check, wish the rest of our service was that attentive. Aside from the bartender, staff seemed disengaged. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Pretty low key looking place right off the boulevard entrance of the cosmo, but it has a great breakfast!  Wait staff was attentive without being overbearing, they offered to go cups with coffee which is always great!  The salmon and avocado on toast was great!  Prices were reasonable, will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Oh, The Henry! There is some REALLY good and HUGE french toast served here. HUGE. And DELICIOUS. It comes with berries, but I asked for mine on the side. HUGE, juicy and sweet berries. I asked for extra butter which was piped in the shape of stars into a long, skinny dish. Classy!  My buddy got the reuben sandwich (also large!) and fries. We also shared the beignets and lemon curd. Everything was SO good. The service was excellent as well. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The layout and design of the restaurant is amazing and the food is just as good. We've always been seated quickly and have had great service. There coffee bar makes pretty tasty drinks as well."}
{"text":"I've been to The Henry twice now (both times for the brunch) and I found that some things are really great, while others are very plain.
My hands down favorite is the short ribs benedict. Everything about this dish is awesome if you like eggs benedict. I also recommend the Reuben if you are in more of a lunch mood. Its made correctly with the artisan bread and the great dressing. 
You must get the tater tots. The little potato nuggets we loved in elementary school are all grown up at The Henry and they will delight you in a whole new way.

Things I was not too impressed with was the Huevos Rancheros. This might as well had been a breakfast burrito of some sort. Unimpressive looking, but the flavor of the meat was o.k.
The french onion soup was very blah. Lacks a good broth underneath the cheese. 
The Henry Burger... for $15 its overpriced, and upstairs of the Cosmo there is Holstein's which provides a much tastier option.

So be careful of what you order, it can really make or break this place for you."}
{"text":"I eat here everytime im in Vegas. They have good food, and an awesome staff! I'm always surprised to see the same staff members working there whenever I go back. Low turnover says a lot about a restaurant! I would recommend any to try it out. I love the breakfast burrito and the potato skins, goes well with the beer hangover!!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! I ordered the Harvest Bowl and I was so happy! Vegetables have never tasted so good. I was very satisfied and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Omg the hot wings here are amaze!!!

I LOVE this place!!! I stayed at The cosomo with my friends and fam for my sissys birthday we were there for 4 nights and every single night we ended up at The Henry between the hours of 4 and 7am .... its like the only restaurant in the Cosmo open all day all night. and the food is DELICIOUS! Staff is fun and patient with the drunk idiots that come in.. hahaha cant go wrong here!!!"}
{"text":"Was here during happy hour and had the most amazing Brussel sprout Ceasar salad and short rib tacos. 

Great restaurant and ambiance. It's huge and great for large parties. I love the open kitchen in the back and being able to see the chefs work in the kitchen. I love that restaurants are embracing that now. 

Anyway, the food here is great, you won't be disappointed. Especially if you're looking for a fun happy hour spot with GREAT menu items."}
{"text":"We went for happy hour. The atmosphere was great while we sat outside on the patio. Happy hour doesn't apply to the diner area. We order the ginger beer and mix berry both non alcoholic.  Very tasty. The ginger wasn't very strong and the mix berry had berries in the drink. We order a few things on the happy hour menu. Both of us are working on being vegetarians and was glad that there was plenty to chose from on the menu. The truffle fries, not too salty with large portions that neither of us were able to finish. The guacamole was fresh with large avocado pieces and not spicy. The kale truffle dip was also very tasty with small kale pieces inside. The whipped cauliflower dip was also very tasty but has a hint of bitter after taste. The texture was similar to whipped cream cheese. 
I ordered an entree which was the tacos. The onion in the taco was well seasoned however the quinoa was not. I didn't try the beans because I was so full from all the previous dishes. 
Our waiter Alex W, was very attentive and always came at the right time to serve our food and drinks. Definitely would ask for him again when I go back because of his wonderful service. 
As for dessert, they accidentally brought us the pear basque cake and it was a treat. The pear sorbet went perfectly well with the cake. Fresh pear on top. We order the dulce de leche and it had passion fruit juice ozzing from the mousse, reminds me of sunny side up egg. The sweetness of the mousse went well with the sour taste of the passionfruit juice. The presentation was also very appetizing. Thank you for a free dessert! 
Price with taxes was $63, totally worth it. 
4 appetizers
1 entree
2 desserts
2 non alcoholic drinks"}
{"text":"The Henry is by far my favorite place to grab brunch in Las Vegas. Nestled inside of my favorite hotel, The Cosmopolitan, The Henry is the perfect, low key, brunch hotspot. I've tried just about every variation of eggs Benedict but nothing compares to The Henry's \"signature short rib Benedict.\" It is simply superb. The meat is tender and absolutely delicious paired with a smooth and savory brown gravy. I want to go back to Las Vegas just for that brunch. The service was also incredible and the restaurant is super close to all of the exciting qhappenings that The Cosmopolitan has to offer."}
{"text":"Great place to sit and talk with friends with a wide array of coffee, food and desserts. Highly recommend for the decor alone but the food was excellent as well!"}
{"text":"What a cool place. Good service and good food. We had the quacamole for app, good but I felt the oranges in it was a mistake, took away from the avocado flavor. Wife had kale salad was good. I had the vegetarian tacos but then oddly enough the server upsold me on adding chicken but it didn't need it. They were very accommodating. Desert was excellent, had I've cream and they even combined scoops for me with two flavors. 

I'm looking forward to going back for coffee and also just a drink. Seems like a cool atmosphere for just hanging out. Might be a 5*,will see next time."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. It is a casual, comfortable restaurant with a great variety of menu options and friendly skilled staff. 

First, the coffee is amazing. A great place for breakfast/brunch. The lunch and dinner menu is also great. I'd try the kale spinach dip, the roasted chicken and any dessert on the menu."}
{"text":"Okay food. The best was the fries and pasta but you could get the same thing at an affordable place that's family owned and nice. Waiting staff was rude. The girl had an attitude problem and I get that you have your days but take a breathe and move on. For my first time there it's my last time there."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore The Henry. It's yet another Fox Concept that leaves your tummy full and happy and your inner foodie debating on whether or not to make a return trip the very next day. The decor is absolutely perfect. It reminds me of the perfectly tucked away, industrial-esque Cape Cod home that you escape to when  you're writing your next novel or reinventing yourself after a quarter-life crisis. As lame as it may sound, that's the relaxed energy vibe that I get when I visit The Henry. And trust me, even though I may not be able to portray it well with words, when you visit, you'll understand exactly what I'm talking about. 

I've only visited here for weekend brunches, and let me tell you, their brunch menu is unreal. My absolute favorite brunch item is their quinoa breakfast burrito served with breakfast potatoes. It's a Southwest-style burrito with black beans, avocado, and the traditional breakfast burrito fare (eggs, cheese, etc.). But the quinoa added really sets it apart from similar brunch spots. The portion size is very realistic for brunch and for what you pay, and you leave feeling very satisfied. I've also tried their bagel & lox, the huevos rancheros, and the spicy sausage scramble. All of which were well-executed, light enough for brunch but still filling, and some of the best-tasting brunch entrees I've had. 

Do yourself a favor and skip their regular drip coffee. It's nothing special. Instead, head over to the coffee bar or have your server order you an Americano. Their espresso is much more smooth and decadent-tasting than their drip coffee. Trust me. You'll see what I mean when you try one of their espresso-made drinks. 

The staff is warm and welcoming, but not in the overly-obnoxious way that you get with some breakfast/brunch crews. It seems like the management staff understands that they don't need to hire people who put on fake smiles and turn on fake personalities for tips. They hire people with just the right amount of personality that encapsulate the theme/energy of the restaurant itself. They're there when you need them, and gone when you don't. And for me, someone who's entirely not a morning nor a people person, that's exactly how I like my service. 

I loved The Henry so much the first Saturday I visited them for brunch, that I came back the very next Sunday only to be wowed again by their calming ambiance, decadent food, and servers who are by today's definition most definitely a \"whole squad\" that works together \"on that real..\" to keep my experiences at The Henry real. Did I just go there? Yeah. I think I did..."}
{"text":"Loved this place. The mood was fun and good people watching of the 2am shitshow just past the barrier in the casino. 

Waitress was lovely and patient with our late night burn out. 

Had the hame and cheese on sourdough with the tater tots. All greasy but oh so good. Highly recommend if you're preemptively fighting a hangover. The tater tots were a little too greasy and definitely over salted but ya know what? I ate them all so whatevs. Didn't come here for a fine dining experience, came here for exactly what I got so I left happy."}
{"text":"A really great neighborhood place to sit outside and enjoy the night.

Service is good and the setting is relaxed and comfortable."}
{"text":"Food lacked flavor. I did go there for a late dinner since I wanted something light and quick before heading out to the club. Ordered the Caesar salad with chicken but it was tasteless. The dressing was nothing special and the chicken seemed like the chicken McDonalds would put in their salads. My sister had the breakfast burrito which I did have a bite of and that was probably the most decent thing on the menu. The French dip is not good at all so don't bother ordering it."}
{"text":"This is my faaaavorite breakfast/brunch spot in Vegas. They used to have a cinnamon roll French toast on their menu that I would dream about, I couldn't wait to come back this time around just for that but it had been removed. I was so sad, but I tried their new French toast and it was perfect. Big enough to share but I ate the whole thing on my own. Everyone else always loves their food, I haven't taken anyone there who didn't like it and the servers are always very nice and accommodating. The Henry never disappoints!"}
{"text":"Wide open modern dining with modern fare, feels like you're at a country club surrounded by business executives, and the food matches. Probably the best short rib of any place I've been, and we tried a few of their sharing plates with the Prarie Breeze Cheddar Popovers and the Short Rib Potstickers being our favorites. It's what you expect from Fox Restaurant Concepts, and I love that they have a coffee shop with delicious baked goodies if you simply wanna drop in, their hazelnut latte was amazing!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars. Dude between like 3 to 5 ish in the morning where else would you go? Straight from lounge or where you would being here from. I dont recall the exact time but it was late and this place was heaven, so do keep in mind this review was for the late night menu.

Good service. I dont recall our servers name but she was new yet knew the menu well and was able to make good recommendations. She had sampled everything on the menu supposedly.

The menu options were great. From burgers, steak and eggs, french toasts and I dont even remember the rest. They took their time at least it was fresh. We all enjoyed our meals and made some friends a long the way ;). 

Btw the seats were super comfy. I mean like it looked we were luxury lounge. Good thing they didn't have loud music playing otherwise it would have turned into a club.

For any other curiosity about the food here just Checkout the pics n videos...!"}
{"text":"2 visits...2 very different experiences. My first visit in February mostly consisted of drinks and some light food. All in all...a solid experience. My most recent visit was vastly different..
My sister and I took my mother for her birthday to brunch and we walked away disappointed by the experience. I've never been \"wow'd\" by Fox restaurant's food but the great décor is unique and the outdoor seating at The Henry seemed perfect for a daytime celebratory meal. Unfortunately the service was just lacking in so many areas: after an hour in, we had only been seated and refreshments delivered. My father had to leave for an appointment with his waffles in a to-go box. I'm sure it tasted lovely later post-microwave. Then my mother's salad was just plain sad..it had the most meager sprinkle of shredded chicken I've ever seen. This all being served by a young lady with zero personality and she really appeared to hate her job. This place is definitely worth a visit for drinks and to take in the spare-no-expense décor but temper your expectations a bit on everything else."}
{"text":"Its a cool place, it was labor dayweekend and everythingwas full,  but we managedtoget a table outside. The hostess was kind of slow ( maybe she was hungover ?) butourwaiter was amazinglysweet and nice. Thefood wasdelicious, especially their pastries and bread . Simple and elegant."}
{"text":"Such a perfect spot for any occasion: celebrating, brunch, work meetings, just grabbing coffee with a friend -- you name it! It is an elevated Fox Restaurant and definitely one of the best ones. Everyone who's been here and reviewed have already raved about how great it is so I guess I will just talk about everything I have tried here:


Cheddar popovers: WOW! it wasn't love at first sight, but once you pop one in your mouth, it is so soft and delicious with just the right amount of cheesy flavor. 

Guacamole: if I remember correctly, I was avoiding the mandarin oranges in it but other than that, it is great and served with soft pita. 

Korean short ribs: phenomenal, meat was juicy and seasoned to perfection. I had this back in May for my birthday and am still dreaming about it. 

Bread pudding: really good. I can do without the dried fruit but thats just preference.

For breakfast - spicy sausage scramble: SO SO good. fluffy egg with perfectly seasoned chicken sausage, and fresh veggies (spinach, onion, zucchini, CORN) ... I'm not big on scrambled eggs and omelettes but this was amazing

Grapefruit juice - yummy 

The Henry is always a good idea in my book."}
{"text":"Had a nice brunch on the patio.  Decor, servers and food were all spot on.  Menu had a good selection and food was very tasty."}
{"text":"Open 24 hours, located right on the casino floor, I was pretty impressed with this spot. Granted I only came here for something light to hold me over until dinner but it was still really good.

-Cobb salad was a huge portion and can easily be shared. Really yummy and fresh, I enjoyed it.
-Chicken noodle soup, you can tell is was homemade. It was hearty and good, generous portion as well.

When you hear a place is open 24 hours a day you kinda get weary on the quality of their food....but I was pleasantly surprised.  Hats off to The Henry."}
{"text":"Henry, oh Henry. 

Long line at the popular Pizzeria at the Cosmopolitan hotel?
My friends decided to split up to order food at a couple places. Do you like how we multitask in getting crazy amounts of food?

2 bitter champagne cocktails + 1 spinach artichoke dip = $50+

Service was non-existent, yet rushed. The waitress kept asking if we were done with the menus when we did not even give her the order.

My friend had a to-go box from another restaurant, and they threw it away. When we asked about it, they defensively replied, \"IT'S NOT OUR FAULT.\"

1 extra star because they open late and they let us eat our outside food (cosmo pizza) inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"Great customer service. However the food tasted like it came out of a box. They dont have any beers on tap and Henry Plate for the price it did meet my expectations."}
{"text":"The food was really good for lunch I had the French dipped sandwhich I can honestly say one of the best I've had we also had the nacho cheese tater tots I couldn't stop eating it very crispy very flavorful service was good no problems only thing was the restroom situation had to walk out the restaurants and around the hall ways just to wash my hands but I wouldent let that stop me from coming back so if your ever in the Cosmo I would recommend stoping by and giving this place a try"}
{"text":"Fabulous crafted cocktails by bartenders that know their craft. Hip relaxed environment with button leather upholstery in the booths and walls, the music from the casino outside can be heard but not so loud that conversation is strained. Great food. Breakfast fare all-day."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of what Sam Fox has done and his restaurant concepts. That being said, I was totally looking forward to trying The Henry after I've heard good reviews. Sad to say, I visited this for the first time with two others. The turkey french dip had excellent flavor with havarti cheese. Unfortunately the  portion size of the sandwich bun seemed small and the bread roll did not live up to the crusty expectations. The corned beef on marbled rye also seemed a bit dry and needed a bit of a sauce. The kale apple slaw was excellent as was the service. The atmosphere was fantastic."}
{"text":"Not your typical cheap eats kind of cafe....

The Henry is located in the Cosmo hotel, so it's a good place to hit up if you are staying here and are too lazy to wander somewhere else.  Especially for breakfast if you're too hung over to go anywhere.  Otherwise, I wouldn't venture all the way here to eat from say the Venetian.

The place is nice with its leather plush seats and dark wood. Our waiter was friendly and attentive.  My impression is that it's  this cafe trying to be a little bit more upscale then it really is, hence the prices, but food is average.

* cream cheese and lox bagel- presentation was nice and my everything bagel was toasted.  I enjoyed all 18 dollars worth of it !

* The Henry special:  three eggs, choice of chicken sausage, ham or regular sausage, potatoes, and toast.  16 bucks for  nothing spectacular here, but it was fine.  Can get this elsewhere for under 10 bucks, but yah it's Vegas."}
{"text":"Te Henry has Good happy hour and some delicious Food, on my recent trip I got a salad which was delicious but the portion was very small for $14.99, it left me unsatisfied wanting more. Also the kids Mac and cheese is excellent."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food and service (our waiter Saturday morning was Larry). Get there before all the hung-over folks do, for the best brunch experience.
Good portions, comfortable, in the Cosmopolitan Resort which is right next to the Bellagio."}
{"text":"Even though this fine establishment and I share a great and noble name, my 5 stars go straight to the entirety of The Henry. I think that there is a lot of quality and uniqueness to this place. Came here with a friend when I first moved to phoenix and loved it ever since. Great coffee, great service, awesome seating area for doing work and such. Highly recommend if you are up for something different."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch! Arrived around noon on a Sunday and only waited like 5 minutes for an outdoor table (we were offered immediate seating inside). The place is huge, great decor, the patio is really beautiful. Great place for cute group pics! Fantastic service throughout the experience as well. 

I had the spicy sausage scramble and it was delicious! Very cheesy and the chicken sausage was flavorful with just the right amount of spice. Served with breakfast potatoes, they were cooked perfectly. 

My friend got the original egg sandwich and she loved the avocado/mayo combo. We also shared the Parmesan truffle fries which were more than enough to split and so so great! I'd totally come back just for these. They were served with a garlic aioli dipping sauce which made them that much better. 

The pineapple grapefruit mimosa was super sweet and really good, it tasted a lot like OJ to me though. I liked the hibiscus mimosa much better, that one is a total gem! 

All in all a beautiful place to have good quality food and enjoy a really cozy, comfortable, and sophisticated atmosphere."}
{"text":"We love this place and have spent my birthday dinner here as well as an early Easter brunch. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful and you will usually have no parking problems. The ambiance is probably a 4/5, which is fine if you have great company, but then you have to deal with the rather pompous service. I've experienced it a few times now and can truthfully say that the staff is a bit stuck up. Wonderful food, though, will make up for the most of it."}
{"text":"Ordered the potstickers-they were terrific!  The popovers were a little disappointing but the fried chicken was incredible.  Service was very good!"}
{"text":"This place was fantastic. We had the Cobb salad and short rib Benedict. Absolutely fab. The service was excellent too!"}
{"text":"Tried to get into restaurant Eggslut in same hotel and line was so long we came here. Great move. This is more for grownups. Eggslut younger crowd and much less expensive. Nice surroundings and decor and we both loved our breakfast. We shared pancakes, bowl fruit, and Henry which is eggs with side bacon and amazing hash browns. Classy place. Expensive but maybe not that much for Vegas standards."}
{"text":"The service was good and the décor was nice.  The food though!!  Every time I go to Phoenix I try and eat here.  I LOVE their pastries.  The menu has lots of choices so you can please everyone here."}
{"text":"Always a must when you stay at Cosmo. They have amazing breakfast and lunch items on the menu. This time I tried the French Dip and it was good. Usually, when I make it downstairs before their breakfast is over, I order the egg Benedict which is VERY delicious."}
{"text":"Any time is a perfect time for The Henry; it is my favorite place in Phoenix!  Perfect for coffee, getting work done on a laptop, brunch, a work meeting, lunch, happy hour, dinner, after-dinner drinks - any and all!  The food is delicious (truffle fries), the staff is phenomenal, and I love their patio.  The atmosphere is classy and laid-back...definitely not stuffy or over-the-top.  Added bonus that it is close to Camelback.  Fox Concepts did it again!"}
{"text":"I really like The Henry for breakfast. Having sampled a lot of Las Vegas spots for breakfast and not being a fan of Casino lines and buffets, this is a good alternative for a quiet breakfast.

The restaurant is located about as far as you can go from the front door of the main floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Next to the Bond Bar is The Henry. The service is consistent. In other words, figure you are going to wait to sit, wait to order, wait to eat and the check will be slow. It's almost like they only hire folks with a 'tude, or who are horrible at customer service. 

Generally, when I'm here with a group, we create a small pool to bet on how slow our service will be. However, the food is really good. Fresh OJ, Great coffee drinks and lots of really good eggs dishes are their forte. The Bloody Mary is good, too, though liquid breakfast doesn't usually get it.

If you want an option, eg sub fruit for potatoes, there's always an up-charge.  It almost seems like a game where they see what they can get from you. \"Oh, you'd like an English muffin v toast? That'll be $16.00!\" 

Literally, the service is THAT bad. 

So, I give this 2 star service spot 4 stars due strictly to food and ambiance. If you want good service, Denny's would be a better option. 

Amusing place just to see how many times you'll hear \"upcharge\"."}
{"text":"The short rib Benedict was de-lish! A little pricy considering the portion size, but it's Vegas."}
{"text":"i seriously didn't think much of this place before I came here. After leaving on a full stomach, my opinion was changed.
The service was impeccable and the drinks were delicious.
I got the slow-roasted prime rib with side of mushrooms and side or mashed potatoes. it was one of the best prime rib I have ever had.
I also loved the fact you could people-watch from your table because the restaurant is near one of the many entrances in the COSMOPOLITAN.
it's definitely a very fancy 24-hour diner."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast the morning we were leaving Vegas.   Someone posted it was the Denny's of the Cosmo; that sounds about right ... if Denny's went for leather and buckles/straps in weird places.  :) 

The food was ok; my husband and I both had hamburgers.  Also, as someone posted, the burgers are not well done at all, even though I asked for well-done, it was clearly medium rare in some places.  Luckily, no food poisoning.

Service was slow even though it didn't seem that busy.  

Tip: if you sit on one of the \"benches\" be prepared to be bounced each time your \"neighbor\" gets up and sits down.  Argh.  

There are plenty of better options in Vegas, so we won't be going aqain."}
{"text":"Henry must be a popular guy! This newest addition to the FRC collection was an excellent setting for my mom's birthday. Since we are frequenters of the others, this restaurant had to live up to not only those standards, but also the hype apparent by the necessary reservations and vibrant din on a Thursday evening.

To start, we ordered the smoked Norwegian salmon and artichoke hearts. I really liked both, though the salmon was my favorite - the potato cake consistency was like a mini crab cake. My mom wasn't too keen on her Brussels sprout salad which they took off our bill without skipping a beat. 

Dinner was a tough, down to the second type decision. Everything on the menu looked so good. I opted for the skirt steak with fried rice. The meat was recommended medium and somewhat chewy but the flavors altogether were outstanding. My fiancee ordered the half chicken, so if you've been to one of these restaurants before, you know how good that was. And, it comes with two sides. My mom ordered the Branzino, a highly tender and delicious fish option that I suggest you try. Normally a finicky eater, she ate every bit!

Birthday dessert was their peanut butter bar served with ice cream. Cue the spoon fighting! It didn't take long for us to wipe the plate clean. They really did a wonderful job at charming, feeding and celebrating with us on our special occasion."}
{"text":"I ate here twice when I was drunk.

Both times I had the burger, and half of the french dip sandwich.

Whatever you do, order something that comes with the truffle oil tater tots.  Those are amazing!

Pricey burgers and menu items.  Entrees range from about $17-$30 if I remember correctly (burgers, sandwiches, etc)

I'd come back here again, if I was drunk"}
{"text":"I moseyed over to the Cosmopolitan to eat at the Henry for breakfast on a Monday morning. It was about 10am and there was no wait. It was classy and cute, with some whimsical takes on the overt masculinity of old school gambling culture, and a nice break from the casino right outside. It was full of big chesterfield booths, and velvet covered chairs, argyle walls, and possibly my favorite piece of art EVER (picture attached). This horse's bangs are on-point, and I consider her to be the one fashion icon I saw in Vegas. 

But most importantly, the food, right? First, the coffee cups are big. Thank you. It's Vegas. People are purging their sins from the night before, and that calls for a heavy hitting cup of coffee. The servers were great about refilling, but also asking before they refilled. One of my personal pet peeves is when you get your coffee/cream/sugar ratio perfect and then they add more coffee. But they know what's up. Constant refills, always asking first. Juices were served in martini glasses, and one of my companions ordered a really beautiful fruit smoothie and loved it. 

There is an embarrassment of riches at the Henry. We had to strategically order to make sure we covered the bases. We ordered a California Club Omelet and the Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes and split them. The omelet was full of creamy avocado and cheddar cheese, and studded with crispy bacon pieces. My friend doesn't like tomatoes and I love them, so we got them on the side, and they were nice, fresh, and sweet. The omelet was served with a potato hash brown type cake on the side that was the best thing I ate. It was very crispy on both sides, and creamy inside. It was really flavorful, and we spent some time trying to guess the flavors inside. I'll save you the guesswork and let you know (I asked the waitress). They use the truffle tater tots for the potatoes. It has cheddar and Gruyere, onions, leeks, and thyme. It was seasoned with the perfect amount of salt and pepper. It was heavenly. The meal was served with a choice of toast and I got the sourdough. It was pretty good, because sourdough toast is always good, but nothing to write home about. I usually eat all of my toast, but I left 3 of the 4 pieces behind to make room because the rest of my meal was so good.

We also got the blueberry buttermilk pancakes. They're served with a dusting of powdered sugar and syrup on the side. They were fluffy and sweet, but not *too* sweet. I didn't need the syrup at all, because they were so moist and tender without. 

I'm sad that we didn't get to try the Cinnamon Roll French Toast or the Short Rib Eggs Benedict because they look deliciously decadent, but the guys who went with us are SO RESPONSIBLE about ordering healthy and we couldn't talk them into it. It'd be worth a trip back next time I'm in Vegas. I would definitely come back here to try the specialties. I really enjoyed my meal and the ambiance at the Henry."}
{"text":"Review for Brunch Only:

Great ambience, good food and great service. Great value for the money too. Big portions so plan to share. Good brunch menu with lots of choices.
I had salmon & avocado toast and pancakes. Both were great!"}
{"text":"I try to never leave a bad review, so I am not one of those people. BUT I have to give The Henry a bad review. I am very confused by the good reviews here. I got the California omlette. They used liquid eggs. It came with some pretty little potatoes that were shriveled up and actually rubbery. The toast was a big crouton. VERY strange meal. Then my husband got the meatloaf. It was one of the worst meals I have ever tasted. The meatloaf was perfectly formed with a very strange texture and the sauce tasted like A1 with some saracha spice. It was sooooo terrible. I am very confused by the good reviews. It could not be that it was a fluke. They obviously use liquid eggs and weird meat all the time, not just for our meal. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas, I come here at least once! The food is always great and comes out piping hot! My favorite is a Caesar Salad with Grilled Shrimp! The shrimps are huge and Grilled to perfection! Can't wait to return!!"}
{"text":"The food price for the quantity is pretty high- I understand it's Vegas pricing but there wasn't much to it. I got the Cali omelet and it was okay not really anything inside of it barely any cheese with some avocado i tip and some hard potatoes on the side. My husband got the short rib Benedict- it was definitely good but very undersized. We sat next to someone at the bar and he ordered the French toast now bc that's bread it was the biggest portion I have ever seen. I guess order the French toast if you don't want to leave hungry."}
{"text":"Everything I have had on the dinner menu was amazing (5 stars), however I was not impressed with their brunch menu (2 stars). The atmosphere bumped them up to 4 stars. Make sure to make a reservation or you won't be seated until 8pm to eat."}
{"text":"I went here at about 4 AM, and the late night menu is different from the breakfast menu.  I had an omelette without bacon, which was ok, the potatoes were very good.
The staff was cool, very friendly and accommodating, patient also.  I don't remember his name, but our waiter was very cool!!  
The 3 stars and not 4 is mostly because of the menu not being very big.  I would like to go here for regular breakfast, that menu looks a lot better."}
{"text":"Our party of 4 came in for a very early dinner reservation on a Friday night at 5:30.  There were only a few other tables with patrons, so the place was not busy by any means.  With all of that said - our service was absolutely atrocious.  

We ordered a bottle of wine for the table and it took almost 10 minutes for our server to bring it to the table.  After placing our orders, the food came out haphazardly and three of us sat awkwardly with our sandwiches while we waited for our fourth DP's meal to arrive.  Lastly - we waited entirely too long for our check to arrive and our plates to be cleared, even though we were obviously finished.  I'm a sucker for good service and expected much more from a restaurant in the Cosmopolitan!

Service aside, the food was good.  I had the french dip and the truffled tator tots were the highlight of my meal.  I also really enjoyed the mushroom risotto that we all split as an appetizer.  

Last note - I know it's Vegas, and anything goes, but there was a table of very obviously intoxicated women wearing swimsuit tops and stumbling all over the restaurant.  Come onnnnn.

I know restaurants have off nights, but I was really turned off by the service, especially considering that it was not busy.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Love love love it. A good place for a date or a business meeting. The add on costs are not justified."}
{"text":"If this is your first time like mine; : As soon as you get off your car your already in love with the place. The place is cute & trendy. The hostess was ready to assist us. Although we had no reservations she mentioned that there would be a little bit of a wait. The cool thing is that even if you don't have reservations they have open seating that's first come first serve or the bar area. Such a good idea to keep the business moving and growing. I'm personally a fan of fox restaurants so I knew this would be a good spot to try. I ordered a Bloody Mary & it's probably the best I've had in a long time. I ordered the flower child scramble & it was delicious. If your looking for a trendy, delicious & affordable to take a friend that just came to town or come for brunch I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"A very pleasant place to have brunch & rest a while. Good, solid food & really great staff. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great little place by the casino! Great food and exceptional service by our waiter, Billy!!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just had the best dining experience that I have ever had thanks to Aaron our server tonight. Very polite, personable, and catered to everything that we needed without hesitation. The food was fresh and the proportions were a good size. I can't wait to come back and try their brunch!"}
{"text":"If you're not a big fan of typical American breakfasts like me, forget all of your intuitions, ignore what your brain is telling you, and come to The Henry. You won't regret it. Sure it's on the expensive side, but what do you expect from the Cosmo?

While flipping through the menu, one can get confused in the plethora of choices. Let me make it simple for you. If you don't have the Short Rib Benedict, you're missing out big time. Tender braised short ribs on top of potato cakes topped with two poached eggs, hollandaise sauce and black caviar. Yes, black caviar, the stuff that costs $250/lb and is so damn delicious. If that doesn't make your mouth water, look at my picture. The entire combination is just so rich in flavor and texture. I usually never get my eggs poached, but these were fantastic, especially with the hollandaise sauce. It's worth all $17.

One other thing that sticks out here is the Deep Fried Mac & Beer Cheese Balls, served with spiced buttermilk ranch dressing. These are delicious and perfectly fried without too thick of a layer. However, you can't taste too much of the cheese. Still worth it for an appetizer though. 

Service here is very friendly and surprisingly fast. We had a group of about 10 and our dishes came out within 15 minutes. Do yourself a favor and splurge a little. This is one of those places that is very worth the hype."}
{"text":"Excellent organic chicken with multiple sides. We had cauliflower polenta and asparagus tips. Dessert: Bread pudding with whiskey raisins."}
{"text":"I get the hype about its hipsterish ambience but for brunch place the portion size was small for its price. It looked like a higher scale restaurant in a glimpse but some people were wearing formal suits while others were wearing casuals. The food tasted okay"}
{"text":"I love this place amazing coffee, great atmosphere,very nice. The food is also great best truffle fries."}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent gluten free options that my gluten eating husband finds delicious. Great vibe in the Cosmopolitan. Chelsea was our waitress and she was spectacular. Very attentive and super friendly. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Open 24 hours which is nice. The grilled cheese could use more cheese, the tomato soup is really tasty, French onion soup a little salty. Fair prices"}
{"text":"The Henry is a beautiful large comfortable spacious restaurant with one of the BEST lobbies I have ever seen. I like the cool modern retro kind of look and I also liked that they don't have car jockeys and you can just easily park yourself nice and close. 

It's almost like two restaurants in one. You can order at a counter near the entrance and order off the board there and seat yourself or you can get seated in the dining room. I noticed the two menus are different.

They were very busy when I was there and had SEVEN hostesses on. Our wait was twenty five minutes for lunch.

Our waiter seemed VERY WELL Trained and was very hospitable.

We decided to split a salad and a sandwich for lunch.

I felt a little differently about the salad than my husband. The salad was full of beautiful produce and fresh grains and spiked with blue cheese for flavor. It was good but a little on the bitter side because of lots radicchio in it. My husband really liked the taste of the salad but didn't like the texture of fresh cooked squash in the salad. For me I thought it was missing something but it was still a good salad made with EXCELLENT ingredients.

Full Disclosure I am from the East Coast and have a certain way of what I think a corned beef sandwich should be like and what a Kaiser Roll should be like. I don't mean to blast The Henry for their artistic interpretation of a corned beef sandwich but from were I come from you might end up with new cement shoes and little fishes from the Schuylkill will be nipping at your noise for putting mayo on corned beef.  I'm not saying that other people wouldn't enjoy this sandwich but I don't think most people who know what a corned beef sandwich is MIGHT (or might not) be disappointed.

The C. B. and Rye.        (Oy Vey)

The roll was nicely flavored with rye and was VERY Fresh and delicate but wasn't like or resemble any kaiser roll I ever had and to me seemed more like a soft dinner roll. For me the roll didn't have enough structure to support the corned beef that I really had to bite threw. The corned beef wasn't tough but it didn't melt in your mouth either. The meat in my sandwich had snap to it and that feathery soft roll had to get squished. For me the flavoring was very mild for corned beef BUT still MUCH BETTER than the supermarket Boar's Head Brand because that stuff just sucks. The Mayo might have mellowed the flavor of the corned beef too. This seemed like the most interesting sandwich on the menu and I picked it because it was house made corned beef but it's a very watered down variation of what a corned beef can be.

While waiting in the lobby for my table I noticed other sandwiches that looked very good like the grilled cheese (available in the self order section) and someone at the bar had a burger that really looked pretty and just like those staged ones from a magazine. So I think your experience can be better than mine.

Give them a try see what you think.

This review is based on only one lunch visit."}
{"text":"I would actually make it 4.5 stars if possible but I always round up. Came here for a date night with the wifey this weekend. We had heard goof things and looked forward to some tasty treats. The restaurant is in a very cool spot with big open ceilings. Cool little lounge area in front.

We got there for our 8:45 reservation and were told they were running a few minutes behind. No big deal. Almost 30 minutes later, and getting a little hangry, we finally got seated. I understand people can be slow to finish meals, but 30 minutes after our reservation is a bit much. One of the things I miss from living in Chicago is that we would have most certainly been offered  a cocktail while waiting around for that amount of time. Not to say we couldn't have walked over to the bar, but hey, I only dock half a star. Honestly, the servers here are slow. That's why your reservations back up. 

Enough gripes.

Everything else was awesome. They can make a very tasty old fashion. We started with:

The popovers - almost ordered a 2nd round. Super good.

The Brie toast- fresh and light. Really hit the spot.


Entrees:

I had the porkchop. Not my typical order but the yelpers had spoken and they were right. Solid piece of meat. Perfectly cooked. If it were socially acceptable to chew on the bone I would have. Will order again who I got back.

Wife had the spring salad. She really enjoyed it but I honestly didn't pay too much attention. I was focused on the pork.

We also shared a side of Mac and cheese. Delicious! I'm not usually impressed by Mac and cheese but this stuff was done well.

For desert we shared the bread pudding. Could have used a tiny bit more ice cream on top but overall some of the best bread pudding I have had in awhile.


All in all. Great meal. Cool spot. Reasonable prices. Will be back for sure.

Make sure you reservations!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Fun atmosphere and delicious food. Great ambiance."}
{"text":"Decent place for late night eats.  Food was okay, nothing spectacular.  Service was great, shout out to our server Claudio who did a fabulous job.  I believe this place is always open.  I've never seen it busy so it's a nice easy option if you need food and you're in the cosmo.  
We tried the following:

-tater tot nachos-with braised short rib is pretty good!
-fish and chips- good size, came out hot, tasted good, lots of french fries
-rueben sandwich-I didn't order this but my friend gives it a thumbs up
-diagon alley cocktail- not sure where the harry potter theme fits in but it was ok

They also had a 24 hour breakfast menu which looked real good but I didn't try it.  The decor is definitely a little less glam than the rest of the hotel but you are directly across from the Bond Bar so if you're eating here you'll hear the loud music, which I was cool with.  
Come for the convenience, the service and the drunk food!"}
{"text":"Went for 15th anniversary on a Wednesday night. Place is ridiculously noisy. I don't enjoy that but seems to be a new thing for these restaurants. Think it is for the smartphone crowd that doesn't actually speak to each other. There is zero noise reduction materials in the place. Wide open to kitchen and bar is in restaurant area. So it is very very noisy. 

The food was good as was the service. Got drink orders right away and the drinks are all custom cocktails that most of probably have no clue what they actually out in them, even after you read it. Those smarter than you cocktails. Which usually turn out to be good. 

The caramelized scallops were really good but have had better (like Vogue Bistro). Popovers are excellent and the herb butter had an almost Tzatziki sauce flavor. Which I thought was very good. Ham butter was just alright. 

The lobster salad was ok but, to me, very overpriced and had some tough to chew greens. My wife couldn't even chew some of it. For me, too much of a mix of greens. Pick something. Little amount of lobster for the price. 

Thought the desert (peanut butter banana cake) was just alright. Not super impressed. More surprised they didn't buy it for us for anniversary. 

They really didn't make a big deal about anniversary which I found very odd. Why ask if we are celebrating something if you have zero intention of doing anything about it? Don't understand that. 

Personally I doubt I will be back as nothing was crave worthy or must have."}
{"text":"The food here is delicious for breakfast/brunch. Dined here two separate times. First time, Larry was our server and he provided great service. Beyond great even. Asked us several times if everything was okay. Provided us plenty of condiments and bread spread. Fixed a mistake on behalf of the kitchen. Everything was amazing - so we went back. 

Second time around, had the opposite experience with the server. Gustavo did not introduce himself (I had to look for his name tag), was hasty to leave, and gave us one tray for bread spread even though we ordered 3 entrees that had bread. Gustavo also took the initiative to just pick the hot sauce for us instead of asking us which one we would prefer (Larry, above, actually gave us all three types). Gustavo's face was just unhappy and unpleasant - it would've offset any great restaurant experience. He did not refill drinks, did not ask us once if everything was okay/if we needed anything else, and disappeared to who knows where towards the end. Maybe he was having a bad morning, but I've never experienced having a server who does not talk, does not provide service, and carries a stink face during the entire dining experience. And here's the nice cherry on top - he rudely handed us the check and said \"here you go!\" and walked away. Those were the last few words from this unhappy man.

Usually minimal service would get at least a 20% from me, so I'm not very hard to please at a restaurant. However, the second time here was just lack of service. If based on just Larry, this restaurant deserves a 5 star. Gustavo takes two away."}
{"text":"This place is very cute! I love that there are multiple seating areas, outside, couches, bar, booths, tables. There are a lot of drink options, I got a peach specialty drink which was really good. It wasn't too sweet. I had the salmon salad which I liked, I'm just not use to a warm salad. Service was attentive and nice. Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"A decent breakfast option very close to the casino floor and the front entrance.  Good service."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! If you're hungover and in need of some amazing coffee and breakfast to help bring you back to life, pay them a visit. Our waiter was quick and didn't bug us too much (I think it was evident what condition we were in). I will definitely return when I'm in town."}
{"text":"Really great food, been there a few times, twice excellent, once was just ok"}
{"text":"Had breakfast there; chicken fried steak was poor at best (grisly with a turkey dinner type gravy instead of chicken fried steak gravy), the wife had biscuits and gravy and the \"biscuits\" where hamburger buns....we swear. I won't ever go back for breakfast, but I might give lunch a try."}
{"text":"A fun place to have happy hour! Plenty of energy in the air!  Tried a few of their happy hour apps.  The korean bbq beef tacos were my favorite. I had two orders all to myself.  The guacamole was okay.  I little more citrus juice could have gone a long way.  Really enjoyed the mule. There were no cocktails on the happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Big fan of the hours - Open 24 hours, 7 days a week. Not a big fan of some of the prices, but it is Vegas. 

I had the Smoked Salmon Plate (Santa Barbara smokehouse salmon, lettuce, tomato, onions, capers, bagel & schmear) for $18.

Nice portion of salmon and everything was freshhhhh. I had them hold the capers, not a fan.

The service was ok, could have been a little faster....but again this is Vegas and no one is looking at the time.

Cool option at the hotel, try them out."}
{"text":"Review for LUNCH (Monday, Feb 21) 

PRICE: pricey... for 2 people at lunch $76 (of course we did have a cocktail each which contributed to about 1/3 of the price) 

ATMOSPHERE: an upscale cafe across from Bond Bar 

SERVICE: 2-2.5 stars 

- walked up around 11:30am and was sat right away at a table with no flatware or bread plates, just napkins... took them about 5 minutes to locate flatware but didn't bring any bread plates (this will become key later) 

- server was busy with a couple of other tables so it took another 5 minutes before he was able to make his way over... he was VERY nice and attentive ... took our orders and off he went 

- water glasses remained un-filled for another 5-7 minutes ... turns out they waited to fill our water glasses until they brought out our drinks... odd 

- appetizer was brought out but no appetizer plates and since we didn't have bread plates...we sat there staring and trying to gain the attention of any one of the 3 different wait staff helping the other tables ... no such luck... even the guy that was dressing the table next to us didn't notice... so we took the bread plates off that table (literally arm's length away)... so strange! 

-our server was Nice but it just seems like he was a bit too busy maybe the manager didn't have enough people on staff that day 

FOOD/BEV: 3 stars average 

Bloody Mary's - 2.5 stars - a little on the watery side... I've had better at golf courses and for $12 a pop... I won't be ordering it again from them 

Deviled Eggs - 3.5 stars - for $15 you get 3 halves... they have crab and caviar but still... seems a little steep to me (and I don't mind paying a lot if the food and service are really good)... better than your average deviled eggs, but not over the top spectacular that I would order them again 

Lobster Club - 3 stars - Good size portion that looks like a Scooby Do sandwich.... thick pieces of toast with lots of chunks of lobster with creamy avocado pieces... but the downside was that the mayo was killing the lobster... I mean... they need to ease up on the mayo... and add a hint of seasoning like dill, garlic salt and lemon (which I did when I took 1/2 home... it did the trick...YUM) 

Chicken Salad Sandwich - 3.5 stars - Another good size sandwich loaded with meaty chicken... like the above... too much mayo... it was served on a cranberry nut bread which was Awesome! 

Fries - option served with LC - 5 stars - thin like shoestring and perfectly salted... definitely put them on my Drunk Food menu. 

Tater Tots - option served with CSS - HOLY YUMMINESS! Again 5 stars! Nice crunch on the outside and steamy hot on the inside with a hint of truffle oil or maybe it was truffle salt... either way... YUM! These will be the reason I go back to The Henry."}
{"text":"I met a couple of friends at The Henry for dinner  when I was in Phoenix for work. It was a great atmosphere for hanging out with friends and the food was fantastic. I recommend the smoked salmon appetizer; that was the highlight of my experience. For my entrée, I had the Korean style skirt steak, and it was very good. One of my friends ordered the black cod, and he really raved about it."}
{"text":"I visited the Henry for the second time with a bunch of friends. The cocktails were fresh,inspired and delicious.  I think I loved the Vodka and pulp and the Clubhouse margarita 
When you first walk into The Henry you feel like you've been transported to a different time it's a classy place but you feel 
Ike you are visiting a rich, old friend at the same time. We first sat on comfy sofas to enjoy our cocktails then went outside can you have the rest of our meal.I was with a group of very loud gals and no one complaint which was really nice. I enjoyed soup of the day a corn chowder that was warm, smoky and yummy.The Thai peanut black cod was extraordinary.  Sadly we did not have dessert but for the next time I plan on enjoying more dessert and fewer cocktails. Save your pennies for this place but it's worth using those Fox gift cards for."}
{"text":"We are huge fans of Fox Concepts and had been excited to finally give it a go.  Multiple friends who we share restaurant recommendations with, had raved about The Henry so our expectations were high.  I am disappointed to say it was below average over all. Service was excellent and our appetizers were very good.  We ordered the Warm Kale & roasted garlic dIp as well as heirloom tomato toast, loved both.  

For entrees we ordered olive oIl poached Sea Bass and roasted chicken. The Sea Bass was fishy tasting and over cooked causing it to be rubbery and just bad, we brought it home for the dogs. The chicken was better yet still only average, Grassroots, Roaring Fork and FnB all offer superior roasted chicken. The Garlic potatoes were the highlight of both our meals.  

Dessert was bread pudding, which we normally love, yet again we were disappointed average at best however the cappuccino was awesome. 

Overall below average, and as we drove home we decided not to return. There are far too many excellent options in old town Scottsdale to bother with the Henry."}
{"text":"Came in for brunch and left in a food coma. The food was so  good we couldn't stop eating- that being said, I ordered the most unhealthy things: chicken fried chicken and truffle fries. BUT I have no regrets, because it was seriously delicious. Brunch was super busy so definitely try to make a reservation. The service was a little slow (understandably due to the crowd), but they were very kind and even put drinks on the house to compensate. Their brunch seemed like one of the better menus in the area, and they definitely delivered."}
{"text":"service was impeccable, food was really good, drinks were amazing.
-old fashioned for the whiskey lovers is the way to go"}
{"text":"We came here for some late night noshing.

Mambo Italiano, The Henry's take on a bloody mary, is downright incredible.  Made with a base of garlic-infused vodka, the drink is fragrant with a tomato basil scent, peppery, and tasty - all at once.  It comes with a slice of pepperoni and olives.  

The truffle tater tots are addictive.

Now on to everything else. 

The service was nonexistent from when we sat down until 30 minutes later, when we flagged down the hostess to tell her the waiter never came to our table.  There seemed to be a few men in suits marching around pretending to be important and lots of busboys - but very few actual waiters servicing the tables.  Once the waiter arrived, he was courteous enough.  Hire more waiters!  

Drinks: The Cosmopolitan (colored orange), the Washington Apple, the Southern Hospitality, and the Mojito were unremarkable.

Grub: We ordered from the late night menu and got the buffalo wings (eh shrug), Belgian Waffle (how can you mess that one up), French Dip and Fish N' Chips.  The French Dip was oversalted and the only saving grace to that dish was the truffle tater tots.  The cod fish in the Fish N' Chips dish was dry and tasted old, my tongue shakes with disgust just to think of it - it would have been much more satisfying to get 18 Filet's of Fish at McDonalds on a Friday."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch with the other two members of my 3 musketeers while in Vegas and after a round of mid morning drinking at the Cosmopolitan.  We were all starving and getting really drunk from drinking on empty stomachs making us less and less picky about where to eat.  We were seated right away and given some water to drink as we browsed the menu.

What was ordered: 

JH - Huevos Rancheros
BB- Reuben sandwich on rye with tater tots 
Me- Chicken salad sandwich with fruit

3 mimosas

Mimosas were really good, a good mix of juice and champagne.  Didn't taste like the cheap stuff some places use in their mimosas.

Huevos rancheros was pretty flavorful but I wasn't too big of a fan of it, in the end the portion that JH traded me for my other half of the sandwich was finished by him as well.  

Chicken salad sandwich was really good, at first I thought I was ordering a chicken salad so when I saw it I was kind of like wtheck.  The bread they used was tastyyyyy, the cranberries baked into the bread really complemented the chicken salad well.  The fresh fruit that came on the side was pretty good too, it had raspberries in it and usually raspberries taste bland or sour, but these were sweet & tart.  

Reuben sandwich was really flavorful and surprisingly delicious. Although, I don't tend to like sandwiches that don't have veggies inside.  

Service was good and prompt, nothing special.

Overall I would definitely come back if ever in Vegas and want a quick bite to eat without having to break the bank or go to McDonalds or something."}
{"text":"Would like to give 5 stars but the brussel sprout salad only had 4 sprouts in it. Otherwise food was great. Serving sizes not huge but filling. The service was great. Liked the open concept. The sound level was OK. Enjoyed the experience for our party of 5. Everyone had something different and it was very good. My daughter is vegetarian and she was very satisfied which doesn't happen at all restaurants. Another good Fox restaurant."}
{"text":"Beautiful looking restaurant inside the Cosmo. But that's probably the best thing about this place. I wasn't too impressed on what I saw on Yelp, the thing I wanted was the country fried steak with eggs, but guess they didn't have it. I just ended up w a basic breakfast, I think they call it the grand slam at Denny's, $4.99 there, about $18 here lol. Ok it tastes a little more quality than that, but it was so basic. Probably won't be back, rather go across the street to PH breakfast buffet for similar money spent. So ashamed of my breakfast I didn't bother taking a pic lol."}
{"text":"I ate here twice in one trip. i had the french dip which was pretty darn good for a 24hr place and had a side salad. My other half had a sandwich and said it was ok, keep in mind he likes his burgers med rare.  Service was quick and courteous, I don't mind not making small talk when i'm hungry, I prefer my food to come out quickly. Our sodas were refilled in a timely matter. I forgot what I had as my second meal but I think I was too hung over and tired to care for whatever I had."}
{"text":"It's probably unfair for me to rate a restaurant based on a simple breakfast,  but I was really into this meal. My body was needing eggs and toast to soak up the previous evening's whiskey consumption.

My boyfriend and I woke up in the morning and  worked up an appetite.  I was really in the mood for a breakfast sausage, and he made that happen. 

We both had eggs over medium with chicken sausage, hash browns,  and toast.  The eggs were more over easy, but oh well. The potatoes were crispy and the sausage was the second best sausage i'd had that day...how can a girl complain?"}
{"text":"The thing we stumble upon when we live so far family and not able to celebrate mother's day with your family, but we have good friends we can spend time with. That's what happened on Mother's day, my friend, who came all the way from New York (trying to fake NY accent ) and me trying to explore Phoenix as much as possible within three days period. I've always wanted to try The Henry and now it is my chance.
We booked our reservation and came in a little bit early (cause I was a little bit too excited and was hungry also ). It was confusing where we should go for the check. It took about 3 minutes for a hostess to check us in and show our seats. The ambience of this restaurant is just surreal. The decor on the wall, the open bar and the one thing I'm excited about is the OPEN kitchen. I can tell you the lights in the restaurant were very dim to give out the romantic chill vibe. At some point, all the lights turned very bright and it was very awkward to not to look at other customers eating beside us. Anyway, we were greeted by our server and she told us for our drinks. We told her it is our first time here, and asked her what she would recommend on the drink menu. I don't drink alcohol so she recommended this berry mixed sparkling drink and my friend ordered the Fig Moscow Mule. For the food, we ordered White truffle fries with parmesan cheese, I ordered Braised Short Rib and he ordered Wood Grilled Pork Chop. The fries came out and looked more like a whole entree itself because it was a lot of fries. It came with truffle aioli and a regular ketchup to dip on the side. You must try these fries because it is very good. Crunchy, not too greasy and have this slight truffle taste in it. The Fig Moscow is also a must have when you come to The Henry. However, my friend told me there wasn't enough fig taste to it and the drink was a little on the diluted side. Our entree took quite sometimes to come out and you'll see it won't disappoint you with your expectations. My Short Rib was little crispy on the outside from the caramelize and it just melted in my mouth. It was like butter. I don't really care much for the mashed potatoes, it was good also. The mushrooms were little bit salty for my liking. The Wood grilled pork chop was the star during our dine in. It was magnificent. There was light pink through out the whole pork chop, it was so tender and juicy. We kept wondering how can they keep the pork chop so juicy and it is wood grill. We were lucky when our server told us she could ask the Chef to talk to us if we want. So it was the highlight of our night when Chef Josh greeted us and told us his secret of making the dish. I was surprised that the hostility was so wonderful, beyond my imaginations. We weren't able to finish our fries cause we stuffed our belly with these excellent entree. Yet we can't live without trying the desert so my friend let me order Lemon Meringue Tart for us to share. I wanted to try their famous bread pudding but I know I wont able to finish it. So I ordered tart so it can be lighter. It was creamy, sweet and very tart. It makes me feel not so bad for eating the whole heavy entree after all! Our evening was so wonderful and I can't wait to come back in the near future to try other awesome dishes."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. Huge serving size on the pancakes, but pretty pricey (as were all the breakfast/brunch plates). This is on the first level of the Cosmopolitan so it's got that swanky cosmopolitan vibe."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Henry before. I love their decor, spacious with comfortable table seating. The service is always outstanding at the Henry. However the menu is a little bit limited. I noticed the menu hasn't changed much since the last time I ate there. I ordered the guacamole with chips ($10) as an appetizer. My main lunch was the club sandwich ($13); plus an order of side salad ($5). My friend ordered the scallops. She told me it's very good. My Club sandwich was ok; good portion. The turkey was just turkey ham. I expected it to be real roast turkey (as in Breakfast Club). The side salad was disappointing, just a few leaves next to the sandwich on the same plate. The guacamole was really small portion with a few chips on a narrow dish. All in all, I am not much impressed with the food or the menu. I was hoping for a better selection of food. With these prices, you will get a better quality & quantity somewhere else (I.e. The capital grille)."}
{"text":"While trying decide where to go for a few appies, we stumbled on the Henry and I will definitely return. We were seated immediately and our waiter, John, was so charming, funny and returned to our table several times to refill our drinks, joke and chat with us.This was a birthday dinner for me and my two girlfriends, and John and his co-worker who had recently moved to Las Vegas made sure we had a great experience. They even suggested a Chocolate Cake shot which actually tasted like Chocolate cake and the bartender mixed together a drink that was not on the menu based on my taste preferences which was fabulous. We dined on a very busy Sat night around 10:30pm and I can't say anything but positive reviews for the Henry!! We ordered the wings, Mac and Cheese balls and Spinach dip which was more than enough for the three of us. Our food arrived soon after ordering and was hot and tasted wonderful. The only drawback, is that they don't have their own washrooms, so you have to walk onto the casino floor to use the ladies' room. Best way to start our evening and had we found this place earlier in the week, we would have been back more than once!! If you go, ask for John and tell him Michele from Vancouver sent you!!"}
{"text":"I believe this is the standard \"cafe\" type restaurant at the Cosmo.  I had breakfast here and ordered \"The Henry.\"   

It's the basic egg and potatoes combo with your choice of ham, bacon, or sausage.   I ordered the sausage and it was better then average.  The eggs were....well, eggs. Nothing special.  The potatoes were kind of gross though...i can't really explain what was wrong with them but they were not good.  

Realistically you end up paying 17 bucks for what amounts to a Denny's Grand Slam."}
{"text":"Came here for a date night on a Friday when it first opened.
The environment is very unique and unlike any other restaurant. It is an office setting. I walked around a bit and especially loved the outdoor patio area. It was lit well and so beautiful out there. I would eat outdoors if the weather is nice.

So the serve was great. Very professional and the food came out quickly.  Drink menu was more geared towards men however.

I ordered a salad which was good but nothing special. The chicken was bland.

So overall, I would go there more for the ambiance and social scenery. I wasn't too impressed with the food."}
{"text":"When you find yourself wandering inebriated through the Las Vegas strip at 2am with a pack of girls, and those girls become hungry, you find the first option in front of you. Yet, since we were in the City Center and as I mentioned it was 2am, The Henry was about our only option. The hostess told us it would be a 45 minute wait for a table, so, we waited.

We were sat in the back of the restaurant amongst a few tables of drunk middle aged women, 3 Asian business men, and 2 Persian men playing cards. Our server was rude, short with us, and had no interest in actually delivering customer service. I understand that the average client in at that time is probably a rude tourist who is more interested in snapping cell phone pics than focusing on ordering, but this is The Cosmopolitan and I expected better. Our table was not obnoxious or rude or loud in any way, but we were treated like children and the kids table.

The late night menu had very little selection outside a few appetizers, light breakfast, and a few sandwiches. My friends shared the mac-n-cheese balls and they were a bitter disappointment. 3 very small portions of almost-cold-in-the-middle noodles in a crunchy coating. I had a burger that was reminiscent of cafeteria fare. 

We paid out bill and bolted. At the price and the time it took to receive our food, room service would have been a better option. I highly suggest avoiding this restaurant, which is sad to say about the newest and hottest hotel in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Service was great,  french soup was amazing. My fiance had the French dip said it was very good.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Our favorite weekend breakfast joint. Come starving! Our daughter always wants a Carmel Cinnamon Roll (try it, if you don't like it, your taste buds might be dead). I always want their Bloody Mary cart (hahaha) they have at least 6 infused vodkas with fresh trimmings like Bacon, Pearl Onion, Pickles, Celery, etc. My favorite item to eat is the Le Pig sandwich, their croissants are so fresh and delicious! My husband recently ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken and that too was hearty and full of great flavors. We have also had their oatmeal and it's even good. The dirty chai latte is full of flavor and my poor husband had to share it with me... Visit the Henry you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food is good.  Not one of my first picks when in Vegas but if i was staying at the Cosmo again and didn't feel like leaving the hotel, this would be a good option."}
{"text":"Dined in today for happy hour! We were only able to order either appetizers, salads or sandwiches as dinner didn't start until 5. I ordered the Prime steak sandwich (basically a glorified Philly cheesesteak) and it was delicious!!! I loved the ambience on the patio and the service was great. Ordered a soda, cocktail, 2 espressos, artichoke toast, 2 sandwiches and dessert and our bill was still under $80... not too shabby"}
{"text":"Decided on this place for breakfast and boy were we surprised! Definitely deserves 5 stars! Tucked away in a \"strip mall\" this place has a great atmosphere and ambiance! We didn't have a reservation but decided to sit at the bar. 

Get the Bloody Mary a la carte! The guy running the cart was so fun and made the experience so fun! I wanted to take him home! They bring the cart up to you and have all the fixings- different flavored vodkas, toppings, spice level. The only thing that would make this better? Blue cheese stuffed olives! 

We also got the wildflower coffee- highly recommend if you like vanilla lattes! Quinoa burrito was interesting- quinoa and eggs are mixed together and I would say there's too much egg in the burrito- it needed less egg and more creaminess and unami. Flower child scramble was fresh, light and the vegetables were crisp and delicious! Definitely recommend. Snap peas in it made a big difference. 

Staff was very friendly to everyone, not just us! Highly recommend!!! Perfect for anyone staying at the Omni or JW camelback and wanting outside of hotel food great quality yumminess and an atmosphere. I want to stay and eat all my meals here!!"}
{"text":"This place is our go to every time we arrive to Baegas. Good selection on American traditional cuisine, great environment at the luxurious Cosmopolitan, but yes, it is pricey. But hey, you what you get for. I like this place."}
{"text":"Loved this brunch. Our group had a 10am reservation and there were plenty of tables available. When we left after 11am the Henry had no available tables and people waiting.

Everyone we encountered, from our waitress to the bloody mary cart guy, was so nice and accommodating. 

I ordered the popovers and the salmon appetizer on hash browns. Share the popovers with other people! All I needed was one but I managed to eat 1.5 :) 

My only complaint about brunch was the salmon appetizer was very salty. If they did with a little less added salt I think the meal would have been perfect."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. Way overpriced - $17 or so for a benedict that doesn't come with any potatoes or toast on the side. Decent food but pales in comparison to other breakfasts we've had on this trip (Sweet Maple in SF, Red House in Pacific Grove)."}
{"text":"This place has a great look to it and it is a great central location. The menu is kinda limited and a bit overpriced and the restaurant is really loud. 
Some of the drinks and food is really good but I think if this wasn't a Fox restaurant no one would go here."}
{"text":"You have to order THE HENRY BURGER!!!

By Far the Best Burger I have encountered in my life/ not one of the best BUT THE BEST!!! Tater Tots are To DIE FOR! You get to see the Cosmo in action here at Dinner time. WELL DESERVED 5 STARS"}
{"text":"Classic Fox in terms of great design and superb service execution.  The place is comfortably sophisticated  and reminds me of the residence of a Southern  Virginia aristocrat...complete with a fancy cupboard of single malt scotch.  The food is a little hit or miss with the highlights being the creamed corn, salmon, and pot stickers."}
{"text":"Fantastic Burger! I have been here for Breakfast, which I have loved their bacon, but had never eaten any other meal until today. I have the burger from the lunch menu and it was simply delicious. I have had burgers from most of the places throughout the valley known for their burgers, and this place has them all beat. Windsor has always been my favorite, but I think I have found a replacement. It is a very simple burger, but cooked perfectly with one of the softest buns I have ever had. Crazy soft, like air. Do not hesitate to eat the burger. Next time I will add bacon to it. I'm not kidding, they have the best bacon. Enjoy."}
{"text":"Good place to go for late night eating. We got the truffle tater tots, which tasted even better the night after. I got the french onion soup, had a lot of cheese and was delicious. Service was ok, but plus that it was open late!"}
{"text":"Not bad, I had the vegetarian cheesesteak and it was quite delicious. I substituted fruit for the fries and the fruit was pretty fresh and quite tasty too.  O, the cheesesteak was only 15 bucks which wasn't bad considering I paid 30 bucks for fish and chips at Gordan Ramsay Pub & Grill and it was total shit."}
{"text":"Went here on NYE, so you know the kitchen and staff were stretched to the limit. NEVERTHELESS, the food and drinks were fantastic. I had a Cosmopolitan, figuring that a namesake can never go wrong. It was fantastic, and the best Cosmo I had in years. The food was superb, with all five dishes being excellent and well-priced for the Strip. The crab appetizer was fantastic, the prime rib great, and the fish truly excellent. A great place for people watching, and if that doesn't suffice, there's a ton of big-screen TV's. AND, the drinks are strong."}
{"text":"Reserved breakfast at The Henry for Mother's Day. Just hubby, myself and two pups. Pups aren't allowed on the dining patio, only in the very front, which they don't normally make a reservation for (because it's first come-first served for quick coffee and pastries). But they made an accommodation for us. Had a nice shady table in the front where we could catch views of Camelback Mountain and people watch.

This place is turning into an Arcadia hotspot and we saw lots of folks, mostly well-heeled, coming and going with their families. But it's also a good place to enjoy coffee or made-to-order Bloody Mary's with friends. Like all Fox Restaurants, the interior is well designed and the menu is innovative, but I kind of wished they had more traditional breakfast staples. For example, they offer carrot cake pancakes and caramel apple french toast...which sound decadent...but too dessert-like for me for breakfast. 

I had the Flower Child Scramble with organic eggs, kale, mushrooms, asparagus, peas and parmesan accompanied by potatoes. It was good, but didn't come with toast, so I ordered a side of the Cheddar Popovers to nosh on while waiting for the main entree. Hubby had the Quinoa Breakfast Burrito, which he enjoyed. I also ordered the \"Drop Out\" latte with caramel and it was delish. 

The bill for two was around $50, so not a cheap place for breakfast, but good for special occasions."}
{"text":"Are you in need of a good Instagram pic AND a good tasting meal?? Then this is your place. Not only is the food super good but the atmosphere is very inviting and makes you want to hang out for a while.

I went for happy hour and lots of people were working/socializing which the high top tables make it easy todo. I got a burger, short-rib tacos, guacamole, and fries which were all really good (see pictures).

Long story short - if Stefon from SNL was going a bit on Arcadia, he would tell you the hottest restaurant to eat bomb food and be seen, is the Henry."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised. My husband and I stopped in for breakfast this week while we were staying at the Cosmopolitan. It was around 9 a.m. and we had about a 10 minute wait to be seated. 
I ordered the pancakes (comes in a stack of 3) with a side of bacon and a Diet Coke. My husband ordered french toast, side of bacon, and a water. Bill total was $53, which is why I knocked of a star. That was pretty steep even for the strip. 
The service was very good with the exception of a delay to get the check. Not sure where our server went but we didn't see anything out of him for about 10 minutes or more after we were done eating. However, he was attentive during the meal.
As for the food, it was excellent. The bacon was of a thicker cut. Pancakes were fluffy and flavorful (not too sweet). My husband's french toast pieces were gunormous. 2 came with the order and he could only eat one.
Again, way better than some other breakfast options but a bit pricy. When we make our next trip out we'll probably do one breakfast there again."}
{"text":"We had brunch at the Henry on Sunday. Loved that we were able to make a reservation, who wants to wait to be seated after a late night out in Vegas? Our server, Larry, was exceptional. He was very friendly and attentive. We were four people and had the short rib Benedict (2), steak and eggs, and the Henry breakfast. Everything was cooked perfectly and presented very nicely. We also ordered 4 of their specialty mimosas which were lovely. I would definitely come back on a future trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Simple menu. I had the Cobb salad and it was great - very large, enough to share. My boyfriend got the shirt rib egg Benedict which was also delicious. We were able to sit at the bar and watch NFL games as well. Drinks were good too! Good brunch options."}
{"text":"Today was our first time at The Henry.  It was AMAZING from beginning to end!
For starters, we ordered \"custom-made\" Bloody Marys from a cart that is wheeled to the table.  Watch out, though, the bartender pours a super stiff drink!
Then we shared an unbelievably good appetizer:  Norwegian smoked salmon on top of tiny potato pancakes with creme fresh.  My husband had caramel apple french toast, and I ordered carrot cake pancakes with creme cheese icing -- which is a shoe-in for the \"Breakfast Dish of the Century Award.\"  The portions are huge. Even the coffee (plain ole black coffee) was exceptional.  The restaurant is beautiful.  The service was great.  They have patio seating -- always a plus.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and ordered the Turkey French Dip with a side salad. It was tender and perfectly prepared with bread that must have just been made. The place is enormous but the staff makes it feel small. Grab a good cup of coffee from the bakery on your way out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"CONS: We showed up with a group of nine people, we could see that the restaurant was fairly empty and there was definitely a table large enough to fit our party right away. However, the hostess made us wait over 20 minutes to be seated....why make us wait that long? Or if you are going to make us wait that long, explain why? When we asked for an update, she would just rudely say, it will be another 10 minutes. Once we sat down, the service was pretty slow. We spilled a glass of water and the waiters never brought extra napkins. We had to flag them down.

PROS: The food is really tasty!!! The truffle tater tots and skinny fries are sooo good! I had the Reuben and loved it. I would come back if they improved their service."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here and it was great! Their signature short rib eggs Benedict was super yummy! Service was also great!"}
{"text":"I go to The Henry a few times a week. It's a great restaurant and I love the atmosphere. I go there for after work drinks, dinner, brunch with my parents... A whole host of reasons. It's a great spot. I think the food could use a little boost but it is still better than most."}
{"text":"The amount of time it takes to get your food from the time you order is inexcusable. Each time I go back to The Henry it gets worse. Today 10/11 my husband and I and another couple had a 12:00 reservation. We ordered around 12:20 and received our food about 1:30. Very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the food here. The natural omelet was so yummy. I had it made as a scramble and added avocado to it. I added Cholula and a bit of salt. I think the chefs overall needed to add salt to everything except the stator tots. Instead of fruit, I ordered the truffle fries. Delicious!!! The benedicts were a bit bland and small according to my husband. The truffle tater tots were the best thing I've eaten in ages!"}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place but it just wasn't very good.  Thought it was a better option than buffet but was proven wrong... Service was good, not great.  Food was just ok- came out warm, not hot.

I did like the coffee- served in a large mug!  

Just too overpriced for breakfast."}
{"text":"The Henry has the best vibe.  Stopped in for a quick protein shake and coffee with some teammates and a meeting on their patio. I've eaten here before but today wasn't for that. Everyone's doing their own thing, it reminds me of college in the quad....oh to be young again."}
{"text":"Honestly I think this place is a little overrated. I've eaten here twice once for brunch  and once for dinner. However I have tried to come other times but it has been too busy - definitely make a reservation if you can. When I came for brunch I had the carrot cake pancakes, which were really good however when they were first brought out the server running them spilled the side of syrup all over the plate- which I get it it happens but then when I told the bartender they seemed annoyed that I wanted a fresh plate. Once I finally got the syrup free pancakes they were great but I am glad I sent them back at first they certainly did not need extra sugar! 
I had high expectations for Dinner since the place is always busy and I've heard good things. However i found it pretty sub par. We sat at the bar and it was strangely difficult to get refills of wine the service over all was very slow which was strange since there were multiple bartenders. I would have had at least another glass had I been able to get their attention sooner. We shared a few things, the rolls with creme fresh which were good but then we had the burger with fries which the cheese on the burger looked like a slice of kraft that had not been melted and the fries were soggy. We also had a side of Mac and cheese that came out cold. And had the spinach dip and the chicken tortilla soup both of which had wayy to much creme fresh that made them super rich and kind of weird. Overall I was very underwhelmed during dinner"}
{"text":"The Henry exceeded all of my hopes and dreams.... oh, the cheddar popovers... and the caulflower polenta... I salivate just remembering the delectable flavors.  The best haricot vert (green beans) you'll ever have.  Nevermind the secret ingredient is butter.  It's amazing. You'll eat all your veggies here without a complaint.  Did I mention that the cheddar popovers come with ham butter?   It tastes like ham, melted into butter.  Really, it does. How does that even happen? 

I had a prime rib special. Not on the menu, and you are missing out.  The portion of meat was huge (14 oz, I think!) and it was cooked to perfection, served with aux jus. It was some of the best meat I think I've ever had at a restaurant.   My boyfriend had the short rib, which either tied for deliciousness or came in a close, close, close second by a hair. 

The prices are reasonable for the fantastic quality of food (plates $18 - 25 for the most part) and entrees include sides.  There is a good selection of interesting cocktails to choose from. I tried their version of the Moscow Mule with a twist.  It was great!  Drinks are a little pricey so check the drink lists before you order.  Waiters tried to upsell us on a bottle of wine that was $180.  Luckily, we checked the menu first! 

The ambiance is nice - it's spacious, light and open yet the volume is comfortable and setting intimate for a nice date night out on the town.  There is a huge patio, which I'll be excited to check out soon. I love the casual furniture that makes it feel warm, welcoming & casual if you are just going for drinks and to lounge with friends for happy hour. 

I can't wait to go back and explore the menu, so happy that this restaurant is in my Arcadia neighborhood.   Hold onto your hat Chelsea's Kitchen and LGO - the Henry is in town!!  This is the first Fox Concepts restaurant that I have given 5 stars to and will wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who asks.  Go forth and enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place ... Staff amazing .. Coffee righteous...food grrrrrrrr8!I love Christina,Luis,Conner,Stacy ,Karen ,Ashley,Chef Eric ,Chrystal ... The spirits are the best you can get .... The ambiance amazing!!!!!check it out yo!!!!!"}
{"text":"The Cosmopolitan is my favorite casino on the strip, and we have yet to be disappointed by any of their fabulous restaurants *knocks on wood*. Wanting to try a more casual brunch, we were trying to decide between eating here or at Eggslut. My husband had gone there the last time he was in town for work and told us that he really enjoyed it. 

The only problem was that neither my friend or I are huge fans of runny yolk (which apparently is the highlight of their dishes). While I'm sure they would have been more than happy to well cook our eggs, we felt the Henry was a better choice as it had something for everyone.  

I made us a reservation painlessly via Open Table, but it turned out that wasn't necessary as there were no more than two full tables in the place (granted it was 11am on a weekday). We picked a cozy half table, half booth and settled in to browse their menu. 

Both my husband and our friend ordered the Henry Breakfast, while I opted for the breakfast burrito with chorizo. Their plates came with a choice of bacon, ham, or pork or chicken sausage, along with 3 eggs any style, hash browns, and toast. They later found out they should have shared since neither of them were able to finish the generous portions. 

They also brought out a cute butter and jam plate for the toast with some of the most delicious strawberry preserves I've ever tasted. 

My breakfast burrito was stuffed to the brim with scrambled eggs, chorizo, pico, tator tots, and Monterey jack cheese. It came with a side of sour cream and salsa which sadly I wasn't a fan of. The eggs were perfectly cooked and the tots nice and crispy, but the chorizo seriously lacked heat. Dare I say, it was almost sweet in the way maple breakfast sausage is? I tried to use the salsa to amp it up, but it was pretty bland. I made do with a side of hot sauce I asked the server for, but only ate half because it was gigantic. 

Next time I think I will stick to the typical breakfast plate because everything on that was great. Also, don't order sodas here you guys. I want to say it was $5-6 for a diet coke. We were gambling anyway after our meal, and I felt pretty dumb for not just waiting and ordering one then for free. Oh well, you live and learn.

The service was stellar, and the prices reasonable considering the amount of food we were given. We were all glad we chose to eat here and would absolutely return."}
{"text":"Henry is the place to be when you are at the Cosmopolitan and it is past that hour when everything else at the Hotel is closed for dining. Frankly, we didn't expect much from The Henry Restaurant and wanted a quick bite to eat and were seated immediately. I had the Fish & Chips. I was surprised how well the Cod was prepared. I wouldn't have reviewed this place had it not been for the Cod. It was truly delicious. The texture of the fish was maintained well. The flakiness preserved. The quantity was abundant. Loved it. My wife had the Cheddar Mushroom Burger and she thought it was hearty and delicious as well. The Henry is the perfect place during the hours of the late night / early morning when no one wants you and The Henry looks at you in the face and says, COME IN."}
{"text":"Food is good, but a bit pricey for a casino cafe. Had the most expensive breakfast burrito ever.  Selection is limited. Service was great though."}
{"text":"Love their chicken tortilla soup!!!! The Henry is one of the fox concept and food here is delicious! You have to try their bloody Mary's if you come on a weekend! They also have amazing deserts and atmosphere. It's low dim lighting and very spacious! I love how they have the outdoors seating as well!"}
{"text":"I appreciate any decently appetizing restaurant that's open past 1 am and have to deal with drunk and wild people. I haven't been out past my bed time since my high school buddies . Chelsea kept my late dinner/ breakfast warm till I returned from my lost journey with these Cosmo elevators and Private Jockey Club parking . Hear that ! Back that thang up is still pippinz. Jk cosmopolitan is close to Ghetto"}
{"text":"The tator tot nachos are super good.

A bit pricy though. I always go here when staying at Cosmo"}
{"text":"Whether you're here for brunch, dinner, or just a coffee and some work, The Henry is brilliant. The meals are delicious and well worth the price. The iced tea is so cheap, and paired with a caramel pastry, it's a great setting to get some work done, or chat with some friends. Bloody Mary's for brunch are a must! The fried chicken and waffles are excellent also. 
The roast chicken is a delicious dinner, and the number of amazing sides you can pick from is insane! A must!"}
{"text":"Came here after Marquee pool party in the Cosmo. We picked the quickest closest place since we were drunk and starving. Place was empty. Service was good. Food sucked. Nobody finished their food. Super pricey too. We had 2 of the burgers & buffalo wings."}
{"text":"This was not our first trip to the Henry. We both had specialty cocktails off their drink menu which never disappoint.  

Our starter was the smoked salmon, amazing dish...the salmon is melt in your mouth good.  We also ordered the popovers, unfortunately they were delivered slightly cold, tasted old/stale...these had obviously been made earlier and just (almost) reheated.  We alerted the waiter and he took them off the bill, though he questioned several times what was wrong with them and although we told him the first time, it was almost if it wasn't an acceptable answer.

For our main dishes we both got the bolognese, which was absolutely delicious. The pasta was perfectly seasoned, not too much sauce to drown out the flavor of the pasta, and a dollop of cheese on top.  Oh man, so good."}
{"text":"Short version: food good, service bad. 
Long version: my husband and I went on a Sunday night, when it wasn't very busy. We were seated right away, but our waiter didn't come by often to fill our (tiny) drinks or check if we wanted dessert or the check or needed anything. 

My ribeye was tender, veggies good and potatoes delish. The chocolate cake was also delicious - very rich. 

I'd go to this restaurant again - hopefully our next waiter is better."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict was oh so good.  The eggs were perfect and runny when cut into.  Putting the roasted potatoes in their own dish was great so that you could soak up the buttery sauce on the bottom.  We also got the beignets.  Not one was left.  So yummy.  Service was great and attentive.  As we were leaving, our waiter stopped us and asked if we wanted a to-go cup for our coffee.  Well done!"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to having brunch and we had a 12:15 pm reservation on Sunday. We checked in at 12 noon and we were finally seated at 1:50 pm. It was busy, that's why we made a reservation.

We then waited 30 minutes for someone to take our order. There were four different people serving us, which was confusing and hard to get someone's attention. We all liked our food: BLT, Quinoa Wrap and Spicy Scramble.

Twice we asked for coffee refills and the coffee was luke warm both times. Our coffee was quickly replaced with fresh cups. The coffee was delish. They need better carafes to keep coffee hot.

We were in a comfortable booth and over-all enjoyed our meal and time there. The staff seemed somewhat frantic and disorganized, but everyone was cordial and very nice. We'll definitely return for dinner. I just hope service is better."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. We come here often and always bring guests. However, we were really disappointed on during last visit to learn they pulled the buttermilk fried chicken and Brie toast off the menu. They were also out of their bacon flavored blood Mary. So sad. Maybe we'll back in the fall.."}
{"text":"This is the place we go to have a lovely date night with some higher end food choices. Sit outside at night for an experience. We love it!!"}
{"text":"5 stars on breakfast.  Killer Bloody Mary cart. 1 star on burger. Hamburger very disappointing, very bland.   But will continue to go for breakfast. Expect limited parking and a long waiting time."}
{"text":"We went for breakfast and enjoyed everything we ordered. Pancakes, eggs Benedict, salmon avocado toast & Greek yogurt parfait. A larger party, but our waiter Steve was attentive, food was quick, and there was no issue splitting the check."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner here with my Wife when we stayed at the Cosmo.

The food was really good, fresh and came out pretty quickly!

Our server was really nice and answered every question we had.  I had the wedge salad and it was really good!!! I just wished they had Feta as an option instead of Blue Cheese crumbles, but I was able to get the salad without and it was still delicious (but how can you mess this up)

The Henry is in a great people watching location.  It feels like Abercrombie and Fitch, in there for some reason...Lol!

I would def come back and eat here again!  It is a lil pricey but the whole experience was good enough to lure me back in."}
{"text":"Great place, goes well with the area and the crowd here is very trendy and \"quiet\"
One of the downfalls is that they can have you waiting for some time. 
Food is great and the drinks menu is very vast."}
{"text":"Cute and stylish but that's where it ends. You gotta pay for your food when you walk in like a cheap cafeteria. It's more of a business crowd for breakfast so I your a family or visiting for vacation it's uncomfortable. The price is a bit expensive and the staff, decorum and food are completely in competition with one another."}
{"text":"I was in the area when this restaurant popped up on yelp. I thought I was a little underdress at first but by the time I left, I didn't feel as self conscious so I suppose it depends on how early you get there.

The Norwegian smoked salmon is to die for! I wish I had ordered two. The smoked salmon was fresh and delicious on top of the fried potato (I think they said it was hash but everyone seems to have a different view on what hash browns/potatoes are). It was superb.

My father ordered the black cod and the kale & apple salad. The salad was amazing. I was afraid there would be too much dressing but there was just enough. The apple was a little tart but it prevented the salad from being sweet, which I liked. 

Only my father ate the cod. He said that the texture of the cod was on the soft side and he prefers his fish more firm. Other than that, the flavor was acceptable to him, I guess. 

If I am ever in the area again, I'm coming back for the smoked salmon and the service! The waitresses and hostess, down to the man who refilled my water, were super nice!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service, great food! There was a mix up with the tables for a reservation and the management (Colin) went well above and beyond. Highly recommended for anybody looking for a quality meal"}
{"text":"Husband and I went for our anniversary. The food was excellent!! Unfortunately, the table was tiny and scrunched us up against people on either side of us--didn't expect that. We were asked if we were celebrating anything special when I made the reservation, but nothing was mentioned by anyone while we were there. The waiter talked me out of the wine I was going to order and confused me with his recommendations, so I ended up with beer, which was fine I guess. He needs some training on the finer points of waiting tables--he touched me several times on the arm, not sexually, but it kind of invaded my space. He left us with extra glasses and plates on our tiny table until we asked him to take them away, just added up to kind of weak service. Like I said before, the food was awesome. I recommend the pork loin and short ribs, and the bread pudding for dessert!"}
{"text":"The Henry is The Cosmopolitan's version of a coffee shop; of course it's amped up a bit as far as decor, food selections, and price.  It shows that it's open 24 hours, but I saw a sign there once that said something about going upstairs to eat, so I can't confirm that.

We ate breakfast here twice during our stay and felt similarly about it both times.  The food is decent/good, depending on what you get.  Over the two days, I had a taste of:
-Short Ribs Benedict: sounded amazing on the menu, and was good, but not my particular favorite.  Potato on the bottom (it was crispy at one point, but the heavy short rib/benedict sauce did away with that), short rib on top of that, and then poached egg with a tiny bit of caviar on the very top.  Nice presentation and preparation, but flavors were just ok for me. Jim G. enjoyed it.
-Huevos Rancheros: I deconstructed mine so as to avoid the tortillas. I think I may have made them better that way. The components were too separated otherwise.  This way, I was able to mix together the carne asada, bell peppers, cheese, avocado, and ranchero sauce. It was simple, but good. I wish they had some sort of jalapenos or something; I asked and somehow there aren't any in the whole kitchen?
-Day two we sampled some omelettes. Not too overcooked and full of ingredients. Solid breakfast.

Where The Henry goes wrong is the service. SLOW! Sometimes it's slow with a smile, other times it's slow with a bewildered look. I feel like I spent half our meal with head turned, searching for someone to bring us something fairly standard, some accompaniment to our meal. Don't go there if you're in a hurry, that's for sure.  If you just need breakfast the morning after? Then The Henry works just fine; you won't be amazed, but you'll certainly be full."}
{"text":"You better make a reservation if you feel like eating here during the lunch or dinner hour! This could be on of the most popular Sam Fox spots I've seen so far. Since day one, it's been nearly impossible to visit without a reservation and that's quite a feat for a restaurant in Arizona! 

This concept is fresh and has a very \"farm to table\" feel to it. Of course it also has a very \"Sam Fox\" feel it, but that's why the seats are full! The decor reminds me of Restoration Hardware and the food tastes like it's fresh from the garden. 

There are three ways to enjoy The Henry: sit-down dine-in, takeout, coffee bar that allows you to work from your computer while you dine. The foo here is very Sam Fox'esque and you can't go wrong with anything you order. During my visit, I ordered the Warm Salmon salad that came with skuna bay salmon, sweet corn, asparagus, white beans, sun-dried tomatoes & smoked onion vinaigrette. Get it. It was fresh, flavorful and filling. The three f's! I also enjoyed a ginger root drink which was a nice drink to accompany my light meal. I can't wait to visit again soon and try more on their menu."}
{"text":"Ordered the club sandwich-  that came in a croissant bun - found a small strand of hair on top of it.  Was hungry and didn't want to go back to the restaurant to return it so I cut out the piece with the hair on it.  However the sandwich didn't taste good.  I've had better tasting sandwiches at Subway.  Also ordered the wings-  were terrible.  Would have been better to just have bought a sandwich at Subway across the street."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast/ brunch in the Cosmo and immediately very impressed with the decor and ambiance. Everyone from the hostess to the waitress was very nice and welcoming. My hubs got the chilaquiles which he thought was good and I got the breakfast burrito which I enjoyed. Everything was satisfactory except maybe the donuts. I ordered it from the enthusiastic recommendation of the waitress but I was not a huge fan. Ended up leaving it mostly uneaten. It would have been nice if the waitress acknowledged the fact that I didn't enjoy it or asked about it. Heck if she offered to comp our coffee or switch out the donuts for toast or anything I would have been a much happier customer. So overall impression 3.5 out of 5, good for a fuss free sit down breakfast where you can expect decent food and reasonable prices (for Vegas) and decent service. I do not recommend the donuts."}
{"text":"Posh resturant convientiently located to the right if the parking elevators here in the cosmopolitan.

Service here was quick and friendly! We walked up to the host table at 1000am, by 1040am we had already ate and paid for the check.Wow!

Started with a cappacino and the banana fosters doughnut to start off with. The beverage was perfect and not bitter at all. The doughnuts was more of a cake like doughnut with the caramel salted glaze. Not bad I was just hoping the doughnut would have been a little more airy. Go with the pastry assortment instead.

For the main course I had the short rib Benny. Savory, smoky beef with perfectly potched eggs on a bed of hashbrowns. What's not to love. 

After one doughnut and the benny I did not feel overstuffed and was ready to tackle walking around the strip. This place is really worth trying."}
{"text":"The Henry is a good spot for breakfast in the Cosmo.  I came here for breakfast with a client, and we each got their egg white omelette with veggies.  I've had my fair share of watery egg white omelettes, and this one was perfect!  Not too salty, just the right size.  We also got coffee and a side of toast.  The toast came with butter and 4 options of jam... yum.

We saw a lot of people around us eating waffles and other breakfast items -- all of them looked great.  The service was fast and also very friendly."}
{"text":"I love every flower child location in the valley. Each one has a little different ambience on the patio. Which is where we love to sit. And if you have you pooch their allowed also. They always have amazing tasting lemonades. And I am in love with the flying avacado..yummmy yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I have dined here at least 10 times over the years during trips to Vegas and The Henry never disappoints.  Breakfast, dinner, or a 3am French Dip...all amazing.  Considering most hotels 24 hour restaurants are merely meh, this place blows them out of the water."}
{"text":"Delicious food right off of Camelback rd and 44th St. I love their happy hour selections & their breakfast is amazing."}
{"text":"Great food and amazing service. I've been here for lunch and dinner a couple times. The food is great, but seems overpriced for what you get. Seems as though you are paying more for the trendy experience and environment, opposed to flavorful food. 

Be sure to take a picture in front of the classic \"The Henry\" sign out front and post!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I went for brunch on the patio and it was perfect, very charming and the food was delicious! The bathrooms are clean and beautiful too- including Edison lights!"}
{"text":"The only late night 24hr restaurant in the Cosmopolitan. Came here for a bite to eat around 12:30-1:30AM during my stay at the Cosmopolitan. Late night menu was limited on choices. I ordered the French Onion Soup and Buffalo Style Chicken Wings. The French onion soup was good but nothing out of this world. They accidentally gave my chicken wings to another table and I had to wait FOREVER to get a new order out. The waiter apologized but offered no concessions for the restaurant's mistake and my inconvenience. My friends' food came out way before my chicken wings did and I had to play catch-up to try and finish them before heading out to the casino floor. I was really unhappy with the service here, considering there was only 4 other tables with guests and the place was NOT busy at all. The atmosphere is cool, right across from the Bond Bar. The DJ was spinning great music and the vibe felt nice. Too bad service sucked and food was mediocre. Price was ok considering it is inside the Cosmopolitan and everything there is usually very expensive."}
{"text":"Best Burger I have had in a long time.  It was cooked perfectly.  The ambiance is nice and fun to people watch those walking into the casino.  The truffle tots were excellent as well.  Minus one star because the service was slow, good, but slow.  I will have to give this place a try (sober this time) when I go back in July and see if the food is still as good as I remember."}
{"text":"Went for the first time when a friend took me for my birthday for lunch. Loved my entire meal. I had the pastrami sandwich with the side of french fries. To drink, I had their hand shaken berry lemonade. The pastrami was so flavorful and the fries are fresh with the skins attached. My friend had a burger and it was good, but I know she was wishing she had mine. Am already craving another sandwich."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying I LOVE Fox restaurants! I've only been here less than 2 years but have been to The Yard, Arrogant Butcher, Culinary Dropout, North several times each and have always had a great experience bar none everytime.
Then I went to The Henry. 
We live only 5 mins away and had twice  tried to stop by for dinner on a weekend with no res. Not possible, unless you want to wait an hour for a table. We have a friend visiting from Canada and she wanted to take us out for a nice dinner as a thank you for the hospitality so I suggested we book a table at Fox's Flagship place, their offices being located upstairs. Booked in for 730pm on Tues night.
Got there at 725pm and our table was waiting for us. Awesome!
But then I tried to say how awesome it was out loud to my wife and our guest, but realized the only way for them to hear me was for me to practically SCREAM! The Henry is LOUD!!! People loud, kitchen loud, music loud, everything loud! And this was a Tuesday!
So there we were kinda half shouting to each other. The server comes over right away. Now I'm not sure how to describe his service but will try. This guy was really animated and talked fast (Also having to kinda yell) and was really friendly, but the whole thing seemed like an act. Everything he said sounded scripted, like the way the daily specials sound but everything was like that. Also it seemed that he was either high on something speedy, or was really in the weeds (frantically busy for you non restaurant peeps) and was trying to put on a friendly demeanor. Our guest  noticed that any questions she had were answered indirectly and long-winded the way politicians will answer stuff. At one point as she tried to order a bottle of wine, he starts going on about \"Well why don't I let you look at the wine list for a few more minutes and I will come back... \"I'm trying to order the wine now.\" says our guest. Awkward moment follows for 2 secs. You get the idea.
I had ordered a can of beer, which arrived promptly. The wine however took about 10min to land, so I had to sit there staring at my glass of beer untouched for the duration as anyone with any decorum knows how gauche it is to sip an alcoholic drink before everyone at the table has a drink in front of them to cheers. 
The menu is interesting, though there isn't a whole lot on there. We split the grilled artichokes which were fine. Same as they are at The Yard. Not amazing but hey, there's no reinventing that dish. 
I had the chicken with kale slaw and mac and cheese. Very well presented and all three delicious. My wife and Guest each wanted two pastas, the mushroom tortelli and the bacon parm gemelli. They asked Server Sketchy if the kitchen could simply split both and plate  two different half orders of  pasta on each plate. He says sure thing. The food arrives and the pastas are not split at all. Then when asked why they weren't split, he says\" Oh, sure thing be right back!\" He comes back with 2 side plates and plops them down. \"We'll need some kind of spoon to divy this up.\" Says my exasperated wife. Off he goes to get a spoon. Then there's the awkward 30 secs of struggling to split the food onto two plates, which totally ruins the foods' presentation. Having a chef do it makes it neat and pretty. Do it yourself makes it look like a dog's breakfast. I should have complained to a manager.
I worked in service for 20 years and the right thing to do was to apologize for the mix up, take the plates back to the kitchen and have a cook split and re-plate the food in an attractive manner the way it was requested. We're not trying to divide up Moons over My Hammy at Denny's!
The pastas did however taste great, though Guest thought the gemelli was too salty. \"It's bacon and Parmesan cheese\" said I, \"Two of the the saltiest foods around which is why they are awesome!\" She's a person who never uses salt on anything. My wife thought it was fine.
The last thing that really clinched this as a mediocre Fox experience was that around 945pm our server started sweeping under the tables in his (our) section. I mean I have done endless side-duties in my career in the biz and I understand wanting to get the hell outta Dodge asap after a long shift, but at/around table duties should ALWAYS wait until every customer in that section is gone. Period. We were going to order some dessert, but as we were obviously over-staying our welcome in this guys' section we just asked for the tab. 
All in all, this was my first and last visit to The Henry. Fox has so many other great places that I really enjoy, there is no need for me to bother. I will say though that as this is their head office location, management needs to tighten the screws on how to provide the great service and dining experience we all have come to expect from a Fox restaurant. You have set the bar high. Maintain it.
I will likely ease my disappointment later this afternoon at North's awesome happy hour."}
{"text":"Absolutely gorgeous interior with a Southern plantation feel. I love a menu that accommodates foodie adventurers and more conservative eaters. Seafood options, ridiculously delicious looking burgers that are practical to eat (not so big around that a normal sized person can't bite into it), and decent salad options for someone trying to eat relatively light.  That being said- anyone who goes to The Henry and doesn't get the truffle oil fries is missing the boat. I'm actually dreaming about them as I write this.  For the folks who prefer to drink their calories, no shortage of options here either. Great cocktail menu, wide selection of carefully chosen beers and a wide selection of wines. This place is the perfect happy hour spot. BONUS- the interior is acoustically pleasing as well. No straining to hear the person across the table from you. It was so inviting for conversation that we actually met and shared an appetizer with the two wonderfully witty gentlemen that sat down next to us. NICE!"}
{"text":"A great new Fox Concepts restaurant! Good food, reasonably priced drinks and cozy patio. I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"I went with some friends here. It was a bit pricey but I enjoyed the roasted chicken and the drinks!"}
{"text":"Awesome place all times of the day.... Went to Marquee on Saturday night, wanted to get some food after alot of Alcohol consumption. Man did their:

Fried Chicken Sandwich and fries 

Hit the spot, nice size sandwich with good quality chicken. My wife an I liked it so much we told the family (20 of us) to go for breakfast!! Man did it hit the spot, so no drunken review here... 

The wings. 
Omelet
Steak and Eggs were VERY good. 
Bloody Mary was one of the best i have ever had!! 

GO HERE, great food and pretty quick service as well...."}
{"text":"I love The Henry. I have been here multiple times for lunch and dinner, and I'm never disappointed. The most recent time, we ordered the popovers which is essentially this very light and airy biscuit. It comes with two butters, one of which was HAM BUTTER! Don't knock it till you try it guys, because it is absolutely delicious! For entrees, I ordered the branzino, my absolute favorite type of fish, and it was so good! Comes with a side of vegetables, everything seasoned and cooked to perfection. I highly recommend it. My boyfriend ordered the short ribs, which were delicious as well. Forget the knife! You won't need it, it is that tender!

We decided to opt out of dessert. But trust me, we were very tempted. The only downfall I would say are the portion sizes, for me, they are large enough to be content, but my boyfriend was still hungry by the time we left.

The decor is beautiful. There is a patio that is fully heated which is where we sat, since there was no wait. It was so pleasant! Perfect temp and lighting. Indoor seating is also a great choice. There is a bar and even a coffee shop on the side if that is your fancy! Love this place, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"This place does get very loud at night.  Bond night club is right across from The Henry and both are open air.  Don't say I didn't warn you.

I went here for a light breakfast before flying home.  No surprise the place was quiet.  We got seated right away.  

Things That Were Awesome:
++ Illy coffee om nom nom nom
++ Irish oats with dried fruit and the house granola.  They even had cute little tins of brown sugar and milk just in case.  I ate that bowl 'til there was nothing left

Things That Were Note So Awesome:
-- Side order of bacon was sort of there.  Not crispy.  I still ate it though.
-- Coffee could have been brewed stronger.  I needed way more caffeine to get over the last two nights in Vegas."}
{"text":"Hotel restaurants are generally just okay... but, in Vegas, the story is different because of the extreme competition among the resort hotels. I've already reviewed the awesome pizza restaurant inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel, but the resort also has another standout restaurant--The Henry, a traditional, sit-down restaurant located near the lobby of the Cosmopolitan. We only visited once during our last trip to Vegas, but the one visit was enough for me to be impressed. It was our final meal of the trip, and we stopped in to get breakfast before heading to the airport. I had the short ribs benedict, and they were very tasty--tender, boneless short ribs served atop a toasted english muffin w/ hollandaise sauce! Nom! Vinny had one of their traditional breakfast meals (w/ eggs, bacon, etc.) and enjoyed his selection as well. Our friend Denise was also with us, and she ordered the breakfast sandwich, which she requested to be altered to meet her vegetarian needs. She was the least impressed with her meal, but she changed the nature of the entire entrée by eliminating some of the ingredients, so I can't really judge the restaurant on this one. 

The decor at The Henry is very traditional, which is in opposition to the overall modern decor of The Cosmopolitan. Nonetheless, the restaurant is very visually pleasing and comfortable! I'd definitely go back to The Henry if I stay at The Cosmopolitan again."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favorite Fox Restaurant Concepts. I have been here twice and both times were phenomenal. The first time I went I balled out and got multiple appies (appetizers) along with my meal and dessert. I feel like I should be guilty for eating all of this food but I am not because I loved trying multiple things they had to offer. I have tried the short rib potstickers, popovers, truffle fries, guacamole, and the goat cheese toast appetizer. With the exception of the truffle fries (didn't really care too much for them) all of the starters were incredible. Main entrees: first time got the braised short rib and freakin loved every bite of it. Second time I got the Korean style steak with vegetable fried rice and damn, they just know how to cook their beef. It was perfectly medium with really great flavor and the vegetable fried rice was on point! First time I went I got the bread pudding for dessert which was fantastic but the second time I got the peanut butter chocolate molten cake and was not too happy with it because it wasn't really a molten cake I was expecting chocolate to be gushing out of the cake and was sad I didn't see that...But overall the ambience, food, and service is all worth coming here. Just expect to spend a little more than average for dinner."}
{"text":"Generally, I am unimpressed with FRC restaurants and have had subpar experiences. Not so at The Henry. Overall, the newest addition to the group wowed myself and out entire group.  Food was above average, service was above average and the cocktails stood out for sure (their version of a Moscow Mule is delish!) 

There were 5 in our group, and we all ordered various meat entrees (I can't speak for the apps myself but my friends were all ohh-ing and ahh-ing over the cheese popovers, Swedish meatball, & chicken and the egg. I am on a stupid diet that doesn't allow any of that fun stuff).  I had the porkchop with cauliflower polenta and chard.  I was surprised by the size of the entree and how perfectly it was cooked.  I ate every last bite and tried the short rib as well which I probably would have ordered if I did it over again.  Maybe next time. 

The menu seems to be more varied and extensive than other FRCs I've been to, which is nice.

I would love to go back for brunch!"}
{"text":"While the cinnamon french toast ($15) is definitely a must-order, everything else we tried ranged from average to disappointing. 

I ordered the short rib benedict ($19) for my main entree and was disappointed to receive one single benedict stack. I'm not sure if they were running low on eggs that day, as I saw the table next to us ordered the traditional benedict and also received one benedict as well. All of the images on Yelp from previous diners at The Henry, and really all of my restaurant experiences everywhere, lead me to believe that I should have received two. For $19, a single benedict was pretty sorry, and it really wasn't all that good anyway. I wouldn't order again. 

My husband ordered the croissant sandwich ($15) and it was probably twice to three times the size of a normal breakfast sandwich. The size of it definitely exceeded my expectations, but the sandwich itself was nothing special. 

As for the french toast - I'm glad we ordered since it was the best food I had on my recent trip to Las Vegas. Both light and crunchy, sweet but not overly sweet. I would definitely recommend getting one for the table to share...it was too much for one person to eat alone. 

We also had some cocktails which were well-crafted and delicious but not particularly memorable. 

Our service was really slow; it took our server nearly 15 minutes to even greet us, and everything after that - water delivery, drinks, food, etc - seemed to take ages. A table next to us (in a different server's section) sat 20 minutes after us and received food before us...so your mileage may vary. And since this restaurant is largely open to the casino, there's not much to speak of in terms of ambiance or atmosphere. It feels like you're eating in a casino. 

We dropped about $100 on breakfast for three entrees, a side, two drinks, and tip. 

This experience reminded me why I stick with the fancy buffets! Wicked Spoon, just a short walk away, offers a better selection of food, where you don't have to wait on the server, and of course, lighter on your wallet."}
{"text":"I could have given 5 stars because everything was so good, but I'm saving my 5 stars for something really crazy, like free delicious food with entertainment and maybe a happy ending. (like chocolate molten cake)
Anyway, we had a superb breakfast yesterday at The Henry. 
I had the Breakfast burrito a it was the best I have had.  It's one of my favorite breakfast while on vacation and I have had quite a few at various locations.  Clem's in Rutland Vermont was also good but not as tasty as this one.
My wife had the eggs, sausage, home fries and she loved it. 
The staff could not have been better and, we ate at 10:30 am and could not eat again until dinner at 7pm, and that's after walking around Vegas all day.
The service could not have been more pleasant or helpful."}
{"text":"This was our first visit for dinner. We like a lot of the Fox Restaurant Concept places and decided to come here because of the location.  Another solid hit in my opinion-we will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, first time here it was everything I thought it to be. Overpriced hotel food (at least in a nice environment) 

I remember trying the burger and supposed \"amazing\" Shortrib Benedict. Neither were that tasty considering the price. The shortrib was actually dry and chewy. (Does not come with ANY sides either)

On the other hand in my last visit (for some reason we like staying at or near the Cosmo) I tried the Croque Monsieur omelet and it was AMAZING. It doesn't look like much but he combo of cheese ham egg was tasty, but best of all the crispy oniony hashbrown thing was one of the best things I've tasted yet. I'd come back JUST for that. (Though it's like $5 if you order it as a side.. quite pricey...) 

And note to future self, after a drunken night, order this and share it with a friend. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"The Henry has a wonderful ambience and AWESOME a menu! Unfortunately the service was lacking as it took us about 20 minutes before we received a drink after being sat. We also got no refills during our meal and were served our entrees at very different times. Half of our party received their plates and the rest had to wait another 20 minutes before the remaining people were served. We also ordered the poached egg and asparagus appetizer which we had to send back because the egg white was undercooked and we did not get it back until we got our entrees. Of our party of 10, three of us got the burger and found it to be mediocre. However, the sandwiches were all delicious as well as the guacamole appetizer. The manager was very apologetic and kind about the poor service. Despite the few issues we had I hope the staff was just having an off day because I would like to come back!"}
{"text":"Really loved dining here - the outdoor space is fantastic! Menu was varied. A little on the pricey side, but if you know that going in, I think you're ok. Convenience to the airport is a major plus, and I can see why a lot of business diners go here. 

It was hard to decide on beer v wine v cocktails here. All of the choices looked amazing. I would definitely come back again - for drinks and/or dinner. We ended up sticking around for most of the night.

Only downside was the service. Our server was pretty bad - he forgot about my wine order several times and took forever to get us our drinks and take our food order. He forgot about a lot of the things we asked for and seemed very distracted and scatterbrained. Our experience improved greatly once the crowds dwindled and our server was replaced with someone who seemed more senior."}
{"text":"The short rib eggs Benedict is one of the most decadent breakfast items imaginable. Couple it with a fruit smoothie to give yourself the illusion of a healthy breakfast.  Service here was good and the atmosphere is American bistro. Would have been nice to have some bread on the table to dip into the short rib au jus. Coffee selection was limited, no mocha. Great one-off experience but you're asking for a heart attack if you eat here on the regular."}
{"text":"WOOOOOW, I had to start off with that to get your attention!

This place is golden! If you're in Vegas you have to eat here....TWICE

The service was great and the food even better. I had the Short Rib Egg Benedict, I think God was in the kitchen whipping with the wrist motion (Drake Reference) ... all seriousness it's a must have. I also had the Eggs and Hash another day..nice and savory can't go wrong! See pics enjoy!"}
{"text":"My buddy and I stumbled into the place after some late night drinking. I really didn't expect much at five in the morning. This place fit the bill with a decent selection of traditional comfort foods like burgers, fish and chips, sandwiches and breakfast served all day.

I had a French onion soup and my wingman stuck with the French theme and ordered the French Dip sandwich. If I remember correctly, I really liked my soup. ;) It was covered in cheese, full of onion bits and tasty. French onion has always been my favorite and this was good. Across the table, Goose devoured his sandwich and the truffle tater tots (darn, I wish I tried one), so I assume he enjoyed his dish.

Solid choice for late night eats!"}
{"text":"My wife and another couple went to The Henry this past Saturday for restaurant week. All of our first times coming here. Has the braised short rib...it was DELICIOUS!  Also had the asparagus Caesar salad and the bread pudding. Lights out man! Excellent. Great service as well. I will be back. Great atmosphere too. Since the weather is getting nice, this would be a great place to hang on the patio and enjoy a glass of wine. I will be back!!! Loved it!"}
{"text":"Great place, good food! Got here around noon on a Saturday, it was a 1/2 hr wait to sit inside (we wanted to sit inside because it was cool in AZ) but there was no wait sitting out on the patio. Well we were hungry, so outside it was! About 10 mins later, we were sat. Luckily we were sat next to a heater. Really thought there would be a long wait for the food, because drinks were a bit
Of a wait, but food came out shortly afterwards. Service was great, food was good, all in all, a good time!"}
{"text":"Food is really good, service however was one of the worst I ever experienced. Aside from the fact that even if we made reservations, we still had to wait 15 min , then once we ordered our food that came after an hour and not even once were we updated on the status of our order. Also ,While we were ordering our entrees, our server recommended to one of my friends the skirt steak , because was cheaper ; that wouldn't have raised any eyebrows, but after we paid our bills we decided to take a group picture in front of the beautiful fireplace, 2 feet away from the table. While we were doing that, our server decided to drop by and check each individual receipt making sure apparently that we paid. He also lifted my mom's purse and for some really weird reason he took away her jacket. I approached him asking him if everything was ok, explaining him that we were only taking some pics and we'll be on our merry way soon... 
Very disappointing! Again, loved the food, simply hated the service!"}
{"text":"Great decor and the food is yum. It is definitely great for a group brunch. The popovers were delicious and so were the coffees. Our breakfast entrees were good although the bruleed grapefruit was more memorable to me. It looked pretty dog friendly as well."}
{"text":"We didn't go here for the regular menu, but their late night menu is great and the service was wonderful! I definitely recommend the Henry if you need a late night snack or meal."}
{"text":"Decent food. Pretty setting. 

The Henry is the Cosmo's version of a coffee shop or diner, with a little bit more pizazz and much nicer booths. The decor and food are slightly elevated from your typical Vegas coffee shop. 

Decor is probably the best part. Very luscious booths and nice comfy chairs.  Gorgeous light fixtures!  The tables along the outer edge of the space, near the entry-way, are not separated from the rest of the hotel by any glass, making for some great people watching as folks walk by coming in from the hotel's street entrance.

The food itself is a bit disappointing. Its just not as good as you're expecting based on the decor. It has a lot of potential and ambitious goals - \"revamped classics\" is their goal. The menu is definitely classic and trying to be revamped, but its not knock-your-socks-off good. There are a lot of places that ARE managing to do the classics in the way that this place is trying to accomplish.  But I'm not gonna totally dis this place and give them the benefit of the doubt...The hotel hasn't been open that long and so hopefully, they'll keep working on the food.

As for what was actually eaten, I had the prime rib plate which comes with mashed potatoes, horseradish sauce and au jus.  It was decent and hit the craving I was having at the moment.  My dining partner had the pot roast, which she said wasn't exactly what she thought it was...but I'd take that comment with a grain of salt since her palette and dining experience are pretty limited. She thought she getting something like a carved hunk of meat but got something that was more like a thick beef stew....in the menu it was described as \"braised short ribs\" so to me it looked like what that sounds like.  

The free breadsticks with dinner are super - nice & soft & warm! Perfect with butter!  My mojito was alright. 

Prices were as expected, not cheap but not outrageous.  

Service was adequate. Actually I guess it was a bit fake?  My dining partner (the boss lady) wanted some sort of cocktail but she wasn't sure what she wanted AND she doesn't really drink anything other than girly fruity drinks so she asked our waiter for a recommendation. He didn't have one so he asked her what she liked..like what specific fruit do you like in your fruity drinks. She told him she wanted something with raspberries. He said he would have the bartenders make her something with raspberries and vodka, \"just for her\"...He came back with a drink with dragonfruit that was straight off the menu!  He told her that the bartender \"thought she might like this one better\" based on what he reported she liked!!! Fake! Whatevs, dude! She was all impressed and thought that was sweet....I just this was dumb and totally not true...The bartender refused to make something off menu. Please. Anyways, its minor but I thought that was lame. Just be honest!  Someone more attentive would not have been pleased with that. 

Pros: Breadsticks, decor, people-watching, comfort foods, simple/familiar items, quality ingredients.

Cons: No bathroom in the resto itself (you'll have to exit & use one of casino level bathrooms).

Great, stable place to eat if you're frequenting the Cosmo. Not worth a special trip just for this place."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this restaurant starting from the ambience, the decor, and the food. Went there for lunch and we all enjoyed the food we ordered. I got the burger. The truffle fries were excellent. Will definitely go there again. Fox concept restaurants usually don't disappoint."}
{"text":"Located near the entrance to Cosmo. We had to wait a good 15-20 min (with people who HATE waiting, this can seem forever), but in the end, it was worth it.

French onion soup = excellent flavors, highly recommended

Tater tots = yum!! couldn't taste the truffle though, but that's okay with me, I don't actually like truffle ;)

Steak = we asked for this medium rare and blackened. Not only did they deliver both PERFECTLY (have you ever asked for medium rare and it turned out medium?), the blackening was amazing. They even added a slightly spicy chili rub to it that went perfectly.

My husband and I were able to share the steak (which they actually cut in half for us to serve on separate plates - very nice of them!) and we both felt like it was enough food, while the bill came out to be a very reasonable $50ish. :)"}
{"text":"Awwww- so disappointed. Took my family for Easter Brunch yesterday and everything was either too salty or bland and the signature cocktails were pricey and watered down. This is usually one of my go to places but I don't think I will be back.  Also, I would suggest you leave the \"bunny ears\" at home next year. Easter or not - It's a restaurant - not a night club. You have a reputation/atmosphere that should not need gimmicks - just deliver good food. Something has changed over there...I'm giving it 3 stars because the service was great."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch for the first time with my boyfriend. Be sure to make a reservation if you are planning on going in for brunch on the weekend as they are packed! Our waiter was not very attentive to us at all (probably talked to us twice) because it was packed and she totally forgot to bring us our drinks (the Wildflower coffee and a fresh squeezed orange juice) which we ended up getting for free (at the end of our meal...). However, my boyfriend got the egg sandwich and it was really good, while I got the breakfast burrito--it was pretty yummy. The fresh squeezed orange juice was our favorite part-- so delicious! And I will be back to visit the coffee bar and try their other coffee flavors."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my Sunday morning breakfast at the Henry counter and received excellent service from Attila. The prices at this open light area are double or triple what you'd pay at a diner anywhere else and the wall art is odd - a woman with a riding whip in her mouth with sm overtones. Still I savored every bite of breakfast -those potato cakes were fantastic. The only minus is for undertoasted bread. Three instead of four stars for that. I'll be back because the food quality was excellent, classic with a little twist."}
{"text":"Every time we dine here, the waiters are outstanding. Kind, energetic, personable and overall great. Thank you for memorable dining experiences."}
{"text":"The meal itself was solid.  I had the Henry breakfast (usual breakfast platter), with sunny side up eggs and ham.  The other members of my party had a ham and cheese omelette and the Henry with eggs over medium.  My meal was average (well cooked but nothing special).  The ham and cheese omelette was outstanding though.  The difference was caramelized onions inside the omelette that tasted great and were a great addition to the dish.  We also ordered, and shared, a berry smoothie.  It was too sweet, very small, and too expensive, overall.

This restaurant is located in the Cosmo, so I expected the price, but it was 1.5x the true value for the meal.  Also, it took us 35 minutes to sit down (though the hostess said it would be 15 minutes), so that also factors into my rating."}
{"text":"Experienced a great breakfast with good service in a really nice venue. See the other pictures posted by others to see what we ate: smoked salmon Benedict, pot roast Benedict, Henry's breakfast and cinnamon French toast. Great coffee too. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We love their breakfast here. Little pricey but it's extremely satisfying. Good food and service. Average price per plate is around $18. Steak and eggs $28 (?)"}
{"text":"I respect Sam Fox for his creative and diverse restaurants and so was looking forward to experiencing his latest: The Henry. On a whim, I took my Valentine there yesterday (Valentine's Day), no reservation, 6pm. We were immediately able to be seated on the front patio, which is first come first serve. The inner and outer decor were equally impressive; personally this is my favorite design theme out of any Sam Fox concept. Our waitress was nice and all the service was excellent. But unfortunately, the food was sub-par. 

Beginning with the kale and garlic dip, this was definitely the best dish we had. Above average. Next the artichoke hearts were a very small portion and decent. The Brussel Sprout Caesar was disappointing and I couldn't even eat my overly-saucy, overly salty mushroom tortellini. To their credit, the waitress noticed I hadn't touched the entree and immediately removed it from the bill. While this was an appreciatively kind gesture, it still didn't make up for how both my honey and I wound up with stomach aches and had to go to bed. Not a romantic end to our Valentine's at The Henry.."}
{"text":"El mejor lugar de las vegas, no lo dude entre y desayune en este lugar.... tienen todo muy fresco.....100% Recomendable."}
{"text":"Good food. If you're going for brunch make a reservation. I think they accept those. Late night is good there too. It's beautiful. Service can be a little slow sometimes but tasty dishes. Nice ambiance. Nice date spot too."}
{"text":"The Henry was just the laid back bar we were looking for adjacent to a much more hipster bar with live DJs. So we got the benefit of the music from that while sitting in our comfy cushioned bar chairs. We ordered a few cocktails and decided to eat just a little something. We didn't want a full meal, but saw they offered up truffle tater tots as a side. We asked the bartender if we could order just that side and she instantly obliged. They arrived very quickly and we were in foodie awe. Where have these been all of our lives?!?! We have truffle salt at home but never thought about this combo. We ended up ordering a second plate of tots and are thinking of coming back to get more before our trip is over. If you come here for dinner or for a drink, order the truffle tater tots."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. First they brought out the wrong food. After I took a bite i realized they gave me someone else eggs. Then They bought out the 2nd eggs and they were not right. So i just gave up. The Calf omelet says Avocado, They have Guacamole on it. Its different. Sorry, but eggs are just not that hard to make. The manager did come over and they took it off my bill. Yes not going to pay for something you got wrong."}
{"text":"Spent a week in Phoenix and enjoyed the food, decor, vibe so much that we ate there twice.
Kale & apple salad was excellent, along with the black code, short rib, skirt steak (the most tender skirt steak I've ever eaten) and the salmon. We loved the cheddar popovers. Great cocktail menu and wine selection.  We thought the prices were fair.  Kudos to a great wait staff."}
{"text":"I've had this place booked marked for awhile and when our friends came to visit, we thought this would be the perfect place for Saturday brunch. I thought the interior design was cute. I loved the open kitchen and I loved that everything on their menu is made from scratch. Our server was awesome. Very friendly and helpful with the menu and she was attentive . We started off with some passion fruit & mango and mixed berry mimosas. I ordered the Chicken Bahn Mi and it was pretty delicious! Big chunks of chicken with all the toppings and I liked that the bread wasn't hard . Usually Bahn Mi sandwiches the bread is hard and it can cut the top of your mouth. 
We also got some coffee and macarons. Good coffee and the macarons was one of the best I've tasted in a while. 
I am only giving this place 4 stars because when we first arrived I went to go give my name so we can be seated. The hostess said it would be 20 mins and asked me for my name. So I thought she was going to come get us when a table was ready. As we were waiting we saw that other groups were getting seated before us and there were tables available. When we went to go see how much longer it would be, she said she could seat us now.
If we didn't go up and ask about our table, we would have waited longer. The funny thing is , we were sitting near the front and in clear view of the hostess stand. She could have easily came over and got us but instead she just stood there. 
Besides that, we enjoyed everything and I will definitely be coming back to try some more food from the menu"}
{"text":"I was heartbroken when Sam Fox closed Bloom in North Scottsdale.  Of all of his restaurants, the Henry is my favorite.  Now that he shuttered his steakhouse, the Henry stands alone as the most upscale of the offerings.  This makes sense as it is right next to the corporate headquarters of course.  The people who dine here are very pretty.  Stepford wife pretty.  Be forewarned.  The bar offers a wonderful list of cocktails heavy on the classics and a lot of wonderful bourbon offerings for which I have a definite weakness for.  The salads will be familiar (you can similar versions at Arrogant Butcher or Culinary Dropout), but the entrees are much more refined.  I had the branzino, which next to the branzino offering at Virtu, is one of the best I've ever found in Arizona.  Do not miss dessert, croissant bread pudding handily eclipsing the version that I used to crave weekly at Sierra Bonita.  So brave the Stepford Wives and head out.  (The acoustics could use some work, during lunch or crowded hh's you do have to shout a bit).  The service however is exquisite.  Attentive without being intrusive.  If nothing else, the Sam Fox guys need to teach a course on how to train servers for other restaurants to emulate."}
{"text":"Food 3 Stars
Beverage 0 Star
Service 0 Star (see below)

Food is good, but they're really cheap on their juices.  I don't mind pricey food in Vegas, but I had problems with ordering juice with them three times.  

We went for lunch and snacks a few times because the Cosmo did not have many options for lunch.  It's not the waitress's fault, nor the bartender.  I believe it's the head bartender who just didn't want to give us more juice.   

The first day, our cranberry/pineapple juice cocktail (non-alcoholic) came in a regular-sized glass.  The second day, it came in a small glass about half the size, so we kindly talked to the waiter and he brought back the juice in a taller glass.  We did notice, however, that he sort of had difficulties with the bartender.

The third occasion, the juice came in a small cup again, so we kindly asked a different waiter who happened to be very friendly help us.  No questions asked he made us happy.

The fourth time, this female waitress says to us that they simply pour more ice into the glass if we wanted the juice in the regular sized glass.  So of course, we get the juice in a regular sized glass (not full).  Was that supposed to make us feel better?  Did she think we were being cheap?  The casino invites me to the high rollers tables, but this restaurant does not get a great review from me, nor extra tip $.

We never once asked to speak to the manager, nor gave attitude to the waiters or waitresses.  We even asked the waiters if they had problems. 

*In case the managers of the restaurant are wondering, we visited 5/15/12-5/18/12.  Will not be back to The Henry.  No customer satisfaction.  Sorry."}
{"text":"The menu had the Prime Rib dinner at $21 however it is actually $28. I ordered over the phone and didn't think anything of the guy not telling my total because I saw the price on the menu. Loe and behold I show up and it's $28!!! I ask them to check on this and they said 'sorry the websites not updated. You still want it?'   I was furious!  Really? A joint in Cosmo can't cover a $7 glitch in the name of customer service?  Never will I go back here again. HORRIBLE! 

DO    NOT     EAT    AT    THE     HENRY!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for dessert. Let me tell you their dessert and coffee was the best! We ordered their chocolate peanut butter lava cake with vanilla ice cream. It was rich and creamy inside. The best part of the cake was that it was filled with peanut butter and it paired well with the vanilla ice cream and coffee. I forgot what coffee I ordered but it was pretty strong. Their atmosphere is very inviting, clean, and service was great. This place is a great place to lounge around while enjoying a good conversation with friends or even with your boyfriend."}
{"text":"I loved The Henry, the atmosphere was wonderful, we sat in the front because we had our puppy with us. It felt as is we were in a French bistro. We went inside and it's just as beautiful. Lots of attention to detail. The food is delicious. I had a turkey French dip and finished every last bite. We had a few cocktails that were amazing. Great place with great service and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The Henry is a cute and fun little spot worth trying out.  The ambiance is like walking into spring and starbucks at the same time.  

I came here with a friend on a busy Sunday and the place was definitely popping with patrons.  I definitely wanted to check out their Bloody Mary cart served up like Dim Sum, but alcohol was not on my mind that morning.

I just ordered their specialty coffee The Butcher since I needed to wake up and it did it's job!  I like my coffee black.  For my entree I shot for the Le Pig Sandwich; scrambled eggs, ham, havarti cheese, mayo, and served on a croissant with side of quartered potato hash.  Overall, I didn't really care for the sandwich since I found it pretty bland and had to add my least favorite condiment; ketchup.  I think if they used prosciutto and some pepper jack cheese it would have added some flavor and pop. 

In the end, the atmosphere is worth the while and the coffee and bloody mary bar still is calling me. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We had a great time.  After we finished brunch, my friend and I were chatting and they needed our table for a larger party; so they moved us to a reserved spot in the lounge area and gave us a free coffee for our trouble."}
{"text":"This establishment opened to the public today, I have to tell you the staff must have rehearsed prior to the opening day.  As with many restaurants I've visited on the first day one can tell there were some wrinkles to iron out as far as food and service.  With The Henry was no such things as wrinkles on a cloth..  the food and service went far... far.. beyond my extreme highest expectations.  Allow me to point out a few highlights:

1. The entire staff (greeter, host and wait staff) were very friendly and made the place very welcoming.

2.  The food and service was impeccable.  The food tasted fresh and was of very high quality.  I had the 1/2 chicken and I never had a de-boned chicken before (only bone found was the leg piece - I almost thought I've already eaten the breastbone!). Also finished drinks and plates were promptly removed by literally the next waiter/waitress that passed our table, I doubt not that many wait staff returned to the kitchen with empty hands!

3.  The establishment also has a coffee bar section with ample seating to break out the laptop and surf the web with their blazing fast wi-fi (I performed a speed test and clocked the wi-fi download speed at 10+Mbps !!).  I noticed there were like 3 other meeting rooms with TVs next to the coffee bar area and not certain if they are open for general seating during non-booked times (as I found more plug ins in there for laptops than in the main area). I look forward to chilling out in the coffee bar area after work in the near future.

As with any of the foxrc establishments I've visited I've always experienced food and service to be far superior than other restaurants I've reviewed in the past.  Keep up the good work foxrc! 

As for the person who gave this place one star, I would imagine you will rate The Henry 5 stars upon your first visit! :-)"}
{"text":"Aside from Wicked Spoon, The Henry was our only other dine-in option before 5 PM at Cosmo.. Ordered the Traditional Benedict, Short-rib Benedict, side of potatoes,  and Mimosa.  Both dishes were DELISH :] If I had to choose, I would prefer the Short-rib over Traditional just because it's breakfast with a twist~ Everything on the menu seemed a bit over-priced for what it was... especially the sides because those portions are tiny... But it's Vegas!"}
{"text":"I generally like all other Fox concept restaurants and was looking forward to coming here. Came here for one night for late dinner on weekend and it was just okay for me.

Started with fresh guacamole and after a few bites, it was nothing to write home about. I don't think I would order again.

From dinner menu, I ordered seared ahi tuna poke. Tuna was flavored good but everything else was underwhelming. 

Service was good, she was friendly."}
{"text":"Went there for happy hour yesterday.   I wanted to see if the HH menu was as good as the dinner.  

Ordered my usual manhattan; trying it with Bulleit Bourbon.   I've never knowingly had Bulleit Bourbon.   The manhattan was good, but I think the BB is not my first choice.   

Ron was our server.   Very friendly, professional, competent server.   We ordered the Korean tacos, which I have no idea what made it \"Korean,\" but it was good although I'm not a fan of corn tortillas.   They aren't very big, two on a plate.   I'd skip the tortillas, unless they could use flour, and just have the topping.

Our other order was the truffle oil fries.   They were good.   Came hot.   

If you are going for happy hour, probably a good idea to get there soon after opening.   We did get a seat, but it was between the two entrance doors.   Therefore, every time it opened, the warm air made its entrance."}
{"text":"Recently my book club met up at The Henry for brunch. The menu is simple but enticing. I told my server that I was vegan and she suggested the Spring Harvest Bowl and she was right in telling me how delicious it was. The other ladies had various options from the breakfast plates to avocado toast with egg. I loved the decor and seating options in the restaurant  they are very warm and inviting. Another added bonus was that there were covered parking spots in available. I will definitely return to The Henry especially if they add more vegan options to the menu."}
{"text":"Finally!!! We got a chance we to eat here. We made sure that we have reservation even for breakfast. We see that there seem to be a line here. They have the short ribs benedict. That's the reason why we wanted to try this place for months now but ended up not being able to. BF got the short ribs benedict and I got the cinnamon roll french toast. Both were good. Benedict's eggs are on the runny side, short ribs is on the salty side, but if combined with the egg, its good and if combined with the french toast, much better, it has the sweet and savory effect. Service was ok."}
{"text":"The Henry is a hip eatery that offers an excellent culinary experience with a great ambiance. 

Food: Excellent. I'm a vegetarian, and so it can be hard to find really good food. But, the quinoa tacos were delicious! I would get them again in a heartbeat. 

Ambiance: Excellent. One of the things that I really liked was the open feel in the restaurant. There is plenty of natural lighting, high ceilings, and a modern feel. It is busy during lunch times, which is a plus in my book. I like to be in the presence of other people who are enjoying their food as much as I am. The patio is fantastic as well.

Great for social calls or business meals. I will be frequenting The Henry often."}
{"text":"Besides my fondness for bald men, Peter, the manager on duty was especially accommodating. It was my birthday and he made it super enjoyable (I started early, no questions asked) When I first walked in to the place I realized there was a distinction between the coffee area and restaurant itself, I had a the butcher with 4 shots of espresso (who doesn't these days) and waited for my gf in the lobby area. The decorating was superb, concrete walls with embroidered mid century sheer drapes. Krystal set up the bar and served us a couple champ bottles requested for my birthday. Vanessa, Emily and Ali are the best barista's, after only a couple visits they already knew my usual order. I will continue to be a fan, working from this location has been a blast"}
{"text":"First time coming here and I do say, the food was great! 

We were seated right away. Our waiter came and took a little while to get us our drinks.. But made up to it by being quick on getting our entrees ready quickly and always checking up on us to see if we needed anything additional or refills. 

I would defiantly come back here and have another delicious breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"I love The Henry!!! I usually go for brunch but went with a girlfriend for Friday night dinner and drinks, everything was great!
Seth our waiter was AMAZING! So friendly, attentive and we were never without anything. I tried his signature dish, the Bolognese with the Braised Short Rib on top......to die for!!! Thanks Seth!!!!

{"text":"After seeing the reviews, my husband and I popped in here for a casual dinner on a Tuesday evening before a show across town.

It was relatively early (around 7) and there weren't many others in the restaurant. The space is a little odd if you've never eaten in a casino restaurant before - it's quite open compared with some of the other bar areas - but nicely decorated and manages to hold onto a little bit of atmosphere for itself.

The service was fine, not super attentive or friendly but, well, serviceable. We ordered beer and wine along with the buffalo chicken tenders to start. The tenders were good, and the buffalo sauce one of the spiciest I've had. Tasty, but builds fast. A good start.

The mains, though, were thoroughly mediocre. I had the ragu bolognese which could have been hotter. There was a good amount of cheese on top but it wasn't spread very evenly and kind of clumped in places. The sauce was a little bland, not as warming as I'd hoped. The rigatoni was soft (though I've come to expect that outside of Europe). My husband had the meatloaf which is Sriracha-glazed.

For dessert we went for the chocolate fudge cake, which was in fact more like a chocolate gateau with fudge sauce on top. Decent, but not really what I had in mind. It also wasn't heated so it was quite firm and stuck to the roof of your mouth - but because it was already finished with the sauce on top it felt too late to ask them to heat it up.

Overall, pretty bog standard, really, and I'm sure there are better meals to be had for $130 for two, even in Vegas. I heard good things about the brunch so I'd come back for that, but not for dinner."}
{"text":"First time visit. This was a great place! Came for dinner. We ordered the Kale and Garlic Dip to start. Had lots of potential. But was REALLY salty. Now for the good stuff. My wife ordered the heirloom tacos (added shrimp). YUM. I ordered the Steak sandwich. Superb! The meat was super tender. And the flavor was perfect. And the ambience in this place was top notch. A solid 4 star find!"}
{"text":"Meh - It was an ok place for Sunday brunch, bit overpriced for the value, not many vegan options on the menu. I appreciated how well they took care of my dog - brought her meal in a dog dish for her and cut up her bacon per my request."}
{"text":"My partner and I took a friend visiting from Los Angeles to The Henry for his and our first time, and all three of us loved it.  The decor feels like I imagine an expensive mens' club would look -- real leather banquettes and table lamps I wanted to take home (just one).  My partner had the pork chop (the thickest one I've seen since Dan Tana's in West Hollywood, easily 2.5 inches thick, I had the wild mushroom tortelli, and our friend (who is very hard to please) had the branzino.  All three of us gave our dishes top marks.  

Even better than the food and the decor, however, was the service.  Our friend had driven in from Los Angeles that day and we had been running errands and cleaning house, so all three of us lay down for what was supposed to be a one-hour nap.  Unfortunately we woke up almost three hours later at 8:00 p.m.  We had planned to eat at The Henry, but when I checked their website I saw they stopped serving at 9:00 p.m.  I called and was told to come in, it wouldn't be a problem.  We showed up and people couldn't have been more gracious.  We never felt rushed, and when my partner and our friend wondered if it was too late to order dessert (by this time it was well after 9:00 p.m.) the chef reopened the kitchen and they got what they wanted -- no attitude at all.  

My only caveat is that a co-worker and his partner had brunch there about a week ago and the partner apparently got a bad case of salmonella from undercooked eggs in an omelet, so I think I may avoid egg dishes if I go for brunch (or at least make sure the eggs are cooked through)."}
{"text":"If you want to go somewhere for good food only then fine eat here. But everything else about this place sucked. The food was good but the music was so loud me and and my boyfriend had to shout at each other to hear one another. The service was terrible. We both ordered a Coke and I'm sure that crappy drink was a Pepsi but either way it was warm with only a few ice cubes. Our food took 30 mins to get to our table. When we finished our waiter was nowhere to be seen and we waited so long to pay. For some reason they put sweet pickles in the burgers, who the hell does that. Anyways, overall the burger and tater tots were good but it honestly wasn't worth all the trouble. Also it's pretty rare I ever put a bad review so that should say allot."}
{"text":"Came for drinks and to kill some time. Bartender was very friendly and easy to talk to. Atmosphere is nice... old world library setting. TVs on the wall to catch football and whatever else interests you. Bartender was very nice to change the channel per our request so we can watch the WSOP November nine live.

Food looked really good judging from those around us. Will have to give it a try next time!"}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss for me. I have been. On a few different occasions and the drinks are always top notch. Most of the apps are great too...but the main courses have always left something to be desired for me. I still hate the note card on the table to mark that you haven't had service, it shows inexperience, and often times you're still waiting to long with the card. 

I typically just for for drinks and apps. I'll have to try dessert now that I have read a couple reviews on that."}
{"text":"It's a hassle to get served if you don't have a reservation.  The bar area is packed and you really have to move fast to score a place to sit.

That being said, the swedish meatballs were excellent!"}
{"text":"We'll be back! The Henry is beautifully appointed and very comfortable. It's somehow intimate despite its vast interior. The only thing I'd like to see is more vegetarian-friendly food. The drink specials are also only by the bar and are difficult to see."}
{"text":"Came for brunch for the first time and fall in love with the place. We had turkey sandwich and tuna poke bowl, the sandwich was ok but the bowl was beyond my expectation."}
{"text":"the ambiance/circuses are ok....but the food is actually fast food hiding in fancy clothing...expensive but mehhh. the popovers are no way near as good as those at BLT /camelback Inn.  The place is ok but kind of caters to the Arcadia types and takes advantage of them. Expense does not match the value."}
{"text":"My bartender crystal was the best ! Super friendly and accommodating. Recommended the spicy drink (can't remember the name) but it was amazing so I had two ! I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Awesome food!  Casual yet eclectic. Had the salmon over almond quinoa with slightly lemony taste. The salad is served with dressing on the side, always a plus in my book especially because the greens aren't drowning and you can pick how much dressing you want. The popovers are light amd fluffy and herb butters flavorful. Also had a spinach type dip with lemony undertones with pita. Delicious. But to top it off ordered the chocolate hazelnut with bourbon cherries and brittle, called \"budina\".  Not overly sweet but a great end to a delicious meal. They also serve breakfast and lunch. Its a must on my list sometime."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch/brunch. Food is always great, always. Noisy, but worth it! Yum! We made a reservation because they can get very busy."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great atmosphere. We live close and will definitely dine there again. The reason for the four-star review is they were 15 minutes late in seating us. We were seated outside on the side patio and it was a little crowded. (Lights from the cars in the parking lot were also a little distracting) Other than that everything was perfect. Sam did a good job on this one but there is room for improvement."}
{"text":"I WANTED to like The Henry. I like the comfort food schtick, I like that it is open 24/7 and Henry is the name of my awesome cat. How can you go wrong? READ AND LEARN.

We waited forever to have our order taken and then we waited forever to get our food. They ran out of some ingredient in the specialty bloody mary I ordered so I just got a plain one, which was decent. For my entrée, I had the short rib benedict which could have been amazing but was just ok. Some of my food was cold, too.

I get the impression that many things on their menu sound delicious but are executed poorly. I won't be back! There are too many good restaurants on the strip to put up with the negligent service (it took over 1.5 hours for what should have been a quick breakfast and I was never once offered a drink refill) and mediocre quality at The Henry."}
{"text":"Need a late night quick fix when all the other restaurants have closed...then The Henry is your go to place at the Cosmopolitan.  Good selection of \"American Style\" food.  We had the Henry burger and the French Dip.  Both were just excellent.  The burger tasted like it just came off the BBQ grill. Flavorful meat, with cartelized onions, cheddar and mushrooms on a toasted premium bun.  Yum!  The French dip was equally delicious stacked with a mound of roast beef bursting with flavor.  Prices were on the moderate size ($15 and above)...but the food was great and the only other choice would have been a bag of chips from the room...and that would have cost about as much!"}
{"text":"Likely my favorite place in the valley! Not only is the food fantastic but it is  a great space to work (coffee shop/working space). I love spending time at The Henry; beautiful and classy."}
{"text":"Went here for my first time and I fell in love. The decor is amazing just like every fox restaurant. The Henry however is a more relaxed casual feeling but yet still manages to be high class. We went for breakfast and ordered the brûlée grapefruit, smoked salmon, sample of pastries. Yeah that was just our appetizers! The smoked salmon is to die for, it is on top of some hash brown. Strongly recommend it! Over all our meals and appetizers were phenomenal and well worth the price, which wasn't too bad. Excited to try there dinner menu."}
{"text":"The Henry is a place that sometimes I go to twice in one day.  Fantastic restaurant with beautiful indoor seating, a nice patio, and a coffee bar if you are on the run.  Plan to bump into someone you know.  Great atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast while staying at the Cosmo. Sat at the bar, the menu was ok. Nothing special but the food I ordered was good. The bartender was very nice and did a great job at service."}
{"text":"We stayed at The Cosmopolitan a few weeks back and, as you do in Vegas, had a gratuitous amount of drinks. This is where The Henry comes in clutch. Exactly what you need for a nightcap.

They offer a Late Night Menu full of solid bar food ranging from Fish & Chips to Buffalo Wings. We were able to walk right in, grab a table, and got a server with the patience of a saint that took good care of us and made sure our drinks were full. I'd definitely recommend this place to anybody searching for a late night snack before they go off to bed... or whatever comes next. Don't forget to tip your servers!"}
{"text":"2.5 Stars by my standard, but rounded up because the restaurant itself is decent and waitress was super friendly.  Located inside Cosmopolitan Hotel by the Boulevard Tower, this is a restaurant with a reasonably priced menu.  It's an open restaurant with heavy foot traffic, so this might not be the place for you if you want to eat in privacy.

Came here for food late in the night and had my eyes set on the Meatloaf.  Couldn't help but think that I am a happy camper for finding something I like for $18 in a casino.  Unfortunately, dinner is only served until 10pm.  Settled for my second choice from the available menu and placed my order for the Signature Short Rib Benedict ($20).   The soft poached egg was done to perfection, but unfortunately the entire dish was drenched in the salty short rib sauce.  We should have complained, but it was too late at night and we were too hungry, so our entire group washed the Short Rib Benedict with hash brown and water.

Would I eat here again?  Perhaps.  It is reasonably priced and service was good.  But would I order the Signature Short Rib Benedict again?  Probably not."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service, but SLOW SLOW SLOW. Had the meatloaf- FANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times for brunch. First time the food was OK, nothing amazing. Second time however, the entire restaurant failed on everything possible, and I ended up leaving on an empty stomach after 2 hours.
Place was loud, tables are very close together, the table next to ours was \"bro-fest\" and hence very loud. 
The kitchen failed to deliver orders on time, other tables were served prior to ours even though we ordered first, both our orders were returned to the kitchen FOUR TIMES, and all four times they came back WRONG. We simply ended up not eating here and went elsewhere for breakfast.
While the manager (Kolin) was apologetic, I do not think that his staff paid any attention to the failed orders. 
I would not recommend this place due to the utterly lack of service and quality. I have never left a restaurant on an empty stomach, until my last visit at The Henry."}
{"text":"The Henry is in the Cosmopolitan hotel and fits well as an anytime spot for food.  We went for breakfast and just missed the rush at around 9AM. The look of the restaurant is similar to the Cosmopolitan hotel with a clean, sleek feel.

I tried their special version of eggs Benedict that was with short rib.  It was stacked with potato on the bottom, short rib, and the poached egg on top. I really enjoyed it, considering the quality and that we were eating in a hotel the price at around $17 was pretty reasonable.

The service was really slow and seemed a bit out of sync.  We went there twice for breakfast on our trip and experienced it both times. If you need to get out of there quickly you may need to let them know.  Other than that it is a solid spot to get a bite at the Cosmo."}
{"text":"I have had The Henry bookmarked for a long time because of the much raved about French Dip. I finally knocked the bookmark off this past week. It was about 11 pm when we arrived and the hostess seated us right away. We were put into a corner that left us no elbow room, so hubby asked the hostess if we could move to a different spot. She moved us to a half booth and half table. That didn't end up much better at first, but we moved the table around a bit so we had room and it turned out fine. Our server was nice however we did have to flag him down for drink refills. 

French Dip ($18) - Shaved prime rib, Swiss cheese and au jus on a French roll. I asked for the horseradish sauce to be left off. This also came with my choice of a few different sides and I chose the Truffle Tater Tots. The sandwich was not as great as I has hoped for. If you look at other pictures of yelp of this sandwich you will see there is a lot more meat in those ones compared to mine. The prime rib was tender, but lacked a lot of flavor. The bread was stiff even after dipping it into the au jus. The tater tots were nothing special and I tasted nothing truffle whatsoever. The total was $50 including tax (before tip) for just 2 sandwiches, 2 sides and 2 sodas. I wasn't impressed and have experienced better at other places both on and off the strip, so I can't see coming back."}
{"text":"Had a birthday dinner there for a friend. The service was great and the food was tasty. I ordered the cod which was good, we also had the popovers.  I am a huge popover fan and they were good but not great.  Overall, we had great service with good food at a reasonable price for dinner, drinks, apps and dessert."}
{"text":"perfect breakfast.
oats, yogurt parfait and croissant egg sandwich.
service was awesome!
very attentive waiters.  yummy latte.
great choice."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere inside and out. Wonderful service as well. The food however, didn't do much for me. I had the roasted turkey French dip sandwich with truffle fries and short rib potstickers as an app. The potstickers were amazing. The citrus sauce they came with was so good. The sandwich and fries were unfortunately both a bit on the bland side.  Kind of a bummer for a place with such a cool vibe."}
{"text":"First this is your typical casino restaurant. You look across and some sad casino bar (sad for the patrons and less for the bar itself) and the casino. The service is slow but friendly. The food was surprisingly ok. The potato skins were tasty if not a little unconventional, I had the chicken which was actually pretty good, the vegetables were pretty bland and the mash potatoes were also fair.  If want to eat without waiting, watch some losers drink their sadness into numbness and don't mind overpaying then plop yourself into The Henry."}
{"text":"I came to a baby shower hosted at the henry over the weekend. The place was easy to find and there was ample parking. The space reserved for us was private and the decor was absolutely charming. There were small food offerings which were all pretty decent, and we even had a private bartender. I would probably come back to try this place out for a real meal; it certainly seems like it would deliver."}
{"text":"Decided to give The Henry a go for breakfast. It took an unreasonable amount of time to be seated. Our server was very friendly and attentive. Unfortunately I was the only person that enjoyed my breakfast. I ordered the corned beef hash and eggs. I thought it was an exceptional dish. Eggs were perfectly over easy and ran well when mixed with the delicious hash. Toast was a bit over done. Coffee was excellent but the Bloody Mary was \"way too spicy\" and I like em spicy."}
{"text":"Great food!! The shrimp appetizer is to die for! Nice big pieces of jumbo shrimp! Their cocktails drink are a bit pricey but I think it's average at any place upscale. I love that they have a little coffee shop too!! Dinner menu is awesome as well"}
{"text":"There is no front hostesses. There is a random desk in the middle of the restaurant. Made walking in the door a little weird.

The service was great, and our waitress was fantastic. We sat on the patio and loved it, very cute set up. 

The food was ok, nothing amazing. My sides were like warm. Our chicken was ok, a little weird. Chewy and fatty parts. 

Glad I tried it, but wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"We came for late dinner and this place offered a nice selection of foods. Everything we ordered was fresh and tasty. First we order cheese tator tots which included beef and sour cream. Our entrees included Henry salad, French dip sandwich and BLT. Best part was the truffle tators and donuts filled with banana foster. Our server Craig was fabulous and attentive. We enjoyed the food and will return."}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Went with the California omelette suggestion. It was pretty good. Huge cup of coffee which was strong but good as well. My husband got yogurt and granola parfait with a side of fresh fruit which was exactly what he wanted. Larry our waiter was chipper and very nice. Great place for breakfast in comparison to The Wicked Spoon - 45.00 pp buffet upstairs. I'm sure that was also good but we just aren't into eating mass qualities of food, K?"}
{"text":"Congrats to FRC on creating yet another awesome dining option in my hood!

I love that The Henry...
-is super close to my house
-has a decent sized parking lot
-has a fast casual option as well as a sit-down option
-offers a diverse menu for any time of day including coffee and smoothies, breakfast sandwiches, lunch salads, sandwiches, and entrees
-has some fabulous cocktails
-has a solid free wifi connection
-and a kids' menu too!

I've been in during the day a few times and once for a date night.  To date, I've tried the following menu items:
-americano (I know - boring... but I do plan on trying some of their specialty coffee drinks in the future!)
-protein smoothie
-chef chopped salad
-warm kale & roasted garlic dip
-wood grilled artichoke hearts
-Thai peanut black cod
-vodka & pulp cocktail

Everything I've had to date, I've been pleased with... and it's worth noting that even if you order from the coffee bar, they are accommodating and will customize a menu item for you.  For example, when I ordered my chopped salad, I requested no ham and added avocado... and it was no problem!

FRC did a great job with the ambiance and modern decor too... the place has great energy to it!  I haven't taken advantage of the outdoor seating just yet, but they also have a pretty spacious outdoor patio.  

Last thing to note: MAKE A RESERVATION!  I attempted to head in for lunch one week day with a party of 2 (without a reservation) and it would have been over an hour wait.  And on the Saturday night date night, we never would have gotten seated if it weren't for our reservation.  This place gets packed... and for good reason!"}
{"text":"Wanted to have lunch here today.  Not even a chance of finding a parking spot.  We even went in the back of the entire complex and not a spot to be had that wasn't marked \"reserved.\"  So many of these new restaurants don't supply adequate parking for their patrons! Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"The best thing was that the restaurant was just lovely and the service was superb.  My husband made a comment before going, that he guessed it would be 'hipster' in nature....overpriced food with small portion sizes. While the food was great and the ambiance wonderful, the portions were very small for the price (literally 6 tortellini pieces in a  pasta dish that cost $18). We went to eat sushi after because we were still hungry. However, I find that to be the case for most fancier type restaurants, so I wasn't really surprised by that.   They were very accommodating to the vegetarian and vegan in our group...so A+ there!!"}
{"text":"Matt was our server and was PHENOMENAL!!!!!  He guided us through the menu and helped us choose delicious entrees. From there he was so incredibly knowledgeable on the cocktail menu to help us not only have dinner drinks but after dinner drinks. The scotch monroy is amazing and is something I would have never tried without Matt's expertise."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick dinner with my friends here on the last night in Vegas.  We just wanted a quick meal without dealing with reservations.  It's a decent spot to grab dinner, nothing crazy fancy but the pasta dish I ordered was pretty damn good!  The service was definitely lacking with the restaurant not even busy.  I had to ask two different people for a box to take my food togo."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere just wish the quality and consistency of the food would be better. Over the past 3 years just when you get used to something, someone in the kitchen pulls a fast one. For a year my husband picked up a yogurt parfait from The Henry after a Village workout, and loved it. Then suddenly the fruit content was cut in half. He said something a couple of times and they fixed it, but he got tired of it. So he stopped going for a while. Now for the past 6 mos he's been going again, and  ordering a side of bacon. It's always been 4 whole strips of bacon...this morning he got 4 half strips of bacon...so 2 whole strips...and they were super fatty. He commented they're cutting costs again by buying cheaper bacon and suddenly cutting the amount in half. Either really bad QC or cost cutting. Again."}
{"text":"With ambiance of an updated supper club you will find more than steak and baked potato. Quinoa and kale infused numerous dishes! Owners have several valley restaurants favored by locals and visitors alike. Seniors will find generous portions - to split or take home. Tables and booths are spaced apart for conversation. One meal was delayed a bit and the server offered a complementary dessert for the inconvenience. Stuff happens but when properly managed five \"stars\" appear anyway."}
{"text":"Another home run for Sam Fox!  Great food and great atmosphere.

We had a rare family lunch today and decided to go somewhere new.  Kids menu was great for my youngest who is usually too picky to eat for cheap.

Appetizers get a 10. Popovers were really good as we're the artichoke hearts.  Smoked salmon with potato pancakes is an appetizer but my wife had for lunch and loved it.  I had the quinoa tacos - something I've never seen on the menu and they were excellent.

We were too full for dessert, but will be back again and will definitely try it next time.

Brussels sprout Caesar salad was unique and something I will eat again.

Almost forgot, our server Monica was really awesome! (As was the rest of the staff!)"}
{"text":"What a great way to start your day a Bloody Mary in a mason jar with a slab of bacon and a pipette of siracchia  to spice it even more
Then their version of Benedict starts with a cake of hash browns in place of the muffin and topped with wine braised short ribs for the meat. 
Clean, relatively quiet and great food 
A great find just as you walk into the Cosmo from the strip"}
{"text":"Our waiter, Alex, was fantastic! 
The orange juice is fantastic -- freshly squeezed and cold!
The hashbrowns on the breakfast menu are tasty! (We had the Henry breakfast.)
The bill was less impressive.
I mean, you're in Vegas, so costs are going to be higher and we enjoyed the experience, which is really what you want. In the morning (around 7am), the casino is significantly quieter but there were plenty of business folk preparing for their day at that time, like we were."}
{"text":"The music from the casino bar was very load and it was difficult to have a conversation. The food and service as good."}
{"text":"The Henry is fantastic!  Excellent service - quality food.  The pancake,breakfast burrito and chillquillas (best I have had) was so good.  Hot tea was also really nice!! Best breakfast! ... pancake is extra delicious - order one as an add on!!"}
{"text":"Love the quinoa breakfast burrito! The best breakfast burrito I have ever had and its vegetarian! Doesn't need any meat in my opinion. The salted caramel sweet roll is also pretty fantastic. It is absolutely crave-able. Fun atmosphere, great (and giant) iced tea!"}
{"text":"Love the food. Always amazing. Service wonderful. And spotless clean!   Highly recommend the breakfast egg sandwich it is over-the-top amazing and A  treat to the senses of a hungry soul!
Overall a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and very creative.  Service. Was also excellent.  We had an event in a room with 25 people and the staff was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"The ambience is gorgeous. It combines an old world feel that is yet very modern. The menu has the perfect selection of delicious offerings. The pop overs are a must. We shared s Brussels sprout Caesar salad, it was creamy, crisp, and Amazing! The roast chicken needed a little salt but the cauliflower polenta was perfect along with the Mac n cheese. The beef short rib was tender on the inside and the perfect bark on the outside. The taters were deliciously seasoned with garlic and butter. The sprinkled gorganzola added the perfect amount of flavor to this already delicious dish. Looking forward to going back to try more."}
{"text":"This place was incredible.  It's a country home setting as if your at Martha's Vineyard. The menu gives you so many amazing breakfast and lunch choices. 

It's a comfy, warm cozy atmosphere were the waiters blend into the scenery. 

My husband had the Caramel Apple pancakes and I made the mistake of trying them...... I remember white lights and birds singing...... This must be heaven. These pancakes are so damn good!!!!!

This isn't going to be the last visit.....ill be back real soon....like tomorrow!!!!"}
{"text":"Pricey but good. My egg white omelette was $18 and a side of avocado was $4. The wait was only 30 minutes and service was efficient. There was nothing that stood out about The Henry to make a \"wow\" factor in my opinion but then again, I have nothing negative to say other than the price."}
{"text":"What a fantastic experience once again! Quick service. Waiter Jared was very efficient and helpful. He checked on us a couple of times and accommodated our requests immediately. We had eaten here a few times before on our last trip to Vegas and had an amazing experience then as well. Breakfast tastes great and they have good sized proportions. Highly reccommend you experience it for yourself"}
{"text":"Terrific Fix Fox restaurant. 
We went based on a recommendation of our daughter and it did not disappoint 
Excellent specialty margaritas and guacamole to start 
I had the Chilean sea bass which was over risotto and Brussels sprouts.  One of the best pieces to fish I have had 
My wife had the roasted chicken which was also very tasty 
Great wine by the glass offerings. Bottles can get pretty pricey 
The hostess was friendly and sat us right away as we had an Open Table reservation   Our waitress was very helpful with just the rift level of attention 
You won't be disappointed with Henry 's"}
{"text":"Although I like the food they have, most the time I come here, the service has been terrible. Terrible-as in the worst I've ever had. Most the time I sit in the open seating section, so I understand if it takes a server a tad longer to get to us, but there have been a handful of times where we were totally ignored (like 30 minutes of sitting there for nothing) before we walked out, and another few times where they did get to us and give us poor service. I'm not sure if it's because they are discriminating against a family dining with young kids, but it's unacceptable. I would have given them one star, but they earn the two because I know I'll be ordering lunch food to-go once in a while."}
{"text":"I really liked this place!  I can see what it is so busy/popular.  It's a nice open restaurant with the vibe of a speak easy lounge or your eccentric uncle's house.  We had very attentive service and the food was fancy yet had a comfort food element to it.  The cocktails...wow!  Talk about attention to detail!  I had the Pineapple Pisco Sour...not only did it taste amazing but the presentation was so beautiful.  They embossed their emblem in cinnamon on the foam of the drink...uh, Starbucks needs to step up their game."}
{"text":"Located right off the casino floor in the Cosmopolitan, The Henry is a classy, fancy looking restaurant that serves up classic American diner food. It was about 8pm, and the restaurant was pretty empty so we were seated really quickly.

We started off with some buffalo wings, which were pretty spicy! They were cooked really well, and we were also given wet wipes to clean up the unavoidable mess that comes with chicken wings. I ordered the Buffalo Chicken Wrap, but had asked for the blue cheese dressing to come on the side. Unfortunately, when it arrived, I was disappointed to find out that it had not come on the side. The chicken was kind of soggy from all the dressing and water from the tomatoes, that it wasn't really that enjoyable. It was really flavorful, however, and tasted just like the chicken wings! 

I opted to order the sandwich with a side of tater tots, which they fry in truffle oil. I had never had truffle oil before, so I was put off by the smell, and had to remove the tater tots from in front of me because it was so nauseating. This is nothing against them, just something that I wasn't expecting.

Overall, I would not pay the price we did for this meal, but it is pretty standard in the Las Vegas area. Other than forgetting my request, our server was really friendly and quick. They also serve breakfast all day, so it's kind of like a fancier and more expensive Denny's, and the quality is not much better than I what would expect from Denny's either."}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night and it was amazing! A few things to note though:

For a nice restaurant, this place is loud! Definitely not a place for romantic chit chat or a cozy dinner. The noise from the nearby casino will drown most conversation out. 

The french onion soup is to die for, as is the cinnamon roll french toast; but pass on the \"brookie\" though, way too rich/sweet. 

This place is pricey for what you get. If you're looking for a super fancy meal, its not what you're looking for. If you're looking for an awesome value, also not the right place for you. If your looking for a really good, 24/7 restaurant with average strip prices, this is the right place."}
{"text":"I love the coffee. It's fantastic. The Cleo is my favorite. 

Breakfast options are nice. The potatoes are delicious and they sure do make some great extra crispy bacon. 

Bigger fan of their breakfast over their dinner. Be sure to make reservations to avoid the wait!"}
{"text":"What an experience we had here!  Good yes...slow yes...but an experience!  A group of us came for lunch and sat outside.  We had to move the table, chairs, and umbrella round in order to keep all us out of the sun and we did have some help from one of the men working.  

Our waiter, Cody (we lovinly refer to as the Codster) kept us chuckling throughout our experience.  He began by asking if we had been before, which we all said no.  Mind you he started by saying his name and then asking us.  Once he realized we hadn't been before, you could tell he kicked into the script and again introduced himself and ran down the script telling us about the homemade food, options, etc.  

Although we loved the guy...he got side-tracked so many times during our 2.5 hour lunch.  Yup...we had not intended to be that long but we had to wait for this, wait for that, remind about bringing this or that.  And at the end when we had the checks but needed change for tips, he got lost with that as well.  Overall, our experience was great!

The food is excellent, expensive, but you are getting what you paid for.  High quality, fresh ingredients, high chef quality stuff for sure.  We started with the white truffle fries, which we shared.  So darn good.  

Dishes ordered were the kale and quinoa salads, patty melt, and brussel sprout salad with steak.  I also ordered a side of the orzo, which was so tasty and creamy.  Everything we had we loved and although pricey, we will come back for special occasions."}
{"text":"A new place for me and my friend , the server was super nice and knowledgeable , she described every dish to perfection , my fiend had the tacos and I had the steak with the spicy fried rice !! SUPER GOOD , not expensive at all, a manager came and check on us I believe his name was Mike and he made our night ! Thank you so much for everything , we will be back !!"}
{"text":"Love stopping by here after a few drinks at Marquee Club because the food and price are good. My favorite are the braised short ribs and also the prime rib. They're so juicy and tender, and it's not too bland nor too salty. Just perfect. I've stopped by here about four times, each time consistent with good service and good food. Can't complain one bit."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a party of 7 and ordered a burger medium well. It was the last plate served and the burger came out rare. Absolute debacle. This place isn't worth the price."}
{"text":"Beautiful atmosphere, wonderful bar and Jenna our server is so sweet and attentive.
Short Rib Potstickers are spot on.
Mac and cheese for our granddaughter was superb and loved by her.
Bolognese was really tasty and plenty to eat.
My daughter had the pokie bowl and she loved it.
We will return."}
{"text":"The Henry was the placed picked for September's Breakfast Club UYE, and I have to say, it's such a cute place, why haven't I been here before? After some seating issues we got to look over the menu and figure out what we wanted.

I knew before I got there that I was interested in the Carrot Cake Pancakes, I love love love carrot cake and I love pancakes, so why not have the best of 2 worlds in one. Right?  The pancakes had salted pecans, golden raisins and cream cheese frosting, but it was missing the carrot for me! I love a real carroty carrot cake so I was somewhat disappointed. My friend ordered the chicken fried chicken and we exchanged bites and man that was amazing chicken fried chicken, can't wait to go back for that! 

Breakfast was good; company was great, looking forward to the next BCUYE!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place higher rating but it fell short.  3-1/2 stars overall
4 Stars for environment, service, and design
3 Stars for the food

Came here for brunch for a Sunday, had to find a hostess.  The wait was 15 to 20 for 2 people.  OK, no problem it smells delicious and the pastries in the front stand looked YUM!  Once we are sat, our server was SUPER awesome.  Never had to ask for a refill and took care of us.  I ordered the chicken fried chicken.  It looked so good, but it was very salty.  But I had a muffin and that was VERY good."}
{"text":"Went here for a light dinner and enjoyed it. The service was good, the food was delicious, and the prices were reasonable for an on-the-strip restaurant. We shared a Wild Mushroom Risotto and the Grilled Pork Skirt Steak and I would recommend both."}
{"text":"Outstanding! I had the braised short rib eggs Benedict and I was in heaven! One of the most delicious breakfasts I've ever eaten. And the horseradish infused bloody Mary was amazing as well! Will make it a point to visit each time in here."}
{"text":"This place came recommended from our hotel concierge. We went for breakfast, and we were not disappointed! Very cool atmosphere. Eclectic is a good word. They have a large bar and a cool little cocktail menu. Jared and I got coffees and fresh squeezed OJ. Both were yummy, the coffee was top notch. I had huevos and Jared had the lox bagel... Came sandwich style, and both had a side of potatoes! It was a wonderful dining experience, check it out if you are in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Returned this morning for the Micheladas we had last time we were visiting Las Vegas and they were just as amazing as the first time!  Candice was very hospitable and our food came out soon after we ordered.  I got the Henry Breakfast with a side of warm banana bread that was to die for.  All in all it was the perfect meal after a long night out! Left happy and full."}
{"text":"The Henry #15 officially opens tomorrow, 12/17/13.  It's the 15th Fox concept in fifteen years. I had a chance to eat there this past Friday on friends and family night and I thought a review was in order. First the atmosphere, if you're familiar with the other Fox concepts you know that this is very important to them. The Henry's no exception with a slightly higher upscale feel than most other Fox concepts yet it's still comfortable and far from stuffy. It's obvious right up front that this is their pride and joy with plenty of attention to detail. The corporate offices are located right upstairs but you'd never know it. 

For drinks they have an nice cocktail selection for both serious and more casual drinkers, the red stiletto and the white cranberry cocktail both received rave reviews from the ladies at my table. They also have house wines on tap...that's right...on tap. #15 also had a respectable craft beer selection, I had a Lagunitas lil sumpin sumpin and a double IPA out of Colorado, yum. 

Onto the food. For apps we had the Swedish meatballs and the grilled artichokes. Neither stood a chance for our party of four but the artichokes were exceptional. If you're an artichoke fan definitely don't miss out on these.  For entrées we did two fish and two beef dishes. I had the Mediterranean Bronzino, it was served with wilted kale and it was phenomenal. The other fish dish ordered was a Pacific cod served in a savory broth, it's definitely a preparation you don't see often. Even the broth was gone at the end. The short ribs were classic, boneless and fall apart good. The final dish was the steak sandwich. My sister, a self professed steak sandwitch connisouir, compared it to the steak sandwich that was on the \"off the menu selection\"  for many years at Bandera, her favorite. 

Dessert was the Warm Croissant Bread Pudding.....yeah!....and Salted Caramel Peanut butter Bars....oh yeah! I really enjoyed the bread pudding, the croissants give it new life. They also have a quality selection of coffee and expresso drinks. There's actually a coffee and pastry bar in the restaurant, almost bistro esque, if you just want a cup and a croissant to go in the AM or at lunch. 

Honestly, the Henry is a hit in my book. Comfortable atmosphere, good food, good service. I'll be back for lunch and dinner and would recommend highly to friends. Next time I'm going for the Crispy half chicken.

-Ciao 

P.S. They have a roasted garlic ranch that you would do terrible things to get your lips on. Seriously, order some on the side"}
{"text":"I actually liked this place even though my first impression was, \"wow, 'bridge and tunnel' girls in AZ, how lucky am I that they followed me across the country!?\"... all the while  trying to walk through a gaggle of dressed-up girls taking selfies near the sign outside. Annoying but totally NOT the Henry's fault. 

This place reminds me of the perfectly manicured gastropubs back in Boston. All with great cocktails and american fare. 

Coming from NYC, I enjoyed the flashback and my food was good. The cocktails were above average and totally resonable in price. The Gimlet was perfection. 

My BF loved his french dip sandwich and my \"Greek ingredient\" salad was good...but it was small. The hallumi cheese was not plentiful at all, which was a bummer, because that's why I got it. All in all, though, it was fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Wanted a decent breakfast at 2pm on a Tuesday. 

We slept in and walked the strip looking for a nice place to sit and fill our bellies/warm our souls with some good grub. Yes, again the the prices are up there but it was all we could find. 

Our waiter Larry was very attentive, sweet, and accommodating. They serve breakfast all day which is greatttttt!

We ordered:

California omelette
Henry's breakfast plate
Breakfast burrito 

The omelette was large and fluffy with avocado and cheese. Plus hash browns and toast 

Henry's breakfast come with your choice of eggs, meat, hash browns, and toast! 

The breakfast burrito is stuffed with eggs, cheese, peppers, pico de gallo, and hash browns. A side of salsa and sour cream. It also comes with chorizo inside but I switched it for bacon. The burrito was BOMB!!! Hash browns were so good.

Also, with the toast comes these cute little jars of jelly from Austria. Raspberry, grape, strawberry, and rose apricot! YUM."}
{"text":"Excellent. Friend took me here for my birthday. Food was excellent, we had the short rib and the thai peanut cod, delicious! Our server was Ross and he was great, perfect timing, knowledgeable and made very good recommendations. I would highly recommend dinner at The Henry."}
{"text":"I came here for my birthday on a Monday night. We sat at the bar where we proceeded to have the worst bartender of our life attempt to serve us in a non representable manner for their well-known concept chain of hospitality. I've eaten here before and never had a problem, but this time I will never come back due to the bad taste in our mouths after our short dining experience. 

The bartender spent 5-10 minutes in between us tasting a sample of wine to find the right one to come back and ask us if we wanted to order the specific Blend of Pinot. I was frustrated. We were the only people at the bar besides a server eating dinner next to me at the bar. 

I don't even want to get into the whole scenario but long story short, when we left she got a 20% tip instead of my boyfriends normal 30% and she promised to \"make it up to us next time\".... Honey, there won't be a next time. 

That is not how he runs his restaurants. You fix it while the guest is still there so they leave happy!!"}
{"text":"My family really loved it here. Sadly, the last two times we have visited, the service was not too great! Some waiters & manager  are a bit rude. The first time we were treated poorly was on my birthday. We sat on the patio with my family and waiter seem very upset she had to wait on us. Until she saw I reacted to her poor treatment she changed her character. Next time we visited was also on my husbands birthday, we had made a reservation and still had to wait over 30min. To be seated. Then once we ordered we waited over an hour to get our food, which were mostly sandwiches. We spoke to the manager and we understood why waiters had poor characters there. He was not too polite. We have not been back since then."}
{"text":"This is my favorite coffee location, second to LGO.  Truly awesome atmosphere and scene.  A lot of self employed and salespeople bring clients here.  Lots of non-pretentious business people getting business done.  I've not tried the food but been told it's spectacular.  Whereas LGO is more informal, The Henry has a classier feel.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The place is just the best...Fox always does it right.  The food is terrific, the ambiance great, comfy seating to wait it, a great bar and now an even expanded coffee bar..love it all.  You can't go wrong here!!"}
{"text":"On my last day of my boys bachelor party we came here before our fight, I seen all of the reviews on help and a picture of the short rib Benedict, and knew we just had to go there.

Anytime I see Benedict I must try it, it makes me weak in the knees.


as we came in there was no line, but they had to clean some tables took about 5 mins to get a seat which wasnt very bad at all, it is located in the front of the cosmo downstairs, which was hard to find at first since most of their restaurants are on the 2nd and 3rd floors. The cosmo I would say is hands down the best casino in vegas, so just hanging out waiting to sit was pleasant.


I had ordered the short rib Benedict of course. It was tender and flavor full, I didnt realize it was on top of a potato cake, Normally in a Benedict the sauce makes things soft and yummy, and you usually have something harder or crispy on the bottom, I would have liked it better if the potato cake was more solid/ crispy.

The food was the right portion, Didnt make me stuffed and didnt leave me wanting more.

while we were sitting apparently celebrities go here at like as three times during the meal. I saw random people come up asking for their autograph and photo, which was cool that you get to eat/ sit next to them.... only if I knew who the hell they were, im too much of a loser to be in the know..


will come back again,"}
{"text":"Uninspired food and drinks. The atmosphere is great and the menu appears to be well appointed, however our dishes and drinks lacked flavor and creativity. The service also leaves much to be desired. We waited over 15 minutes for our waitress to come over the first time. I was served the incorrect drink and incorrect meal."}
{"text":"we made a reservation tonight but were not seated until an hour after our booking time. that's not a great start to the night but i have to give massive kudos to everyone at the henry for really turning things around. the staff informed us that a few tables were lingering longer than expected. they apologized profusely and covered a round of drinks and an appetizer while we waited. the drinks were delicious, the guacamole was super tasty and the truffle fries were a group favorite. once seated, the server was attentive and friendly. everyone enjoyed their meals and shared bites with one another. without any prompting, the server noticed i hadn't eaten much of my cauliflower \"polenta\" side dish and offered to remove it from the bill. it was edible (kinda \"meh\") but not something i'd normally bring up. it was a kind gesture on top of many others tonight. and i have to say we all left feeling happy, full, and appreciated. sometimes it feels like yelp is riddled with bad service reviews, so it feels great to say some places still know how to get it right."}
{"text":"Nice environment. Food wasn't as great as I thought it would be. I'd definitely come back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Very friendly service which was nice, I just wish they picked up the pace a little bit.  The food was pretty good, nothing seemed to special or extraordinary but all 5 of us walked out of there very happy that we decided to quickly stop in for brunch."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I made reservations here for our 6year anniversary. First off, I loved the scenery! It is different and what's better then a coffee shop inside the restaurant?!? We were seated outside by the fireplace. I was excited to try the cauliflower palenta since it seems to be something many were raving about. I got the roasted chicken with the Mac and cheese side also the cauliflower palenta and my boyfriend got the Korean BBQ skirt steak! Good was so good!!! Loved everything about it. One thing they can fix is their service. Not once did they refill our drinks or ask us how everything tastes."}
{"text":"I came here for Saturday morning brunch with my boyfriend. We had reservations which was a good thing because man was it packed (usually a good sign!). The restaurant itself is huge and the decor is very nice. There's a lot of outdoor seating available. Despite being so crowded our waitress was very friendly and attentive and the food came out super quick. We both got a mimosa - my boyfriend got the classic and I got the pineapple. They were tasty and also strong - really expensive though ($9 each a think). I ordered the Flower Child Scramble and my boyfriend got the Chicken Fried Chicken (I think that's what it was called). The food was a little pricey as well but the servings were big and it tasted fabulous. Overall great experience, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went there with my wife for breakfast. I had the French toast and she got the standard eggs and bacon. French toast was amazing, great portion size, crispy on the outside and nice soft center. Wife enjoyed her breakfast too. Can't wait to go back and try something else."}
{"text":"Located just inside the entrance of The Cosmopolitan, The Henry is a fabulous dinner destination, especially if you're looking for a place that is more friendly on your pocketbook. Don't misunderstand me, though -- even though The Henry's offerings are more modest in price doesn't mean the  food quality is any less spectacular than what you might find elsewhere at some of the more trendy, overrated and overpriced restaurants in the immediate locale.

Everything on the menu appealed to me, but I was immediately drawn to starting with the Caesar Salad with grilled shrimp, and then having the Chicken Salad Wrap with bacon. The salad is huge, large enough to easily be shared by two (which I did). The shrimp were large and meaty, grilled just right; loved their flavor. I was immensely pleased with my chicken salad wrap. Large, generous amounts of chicken in every bite, graced by just the right amount of mayo. The bacon added just the additional element to make it more than memorable. (Tip: Ask for the horseradish dipping sauce to use in conjunction with the wrap. That sauce is phenomenal!) My entree also came with a side of Truffle Tater Tots. They were quite good, but I couldn't finish them. 

Needless to say, I left The Henry very happy. For whatever reason, it didn't seem to be getting much attention of traffic while we were there. Seems that most tourists fall victim to patronizing some of the more trendy, high-priced restaurants (I was one of those victims earlier in the day)."}
{"text":"While passing through the Cosmopolitan casino we took a quick look at the menu and several items sounded appetizing. We played at the casino for a couple of hours and decided to go back to The Henry for dinner. We were seated quickly by a friendly hostess and greeted quickly by our waiter who was also very friendly. Our food came out quite fast; I ordered the meatloaf and my husband ordered the French dip. The food was plated nicely and it was really delicious. The portions were well worth the money, service was great and the food was tasty. It was nice to enjoy a sit down dinner that didn't have a long wait and take forever. On our way out the manager thanked us for coming by; I recommend giving this place a try next time you're at the beautiful Cosmopolitan."}
{"text":"Come in here drunk and get a french dip sandwich and you will leave happy.  You can also people watch and see old geezer dining with their scantily clad much younger \"girlfriends.\"  The only bad thing is that this place is in some Liberace casino.  Eggads!"}
{"text":"Love love love their food and live the environment.   Great place to hang out with friends for a night out or on a date with your special someone on the praise patio or inside. Everything on the menu is awesome. Would recommend this spot to any out of towners to try it out."}
{"text":"Well....tonight was my third time there this week. I was looking for a place other than either Dominic's, steak 44, or Fleming's to enjoy a nice evening with good food and drinks. Boy oh boy, this place is my new favorite. We were helped by Alex and Estefy on separate visits, they were amazing. Always made sure that either our drinks were refilled or if we needed anything else. THE FOOD IS TO DIE FOR, their korean skirt steak is bomb doggity and their braised short ribs are delicious, you won't need your knife! Trust me. I honestly couldn't be happier going home 45 minutes away full and happy. When we're here we feel like we're friends with everyone. Not a bad thing to say about this place. If you've been thinking about going here, wtf are you waiting for!! HURRY!!"}
{"text":"As my daughter said, \"This is our new favorite brunch place.\" Everything was wonderful - the ambience, the service, the food and the coffee. The caramel apple pancakes were delicious! Loved the kids menu too. The potatoes were fantastic. And my daughter loved the healthy choices. She had the quinoa wrap with egg whites. A rare place that lived up to the hype."}
{"text":"Had to wait a few minutes to be seated... food was good but not sure if it's the best hang over food. I much prefer me something soupy and noodle-y and asian after a night of hardcore drinking. The hostess was pretty, a definite plus! The waiters were polite but I think the service is a bit slow. Took a while for our food to come out, I had time to go back up to our hotel room (which was in the Cosmo) and pick up my wallet which I had forgotten and by the time I came back our food was still not out yet. Even the drinks took a while which shouldn't be the case since those don't even take pre time really.

I got the Signature Short Rib Benedict - braised short ribs, hollandaise, crispy potato cakes. It was good but the flavor was a little off for me for some reason, maybe my taste buds hadn't recovered from the night before, who knows?!

When we left though we saw that there were a bunch of open seats and even as we were waiting, there were open spots but they said they were preparing our table already. I guess just like how it took a while to prepare our drinks, it took them a while to prepare our table too."}
{"text":"I finally found a Bread Pudding that I would brag about. The best bread pudding in Phoenix.

Like everything Sam Fox does, it was well designed. Since it is still brand new it was crazy packed so we enjoyed the patio. You couldn't really feel like this had been a parking lot in a drab office building months before."}
{"text":"If yelp had half stars I would be giving the Henry 3.5 stars.. I'm on the border here. But the server was super nice so *bonus half star for him (didn't catch his name)*

The food was a bit late due to the amount of people there.

Ordered the breakfast burrito which was not bad but definitely not as authentic as I usually like them. The chorizo and crispy potatoes were yummy. The pico de gallo tasted a bit more like tomato sauce then pico.. And the omlette inside was just, blah, for lack of a better word.  

My boyfriend got the short rib Benedict which is their most popular item on the breakfast menu. It was definitely VERY good! I enjoyed my only bite i stole from him. 

I would probably come back just for the Benedict!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my kale and quinoa salad! Great portions and super fresh. Always great service at The Henry!"}
{"text":"This place has some great ambiance. We had the chicken soup which was unbelievable, we also had the BLT which is very good as well. What was even better was Joseph who was our waiter. He even let us know that there is no possible way that one person is going to finish the BLT meal. And he was totally right. The BLT was meant to be split. So he saved us leftovers and we are leaving with nice full bellies and got to enjoy the Ambiance of this beautiful place. The ranch that they gave us was freshly made and the BLT tasted it Super Fresh as well. We will definitely be back in the future"}
{"text":"The concept, once again is great.  We frequent the Fox Concepts restaurants religiously due to the impeccable service.  The food is always great.  The impeccable service was somewhat \"marred\" by the \"tall, slender, very pretty \"blonde\" at the coffee bar area.  We walked in not knowing what to expect, and she asked, \"if we we dining or just having a coffee?\".. We hesitated, and talked it over between us for about 10 seconds which seems to \"upset\" her, as when we told her we would like to dine in, she \"ROLLED HER PRETTY EYES\" as though it irritated her that we did not know immediately.  We really didn't since this was our first visit.  She actually walked away and told us to walk over to the Hostess area to the left.....Rude, and unlike anything that Fox Concepts would consider great service.  The Hostess was great, and the food was great.  The waitress was the same, as it seemed that she \"really didn't want to be there\".  She had no suggestions, no input and not even a \"smile\" and had to ask for water and a refill on my ice tea...  Rude help, and surprisingly as we later found out that it is a \"training center\"?...Love the place though and we probably \"might\" go again, but ...without a \"welcome greeting, and better service, we'll pass on it and just stick to North or Olive and Ivy.  The \"blonde\", let me say again was just to rude, and she made me feel \"unwelcome\".......Other than the service personal, everything else was too neat!...."}
{"text":"The Henry is a great spot to go for a late night dining spot.  The big plus is that it's 24 hours so you can come here anytime during the day.

I came knowing about their French Dip sandwich and Truffle Tots because so many folks have ordered it and posted pics of it on yelp.  So when I came there for a late night munch fest, it was a no-brainer that that would be what I would order.

French Dip -- tender prime rib, melted swiss cheese, horseradish sauce & au jus
with truffle tater tots 
http://bit.ly/11JiTeY
This definitely hit the spot, especially at 1am in the morning!  A nice heavy portion of hot beef and cheese and then able to soak it all in to the au jus was just great comfort food all around!  And the Truffle Tots just made it even more epic!

The Henry has definitely made my rotation of places to eat at any time of the day.  Their late night and breakfast menus are pretty solid and I would most definitely come back again."}
{"text":"It was a good breakfast choice. My husband got Henry's Breakfast and I got the California Omelet. Loved every bite of my food, the omelet itself was delicious and the farm bread it came with was to die for. The service was OK but we were irked by the fact that they charged us an extra $5 for a black coffee refill. I mean come on, everything is already overpriced. Other than that we enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"We booked The Henry for our wedding reception and it was a fantastic experience! The drinks and food were amazing. We got to choose our menu items. For the first course we had a choice between the ceasar salad and French onion soup. The main course was a choice of salmon (which was cooked perfectly), ribeye (also done exceptionally well), and a vegetarian pasta (vegetarian guest said it was incredible). And for dessert we got a slice of the best cheesecake I've ever had and a slice of delicious chocolate cake! Our waitress, Sarah was great! Always made sure to check on us and accommodated our requests. Would definitely book another dinner here!"}
{"text":"Our server was a bit unprofessional. My wife and I refer to them as the drive by server. The ones that rush by asking if everything is ok, or serve you food in a rushed manner. Just because you are busy doesn't mean you have to behave that way in front of us. I'm sure other servers maybe okay, which points to a training and management issue.

Our food was good though. We got the breakfast burrito (sub tater tots instead of potatoes), side of avocado for $4 more. She got the Belgian waffle. Coffee was good, plentiful, and they have Splenda.

A bit pricey for what it is, but everything on the strip seems at least 30% more than other places... This place I'd say charges double what you'd expect to pay off the strip or in other cities."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely terrible! I got food poisoning from the meatloaf entree!

Came here for the $40 prix fix dinner for 2 people because we though it was a great deal. For appetizer we got the Caesar Salad which was drenched in salad dressing and I was choking on the sticky dressing. Then we got the roasted chicken and the meatloaf entree. The chicken was very dry and lacking flavor but eatable. The meatloaf tasted like wet paper, I had 5 bites and the dude had a bite and refuse to eat anymore. Guess what from the extra several bites, I was up all night going to the bathroom and got no sleep! 

The service was nice and friendly but I would NOT recommend the food!"}
{"text":"Decided to visit this place as I have wondered and passed this establishment many times. I went here for a late Valentines date dinner and was left wanting more. The ambiance of the restaurant was nice. Surprisingly went here on Friday night and there was no wait or reservation needed only if you wanted to sit on the booths. The food was average, nothing too exciting to rave about considering this place is more geared towards the higher end of the pay scale. I ordered the  braised short rib w/ mashed potatoes and roasted mushrooms, and girlfriend ordered the Korean Style Skirt Steak. The skirt steak was a bit salty possibly overdoing the sauces being put on. Other than that, average dinner with prices exceeding what the food was worth."}
{"text":"My son and his wife took me out for Father's day to this restaurant.  I wasn't sure from the start whether we were going to be pleased.  Our party was 4 people and none of us are drinkers.  I'm watching my weight so I ordered water.  I got a \"look\" from the waiter like he was being paid based on how much alcohol he sold.  I was very surprised to see the prices.  I figured that it must be really good to charge $15.50 for a hamburger.  I ordered a turkey french dip.  I was not impressed with the size or the quality of the turkey.  The sandwich was about 4 inches long and had two pieces of turkey on it with a piece of cheese.  It tasted like a small version of Subway and it cost $14.50.  The last time we saw our waiter was when he took our order and of course to bring the bill.  The environment was very loud.  I don't think I'll be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"Super friendly gatherings always!! Great food scrumptious fresh pastries and deliciously brewed coffee and lattes. Yummmmmmmmm

The best morning starter in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The Henry is a great spot - the restaurant is spacious, charming, and well decorated. The coffee shop is adorable and there are many options. 

My friends and I had brunch here on a Sunday morning- we came around 11 and had to wait approximately 45minutes for a table (get a reservation!), but it was well worth it. 

We came to The Henry for the Bloody Mary's we heard so much about. The cart was a new experience- they had 8 kinds of flavor-infused vodka to choose from and garnishes like bacon, celery, olives, pickles, pickled onions, etc. It cost us about $10 per Bloody Mary and they were bigger than I expected them to be. They were DELICIOUS! One of the best Bloody Mary's I've had (and they're my favorite drink) 

I'd recommend this spot for brunch but I would definitely advise reserving a table ahead of time. If not, though, you can grab a coffee or donut and sit in the lounge and relax!"}
{"text":"Located inside The Cosmopolitan hotel and near the casino, it's situated perfectly.  Members of our group came here at various times of day and always had the following:

-  great service and great waitstaff
- awesome food selection
-  accommodation of allergies (mine to lactose)
-  ambiance and overall decor

It's got tons of seating for small and large groups and the place you need to come to at anytime of the day!"}
{"text":"Don't understand what the hype is about.  Poached sea bass was very disappointing. Scallops  were nothing special, a bit salty.  The salmon appetizer was yummy, just didn't care for the mustard after taste.  the peanut butter banana cake was OK.  Their Coffee was pretty darn good, I had The Butcher without the cream.  Over priced menu for an average experience. =/
This place does attract some beautiful people though, so a great place to go out for a drink and mingle for sure."}
{"text":"The ambiance of the restaurant does not disappoint.  It's refreshing to see this type of restaurant aesthetic coming in.  Fox got the concept right...but lacks a bit in overall execution.  My wife and I came in for dinner...albeit without reservations...but seriously this is Phoenix.  Spago takes me without a reservation...and seats me in a table I can actually eat at.  I repeatedly told the hostess the table would be too small for us.  When I try a restaurant...I sample...a lot.  The two person tables are for people drinking wine and children.  I am rating this one star lower for just the terribly ridiculous carnival act that had to be performed in order for us to actually eat...uncomfortably.  We tried the short rib potstickers, grilled & chilled charred shrimp, popovers & smoked salmon appetizers.  The popovers are what most places deliver for free...I'm not saying they are not worth $7...I just find it embarrassing that you would charge for them.  The potstickers were okay.  The chilled charred shrimp were a hit and miss.  Beautiful and prabably would have been excellent if served hot.  Serving them cold for \"speciality\" will be lost on anyone that actually FINE dines.  The smoked salmon was good...nothing special...but good.  We ordered the $50 New York steak and the chicken.  I detest overpaying for lower priced cuts of meat...absent from the menu was filet or ribeye etc.  The steak was beautifully prepared, expertly seasoned, and quite delicious.  But fox has literally created this entire menu for shameless profit...and they are either counting on people being completely ignorant,   one hit tourist visitors, or those desperate to cling to anything remotely decent in the way of Phoenix eateries.  We took a few desserts to go...which were delicious.  Including a delectable bread pudding.  I really wanted to like this place...but this is not a fine dining establishment.  It's a cookie cutter fox development wrapped to look like something out of a larger city.  The staff are basically all children, and asking anything beyond the scripted responses they were so obviously drilled on resulted in the \"deer in headlights\" stare.  For instance the server will immediately volunteer \"her favorite\" menu items...if I wanted to know...I would ask...but thank you for the upsell.  I really don't need coaxing to spend money especially from someone that needs to work all day to afford the steak.  I can't really see wanting to go back...there is no depth to this place.  No specials or off the menu items...and a quite boring menu.  I'm not saying this place couldn't be something...it's just not."}
{"text":"3.83 stars.

Meandered here after the Sade/John Legend concert at the MGM Grand.  Tried The Chandelier and Bond, however both were incredibly packed with no hope of having any type of conversation with my friend and cousins.

The less crowded and slightly quieter option was The Henry.  It was 3 am and the environs were pumping, but this place looked pretty chill in comparison.  We ended up having a few drinks and eventually ordered food.  I couldn't resist and ended up splitting their cheeseburger and tater tots with my cousin:  Not bad at all (4 stars).  

I just felt bad for the wait staff that had to deal with serving inebriated Strip victims, I being one of them.  Bless their hearts.  At this point our party of four started falling apart, getting all Asian-red-in-the-face as the conversation drifted into yawns and somber realization that we had to drunk-walk to the Tropicana to retrieve my cousin's rental car.  

Convenience:  4 stars
Service:  3.5 stars
Burger & tater tots:  4 stars
Drunk walking through Labor Day Weekend crowds:  Priceless.

4+3.5+4= 11.5/3= 3.83 stars.

{"text":"Excellent breakfast. We had the cinnamon roll French toast which was amazing and the smoked salmon plate was delicious and came with lox, bagel, cream cheese, egg, capers, tomato and purple onion. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Très belle salle à manger dans le Cosmopolitan hotel. Pour le déjeuner c'est parfait et servi avec classe. J'ai mangé un excellent bagel au saumon fumé avec beaucoup de Cafe puisque je me suis couché tard la veille. :-))
Apres tout , c'est Vegas."}
{"text":"Sam Fox does it again! I'm so behind on checking the rest of the newish FRC spots in the Phoenix area, but alas, I made it to The Henry. It's Sam Fox in every way- they've nailed ambiance, service and a solid menu. It appears this restaurant shared the building with their HQ, it's pretty cool! I loved the vintage yet contemporary setting. My group of three managed to get seated right away on a Tuesday night, but it was also like 8:45pm. The place was still bustling with diners. I stuck to wine even though the cocktail and whiskey list did impress. We shared the avocado toast to start. It was fresh and light and could easily be made at home. I'd probably order something a little more indulgent next time. I must've been in a healthy mood, because I ordered the Mediterranean fatoosh salad with chicken. This item was not particularly impressive for an entree salad, there was barely a hint of Sumac in the dressing. Those looking for an extremely lightly flavored or garnished salad might enjoy this. It was A-Ok. Next time, I'll go for a main entree for dinner. My dining buddies devoured their dinner- the roasted chicken and a pasta dish. Luckily, they were happy to let me in on their entrees! I'd go for the roasted chicken for sure, served with mashed potatoes and a side salad, this dish is comforting and filling. Overall, The Henry is fun and fresh and the service was stellar."}
{"text":"The atmosphere here was gorgeous! Mid Century Mod meets Victorian. I didn't feel like I was in AZ dining here. Very trendy spot. The servers uniforms are classy and quirky with pink button ups and wing tip shoes. Service was great and the food delicious. We had the Cleo from the coffee bar, Carmel apple French toast, and chicken fried chicken all were scrumptious! Will definitely return as the entire experience was simply divine!"}
{"text":"Get the French Toast! It's made with a croissant and covered with strawberries. It's so gooood. During lunch, you can also order truffle tater tots. The tots weren't amazing, just ok. I thought the service here was pretty good. It's a nice place to have downstairs in the lobby at the Cosmopolitan that is open 24/7."}
{"text":"The omelette were very unimpressive and overpriced. They donuts are good and our server was nice."}
{"text":"$16 for Greasy ruben. Only highlight was the chode shaped Apple smoked sausage."}
{"text":"Great food and terrific servers.  We've been there a couple of times and it has been a great experience.  The place was packed both times, but they have wonderful comfy chairs and couches while you wait.  On our second visit we had to wait a bit for our reservation, and they couldn't have been nicer about it.  They gave us free drinks and appetizers to make up for the wait, which was appreciated!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Just the set up of the inside and outside dining area is so urban-but-classy-like it already won me over when I first walked in. It's really big on the inside with couches, dining tables, a bar and whatnot and the outside eating area is spacious as well. 

I didn't get to try anything on their menu besides the dessert and some drinks so I can't really give a review on how the food is, but what I did order it was very enjoyable. I had the chocolate peanut butter molten cake with ice cream and my friend got the bread pudding I believe, both tasted really good and not overpowering on the flavors, worth the price and I would order it again. The drinks I ordered on the other hand.......not even gonna go there because I'm not that big a fan of alcohol so I can't give an accurate review of it. But I'm sure that majority people who orders a drink on the menu like it. 

The waiter was very nice, helpful and prompt, even when requested another drink because I didn't like first one I ordered. I would definitely come back to try out their food menu because I liked the set up so much!"}
{"text":"Such an awesome spot for breakfast in Vegas! Been here twice so far and never been disappointed. The French toast is a must try, BUT they're huge so totally shareable! Also their signature short ribs Benedict was to die for! 

Delicious food and wonderful service! Don't miss this spot during your Vegas trip! Trust me!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute, open, trendy and a very loud atmosphere.  I would recommend this place for happy hour with friends.  The food was really good.  I tried the roasted chicken and it was amazing.  There was so much food on my plate that I had to to get a doggy bag, but it definitely was eaten later on that night.  I heard there is an awesome patio, but due to the beautiful weather, there was no seating available."}
{"text":"Have so many positive things to say about this place- it's got great food, very cool decor, curler people, friendly bartenders and good relaxed vibe overall. But here's why I want to give them 10 stars: I left my wallet on the bar. I called them in a panic from the airport and they had already found it. I had 20 minutes to get checked in and was about to miss my flight! And the manager jumped in his car and had my wallet to me 15 minutes later!!! They saved me and really cared that I was about to be stuck! I am grateful to them forever. Cannot wait to go back next time I am in town. Run, don't walk to this restaurant and leave them big tips and great reviews! They deserve it!!! And try the quinoa tacos!"}
{"text":"First time visitor, had heard a lot of positive things.

First, the ambience is very hip; from the separate sitting areas (bar, coffee area, dining area, patio) that each have some different decor to the funky framed art on the wall, it feels current.

The menu is diverse but not overwhelming, and there are some creative dishes and drinks, including some fun mocktails for the lunch crowd.  I ordered the recommended chai lime ginger beer (4 stars) and it was good: slightly bitter and sweet and the chai flavored undercurrent was a nice mixture with the ginger.  Yum.

Next we ordered the \"popovers\" (3.5 stars)  I'm still not sure if that is a made-up dish or something that is real, but I've never seen a \"popover\" in my life before now.  It is basically a bread roll with the consistency of a soufflé and is airy and mostly hollow on the inside, almost like a billowy pizza crust, with two really fancy butters: ham butter and chive butter.  It was all good; I surprised myself by preferring the chive to the ham butter.  I wish the popovers were a little more substantial on the inside; it was hard to spread butter within them because they were so hollow.

Entrees:

Fried Chicken Sandwich (3.5 stars): This was a good but not epic sandwich.  The chicken was moist, the toppings were fresh, but the sandwich didn't have enough sauce and flavor to blow me away.  If you like milder fare, this is probably a good choice.

Quinoa Tacos (3 stars): These were also good considering they were vegetarian, but will not rival a full-meat competitor: creatively served, tasty and light, but lacking the punch, smoke, and sizzle of a meaty alternative.

Cauliflower Polenta (4 stars): This is not the polenta I am used to, all rolled together in a big disc with sauce atop it, but is instead flavorful roasted cauliflower blended with polenta, almost like a couscous.  I loved it and are every bite.  Yum!

Bread Pudding (3.5 stars):  Moist, with caramel ice cream, and warm, this is a well prepared bread pudding.  It had a lot of raisins on it which had plumped up in the oven and in the moist trappings, but they were overwhelming to me.  Better if some banana caramel sauce were there instead of the raisins, then it could be a five star dish."}
{"text":"Great little joint at the Cosmopolitan. They have basic American food. Good place for a quick sit down casual meal. I had an upset stomach and came here for the chicken soup. It was yummy. The service was friendly and the French onion soup my fiancé got was delicious."}
{"text":"Sorry to say we just left there, sat at the bar during a happy hour that wasn't that busy and had to flag down the bar tender each time we wanted to order. Thin gal with a ponytail and glasses. The food was really good but service is half the experience for us."}
{"text":"I went to have a breakfast. I was shocked when I saw the plates with my husband. The food is just okay. We ordered eggs Benedict. There were only two Benedict and nothing else on the plate. I guess the coffee that my husband ordered was the only good thing we had. Oh and fresh squeezed oj. Never go back."}
{"text":"The food and service were  both really good. Yes it is a bit pricy but in Vegas you get what you pay for. The coffee was strong. I enjoyed the mini pot our server left at the table that was able to top my coffee off twice. The fresh donuts were served hot. I'm not a donut guy but these were decent. My veggie scramble was much more food than I anticipated . The little fingerling potatoes were so good. They were underneath the eggs, asparagus, and other veggies.  I would recommend this place for breakfast at least once a stay in  Vegas if you are on the strip."}
{"text":"We ate breakfast here 3 times and both the food and service were great.  My wife loved the salmon toast and I loved the granola and fruit.   Special orders were accommodated without attitude as I'm a vegan and that's not always easy.  
Only hold back on star 5 was the pricing but that's to be expected in a casino restaurant."}
{"text":"Nice place to grab some breakfast. Food here is delicious and fresh. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Wouldn't go back. The space is nice. The food is beyond underwhelming. Sounds great on paper and then it's served to you and you wonder where the hell is the flavor that all these great ingredients would have indicated. The service is slow and a little snooty. The servings are also quite small for the price. Nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre,  expected more a little disappointed with portion size. The $40 special isn't worth the money. Don't think I would eat here again. Keep in mind any restaurant on the strip is over priced; at least nearly doubled the regular price off the strip."}
{"text":"From day one when it opened, I have been a huge fan of this experience. Cozy breakfasts, delicious lunches and mouth watering dinners never disappoint. Their bar offerings are varied, which leaves your options wide open. My favorite non-alcoholic drink is the Chai Lime Ginger beer. Their open kitchen allows the flavors of the dishes permeate through the restaurant and it's almost like being at home. The decor is warm and inviting and allows you to just make yourself at home. I know I do."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I had on the strip. Decor is nice and staff are friendly. Def reccommend. The french toast and western omlette were great."}
{"text":"This place is bomb. They didn't have the bread I wanted, so I took their advice on a substitution & it was amazing. 
The decor is nice enough to want to sit & drink for hours, but the food is good enough to want to eat,  too. Nothing on the menu could be classified as 'ordinary'.
Go live a little. At least hit the tiny cafe. Get cracking on visiting places like this one. Life is short."}
{"text":"In a town where soda is 5 bucks, Henry is a piece of middle class normal. Would recommend as a refuge from the crazy."}
{"text":"Good breakfast. Nice place. Great service.
It is not an inexpensive place. For two people $50. 
We were planning to go to the Eggslut, but their is not a sit down area. 
I will recommend if you want to relax and enjoy the conversation. I had the egg Benedict. It was ok. The plate really look empty."}
{"text":"Wanted a sit down breakfast place, and this was a good option. I had the eggwhite omlette with coffee. They offered avocado with the omelette and I should have taken it. It was pretty low on flavor. The coffee wasn't very good; I drink it black. 

Not factored into the rating: low on veg options."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday brunch. I can tell you the ambience is nice. The coffee cake is TO DIE FOR and the service was decent. Highly recommend a reservation though. We went about 9am and there were plenty of empty tables but were told to find open seating or wait approximately an hour. Strange - when it appeared to have at least a 1/2 dozen or more open tables. 

You can also go to the bakery counter and pick up something quick to go. Again, I HIGHLY recommend the coffee cake!"}
{"text":"The tater tots here were amazing. Go to the slots, win at least $7 and bring it here to exchange for a tiny tin of truffle tots. You won't be mad."}
{"text":"Came to eat at the Henry late at night. We were seated very quickly. It's located inside of the Cosmopolitan casino downstairs. Our waitress was great but I can't say that for the  food. We ordered calamari, a cheeseburger and that came with fries, and French onion soup. Calamari was very soggy not fresh at all not much flavor but the sauce that came with it was good. The burger not good either, I've made better burgers at home than that. It was kind of like a Burger King burger or McDonald's in my opnion. The French onion soup however was good. I would give it 4 stars for the service, but the food was very bland and disappointing. They did not have a big menu selection for food either. It is covinient however because of the location."}
{"text":"First time and really like the energy of this restaurant.  The concept of coffee house in the morning and then opening the dinning room for lunch and dinner is a unique concept.  I had the Chicken Chinese Salad and was very satisfied with appearance and flavor of this salad.  I will defiantly be back."}
{"text":"There are really two distinct businesses here. A coffee shop and a higher end restraint. I would give them four and a half stars total, 5 stars for the restraint and four for the coffee house. The coffee house is a great place to hang out and get some coffee and a bite. Somewhat limited breakfast and a little expensive. The restaurant is top notch, great service, great food, and not at a bad price for what you get. It's a good looking crowd if that's important to you one way or the other so brush your teeth and comb your hair before you go there."}
{"text":"Bacon burnt and not cooked all the way. How do you do that? Hash browns or whatever they were mini potatoes not good overpriced crap. Eggs ok"}
{"text":"The food is ok, but somehow I keep finding myself here because of the atmosphere and vibe. The coffee isn't that great the food isn't that creative. Great place to have meeting, get work done, have lunch and dinner."}
{"text":"Service lacking. Waited almost an hour at lunch to sit  - ordered as soon as we sat down - an app and all our meals. Our drinks came 10 min later. The guacamole came 20 min after that - and by guac I mean an ice cream scoop of it and about 10 chips. Then the food came 30 min after that. Nobody checked on us. We didn't like the turkey club but there was nobody to tell. Then we sat w plates for about 15 min waiting for our check. So arrival 11:35 and didn't finish until nearly 2. On a work day. It's no wonder it takes an hour to sit when every table is there forever on a workday lunch. Our food a disappoint and won't know if anything else is good cause I won't be returning. 4 people was $80 no alcohol pretty pricey for the \"Henry\" experience."}
{"text":"Went here on a Friday night when my friend couldn't get same day reservations at the original place for a group of nine.  Had the guacamole dip as appetizer, which was good but didn't care for the chunks of oranges in it.  Ordered the quinoa tacos which were delicious and enough for me even though you get only 3 mini soft tacos. The portion here is very off though. Someone ordered the burger which is HUGE and another ordered the Ginger Cod which left him still hungry because he finished it in 4 bites. For dessert, everyone raved and shared the custard over the chocolate cake. Oh, love the patio seating but be prepared to get blinded by headlights if you are facing the parking lot at night, it happened to us every 2 minutes. Only 4 stares because some left starving for the price that was paid and the parking; not only limited but the space is narrow!  I was expecting my car to be key scratched from the driver on my right since he probably had an issue getting in :) Looking forward to trying some lunch items."}
{"text":"ate here after a recommendation from a friend.   It was about 10:15 am but i wanted a chicken salad sandwich.  They were very nice and made it for me on big sour dough bread with the truffled tots!  All fantastic!!   If this was based on my food alone and price wasnt involved it would get 5 stars for sandwich, tots and service.  Bf got eggs benedict.   2 little pieces of muffin on the plate.  No tots which sucked for him.   no potato at all.   with tip our bill was 60.00 with one bloody mary and an iced tea.  60.00 in the whole and had to run up to Secret Pizza for 2 slices afterwards."}
{"text":"Went for a late night burger with tater tots. Burger was good - truffle tater tots were great. Service was below average late night. Omlettes were above average. Only place opened really late night."}
{"text":"Yay! They have earl gray tea! 
Came here for breakfast, it was on the expensive side (like everything in Vegas) but the good was delicious and filling. Conveniently  located in the Cosmo, right next to the door closest to the Bellagio. 

I order the Earl Gray (Yes, they got one extra star for that) and a salmon bagel with the cream cheese, lettuce, onions and tomatoes - boo, no wheat bread here. The salmon was on the bland side, bread was really hard. Overall my good was OK but way too expensive in my opinion ($15-$17 i believe)

Would eat here again, but maybe for lunch instead of breakfast."}
{"text":"This is a nice restaurant almost forget you in Vegas. I had the French toast. It was some of the best I ever ate. The bread was so thick and fluffy they had to make it there self.  I also ate some buffalo Strips. They were just regular nothing special. I would definitely go back next time I'm in town trying to relax."}
{"text":"Went here when the Wicked Spoon buffet line was too long on Sunday morning and so glad I did.  This place had fantastic food and service was very good.  My girlfriend and I both had the Build Your Own Burgers.  I was still in the mood for breakfast so I had mine topped with bacon and an egg, as well as avocado and cheddar cheese.  I requested it medium rare and it was prepared perfectly.  My girlfriend had hers with mushroom, bacon and cheddar (she gives this place 4 out of 5 stars).  As our sides we tried the fries and tatter tots.  Both were great.  Ask for a side of their ranch too, outstanding!

I highly recommend going to The Henry over the Wicked Spoon since you will save time and money.  I'll definitely be back when visiting the Cosmopolitan."}
{"text":"Eh. Good, but not $50-for-brunch-for-2 good. We went this morning for our 11th wedding anniversary. We booked through Open Table, so we didn't wait at all to be seated. We got a nice corner booth. Our waiter wasn't cloyingly overfriendly, but he also wasn't very ... friendly. I ordered the carrot cake pancakes and a side of bacon; my husband got the two-egg breakfast (and coffees and OJs for both of us). Minutes after ordering, someone brought over the bacon, which seemed weird: I guess I'll just nosh on this bacon while I wait for my pancakes? But then the waiter came by and asked, \"Why did they bring you this bacon?\" and whisked it away. I got new(?) bacon when my meal arrived. The food was good, but not extraordinary. And the place is very noisy. Pretty sure we will cross this one off our to-try list and call it a day. Many other breakfast destinations in town are a better value and a more enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"I could eat here every day! The atmosphere is great. The staff is so friendly. The food is amazing. I had the yogurt parfait so we could try the beignets. The parfait was large. The granola was homemade and delicious. There was a fresh berry sauce with chucks of blackberries. The beignets were light and warm and had a lemon curd to go with them. Everything on the menu looked amazing and seeing other people's plates made me wish I could have stayed a few more days!"}
{"text":"I need to give this place another shot. We went on a busy weekend night and were celebrating. The server must have forgotten about us because we waited longer than usual before even being greeted or getting waters. We ordered the guac and they told us it was on the house! Very unexpected and generous! We ordered our food--got the short rib and the roast beef sandwich. Short rib came out perfectly and was to die for good. They brought out the wrong entree for our second order and had to send it back. It took pretty long for us to get it correct, and sadly by the time it arrived the other meal was gone and we had been sitting for a few minutes just staring st each other. The second meal was okay, but probably not as good because it was rushed being thrown together and was missing the sauce to dip. I didn't bother mentioning it cause we had already waited so long at this point.

They brought us a dessert on the house and apologized and we appreciated it.

I definitely want to give this place another shot cause the ambiance and decor is so fun and the menu has lots of great mouth watering items. Total Instagram worthy restaurant if you know what I'm saying haha"}
{"text":"Loved everything except how large the portions are.   Our server was amazing!  If you are ordering French toast consider sharing with 3 people!"}
{"text":"Utterly delicious!  I mean it.  This is the other restaurant that I've been lucky enough to go to during Restaurant Week, and again, I have not been disappointed.  I'll admit, though, during any other circumstances, I may not have been coerced into trying this place out--prices mainly.

We had a group of 6, and they were quite accommodating.  I had also made a separate reservation for another group through Open Table, and changed it according, through the hostess.  They were pretty helpful in trying to get our tables together, though, which I appreciated.

Being as it was during the week, I'm pretty sure that our reservations were unnecessary (since we walked right in and there was no wait), but I can definitely see how this place would have lots of traffic and why people would need to be prepared to wait.  

I must say, I thorougly enjoyed my dining experience due to a number of factors: ease of finding the restaurant (make sure to park in the West Tower/Area vs. East to avoid a long walk), accessibility was close to the Strip (a bonus for some of our friends that wanted to walk around after the large meal), and the excellent service (seemed like the wait staff was coming around quite regularly to either ask us if we had any requests or to to give us refills...no, not in a way that got annoying, but definitely enough times to know that they were present).

Since it's Restaurant Week, we definitely went with this menu.  The choices were a Caesar or Wedge salad with bits of tomato, bacon, and cheese, in addition to the dressing for the first course.  The second course options were Prime Rib with mashed potatoes or Salmon with bacon, green beans and potatoes.  Finally, the third course was Chocolate Cake or Banana Cream Pie.  Basically, our group had a combination of the salads, prime rib, and a combination of the chocolate cake and banana cream pie.  I thought it was actually pretty funny that nobody got the salmon.  Haha.

We also had bread and butter for the starter, although nobody was really impressed with this dish.  My boyfriend did, however, order the truffle tots, which were gobbled up in seconds.  The tenderness and crisp tots were actually pretty tasty, without feeling that \"I just bit into a lot of grease and need to spit all of this out,\" but more like \"Just one more\" repeated again and again.

The salads were, well, salads.  

As for the prime rib, JUICY JUICY AND JUICY!  I could get enough of it.  If I would've had to have given up any of the other options in lieu of another piece of prime rib, I would've done it in a heartbeat.  I feel like you couldn't go wrong with the prime rib, and I was unwilling to be the lone soul to order the salmon, instead.

With the desserts, it seemed like people were split on this.  If you like a moist, filling chocolate cake, look no more.  That's what they had here.  If you expect anything else out of a chocolate cake, you're probably not gonna like the dessert here.  Did I mention that the piece of cake was pretty much close to 5 inches tall?  Amazing!  I heard that the Banana Cream Pie was pretty good, but I'm more of a chocolate person, personally.

Can't wait to come back for more Prime Rib!"}
{"text":"Loved the food, coffee, waiter, and manager. We are from Houston, Texas and this was our first stop. Thank you for a wonderful Father's Day brunch."}
{"text":"I was dissapointed durring my visit. I arrived with one other person to grab a quick bite to eat since the restaurant was reasonably empty. It ended up taking 20 minutes to get seated. 10 minutes to order. And 30 minutes for food. The food was great quality and perfectly prepared but the wait times were unrealisticly long for a simple omlette and a club sandwich ."}
{"text":"Delicious. The breakfast here was amazing. I will def eat here again!"}
{"text":"Three of us were going to try Egglsut for breakfast but opted not to wait in the awfully long line.  Instead we went to The Henry where my two friends had eaten breakfast before.  I ordered The Henry Breakfast which is a choice of ham, bacon, pork or chicken sausage, three eggs done the way you want, hash browns, and toast.  I ordered pork sausage, eggs over easy, and rye toast.

Coffee was brought almost as soon as we sat down and it was refilled during the time we were there.  Water was also brought and refilled.

My eggs were a little more than over easy but they were good.  The hash browns were good.  The sausage links were standard and OK.

The room is very pleasant and we enjoyed talking and watching the tourists walk by."}
{"text":"Wanting to sit and enjoy eating breakfast or lunch with your friends ? Well this is the place. Great cozy couch settings and delicious reasonably priced food choices. Great atmosphere indoors and out, let's not forget the lovely staff. Only thing please be sure to call in advance for seating. Because this place is in such high demand... many people come and it can be difficult to get a last minute seat. So Don't forget to call and reserve ahead to complete your great service and experience."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong here. Located inside the Cosmopolitan Hotel, this is a nice oasis of relaxation and food. I was there for a business luncheon and would only rate it 5 stars because the staff knew enough when to serve us and when to leave us alone. Food was very good, but service was even better. 
I had the Cobb Salad. If you want a mixture of leafy greens, fiber and protein, this is what you should have. I saw that my colleague ordered the club sandwich and 1 piece (which was a quarter) was enough. This sandwich could feed 4 people. My customers ordered the caesar salad which was also quick large/filling. Great lunch. Great service."}
{"text":"Great service, quality and ambiance.  Had the chicken bahn mi, beverly hills turkey club, white truffle fries and mac and cheese.  All were expertly prepared with fresh ingredients and good portion size.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Low-key, solid breakfast spot. Not a huge wait and some very good dishes. 

On my trip, we had the Warm Signature Donuts. You get three and they are very savory and WARM. The bananas foster and caramel flavors mix perfectly. We also had the Short Rib Eggs Benedict, which was one of the best breakfast items I've had in quite some time. It was a little different than your typical morning dish, but packed quality flavor to hit your breakfast cravings.

Relatively affordable, no long wait like you see at plenty of other places, and I'd argue one of the better breakfast menus in town."}
{"text":"(We visited 2 FRC restaurants during our visit to AZ :P)
We came here for NYE. They were booked full, but plenty of bar/lounge seating, with also the cafe-side open. Amazing atmosphere and decoration. 

The food and drinks were also delicious, love the cod! The menu was special NYE, so maybe more limited or different from regular menu. We stayed here for hours (first for drinks then for food), it was also big enough that it was not too loud for conversation. 

The service was also excellent--at first I thought sitting at the cafe-side (not the major dinner area nor bar) we would get neglected as many restaurants tend to. But our servers were very attentive and walked by frequently. The restaurant wasn't entirely full (at least the cafe-lounge side?) the whole night, so highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Come to the Henry for a good solid meal.   First,  love the ambiance here, there are tables outside for 'in the country'  dining when it's triple digits out and if you'd rather go indoors, there's comfy wood environment inside, nicely cooled, warm woods everywhere.   The wait staff is focused.   The crowd:  the pretty people of Phoenix out for a meal.  You can tell the Henry makes money on drinks here, yet the bartender didn't have Aperol or cassis.  No biggie  I moved on to other drinks. 

Dinner

Salmon Toast-- on a nicely chewy toast, arugula/cheese (not a fan of dairy with seafood), I should have asked beforehand but the dish was good. 

Pork Chops, cauliflower mash, wine reduction.  I was craving a nice Pork Chop and this dish was superb,  coddled with a scrummy cauliflower mash and a wine reduction, I almost finished the entire thing, it was so good.  I expected a nicely made pork chop and I got it. 

Bread pudding,  Salt Caramel Ice Cream-  Well made, the golden raisins made the difference and the croissant pudding was 2die4.  Needed it to be a lot warmer but still it was good.

Very nice dinner service, a smidge dressy for a very casual city.  Kitchen staff is very serious but I think it's because the resto is meant to be that, high service level to a dressed up crowd.  Twas a good experience, coming back.

Visits:  1

Tip:  Menu is straightforward.  Dishes tend to be larger.  If and your mate come, it's very doable to  order, eat half and swap plates:  then you get to try 2 dishes, or 4, or 6 depending on how many courses both of you partake."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for breakfast or lunch if you're staying at the Cosmopolitan. It's a bit on the pricier side, but not anything outrageous or not-to-be expected - it is Vegas after all. If you want salads, sandwiches, and comfort food, you'll be able to find all that here. I haven't tried their burger, but if you are thinking of getting a burger here, go to Holsteins (on the 3rd floor) instead - they make phenomenal burgers.

I split a salad and sandwich with my coworker and they were really thoughtful and split our meal on separate plates before serving us.

The Tuscan Kale Caesar Salad ($11) was good - it was a mix between romaine lettuce and kale, with parmesan cheese, croutons and and caesar dressing. It was everything that I expected in the salad. Nothing that blew my socks off, but it was good and a solid salad.

The French Dip Sandwich ($16) was also good - it was decently sized and they were not too skimpy with the meat. The best part were the truffle tots - perfectly crispy and anything with truffle is amazing.

I was glad I split the salad and sandwich - it was the perfect balance of food, and the right amount of food for me. I'd come back here again for breakfast, brunch or lunch, and a good option for late night food since it's open 24/7."}
{"text":"whattttt
the food here was stinking delicious
maybe we had low (to no) expectations
but we couldn't stop moaning while we bit into our

-shortrib eggs benedict
-the fluffiest california club omelet w/ a \"side\" of 4 fat and juicy chicken sausages

and slurping up our

-super spiked iced tea with lemon and ginger

our waiter was spectacular
one of the best brunches i've ever had"}
{"text":"Overall is great experience at this place. Ensure you have a reservation before you go over or you will be waiting a bit. The food is great and the drinks were worth the while."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and had the BEST bloody mary! Bartender was super nice, and we ordered a few apps, the kale dip is delish. Good vibe. Also, got a coffee to go and it was terrific."}
{"text":"I love the Cosmopolitan and all the restaurants on the second floor. The Henry does not fit in with the rest of them.

SERVICE:
I visited with a reservation and waited 20 mins to be seated. Once seated, it took about 20 mins to be addressed and our order took 30 mins to get to our table. If you get annoyed by slow service, avoid this place at all cost. 

FOOD:
The menu options are basic but filling. Some of the items we ordered were cold by the time they got to our table.

Overall, it was a miss for me and would not give it another try."}
{"text":"All I can say is OMG.  I picked out this restaurant online just because of the Millionaire Deviled Eggs.  Quite frankly that was the thing I like least.  Only because the Thousand Island dressing overpowered the entire thing.  I could taste a little crab but no truffle or caviar.  I would put the Thousand Island around the plate so you could dip in a little or a lot to your taste.

That said, the rest of the food, as well as the wine, was totally delightful.  I had the French Dip with Truffle Tater Tots and the hubby had the Lobster Club with Truffle Tater Tots.  We paired it with their CC: Winery 2008 Cab.  This Cab was terrific and complimented the food well.

The French Dip was Prime Rib and was sweet, tender and delicious-- the bread was perfect, toasted on the bottom and flaky like a croissant and the Swiss cheese just gave it that little something in the background.  

Hubby's Lobster Club was also great--lobster was cooked perfectly.  The bacon was applewood which gave it a great flavor.  

Now to the Truffle Tater Tots--AMAZING--we had to ask how they were made.  The waiter said they were fried in oil with a little truffle oil infusion, then tossed with truffle salt with just a hint of truffle oil drizzle.  I love anything with truffles and these not only didn't disappoint, but I may spend the next year trying to get them right at home.

Our service was fine but we were there on a Tuesday around noon.  Definitely going back."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!  While the decor and atmosphere were lovely, the service and food left a lot to be desired.  The hostess was unengaged and trailed behind us.  The server, while initially friendly, didn't bring us basics that were requested and seemed to ignore us when he realized we weren't ordering alcohol.  Finally, the food was uninspired and insufficiently cooked.  My chicken was raw.  I didn't complain because at that point we were all so irritated that I didn't want to come across as obnoxious.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"We are SO disappointed in our meal today. We got there excited to eat the AMAZING cinnamon roll croissant French toast and chicken fried steak, (among other things) only to find out they don't make those items anymore. According to the waiter they hired new cooks and changed the menu in June. We decided to try the lunch options since they didn't have the breakfast items we had specifically come for. I had the French dip sandwich and my husband had the meatloaf. 1st of all We waited a long time for the food. When it came, my sandwich and fries were barely warm and you could tell not fresh - the cheese wasn't even soft or melted. It also came on a small flat square cutting board instead of a plate, how am I supposed to dip my sandwich and not have it dripping all over the place? Lol. It tasked just ok, I don't like to complain so I ended up just eating what I could. My husband's meatloaf was just ok, nothing great. We decided right then that we definitely weren't coming back. A few hours later both my husband and I started to get sore stomachs, and 8 hours later (which is the time you'd get food poisoning) I was fighting not to throw up and couldn't stay off the toilet. I knew it was the food we ate from because that's all we ate the whole day. 

Anyways, Before today it was one of our favorite must-go- to- restaurants to have breakfast in vegas. As restaurant owners ourselves, we're always trying to find the best restaurants to eat at. And we come here a lot, pretty much every month or every other month. Needless to say we're bummed and won't be going back! They lost out on regular big spending customers. Don't fix something that ain't broke!"}
{"text":"Every other breakfast is now tainted.  Great food, great ambience and great service.  Not sure if we can recreate this food at home but are sure going to try."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and casual atmosphere, but definitely nice enough for a special occasion. Service has always been efficient and friendly. Try the gratin potatoes - YUM!!"}
{"text":"Great experience. Truffled tater tots, deviled eggs w/ caviar and more truffles!, and a short rib benedict  with even more caviar!!! what more can you really say??? Sit down, relax and enjoy an overly indulgent breakfast or midnight snack."}
{"text":"Sold at Wild Mushroom Tortelini! Also, you HAVE TO order the cheese popovers! Everything was great and I really liked the atmosphere at lunch and at dinner."}
{"text":"The Henry was awesome! One of the best brunches we had while in Phoenix. The atmosphere was like a vintage/industrial mix, the quality of the food was fresh, and the service was great. Our server Cameron was kind, patient and very helpful. 

We started out with the Parmesan popovers that were served with two kinds of butter-WOW!! I had the veggie scramble just filled with delicious veggies. Another friend had the carrot cake pancakes which she said were to die for, and another friend had the egg white omelet which she also enjoyed. The whole experience was great!"}
{"text":"stumbled upon this place at 2am...and the BURGER was sooooooo good, totally hit the spot!

Great service too - my friend and I told the waitress that we would be sharing and the food came out perfectly split in half for us.

A bit expensive but hey, it's Vegas."}
{"text":"Great cob salad and my boyfriend loved the chicken soup which was just right to keep you go"}
{"text":"I was extremely impressed with this place. I met a friend here for brunch and I was very surprised with how great this restaurant looked inside as well as how delicious the food was. This was my first trip here and it took me a few minutes to figure out how we were to be seated. I was expecting a host/hostess to seat us but when I looked around I didn't see anyone. There was a counter off to the side where everyone orders from. After your order and pay, you take your number and seat yourself. 

I ordered a quinoa breakfast burrito which had organic eggs, quinoa, black beans, roasted corn, pasilla chile, avocado and pepperjack cheese wrapped into a tortilla.   It was so yummy. I ordered an iced coffee that was good. My daughter had a blueberry muffin, a side of scrambled eggs and freshly squeezed orange juice. 

This is a great place for meeting clients, friends and even to just work alone. They have a room off to the side with large tables where everyone seemed to be working in their laptops. Very cool!! I will be returning!!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. Service was particularly slow that day, and I'm not sure it would always be that case. Ordered an towelette with toast and potatoes. Their Henry potatoes are pretty good -- a personal mixture from what they said. Would recommend trying if you're trying to get out of the buffet's for a meal"}
{"text":"Taking in the breath taking views here at the Cosmopolitan I got hungry for some real food. Muffin and coffee are wonderful, but are not real food. 

This brought me to the Henry. It was quiet and had no lines. The restaurant is very quiet and slow. This is what I am looking for now. I was seated off to the back in a nice little nook that is peaceful.

The menu here is something I can get into with so many breakfast choices at 3 pm. Believe me this is the night menu too. It is fantastic. 

So many choices of wonderful food selections. This is going to be an awesome place to revisit, since I enjoy good breakfast at all hours of the day. The hours here are fantastic too. They are 24  / 7. Who could go wrong with that? I applaud them. This is a rarity here in Vegas to find a decent and upscale place to eat at 3 am; for example. 

Adding this to the permanent bookmarks in my Yelp app. I can now get good breakfast or steak at an hour. Mental check done!

I had the French Toast, in which the portion sizes are massive. The giant was Jack in the Beanstalk must eat here. The plates are portioned to his liking. Fresh fruit comes on top with my mix of strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries. The fruit is fresh . The french toast is cooked with cinnamon and other lovely spices. It smells so good, and the powder sugar is all it needs. I am not a big fan of syrup but they put it on the side. 

Who knew that a Rose infused cocktail with elderberry and vodka would go with french toast. Vodka goes with everything; enough said. But the mixture of all these flavors bring out the cinnamon in the french toast. 

The name of the libation that I tried on the menu was Rose All Day. I believe it is the cantaloupe Vodka and Elderflower that give the drink that amazing taste.

Having been so long since I have had apple pie I am trying their spin on it here. The menu has it paired as a traditional style. With the Apple pie along with vanilla ice cream. They use caramel sauce to sweeten the deal with their pairing. It looks way to amazing to eat too. The taste of the Apple pie is over the top. It is served warm with the Apple pie and vanilla mix sheet decadence. The caramel sauce just seals the deal.

Mental note when you have midnight - two am cravings; this is the place to come. The service and food are fantastic. It's located in my favorite casino. What a great pairing when I come back. Oh! Did I mention"}
{"text":"Mmmmm...quinoa tacos are freaking awwwwwwesome!!!

I met a friend for lunch, he had been, I had not. I always scope out the yelp reviews before coming, because as a veggiesaur I like to know if I have options or if I should pregame it prior to coming to I'm not starving.

I had a bit of an inward struggle trying to decide between the seasonal vegetarian salad and the medallion quinoa tacos and SO glad I went with the tacos. They are a little small, so if you have a huge appetite, I would recommend getting a side to go with, but for me they were perfectly sized and delish. Great flavor and mix of crunchy/soft ingredients.

The atmosphere is super cool as well, I am loving the walls in here!!

Oh and a small tip if I may, make a reservation on open table prior to your visit to ensure ultra fast seating during the lunch hour. :)

I will be back for brunch in my near future because I saw many great mouthwatering pictures on good ole yelp that are making my stomach growl!"}
{"text":"Cafe inside the Cosmopolitan. Decently sized restaurant offering their take on various breakfast dishes. 

Wait times can vary but we were seated fairly quick. Host staff was pleasant to get us seated. 

Wait staff was a little slow to introduce. The group of us five made our different items. Including omelets, Benedict, French toast, and breakfast burrito. A coffee was also ordered. 

Water came at a good time. Coffee was filled sporadic. Coffee was ok nothing stellar. 

Food came reasonably quick. I ordered one of the hearty omelets which came with a side of toast. Potatoes were also served with the dish. Some of the best breakfast potatoes I have ever tried. The omelet was good. Lots of flavor. Not salty. The other dishes were savory and much enjoyed. 

Bill and check settlement were relatively quick. 

Good: food was decent. 
Bad: mediocre to okay speed of service.

I would come back as nothing was pricy and food was decent."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great location, good parking, and the food and coffee is always awesome!"}
{"text":"Just went in for my friends birthday and let me tell you we had the best service! For our drinks we got the mule, strawberry Collins, and apricot punch. The punch was so good that we ended up all switching to the punch! Our server Dana recommended the Branzino and Korean skirt steak and they were incredible. Since it was a birthday we couldn't leave without having dessert, my friend got the peanut butter cake and Dana put a candle in it for his birthday! I was hesitating on whether or not to get the bread pudding because I was already full but Dana sold me on it in a heartbeat, it was so good that I forgot about how awesome my skirt steak was! I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is our go to place if we are every hungry at Cosmo....meaning it is open 24/7 so it's always accessible. It's an upgraded version of a diner, located on first floor with casino.  I enjoy the nachos (tatertots loaded with toppings.). In mornings when I eat there, I enjoy the omelette. I wish I took a photo, because it was beautiful. 

Recommend: sure if your hungry and don't wanna deal with fuss of the premium restaurants or wanna wait in the drunken pizza line. 

Return: of course."}
{"text":"This is place is in the Cosmopolitan resort and is a great place to eat breakfast.  However, come hungry because portions are huge.  The ham hock and corn beef dishes were excellent.  The salmon and avocado toast was nicely prepared.  A cup of coffee is cup of coffee.  The coffee is great roast.  The wait staff is friendly and very informative about the menu.  The cost is high hence only 4 stars.  I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"It was close to midnight, I had not had dinner yet and I was starving.  At this point there were few restaurants open and even fewer with gluten free options so I was happy to find The Henry.  But the fact that they were open and had gluten free options was pretty much it on the positive side.

On the negative side, it took 30 minutes to get my order even though the place was not very busy.  The burger tasted like there was something wrong with it.  The tater tots weren't much better.  I don't think I finished half of the meal before I had to call it quits."}
{"text":"Awesome Burgers! It is a very chic and cute eatery in the casino.  The food is very good. and the drink menu offers many different choices.  It opens late."}
{"text":"I stayed at the Cosmopolitan for a few days and decided to grab breakfast at the Henry, which is open 24/7. Service was pretty good. My husband ordered The Big Breakfast (they serve breakfast all day here) which he thought was tasty, although I found a little bland. I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap that was awesome, a little on the spicy side, but really delish. Definitely opt for the Parmesan truffle tater tots as your side, those were so good! Prices are typical Vegas, however I didn't expect to pay $15 for a mimosa. Good place to grab a bite if nothing else is open in the Cosmo, we will return!!"}
{"text":"Superb breakfast/brunch spot. I would highly recommend nabbing a reservation in advanced because this place was packed on a Sunday morning! The food was phenomenal and the table side Bloody Mary's were outstanding. Our group had anything from waffles to eggs Benedict and all were prepared to perfection!"}
{"text":"Great staff, great pastries, awesome coffee! Plus the atmosphere is so dreamy. Definitely want to live there. I love all of this companies restaurants, they know what they're doing for sure!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place after a rigorous gym session. First, it's a beautiful unique restaurant that is fancy yet casual! It has an amazing San Diego/San Francisco feel. They make their own breads and dressings and as much as they can in-house and offer a lot of different foods and yummy salads! We split a salad and a sandwich and they split both for us! It was definitely enough food. The service was top-notch and accommodating. Great place to go post-workout and for couples or dates! :) Comfy seating, and a great atmosphere! We will definitely be back to try different salads and entrees. The food was delicious! Thank you for a great experience!!!"}
{"text":"What a great experience. Our server Kati at The Henry was the best. She was really friendly, made good recommendations, and was attentive in the right way. My wife has food allergies and the staff at Henry know exactly what is in their food and make sure she is taken care of. Try the Fig & Ginger Mule if you like that kind of thing, she loved it. We started with the kale & garlic dip with veggies instead of bread, and the onion soup, both were great. I had the delicious and spicy Korean skirt steak, it is a smaller portioned steak but is packed full with flavor. We also had the Broccoli Cheddar Tortelli (pasta) which was really good but again a smaller portion. We finished the meal with the awesome bread pudding."}
{"text":"I've only been here for drinks and appetizers, but the drinks are all delicious! I'm a fan of Moscow Mules and I love the Kale dip! The atmosphere is great and it's always clean! I always see the Bloody Mary bar being rolled around the aisles, and want to try one, just haven't had a chance yet! I'd recommend this place for anyone in the Arcadia area!"}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast, overall my experience was 4/5 stars. Food was great, they keep the menu simple and easy to understand. All servers and wait staff had a smile and helpful."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast. Was really a small menu, with nothing that stood out to me. Basically a small cafe style menu, with very health conscious choices. My date and I decided on the turkey sausage scramble and the lox bagel. 

The lox bagel was good, but the scramble was definitely not anything special. For the price, I thought the breakfast was pretty disappointing overall. 

I did look at the lunch menu and found that it looked a lot better. Overall, from my experience - all i took from it, is that that it's not a place that's great for breakfast and is a little over priced."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  

Tried the omelet, and for $18 I was hoping for it to be special.  It wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't special.  And of course I had to try the short rib benedict, but the short rib wasn't as tender as I had hoped, and it was really rich and fatty.  Plus my eggs were overcooked, so I didn't get the nice yoke that I had hoped for.  Nice idea on the dishes, but the execution was lacking, so I left hungry for something else."}
{"text":"This place is quit AMAZING! The only down fall was the wait time. The restaurant receptionist said it would be a 45min wait, however we waited 20 minutes if that. I was not aware of making reservations, next time, it will be smart to do so. 

When we were seated, we had two waitress name Jenna and Cathy- I think Jenna was training Cathy as a server. Anyway, they were both courteous, nice, and gave a really good descriptions on the whole menu, as this was my first time here.

 I ordered two appetizers, a salad and two mimosas. The appetizers were Rib Eye Potstickers which was a very strong BBQ taste to it. Definitely not a an appealing taste. On the other hand, Salmon bits were to die for. Every single bite, I was sad that it was gone. Luckily, there are 4 bite size and it was very satisfying. My main course- Turkey Salad was scrumptious! I would definitely buy it again. Lastly, the two mimosas was very delish! 

Overall, with the server, food, and overall service, I will go again in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Food: 2
Decor: 3
Service: 3

Came here for a late dinner around 11pm.

The Henry Burger*
caramelized onions & mushrooms, sharp cheddar, 
on a soft potato roll, 14
~Mediocre. Burger was just okay, and I didn't like how the tomato, lettuce, and onions were on the side since it was impossible to add them to the burger because of the cheese. Truffle hash browns were pretty average too.

Service was okay, although my water was almost empty at the end of service."}
{"text":"Super delicious. The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable. Food was amazing and the atmosphere was great. Came in a large group and they treated us very well. I can't wait to come back. This is a perfect place to hang out or go on date night. Everything was lovely"}
{"text":"My favorite spot for lunch and to work out of in Arcadia! The west side of the restaurant is an excellent place to bring your laptop and have a coffee! Sam Fox killed it with this one! Food is great & the house cab is excellent as well!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I visited The Henry early on a Saturday night. It was a warm day so we sat outside on the patio which has a very pleasant, laid back atmosphere.

We started with an order of cheddar popovers, served with ham butter and herb butter. They come in an order of 3. They were good but not amazing. The butters were really good though. If they had a bread basket and served it with these butters, that would be a knockout. 

For our dinners I ordered the pork chop and boyfriend got the Chevy Chase, which is a steak sandwich. He really enjoyed his sandwich a lot. The steak was done just right and the roll was fresh. The fries were cut really thin and were tasty as well.

My pork chop was delicious. First of all, it was huge - a very thick, bone-in chop. It was served with caramelized onions on top, a cauliflower \"polenta\" and chard. All the items were cooked to perfection and the flavors went together very well. The chop was tender and juicy, the chard was full of flavor and the cauliflower was a nice way to round everything out. Even the onions were good and I usually hate onions. I would definitely order it again.

For dessert we ordered the chocolate cake. It is served in a jar, which we were not expecting - we thought it would be a slice - but once we took at bite we didn't care how it was served, it was so good! It's ooey, gooey goodness in a jar is what it is. Get it, you'll love it.

I can see why this place has gotten so many great reviews and why they're saying this is the best Fox restaurant yet. I have to agree - from the atmosphere to the service to the food, this place is fantastic. I like all Fox restaurants, honestly, but this one does stand out as one of the top. I can't wait to go back and try their brunch."}
{"text":"Slow service, despite not being that busy, and multiple incorrect orders kind of threw a damper on our visit on a Saturday evening following a show. Our party of four was seated promptly, but things went downhill from there. Our server was friendly, but didn't show often, and when he did, apologies were usually in order. One member of our party observed that a bottle of wine that she was familiar with was reasonably priced, so we selected that, and it was delivered in a timely fashion. 

When it came time for the food orders, though, there were issues. Three of us ordered grilled cheese with tomato soup from the late night menu, but we wanted to add bacon to the sandwich. When the sandwiches finally came, there was nary a strip of bacon in sight. In the interests of time, we asked that they just bring the bacon and we'd take care of it, rather than a remake. Once we dug in, except for being a little light on cheese, the sandwiches tasted OK, but they had gotten a little cold as well. 

Perhaps we just caught them on a bad night, but this visit just didn't impress. One member of our party said he'd had better experiences, but that confirmed that this was not their best effort."}
{"text":"Attended this establishment last night for a friends birthday. 

The building is a cool design and looked great we were all excited to try it out. 

We sit at our table and are greeted by our sever Sarah. 

I have to say I have never been treated so rudely in all my life and either had the other people in our party. 

After having a round of drinks and some starters out sever comes over again to see if we would like to order. We ordered more drinks and our main meals. 
The girl server asked some of us for our ID's and stated I was 19 once I know what you guys are like??? I was the youngest at the table and she didn't ask me????

We are all late 20's to 30's and all professionals. Going to what is suppose to be an up market restaurant with a sever saying comments like that it just doesn't float with me. One of the girls didn't have her ID. Meanwhile it's her birthday!!!!!
So the mood of the celebration changed the manager come out after our complaints to the sever and \"Apologised\" there is nothing he could do even after serving us drinks prior??

Our party felt so unhappy and uncomfortable that we decided to leave.
 
I went and asked for the cheque and explained due to the server being rude and the fact they now ruined our night we would like to pay for what we have had and leave to go somewhere else. 

The manager and I became engaged in a heated argument in the middle of the restaurant started by him raising his voice at me because he said we ordered mains and we have to have them or pay for them or he would call the police for theft and not paying a bill??? Who says that to a customer??

I clearly stated we haven't eaten the food and it was ordered in the middle of our complaint which hadn't been dealt with. 

The manager proceeded to inform me he would call the police I said fine please do call them as I was asking for my bill to pay what we had had already and it is not my fault that experience was ruined by rude people. 

He then told me the I need to leave the restaurant as I am trespassing and if I didn't he would again call the police. Meanwhile my party was still at the table waiting for me to return. I complied to his request with the question what did I do other than complain. 
Is this really how your restaurant deals with complains by threatening to call the police??

The manager continued to yell at me even when I was outside. Finally he calmed down and said fine and gave me a bill for what we had eaten and drank and said pay this now!

For a manager to yell, scream and threaten a paying customer is disgusting. I have eaten at many places all over the world and I have to say this was and most likely will be the WORST experience I have had at an restaurant. 

What happened to customer service???

The fact the manager still requested I pay after his and his staff members performance is an absolute joke. 

Clearly the guy needs to get a new profession because customer service is certainly not his thing. 

We went to Chelsea's kitchen down the road and had a great experience after all that. 

Maybe the owners need to take old mate down there to Chelsea's Kitchen to learn respect, manners and customer service!!

Just saying!!!!!!"}
{"text":"After my first night of my three night trip to Vegas I got up earlier than most of my girlfriends. I wandered with on of my friends around Cosmo trying to find breakfast and we stumbled on this place. I got the Signature Short Rib Benedict, which is an eggs benedict dish with braised short ribs served on a crispy potato cake. It was a creative idea, however, it was way too salty in my opinion and the crispy potato cake wasn't as it sounded. Turned out more like mashed potatoes (which were still tasty). My friend ordered the yogurt, which sounds plain, but I was amused with how it was served. It was a big wide bowl of yogurt! Like how oatmeal is served. It made me laugh :) I would give this place another try I'm in the area and need breakfast, but I wouldn't get my dish again.

Star #1: Flavorful food. Yes, although there was a bit too much flavor on my dish.
Star #2: Food causes cravings. No
Star #3: Price worthiness. Not bad for Vegas prices.
Star #4: Decent service. Yes.
Star #5: X factor (ie amazing service, ambiance, creativity, etc). Not this time."}
{"text":"If you come you may want a reservation even for lunch unless you eat at the bar which we did. You do, however, get great service from nice bartender food and drink were unique but very good!"}
{"text":"Amazing food,  great service. We come here regularly on weekends for breakfast! I personally recommend the chicken fried chicken,  and then a 'Go North' (coffee) to go!"}
{"text":"It's been a little while since I've eaten hear but the food is excellent.  It gets a little noisy if they seat you by the bar area so I recommend getting seating away from the bar.  Overall, service is good and the food is great!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation at The Henry for Valentine's Day Brunch.  We arrived a little early, and were seated almost immediately.  I had been to the restaurant for AZ Restaurant week before, and loved the décor inside--I would decorate my house like it!  They have an open kitchen, but the noise it still relatively quiet.

Husband ordered a mimosa ($8) and it was probably the best I ever tried.  The mimosa had the right balance of bubbly stuff and fresh orange juice.  I ordered from the Bloody Mary Cart ($10).  There were several house infused vodkas to pick from as well as garnishes!  My green-chili bacon Bloody Mary was so good, my Husband also ordered  horseradish bacon one.  The coffees looked really good too!

Ordered the popovers ($7) to start, FANTASTIC!  It would be a great savory pastry with coffee if you came in for a light brunch.  The breakfast choices are on the lighter side, I ordered the Original Bacon Sandwich ($10) but substituted the bread for a croissant (great idea!).  My Husband ordered the New Yorker ($12), a corned beef omelet.  He said it would be better served as a hash with the breakfast potatoes and an over easy egg.  Overall, would recommend for the breakfast cocktails and the fair prices for breakfast items.

The only downside was our service.  The server seemed to be unfocused and \"in the weeds\" as she had put it to us.  She took our drink and appetizer order and left the large menus at the table.  After she delivered the appetizer, she left.  Before taking our entrée orders.  We had very little space on the table to eat the appetizer!  After taking our entrée order, we didn't see her again until she plopped the check on the table.  No waters, no drink refills, no asking hour the food was or if we wanted dessert.  Then she seemed really off put when I asked for a to-go cup of water (as I was thirsty!).  Since we had been there before, it might have just been a really bad Valentine's Day Service."}
{"text":"Great dining spot that is open 24/7! I definitely recommend the Short Rib Benedict if you make it on time for the breakfast menu. Also, their orange juice is delish! Serving size is perfect! This spot is located in the beautiful Cosmopolitan! I'll definitely be back again if I ever need a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentine's Day Brunch. They quoted an hour wait but sat us in 20 minutes. Excellent first impression. 
Ordered the grapefruit to Begin and it was like creme brûlée - only, no guilt. Yum! 

My husband got a custom Bloody Mary from the man pushing around a cart of every type of infused vodka you could want, with toppings and spices galore. He said it was de-lish. 

For our main course, I ordered the flower child omelet which was incredible. It had butternut squash, which I was skeptical about initially but it made the omelet so unique! The potatoes were over cooked and blah, so I would suggest subbing for fruit. 

My husband ordered the quinoa breakfast burrito and I was having trouble prying it from his deadlocked fingers for a bite. It was so tasty! Packed a lot of southwestern flavors and the avocado was the icing! 

My friend ordered the chicken fried chicken and he was the first one done. He said he would most likely dream about that meal later in his sleep. I didn't try it, but the presentation was cute with the eggs on top. Very \"brunch\". 

Highly, highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"As they used to say I'm Atlanta ... Oh , Henry.

Love this place. Excellent choices of meat fish or fowl. 

We started with the brisket potstickers...slightly burnt on the bottom, soft on top with plum sauce. So good it should be an entree not just an appetizer. 

I than went for the branzino. No bones, grilled, and brushed with butter. I had kale cole slaw and grilled asparagus. All perfectly prepared...all very filling. 

The Waiter was also delightful... Loved his job, knew the menu like the back of his hand. Entertaining. 

Excellent wine list as well. 

So in honor of Hammering Hank from Atlanta ...

Do me a favor...Go!"}
{"text":"I love the atmosphere!! What a great place to meet friends! I love their breakfast."}
{"text":"The ambience was great, the food was acceptable, and the service was good. I tried the popovers with ham butter, which were OK but not to die for.  I had their homemade pasta dish, called tortelli. It was just OK, nothing special to write home about actually. Not a whole lot of flavor, but wasn't bad. Dinner companion had their chicken and said it was amazing and it was a very healthy portion."}
{"text":"Every time we stay at the Cosmo (too often), we end up going here at least twice. While the food here is pretty pricey for what it is and not even close to amazing - I give it 3 stars purely because of how they generously split dishes for me when sharing entrees. And I don't mean just providing an extra plate and getting shoved the meal to cut it myself. They thoughtfully slice and portion things out in half and still manage to make the presentation nice. I wish they had a spinach and mushroom benedict option for vegetarians (they only have 2 meat benedict options) - when I asked to substitute the meat for spinach and mushrooms instead, we were charged an additional $3 - which I can't justify. I hate that they completely overcharge my sister every time she orders juice - a consistent issue with the bartender we have had because we go so often. It makes me angry just thinking about how they rip her off of just pouring 2 concentrate juices into a tiny glass. I did like their French Onion Soup the few times we had it - can get pretty salty though. Truffle tater tots can get really greasy/heavy/oily by the end too. Overall we go here more because of the location, it's never my choice to go here - management clearly doesn't care about customer satisfaction/loyalty here."}
{"text":"I've come for breakfast, lunch, and coffee, and every time, I've been impressed. Service is always exceptional, and the food and coffee is what you expect from a Fox Restaurant. I would argue that The Henry is their best venture -- the space is unique and the menu is right on par with that.

Also, the test kitchen is an amazing place to eat a meal if you ever get a chance. You're behind the kitchen and you get a semi-private room thats in the middle of the kitchen action -- something i found really intriguing while waiting. That room is where they test all the recipes for their restaurants, according to our server. We were able to snag it on Father's Day with a large group reservation."}
{"text":"We came for breakfast as we were leaving Vegas and what a great end to a great trip. The eggs and hash were fantastic as we're the eggs Benedict my wife ordered. Portion size was generous but not out of control. The server, hostess, and bus were attentive and thoughtful. Presenting the check out server asked if we wanted coffee to go and double checked we had enough cream. A small thing but typical of the service we saw throughout our stay at the Cosmo."}
{"text":"Always a great brunch at the Henry.  This trip we also enjoyed a table side Bloody Mary cart where the hand built Bloody Mary's to you specification using some excellent flavored vodka's."}
{"text":"Truffle tater tots.  They are crispy.  They are savory.  They are delicious.

Had a chicken salad sandwich that was also very good.

I love how their serve their orange juice shaken and poured into a martini glass.  Classy."}
{"text":"Perfect restaurant for a date night! Delicious food and amazing drinks! I highly recommend the Moscow Mule."}
{"text":"Every time we go to the Henry we have received great food and excellent service. If it's not right, they make it right. I do wish they would bring back their wood cooked Pork Chop. it was so tender that it melted in your mouth. The weekend brunch is fantastic with great variety."}
{"text":"EFFICIENCY!!  

I sat at the bar and watched this group of professionals work it. And work it well. 

Smiling servers, serving, a friendly bartender, an excellent dispatcher that was so on top of her game, it was impressive to watch her work (Sunday, 1/22/2017, 6pm or so)

Here's my problem: not worth the $.  Too expensive. 

I ordered the Korean Style Skirt Steak for $26. It was good. It was. And, in no way, shape, form or function, worth $26. I'm not even sure it's worth half that. 

So me and yet another Sam Fox restaurant have to agree to disagree. 

Professional?  Yes. Worth the tab?  0h hell no!"}
{"text":"I enjoy breakfast a ton... haven't been blown away by dinner menu, but you can beat the decor and ambiance!"}
{"text":"On a 3-day trip to Las Vegas, I ate here two times.  It was that good.  My first trip was almost by accident as the combination of an early flight (and a late Friday night) at the Cosmopolitan led me to search for food.  Lucky enough, there was The Henry across the lobby.

The Henry burger was great but the truffle tater tots were excellent.  They might be addicting.  My wife and I spent the entire weekend in Vegas talking about those tater tots and we made a return trip on Sunday night.  

Now, we might need to plan another weekend in Vegas -- just for those tater tots!"}
{"text":"It's the Denny of Cosmo, that stays open late. 

I was busy getting ready for the massive halloween night, was to lazy to yelp a good restaurant and make a decision on dinner. I passed this responsibility on to a non yelper friend who selected THE HENRY, because it was right next to entrance. 

What a FAIL., It was nice, located on a prime spot, great place for sports and people watching. 

Service was slow, food was bad for the price we paid and our waiter was RUDE. 

Ordered a $36 steak and it really did just come with JUST THE STEAK no sides.  Prime rib was dry and thick,.. best thing I had, was the bacon my friend didn't want on his burger and my french onion soup. My truffle tater tots were good too, but I don't think it's worth $7. 

I didn't like how the waiter would ask my friend, do you want soup or salad on the side? when it didn't even come with the entree.  The waiter  pretty much tried to upsell my friends, misleading them; that it came with our entree. Lucky I asked before they placed the order in. 

On top, it took us 45 mins to get our food and they already added gratuity to our bill. SMH.  What a waste of a yelp spot. 

WIll not come back and do not recommend this place. Especially if you were in a hurry; trying to meet the promoters on time to get in the clubs."}
{"text":"My friends decided to have lunch here after a business meeting, and I've never heard of the place so I was really up for anything. I hadn't realized this was a fox concept restaurant, and also that their headquarters were upstairs. Pretty cool. Went inside, was greeted for lunch and were asked if we would like to be seated or order at the counter, we went ahead and got full service for lunch. I LOVE LOVE the decor inside, and with that just alone I would bring someone in to try. We were seated by the hostess right away, but we had to ask for our server to get our order after a good 10-15 mins. They sent a server right away, and we ordered a wild mushroom pasta, turkey french dip, and a bolognese. Our food seemed to take a little longer than usual, as we saw new people sit down next to us and get served, finish their food and servers pick up their plates. A chef came by, noticed our food was taking a little longer therefore gave us some in house guac and chips and apologized. That was nice of them! :) It was delicious too. I liked the wild mushroom pasta I ordered, but the sauce was a bit on the heavier side for me for white sauce. I tried my friend's bolognese, and loved that I could taste the truffle oil on it! I tried the wildflower coffee drink after, so I wouldn't get food coma, and food coma never came! I was so wired and it was so good, definitely recommend it, but a bit less vanilla next time for me. Will definitely recommend for a friend coming, because of the environment but I had a hard time ordering from their menu because there was nothing that I would have really ordered from it. I would probably come back for their coffee bar, and do some web surfing in here. There's definitely a lot of customers that look like they're having business meetings here as well."}
{"text":"When hungry for brunch in Vegas often times you feel limited to the hotel buffets and have trouble finding a great sit-down place, well this place is a great spot to sit-down and enjoy brunch. Inside the Cosmopolitan, lies The Henry with great service and delicious food. Their cinnamon bun French toast is to die for and their egg dishes are all great. I cannot wait to get back here to get the French toast again. Definite must try if in Vegas."}
{"text":"Poor service waited 45 min for 3 burgers that were not to order. Did not bring avocado as specified when I built my burger and never checked on us during the 45 min of waiting after we finished our drinks. I've had better burgers at in and out."}
{"text":"People really just come for the space - it is a great work space when it isn't too crowded, which is rare. Arcadians flock here to hang out all day. Coffee is decent. All around it is solid. I wouldn't say it stands out in any one regard, but it is constantly decent food. A bit higher of a price point if you're not used to the area. I give it 3 because it is better than average, but not exceptional."}
{"text":"Nice decor. Super sloooooooow service.  Food was overpriced and \"eh\". Staff seemed confused and distracted. This is my 2nd visit. I'm tired of asking for refills or getting a server's attention so I can give my order request."}
{"text":"We've been been here a dozen times at lunch & brunch and never had worse service & food. We ordered drinks that we're forgotten & dinner arrived before they were delivered. The manager cane out to apologized for cold food. My son ordered the chicken special with the potatoes & chicken & potatoes were cold. Not luke warm, cold.  He had to eat after everyone was done. They didn't even take it off the bill. We had to talk to other waiters to get the drinks we ordered & when we confronted the waitress she actually said \"I didn't know you ordered that?\" No worries. Too many other places to visit. Sorry Henry's. You \"were\" a family favorite... not anymore."}
{"text":"So, I call the restaurant and inquire if their patio is dog friendly.  The answer is yes.  We come by with our dog about 30 minutes later and informed by the manager (young, good looking hipster dude) that the patio is closed, but 'we'll get you a waiter'.  I told the manager that I was fine to go elsewhere and he said it was no problem.  It was hot and we waited for over 15 minutes and no waiter ever came out.  We finally gave up and went to O.H.S.O. which is very dog friendly.  I get it.... not every place is dog friendly, but why tell us you'll provide service, and then not?"}
{"text":"Henry darling, you did me dirty. I came in looking for a yummy breakfast and left sick with food poisoning. 
Perks : cool vibe, open 24 hours, interesting menu & neat artisan cocktails. 
The Catch: awful service, rave music playing, (not what I want to listen to at 8am on a Tuesday morning, sorry) and the food made me super sick to my stomach. I'm writing this as I lay in our room sick wasting my precious vacation time. 
I got eggs Benedict, the mister got steak & eggs. It took forever to get our food. I wish I had just gone somewhere else. Ugh. 
I would only come here if I'm looking to lose weight & get sick. It sounds like I'm not the only one who has gotten food poisoning here."}
{"text":"Even if you are inexplicably dying of hunger or thirst, do NOT come here.

Your waitress, who'll likely be a former stripper from Reno past her prime, will toss down your menus and expect you to order immediately.  IMMEDIATELY.  And when you're not looking, she'll throw away your takeout from Secret Pizza that you've carefully placed on the seat next to you.

Oh, and if you complain to the management, you get a.....free shrug!!!  A. SHRUG."}
{"text":"Food and wine was awesome. The noise level was on the high side. Very difficult to hear your conversation."}
{"text":"We stopped here for a quick bite to eat while staying at Cosmopolitan. The food was good and the server was pleasant. We had French onion soups that were delicious and the Henry burger with tator tots was pretty good as well. They also have delicious breads that they serve while you are waiting for your meal. I would definitely recommend this place if you just want a quick casual meal."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place to grab a coffee in town. It's perfect for business meetings, family time, or downtime.

It gets a little crowded but well worth the wait. The bar is also phenomenal and the whole thing has a Chicago vibe which is hard to explain. I love it."}
{"text":"It's open 24/7, it was in the hotel we were staying at.  Their burger was actually decent and the truffle tater tots were damn good.  Service is pretty solid and the food comes out fast.  Think high end denny's."}
{"text":"It's a place you always pass by but never go in and I went the other day
the veggie appetizer thing was really delicious I couldn't get enough of the hummus and pita bread they were just delicious
the chicken fried pork chop was ok it wasn't really worth it to me it was a bit basic and could be better
As far as anything with tater tots go make sure you ask for EXTRA TRUFFLE OIL on it to make it taste better than ordinary"}
{"text":"Okay. I call this \"rich people food\", OMG we spent $125 and did not get much. But what we got was good. The drinks were expensive but excellent. Salads, awesome. Brunch, awesome. Sandwich, awesome. Check came, coronary time. If someone else is buying, I will consider it. But I prefer a $15 buzz with wings any day. Plus, I can wear jeans and a tee. Not here. Like a country club feel, really. It is a nice treat."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, we sat at the bar and received fantastic service.
The ham and cheese omelette was very good.  Coffee was good as well.."}
{"text":"Wanted to try a different atmosphere then always at the buffets. This enticed me due to the ambience and breakfast. My husband got the short rib Benedict which also had crusty hash browns with sauce and poached eggs. It was good. I ordered a lighter breakfast of more a veggie dish - eggs Benedict florentine. It was on English muffins and a bed of a lot of plain steamed spinach. On top was a well done poached egg that was perfectly runny and little sauce. It should have been more or I should have asked but for $17, I should not have to ask. I still added pepper and a little salt but asked for saracha. I had a cup of regular coffee that had free refills. All in all the service was good but since my meal was ok, I rate it 3 stars. Our breakfast turned into an eighty dollar meal for three!!! I will not be back but at least, I tried it if it's worth it!! ;-)"}
{"text":"The ultimate \"meh.\"  

You walk into this place and you're struck by the decor.  It's a good looking place.  Good looking furniture, good looking people, good looking design.  Then you notice there's no hostess stand and what appears to be a refugee camp of people crowded to your left.  If you push through that, you'll find a hostess with an iPad that will tell you it'll be 90-120 minutes.  What she won't tell you (or me at least) is that the tables by the door you walked in are first-come first-served.  

The bar area is tiny for a place like this.  It seats maybe 15 and you'll have people hanging over your shoulders the whole time trying to get $7 beers while they wait in the refugee camp I spoke about earlier.  

Once seated you get the priviledge of waiting 15-20 minutes to meet your waiter, who in my case was a very friendly gentlemen.  I think he was the highlight of the evening. 

As has been said in many of these reviews, the menu is very narrow.  We had an app, 2 entrees, a salad, and dessert.  The entrees were good.  The gemelli with housemade bacon was very tasty and the cod was good.  Not $26 good but good.  The salad was literally a few leaves of iceberg and a cherry tomato.  We sent our app back (because it was cold) and then received it cold again.  Really?  Dessert (salted peanut butter bar) was difficult to chew and not really good.  All in with tip for two people we spent $100.  

I like Culinary Dropout, Sauce, and Blanco and I'd heard good things about this place.  What I experienced was that this place is new & feels cool, so you want to believe it was great.  But if you look past the plastic surgery (of the restaurant and the audience) you'll find you could have done better for your money nearly anywhere else."}
{"text":"Just stopped by for Sunday brunch, very crowded so we took a small table outside for quicker service.  Food was pretty good, but the service was pretty bad and the flies (outside) were horrible."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in the valley, San Francisco/NYC quality food, service atmosphere.

Since moving to Phoenix a year ago, I've been to the Henry 10 times at least. Food quality is excellent, service is fantastic, and when there is mis steps, they work hard to make it better, I've never left unhappy and completely satisfied. Looking forward to my next 10 visits."}
{"text":"My work hosted their annual holiday part at the Henry and it was amazing. From the venue to the food and the drinks, both my husband and I loved it. We are dying to come back!

Upon arrival, my husband and I were escorted outside to the heated patio. Our party had the entire patio to ourselves and there was plenty of seating and room to mingle. It was decorated beautifully with lights strung up and a fire going near the back. Several waiters were taking drink orders and I snagged a cocktail menu. I ordered a fig and ginger mule - it was delicious. My husband ordered a drink as well, but I can't recall the exact name. It was in a tall Collins glass and lemony. He said it was one of his favorite drinks and he would come back and order it again and again.

As we mingled, several bruschetta type hors d'oeuvres were being offered. I tried both the brie with pear and a salmon hors d'oeuvre. Both were delicious. 

After cocktail hour was over, we sat down to enjoy several appetizers. We tried a spinach and artichoke dip that was delicious. It was both creamy and rich with a lot of flavor. Then there was a shrimp appetizer with dipping sauces. The shrimp were succulent and cooked perfectly. Finally, we enjoyed a Brussel sprout salad. I'll admit, it was not what I was expecting but delicious! It was like a Caesar salad with crispy Brussel sprout leaves added in. 

There were several entrée options - a vegetarian option, a fish option, a chicken option, and a beef option. My husband and I went for the short rib with mashed potatoes. I'm so glad we did because it was fantastic! The short rib was extremely tender and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were creamy and rich. Both complemented each other nicely and I would definitely order again.

For dessert, everyone was served a teeny-tiny slice of German chocolate cake. Now, I love German chocolate cake and this was like a tease. It was good but not very substantial. Not sure if this is the regular sized portion or different since it was a holiday party. 

After dessert, I ordered a hot vanilla latte and a co-worker ordered the Wildflower (vanilla, espresso, steamed milk, and a splash of chai). I didn't specify a size and I'm not sure if they have multiple sizes, but I was brought a 12oz cup of delicious. The espresso was a little strong and not too sweet, even with the vanilla. My co-worker enjoyed her drink as well. I would definitely come back for another latte! 

Overall, it was a fantastic experience. I will definitely be back to try their brunch and other dinner items. The food was superb and the drinks were on point."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were very excited to get food at the cosmopolitan. We were very hungry and looking for a nicer restaurant. We ordered our food and decided to get a salad and chicken noodle soup. We were expecting the soup to be in a bowl with lots of chicken and noodles, but it was in a small cup. There was hardly any chicken in it, and the soup was also very salty with hardly any noodles. Afterwards, we ordered French onion soup, which was also very salty. All of the soup seemed old and leftover. The salad was good, except the chicken was dry. For $38, we were very disappointed with what we got.

The soup caused my fiancé to have acid reflux, and we left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"This is one of Sam Fox's best places yet!  My wife and I consider this place the standard to compare all other Phoenix places to eat.  Everything we had on the menu was great.  We usually go here to eat once or twice a month."}
{"text":"Great place to get a very late night dinner in Vegas (open 24 hrs). Classy ambiance and impeccable service. Late night menu has breakfast and dinner options. The Henry Burger was good and I loved the truffle tater tots. Easy to book a reservation on Open Table too :)"}
{"text":"The food was exceptional! Beyond delicious. Perfect portions - not too small but not overwhelming. The service was impressive - they didn't freak or make me feel awkward for switching tables when an AC vent made the first table too cold. The server was not over attentive or hovering. She seemed to show up at the perfect times. Skirt steak was amazing, cauliflower polenta was so good... Substitute whatever sides you want. Attention to detail without being pretentious or fussy! Laid back casual atmosphere. Loved The Henry!!!"}
{"text":"Not a veg friendly menu and the staff wasn't really clear on what could be made vegan."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today since the Henry is just down the street.  It is in a great location and the atmosphere is nice and service was good.  I came here hoping to find a good breakfast spot but was very disappointed. I ordered the spicy sausage scramble and what I received was different from the menu description.  The menu says that the scramble comes with Zucchini, spinach and onions.  Mine came with these but they also added snap peas, asparagus and corn.  I don't really like snap peas and the corn took away from the flavor of the dish.  I would not have order it had I known that they weren't going to follow the menu.   

I asked the waitress about it and she said they don't put all of their ingredients on the menu.  I find that hard to believe since corn, snap peas and asparagus are listed on the other dishes. 

Looks like I will have to keep looking for a new breakfast spot.  Hope Matt's big breakfast opens soon."}
{"text":"We planned my sister's 30th birthday at The Henry.  I went to make the reservation for Sunday evening at 7pm for 15 people.  They said that the max reservation size was 12.     Okay, we made it for 12.  Then they asked us to change the time to 530pm or 830pm and that they preferred not to seat a large party during peak dinner hour.  When we said no and we would make the reservation elsewhere, they said okay.  They also said that preferred if we didn't bring balloons or a cake.  They said this with a bit of a snooty attitude.  We were a little caught off guard with all this.  I guess we thought they would welcome a large party, not make things difficult.  We thought about cancelling out of principal, but decided to keep the reservation.

We arrived a few minutes early and it took about 20 minutes to be seated.  Once we were seated, we ordered drinks which were great, but too a long time.  No bid deal.  We ordered dinner and it actually came out pretty quickly.  Overall, the food was very good.  I think our table ordered every entree on the menu.  Both pasta dishes were very good.  The chicken was also good, but mine was luke warm when it arrived.  It tasted great and the sides were also very good.  The fish also got very good reviews.  The only thing that was not well received was the short rib.  The taste was good, but it was really fatty and not much meat.  We didn't order dessert.

The staff and servers were great.  Overall, I would likely go back, but I wish our first experience with the staff making the reservation was more positive.  If so, I would have probably given this review 4 stars."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch during our visit to Las Vegas. Once seated it look 15 mins for the waitress to take our order. Refills on out waters too forever. The food took about 40ish minutes. The food was good but it took forever. Even people that were seated after us where delivered their food before us.  Once we were done we waited another 20mins for her to take our payment for the check. It was a ridiculously long time waiting. We were the only group that was not white in there, hate to say it but maybe that's why we received the worst service."}
{"text":"This is a good, but expensive, option for breakfast.

I had the short ribs benedict which was excellent!  My husband ala carte ordered a ham and cheese breakfast sandwich.

We've eaten here on previous trips and it still lives up to expectations."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch at the Henry. We started out with the Bloody Mary cart. The young man concocted 2 delicious drinks for us. Excellent spin on the Bloody Mary bar concept. 
We ordered a couple small plates which were quite tasty as well. The guacamole and pot stickers came out and were fresh and delicious. I had to try the croissant cinnamon roll. Holy mackerel! That roll is one scrumptious item. We also shared the bagel and lox plate. Interesting presentation. The bagel came completely assembled as a sandwich. I'm used to putting the ingredients together myself. 
So, if everything is is so good, why 4 stars? First impressions, right? When we arrived, there we two very nice and lovely young ladies tending the hostess stand. After standing politely for several minutes on of these aloof young ladies finally turned around to see what they could do for us. I dunno. A table, perhaps? Did they bother to take a name? Nope. 
Fortunately, every other person we encountered was exceptionally helpful and friendly. So we'll be back."}
{"text":"Reservation made on open table which by the way every time I reserve with them we have had a bad experience.  So we arrive before our scheduled reservation and were completely forgotten about.  Service was so so and our meals were not what we expected.   Asked for over over medium eggs and ended up with runny eggs. Just not an overall great experience for the money."}
{"text":"We gathered in the \"living room\" area, up front by the door with chairs, sofa and a low table.  The fish tacos and guac offered at Happy Hour are delish.  Great martinis and the Paloma grapefruit specialty was a hit.  Lots of vibrancy and service is exceptional."}
{"text":"Super hip joint where you order and pay, they give you an order number card on a stand and you choose your seat on the bar, booth with velvet fabric, couches or outside in the fresh air. Kind of like Starbucks but more modern and fresh. New clean building with wide isles probably 7,000 sq ft, open kitchen concept. The breakfast sandwiches were perfect!  Definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Loved the environment at The Henry! They have a cozy space with lots of vintage decorations, and friendly staff that makes you feel at home once you arrive. All of the items on their menu have solid flavor combinations that made choosing just one a challenge. 

We ended up with the short rib potstickers, which were delicious (super tender meat filling!) but also a little pricier compared to other appetizers. I also split the Roasted Turkey French Dip with a side of Kale and Apple Slaw. I wasn't a fan of the kale slaw, but the sandwich was fantastic, especially with the jus for dipping. I loved the kick from the horseradish too! 
For dessert, we had the bread pudding, which was huge! Definitely big enough for the table to share (we had two people and couldn't finish), and had a great fluffy texture! 

I don't know how I had never been to The Henry before, but I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"After clubbing at Marquee, there's 2 food options at the Cosmo. There's the pizza place which had a super long line or Henry's which is on the casino level. Got seated immediately, but service was a bit slow. Food was decent, but sorta pricey. I guess at 4 in the morning and hungry, it doesn't matter. The menu was pretty limited to 5,6 \"entree\" items."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, and both times it was the same thing, and both times it was amazing.  My only complaint is the price.  Sure, it's at the front door of one of the biggest most flamboyant hotels on The Strip, so it's somewhat expected.  I just don't appreciate $50 for two people to eat breakfast.  For the meal I had, $35 was appropriate.  I guess the real estate is just that expensive."}
{"text":"I ordered the Henry because who doesn't want breakfast in the middle of the night? Eggs prepared to order: scrambled, choice of meats: bacon, choice of toast: sourdough and a ridiculous little chunk of of heaven called the Henry potato! Eggs are eggs so nothing new there. Bacon was tasty as expected. The toast was crispy and delicious topped with soft butter and the yummiest of strawberry jams. They bring you a variety of miniature jam selections too. 
The Henry breakfast potato deserves a paragraph all its own. It's red mashed potatoes with garlic, chopped onions, and cheddar cheese mixed in and then GRILLED to perfection. It's amazing all on its own so I wasn't surprised when our server said people come in and order two Henry potatoes and a side of bacon. That's it. 
Service was good. It's located right across from Bond so if the party is swinging, this makes for good people watching."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic lunch at this place. We chose to sit outside, which was a great decision. The outside setting is nice and comfortable. The service was awesome. Our server Taylor was friendly and gave some great menu recommendations. Our daughter enjoyed many great options form the kids menu. My wife and I shared two lunch entrees. Our food was fresh and hot. We really enjoyed ourselves and look forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"The Henry is one of my favorite places to visit.  For the host to the management, the staff makes an effort to learn your name and great you by it every time (even if you're not sitting in there section that visit).  The atmosphere is so relaxing especially on the weekend when they have live music and the bloody Mary cart.  I love to go Saturday morning to kick off my weekend and after my meal just sit and plan out my errands for the rest of the day.  My current favorite item to eat is the quinoa breakfast burrito with bacon added.  It's a lot of food too so a nice dish to share with someone.  I usually can only eat half but that's ok with me; leftovers yes!  
The only not positive thing, is that it's so popular parking can get a bit hard to come by.
For lunch or dinner I recommend reservations which is easily to do through Yelp if you are set up on open table.  If you don't see the time you want available just go anyway and they work hard to find you table without much of a wait as well."}
{"text":"This place is so cool. Giving 5 stars for atmosphere, fantastic food and great service. It's my go to for a bridal shower, Mother's Day, Easter Brunch, mimosas with the ladies, etc."}
{"text":"The food is really bad, I got the chilaquiles and they were disgusting. My friend got the Henry's breakfast and it was also gross. I've had better food at Denny's"}
{"text":"The funny thing is that we been waiting for 20 minutes and I can clearly see the tables open but no one gets to clean them so people can be sit there. Very poor management, the hostess is cleaning the tables, I guess their buss boys are having drinks in the back or something. Get your heads out of your asses and manage this place , if you can't then go work at Burger King or something. Messed up thing is that the casino management is not monitoring this places either. It's their rep on the line but I guess no one gives a rats ass."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence... But I give The Henry 2.5 stars. 
I'm shock myself to why a restaurant in the Cosmopolitan would have poor service and serve low quality food. 

My friends and I dined in for the \"Late Night\" that is available from 11 pm- 6am. It was  3am Saturday morning and there were a couple of diners but not crowded at all. But boy, it took such a long time for our food to come out. After waiting what seem like forever, the food quality was a let down. Especially if you order the fresh fruit as your side because the pineapples artificial, too chewy and flavorless. That goes for the meat burgers as well. 

Just because it's late night dinning doesn't mean the food has to be horrible, right? Drunk people deserve quality food too!"}
{"text":"Best Mamosa's ever! Food is healthy & yummy! Love the scene. Live music and good service. Everything was amazing!"}
{"text":"Had gone to The Henry for a work Christmas party and wanted my daughter to try it. We went for her 18th birthday party. So much fun and the food was fantastic. The truffle fries are lethal in a good way. I could have eaten those as my dinner alone. The lighting and atmosphere is, for lack of a better word, so chill. Love it! Will be my go to for all my special occasions."}
{"text":"I'm really trying to limit the amount of 5 star reviews i give. I think my problem stems from the fact that i'm easy to please with food. Never in a million years did i think i'd be giving a place like this 5 stars... but here we are.
Here's the haps:
This is a random little open bar/restaurant in the Cosmopolitan in Vegas. You've been to or seen a million of these kinds of places and they're generally okay for a quick bite. I got in late for a work trip so i decided to stop by. I happened to be the only person sitting at the bar. The bartender handed me a menu and grabbed a drink order. The menu isn't huge... but just like every other little open bar in vegas they do breakfast, lunch and dinner all day. The bartender recommended a burger so i went with that. Their burgers are a create-your-own style and you get to choose 3 special items to go on there. Feeling a little crazy, i did bacon, avocado and a friend egg. No cheese? Whats wrong with me?? 
Cue the black and white 1950's gangster movie scene:
The bartender comes over, starts hand-drying some dishes and says \"so what's getting to you boss?\" As he sets my whiskey down in front of me. This was pretty hilarious as this literally was a scene out of a movie. Anyway...
I can't even describe to you the amazingness of this burger. I would have given this place 5 stars had i had this burger and had to fight a thousand rats to get to it. Not only was it the best burger I've ever had, i literally had a dream about it recently. This is the worlds only 6 star burger. I don't even remember what side it came with, because i couldn't care less. Everything i did that day became absolutely obsolete. The egg was fried perfectly. The bacon was crispy and fresh. The avocado was half of the most perfectly ripe avocado ever served. The burger itself was fantastically medium well (don't kill me but i love it). The bun was slightly toasted just enough so it had a crunch. Need i go on?"}
{"text":"Had a fantastic brunch with my girl friends. We were being very indecisive and probably not the best guests but our server Maddy was amazing. Looking forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and amazing food! Went there for lunch a few times & never once disappointed. The popovers are a must for starters. I usually ordered the short ribs with their veggie fried rice...too die for!! My friend is gluten free so the restaurant was really accommodating & went out their way to prep her gluten free meal. That's the downside of this place, they don't have gluten free menu but I haven't been there for 6 months so they may have changed? Better call ahead to find out if you need gluten free menu."}
{"text":"The Henry is one of my most favorite restaurant in the valley, the food is great, service great, and so is the ambience.  Highly recommend this establishment!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and reasonable prices compared to other pretentious places we went to in Vegas. I had the Reuben and French onion soup. My fiancé had the chicken soup which eased her stomach."}
{"text":"This late night spot has a few items on the menu that are okay... But half of our table were disappointed with either their cocktails or food.

The server was great and accommodating, however, so if you venture into this little den of inconsistent food samplings send back anything that is subpar.

Recommend: 
Tater tot nachos: braised beef and cheese
Bloody Mary
Kale ceasar ( get dressing on side)
The house made cookie freshly baked with vanilla ice cream


Stay away from:
Breakfast burrito
The bloody made with Makers Mark (Swine something)"}
{"text":"Great food, okay coffee, nice staff still working out some of the bumps.  A bit high priced for a place calling itself a neighborhood restaurant. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! Loved the potato that came with the brunch entrees' and the French toast was delicious! The only down fall were the mimosas tasted a little funny with the orange juice or champagne weren't good. Other than that had a great experience!"}
{"text":"Went there last night for some drinks and a quick bite to eat with friends. Ordered drinks, then food, but after that a good 30-35min passed without a server coming back to check on the table. 

The servers would walk by and ignore the table. It got so and that my buddy got up and went to the bar to order more drinks and I asked two different servers where our food was. When the food finally did arrive, it looked as though it sat under a heat lamp for awhile.

Note: the restaurant was not busy.

As a long time Las Vegas resident, I'm disappointed in both the service and food. Something that is unusual for a Hotel on the Strip.

The restaurant could be a great late night location to eat, but they fell far from that."}
{"text":"Located in The Cosmopolitan Of Las Vegas. The Henry is an update of the classic 24 hour coffee shop of The Las Vegas of yesterday. The food here is fantastic, as is the service. I should quickly mention the Foursquare special; Check in, order two entrees and get a piece of Red Velvet Cheesecake for Free!!!. They have a full bar and the prices are quite reasonable for The Cosmopolitan (That means a bit more than other places, but well worth it.)This place is good for anytime, but if you happen to be there in the wee small hours stop in and have one of the best burgers in Las Vegas, don't forget the truffle tater tots! Live it up, you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"So my aunt and uncle were driving through town and they needed a recommendation on where to meet us up for lunch. Luckily I had heard some great things about The Henry from fellow Yelpers and had this place bookmarked for over a year! Decided on lunch here and so glad we did! The food was fresh as ever and the decor was nice enough without being over pretentious. I ordered the triple decker club sandwich which was loaded with the usual club ingredients but with a much fresher/cleaner feel than what I've experienced at other restaurants. For a side I had a small caesar salad which was great as well. My favorite thing I tried though was the mixed berry lemonade--great flavor that wasn't overly sweet but totally quenches your thirst on a hot day. The experience at The Henry was super positive and the wait staff was superb. I will be recommending it to my friends going forward."}
{"text":"This place was my fave meal in Vegas...well...a close second to In & Out...but that's a whole 'nother review. :)  

He Henry is located inside the swanky Cosmopolitan and is he perfect brunch spot.  Great service, fab menu and awesome drink menu.

Everyone with us seemed to really enjoy their meals especially Kevin with his Ribeye and Eggs. OMG...seriously...one of the best steaks I've had...from anywhere.  Great quality meat and cooked to perfection.  I ordered the Henry Burger and it was equally as amazeballs!  So fresh and totally delicious.  

Our server was so attentive and the food was so good, I will def recommend this place to anyone I know that goes to Vegas!  I can't wait to get backup in this piece to try some of their other fabulous sounding menu items!!"}
{"text":"Great food, cool atmosphere.  A bit on the pricey side. It's centrally located on first floor of Cosmo. The host we had was RUDE. We wanted to both sit facing the tv (after all it was the Super Bowl) then she showed us a table facing each other...with my back to the tv. Just because I'm a lady doesn't mean I don't want to watch the game! So again, I asked her if we could both could face the tv. She asked if we were going to order food. What a bitch! Clearly, we are in a restaurant! Which might I add was rather empty. Finally we got seated in a corner booth thanks to my husband for helping to make that happen. Our waitress and food were excellent thus the 4 instead of 2 star rating. I would go here again (this wasn't my first visit) but if the hostess is anything other then polite I'm going to raise hell."}
{"text":"Poor customer service! Second time my reservation can't be located. The interesting part is that I received a call yesterday confirming my reservation. I confirmed it and today I arrive and my reservation can not be found. The same thing occurred two weeks ago to my friend. The young gal was rude, said, \"you should consider adding reservations to my phone calendar.\" I asked to speak to manager and she replied he isn't it today. FRC needs to take some time to train their employees on the fundamentals of customer service."}
{"text":"So why is it that when I learn that a restaurant is part of a chain my first thought is that it can't be that special? Maybe because when that's the case my assumption is that its food, its operation, its atmosphere, will all be standardized--in the bad meaning of that word. \"Standardized\" as in all the same, all repeatable, all not that special.

Funny how wrong your assumptions can be. (And by \"your\" I mean \"my\" :). 

The Henry is part of Sam Fox's restaurant chain of what he calls his 50 or so \"concept\" restaurants. And yet The Henry totally rocks. Was there with Phoenix friends the other night and had a 5 star meal. Started with the absolutely divine cheddar popovers served with bacon and with dill butters. OMFG. Every meal should start like that. So completely wonderful a way to start a dining experience. Didn't think anything could top that until we each had a cup of the totilla chicken soup. Oh my double FG.... The most rich, succulent, layered, complex tortilla soup I've ever had. What a great way to follow up on the perfect introduction. 

My honey and I next split an order of their roasted chicken and 2 sides which were all very tasty (the unusual cauliflower risotto and the more common but perfectly prepared Brussels sprouts are highy recommended). Finished with what was about the best caramel croissant bread pudding I've ever had, made even better by being topped with some delicious vanilla ice cream. 

Wow! Sam Fox, you da man. I'm a fan and you've made me give up on my false idea that a chain restaurant automatically means mediocre eating. Thanks so much.

So sign me,
David \"Chain-saw\" M"}
{"text":"SOOOO GOOD! The Korean steak dish is unreal"}
{"text":"Not up to standards for a Fox Resturant. Service was slow (waited 45 minutes) and the New York Steak so overdone the manager comped the meal. Took some of the sting out but not excusable for a $47.00 steak. We drove an hour to get there for our special  that was shot. They were not busy on a Sunday night.
  Back to The Green House!  The Best!"}
{"text":"SO DELICIOUSSSSSSSSSSSS... I just.. I can't even begin.

I went with a party of 4 for brunch and we were seated in a quiet corner round table with a great view! Our server was friendly and very helpful in recommending items, and I have to say, everything we ended up picking was amazing.

The Le Pig sandwich (what my boyfriend ordered) was my absolute favorite. I also tried the Quinoa Breakfast Burrito (what I ordered), Breakfast Sandwich & Cinnamon Apple French Toast (from the other two at the table). You could tell it was all very freshly made!

Also to die for, the Cleo coffee (espresso, hazelnut, almond milk). Super cute how they named their coffee drinks after other Fox restaurants in the area :) Definitely coming back as soon as I can!!"}
{"text":"We waited about 30 minutes to get seated despite seeing a good number of open tables.

My gf & I ordered the $40 special that includes 2 glasses of wine (1 per person), Caesar salad, 2 entrees & dessert.

The Caesar salad tasted great, the portion size was good.

We ordered fish & chips & some sort of grilled chicken dish. Both tasted great.

The dessert was some sort of cheesecake, which was great as well.

We needed to flag down our waiter but when we asked another lady a request, we could tell she just shrugged it off thinking that she isn't responsible for us because someone else is our server.

Other than that, not a bad experience but not amazing either."}
{"text":"The Henry is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix. Everything we have tried there has been delicious.  I especially like the Parmesan fries and my husband raved about the flank steak. It is nicely decorated indoors but if the weather is nice we prefer to sit outside on the patio. We usually go on special occasions i.e. birthday, anniversary. A great place to take out of town visitors with amazing view of Camelback Mountain."}
{"text":"Cosmo. We rolled in here with our two year old who was fascinated by the lights to meet our good friends visiting from Maui. They were hurtin' for certain. Mega Red eyes hangover--the cure? Delicious Bloody Mary and SHORT RIBS BENEDICT. Delicious but the portion size was week sauce. That's the only thing that kept it from 5 stars. Go big or go home Henry..."}
{"text":"Food was solid and on point. I could take very minor issue with a couple of things, however, it is the staff that takes this to 5 stars. Very attentive, polite and sincere. They seemed to really enjoy working there and it shows. 
Management came by and checked on our table, water glass always full, server was engaged, food was prompt, hostesses were friendly and greeted us on the way in and out. 
Excellent. When most places in scottsdale lose stars because of staff issues, this place hits a home run. Best service in the Fox chain for sure."}
{"text":"Breakfast was wonderful! Our server was on point.  Traditional Bloody Mary was tasty.  I ordered the California Omelette with sour dough toast.  The eggs were light and fluffy, the avocado was not overpowering and the assorted jellies were scrumptious."}
{"text":"Excellent late night dining option, located at the Cosmopolitan. Big portions, decently priced bottles of wine, attentive service and a convenient location."}
{"text":"My sister and I came here for late lunch Thursday. The menu was very limited and the only item we could get since we are cutting carbs was a salad. I love a good Cobb, and we each ordered one. At $15, they don't even use real roast turkey, it is the pressed \"loaf\" cut into tiny cubes (nasty). The cheese was not Blue (which is standard) and tasteless, and the salad was much smaller than the \"authentic\" Cobbs at 5 & Diner, or even Denny's [both less expensive]. There was literally not enough lettuce (cheap item) to accompany the other ingredients. We both had a good 1/2 cup of \"stuff\" left in the bottom of the bowl which needed the crunch of the romaine to finish. The \"Ranch\" dressing had extra herbs/spices making a really strong flavor that I didn't like, and they don't have \"regular Ranch.\" I asked for Blue Cheese dressing to make up for the lack of it in the salad, and they don't serve that either. The waitress offered Thousand Island (rarely my choice), but it had been doctored up so it didn't taste like the good old-fashioned stuff that's been around for 60 years (didn't even see minced pickles in it, a standard ingredient). Even the cheese dip Patty ordered, with celery for dipping, before I arrived was too strong and tasted off-putting.

I am a Foodie and typically don't mind a modern spin on a Classic dish or additions IF it tastes better, but I left a little hungry and very disappointed in my lunch, so not sure if I'd return to try another entree. 

On a positive note, the vibe and atmosphere were good, with great patio seating, etc. It is a busy, bright, cheery and upbeat place. We also had excellent service from our waitress, Adrianna, where we ate at the bar. So yes, I would go back for drinks at the bar . . ."}
{"text":"Today we ate here with our extended family and it was the first time for all of us. We did have a disappointment as we were planning to have brunch........it was 11:15 AM and we were told by the person who took  our reservations on Friday that the normal Sunday brunch would run on Memorial Day.  Well unfortunately this was incorrect. We only came because of this promise.

Our server did offer some simple breakfast options but unfortunately none were what we wanted. We all ordered lunch. The food was good; we all ordered something different: pastrami sandwich, Asian chicken sandwich, Cobb salad, pasta with bolganse sauce and a hamburger. One of the orders was incorrect and I do appreciate how quickly it was addressed; even the manager apologized. They covered the order that was wrong. I really appreciate restaurants that care for their customers and The Henry did just this. 

I liked my latte and the coffee is delicious. I do feel our server was good and it wasn't her fault that the person taking our reservation gave us wrong information. 

If we come back we will come earlier to have breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Today my husband and I ate at The Henry.  I first came in around 10:30 as the brunch looked amazing, but there was a 45-minute wait, so we came at 4 for a late lunch. We were disappointed the lunch menu was only served till 3, but found items we heard were tasty.  My husband ordered the tortilla soup and added chicken, he also ordered the house salad.  I ordered the turkey dip.  Out of all the places we've ventured to look for a tasty tortilla soup The Henry hit it on the head, very, very good soup.  The house salad is also very good and highly recommended as well.  I was looking forward to trying their club sandwich, but all was made up with the turkey dip as a good second.  The service was more than accommodating, our server was very friendly.  I look forward to trying brunch as well as dinner.  This is definitely a date night place.  Thanks for the outstanding service and great food!"}
{"text":"Tell me why its late and I order a build a burger.  They burnt the burger. I started sweating as soon as i bit into it. Im still hella hungry. Im so mad he f*ckd up that burger"}
{"text":"Located in the Cosmopolitan, The Henry, met my expectations.  The only thing about this place was that everything was on the salty side and of course quite expensive.  I came here with our entire family, party of 12.  We were seated with a little bit of a wait (which was expected).  Our server was great and attentive.  Here's what we ordered:  

$6 for orange juice in martini glasses

Deep fried Mac and cheese is crispy on the outside and cheesy goodness in the inside.  The sauce pairs well with it because it had a little kick.  (definitely should try this)

Tater tots fried in truffle oil- Tater ttos and truffle oil?! Need I say more? 

Henry burger with mushrooms and caramelized onions-  It was really good
 
Braised short rib Benedict-  presentation is awesome and the flavor had a good base but a little salty.

Corn hash and eggs- again salty but overall my family enjoyed it.

Omelette- just a regular omelette

I would come back to dine here for breakfast or lunch.  However, expect to spend a pretty penny.  Everything comes with a nice price tag."}
{"text":"The Henry (like the cosmo) is a great centrally located spot on the strip that never truly  seems 'too' crowded.  We went to the Henry for breakfast twice during our week trip and it was great to chill, relax and enjoy a great cup of coffee (nice large mugs) and orange juice served in martini glasses!

- Short Ribs Benedict has got to be one of the most amazing breakfasts created.... the potato cake, balsamic glaze, poached eggs - AMAZING!"}
{"text":"If I gave 5 stars to establishments, this would be one of them...I live here. Actually, not as much as some do I notice as much as they probably notice me, but this location is indeed the best for business meetings.  Parking can be tight, so I have heard, but have not had a problem.  The coffee bar is a well oiled machine and I am glad because you can usually count on a line although you wait time is minimal.  The breakfast and lunch items are all awesome although I have yet to eat dinner here...This is my second office and while I am sure I will eat here for dinner....I just have not made it a point to eat here.  The wait staff may come off as cold at times, but they are focused...overall, the staff is sharp, busy-busy, and very accommodating.  The meeting rooms they have for groups or events are perfect for business as well.  Number 15 is my number 1!  Bravo FRC...."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants right now. The atmosphere is super cool and the food is amazing. The service is always friendly and professional.  The also brew local coffee which I'm a big fan of. And the pastries are amazing!



8/14/16

****updating review. Still one of my favorite places but service seems to be getting really slow. I understand they are busy but my last 2 visits here, it took almost 10 minutes before the server greeted us and them several minutes before our order was taken. In fact, when we were in today, the server would stop by the table to bring water and immediately turn around and leave before we could ask for apps. If we hadn't been so insistent we wouldn't have gotten apps. To the restaurant this should be alarming. If a customer is ready to spend $, you should be ready to take it 

***btw. Best burger in Phoenix!!!"}
{"text":"Had a date night here. Long wait for a table - staff were apologetic and kept us informed of how much longer we would have to wait. We probably waited at least 30+mins for our table (was a relatively busy night). Server took a drink order so we could sip and wait, as the bar area was full.
Once seated, our server was straight onto taking orders. A quick ask of what was good gleaned some great results.
The food was really good - I can't remember what we had from the menu as this review is some time after we dined there. Their white truffle parmesan fries were really good.
The quality of their food was very fresh, and the service was great. Nice wine list also."}
{"text":"Classy place for breakfast, large portions and many options for unique morning cocktails (should you require a bit of the hair of the dog). I thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast burrito, the crunchy tater tots inside really made the difference."}
{"text":"We came back two days in a row a year later from the first time. It was my boyfriend's, ahem, I mean fiance's birthday, and we go to Vegas, it's just our thing.  I remembered how much I LOVED the short rib benedict and couldn't wait to get at it again.  My fiance ordered the blueberry pancakes like last time and it was as good as he remembered.  But, the short rib benedict fell short, way short for me.  There was barely any meat under those two eggs.  And the eggs were too runny.  I like the yolk runny but the whites need to hold some kind of consistency other than goo.  

We came back the next morning for breakfast and NO I will not have the short ribs again so I went for the corned beef hash.  I've had REAL corned beef hash and I've had canned corned beef hash.  This was somewhere in the middle.  Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but when you're comparing it to something a little better then canned hash it shouldn't cost as much as it did.  Fiance got the plain pancakes this time and again, he loved it.  He even threw in some sausage which he didn't complain about.  

We had mimosas the first morning and coming from San Francisco where brunch is a big thing, we're used to having bottomless mimosas on the menu.  At about $10 a pop our brunch came to well over a $100 for 2.  The 2nd morning he had 1 mimosa and I had a bloody mary.  It was ok; I've had better.

Both times we had the same server.  He was excellent and remembered us from the morning before.  Super efficient and friendly.  He made our stay at the Cosmopolitan more enjoyable."}
{"text":"A big group of us came here for brunch on a Sunday and let me tell you that the food tastes amazing and is very well presented. I love the ambiance of the restaurant and the customer service is great! We will definitely be back next time, we want to try out their dinner menu."}
{"text":"You know this place is good when they cut you off!  This was one of the Best Bloody Mary's in Vegas!!   Came here early for Breakfast almost left in hand cuffs!  Great location, outstanding meals & staff that loves you through good & bad!"}
{"text":"I had walked by here several times without even realizing what it was. Thankfully I finally took the time to check it out. It is in a convenient location on the first floor of Cosmopolitan right in the middle of all the action.

The menu is filled with traditional American food options. It is reasonably priced for Las Vegas. I ordered the French Dip. The portion was normal for a dip. The sandwich was tasty. The horseradish dip had good flavor without being overwhelming. For my side I chose the truffle tater tots. I enjoy tots and truffles so it was an easy choice for me. The tots were solid. The truffle oil gave it that nice extra bit of flavor.

Overall I walked away happy. This is a nice alternative to all the super spendy/trendy options in Cosmo. They have a few breakfast options they serve all day, which is great for those late night meals."}
{"text":"i was really impressed by the henry! came here last night with the team for drinks and dinner - we all really liked the layout of the space and the super high ceilings, the decor, and how theres a coffeeshop! all super duper cute! and because we came on a wednesday - happy hour ran all night in the summer in the bar area as well as outside patio and there's even live music!  we partook in one round of the hh specials - $5 for delicious cocktails and $5-$8 for snacks - hard to beat those prices! and the portions are full size! i love phoenix at hh time!  then we settled for quiet conversation and dinner in the restaurant area - really spacious and really diverse dinner menu. my colleagues went for seafood entrees while i opted for the short rib dumplings - saucy and fatty and delish.  the only downside of the evening was the service - we couldnt get any help timely at the bar, we didnt get plates for a long time after we sat down and had to ask for them twice, didnt get to put in our entrees for a while, etc. etc. but overall - i'd definitely come back for some eats and drinks!"}
{"text":"Our server(David) was outstanding(Feb 18th)....ambience is trendy and fabulous

Food was DELICIOUS!!! Menu is creative and extensive.....everything was PERFECTiON(the server made great suggestions).... Another Fox restaurant WINNER...we can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Great place. Great atmosphere. Excellent food. Be sure to make reservations because it gets busy! Fox Reataurants, you've done it again. Way to go! The Henry is a must-dine in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"We found this restaurant to be just so-so. It was a bit overpriced for what it is. None of our food or drinks were bad, but nothing stood out either. With all the dining options in Vegas, it's a slippery slope when your food is forgettable. 

The ambiance was nice and our server was attentive. However, I doubt we'll go back again."}
{"text":"I am on the strip about 3-4 days a week & I'm always looking for new places to satisfy my random hunger strikes throughout the day. I pass through the cosmopolitan quite often taking notice to The Henry but didn't go in for a while. One day I ventured in & ordered a favorite of mine, the French Dip Sandwich w/ Truffle Tots. I have had these many times at different places in Vegas & also in other states/cities, I have to say this is by far my favorite place to get this delectable treat. I've heard other say it was a bit pricey but I didn't mind that at all. It's Vegas & it's in the Cosmopolitan so I expected that going in

The prime rib was so tender, perfectly cooked & topped with Swiss it seemed to simultaneously melt in my mouth with the bread. Add to that the horseradish sauce & it just took it to another level. The truffle tots were a nice compliment to the sandwich. You can tell they were diced, formed & cooked fresh. Perfectly crisp outside with the heat still trapped inside.

It's safe to say I will be coming back again to repeat this experience & look forward to sampling the rest of The Henry's pallet in future visits"}
{"text":"The food was amazing, and the whole place has a really nice atmosphere. The guacamole was strangely delicious (clementines and pistachios in it!). The handmade chips were delish, though a tad on the greasy side. The pasta bolognese was amazing. 

The wine list was solid. Service was so great - I forget her name, but she was so nice, really knowledgeable and made great recommendation. 

Would definitely go here the next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast, and left full and content.  I ordered the Breakfast Burrito.

The burrito was quite tasty.  It comes with salsa and sour cream on the side.  This burrito tastes really good with the sour cream.  The portion may look small, but it is definitely packed with tons of meat, eggs, and potatoes.  The slightly crisp tortilla enhance the burrito as well.  The only thing I wished for is if the salsa they gave better matched the flavor of the burrito.  I didn't use much of the salsa that was provided on the side."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this breakfast at the Cosmopolitan. They serve a breakfast menu all day, but we went for a more traditional breakfast on Xmas morning. The food was insane good. We had some fresh made beignets, I got a great breakfast burrito, and my lady had a very solid scramble. I wanted to eat more, but with a huge Xmas dinner on the horizon, I thankfully stopped myself. 

The folks next to us got pancakes that looked decadent. There was also some waffly-thing that looked like a million calories of awesome. 

The service staff were super cool (for having to work Xmas morning), and the place was easy to find on the entry level of Cosmo, pretty close the strip entrance. You cannot miss it!

A definitive must-try place for your Vegas calorie replenishment.

ENJOY!!"}
{"text":"The service here is horrible!!!
 Hour to be sat, ten min to get drinks, 30 min to get food!! 

Club sandwich not worth the wait! Not a fan"}
{"text":"Went there for a late breakfast, the place was packed. Had to wait for approximately 15 minutes.  As soon as we were seated, our waiter came up and took our drink order. Abel was very friendly and courteous.  Once our drink order was delivered, he took our orders and that's when the waiting began.  After 30 mins or so, I had to ask Abel how much longer we had to wait.  Our order consist of a toasted croissant, granola parfait and a dish of eggs and bacon.  The granola parfait looked great. Presentation was awesome.  I was informed that it's okay, nothing great about it.  The croissant was huge. I had to share it.  The eggs were regular, but the jalapeño bacon was superb.  If you like bacon, it's a must try.  It was definitely overpriced.  A cup of coffee is $5 and the croissant, $5 as well.  But then again, you are at the Cosmo, it's all about the ambience.  Overall, I give it a 4 star. Will probably go there again."}
{"text":"The Henry is beautiful.  I sat at the bar for mules and apps, but had a nice view of the open kitchen to watch the buzz.  Everything we ordered was incredible, though fairly small portions.  I would recommend saving The Henry for special occasions since it's a little pricey.  The decor is very modern with a clean feel, very inviting and relaxing."}
{"text":"Really liked this place. I kinda had an upset stomach so I didn't eat as much as I normally would. I ordered a side of biscuits and gravy and it was actually like a whole meal. It was so good, smelled wonderful too. My mom got steel cut oatmeal and it came with so many toppings and a huge bowl of oats. She loved it. I also had a glass of fresh squeezed apple juice. For Vegas I actually think the prices were really good. Plan to go back tomorrow when hopefully I'm not sick feeling and I will adjust my rating then."}
{"text":"Decent breakfast. Pancakes were standard. OJ orange was fresh and tasty. Cinnamon roll French toast was quite good. 
Location is a little bit odd being out in the open - right off the lobby across from the casino. Service was slow and wait for food was long.
Tip:  make a reservation on OpenTable and breeze by all the people who put their name in with host."}
{"text":"I went to the henry last friday for dinner i waited 35 minutes for my meal and it was cold they wanted to remake my food again but i didnt want to wait 35 min again ill never go back to the henry"}
{"text":"Great food! The French Toast is enough for 2 people to share. Two large slices of brioche bread is very filling, even with all the berries (blueberries, raspberries and strawberries). After we were done with brunch, I asked our server what was his favorite dish on the menu. He highly recommended the Short Rib Eggs Benedict. We'll be coming back to try that!"}
{"text":"My family and I went to The Henry for dinner last night. It was absolutely amazing! My husband & I split the roasted chicken with grilled asparagus and mac & cheese! It was incredible. Everyone loved their meals & their drinks plus the gorgeous atmosphere. We will absolutely be back! Such a great night!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a lovely breakfast at the Henry in September with the Breakfast Club UYE. 

Our party was 15 strong. 

We originally started out on the patio, but eventually moved inside due to the heat. 

Thank you Seth and Company for taking such great care of us; they absolutely shouldn't have gone this far for us. 

I love the design of this place; from the patio to the interior. Even the bathrooms were carefully thought out! 

Things Dude y yo ordered:

1) Pecan Cinnamon Roll 

. . . Ok, this was mostly to prevent a passed out Meg on the floor. Needed to get my blood sugar back up from a workout. But thanks Dude, Amy and Jon H. for sharing with me!

2) Egg White Turkey Omelette 

Solid post workout option. REAL roasted turkey, much appreciated. Organic egg whites. Healthy amount of avocado, tomatoes and swiss cheese. 

It came with breakfast potatoes and we ordered a side of bacon. SO much food. 

3) Bagel and Lox

Just your typical everything bagel with smoked salmon, cream cheese, tomatoes, capers and onions. 

This thing was PACKED! 

A little pricey for breakfast, but worth every penny.

Excited to go back and try dinner. 

Thanks Monica O. for hosting another awesome UYE, and thanks again to Seth and the Henry for tolerating our shenanigans!"}
{"text":"I had eaten at The Henry not long after the Cosmopolitan opened. It was the final \"party\" of the fabulous wine/food pairing series of events that the hotel offered for free to locals, which were usually held in the now-defunct wine shop on the second floor. I didn't write a review then because I hadn't paid for the meal.

Since we were going to see Opium at Rose. Rabbit. Lie., we decided to have a quick dinner at the restaurant. I'd made a reservation, which turned out to be unnecessary, and the hostess seated me while my husband was parking. The first try was a combination booth/table in a dark corner, and it looked very uncomfortable. Next was a table for two, and it was awful. I should have asked for a larger one, but missed my cue. It was also a half booth, but I was able to look out on the casino instead of a wall. But the table was very uncomfortable: way too long, so we were too far away from each other, but not wide enough.

We ordered two sandwiches, and told our waiter, Claudio, that we were going to share both. I did like that we were able to get salads instead of fries, but the bowls they're served in are pointed on each end, making it difficult to eat. What didn't end up on the table made its home on my brand-new sweater. And yes, I had a napkin on my lap.

Our sandwiches came out quickly. The corned beef reuben had almost no meat, and what was there was almost all fat. The grilled chicken was served on their version of sourdough. I'm not a big fan of sourdough, but this had none of the characteristics of that bread; it seemed like plain old white bread. And it was a mess: hard to eat, with pieces of the very small chicken breast falling out and the bread breaking up. Instead of plates, they serve sandwiches on a slice of paper sitting on a board. This meant that I was literally eating off paper. I don't like to eat from paper. Call me old-fashioned, but I like plates. Either the waiter or the kitchen didn't bother to split the sandwich halves for us, so we had to exchange them across that long divide. Not classy.

We didn't bother to order a replacement, so we made do with the two little side salads and half a sandwich each. At least we weren't charged for the extra salad. The only positive thing I can say is that there was a good amount of avocado along with the measly chicken.

No manager ever came to our table, which I think is a piss-poor way of dealing with customers who send back a food item. The waiter service was perfunctory at best.

I would expect more from the Cosmopolitan. This was a huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Love the Henry! Great Summer happy hour specials and great service. Cute spot to hang out with the girlfriends"}
{"text":"This is the regular cafe (albeit upscale) for the Cosmopolitan. Tried it out for breakfast when staying at the Cosmo. The food was very good but typical of a nice hotel restaurant, but the service was outstanding.  Everyone called me by name.  Overall, would recommend it for breakfast. Not sure about other meals."}
{"text":"Short rib benedict at 7am is possibly one of the best breakfast I have had after drinking. The meat in the rich and bold sauce was braised nicely and on top are perfectly cooked eggs covered in hollandaise. Awesome way to end the night/start the day. This is an awesome dinner and breakfast in one."}
{"text":"We just went here for a post graduation dinner this week.  My daughter and I had come for brunch before, and have been wanting to come back for dinner for some time now.  I have to say that dinner did not disappoint!

We started with wine and drinks.  I got an apricot blossom punch that was delicious...enough to have two.  The others in the party stuck with traditional drinks and wine (good varieties there).  We also started the meal with garlic fries an popover rolls, both of which were nice starters.

Our entrees were also delicious, from the braised short rib (mine!), to the  korean style steak, to the chicken, and the fish.  All our meats were prepared very well - great flavor, tender, cooked just right - and the sides were equally delicious and well paired with the entrees.  We didn't save room for dessert, but thoroughly enjoyed all that we tried.

Service was good, friendly and appropriately attentive given how busy they were.  We sat outside on the patio...also very pleasant.  Nice spot, good menu, all around excellent."}
{"text":"So, let me say I think this is a great place for drinks with friends.  If you want a superb dinner with excellent food, start at the Henry and move on to one of the terrific restaurants in the Arcadia corridor.  My friend and I ordered the cheddar popovers and were disappointed as there were was hardly a trace of cheddar.  For my entree I had the Mediterranean Branzino.  It was tasty, however I found it a tad too buttery (if that's possible) and thought it a bit rich.  Worth $28?  Nah, don't think so.  For dessert we had a peanut butter banana concoction which was good.  I had a mixed cocktail and it was really great and my friend ordered the Riesling which she loved.   I do love the ambience with the bakery/cafe in the front and the booth we sat at was comfortable and spacious.  Again, wonderful place for a happy hour, or as some other reviewers have had great experiences with brunch, maybe that's an option. I would go back with friends for a few cocktails, but leave the food to another place."}
{"text":"This place is inside the Cosmopolitan and get there early. There's a wait on Saturday morning when we came here. Huge servings for their meal."}
{"text":"We came here because a friend recommended The Henry for the whiskey selection and food. My husband & I were not disappointed.

We arrived around 4 thinking we would have a cocktail or two and ended up staying thru dinner.

The bartenders Teddy and Jeremy were outstanding. My husband enjoyed talking to Teddy about different whiskeys and he recommended a couple that he tried. The bonus was the Pappy that they had, that my husband has been looking for for months in the Bay Area. Also recommended were the popovers which were very yummy. The smoked ham butter was amazing. We ended up ordering the chopped salad, club sandwich and a side of the cauliflower polenta. All were served quickly and enjoyed to the fullest. Ending our meal with the bread pudding, served warm with a scoop of carmel ice cream that was delicious.
I also want to note the open feel of the restaurant, where you are able to sit outside, at casual tables, at the bar or in the dining room.
I'd recommend this restaurant to everyone to try. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Fantastic French dip sandwich. Burger was really good too.  Mixed green salad was fantastic, right mixture of flavors. If you're looking for a restaurant on the strip and you don't want to spend too much, don't think twice."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is probably the very best part of The Henry. It is very eclectic & energized, and the staff are always incredibly helpful & friendly. Their popovers are easily my favorite thing there- they are so light, but also decadent! I also love that they're served with herb & ham butters, which are both great! I've found the salads to be a little hit or miss in terms of how much I like them, but they change the menu fairly frequently so there always seems to be new things to try! I really enjoy the vegetarian quinoa tacos, and \"le pig\" on their brunch menu is very tasty! You also can't go wrong with their cheeseburger- very good! 

I would also recommend grabbing a cocktail at their bar! It's very charming, and they have an excellent selection of drinks (wine, spirits, and beers!)"}
{"text":"YUM 24/7! I love coming in for any meal, but more frequently breakfast! Their iced coffee is simply amazing!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place has such poor reviews. I had a great experience here. This brunch place is located inside the cosmopolitan and there are plenty of seating inside. For a party of 5, we waited around 20 minutes to be seated, which is reasonable. 

We were seated at one of those half circle tables which fit 5 comfortably. The service was very prompt and the waitress took our drink orders right away. They had illy coffee which was strong and delicious. I ordered the breakfast burger which was massive and it came with truffle tater tots. For $19 I think it was worth it because you could have split it with another person. The pickles that came with the burgers were amazing I even asked for extras haha. My boyfriend got the brisket Benedict which he loved. It was covered in this sweet brown gravy and the hollandaise sauce had a tart finish to it. He said it brought out the flavor of the meat very well. The only thing he would change was have more hashbrown as the base. 

They provided excellent service by giving us ketchup and hot sauce and a variety of jam up front without us having to ask for it. Also they refilled the water glasses plenty of times. They were also agreeable to splitting our tab for us."}
{"text":"Love Fox Concept restaurants! Love this enviornment that they have at The Henry! The decor is awesome and it makes me feel like I time-traveled a little. The patio is beautiful and the food is great! My favorite dish is the Korean Style Skirt Steak, except I substitute the fried rice for their cauliflower polenta which is AMAZINGGGG! I got the beef short ribs and mashed potatoes last night, and I will admit I wasn't a fan of the glaze only because it tasted like maple syrup to me. Great dish though! The clubhouse margarita is delicious, as well as the fig and ginger mule. Get the sweet potato semi-freddo for dessert. Only downside is the portions are small!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I had the best iced coffee that I have ever had here. Had a very tasty brunch here this morning. I had a breakfast sandwich which was delicious. The decor and details in this restaurant are just incredible. Love this place."}
{"text":"Had 3 different items for breakfast. And all were awesome.
Get the Brisket or Huevos, no disappointments."}
{"text":"The Henry is another home run for Fox Restaurant concepts. The extensive drink menu has an amazing selection of brown liquors and interesting concoctions. There is attention to detail in everything from decor to seasoning in the food  which makes this an amazing place to dine and drink.

Coffee this morning was flavorful and robust. The espresso beans didn't have an overpowering roast, but it will definitely wake you up in the morning.

I HIGHLY recommend the CB and Rye for lunch, as it is some of the most perfectly balanced, not too salty corned beef I've found. It keeps a meaty texture while still being incredibly juicy and tender. Excellent!

Bar menu can't be overstated. The cocktails were interesting and worth the price, and as a beer connoisseur, I appreciated that the only thing \"common\" on tap was Stella (4 Taps with rotating seasonal). The bottled beer selection showed sophistication and makes this a great place for a business happy hour.

The Henry would absolutely be 5 stars if it weren't for one big ambiance hindrance at a busy lunch -- it is INCREDIBLY loud in the restaurant. I heard about every 3rd word my server was saying and ended up a bit hoarse from talking so loudly to the people in my booth. If you're heading to the Henry at lunch time for a meeting, be sure arrange in advance and to ask for one of the more secluded meeting tables."}
{"text":"The general manager is a very pleasant person and runs an excellent operation, we recognized her from Blancos as I believe she was the GM there.  The food at the Henry is excellent, the atmosphere is classic, quaint, and the service is top notch!!  I do appreciate the Fox restaurants concepts they are all excellent."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon The Henry accidentally when looking for somewhere to eat at the Cosmo and I'm so glad we did. The drinks were beautiful, the atmosphere was comfortable and spacious and you definitely feel a classier Vegas vibe here. 

We ordered the tater tots and burratta crostini for the table as appetizers- the burratta was great. I also got the tomato soup which I LOVED! The cheese and pesto were a great addition and it was served in a cute cup. For my main meal I had the salad with grilled shrimp and it was HUGE! They gave you a ton of shrimp. 

Overall the service and atmosphere were both great and most importantly no one could complain about the food. Definitely make reservations here if you're at the Cosmo or in the area!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately this trip wasn't better than the last - if  possibly worse.

Boyfriend and friends hadn't been here yet and wanted to have a visit and a nice dinner. I was reluctant but I knew I needed to get back here for them to redeem themselves from my last visit. 

I love their patio. It was great to have the opportunity to enjoy it on a nice night. Our server came over to us immediately and took our drink orders which was nice. One of our friends took a bit longer to decide what she wanted so you would think that he would grab the 3 other drinks and check back in a few....well 20 minutes later he came back and took her drink order and 10 minutes after that we all got our drinks - just the three of us...After we got our drinks, he tried to go do something else but we had to tell him that we wanted to order apps -I mean we had 30 minutes at this point to look over the menu. When our apps came out is when the last of us got our drinks. That was my first annoyance of the night. By the way, we didn't have silverware or napkins and had to ask someone else for them. When this random brought it over, he brought over 4 sets of silverware with one napkin....I had to get up and go get the napkins for the rest of the table.

We ordered the chicken and the egg app and our friends had the artichoke app. Normally, I don't like huge portions and actually love small plates but this appetizer was so small! There were two small bites of chicken, probably a quarter of a cup of stuffing and the egg. What makes me so mad is that I loved it! It tasted great but it drives me up a wall when you pay a decent amount for a small amount of food -and don't get me wrong, I am all about quality over quantity, but this was pushing it for me. Our friends enjoyed their dish but had the same complaint.

For my entree I had the Korean skirt steak with fried rice and green beans. Boyfriend had the pork chop, friend 1 had the peanut covered bass and friend 2 had one of the veggie dishes which I can't remember. The portions sizes on this were perfect and everyone enjoyed the food. It was really good. The fish tasted too fishy to me but friend 1 loved it so don't worry about that.

Since the portions were large, we had some leftovers and asked for them to be boxed up and in the meantime to receive the bill. Well we certainly received the bill but waited for a while for our leftovers.....that never came! They threw out our leftovers. I know shit happens but it was just icing on the cake for me. I asked to talk to a manager and he was very sweet and offered to cook us up more food, but at 8pm on a Sunday, you want to be able to fall into food coma, not wait longer. I appreciated him offering us more food but my intention wasn't to get anything for free, just to let him know the issues with the service and he took them kindly. 

I think its really hard to go and spend $90 per couple (beer and wine included in that price) and have service like that. I know they are knew, I know there are kinks, but in my mind, a Fox Concepts restaurant that has a million places already going and successful should have service kinks like that worked out. 

Since the entrees were good, boyfriend really wants to return. Again I am reluctant to go back for a while but we shall see. I really want to like this place - everywhere else in Arcadia is awesome."}
{"text":"They don't have the corned beef hash anymore?! The Cosmo used to have it on their room service menu, but they took it off. So I would go to The Henry to get my fix. My friend loved the short rib benedict, and their truffle tots are so good. Sadly I will not be eating here anymore."}
{"text":"This is a great place to eat had the Henry egg breakfast very great for sure are coming here again Service. Was awesome very very nice place to get a bite to eat"}
{"text":"The wife and I went to eat here after we got a comp.  A quick scan of yelp and I had to try the short rib benedict.  The braised short rib is so tender with a great sauce on it.  The egg was cooked perfectly so that the yolk oozes out when you cut into it.  Then there are some potatoes on the bottom soaking up all the egg yolk and short rib juice.... yum!  My only complaint is that there is no bread that comes with the benedict.  I mean, can it be a benedict without some kind of bread?  

The wife got an egg white omelette which she says was very good.  One of my other complaints about this place was that they brought us lukewarm coffee.  That is a big no no in my book.  

I would recommend ths place based on the short rib benedict alone."}
{"text":"The Henry has amazing potential to be a great Brunch spot, but falls very short. The host staff were very polite and friendly but tremendously overwhelmed. There was a very small group waiting for tables and half the restaurant was empty. We ordered each type of Bloody Mary, which were the highlights of our meals. I ordered traditional eggs Benedict with no meat and my husband ordered short rib Benedict. His was \"pretty good\", but nothing amazing. I received two over-toasted English muffins with decently poached eggs and very bland hollandaise sauce (super, duper bland). Nothing else. Literally a large white plate with just that in the middle for $17. The menu was also very unclear what each menu item also included. Our waiter commented that the options were very inconsistent, though he was able to articulate the differences well and answer my question.  This place could be so much greater. They seem to have great staff and clearly have a potential market. The food just wasn't worth the price or wait.  They also need better front of he house management."}
{"text":"Their breakfast meals are fantastic.  The baked goods amazing.  The staff are all super friendly and helpful and attentive.    

Ambience is off the chart.  Great design and layout... awesome music.

I only wish I liked their coffee. :(   It is dark roast only.... and bitter.   And they just raised the price of a cup to a ridiculous $3+ after taxes.   They should have two blends available like most of the other coffee places in town... a dark bitter mud roast... and a lighter blend."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere.  Good food but not always able to get a seat.  So get there early or make a reservation"}
{"text":"Soooo good! The Henry has the all american brunch done very well.
I had the chicken fried steak. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! The entree was layered with hash browns on the bottom, chicken fried steak, rosemary brown gravy, and topped with eggs. The portion was HUGE!
My husband had the western omelette, it was equally delicious. I can't think of a place I have had a better omelette. The entree came with the omelette stuffed with onions, mushrooms, chunks of ham, also hash browns and toast. 
Very good service on a busy Sunday."}
{"text":"This hit the spot on all levels! From the fresh squeezed juice and fluffy omelette to Ray treating us like royalty... it's a little slice of heaven in the desert! Great time and I'll be back tomorrow"}
{"text":"Sooo good this will be my new go to for the late night munchies definitely recommend. I like that it's across the bar Bond so it's lively."}
{"text":"Good: smoked salmon avocado toast, champagne supernova drink, Bloody Mary and the beignets. 

Meh: Breakfast burrito and pancakes."}
{"text":"Our third time around and have never been disappointed. My \"Mule\" drink was superb, a great choice for the heat of summer. My olive oil poached sea bass and my wife's branzino were done to perfection. The smoked Norwegian salmon appetizer on crispy potato cakes was delectable and the portion was quite generous! We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Management followed up to correct the situation, which at least shows good customer service!"}
{"text":"Went with friends to The Henry for coffee and dessert. We were seated promptly, but not attended to by any waiters or staff (plenty passed by) for 15 minutes. Once a waiter did come (I don't think it was even his table) we told him we actually needed dessert menus instead of the dinner menu. While he did bring us waters and new menus, he did not return to take our orders within the ten minutes more that we waited. The plan was to tell a staff member about how bad the service was, but there was no one to be found. 

We were extremely disappointed and decided to leave."}
{"text":"It's ok. Nothing special. Food is AOK. And service is AOK. (The hostess are really sweet and hospitable though! One girl read me their whole menu on the phone!)

One tip: DO NOT ORDER THE CHICKEN POT PIE! Marie Callendar's and even frozen foods I have eaten do it better.

It's the same food/kitchen as room service at the Cosmo. Here are a couple of additional things to know about that.  The price varies from the room to the restaurant by a few bucks and you'd be surprised to know that the prices are not necessarily cheaper at the restaurant than room service."}
{"text":"This Henry will literally serve you at any seat in there establishment. We had neglected making reservations and called while we were on our way. They told us they would be able to find room. When we got there the place was hopping and they explained that we could sit outside, in the lobby, or at a high top in the bar. We sat outside and a server arrived promptly to take our drink and appetizer order (the cheddar popovers and a beer). I order the C. B. & Rye. It had a large portion of corn beef and the rye was nice and crispy. The cabbage and onions balanced the while thing out.

Overall, the service and food were excellent. We would love to come back and experience the indoor ambiance. This was a great place to celebrate our anniversary. I would recommend it."}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've ever had. I customize my own burger and requested it to be served medium at it was perfect. The service was wonderful and the place was very clean and nice. It's also open 24 hours which is a big bonus for Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Don't let the aesthetically pleasing food fool you. They food looked fantastic, but everything came out fairly cold except the pretzels.
The Henry burger that was recommended came out cold. It was cooked to order in color. The bun was supposedly a brioche bun that was dry and hard.
The truffle tots were tasty, but cold as well.
French Onion Soup was tasty but cold as well. 
You'd think that the food would be fresh and hot being that there were only 3 customers total.
Even if you're drunk, save yourself the disappointment.
2 stars for the food aesthetics.
-3 stars for food temperature and poor service."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast.  A bit pricey for what it is but the California club omelette hit the spot."}
{"text":"I've been here for breakfast/ brunch on Sundays but never for dinner. Probably one of the best Cesar salads I've had. It came with Brussel sprouts which made it even better. Also their Mac and cheese was amazing as well. Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"We met friends from out of town at The Henry for breakfast.  The service was exceptional, but the food?  Over the top delicious.   We ordered eggs Benedict x 2, an egg white omelette, ham hock hash with poached eggs and a breakfast burrito.  It was all amazing.  The coffee tastes like coffee which was strong and hot.  We had an awesome dining experience here."}
{"text":"Yes Yes Yes! Everything about this place is fabulous! 
The vibe, the food, the drinks. It's all top 5.
I've been here for Breakfast, Brunch and Lunch and if I lived in the Phoenix, Scottsdale area I would practically live here in the mornings and on weekends. 
You can really tell they put TLC into their food.
The only little tiny flaw is their service. All sweet people but quite slow.
I say it's worth the snail pace. What's the rush anyways!?
xoxo"}
{"text":"I went to the Henry to celebrate my birthday with my husband and it was *amazing.* Everything dish was better than the last. We started with cocktails, and I had \"Wake the Angels,\" which had gin, sparkling wine, yuzu, grapefruit, and rose petals. Amazing. For my entree I had braised short ribs, which was so tender and succulent, and perfectly accented with mushrooms, bourbon caramel, and mashed potatoes and a touch of blue cheese. Dessert was a delicious chocolate peanut butter molten cake with banana gelato. Aside from the amazing food, the service was warm and friendly, and The Henry was beautifully decorated and had a nice, relaxing vibe. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was my second time here. The first time I went in for dinner when it first opened. It was packed and we ended up sitting at the bar. I ordered the only vegetarian entree at the time and the cheddar popovers. The ambiance, service, drinks, and food were A-OK that night. Fast-forward to a year and a half later, the place was still completely packed but for breakfast on a Wednesday! Luckily I ordered ahead for pick-up. I could not find any parking, which seems to always be an issue (the reason for the 4 stars). As I drove away, I told myself I would not be back due to the craziness of people in there and the no parking situation. However, as I get back to my office and take one bite of the Quinoa Breakfast Burrito and a sip of my Iced Wildflower coffee, I change my mind immediately. This was the best burrito of my life! It didn't need the salsa that came with it and it was big enough where I only needed to eat half of it to be satisfied. I'll deal with parking any day to have such a tasty breakfast!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting forever to eat here! Only disappointment was not coming sooner and trying a variety of the.menu. It wasn't super busy or packed on a Saturday. We ate and drank at the bar. I couldn't decide what to order so i winged it with Tuna Poke Bowl and my handsome date ordered chicken fried chicken. OMG!!! So freaking good and light. Service was awesome especially since my Bartender was from Buffalo. I can't wait to go back and try the brunch there ASAP."}
{"text":"Nothing special.  A bit overpriced for what you are getting, but what do you expect at a restaurant on the strip?

Tater tots were okay, but I've had better.  Beet salad was a winner."}
{"text":"Open 24/7, The Henry is always a great option for casual dining (plus full bar of course), especially when a guest at The Cosmo. It's very convenient, the staff is friendly (albeit never in much of a rush), the food is consistent, the variety is vast, and you can get the Breakfast Plate anytime - score! 

The prices are reasonable for the Vegas Strip and people watching is free. The Henry is completely open concept and located at the very end of the casino, so there's not a bad seat in the house so-to-speak. Depending on the time, you can see talent dancing on top of the casino bars under disco balls or just watch the delightfully intoxicated folks stumble in off The Strip. 

Bottom-line: A very good option when in need/desire of some sustenance and a Secret Pizza slice just won't cut it. ;)

Recommend bang for the buck$: Breakfast plate and they do a Burger quite well. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials and meals are some of the best that the fox restaurant group shells out. Parking is limited though. Great place, servers attentive and food excellent ( so are desserts!)"}
{"text":"This place sucks.

1) You'll find the food passable if you're used to dining at Sizzler-level establishments. Otherwise, gross.

2) Hate getting stuck under drafty AC vents at restaurants? When you sit down at The Henry, look up. You'll notice that nearly every table is below a vent. Really?

3) Our original server was a jackass. We waited 20+ minutes for him when we first sat down until another employee eventually told us he was taking a 'longer-than-usual break.' After a few more minutes of complete confusion/idiocy from the waitstaff, a combination of no less than 3 members of their team just ended up serving us. 

You'd think this would be okay until you realize no one can figure out who the hell is responsible for the various tasks that make a meal out (refilling drinks, taking orders, actually serving the food, etc.) with a setup like this.

Oh yeah, our original server eventually returned as well (pointed out by other staff members). Too bad he ended up looking down at the floor each time I glared at him, scurrying away from our vicinity with the utmost of urgency.

Last nail in the coffin - our table's order was relatively small since the group was only composed of myself and two females who don't necessarily have the biggest appetites (total order was something like 2 coffees, an OJ, 2 breakfast sandwiches, tots side, and a corned beef hash). 

Final bill? ~$150. 

If you do the math, that means it cost about 66% more to eat at The Henry than at Wicked Spoon, which runs around $30 per person after taxes. I have my own issues with WS, but unless you like to go to restaurants to pay and not eat food, there's a clear winner here."}
{"text":"Super disappointed at the level of service here.  There are only 2 other tables here and the waiter took over 10 mins to get to us.  Then because most of us only ordered drinks, the waiter tells us that \"this is a restaurant, you need to order food, but I'll let you guys get away with it this time\".  Then he proceeds to take away all the napkins although the kids did order food."}
{"text":"After arriving in Las Vegas, I was absolutely famished and didn't want to travel far for breakfast.  The Henry has a prime location at the Cosmo -- which happened to be where I was staying -- and fit the bill nicely.  

Almost every hotel-casino in Vegas has at least one 24-hour diner-type restaurant, The Henry is Cosmo's version.  And since it's the Cosmo, it's shiny and gorgeous to look at, with abundant chandeliers and glittery surfaces (natch).  It's located right off the casino floor, across from the Bond bar. (Watch your head, since selfie stick-wielding tourists are everywhere.  I may or may not have been smacked by one.)  

The place was quite busy on a Friday morning, but there was plenty of room at the bar, where the full menu is available.  

I ordered a whole grain waffle with a side of chicken apple sausage.  The waffle was extremely delicious and even somewhat healthy, thanks to the abundant yogurt and fresh strawberries.  Unfortunately, the chicken apple sausage wasn't nearly as good -- it tasted slimy, like it had been sitting in the fridge for too long.

I washed down my breakfast with a much-needed cappucino, which was quite tasty.  I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but getting through a day on the Las Vegas Strip always seems to require that extra jolt of energy.

Another plus about The Henry: very friendly staff.  I've found that most Strip restaurants have a cold or stand-offish staff with major chips on their shoulders, but not here.  They make their customers feel at home.  That's reason enough to come back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I came to try this place out. The place is nice. The decors, couches and the set up is alluring but I didn't like how we were welcomed by the restaurant hostesses. They all looked at us like we're lost or something. They we're not approachable. When we sat down, our server came and introduced his self, we became comfortable, he was nice and friendly. We ordered the truffle fries, popover and the corn beef sandwich and salad. The food was great, the fries were delicious, we asked for more truffle sauce. The popover was ok, we expected it to be more sharp flavor. The sandwich was good but it was too meaty. I wish it has sauerkraut in it. The kale and apple salad was good. I love the sweetness and the crunchiness to it. After dinner my friend and I decided to order the croissant bread pudding, we paired it with their latte. I think The Cleo (latte) complements the bread pudding. I love it!"}
{"text":"A popular place for brunch! The Henry was bustling with patrons both outside and inside on this sunny warm Sunday. The patio outside looks to be dog friendly as there were quite a few cute pups lounging with their humans in the shady areas. 

The interior is casual and contemporary, with comfortable seats and nice tables. The menu consists of amped up versions of your standard breakfast favorites such as omelets and pancakes. I went with the Flower Child scramble ($11). The eggs were soft and a good consistency, and the vegetables plentiful and perfectly cooked. One of the vegetables (The asparagus I think) had a deep smoky flavor that was a unexpected but welcome addition to the omelet. The dish was served with some potatoes that were lightly crispy and perfectly seasoned. 

It can get a bit noisy in the restaurant so it's not the best place to go if you want a more intimate quiet setting but for a lively Sunday brunch this is a great choice if you want to dine in the Arcadia area."}
{"text":"Just had my first meal here and I'm already planning my next visit!

What a great addition to the Arcadia area.  The atmosphere is stellar, very big and open, trendy but not over the top.  They were completely booked and we had no reservation but luckily we found two spots in the bar area and were able to order right away.  We decided to share a few things since deciding on one item seemed impossible.  We got the popovers with ham butter (YUP it's a real thing), grilled artichoke hearts, and salmon salad.  We ate every drop of food and were so satisfied - seriously, I'm coming back ASAP to try more things on the menu.  

A++ Henry!"}
{"text":"The Henry is located at the Cosmopolitan just off the casino floor.

I headed over there for breakfast and ordered their Signature Short Rib Benedict* $19 braised short ribs, soft poached eggs, breakfast potato, hollandaise sauce.  When it arrived, I was a little surprised to see that the breakfast potato patties had taken the place traditionally occupied by toasted english muffins.  Well, I have definitely been over carbing on this trip, so I didn't really mind the loss of the bread, but texture, that I did mind.  Soft eggs, generous tender slices of short rib, stacked over browned soft potato cakes - you did not need teeth to eat this.  The crispy part of the potato could not withstand the drenching of gravy and sauce for long.  The flavor was good, but there was not a whole lot to bite into.

Service was pleasant.  But the bathroom is located out in the casino."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful!! The food is awesome and the service is really great! The server Nicks recommendations on the wine list were amazing. Will totally be back again!"}
{"text":"The Henry does it right!  I have been several times and I have always had a great experience!  The staff is on top of their game and has provided me with top notch service every time I have been here.  The food is excellent - the pork chop is probably one of the best that I have had.  Prices are reasonable for the quality of food that you're served.  The ambiance in the restaurant is nice.  I highly recommend this spot!"}
{"text":"Bryan was our bar tender/server. Top notch customer service, drinks were excellent and food was really good for being late at night. Usually at this hour food quality and service lacks but not in this case. Would come here again for cocktails and food. Thanks again for the tier one service."}
{"text":"We have had Sunday Brunch here twice now and it is a fun and delicious experience! Busy place so have a reservation or arrive early. The \"Pig\" sandwich is terrific, fluffy scrambled eggs ham and cheese on a croissant. All of the baked goods and parties are very good. Great service both times we were here.

Cyclists tip, they have a great back room for your cycling group to use if you arrive early and hungry from a hard ride."}
{"text":"Friendly service but super unimpressed with the food for the price. Went for breakfast and the best thing about it was my 5 dollar regular coffee. I got the all natural omlet which was ok, then I got a side of chicken apple sausage which tasted kind of bland... My friend got the the same dish but with the potato and toast instead, I must say the best part about the dish was tasting her potato. The check came and it was 60 bux not including tip, I don't mind dropping money on a good meal but for some bland breakfast it just was not worth it. Service was good."}
{"text":"I'm sad to give this place 3 stars.. The first visit I would of given it 5/5, but over time the service has really lacked. Two weeks ago we went for dessert and coffee after dinner, let's just say we waited 45 minutes (and it wasn't overly busy). After 45 minutes we grabbed our waitress and told her we would be leaving.. The dessert never came :/ 
Accidents happen but we were disappointments how it was handled. Other than that, the food selection is small but items are good. The pork chop & fried chicken are two greats"}
{"text":"Food was good. I got the burrito which has the tater tots in it, not on the side. Husband got scramble. Was fair. Overall,
Not a place I would seek out but when the EggSlut line is too long, fair second choice. Jarvand was our server and he was really great."}
{"text":"I knocked a star off for the noise level. The food was fantastic and the service was great. Looked like a hot spot for young people."}
{"text":"This place is POSH- very cool and trendy at the time. Gotta love it. 

Food was great, kind of expensive, but definitely tasty and well worth it."}
{"text":"After reading other reviews I wonder if we are all eating at the same place?

Went for lunch and the food was awesome, my husband had the Rueben, the corned beef was wonderful! He raved about his sandwich and we both loved the truffled tater tots, so yummy you don't even need to dip them in anything! 

I had the Lobster club, I really enjoyed it, topped with avocado and bacon it tasted wonderful, I get full fast for I removed the middle layer of bread.

The decor reminds me of an old school gentlemen's club, deep wood tones and leather very rich feeling, pricing is about what you would find on the Strip

Another plus real fresh squeezed orange juice yummy!

Will be dining at The Henry again for sure!"}
{"text":"Was able to accommodate a large group walk in (9 people) on a Friday afternoon. Sasha was our waitress and she was a gem, seriously so great. I highly recommend the kale and parm dip (appetizer) and any of the light plates: poke bowl, turkey French dip, or tacos were all great. Not to mention the cute atmosphere and decor! Would love to go back."}
{"text":"We came here at 2 am for a late dinner after catching a show & grabbing a couple drinks- it was the perfect spot to take a breather from partying - detached enough to relax a bit but close enough that you can still ppl watch & don't lose your momentum. 

We both ordered the steak & eggs & it was DELICIOUS. The steak was well seasoned & cooked to a perfect medium rare. Over easy eggs & thick pieces of toast were the perfect companions. One misstep would be the potato hockey puck think - salty & overcooked."}
{"text":"Happy hour at the Henry is always a good choice- especially in April on the patio. HH short menu is only served at the bar, high tops and outside on the patio. Highlight items: guacamole- they have a fresh take with corn and tangerine mixed in with chunks of avocado and cheese. The chips are oversized and crispy; it's a great shareable item. The shrimp dish is well seasoned and comes in a quantity of four. Served with cocktail sauce and a spicy, mayo-based but well flavored sauce. We also ordered a toast that had artichoke spread on it- very tasty right out of the gate, but don't let it sit without eating it for too long. As for cocktails, they offer $6 happy hour wine pours and have a good selection! Angeline Sauv Blanc is one of my favorites and is on HH. They also offer a beer list, if that's your game. My company also ordered an Old Fashion, which looked amazing. Service was just decent, but I'll always come back.  Came back for brunch- wow, the California bowl is incredible!! Potatoes are cooked perfectly.. eggs, bacon, salsa, cheese- it's truly perfect!! Loved the hibiscus mimosas as well  will be back for another patio brunch very soon!

Went in for lunch with my manager this week, and we had an amazing experience! The dumpling appetizer comes with 6 pieces, and is the perfect way to start a meal. They're tender and seasoned well and are sitting in a delicious sauce. I ordered the tuna poki bowl, and I loved it. The sticky rice is well paired with the fish and other ingredients. My manager ordered a salad with brussel sprouts- we shared the sprouts, and they were next level!! As for coffee- do not pass up the Wildflower!!! Wow- can't believe I've gone this long without trying it! They use vanilla and chai to make this coffee such a treat!"}
{"text":"Amazing high end vibe!  Great late at night faces Bond bar so people watching is epic!  It is a high end eatery.  Dress well, spend well.  I cannot say enough about the steak and eggs nor Bloody Mark with Goose.  Delightful!"}
{"text":"Fancy restaurant that serves mediocre food. 

I will probably never want to have lunch here. Ever."}
{"text":"what a relief from china poblano.

the food here is actually generous in portion.  ger-ger and i split a grilled shrimp caesar salad. it was delicious.  

for dinner i had the french dip.  it was fantastic.  very yummy.  ger-ger had the chicken salad wrap.  we both opted for the truffle tater tots.  yummy!

the bill was $50.  not bad for an upscale place in las vegas.  service was excellent.  would come back for good ol' american comfort food."}
{"text":"Yea! This place is very Scottsdale but I've loved everything on the menu I've tried salads sandwhiches and the coffee. The pastries look delicious"}
{"text":"I was drunk but I remember that the french toast was fabulous soft sweet pillows of french toasty-ness & this place is open 24/7 like everything else in Vegas. I enjoyed the french toast and truffle tater tots so much that I ended up falling asleep at the table."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place because it is a Sam Fox restaurant and has a hip vibe, but after three visits I am lukewarm at best. Every dish always seems a little disappointing compared to how it is described on the menu. The servers all seem dopey. Maybe they hire too many millennials that think they are providing good service between being obsessed with their phones."}
{"text":"The Henry is conveniently located at the North/East entrance of the Cosmopolitan in front of a flashy bar with crystals glistening with pink lights in the center.  It was elegantly decorated and reminded me of Henri Bendels.  The chairs looked uncomfortable to sit in but they weren't. 

The food was awesome!  We ordered crab cakes, french onion soup, Belgium waffles and omelette made to order with my choice of tomatoes, ham and onions.  The Maryland Blue crab cake came with one circular cake but full of real crab meat and just enough pommery dressing on top.  The French onion soup came out very hot and steamy, just the way I like it, with a lot of cheese on top!  It was awesome.  The broth had a lot of flavor with cooked onions.  The omelette wasn't that great because the egg was overdone and I didn't order the best ingredients to go in the omelette.  Overall, the location, the vibe, the decorations and food was FOUR star worthy in a FIVE star worthy hotel."}
{"text":"Pricey breakfast in the Cosmo. Cinnamon roll french toast for $17 was just okay. Definitely don't save it for later. The servers are nice, though the service is slow. Bring a jacket because it's cold af."}
{"text":"We had just checked in at Cosmo and needed to grab food.  Came to check out this menu and decided their burgers looked good based on description.   My other friends got burgers but I went with the French Dip after reading some reviews on here.  I wouldn't say I am a fan of French Dips but just kinda wanted to try something different.  It was really solid!!  Tender meat and the bread was really good.  I loved their their au jus was perfectly flavored.  I find most to be too salty.  The Henry got this right. 

Their truffle tater tots are the business!!!  So delicious!!  Really!  Get them and skip the fries.  C'mon, you can get fries anywhere! 

Our server was extremely attentive and checked on us consistently.  

An added plus was that we sat near the walkway of entrance where they had fun dancers getting down to some top 40 tunes.  Cute choreography.  

Overall, a nice and tucked away place to grab some good food!"}
{"text":"I visited several times during my stay at Cosmo. Faster and better than room service as they're open 24/7. Pro tip - they also take to-go orders!

Also, the first night I had a bartender who recognized I was battling a cold and made me a couple perfect Hot Toddies that chased the sick away! 

They were also happy to adjust the menu to meet my vege restrictions."}
{"text":"I only had the granola here but WOW!

Probably the best granola I have ever had and they didn't charge me extra for soy milk instead of the Greek yogurt.  I got it To-Go but I would not mind coming here to dine in and get it again.  It looked pretty packed, but being inside the Cosmo, I would expect nothing less.

The prices are not super pricey either, which is great.  Definitely stop by! Lots of options to choose from :)"}
{"text":"Overall a good atmosphere, good food, and a short wait during peak Sunday brunch time. 

I ordered the All Natural Omelet. A bit skeptical about the egg white omelet, I did so with apprehension. However, the omelet was fluffy and well composed and came out looking like a work of art. The mushrooms and asparagus inside were very flavorful, as well. The tomato plum coulis added a very wonderfully unique taste to a traditional omelet--I couldn't get enough of it!  Once I added a bit of salt (which I never use) to the omelet, everything tasted A+. 

Although, the much-hyped truffle tater tots under-delivered, as I could not taste any truffle. Overall a pleasant experience that I would recommend to others."}
{"text":"We had quite a nice evening there, all things considered.

We booked through Open Table and were seated at a nice booth inside, but then quickly realized Happy Hour is only served in the bar, lounge and outside on the patio. Being a nice night, we asked to be moved outside and I'm sure glad we did. Not only did we get to take advantage of their delicious happy hour and prices, but my son wasn't feeling so well and the outside was much better for our needs. They had heat lamps and the ambiance was really nice and quiet.

The happy hour runs 3-6pm, M-F. They have about 6 cocktails, some beers and some wines in addition to about 8 appetizers and even a burger ranging from $5-$8. We ordered a few appetizers, but would've passed on them both (truffle parm fries were fine, but I'd have preferred them plain + the cheese and cauliflower spread-- not my jam. I love all the components, but it just didn't impress as we'd hoped).

What did impress was my cocktail. I had the fig and ginger mule and it was delish. For $5, it was definitely worth it!

I ordered the quinoa tacos. Beans were delicious and a bit spicy and I loved the pickled onions. The quinoa was a bit bland. The rest of the table ordered the turkey French dip, a quesadilla and the kids got a kiddo mac'n'cheese (good) and plain fries (which were the same fries as our truffle appetizer, but more toned down).

Overall, we were pleased. Nothing blew me away, but that cocktail was enough to bring me back. It's a beautiful place and one that is perfect and definitely affordable for happy hour. If you play your cards right, you can manage two fancy cocktails, a couple burgers and a big order of fries all for less than $40, with tip."}
{"text":"Upscale place. Great for work events, happy hour, date night, girls night. 
Service was good even though it was busy in there tonight... On a Wednesday night! 
Food quality was very tasty. Lots of flavor and good chefs there!
Slightly too expensive for me, but over in a while it's nice. 
Place was open and clean. 
Lot's of parking! 

Overall very nice place."}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant! Fox concepts has outdone itself again. I could spend all day here and not get tired of the ambiance. I went for Sunday brunch, which was my only mistake. The service was extremely slow and we waited for 10+ minutes between receiving drinks, utensils, etc. Three of us were seated on a big comfy couch and our food was served on a rustic coffee table. The French toast and veggie scramble were delicious."}
{"text":"wow this place is so good!!!! Shared 1 dish and 2 appetizers and it was more than enough delicious food! a really cool location and atmosphere and a great wine and whisky list! I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"Well! I finally got a chance to go back last night! Service was impeccable...and probably had some of the best food I ever had! The quinoa tacos were amazing! The kale salad was out of this world! And why not top off the  \"healthy\" meal I had with the most awesome, the most spectacular bread pudding I ever put in my mouth??? Well done The Henry...well done!"}
{"text":"Now that I'm out of my food coma, I can review. On the rec of a great friend, I splurged today. Incredibly indulgent & amazing breakfast. The Wildflower coffee, cheddar popovers, brûléed pink grapefruit, flower child scramble and my waiter Matthew. The popovers were beyond delicious. By the time I got to my main I was already full!! I grabbed a brown butter salted caramel roll to go. So good I don't even know how to describe it. Heavenly. Mouthwatering. Sat out on the patio, wasn't rushed at all. Can't wait to go back for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Located in the front of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, where I was staying, it was a convenient stop for breakfast one morning.  The food is probably slightly above average, but then loses a star for being over-expensive.  

My egg benedict was in fact cooked perfectly.  I also enjoyed the fresh squeezed orange juice.

One of thier highlighted menu items is a short rib egg benedict, which my girlfriend ordered..  While It might appeal to some, I found it completely way too heavy to be a breakfast item.  The rib was your average rib infused into the benedict like ham except it consumes probably 70% of the dish upon doing so.  I'd call it more of \"Small dinner rib with poach egg\". 

Oh, but thier ice cubes are darn cool"}
{"text":"Great mid week breakfast spot. Love the patio, the food and the coffee. This place is big; lots of both indoor and outdoor space. 
Friendly service, peaceful vibe and clean restrooms. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I've only been here once for lunch in the past. Thanksgiving weekend Sunday, before sending the kids back to school, I made Open Table 10:15 Brunch reservations. Very trendy Restoration Hardware atmosphere with multiple areas of dining, take out, casual high tops, bar area, outdoor patio dining and inside. Our server Iman introduced herself and was excellent.

Of course we ordered brunch cocktails: Grapefruit Mimosa and Bloody Marys. Entrees were: The California Bowl, (Eggs) Huevos Rancheros, Caramel Apple French Toast w/a side of Bacon and Bagel & Lox.

All the dishes were very good. The California Bowl a bit small for the price. Eggs Rancheros was excellent. French Toast was voted hands down the best dish ordered. The weakest was the Lox and Bagel, weak in presentation and when opened up only 2 tiny pieces of lox on each half not worth the price. We address this with Iman and it was quickly fixed (thank you Iman!)

All in all Atmosphere: Love, Service: excellent, Food: good though I would try other dishes before ordering the Lox & Bagel again... Go for the FRENCH TOAST!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin?????

Well enjoyed being seated only to wait about 5 mins before the server (he didn't say his name) came over to ask if we wanted something to drink.  Mentions there was a coffee bar and pointed over the area so did he want us to get our own coffee?  Seemed implied.  Ok 2 of my friends order coffee drinks and another ordered green tea and I got water.  I was really excited about the build your own bloody mary cart that I kept hearing about.  Only for him to explain it's not ready yet and will be in about 30 mins.  Ok that makes it 930am great. My friend then had to ask him to bring 2 waters for our friends who weren't there yet, ummm shouldn't he has just known to do that without having to be told?  Okay so friends get there and ask to be on their own tab (makes it so easy before ordering everything) they ask for an iced tea and diet coke.  Super simple right, well at this point horrible server tells us the bloody mary cart isn't going to be ready for another 45 mins, so clearly you don't know what time your restaurant runs things and you're the server.  Ok breakfast would be over by then so my diet coke friend and myself said never mind.  He then pipes up and says I can still get you one from the bar.  No thanks that whole point is to pick your items for your BM, so I get an iced coffee. We order some popovers that were ok, not great just ok.  So now it's been about 10 mins no iced tea, diet coke or my iced coffee I ask the server about our drinks \"oh yay\"  I'll bring them right out, AKA I forgot to order them.  Again my friend reminds we they are on their own tab, everyone orders a table of 6, I have to ask another server for a water refill because our waiting just didn't get the empty glasses at the end of the table meaning need more water,  since we still didn't have our other drinks, he comes over and fills the glasses I'm assuming because she told him.  Now it's only 9 something am on a Sunday so not crazy busy I would say.  Great finally get drinks but again he walks away without asking my friend with green iced tea if he would like a refill.  I sorry but your choose to be a server then you need to be better at serving people and be aware of what your tables need.  So of course he had to ask for a refill still no food, about 35 mins later we get our food, great except my friend in the our own tabs didn't get his order and I asked for gravy on the side ( i didn't dare say something with how long it took to get here the first time).  Seriously, it's that hard to write orders down and put into a computer to order????? Especially because the other tables he had were empty at this point.  So he says about 10 more mins for my friends food, so awkward a table of 6 and 1 whole meal is missing, wow.  I assume the manager came over within 2 mins and brought his food apologized and brought him a yogurt parfait for having to wait.  Wow if the server could only take lessons from his manager.  Ok it's now 1015 it took that long to get breakfast in a not overly crowded restaurant.  We get our checks and mine was $18 and change I give a $20 and he smartly says do you want your change, No I said, really at this point you continue to be stupid.  So he brings everyone their cards back and bring me my bill and $1.  Seriously, this guy is  out of control, I said no, yet you bring me just a dollar back, not even the entire change.  Now you get the change and $1 for your tip.  I always feel bad for servers since they live for tips and give at least 20% but I have never experienced such horrible service like this.  Especially from the Fox restaurants.  Makes me  wonder if the other restaurant servers have gone down hill as well.  WON'T BE RETURNING HERE AGAIN!  Would give zero stars if possible."}
{"text":"Service here is nails. Our server Joseph didn't even give us eye contact and treated us like shit. Very rude. If you don't wanna be there dont be. So fuck this place. The food was decent but for $70 I'll go somewhere my money is appreciated. So keep rolling your eyes Joseph at least I'll never see it again you prick!"}
{"text":"I always stay at the Cosmo and this past week I was there, I tried the restaurants within the hotel. I seriously had the ribeye steak 3 times within these past 3 days. Lol it was really that good! I would recommend this place for their steak. I really enjoyed it and loved it! Try it!"}
{"text":"our first visit to The Henry (I think it's only about a year old) - another trendy Arcadia spot! great parking to start off (we were just saying parking in Phoenix is part of the dining experience - no?) and as we neared the entrance  we saw lots of comfy seating on the front patio.  we thought the  décor lovely inside in a hip neighborhood way.  our table for four @9:15 on Sat nite just took a minute - enough time to check out the bar and coffee bar/café to the right.  however, our table right by the kitchen/dishes was kinda loud - would prefer more in the front next time.  when we ordered a bottle of Riesling for $36, asked for 4 popovers right away.  we hoped she didn't think we meant four orders of popovers - waitress didn't elaborate but she knew we just wanted 4.  they were very good and unique with complex butters but I've had them before served piping hot so I was a little taken aback these were cold popovers.  we couldn't  resist also getting the brie toast (delish brie) so we got the truffled French fries as well - both very tasty to share.  I ordered the salmon salad and again waitress didn't elaborate because there are two - kale with salmon or salmon salad $18.  there was a little mix up but we were compensated nicely without saying a word.  the guys had the black truffle lasagna $16- very tasty with flavorful mushrooms, brussel sprouts with a white cheese sauce.  good service and interesting kinda casual  menu - not somewhere I have to go to all the time but glad we checked it out.   the place was filled with cool people - good choice to bring friends cuz it was a fun nite!"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch and it was pretty quiet, not many people but we like it like that. We were seated where I can see college basketball and to me, that works very well! The decor is nice, with tons of chesterfield's leather seats. 

I was debating on what to get but since it's brunch, I went with my usual favorite...eggs benedict. However, I got the braised short ribs eggs benedict and that was just out of this world. I loved it and it was perfectly seasoned and the eggs were runny. Perfection. Their cinnamon roll french toast is also delicious, it's out of this world, actually. Wash it down with their freshly squeezed orange juice and my day was that much better already. 

Great service to boot!"}
{"text":"A very welcome surprise at 4 AM in Vegas.  Service is excellent and friendly. The food is off the Hook!!

A good time was had by all!"}
{"text":"I came in the morning and it so busy nonstop, so I believed it must be good!
I ordered the quinoa burrito and it was awesome! Perfect size for brunch. 
The services was wonderful, each couch, corner, table, and chairs were so cozy. 
They have plug charger connection on the table so it is easy for people who just work with their laptop, and it's open WiFi connection. 
The food's price is average and I think it worth to stay since the place quite big and cozy. I would like to go back to try something else! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Literally took our 2 year anniversary trip to Phoenix to go to the Fox Concept restaurants. This did not disappoint. If true food and hillstone had a baby and elevated it, then it would be this restaurant. Simply top notch. Very sad there are none of these in Vegas or LA! The turkey French dip and kale slaw was amazing. So fresh and so different. Highly recommend. The bread melts in your mouth. Sam Fox does it once again! If I lived on the area it would be impossible not to be a regular here. A+"}
{"text":"Oh Henry! I have such a love hate relationship with you. I love the big bright airy indoor areas, but hate that you are always so busy I can't get a seat without a reservation. I am a huge fan of your happy hour but I have to dance around like some big vulture hawk in order to get a seat at the bar. 

Your food is wonderful. Shirt rib anything, I've both the pot stickers and the short ribs and each time ended up ordering another round. The chopped salad is what you would expect (turkey, ham, egg, bacon, white cheddar, tomato) but the fat-e-o buttermilk dressing is deceivingly light and creamy tasting.  The fat-e-o buttermilk fried chicken sandwich should be taken off the menu so I could restrain myself from pigging out on it every time. They fry the breast and then slather it in havarti cheese & bbq mayonnaise.

Help me now! Next time I will jog from my house to make all those calories make sense (and I live far)!"}
{"text":"Sam Fox does it again! None of his restaurants have disappointed me, The Henry included. The ambiance and atmosphere was so hip and cool, but not pretentious at all. We sat outside and watched all the fancy cars roll up, which was kinda fun. The back patio had pretty lights all around. And the food, was of course, totally legit. We split the cheddar popovers and ate all of them. I got the fatoosh salad, which although it was heavy on the dressing, I had no trouble polishing off. My husband really enjoyed his corned beef sandwich. The service was great, and I appreciated the manager coming out to check on us. She even asked if the dressing was too heavy and offered to make a new salad, which I declined because I don't like to send back food. But the offer was much appreciated. Overall, great experience."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for the first time. I ordered the chicken fried chicken. Chicken was a bit over cooked. With the exception of the potatoes, the food was bland and didn't have much taste to it. Salt and pepper really didn't help either. The food looked nice on my plate though I guess. Didn't want to make a big deal by sending my food back b/c I was just there to enjoy my friends. Don't think I'd return though"}
{"text":"So I now have tried this place a few times, but still have to try more of their delicious menu items!  
The beauty of this place is in the way the place is set up and decorated.  A cute coffee bar is set up inside in between the dining and \"study\" area.  This place is designed in such a classy way that it makes you want to dress up classy and dine here breakfast, brunch, and lunch, and dinner.  But it's a great place to meet up with family and friends.  A bar and TVs are also available!
I have tried the Wildflower (vanilla, espresso, steamed milk with a splash of chai) and the Cleo (almond milk, hazelnut, espresso).  Both are great nontraditional coffees to taste.  
The Flower Child Scramble (snap pea, asparagus, kale, roasted mushroom, parmesean - $11)  is a great combination for something non-meaty.  This had a great mix of flavorful vegetables.
Chicken Fried Chicken (buttermilk biscuits, fried egg and gravy - $13) - I don't think you can go wrong with something so darn good.
I really love the Quinoa Breakfast Burrito (organic eggs, black bean, roasted corn, chile, avocado, pepper jack - $10).  All these ingredients....what's not to love!  It comes with cuts of potatoes!  This dish is light yet flavorful!   
Ending it with a dessert - the Warm Croissant Bread Pudding (toasted pecans, caramel ice cream, whiskey raisins - $7).  I love the creative twist on this bread pudding.  That buttery taste of croissant bread mixed in with sweetness and crunch of the pecans made it so yummmm!  Share it!"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly. There was something for everyone on the menu options. Coffee drinks and cocktails were all well balanced and delicious."}
{"text":"This restaurant is perfect for a fun, casual dinner. They have a wonderful wine selection and the food is a mixture of classic dishes and more inventive. I loved the short rib potstickers and chimichurri steak! The wine by the glass program is pretty amazing too. Delicious choices at a reasonable price. Will be back!"}
{"text":"We've been on a bit of a Fox binge lately, and I think I can sum up our feelings on The Henry in one word: Yup.

That's really all you need to know. It is outstanding.

First, the decor and ambiance is so glorious. You're sitting in someone's fancy mansion living room, except there's a gigantic kitchen in there so you can watch the action. It's such a unique environment, one that I haven't experienced in any other restaurant, and I LOVED IT. 

I started with a delicious glass of Sangiovese blend, while boyfriend ordered a pinapple passion fruit from their homemade soda list. (LOVE this trend.) It was tart and refreshing!

We started with the kale and roasted garlic dip, because obviously this is what one does when they see such a thing of beauty on the menu. I'll now dream of that cheesy, bubbly dip and how to replicate it at home, but I'll know it's a lost cause and have to head back there to order it again and again. (Kale means it's low-cal.)

I decided to keep with the gluttonous theme for the night and go with the black truffle lasagna. Two more words: COME ON. Your own (deceptively) tiny skillet comes out of the oven in a glory of pasta, cheese, mushrooms and brussels. Those shaved brussels really made it. I had to pump myself up to finish the entire thing (because I am fat), but it was worth it. So, so worth it.

Boyfriend had been waffling between the roasted chicken and burger. Our server quickly assured him the burger was amazing, and he kept it classic with a side of fries. He said it was easily one of the best burgers of his life. (Remember that fat thing I said up there? I used some of his fries to finish off the lasagna sauce left in my plate. Told you.)

The Henry really did live up to the hype for us. The only downside was that I don't get to live next door. Many return visits await!"}
{"text":"Very impressed overall! Great atmosphere, friendly staff and delicious food (the truffle and parmesan fries are to die for!).

For those of you devout bloody mary connoisseurs out there, The Henry provides a unique and impressive spin on the bloody mary bar. Unlike most bloody mary bars, theirs are prepared tableside. They allow you to select from their 4-5 different house infused vodkas, which include but are not limited to bacon, rosemary & garlic and chile verde. They mix the bloody mary for you, serve it in a generous sized tall glass, and garnish it with an assortment of veggies and a thick slice of Applewood smoked bacon. It was easily one of the best bloodies I've ever tried, if not the best. And all of this for only $10!

I will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"It's so important to end a vacation on a high note. I like a good, solid meal in my stomach before I get onto a plane and force myself to reenter my \"normal\" life back home. The restaurant I choose to provide this meal can really make or break my whole vacation experience, as it is the last impression I have of a place before I leave.

I entrusted this responsibility to The Henry. And Henry delivered nicely.

It's like a New York diner that went to finishing school for a few years and came back a proper lady. Leather upholstery, smartly-dressed waiters and a menu lousy with truffled this and organic that. They stop serving breakfast some time before noon, but luckily for my egg-obsessed boyfriend, they have 3 breakfast plates that they serve all day. 

I'm not so breakfast-reliant and opted instead for the tuna melt on marble rye. It was, without reservation, the best tuna sandwich I've ever had from a restaurant. The rye was buttery and crisply toasted, the tuna was smooth with just a hint of vegetable crunch (I hate chunks of greens in my tuna salad) and the perfect amount of melted cheese (Swiss, I think). I chose fries as my side. They were salty, delicious shoestrings in a little metal pot. I ate every single one. Literally. 

They skew toward the pricey side, which keeps me from awarding them 5 stars. But it's Vegas, it's the Strip, and it's located in the newest, hippest hotel ON the strip. So for those reasons, they can get away with it. 

But seriously, the food is great. I'd recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch on a Saturday and the wait was around 20 minutes. We ended up eating here because the line for Eggslut was much much longer. This ended up being a great choice!

I had the Rose All Day and that was good. It was bubbly and sweet. Definitely started my day a little tipsy!

I ordered the California omelet with a side of truffle tater tots. The omelet was the most beautiful omelet I have ever had. The egg was perfectly colored and it was stuffed in the most perfect shape. It was really good too. They didn't skimp out on any of the toppings and everything was evenly spread. The truffle tater tots were amazing. The tots were super crispy and hot with a hint of truffle. 

We got a plate of the french toast to share. I only had a bite because I was so full but it was definitely a nice way to end the meal.

The worse part is the service. It took forever to get any attention. Asking for a side of toast should not take 20 minutes.

Great breakfast spot overall. Just wish the service was better. Would definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate a birthday. We all came very hungry the 4 of us including out 16yr old and unfortunately we all left very hungry.  The portions are very small and the prices are not.  We had the skunk salmon which was a very small piece and our 16 yr old ate it in less than 3 minutes at a price tag of $28.  We started the evening with the Kale Ricotta dip which everyone thought was way to salty.  We added chicken to the Harvest Bowl which was not oneee the menu being able to add proteins, but the asst manager said most people do, then why not add it to the menu, but chicken was very dry.  I had the homemade pasta with bolognese sauce while the sauce was great the portion size was more of a small lunch size than a dinner size.  We ended the night with everyone having a different dessert.  The pear cake with pear gelato, while the gelato was delicious the cake was hard and dry.  The chocolate molten cake also dry,  the bread pudding was definitely the star.  All in all the dinner was just okay nothing amazing.  Gabriel the waiter was excellent.  The fact portion size was much smaller than normal with the prices more expensive than most, doubt we will return.  No WoW factor here pretty boring and average."}
{"text":"The ambiance here is supposed to be equestrian-sexy-chic but it came off to me as electric-chair-chic. This does not affect my rating, it just needs to be said.

I had the salmon niçoise and it was perfect! Too many olives (and I love olives!) but that wasn't a big deal. Blanched veggies, green goddess dressing. It just all came together expertly. 

Everyone else liked their food and cocktails.

Sara was a standout server, too!"}
{"text":"Ate here for breakfast one morning during a conference at the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Amazing food. Only had a chance to eat here once, but if I'm ever back there again I will definitely be going back for the short rib eggs benedict. Yum! The meat was so tender and the sauce was so delish...I wanted to scoop up every last drop. The service was impeccable and the atmosphere was great even inside a hotel next to a casino!! Pricey but worth it because the entire experience from food to service was superb!"}
{"text":"After a wild crazy night on the vegas strip, stumbled upon Henry's in our hotel at the cosmo and decided to chow down on some breakfast before we passed out.. and this is what i ordered

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Er8DpPwf_lHHv64ncWhD8g?select=O-T1Lufo--UIZ4xLsQkLYQ

For $16..
Huevos Rancheros
marinated steak, avocado, peppers, onions scrambled eggs, jack 
cheese & ranchero sauce

The Huevos Rancheros is a great tasting dish and would definitely order again. Good amount of avocado was placed superbly onto the hot melting cheese that engulfed the flour tortilla filled with marinated steak, onions and doused with ranchero sauce...mmmmmm.. what more can you ask for for !  Yes its a bit on the heavy side compared to the other breakfast items but it sure made me feel alot better after a night of heavy dosage of drinking."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a late lunch here. I'm not a huge fan of open air restaurants in hotel casinos, but the Henry does a decent job of masking its location. Give their version of the mule a try - it has a really interested thyme flavor (and bartender Nas is a lot of fun!). The buffalo chicken wrap is also good for sharing. Nothing special, but good enough for upscale casual Vegas :)"}
{"text":"Ehhhhhh....VERY overrated! Waiting about 30 minutes for food. All of our food was very bland. We had French toast, turkey French dip and a salad. My sons grilled cheese was the best thing. We were pretty excited about eating here. Pretty much a flop.... but there staff is very nice and the restaurant itself is really cool!


****EDIT**** thank you for the response Chelsea, I tried messaging you but Yelp won't let me for some reason. It is a 45 minute drive for us and the price plus distance, just wasn't good. We'll stick closer to places we know we love! However, I greatly appreciate the offer."}
{"text":"Great breakfast choice. Of the things I've tried here I'd have to say the breakfast burrito is the best. It's good sized, I could only finish 1/2. Nicely decorated restaurant, good service & not too crazy expensive."}
{"text":"The Henry is a nice looking place with a trendy menu. I was seated immediately but it took a good 10 minutes for the waiter to come over. I don't think he knew I was his table. Once he came over the service was very good. Coffee and Eggs Benedict please. It's been a pretty long time since the last well made Eggs Benedict so my anticipation for a good Eggs Benedict was very high.

The food arrived very quick. The plate look like they dribbled sauce all over it and tried to wipe it off smearing it everywhere. The silver wear was dirty and the coffee was sour. The ham was very dry and tasted like it was frozen and microwaved. Very disappointing for a 7:30am breakfast."}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast here, the blood marys were spicy and strong, just the way they should be. It was obvious people liked the place since it was packed when we got there. I had a custom omelet, it was great, and the OJ was good but as I remember a little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"IDK how you can NOT love this place.

It is the ONLY saving grace and a holy grail at 4am. The quality of food is superb and service is top notch. Please, do not underestimate the barkeeps as they will surprise you by making really delicious and well executed adult beverages.

It gets really REALLY busy during peak hours and I highly suggest to NOT arrive starving but 30 min before as typically the wait time is between 30 - 45min depending on your group size."}
{"text":"Farmed salmon dish posing as real wild caught salmon (look it up); server didn't know any better so she lied in saying that it was indeed wild. That about sums it up for me. Otherwise uninspired menu that is overall decent enough but not spectacular. Same goes for the ambiance and decor. It looks like they tried to do something interesting here, hired skilled designers and mostly pulled it off, but it still kind of falls flat. Very typical Fox concept. I'd come back if they priced it as what it is, but this is definitely a lame corporate concept struggling to pose as something that it never can be."}
{"text":"Our group of friends were starving by the time we arrived here after waiting in line and getting stamped for Marquee. Got some hot, crispy chicken wings and crispy fries. Taste just the way it should be. Delicious."}
{"text":"Really nice place - the korean skirt steak was soooooo good! Service was a little slow but other than that would highly recommend this place"}

{"text":"Very good hotel cafe for breakfast and lunch (did not do dinner during stay). Hearty portions in comfortable and eclectic setting. Eggs Benedict very good with perfect egg and tangy hollandaise. For lunch next day wife and I split the steak sandwich. Again very hearty with soft roll and tender steak with horseradish sauce and aus ju. Fries done well rounded out a filling lunch. Prices are little higher than most hotel cafes but better than average food and large portions."}
{"text":"Had fish n chips two difference nights and it was so delicious.  I recommend the thin fries over the steak fries.  Both are good but thin r my favorite."}
{"text":"Damn... this place is delicious, and i'm not just saying that because I may or may not have been tired and intoxicated when I dined here.

On Friday, July 4th, after a happenin' night out with my girlfriends, it was our goal to find food; fried, fatty food to be exact. Well I don't know if people know this, but there is not an abundance of fast food choices available inside The Cosmopolitan. We were desperate for food so we asked a nice bartender where we would find french fries and a burger at the hour of 3 a.m. She directed us to The Henry. We arrived at the entrance to the restaurant and we were quickly seated by a pleasant gentleman. Our waiter shortly followed and took our drink orders. After thoroughly reviewing the menu, and subsequently stumbling upon the fried chicken sandwich, my mind was made up. We all ordered our food and then we waited, and waited, and, well, waited some more. Now, I don't know if it just seemed like an eternity due to the hour of the day or our level of intoxication, but man... waiting for our food was like waiting for a popsicle to melt in Antarctica. 

Finally, our food arrived! And ohhhh myyyy gahhhh.... it was sooooooooo good. I would gladly have waited for another hour if I had known what was in store. The spicy chicken sandwich is unreal. I'm talking crunchy, fried, spicy, two layers of chicken with a tasty and tangy slaw in the middle on a delicious bun with pickles. Throw a side of french fries next to it and it wins the best looking couple of the year award in my book. Classiest, most expensive, but well-worth-it drunk food. (Or sober food if alc just isn't your thing)"}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant because of Yelp. It was late night after the cirque show. Cannot say it was spectacular. We had much. Water in Vegas. The French toast was good."}
{"text":"The food, service, and decor is impeccable. Ambiance is relaxing. Very neighborhood and  local business patronage. 
The food is sinful, comfort, and umami! Recommend to outside visitors, locals, and special events."}
{"text":"It is a grand tradition for Vegas for me to have a $20 cheeseburger.

After doing old school hip-hop at Hakkasan and having enough kamikazes to rid that glorious wind, I was brought here. The friends wanted to do the Secret Pizza Spot, and we went on the search for a cheeseburger.

The Henry disappointed. For the price it commanded... we expected:

1.) It to survive a cab ride home on the strip. We asked for it to be medium and not bipolar (cold on the outside, warm on the inside).

2.) For it to not be dry

3.) For it to have cheese

4.) For it to be good

It did nothing.

FAIL."}
{"text":"The Henry is absolutely beautiful inside but, like most experiences I've had at Fox Restaurants, the food leaves something to be desired. I ordered the \"flower child scramble\" and substituted pepper jack cheese for the parmesan but the pepper jack that came with the scramble was hardly cheese! It was a single slice placed atop the scramble and had a very plastic-y texture, more like a cheese produce (ie a Kraft single or Velveeta) than actual cheese. Kind of disappointing and underwhelming. Like I said before though, the interior is stunning and it isn't too noisy, nor did I have to wait too long to get a seat, despite the fact that it was a busy Sunday morning. Next time I go I'll try a lunch plate and hope it's better than that breakfast scramble."}
{"text":"*** PROS ***
* Delicious food! Short-rib benedict and crab benedict were AMAZING!!
* Our server was very nice, always keeping us up to date, and even sharing details of how we could get to the neighboring property by taking the 2nd floor bridge.
* Our server even gave my sister a tea-to-go.
*** CONS ***
* Took 25 minutes to be served due to the crab cake being hand-made not pre-processed. 
All in all, GREAT! I would return."}
{"text":"Their fried chicken is amazing. The mimosas are really strong and they make their Bloody Mary's right in front of you. Ask for David when you come, he is so great!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the patio seating around this time of the year. Combination of Food and Drink menu kept me coming back, bringing visitors from out of town...until this time, I made a reservation via Opentable.com for out door patio. When I showed up, unfortunately there was a struggle with getting the patio table with the hostess. She stated that it couldn't be \"reserved\" and she could only offer the inside. Interestingly, there were at least 3 other opens tables were opened in the patio as we finally were seated outside. Moreover, one of the table had a \"reserved\" sign on it. It was really a confusing system. It was rather a frustrating experience! If this fox-concept place keeps this up, I can also help to spread the words...There are many other places can offer the same, patio, good food and drinks."}
{"text":"Stopped at The Henry for an early brunch on a Sunday morning. We were expecting a hefty wait but to our surprise we were seated outside rather quickly. The service is a bit slow, so be prepared for that when dining. I had the original egg sandwich and it was alright, definitely wouldn't order it again. Another person in my party ordered the chicken fried chicken dish and I will be ordering that the next time I go to The Henry for brunch."}
{"text":"This place was c r o w d e d. We had to wait about 40 min for a table. Had a breakfast burrito. It was pretty good. My fiancé has the regular breakfast and the potatoes and toast didn't look so good. However he said he liked it. I would definitely make a reservation next time."}
{"text":"The service was slow even though the place was pretty much empty when we arrived. The food is decent but nothing I'd recommend to a friend especially for the price. The good news is if you are seated to the left you have a pretty good view of the dancers."}
{"text":"My wife and I don't do buffets, but we needed a brunch location close by to make our flight home. We were staying at the Cosmopolitan so we had noticed The Henry earlier in the weekend. Convenient and no wait so we sat right down. 

Our party of 4 ordered the Traditional Benedict, 2 breakfast sandwiches and one oatmeal.  I had the Benedict, which I liked a lot. The menu boasted of its \"Real Canadian Bacon, English Muffin & Hollandaise\".  I didn't realize fake Canadian bacon is a big problem?  Are cheaper Canadian-style bacons from Maine or Minnesota being passed off as the real thing?  Why isn't the English muffin real too?  Ok, enough fun -  good Benedict (I'm a Benedict aficionado), but not truly exceptional. 

The breakfast sandwiches were well received, but they were stoopid huge and maybe a little on the bland side flavor-wise.  My sister-in-law liked her oatmeal, and the round of orange juices for the table were good as well. 

At home I'd probably have given The Henry 4 stars, but the standards have to be higher in Las Vegas - if you're in a food town, you gotta step it up a notch. I liked The Henry a lot and wouldn't hesitate to go back.  But for the price (expensive but reasonable for the Strip) and for Las Vegas it is a solid but unexceptional choice.  Good place, but not the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Beautiful setting ... waiters could have cared less we were there .... 8 people ... 4 meals were good , 4 meals stone cold ! We didn't complain, should have .. patio was great... we had fun in spite of food. & service... 
last visit there ... too many good options in Scottsdale!

Sure please call ..."}
{"text":"I've been curious about The Henry so when a friend suggested we meet here for lunch I was eager. I checked out the menu beforehand and was a little disappointed, but still went anyway. Fingers crossed for a daily special. The menu does not identify whether or not an item is gluten free. Being vegetarian AND gluten intolerant the menu seemed very small. The brussel sprout Caesar minus the croutons was good, but not good enough for me to return. 

The reason for just 3 stars is the lack of notation on the menu regarding gluten/non gluten items. I can think of at least 2 other Fox restaurants that have updated menus. Also, I attempted to order truffle fries. The very kind waitress went back and forth to multiple times only to find out there is not a separate fryer that is strictly for gluten free items. Clearly this whole gluten thing is a big deal to me, I hoped The Henry cared more about patrons with food allergies-wrong!"}
{"text":"Blink and you might miss The Henry as you walk out of the Cosmopolitan and onto the Vegas strip. It looks like an unassuming coffee shop that is tucked off to the corner, right at the Cosmo's side entrance that is the closest to the Bellagio.

We first stumbled across it one early morning while searching for a nearby breakfast option, and decided to give it a try. I am so glad we did. It is now a \"must visit\" whenever I am in the area early in the morning or when staying at the Cosmopolitan.

While The Henry serves up soups, salad, and burgers and is open 24 hours a day, I have (thus far) only come back time and again for their signature Short Rib Benedict that is decadence on a plate. 

Imagine a sexy hunk of skillfully braised beef short sitting atop a somewhat crunchy yet delicate potato cake, the whole floating in a glistening meat sauce. This is topped with a couple of expertly poached eggs (that remain firm to the touch, but bleed their citrine yolks at the slightest poke from your fork), a luscious Hollandaise sauce, and a smattering of caviar for added effect. It's the stuff that dreams are made of.

I can also vouch for their Cinnamon Roll French Toast when I've been in the mood for something sweet over something savoury, which is dipped in an unctuous vanilla custard and served with maple syrup, creamery butter, and candied pecans.

If you visit early in the morning and the Hungarian-born Attila is working the bar, you're in line for whole other treat, especially if you like to get your Vegas drink on before noon. If that's the case, I would highly recommend sitting at the bar and passing on the coffee and orange juice, as Attila is quite the mixologist and it would be a shame to let his talents go to waste. 

My favorite cocktail, that pairs ever-so-nicely with the Short Rib Benedict, is The Henry's Midtown Manhattan. Imagine some bacon-infused Maker's Mark bourbon, some cinnamon and fig infused sweet vermouth, and a mix of bitters (including Aztec chocolate bitters). Perfection!

If you absolutely need coffee with your breakfast, ask Attila to make you a Beam Me Up Scotty, which mixes Van Gogh Double Espresso Vodka with Tia Maria, a shot of Espresso, and a creamy vanilla syrup. There's also a nice selection of unique Bloody Mary drinks, including the Spicy Swine that uses that tasty bacon-infused bourbon in place of vodka."}
{"text":"The service is very quick, not a long wait to be seated. Had the French toast which was fantastic."}
{"text":"Not a fan of Fox restaurants and went in for dinner expecting the usual inexperienced service and thrown together food, but The Henry blew me away with one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had and good service.

The atmosphere is not typical, either.  Imagine old money club meets renovated factory.  It works.  Very noisy, so don't go for a quiet meal.  It's a bit chaotic being so big and noisy, and this may have caused the long pauses between wait staff visits.

Great cocktails.  Definitely recommend.  Skip the dinner salad because they're pretty boring and pre-made so sit around a while.

Now to that pasta.  Try the bolognese.  You will thank me."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere are so nice. Farm house chic decor with great trendy menu. We started with a caramel roll because my sister said \"you've got to taste this\".  Looks simple-unimpressive but looks are deceiving!   One of the best pastries I've ever eaten!  We had great mimosas  They are hand crafted and delish.  We ordered short rib potstickers, smoked Norwegian salmon, and guacamole for appetizers.  All delicious!  Turkey cobb salad with buttermilk dressing was yummy!  Wild mushroom radiatori was wonderful. All American burger and roasted chicken were excellent too.   Nothing we ordered was marginal or just ok-all high quality and worth eating!   Make reservations early or you'll never get a table...."}
{"text":"Came for brunch. Only rating 4 because I've had better. Ordered the eggs Benedict with bacon instead of Canadian bacon, the salmon avocado toast, and French toast. The eggs Benedict was really good. The salmon avocado was good but the smoky flavor of the salmon was a bit much, also they could have not stacked so much of it, but the avocado spread was really good. Be warned the French toast is really really big. Wish the waiter told us we wouldn't have ordered it."}
{"text":"This place is busy and very trendy .. I had a work lunch meeting here and can totally see myself coming back for coffee and my laptop..

For lunch we split the chilled shrimp and short rib potstickers .. those potstickers are amazing!! I would eat those as a meal.. delish and plenty to share.. we started with the chicken tortilla soup which was rich and deep flavors.. (our waiter was kind enough to have the kitchen split a cup of soup so two of us could try it )

I then had the spinach salad with a crispy poached egg (heavenly) and added chicken (which was minimal, for a $4 add)..

We finished by sharing the warm croissant bread pudding.. omg! This is fantastic .. with caramel ice cream .. so buttery and gooey.. split this with your table because this buttery goodness is a treat that needs to be shared!!

I most definitely will be back to try a couple other items that caught my eye!!"}
{"text":"Oh--yeah! V nice. V good. Like fancy but not fancy at the same time. You should go here.

Food on the plate when they bring it. They bring you what you order. Nice pictures on the wall to see. Barely any gum under the tables."}
{"text":"Tried to eat lunch here today.  Was sat near the fireplace until a table opened up.  Waited for a half hour with no service.  Three servers came outside but none offered menus or even glanced our way.  Three tables sat open, unbussed while we were waiting.  Disappointing customer service.  We finally walked out because we couldn't get anyone's attention and were hungry.  Decor is really great, but it looks like they need more management and training."}
{"text":"To be honest I had to eat here because of the name. I assume the food was going to be average and overpriced like most hotel cafés. Overall it was above average and overpriced. We started off with the nacho tater tots. They were very tasty and a decent size. Remember we're not talking gourmet food here just good pub food. I followed up with a Henry breakfast which was good but nothing special. We went at approximately 3:30pm and the restaurant was relatively empty. The server was very helpful but came by the table very little to make sure things were running smoothly. I would be a little concerned if the restaurant was very crowded the service may be a little slow. Overall I would go back."}
{"text":"Another great Fox Restaurant concept! Cute restaurant, nice atmosphere and good service. So far, I've been here once for dinner and once for breakfast. For dinner, I had the chopped salad - very good but a little heavy. There were a lot of items on the breakfast menu I'd like to try - I had the egg white turkey omelette, really good but if you're like me and you're ordering it because it has avocado, ask for extra. There is just a small amount of smashed avocado on top of the omelet. 

The patio is really nice - as of last weekend, they didn't have umbrellas out there yet, so dress for the heat if you're sitting outside. 

It looks like they have a good happy hour but they only have it available in the bar area - and even when I got there mid-week a little after 5:00, it was already full. 
Would definitely recommend making a reservation - this place can get packed."}
{"text":"I was here to grab some breakfast on the way home, and my stomach was definitely grumbling.  I grabbed a quick order of a bagel/schmear and ham.  I was amused at the fact that my orange juice came in a martini glass, how neat.  

The prices were decent and the service was nice.  Definitely a good way of waking up and getting a meal in."}
{"text":"The Henry has a nice vibe, the atmosphere just sucks you in so you want to stay and hangout all day. I don't think I have had a single item that wasn't good. I recommend the prime steak sandwich and popovers! I would recommend you try it! The con is the service... The girls at the front always seem pretty confused and don't even bother sitting at the bar if you want someone to take your order."}
{"text":"This is an awesome place for some modern twists on brunch and beverages! The atmosphere is really great and gives it a nice rustic yet modern feel! There is a separate area for specialty coffee drinks and they also have a small bakery where you can purchase fresh pastries, croissants, banana loaves, and muffins. 

There were so many great options for breakfast and they also had a lunch menu, but I tend to stick with the egg items, etc. I ordered the Henry egg sandwich and it was amazing!!! My wife ordered the eggs Benedict which was pretty good too! She also ordered this plum infused vodka Bloody Mary and she loved it! 

The Bloody Mary's come from this cool cart that walks around the tables and offers to make fresh Bloody Mary's custom made for the certain individual. It was actually pretty cool, but it doesn't come so often, so be ready to order and know what you want!

Overall the place is great for brunch! The wait is quite long on the weekends so be sure to get their early or be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"Beautiful place, I had the burger, my friend had the turkey French dip. Delicious! The kale dip app was amazing too. We even had dessert! Holy Cow, it was a warm croissant bread pudding. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"This review is for breakfast -- which was delicious.  I heard about their short ribs benedict but wasn't hungry enough so went with the egg white omelet.  Everything was cooked perfectly. Also ask for a side of tater tots which were awesome!  Great place for a relaxing breakfast at the Cosmo."}
{"text":"We love this place!!! 
It is the perfect place for brunch, every aspect of this place is great: food, location, space, people, coffee etc
We are in the East valley but go for brunch or lunch as often as we can."}
{"text":"Quite possibly the best steak I have ever eaten in my 47 years. This place really knows how to do it right. The French Onion Soup is crazy good as well."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant.  The moment you walk in you feel comfortable.  The ambiance is uplifting and refreshing.  The menu items are very diversified. I have tried something different each visit (which have been many)  and have never been disappointed, but very pleased, as well as everyone in our party.The carmelized broiled grapefruit on their breakfast/lunch menu is a winner; the coffee cake is outstanding and their entrees are equally as good. Kudos to Managers Doug and Nate and their staff.  They are a very well-trained crew and do an outstanding job.  This is definitely on our list of favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Looooove this place. The food is good, the ambiance is great, the Bloody Mary cart is quite a treat, the open kitchen style is intriguing and the aroma of the wood burning is a bonus. I love to stop by when I'm in town and always recommend this place to friends whenever they're in Phoenix. Worth the drive and the wait."}
{"text":"The decor is adorbs! On trend w the other hipster spots coming up. Came here for dinner w some friends and I can't say I was wowed by the food. Ordered the scallops and my boo ordered the short ribs. He enjoyed his dish but he's easier to please than me. My scallops were cooked well but I think it lacked dimension. Probably bc I told the waitress to omit the raisin based sauce on it... But she told me it wouldn't take too much away from the dish... Think she was wrong on that one. Another let down was the poppets... They put emphasis on this item on the menu so I was disappointed that no one at our table of 4 enjoyed it. 

Later that week I spoke to several ppl who have been here and they had one thing in common to say about The Henry... \"You don't go there for dinner, you go there for their brunch menu.\"

Haha whoopsies... Well at least now I know..."}
{"text":"First impression, amazing! My friend joyce and I sat down in the lounge and had a great view of the restaurant. 
Our server Jordan, immediately suggested the Bloody Mary cart to begin with.  Miguel , made great suggestions for our drinks.  Menu was festive and a great difference than the normal Scottsdale / Phoenix menu. 
We highly suggest this smashed avocado egg toast. Joyce is salmon was fabulous. Highly suggest the fig vodka mule    But the feature was our server Jordan. On top of everything, great suggestions , and so attentive. 
In addition, the manager , Michael , was also incredible.  
Such a pleasure to enjoy a great meal and experience.  
We will for certain be back and will only ask for Jordan."}
{"text":"If you're looking to wind down with some late-night comfort food in a cozy setting after a night out with your friends, this is not the diner you're looking for.

Leave it to the Cosmopolitan to modernize and elevate the concept of the Vegas-strip hotel institutions, including the 24-hour diner. What they've done to buffets (see: Wicked Spoon), they've unnecessarily done to the 24-hour diner. This place should've been placed somewhere else, not right next to the bar blasting club hits- it's like an extension of Marquee night club situated right behind you vibrating the brulee off your creme. Not cool.

Otherwise, the staff is as good as any good restaurant staff, and the quality of the food is decent, at least in presentation alone. Variety of classic dishes at 2 in the morning don't disappoint. The seating and decor is actually charming in an old-school 30's/40's Gatsby way. Prices are typical Vegas expensive, but where else can you sit down and eat like this on the strip? Oh yeah, all the other big hotels on the strip.

Many other restaurants in the Cosmopolitan are definitely worthy of 5 stars (a few beyond 5-stars if I could), but The Henry is one you can skip."}
{"text":"Love this place the breakfast burrito was the best I've ever had anywhere and my husband loved the short rib Benedict. The service was excellent and my favorite part was the atmosphere and decor can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday morning/afternoon (got there at 11:30 and ate around 12:00) and had about a 30 minute wait.  We chose this place based on a recommendation from a friend.  During our wait we walked through to the coffee shop and had a chai, a mocha, and shared a (giant) peanut butter/chocolate rice krispy treat.

Our server was AWESOME!  I asked for no bacon on my egg sandwich, and he immediately offered the bacon as a side to my bf.  (Major points.)  He noted we already had drinks from the coffee shop and asked if we would like additional beverages or if we would like new ones.  He shared his opinions on some of the items we ordered (bruleed grapefruit is a WIN, people!) and was attentive but not annoying through the whole meal.

They serve their chicken fried chicken a bit differently than most places (biscuits, chicken, fried egg on top).  At first bf wasn't sure... and then he ate it \"as served\" and it was gone in under 10 minutes.  ALL OF IT.  I ordered the egg sandwich, as I previously mentioned, without bacon and it was SOOOO delish.  I will say the presentation had me skeptical (the bread looks hard).  The bread is melt-in-your-mouth amazing!  The side of breakfast potatoes were just right.  Again, don't skip the bruleed grapefruit side though!

We will be back.  It's a bit of a \"treat\" because it's not super cheap... but it is worth the Saturday morning breakfast wait (more so than most other places).  Yum!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great atmosphere, amazing food. The cheddar biscuits are so good, the carrot cake pancake is to die for! The Bloody Mary bar is creative and fancy to try, comes with lots of yummy things inside. This place is detailed down to every inch . So cute, the patio out back is fun for brunch and big parties! The Mediterranean salad was delicious! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast at 4:00 AM.  The scrambled eggs & wheat toast were extremely tasty.  One of the best breakfasts I've ever had.  A definite must try if you are staying at the hotel."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a gorgeous day out and had a good time! This was my first time dining here, but I've heard good things about their coffee shop portion also, so I'll make sure to check that out another time.

When I first walked in, I was honestly very confused where to go. There weren't clear signs on where to go, and there were 3 different entrance doors. I eventually found the 'front desk' area and got a table. The place is HUGE, with lots of seating indoors and outdoors. The decor is beautiful and definitely gives the place personality.

For brunch, I ordered the original egg sandwich ($11) that comes with potatoes. The sandwich was a decent serving size and I enjoyed it! I also had The Cleo (iced) for my morning coffee--the almond milk with hazelnut tasted so good, that I got a second glass of it!

Overall, this was a positive first impression. The menu items are a bit pricy, but I'd be open to trying this place again for the lunch or dinner menu."}
{"text":"Affordable breakfast and every item was made to order and delicious. We tried the pancakes , and my date had the omelet . Our waiter was amazing and we only had a 10 minute wait which is unheard of in a casino"}
{"text":"Good breakfast on the first floor of the Aria closest to the strip street entrance. Coffee was good, food was good. Portions aren't not huge here like a traditional breakfast place. Definitely on the more expensive side compared to your regular diner breakfast. Quality was worth it and I would return."}
{"text":"I had fish n chips with a draft. It's ok but nothing rave about. I will try something else or just try Heinstein at the same hotel next time.

Price level is not crazily high that has me in the first place for an idea about this place."}
{"text":"Great spot to grab late lunch. Most places were closed at 2 so I came across The Henry located in the Cosmopolitan. I had the Buffalo Chicken wrap with the truffle tater tots and it was delicious. The waitress was very nice and quick."}
{"text":"THE KOREAN STYLE SKIRT STEAK IS THE BEST THING ON THE MENU. I ordered it for breakfast but I didn't care because I don't like breakfast food and this was the absolute best substitute. So tender and amazing. The flavors were so powerful. I figured that they would half ass my meal because it was breakfast time but that for sure was not the case. Because of this meal the Henry is now my favorite restaurant"}
{"text":"I've been to this establishment a few times and all has gone well. The food is great and the service is pretty good. it is a little on the expensive side for food that is no better than Matts Big Breakfast downtown Phoenix... anyways when I went to the Henry on Mother's Day, they told me they were not excepting walks Ins. I was speaking with a hostess and then the manager just jumps in and says \"well if you want to wait it would be a 3 hour wait\"... a 3 hour wait wow.. I was a little taken back.. I was with my wife, my mother, my grandmother and my children.. I wasn't going to have them wait for 3 hours.. manager lady said she would see what she could do about accommodating us and asked to give her a few minutes. I said ok. I gave her 15 minutes. I went back inside and she said she needed more time to even see if she could seat us an hour later.. At that point I had had enough and took my family to the cheese cake factory where we were seated in 10 minutes..."}
{"text":"Customer services was top notch!! Outstanding!!  Food was good and the hash brown potato cake was delicious.  Pricy for what you got but the breakfast was good.

Fresh squeezed orange juice was good.  My only complaint was $30 for breakfast was expensive....and not even a buffet."}
{"text":"This may be the best coffee shop in America

Get the chicken fried steak.  Unreal!   If you are an  aficionado I highly recommend this. I'll post a picture...

And pretty much everything else my party got was outstanding. Give it a whirl when in Viva"}
{"text":"Visited this place for my sister's bachelorette party and it was top notch. Great food, great service awesome atmosphere and the drinks were AMAZING!!! We got a reservation for 20, which required us to pay in advance and sign a contract. Make sure to collect money in advance because they will not change the reservation number once you sign. They were definitely worked with us considering that half our party was an hour and a half late. Gustavo was awesome, he definitely handled our group well
Long Island was the best I ever had, no competition. Food was yummy, I had the fish and chips which were cooked perfectly, great flavor, and just the right amount of crispiness and the fries topped it off. I sampled the burger and tots, which by the way were outstanding. Cooked to the T. Caesar salad was good, but I had better.
For dessert we had the red velvet cheesecake, talk about mouthgasim. Definitely wish I ate more of it.
 Apparently, each level of the Cosmopolitan has its own special drink that they make which is pretty cool. Level one was of course the Cosmo, to die for. 
Would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"The Short Rib Eggs Benedict is everything. Not a big ribs fan so I was hesitant but am so happy I got it."}
{"text":"Really Cool place! We visited for brunch and I had one of the best summer brunch experiences I have had in Phoenix. By summer, I mean indoors. The interior of this place has a shabby chic vibe.

The Carrot Cake pancakes were wonderful. A great dish to order with a group and share will have something a bit more savory to balance the richness of the dish. Also had a pomegranate alcoholic drink which was great."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance here. It is a great place for a date or a group dinner. The food is really good as well. Definitely try their sides."}
{"text":"Our daughter treated her Mom to a dinner here for Mother's Day, and let my son and I tag along. She treated us as well, as it turned out. She loves this place, and I love trying new places, so we were all excited about the dinner. 
Service was sharp, drink orders arrived promptly followed by the smoked salmon appetizer. Very good. Entrées included burgers, blackened chicken, and a pasta dish with Brussel sprouts and a cream sauce. We all enjoyed the dishes. Too full for dessert and had a place to be so we didn't linger long. A great place for a casual dinner or a special occasion, we'll be back. 
The only down side is that I was not wowed by the menu. I found something I enjoyed, so was happy. But I love the places that I have such a hard time ordering because everything looks good, and that wasn't the case for me here."}
{"text":"For those who don't know, almost every casino has at least one 24-hour restaurant.  In the old days, it was just a diner where you could get a mediocre burger, or a couple fried eggs,at 3am.  For most of the casinos, these places still serve up mostly uninspiring eats.  There are, IMHO, only 3 really good ones that are not only worth stopping by at 3am, but also worth seeking out at any hour of the day.  And The Henry is the most centrally located of the three, so we end up eating here on most trips. Admittedly, usually at 3am though.  (The other 2, for the record, are the fantastic Citizens @ Mandalay Bay and Grand Lux Cafe @ Venetian and Palazzo.)
The Henry has a much more upscale feel than a standard diner, with plush leather booths and chairs, nice silver, and cloth napkins.  The menu is simple, but it has the essentials: burgers, breakfast anytime, etc.  My favorite item is, by far, the French Dip.  Nicely toasted, never soggy on the bottom, bun, quality beef, and a delicious, not-to-salty au jus.  If you are a first timer, you should absolutely try the truffle tater tots with whatever you get, although their basic fries are excellent as well.  They have a few fun specialty cocktails as well, and their location, right near the north entrance is both convenient, as well as great for people watching  or listening to the music coming from the bar next door.  (It can be noisy late night, but that can be part of the fun.  Just be aware, its often not a quiet place to eat.)"}
{"text":"Piss poor service again tonight and not the first time at The Henry. I told the male bartender at the bar on March 21 at 6:40pm strait off I only had an hour and I needed a glass of water. I also pointed to some things in the menu I had questions on but still no water until I spoke up a 2nd time. I ordered to side items for dinner to make it easy and quick because I had to get back to an event I was attending. When the order came from the running server I asked for more ketchup. I waited and waited, finished up my order and wanted to pay. I brought up the issue with female bartender on how disappointed I was at the running server for such a minuety item and I was just spent. The food really would have tasted better with ketchup but oh well i didn't Finnish it all cus I lost my appetite. No tip was remotely left..."}
{"text":"Steak like chewing gum, price to high for what you get. Simple and small and boring plates, some steak with lots of cilantro and fries,  way overpriced. We eat dinner, it was so fast in half an hour we were back in the car! Poor daughter didnt have a nice birthday dinner..."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place in our hotel besides the jam packed egg slut at our Cosmopolitan hotel for breakfast.  A quick Yelp search revealed this restaurant, and we were relieved that they had no wait and we were able to sit down and relax together.  Everything was all around amazing! Our server was on top of it, and provided excellent service.  He was nice, friendly and efficient.  Shout out to our waiter Larry!  Liked the little details, such as big coffee cup mugs and cute container that held the sugar packets.  

Now, on to the food.  Top notch breakfast items..  Must get the banana bread! (It's a choice for a side). After the first bite, I was instantly blown away how delicious it was.  We all ordered different things, and everything was perfection.  Portions were large. What stood out to me, was that the eggs were perfectly cooked and fluffy.  Their coffee was giving me life, much needed after a long night of partying!  It was a nice, relaxed, quality meal and I want to come back again soon!

The only thing that I would have to shy away from though, is the ham.  It just didn't do it for me, tasted dry and cold.  Looked better than it tasted, that's for sure..."}
{"text":":: HIGHLY RECOMMEND :: 

Awesome food!  I had the quinoa burrito and it was a very healthy option.

My friend who lives in the area had heard great things about it and it was all three of our first times trying The Henry."}
{"text":"My kids have always been to the Henry for coffee, breakfast and lunch. So they wanted us to try it. Dinner it was. 

After getting out of the parking lot, I hate to say it but I was a little confused. The front door doesn't look like their main entrance but it was. Double glass doors. Once inside, there's a coffee bar, tables, and a lounge area with chairs, couches, and tables but where's the hostess stand? Had to find it and it was to the far left. Looks like a normal table with a couple of computers on it. Very confusing at first. I'm just used to being greeted once I walk in the door. Oh well. 

I guess I understand this after figuring out this place. It's what I call modern looking, trendy, and for us old people it's hip. Not a lot of old people and definitely not families with small kids. It's loud. It's the place to be seen. 

We had to wait to be seated and they seat you at your reservation time. Felt a little blowoff at the time but we relaxed at their lounge area. Surprisingly, they remembered us and came to get us when our table was ready. Didn't need to carry around a buzzer or get paged. Very nice that they remembered. 

We started out with the short rib potstickers. Very surprised. Really good. Short rib was very tender. Moist. Very tasty. It's soaked in soy sauce. Very very good. 

After that, we had their kale & apple salad. We had them split the order. Even half was a pretty good size that you can split with someone. The kale was tender with slices of apple, cubes of cheddar, and some oranges. It was a very good salad. Really enjoyed this and would recommend. 

I decided to have their Saturday night special. Honey-Tamarind glazed pork ribs. The ribs were fall off the bone and very good. They were a little fatty but pretty good. They give you six ribs with cabbage slaw and fried rice. Side don't make sense but it worked pretty good. The slaw was pretty good. Not bad but the thing that stood out to me was the fried rice. Had a nice kick to it. Spicy fried rice. A first but really good. 

Seemed like my wife and everyone else got the braised short ribs. The dish seemed small but was very filling to everyone. The short ribs were very tender. Moist and tasty. Everyone enjoyed them. 

To end our meal, I had the Cleo which was an expresso with almond milk & hazelnut. Little sweet but very good. Also, had the warm Croissant bread pudding which came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Really good and enjoyed this very much. 

Service was pretty good. Our waiter greeted us right away and got us our drinks fairly quickly. Water cups were filled and our food was brought out quickly. I know the place was very busy so our server was business as usual. He did know the menu very well and did give us some really good recommendations. 

So overall, really good meal. Good service and good food. Ambiance was very trendy, hip, and loud. Have to talk over all the other tables but I have to say it was a very relaxing meal. Very enjoyable. Enjoy and have fun. We did."}
{"text":"Fantastic food all around. I love my hanger steak salad. steak was cooked to perfection and the seasoning? yum! Everyone at our table was quite happy with their dishes. If you want to stay away from the \"restaurant row\" at Cosmo and still want to catch great food, this is the spot. 

We also loved our own little private booth too. Good atmosphere for conversation."}
{"text":"We have stayed at the cosmopolitan almost every time  we are in Las Vegas, being that it is one of our favorite places, however we have never been to The Henry until this last time. They are always so crewed so we venture else where, I am so glad we stopped by this time and twice. 

We came for lunch and for breakfast the following day both very excellent our service was great the staff was so nice and recommend drinks to try. 

I had the kitchen Sink Salad had a bit of everything very big portions, with smoked turkey, ham, hard-boiled egg, tomatoes, cucumbers, avocado, cheddar cheese, with red wine vinaigrette. It was very delicious and hard to finishes being that the portions are definitely easily shareable.

We also tried the Tater Tot Nachos, which are a must try brassed short ribs, jalapeños, cheese sauce, pico de Gallo, sour cream. These are amazing you have to try them if you come here. 

And the boyfriend got the Henry Burger bacon jam, cheddar cheese, special sauce, sesame seed brioche bun. Which He assured me it was very delicious. 


And then when we came for breakfast I of course had the Signature short rib Benedict - braised short rib, soft poached eggs, hollandaise, hashbrowns, excellent choice for breakfast if your looking for a rich and filling meal this is definitely the option you wan to pick. 

And the boyfriend has the Chilaquiles style scramble - crispy tortillas, peppers, onions, cilantro, chorizo, quest fresco. 

Both were excellent size portions and very filling definitely recommend you check this place out."}
{"text":"Was there for a breakfast meeting.  Better think continental because even though the food was good there wasn't much of a selection. No table service until 11AM.  Coffee was pretty good. Place was pretty busy with business people."}
{"text":"I love this place. Packed or empty, service is great. Weekend brunch and Bloody Mary carts are the best thing! I recommend this place, but make sure you make reservations before you go on a weekend to ensure quick seating."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and beautiful people watching.  Had the carrot cake pancakes with a  side of bacon, potatos and eggs.  All very tasty especially the potatos which were spiced just right.  Great service.  Our highest compliment, \"We will be back.\""}
{"text":"I've been here twice:  once for breakfast and once for dinner.  I didn't like their breakfast menu, but their coffee was good.  Dinner was a much better experience.  Great food and drinks, and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Date/Time:  Sunday - 3am
Occasion:  Post-Marquee munching
Party of: Five
Location:  Modern, Contemporary look with dim lighting. Super comfy seating!
Ordered:  French Onion Soup, Buffalo Chicken Wings, and Fish & Chips
Total incl gratuity: ~$40

Somehow stumbled into Henry's after an eventful night at Marquee.  I wasn't ultra hungry, just wanted something nice and warm in my tummy.  Opted for the french onion soup and boy was I glad I did.  It was so delicious.  The broth was incredibly rich.  Cheese perfectly melted atop the soaked crouton.  I definitely recommend it!  I had the hankering for chicken wings but when it arrived, I wasn't feeling it so much so I only had one.  It was a little dry; nothing special.  

Service is minimal although they definitely do their job.  It was quite busy at 3am but then again it was a Saturday night - fourth of July weekend and well, it is Vegas, so I'm sure everyone is there satisfying their cravings."}
{"text":"Fun, wide open space.  Courteous service.  The chopped turkey salad was delicious.  Lots of flavor.  The poppy seeds actually contributed to the deliciousness.  The tortilla soup had a nice flavor, but it was missing tortillas."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp on a trip to Phoenix.  Great place for breakfast... super healthy ingredients if your looking for that.  A very interesting decor.  Kind of southern, eclectic, down home ish. But not cluttered and done tastefully. 

I had the french toast. Really good but didn't come with butter.  I know!  Kind of the new thing... But had to ask for butter.  Full plate of french toast and filling. 
Everything was really good.

You can get a latte to go from the coffee shop inside... get a pastry for take out.

WHEN I LEFT I WAS THINKING: Great find on a quick trip to Phoenix."}
{"text":"I swung in here prior to the group meet over at Bond. This is nice vibe... certainly contrasting the opposing flashy LED spectacle of Bond.

Perching up at the bar, I settle in. Service from the 2 gentleman bartenders was decent. Good TV sports.

I go for the awesome salad with beets(?) in it. So tasty! Plus 2 Julip cocktails (one neat, as a mistake for water o_O)... whooaa."}
{"text":"I read a review on Yelp about how good their French Dip sandwich is and really wanted to try it, but it was the weekend and their brunch menu is served until 5pm. Oh well, the build your own burger made up for it. The shoestring fries are delicious! The service was a bit but slow although we waited less than 10 minutes for a party of 5 and this was after waiting over 30 minutes at Holstein's upstairs. Definitely glad we came here instead. Left full and satisfied. If you're hungry, order the spinach artichoke dip for a starter. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Love this place, their fresh squeezed grapefruit juice is probably one of the best I've had in a while, the place is relaxing, alive and refreshing, perfect spot for brunch."}
{"text":"This place is a must. Their garlic Bloody Mary's are unparalleled. Their breakfast is amazing. You won't regret anything you order."}
{"text":"On my last visit to Las Vegas, I had breakfast at the Henry on two separate occasions.  The Henry has been a regular breakfast stop every time I'd stayed at the Cosmopolitan.  It had been, up until now, a model of consistency given its high-end 24-hour casino diner status.  However, both visits on this trip provided wildly different experiences, which also offered two distinct data points indicating that things are amiss at the Henry.

First, good, consistent service has noticeably slipped.  On Saturday morning around 11am with a party of six, our service was fast, friendly and attentive.  On Tuesday morning around 10am, service was largely AWOL as it took over 25 minutes for our breakfasts to come out after placing our orders with no interim stops at our table by our server to check up on us or to explain/apologize for the excessive wait for our food.  Second, the food quality, execution, and portion sizes have nosedived.  I had the Short Rib Benedict ($19) on Saturday.  While it was still a tender, flavorful, and savory hunk of meat, it was noticeably a much smaller portion than I'd received on previous trips to the Henry.  The short rib isn't served atop an English muffin, but instead a potato hash.  However, this time the hash was desiccated, crispy, flavorless, and not very appetizing.  It wasn't a good result for this previously awesome dish.  On Tuesday, I had the Breakfast Burrito ($16).  It, too, was noticeably smaller than I remembered.  More damning was that after the excessive wait to get it, the burrito was only warm, not hot, and seemingly soggy and limp.  It had likely sat around for a while before being brought out to me.  However, the ultimate failure was that I bit into a foreign object, an inch-long sliver of clear plastic, found in the center of my burrito.  While the server did the right (and only) thing and took my burrito of our bill, it was really too late to recover from an awful experience.   At least the Illy coffee that they serve was good and hot on both visits.

Everyone has an off day.  That said, the slippage at the Henry is painfully apparent.  While I will stay at the Cosmopolitan again, the same can't be said about a return visit to the Henry."}
{"text":"Truffle tater tots.

Belgian waffle.

Short rib benedict.

As far as 24 hour Vegas cafes go, The Henry delivers exactly what you expect; late night, after the club, salty, fried goodness to soak up the alcohol and early morning hangover cures, all served up with mediocre service and a pretty steep price. When all other options are non existent, this place will do. 

Truffle tater tots.  That is all."}
{"text":"Came here on Saturday morning to celebrate my granddaughter's birthday. I had never been here before but since it was a Fox restaurant, I wasn't worried. The restaurant was packed but not too noisy. Very open, upscale feeling. Our waiter was super attentive without being annoying. I got the bagel & lox. I needed extra cream cheese & he brought it right away. Then i wanted more onion. Again, it was brought right away. My family had eggs & potatoes. I tasted the potatoes....crunchy & delicious. My granddaughter, who is a connoisseur of anything sweet, said the ice cream (I believe it was salted caramel) was really really good. All in all it was a nice experience & will definitely return."}
{"text":"We are breakfast here on a Saturday morning. It was busy so we had to sit outside. The patio was cute and offered shade under umbrellas. The flies were kind of annoying though. Our server was nice but we waited a long time to have our orders taken, and he rarely came back to refill our drinks. I ordered a coffee cake, but it was really dry. Did not care for it very much. I also had eggs with turkey sausage and spinach - that was delicious! I would have to try The Henry again to see if service/quality improves, but for me I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Saw many people post IG pictures and posting things on yelp.. I give it a 3.5 out of 5..when we arrived it wasn't quite open yet but the coffee bar was open.. they had selected breakfast menu you could order along with  pastries which looked delicious.. as soon as we got seated we ordered the short ribs dumpling, chicken fried chicken (biscuits and gravy) and cheddar popovers.. for the most part everything was good but the short ribs, we weren't expecting it to taste the way it did.. it wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing either.. I didn't like the sauce they served it with wasn't served on the side.. they had the sauce and the dumplings all in the same bowl.. we probably will be back to try their other items on the menu but won't be ordering the dumplings again.. and wished they gave a lil more gravy with the chicken fried chicken .. last thing I have to say is our server was good in the beginning, attentive.. but as soon as we got our food he stopped coming around.. it wasn't to busy yet so we were kinda waiting for a bit before we get a box and our check.."}
{"text":"Larry was a great server! Very attentive and polite. This restaurant also has nice decor, I recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Tried \"The Henry\" in the Cosmopolitan Hotel & Casino for b-fast this morning.  We were looking for a quieter alternative to the bustling Cafe Bellagio next door.  

We built our own veggie omelets from the offerings including fresh mushrooms, avocado, onions, Monterey Jack and opted for the fresh tomato slices in lieu of their famous hash browns.  The omelette was light, fluffy and delicious although I would have expected more ingredients inside.

Our server's demeanor was upbeat and his service was quick and efficient.  A request for extra ketchup was answered in under 60 seconds.

Overall, a solid choice for a upscale breakfast only 25 paces off the strip."}
{"text":"Let me just start out by saying I only Yelp when things are REALLY good or REALLY bad. There's no point to review something mediocre. I'll also say my husband and I consider ourselves major \"foodies\". We currently live in Houston, TX, where there is some of the best food in the country. It has been a REALLY long time since I was this impressed with a restaurant. The service, drinks, food, atmosphere, EVERYTHING was fabulous! We started with the short rib potstickers and they were splendid (and that's saying something considering we know good beef). The truffle fries were a good addition to the appetizer selection! Our waiter was friendly, attentive but also let us enjoy our company without over doing it. The main plates, from the bolognese, scallops, and broccoli cheddar tortelli, were delicious! Highly impressive! We ended the night with the chocolate peanut butter molten cake, devine! I can't say one negative thing about The Henry! Tomorrow I'm coming back in the morning for their coffee and pastry experience. Scottsdale, you nailed it with this restaurant and we will be back!"}
{"text":"First experience didn't go very well but chucked it to the fact they were brand new. Waited a year to come back and glad we did. Food was amazing. The chicken and biscuits, TO DIE FOR. Only thing better than the food was the service from both the server and the Manager Will."}
{"text":"Came in for the Labor Day FRC special of 25% off your total bill! My husband and I ordered a chocolate croissant and coffees to start. I asked for it to be warmed up and it came to the table warm and crispy in the top and soggy on the bottom...not sure how that was accomplished. Microwave? The service was erratic and disorganized, we waited for about 20 minutes for our drinks from the bar and coffee bar...it seemed they did not expect the large crowds the holiday produced. Then the bacon we ordered for breakfast was so dry & over done it was inedible - seemed like they made it in large batches and it just sat. We have been to The Henry several times before and loved our experience but this was a BIG misstep in our expectation of what we have come to love about The Henry!! So sad!"}
{"text":"Really good food but terrible terrible service and turn around time. It literally took 2 hours for the food to come out, right when we came to get up and leave finally after waiting hours she brought it out and said \" sorry it took so long\" but honestly you would think that they would offer like desert on the house or something at least. So i give the service like 1 star and food 4 stars which makes it 3 stars so there."}
{"text":"I had a great time dining at The Henry. The place is huge, and the decor is interesting and beautiful. We sat in the patio during this perfect time of the year. 

We had the meatball soup and kale and garlic dip. The soup was very good, and the dip had an overpowering lemon taste, which I was not a fan of. As an entree, my boyfriend and I had the Korean Skirt Steak and the Short Rib. The Korean Skirt Steak was delicious, and it comes with rice that's a bit spicy but very good.

Overall, it was a great dining experience."}
{"text":"This is a really cute restaurant when you walk in. We went with friends for a birthday and had a nice table. This place is a little pricey but most everyone enjoyed their food. I was a little disappointed because I ordered the quinoa tacos and had an allergic reaction to something in the recipe so I didn't get to eat much. I was surprised they didn't offer to take it off the bill... Kind of made me not want to go back."}
{"text":"Just ok, there are much better places on the Strip for a good dinner."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices and great food. Service was quick and the food was fresh. Definitely recommend the corned beef reuben and truffle tater tots."}
{"text":"Fun environment! My favorites are the short rib potstickers and the Korean skirt steak. I wouldn't come for breakfast/ brunch, the selection isn't great."}
{"text":"It was the World Series. The Giants were playing. How on earth could we miss the game?!?!?

After a bit of wandering, we discovered this place. We sat at the bar, ordered dinner, and watched our beloved team trounce the Tigers. 

The place is swank, the service is friendly, and the food is fine. Nothing stands out as stellar, but nothing bad either."}
{"text":"A decent place for straight-forward food. 

- Friendly staff 
- Fast service
- Well made menu items
- Reasonable Strip prices

I would return to this restaurant."}
{"text":"It's a feast for the eyes and appetite

The Henry treated my friends and I last night.  We met up for a Thursday evening outing.  We arrived at 7:30 or so and it was busy, but not packed.  We got 3 seats at the bar and were served promptly.  After we ordered our drinks we had a chance to take in the decor which was hipster friendly.  It's a southern themed homey place that resembles a plantation house from the outside.  The people when we arrived were in their 20's, early 30's but as the night went on the crowd thinned out and the crowd became older.  The service was great, but I was a little disappointed that they ran out of their ginger glazed black cod entree.  They must have had a real run on it as it was only 7:45 when they ran out.  Instead, I had the roasted chicken, which was moist and delicious.  The mac and cheese was a little disappointing, but the smashed garlic potato was a hit.  The texture was perfect, slightly cream, and it was  delicious.  The place cleared out about 10 pm, but it was a school night.  I'd definitely recommend The Henry as a good place for happy hour or dinner.  

Summary: Available food is great, service is great, a good location for happy hour and early dinner."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the cinnamon French toast. The meal is 3 cinnamon rolls dipped to make French toast on one side. The bottom is so hard to cut through, I asked for a steak knife. I thought the strip would help soften the bread but it didn't. Coffee is $5 for a cup...you're better off visiting the Starbucks. The staff was friendly; however the hostess greatly misinformed wait times. I was told 5min but waited nearly 20. Make a quick reservation before leaving your room to come eat. Hope this review is helpful!"}
{"text":"Have been here 10+ times and have had pretty good experiences each time. Prices are what you would expect for this area. Friendly staff and great atmosphere. Highly recommend the spicy sausage scramble for breakfast - lots of crumbled sausage, and fresh veggies along with breakfast potatoes."}
{"text":"After hearing a coworker rave about this place, decided to stop by for brunch before making the shitty drive back home.  Arrived at around 12 (originally planned for 11:30 but I was stuck on the craps table) to find hella people waiting for a table.  Luckily we only had to wait 10 mins before being seated.  

Decided on the short rib benedict http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Er8DpPwf_lHHv64ncWhD8g?selected=qa6seKzkxOrekZK_GPx1cg#lSAtYK2xsdWPwdBeEt-wgw and a side of the truffle tater tots http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Er8DpPwf_lHHv64ncWhD8g?selected=qa6seKzkxOrekZK_GPx1cg#Z8UAZzKte2Q8T8PiesBC7Q.  The short rib benedict was unique and definitely tasty but was pretty salty.  The crispy potato cake was more of a mush which was pretty disappointing.  Would've tasted better and offered a nice contrasting texture if they had cooked the potatoes longer.  The biggest disappointment was definitely the truffle tots, nothing special at all.  I think the tater tots at dog haus taste as good if not better.

Service was prompt and the waiter was definitely friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely perfect setting for my daughter's bridal shower, the private room was perfectly set up, black chairs only as requested, everything done to my satisfaction and more!  Lisa Nelson was a delight to work with, she did everything possible to make it just perfect for me.  Always making sure I was in the know and that I got my money's worth.  Nate, the manager, was always making sure I was happy and things were going as planned.  The servers were a delight, always making sure drinks were filled, plates were removed, etc.  The presentation of the food buffet was gorgeous, dishes were marked as what it was, food and desserts were brought out on time, it was perfect.  No one rushed us out of the room, was sat and talked as people started to leave, and we didn't feel rushed at all.  

I would return to eat there, for their delicious food, great service, and lovely setting....  you made the bridal shower a perfect success.... Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast.  Great service.  The short rib Benedict was incredible.  Most likely the best breakfast I've ever had."}
{"text":"I have to start out by saying our waitress was phenomenal. She was so witty, sweet, and funny. We came with friends that recommended the place and had dined here previously. This was our first time here and we will definitely be back. I had the chilean sea bass and completely cleared my plate. We all enjoyed our meal and cocktails so much so of course we had to end the night with dessert. The bread pudding was ahhmazing. 

We stayed pretty late and never felt rushed. Our waitress had the best timing. Cant wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Sam Fox, the man knows what he's doing.  The Henry follows the model of all his other restaurants with a more upscale neighborhood feel - above average food at a price point just a tad higher than the competition.  Add the cool atmosphere and some little personal touches, and that's what makes this man so successful.

My wife thinks this is the best brunch in the Valley.  It is, indeed, a very good brunch.  They have a Bloody Mary cart available to make your own Bloody Mary Creation.  My wife raves, RAVES, about the carrot cake pancakes.  It is thick and cakey and not too sweet and really quite tasty.  I opt for savory dishes and have had the chicken fried chicken (crispy and good), the original egg sandwich (very messy, filling, and good), and the Le Pig sandwich (actually lighter than the egg sandwich and also quite tasty.)

Get the popovers.  Cheesy, salty, with ham butter.  Get them all the time.

The roasted chicken with sides is one of the better roast chicken dishes we've had (not including Peruvian or Cuban chicken, both superior.)  The roast chicken here compares well with the chicken at Ocotillo, moist and flavorful.  I would skip the Korean style skirt steak.  It's barely reminiscent of Korean food (except for a hint of smokiness in the meat) and was under-seasoned for something that bills itself as Korean, especially in the meat department.  My wife often gets the branzino, which she has always enjoyed - never overcooked.  And the pork chop here is huge.  It is not butterflied and still cooked well all the way through.  The cauliflower \"polenta\" is one of the best side dishes I've ever had.

Get lots of drinks too.  Their cocktails are pretty tasty, they have a decent brown liquor selection (not as good as The Gladly), and there are enough wines on their list to pair with whatever is on the menu.

Good solid food, upscale local joint, one of the best concepts that Fox has to offer."}
{"text":"The Henry is a classy, unique, up-scale restaurant that makes Phoenix a better place. The general atmosphere is relaxed and personal. The staff is fantastic and very professional while the food is high quality. Katherine, a waitress, was simply a gem while serving our entire party, making this a joyful experience. On top of having great quality, reasonably-priced food, The Henry also offers an excellent selection of coffee drinks-the Wildflower and Gibraltar are especially good. Bustin a fat vibe at the Henry is always an A1 option."}
{"text":"The Henry is The Cosmopolitan's 24-hour restaurant, and while they do have a \"limited\" late night menu, we found it just about perfect. It's a small restaurant, facing right into the entrance of the casino floor, and without much separating you from the noise and passersby - so it's fantastic for people-watching. The service is great, the bar menu is fun, and they have a nice mix of breakfast food, burgers, and appetizers overnight. We went a few hours post-race, after finding a giant line at Café Vettro and lots of people angry about the limited late-night food options on a Sunday. Yes, it was 2am... but it's Vegas!

His plate: Buffalo Style Chicken Wings, fries

Her plate: \"The Henry\" breakfast - three eggs (scrambled), chicken apple sausage, sourdough toast, and breakfast potato; Mambo Italiano - garlic roasted vodka, house made Bloody Mary mix, basil

The drink section of the menu is called \"Peace Offerings\" and is full of fun options, though I'm glad I got the Mambo Italiano - it was great! It's also worth noting that the other breakfast meat choices were slab bacon, smoked ham, country sausage, or taylor ham - quite a nice selection.

This was a perfect post-race meal - the eggs were nicely cooked, the chicken apple sausage was delicious, and what more can I ask for than fresh sourdough toast? D's wings were good, and the fries were nice and fresh. When we come back to Vegas, this'll be our late-night favorite, I'm sure - much better food and more fun than Café Vettro, and the prices are the same."}
{"text":"Our go to place for breakfast while staying in the Cosmopolitan.  Service is always good Larry has waited on us a couple of times and is very personable.  They do have healthy choices and that's nice.  I love the potato/hash brown casserole.  Steak and eggs wow this is a huge ribeye steak!  Fruit plate is good but the bowl of berries is a better value.  Oj is yummy fresh squeezed and shaken till chilled."}
{"text":"Every time I go here, I am super impressed by the food. We always come for breakfast and my favorites include: the avocado toast, the huevos rancheros and my favorite, the caramel apple French toast! The coffee is also amazing! Make sure to try the The Cleo."}
{"text":"This place gets a higher rating for the location and ambiance than the food. I've never been overly impressed with my dishes here. That said I haven't really been disappointed either. They have some great breakfast items for Sunday brunch. They also have a good coffee stand and a killer working environment. If you need a place out of the house for a meet and greet or to knock out some work the venue can't be beat for a casual meeting or getting some focus in."}
{"text":"Nothing beats good tasting wings and braised beef loaded tater tots at 3 am in Vegas. Service was fast and attentive. I absolutely love this place!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! Food was out of this world and the service was very attentive. Server was helpful and very knowledgeable about the menu and made great suggestions. Food was the best part of the meal! Really enjoyed dinner with my wife and we will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm always up for a new experience. Recently a business associate, who hangs at some very cool places, suggested a meeting at a place with another associate. While I know the FOX Group to be one of THE BEST operations around, I hadn't heard of The Henry so... I was ready. (OK, I don't get out as much as I should)

I got there early and was overly impressed that Phoenix would have such a cool place. Very industrial look mixed with some vintage furniture and enough modern touches to keep it interesting, and comfortable. I thought, with FOX's attention to detail and quality, I knew  THIS is going to be nice.

My associate arrived and asked for \"his table\" in the back. A booth against the back wall that was quiet enough to have our small business meet and greet. As expected, the service was impeccable, and very tolerant as our business gathering of 3 took up some table space during lunch. It definitely warranted a large tip for her patience and gracious service.

And have got to say that the Pastrami sammy was great! Lean but juicy, with a terrific crunchy slaw, tangy swiss and aioli. Generally for me, the bread is there just to hold everything together, so I'm not overly excited about it (unless it's a great \"make you pucker\" San Fran sourdough) but the pretzel roll was just enough without being \"bready,\" distracting, and hiding the goodies inside. The accompanying salad had a light dressing and, while looking a lot like terrific lawn clippings, (just an observation NOT a complaint) it was great addition and compliment to the sandwich.

Combining the class of this place, the most intriguing and interesting surroundings, the professional waitstaff (with the greatest smile), the very tasty food at a decent price... and it's on my \"got to go back list.\" A friend wants to take me out for my birthday so... I think I know where dinner will be.

Can't say enough about the atmosphere and professionalism of this place - just what you'd expect from a FOX operation - and can't imagine you'd ever be disappointed. I'm anxious to try happy hour, see how their Long Islands are and dig into my birthday dinner.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Came here with a group and ordered most of the appetizers. The potstickers and guacamole are AMAZING. I ordered the skirt steak with fried rice, and oh man... I was not disappointed. I was actually pleasantly surprised by how great it was! Arnold Palmer was great and next time I need to try their signature drinks. Love the decor and can't wait to come back. I've heard the coffee is fabulous too."}
{"text":"The food was good, we liked the re-fillable sparkling water bottle. The server was very casual and border line annoying. Laughed at our order and made us feel uncomfortable. The lights from the bar next door were really bright and annoying. Overall it was an OK experience."}
{"text":"great bloody mary bar for breakfast.  

They have these fantastic carrot cake pancakes that are unreal. 

Its nice to go to a place that not only has a great vibe but also has really good food.

only bummer is there are no dogs allowed on the main patio which i think they should totally consider."}
{"text":"Walked in today to get my post-convention celebratory breakfast and was blown away by everything about the place! The hostess greeted me warmly and seated me at a booth (A preference I requested)

I was then met by Rochelle. This lady simply rocked. As I ordered eggs benedict, she asked about soft vs medium preference for the poached eggs, knowing that many would perhaps not enjoy the runny whites of the soft poached offered by default.  That was incredible- few servers would be so attentive.

Rochelle's smooth professionalism made me feel like I was in a 4 star restaurant (without all of the stuffiness) rather than a casino lobby comfort food joint. And that felt really good at 6:30am

The eggs benedict came out perfect. A little light on hollandaise, so I asked for a bit more which was given happily at no charge. Oh. My. God. The hollandaise here is so luscious- some of the best I've ever had. Hashbrowns were crisp and well seasoned. The coffee was rich and delicious. 


Bottom line I'd recommend this place to anyone wanting a killer eggs benedict and impeccable but unpretentious service."}
{"text":"Love love love the Henry!  It's the perfect place for any time of day ! Their breakfast , lunch, and dinner menus are all great ! Also love the decor !!! So relaxing !!!"}
{"text":"I have been to the coffee bar and then today for breakfast. I love the coffee bar, with their selection of pastries and cute places to sit inside and out. The restaurant also is very cute with a great atmosphere. It is a little fancy in a way I'm not sure if I like. The service and food for the restaurant were ok, not amazing. I had the apple French Toast, which was good but needed something else, maybe whipped cream. We even asked and they said they don't have any whipped cream in the kitchen (?). Don't they serve hot chocolate? Or don't they cook with cream? You just whip it. Anyway, the kids' breakfast was done well and was a good value, and the servers were nice to the kids which is always a plus. I will definitely want to try this place for dinner. So far, like it, but not terribly impressed."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, lovely atmosphere, highly recommend.  We went on a Saturday night and the attire was dressy casual, there were lots of people in designer jeans and dress shorts and nice sandals.  Everything we had was delicious and I highly recommend the potstickers, the dip, Skirt Steak (which I normally only eat Filet, but I have to say this was tender and delicious, not your normal skirt steak), the braised short ribs and you HAVE to order the Peanut Butter Banana cake - yum, I can still taste it, was so good.  They have many vegetarian options, my friend LOVED the Quinoa Tacos.

It is good for groups, couples, friends, etc.  I saw a family eating on the outdoor patio with their kids(it was early like around 5pm).  Really nice choice and not as expensive as you would think it would be.  Appetizers and salads range from $11-$14.  Entrees from $22.  Well worth it.  It was a bit loud in there, was fine for talking to the friend next to me, but was hard for the person across the table to hear us.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"It was the Saturday after a Friday night out and just what we needed. Good breakfast food. I wouldn't say amazing but the eggs, bacon and cheese hash browns were good. The hash browns were the highlight. 

It's not anything out of the ordinary but a good spot for breakfast if you're staying at the hotel"}
{"text":"only ate there for breakfast so that's all I can comment on but it was awesome.  Loved loved loved the cinnamon roll French toast-super good.  I also had the eggs benedict which was really good.  

Pricy and also know that when they ask if you want \"bacon or potatoes with that\" everything is extra.  But the food and service are both very good but you will get Vegas prices, that's just part of the game."}
{"text":"We had a birthday dinner on Saturday. Service was great, food was good. We got a complimentary birthday dessert. Really liked Their fig mule and The North coffee. Yummm"}
{"text":"Let's make this fleeting moment last forever
So, tell me what you're waiting for?
I'm gonna keep it frozen here forever,
There's no regretting anymore at...The Henry! - Krewella (alive)

I was intrigued by this place because it's one of those 24 hour cafe's at every hotel except this one doesn't have the the looks and feels of one. Already late for lunch, there was no question that the French dip was the way to go, as it came with tater tots with a slight hint of truffle oil! With so many restaurants in Vegas that make you order fries separately with their sandwiches or burgers, this is a huge plus! How many places come with sides with their steaks in Vegas? Exactly my point. Especially since it isn't built into the price, it felt like a great deal here. The french dip tasted great, and we finished all the tater tots. The only thing I wished was that I could choose how the prime rib was cooked, but they said it's already pre-prepared..oh well. 

Again, it's open 24 hours so a great place to come after clubbing/late night fun at the Cosmo. I will be willing to come back anytime next time I'm staying here again as an afternoon/late night option (which will be in the very near future..comped rooms ftw! -although the terrace's aren't fun in the cold winter nights!!)"}
{"text":"My husband called around noon on a Sunday and was told there would probably be a half an hour wait and when we arrived we were told an hour and a half. So we decided to wait and have drinks on the patio. About an hour later my husband went up to check with the hostess to see how much longer we would be waiting because  he saw many empty tables and not many people waiting, he was barked at by the hostess that she told him it would be an hour and 45 min and that's how long we would be waiting. He responded that we were told an hour and half. All the hostesses were very rude and acted like they couldn't be bothered to talk to anybody. I thought that a requirement for hostessing was to be able to smile at a customer. The food was okay but definitely over priced and after our initial treatment we will not be coming back. There are too many restaurant choices in Scottsdale we do not need to pay to be treated rudely."}
{"text":"Still one of my absolute MUSTs when im in LV (and I usually stay at the Cosmo so its nice and easy to get here!).  

Tried a couple of new things this last trip.  The Tater Tot Nachos were amazing!  The Chicken Noodle Soup was fabulous... small pasta pieces, and the chicken wasnt in cubes!  It was chunked like when you do a pulled chicken, and fresh.  So yum!  I also ordered the Italian Meatballs as an app, but it could have been a whole meal... great flavor and the sauce was not runny at all.  meatloaf was also extremely well prepared, and the potatoes were light and fluffy.  A friend had the Fish and Chips, loved it, too!

I think the first time I have ever not wanted to rave about something was this trip, however.  The Chicken Parm Sand wasnt anything real special.  It comes on a sesame seed burger bun, which was odd, and the flavor was a little bland compared to the rest of the menu that we have sampled and loved.  It wasnt bad, by any means... but it wasnt astonishingly great, either."}
{"text":"For the price i paid for a salmon eggs benedict, I got a decent benedict. It was boring and very simple. My expectations were not met."}
{"text":"Simple Diner food w a dash of salt and sugar in a casino environment! Great waiter service for the nasty hangover you may carry from the poker tables to sugar table. Awesome for a loud big obnoxious Group or Millennials losing at the first craps table....vocal fry of \"OMG\".  
FOOD  is HUGE plenty size to feed a family of 4 with just one dish! So much hype to make a  so dry from first taste. Pass on the overpriced Hyped donuts of dryness like a old lady at a retirement apartment. The food is so commercial and to fill you up just like those HUGE portion's @#CheesecakeFactory! Awesome service to make you chill like a big Fat Cat or SugarDaddy spinning that toothpick like a whip on the SugarBaby Ho in sinful paradise. Decent over all diner in a hotel filled w second hand smoke and losers all around! Cheers !!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here three or four times and for one reason or another it always disappoint. I do believe it's overpriced and not the best in the Fox family chain"}
{"text":"I will start by saying that the food was good, very typical Fox dinning. The drinks are creative and I enjoyed the selection of whiskey/bourbon...However, all this was overshadowed by the horrible costumer service. I have never been treated so poorly. We were there with a large party and nothing was done correctly,  drinks were wrong, food was incorrect and the staff seemed annoyed at us for their errors. Quite shocking and I will never return."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of the Henry after having their breakfast burrito and flat white! Best breakfast I have had in a while. The coffee favor was also great. The decor is unique and modern. Overall clean and nice service! Definitely will be back regularly."}
{"text":"This is my go to breakfast spot when I stay at the Cosmo. I haven't had dinner here but breakfast and lunch is yummy. The eggs Benedict is awesome, their avocado toast with salmon is excellent. It's a must try.  There is usually a wait so either make reservations or expect a 20-40 mins wait. Totally worth it though. I will defiantly keep going here."}
{"text":"This is a little hidden gem that's not so hidden. We came here for breakfast and we were surprised to see it so busy.  Had the Flower Child scramble- eggs, Brussels sprouts, kale, roasted mushrooms and Parmesan cheese- delicious and light.  And the Huevos Rancheros- eggs, black beans, queso on corn tortilla- an explosion of flavor.  

Great decor, food comes out quickly and staff is attentive.  Come to this place for a special treat!"}
{"text":"Friend and I went to The Henry for our first time for happy hour. Inside was beautiful and had really cool decor. The bartender was extremely nice and the drinks were amazing!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came here for lunch. The ambiance and crowd is the best part, as the food was solid but not spectacular. The much hyped popovers came out room temperature and the butters that accompany it were not that good."}
{"text":"Good breakfast, mediocre coffee. We ordered the cinnamon roll French toast and the breakfast burrito. The burrito was great(it has tater tots inside!!! How can that be bad?), and the French toast was good. We ordered plain coffee and a vanilla latte and they were both the same price. What? Neither was worth it. My tip--go get a Starbucks while you're waiting for your table."}
{"text":"It was our first time at The Henry and it was a bit confusing so we looked for seats at the bar. Nothing was open because kids were sitting at the bar, which we didn't think it was age appropriate. The hostess approached us and told us we can sit at the table near the cafe. After 10 minutes of waiting, I approached the hostess for menus and service. There wasn't anything that stood out on the menu so we only stay for drinks. The couple who sat next to us also experienced the same confussion."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to come here for the six months and I finally made it! I came here with some colleagues from work and was incredibly pleased. We started off with a few appetizers and drinks; the popovers & kale garlic dip with the fig and ginger mule. I couldn't have asked for a better start to the evening. I ended up choosing the Thai peanut black cod, which ultimately was a great choice. All of the flavors infused in this dish really came together and did not disappoint!

Overall, the staff, service and ambience of the place was remarkable and I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Meal, service, everything is delicious, however they do not have a gluten free menu. Going with a group and thinking that because it was a fox restaurant they would for sure have at least a few GF items, left a few people unable to eat anything."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever . Promised for half hr wait but they prolonged it for about an hr after constant enquiring . And the order took for ever to be served at the table . So just to get into the restaurant and get the food on table took almost 2hr which was horrible for such a reputed restaurant on a weekend(where they r supposed to b doubled prepped )  , moreover I didn't order any fancy just a pancake and bowl of salad . They have good amount of staffing but with poor quality of service . They have no idea what's going on or slip out the situation and keep u waiting . Worst of all was on providing the feedback to staff they don't seem to give a damn neither acknowledge . Apology was far far away to think of .NEVER AGAIN TO THIS RESTAURANT. POOR MANAGEMENT for such a reputed restaurant ."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here after the pool.  We were so happy there wasn't really a line; we had to wait a little though.

What we ordered:
Tater tot nachos - This was good!
Cali Club Omelet - This was okay...
French Toast - would not order this again.  It was whatevers.
Club Sandwich - This was okay

Cost of each dish ranged from $15 to $19. 

Our server was great.  She did everything as expected.  There was one time where my friend ordered a drink but said she didn't like it so the server took it back.  My friend was happy lol"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places in Vegas!

+Low key atmosphere
+Comfy bar chairs
+Amazing selection of bloody marys (Hello garlic vodka!)
+TVs with sports (if that's your thing)
**The french toast looked delicious but I did not try**
+Unique cocktails.

Check it out!!"}
{"text":"The Henry was not a let down by any means.  The atmosphere is trendy yet with a library/study feel to it and the food does not fall short.  The food did come out a little later than expected, but my girlfriend and I did not notice because we were enjoying each other's company.   The staff more than made up for it and were very apologetic about the late delivery of the food.  Again, the service was exceptional.  The only thing I would need to point out is that we never did get our boxed food that was left over from the meal.  It's not a big deal, but noticeable.  

The food was very good.  I got the roasted chicken which was just up my alley considering I have the blandest palate.  My girlfriend got the pork and she really enjoyed it.  Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our experience and will be checking off another restaurant of Fox Concepts that we have visited."}
{"text":"My friend Lauren works for this company and has been talking non stop about this place....  Finally decided to give it a go and was blown away!  

Love the layout of the restaurant, the people were amazing when we came in, and I had this smoothie that blew my mind.

Get the \"Little super Green\" smoothie.  No need to thank me!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy here just good service and great 24-hour food (although he menu is a bit limited). I do love that they service breakfast food 24/7 and they have the absolute best omelettes on The Strip! It's a 4-star for limited choices and high prices."}
{"text":"I loved The Henry! Perfect place for brunch or late dinner. We stopped by for a late brunch and it did not disappoint. 
We ordered their breakfast burrito and short rib Benedict.
The Benedict was perfection and we loved everything about It. Definitelyyyy order.
Skip the breakfast burrito. I've had much better. Barely any eggs and mainly potatoes. Not the tastiest.
Service was amazing and our server was the sweetest girl ever. 
My soy latte was yummy too.
I'll be back. 100%"}
{"text":"Since I've only been here once, I'm going to go with 4 stars. Hopefully I'll be back in Arizona soon so I can come back to The Henry and bump this review up to 5 stars!

The Henry is a beautiful restaurant that also has a cafe attached. It's definitely what one would call \"hipster\" but with such beautiful decor, how could one not be in love?

My friend and I came here on the weekend, so we had the pleasure of ordering off the brunch menu. We each had a cocktail - I ordered the Apricot Blossom Punch, which I wish I had in my hands right now... It was so delicious and the alcohol taste wasn't overpowering, but it definitely packed a punch (ha ha). My friend had the Cactus Flower Margarita, which was equally as delicious in both of our books!

We started with the Short Rib Potstickers. At first I was a little weary. But their potsticker rendition was absolutely delicious. I could've ordered another plate of it! The short rib was so warm and tender and easy to chew. It practically melted in your mouth. The yuzu ponzu was divine.

I had the Egg White Turkey Omelette - essentially a breakfast staple, so how could you really go wrong with it? The potatoes it came with were also delicious. My friend ordered the Flower Child Scramble which was also wonderful - eggs, brussels sprouts, winter squash (yum),
roasted mushroom, kale, and some parmesan. Extremely healthy, extremely filling, extremely delicious. 

Our waiter was extremely sweet and attentive. He was constantly checking on us without making us feel rushed or bothered. Overall, our time at The Henry was absolutely wonderful and we both can't wait to come back. Her before me, since she lives there. And I do not. So no Henry for me. :("}
{"text":"From the waiter that was so friendly and had honest opinions about what we should order to the incredible soup (had chicken noodle soup) to the awesome blt sandwich (definitely try it, and it's big enough to split !) we were extremely happy.  I would have given it 5 stars, but the staff that was in the front greeting people, weren't really greeting people. I would expect a place like this to have  smiling faces that welcome you and even say a friendly, 'thank you for coming' when leaving, but they were too busy socializing with each other and didn't even notice when we walked by and tried to say by to them."}
{"text":"If you want to be treated worse than a beggar come here and enjoy this overpriced and tasteless food. The hostes is rude and has lack of education but that's secondary."}
{"text":"Best place in town!  Everything on the menu is amazing and tastes great. If you are looking for a great specialty cocktail. The old fashioned is done really well there."}
{"text":"I've not had a steak in six months. With a disappointing meal at the $$$$ French place across the street, I remembered Steak and Eggs at The Henry. 

My 12oz ribeye  was grilled perfectly. I was provided a steak knife, however I could have used my butter knife. Opted for frites rather than fingerlings. Over easy eggs were as good as I could make at home. BTW, it was plated hot, which I appreciated. 

With great service, The Henry continues to be my go-to spot!"}
{"text":"Great service!! Good food!
My main complaint with The Henry is their beignet dish. If you've ever been to NOLA and had the cafe du monde beignets (and you like those), please don't order the beignets here!!! It's sweet but tastes more like a doughnut hole than anything else?? Wish we had ordered the French toast or the banana foster doughnuts for the table to share instead. 
I couldn't decide between the grilled cheese w tomato soup and the short rib Benedict. So my friend and I split the two dishes. They were both really good!! The Benedict isn't your traditional Benedict on a breakfast muffin...it all sits on top of hashed potatoes instead. I prefer the traditional Benedict but their version was still good!! The egg was perfectly poached. The pork was tender. The grilled cheese and tomato soup were perfect for morning comfort food. the dishes were pretty heavy but who doesn't go all out for bunch?"}
{"text":"I haver a peculiar and narrow review, albeit a very positive one. A dear friend of mine was at The Henry with eight guests, on the occasion of her bachelorette party. I called the restaurant with a peculiar request: I wanted to purchase a bottle of champagne for the table as a surprise. The Henry could have not made the process any easier. The manager with whom I spoke was courteous and clear, sending me all the proper documentation via email within ten minutes of our conversation; sending me an unnecessary but appreciated note thanking me for my business and confirming that everything went off without a hitch; and prior to my purchase, letting me know of all the options with my previously stated price range. 

And my understanding is that my friend and her group of diners all had a great meal and a great time, as well."}
{"text":"Food was fast and excellent. I had the prime rib and it was amazing.  Was very reasonably priced and s nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were meeting my friends at Cosmopolitan Hotel and wanted to get breakfast before gambling. We were quoted 15 minutes wait, but they let us in after less than 5 minutes. 

The Henry breakfast ($18.00): choice of bacon, ham, pork or chicken sausage,hash brown, toast and 3 eggs any style. I was disappointed with my breakfast. My chicken sausage was meh, the hash brown was not crispy and the eggs were average. 
California Club omelette ($18.00): Warren was disappointed with his omelette. 
Coffee ($5.00): It was just an average cup of coffee. Is this really illy coffee?

2 stars!! I was expecting a better tasting food for the price. Did I order the wrong food?

The Henry is not yummylicious!!"}
{"text":"I've come to The Henry many times before with my family and we love the food here and almost all of Fox Concept restaurant. My only gripe with this restaurant is the distrust we now have with their management/staff. With my last visit, my husband made a reservation for a surprise gIrl's night out for me for my 30th, so he had this planned a week prior, this included giving them a credit card number over the phone, so I wouldn't have to worry about it and enjoy my night. Upon checking our credit card statement, they charged our card 2 days before I was there with $500 amount! It seems The Henry is starting falling short on integrity and customer service. While I haven't been disappointed with the food yet, it's the front of the house that leaves the first and lasting impression."}
{"text":"Great environment and service. If anything was wrong with our plate (ex. Undercooked steak) it was quickly replaced and re plated as if we had gotten a whole new plate. The waiters couldn't have been nicer."}
{"text":"Every hotel has a casual cafe/resto where you can roll in for breakfast or grab a sandwich all day long. The Henry is not 5 star fine-dining, but it is good, and a notch above most casual hotel cafes along the Strip. 

I quite enjoy that the breakfast menu has everything from berry smoothie to steel cut Irish oats, to organic yogurt parfaits. As well as indulgent benedicts and omelets  - Croque-Monsieur Omelet? Hello!! Side note: the breakfast burrito, which is available all day, is ridiculously huge. I probably could have 3 meals out of it. They also have really well-crafted breakfast cocktails like the The Mary Pickford bloody Mary with sriracha vodka, muddled cucumber and dill.

I will say, I have had really great service sitting up at the wood, above and beyond service. Not as great service sitting in a booth. But that tends to happen in a lot of places."}
{"text":"This place was awesome. 

Atmosphere - 
A great brunch atmosphere with beautiful decor. There is a cute café attached to it and I just wanted to hang out there all day! 

Service - 
We made reservations through the Yelp app the morning before arriving at 1230 and let me tell you.. it was the best plan ever. They were busy on that Saturday of course and people were being quoted an hour to an hour and a half wait!! The waitress was attentive and even clarified things (like if I eat eggs) when I notified her I was vegetarian. 

Food - 
I got the huevos rancheros and yum yum yum! I asked for cholula just in case it wasn't spicy enough for my liking; however, the roasted red salsa had just enough of a kick to it. It comes with a side of potatoes. 

We also got the truffle fries. They were good but the truffle dipping sauce was uh-maze-ing I couldn't stop eating the fries solely because of it! 

My boyfriend got the chicken fried chicken and said it was a typical dish. Didn't really stand out and probably wouldn't order it again. 

They have a Bloody Mary table side cart which was really cool! My boyfriend had one but I wasn't able to because of the Worcestershire sauce in their house mix but it looked yummie!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for lunch - it was SO good. He got the potato skins for lunch. He said they were elevated potato skins. I had the French Onion soup and it was the most delicious French onion soup I have ever had. The baked cheese on top was to die for. We will definitely visit again when back in Vegas."}
{"text":"I recently had the good pleasure of visiting The Henry with a good friend for the first time. I had an out of this world everything bagel and an Americano which was among the best I've ever had. The atmosphere, the decor and the friendly service was superb. I highly recommend visiting The Henry."}
{"text":"First off the building is absolutely gorgeous. Unfortunately I had a bad experience on my first time here where the hostess forgot we were standing there waiting for a table. 20 minutes pass and they no longer offered the lunch menu. They were nice enough to let us order off of it when we decided to leave but ended up staying to give it a shot. Pretty disappointed with their guacamole as it was somewhat plain tasting and not worth the price. The chicken sandwich was pretty bland and not really special.  French dip sandwich was pretty good though. I probably would not return due to the price and the bad experience. There are plenty of other restaurants in the area that have more flavorful dishes."}
{"text":"Awesome spot. Restaurant is huge and has a bar, juice bar and tons of seating inside and out. Wife loved her smoked salmon bagel sandwich and I enjoyed my Beverly Hills club. French fries were very good. Staff is very friendly, efficient and accommodating."}
{"text":"What a great restaurant in the heart of Arcadia. 
My favorites are the hamburger, breakfast burrito and the short ribs. 
Another stellar Sam Fox restaurant. Fresh yummy food!!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my guy came here to try out the 2 for $40 menu at The Henry on a Monday night. The Henry is a 24/7 diner at the Cosmopolitan casino with food comparable to the quality at Denny's but priced exceptionally higher. I had a reservation through OpenTable, but the restaurant was practically empty when we arrived. The hostess, interestingly enough, tried to seat us directly next to another table in a cramped booth. At least seat me one table down woman! This ain't Europe and the place is a ghost town. Upon request, she moved us one table over without saying a word. Yeah, she wasn't very friendly.

The server shows up and I ask about the 2 for $40 menu since they didn't give us that menu when seated. He says we need a coupon. Um, no we don't. He says \"Let me check\". The hostess silently comes by and unceremoniously drops off the special menus. I knew beforehand that no vegetarian options were offered as entrees, but I called ahead and asked if they would accommodate me and they said they could. On the phone, I was given the choice of a salad or wrap. In person, the waiter said the chef could make me a veggie burger. I'd rather have a burger anyways! Up until this point the service sucked. Something changed along the way and our server did a 180. He started checking on us more frequently and made sure to bring out one dish after the other, but only when we were finished and ready. What could easily have been a 2 star review turned into a 3 star review thanks to him. 

STARTER - CAESAR SALAD: Wasn't a fan of the dressing, it could've used more of a kick. The lettuce looked kind of sad. 2/5

MAIN ENTREE - VEGGIE BURGER: My burger came with a side of fries. It was huge! The burger came with mushrooms and cheddar cheese. Odd combo. Grilled mushrooms usually come with Swiss cheese. Just saying. 3/5
MEATLOAF - Served with mashed potatoes with gravy and peas. It looked like a brown SpongeBob. My husband didn't say much about his entree. I'll interpret his silence as a 3/5. 

DESSERT - CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM: The server said the ice cream was house made. The ice cream was super chocolatey and satisfied my sweet tooth. 3.5/5
VANILLA ICE CREAM - chocolate ice cream is better! I thought it lacked flavor and just tasted like ice to me. 2/5

Worth a Return Visit? 
The water tastes like crap and leaves a slimy taste in your mouth, forcing you to order a fountain drink. Guess how much those are? $5! Are you friggin kidding me?? Honestly, I would've preferred Denny's. Sure Henry's is nicer, but why would you shell out $50+ for 2 star food?

{"text":"Dined here twice during my debaucherous stay at the Cosmopolitan since it was easily accessible and it didn't require having to step outside the grounds.

On my first visit, I had the French Onion soup and beef dip with truffle tator tots. The French Onion soup wasn't the best I ever had, but it was decent enough to make any fan of the soup happy. The beef dip was nothing to write home about either, but it was passable. The truffle tator tots on the other hand... now THOSE were the cat's meow!! May be too salty for some, but I love anything with truffle salt.

During my second visit, I was a little more bright eyed and devoured a plate of the wedge salad, an order of their buffalo wings and a bloody Mary to wash it all down with. 

The Henry doesn't offer mind-blowing food, but just a few basic comfort foods to ail one's hangover and for that, it does the job just right. Just be sure not to come here broke cuz the food ain't cheap!"}
{"text":"I don't know if I had the equivalent of beer goggles for my tastebuds, but the Henry Burger was SOOOOOO good. I got it medium rare and it was so perfect. I kind of felt like I was in a less sexy version of a Carl's Jr. commercial while eating it. I don't know how often I'd pay $22 for a burger but I had no regrets after this one. To top it all off, I got the truffle oil tater tots which were a total game changer. I don't think I can go back to regular tots that aren't cooked in truffle oil!"}
{"text":"Bring your patience, your humor, and your ear plugs. Table for four centrally located. Wait staff barely came by. Dinner order included chicken tortilla soup as an entree. All meals brought at the same time but no spoon for the soup. One of my dining companions had to literally stand up and wave to get wait staff attention. His steak was served without steak knife. Again, same problem. Blueberry dessert brought to the table without utensils. Again persistent efforts and attempting to get wait staff attention. Paying the bill took over 20 minutes because wait staff said he would come back but did not. Two hour dinner. Noise was so loud that one could only hear the person directly in front of them and not the others at the table. Smell from burning charcoal or oven filled our area of the dining room. Could have been Pleasant if not overwhelming."}
{"text":"Today was my first time trying The Henry for brunch. I've been here a few times for their delicious food and coffee and I always receive great service. One time I was here and the food was taking a bit longer than usual. Without having to ask, my server got me a free appetizer to snack on. 
Today's service was just as great. I tried their Bloody Mary cart and I was very impressed. Of the six different house infused vodkas I went for the red pepper and olive. I have to say it was the best Bloody Mary I've ever had!
Also, I have yet to find a better coffee shop than XV. I love their Wildflower latte. 
Very well earned 5 stars."}
{"text":"First visit last night....awesome experience.  Service was great, a bit late seating us for our reservation, but no problem, they brought us a complimentary appetizer as we waited at the bar! Mule and Vodka with pulp were excellent. Popovers were a big hit - get them!  Norwegian salmon appetizer was really delicious.  Rotisserie chicken and the Mediterranean Branzino were great!  Topped it off with shared croissant bread pudding - WOW!  Great atmosphere, great service and great food - we'll be back!"}
{"text":"First visit and on a holiday, too. Lunchtime. 3 people. The atmosphere is fantastic, but the food, as it is with all Fox restaurants (imo), just okay. Our lunch time meal of truffle fries, turkey French dip, kale salmon salad, and poached eggs with asparagus had been sitting quite a while before it was delivered to the table. Delivery time was about 50 minutes after ordering. So while it was flavorful, it was lower than room temp. We had hopes for finding a new place to add to our regular hangouts, Henry's likely will not make the list. It might be a good hangout for coffee during the day; that's for a future visit."}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriends for a late breakfast after a night of partying.
The french dip with truffle tator tots hit the spot and helped cure my semi-hangover.
Service was good and my coffee cup was constantly refilled!"}
{"text":"Friends and I came here after being at the tables and this is one of the best burgers I have tasted. Food was amazing came out within a timely manor and service from the servers is excellent. Definitely a spot to come visit again next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Went at around 1pm on a Sunday for brunch. Parking was not hard to find at all, which is always a plus. 

Went inside, the hostess was in a odd spot to the left. We got checked in & were told the wait would be about 45 minutes to an hour, but in actuality waited about 15-20mins. 

Once we we seated our two servers were extremely friendly & helpful-- one girls name was Andy I think, I can't remember the other girls name, but she was a short blonde. Both were familiar with the menu & gave house/personal recommendations.

I ordered the Chicken Fried Chicken with breakfast potatoes & a mimosa. I also had some of my friends Smoked Salmon app-- which was really delicious, but a little over salted.

My entree was pretty good, sunny side eggs were cooked just how I like them & the chicken & biscuit were also enjoyable.

Overall I am giving 4/5 stars, everything was great except for the disorganized feeling at the front. Next time I'll just make reservations!"}
{"text":"Best hotel coffee shop i have been to in Vegas. Bar none the truffle oil tater totts rock !"}
{"text":"I meant to write this a few days ago but such as life during this time of year the days get past me. 

 I had just got off a flight that had been delayed from the craziness from Atlanta's hub which had me stuck for 8 hours (which in itself is ridiculous) so needless to say when I finally landed back in Phoenix I was exhausted and just wanted to eat and go home. 

 The Henry is directly down the street from home and always a great \"go to\" for consistency in every regard. I haven't been here in a bit but when I do I try and ask for Estefy (do so if you have a chance) not only does she recite the menu beautifully she genuinely cares about the individual she serves, without being \"fake\" or \"forceful\" on what would seem to be an upsell to most people. 

 Again, I was tired but when we began with the short rib potstickers with yuzu ponzu the rest was down hill. My guest and I then split the gem brussel sprout Caesar salad followed by the salmon and pork loin. Both the lemon beet glaze and sage stuffing accompanying these dishes were everything Estefy said they would be. 

 We couldn't do dessert but felt we already demolished them after she described the Pear Cake with the honey crema and pear sorbet ?? Mind blown....without the calories :)

 Thank you again FRC for your attention to detail with ambiance and food quality. And thank you Estefy for the recommendation on what I just described and directing me to the 'Wake of Angels'.

 Hendricks is my weakness when I've had a real shit day and although nothing could have made that particular day go ANYMORE wrong. It all was forgotten over the evening. 

See you guys soon."}
{"text":"Without a reservation I was seated very fast. Waiter was amazing his attitude and character was so uplifting that you could not help but smile and the FOOD WOWWWWW one of the best breakfast I've had in Vegas short rib Benedict and the Henry breakfast"}
{"text":"The Henry is excellent. Fox Restaurant Concepts does everything right.
Food is amazing, service is excellent.
Jacob was our server, outstanding job.
He asked me if I wanted a to go cup for my coffee, Wow!
Have been coming for awhile,and will be back again and again!"}
{"text":"Service amazing, food even better. My son had the hamburger and fries off the kids meal it was the size of an adult meal and delicious. I had the shrimp cocktail appetizer, one of the best I've ever had in my life. I had the quinoa tacos which were different and very good. The kale slaw was out of this world. And the drinks forget it. I'd give this place 10 stars. Ambience is also gorgeous and very inviting. Did I mention they have a coffee bar inside the restaurant? Which is so amazing as well. Blown away! We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This review is primarily for one dish: the Eggs Benedict Florentine, which according to the menu entails: sautéed spinach, soft poached eggs, toasted english muffin and sauce choron. I was not familiar with this french sauce, and took the chance that the carefully selected menu would not disappoint upon this inclusion. I also ordered the chicken apple sausage as a benedict in my world is not complete without an accompanying meat or fish. 

I highly recommend both; the muffin stayed crisp through the sauce, and the 'lightly poached' description on the egg was accurate - it was a beautiful sphere that was balanced on the spinach on each muffin half, cloaked in a coral glaze. The composition was spectacular, and the weighty flatware made the physical act of cutting bites its own bounty of pleasure. With a crisp, firm, moist sausage to absorb the perfectly runny yolk and more of this intriguing sauce, the dish blew my mind. 

In the new era of quality - even on the casino floor - I wasn't surprised the dish was good, but I didn't expect it to be excellent and memorable. One of the best breakfasts I've had in quite a while."}
{"text":"enjoyable food. good atmosphere. a little slow on the staff."}
{"text":"Very lame service; food barely palatable. Only decent dish among 5 different orders was the short rib eggs benedict. Service was the very worst we encountered during our 4 days in Vegas. Gruff busboys and clueless servers. Kitchen got 2 orders wrong. Restaurant only three months old. Stay away for at least the next year."}
{"text":"We loved our entire experience here. Our server Katy was awesome. The food was perfect. And the ambience was charming yet modern and unique. This is a must see!"}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with my girlfriends today. The Henry is huge, there's plenty of parking and places and its a beautiful space. The menu looked great, but our service was awful. My friend had to ask 3 times to get a glass of water and I never got the pastry o ordered. It took a long time to get our order in, food, refills, etc. Food was good, but popovers came out cold as well as my friends entree."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic but service is so slow despite having a reservation. We ordered quickly but main entree didn't arrive until 45 minutes later. Food is worth the wait but time is not always a luxury for a busy business traveler like myself."}
{"text":"Love the decor and vibe of this place. Coffee shop, breakfast, meetings - so much going on. I was there for a seminar - what a great room for small groups. The food was great - garlic fries, yum!

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The food is outstanding. We tried three appetizers and two entrees and everything was delicious. Portions are perfect. Service and ambiance great. They have a coffee shop inside as well, will be back for some lattes and baked treats!"}
{"text":"The Henry is a great quick place to grab breakfast after a late night of partying when you really need a hearty breakfast and coffee to begin the road to recovery. 
I had the short rib eggs benedict and it hit the spot, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore the coffee shop portion of the Henry, but this review is for their brunch. We came as a large party of 9, and were seated along one of the long, green benches in the restaurant. Everyone I was with, was impressed by the whimsical decor and the delicious looking menu.
We ordered spiked lattes (upon request, and easily accommodated) but looked in envy at the awesome Bloody Mary carts that were around the restaurant. The carts looked adorable - glass carts with all types of Bloody Mary ingredients, and they get to make your drinks, customized right there and then for you.
I digress in envy. The spiked lattes were strong and delicious, and hit the spot after a long sleepy morning. We ordered cheesy popovers for the table to start. The popovers come in three in a batch as well as with bacon butter. Yes, these things are delicious, addictive, and gone before you know it!
I ended up ordering the Chicken Fried Chicken as an entree. The Chicken was cooked in buttermilk, too, the same seasoning as the biscuits, and it absolutely tasted like home cooking in my mouth.  
Overall, it was an awesome dining experience, though I will make sure to dress up a little more formally next time. I need to go back for the Bloody Mary carts!"}
{"text":"Stopped here recently for brunch and it was good. I had the cinnamon French toast with a side of bacon. 

The French toast was not described well on the menu. It turned out to be like a croissant type bread with very little cinnamon flavor and not very sweet. The description said it was dipped in custard but it was dry and didn't have too much flavor. The best part of my meal was the slab bacon. I got four slices that were cooked to perfection and super thick. Everyone in my party seemed to enjoy their meals. 

The service was very rude about my well-behaved kids being there. I would go back but try something else."}
{"text":"We had a large party sitting outside - maybe that was the issue. But the fish was cold, the salad was warm, the minestrone soup was not only cold but mushy and burnt (like it gets when you scrape it up from the bottom of the pot after it's been sitting too long). Three of our party didn't get their food until everyone else was not only completely finished not only with their entrees but also their 2nd cocktails or coffees. Some things were comped but overall mediocre, overpriced (salmon salad, soup and 3 glasses of wine were almost $70 before tip). The wine was passable but nothing special. Nice ambiance but disappointing. Skip it or maybe try it for lunch when they are not busy. And give yourself plenty of time to find a place to park. The place was - unaccountably, based on our experience - busy. Just another trendy Scottsdale watering hole."}
{"text":"Everyone talks about the truffle tater tots and for good reason. It was the best part (even though it was a side) on the menu. I ordered a reuben sandwich and man was that not worth $20. Prices are expensive, but then again you are in Vegas. Just don't expect too much."}
{"text":"We love this restaurant. Actually we are fans of all the Fox restaurants. They truly know customer service! The food is high quality, the service is good and we love sitting outside when we are here. We had to post a review because of their latest display of fantastic service. We ordered dinner the other night and my husband picked it up. We got home and realized they left out a main dish which meant someone wasn't getting their meal.  I called and spoke with the manager. Not only did he make us a new one, he offered to have another manager deliver it to our home since we live close by. They also included a dessert for \"our trouble.\" That is amazing service! Thank you Fox!"}
{"text":"The Cosmo's saving grace is it's restaurants and bars. The casino cannot be making that much money and the fact that their restaurants are all leased out doesn't help their case. Luckily for us there are so many options. The Henry comes off as their upscale cafe option. The price for food is reasonable, they are open late, and have a good selection of drunk food.

Wanting to eat at a place that was more relaxed after the Warhol exhibit, we walked over to the Cosmo. I got the baby beet salad and my date got the burger. Like I said, everything was reasonable for location. The food was good, but not exactly wow worthy. Is it a slam against the restaurant? No, I would definitely come back and get something more substantial next time. 

The atmosphere is dark and quiet. I am not the biggest fan of sitting so close to other tables and was worried about that when we first sat down. As we were dining, more people were filling in, and it was not as bad as I was imagining. 

The staff were friendly and we felt attended to. The nice thing is that I got to know my date more yet we never needed to ask for anything. That is good service."}
{"text":"Look up \"bourgeoisie\" in the dictionary. You won't see \"The Henry\" but it'll describe the Henry to a T. 

\"A sociologically defined class, especially in contemporary times, referring to people with a certain cultural and financial capital belonging to the middle or upper stratum of the middle class: the upper (haute), middle (moyenne), and petty (petite) bourgeoisie (which are collectively designated \"the Bourgeoisie\"); an affluent and often opulent stratum of the middle class (capitalist class) who stand opposite the proletariat class.\"

This is a restaurant and coffee shop, but it is without a doubt the bougiest coffee shop in greater Phoenix. Part of this might be a function of the location. Smack in the middle of Arcadia, just south of Paradise Valley, across from A.J's Fine Foods and the Village, short of Thompson Peak, this is as bougie as Phoenix gets.

The architecture and decor piles it on. The Henry was built to give that country club feel, and it succeeded. The thick, white colonial style moulding. The arborvitae out front forming perfect hedges. The wrought iron. Everything screams \"Hamptons,\" including the people.

The people at the Henry are uniformly bourgeoisie or aspiring bourgeoisie, and the Henry is aware of this and price their coffee accordingly. The demographics are both a function of the Henry's location in Arcadia, and it's placement just enough off the beaten path that it takes real intention to come here. It's not a coffee shop a pleb will stumble upon when doing errands or coming home from work. It's neither a quirky indie corner shop nor a convenient daily quick fix. There's no drive-through, no convenient parking (without a great deal of luck), no glaring sign saying \"get your coffee fix here.\" No one driving is likely to make a spontaneous decision to swing through. It's not so much a coffee shop than an establishment. Well-heeled Phoenicians - lawyers, architects, realtors and developers, and let's not forget the profitable housewife demographic - seem to make the Henry a destination.

This makes people watching at the Henry unique. It's the type of place where you see people of a certain class bump into an acquaintance or two. Steve, with the cashmere sweater draped around his shoulders wasn't expecting to see Roy in the polo and boat shoes, but when he does he'll give his shoulder a squeeze and say \"ROY, good to see you buddy, how's the market\" or something. And seeing Roy will give Carol, Susan and Vicky at the high top with the wine a five minute diversion to delve into Roy's affair, or his divorce, or the Tesla he lost in the divorce. Occasionally you'll see a grad student or two studying here, but it isn't frequent. The Henry is more sip and gab than pound and grind.

Fox found a niche in the market and have exploited it with gusto. In greater Phoenix, I'm not aware of any other place that screams country-club-casual coffee without requiring a membership. No half-measures here - the Henry caters to the second-home-in-Flagstaff crowd with no apologies. It may not be everyone's scene, but after all, that's the point.

As for me, I'm not sure I quite make the cut yet. Maybe someday. First I'll need to own a cabin in Prescott. Then, with my firm turning a nice quarterly profit, perhaps I'll schedule a lunch meeting at the Henry with a prospective client or two. When I'm waiting in line, I'll glance across the room and see Danny, who'll come over and squeeze my shoulder and say \"MARK, taking the boat out this weekend?\" And I'll say \"DANNY, good to see you buddy ol' pal, I'm off to Napa until Tuesday. The boat will have to wait.\" And then we can briefly talk about the market before exchanging guffaws and goodbyes.

Until then, I'll have to cool my heels somewhere where the ceilings are a little lower, the moulding a little thinner, and the coffee a little cheaper."}
{"text":"5 stars for atmosphere 2 for breakfast food so it averages out to a 3.


I absolutely love the vibe and style of this place. Will definitely come back and try the happy hour/dinner and see if their non breakfast foods are better.

Breakfast left us a bit flat."}
{"text":"Ohhhh The Henry... boy do I love visiting them for dinner every chance I get. They have some great dishes that just melt my heart and make my knees buckle. 

I really love the ambience of this restaurant, it has an upbeat vibe and is full positive energy. It does get a little loud, so don't expect an intimate setting.

I love, love, love the Short Rib Potstickers and Korean Style Skirt Steak. If they ever remove either one from their menu, they must provide me the recipe! The potstickers have an amazing sauce that is just out of this world, but is so simple at the same time. I'm not a big beef eater, but I always make the exception for the Korean Style Skirt Steak. They serve it with a very flavorful rice that I can never get enough of. 

I've tried many other great things on the dinner menu and I never left unsatisfied. This is surely one of my favorites in the Arcadia area."}
{"text":"Second time at this restaurant,  arrived at 4:00 Sunday 11.26.  service really awful, if you can't take care of customers during your menu change, then don't offer food.  Our waiter was slow, inattentive and not well informed. Pasta Bolognese, outstanding as was the Burger, cold chilled shrimp, bland."}
{"text":"Nothing special here.  Had brunch, Huevos Ranchero was good.  My fiance had a waffle; I don't think you can screw that up.  What they did screw up was the price.  $14 for the same waffle you get at the Hampton Inn for free, okay fine.  But $8 for two scrambled eggs?  Coffee is Illy, but they burn it, and $5.  $70 for a breakfast - I'll never be back.  Oh, and the skanky Jersey Shore couple making out at the front... Awesome!  At least the service was good..."}
{"text":"Great craft cocktails was so yummy I came here twice!  Had the tatertot nachos with braised short ribs, they were definetly good for bar food but wasn't sold completely on the short ribs.  The next morning I had the breakfast burrito!  The burrito was amazing as is!  A definite must try!  Also both bartenders provided great recommendations for food and drinks."}
{"text":"Can only comment on the breakfast...which was very very good. The henry is Cosmo's 24 hour a day go-to spot...much much more than what you might perceive a 24 hr. \"coffee shop\" to be. after all..its the Cosmopolitan!. Its pricey and elegant yet we felt very comfortable. our waiter was always available..filled the waters and coffee's up after seemingly each sip. Wife had the waffle with strawberries and cream and loved it. I had the henry breakfast with three delicious over easy eggs and tasty pork sausage. orange juice was very good and we were offered refills. a breakfast here will easily get you through until dinner time."}
{"text":"Great food and great service. You will not be disappointed with the breakfast here. Large portions, high quality product, impeccable service."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of this restaurant. Super spacious inside, and it has the cutest coffee bar. Service was excellent, our waitress was very pleasant and handled our large table well. I ordered the spring harvest bowl with chicken, aka my go to dinner at home! All the roasted veggies, quinoa, sweet potato & pesto it was SO GOOD. I can't wait to go back! After dinner we all tried one of their coffee drinks, I ordered the Cleo and my husband ordered the Wildflower.. I ended up drinking both because they were delicious!"}
{"text":"The Henry is about as good of an atmosphere as you can get. It makes you feel like you've stepped into another world!!  The coffee bar is amazing. I highly recommend the \"Cleo\" coffee. We waited about 45 minutes for a table on a Sunday around 11:30 so clearly it's already a popular spot. Food came out very slow! Luckily we has a Bloody Mary to start. They came by with a Bloody Mary cart and it was amazing! Try the horseradish vodka in your bloody. To die for! We started with the matzah ball soup which was really flavorful and traditional. Then I had the chopped salad which was horrible.. The bacon was covered In sugar and overwhelmed the entire salad. It was not good. My sister had the smoked salmon appetizer on top of potato Latkes and that was delicious! Other people with us ordered breakfast and loved their food. Since it just opened I'm going to go back and try more things. The place is cute enough that it doesn't matter how great the food is because you want to go back for more!"}
{"text":"Mmm. The iced coffee is so good.  It will wake you up for sure!  I love love love the decor. Fox definitely has a knack for this.  It is a feast for your eyes. Everywhere you look there is something fun to look at.  The food that we had was decent. A bunch of appetizers and we split up a few entrees for lunch.  Nothing knock your socks off, but good! Great place for lunch or happy hour snacks and cocktails with the girls or boys!"}
{"text":"The henry burger used to be amaaaazing....key word ... USED to be. I don't know what was wrong with it the last time I had it, but it was definitely off par."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to try The Henry out for dinner last night. We love the Fox Concepts and The Henry was the last one we haven't tried yet. The restaurant is in a good location, right off Camelback, with a gorgeous patio set and beautiful views of the comeback mountains. The service and the drinks were excellent. We started with the chilled shrimp as an appetizer. They were well seasoned just wish there were more. I think you only get 4 big shrimp for $16. For entree my husband had the braised short rip dish. It was delicious. I had their branzino. Not the best choice for me. Even though the fish tasted good, it was cooked well and seasoned well the side dishes didn't complement it well and that kind of ruined the dish for me. It came with some oats that tasted like plain oatmeal for me and 3 little pieces of cauliflower. Just not a good enough side dish for the delicious fish. For dessert we had their Panna Cotta and Cleo Espresso . The panna cotta came with grapefruit ice cream and cashews. It didn't really impress us and didn't think that the sorbet was the best complement for the panna cotta. Wish it had more fresh fruit and maybe a raspberry or blackberry jam. The espresso was really really good. We will definitely visit The Henry again"}
{"text":"Our server was both friendly and knowledgeable about gluten free options on the menu! We went for breakfast, and I was pleasantly surprised when I was told that almost every item could be modified to be gluten free - instead of having to pick from a few sparse items. 

I had the eggs Benedict on gluten free toast with a refreshing glass of orange juice! My gluten eating family raved about the cheesy breakfast potato cake as well!

I would definitely recommend this spot and come back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The chicken flavor in the chicken noodle soup was very overpowering, it did not taste good. The chicken pieces were very big and chewy. The soup was very flavorless, I had to spend about 10 minutes adding salt and pepper to give it some flavor and it still didn't have any flavor. I do not recommend anyone getting it.

Chicken tenders and Caesar salad were okay."}
{"text":"Very greasy food. Yummy for post hangover I suppose. $5 for a basic illy coffee. Breakfast burrito was delicious but again, greasy as hell. Very convenient for those staying in the hotel and considering it's at the cosmopolitan, not an altogether horrible deal. Spent a similar amount as if we had gone to eggslut or a take-out type place, and at least we got to sit down.

Service was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Its concept is \"the greatest neighborhood restaurant\", and I loved it!  They are open all day, with a coffee shop inside, but they dress up nicely for supper.  The decor was on trend with its combo of old and modern fixtures and furniture.

I kicked off with a Pineapple Pisco Sour, and was super impressed at the restaurant emblem in the foam!  It was a delicious version of my favorite drink from our honeymoon in Peru.

I decided to have soup and a starter for my dinner.  The soup that day was a chicken tortilla soup, which had fresh avocado in it.  It was tasty and it the spot, as the evenings in AZ were in the low 40s when I was there in January.

I also had the Short Rib Potstickers, which were excellent.  They tasted fantastic!  I had a bite of AC's Prairie Breeze Cheddar Popovers too, which were super soft on the inside."}
{"text":"Outstanding...Truly hard to fault anything. From the warm welcome to the inviting decor to the fresh and delicious food. Believe it or not, my favorite part of my whole experience at The Henry was the freshly squeezed grapefruit juice...it was to die for...In fact it is the single item that would bring me back here...yet it was that good...Well done!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to the Henry yet, you need to go. 

This is my favorite Sunday brunch spot. They have a great lunch and dinner menu too. 

I typically get lox and bagels or 2 egg breakfast. The Go North is the best coffee drink I've ever had. 

The atmosphere is very comfortable, open and the energy of this place is always buzzing. Usually there is a 20 minute wait without a reservation but they typically have open seating at the bar and couches up front. 

They have a really nice Bloody Mary cart on the weekend too."}
{"text":"I don't care if they ever offer me a voucher to take my friends and family back to this place.. I will never come back.

I am very big on service.. due to my egg allergy. I came here very early in the morning with a group of 7 friends so you can only imagine they only offered the breakfast menu.. which consists of egg infested selections. That's perfectly fine for me, I always manage to order something without eggs or simply ask them to make it without eggs.

I ordered the breakfast burrito and informed our waiter that I have an allergy.. which means that not only can I NOT have eggs, but I cannot eat anything that includes it (such as ranch, mayo, etc) and it cannot be cooked with it as well. The waiter said he'd make sure of it. The food came out promptly. Two bited later, my lips started to itch and swell. Fortunately for me.. my reactions come quickly so I am able to prevent myself from eating more and getting worst reactions. So I simply informed our waiter that I was getting allergies and for him to take the plate away. He asked me if I wanted anything else and I declined. I was not upset, I understand that he did everything that he could within his own power. 

Shortly after, the manager came up to me and asked me about my allergy. Instead of apologizing, he wanted to make it a point that there were no eggs in the burrito. I explained to him that if my food even touches eggs or gets cooked on the same pan, I will get the same reaction and I understand that it's a breakfast menu so there are risks for me eating during breakfast hours. He then asked if I wanted to make a claim, in which I politely declined. He insisted and said that he has to because of policy. Then why even bother asking?? So I told him to do whatever he needs to do.

A few minutes later, two paramedics showed up next to me asking me if I add asked for urgent care. I told them I did not request for it. They asked if I was having allergy reaction and I said I was, but it was light and that it wasn't an emergency. They offered me benedryl but I declined because it has no affect on me. They left to go discuss with the manager, in which at this point.. I was already embarassed by the scene they caused. Everyone was staring at me like I was going to pass out and die. And after all that, they had the nerve to come back and ask me to sign a consent form stating that I had refused their service. That was my last straw. I told them I was signing any paperwork and to just bring us the bill and they still managed to charge our table after the chaos they had just created when I simply told them to take back my plate.

I don't know the manager's name, but this gives Cosmopolitan a really bad name. Learn to understand that CUSTOMERS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT and it's not your job to prove us wrong. I don't care if you disected my burrito to make there was no eggs, I think me having ALLERGIC REACTION is enough to prove the point. Not only did you ruin my meal, you ruined the rest of my day. You bet I am writing to corporate about this and I hope whoever has allergies can understand my pain and not support such poor management."}
{"text":"Alright, so I haven't been to The Henry in ages (life has been a bit too hectic to splurge) but I decided to come in on a whim and goodness I was not disappointed. 

From the moment we were seated, our experience at The Henry was fantastic. Our waiter greeted us and made our experience a pleasure - offering suggestions as to what to drink (hello Cactus Flower Margarita ) and how to make our meals better, topping it off with the most fabulous dessert and lots of laughs along the way.

The food was excellent, but Ruben is what made me a customer who will happily return."}
{"text":"Worst service I've received in years!  Waiter and service was slow and the waiter spilled water on my friend.  After waiting about 30 minutes for our food we decided to ask them to box it up so we could take it to our hotel room.  The waiter leaves us the check and goes to let the cooks know, then comes back and tries to take out money before we even received anything.  We finally get our food in two bags and leave to our room.  When we get back we notice they didn't give us out steak and eggs or our French fries!  So we call them the following morning and explain the situation and they basically dismiss us because we paid in cash and can't show them a customer receipt which wasn't provided.  Avoid this place unless you enjoy slow terrible service."}
{"text":"seriously love this place! great place, decor, and amazing food! honestly no way to disappoint!"}
{"text":"The short rib Benedict was delicious! I'm not a big sauce fan so I asked for them in the side and I would recommend that as the way to go. 

The wait system is a bit shoddy. Took forever to be seated at 11 on a Tuesday. 

My mom enjoyed her omelette. 

Great breakfast stop!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for his bday dinner. Food was delicious, the staff was courteous and they even brought out a dessert with a candle. Thanks for making it a special night! I will definitely revisit."}
{"text":"I recently had dinner at The Henry on Sunday night. I only have wonderful things to say about it. I had a reservation for 6:30PM, at 6:34PM one of the managers came over and apologized and offered us a free cocktail. Around 6:45PM we were sat at our table. 

The food was DELICIOUS (kale and garlic dip, brussel sprout Caesar salad, and Quinoa tacos). The service was great - food came out quick. Our server was personable. I will definitely go back soon. Nice job Sam Fox!"}
{"text":"Yelps 365 Review Challenge - Los Angeles #1 - #365


The Henry is just another one of those 24/7 strip cafés  with an upscale modern feel. 

I was staying at the Cosmopolitan and was craving some a juicy hamburger and thought about , \"The Henry.\" Having a 24/7 café is crucial in your Vegas hotel, if you want to avoid walking outside looking for a Denny's or some other late night diner.  

But anyways, like other reviews has pointed out, this restaurant is always packed and the service was outstanding! 

Items I've ordered here:

+ $19: Signature Short Rib Benedict - braised short ribs, hollandaise, crispy potatoe cakes = Phenomenona!

+ $18: The Henry Breakfast - ham, sunny side eggs, breakfast potato, toast = Delish!
 
They're located right next to the strip across from Bond, Chandelier Bar and just a few steps away from the strip. I'd eat here again if I'm staying in the Cosmopolitan or nearby with a empty stomach. Also, charge it to the room, so you can earn points for your Identity player's card."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Great for brunch/lunch, they have amazing bloody Mary's and great food. Today I had the French toast which was spectacular, but usually I go with my usual which is the turkey French dip....by far one of the best French dips I've had! The food is always consistent and really yummy. In addition, they have great service and great prices. Love the atmosphere and a good place to grab lunch with a friend."}
{"text":"Food was great, nice selection for breakfast.  Get a few things and share them.  Ok Bloody Mary, nothing fancy.  Cinnamon Roll French Toast is where it's at!"}
{"text":"This place was very fun to have dinner.  Uber trendy, great food (I had the chicken, a must have with mac and cheese), has a killer whisky list and an amazing craft drink selection.  You must try both of the mules they offer.  Fun coffee shop on the way out for the ride home too."}
{"text":"Food is good. Just super loud and busy atmosphere. It was really hard to converse with our party. Not sure if it was the booth where we were seated, being in the middle of he dining room, but it definitely made it difficult to hold a conversation."}
{"text":"Currently one of my favorite spots! My food is always amazing and the drinks are great too! I love the decor. My current fav is the Korean style steak. To die for!"}
{"text":"Had brunch with my boyfriend on Sunday, we sat at the bar to avoid the wait. The bartenders were very friendly & helped make suggestions. Thought there would be more brunch options but the food was good!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I have no idea why this rating is so low. We stayed in the Cosmo recently, on a girls trip, and we ate here 2 of the 3 days, the other group of girls ate here 3 of the 3 days for our breakfast meal.

Their Dill/Cucumber smashed Bloody Mary is to die for!!!  Their coffee is divine. The service was great both times AND there was little to no wait times to eat!

The first day 2 girls ordered the Short Rib Benedict- Hot Damn is that good!  It was so good, in fact, they wanted it AGAIN the next day and sure as shit they both ordered it AGAIN!!!!!  

But truly the most AMAZING THING is their Gruyere cheese hashbrown cake of LOVE. I actually thought it was a Risotto cake at first, but BY GOD IS THAT GOOD!  It's hashbrowns, onions, and cheese in a latkes style hashbrown circle of mouth watering, tongue tingling DELECTABLENESS. Need I say more?  Don't even think of not getting this thing. It's so good other people did without fries or tater tots; which by the way, they have as well, to get this as their side item instead. It can't be good for you, but by golly is it good!

I got a burger the 2nd day as it was 11 o'clock on Saturday and they had a brunch menu, it was delicious as well.

I would eat here again and again! I'd be 500 lbs but I would do it!"}
{"text":"The Mac & Cheese fried balls are delicious!!! 

Yes, I was pretty drunk when I had it. But no, this is not a drunk talk. They are truly delish!! 

Yep, didn't remember what else I ordered. So that's all I can offer here."}
{"text":"SOOOOOOOOO good. We were staying at a different hotel but had breakfast here 2 days in a row because it was sooooo good. The first day we sat at the bar and the server was so amazing and soo attentive. He was super entertaining and checked on us frequently. I had the short rib benedict. (im an eggs benedict fanatic its my go to item on every menu) it was a huge portion, super hearty and flavorful. The flavors just mixed so well together, the hollandaise sauce and the sauce from the short rib. I could barely finish all the food on the plate. Also their orange juice is sooooo good, you can taste the freshness 
   On the second day I ordered the all natural omelet with a side of fruit. First of all the side of fruit was the best combination of fruit I've ever ordered at a restaurant. There was star fruit, pomegranate, strawberry,mangos and blueberry. The veggies inside the omelet were cooked perfectly and complimented each other very well. Again the portion was very big and I couldn't finish but that is a good thing. The person i was with got the Belgian waffle both days with fruit and whip cream on top,they love waffles and absolutely loved the waffles at the Henry. Devoured the waffles both days.
     Next time im in vegas I will definitely return for breakfast, the food quality is very good here and im sure anything on the menu is going to be good to eat. The environment was also great. the cosmopolitan hotel itself is beautiful, but the décor inside the henry is very nice and very well thought out. it is a wonderful atmosphere to enjoy a good meal."}
{"text":"Carrot cake pancakes.
That is all.

Those were the most amazing pancakes i have had EVER.

Was visiting from out of town, went here on a Saturday morning, and yes there was a wait at 1pm.  I think we waited almost an hour.

While service isn't the fastest, i didn't mind as I'm from a big city, and we are always on the go.  
The food is OUTSTANDING. The breakfast burrito was also really good, and a healthy option which was nice.
Love their outside deck area"}
{"text":"Charming hip vibe   Excellent service.  We had a reservation for a party of 7 and were seated promptly at a large round table.  Bloody Mary from cart  was good, not fabulous but adequate.  Several ordered the carrot cake pancakes and they were divine!  Not overly sweet.  2 ordered the Pig Sandwich and loved it.  The only meal that was below average was the chicken fried chicken. It came a fair amount after the rest of the dishes. Not sure why the delay.  The server brought out toast and a side of bacon for him \"while he waits\". The dish consisted of 1 biscuit and 2 very small pieces of the chicken and eggs.  The chicken was very rubbery and disappointing."}
{"text":"I love the ambiance, Very nautical feel here. 

Starters ;; Avacado Brushetta was phenomenal. My nephew loved it. White truffle parmesan  fries. Ahhh. Is a musttt. Best truffle fries I had ever had. No joke :)

Gemelli bkack truffle was my entrée,  it was way to salty and way too cheesy. The spinach taste so old :( 
My sister ordered the pork rib. She had barely any meat, all she had was the fat. No meat :( So she ate r he mashed potatoes instead, and her skn mac and cheese.
Honestly,  I would of been fine with my white truffle Parmesan fries as a entrée.

After our brunch, we walkes to get coffee, which was in the same restaurant. It was cute."}
{"text":"Delish but pricey for dinner - but really delish.  Great coffee/breakfast, no pricier than Starbucks and much, much, much better food!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for brunch on a Sunday morning around 11am. It was pretty busy, but we got a seat at the bar quickly. I ordered the pancakes and they were delicious! They tasted homemade, and the portion size was pretty big. My husband had to help me finish them. The service was good, friendly and quick. My husband ordered the short rib eggs Benedict and he enjoyed that as well too. The short rib was prepared perfectly, delicious and tender."}
{"text":"Early morning on the first day in Vegas.  We wander down the strip to the Cosmo to meet some friends.  After checking out the sights and gaming a bit, hunger calls.  It's still morning, and our options are limited.  Hit the buffet or sit down for table service?  We opt for the Henry.

At first glance, the menu says diner.  At second glance, a few things pop off the page.  It still diner-ish, but there are some nice twists.  I really enjoyed, my hash and eggs, and my friends were all very happy with their meals and cocktails.

Old school swank.  New school glitz.  Tasty food."}
{"text":"over priced
okay quality
awful chocolate cake

pretzel sticks okay"}
{"text":"Very good Saturday brunch. Carrot cake pancakes? Yes please...so tasty. Great service...not too long of a wait...interesting stuff to look at and people watch...so don't really notice. Drip coffee is great."}
{"text":"Lunchtime and time to try out The Henry, which my fiancée had heard a lot about. We chose to sit outside in the very summery and cozy garden patio.  It wasn't very busy and we were served promptly.  The service was just decent, for example we had to ask to get our water glasses refilled. I ordered their burger with garlic Parmesan fries and it was very good, however it seems that they could have \"upped\" the presentation with something apart from just the burger and the fries.  My fiancee's pasta dish was delicious but extremely small.  It didn't fill her up at all and if I had ordered it I would have been more than disappointed.  We mentioned this to our server who said that he would inform the chef.  Before we left a female host came up and apologized and offered to comp us dessert or a drink, which we declined.  That was a very classy and highly appreciated gesture."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, beautifully designed, okay food, slow service.  Feels like a lot of \"stepford wives\".   If that is your thing..... this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Considering The Cosmopolitan is the newest resort on the Strip, it's not surprising that nearly every aspect of the hotel is so trendy and nice.  However, it's still pretty surprising that even their 24-hour diner/cafe looks great.  Definitely nicer than some random Denny's or IHOP!

Unlike the vast majority of Cosmo''s restaurants and eateries, The Henry is located on the ground floor (by the entrance closest to the Bellagio) as opposed to the second and third floors.  Despite being so close to the casino though, it's pretty cool how the restaurant isn't at all loud or smokey.  Although there seemed to be a decent sized crowd waiting to be seated, it only took about 10-15 minutes to get a table for brunch on a Sunday.

While I normally would have opted for an actual brunch type of dish, I decided instead to go with the CORNED BEEF REUBEN with a side of Truffle Tater Tots based on what others had mentioned on Yelp.  The dish sounded pretty good, but to be honest, the truffle tater tots was what got me excited.  It's a combination of two fantastic things!

As far as portions go, the reuben was certainly a winner - the sandwich was practically bursting open.  However, I don't think it tasted as amazing as how others have described.  I certainly appreciated all that meat, but the abundance of sauerkraut was very overwhelming (think sauerkraut with corned beef rather than corned beef with sauerkraut).  Conversely, the tater tots were just as good as I had hoped.  They could have been a little crispier, but that's a minor quibble.  I just wish there had been more!

Even though the service was good enough for me to round up from THREE AND A HALF STARS, I'm rounding down specifically because of price.  The reuben wasn't awful at $16, but $5.00 for a diet coke?  That's ridiculous, even by Vegas standards.  Next time, I'll just stick with a cup of water and get my diet coke comped at the tables.."}
{"text":"Indifferent poor service. Very bad fish and chips. High prices. The only thing passable was the Henry salad. There are better places."}
{"text":"4 Stars for the design, ambiance and service... 3  for the food.  Not feeling like rounding up to 4 starts . 

A friend and I came in on a Saturday evening, we arrived and were seated in the main dining room quickly.  Our first visit we were determined to try and share a variety of dishes to get a good feel of the menu.  We started with drinks I ordered the Ginger Cooler (which was bold and flavorful).  Going for a 3-4 course affair we started with the popovers (lured in by the ham butter on top of the fact they are popovers, I am a big popover fan).   They came out quickly ...I am not used to this for popovers. Leary I touched the popover to find it barely warm.  The plate they were served on seemed warmer.  We advised the waiter and they brought out (just as quickly) another pair.  A little warmer.  Ok, I guess this is their thing.  The ham butter was good but the herb butter was our favorite.  The rich full flavor of the butter and the distinct fresh herb flavor really picked up the warmish popovers. 

 Next we tried the Roasted Brussels Sprout Cesar.  The Cesar dressing was spot on, with a lovely present anchovy flavor and was not like a creamy ranch like dressing as done in so many places anymore. I wished for a bit more brussel sprout and a little less romaine lettuce.  

The main course was tough to decide upon.  We finally went for the Gemelli pasta with bacon.  Now this was a total comfort food, pasta cooked to perfect al dente, rich smooth cream sauce and large chunks of ham/bacon.  I would go back for this.  

When it came time for dessert we asked the question, (based on what we had thus far which we overall considered just ok),\"Was it worth getting/trying? \"  We decided to pass on dessert.  

We absolutely loved the decor and ambiance, while i do see myself returning in the future it is not something I am rushing to get back to all that soon."}
{"text":"Perfectly cooked chicken. Perfectly cooked asparagus. Perfectly crafted kale apple slaw. 
Dropping a star because they forgot someone's salad which they did take off the bill. 
The ambiance here is very unique. The interior decorating is so thorough it's down to the curtains. I was really impressed with the attention to detail spent on the ambiance. It flowed & worked. I never would've picked the florally upholstered chairs but they looked great with the robins egg blue pin cushion bar seats which were very comfortable for bar stools by the way. 
We were a table of 6 and given a comfortable booth. We ordered a drink at the bar before being seated and I thoroughly enjoyed the Cabernet Sauvignon. The G Disruptor I believe was the wine maker. 
I ordered the rotisserie chicken with, you guessed it! A side of asparagus & kale apple slaw. I infrequently order chicken entrees while out, normally stick with adding it to a salad but I felt compelled here. 
It was the best I've had. Perfectly moist and tender. Not even remotely over or undercooked. The skin wasn't greasy either and the seasoning was mild but complimented the meat. It was also a generous portion size which I couldn't finish. It includes the wing. The asparagus was also fabulous, cooked perfectly. The slaw was fantastic and I'm so happy I ordered it. It wasn't sour like some can be, the kale was edible which is an art when uncooked and the apple flavoring came through. It was the right ratio of mayonnaise also, not too much, not too little. I hope to dine here again. It was a great experience minus the forgotten salad and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their entrees. 

Oh and our table raved about the bread pudding. Hearty & heavy, but sweet and delicious."}
{"text":"Was really surprised with my whole visit. Staff was friendly and made sure we got taken care of while we waited for our friends to arrive. The atmosphere was fun and vibrant and of course the food was top notch. Normally not one for trendy spots, but this was a very pleasant night out with some great friends. Definitely hope to come back. The bill was about what you'd expect for a nice night out with friends. Probably a every once in a while place for most, but you'll have a great night when you do visit."}
{"text":"Would recommend every time. The Henry pairs atmosphere with cuisine like most Fox Restaurants...with excellence. The in-house coffee bar offers great drinks if you're simply looking to stop in and study. Otherwise, their menu offers great options for any diner."}
{"text":"Great ambience, location and service. Amazing food. No complaints at all. A great place to take an out-of-town guest."}
{"text":"Ate here while staying at The Cosmopolitan. I ordered the Benedict's Florentine. They used canned spinach, I don't recommend that entree. Potato pancake was pretty good. Other entrees looked better, latte was great and service was great as well."}
{"text":"Overall, throughout the weekend of my stay at the Cosmo I was out in LV for JCK Jewelry Show at the Mandalay Bay, I ate here all 3 mornings. I would highly recommend the Corned Beef and Hash, it was very good. I got egg whites and a side of fruit instead of poached eggs and toast. The fresh fruit is lovely. I did proceed to get this a second day. Now the third day I asked the bartender what he would recommend and he stated the Short Rib Benedict. It was amazing needless to say and I did get a side of fruit to compliment it. The only thing I would have changed was the first day the food did not come out right and the service was sub par. When I sat at the bar the last day ...the food came out so quick and my service was great! Overall the food is pricey but where is it not in Vegas unfortunately!"}
{"text":"Wanted some food late at night and Henry's menu seemed decent enough.  Ordered the French Dip with Truffle Tater Tots and the Henry Burger with French Fries.  My French Dip was actually very moist and flavorful.  Served with horseradish sauce and au jus, I eagerly ate this sandwich up.  The tater tots that came along with it tasted good, but  I didn't taste much truffle in or on them.  Still I'd never pass up a good tot.

The atmosphere was what one would expect at a casino in Las Vegas.  Loud and right there next to the tables.  I would have given this place 4 stars for the food alone.  But the prices seemed high for what we got, even for being in Vegas."}
{"text":"Aside from the random drunk guys approaching us and speaking drunken nonsense, this by far is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. It is in the Cosmopolitan hotel.

I have not had the privilege of dining in but during my last Vegas trip, I ordered from here twice and experienced great food and great customer service from the bartenders."}
{"text":"Would have given a lot more stars. The first time I came here,  I had the Korean Skirt steak. It was absolutely fantastic. I just had to come back with my wife.  And I did. But this time around it just wasnt good. It was nowhere as good as the first time. It was just ok. Not so happy with the lack of consistency. Quite disappointing in fact. But maybe it was just a bad day for the chef. Ok that is fine. But when I mentioned this to our waitress,  her attitude changed. The steak was not her fault,  she had nothing to do with it. But after that she started being short with us and just dropped the check on our table. That is not very professional.  For any restaurant,  the wait staff should be able to take any criticism,  as long as it is doled out nicely. If I never intended to come back here,  I would not bother to express my opinion on the steak. But I did so because I want to come back and have the steak that I had the first time I was here. Not to take away the credit for the truffle fries. They were fantastic by the way."}
{"text":"Fantastic ambiance and decor.  5 stars all the way for that.  Service was very good too and food was also very good.  Solid 4 stars on food, you won't be disappointed. We tried all 3 fish dishes at our table (black cod, salmon and branzino) and we all though black cod was the best.  We wouldn't hesitate to go back.  Nice for kids too."}
{"text":"Attended a group meeting here and I was extremely impressed with the venue, service and food. The staff managed our group well and was attentive to everyone like they were the only customer. I had the filet mignon and I must admit, it may have been the best dam steak I've ever had. I'm currently eating my leftovers and it's just as tender and delicious as the night I ordered it. I have had steak at some of the top places in town but boy did they outdo them. I cannot wait to return and hope you all enjoy!
PS- they have wonderful specialty coffees and the pear dessert was also amazing!"}
{"text":"I am a fan! The service here was so incredible that just on that note, I will come back. The drinks were yummy. My breakfast was incredibly large and worth the price. The special dishes like the benedict, are worth trying and delicious. It's great Vegas try."}
{"text":"I've been to the Henry three or four times already and even though the food is good (nothing too spectacular).. It is quite pricey for what you get. I do enjoy sitting on their beautiful patio but watch out for those bug bites. I left that place with 4 mosquito bites.
Not sure if it will be my top pick on restaurants that I will revisit.. But we will see."}
{"text":"Literally the best brunch on the strip. Came around 1:00 pm Saturday starving from being out the night before. Our waiter was very friendly and attentive and informative. I got the crab cakes Benedict with a side of bacon. Two of my friends ordered the short rib Benedict and my other friend the smoked salmon plate. Everything was SO good. Our waiter was quick to refill our water and coffee. I had a mimosa and asked for one to go (it is Vegas after all) and he gave me the biggest mimosa of my life in a to go cup (score!) We were pleasantly surprised at the price too, seriously not bad for being on the strip. 

All around aesthetically pleasing inside (I mean, it is the Cosmo) and comfy seating. I will DEFINITELY be back here next time I'm in Vegas! 

(By the way, is this the same Henry that they have in Phoenix near the Biltmore?)"}
{"text":"Don't let the trendiness of this place scare you off. Everything we ate here was great. I planned on having matzo ball soup and a choc dessert with marshmellows on top. They had neither that night so we settled for corn beef sandwich, popover appetizers (Yum!). They even offered free flour-less choc cake since they had just taken off the dessert we came for. 
The corn beef was the REAL thing pickled
Somewhere in Phoenix (not Boars head) and was delicious. Warning - don't let them put
Their dressing on it (mayo on corn beef is
Sacrilege), just ask mustard on the side. 
The popovers were melt in yr melt with 2
Infused butter choices that came with it. 
The flour-less choc cake which I usually find too dense was wonderful!  Not too sweet or dense. 
Service was superb. Just make reservations and you won't have a wait."}
{"text":"We'd done Bachelorette bottle service at Voodoo with 14, then we finished the night at Chandelier Bar with 5. We were now down to 3 of us and the Bride still wasn't ready to go to bed so we were seated at The Henry for late night grub. After a redbull I still wished I had her endurance! 

The tater tot nachos were served with amazing short rib type beef, though I didn't care much for the cheese-like nacho sauce. The French Dip was also really delicious. Typical Cosmopolitan Hotel prices of about $17 each and service was also slow, but hey at 4 A.M. this place was still pretty busy."}
{"text":"Honestly why the hell did I pay $15 for 1 1/2  pieces of egg (Millionaire's deviled eggs)?  The yolk mixture was completely under-seasoned and could've used a tiny pinch of sea salt before the addition of their orange sauce, lump crab meat, the touch of truffle oil, a caviar on top.  Because the egg yolk was so bland I honestly could've done without it... I wouldn't have been missing anything.  I also ordered their Deep Fried Mac & Beer Cheese balls... that were recommended by other yelpers.  Boy, I'm never trusting an unknown yelper again!  These were the blandest mac & cheese balls ever!  The only thing that had flavor was the dipping sauce (also re-purposed on the Millionaire's deviled eggs dish).  They could've fooled me into thinking these things weren't supposed to have cheese and flavor in them.  DO NOT get these things!!!  You're just paying for deep fried elbow noodles in the form of a ball."}
{"text":"Can I just say this place was amazing! Honestly the best dish I had ever eaten EVER! The braised short ribs eggs Benedict is life! With first bite I knew I would forever crave this dish! My husband ordered the same thing and loved it. Even the table next to us asked us what we were eating, ordered it and loved it as well. Only down side is that it isn't enough! The service was great too the waiter was attentive and made sure my water was never empty. I'm so glad I found this while we were there. Will always make it to this place whenever I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars :) We made reservations for 7:15 walked in & were seated promptly the staff is good looking & friendly it had a cool vibe , nice decor comfortable layout we started out ordering the short rib potstickers yum !!!! I ordered the Korean skirt steak it was cooked just how I asked & delicious the pozu it was served with has a very spicy kick but amazing flavor :) my husband ordered the buttermilk fried chicken sand which  very tasty !!!! It came with a side of fries those were gross and soggy :( the service was ok really friendly server but was not the most attentive when it came to refills or taking plates away & we had to ask for the check but all in all a good dining experience :) I am looking forward to trying this place for lunch next time ."}
{"text":"The service here was disappointing. We went here to celebrate a special event, and were treated awfully. We were seated out on the patio after a 25 minute wait, only to find the patio practically empty- except for a huge photo shoot that was going on. This included a full crew, very bright lights, and loud conversation directing the shoot. It completely ruined the ambiance and was very distracting. The lights were so bright we had trouble keeping eye contact and spent most of the meal looking down at our plates. We asked to be reseated because of the bright lights, so they moved us a few tables over, which hardly made a difference. The picture shows the view of the shoot from our second table. I love Fox restraints, but we will not be going back."}
{"text":"The breakfast burrito is to die for! Very filling. Good coffee! Super friendly and accommodating staff."}
{"text":"I *adore* The Henry. They kill it with service here. As I said over brunch this morning the staff is incredibly attentive. A buffalo herd of us arrived for breakfast club to sample the wonders of the morning menu. Thank you Seth, and everyone at The Henry for rocking it out to help all 15 of us!

As I have been known to write marathon reviews here's the skinny:
+ fancy looking joint (stunning design) supports a range of dress style
+ incredible drinks w/the best bar stools in history
+ coffee bar area, kid friendly
+ outdoor patio area complete with misters, heat lamps, comfy seating and umbrellas

I'd eat the breakfast burrito again in a heart beat. In my current food coma I really can't describe what is in it. For that I fail you. Read the menu. I'm sorry. My table mates agreed when they sampled that it was gosh darn good. I had planned to take the other half home for lunch. That did not happen. I'm sporting a buddha belly right now.

The fried chicken with over easy eggs and gravy s not a low calorie item. Whatevs. Just get it. You'll thank me. I was envious of the other people at my table. Thank god they threw some forkfuls my way. I was also a fool for not ordering pancakes. Heaven help me. I'd probably lick that plate. Manners? What are they for? Live for today!

I'd really like to take a nap now, however, the gym calls. It's not too late for you heathens to hustle over for some brunch/lunch action. Get it!"}
{"text":"Can't say how much I've begun to treasure this spot.

This is always my late night/early morning fix when craving a sandwich.
The sandwich is a Reuben.  Now it's not going to be as good as say \"Brent's\" here is LA, butl for location and price and convenience, it's a no brainer.  Do get it with TOTS.

All employees have been great and friendly."}
{"text":"Found this place by reading other reviews on Yelp so I thought I'd  give it a try. Took my mom there on Mother's  day and we had a great experience.  Not only was the food great but we had  great  service as well. I didn't have a reservation but they sat me right away in the patio. Our waiter Kevin got our drink order as soon as we sat down. I had the Blue crab quiche and was delicious, my entire family enjoyed their food. I will definitely  come back."}
{"text":"My fave spot for brekkie in town. Try the short ribs egg Benny. Can't get a better eggs Benny anywhere else. And I am an eggs Benny connoisseur!"}
{"text":"After reading all the great reviews we finally made it into Phoenix to try out The Henry. I absolutely loved it! The breakfast menu was not too extensive but there were a lot of tasty items to choose from. I decided on the 2 egg breakfast with bacon. I ordered my eggs scrambled and I think they may have been the best scrambled eggs I have ever had. 
My hubby had the chicken fried chicken which came with biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were absolutely delicious. 
I liked that I was also able to enjoy a Bloody Mary with my breakfast too. Our awesome server Adam told us that they actually have a build your own Bloody Mary cart on the weekends between 10a-2p. I am anxious to go back and give that a try. 
If this was closer to home I'm pretty sure we would be here several times a month. We will definitely be back even with the drive because it was that good. Great food, unbelievable service and a cool atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I stayed at The Cosmopolitan and came to The Henry for breakfast a couple of the mornings. We are both more health conscious and I have allergies to gluten, so we ordered omelettes and oatmeal.
Their steel cut oatmeal is delicious and omelets are made with real egg whites and so fluffy!
Coffee was very fresh and smooth.
The wait times can suck, but the food is worth the wait!"}
{"text":"French dip.  Mac n cheese balls.  Very tasty for a very late night snack."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Only complaint was the late reservation.  Great ambiance. Great staff. Great menu. And delicious food.  Branzino and braised short rib are pretty incredible. Prices are fair based on quality.  Possibly a larger wine list (by glass). Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Eh.. this is the restaurant in the Cosmopolitan and this is terrible!

The price is ridiculous for what is pretty much BELOW Denny's quality ina pretentious atmosphere.

You get martini glass on your table with fine silverware and a nice decor restaurant.  The food is awfully bland.

I ordered the omelette so its exactly egg wrapped with small portions of food.  No flavor.  Add your own salt and pepper and ketchup.  

Oh, BTW, OJ is $6.  AND, the best of all, Henry screwed up my friend's burger.  It looks wonderful, but again, bland and flavorless.  

I wouldnt go.  Go to Hash House A GO GO at imperial palace!"}
{"text":"This place is by far the most disgusting place I've ever had a meal.. based on food. We went in on a Wednesday morning and it was pretty empty. Which is weird cause u would think service would be great... quite opposite actually. He barely checked up on us. God forbid u need a refill... anyways the food, we came in for breakfast. I mean how do u screw up eggs?? They did. It was disgusting. I'm gonna vomit just thinking about it. It tasted like crap, well it tasted like curry. Eww, so watery. Omg yuck. I gotta go"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Huge portions need to get over that hangover from the night before and thier gravy is some of the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Great looking restaurant less than decent food...you basically will pay for the ambiance and what you will eat will be just plain average"}
{"text":"Looking for a later brunch that still had good menu options, we were nervous about this place because the reviews weren't great, but thank GOD we came here...possibly the best breakfast I've ever had...definitely the best French toast I've ever had...and our server Shelby was absolutely adorable. Her service was above and beyond, and she was the sweetest! So personable and on top of EVERYTHING. We didn't need to ask for a thing, she thought of it all! Especially with the bad service we've received elsewhere in Vegas, (which does not discount her in the least, she's amazing regardless, anywhere I've ever been), she was a breath of fresh air. I can't say enough good about her, but I needed to say something because she deserves recognition! :)"}
{"text":"The Henry inside the Cosmopolitan is a 24/7 diner with lounge and table seating. Great for late night snacks but nothing extraordinary for sure. If you're hanging out at Vesper or any of the Cosmo bars around, The Henry is probably your best choice to grab a bite.

The menu has everything from burgers, chicken wings, salads... you name it. Average pricing (burger $12) but kinda slow service.

Our table got the FRENCH ONION SOUP ($12) and the CHICKEN FINGERS W/ FRIES ($15) which tasted as expected. The soup was a good value though.

Would come back if everything else fails."}
{"text":"The Henry at The Cosmopolitan of Vegas. This place is the coolest 24 hour spot. Open layout, cool decor, comfortable chairs. Great Bar area. Awesome service. Our Bartender Brian was knowledgeable and super friendly. Old pro without being jaded. The drinks and food are great. The Wings had a dry rub that was amazing. Then just a touch of wet sauce. Flavor town without feeling unhealthy and gross. Beautiful big Chicken Wings with beautiful subtle heat and balanced flavor. No sloppy drunks. Feels like an upscale restaurant that just happens to be open 24/7 with a simple menu. This is a must. Cosmo is the best Casino Hotel in Vegas."}
{"text":"I have two concerns with writing this review. One, the place gets so popular that it becomes impossible to get a seat in here. Or two, the restaurant decides they are giving away too good a meal and change it up. But seriously folks, best steak and eggs in Vegas...no, Nevada.....no, west of the Mississippi. I'm not kidding though, go there and get it. The steakhouse quality ribeye was about an inch and a half thick, cooked to a perfect medium rare, and paired with three eggs (I ordered over-easy), hash browns, and toast. There was nothing wrong with this meal! Better yet, you can get it any time though want because they are open 24/7. Breakfast for dinner anyone???? So go visit The Henry at the Cosmo, sit down, and tell the waiter or waitress there is no need to give you a menu cause you are having that good ass steak and eggs that Jeff wrote about."}
{"text":"This review is strictly for the coffee shop here. Upon entering, it is obvious that the restaurant had a lot of thought put into it. The design is gorgeous, very modern and comfortable. The girl working at the coffee counter was helpful. The husband had a latte and I got the butcher ( two shots of espresso topped with coffee and sweet cream). Weirdly enough, the two drinks tasted very much the same... they both were overly acidic and just not terribly pleasant to drink. I would like to come back here to try the food/drinks, but for coffee... I don't think so."}
{"text":"Had breakfast outside at this beautiful venue. Latte's were delicious and latte art was beautiful. Six of us in the group and we each had a different breakfast item, all very good!"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast. American style fare, waiters attentive, food takes a while to come out. Drinks never empty and water glasses constantly filled. Had the avocado toast, so seriously delicious and filling.  Friends had the breakfast burrito and granola. Breakfast burrito is ok, kinda dry but ok. The granola was fresh and bright. A nice alternative to buffets and also the long wait for egg slut."}
{"text":"Went a few weekends ago for a friend's birthday brunch. This place was the best! I got the lox bagel and iced coffee. Both delicious! The atmosphere was awesome! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My guest and I were served our meals about 20 minutes apart (literally), terrible service and management!

The Short Rib Benedict was good but on the very very small side with two small short rib pieces. I realize this isn't what other Yelp guests have experienced but this was mine.  I doubt though they had to wait 20 minutes after their guests were served to be served their meal...

There was very little apology for this experience; and if the staff and management doesn't care then why should I care to return for this mediocre experience?  Plus pay full price for it!

Also, $5 for a soft drink beverage is on the high side... I won't be back based upon my experience nor would I recommend the restaurant to others."}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast and got the Brooklyn and it was so good. My boyfriend had gotten an Almond croissant. It was so good, we had to go back the next day and this time I got the croissant and he got a blueberry danish. Our new favorite breakfast spot for sure."}
{"text":"Went here last night after work with a friend, and his friend after they stopped by to see the show I work for. Everything was closed at midnight, on a Friday night, in the middle of summer (Surprise, surprise, out of towners!) at Caesar's Palace so we hopped in the car and I drove us all down to Cosmo. 

My friend is a pescitarian, I don't eat hamburgers and his friend, well, I have no idea. Holstein's was clearly out of the question, and almost everything else was closed. We ended up at The Henry. 

Drinks. We got drinks. A long island iced tea, an apple martini for them, and a \"Beam Me Up Scotty\" martini for me, at $12/ each. The three of us split the fish and chips that never came with tarter sauce ($18.) I'm not a big fan of eating things that filter the same water  they use as a bathroom and die in, so fish isn't my thing. It tasted okay - the coating and the fries were good, but the fish was just bland. 

If you're planning on going when Bond is open, ask to sit in the back. It was hellaciously loud - so loud that I was arbitrarily nodding and saying \"WHAT?!?!\" a million times because I couldn't hear either of my dining partners over the music. 

Our waiter was okay. I'd expect the inconsistent service if my bill was $12 but our bill was substantially higher. He never replaced my friend's fork and we never got that tarter sauce, or refills of water - even though our check still came out to $60+ including tax. Annoying.    

This would be an okay place to eat if you weren't buying expensive drinks and you went while Bond was closed so that you can hear yourself think."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere; however the food is subpar. The signature Benedict was salty and the eggs was runny, even after they themselves sent it back the first time. I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Very cool place, surprisingly relaxed for a Friday night, but I am ok with that! 

We sat at the bar and tried all the Mules they make. The bartender was attentive and FAST, also very nice! She even made us a special tequila Mule from her own concoction! It was great. We went outside and hung out, it was extremely pleasant. I would love to be back! 

Thanks!"}
{"text":"It was a cool business friendly atmosphere and amazing decor. Coffee was good. I was a big fan of the covered parking for Henry guests. My big black truck gets hot fast and having shade to park it under made it much more bearable when I got back in to it"}
{"text":"My wife and her mother and I ate here a few times, I really enjoyed the burgers here, we also enjoyed the french dip, one of the best I can remember in a very long time!!!"}
{"text":"The Henry was the first positive experience we've had in Vegas. The service was fantastic! Vincent was an excellent server - very kind and knowledgable. The fresh OJ was delicious and served in martini glasses. The food was great. I had the short rib eggs Benedict (it sounds weird, I know... but trust me!) It was one of, if not THE best thing I've ever eaten. 

Delicious, quiet and classy!"}
{"text":"Took the family here for breakfast last week and it was a great experience. The wait was modest but immediately my family and I were pleased with the layout of the space. Plenty of room in the oversized booths. 

My brother and I tried 4 of their cocktails and had a hard time picking a favorite. My sister and mother had a couple of their coffee drinks. They were happy with their choices. 

The food was excellent all around. I had scrabble that was on the menu and it was cooked just right. The egg was fluffy but rich and the ingredients were well blended and though out. 

Service was spot on and quick. It was a great trip and we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Late night munchies hit us bad and The Henry was one of the only places open that late. 

We ordered the French Dip with truffle tater tots, and calamari. 

The calamari was too salty and had a little too much breading on it. A lot of the pieces I ate were just breading and not squid. Bummer. 

The French Dip was okay, but only because the calamari was disappointing. According to my boyfriend, it was more like a microwaved sandwich. 

The truffle tater tots were really good, though. They give a decent sized portion, considering it's just a side. 

I'll have to give them another chance one day. We didn't have many options as we just missed dinner and had to order from the late-night menu. 

So we'll see next time!"}
{"text":"The Henry is located near the Strip entrance to the Cosmopolitan.  It is a hearty breakfast spot featuring items such as short ribs Eggs Benedict.

Dropped by here on my last day of my stay at the Cosmo for breakfast.  I ordered the breakfast croissant with avocado.  It was just perfect. The fresh squeezed OJ was poured out of a martini shaker and swirled into a martini glass!  The croissant was the perfect amount of flakiness yet held the sandwich together perfectly.

My colleague enjoyed his omelette and share with me a taste of his hash browns which were seasoned with a tater tot spice!  Yes I would come back here just for that!

Our table was located right in the middle of the aisle too.  Since we were checking out, it was a bit cumbersome as I felt like my bags were going to get spilt upon by the waiter.  Also, if you are checking out by cab, the restaurant is located near the front while the lobby is located in the back of the hotel.

I think that The Henry and the Vesper Lounge should switch locations, but that is really about it.  The food is nice and hearty.  It is what I would define as a full European breakfast that is best served as a brunch for those who like to only eat two meals a day (my recommended strategy when in Vegas)."}
{"text":"Our first meal upon arrival, and it was breakfast. We ordered the breakfast burrito and short rib Benedict. Burrito was big and filling. Chorizo and hash browns grilled inside the flaky tortilla was on point. Accompanying salsa was delicious. 
Short rib Benedict was so savory and delicious. What I think was a rice base (instead of English muffin for example), was topped with short rib meat, Demi glaze and two perfectly poached eggs. Literally couldn't stop eating it. 
The service should not go unmentioned either. It was attentive and much appreciate."}
{"text":"Met a former colleague here for happy hour a week or 2 ago and was pleasantly surprised when I arrived by the ample parking out front and just how HUGE a place this is. I love the feel of it, very rustic and charming décor that really invites you in. 

We sat at the bar and enjoyed some happy hour wine (on tap) and got some bites of food. the short rib potstickers were these awesome melt-in-your-mouth bites of goodness -highly recommend that. The fries were good too, HUGE serving of those and the brie toast was nice, nothing to write home about. I really liked the plating and the visual appeal of the food though, they do such a great job at all the Fox restaurants of recognizing we eat with our eyes first! Love the plating here. Overall, we had a blast, 2 hours flew by and my friend even got a yummy dessert and coffee with Baileys to complete our happy hour date. It was a great time, did the bar staff forget about us as they got busier - sure. Did the check come with a bit of sticker shock for a few apps, 2 wines and dessert - indeed. But its a great spot and I'd love to come back for brunch or something soon."}
{"text":"This is a fun place for everyone .. This was my second time eating here..nice open atmosphere. We had brunch here today , delicious club sandwich and carrot cake pancakes .. The food is great here, my main complaint both times here is the service ... very, very s-l-o-w.. Took over 30 mins for our food, wrong coffee order , no sweetner on table, another 10 mins.. Forget about any refills, had to ask hostess to locate our waiter.. Obvious they do well here but they may need some more training with the staff."}
{"text":"Always top notch service and quality. Also, fantastic spot to grab coffee and get a little work done. One of the best spots in Arcadia."}
{"text":"We love going here for the jalapeño infused Bloody Mary! Every time I have a visitor from LA, I bring them here. So far this place has not let me down.  Steak sandwich was simple and very pleasing. Try the kale & chop salad."}
{"text":"Lovely lunch at The Henry. Started with an order of Cheddar Popovers, They are delightful little puffs of pâté au Choux baked to golden clouds and served with flavored butters. We also split an order of grilled/chilled shrimp that were very tasty. I ordered the roasted half chicken with kale slaw and my husband had the Diner burger with fries. Both entrees were first rate. The chicken with rosemary and lemon jus was a standout and even the white meat was moist. We had to try dessert though we were full, so opted for the croissant bread pudding with ice cream which was truly heavenly. Two espressos to finish off and we left smiling and satisfied with our first visit to The Henry. We definitely will return."}
{"text":"I had a good meal and drink here. One of the newer places in the Arcadia area. I've lived here my whole life and it meets the expectations of the neighborhood. Super classy environment and the staff was good. Great place to take a date. You'll look like a classy gent taking a lady here!"}
{"text":"Have eaten at The Henry several times, primarily after extremely late nice activities within Marquee. This place is one of the 24hr joints located within the Cosmopolitan. Honestly, this is not a bad option if you're craving something at say 4am, lol, it's actually quite tasty. Have had several things from the pancakes, to omelette to the tater tot nachos, all meals have been solid and hit the proverbial \"spot\". Overall, I'd recommend this place, but bring your wallet as it costs a bit more $ then most 24hr casino cafes... 

Pros-
Location
Food

Pricey

Limited late night menu"}
{"text":"2 of us went there for our anniversary dinner. It is a beautiful restaurant that is located off 44th & Camelback. We made a reservation and I recommend that you make one when you go. 

The food was excellent. Started off with the Brussel sprout Ceasar salad and the short rib potstickers. I would recommend both for starters - they even split our salad into 2 servings for us. I ordered the Korean skirt steak over veggie fried rice and tempura green beans. Server let us know ahead of ordering that it was spicy......it was the best. My husband had the black Thai cod - he liked it but he wished that he ordered my dinner. 

Dessert was OMG delicious - chocolate peanut butter banana cake. I highly recommend this dessert. 

Around $40/per person without alcohol. Their drink menu was diverse & creative. 

LOVE LOVE LOVED this place. 

Can't wait to go back!

Ask for Angela she is the best!!"}
{"text":"The Henry is in such a nice building - I really felt like a guest during our meal here. The service was good, though our server was a little new it seemed, making a few minor mistakes here and there. 

We tried the guacamole and the truffle fries to start. I also had the ahi poke bowl which had very well seasoned shiitake mushrooms that I just could not get enough of. To top it all off, we tried a few desserts to share, but the yogurt panna cotta was by far my favorite and the perfect, lighter dessert to end the night. 

The Henry is definitely a great option for a business dinner, since there are various options for different diets and the tables are large and spacious so you can carry on a conversation easily."}
{"text":"Phenomenal experience! Booked the private room for my bachelorette party. The service was impeccable and the food was on point and beyond reasonably priced for a 3 course meal and drinks for 15 people. 

The restaurant itself is pretty casual and lacked the ambiance that I would have liked. Another downside is that there are no bathrooms on site and you have to walk through the casino to get to the nearest one. This was terrible for me as I had to use the bathroom several times during dinner and had on an outfit that required assistance in order to do so. Faults and all, I still think that you should consider this restaurant for a special occasion or just a darn fine meal."}
{"text":"Sam Fox has done it again. Not only do they have great food here, the test kitchen for all Fox concepts us in the back! It's pretty cool to see chefs sitting around chatting about new menus. Breakfast must be ordered at the coffee bar and then you can sit wherever you want. This is a great space to meet people in as well. They have a larger event room in the back and if nothing is going on they let you sit back there as well."}
{"text":"The Henry is the best! I love the environment and food. My mom and I enjoy sitting here and working on our laptops. I usually get the Wildflower with almond milk.  Also, they have amazing baked goods; my favorite morning snack is the vanilla scone or potatoes. Their guacamole is super too. Looking forward to many more study dates here in the future. :)"}
{"text":"We had a reservation but got there early to enjoy a drink at the bar. We checked in, stated we knew we were early and didn't mind waiting until our reservation time. Hostess looked annoyed and said we couldn't be seated until our time. We order a drink and as we are waiting for it she tells us our table is ready. 

The waiter was distracted and not very friendly (but not rude). 

The biggest reason for the 2 stars is my food. My husband had the chicken and loved it. It was juicy and had great pairings. I had a vegetarian dish that had meat as an option to add. I added chicken and when it arrived it was chunks of freezer aisle chicken. Fake grille marks and all. It was mushy and had the freezer taste, same shape. I know it because my roommate used to buy it as a salad topper for lunches. 

Between feeling unwelcome and freezer aisle chicken, I won't be back."}
{"text":"cinnamon french toast was pretty awesome.  wasn't impressed by the omelet."}
{"text":"Centrally located on the strip, beautiful decor, and casual (but elevated) diner meals, all this made for a great brunch experience. 

Last night, I had more than a couple drinks on the strip so I thought I'd eat only a little because my stomach wasn't feeling it. 

I ordered the most interesting item on the Brunch menu: Short Rib Eggs Benedict. I thought it was going to be too much. When it landed on the table, it was perfectly proportioned and my stomach issue had cleared - good thing too, because this thing was delicious all around. It had the best poached eggs resting on perfectly cooked short rib with a bed of hash browns underneath. I ended up breaking the yolk and mixed parts of it together so I could have all the goodness in each bite. 

I want to come back and try more of the menu."}
{"text":"Hash and eggs and as amazing!  It is not typically something I would order, but went out on a limb and was so glad I did!!  The Bloody Mary was good, but not the best.  The fresh squeezed orange juice was tasty!  Next time I go....  It's a mimosa all the way.  For coffee lovers, they serve Illy.  Love that brew!"}
{"text":"The Henry was a great experience for us. The vibe is like a combination of \"Roaring 20s\" combined with mid-century modern. It's done in a very warm and inviting way. The service was excellent. Our server had great suggestions and recommendations for us. The cocktail menu had some interesting and unique choices and the Scotch and Bourbon list was extensive. I had a fig & ginger mule in a hand-hammered copper mug. Delicious! The food was top quality, well prepared and delicious. We had the short rib pot stickers, the Brussels Sprouts Caesar salad, the Thai Peanut Black Cod and the Korean Skirt Steak over Vegetable Fried Rice. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We had tried the Overlook Grill at the Cosmo the morning before, so decided to try The Henry for breakfast this time. Located at the East Tower end near the entrance off the strip, this place is an open and very nicely decorated hip bar/dining restaurant. But for my friends and I, it was a place to try out the breakfast this morning because it looked nice and was convenient. It was about 10am and the place wasn't crowded and there was no line up....so we were seated immediately.

Like at the previous morning, I ordered what was called The Henry Breakfast.... supposedly one of the \"Specialty\" breakfasts. Again, you get to choose how you want your eggs with a choice of pork sausage or chicken apple sausage, hash browns, and toast....I ordered an egg white scramble and the chicken apple sausage this time. My friends ordered the Croque-Monsieur Omelet which was filled with Canadian bacon, caramelized onions
Swiss cheese, with breakfast potato and toast on the side.

The portions were very generous and our server was very nice enough to have the kitchen split their dish into two, and both their plates looked like FULL breakfast orders! The breakfast was excellent and well worth the $18 for all that food.....of course it's a bit expensive, but this is the Cosmo on the Strip....so what did you expect. If you're looking for some place cheaper then I'm sure there's a Denny's somewhere within a few miles of the strip. 

All I will say is the breakfast was absolutely delicious.....my eggs were perfectly cooked, smooth and fluffy, the hash browns unique and yummy, the chicken apple sausage and sourdough toast just made for a perfect.....and very filling.....breakfast. Service was excellent and our server was helpful, attentive, and friendly throughout. We really enjoyed everything."}
{"text":"Came here this morning for my sisters birthday brunch. Slowest service I've ever had. Took 30 minutes for the server to come by and take our drink order. Our food all came out at different times. Unseasoned, tasteless and overall bland. So unfortunate because we love all the fox concepts."}
{"text":"I love the Cosmopolitan Hotel and all the other restaurants in the premise, but this late night eat is just very ordinary and quite disappointing. I came here at 1am and it was busy, but lack of servers. I had the fruit bowl which was lacking with only grapes, strawberries, and pineapple that were dry. The tater tots were overload with everything... First bite was good, but latter was intolerable with grease. Overall, regular diner food with a 4 star price tag."}
{"text":"I love this place. The blood mary cart is super awesome. I have tried three or four items on the menu and they were all delicious."}
{"text":"Very nice & convenient inside of the Cosmo. Wait was not too long to be seated.
Wait staff was great. Orange juice super good! Food... It was ok. I don't want to judge what I had (turkey club) just because I was not too hungry/not really in the mood to eat at the time. But presentation was good!
Well definitely have to come here on my next trip to LV!"}
{"text":"I had physical therapy for 4 weeks straight in the same business complex as The Henry. But it didn't open until my third week. So, to celebrate my final session, my mom and I went over there for a late lunch. 

This place, at least that day, pretty much embodied a healthy cross-section of Arcadia residents. First off, it was really crowded with, I'm betting, people who are Sam Fox loyalists. To avoid a wait for a table, we agreed to sit at a communal table. We ended up next to a group of five. They looked like they had just gone hiking or the two 30-something sisters went to yoga and the rest did something healthy and active. The patriarch in the group was going gaga because he had seen Sam Fox himself on his way inside and got up the nerve to say \"How's it going Sam?\" LOL. There were also a lot of well-dressed business people even though it was that slow week between Christmas Day and New Year's. There were also a lot of people with groups of kids--all well-dressed but a bit hyper of course.

I really like the decor set-up. It's very modern but industrial. There's a bicycle on the staircase that's behind the coffee bar area but not sure if it's someone's actual bike they use or it's there to give urban \"street cred.\" You can go in just for the coffee bar that offers pressed juices. 

As for the food, I was really impressed by the cheddar popovers with the smoked ham butter. They were so airy. I felt like they didn't fill me too much before my warm salmon salad arrived. That salad is probably the best healthy option. I couldn't believe how they combined pretty much every vegetable you hate as a child--cauliflower and brussel sprouts --but made it really flavorful. The salmon was cooked just right. So many times, restaurants screw up salmon. My mother had the C.B. and rye (housemade corn beef). The corn beef was tender but they really pile it on. It's a big sandwich. It keeps well for leftovers the next day, which you might need. 

Considering the crowd of people who are very trendy and the wait, I may let some time pass before I eat there again unless it's on my way to another destination. But overall, I'd take someone here. There's a big enough parking lot that you don't have to do the valet."}
{"text":"What a fabulous spot for a great burger and drink. It's located just inside the Cosmopolitan in an open air corner near the street, it gives you a sense of being in the casino, part of the action but just tucked away enough to take a breather for a minute. The food and drink here are excellent and I do recommend their burger. Noelle is a stellar bartender."}
{"text":"The ambiance is quite good, which is why I meet with friends there on Friday mornings a couple dozen times a year.  But the food, other than the pastries, is awful.  I don't know why I even try to order something hot, because I have tried five times, and they have never gotten it right.

The pastries are fine, so stick with those.  But if you want something more, pick a better restaurant.  This would just get one star based on food alone.  The ambiance gives it another, though."}
{"text":"This place might just be my favorite Fox Restaurant. Finally, an FRC in which the price actually seems to fit the product. The views of Camelback mountain are spectacular at sunset, and sitting outside when the weather is nice or even a bit cool is great (outdoor fireplace)! I loved the inventive cocktails, but I have to say my favorite part was the lasagna in béchamel sauce. Amazing! My honey ordered the turkey sandwich with fries. The sandwich was adequate but nothing extremely memorable. However, dipping some of his fries in the béchamel sauce was heavenly! I'm tempted just to order the fries and see if they can whip up some of the sauce for me as an app on my next visit!"}
{"text":"4.5/5 stars!

My first visit to the Henry was delicious!
Even on a Tuesday night, this place was packed...make a reservation. 

Decor is cozy and unique- I almost felt as though I was dining in someone's living room.

We each had a wine on tap-good selections and, and I tried the delicious scallops. Would highly recommend. Good size portion on a bed on creamed corn with a chorizo drizzle...so good!

Service was good. Our waitress was not extremely friendly, but we got everything we wanted. 

Will return!"}
{"text":"I love the Henry!
The decor is absolutely charming. The food is phenomenal!
And I love the servers there! They are both attentive but aren't like helicopter moms of the food industry. It's a comfortable amount of attention. I recommend this restaurant to all of my friends/family/out of town visitors!"}
{"text":"Really enjoy the vibe here. It is always busy and on weekends reservations are almost always necessary, The food is priced well and there is a decent variety. Weekends they serve breakfast all day, which is great when you get up late or live out in the East Valley.

They changed the chicken and waffles. See latest review."}
{"text":"My amazing man brought me here for my birthday. Our waiter was Craig, he had perfect timing didn't bother too much but was there when we needed anything.
The food was amazing. We had potstickers, chilled shrimp, steak and tortelli. All of it was perfect. 
I highly recommend it! You will want to make a reservation though."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after a staycation. Long line to get a table but so worth it. My hubby said best eggs he has ever had... and he is picky. Delicious hash browns and coffee is really good for regular restaurant coffee. It's Illy. Yum! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Great people watching and even better food! Coffee bar is on par! Danielle is great with the refills! Che che Che check it out!"}
{"text":"We were checking out of the Cosmo but wanted breakfast before we left! Being a group of five and being seated right away at noon wasn't completely expected! And our compliments to Eddie, our waiter: he was very accommodating with us! One of the drinks we had wasn't at all expected and he got something else that was to our flavor! He also was extremely nice and fun to laugh with the many times he came to see us! Thank you for taking care of us!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Meals are good, coffee is amazing, ambiance is great and the service is consistent.   I love the space, it's good during the day for reading, working, meeting friends or grabbing coffee.   Their private rooms are awesome for dinner parties.  I continue to come back...  it's awesome."}
{"text":"Bottom line first:  nice place with drawbacks 

We arrived just a little after 11am. I thought that's reasonably early for Sunday brunch, but we were quoted and waited 40+ minutes to be seated.  I almost got into an argument with the hostess when we were updated \"10 more minutes\" when we had to still wait double that time, not to mention seeing some parties seemingly able to walk in without being placed in the queue.  Having said that, I checked out the line at Eggslut, and the line wrapping around the wall was likely at least a 30 minute wait also. 

Once seated, the service was very good. We ordered immediately because we were obviously starving by then. Fortunately, both the short rib egg Benedict and Brioche french toast came out fast.  They were both very good, although not spectacular. The latter was gigantic; I had to ask for a box to fit the last 1/3. 

Aside:  I was not convinced that the bottled water provided for every table was truly bottled, as it had a slightly funny taste, but it was free, so I guess I can't complain too much. 

Tip: Call 702-698-7280 for direct line to the restaurant for placement into the queue. That is, if they're not too busy to pick up the phone. 

Just realized after I wrote the review initially: you can book a reservation on Yelp!

Downer:  no validation for parking anywhere in Cosmopolitan. Prepare to pay $7 for parking between 1-4 hours."}
{"text":"Wow.  Tried the Henry after a long hot hike up Camelback.... It was fantastic!  We looooved the quinoa tacos and the roasted Brussel Caesar.  Service was a tick slow but the food was sooooo worth it.  Beautiful decor, as I've come to appreciate at all the Fox restaurants.  Well done Henry!! We will back!"}
{"text":"I had the meat loaf and it was great. The sauce was glazed and spicy. Rochelle treated us amazing we came in on a Sunday night and was a pretty big party. There wasn't a lot of people and she paid a great attention to us."}
{"text":"The only reason this place got two stars is the freshly squeezed orange juice. The food is pricey and the taste leaves much to be desired. I think you might be better off finding a 2.99 steak and eggs rather than spending upwards of $50 for breakfast here!"}
{"text":"We wanted this place to be great and well it just isn't. If you are coming for food find another spot. If you get the right seat and you can see the happening casino at least you know what you are paying for. Next time I'll gamble with my money not with my food."}
{"text":"I'm torn between giving this place 3 stars and 4 stars.

The best thing about this place is the atmosphere.  I loved the decor and the furniture.

The food was slightly better than average.  I ordered the quinoa tacos, which I enjoyed but wasn't crazy about.  My boyfriend ordered their brisket, which was actually really tasty, but too fatty for his preferences.  My other friend ordered their vegetarian pasta, but the entree was too small for him.  He was still hungry afterwards and ended up ordering a side.

Overall, I am not very likely to come here again, just because there are other restaurants I like better in close proximity to this place."}
{"text":"The henry is a nice expensive place to have breakfast. It cost $160 for 4 girls and that's just with one meal and one drink. The breakfast was very delicious though and our waiter steve was absolutely so kind! 

Steve was highly attentive and very kind- he even gave us advice the best ways to take cabs in vegas since we expressed we were having issues. 

Our food ticket got lost- we were wondering why it was taking so long for breakfast to come but steve was honest and told us and gave us a free round of mimosas! 

I would totally come back here."}
{"text":"Food is great but the atmosphere is better. Cocktails were divine, and the coffee is delicious. Highly recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Fun hip and relaxing place to grab a quick meal. Prices are reasonable considering it is in the hotel.  Easy to fuel up and get back out for fun."}
{"text":"Was looking forward to going here for quite some time. Not sure if Fox concepts are having some issues but each of the concepts that I have gone to in the last 5 to 7 months have had multiple issues with their service food and just a general lack of caring at the facility. Managers usually take care of it but I'd rather have it correct and not have to send back food multiple times because it's cold or the wrong food or not cooked correctly. I hope it's just a string of unlucky circumstances and it will improve. Last night came in we shared a salad and The Bolognese. The salad was good The Bolognese came out cold and the pasta was undercooked and hard. We were also one of three tables in the entire restaurant so they were not busy. I hope you guys get your stuff together because I enjoy almost all of your Concepts but losing a little faith and them at this point."}
{"text":"We chose to The Henry for breakfast one morning because it had good reviews. We went there and it was pretty delicious! I got the California omelette, which came with roasted potatoes done to perfection and your choice of bread (though if you don't get the banana bread, which is phenomenal, you are insane). The omelette was buttery and perfect, topped with a few slices of avocado and stuffed with insane amounts of bacon and cheese. My fiance got the Strawberry Shortcake pancakes with a side of hash browns. The hash browns were his absolute favorite. Overall, not a bad place for breakfast! 

My only complaint is that it took a little while to get our food, as we waited over half an hour after ordered to be served. They're very popular and very busy!!"}
{"text":"I was here for brunch and the food was quite amazing. The Bloody Mary cart that comes right to your table is a nice little perk! The only reason it didn't get five stars was the excessive wait time to get a table. It's not a place you can be in and out quickly."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite Fox restaurant in terms of decor, menu and vibe. While it's certainly at a higher price point than some of the other concepts, most everything is executed well and seems *worth* the extra cost. Fabulous place to celebrate an occasion/holiday and feel like you're getting more of a casual splurge. The only criticism I'll agree with from the assessment of other reviewers is the incredibly slow service. 

The interior is gorgeous, somehow making a nice open space feel cozy and chic at the same time. You have the option of camping out at the bar, relaxing on the adorable couches for more of a happy hour feel or sitting in the main dining area - all are full service. No matter where you sit though, I've found you'll be waiting a while. To be acknowledged, for your waters, your first drink order, any refills, etc. I don't know why such a great place with really nice staff has such. poor. timing. Our servers have always been friendly, knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the menu - it's not a personality issue. Are they just over capacity? Is there some kind of request-x-2-only refill policy on water? We've come here before and sat in the high-top area for 20 minutes before deciding to leave and dine elsewhere - which sucks because I know how great the food and cocktails are.

The food is ridiculously delicious. The warm kale dip is so garlicky good and don't miss out on the popovers. All of the seafood entrees are to die for (I'd choose this over Buck & Rider any day for the price) and that Croissant Bread Pudding is no joke. It's an absolute must regardless of how tight your pants feel after dinner. Wash it down with a cappuccino for a real indulgence. It's worth mentioning that the food itself is served up pretty quickly. I'd love to rate this as 5 stars, but slow service is just too consistent. And I LIKE long, drawn out meals where you're not pressured to leave. I LIKE servers who give you space without checking in every 5 minutes. But conscious, attentive yet considerate service is so different than elusive, hard-to-flag-down service. Sigh...I'll be back again and again, but not if those hunger pangs have already set in."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for an early breakfast. Staff was attentive and friendly. Ordered a couple of bloodies which were very tasty, though the cucumber slice looked drier than the desert. 
Ordered the corned beef hash and steak eggs Benedict. The sauce on the Benedict was delicious and the steak was falling apart in the best way. The corned beef hash was the greasy sort, but had a nice, refined taste. 
I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice breakfast"}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere, good food. My ole Kentucky drink was a little bland. Staff seemed nice. Easy parking."}
{"text":"Lots to love...but just as much to be underwhelmed over. 

First off, upon walking in, you'll notice the decor and ambiance is fabulous...in a super hip, friendly manner. Could be an amazing happy hour spot...if they have one. 

The caveat here...you have to find parking first. So if you only have a small lot, why no valet???

The next feature is the menu. At first, I was a bit put off by how boring and minimal it was. The descriptions are horrible so ask the staff (if you can find them. More in that later.) But having gone a few times with groups and tasting from friends meals, I can say that all are good....not amazing, but very good. 

Service both times was lackluster. I've had to flag down staff just to order a meal or to get another drink."}
{"text":"Bar / restaurant

I was strolling and needed a drink and after standing at the bar area across from the Henry for a good 10 minutes and being ignored, I looked over and saw that the Henry a) had a bar and b) was basically empty.

I strolled across the hallway, plopped down and got served in seconds.  My kind if place.

I did not eat here, so this is essentially for the bar area only.  Fast and friendly bartender and well made drinks- what more could you ask for?

A perfect perch for people watching - and it is a nonstop freak show in Vegas so grab a cocktail and have some fun.

Definitely a must try - the food looked good from what I saw, but have no comment on it.

Give it a whirl if in the Cosmo."}
{"text":"This review is for the appetizers selection. Even at 2:30am, the food is surprisingly really good. My wife and I were hungry after partying and drinking and just ordered from the appetizers selection, because eating a full entree at 2:30am is just not good. We shared the buffalo wings and the tater tots with braised short ribs. The buffalo wings were good and not rubbery textured. Good flavor and meet my expectations. The tater tots with braised short ribs was excellent and filling. It could've been an entree. Pricy restaurant for a 24 hour cafe, but then it's Vegas and it's the Cosmopolitan Hotel. I'd definitely come here again to satisfy late night, early morning, post-club, hunger cravings."}
{"text":"Other than the fact that a reservation is only an appointment to be late the place is worthy of its four star rating. Its comfort food at a comfortable price. Decor is great, the staff friendly and helpful. Will certainly be back with the expectation of waiting with or without a reservation."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat at the Cosmo. The food is always fresh and the service is always friendly. The menu has a variety of healthy options and more decadent if like too. Always book a reservation on open table for breakfast. There's usually a wait list and they will get you in faster if they can."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Love the French Toast. Breakfast burrito was also excellent. Coworkers really like the smoked salmon as well. When other spots are full, this is a great choice."}
{"text":"We were headed to Gordon Ramsay's Burgr but the line was disgusting. We had two kids (7 and 9)  so waiting wasn't an option. We went back to our hotel knowing we would pay a lot for mediocre food. From the outside, The Henry looks like that kind of restaurant. Pay a lot, get a little of meh food. 

We were so pleasantly surprised. We all felt like we went a full day at an amusement park so we had little patience and a lot of hunger. 

The chicken noodle soup was the best we've had a restaurant ever. Real shredded chicken and broth that didn't taste like it came out of a can or carton. The steak was uh-mazing! Perfectly cooked and the split was as if we both ordered separate meals. It was such a great deal!!!

Love this place and there was no wait! We're going to remember this place the next time we come back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed this trip. Went to the Henry our first stay 4 years ago at the Cosmopolitan and breakfast was always great. This go around it was quite different. The coffee was bitter, the omelets were unremarkable, consisting of meager amounts of ingredients. My husband omelet had all the ingredients thrown on one end. Service was good, no complaints there. Once was enough, we didn't return for breakfast our two remaining days."}
{"text":"This place is divine.  We just so happened to bump into it coming into the Cosmo from the Bellagio and decided to make dinner reservations after the show. Once we arrived which was a Saturday night we were kind of skeptical about the decision that we made to eat here because it was empty.  How unusual for any restaurant in Vegas on a Saturday night. Glad we did though.  I had the burrito which was very flavorful.  But I must admit, the salmon BLT that my friend had totally overshadowed my burrito.  OMG was it good.  The service was excellent.    Like I said glad we made the decision. We were seated immediately and had a wonderful server.  I also liked the fact that the seating arrangement directly in front of the casino offered good people watching."}
{"text":"Love The Henry! Great ambience and service.  It a busy restaurant so making reservations are highly recommended. Wonderful menu that is well thought out, not overly extravagant like they are trying to make a point. But hearty food that's yummy!

Note to the management. We had Luis wait on us and he was very thoughtful and provided exceptional service. We heard later that this was just his third day! So great hire, keep it going!"}
{"text":"I was impressed with the quality and portions of comfort food served at The Henry.  While open 24 hours, it is much nicer than a standard coffee shop, with a rather luxurious clubby atmosphere.  To call it a coffee shop would be a misnomer.

During Restaurant Week I began with a giant crock of French Onion Soup brimming with melted Gruyere on the outside, and sherry and a quickly deconstructing Crostini on the inside.  It was a superb, cheesy first-class Onion Soup Gratinee!

I next enjoyed a chopped Caesar Salad prepared with a light and tart Caesar Dressing and nice crunchy croutons, although no anchovies were available to kick the dish up a notch.

For my entree I selected Meatloaf with Whipped Potatoes, gravy, a slab of spiced up bacon, and peas.  The Meatloaf was moist and really comforting with the Brown Gravy slathered liberally over it.  And for dessert I savored a really traditional New York Style Cheesecake with Strawberries and Strawberry Sauce.  Diane liked her Fish & Chips.

Service was fine, portions generous, and the ambiance upscale.  This is a classy 24-hour eatery on the Strip, and, after eyeing a magnificent-looking Cheeseburger a table away, I expect to return to it often for one of my many late-night dinners.  It should suffice nicely as a suitable replacement for Caesars Palace's now shuttered Central."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast on a Tuesday morning and there wasn't much of a wait at all. I got the California Club omelette and it was superb. They used a great cut of bacon, the egg was perfectly cooked, and the potatoes were soft and seasoned well. Our server was attentive and anticipated our needs repeatedly. I loved the atmosphere here too. Very trendy and upscale. I'll definitely come back here the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"The Henry is one of the best breakfast places in Las Vegas.  I can't really tell you what my favorite breakfast is because everything is do good!
The skillets are amazing, the 3 egg and ham potatoes and county toast is really good, the breakfast burrito is so good and the pancakes or French toast is a treat if you want something sweet.
The service is fantastic you never have to ask for anything as they staff is on their game.  Just before they bring the bill they ask if you want coffee to go.  
Go early on the weekends or you can expect a 45 minute wait.  Week days we've walked in with little to no wait."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing environment! The design both interior and exterior is amazing! I took a friend from out of town here for brunch and it was a great place to be for the view. 

So my experience was subpar. I won't complain and I always give the server/restaurant the benefit of the doubt but my first experience was so bad that it was funny. My friend was ordering tea and had 3 different servers come back 4 different times before he got the tea. He asked a server that came over what tea they had, the server said \" I don't know, let me grab another server\", 2nd server came and he asked what tea do you have, server said \"let me see the menu\" Came back a few minutes later and my friend said Pearl Green Tea. The 3rd server, Our original server, comes back now and asks I heard you want tea, which tea do you want and my friend says again Pearl Green Tea and we finally get the tea.

There were many experiences like this on Saturday and the place wasn't too busy, but I wasn't going to give the server a hard time. Although it was a little frustrating, I just laughed it off. 

I ordered the spicy chicken scramble and it was pretty basic and nothing special nor good and i don't think it was worth the money.

My friend ordered the fried chicken waffle and said the gravy had no flavor and had to ask for some salsa to give some flavor the meal.

I would have to say my favorite part of this brunch was my Fresh Squeezed IPA haha"}
{"text":"We had brunch here during our honeymoon getaway last year and for our anniversary this year. Everything we have had were nothing short of amazing. The Corned beef hash was just full of flavor and delicious. The same could be said for the Ham and cheese sandwich and the Piled High Reuben Corned Beef sandwich. We got the tater tots as sides this year and they were pretty tasty. Warning!!! the portions were huge and we probably could have shared one sandwich and called it good. (we skipped dinner that night) The menu has a lot of classic diner food, but also some healthy choices as well, like yogurt with fruit and granola and oatmeal. The service and quality was everything that we expected with any of the restaurants in and associated with the Cosmopolitan Hotel."}
{"text":"I love The Henry. Yes, it's part of a giant chain of restaurants, but this one is a gem. The decor first off, is awesome. Sitting in there makes you feel cool, instantly. They have an excellent selection of beverages; alcoholic and non. The menu isn't huge, but everything I've had has been done near perfection. 

My favorite appetizer is their short rib potstickers. They're so tender and delicious, it's not right. 
They have a great burger, a flavorful and satiating Turkey French Dip, and a Butter Poached Lobster salad that'll make you tune out your lunch/dinner date.

They serve a really great brunch on Saturday & Sunday and there will be Mimosas and a Bloody Mary Bar Cart coming around to make your life complete. Go. Go now."}
{"text":"Server attire way too hipster for me. Food is alright service lackluster. Not impressed at all. Decor kinda saved the day."}
{"text":"This spot is quite nice.  There was a 15 min wait so I went to the bar and ordered the best bloody mary!!!.  Sweet with a hint of spice!  Awesome.  Sat down and we started with the tater to nachos with braised short ribs.  4 out 5.  I ordered the braised rib eggs benedict.  3.5 out 5.  See pics"}
{"text":"The place is kinda pricey for their offerings, but then again it's on the Strip.

If you are here for breakfast, then you must try the braised shortribs benedict.  It is rich but still tasty enough for others to try.  The meat--being braised--is indeed very tender and quite lean.

On a different occasion, I had the Henry Burger.  I was not impressed.  It was OK and leaning towards the bland end of the spectrum.

Also, on this trip, I ordered the chicken alfredo.  That was OK as well..."}
{"text":"Fourth visit - 5 stars for service and environment and COCKTAILS. 4 for food as breakfast potatoes are a \"what?\"  

Try the Bloody Mary from the cart, sample a mixed drink from the menu, or ask for your favorite spirit crafted to suit your mood. They have the bar thing down. Breakfast is our favorite meal so we know omelets. The Egg White Turkey is perfectly prepared with plenty of flavor and filling. It's not the best ever, but certainly not bad. No words exist in the English language to describe the ingenuity of carrot cake pancakes topped not with standard cream cheese icing but a dollop of a butter infused with cream cheese. My cakes were just shy of fully cooked - 5 stars for the concept, 4 for execution - but the meal was still delicious. 
Ron, our server, presented perfectly and knows his spirits, too. Live music was excellent."}
{"text":"Was looking for a place to eat breakfast n came across this on yelp...made a reservation n got a seat right away when i got there..there were people waiting outside...i tried the braised short ribs benedict..so very delicious! Braised short ribs wit its own sauce.. so very tender..and 2 poached eggs topped with hollandaise sauce all on a pancake sized crispy hash browns..i ate every bit of it! Awesome food n friendly service...i will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in today for breakfast while on vacation.  The reviews were great on Yelp, but we were disappointed.  During the week, you order breakfast from the coffee bar and it is delivered to you table.  I will say that I gave it 3 stars because it is beautiful inside.  I mean it...this space is amazing.  The coffee was gross.  The service was awful.  My scramble was dry.  The portions were quite small.  Maybe try it on the weekends when they supposedly have full service."}
{"text":"In a nutshell: Fancy-ish eatery at the Cosmo.

Came here at like 3AM and wanted some late night breakfast style food to soak up the large amounts of...uh...soda. The Henry is 24 hours so it's a great place to eat if you're not willing to eat fast food late night, and it's a great place to go if you end your night after Secret Pizza closes.

Parking 4/5
If you're coming here as late as I did...you shouldn't be driving anywhere.

Ambience 4/5 
Lots of comfortable seating and booths. Late night you won't get the hustle and bustle of the casino, because the tables in this section close. 

Wait time 4/5
Fine, just fine. Didn't notice waiting for food, and we got sat down immediately.

Food 4/5
Needed something to soak up my sins. Here's what I got:

Grilled cheese and tomato soup - A
So. Good. Grilled cheese had three different cheeses. Crispy on the outside and ooey-gooey-cheesy in the middle of every bite. Tomato soup had Pedro in it. Interesting addition...loved it!

Service 4/5
Server was great. She took our order quickly and made sure we had LOTS of water throughout our visit.

Overall 4/5
Really good and simple food. My brother-in-law had the short rib benedict which he really liked. I just feel like the prices are a little too steep for the food they offer. Other than that, awesome."}
{"text":"It was busy when I went.   Told it would be 30 minutes. No problem for me.  It not like there nothing to do around the restaurant.  It's in a casino.  But then told if you are not standing at the front when your name is called then you get passed.   Even my local chain restaurant has the device to alert your table is ready.   Maybe a text message.   It is 2016.  Why would you not want people to gamble while they wait.   Come back in 20 minutes and stand.   That because there is no chairs.  No big deal unless with and old person.   The 30 minute window was way off.  It turned into 50 minute wait.   Table still had crumbs on it from the last person.   Service good.  Had a Bloody Mary.  I would give this a 1 star.  However I never found a very good one in Vegas though.  Food was good.   Big portions and was fast."}
{"text":"Two stars are for 
the waiters attentiveness, water, and fries

The food was not great. I had the tater tot nachos and also the hot wings. The nachos were overly greasy and caused me to wake up multiple times for obvious reasons. The wing were flabby. Needed to be fried a longer time. Bill ended up being 47 before tip felt like I got grapped."}
{"text":"Im always looking for a quick bite to eat on the way into work. I have a picky palette and always end up at the trendy spots. I read that The Henry opened and decided to stop in on the way in to the office. First off , the people that work in the commercial building are so lucky to have a cool lunch spot to go to . The restaurant is beautiful like something you would see in Elle Décor. You just want to spend half of your day there it looks so inviting. The Staff is so friendly and attentive to you likes and made you feel at home. Now to the food , I ordered the breakfast sandwich (minus mayo) and it was built on a fresh brioche bun . The bun was not too thick and had the perfect layer of egg , bacon , cheddar and avocado. Simple, but delicious ! I will be a regular guaranteed ."}
{"text":"The Fox restaurant group is the best in all of Scottsdale, every place they own is unique and consistent."}
{"text":"Everything about this restaurant is a hit! The service the food and the drinks. Sad we found it on our last day of staying in the Cosmo but, now I have found this hidden gem I will always make sure to stop here for brunch! 

Ps. Make sure to order the French toast, breakfast platter, or Ruben Sandwhich 

Great for brunch"}
{"text":"Need a quick bite? This is probably your best bet.  It seems like most people here for breakfast are doing just that.  The breakfast sandwich is delicious, but not super filling, and I recommend the Fresh OJ.  You'd better bring your casino winnings, though, because it's not cheap to eat here (Vegas prices).

I ate at the bar, which had easy access to the server and the news station.  I'd probably eat here again, but I'll consider bringing b-fast on my own next trip..."}
{"text":"The Henry is located inside of the Cosmopolitan.  As soon as you walk in the main entrance, it's on your right.  It looks like an upscale, formal bar and more on the serious side compared to The Henry's counterpart-Bond, across the way.  

The customer service was OK, nothing that blew me away.  Honestly, the bartender seemed kind of annoyed that we only ordered 2 shots.  We were actually just bar-hopping from The Henry, to Chandelier and to Bond.  Of the 3, I prefer The Henry the least probably because it has the most serious setting and it seems a little more intimate and formal compared to the 3.  

Price was on the higher end.  We paid about thirty-something dollars for 2 shots.  The Henry was good to try but it's probably not somewhere I would go regularly if in the Cosmopolitan area."}
{"text":"I don't think I have ever loved a French toast as much as I loved it here. I ordered one thinking I'll need a side with it, but the serving size can easily feed three people.

There cocktails are pretty good too and the bartender makes a mean bloody Mary. 

For dinner, the salads are fresh and wholesome. I had the mixed greens Salad with shrimp and was very impressed with the quality of the greens and how the shrimp was cooked.

This place is a hidden gem at Cosmo. One more reason why we always stay here."}
{"text":"We popped into the Henry after a fabulous brunch elsewhere for some cocktails to celebrate my best friends birthday. We placed an order for one round of drinks and never saw our waitress again. I had to ask the hostess for her to come to our table to place an order for our second round (annoying). She took our order then forgot about our drinks. We received our second round then never saw her again. The Restuarant is not busy and we are beyond disappointed. After my empty water sat there for over an hour and I asked for a refill, the waiter plopped ONE water down for me (and no one else) and stormed off. Wow. Really? We won't be back."}
{"text":"Loved everything about our dining experience. The warm croissant bread pudding was a menu standout....nothing short of WOW"}
{"text":"We frequent Las Vegas - this has to be the best Brunch we've had. The Bloody Mary's are simply phenomenal! Would highly recommend. Also, the waitstaff was well versed and very welcoming."}
{"text":"Disappointing. We were SO looking forward to a terrific meal here on Easter and came to find that the menu was a shortened version of their regular brunch menu. I would have loved to know this ahead of time - put it on your website or share this bit of news when I make my reservation. The things I was most looking forward to weren't available. Our waiter was a bit off - was he new? If so, I'll excuse it. But we didn't know his name for about three visits. Water wasn't refilled and coffee was horrible. The table was quite tight for six average adults. What'd we have for brunch? The french toast was average... The bagels were toasted nicely but the salmon was WAY too salty... The quinoa tacos were good but where was the guacamole listed on the menu?? ... The bacon was absolute genius - thanks for that... The crab quiche was the best thing on the table, truly... And the eggs and corned beef - good but no mention on the menu that it would be an omelette. Strange. We loved the popovers for appies and the caramel roll was magnificent. Great vibe here and the hot cocoa made with almond milk almost made up for my disappointment... but not quite."}
{"text":"For a 24 hour spot in a hotel on the strip, The Henry is not half bad!  Located on the first floor in the far end of the casino, The Henry is a lush open room with modern decor that compliments the Cosmo well. I came here for breakfast to meet up with some out of town friends, and the food was good, service was efficient, and overall the whole dining experience was very comfortable. 

Try the signature Short Rib Benedict. It's rich and meaty and overly decadent :) Oh, and it's served on a hashbrown...drool!!  Skip the OJ even if it's cute and served in a martini glass....it's not fresh squeezed."}
{"text":"The Henry is always on my list when I come to Las Vegas. I have been here five or six times for breakfast over the years and always enjoy the high quality and tasty food. But what is really memorable: the service is just top notch! Many restaurants in Vegas don't worry too much about the hospitality part of their establishments- and they ultimately pay the price. From the hostess to Vincent the server who treats everyone with kindness (and patience!), to the food runners to the bartenders...everyone seems to care about creating a wonderful culinary and rich dining experience for their customers. It can be a little loud in the restaurant later in the morning but it's often a quiet and tranquil refuge in the oasis of noise and self-centeredness that is Sin City. I know they say \"what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas\" but this place is something I will shout about for all of my days. Don't miss it!! The Henry knows how to serve it up right!"}
{"text":"(MOST RECENT VISIT) TIME/DATE: Monday, December 17, 2012 / 12:30pm

AMBIANCE: I absolutely LOVE all of the Cosmopolitan's interior designers. Every single area of the Cosmopolitan shows impeccable attention to detail, including the Henry. From the brown leather wall paneling, the belt loops around the bar stools, the cushy button tufted booths, and how all of it just comes together.. gorgeous.
PRICE: $20-$30/person
VALUE: It seems to really depend on what you order. I saw my friend order a waffle for breakfast, and it looked extremely plain and unsatisfying. I feel like a lot of the other lunch/dinner items seem pretty solid, but I've really only tried (and loved) the French Dip. (The Cosmopolitan is really the first Las Vegas hotel/casino I've been to where a majority of the restaurants typically serve good food, and the Henry is no exception.)
CHANCE OF RETURNING: 100%

___________________________________

:::: THE FOOD ::::

* THE FRENCH DIP - $16
          - [4/5 - The best french dip I have ever tasted. The melted swiss cheese over the tender juicy layers of prime rib... mmm. I also love the horseradish sauce and the au jus is deliciously flavored and generously (yet appropriately) salted.]
* TRUFFLE TATER TOTS (Included)
          - [4/5 - Perfectly cooked, the right amount of crunch on the outside, soft on the inside. The truffle oil was used appropriately - it's not overwhelming, yet there's no mistaking it's presence.]

:::: THE DRINKS ::::

* BEAM ME UP SCOTTY - $12
          - [4/5 - One of my favorite breakfast drinks - an espresso \"chocolate\" martini with cream vanilla syrup that contains a Van Gogh Dbl and Tia Maria. Really tasty!]
* BLOODY MARY - $12
          - [4.5/5 - To date, one of the best Bloody Marys I have ever had. I always ask them to make it extra spicy for me, and they never fail. They also put a generous amount of horseradish in it.]
* VIRGIN BLOODY MARY
          - [4.5/5 - The last time I went to the Henry, I was pregnant and yet really craving the flavor of the Bloody Mary. They made me a virgin one that knocked my socks off. It was so refreshing and spicy, though I did add a few extra dollops of Tabasco.]"}
{"text":"Hubby and I tried this place with the breakfast club on a Saturday morning and it did not disappoint. The décor is very charming both inside and out and the service was fantastic. On top of it all we both enjoyed our food. I ordered the Flower Child scramble which was very tasty and it came with a side of potatoes. All of it was just delicious. Portion sizes are a bit on the small side so I am glad I also got the bruleed grapefruit. This was really amazing, I highly recommend it. They have a bunch of really great sounding coffee drinks but I'm still trying to keep the caffeine intake down so I stayed away from those. Maybe next time since I know we will be back!"}
{"text":"A decent place to stop by and eat. Food is a little pricey because your on the strip.  It definitely does the job for your stomach and taste buds.  This is the Henry breakfast. Good sized meal with ham and eggs, hash browns aren't to good."}
{"text":"Get the Ruben on sourdough!! Best Ruben you will ever have!!!! AND truffle tots!!!!service is always great too!"}
{"text":"We had the most wonderful experience.  Our server, Brittany was amazing.  My husband asked if they had chicken tenders, and our server came back and said that the chef had the flour ready and he was making them.  They were amazing!  It is so obvious that this restaurant, and our server, wanted to make sure that our experience was the best!

This is, by far, our favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Friendly front staff to welcome us and same with our server.
My boyfriend ordered the Short rib benedict whiich was quite pricy but meat was moist and tasty.  I had the lox w bagel and capers and it was better than the ones I usually get as I would expect it to be paying $18 with soft cream cheese and tasty lox,  but I normally wouldn't pay that much for that dish."}
{"text":"I returned to The Henry just for the truffle tater tots.  They didn't disappoint!  Also, the drinks at the Cosmopolitan are among the best on the Strip."}
{"text":"The food was good but was out there. I been actually wanting to try this spot for a long time and I wasnt disappointed nor was I amazed.

I ordered the potato skins which were actually very good. 
The fish and chips the batter on the fish was a little soggy. 

My girlfriend ordered the chicken salad which was delicious and the salmon which had no flavor and was plain."}
{"text":"I had a beautiful Sunday brunch here with friends. I had the Bahn mi sandwich and I will definitely get it again because it's delicious. The service was fair. The space is beautiful inside and out though! I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"The Henry is really good. I've been there twice now, nice crew, good servers. The food is very tasty and they have nice vegetarian options. I do suggest making a reservation. Oh and the blueberry pie is delicious. I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Fox did reach out and showed that they truly cared about my review. I was glad to see that it really mattered to them, and that they took it to heart. We have not been back to The Henry since, but we have been over to Dough Bird several times, which Fox Concepts has knocked out of the park. I will do a separate five star review on Yelp. Dough Bird has become one of my Wife's favorite restaurants by the way. Fox thanks for reaching out and truly caring about your restaurants and business. We will be revisiting The Henry and giving it one more shot."}
{"text":"Overall, I give the Henry a thumbs up.  It was busy when my family I went for lunch and they did not take reservations but my family and I ended up sitting at a table by the coffee bar and did not have to wait.
  
The coffee at the coffee bar was delicious and a reasonable price, which we ordered while waiting for our food.
  
For an appetizer I suggest to try the Prairie Breeze Cheddar Popover's which come with smoked ham butter & fleur de sel butter; they ended up being exceptional. 

For the entree I ordered the  Mediterranean Chicken salad which was $14
which included cucumber, local tomato,
red onion, kalamata olive,toasted almond & feta cheese.  It was also not a disappointment.

The atmosphere had a young and lively feel with mostly attractive in shape people  dining or ordering coffee.  Our server was not the best but she did her job.  I enjoyed the decor of The Henry; very modern and aesthetic.

I suggest to go to The Henry if you have the money and want to have a good time."}
{"text":"Our waitress was darling and so exuburiant and was very knowledgeable about the menu. What she suggested was her favorite (the bolognese) is now our favorite --talk about amaZing!! The decor is covetable --I want my house to look like this! Everything was amazing!!"}
{"text":"Simply delicious food and superb service. Will return for sure. Food is fresh, seasoned well and presentation is great. Service and servers are first rate."}
{"text":"Nice little Valentine's Date. Ordered form the Valentine's night menu. The food was absolutely delicios. Ridiculously overpriced- there were teenagers doing their homework across the room. But again the steak cooked perfectly, the rice perfectly seasoned. But my favorite thing during the entire night....... The aged whiskey... please treat yourself and enjoy.. !!!"}
{"text":"Okay so Fox Concepts Restaurants are usually uninspiring (quirky dishes, quirkier lighting) at best but damn they are consistent in quality. I've never had a bad dish at one of the spots, and The Henry is no exception. 

ALSO. 

OUR 

SERVER 

WAS

THE

BEST. 

Mickey was not only on the quick draw with the menu knowledge, but she said yes to every annoying request my husband and I asked. She was so accommodating! I love Mickey, Mickey rules. 

Anyway, if you do nothing with your life promise me you'll come here and get the smoked salmon appetizer. Smokes salmon. Creme fraiche. Arugula. Crispy AF potato cake. Bye."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast restaurants to be at in Vegas. I ordered the Egg Benedict, Banana Bread slice and fresh squeezed orange juice. DELICIOUS!! You have to try it!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour!  Food was delicious and the cactus blossom Margarita was quite good!  I really like that the happy hour starts at 3:00, particularly on Friday!!"}
{"text":"Country club meets California cool. Excellent food. Ok service. 

I have dined here twice now and both times it took our server at least 10-15 minutes to actually greet our table. Each time we did have someone else check on us and take our drink order before the actual sever approached our table. I found that a little odd and off putting but at least someone else did check on us after being seated and waiting for a while. Other than this, the rest of the dining experience was great both times. 

The Henry is one of many Fox Restaurant Concepts and the building it sits in seems to house headquarters (upstairs) as well as a coffee shop and seating area (main floor). If you do wander upstairs you'll see a meeting room with office space, along with an outstanding view of Camelback Mountain. You'll also see plaques of all the Fox Restaurant Concepts. I didn't realize how many they own! 

Back to The Henry. Outstanding food. Fresh and cooked to perfection. Really enjoyed the burger and it's nice you get a choice or fries or a substantial side of their kale salad. Nice list of wines, cocktails and mocktails. Love their patio seating, which offers lots of shade and misters during summer months and warming lamps in winter months. 

Do expect a wait for brunch on the weekends and during holidays. 

Definitely a cool place to take out of towners because of the ambience and great food!"}
{"text":"Great food and nice atmosphere.  Busy/popular place but we had reservations and was immediately seated.  Juiciest chicken I've ever had, cauliflower polenta wonderful.  Hubby had beef short ribs, tender and flavorful."}
{"text":"WOW! This restaurant is gorgeous! Since my friend's last name is Henry we sure had fun with the camera in regards to the decor and parking signs. Haha. Inside the place I felt like I was back in long Island in South Hampton on an episode of Revenge. lol- classy beach style. Except the whole front door, cheesy arrow sign that does not really match the theme. What's up with that? Okay, truth be told I love it anyway.  I chuckled at another reviewer that said he thought he was in a POLO catalog. I can see that, maybe, but not really. Anyway long story short the place is very pretty as everyone else has noted. 

The food and service are typical of a Fox restaurant experience. I have never had bad food or service at any Fox restaurant yet. They have a group mentality when it comes to serving so it is always wonderful with everyone helping. Their staff get extensive training on how to serve and it shows. I just do not believe bad reviews for service. I know stuff happens but I have eaten at Fox restaurants many, many times and it is always the same. All staff  members help at all tables. Their training is superb compared to other food places. 

For food we had the Popovers. The verdict is still out for me on the ham flavored butter. I like ham but I am not sure why this product exists. lol The waiter said Vegans like it. I did not dislike it per say I just thought it was weird. I am sure it was a taste thing. I can see the comparison. It tasted like ham but not. To me it had a smoky/gamey flavoring and I do not like that. I had the herb butter as a backup but my friend loved the ham butter. It all worked out okay. We also split a chopped salad, which was good. 

Since it was my birthday I was sent a mailing list coupon for a free desert. I got the bread pudding. it was so amazing!  My friend loved their new peanut butter dessert  bar. The drinks are fun here too. My Passion fruit drink was too tart for my tastes but I went with it and it was still \"Delish.\" My friend got the Berry Lemonade which was great! I need to come back to try other entrees and sandwiches. The burger at the next table looked pretty good. ( insert drool marks) 

On the way out we noticed the patio, which is gorgeous. When it is cooler a patio date is in my future at the Henry. They should also consider hosting special events out there since it is so pretty."}
{"text":"I was pretty pleased with the food here.

The layout is somewhat awkward and I was seated in a little room that feels a little like an offshoot of the actual restaurant, but I like the privacy and the views of the bar and strip.

I started with a wedge salad topped with bleu cheese, bacon and pear. I think the pear is kind of an afterthought and not necessary for the salad. I enjoyed the dressing quite a bit, but had hoped for more bleu cheese crumbles and for the bacon to be slightly more crisp. Then I had the ribeye steak smothered with bleu cheese and a side of mushrooms. This was prepared perfectly and I was very happy with the flavors and textures. A nice piece of meat. Overall, I was pretty happy with my meal. 

I liken this restaurant more to an upscale cafe than a restaurant, even though I know they don't want to be thought of in that way. The prices are slightly higher than a cafe, but the atmosphere and dining hours definitely resemble that of a cafe. So, I guess I'll call it a hybrid.

The food was pretty good, but the prices were a little higher than I would like to pay for a cafe, so I think it deserves 3 stars. Luckily I didn't have to pay.

Not sure I'll be going out of my way to come back, but if you're in the area and looking for some grub after hours, then go for it. There are so many other better food options here, I'd make this a last resort."}
{"text":"Let's talk about my experience at the Henry FYI I was a prior employee the food is old !! And re used if a fry drops on the floor they will still put it on your plate disgusting\" !! They NEVER MAKE FRESH COFFEE !! This place may look cute with the cup mugs and everything but it's not worth it !!! The server \"Thomas \" is an ASS !!  Very unprofessional he will raise pricing to make you pay more I have seen it !!! Never let him serve you ! 

Now the managers ' Michael is a disgrace to ALL WOMAN his comments are inappropriate!! And would rather a woman move a table then a man that's standing right next to him !! 
\"Eli \" - Elizabeth is alwayssssss all over the place always running late into work like she ran 3 miles to get into work 
This place is messy and food is not worth it TRUST ME !"}
{"text":"Love coming to this place after a late night out. The food is delicious, but the chicken wings and tater tots are amazing. Definitely stop by after a night of partying. Customer service can be slow at times, but it's worth it and the best you can get at 5 am."}
{"text":"Memorial Day was my second try with this place. First time was great, Memorial Day was awful, they lost my business. 

We ordered food from the cafe area, we asked about mimosas and were told to order at the bar. After grabbing our order number we hung out at the bar waiting for the bartender to knowledge us. She looked a few times at us, was actively busy and moving around but didn't ask us if we needed something. Of course we were standing there not eating and just looking at the bar so it was obvious we needed assistance. She finally asked after a few minutes what we needed, and we said two mimosas and she rudely said we don't open till 11 but said ah ok and rudely shuffled to get the mimosa. The drinks were good but just a hassle to get. We know they open at 11am for lunch but when we were told it was okay to order mimosa at the bar then why do we get rude service for it? 

Once our food came out no one asked how we were doing or if we needed anything. Plenty of servers but no one acknowledging the customers. My Sausage egg scramble I ordered was watery and I was not impressed at all. I was disgusted with how it looked but by that time I was over this place and the experience that I didn't feel like standing in the long cafe line to complain. I wont be back again and since then 4 people have asked if I have tried The Henry, I gave them my honest review of it. They wont be going their either."}
{"text":"$41.00 for steak, eggs, toast, and house/Rave music in the background.  I'm hungry as hell and need meat/grub. It's 3 am, if u can handle this scene, then go on playa. The steak and eggs is nothing to write home about. It's blah, plain, and needs a kick of salt.  This place gets a 2 out of 5 \"Tadows\"!"}
{"text":"Another Sam Fox restaurant? I am there! 

Went there for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and walked in and was seated right away. Great weather to eat outside. The service was excellent and the patio was spacious and perfect. 

Had the Diner Burger with a scrambled egg and 2 egg breakfast. The burger was excellent and prepared as requested. The 2 egg was was good and came with seasoned potatoes which were very well.

Have been wanting to try out this restaurant and will come back for dinner soon.

Thank you again Sam Fox!"}
{"text":"Wanted a no-hassle dinner at the Cosmo and found this place.  Was nice to get out of the craziness of the lobbies and casino floor and just sit at the bar and catch the World Cup highlights. 

Drinks were the typical high prices you find on the strip so I stuck with water (so can't comment on the fancy cocktails, but FYI no draft beers)

Ordered the pork potato skins and the kale caesar salad.  Both were good but the skins were particularly tasty.

Recommend if you want a low-key dinner while staying at or around the Cosmo on the strip."}
{"text":"Visited the Henry doing my vacation in Vegas , love the staff and the food is super delicious.. I recommend this place for breakfast"}
{"text":"Excellent service in a convenient spot with good food. We were seated quickly on Sunday morning and had the best waiter. The short rib tots were excellent, very flavorful and crispy. I had the CA omelet and it was very tasty. The other people in my party seemed to enjoy their meals as well. Our server even offered to go glasses/drinks which I thought was a really classy move. Most of the time, these hotel spots can be expensive and dicey and I thought this was neither. Would absolutely come back!"}
{"text":"I met a friend and business associate for lunch at The Henry today (Tuesday) at 11:30 AM.  Remember that I said \"11:30 AM on a Tuesday.\"  On arrival, I found parking at the restaurant to be nearly impossible; drivers were hovering in the parking lot waiting for someone to leave so as to secure a space.  I had to park off-site in order to make it to the appointment on time.  I was later told that the corporate folks from Fox Restaurants were conducting a meeting upstairs, and had impacted available parking.  If true, it is an interesting reflection on their customer service perspective.

Once inside, however, we found the service to be prompt and courteous.  Our server, Meagan, was great.  The food appeared quickly and was quite good.  My only reason for not granting 5 stars to this restaurant is the parking difficulty, and the degree to which the problem might well have been caused by the restaurant's own management."}
{"text":"Stopped in to get some breakfast went over to the coffee bar and was greeted and was helped immediately great no problem. I ordered a tea and the 2 egg breakfast found a seat at the bar that's when it went downhill. The two gals behind the bar seemed not to busy and helped the the two sitting next to me but not once asked me or even acknowledge that I was even there. I finally asked for a glass of water and the gal said yes then walked away to slice lemons and never came back the other gal finally brought me a water. As I sat there eating my breakfast which was good i never got another visit by either and while the rest of the bar was being serviced, waters refilled they just skipped over me and I'm guessing because I ordered at the coffee bar and not from them. I've been coming here for quite sometime and this by far was the worst service I've received I probably will never be back."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Food is delicious!
Great happy hour. Love the appetizers...kale and garlic dip is tasty. 
Service is ok but I didn't mind too much. 
I am a frequent guest."}
{"text":"This place lives up to the hype in a lot of ways -has a great vibe- even in the summer - and feels like a living room. I'd recommend any of the salads and a glass of wine in the middle of the day...because....a 75 hour work week, that's why."}
{"text":"I come here for brunch/lunch every year I come to Vegas for a conference in the Cosmo. This time though, it seemed different. The food choices seemed less refined then I remembered. I got a salad because I didn't see much else I would want to eat and my friend got a sandwich. The food did the job but I was not left with that good feeling afterwards like I used to. It might have been that our waiter was horrible. He interrupted us several times during the course of our meal and when it came time to pay...he was nowhere to be found. We waited as long as we could until we finally walked up to the greeter and asked to pay her so we would not be late for meeting. I would not recommend eating here for lunch, but breakfast was much better from what I remember."}
{"text":"I have been here a handful of times and enjoyed breakfast, happy hour as well as dinner.  I've chosen to sit at the bar each visit and the service has been top notch each time.  Tanner was our server/bartender on my last visit and was super friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and helpful in choosing our entrees.  Among the things I've ordered the Thai Peanut Black Cod is my favorite so far.  Perfectly cooked, tender cod with a little heat served in a bright and delicious broth.  The wood grilled artichoke hearts are delicious.  My only critique would be the portion size is lacking for the price. The Flower Child Scramble and their delicious coffee is the perfect breakfast.  The restaurant is beautiful, business is hopping and the fact that they have ample parking is a plus."}
{"text":"This dining experience was extremely pleasant. I came tonight with my fiancé and we had a reservation for 5:30pm. We were seated by 5:10pm which was nice! 
We were met with a smile from our waitress Estefy who was extremely nice from start to finish. She was one of the contributors who made our night so enjoyable. She was pleasant to talk too, very patient & checked on us enough to allow us to enjoy our meal without being overbearing. For starters my fiancé had a michelob ultra & I ordered a black iced tea. We then ordered the roasted chicken tortilla soup as well as the white truffle parmesan fries for our appetizer's. My fiancé loved his soup & said it was just enough with lots of flavor. For our entrees we chose the Roasted Pork Loin as well as the All American Burger (well done) with a side of fries. The burger was very juicy & savory. I was surprised that the bun was nice & soft, it was delicious to say the least! The pork loin my fiancé ordered sat on a bed of spinach & vegetables, which didn't last long since he said it was so good! For desert we enjoyed the chocolate peanut butter molten cake & it did not disappoint. This desert came with a scoop of banana gelato that was to die for!! You have to try it because you will be a fan. 
Overall our experience was wonderful to say the least. Thanks to Brad B, Estefy & all The Henry staff for making it such an enjoyable dinner from start to finish!! We greatly appreciate all the hard work to make your customers happy & full!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has to have the best French toast in the US. IT IS AMAZING! The restaurant is super clean and very inviting. I so wanted to pack all the silverware and the cutest cup and saucer and take them home.  Even the napkins were cute not your plain old solid color.  The ketchup and Tabasco is served in the cutest dish. The potatoes are yummy. I love that they have soy and almond milk options.  Our server Chelsea was so sweet and very attentive."}
{"text":"Came here for a casual business dinner after hearing rave reviews. The immediate feel of the restaurant is trendy, casual, hip. Feels very open and relaxed. 

Drinks were delicious. Hubby had the fig and pomegranate(?) mule. It was amazing. Wish I had one for myself too. Others at the table enjoyed delicious cocktails as well. No complaints. 

At first glance the menu is not overly impressive but at the recommendation of my server I tried the braised short ribs and my husband had the Mediterranean Branzino (Seabass). My oh my was it good! The short ribs had a delicious brandy caramel sauce that was just the right touch for such a dish. The flavors were delicious. I was surprised that my husband had ordered fish since he's a red meat lover but his fish was cooked perfectly and full of delicious flavors. Both dinners were a hit. 

Since we don't live close, we probably won't be back that often. However, you can bet we'll stop by when we're in the area and recommend to plenty of people."}
