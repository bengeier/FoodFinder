{"text":"I dropped into this wine bar for.... surprise.... a glass of wine. I had checked out their menu online earlier but opted not to order anything solid. Though they do have a couple of small veganish options.

Eight has a modern decor, good atmosphere, and while I was there, a live DJ. There were television screens in the wall playing oh so hipply distorted Alfred Hitchcock movies.

When I walked in it was mostly empty, the bartender was friendly, and the service reached that delicate balance of attentive but unobtrusive. 

I ordered a terrible wine, the name of which I have forgotten, but that's not their fault. I picked something local and cheap. They have a great wine list, available by the glass or by the bottle, so you're bound to find something to enjoy.

The server was kind enough to keep offering to fill up my glass of water at least 5 times after I finished that 1 glass of (terrible) wine. They weren't exactly busy, but there wasn't a moment I felt rushed out of there and it was appreciated."}
{"text":"We dropped in for our friend's birthday dinner. There was a happy hour special for wine $1/oz, which we took up happily.

I ordered a fettucine dish with roasted vegetables, which was quite average. My friends ordered the figs/procuitto, which was supposedly delicious."}
{"text":"A great wine bar right in the heart of the city.  It's not at all stuffy with your cliche tome of a wine list.  Rather.. it has a great selection at reasonable prices without being overwhelming. 

The food is also very tasty  (I think I've worked my way through the entire tapas/apps menu without complaint)

Would recommend Fridays.... 1$/ounce.  Great/inexpensive way to explore some unique bottle that you might otherwise never get the chance to try."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I ate here for summer licious.  It was horrible.  The food was just ok, the drinks were good, but the staff is so horrible it is not worth going to.  We had to constantly remind the staff for water and cutlery.  By the time the cutlery arrives our food was already cold and it wasn't that great to begin with.  It seemed the only staff that were getting service were regulars and other employees who were in on their time off to have a meal.  Don't bother going here, even if you're staying at the Cosmo."}
{"text":"I won a dinner for two at Eight Wine Bar off of Twitter. There were not many details about what the dinner would include, and I was pleasantly surprised when I go there. The place is beautiful and well located. We were offered a three course meal and glass of wine, all at no charge. The service was amazing, nothing was lacking considering we were not paying. I had the chicken supreme as my entree and it was some of the best chicken I have eaten at a restaurant. I would definitely recommend this restaurant and hope to return."}
{"text":"Every Friday they do 20 wines by the glass. $3 for a 3 ounce pour. The wine was good, service excellent, ambiance is hip and happening. Food was pretty good. All in all the experience was excellent and I would easily go back. With the wine for two we ended up around $135."}
{"text":"We entered through the wine bar a little confused as to if we were in the right place. Sure enough, the hostess leads us to the separate room in the back where there is more  intimate dining. We used the $49 voucher for 2 - each includes 1 appetizer, main course and dessert which does not disappoint. The Foie Gras and Earth & Ocean appetizer could have been mains by itself. We had the pork loin and sirloin for the main course. Cheesecake and ginger tart to finish. Great for celebrating something special....and oh, they serve wines too!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went with another couple using Teambuy vouchers for 3-course meals.  I highly recommend this restaurant for those in the restaurant and hospitality industries as a case study in what not to do.

Service (1/5):
1. It was 6:00PM on a Friday evening and there was another couple already there, with three more couples gradually trickling in throughout the night.  It was dead.  The service was slower than their business and we didn't finish until 9:15PM.
2. The main waitress serving our table acted like we were at a funeral home.  I think it was her sense of humour that had passed away.  Yes, she was also dressed all in black.
3. At times I suspected they had run out of water because we had to ask the two waitresses repeatedly for it.
4. For the main course, the waitress served the food and we only had my girlfriend's knife to eat with between the four of us.  We had to ask for flatware.  The waitress gave my girlfriend a second knife.  Again for dessert, nothing to eat with (not even a leftover knife).
5. The restaurant attached a $18 tip on a $49 bill.  I asked what this was about and the waitress said that's the tip on the $100 \"value\" of the Teambuy voucher.  Wait, Teambuy and Eight only said that taxes and tip were not included when they sold these vouchers.  Also, no mention of a mandatory tip even for parties of say 8+ on the menu.  She then said it was on the contract their business signed with Teambuy.  I ask for the manager and the manager insists I had agreed to it and it was on the voucher.  He brings the voucher back and changes his tune.  It's not on there but they charge all guests a mandatory 18% tip.  Right... 

Food (2/5):
Appetizers
Ocean & Earth Duo: the two shrimps were large and not overdone although the flavour could have been better.  I'm not sure what the duck confit was.  It looked like pulled pork but was crunchy and chewy.  Was it burnt?  The funeral home waitress says it's supposed to be like that.
Malpeque Oysters: these easily take the record for the smallest I have ever seen.  Four of them for $14, each the size of larger-sized clams.

Mains
Beef sirloin on white truffle oil mashed: the beef was cut badly, at times exceptionally chewy to the point it couldn't be eaten.  Mediocre flavour, although it was cooked a medium rare as requested.  I enjoyed the mashed, probably because butter was oozing out of it but the salt could have been halved and I didn't taste the truffle oil.  I don't want to know how much cream was in there but was I ever glad I had a vegetarian lunch.
Grilled salmon with goat cheese: the goat cheese on top was a great complement to the salmon.  Unfortunately, the salmon was overdone.

Dessert
White chocolate cheesecake: I'm convinced the person that made this doubled the amount of sugar in the recipe
Chocolate ginger tart: this wasn't bad although it could have used more ginger

The food probably deserved a 1.5 but the presentation was a 4 so at least my eyes ate well.

Overall Experience (1/5):
This restaurant tries very hard to be a higher end restaurant with the decor and pricing, but that's about all they succeed in.  Between the terrible service and the mediocre food, I can't remember any dining experience that was worse than this one."}
{"text":"Team Buy/Groupon whatever. 

Horrible...let me count thy ways:
1. They presumptuously charged an automatic 18% on VERY poor service

2. we sat with dirty empty plates - all three courses - for 10 minutes each and the place was deadsville

3. a wine bar with only 13 red wines, not even regionalized 

4. place settings for a table for 2 were inconsistent (how hard s it to match up the same knives? Really?

5. had to ask for more water

6. all Elton John, all the time

7. Manager was a dick when we asked about the 18%. Implied business was so good, he didn't care if we were happy customers

Don't waste your time, money or patience. For $50 a plate, I expected a lot better. Seriously.

It's nothing more than a typical hotel resto. Actually, it's not even THAT good."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for dinner last night to try out Eight Wine Bar's Winterlicious menu.  My first impression was unfortunately not positive, as we stood at the entrance of the restaurant for 10 minutes without being greeted. There were three people working behind the bar which is located directly beside the entrance. No one said anything to us in spite of my clearly audible remarks regarding our desire to be seated in the foreseeable future. Eventually, the host returned to his post and took us back to our table.

The restaurant's decor is very vibrant and modern, but it lacked the class that I was anticipating. There were red wine stains on our table cloth and our table itself was very wobbly (which they remedied with coasters upon our request...not too sure how no one noticed it was off balance while they were setting it earlier). I would have expected greater attention to details like these given the prices at this establishment. We found the prices on the wine menu to be insanely overinflated and opted to ask for a cocktail menu instead. We quickly changed our minds when our waiter informed us that their cocktails were $15 each. That's just plain ridiculous. Much to my dismay, we ended up sharing a decanter of Yellow Tail Shiraz as it was the only reasonably priced alcoholic beverage they offered (and even then I felt cheated paying $16 for 10 oz of Yellow Tail...).

I had the Chardonnay Steamed P.E.I. Mussels for my appetizer and they were cooked perfectly. The bread that accompanies this dish is also nice and thick - wonderful for sopping up the broth. My only complaint is that the pieces of bread weren't bigger. You're only given two little triangles, so you're left with a lot of delightful mussel broth and no remaining sopping device in sight!

For my main course I had the Wild Mushroom Butternut Squash & Ricotta Crepes. I found this dish to be entirely too heavy and my mushrooms tasted charred (which was such a shame, because I adore wild mushrooms). The truffle cream they adorn the crepe with is really overkill. I also found the presentation to be sloppy and unappealing. My friend, on the other hand, thoroughly enjoyed her Citrus Roasted Atlantic Salmon Fillet. So, if you're coming here for Winterlicious, I'd suggest you order that instead.

For dessert we both had the Fresh Fruit and Berries with Yogurt Mint Dip. This came as a huge relief after the overly rich crepe I had, but let's be honest here - I can't really rate this dessert since it was just fruit and yogurt. As long as the fruit is fresh (which it was), it's tough to mess that up.

I'm still going to give Eight Wine Bar 3 stars instead of 2 (as I was initially compelled to do) based on the fact that my dining companion really enjoyed her entree. I strongly believe that they should take that atrocious crepe dish off the menu (especially their Winterlicious menu which should be attempting to showcase what they're capable of)."}
{"text":"Went here for a Summerlicious lunch. I love Summerlicious. This place was pretty nice inside and tasty. Service was friendly. Eight Wine Bar is worth a try."}
{"text":"I'm not sure I'm happy writing this review. I'm worried the word will get out, and this amazing deal will disappear!

I came here on a recommendation from my brother, who basically texted me \"$1 ounces of wine\" and I was there. So apparently how it works is they open about 20 types of wine, and you can choose to buy 3, 5, or 8oz glasses. They price it at $1 an ounce, so basically you can try a ton of types of wine for super cheap! The deal is only on Fridays from 6-8ish. 

Basically this was an amazing place to start a Friday night. The staff are friendly, the prices are cheap, and the ambiance is great! My only complaint would be that the washrooms are kind of a hike away, and after all that wine, it would be better to have them close by.

I can see this place becoming my regular Friday spot!"}
{"text":"It's sad but every licious (summerlicious, winterlicious) I would create and excel spreadsheet with price vs online ratings to determine how to get the biggest bank for my buck! Yes, frugality is in my blood. This year is no exception. Upon careful consideration, I had decided to drag my friend to Eight Wine Bar (EWB) at Cosmopolitan Hotel for lunch. For an affordable $15 you can enjoy a decent lunch completed with dessert!

Appetizer: 
Chardonnay Steamed P.E.I. Mussels with Roasted Garlic and Flat Leaf Parsley (3/5)
The taste of the chardonnay is not very strong to me! Mussel doesn't have a frozen taste like some restaurants in Toronto. There were two mussels with a bit of sand in them. The mussels might need to be soaked a little longer. All in all, it is not a bad dish. 

Entree: 
Hand Spun Fettuccine-Vegetarian with Truffled Cream, Wild Mushrooms, Parmesan Reggiano(3.5/5)
Someone was enslaved in the EWB kitchen to hand spun every plate of pasta. Whoever spun that deserves a kudos! The first bite was great! The pasta was al dente! It still had that resistance to the bite, but cooked thoroughly! However, as I dug deeper into the dish, it got slightly salty. The cream was on the heavier side and the truffle taste wasn't very strong. Nonetheless, it was a decent plate for Fettuccine!

Dessert: 
Maple Crème Brûlée with Biscotti (3/5)
I wish the crème brûlée was warm and not cold. The temperature of the crème brûlée definitely did a number on the creaminess of the texture. The custard just wasn't smooth enough for me. It was still palatable. 

My friend had the Chardonnay Steamed P.E.I. Mussels with Roasted Garlic and flat Leaf Parsley as the appetizer, Citrus Roasted Atlantic Salmon Fillet with Honey Glazed Root Vegetable Ragout and Blueberry Pinot Reduction as the entree, and Belgian Sugar Waffle with Macerated Berries and Vanilla Whipped Cream as the dessert. I took a bite of her salmon, the skin was so crispy, the salmon was still moist! Nom nom nom! The dish was so purrdy! The purple from the blueberry reduction is balanced by the green from the herb oil. I actually preferred her salmon over my pasta. The waffle was unfortunately cold and was not fluffy...although it was still better than Wanda's Waffle and I think that says a lot!

Overall, EWB deserves a 3.75/5. I don't know how I came up with the math. Somehow, the overall experience was good! It could be the good company, could be the value, could be the taste of my friend's dish, could be the distraction from the beautiful waitresses, could also be my lack of math skills but somehow they earned a place my heart!"}
