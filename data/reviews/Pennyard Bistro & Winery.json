{"text":"The atmosphere is warm and inviting. This is the perfect place to relax and reflect on your day. Friendly service that gives you a sense of belonging. What more could you want?   The music is excellent! Sit and enjoy it or get up and move to it! Either way...the music delivers.   Great place to go for a night out with friends/co-workers or the perfect spot for an intimate evening with someone special.   SEE YOU THERE :)"}
{"text":"(Sad to announce as of Feb 2010 - this business has also succombed to the bad economy and closed its doors)  :(  My husband and I were delighted to find a place with good wine and live jazz so close to home!  The owner is a sweet lady and a pleasure to meet.  Great place for \"date night\"!

{"text":"This place is great! The food is good and they have a very large wine selection.  The owner and her husband are very nice people and remembered our names when we came back.   They have Jazz on the weekends and no cover charge, there is a $6 drink minium but there are many $6 wines to choose from.  I have certainly found a nice place to just chill.  I will be Back !"}
