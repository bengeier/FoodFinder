{"text":"The Turkey chops are Awesome. I patiently wait for them to pop up on Uber eats. Now if I could only catch the chicken spaghetti or the shrimp and crab salad lol(It's always sold out)                                                                   



A definite must try."}

{"text":"OMG my wife and I stopped here today for dinner! 

I had the rice and vegetable dinner and had them add broccoli and grilled shrimp. Man the rice was fresh, well seasoned and had great flavor. The vegetables mushrooms and onions were grilled to perfection. The broccoli was steamed to perfection and the grilled shrimp took the whole dinner to another level! I will return again and I highly recommend Talessia's Kitchen to anyone wanting a great meal!

My wife had the Loaded Steak potato and commented on how fresh the potato was, how good and well seasoned the whole combination of all ingredients were. She will also be back again and highly recommends them to all.  Kudos to the two ladies at the front counter today @ 3:30-4pm Saturday they represented the business well with their service and attention to detail on food preparation and food presentation, just looking at the food mad you hungrier once you opened the carton LOL.
  
If your looking for a Black owned business that takes care of business your search can end here."}
