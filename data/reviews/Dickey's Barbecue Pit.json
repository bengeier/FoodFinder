{"text":"Went in to the store for the 1st time last night. Ordered the two board specials, 1/2 slab & two sides and pulled pork sammy with one side. First thing I noticed were the extremely dirty heat lamps over the meat station. Not good. Ordered beans and mac and cheese for the sides. Sorry, but we are out of both, almost closing time. The person in charge handled things as well as he could, he comped the entire meal. That being said, the meats were just ok. Bottom line, better choices out there. I wont be back."}
{"text":"Fab. The staff was so friendly. Restaurant was clean and cute. They suggested their street tacos with shredded pork rib meat and slaw. They were so very good. Mostly we were impressed with how kind and friendly they were. We will be back!"}
{"text":"The BBQ was ok.  It is cooked without any sauce.  I think it would have tasted a bit better if it was cooked with one of their popular sauces.  I tried both sauces that they had in the crock pots and they were very good and added a lot to the meet.  I really enjoyed the hot and spicy sauce.   I had the pulled pork and Texas brisket.  They were good, but definitely not the best I ever had, but then I am now used to NC BBQ.  If you are on the strip and want to get some decent priced BBQ, go to Dickeys.  I will go back."}
{"text":"GREAT BBQ!!!  Great smoke!!  Portions are fair for the price.  Visited many times.  Will continue to be a regular customer.  The review of their take out was shortly after they opened..  Give them a chance.  They have continued to improve as their staff has become more experienced.  Have been to numerous BBQ restaurants in the valley.. This Dickeys is right there with the best!!  Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Update they wanted my email so someone from store could contact me?  Are you kidding me you guys are the absolute worst business in the area.  Terrible customer service and I felt abused by the employees.  Why they have such a high yelp score is beyond me.  They should not be allowed to operate the way they do.  Zero stars is way too much."}
{"text":"Been a Dickey's BBQ fan from way back! Loving my home state of Texas and Fort Worth was my first experience at Dickey's I moved to Prescott, Az. 11 yrs ago. I do a lot of business in Mesa and when I discovered they had a Dickey's BBQ joint I was thrilled came here many times and enjoyed it the food was great! But oh how things have changed! Every thing is individually sold no more two meat, 3 meat plates with sides! And okay I can accept that. I got 3 meats, double sliced brisket and sausage, macaroni and cheese, potatoe salad! The brisket was so dry it could not be sliced just fell apart,  the mac and cheese was watery and taste less! Good thing they had plenty of bbq sauce, raw onions and pickles to bring the taste together! The sausage and potatoe salad and rolls were great! But what's a bbq joint without moist sliced brisket! I may not come back! P.s. they took the fried okra off the menu!!!"}
{"text":"tried the brisket, no smoke flavor and no smoke ring.  same goes for the pork ribs ,no smoke flavor. the sauces are good , i reallt liked the spicey sauce.  side are ok but nothing special. i will go back and try other items.  i've worked in bbq and the items i tried would embarass texes."}
{"text":"I'm eaten at Dickies countless times, however I'm compelled to write this review based on trying a new location.  Warning, the menu has completely changed, portion sizes are smaller, and prices have gone up.  And the worst thing is that they no longer have French fries or any fried food for that matter and the ice cream machine is GONE!!  Also, the beef brisket sandwich is now completely plain, no onions or pickles.  I just feel like I was ripped off compared to the old menu, prices, and amenities.  I don't plan on ever going back ..."}
{"text":"Wow this places is amazing. The turkey is very moist as well as the brisket and chicken. I took my whole family here and let me tell you something Ive eaten alot of bbq being from Texas and this has the authentic bbq vibe. I highly recommend this places to anyone that wants good bbq you wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was very hungry during my lunch break and this was nearby so I wondered inside. I found myself ordering the a chicken sandwich. I asked the young lady how was chicken on the sandwich cut, she explained that it was chopped. When I was given my sandwich chopped was not the word. The chicken breast was chopped into big huge pieces which kept falling out of the sandwich. I believe it would have tasted better if they would chopped the mean up into bite size pieces if not shredded or a maybe even a chicken breast patty would have been better option. The sandwich ended up satisfying me for lunch. I would like to go back and try other menu items."}
{"text":"Great food for the price. The pulled pork and ribs were great. We loved the choices of sauces: original with a hint of vinegar. The hot and spicy had just the right kick of heat."}
{"text":"I'm very disappointed in this Dickey's location.  I have been to the one in Scottsdale, and the service and food was always amazing.  This one, however, I am less than impressed with.  I have been on 2 separate occasions, both times ordering different options to go.  The food, as usual was really good.  The preparation was awful.  The first time, the pulled pork sandwiches were wrapped so poorly that the food spilled out into the bag when I had to move one to make room in the bag for extra sauces.  Now, not really a big deal, just a minor annoyance since it wasn't a total loss.  The second time, same issue.  The westerner was packaged very poorly and placed in the bag UPSIDE DOWN!! Seriously now?!  Didn't find that out until we got home and started to unpack the bag of food.  Not only was that an issue, but the westerner ordered - the Racetrack, was not made as it was supposed to be.  It was missing the cabbage slaw.  Again ... seriously?  It wasn't a difficult order, 3 sandwiches and 2 sides, so I can't blame it on forgetfulness due to a large order, and the restaurant wasn't busy (no line behind me).  Come on!  If the food was bad, I wouldn't go back, but I will because it's Dickey's and they have the BEST barbecue.  I just hope the employees get it together and start being smart about packing to-go orders without them becoming a mess."}
{"text":"Looked for a quick bite to eat after playing a round of golf at Pleasant View golf course nearby. This was perfect! Very friendly and helpful staff. My dad and I are from out of town, so we didn't know how it all worked with the \"walk up\" ordering - they helped us out. We both had the brisket sandwich special for the day that included 2 sides, a souvenir cup and free ice cream cone after all is said and done too! And it was for $10.99 (if I recall correctly).  If we lived closer, I'd go back more often! Mac n cheese was very cheesy and delicious. Baked BBQ beans were also tasty."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas but have lived in Arizona for 19 years.  I was eating at Dickey's 30+ years ago in The Lone Star State.  This BBQ has a great reputation!  I stopped by for an early dinner around 4:30pm tonight.  The place was very, very clean for starters.  I ordered the 2 meat combo and opted for sliced brisket and the jalape√±o cheddar sausage.  I got mac and cheese along with fried okra for the sides.  The BBQ was great!  The sausage had good flavor and the sliced brisket was from the lean end.  I got a little of all three of their BBQ sauces (sweet, spicy, and original).  The mac and cheese was delicious and they cooked the fried okra to order (great call considering there's nothing worse than soggy fried okra because it's been sitting too long).  The dinner comes with a pretty good roll but this is a BBQ place for crying out loud.  Throw 2-3 slices of white bread on the side and call it a day as all great Texas BBQ places do.  The only real beef that I had with the place (no pun intended) was when I opted for ice water instead of a soda/tea and was given about an 8 ounce plastic Dixie cup.  Come on!  Don't be that way.  I didn't order water to be cheap.  I ordered water because I didn't want the additional empty calories.  Lose the small water cups and be the restaurant to give out normal size or even large water cups just because it's the right thing to do (the Dickey's plastic soda cups are probably 48 ounces).  You can't eat at a BBQ place with 8 ounces of water and who wants to keep getting up for refills? (...and don't reply that it's a cost thing - figure it out)  Ok.  Enough of the soap box.  The free soft serve ice cream at the end was a nice touch!  The staff was very friendly.  I will return one day soon and hope to give Dickey's BBQ 5 stars provided they've fixed the water cups.  This franchised Dickey's BBQ location is owned by a Marine veteran and beats the heck out of Joe's BBQ.  Go enjoy Dickey's for lunch or dinner today!"}
{"text":"They warm their sauces & give you free vanilla soft serve!  And the BBQ is top notch!  I've never heard of a Dickeys before this location. And with the small dining area I've been hesitant to tell yelp about them for fear that our fave KEF Sunday location would be over run.   Pros: - very good BBQ; the quality of their smoked on site meats is delicious. I've rarely had any meat there that I've been ho hum about. The pulled pork and beef brisket will easily overshadow any other meat on your plate--be warned.  - variety; they offer 8 different meat options and at least as many sides. The waffle fries are ok, I love the onion straws and baked potato casserole.  - sustainability; the big yellow cups last a long time after your visit. Open up our cabinet and you'll see them in regular rotation. They use recyclable to go containers.  - free vanilla soft serve ice cream cones - they warm their sauces. This is no small matter. The compounds found in all sauces are muffled by colder temperatures. So a bottle on the table or a packet kept in the fridge (like at most other BBQ joints) will not taste as good as something kept at a temperature closer to your tongue temp.  - sauce options and flavor; spicy is my fave, but they also offer original, sweet and a vinegar based carolina - nice theming and it smells wonderful before you even get in there - kids eat free on Sunday. They have a good deal on this and it's our favorite night to visit. 12 yo and under get one kids meal and drink for each paying adult of equal or greater.  - casual place and atmosphere  Cons: - value; the portions are a bit lacking compared to the price - the dining room is cramped; just tonight two families were connecting in a friendly fashion, one leaving and one just arriving. Great huh?  Not for those of us trying to get drinks and sauces and utensils, etc. not their fault really. Move to a different location after your lease. Seriously. Maybe pineville or south clt.  - ordering; there's this high clear guard separating you during ordering from the food that's being prepped just on the other side. I appreciate the sanitary purpose, but it means you often have to yell your order to folks again due to the often cramped crowded nature of the facility.  - customer service; I'm not sure what kind of compensation these folks are getting but I rarely see the same people twice and those that are there sometimes put customer service niceties as a secondary or tertiary concern. They often have only two or three folks working and those same people have to prep food, take order, handle the point of sale, get wood for the smoker, maintain the store, etc. They often seemed stretched thin. And they're working in a cramped prep area. I probably would find it hard to crack a smile if I worked there.  Most often I get acceptable service--rarely on the chick fil a or public level.   Overall: The food is very good. That and their KEF on Sundays will keep us coming back.  We go there as often as our budget and my waistline will allow.  It's a bit cramped and their customer service can use some polish. You can make a great root beer float with the softserve!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the relaxed atmosphere, but it is BBQ John that keeps me coming back again and again with witty humor and the best cut of meat I could ask for! Try the Spicy Cheddar Sausage - best flavor in town."}
{"text":"The smoke scent really clings to your clothes and hair all day... but it's worth it! I love their brisket with coleslaw and mac and cheese. And free soft serve? Yes, please! Very decently priced and portioned."}
{"text":"Pretty good, not great.  Flavorful food and sauce but not the best BBQ I've ever had.  The meats and sauces are delicious while the sides are a bit lacking.  I don't think anyone can beat Big Ern's for BBQ Beans....  Its good for lunch as they are quick and have sandwich and specials alike.  I work in the area so I will definitely stop back again... overall I'd say 3.75 stars out of 5."}
{"text":"Just got takeout from here for dinner and it was delicious! We ordered pulled pork and brisket, both were great. The sides were good as well, especially the coleslaw! The only con I can think of is that the portion size of the meat was a little on the smaller side.  All in all, great food, we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I went in to this Dickey location last week and ordered the quarter plate, got home there was only one rib along with my two sides which were not to great, but I could fix those up, so I immediately called and got a manager , she said her name was Rebecca, so I explained the 1 rib and she told me that is what you get with the quarter plate, I told her I was just there 2 weeks prior and ordered the same thing and got 3 ribs, she said well they the cooks must have been a good mood, anyway so after going back and forth she asked when I could come back and she would fix the problem, I told her Saturday , so she said she would be there in the afternoon, so I went back and low and behold she called in late or something, so I don't know if she called out or was in the back of the restaurant, so I wont  be back, to be fair the first time I went 3 weeks ago the food was very good, this time not so much"}
{"text":"I guess I don't know why the only two reviews of this new restaurant are not very  good!  We went to Dickey's today (Saturday) to give it a try, after hearing rave reviews from co-workers,  and we also thought that it was great! It was very busy and the line, surprisingly, moved rather quickly. First of all, the staff were very friendly and helpful. After asking many questions about the menu and how to order (slightly confusing), I decided on the two meat plate with the sliced brisket and the pulled pork.  The two meat plate comes with two sides and a roll.  For my sides, I got the coleslaw and the jalapeno beans.  The brisket was VERY moist and had a nice smoke ring and smoke flavor.  The pulled pork was also very moist and had a nice smokey flavor. I got a side of the spicy and original barbecue sauce, but didn't even need it because the meat was so moist! The coleslaw that I got was not runny at all, as Jerry D. pointed out in his review. It was like a nice combination of creamy, mayonnaise based coleslaw and vinegar based coleslaw.  I found it to be crunchy and tangy.  It was delicious mixed in with my pulled pork. The jalapeno beans were not that spicy, a little salty, and had good flavor. The roll was warm, buttery, and fluffy. The portions were very large-I have left overs for lunch on Monday! My friend got the BBQ chicken on a big barbecue sandwich with mac n cheese.  She was very pleased with her meal, as well. She said that the roll was very good and the chicken had great flavor.  She used the original barbecue sauce with hers. I had a taste of her mac n cheese and it was very cheesy and the noodles were perfectly cooked. The decor was fine-nothing too exciting and it was very clean.  I give it a \"4 stars\" review because the workers were very helpful and courteous, the restaurant was clean, and our food was very tasty and the meat was smokey and moist.  I didn't want to give it a \"5 stars,\" because we hadn't tried everything to know how it is and the ordering is a little confusing.  We will be back! Next time we will try the free ice cream."}
{"text":"Incredibly disappointed! We were looking forward to this since we eat at Dickies in SC next to my in-law's and it is delicious. Unfortunately, our first experience at this one was a total bust. Upon calling in our order at 5:30 pm on a Saturday, I was informed they were out of brisket. I was going to order the brisket and sausage sandwich (westerner). Not a deal breaker, they said they could do pulled pork on it instead. Sounded good. We also ordered two pulled pork sandwiches. When my husband gets there, he looks in the bag and doesn't see the coleslaw. He asked and was told by two people that it was in there. Surprise surprise, he gets home and no slaw. To make matters worse, no sausage on my sandwich. Apparently they had run out of that as well and decided not to tell us. What we did have, the pulled pork, was dry. They were not interested in \"making it right\" on any level. One and done. Bummer!"}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this hut wasn't impressed. Firstly they were out of ribs by 7p on a Tuesday.  Got the brisket, jalapeno sausage, green beans, and mac n cheese. The brisket wad blan with very little smoke and a little dry. The sausage was really good. The green beans were decent but the mac and cheese wasn't any better than what you could get from a box at the store. Free ice cream was a nice treat though. The boy got the same asi  did along with chicken, which was a little dry. Was good but not great. Maybe next time?"}
{"text":"Yummmm, love the pork ribs, go on Tuesdays when on special since otherwise BBQ requires a second mortgage no matter where"}
{"text":"Two Stars is generous but maybe the quality of the food was bad due to startup jitters. After second thought I lowered this to 1 because you would expect a strong start for a new restaurant.   Food: the kids chicken tenders are not good, ribs were inferior to many other places, and BBQ beans were not good. Sauces are nothing special. Only thing slightly decent was the green beans with bacon.   Price: way too expensive for what you get. Low quality should equal low price.   Dining room: it will take a few days to get a the smoke out of my lungs. If you go inside prepare for an immediate shower when you leave. Something is not right about ventilation system.   Workers: best part, friendly and helpful. But, they should get their lungs checked."}
{"text":"First time visiting a Dickie's Barbecue.  Not impressed.    I had a pulled pork sandwich which didn't have much flavor.  The spicy barbecue sauce was so tame.  The waffle fries were very good.  We also had the fried okra which was cooked a little too long.  The ice cream was in the cooler way too long because it had way too many ice crystals in the ice cream.  I would never go back here again.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The worst pulled pork I ever ate in my life.  I got it to go and got home and began to eat it.  I found two pieces of hair in it.  It had a weird taste. That night a severe stomach ache.  The next day diarrhea and stomach ache.  Day two same symptoms lying here now sick as hell can't get out of bed.  Will never go there again.  Please, if you don't want to be sick don't eat there."}
{"text":"For fast food or take out the best of it's kind. Obviously not your Uncle Bill's chuck wagon with the family secret sauce, but reviewing it for what it is quick and easy it is amazing . Always my last minute go to for picnics or busy nights. The speciality baked stuffed potatoes are great."}
{"text":"Gave this place another shot, pretty much wasted $14 bucks , mediocre bbq at best, no real flavor, they lost the magic of what they did here a few years ago. Don't waste your money there are better places to spend your hard earned dollar."}
{"text":"Dickey's is a pretty delicious barbecue joint for the price you pay. It's cheap, and there's free ice cream and pickles. The Westerner is a classic barbecue sandwich that's hard to pass up. Not going to lie, the people who work here are sort of sketchy, but they're friendly enough for the price you're paying. I'm definitely going to be back. In terms of quick tips, the pulled pork and beef brisket are delicious. So is the mac and cheese. If you are off the strip, maybe even if you are staying at the Mandalay Bay or other hotels at the South End, don't pass this up."}
{"text":"It's quite obvious the guys working here hate their jobs; I will do you favor and will never return and then maybe you'll close as the other bbq places did in that same store before it became Dickeys. Look for another job other than working in food service/fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"Get a stacker with chopped brisket on top of it instead!! Yummy!! Love the jalape√±o sausage too!! Love that they have military discount and love the free ice cream cones while you dine in!! Friendly, fast service every time!! Love all of he sides too!! My 11year old loves the pulled pork and the turkey!!"}
{"text":"I ordered and paid for a pound of barbeque pork and I just returned home and the container seemed very light.  I weighed the entire container on my scale and it weighed less then 11 ounces!  Unacceptable mistake on the part of the business."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying the food is great and there are no complaints there. However we went in at 5:45pm for dinner and was excited to share my past experiences eating at Dickeys with my family. We were the only ones in there and had to wait 10 min while they did an online order first. We attempted to order Chicken Breast as its about the only thing my kids like from a BBQ joint and they made us aware they only had a little chicken left and were out. They were rude and unapologetic about it and made us feel like it was our fault. Needless to say we will be going to another Dickey's because we love the food."}
{"text":"The food is great. This was our first visit and the food was good. The sides were yummy and the price was great. Looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"I had brisket and hot links with baked potato casserole and friend okra for the sides and I loved every bite! It's difficult to find good bbq in Vegas and those places usually close down. I guess it's just not as popular out here. Being from Texas I'm very picky about bbq but I must say the brisket was tender and juicy and the hot links had a great spicy kick. The okra was fried perfectly and the baked potato casserole had a great flavor. The sweet tea and soft serve ice cream topped it off too. The staff here were all very friendly and made great suggestions too! I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"First timer at Dickey's and will never eat there again.Meat was slightly dry,baked beans had the straight out of the can taste and the Potatoe Salad was everything but Potatoe Salad.The BBQ sauce on the side was completely watery.The server charged me chicken by the pound but there was no scale visual to customers.I'd rather eat BBQ from 7-11 then Dickey's."}
{"text":"Have been back to Dickey's several times since they have been open and the food has been excellent. Yes the dining area is a little small but it is not meant to be a full fledge restaurant in that location. Prices are very good as well. We certainly will keep coming back."}
{"text":"As far as barbecue in Mentor goes, this place is your best bet. Service is better when the manager is there, but overall not too shabby. They have the types of meats you expect to get when craving barbecue and their sides are alright. I'm a fan of a fresh baker (baked potato with your choice of meat and fried onions) and their salad is a good choice too. Hubby usually goes for a meat plate and the baked potato casserole. Pretty sure this is the only place around with fried okra. The best part, however, is the fact that you can leave with a souvenir cup filled with root beer and ice cream!"}
{"text":"The beef brisket is so salty, and had no flavor at all. I didn't have extremely high hopes for barbecue in Parma, but this place has very low quality. Also, the croutons in the Caesar salad were terrible. The fried okra was okay, but that's about it. Save your money and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"If you want quick BBQ then this is the place. The staff is friendly, the brisket is tasty and the sides are delicious. They give you plastic cups for you to take home. The best part is the FREE... Yes I said FREE soft serve vanilla ice cream. Really nice to end the meal!"}
{"text":"Before this place became a chain, it was its own restaurant. I've eaten at the original. I grew up on it. Numerous Sunday dinners were spent here. How happy was I to see a little bit of home land in my backyard!!  When I ate here...everything was dry. As in, it shouldn't have been served as its shelf life expectancy had long passed. Nothing was fresh. NOTHING. It was THE worst cafeteria food I'd ever eaten.  And I paid good money for it.   Sadly this place doesn't live up to the quality and deliciousness of the original. It barely lives up to being called BBQ.  If this place is franchised, they are destroying a good name & brand. If its owned by Dickeys themselves, shame on you for allowing this place to ruin your name, reputation, & BBQ.   What is truly sad? People who have never had true BBQ think this place serves up great food. They don't. They simply do not. (Although, I can see why someone might think its good.)  Fact: meat with sticky, tangy, brown sauce does not make it BBQ. Its a process, an art form, mastered by few, having left numerous delusional...just like Dickeys."}
{"text":"BEST Beef Brisket this side of Texas! You want to take it home by the lb. but you're to full to carry it. It's so good, we'll be back !"}
{"text":"The food was great (love the brisket!) and the guys are very friendly.  We come here often and its consistently good."}
{"text":"My last meal... would be KFC. I love chicken. We were driving through Vegas looking for something we didn't have back home and it was either between this or some burger place. I'm glad we came here because the food was to die for. We got the family platter which had chicken, ribs, and sides such as mac n cheese. At the end of the meal, they had a softserve machine."}
{"text":"Today we walked into dickeys we passed by three workers while we were trying to figure out the ordering process. We stared at the menu about three minutes still no hello, welcome, or anything the three guys were just staring at us. We turned around to order still no hello etc. so I just started ordering my food. We walked around to the side the guy just asked did we want drinks. This was our first time here so we just sat down. The worked nodded so I guess our food was ready. The food was not even on the hot side more room temperature. So we ate no acknowledgement or anything. Not even have a good day while we were leaving. I read over the negative reviews before I went I should have just went elsewhere. I went back in December 2015 so hopefully they have worked on their customer service. Proceed with caution."}
{"text":"Grabbed some carryout. Got the ribs and pulled pork. They were out of Brisket and Ham. Meat was good, not outstanding. The pulled pork was much better when sauce was added.  The ribs were tender with a fair amount of meat on the bone. I also got the potato salad and green beans. I like their green beans cooked with bacon. The potato salad on the other hand is pretty bland with maybe a bit too much dill. Overall, not great BBQ, but not bad BBQ."}
{"text":"Best pulled pork I have EVER eaten. Food was great, super fast and very reasonable for BBQ. Next time I go back I'm getting all pulled pork."}
{"text":"I was driving by and saw this place so I decided to give it a try. I ordered the brisket sandwich. The meat was tender and quite tasty but all 3 of the BBQ sauces that they had were bad. I love good BBQ and to me and my husband, the sauce is a huge part of the meal. I'm sorry to say that we won't be going back anytime soon, even though the price was right."}
{"text":"Dickey's is my favorite barbecue place of all the barbecue restaurants in the Ballantyne or Indian Land areas. They have the best chopped barbecue sandwich. The restaurant is small and the atmosphere doesn't compare to Midwood or most of the others, but go for the food and great sauce."}
{"text":"I stopped in on my lunch break.  The BBQ isn't bad for a fast food type of place.  I had the brisket on this particular visit.  The BBQ sauces weren't the best I've had.  If you are in the area and looking for BBQ, I recommend Pork on a Fork."}
{"text":"First try at Dickey's.  Had high hopes but they were soon dashed...  I ordered the two meat plate with pulled pork and chopped brisket with BBQ beans and cole slaw as sides.  Both meats were less than impressive and really had little to no taste on their own.  Adding some of the sauces available (which were decent) made the meal tolerable.  The sides were also somewhat bland.  All in all not great bbq, go to Old Carolina BBQ or even Bullies BBQ down the street."}
{"text":"Picked up a large to go order. They left out half of our side items. Called to see what they cold do and their response was that \"they could send someone but we live too far\"....really??"}
{"text":"Good casual place--ribs were delicious! Thought the beef brisket was a tad dry, but bbq sauce is good so no problem smothering it. Will return!"}
{"text":"For BBQ, it's decent. It's not the best but it does satiate the BBQ cravings. I ordered the chicken breast and I was delightfully surprised by the juiciness and flavor. The sides, on the other hand, were underwhelming and in need of something extra. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We thought we'd try them this evening since it was new and close by.  So my husband went to get some sandwiches and sides to bring home.  took awhile to get the order taken. then when he came home, my beef and cheddar was cold and there was no sauce on it at all. my husbands sandwich had no sauce as well.  and there was nothing else in the bag other than the sides..   What a terrible first impression.  cold and no sauce from a BBQ place. at least I had some Famous Dave's bbq sauce to put on them.  was going to try something else the next time. but don't feel like going back."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant last night for the first time and the whole family loved it.   Everything we ordered was amazing: Chicken tacos with creamed spinach and cheese, beef brisket and mac and cheese in a taco, beef brisket slider, roasted chicken slider, potato casserole  (which is like loaded mashed potatoes), fancy pulled pork sandwich, and Cole slaw.  My kids are very picky,  but they actually wanted more sliders and mac and cheese last night.  We will definitely be eating here again!"}
{"text":"I ordered the Holiday Meal for this Christmas.  It was a huge deep fried cajun flavored turkey that lasted a week.  It came with a gallon of baked potato casserole, a gallon of green beans, a gallon of stuffing, gravy, and rolls.  It was AWESOME.  What a great deal and so delicious.  Eddie the manager is excellent and made me feel like I was the only person in the room.  Parking is very limited and you have to pay.  In addition, googlemaps shows an empty parking lot when you zoom in.  It's on the first floor of the new apartments built by the ASU sundevil stadium."}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off day.   I had the beef brisket and it dry even with plenty of sauce.  The other order was chicken which was very tender and juicy.  Though the chicken flavor was very delicate, not enough smoky flavor for my taste.  Excellent macaroni and cheese and very nice potatoes.  The beans and green beans were just ok.  The green beans stated bacon and onion and I neither taste those favors nor saw any bacon or onion in the green beans.   The quality of the meats seem very good, it is just that the brisket was far too overcooked and the barbecue beans and green beans not very flavorful.  Oh the brownie and pecan pie desserts were very different and excellent.  May try again for the chicken, not willing to take a chance on anything else.  Meh."}
{"text":"This place is a gem! It was a Saturday afternoon and the boyfriend and I were getting hungry but couldn't decide exactly what we wanted. After stopping at the neighboring Verizon store, I pointed out Dickey's BBQ and we both nodded and headed in. Neither of us had been there before and we were pretty excited.  We ordered the XL Family pack and received the following foods: Pulled Pork, Beef Brisket, and Turkey Breast. Side dishes were: Mashed potato casserole, mac n cheese, green beans with bacon, and wafer fries. We split our breads half and half, buns and corn bread. One container of BBQ sauce. Drink: 1 Gallon sweet tea The meats were perfection. The smokey flavor shown through and made them all taste fantastic. Nothing was too salty or too bland, it was just right. All of them delicious without the BBQ sauce, even better with it. The sides, though slightly small for our family of 5, were all yummy. Most of us loaded our plates with meat so perhaps the sizing of the sides is intentional to enjoy that meaty goodness. The cornbread was amazing, sweet but not too sweet, moist, and just amazing. The sweet tea in a similar fashion was sweet enough to feel like homemade, southern style tea, but not overloaded with sugar to make your teeth hurt.  Overall, could not ask for a better deal. What we ordered for the price was cheap compared to taking your family out anywhere else that would served equally hearty foods. The staff was polite and friendly, made jokes and had us laughing. The food was phenomenal. And yes, they have free ice cream 7 days a week!  I would absolutely recommend them and will definitely be going back for more!"}
{"text":"Wasn't expecting much but I was way off. Well worth checking out. 25$ fed us both with plenty to take home. Ham was ham,but the pulled pork and the ribs were very tasty."}
{"text":"Delicious, huge portions, and priced right!  Nice addition to Madison food options.  Looking forward to seeing how they do as a caterer!"}
{"text":"I am not one to visit chain restaurants, but this one just opened and the Mrs. and I decided to give it a try. We got there on a weekend and it was early about 5:00 p.m.  We were the only customers in the place...given, it had just recenly opened. The brisket was a little fatty andgristly, but had a decent flavor to it.  The waffle fries were ok.  We shared their BBQ ribs...nothing to write home about.  I did enjoy their mashed baked potatoes...could have had more of that dish. They use a lot of paper cups...a cup for the each side, cups for the sauce, cups for drinks, cups for ice cream, cups for pickles, etc....and ketchup packets?..no thanks! My biggest complaint?  Customer service.  There were 5 employees (including the owner) when we were leaving.  Not ONE of them thanked us or said good-by.  We considered it very rude since we were their ONLY customers. Dickey, you must put forth much more effert if you are going keep your doors open.  Sorry."}
{"text":"We eat here often and the service is always very good. I prefer the Big Barbecue sandwich, which is even cheaper if you vine on Mondays. Cole slaw topper is a must. Also try the fired okra and then finish off with free ice cream! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I got the special, which was a smoked brisket sandwich.  I thought it was very flavorful, and I enjoyed it.  The sides I chose were the fries, and caesar salad.  Both of them were satisfying.  My favorite thing is the southern style sweet tea they have, and I recommend the sweet barbecue sauce, it's one of the best I've tasted in quite some time.  The ambiance could be a little better, but it's not bad.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Being from TX & living here now ....this is as close as you get to authentic BBQ! The first time we came here was excellent! Here we are today and they are out of almost everything! Which sucks but, I do understand this is normally not a busy day for them. I will say they have the BEST sweet tea I've found so far in this state (most people look at me like I'm crazy when I ask for it)."}
{"text":"Dickey's is very good and very clean. I got the Big Barbecue with brisket and Mac and cheese. The sandwich was good, the Mac and cheese was comforting.   The service was great, Josh (or was it John?) came and talked to us and was very nice. There were also numerous employees that came to check on the self service station while we were there, and cleaning the tables. It was nice to see the employees care so much about the cleanliness of the restaurant.   The free dessert samples and free ice cream were awesome too. :)"}
{"text":"I'm not going to say that I absolutely know what I'm talking about when it comes to BBQ.  I will simply list my credentials. Born in Utah where a mix of BBQ exists, mostly commercial type fare and some pit type of stuff I then moved to Cincinnati where a whole different breed of BBQ extists.  Tangy sweet sauce, fruity and tart, some boiled meat, some smoked.  I then moved to Florida where Southern BBQ rules, lots of smoke, multitudes of sauce choices in one sitting: Sweet, Hot, Spicy/Sweet, Mustard, smokey, a selection of heaven on one table with lots of smoke and rub to complete things.  On to North Carolina where the sauce is light and vinegar-y, more of a salad dressing than a \"sauce\" but delicious all the same, the pulled pork topped with sauce and some tangy coleslaw.  In Chicago we eat BBQ at Coopers, hearty sauce and crisp from the grill, the ribs there are intense and flavorful, different from the south and from Cincinnati but delicious all the same.  Roadside BBQ pits in FL, GA, TN and TX have been some of my favorites that I can't name.  I like to think that I have some experience in BBQ since it is a food I love like mad.  So we've covered what I know from the past.  This is what I know now: This place sucks.  Tasteless and bland and as my husband mentioned \"weird\", this \"BBQ\" was both overpriced and beyond grisly.  We both had the ribs and the brisket, both were boiled and I'm fairly certain all the flavor was tossed out with the water.  The brisket was so fatty that we didn't eat it.  The ribs were the texture of semi-melted wax chips without much meat on them.  I'm fairly certain they just mashed potatoes and added coloring and some red pepper and called it potato salad, there was no flavor to that either.  We will never go back.  I really hate giving one star to any place, but honestly, this place ranks about 0 stars.  Rank, that about describes it."}
{"text":"Wife and I went to Dickey's for the first time a year ago and the food and service was GREAT, went again today 3/31/16 pork ribs were not good at all,  it's time to take a break from Dickey's"}
{"text":"I would not consider Dickeys a BBQ spot for good food. There Brisket has no flavor and is cut on a machine instead of hand slice and not smoked or even well seasoned, if you are looking for good style BBQ this is not hte place. I have been all over this town looking for good BBQ, I know of a few but you have to travel to get there. Wish there was a good BBQ here in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Wanted to take my husband to a good BBQ place for Fathers's  day. We saw this place and decided to give it a try. That was a mistake. We will never go back.   Portions were to small. My kids ordered chicken nuggets and they got dino bites so you know they were frozen, I could have made them at home.Good thing kids eat free on sundays cause I would have asked for a refund for that.  Caesar salad was Gross. menus should be on the same wall not have to walk around the counter several times to see what there is to order. where you order your food they have a heat lamp right there at your eye level. made it hard to make eye contact with the workers.   We will stick to Famous Dave or Road Kill Grill for awesome BBQ food."}
{"text":"I went to Dickey's and bought 1 lb of turkey and 1 lb of beef brisket. Each of these cost $12.00 a lb. When you ask someone to pay $12.00 a lb you should give them what they pay for. I did not ask for chopped brisket, so it should have been sliced like on their advertisement.   The turkey was sliced and what I expected, but to give me a bowl of crumbs for $12.00 was a ripoff for what I paid for it. The brisket should have been sliced. Now they may think they got over, but guess what? I only went in Dickey's to try their food in the hopes of placing a very large catering order, and if that were good and the staff professional, I would do business with them regularly, so they blew that. Enjoy that $12.00. You just lost thousands."}
{"text":"Wow...this was pretty bad. I mean almost everything was bad. The only saving graces were the bread and the iced tea. We both ordered combo platters with different things...brisket, chicken, pork. The brisket was bland. The chicken was dry. The pork was dry. Plus, if you are going to be a barbecue restaurant you should have a pretty outstanding sauce. Theirs is NOT that."}
{"text":"Yum! Glad to see some new variety in town. The little spendy, but worth it!!!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff - like out of control super nice. It was great service. Ribs fell right off the bone."}
{"text":"Wow wow and wow!!!! I am so pleased with the food 1st time I ate at Dickey's was in California and I was excited that we have one here now close to home I was hoping that the food would be good it was better than good it was so delicious. The Employees we so very nice I received a great greeting when I walked in the door and promptly asked if I needed help or if I have ever been to their restaurant you just don't get service like this anymore so this was very pleasing!!!! Other places you walk I'm they have some young person that does not even look up or greet you upon arrival nothing against young people but we like great customer service!!! The food was freaking amazing we order 3 meat plate Jalapeno cheddar sauage, pulled pork, chopped beef brisket, Mac n cheese, and Cole slaw like I said everything was delicious!!! I will be returning. The location is a little hard to find in the shopping center this tucked in the front behind the taco bell. Hope they keep the good food coming!!!!!"}
{"text":"I got the 3 meat plate. I had the pulled pork, beef brisket and chicken breast. The pulled pork and brisket were very good. The chicken was just ok. With the plate you get 2 sides (about the size of the small sides at KFC)and  a roll the was just ok. Slice of pickle and onions which I declined. Of each meat you get about 3.3 oz. I saw them weight it out. It's not much food for $13. My mom got the ribs and loved them.  Service is a little slow but that might be because they just opened. I will eat here again but I will just buy the meat and skip the plate. A pound of meat is $13. I think that is a better value.  You do get free self serve ice cream. That's always a plus."}
{"text":"Great customer service. Great food. Great price on lunch special. Too bad its hidden."}
{"text":"Very good! Lots of food for the money and the BBQ is perfect. All the sides are very good and they have free ice cream cones!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, great selection of meats and sides and even free ice cream and pickles.  I love that they offer every kind of meat..pulled pork, brisket 2 ways, chicken, ham, turkey and sausage and that the sides are a good size for the money and they have a good selection of sides so no matter what you are in the mood for this is the place!!"}
{"text":"Ok..i have no complaint about the food quality.  We tried both the brisket and pulled pork sandwiches with a couple sides.  The tab was nearly $20 for 2 very small nearly happy meal size sandwiches.  The sides were also very small.  I thought it was very over priced.  Sorry :("}
{"text":"Not impressed. Did not like the atmosphere of the establishment. Seemed dingy and dirty. Food was ok. I would recommend famous Dave's if you're in the mood for laid back inexpensive barbecue."}
{"text":"This place was the antithesis of fresh food. It's possible that the meat was good, and I believe it was, but the bagged products were so bad that it was hard to tell. I ordered online to get a brisket sandwich with a couple of extras, plus a \"taco\" with pulled pork. What I got was both of them wrapped in aluminum foil and the bread portions disgustingly limp and soggy. Evidently they prepared these ahead of time, put them in or under a warmer, then added the extras to the sandwich in response to my order. If I had visited instead of ordering online I probably wouldn't have ordered at all because the place was empty. And it was dinner hour. This restaurant appears to be at the end of its useful life, if it ever had one, and not worth anyone's attendance at the wake."}
{"text":"Dickeys is starting to change their menus and we're not happy about it. We like the older locations that have more menu options. Good quality food for families."}
{"text":"I would prefer to give them a zero  The food had zero taste. The whole point to eating BBQ is to taste the unique flavors considering everyone has their own recipes. No way this place has been around since 1941 serving this watered down food. The brisket sandwich was tasteless, the mac and cheeses was not cheesy. My friend had the potato that was topped with chicken, she said it also had no taste. The Ice cream was watery like a milk shake. Never again. Anyone that eats this stuff and gives a 5 stars must be family or has extremely low standards not just for BBQ."}
{"text":"Just like the ones in Texas!  I worked in Dallas for two years and this was it was a weekly if not daily stop of those trips!   Good BBQ. Good price.  Family of 5. For $50!   Free ice cream!   It's worth the drive from the near east side of Cleveland.  Use there rub when I smoke myself. But every once in a while. You just gotta go to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Love Dickey's BBQ on College avenue! I come here frequently and the staff is always extremely nice, and the manager works to make sure all the customers are satisfied. It gets pretty busy around lunch time, but that is to be expected with food this good, people who don't like to wait or understand what patience is shouldn't come here (or anywhere else). Love the Polish sausage and mac and cheese, the ice cream is amazeballs, better than Dairy Queen's soft serve."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved to the Valley and were super excited when we passed by Dickey's. We lived in TX for many years and visited various locations where we always has good service and good food.  The girl who served us was warm & friendly. Once we received our good, the experience went downhill quickly. I had chopped brisket and only ate two bites because it was insanely greasy. My husband had pulled pork, sausage and jalape√±o beans. All of the food was room temp and simply gross. What a disappointment. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The food was very good.  Pulled pork excellent.  Cashiers need a lot more training before they should be left alone at the register.  Staff behind the counters must be heard of hearing.  Had to repeat order several times before they got it.  Menu is extremely difficult to read, particularly when people are waiting in line to order.  May visit again, not sure."}
{"text":"It was ok kinda sad and way too expensive for what you get. If you want fast food bbq (which is NOT how bbq should be) come here if you don't mind the spending the not so fast food prices."}
{"text":"This place is great. I have tried: Brisket, Pulled Pork, Spicy Cheese Sausage, Chicken, Green Beans, Cole Slaw, and the Onion Straws.  The Pulled Pork and Chicken are a MUST! Also, their coleslaw is on point. Doesn't get better.  Pricing is about average for BBQ but totally reasonable because of how good it is.  The customer service has been great every time I go there.  Eating there is an overall enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"As a former Texan raised on good brisket, BBQ sauce, and pickles - this place delivers.  I would have given 5 stars but they mistakenly forgot to include a big part of our meal in the bag for takeout.  Once home, we were too far to go back . They did reimburse us the money on our CC.    The brisket here is about as good as you are going to find in Las Vegas.  Believe me. Trust me.  I have tried them all.  The sauce is excellent.  And they are one of the only places in town that automatically provides pickles and onions - a necessity for a brisket sandwich.    Today we also ordered the fried okra (pretty good) and the tanglers (aka, fried shoestring onion rings).  Both were good.    The meat is very tender and falls apart easily.  It's not the \"rubbery\" brisket you might find at other places in town.  All in all, I wouldn't travel to Las Vegas looking for good BBQ.  But for those of us who live here and appreciate good BBQ, Dickey's is one place that just never disappoints us."}
{"text":"Did you know they are opened for breakfast?!?  We got the brisket breakfast tacos and they were beyond yummy!  Just the right size for an on the go morning starter.  I brought in several for my office and everyone kept asking if I had more.  Best breakfast in town folks!"}
{"text":"Anyone that likes this has never smoked anything at home. 1 person taking your order and chopping meat and 1 person dressing the orders and cooking hot sides and 1 person taking the money on a busy Friday night = 2 cold sandwiches. Come on cheapo owner put another 2 or 3 bodies back of the counter  on busy nights. Who wants to stand in a line for 15-20 minutes for the privilege of paying for over priced average quality food."}
{"text":"I was warned about this place. Walked I'm all the Caucasian people were addressed, we the blacks were not. When it came to us the blacks we were treated like SPIT. We finally got addressed like a minute and a half later, in a you don't belong way, or a you disgust me way! Spencer and the guy making the sandwiches gave us disgusting looks. Now when the elderly white couple came to the counter they were treated like ROYALTY, i kid you not. Idk but that's not how you act in costumer service. Even me being a server I know how to put on a Proffesional face."}
{"text":"I like the food but the staff has alot to be desired. Very unorganized and they did not seem very happy to be there. The place was bot very clean. May need new management  or need to replace some staff."}
{"text":"I have had much better in Las Vegas.  $10.00 for a combo plate of 2 ribs and one link was way too expensive considering the meats were not so tasty.  The hot link was downright bad.  The sides?  Mac and cheese was weak.  Beans were weak.  Cole slaw was good.  Potatoe Salad was weak,  I can't really find anything goos to say."}
{"text":"I've been to Dicky's a few times so I figured a review was warranted.  This is BBQ restaurant that's served in a fast-casual type of environment, like Chipotle or Naf Naf Grill.  They have a good variety of meat (that's what she said) with pulled pork, ribs, brisket, chicken, turkey, ham and a few styles of kielbasa.  More than most barbecue places have.  You can get either a sandwich or just the meat, and also a variety of sides.  The sides are good, albeit a little pricer than you might expect.  Overall this is pricier than you may think from the fast-casual concept, with plates running about $10-12 a person.  They do have a special for different days of the week which I'd recommend for the budget-conscious. (Err... that's me) While it does seem pricy for the concept, for good barbecue, this is a reasonable price.  And it is good barbecue.  The pulled pork is tender. The turkey has a good overture of smokiness and the brisket is toothsome.  There are three sauces, basically sweet, normal and slightly spicy.   They are ok.  It does enhance the pulled pork, but I prefer the turkey without any sauce.  They also have cornbread here. It's good.  If I was a superhero, my arch-enemy would be sweet carbs. I would be the only thing preventing us from living in a world where we served at the whims of our sweet-carb overlords, but luckily for all, I'm just a poor schmuck whose cornbread resistance is approaching null.  Plus, there is free soft-serve ice cream.  It's about 7-11% better than most soft-serve vanilla. But maybe I'm just tasting the free part.    The interior is vaguely western-themed.  It's small inside, but I've never had an issue finding a seat. It's in the middle of small strip mall, surrounded by various other fast food options. Do yourself a favor, check this place out."}
{"text":"Good solid BBQ with heated sauce that is also very good. I also enjoyed the spicy cheddar sausage. Green beans were over cooked for my taste but I know some folks like that style. Ended with some free ice cream. :) we will be back."}
{"text":"They have an entertainment book advertisement in the window but they won't accept the entertainment book coupon itself...What gives?"}
{"text":"5 stars isn't enough!   Great service great food over all great and I will definitely come back! Staff was super friendly. Scott & Tara have great costumer service they're very friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Got the pulled pork, fries and mac and cheese. Wife got the pulled pork beans and slaw. Meat was very tender and I enjoyed the Texas style sauce. Will try the Brisket next time, I sampled a piece and it was very flavorful."}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times and it has always been delicious. I prefer just getting the meat (any of them!) and not going the sandwich route. The pork is my favorite and the hot BBQ sauce is fantastic. Get the side of potatoes, it's the best one. Staff is always friendly and quick each time I've been there. Certainly will go to again."}
{"text":"When you enter the store, you're greeted with an amazing aroma of smoke and slow cooked meats, but when you bite into your food, a wave of disappointment washes over your face.  I've had the ribs multiple times, and each time they were dry and uninspired. The meat was tough on the bone, and seemed to be overcooked.  Next, I thought I would try the brisket. After the first bite and swallow, the majority of it was still stuck in my teeth due to the meat being so tough and dry. A huge helping of their BBQ sauce didn't help the cause, and it just over saturated the bread.  The mashed potato side tasted manufactured. I definitely don't think it was made in house and it might have come in a pouch to be warmed up later.   I've given this place multiple tries and I'm met with the results. Generic BBQ for people who don't know any better.  The only saving grace this place has is the drive through window. The ironic part is the food isn't worth driving through to pick up."}
{"text":"6:30 PM and out of ribs. Are you kidding me? Ridiculous. No apologies, nothing. Not the first time either, according to the reviews on here. If you run out of ribs several times, you might think about smoking more for the day. Another couple was going in as we were leaving, and turned around and left because no ribs. You're a BBQ restaurant, you should never run out of ribs. Gimme a break."}
{"text":"Meal was tasty and service was blazing fast. Portions were reasonable for the price. restroom was clean."}
{"text":"Was it good? Eh, I know there's better but after sitting on a plane for four hours, I was ready for anything. I hate chains with a passion but this was one I hadn't seen before and the alternative was Chipotle or McDonald's so we tried it. We ordered the picnic platter? picnic pac? Whatever. A plate of your meat of choice & 2 sides. We had  brisket, waffle fries  and caesar salad.  For a fast food place, the brisket was amazingly good. The fries were crispy but the side caesar salads were too small.  BBQ sauce is self serve, you have 3 bubbling vats to choose from, original, spicy & I forget what the third one was. The big jar of pickles would've been a nice touch if they were edible...we took a few to eat with our leftovers...big mistake. They also had hot peppers, those were ok. Not a bad place, stick with a sandwich, fries and a big cup of sweet tea & you'll be ok."}
{"text":"I'm looking for something positive to say and struggling.  The employees were nice! I've had far better 'BBQ'  from backyards. How do you represent Texas and do that to brisket? Very sad: dry, flavorless, unattractive, just shaking my  head.  The sides are ok.  The 'ice cream' machine doesn't work.  Somehow they stay open, they must be doing something right, I just can't figure it out. And it is not cheap!"}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place and finally did. The chicken was amazing as well as the spicy BBQ sauce. I also tried a brisket slider that was really good. The only down side is they forgot the Cole slaw on the slider and we ordered the family pack and received our food without rolls?  The macaroni is very very basic. That was disappointing but other than that I would give it was good and I would give it another try"}
{"text":"Sorry I ate at this location I got very sick had to go to hospital for food poisoning. Call Eddie the mangers about this he didn't have a care in the world about us as customers. I've never had a problem at the other locations in Texas but this franchise location was not run with a care I should of realized it when I walked in and there was no up keep of the restaurant BBQ sauce all over the counter bathroom with toilet paper all over the floor looks like it hasn't been mopped in awhile. I will be calling corporate about this."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed this location, but on this visit we noticed that the entire restaurant looks like it could use a good scrubbing.  Sink around faucets is black, my hands felt dirty after washing than before!.  Silverware dispenser is covered with splatters of bbq sauce.  Door handles dirty.  It makes it hard to enjoy the bbq, which is quite tasty, when you see how dirty the surroundings are.  I'm surprised manager or owner doesn't notice these things and insist that everything get a thorough cleaning!  Also, the large pots that hold the bbq sauce should really have nozzle dispensers.  When people use the ladle to pour sauce into small plastic containers, sauce runs over their fingers and back into the pot.  Not appetizing."}
{"text":"I go out Saturday looking for some BBQ and a cold beer  we get  To Dickeys BBQ pit on Happy Valley .let me tell you I was disappointed When the girl behind the counter says we don't have beer but they  Have beer lights in the window and they are turned on Lol can we say false advertising then we get the food The pulled pork was warm at best one plate came with a roll one didn't The pickles had no flavor just disappointed been coming here for along time probably never be back .one less place to pick from."}
{"text":"Came here with my lady and I got the pork ribs, mac n cheese, and fried okra. I will mostly likely never come back to this place. The mac n cheese was good but everything else was ok. DO NOT BRING A GIRL OR GUY HERE ON YOUR FIRST DATE PEOPLE. They may think you have bad taste. Wait till date 100.  The ribs come with no bbq sauce and you have to put which ever flavor you want on them. The ribs were tender but the sauce wasn't that good. I really didn't like how water down the sauce was. Fried okra - theres nothing to discuss.  But if your high as a kite or pretty drunk im sure the food would taste better then average BUT HEY FREE ICE CREAM IS ALWAYS GOOD RIGHT?"}
{"text":"Once again a great meal. You can't beat the consistency, and it's always good. The staff is always pleasant and accommodating.. Is there better..., sure but not at this price, and they are usually not as consistent."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork sandwich. Very tasty!  Good service, good food and clean restaurant. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Fast bbq. Free ice cream. What else do I need to say. The price is good for what you get. it may not be a stake house but it's better then fast-food."}
{"text":"How can brisket that is smoked have no bark or smoke ring?  I needed BBQ and it was close next time I have craving will go elsewhere"}
{"text":"I really like this little place! I had the Thursday special on Tuesday, which had cheddar sausage & pulled pork and I really enjoyed it. And I like nearly any place that serves fried okra!"}
{"text":"Good place if you want quick barbecue food, the taste of the food isn't bad, but does not come close to Famous Daves which taste by far better, and only over the freeway by Target.. The prices are ok for what they serve, customer service is always good when I'm there."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time on Saturday. It was pretty good. The kid's meals were really nice, good portion of food for the price. Of course the free ice cream was a hit for us too. The mac n cheese was top notch! My brisket was a little dry and not served very hot when I got it but it was seasoned very well and I enjoyed it. The best part too was the staff and customer service! The employees that worked that afternoon were very courteous & polite and because  of that, I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I placed an order with GrubHub for this establishment and I am in shock at how the food was delivered to me.  First, I ordered a kids meal which came with a lemonade. The GrubHub driver showed up with no children's drink and his excuse was \"its not shown on his menu so I would have to take it up with Dickeys.\" Now, the children's menu came with chips and the damn bag of lays chips was stuffed INSIDE of the carton with the ribs!  Also, EACH food container was COVERED in BBQ sauce. Please keep this in mind as I continue this review.  I called Dickeys and advised about the missing drink and was advised that they weren't going to deliver it but that I could come to the restaurant to retrieve it. Well, I just paid for delivery so....not happening. THEN I mentioned the chip bag being inside of the rib container and all of the boxes being saucy and the dickeys rep says \"we don't package it that way so it must have been the GrubHub driver\" so basically dickeys is saying they allow the GrubHub drivers behind the counter to package food? Absolutely ridiculous and Dickeys certainly just lost a customer.  ***I ATE AFTER I posted this review and the food wasn't even redeeming. The chopped beef brisket tasted EXACTLY like a slim Jim beef jerky stick and the mac and cheese tasted liked watery KFC Mac and cheese. Lastly, the beans tasted like bush's beans. NEVER EVER AGAIN will I eat from this restaurant. No Dickeys at any location! The $45 I paid for this crap was not worth it. Update, GrubHub was nice enough to provide me a $5 credit and Dickeys so generously refunded me $1 for the missing kids lemonade. How sweet of them."}
{"text":"Simple barbeque that is best on Sunday when kids eat free.  Barbeque is best when moist and tender, hence going on busier days ensures freshness.    As good as Famous Dave's and without the lively atmosphere of Lucille's, but then again this establishment is in a strip mall in front of the Las Vegas South Outlet Mall.    Disclosure...I'm from Texas.  I have eaten wonderful barbeque all through the South...this is as good as I've had in Las Vegas.  If you like BBQ, you'll like this family friendly restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is extremely fantastic ! highly recommend it  really nice people EXCEPT ROB ,he either needs to quit ,or go home & get a better attitude ."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE, I have no idea what their food tastes like - On Saturday, I was running and errand and decided to stop in and grab a menu from Dickey's.  I am always looking for casual restaurants in the neighborhood for our family. I was excited by their menu and was pleased to see they offered several gluten-free options for me. I was so excited by their menu that I made plans to come back that night with my husband, son and parents. When we arrived, there was another couple waiting at the front counter. They were frustrated because no one had come to the counter to take their order.  Someone finally came from the back and began taking orders. We placed our order and found a table. After 30 minutes of watching everyone else who came in after us (about 12 people), eating their dinner, we asked where our food was. The employee looked stunned and went in the back to check on our order.  He started to come back to our table but decided to take orders at the counter before returning to our table, taking another 10 minutes. Apparently, the employee who took our order had gone home for the night and never put in our order. We were so frustrated and disappointed that we asked for our money back so that we could go find somewhere else to eat. The employee had to call the owner to figure out how to give us our money back. After spending another 10 minutes on the phone with the owner we were finally given our money back and left.  We were so disappointed after the experience we will not be back and after reading the reviews I don't think we are missing much."}
{"text":"We were looking for a change from 3 Pitts Again and Dickeys popped up as an option We were having the whole family over so we had a few questions about portion choices available online. My husband called and was able to talk to (and please forgive me in advance for not getting your name right ) ... Adometria?  She was extremely helpful and in addition called us back to confirm our order.  When we went to pick up we were greeted by amazing smells and friendly staff. Adometria assembled our order perfectly  We ordered brisket, the turkey and pulled pork. We also ordered ribs and also the jalape√±o and cheese kielbasa YUM! We had all 3 types of sauces to choose from- the meats were all juicy and flavorful and enjoyed by everyone There were also plenty of slider buns provided so you could enjoy your meal that way if you like We also ordered the beans, mac and cheese and the most amazing potato casserole  There wasn't anything we would not order again Dickeys at Peoria has become our BBQ place of choice for our family"}
{"text":"This place is really awesome!  I love the pulled pork sandwich with the coleslaw topper and my husband loves the ribs,  They have a really good selection of plates and sandwiches and a lot of different sides to choose from.  They also have free ice cream.  The staff is always very nice !!!!"}
{"text":"If Dickey's was located in a Strip hotel they would clean up.   Terrific BBQ especially the sandwiches."}
{"text":"The best BBQ in Las Vegas.   Nice daily specials."}
{"text":"Awesome Dickey's!! Friendly staff, amazing food, and nothing beats free ice cream!!"}
{"text":"Went in around 6pm on a Monday night and was one of only two customers in the place.    I was expecting that the staff would make it a point to be especially welcoming and helpful, but was disappointed in that nobody even noticed that I was at the counter until I cleared my throat to alert them to my presence.  A bad start but I figured maybe they were still new and might be having an \"off\" day.  Ordered a brisket sandwich...which was carefully and obviously portioned.  Clearly, they were only as \"generous: as they needed to be and not a tenth of an ounce more.  Really put me off.  Likewise, the side orders were carefully portioned with a level scoop into a paper cup.  Sorry, but it didn't feel the least bit hospitable at all.  The moment of truth: the food.  Bun on which my sandwich was served was stale and fell apart as I ate the sandwich, turning it into a kinfe-and-fork meal as it disintegrated.  Meat was OK...not bad, but certainly one would not need to look far to find a superior meal.  The mashed potatoes were OK and the beans were nothing special either. Portions were adequate but neither overly large or small.  During the meal, the owner and the manager seemed to be instructing a couple of unhelpful and marginally competent teeneagers who seemed uninterested in their jobs during my interaction with them. On my trip through the line, which took eight minutes (even though I was the only customer in the line, and one of only two in the restaurant) the employees did not work together to expedite my order.  Sorry to say, they are going to have to make a fairly big turnaround in their service time, their employee attitudes, their obvious portion control, and the freshness of their buns.   I'll probably give it one more try, hoping that my experience is the result of the fact that the restaurant is still new and they don't have their operation smoothed out yet.  My prediction is that in two month's time, the restaurant will be a success or will be padlocked with a \"For Rent\" sign in the window.  This restaurant has a lot of potential but will be quickly out of business if it doesn't shape up."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Dickey's BBQ Pit in Parma, OH and I really enjoyed it!  The ribs were fantastic and the green beans and baked potato casserole were outstanding.  The beans tasted like they were fresh-picked from the garden.  The atmosphere was friendly and casual.  I'll definitely go back often!"}
{"text":"I've found Dickey's restaurants tend to be hit or miss but this one is definitely a hit!  The meat here is always very fresh and high quality. The brisket is tender and has very little fat. Their sides are pretty good as well. I'm a big fan of their sweet BBQ sauce.  The staff are friendly and attentive. I hope this place doesn't go anywhere anytime soon!"}
{"text":"Top notch. Great food, ave service. Clean and modern looking. Plus free ice cream at the end of your meal. The food is pretty darn good too. We will be back. Thanks for a good experience."}
{"text":"Dickey's catered our sister's surprise birthday party, and boy to our surprise they're serving portions were for 6 yrs. We paid over seven hundred dollars to feed 55 people, which 4 were children. We were lucky that all our guests didn't show up, because we were out of food with only feeding 45. Like I said , the 4 children were included in the 45. For the meat a serving size is 4 oz. I thought a person on a diet got to eat 4 oz. of meat. NOT INPRESSED AT ALL."}
{"text":"Found this place through yelp and there was an offer for 20% off my order. I go in and order my food and show the manager my yelp 20% off deal and the manager says he doesn't know anything about the offer and he won't honor it."}
{"text":"I had the 2 meat plate.  I had \"pulled pork\" and \"turkey\".  For sides I had laoded potatoes and macaroni and cheese.  The meats tasted the same, and it wasn't a good taste. The sides weren't hot and nothing special.  Guy who worked there wasn't personable at all.  Never going back, and wouldn't tell a friend."}
{"text":"I went into Dickeys barbecue pit on the 20th of November. It seemed like a ghost town but the staff there assured me they were busy other days. They said this was an unusual friday. I decided to try the food. I read other reviews on yelp and the positive outweigh the negative.   Let me say first of all, The customer service at this place was impeccable. Devin, the manager was the first to greet me in the store while the other employees were cleaning up the store  and helping other customers at their tables.  I love a clean place to eat!! :)  You could tell the employees were working hard and a bit tired.... but they smiled and did everything to make me and my husband comfortable. I loved that. I'll definitely be back. Ashley was a great help to us. Thank you sweetheart. You work hard!!!"}
{"text":"Perfect baby back ribs!! Slow cooked, Fall off the bone & perfectly smoked!! These are not boiled & then grilled to give some char or smoke effect like some other overrated BBQ places. Reasonably priced for wht u get."}
{"text":"This BBQ is as good as it gets for Texas BBQ and it is right here in Vegas.  Free ice cream too."}
{"text":"Good brisket.Friendly staff.Budget friendly."}
{"text":"Food was good...we've had Dickeys' before but in the Huston airport where they had these unbelievable breakfast brisket tacos, 2 for under 6 bucks!  Unfortunately this location does not have these:(.  This location seemed a little pricy too...so feeding a family of 4 won't happen very often here.  Checked in from my yelp app and got a coupon for a free ice cream!  When my son tried to redeem the staff said the ice cream is already free. Anyway, food was good, location was clean, and staff were very helpful."}
{"text":"The brisket is the bomb!!! Kids eat free on Sunday and a military discount! Awesome! We'll be back for sure!!! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend and was very very impressed. They have nice size portions and the sides are to die for. Its fairly small restaurant, so I was thinking it was going to just ok. However they quickly changed that opinion with the welcoming atmosphere and friendly employees. I'll probably stop in again very soon because I really like their pulled pork with spicy BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"Second time eating here this week. Love the chopped beef brisket. Okra, Mac and cheese, sweet tea! This is comfort good at its best. But the staff is the best part. Super friendly and helpful. To top it off - there's free ice cream. The place was clean, the line was short, everything was great. Hooray for the big yellow cup!"}
{"text":"The stars are for the meat and sauce. Very good. I always get the polish sausage and pulled pork with honey sauce. The negative two stars is for the service. One man in particular will not acknowledge you when you come to the ordering area and has a gruff \"what do you want, you jerk\" kind of attitude. They have given me the wrong sides before, even though I am very clear. Some sides they never have ready it seems and you have to wait, although to be fair, you only wait for five or ten minutes. I must say that some of the employees are great, but that one guy is serving the meat 90% of the times I go there if just so off-putting. Fried Okra and mac n' cheese are pretty good."}
{"text":"My Wife and I have been to Dickey's 4 times now, and that in less that two weeks,.  Each time it's something new.  Had a nice conversation with Andrew and learned about Dickey's and I tried the Chicken and enjoyed it.  Very tender as well as moist.  With a little of the Dickey's Original BBQ Sauce made it even better."}
{"text":"The staff here is amazing - they are SO friendly, helpful and enthusiastic! The brisket was very lean, as requested. The creamed spinach, mac & cheese, and beans were also very good. The new menu is a la carte, but they have daily special combinations if you want. We very much enjoyed our visit and we will be back."}
{"text":"There were only two people in the place when we came in. The nice man cooking asked if he could help us and when we were ready to order the snotty little girl behind the register said we needed to wait. I had to ask her if we could get our cups for our drinks which I actually had to go get myself. The two people that left  stopped to tell us that they had horrible service and not to go to the restroom or we would lose our appetite. Food was ok but not great. This was our first time and no one bothered to explain the menu then she talked to us like we should already know. I will not go back there again and it is really sad that a lot of other people coming to town will get the same experience."}
{"text":"Seems like most of the reviews are for the branch location (dine-in/ carry-out), so I'd like to first offer up a review for Dickey's catering.  We recently hired Dickey's to cater our wedding reception.  The barbecue was excellent, and my guests raved about it.  We had some leftovers the next day, and I had no problem finding people to take some.  I'd recommend the chopped brisket and the pork ribs (the meat fell off the bone after I touched it with my fork).  If you're looking for a white meat option, the turkey is also very good - very moist.  The price added to our satisfaction.  I've had a lot of the fancy, formal, fish/ chicken/ steak-type wedding meals, that aren't always that good.  At $13 per person (we added a 3rd meat), we had very economical catering, and great tasting food.  Nick and his staff were very good to work with.  There is a lot to coordinate with wedding events, and they always called or emailed me back when I had questions or changes to our final headcount or reception scheduling.  They never seemed short or frustrated with us, either.  It was an all-together positive experience, and I can highly recommend Dickey's BBQ  As for our experience dining-in, we usually order (2) 3 meat plate, and for my wife and I - that's enough food for two meals each.  The place is neat, employees are helpful, and the free soft serve is a nice touch."}
{"text":"It's drive thru BBQ, so what's not to love. The brisket is really good, the waffle fries are awesome. I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"We had bakers (baked potatoes) catered to our office for an employee's 40yrs of service anniversary luncheon.   From the first call to the final delivery, I was very impressed!    Service - excellent Food Quality - Excellent  (the baked potatoes were huge!) Would definately order again from Dickey's.  If you are looking for something different beside the usual pizza or sandwiches, this is the way to go!"}
{"text":"I've tried Dickey's a few times now, each time hoping for better food and service. Unfortunately that time hasn't come. On my most recent visit, the staff were generally uninterested in serving the customers, the whole place was hot, and the food was not good. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich (which tasted like almost nothing - the BBQ sauce didn't help - and the bun looked like it had been dipped in a tub of lard), mac and cheese (just tasted like extremely salty noodles), and potato salad (which is better described as flavorless mush). I'm not sure why I've continued to go back, but I'm almost certain I won't be back again. I can't quite find any redeeming factors anymore. Do not recommend, especially if you've ever had any decent BBQ."}
{"text":"This was the first time and probably the last time going to Dickey BBQ. I heard some good commits so I tried it. The ribs were dry and the potatoes casserole tasted like boxed mash potatoes and the green bean and bacon was just bland."}
{"text":"Decent place with decent food...noticed that they had a \"B\" from the health inspector but it was after we had already ordered and paid, otherwise we would not have stayed. Used a coupon for a buy one get one from the entertainment book so that saved a few bucks. Ordered the two meat plate, the brisket was decent but had a fair amount of fat on it, the virginia ham was also okay but not great, the green beans were good and the potato salad had a different taste and texture to it...sweet tea was good and they give you a big yellow cup to take with you for only $2. They also have the free ice cream, cones and cups, as well as the pickle jar and two different sauces to choose from...the salad was also pretty good. As this place is far from the area where we live we may not end up going there again, unless we are on that side of town for a reason, not to go specifically to the restaurant...."}
{"text":"Tasty. I love the relaxed atmosphere. This is my third stop at a Dickie's, and my first time at this particular one. I love the format of these restaurants... very relaxing once you know how to order. Bad beans were a bit spice but the BBQ sauce is great and the pork was stupendous. Onion rings (I forget their special name for them) are excellent."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to a Dickie's since the one in Chandler (at Rural and Chandler Blvd.) closed. We had a GroupOn coupon. It took a while to decide what we wanted because they had so many choices but the servers didn't get upset while waiting for us to read the options.  I got the brisket and hubby got the ribs. We had the original sauce which we both liked (I don't like anything spicy).   Our service was truly exemplary. They asked at least 4 times if there was anything else they could get us. All the employees seemed to know how to do a great job and accomplished that.  What amazed me was how hot the sides stayed as I ate the brisket. I got the potato casserole and green beans with bacon. When I looked at the beans, I didn't expect to like them as they were way over done but they had a good flavor. The roll was still warm by the time we were done eating (can't eat wheat).   All in all we had a great experience and will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is some seriously delicious Barbeque.  The place just opened a few months ago.  We've heard some good things but hadn't made it there until yesterday. FANTASTIC!!  We had the Smoke BBQ Chicken, the Beef Brisket Sandwich, BBQ Beans and  a desert (we'll get back to the desert).  The chicken was amazing and you could really taste the flavor.  The Brisket was tremendous on the sandwich, my wife said, (I wouldn't know cause she would share it with me, and the beans had an tasty Zing in them from the house bbq sauce that made them really pop. Now the Pecan Pie.  Absolutely Scrumptious!  It had just a lite crust with a hint of a salty sweet taste making it the perfect compliment after the chicken.   Very reasonably Priced and absolutely Fantastic. Pit Boss Andrew was very friendly and helped us with making order options as we had never been there and he made sure our visit was top notch.  Clean in the restaurant and even the high chairs were clean and ready to go.  Ever been to a restaurant with you kid and need to bring your own chair cause you don't  trust the house ones?  yep these are clean. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I've tried this location three times and each time liked it less.  My third visit will be my last.  I had the two meat plate of pulled pork and beef brisket with sides of bbq beans and potato salad and sweet tea.  I was there 20 minutes after they opened and my pulled pork was cold, the beef brisket was tender and served hot.  The bbq beans were way too watery, while the potato salad was decent.  The sweet tea was below average in quality.  Also, they over charged me on my order and instead of making the correction in the register and giving me the correct difference back, the employee reached into the tip jar and took out a dollar and handed it to me!  We can use more decent bbq places around the valley, but this location will not be one of them."}
{"text":"Went there today for the 1st time. ordering is so confusing. The guy taking our order was chewing on a toothpick. The second time I had to ask him to repeat himself, he turned around and spat out the toothpick and then talked to me like I was stupid. When he told the man in the white coat what I had ordered it sounded wrong when I tried to explain what I wanted The man I believe to be the manager, yelled that's what he just said! I should have walked out then. The food was cold and not fresh!. This is not BBQ! Tastes like it was frozen warmed up and then they keep everything in a big in a warming oven. We will not be back. This is the worst BBQ I have ever had!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in the surprise area. Im so glad they opened  a location in surprise we have been going to the central Phoenix  location for many years and have always left satisfied . The brisket is amazing . The pulled pork is excellent  as well. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great Barbecue and laid back atmosphere. Fries are to die for and the rest of the sides are also delicious. Their sauce is the best. Free ice cream to boot."}
{"text":"I was excited to try out a new BBQ place in Mentor. I go there on a Saturday night and they have no chicken!  How does a BBQ place run out of chicken? Very disappointed. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"Dickey's is a small but clean restaurant located in a strip mall next to the Factory Outlet Center.  You walk in, order your food and have a seat.  They will bring it to you if you are dining in or call your name when your takeout is ready to go.  They serve Texas BBQ with the traditional accompaniments: dill pickles, raw onion and jalapenos if you choose.    I find the brisket to be good.  It's very tender and juicy.  That's no small achievement with brisket.  One odd thing though.  I've been to Dickey's several times and never experienced the smoky flavor the other reviewers describe.  I'm not complaining because their meat is really good.  The outside of the meat is black, and you might think it is what BBQ fans call \"bark\".  Not so.  Even if you eat a small piece of it with nothing else, there is no smoky taste.  You can help yourself to a small selection of BBQ sauces.  Their standard sauce is good.  It is not as sweet as typical Texas BBQ sauce.  It has a little sharper taste.  The sides are ok.  I've had most of them and can't say they are particularly remarkable.  The do have fried okra which is a nice choice.  The Great Mystery Continues  Another trip to Dickey's and still no smoke. It's bizarre. The sign on the wall says \"Big Yellow Cup And Hickory Smoke\". They have a smoker. And yet, the meat is not smoked. It's not bad, but why not smoke it? The brisket is more like roast beef that the fabled Texas BBQ brisket. I have no idea why this is the case."}
{"text":"Paid amost $50 for a family pack to go that claimed would serve 4-6.  Glad there were only 3 of us.  Food was so-so.  Going back to The Q Shack next time for the quality and value."}
{"text":"Food is always acceptable for a fast service BBQ.  The guys behind the counter are generally very friendly. On my last visit on a slow evening the employees were doing a lot of cleaning which made me feel confident that the food is prepared in a safe environment."}
{"text":"Has this place changed ownership? The person behind the front counter was unfriendly, the brisket was almost half fat and the potato casserole side dish was greasy. Haven't been in this location in about 9 months but went from a 4 1/2 stars to 1 and the price was increased around 20%. Just sad really."}
{"text":"So I've come here probably 7-8 times since it's opened. The food is actually pretty good. the service is whatever, and the portions well....yeah... I'll get to that..   For the food itself there are no major issues. The food is consistency tasty, the sauce is a pretty good addition, and the sides (I usually do fries or onion tanglers) are a delicious addition to the menu.  I have no qualms with the quality of the food.  The service is probably on par with fast food. You know there's orders from on top to greet everyone, etc, have dedicated signs of where to go, but this location just doesn't really welcome it well by physical design. You come in to a wall which obfuscates vision, and puts a lot of standing room, that doesn't really facilitate customer service. All of the places previously here (Shanes, Hog's Heaven, etc) All had cash registers right as you walked in, and it was a better service model. The building is planned for the other door (That leads to a patio that nobody EVER uses), that can only be reached to on foot, and it just doesn't facilitate anything well. The best bet would be to try and expand the store since it the building very narrow and hard to move around in.   My last issue with this restaurant is the portions. They are so inconsistent I never know what to order.  I tend to get the 3 meat platter since I am a 1 meal a day person, and yet sometimes I've ordered the smaller meat plates and gotten the same amount of food. I've ordered 3 times this last week alone and one day I've gotten a plastic container full of fries and a few small slices of chicken, I've gotten a plastic container full of chicken and just a paper container of like 10 fries, and one of the 1 meat plates that got me somewhere in the middle.  I feel like I should just order the smaller portion and hope that fate decides to give me enough that I would consider enough food, but I tend to order the 3 meat given the difference is only about $1.50. I wish they could standardize this so I could standardize my order.  My only Nit-picks are I wish this place had different deals. You can get free Ice Cream, and kids can eat free on Sunday for Dine-In. You can also get a free drink for signing up for their email club. I honestly wish there were deals to lower the cost of the food, as my order for 1 can be $10-14 (Again depending on the portion size gamble), as I can get 2 orders of Canes for that price.   Dickey's being a chain that has some grounding here in Vegas probably fares better than the two places picking it as their first location, but there are some issues that it needs to address before it can cement itself into the landscape of the area. It's the 3rd or 4th restaurant that has gone in to that location, and it'd be a shame to see a 5th there someday.   EDIT: I've gone a few more times, and figured out a better way to order my meal (I found there's an option to order by the half-pound which is WAY more consistent if you're getting the same meat. The staff has been super friendly as well, and I feel they've ironed out a few of the kinks."}
{"text":"Great food. First time was very pleased. Will definitely be going back. Get the ribs. The service was friendly and attentive. If they run out o food its because its fresh. Not frozen."}
{"text":"Rude, rude, rude  ...when not rude, unprofessional.  Never had been to to this place went a few times hoping they'd eventually get it right (keep dreaming) nastiest rudest employees ever --except for zpizza.   Employee's are rude, Manager's are even ruder  .... owner's don't follow up on complaints (not sure they even get the complaints; if you know what  i mean --and  i think you do).    Example: called to place pickup order. My second time eating here i asked for \"pulled beef sand which \"  reply: \"we dont call it that here!!\"  thought id try explain was new didnt know \"dickie lingo\"  reply: \"i have other customers here ....\"  employee hung up.  Id suggest getting some cold cuts throwing into the microwave pour some ketchup and vinegar on top and you'd fair better ...and youd save yourself the headache of dealing with these rift rafts who most certainly live up to restaurant's name ...."}
{"text":"The bf found out about this place through fliers that were dropped off at his job.  We are foodies and fancy ourselves connoisseurs of bbq.  We've been to Joe's in Gilbert, have visited Phil's of San Diego many times, and before it closed I've enjoyed The Oklahoma Line in OKC, along with dozens of others.  The only reason I'm mentioning these other places is to show that I've had good bbq and have a bit of knowledge regarding the subject.  So two days ago, my bf showed up at home after stopping at Dickey's for some carryout after work.  This was our first time to try it.  He had the chicken sandwich and got me the pulled pork sandwich.  As this was to be a snack, we didn't get any sides, although he did pick up a couple of the free jumbo pickles.  We were both pleased with the moistness of the meat and the bbq sauce had a good flavor.  All in all, good enough for us to make it our dinner choice for tonight.    The restaurant is the corner shop in the shopping center at the intersection of Thomas and Hayden in south Scottsdale.  Run by 3 graduates of the Scottsdale Culinary School who have spent the last 7 or so years working at the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess as chefs, it's not a large restaurant, but cheery inside and clean.  It has a Subway type of set up where you start at one side, giving your meat order and move down the line giving your sides order and then move down the line to the register.    Our order for tonight's dinner is as follows:  The bf must've really been pleased with his chicken sandwich the other day  because he ordered it again with a side of coleslaw and a side of bbq beans.   I was eager to try new things, so I ordered a 2 meat plate with brisket and polish sausage along with sides of  fried okra, fried onion \"tanglings\" and jalapeno beans.   I also ordered a slice of pecan pie that was packaged in individual containers at the register.  For drinks, they have heavy \"big yellow cups\" in different sizes.  I like that alot because they're reusable and not just thrown into the landfill after our meal.    The brisket was so tender  and moist.  I wasn't sure how I'd like the polish sausage because other places who serve hot links or sausage have disappointed.  But this was actually good.  I tried the original bbq sauce along with the spicy bbq sauce and I prefer the spicy bbq sauce.  It has a kick to it, which is what I prefer.  The fried onion tanglings and the fried okra were good.  These are similar to what I've had elsewhere.  When I ordered the jalapeno beans, I envisioned beans that would be similar to the Wilbur Beans that they have at Famous Dave's.  I was expecting bbq beans with a sweet flavor that also had the firey spice of the jalapeno.  Not what I got at all.  I think typical bbq beans use pork and beans for the base, but these jalapeno beans used ranch style beans for the base.  So there was no sweetness whatsoever.  They were good, I also like ranch style beans, but since I was expecting something else, it was hard for me to be overjoyed with them.  It's totally my own fault for expecting Dickey's to be like other places.  If there was anything about the food that I didn't like, it was the pecan pie.  It wasn't awful, but it was obvious that they store these pie slices in the same refrigerator as the onions.  The heart of the pie was yummy, but the crust of the pie had the taste of onion.  As far as the portions go, I was satisfied and I'm no punk.  I can put down some food, and I had to get a to go container.  I thought I would be able to finish it all, but in the end, I was miserable....and so delighted about it.   My bf was also very pleased with his meal.  He also preferred the spicy bbq sauce, even though he mixed the original bbq sauce into his coleslaw and bbq beans because he liked it so much.  I had some of his bbq beans and liked them very much, maybe because they were closer to what I was expecting my beans to be like.    The drinks are free refills, of course.  The jumbo pickles are free.  And complimentary ice cream cones after your meal.  The prices were not more expensive than any other bbq restaurant that I have visited.  BBQ is not going to be as cheap as a spaghetti dinner or Mexican food.  Quality meat has a bit of a higher cost.   This is not the best bbq I've ever had, but it's good.  The staff is super friendly and attentive, which is how I came to know about the history of the three owners.   I'll probably be back again in a few days.  I like this place alot."}
{"text":"I was so excited that a bbq place is so close to my house so I went to try it out today.... sad news I will never come back nor recommend this place to any friends. When I walked through the door a waitress or bus lady accosted me and asked if I was on the VIP list. I said no then she told me to leave that they are only open for certain people. What a horrible first impression. Save your time and money just go to Dave's bbq !"}
{"text":"We love to call in an order when my son has friends over.  We get a family pack so all the boys can eat what they like with 3 different types of meats and sides they enjoy. The boys love the mac and cheese and we always order at least 8 extra rolls...they are so delicious and get gobbled right up!   Super friendly staff when we go pick it up!   I always get a lemonade when we get the food  - best lemonade I have ever tasted!  We love this place!"}
{"text":"For a quick and easy BBQ place, this hits the spot.  Plenty of options to choose from for main dishes and sides.  Been here several times for lunch and have always enjoyed.  Staff is friendly and the service is quick."}
{"text":"Super friendly, awesome staff. The BBQ is excellent and the sauces are Superb. Warmed up too! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and clean location.  But the food at the Scottsdale location is consistently better. Like, almost two different restaurants better. The whole point of a chain is getting the same quality food no matter which one you go to, but that isn't the case here.  Examples... At this Chandler location, the pulled pork is almost always dry, the chicken is dry, a little chewy, and not very marinated. The self serve sauce has temperature issues. On more than one occasion I've tasted (what smells like) melted plastic. I realized later that the pot they store it in is sometimes way too hot.  If you want really good Dickey's, try the one in Scottsdale. It's consistently excellent in both food and service. (Of course, that depends on the Scottsdale location being convenient when your in the mood for it.)"}
{"text":"Let's start out with the good. The food? Not bad at all. The mac and cheese kind of reminded me of kraft, but the meats were nice and juicy, tender, slathered in decent sauce, and the coleslaw was okay. Although I didn't have one, it's pretty cool they had free soft serve ice cream cones!  That being said, the service was terrible. We were not get greeted nor acknowledged. When we approached the person working, they mumbled instructions on how to order, and continued to mumble in response to any question about the menu. It was almost like the workers were mad about something, judging by their facial expressions and attitude. I don't believe we were rude in any way, so I call the salty service uncalled for.  As far as price, quality, service and quantity goes, there are much better options not far away. Not to name names, but I'm particularly thinking of a place that rhymes will Null's Neats."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! As soon as you walk in, you are kindly greeted by all staff members. I was unsure what to order and was given samples and great recommendations. The food is delicious. I got the picnic meal to share, the individual meals are a bit expensive. The brisket was full of flavor but I wasn't a fan of the chicken. I love the interior design! I will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Myself and three family members went to Dickey's for a little BBQ lunch. We really enjoyed the food and the service was great and fast. I especially liked the pork ribs. They were very tasty and tender. They also had great sides to go with the meal. I thought the green beans were great! I would definitely be going back and would highly recommend Dickey's BBQ to anyone."}
{"text":"I love this place. We use Dickeys for catering at work from time to time and they never fail! As a matter of fact, the food is so good that we had catering for lunch today and I had to go back for dinner tonight. The jalape√±o beans are nothing short of phenomenal. I know good BBQ, and this place is a carnivores paradise!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but there are too many things here that need fixing.  First the good:  1. The meat is tender 2. The okra is good 3. The location is next to a busy shopping area, probably a lot of coincidental business.   Now for the bad:  1. The whole ordering process needs to be rethought. Waiting in line, then telling the meat slicer guy your meats, who then yells it at the guy next to him, who then asks you what you ordered, twice, then tells the order to the guy next to him at the register... Yeah, it isn't the most efficient way to do it.   2. Give me a complete order, not bits and pieces. About 3 minutes after the ordering process, the guy handed me a tray with two piles of meat without sauce, two pickle chips, and a small chunk of raw onion. The sides were still cooking. Then he asked \"what sides were those again?\" Which was the third or fourth time I repeated them. About 3 minutes later, a pseudo waiter brought me the first side (fries). He then asked what the remaining side was, I repeated okra. A few minutes later the okra came out.   Seriously, have a prep area in the back. Have a register in the front. Take the order once. ONCE! Then build a whole order and either walk it out our announce an order number. There is a reason nearly every other fast food restaurant does it this way, it's a proven model that has stood the test of time. Don't try to be clever and reinvent something,   3. It says on the menu the plate comes with pickles and onion. I wouldn't advertise that fact unless you plan on actually serving plates with a full dill spear. The two destroyed dill chips that would normally be on a burger made me feel gypped.    Finally, the ugly:  1. the BBQ sauce isn't that good. I've tasted better from the grocery store. Seriously, for being a BBQ place, the sauce should be the key ingredient. Instead, it's off to the side in a tiny little self serve bucket. Three different flavors: original, sweet, and spicy. The sweet was almost good, the original wasn't very good at all.   Overall, I give them two stars for the good sides and the quick food (BBQ in 10 minutes is kinda nice, even if the sauce wasn't). As far as the lack of efficiency goes, I hope the owner is reading and seriously considers changing it."}
{"text":"Not horrible, but most aspects of the experience disappointed.   Not only did nobody greet us when we came in, the order guy ignored us so well that we didn't know he was the person to give our order to. So we wandered down the food line and the cashier explained that the guy on the end (who was ignoring us) was the order guy. He didn't wear gloves while slicing our meat, which is a bit of a surprise these days. The rest of the staff were agreeable.   Sides are too small. My beans didn't come halfway up the cup. Potato salad was stingy, probably a very level 4 oz scoop. The manager may think he's saving money, but he's really alienating repeat business. My friend ordered several a la carte sides. $2.75 each for the same meager portions.  Meat was acceptable but nothing special. No real BBQ characteristics. Pork was shredded and tangled, somewhat dry, not much smoke flavor. Brisket was also borderline dry, 3 slices and the rest mangled chunks. The meats tasted baked/braised, probably from being held over a long time in the hot box. Beans were served hot, but were mushy and overcooked. Potato salad was flavorless. These items had worse flavor and texture than grocery deli items. I like the tangy and spicy sauces here which lubricated the less than tender meat, helping it go down. My friend liked his fried okra but said the macaroni and cheese was stingy, mushy and flavorless.  Store was dirty. Dirty floors, trash bin overflowing and covered in sticky sauce. My iced tea was so weak it had almost no color. I dumped it and refilled with Coke, which was also aggressively watered down, as was my friend's Dr. Pepper.  Total bill before tax for 2 people was just under $33. This was not a $33 experience. Virtually everything I've said has been repeated (repeatedly) in other reviews here, which tells you something about the management, the viability of this franchise concept, or both. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch around 11:30am on a Sunday and there wasn't a line. (By 12:30pm a line started to form but it moved quickly!)   Menu & Pricing: There are paper menus at the back of the line area in addition to the board menu above the counter. They both state the same thing, however the paper menu is friendly for first-timers like me. Made it easy to stand back and choose my order before going up to the counter. The combination plates and pricing were straightforward.   Food Order: I went with the 1-meat-2-sides combo. Sliced beef brisket, baked potato casserole, and creamed spinach. The brisket was perfect, the baked potato casserole was more like delicious mashed potatoes with bacon, and the creamed spinach was good, however I'd go with a different side next time. It was more like an artichoke dip without the chips. The combination plate also includes a bread roll.  Extras: BBQ sauces are self-serve by the utensils. The photo of the brisket is as is without any sauce added. There are also self-serve pickles and onions. The napkins come in the form of a paper towel roll you have to rip off.  Atmosphere: The volume was fine. I wouldn't have an intimate conversation here however I was able to hear the other person in a conversation just fine. The place was very clean and the decor was modern. Both indoor and outdoor seating is available.  Parking: There is a free large parking lot shared with the other retailers.    Verdict: Overall a great place for some quick bbq food."}
{"text":"Great service and selection. They can get busy around supper time but offer online ordering for a quicker option. Definitely comfort food and not meant for everyday but I'm not your mother so have at it hoss! :D"}
{"text":"The beef is actually pretty good..the sauce very good.  The meat portions are very small.  There is is guy slicing the meat very thin and weighing it on a scale.  Holy smokes people, this Texas BBQ, put some meat on the plate, raise the price if you have to.  The sides, especially the beans, are ok.  This is a BBQ place, it is should be about the MEAT"}
{"text":"Called to place a lunch order a month or two ago and they didn't have half of the food items advertised. Ended up canceling the order and heading elsewhere."}
{"text":"First, great bbq for sure. However got there on a Thurs night at 745 and they were out of Turkey and Chicken, they don't close til 9pm, bad business.  Quite pricey."}
{"text":"Great food, usually quick service and phenomenal BBQ sauce and sweet tea. I've been coming here at least once a week for a couple years given the proximity of my job, and I get recognized and even get discounts sometimes. Next step for me is to try the catering for my next event."}
{"text":"This is truly some great barbecue!!!  My family and I have eaten there 4 times in the last two weeks (It has only been open since 6/21/2012).  Every item we try is wonderful!!!  I would suggest the Baked Potato Salad, waffle fries and the onion tanglers.  For the meats, go for the brisket, pulled pork, ham and turkey.  You have 3 choices of BBQ sauce, Original, sweet and spicy.  They are all good.  The meats are juicy and they come without sauce added so you can add as little or as much as you want.  With your meal you get all-you-can-eat pickles and soft-serve.  Kids eat free on Sunday when you dine in."}
{"text":"I'm not sure where to start with this place, so I guess I will start with the pros. 1) the place is nice and clean. 2) the lemonade was great.  So my husband and I went he ordered the 1 plate and I ordered the quarter plate. On these plates come to sides , a biscuit ,onions and pickles. I got ribs potato salad ,baked beans and I ordered a side of macaroni also the biscuit and pickles and onions, my husband had brisket ,macaroni, baked beans ,the biscuit ,pickles and onions. The cashier discounted my food which I'm not sure why but most likely because he knows that the food is horrible.  My ribs tasted like leather and jerky combination the sides macaroni and baked beans were only lukewarm, they most likely cook the meat the day before and put it in the refrigerator and heated up to order which makes it get even more dry and hard. My  husbands brisket was dry and we already live in the desert so it sucks to get cottonmouth from meat !! also there was a hair on my husbands biscuit. So if you like dried meats and leather tasting ribs this is the place for you also if you don't like your sides to be heated up hot or to even have your food barely hot at all this is definitely a place for you was for sure a waste of $22. I definitely will not be returning but you go in at your own risk"}
{"text":"If you are looking for great BBQ, keep driving. By far sub par to Dallas location. The food was so salty we couldn't eat it. Almost felt like someone dumped the salt on our food deliberately.   Definitely will not go back."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ!  Three in my family ate different menu items, each was great, especially the pulled pork.  Loved the sauce, roll and free pickles too."}
{"text":"We recently held a fund raising dinner at my daughter's high school using Dickey's as the caterer.  The theme was Mardi Gras Murder Mystery.  Mitch from Dickey's couldn't have been more supportive and helpful, especially when it was discovered we did not have the proper sized chafing dishes, which he helpfully loaned us.  The food?  Absolutely finger licking good.  The BBQ sauce is perfection, the Mac and Cheese divine.  Both the brisket and the pulled pork were huge hits.  Thank you Mitch and the staff at Dickey's for helping make our evening so successful!"}
{"text":"I just finished eating at Dickies.  I don't eat a lot at one time. I ordered a 1/4 rack of the pork ribs with a side of baked beans. They give you bread also. The bar b que beans are delicous. The ribs were very flavorful and the flavor could only come from slow cooking. The ribs were tender and good. The ice tea was great too. All you can drink.  I'm sure I can find something to pick on like the one who didn't know they had free ice cream. (Great big sign and machine in the dining room lol). But I will not complain because I really enjoyed the food and will come back."}
{"text":"Disgusting limp ribs with minimal flavor, dried out pulled pork and a DIRTY restaurant. If the franchise holder knew this shop was so dirty they would probably shut it down. I've been to other Dickies and this was pitiful. Flies were everywhere. Get some pest control and cleaning supplies. Instead of watching football your employees should be cleaning."}
{"text":"Horrible. This location is the worst. We've been to the South Scottsdale location and it's fantastic. The Shea location had so many problems.  One person to work the front desk, take phone orders and drive thru orders. Condiment trays were empty. No ketchup. Tables greasy. No silverware. Dirty forks. The soft serve ice cream was liquid. The pulled pork was dry. The waffle fries were old. On a Saturday afternoon there was a total of 6 people in the entire place. I'm surprised this location is still open. I'm sure the health inspector would find alot of violations here. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised after reading so many \"not so good\" reviews.  The pulled pork was very tasty.  The sauce was so so but the meat is what counts!  So I give them a thumbs up!  We will definitely be going back for more!  So happy to have another BBQ place since we don't have that many.  Being from Kansas City it was really sad not having decent BBQ.  It's all about knowing how to smoke the meat.  Welcome to Mesa Dickeys!"}
{"text":"Grand opening day.  Fryer wasn't ready, ribs not ready...and was disorganized in general.  Ordering food isn't easy as you order at the end of the counter but the sides are on the side of the counter.  Food was fair...  In general not well prepared for opening day."}
{"text":"The menu is a little confusing to read. If they could simplify it and make the combo options clearer that would be awesome. Service could be a little better, it's crazy how far a smile will go. Over all the food is great.  There aren't a lot of BBQ joints in Las Vegas that you can get on the go. So for those reasons I gave it 4 stars."}
{"text":"Living in Vegas for 9 years we haven' t had many bad experiences in dining, but this, unfortunately, was one of them.  Here's how our experience started out. We were in line behind a couple who hadn't ordered yet and was waiting for the guy behind the counter to acknowledge them, once he did, he was nasty as all beat hell. Very poor attitude and acted like he was late for a cigarette break or needed a hit of something. The whole place seemed disorganized and none of the workers looked happy to be there, though the cashier was very polite and thanked us for stopping in.   We debated about leaving but decided to see if he acted that way to us, he was a little bit less rude, but you could tell he hates his job..The couple in front of us? They walked out with him rolling his eyes.     We went to order and upon ordering, we were told  that my first choice, ribs, they were out of , so then I ordered the Spicy Cheddar Sausage, yep, out of that too. My next was the Brisket, they were out of the sliced (which I wanted) and only had chopped. I went ahead and ordered that as a sandwich with two sides (mac & cheese & jalapeno beans). The mac and cheese was bland and the beans were the worst thing I have actually eaten other than a bar of soap. My wife lucked out as they they actually had  the item she wanted, a Pulled Pork Baked Potato. She  liked the pulled pork but it was cold as was the potato. My sandwich was ok . The best part of the meal was the crushed ice for our drinks.   We will usually give an establishment a second chance but not this place. How could you be out of ribs, sliced brisket, spicy cheddar sausage, polish sausage, and chicken on a Friday evening at 5:45 pm? Quite a few customers came in to order, only to be greeted rudely, and told they were out of almost every meat on the board except for pulled pork, chopped brisket, and ham. Most of them walked out and the rude bundle of joy just rolled his eyes and smirked. Not a good representative of your business having this idiot being on the front-line greeting customers, he  obviously needs to be in the back of the house or better, sent back from whatever work release program he came from. The total of the bill for a brisket sandwich and loaded baked potato and 2 sides, plus two drinks was $26.00 or should I say, too much.  Once again, an establishment that has poor judgement in hiring this guy, being poorly managed by not having the product that people are patronizing your establishment for, will not have our business, ever."}
{"text":"\"Run of the mill food\". We've been there twice since they opened. Nothing to get excited about. Its the kind of place you'll try every year ... to see if its improved. So far, it hasn't !  When I want BBQ Ribs or Chicken ....... I smoke my own ....... Then finish them off, for 2 minutes on the gas bbq."}
{"text":"Terrific food for a terrific price. Kids eat free on Sundays and they offer military discount. The pulled pork is incredible. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food. I've ate there several times. The only bad thing is they run out of meats and dont wanna cook anymore.  I got there at 730 one night and they close at 9. So for an hour and a half thry just sit around selling whats left and old.  Employee said we've run out on chicken.  Thats a bunch of crap. Ita money there losing so oh well. Ill take my business elsewhere"}
{"text":"I can only rightly give this place 3 stars after my experience last week. They were out of turkey, chicken and polish sausage and the portion I did get of the brisket was very small for the price and sides of beans and slaw were meh.  Too bad because service and brisket were good otherwise.  I will give this place another try as it is new and close by, but honestly not entirely looking forward unless they up their game."}
{"text":"The food was average at best, and way too overpriced. We got the ribs and brisket, and the meat was not moist nor juicy. The ribs were dried out, over-seasoned, and difficult to chew.  None of the sides were special. The fried okra was bland and didn't seem like it was prepared the way okra is supposed to be.   This place doesn't know how to do bbq, and it costs too much for unenjoyable food."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! Hosting a party at home so we placed an order online for rack of ribs among other things and waited for an hour before heading out to pickup the order and when you get there only to be told they cant fulfill your order because they dont have enough ribs. They didn't even bother to reach out ahead of time to let you know this cannot be fulfilled. An hour has passed after the order was placed online for crying out loud!!! Why?! This is at noon, on a Sunday. Why do you open for business without enough supplies?! Like going to a war with no ammo.. Such a disservice.  Nobody even tried to offer anything to correct it. You're definitely not getting any business from me or my tribe. I should have read the Yelp reviews first before placing my order. Better close shop."}
{"text":"I was hosting a luncheon for a client of mine and found Dickey's on Yelp.  I decided to hire them and was extremely happy with how punctual they were and the quality of the food.  Everyone said how delicious the food was and I would definitively use them for other catering needs in the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service sucks! I ordered the special with two sides. The staff gave me the wrong side baked beans instead of Mac & Cheese. My co-worker and I also ordered French fries, he had to ask later after we we're done eating for his fries. They still didn't bring out my fries! I spoke with one of the employees and he said all they can do is fix it, didn't want to give my money back or anything! And now he's arguing with my co-worker! The manager stepped up and gave me my money back!"}
{"text":"Went to Dickeys last night a bit later than usual.  Maybe about 745 to 8.  The young man preparing food was pleasant and helpful but slow.  He apologized a few times and explained he was super tired.  The cashier was a delightful young lady who engaged customers in conversation, greeted everyone, and tried to expedite fried food orders because they take a few minutes longer.  The problem came when we got our food.  We have been eating here since it opened.  The plates we were served looked like the amount of food usually left on our plates when we are finished and cannot eat another bite!  Super small servings is not the norm at this place.  So, maybe it was end of shift and things were running low.  Lesson learned!  Don't head to Dickeys late in the evening."}
{"text":"Tried Dickey's Barbecue on the 303 and Bell Road for the first time. I ordered a 3 meat it consisted of smoked turkey, pulled pork, and brisket. When I seen him pull the meat out of the oven it was Saran wrapped. that's not how you do BBQ back home. The brisket was soggy, the turkey I couldnt even taste the smoke flavor. The proportion size was so small for the price I paid.... very unhappy I will never return the Dickey's. I will stick to good barbecue Porkopolis Arizona."}
{"text":"\"This guys order is going to be a $100\" said the previously unhelpful guy rushing us as we order at the dirty cafeteria version of a Dickey's. He was too busy and disinterested in answering my questions before I started ordering, but apparently he finds it amusing to tell me now that it would have been much smarter to order the family platter or something.  Unfortunately, the only time I saw my family smiling during this meal, was when they were laughing at my choice of restaurant.  There surely won't be a next time, perhaps not even at the real Dickey's version of the restaurant. What's with the wall around the area you order? you can't see anything you are thinking about buying until you get around to the hole in the wall they pass the food through and take money. I can't imagine trying to order if you were short or in a wheel chair. We heard a fire alarm go off when something must have been way overcooked.  I've been to a great Dickey's before, where we didn't remember the green beans being so watery, the ribs being so smokey, the potatoes so peppery, but certainly I do remember that the staff and the venue make a huge difference.  Welcome to dirty Vegas."}
{"text":"One of my favorites !! Everything I have had is amazing and everyone who works there goes beyond to be nice . Okra , cheddar sausage , creamed spinach and potato casserole are all delicious :)"}
{"text":"First time here !!  The guys were great and got me into a brisket Mac situation that was unbelievable !! For me that was the best Mac and cheese I've had a BBQ spot and the brisket was perfect !!  I'll be back !! Oh if it helps ya kids eat free sundays and all the fee ice cream you can handle !!"}
{"text":"Outstanding BBQ! I was there Friday and took a westerner sandwich home with pork & beef brisket, waffle fries & coleslaw. everything was delicious, the BBQ was tender & juicy and flavorful, coleslaw was creamy & didn't need any seasoning and the waffle fries were great.   I went back today & got the Monday special, $8.99 drink, pulled pork sandwich & two sides. All delicious! The spicy BBQ sauce is tangy & spiced just right!  I'll be back for sure considering it's right next to my tattoo shop"}
{"text":"Good food that I would recommend.  The parking is a bit on the difficult side of things but the free ice cream they offer more than makes up for that small issue."}
{"text":"The service here is the slowest I have seen.. They seem to be more interested in chatting and joking with each other than serving the customers.  We waited in in line for over 15 mins while one person helped one guest slowly at a time despite there being at least 4 employees behind the counter.. We walked out and probably won't be choosing this place as a lunch option going forward."}
{"text":"Not only is this the first time I have rated anywhere with only one star, but it is also the only time I have given a place a rating without eating there. It was lunch time and there was no line. My family walked up to the counter and looked at the menu. The first employee to greet us was friendly and awaited our order. He walked away and another employee replaced him. This employee (we'll call him employee #2) made it seem like we were inconveniencing them because we didn't order immediately. We started to order, then a female employee directed us to walk around the corner to look at the list of sides. That was weird because the choices were on the overhead menu. Then employee #2 yelled at us, telling us he needed all the meat choices first before we went around the corner. How rude! Sorry, we missed the \"How to order at Dickey's BBQ\" class. Then when we began to tell him what meats we wanted, he wasn't listening! He had a condescending attitude. After another annoying minute of this, my wife and I looked at each other and walked out. Why would any customer subject themselves to this kind of abuse? This is America and there are a lot of restaurants to choose from. Who do they think they are, Amy's Bakery?"}
{"text":"Ate there for the first time last week. Pulled pork was fantastic. Best I can ever remember having. Slow-cooked, melts-in-your-mouth goodness. So good I went back the following day. Was still just as delicious. Why have I never stopped there before?"}
{"text":"Wow what an excellent place with excellent food and excellent service  thanks to all that waited on us our first time in and it was just great apron 700pm"}
{"text":"Hubby and I decided to try after getting a coupon in the mail. The minute we walked in the guy told us they had no chicken, beef or turkey. It was only 6 pm. The lady that checked us out was rude not only to us, but other patrons. The staff was not friendly in general... It was just an uncomfortable dining experience and we won't be returning. Oh and the food is just mediocre... Nothing special."}
{"text":"Im giving 4 stars because the owner and staff were awesome when it came to customer service. The food though was 2 stars. Maybe it was an off day, not sure but I order a sandwhich and said I didn't want pickle or onions on it. It came with both, which was irritating. The fries tasted like nothing. I will go back because of the service and hopefully they get the food right."}
{"text":"2nd chance and FAILED again! I will never again come to this place!"}
{"text":"Being from East Mesa I am spoiled by Waldo's, so I hoped this place might be comparable. I was pretty disappointed. I tried their original and sweet BBQ sauces and they both tasted the same (and not very sweet at all). On top of that I found a thin piece of plastic wrap in my sandwich... I would return for the mac and cheese, free ice cream and friendly service, but not much else."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! It's obvious they take pride in their food. Customer service is outstanding! They are sure to \"treat you right\", as They say. Family owned location that truly shows what a family owned small business should be all about. Juiciest BBQ chicken I have ever had and that's just the beginning of their list of slow cooked, melt in your mouth meats!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by my visit here. The food was good overall, and the prices are reasonable. I had the brisket and pulled pork, both were juicy and tender, but the smoky bbq flavor wasn't as strong as I would like (I really miss Buzz in this regard, their meats were the best). The sides are delicious as well.  And they serve Dr Pepper, the lack of which is one of my top restaurant pet peeves. Certainly worth a return visit or two"}
{"text":"Great place, they offer pork, beef brisket, chicken, kielbasa, ribs & turkey. Three sauces - I tried the regular & honey, which were quite good (didn't try the spicy. Very friendly, great service. Brisket was a bit dry, but decent flavor."}
{"text":"Love this place bbq its always good. Nice to be able to get some good bbq quick and easy just like texas. My dautgher and I love having a daddy daughter day and hitting dickeys. Free Ice cream ROCKS."}
{"text":"Worst barbecue ever! Dry sausage, and brisket looks like dog food.  Over priced for sure."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. The staff, John in particular, was very charismatic and welcoming. This place is a barbecue pit so don't expect gourmet, but it's still really good barbecue. I will definitely be back. The staff's enthusiasm made me like this place even more! I will be back for the food and good vibes of the staff. -Dillon"}
{"text":"The Monday Special is a great deal - pulled pork sandwich with 2 sides and a huge drink for a little over $9 is a damn good deal. The pulled pork was fantastic with the original sauce, and upon recommendation adding the coleslaw on top made it even better. Really like the 3 different sauces available at the condiment station. The hot and spicy rules- just hot enough but not overwhelming.   It's very rare that I like some place enough to WANT to get more food. I waited a bit and decided to get a quarter plate. Beef brisket (awesome), Mac and cheese again (this is a must), green bean and bacon (good), and the cornbread. Do not make the mistake of not getting the cornbread...it was fucking awesome. Free vanilla soft serve is a nice touch after you eat.   The smoky atmosphere is awesome and inviting.  I especially like hearing the plethora of outlaw country playing in the dining room. The new-age country, not so much.    As of late, been coming here every week for month straight and have yet to be disappointed. All items recommended are outstanding.The ribs are excellent. And i find myself alternating between the Polish sausage and the brisket. The Mac and cheese still rules. The baked potato is ridiculous- so much to process but worth every bite. Every time I finish eating I want to lay down in the booth and sleep."}
{"text":"Love it great tasting food and excellent customer service. Kids eat free on Sundays!"}
{"text":"I was so excited  to try Texas Barbecue in Middleton Wisconsin.l opted for Dickeys.  MY mom ordered  the plate of sliced brisket.   It was about six square chunks of dried out meat. It was lukewarm and macaroni and cheese was not hot.  I ordered the spareribs that was pink.  The onion straws and ribs  were not hot at all.  The fried okra was steaming and delicious.  The pulled pork was dry and warm.  Food should be steaming.  I had ordered one kids meal.  The chicken tenders were definitely frozen ,not cool at all.  The waffle fries were cold.   The ice cream and assorted barbecue  sauces were good.  I wasted a lot of money.   I could have barbecued and had a very good meal.  Dickeys  needs to stop reheating small portions of dried out meat."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork. The pork was nice and moist. Also had the coleslaw and some Mac & Cheese. Everything was fresh and delicious. The service was fast and friendly. My only complaint is that the BBQ sauce / condiment bar is pretty small. Only fits one person at a time. This is only a mild inconvenience."}
{"text":"This place is great! Great service, very clean and food is awesome! What a great value! Kids eat for free on Sunday and they have free ice cream cones all the time. I had them cater a party about a year ago and have been back at least a dozen times since then. Delicious barbecue at a great price! Very casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time here and we each had the \"Fancy pork sandwiches\". Excellent taste and 3 BBQ sauces to choose from. Then I tried \"the racetrack\" brisket and pork. So good. We'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place.  He says the beef brisket is the best he has had.  I love the spicy sausage.  The fried sides are way too salty but the meat is so good I don't care."}
{"text":"I had the meat plate brisket with waffle fries and a Caesar salad. Brisket it was soft and tender. I think the salad was good but the waffle fries could be a little crispier. my boyfriend had The Saturdays special chopped beef.  Which was the deal for $10 you got two sides and a drink. If you like spicy try to the spicy barbecue sauce"}
{"text":"Great food! Love the pulled pork. Good casual atmosphere and the restaurant was very clean. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I have ordered three times for delivery using grub hub. I have yet to have a positive experience. I am done with this place. First order they cancelled after 30 minutes because they didn't feel like doing the order. Second time grub hub never got notice that it was ready for pickup so it sat there for an hour and turned to mush. The last order of ribs turned into a pulled pork sandwich some how. This place doesn't care about what hey serve to customers. Terrible."}
{"text":"Hot links were not hot and texture was \"mushy\". The pork ribs were large and had plenty of meat. The side dishes were good. If you buy a combo with 2 meats and a drink, it will cost you over $13. For that, you can eat at Memphis BBQ or Lucille's BBQ. Also, what's the deal with the plastic \"souvenir\" cup? That may have been souvenir material 30 years ago, but we are over the marvel of plastic cups now."}
{"text":"I have been there 3 times only once I had freshly cooked ribs the other 2 times was horrible just like tv dinner heated in a microwave . The food is overrated and definitely  very over priced for what you get. They try to hit you over $10 minimum no matter how small you want your portion to be.  I do not recommend this restaurant at all as you never know what to expect after you pay and they do not believe in refund if you are not happy with your food."}
{"text":"I went in today and everyone was so nice and with a great attitude. Ive been here before and never had any issues, but today it was just great! Makes a difference when you see the workers in a good mood."}
{"text":"This food is bomb!!! I love their fries and most of their barbecue is pretty amazing. Four stars only because the pork on my last sandwich was good but it was a little meh, usually on point but I don't know what happened that day :'("}
{"text":"Dissapointed  the portion sizes were small  and not worth the prices posted.   I had the smoked sausage.  sliced very thin they were dry. and came unsauced.  .  the sides came in small  6 or 8 ounce portion control  cups.   the  line cook reahed into a hot box  and placed a very dry tough  roll on the platter .  when I paid with cash. the same line cook took my money with his serving gloves on  handling money. did not change his gloves and proceeded to help the next guest.  with the same gloves on,  and he did not wash his hands    this is a food saftey violation   I have been a chef for over 35 years and understand portion control.  food cost and profit  however I also understand. that if my guests leave unsatisfied dissapointed and hungry.  they will not return.  there is a balance. perhaps it explained why Dickies  BBQ on Cactus rd Phoenix. had no one  there at 5:30 pm on a Saturday   Needless to say I wont. be back"}
{"text":"Oh Dickie's!  How I love you!  My family eats here often and it's so great. Take-out or eat-in doesn't matter, both are generous portions, superb staff and obv AMAZING BBQ."}
{"text":"Amazing experience at Dickey's BBQ today!  We came in here for the first time since it's opening and the customer service from the second we walked through the door was outstanding!!   The food was so good!   We will definitely be coming back here!!   Thanks for going the extra mile to be extra kind to the kids and make them feel welcome in your restaurant!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff when we walked through the door, we felt welcome straight away. For international visitors who are not familiar with the chain we thought the food was well priced and tasty - definitely a place for meat lovers! Nice decor too."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff who made us feel welcome from the start. Tasty food at good prices. Definitely a meat lovers feast!"}
{"text":"We ordered take out from Dickey's this weekend.  I know the reviews weren't great but we have been desperate for BBQ so we thought we would get a variety of items - they couldn't all be bad, right?  I had the two meat platter, sliced brisket and cheddar sausage, cole slaw and waffle fries.  Just ok portion which worked out well since I didn't feel as guilty tossing it into the garbage.  Brisket was fatty and bland, the sausage - I'm not ready to discuss it yet, I'll update the review if I ever get the stomach to speak about it again.  Cole slaw had a nice taste but there was so much liquid in the container it looked like soup, waffle fries were pretty good.  Roll was soft and pale so I didn't bother and I was so grossed out after trying the meats stuffing dry squishy bread down my throat didn't seem to be a good idea.  Husband had the ribs and gave them a \"just ok\".  I gave it two stars because my sides were ok though I may never eat brisket again and I will burn rubber out of the parking lot of any restaurant that I ever see list cheddar sausage on their menu.  One thing for sure, I won't be eating at Dickey's again."}
{"text":"This place has the most tender meat in town. The chef's, NOAH in particular are extremely hospitable and all around friendly!! Make this place your only stop for BBQ. They make you feel like you're family!!"}
{"text":"Went to Dickeys a couple of days ago, never been before. I did make a mistake though, I didn't check Yelp before, won't make that mistake again. To sum it up, WON'T RETURN EVER. It isn't the worst BBQ I've ever had, but it ranks at the bottom. As I have said before I am Texan and know BBQ, this is NOT it. The brisket had NO bark, no smoke ring and was burnt on the edges to the extent of being chewy.  I think they kept it in water or something because it was juicy, too juicy to be just cooked. As for the ribs, again no bark, and very little flavor. They must just put them in the cooker, not sure if it is a smoker, no smoke taste, with no rub, no salt, no nothing. The \"sausage\" was flavorless, and bland. I added some of their original BBQ sauce expecting a little zing, got tomato and more bland. Their \"sweet\" sauce tasted burnt and had a strange and unpleasant aftertaste. As for the sides, bbq beans, cole slaw and potato salad. Beans were ok, no significant flavors. Cole slaw bland, no flavor, tasted like cabbage with mayo. Same with potato salad, potatoes with mayo. Even the sweet tea was bland. I will continue my pursuit of bbq in Vegas having marked Dickeys off the list. Rolling Smoke and Famous Daves are still favorites."}
{"text":"Not impressed. It seems like a new location, so I'll cut them a little slack. Our food was good, but got the impression it wasn't too fresh as they kept pulling meat wrapped in plastic out of a warmer. The 4 employees seemed overly busy/disorganized despite there only being about 12 total customers.  The floor was very slimy and my feet kept sliding everywhere!  Not sure if it was grease from the cooking or what, but it was annoying. The place has a lot of room for improvement before I'd go back."}
{"text":"We were first timers to the resturant and were highly disappointed. The manager, Cindy  disregarded us standing in line. She continued on to offer the gentleman behind us samples without any consideration for us. Her response was, she thought we were together(with a nasty attitude and tone).When we were redirected by the cashier to order our meal,we told Cindy we wanted the XL family meal which included 3lb of meat. Cindy said a bad attitude, she didn't have enough to feed us, and that she didn't have 3 lbs of anything. Its Friday night, we have a family of 6, and you all don't have enough to accommodate our order. The lack of customer service and the neglect to come to a resolution, is very upsetting. We came to this restaurant to celebrate our sons 12th birthday, and we politely decided to take our business else where. We just hope the family behind us in line was able to be provided a better customer experience with his family. You only have 1 chance to make a 1st impression."}
{"text":"So.  Much.  Food. I got the 2 meat plate with green beans, mac and cheese and a cornbread. That was a heck of a lot of food. It was expensive, $30 for lunch for 2 people. But I won't need to eat for the rest of the day. It was very good and we will probably be back."}
{"text":"Went there yesterday for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. It was around noon and the place was half filled with diners and very clean. My husband and I were greeted with a big hello and smile. When we informed them it was our first time.. He went to go get us some samples. We tried some delicious brisket ( top part a little fatty and very juicy bottom part much leaner but still juicy. We also sampled the spicy cheddar sausage.. It was okay not my favorite but my husband liked it. I decided on 2 meat combo with ribs and brisket( comes with choice of 2 sides and roll and onions and pickles. I chose Mac and cheese and fried okra. Mac and cheese was pretty good .. A little mushy but not bad. Okra was good .. Fried crisp and not greasy at all. My husband got the daily special which was pulled pork and sausage. He got fries and coleslaw for sides and enjoyed it all     I actually had leftovers on mine .. Didn't look like that much but the sides are large and was quite filling. All in all great value for the price and good customer service. Will be back for sure and possibly dine in next time so I can have some of the free soft serve ice cream they have!"}
{"text":"I can only sum it up in one word, GROSS!!! The meat was cold and didn't taste like barbecue at all, the beans are canned and the buns were cold and hard, good thing I had a groupon and it was pretty much free but will never go back! Also the \"manager was coughing and hacking away right next to our food, can I say GROSS again?"}
{"text":"For me, Dickies is the !  Dickies out shines Frashers BBQ and Angry Crab in everyway.  The food is consistently good, the restaurant is clean, and the staff is exceptionally well trained, friendly, and knowledgeable.  Dickies also offers a 10% military and retiree discount.  No BS, just good food in a warm environment."}
{"text":"Very good food. The tea is really good. The cornbread is awesome. I had the westerner with brisket and sausage. Amazing. The only thing I didn't like was the tall counter where you place your order. The person taking our order couldn't even see my husband who is in a wheelchair, and vice versa. That's really my only negative. Other than that the food, the service and the value are very good. I will go back."}
{"text":"Family owned. Good, friendly service. Tasty, flavourful bbq meat and bbq sauces. My only wish is that they had bigger pirtions. That's the only thing I was disappointed with. But, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place for some good fast BBQ the menu has everything from beef and pork ribs,beef brisket,pulled pork and all your traditional entrees and sides..The cashier was real helpful with the menu with me being a first timer..I ordered the beef brisket with a ceaser salad and some bbq beans it aslo came with a fresh warm roll and all my food was served fresh within mins and tasted AweSoMe!!.I had no complaints exept for why don't they have a DicKeYs around my area!..I will definitely be back when I'm out in VegaS again..untill we meet again DicKeYs!!!.."}
{"text":"Brisket is ok, ribs are excellent.  Service was great.  Lady working waited for me to drive down to pick food even though they were closing.  Great customer service and even gave me extra sauce.  Thanks"}
{"text":"I would give no stars if I could.  Got food poisoning and was sick for 2 days.  I know it was from here because it was the only meal I had - early lunch.  Do not eat here, not your typical Dickey's. Obviously the employees do not practice safe food handling."}
{"text":"the staff was not that friendly and the cashier had an attitude. when i was about to leave one of the staff coughing in her shirt and did not wash her hands. the brisket was dry and crumbly. my ribs were good except for one which was hard and dry. this rib made beef jerky look like filet mignon. sides were good except a little small. i will not be returning. I'll spend a few more dollars and get better bbq."}
{"text":"Service is outstanding each time I visit. The food has never disappointed. Solid choice for consistency."}
{"text":"Excellent bbq!! It's rare to find a place that doesn't drown the meat in sauce, so it's a treat to eat here. I can never get just 1 or 2 meats, so I tried the pulled pork, brisket, polish & ribs. Don't make me pick a favorite- they're all delish! Each was so juicy & flavorful that I didn't even touch the sauce. Service was quick & friendly too.  Thanks Dickeys!!"}
{"text":"Dicky's is good. We went on a Sunday and lucky us, kids eat free on Sunday! The lady had the Rib Plate. 5 St Louis style ribs plus two sides and a sweet tea. The ribs are nice and tender with a mild smokey flavor. The Mac n cheese is terrible. Mushy pasta with what tastes like canned cheese sauce. The bbq beans are good.  I had the 3 meat plate. Pulled pork, chopped brisket and spicey cheddar smoked sausage. The sausage was great but I prefer a more pronounced smoke flavor on brisket and pulled pork. My sides were the onion tanglers(fried onions), delicious and the Mac n cheese :( They offer 3 bby sauces. Regular, sweet, and spicey. Tasty. The sweet tea is particularly good. There's also a soft serve vanilla ice cream machine which is always a nice way to finish a meal.  All in all, Dicky's is decent bbq at a good price.  I would give it 3.5."}
{"text":"Came here with a work friend for the first time.  The setting is very nice; Texas-country-style with wood walls, corrugated aluminum trim, and black & white snapshots of a country fair.  You can tell they recently sank some money into the d√©cor.  It even has an outside seating area with powerful misters all along the edge.  There was about a 12-min wait, but to be fair there were 3-4 people ahead of us.  The prices are fantastic; for only $10 I got a combo plate with drink, two sides, a roll, and two types of meat (spicy cheddar sausage, and pulled pork), with ample portions (they weigh it as they serve).  It tasted great.  They have three BBQ sauces (original, spicy, sweet), and free soft-serve ice cream cones for dessert.  I also tried the peach cobbler which is perfect.  Their sweet tea tastes authentic and good.  It was clean inside with little plastic table-cloths.  Overall a very positive experience; I will be back and will bring friends and family!"}
{"text":"pretty decent flavor and fresh ingredients.   A good neighborhood restaurant."}
{"text":"Darn good bar-b-Q!  Tastes like Texas I should know!  Loved in Houston for 15 years and meat is awesome!"}
{"text":"This is a great fast food barbecue pit. They have servings ranging from individual to the pound. The prices are very affordable and appealing. The barbecue sauces are the most important when it comes to quality. The sauce makes the dish in my opinion and Dickies definitely delivers when it comes to taste. They have original and spicy sauces. The pulled pork and brisket are the best meats, both tender and moist. The only down fall is the choice of sides. The Mac and cheese is very bland, the beans are watery. They do earn points with the complimentary soft serve ice cream with mini cones.  Over all this restaurant is definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Wow! Ordered some ribs and sliced brisket along with a side of fried okra on Saturday evening...to go! Three words: De-lic-ious!!! Unreal! As a BBQ guy, I'm pretty hard on restaurant BBQ and Dickey's hit the mark!! Really good, rubbed, cooked with care meats! Thanks Dickey!"}
{"text":"My only experience with Barbecue was in the south so I knew that my expectations were high when I entered Dickey's for the first time. I assumed that this northern chain had nothing on the pulled pork of Nashville, but I was totally blown away! Not only was my pulled pork delicious (amazing sauce!) but the sides were awesome too! I had trouble deciding but luckily my friends and I decided to split a bunch of stuff on the menu. The potato salad was amazing and the coleslaw, totally deserving of the adjective creamy! The environment is fun and friendly kind of a family vibe. I don't live in Ohio but next time I come back, I will definitely swing by this place again!"}
{"text":"The food was good, service was not.  I am hoping it was an OFF day.  We were there at 7:30 PM on a Thursday.   Had to ask for three separate items that were empty in the condiment area.  How does a BBQ place run out if BBQ sauce when there are 2 customers in the whole place?  Maybe they had a rush but by this time it should all be stocked.  They seemed less than thrilled that I asked for these items.  I normally love Dickey's at other locations.   I hope this place gets better since it's now our nearest location!  They just didnt seem interested in helping anyone."}
{"text":"Very glad I tried this place. I ordered a one-meat plate with baked potato casserole (essentially mashed potatoes) and jalape√±o beans. It was delicious. I love that they have three different BBQ sauces - sweet, spicy, and original. They also have jalape√±os, onions, and pickles. And, especially awesome - there is free soft serve ice cream! The service was great and they were playing country music inside. We would definitely come back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pulled pork sandwiches and sauces. It's cool that you can drive thru and the staff is very friendly.   Be careful if you look at there online menu. Everything with the star that says \"may not be available at all locations\", probably won't be at this location."}
{"text":"As you can see in my reviews I really enjoy BBQ. We decided to stop in and try it. Had the Brisket. It was Amazing. Also tried the 3 Rib plate. Ribs had a lot of meat on them and you could really taste the smoke. This location smokes the meat right on site. Tasted so fresh. Then to top it off. Ummm ya, free ice cream. Lol give this place a try. Did I mention free ice cream. Lol   Wife had the Turkey. I tried it and could taste the smoke in it. I ended eating the rest of hers also. Ahahaha"}
{"text":"Just tried it here and got the triple meat plate and got brisket, turkey, and ribs. My ribs were incredibly tough which means they cooked them to death. The ribs my dad got were much much better and way more tender. For some reason chain BBQ places have this problem because old Carolina has done it too. You have to keep your product consistent or risk losing customers who aren't willing to give second chances. The turkey was ok, nothing really special about it, same for the briskett. You can tell these places don't brine their meats. The sides were also just ok. The jalape√±o beans had no jalape√±os and my mac and cheese was definitely not homemade. Prices are a bit high too. All in all I'd rather spend my money on buying and smoking my own meats, which I do on a regular basis."}
{"text":"a chain BBQ that tasted like a chain.  College kids doing college-quality work.  Not worth seeking out, but OK if in a pinch for any type of BBQ with limited time"}
{"text":"First visit here rather impressed with the wide menu. Simple deal of the day  western sandwich , green beans , and okra. Very good and the cook and staff members very helpful with selections. Kids menu to boot. I will return to try something new off the menu."}
{"text":"Holy love of all Good.  This place. Upon entry. Nothing. Upon ordering from the man at the counter he reaches inside what I guess is the warmer and literally throws the chicken way over on a counter.  The taller white guy with dark hair was somewhat friendly. The one who cashed us out.  No sweet tea and didn't want to ask since the guys behind the counter were cursing about tips and it made me feel uncomfortable. The African American guy who was at the entry went and leaned up against the drink counter while drinking something then goes behind the food area and proceeds to pick his nose with a brown paper towel.  That's it. Won't be back. Shocked at the behavior. I'm In customer service and these 3 guys are a detriment to any business."}
{"text":"Lived in Texas 5 years. Dickey's takes me back to San Antone! True smoked brisket with great sides and service. Get you some of that!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because I love the idea of the restaurant concept.  Imagine actually finding delicious, fast barbecue?  Well, this isn't the place.  The meat was actually pretty good, but the portions were ridiculously small.  I spent $13 and was still totally hungry afterwards.  I got the \"beef brisket poorboy\" with 2 sides and a drink.   The poorboy was about the size of a hotdog in a bun.  However, I thought The bbq sauce was good and you get free soft serve ice cream cones if you want."}
{"text":"The food is the same but there are other issues with the new operation. First, I noticed the store abandoned the Big Yellow Cups and now use styrofoam. This started months ago. Now, the store changed its pricing in a way that jacked up prices for combos because you have to buy meat and sides a la carte. My two meat combo was $4 more than it used to be. They also stopped selling turkey. We're not returning."}
{"text":"Well, another disappointing experience. I had been here once before and service was horrible! I thought I would give them another chance and request a quote for a party I am having; four days later and no response.  Dickey's you have finally proven you are trying to live on the name alone, not on the customer experience. Went down the street to Joe's BBQ, which IMO is better anyway, just wasn't as convenient. I will be inconvenienced in order to get GREAT customer service and better BBQ."}
{"text":"I got their pulled pork sandwich. It was pretty good. I had their pulled pork with a plate of meat at another location and it was the best meat of all of them. The bread was nice and soft and a bit toasted around the edges. The barbecue sauce they gave me was good. The macaroni was OK. I've had better. My only problem with them is that the person at the front completely ignored me, so I thought I was in the wrong place to order. I soon figured out it was the right place, but she kept ignoring me while just chopping meat. The other workers didn't seem to like their jobs. I don't think I would return to this location."}
{"text":"Dickeys OK. The pulled pork was good. The brisket was too dry. I did like the sides of creamed spinach and macaroni and cheese. At least the mac & cheese wasn't dried out like at other barbecue places. The guy who took my order wasn't too friendly and seemed in patient. I liked their free soft serve ice cream by the drinks. That was a nice thing to offer. I didn't like how they quickly took away my food when I went to the bathroom. I actually covered it with a napkin because of a fly, but they should make sure the customer hasn't left. It's a small place!"}
{"text":"This is not the same quality as the one in Mesa. The food was on the bottom edge of warm, for best results I recommend taking it to subway to be toasted as they also use square (2 triangles) of sliced cheese. Cheese should be somewhat melted when placed on top of the chicken in a chicken taco. Overall the staff is super nice and very friendly and the food has potential but the warming methods need to change. Oh and the BBQ sauces are good but way to hot, the small plastic cup was to hot to carry to the table and started to loose its rigidity. I hope things get better as I always try to support businesses in surprise."}
{"text":"The 'poor' rating is not for the BBQ.  My wife and I have been there several times for lunch but this time we had trouble finding our 'go to' on the menu (wall board).  We asked and were told a way around what we wanted.  They have tasty onion rings but they weren't listed.  My wife ordered baked beans..... Luke warm.... almost room temp.  Slaw is rather bland. For lunch there was no way to get out for less than $22 for a couple.  Not worthy of being considered $ (low) cost.   Again, the BBQ was good, but cold beans and overpricing just doesn't draw us back.   While we were there (11:45 am) we were the only patrons.  So, this place probably wont make it.   So..... probably not do-over here."}
{"text":"I love that Dickey's delivers. Can't go wrong with some quick bbq from here when hungry"}
{"text":"I drove past the store while looking for another business and I was surprised since I'd never seen this BBQ restaurant there before. I told my husband, and a couple of days later I went there to get us some take-out. Suffice it to say, I've been there about 4 days out of 6 this past week, getting us food. Both my husband and I are disabled and he is on a high protein diet, so this place is perfect! The food is tasty, the meat is tender, and we both love the fact that they don't put the BBQ sauce on the meat, but rather allow the customer to apply the sauce to their taste. The 3-meat plate is great and more than enough for one person. We love having left-overs for the following day. Yesterday, we went there and actually had a meal with friends in the restaurant. It is clean and has a very nice atmosphere. The staff is friendly and helpful and we just love the place. The only reason for not giving it a 4 is: the first day I bought food there, the meat wasn't as hot (temperature) as I like it. (Then again, my husband says I like food scalding hot!) Also, I didn't care much for the bread at first, but when I heated it in the microwave at home, I found it's delicious! They should really warm it up before serving it. They should also have butter patties available so people can have as much butter as they want. One last piece of constructive criticism: have corn and a garden salad as side dishes. I love their waffle fries, potato salad, and potato casserole, btw. I think Dickey's is a wonderful addition to our local restaurant community. The prices are just right and the food is wonderful!"}
{"text":"I stop in and tell the meat cutter to tell me about the brisket. Do you separate it? Moist/fat and lean? Um..... Do you smoke whole briskets? Yes indeed. Do you separate the top/fat/moist from the bottom/lean? No, we just cut it.....reaches into a stainless steel bin to show me thick fatty slices. Ordered two meat plate - pulled pork, brisket, mac-n-cheese, potato salad. Pulled pork is dry and stringy. Brisket is tough, fatty and not very flavorful. Mac-n-cheese is cold. Potato salad is - meh, so-so. Sweet tea is good. Sauce is good. Free ice cream but didn't try it. Was with my son so 2 2-meat plates and drinks were $28+. Very disappointed. Old Carolina down the street is much, much better but once you've been to the real TX BBQ heartland (Lockhart) nothing really compares. Regardless, Dickey's will need a miracle to stay in business for more than a year. Sorry, you stink."}
{"text":"Three dollars plus for a soda?!? I don't think so! Cancelled my order and walked right out. I hope these gouging money grubbers go right out of business!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Every time we go our service is exceptional and the food is to die for! We love it!"}
{"text":"Ordered some food online from Dickies BBQ so that the food would be ready when I got there as I was crunched for time. When I got there I told them my order and he grabbed the receipt and then I noticed he started one of the appetizers I had ordered. The order stated it would be ready by 5:30, so I walked next door to the store, came back and he said I just put down the other appetizer so it will be ready shortly. Needless to say when the food was ready to go it was 20 minutes later. It would have been faster for me to order there and wait for my food. Because of this I sent an email to the office via their contact ue website page which I believe would be the headquarters. I never got a response, it appears to me that either they just read them and throw them out or don't read them at all, and I won't do business with people that don't respond to feedback. There are plenty of other barbecue places around here, so I will pass on this one."}
{"text":"The pulled pork was good and the rolls were very good. The brisket was ok. The Mac and cheese and coleslaw were fine. The servers were polite and up beat, which I appreciate. If I was in the area and hungry for lunch I would return but I probably wouldn't make a point to come here for lunch."}
{"text":"Ribs were black and overcooked, with old oily smell. Brisket was too dried... it was waste of 50$ for the ribs and brisket."}
{"text":"This place failed me in every aspect of a restaurant. First the food - I ordered the chopped BBQ beef sandwich which was horrible. The small chunks of meat were nothing but fat. The chunks that had any meat were hard as a rock and tasteless. I took it back to the cook and he refused to give me a new one after I explained the current sandwich he served me. I couldn't believe it. It was obvious that the employees hated working there and have no customer service skills at all. I sent an email to their main office but never heard back. I would never recommend this place to anyone. The food and service are just horrible."}
{"text":"On our visit they had only been open a few days.  I generally like to give a place a chance to work out the kinks, but we couldn't wait for Dickey's!    Being Texans, we love our beef BBQ and even though Dickey's is a chain, they know beef!  Everything we ordered was tasty - per the typical Dickey's experience.  I love the Smokehouse Salad. Kiddos love the free cone at the end:).   The owner was on site and very friendly.  I'm pulling for her success.  My only issue is that the space is very tight.  Very tight!"}
{"text":"This was the worst food poisoning I've ever had. Order 3 meat plate, Chicken,  ribs  & brisket,  sides were green beans and potatoes,  ate only a few bites of meats not impressed with any of it. Was over charged & ended up in bed for 2 days. Pork ribs not cooked brisket tasted like it was from a bag & chicken was from a bag . Stay away not sure how this place stays in business."}
{"text":"To go order: Bread on my pork sandwich was burnt. Turkey was dry. They forgot my cookies yet remembered to charge me for them."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong now, we enjoy the food at Dickey's. For franchised bbq it really is very good, and Dickey's has a wide selection of both meats and side dishes. But if you are going to eat at Dickey's do your self a favor and choose a different location. We've been to the Power Rd. location several times now and well, the people that work here are simply consistently rude.  Today it was the young man preparing the meats. He would not look up at us from behind the counter and when my wife asked if this was where we ordered, he said without looking up, \"I'll be right with you\". (It is a shame his tone can't be heard here.) He was snotty and we were bothering him. I get it, everyone has a bad day. But this location is ALWAYS having a bad day.   The food is still good, so if you go be ready for rude."}
{"text":"Dickeys has always had awesome food. The BBQ is always tasty and this location is my favorite out of all of them in Arizona. They have an upgraded soda machine as a plus. The staff were awesome! The rewards program is great. Can't say enough good things about it."}
{"text":"Good menu, great BBQ. Had the pulled pork sandwich which was moist & super tasty. Really like the wall art & music."}
{"text":"Dickey's is normally really good. Food at this location is OK, service it not good. Very poorly run and not very clean."}
{"text":"This will be my final visit to this \"dry good's\" / BBQ joint. The ribs were dried out and flavorless. Not even the container of bbq catsup could save it. And they were cold.   I think someone ate the ribs before I got 'em because there was not much in the way of meat on the bones, the rolls tasted like they long should have been tossed out.    I don't know what happened to Dickey's. They used to be very good a few years back. But based on the quality of their ribs, clearly the cooks have left the building as no one there has a clue about food.    I guess I should have clued in when the guy cutting the ribs, kept tossing racks to the side and grabbing other Saran wrapped sets of ribs from this big steel rib box. He settled on what he thought was the best worth serving.. NOT!!   Next time and every time, its Famous Dave's."}
{"text":"Food is decent and inexpensive so we attempted our third (failed) online order tonight. Showed up for pickup and they appeared to have no clue what we ordered, eventually they found it and had to wait an additional 10 minutes per usual. When checking the food at home we found a missing item. When calling to ask for a refund on the item that had been paid for but not provided I was \"put on hold\" by a young lady (who is obviously not worthy enough to be called lady) who yelled \"you guys f***ed up their order and now I've got this b**ch on the phone\". So, if you want decent food, with terrible customer service, confused staff, and to be called a b**ch, this is your place.     Still awaiting my vouchers for the food I paid for but didn't get.... lol, not surprised. The place is run by rude children."}
{"text":"Really looked forward to the ribs !!!!! Was told they were out of ribs !!!!! I left ! Sorry we couldn't enjoy this place it's just kinda bad business to be a BBQ Place and be out  Bummer !"}
{"text":"The location:  As stated numerous times, it's a bit cramped.  I'd recommend the owners look at Pineville or Matthews for a larger space for the same money, when the lease is up.  The food:  The food is OK.  My wife like's the brisket, but there is a little more fat in that than I care for.  The pulled pork was excellent, however.  Good selection of sides, and there was plenty to eat.  If you like soft serve ice cream, the provide that desert, free of charge, which is a nice touch.  Overall, not bad from a restaurant chain.  The prices:  As you would expect in this area, you pay a little more, for a little less.  That's the Ballantyne way.  The service:  My wife and I have only been there twice, but my son is a regular with his workplace around the corner.  In comparing notes, it appears that we have came to the exact same conclusion.  When the female owner / manager is present, the staff is up to par, execution is good and service is quick and friendly.  When she's not, like this past Sunday, it falls apart.  Not friendly, not appreciative for our business.  You could say rude would be the better word.  Yes, I realize it's near the holidays, but I want to be treated like my $40 order mattered, OK?  BTW, I was the only patron in the restaurant at the time, so it's not as if they were busy.  I was just interrupting their day.  Bottom line:  I'll give them one, more shot, at getting it right, otherwise I can get better barbecue much closer to my home from Rock Store BBQ."}
{"text":"This place is not good at all! The staff is irritated they have to work! Ain't even average BBQ! It's McDonald's style BBQ turn and burn, microwaved sides. Want real BBQ go to John Mulls road kill BBQ it will change your life! Dickies go away!"}
{"text":"I stop by after work to pick up dinner  At 5:30 there was no one there and 3 employees awaiting my order, at first it seemed friendly service but as soon as I asked a question the guy turned his head down and his finger up pointing at the menu above, what a turn off like it would take a lot out of him to answer : what are my choices for sides. Then my order was ready and I asked the cashier that had a face like If she was scared, is everything in here I asked her she replied yes before I even finished my sentence, I asked again  Pickles ? Onions? She said yes, I get home and the pickles and onions were missing,  And the food was cold, I had better experiences at the Scottsdale location"}
{"text":"It's pretty decent BBQ. I liked the brisket sandwich. The meat was juicy and tender. The sides are average, beans were bland. The service is friendly and fast and the place is nice and clean. Prices are good."}
{"text":"Walk-In:  The smell alone took me right back to my childhood in Atlanta going to amazing pit bbqs with my family.  If your clothes don't smell afterwards, they aren't doing it right.  I've been to the Dickey's at Scottsdale/Shea and the food was good but I wasn't blown away, and the service was kinda brain dead.  This new Dickey's at Hayden/Thomas is way better.    Entrees:  I usually get pulled pork or beef brisket sandwich(both great), but went for the chicken breast this time, everything is always good here.  If you are confused about ordering (as a previous reviewer was) think of it like Chipotle: you pick a meat and pick how you want it served, pretty basic, and the employees were more than helpful and friendly (at this location).  Can't wait to try the ham and sausage too.  Sides:  I was excited to try the 'Baked Potato Salad' side, but it was just a cup of instant mashed potatoes with melted cheese and chives on top : /   Mac & cheese is always good, fried okra is a nice southern touch, green beans are super watery and flavorless, waffle fries were better than the onion rings, i just wish they offered hush puppies, that would rule!  Extras:  Like most places, it's the little things that make a big difference.  Kids eat free on Sundays, they offer free jumbo pickles, free soft-serve vanilla ice cream, free refills (get the big yellow cup!) and they offer their sauces on the side, which is great because there's nothing worse than getting a soggy, drowning bbq sandwich, or a dry, bland one with barely any sauce.  I highly recommend the spicy bbq sauce, i like to mix it with the sweet sauce, so good.    Check Please:  Sure, Dickey's isn't as cheap as the Sonic drive-thru next door, but it's fairly priced for much better quality.  This location is a lot smaller, but offers booths, tables and 2 flatscreen tv's, there were several families there, take-out was quick, service was great, I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We ordered dinner using Uber eats and were called twice to change sides for the meal. The meal shows up and the meats we chose didn't come correctly and the extras we paid for didn't come either. We called back to the same girl who asked to changed the sides and I asked to get the appropriate food, she told me she would get the right food going. I will say it may be an honest miscommunication that they were not going to send the food out for delivery again, but when I called to check on the status an hour later, Trevor \"with a capitol T\", as he describes himself chose to be completely rude. I was obviously frustrated that we were not told specifically that they would not deliver the messed up food and I would have to drive to go get it and said the F word. Trevor took it upon himself to tell me how much of a gold star he is and that I am the bad person because I said they \"f'ed up our order\". Terrible service on Trevor's part and if he is telling the truth and Denise is his district manager you should reconsider his position.   Never ordering there again."}
{"text":"The food is good. The problem is GREED. I used to go here a few times a month specifically for the cobblers. You can get good BBQ anywhere. But, the cobbler here is fantastic. It was $2.95 for a small cup like  container.  Then suddenly I noticed the servers no longer filled up the cup. They were putting 1 small ice cream size scoop, yet the price was not lowered.  When I questioned it a few of the servers said the 1 scoop was per the manager and if they were caught filling the cup (a very fair portion) the manager took it out of their tips!  Needless to say Dickeys  has lost my business and I haven't been back since. Another example of GREED at the expense of the customer."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! Wayyyy better than Famous Daves, and cheaper too! It's too bad more people don't know about this location, as it's never crowded, even on the weekends... My GF and I got a 3 meat plate, which came with 2 sides and a roll, and then we added a 'baker', which is a baked potato stuffed with cheese, and a bit of pulled pork. Total bill was like $23 with drinks, which we thought was very reasonable for two people.... And the portions were more than big enough for us! We were stuffed!  Give this place a try, it's good stuff!"}
{"text":"I absolutely feel in love with this place had great ribs, and free ice cream where can young I wrong"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Dickey's in a while, but was craving some good BBQ.  I love their brisket!  Last night I got their 2 meat plate of just sliced brisket, BBQ beans, waffle cut fries and roll to go. They offer free ice cream, so while I waited for my food, I thought I'd have a cone.  Well, they were out of cones!  I'm a problem solver, so I put some in a water cup and grabbed a spoon.  It was average at best!  The ice cream is gritty with very little flavor.  I know, how is that possible, but they somehow did it! Onto my meal!  It smelled so good!  I had grabbed some of their original and spicy BBQ sauce.  When I opened my brisket, I realized that I usually like getting the chopped brisket, but was so glad I didn't this time.  At least a third to a half of my portion was fat!  It was disgusting!!  What a waste!!  I had 4 half inch thick slabs of brisket.  Usually it comes thinly sliced.  I was really disappointed and this meal wasn't cheap!  It seems they've also changed their beans since I was last their.  Usually theirs little bits of meat in it, but nope, just plain beans.  The flavor was still good, but I like the texture and bit of extra meat I usually get.  The waffle fries were really good and crisp.  It may get be awhile before I go back or at least I'll check my meat before I leave next time!!"}
{"text":"Growing up in Dallas behind one of the original Dickey's BBQ pits, I was pleasantly surprised to find them here in Mesa! I've gotten to know the staff and owner and it feels like home every time we go in. My husband and I switch up our orders each time. They have a daily special that always hits the spot when we can't make up our minds. The big yellow cups are refillable, the tea is great and the BBQ sauces are scrumptious, especially when you follow it with some free soft serve ice cream! Y'all enjoy!"}
{"text":"I like to add places that I like to my FB account so that I can keep up with sales, announcements etc. When this Dickey's location opened my husband and I drove over to check it out (we live closer to the Mesa location.) Not only was the food delicious but the staff was attentive and friendly. A couple of weeks after the opening, I noticed something from Dickey's in Chandler on my FB page. It was a contest! All we had to do was like the picture and we were eligible to win a free meal for 4. I WON!! We picked up our free Chicknic Pack which included a delicious whole chicken, 2 large sides (we chose the green beans and baked potato casserole!) several hot,  buttered rolls and their signature pickles and onions. And the original BBQ sauce is beyond good! There was easily enough for my husband and I to have almost 3 meals! Thank you, Dickey's!"}
{"text":"Small restaurant in a strip mall.  We enjoyed our meal here last night.  The food was hot and fresh, the meats smoky and tender and the staff is friendlyand helpful.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The barbecue is great the service is fantastic I really enjoy going here the guys here go out of their way to help you"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and if you want fast service,  in a hurry for lunch, here is your place, they have lots of specials. The service is quick,  and staff very friendly,   I got the Monday special bbq, pulled pork sandwich,  came with 3 sides,  u can chose from beans to Mac and cheese,  I can't remember all but try them,  I bet delicious,  I ordered Cole slaw and mac cheese,  yep , yummy. Included a super size drink, how can you not try the southern sweet tea. Total cost $9.95.  Lovely little restaurant,  red and white table cloths, and very clean.  Will surely be returning for ore specials. ."}
{"text":"Part day care and part exhibit for how not to run a restaurant.   Children running in and out of the kitchen  Long wait to place order... only one guy in front of us ordering his lunch what one would assume would be another disappointing meal  Paid for drinks and the drink machine was broken... we found out after we paid when we walked over to the machine  The cashier guy would have done better communicating through sign language as he would only talk at a whisper volume  Restaurant was extreme dirty yet three employee stood around and talked/ baby sat.  I feel like I need to take a bath in Clorox eating at this place  Parking up front was taken up by their delivery trucks.  Go to some where else... the Del taco next door is probably better and that's not saying much."}
{"text":"Food is solid and the free ice cream is great!  Also, kids eat free on Sundays! However, you can tell their order taker does not want to be there.  You     need to.   order.     like.      this.      or he will just ignore you and make you repeat your order over and over again.  Really bothered me. Might sound petty, but that's what I remember most from my latest and LAST trip to Dickey's. Was my fave BBQ joint too.."}
{"text":"This is my second time in and honestly I'm not even sure why I came back after my last experience. The first time I ordered food from here the meat was super dry so I just smothered it in the spicy bbq sauce (which was actually good!). This time the food was not even warm/lukewarm. Not sure if it is just this location or not because I had heard the food at Dickeys was good but it seems to me that there is a lack of attention or care here. Two thumbs down for me. Might try one of the other locations in the future :/"}
{"text":"Fair price, hubby and I shared the 3 meat platter with 2 sides, place is clean, staff is nice and free ice cream never hurts!!!  The ice is the good crushed kind you'll get at Sonic, next visit (probably Sunday) as kids eat free, I'm going to try one of their amazing looking stuffed potatoes!!  Oh and they do CATERING (box lunches, delivery buffet and full service)...."}
{"text":"Just went to Dickey's barbeque pit found it on yelp thought I'd give it a try food is pretty good somewhat of a fast food place but like I said the food was excellent and the service was good I will go back"}
{"text":"Food was great as always. Great meat and the BBQ sauce is yummy! I didn't have a side dish I didn't like. Everything has good flavor and needs no salt or pepper"}
{"text":"My wife and I had been wanting to try Dickey's for awhile now. So we thought today would be the day to give it a try. Online ordering is quick and efficient. I went to pickup my order and staff was friendly. A couple of issues with the food though. When I got home, I noticed we were given no bbq sauce with our order. The meat seemed a bit dry and flavorless. How to eat bbq without sauce or any noticeable rub on the meats? Luckily we had some Sweet Baby Ray's to wet the meat and give it some taste. For the portion sizes (we ordered the meat plate with sides), the meal was overpriced for what we got. Overall, average to o.k. but nothing I would return for anytime soon."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, first time visiting after lunch hours... BBQ is good, service usually good as well, but at night is a different story. Got to have a better  system... anything is better than S L O O W W W. Place is not that crowded and line is at a tortoise pace. Been here in line a real 20 mins., and will wait while food is being prepared.... GOT TO BE MORE CAREFUL! Hope this gets better, have high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"My wife discovered Dickies one afternoon while in Middleton. She encouraged me to join her for a quick dinner there a few weeks later. Chain or otherwise this is the best BBQ that I have had in Madison. I'll even go further and add \"by far\".  Great daily specials,and very reasonable prices.  Brisket is chopped and very good and so is the sausage. The sides are first rate and all portions are generous. The baked beans are excellent.The free ice cream is also a tasty treat to try after a very good meal.  Highly recommended. A new place that is perhaps one of the best kept secrets in Madison, a city with otherwise fine restaurants unless you are looking for good BBQ at a place other than at Dickies. :-)  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Its been over 2 months now since Dickeys Management asked for my contact info. Guess what?? NO contact since then.  2nd rule of good management: FOLLOW UP...perception is reality, so if the service is poor, then its not going to fix itself...."}
{"text":"WOW, I never knew what true BBQ tasted like til I had a Pulled-Pork, Shredded Beef BBQ Sandwich, it was so good, I couldn't wait til I got back home in Palm Springs to slap my momma, I still dream about that sandwich!!!"}
{"text":"Not bad for fast food BBQ. The brisket is yummy, but the turkey is a little rubbery. The beans, slaw and potatoes are good, but the fried items leave a lot to be desired. On my second visit, they were out of all but 2 meats by 7 pm! Pretty bad planning."}
{"text":"We have been looking for a good BBQ place in Vegas for a while and we believe we have found it. The brisket (chopped up) was excellent as was the pulled pork sandwich. The green beans with bacon is really good and the shoe string onion rings are too. Plus, kids eat free on Sundays and you get free ice cream! We'll be back."}
{"text":"The best BBQ I've found in Arizona! Growing up in a state famous for BBQ, I just haven't found a great restaurant. Look no further. The food was amazing and the customer service was great. They actually messed up our order and totally made it right. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I went here with  a friend a few weeks ago and loved the food! I got the brisket and the ribs with waffle fries and onion tanglers! I don't know why i got two types of fried sides, but they were all AMAZING! They have BBQ on the side and I tried the Spicy one which was delicious! They even have FREE pickles and soft serve! It was so much food, but after climbing I scarfed down most of it! :) Everything was just so good!! Even the small piece of bread! :) I will be coming back here again very soon!"}
{"text":"Just moved to AZ and was looking for my new favorite bbq restaurant. Tried Joe's out and was really disappointed. So I found Dickey's on Yelp and thought I would give it a try.  I tried the 3 meat plate: hot links, ribs, and ham. Got coleslaw and beans on the side. I liked everything on my plate especially the ribs. Also they have a selection of bbq sauces that you can help yourself to. The sweet one was deeeeelicous (if you like KC Masterpiece sauce you will love this one) and I also tried the spicy one which was great as well. The coleslaw was so good. Nice and creamy, not dry, and sweet. They also give you free soft serve ice cream! Wow! And the service was so great. It is not somewhere where you have a waiter. You order at the cashier, but they actually went out their way to bring it to the table, checked on us during our meal, and came by to clear our plates. They greeted us coming in and thanked us going out. I will DEFINATELY be back. I'm getting hungry just thinking about them! I recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"CAJUN TURKEY! If you didn't do this for Turkey Day, you missed out. 2 years in a row we got the Cajun Turkey and it did not disappoint. Dickey's is One of my favorites in town, the bbq is always on point with fantastic flavors, my go to is the pulled pork and brisket-chopped. The employees are always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great BBQ and friendly staff. I was able to talk with a couple of the staff and found out that this location prepares it's BBQ on site everyday. Most BBQ franchises bring it in from a different location and by the time the customer gets it, it's dry. I had the pulled pork and chopped brisket and both were moist. They also sell there owe seasoning, bbq sauce, and cook book. Oh yeah, there rolls are very soft and delicious."}
{"text":"Great place for quick and friendly BBQ. First off I would not recommend any chain restaurant to a 'die hard' BBQ fan. In a pinch, Dickeys offers juicy meats (I've tried the chicken, turkey and chopped brisket), excellent sides, and some tasty sauce options.   Perhaps the most authentic thing about this restaurant is the people who work here. They are extremely friendly and accommodating.   For what they are doing, fast food BBQ, Dickeys is top notch."}
{"text":"Food is eh. Had the ribs, they were grisly. Service was the biggest joke.  You stand in a confusing line where no one listens to you then you get to the register...your meat is ice cold and your hot sides aren't done.Not going back."}
{"text":"YUM! Was unsure about what to expect. What I got was a melt in your mouth, ridiculously tender brisket! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Seeking west side legit bbq.  We tried the chicken (smoked?) and beef brisket; I think it came with 1-2 sides and a roll. We for sure got mac n cheese which I look all over town for. This was such a disappointment; completely bland and weak, similar to school food. The chicken was kind of like that really thick cut lunch meat you can but at the grocery store. The beef was better but nothing to write home about. Luckily this one meal was enough to feed two adults. Staff was nice. Ordered at a counter and took it to go. I think I saw beer available, so there's that positive! Free ice cream available...We passed"}
{"text":"Not bad for a \"fast food\" barbecue fix...but it is what it is.  Meats are flavorful, but the ribs are a bit too fall-off-the-bone for me, I like to have to work at barbecue. Sides sampled were tasty (mac 'n cheese, green beans) but I've had their beans before and they are also good.  Certainly not a go-to BBQ place, but works in a pinch."}
{"text":"Good food. Had the brisket sandwich free ice cream"}
{"text":"The service was impeccable.  The cook made me a special plate exactly what I asked for. Which in my opinion the service was outstanding."}
{"text":"First time trying it and fell In love! Service was awesome too! We got pulled pork with ribs, beans, and potato salad. Beans where awesome loved that they had meat inside the beans. Potato salad was really good and didn't taste like straight mustard. Ribs I wasn't a huge fan of but the pulled pork was amazing! Why I really wanted to give them a 5 star rating was that the bbq sauce by the drink area was SO GOOD! I'm from Texas and it's so hard to find good bbq sauce! & the sweet tea oh my the sweet tea! You can actually taste the tea it wasn't just sugar!!! Definitely comin back!      UPDATE: the first time I went it was awesome but couldn't find the same service since. The manager is not the nicest. I don't like my meat cold and asked if they could stick my food in the oven to warm up and was told no..."}
{"text":"DUNNO WHAT THIS IS. IT'S NOT BARBECUE.   This branch hasn't been open long. Wife and I dropped in today for a quick lunch, and to see if it compared to our favorite BBQ spots. It doesn't.   Wife ordered the sandwich. Said she didn't think much of it.   I ordered the 2-meat BBQ with jalapeno beans and cole slaw. \"Chopped or sliced?\" says the young man behind the counter. First time I've ever encountered this question -- usually the stuff is shredded. I say \"Chopped\". What I end up with is square-chopped brisket and REALLY thick sliced chicken.   The beef is dry and relatively flavorless unless you add BBQ sauce (sauce is tasty).  Chicken is dry too, rubbery, kind of off-putting even with BBQ sauce.  Cole slaw has merit.  Jalapeno beans are 50% runny sauce and have a faint but unmistakable flavor of tobacco.  All served with a square and tasteless white bread roll.   Does this sound to you like it's worth almost $30? No, I don't think so either ... which is why we won't be going back. Nor should you. Try Hap's instead. Or Honey Bear's. Or Tom's in Mesa. Just not this."}
{"text":"Honestly foodwise...I could take it or leave it. Customer service on the other hand was top notch!!! Such nice people working there. They are quick . food was mediocre. Free ice cream,  serve yourself BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"So my team loves this place... we are working late on a Friday night and I place an order to pick up. I come in and pay for my order and even point out that I was undercharged and pay the additional amount. The employee at the counter says we had a rush and I just handed your order over to the line. I sit down over the course of the next 25 minutes I watch numerous orders filled and literally 10-15 customers go through the line. When I ask about my order I am told they ran out of chicken and it will be another 19 minutes to cook. When I ask why I wasn't told when paying they indicate that they will be happy to trade it out for another meat. I explained I have people who don't eat red meat and the response was \"I don't really think sausage and pork are red meat\". Wow this is truly one of the worst customer service experiences I have had. So much for the go to joint for barbecue for my team. No more catering orders or working late food runs either!  So disappointing, but we will find somewhere else to take our business."}
{"text":"Awesome!!!!  The staff was so amazing, and the food was so frickin good!    First time here and Eric the supervisor was so helpful and welcoming. Made some great suggestions. I had the ribs and brisket, and both were so tender and flavorful. The ribs fell off the bone and melted in my mouth.     Altogether a fantastic experience. We will be back."}
{"text":"rude customer service felt like I was bothering them and then when my 2 kids meals came out it was cold and very little. With my drink and 2 kids meals it came to 15 bucks. Never will I visit again"}
{"text":"I walked into the one in Guadalupe and alma school this afternoon around 11am and got 2 kids meals and a medium drink came to 14 bucks and change! Skimpy on the meat and the one guy who didn't even say hi or welcome told me the kids meal had 2 sides then the other guy said oh no you can only get one. I tried the meat off my kids plate and it was cold. The small piece of bun was stale. Not worth my money for bad customer service and nothing special brisket."}
{"text":"I did eat there the other day again possibly perceived as after the lunch rush we're not talking 5 minutes before close people little friendlier food still good"}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying wow!!! I was craving BBQ. My wife told me no but I just had to fill the void in my stomach. Here's what I order,  2 meat item which comes with 2 side.  Beef brisket Jalape√±o cheddar sausage Cabbage slaw Mac and cheese  The beef brisket is so tender and soft. No need for a knife. It was amazing. And don't let me get started with the cheddar jalape√±o sausage. That right there is the best sausage I have ever had. The place opens up at 11 and I would come back over and over again. Mac and cheese was cheesy and the slaw was cold and fresh. 5 stars all around."}
{"text":"I love BBQ but this place is less than average. The bathrooms sure could use a deep cleaning too!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a place to have lunch and I'm glad I stopped by Dickey's. Very friendly staff, fair portions for the price and the food was quite tasty. I had the one meat plate with green beans and mac-n-cheese. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We were absolutely  disappointed in our last visit here. It was a bit slow the time before but this was the worst. We drove out of our way to his particular location  so we could enjoy the ice cream for dessert. We were next in line to be served and as they started our small order for two beef brisket  dinners they asked us three times to remind them what we ordered. While the young man slowly sliced our meat, the young manager came out from the back and held a staff meeting with the two young people in the front while we stood there waiting for them to make our order. The manager paid no attention  to the fact that customers were waiting right in front of him. He did not acknowledge  us or attempt  to help complete  the order so that he could proceed  with his meeting. We had to stand there and wait a good five-six minutes and wait for him to finish. He told them to close the place down at 7 o'clock even though closing time is 9 pm. The meat that they sat out for us was getting  cold. The manager went back into the rear of store and the staff asked us two more times what we ordered and finally completed our meal twenty minutes after the start. I felt like we were stuck in a bizarre  time warp and I couldn't understand why it was so hard for them to help us. We finally got our food and went to sit down. There were two other diners in the place and every single table was filthy. We had to ask the young woman  working to clean a table for us. Glad to be finally be able to eat our cold food, we hit the BBQ sauce pots to find they were more like water than BBQ sauce. Now we've eaten at Dickeys before several times and this was not normal. Watered down sauce is the act of poor managing skills and a shoddy attempt to save money. While up to get our sauce we also found the ice cream machine was out of order and they were out of plastic wear. So it was bad service and management all around. Plus, I suspect they were trying to close early on a Friday night. We are not at all happy about our experience  here and I really hope this can be improved. Until then, we won't be back here."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to give the 3rd star, bu the \"A-Ok\" text that pops up just didn't accurately describe my experience at Dickey's.  I'll start by stating that the Beef and Cheese Baker (stuffed baked potato) was actually very tasty.  But it's a baked potato stuffed with extras.  I also enjoyed the fried okra and coleslaw.  Was wishing for a little more bite or horseradish in the slaw, but I like the chunky cut style.  The sliced brisket and pulled pork were both very dry and somewhat bland in flavor.  I wasn't really getting the layers of smoke and spicy rub I would expect at a BBQ joint.  I did appreciate the sauces being heated for serving, but they were all kind of sweet with different levels of spice.    This place is not terrible.  Very clean, and the service was just fine.  It just reflects more of that \"big chain\" bbq shop that doesn't put the extra love into the food that's plated.  It's obvious that there is a play book that is followed where the meats are prepared early in the day, and likely sit in a heated area waiting to be served.  By 7 PM, smoked meats get pretty dry.  With some of the other choices in town, this is likely my first and last visit to Dickey's.  Good BBQ is worth the drive."}
{"text":"Dang this place was good. Such a friendly staff and the chopped brisket was by far the best brisket I've ever tasted. Sauces were AWESOME....and free ice cream after your meal?! Yes please! I used to work at a bbq joint several years ago and you guys put them to shame! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was filthy. The soda fountain bar was filled with discarded ice. The BBQ sauce self serve are was empty and a disgusting mess. The Soft Serve ice cream had broken cones all over. I had to clean the table before we sat down. The seemed understaffed, overworked or both. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Well it seems like terrible service is the only thing consistent about this restaurant. I am a teacher and ordered food for myself and some coworkers today. I sent the order in online at 11:30 and it told me it would be available for pickup at 12. Perfect! My kids are at recess/lunch until 1 so there was enough time to grab it and come back and eat. I get to the restaurant at exactly noon (teachers are always on time), there's 2 people in line ahead of me. I notice the sign by the cash register that says to pick up online orders here. I walk up to the register where I am not acknowledged for about 3-4 minutes. When I'm finally noticed I was asked what I was waiting for and I told them I had an online order. The blonde girl working (couldn't see her name tag because her apron strap covered it) whipped around and RUDELY said \"Ya well it's going to be about 15 minutes longer because we're really busy!!!\" And I said Woah... Sorry I didn't know. The website said 12:00 so I'm here. She ignored my response, turned around and continued working. I could see they truly were busy with two big orders ahead of mine and I'm understanding of that, but that's no excuse for a terrible attitude. So I'm watching the clock, 12:15 passes, 12:20, 12:25 when the girl with the attitude tells her manager (skinny guy, grey hair) uh this girl has been waiting here for a long time so we need to make her order. And she turns to me and says \"Sorry, we overlooked your order and are going to start it now.\" IT HAD BEEN 25 MINUTES!! Manager standing right there with no apology. So once everything comes out, it's 12:40 and all I get is \"Thanks for your patience.\" The ONLY reason I stayed to wait is because I had already paid the $40 bill online. Food was cold, mediocre, looked like it had just been thrown together and the order wasn't even right!!!! Very very disappointed. At least offer a coupon, or a free menu item for my 40 minutes of patience. Definitely don't recommend this place! I hope someone from the corporate team sees this and can convince me not to tell every person I know to never try this place. Oh and after speeding back to school, I made it with 3 minutes to pick up my students from lunch, eat my cold bbq meal that I settled for even though it wasn't what I ordered, and teach a lesson on fractions all at the same time!"}
{"text":"Love! This is a pretty good (well hidden) spot for BBQ in Arizona. Prices are fair- you can eat for under $15. The staff was super friendly and the gal there told us she makes a lot of the sides from scratch- love that!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and even better food. This is the best barbecue around. The brisket is my favorite."}
{"text":"Great food cheap price. Manager and staff look out for customers and give them discounts on plates. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"They catered our teams soccer party.  Had the brisket, chicken and nuggets.  Mac and cheese was yummy!  I could eat the brisket by the pound.  Great job and greatly appreciated!"}
{"text":"Not likely to return...at least not to this location on Indian School. The food itself was ok, but not good enough to put up with the service we received. Was our first time ordering from here and we placed our order online just before 7pm for a 7:30pm pick up. The place closes at 9. So was surprised to receive a call only a few minutes later from them, only to be told that 3 of the 4 plates we ordered could not be filled because they were out of chicken. Since the order had already been paid for, I went ahead and asked them to substitute turkey instead of the chicken. The guy proceeded to explain to me that they always run out of chicken and their other meats within 60-90minutes of closing on a DAILY basis. Mind you, our order was placed 2 HOURS before closing. I arrived a couple of minutes before 7:30 to pick up our order and as the the girl behind the counter began bagging the food she informed me they were out of the potato casserole side we ordered and I needed to pick another side. I finally get home and as I'm passing out the orders, I discover our side of green beans is not in the bag and instead we were given baked beans. Very disappointed in the lack of customer service and their inability to deliver on what they sell on their menu...bad experience. I can understand small mistakes but they failed multiple times in a single order."}
{"text":"Good Food.  Reaonably priced.  Hate the way the counter is set-up to order.  Only one guy, and he is in no hurry.    Our meals have been very tasty.  I guess I am there on Thursdays...as I keep having the Thursday special.    Taking a different friend to try it this week."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! If it wasn't for that I wouldn't go back. The man behind the counter cutting the meat made us feel like we were bothering him. I had literally two questions, and no one was even behind us in line. But he seemed to not have any patience for us. The girl doing the sides was fine, but she too seemed a little exasperated. It's really too bad because the food really is so amazing, but the service leaves a bad taste in your mouth"}
{"text":"Had to place a catered order for a film crew of 25 people and Yolanda helped me out. Gave me everything I needed and the food was amazing. Would definitely go back again"}
{"text":"I'm not too sure what to think about them as you walk in very nicely the cord the staff that are at the counter are super friendly very helpful willing to take the time to tell you about their products I had the brisket the brisket by itself taste very good pulls apart easily and has a great smoked flavor now their BBQ sauce I didn't really like any of them there's three regular sweet and hot I guess that was the best of the third not very many choices and sides and they don't have banana pudding what the hell so I'll go again just for the brisket and maybe find my favorite barbecue sauce and take it with me"}
{"text":"Awesome!!  Went there on game day, they hooked us up with the games we wanted, and the food was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"We tried this place when they first opened. We ordered an XL family pack, which was supposed to have 3 pounds of meat in it. We noticed when we got it all home that it looked like the three meats did not match up in portion size, so we weighed them on our home scale. Not one of the meats was a pound, and two of them were substantially less. I think the dude putting our order together puts his thumb on the scale. Maybe they had run out of some stuff... I don't know. If this is the case, shouldn't they tell the customer and let them decide if they want to have more of something they are lacking to make up the difference? Never again."}
{"text":"I love love Dickey's bbq. Good food, but at this location, I have experience some of the worst customer service. Showed up today for lunch wasn't even noon and they were out of turkey and strongly encouraged us not to order the brisket. It was like they didn't plan for the day correctly. Our sides were barely half full. Kind of expensive for a few ounces of mac n cheese and potato caserole. The girl at the register was new and rude.  Later we called to get more food for another family member and it's only 4pm and they're completely out of brisket for the day....that's ok. We drove to the Tempe location and received exceptional service and they actually weren't out of bbq! Looks like they have a new customer."}
{"text":"Dickey's is amazing!!! I am from NC. And super duper picky when it comes to good BBQ!! Well these guys have done it!!! Everything on the menu is great- but I particularly either get the westerner sandwich or the pulled pork plate with spicy sausage and ribs!! Gotta get the big yellow cup with sweet tea and a pecan pie if u are really hungry!!! The free ice cream is a very cool plus!!! They have the best crushed ice!!!! Their original and spicy BBQ sauces are excellent!!!!"}
{"text":"First time eating here , we wanted some good bbq and decided to give it a shot. Pulled pork is excellent , very tender and smokey. A little too much fat for my taste but not a big deal. Chicken breast is super tender , juicy and smokey. Fried okra , Mac and cheese also very good. Portions are perfect , and the price was great. Sauces are very good. I do wish they offered corn bread instead of just the biscuit, but the biscuit was good, we will definitely come back !"}
{"text":"Let me tell you about my friend, Chopped Brisket. I try not to eat a lot of red meat, but when I crave it, only few things will satisfy the craving. Dickey's Chopped Brisket is one of them. Paired with a half-roll/half-biscuit and any of their sides, I recommend splitting the sweet tea with the unsweetened tea. Don't forget ice cream at the end.   The staff is unpredictable, some of the young girls can be very unprofessional, but it doesn't stop me from a repeat visit."}
{"text":"The food was actually pretty good. The reason im only giving 3 stars is because I ordered a brisket salad. The brisket was so full of grease and fat it gave me a tummy ache.  Greasy greasy meat on salad, No Bueno.    Everything else was good.  I would eat here again , but won't be ordering brisket."}
{"text":"We loved Dickey's BBQ but do not feel we can order from them again.  First time shame on them, second time shame on me for going back.  1/29/18 we ordered @ 6:15 pm delivery in Maricopa (we are literally 7 minutes from their door) after 3 phone calls later (their cue doesn't work) our food arrived ice cold @ 7:40 pm.  Last night 2/23/18 we ordered delivery @ 6:34 pm (two phone calls later) our food arrived @ 7:30 again cold. The receipts showed it was to arrive @ 7 pm.   At first we were going to refuse order but my husband and I are diabetics and had to eat.  The driver said he was the only delivery person on a FRIDAY night?  It's ok to be busy but get your que fixed so we know the status and hire more drivers for weekends."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best BBQ east of the Mississippi. I have never had better pulled pork, and I've tried it everywhere. The brisket is perfectly tender. The turkey is sublime. The sides are delish, especially the loaded baked potato casserole and pecan pie!!"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. You order at the front and then step to next counter to pay. Serve your self soda with crushed ice. You can choose several sauces to add to your plate. Seating - tables with sturdy armless chairs. Not much room between tables. Soft serve ice cream with cake cone near exit. It is not that great but leaves you with a sweet taste."}
{"text":"I get the 3 meat special, brisket, ribs, pulled pork, extra slaw. My perception is they tit for tat...they seem stingy with the sides/portion (1 ice cream scoop perfect measure). The $$ is in the meat, not the slaw! Free ice cream cones.  The side roll is a hard, useless puck.  Sweet tea. And I keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good, nothing really special. Good bread would have made a huge improvement in the sandwiches, because the flavor of the meat was quite good. But it takes bread to make a sandwich, and this bread was mediocre. With a little focus on the bread and this would be a four instead of a three. Good value, good service, and pretty good food. Too bad, it could be so much better so easily."}
{"text":"Not good, at all. I was handed barely warm jalape√±o/cheese kielbasa sausage. The chicken isn't pleasant tasting. The mac and cheese is a joke, very watery and tasteless. The \"Texas\" toast has Iowa written all over it, nothing \"Texas\" about it.  Mediocre at its finest.   The waffle fries and barbecue sauce were the best tasting items on the tray.  Go figure!"}
{"text":"I've been to Dickys 3 times at two locations and the service is excellent along with the food. Each time we get extras to bring home. I've told my family I'll never BBQ ribs again. They've perfected it! The brisket is awesome and juicy, pulled pork is flavorful and ALL the sides are great. Highly recommend the Decatur location. Staff and management always have great service!"}
{"text":"I think this location is closed. Google maps says it is and the website only has a location in Scottsdale and Mesa listed."}
{"text":"I didn't know you could mess up mac and cheese. I got it while I was here, and felt almost nauseous eating it as it had the texture of Elmer's glue with a faint taste hardly reminiscent of cheese. I enjoy Mac and cheese usually anywhere I have it, but this one here had me missing Kraft boxed. The brisket was very mediocre, not very well seasoned or rememberable, with a couple large inedible chunks of fat in it. The lemonade, atmosphere, and cleanliness was okay. I'd recommend perhaps waiting until customers are closer to the counter to greet them, as yelling across the restaurant is a little awkward and puts pressure on the customer to have to shout back across the entire floor."}
{"text":"We decided to try this new location as it is closer to our house than the one on Bell. We walk in and first thing I notice is no ice cream station. That's fine, I don't need the calories. There was a group of 3 in front of us ordering and 2 employees working. We waited about 10 minutes in line, half of that, the first employee was cutting meat, not helping a customer. He didn't even acknowledge our presence until he was finished. Not a, \"I'll be right with you,\" or \"Give me just a moment,\" or something. Then we tried to order the Deal of the Day. They said it's only until 4pm. Ummm what?? The Dickey's website says, \"All day, every day.\" Nothing about 4pm. And their Deal of the Day is $10.99 when the one on Bell is $9.99. So we left and will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"I really like this location. The employees here are always friendly, even when they're getting slammed. We've been here a couple times when they've run out of a certain meat, but they have no problem substituting a different meat. The food is always good, but sometimes is too hot to start eating right away. And when you're done eating, free ice cream!"}
{"text":"This is a great little spot for lunch.  It's small but they have a great menu, the portions are good and you can't beat the free ice cream.  I'm a fan of the ribs which are meaty, smokey and cooked to perfection.  On a recent visit we came in and placed our orders and got to the register and the owner was there.  She asked if we were ordering drinks and we said yes and she replied \"It's hot outside, drinks are on me, ladies\". Unexpected and absolutely what we needed since we had just left another establishment which provided the worst service and brought a smile to our faces.  It's little things like that which make you want to go back because it shows that they care about their customers."}
{"text":"Amazing! Ordered BBQ Chicken, Turkey, Pulled Pork, Brisket, and Ribs..all was made to perfection. Best BBQ food joint in the SW. Awesome customer service. Thanks again, for supporting the troops with the discount."}
{"text":"The quality of Dickey's food at all locations has degraded.. two out of four time i ordered here, i asked for the beef brisket be chopped, and it was not. service is amazing, 5 stars for the employees."}
{"text":"Great food and great people! The BBQ picnic s perfect for our family. Loved the Carolina and sweet sauces. Kids loved the Mac and I had slaw. All delicious. Plus free ice cream."}
{"text":"Great barbecue place around town first time here and it was delicious the pork ribs taste amazing! Service was awesome the guys are very courteous and nice they made sure we had everything we needed and made us feel welcomed. I highly recommend if your looking for good barbecue try Dickey's! Oh and the drinks are 99cents when you bring yellow cup back awesome"}
{"text":"I've been going to Dickey's for a few years now.  Be sure to sign up for their \"club\" to get coupons and a free sandwich for your birthday.  Which is what I did today!  I got a pulled pork sandwich and macaroni and cheese.  The pulled pork was tasty, yet chopped up a little too much for my preference.  The Mac n cheese was very cheesy.  Good sauces (which are heated).  However the best thing in my opinion is their iced tea.  Having given up soda I judge some places by their tea as much as their food.  Dickey's unsweetened tea is always good....good enough for an extra star on its own!  The only bad note for this visit was the soft serve ice cream.  Not sure if the machine wasn't ready or what was happening but the ice cream was like vanilla soup coming out.  Didn't go too well in the cone.  Definitely will go back to Dickey's again though!!"}
{"text":"Giving 1 star is truly being generous.  If you want real BBQ, please try Shane's Rib Shack, Stacy's Smokehouse, Famous Daves, Bobby Qs, hell try my boyfriend's BBQ.  I'm sorry to be so blunt.  I'm thinking the people that frequent this place has never had real BBQ or there aren't that many options in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Biggest rip-off on the planet. Their \"Big\" Barbecue Sandwiches are about 3 inches around and the menu says they are $5.75 but when I got home I just saw they charged my $9 for a sandwich that is smaller than a junior cheeseburger from McDonald's,  it's basically a $9 slider. I took a picture with a lighter next to it so you can get an idea of the size of this $9 rip-off."}
{"text":"First time going there, heard from a friend food was good. But as soon as I walk in it was dead silence from the hand full of people in there. And as soon as I got up to the counter to order I found out why, the girl taking people's order was a horible person, very rude. Just what do you want and not even looking at you. I'm telling her my order and I have 2 other people with me that I'm ordering for and she looks all pissed off becouse I keep ordering more and more. She starts putting our food together by tossing food on top of food, never looking at us just pissed at the world, and even rude to her own co-workers. The cashier seemed new but at least she was friendly. Finally got our food all the meat was cold but great flavor, the side items were hot and good but they were served by another server. So I say the food was good but with that horrible first impression of the first worker I will never go back or recommend anyone to go back, as for the quietness from the other customers I have to say they were all pissed off aswell."}
{"text":"We love Dickeys and we were so excited that they were putting one next to our house!   We walked in a night they were training and even though there were a few hiccups this was the best service and the best food we've ever had at a Dickey's. It was so nice to finally see a Dickey's with friendly and eager employees and really good barbecue.   I also love their Barbecue Boots and Badges program. My husband is a firefighter and I will now go out of my way to support a restaurant that supports my husband and the job he does.   Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The Food is ok not really what you call BBQ if you want the real stuff go to Lagerheads they are way better and real BBQ it would be the best BBQ you would ever fine. The bad thing about Dickey's is you always have to repeat things to them, ask them more then once when I first went in after they opened the floor was greasy, and slippery people were slipping and sliding. even my self since I had slip resentance shoes on.      But this place is slowly coming together not sure how long they will stay in business."}
{"text":"I ordered the two meat plate, brisket and pulled pork, the pork was a low average and the two SMALL slices of Dry Brisket really Sucked.  My wife ordered the smoked turkey, it was a Processed Turkey Roll that was also dry.  That was my second time at this Dickeys and was Definitely the last.  If you want Texas barbecue this is NOT it!"}
{"text":"Catering, take out, free delivery within ten miles! Plus free soft serve! What more can you ask for? The homemade BBQ sauces are so delicious. Shared the meal of the day and the smokehouse salad with my husband. Such a smart idea. Gets a better sample of what they have to offer here. Only thing I wished for was a better selection for kids meals. The first employee you see coking through the door needs to be more friendly and make eye contact. But everyone else was awesome, especially Aaron. Comfy, and mostly clean."}
{"text":"I was really excited when I learned that there was a new Dickey's close by. The food at this location is the same great quality that we had back in Texas, but my lower rating is because of the service.   Where do I begin... When I walked in, the guys were struggling with a cash register issue. Instead of letting me know it would be with me in a minute, they ignored me while I stood there, awkwardly, for a good 3-4 minutes.   I ordered brisket, pulled pork, cole slaw, okra, mac and cheese and beans to go. This location doesn't have okra, and they were out of beans. Disappointing, but understandable. I asked for sauce and pickles, and was told \"sure!\" Got my order home and had potato salad instead of slaw, no sauce, no pickles, and three very small rolls for an order to feed six people. I was the only person there who was ordering food, so it shouldn't have been difficult to keep straight.  I will give them another shot because it's Dickey's and it's delicious, but they need to fix the service issues if this location stands a chance."}
{"text":"What a disappointment ! Was looking forward to trying this place for the first time since being told it was great BBQ . Definitely not the case . I ordered the 1 meat plate with ribs, potato salad and Mac and cheese . The ribs were really chewy and the sides where very generic like what you'd get at KFC not a BBQ place . My bf ordered a 2 meat plate and total was about $31 . Way to expensive for what you get . If I had to describe this place I'd say it's like the McDonald's of BBQ ."}
{"text":"-10 love Dickey's in Texas so we thought we'd try at home and for the love of god ppl this is crap! We order 42$ worth of meat and sides paid for 3 meat plater and got 2. Half of the sides we ordered are wrong. When my wife picked up the order the ppl behind the counter were making fun of customers."}
{"text":"We arrived close to lunch time in a Saturday and they weren't that busy. There were 6 adults and 1 child. We found a seat really quick. The staff was great and the assistant manger Josef took our orders and got the food out quick and correct. His customer service skills are wonderful. I personally work in the casino business and that kind of customer service is what they are looking for. Make sure to hold onto him. He'd be the reason we come back."}
{"text":"When I lived in Dallas this was the thing iodized most when I left. Seeing that beautiful yellow and red sign brought back so many happy memories. There is literally nothing here that isn't good. I would eat this every single day if I could!"}
{"text":"AMAZING CUSTOMER SERVICE!!  I am so impressed with this location and their amazing customer service. We stopped in one day for lunch and purchased a couple of plates to go. When we got home, we realized that they had unfortunately forgotten to put any BBQ sauce in our bag. They also didn't give us the corn bread that we ordered, but they also forgot to charge us for it, so I didn't want to make a fuss about it. When I called Dickey's to let them know that we were missing items from our order (most importantly the sauce lol), they offered to immediately fix the situation by driving the sauce and cornbread to our house! Wow! I didn't know businesses were kind enough to do something like that anymore! Thank you Dickey's for going out of your way to make the situation right! Food was delicious too! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food for a reasonable price. I had the racecar sandwich and it was fantastic. The only complaint I have is that I wish the sides were larger. If you like spicy food, I highly recommend the spicy bbq sauce. I'm sure I will be going back many more times."}
{"text":"Worst ribs ever. I think my ribs had been sitting around for days. It was like \"rib jerky\". You know, dehydrated and leathery.  The brisket was rubbery and flavorless. kind of the same stuff you would expect boiled from an English Pub. the brisket also had a sitting-around-for-days vibe. I guess Dickey's believes that BBQ sauce will cure bad cooking.  one side we had was the jalapeno beans. these were spectacularly awesome. best beans ever. it's not cut up pieces of peppers on top of beans. rather, the jalapenos have been sauced and the beans have been infused with the mouth watering essence of the peppers.  The 'Q couldn't stand on its own. it was just another Dickey's food that went nowhere without BBQ sauce.  The sauces are standard issue, run of the mill, middle of the road, forgettable.  Skip this place."}
{"text":"The meat is the key!!!! And they got the great recipie.  The decor is on point and the meat locker is on display"}
{"text":"What a great old school BBQ eatery! The food is served on a silver tray with the brown wax paper. The sauces are tangy and the beef brisket and jalape√±o and cheese kielbasa was awesome. I will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"This location has super nice staff - but the overall quality is majorly lacking. The meat was mostly fat.  In addition,  they were out of most things including:  jalapeno cheddar kielbasa,  jalapeno beans, lids for cups, knives,  and all low calorie drinks (including diet coke).  Pretty disappointing"}
{"text":"The best chicken sandwich I have had in a long time, the chicken was juicy and sooo good.  My husband was not as impressed as i was as he said the portions were way too small for the price.  I will be back not sure if hubby will."}
{"text":"The food was excellent. Brisket was good but you need to add sauce. Pork ribs were perfect. I'd recommend this place to everyone. Very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"Pulled pork is pretty good and so are the ribs.  But the sides are NOT good.  Instant mashed potatoes.  Overly smoked green beans.  Weird tasting baked beans.  Bland Mac and cheese in a faux cheese sauce.  If you want grab n go BBQ, stick to Old Carolina.  It is way, way better than this place."}
{"text":"Rating five stars for the excellent customer service we received here a few days ago. A guy named John took our order. He was super helpful in helping us pick something from the menu and even made it a point to come by our table and ask us how the food was.   I got the potato with pulled pork and onion stray thingys and my bf got a pulled pork sandwich with a side of brisket. I LOVED the potato, you would think a BBQ baked potato would be kinda awkward with BBQ sauce but I thoroughly enjoyed it. One of the best baked potatoes I have had. And it was HUGE! In usual fashion, the bf helped me finish it after he finished his plate.   We have been to this location twice since it opened. Both times have received great customer service and some pretty tasty food. My only qualm is that it is a bit pricey for the portion size. However I think the customer service we received makes up for that."}
{"text":"I am conflicted because I'm not a vegetarian but, I hardly eat meat. My husband brought me here so, I'm not going to be picky especially since he's a chef and has me try just about everything including tri tip, ribs basically anything you can smoke . We ate here once by ourselves without the kiddos and shared a two meat entree which comes with your choice of meat and two sides for around $12.95 give or take. They are not generous in their portions but, they'll serve you just enough to get ample satisfaction of what your trying. The second time around we wanted to bring the kids on a Sunday as 12 years old and younger get a free kids meal with any $10 purchase. My favorite part about the restaurant is they have one of those new Coca Cola Freestyle soda fountains with like 127 flavors to choose from and self serve all you can eat ice cream with cones! One of the cashiers said she's seen some customers fill up a cup with ice cream and then go over to the soda machine and add root beer to make a float. Still didn't try it but, maybe one of these days. One more thing I almost forgot if, you bring back your Big Yellow Cup you get free refills"}
{"text":"For this place being \"fast food\" I found it absolutely fantastic. I ordered the 3 meat plate with brisket, chopped pork, and cheese sausage. All of the meats were great and would compete with any top notch BBQ in town. The sides were incredibly delicious, I ordered the baked potato casserole and jalepeno baked beans.  Both were so good. It was my first time here but couldn't find any issues to complain about. They even serve FREE soft serve ice cream, how can you beat that??? We'll done Dickeys!! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried the pulled pork sandwiches. Very good. Meat was tender. Original sauce wasn't too tomatoey. Took grandson who can be a little picky and he are everything!! Will be back to try more"}
{"text":"Wanted to try something a little different while in the valley. I had the brisket sandwich she the pulled pork both were really good sides were tasty too. Baked potato casserole cabbage slaw. Staff was very friendly. Think I have yet another stop on my next visit to the valley."}
{"text":"I used to believe that, just like there was no such thing as a bad day of golf (or fishing), there was no such thing as bad barbecue. Then, I went to Dickey's in Scottsdale.   I was chased out of my house by a posse of women/children who wanted to watch Smurfs. I wanted to watch the Lions-Saints football game. Stacey's BBQ on Shea no longer has a television. I thought I'd try Dickey's Barbecue Pit. It ticks off my g/f when I eat barbecue. SHE listens to my cardiologist. I ordered half a rack of pork ribs, barbecue beans and iced tea.  Dickey's must have pigs bred just for them. I've never seen pork ribs with so much fat on them. Most barbecue joints will brag about how their spare rib meat  falls off the bone. At Dickey's, the meat on these pork spare ribs hung on the bone like it was super-glued. There was no discernible rub on the ribs. In spite of asking for the barbecue sauce on the side, it was sweet barbecue sauce that was splashed on my ribs. The hot barbecue sauce (next to the soda machine) was tangy.  Most barbecue joints brag about their iced tea. At Dickey's, I was handed a cup and pointed toward a soda machine. Shaved ice and Nestea. No lemons. The only lemonade available was Minute Maid diet. Blecch.   The barbecue beans? If you like your barbecue beans mushy and bland, this is the place for you. I've had better beans that were poured out of a can.   In sum, Dickey's is to barbecue what Earl Scheib's is to automobile paint jobs. My meal was everything barbecue was not supposed to be. The best part of my meal (besides leaving) was the yellow plastic cup. No one could get me in these doors again, not for love or money. Stacey's: PLEASE get a new television."}
{"text":"Awesome place! It may look a bit shabby from the outside, but inside you are greeted with a great atmosphere and two enthousiastic cooks who serve great BBQ'd pork. Try the beef brisket and galapeno-cheddar sausage! Just a short stroll from the Las Vegas South Outlet stores."}
{"text":"Although I wouldn't typically consider this a fast food place I suppose in theory it is. Having a gluten-free diet makes any type of quick lunch extremely difficult. I'm loving that Dickey's BBQ meat and sauces are all gluten-free!! that is absolutely huge to us Gluten Free People. The meat that I had was pulled pork without the bread. I was given a spicy sauce and a sweet sauce. The pork is extremely tender and very very moist. The flavor is fantastic. Both sauces are good. This week is definitely sweet. I will be back!! The staff was very sweet and very helpful in making sure the items were truly gluten free. Very knowledgeable"}
{"text":"Ordered from GrubHub so I can only comment on food and not the service.  Most BBQ places seem to be a little more expensive, but I think, as one of the more affordable options, this is a pretty decent place.  The picnic packs are an amazing deal!  For $25 I got meat, two sides, and 4 rolls.  Plates, napkins, and cutlery were all included.  I don't know if the BBQ sauce is normally included as I made it a point to ask for some (I like some bbq on my brisket).  I think that for $25 you can probably get 3 \"regular\" size meals, but if there are 4 of you I'd suggest going up to a larger picnic pack or ordering some extra sides.  Plenty of meat, not plenty of sides.   The BBQ sauce is delicious.  It's a little runny, which seems to be a sore point with some people, but I actually prefer it that way when it comes to brisket because some of that liquid helps the brisket stay moist.  As for the brisket itself, when I originally tried it, I expected it to be dry but it wasn't at all.  My only issue was there were a few chunks of fat.  But I can't really criticize them for that.  Most people like some fat.  But I just can't handle the texture.    The two sides I chose were the mac & cheese and the potato salad.  Both were pretty similar to what you might buy from a deli. Maybe not full of \"home made\" flavor, but still definitely delicious!  Since it's just me I have been slowly eating away at my picnic pack for the last three days, and even after being in the microwave the food is still pretty good.    I wouldn't go so far as to say it's my FAVORITE bbq place, but it's definitely a place I'd return to and suggest to others."}
{"text":"Food was good and the staff was friendly.  Nice to have a good bbq place in the neighborhood.  Hope this lasts!!"}
{"text":"This place is fabulous. The food is amazing and the staff is friendly, courtious and professional. I will definitely be eating here again. Great place!"}
{"text":"I love Dickies! I have suggested this to many people and they also love it! Hmmmm, I will to go there this week!"}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today..got full rack and we got 2 plate meal with pulled pork and ribs....really super good and the ribs are really meaty! Mac and Cheese was good too. I will definitely start coming here more because it's pretty awesome!"}
{"text":"OMG!! Lovely lovely tender melt in your mouth BBQ!  The 3 meat plate comes with your choice of 2 sides (and there are a lot of choices). All for a reasonable price. Plus kids eat free on Sunday's. The onion rangers are my personal go-to followed by their Mac and cheese. They gave both unsweetened and sweet (but not too sweet) tea. There is free ice cream when the meal is over. My kids always end the meal with a root beer float. Staff is friendly and the bathrooms are clean. Only drawback is if there is any kind of a line, you might have to wait a bit. We have been several times and will keep going back for the yummy meats."}
{"text":"There food is so good everything from the meat to there coleslaw to the cups u get to keep i have alot lol"}
{"text":"Great food and simple menu! This is a classic sandwich with pulled pork came with 2 side and a drink! My husband got the 3 meat plate with 2 side. You can chose anything from brisket, ribs, pulled pork,smoked sasuage etc. Kids eat free on Sundays which was a nice surprise! They have one of the cool soad machines where there is every flavor possible! They also have fresh brewed tea and fresh lemonade. Another awesome win is they have free ice cream and cones! This was a big hit with the kids!!! For my husband's meal and my meal it was 27 bucks. Drinks and everything. Totally worth it great BBQ and the customer service was great! Clean resturant! We will be back for sure! They are military friendly with discount available for active and vets!"}
{"text":"July 4, 2011  This was one of the worst meals I EVER ate. We found that there were just not a lot of options for restaurants open on July 4th but we called Dickey's in Scottsdale and found out they were open until 7:00 p.m. We got there at 6:20 p.m. There was a line to order and several tables were filled. When we got to the counter to place our order (we both ordered the 2 meat plate) we were told that they were out of both types of brisket and ribs. So, we both ordered the same plate (roasted turkey, virginia baked ham, green beans with bacon and mac & cheese). We got our drinks and sat down. We waited for 20 minutes and when we finally got our food I took one bite of my mac & cheese only to find out it was cold. Not hot, lukewarm but cold like it was just taken out of a refrigerator and thrown into a cup.   The beans were hot but drenched in water. The ham was lukewarm at best. The turkey was disgusting. It tasted like processed turkey that you buy from a deli counter. It was also cold.   To pay more than $26 for semi-fast food to have limited choices available and then have your food suck is beyond unacceptable. I will NEVER GO BACK TO DICKEY'S AGAIN and I will be sure and tell everyone I know NEVER TO GO THERE AS WELL.   I understand the restaurant closed at 7:00 p.m. because of the holiday but they were not closed at 6:20 p.m.  The service was also horrible.  As I had 20 minutes to kill waiting for disgusting food, I watched as a patron had to go to the counter not once but twice because first there was no more ice in the soda machine but then when he got his food the employee didn't even give him utensils to eat with!!   Also, there was another customer who had a take-out order. He got his bag and left only to return 10 minutes later because the employee forgot to put some items in his to go order. RIDICULOUS!!!  There were nothing but front line staff working in the kitchen and counter. I don't know who the heck was managing the place but I would say whoever was managing the place should be fired because I saw a lot of unhappy customers and employees who were just waiting for the clock to turn 7 p.m. so they could go home.   My recommendation to all Scottsdale residents who enjoy a good bbq every now and then....go somewhere else. Don't go to Dickey's because you will be throwing your money away!"}
{"text":"The manager on duty was beyond nice !! Just nice to see great customer service ! Staff was amazing and nice as well... a smile and kind words sure go along way in good customer service .. thanks for being awesome"}
{"text":"I had the two meat combo with beans and slaw.  The brisket was dry and the hot links weren't.  They did have never-ending pickles and soda.  I'll stay with Famous Daves or John Mull's."}
{"text":"I read all these rave reviews about how good their sauce is.  It's too bad I didn't get to try it...  I ordered delivery via Grub Hub today and I'm pretty irked.  I understand that Grub Hub deliveries take a bit longer than your normal pizza delivery, but this was the worst experience ever with delivery.  I was able to watch my order go through all of the steps after I ordered about $50 worth of food including the tip (which I now regret doing) for myself and a coworker.  Our delivery driver was Kevin, if you get Kevin, hunker down and get ready to wait an additional hour just for delivery.  I watched for a good 20 minutes while his car did not move on the map, to the point where I was wondering if the map was even working.  Finally he began moving \"toward\" my location, but then quickly started to clearly get lost.  He drove around my building several times, making wrong turns, as if GPS is not a thing easily available in 2016.  When he arrived, his car sat in the parking lot on the map for another ten minutes before he FINALLY called me to tell me he was at security.  I had left instructions to deliver at my lobby and exactly where to go, and it was not \"go to security\".  He also got my name wrong to add insult to injury.  I told him where to go and then waited another TEN MINUTES while he got back in his car and drove to the right place.  We're talking about 100 yards here.  Not a giant complex.  He finally found me and I was displeased to see he was covered in sweat and driving with his windows rolled down, midday in the AZ heat. This meant, everything that should be cold, like coleslaw, was grossly warm, and everything that was supposed to be warm, like french fries and onion strings were cold and soggy from the breeze blowing in the window right into the bag sitting on his front seat.  Long story short, it is just under 5 miles door to door from Dickey's to my lobby and it took over an hour to get here in what should have taken 20 minutes TOPS.  Unacceptable. He might be a nice guy and all, but shouldn't be delivering food.  Speaking of food, I should probably review that.  From what I can tell, since it was either too cold or too warm, this food could be really good!  I could smell the smoke instantly and it has permeated my shirt and hands, that's a good thing.  Any food that can cover me in smoke like a meat flavored cigarette is fine by me.  All of the meats were very tender, all of the sides had great flavor.  I was able to share with my coworker so we got to try lots of different menu items.  I liked the sausages the most, and the brisket and pulled pork were so good (for being cold and dry).  My favorite side has got to be the green beans.  I'm just super bummed because it was all so beat to death from sitting on a front seat for over an hour.  To put a final fork in this experience, we received no BBQ Sauce in our to go bag.  As one other reviewer noted, how can anyone put all of this BBQ meat into the bag and not think, \"hey, they're going to want sauce too\".  Nope, nada, zip, zilch on the sauce.  I don't want to assume it was the delivery guy Kevin's onus to put sauce in the bag, but I will anyways.  There are no options on Grub Hub to order a bottle of or a side of or any other version of sauce, so I assume that customers assume they're getting sauce.  If you're ever on Mill Ave., and want some BBQ, I say go for it! Just don't order delivery.  If I'm ever on Mill Ave., which I am NEVER on Mill Ave., and I want to stand in line, I'll go here.  The chances of ordering delivery again are about 2% for fears of getting the same driver and then feeling the fury of KNOWING he's been here before but doesn't remember.  Sorry Dickey."}
{"text":"There were large quantities of meat. I had ribs which were pretty good, not the best I have ever had. I did not really enjoy the two sides, guess I chose poorly. I will be back, to try again."}
{"text":"Wow, I have been to Dickey's all over NV, TX, AZ and this location I will never go back to. Last Friday night 3 people on shift young guy, older women and of course large meat  cutter. No one in front of us the family behind us let us go in front of them. Stood there for 15 minuets  waiting . Apparently they needed to get caught up or something. Placing a order for 2 people they acted like it was complete rocket science. I got completely impatient with the process of 2 people not knowing or acting like they knew what they were doing. I go to the sauces and there are no cups, there is no cones, and the kid working said it's going to be 15 minuets he is cleaning machine. Ok it's 645pm waited 45 minuets never got ice cream. Pickles finally got filled and cups for sauce as we were leaving. Management really needs to focus on this store and on weekend nights. Personally we will never be back to this location. BTW put a bandanna for the big guy cutting the meat  he works hard and sweats all over the meat area. Thanks"}
{"text":"Let me preface this review by first saying that I am by NO MEANS a barbecue expert. I like what I like, and I don't like what tastes like crap ;)  My boyfriend and I were having my parents over to his place for their first time, so we wanted to get their favorite - good ol' bbq! Unfortunately, I was not very impressed with Dickey's. We ordered one of their family packs which is definitely a good deal for the money. I believe we paid $40 to feed 5 people - not bad!   The XL family meal came with 2 orders of ribs, bbq brisket, macaroni and cheese, baked beans, coleslaw, and bread. The only good part of the meal was the ribs, bread, and brisket. I didn't care for the bbq sauce, because it was a bit runny for me (I like really thick, syrupy sauce!) The beans and coleslaw were decent, but the macaroni and cheese was terrible. I LOVE a good macaroni and cheese, but this was a disaster. VERY bland and very boring.   As far as the service goes, I took the food to go and the wait time was decent. I definitely backed up the line when picking up my order, and I think they could have been more efficient. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be going back to Dickey's. A bad mac and cheese is a deal breaker in my book!"}
{"text":"Stopped in a couple times now for lunch. It's small inside with a small patio for extra seating. There is a sign indicating where to order with a menu overhead. As you approach there is a half wall with glass on top. We stood, waiting, as the person continued to make food. It was awkward and we would have thought we were at the wrong spot to order except for the sign. We weren't greeted, but finally acknowledged.  The menu includes several choices for meats, a variety of sides along with some salad and baked potato options. We ordered a pulled pork sandwich with a side of creamed spinach and a Smokehouse Salad with chicken instead of brisket. BBQ sauce was available to put on the meat. The mild sauce was tasty and sweet. I liked the spicy one best. Just enough heat to add some kick. Overall, food was okay. Creamed spinach was delicious, but portion sizes small for the price. Salad was disappointing. A lot of romaine with a small amount of chicken, cheese and onion tanglers. No other veggies. I thought it was supposed to come with a roll, but I never got one. Soft serve ice cream available for free, but no mention was made.  Overall, good comfort food. Lacking in having healthier options. Meat tender. Sauces average. Service poor."}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill ! The staff on Friday nights is the worst . All clueless and rude ! My son ordered ribs that were the worst ribs I have ever tasted . On top of that they had lots of (what I believe to be tendons ) . It is over  priced , low quality food!!"}
{"text":"We brought our two little boys (age 4 and 6) to Dickeys today. My husband had gone in the past and of course fell in love with it. The food was amazing and my kids loved it!!! It's hard to  find something that they like and Dickeys won them over! And me! A great addition to Surprise! And they give military discounts!!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ place. We were assisted by a Young lady. I believe her name was Hannah.... she helped us pick out our meat and gave us recommendations of what to get. The meat was amazing. The sweet tea was perfect and the Free ice cream was a plus. Will definitely be coming back again."}
{"text":"Man, these folks are super!! Cant say enough good about htis place"}
{"text":"Dickey's has decent BBQ! I love their pulled pork and brisket. They also include free ice cream cones with every order.   Came here to eat with my fianc√© and we both ordered a two meat special. By the way, Dickey's isn't cheap at all lol. I ordered pulled pork and brisket and she ordered cheddar links with brisket, which comes with fries and mac & cheese.   The weird thing about this experience was that our order came up but my plate was hot and ready to eat but my fianc√© plate was cold lol. We asked them to heat up her food and they ended up remaking the order. The brisket was all chunks of fat. Barely any meat to eat at all. The fries were ok but seemed to be over cooked because they were very crunch. The mac & cheese sucks! And I've said that with every visit but for some reason I always choose it as a side. It tastes like Kraft Mac & Cheese from a box if not worse!  The pricing is a bit ridiculous! $25 for two ppl to eat and share a drink but Dickey's is a fast food BBQ restaurant lol.   I give it 3/5 stars because I've had some good experiences in the past with Dickey's. But, I can definitely name a few BBQ spots that are 10x's better than this place."}
{"text":"The food was okay. Nothing super exciting, and I guess since I've been to places that are more southern than Wisconsin and partaken of their BBQ, I'm expecting something a bit different from a place that calls itself a barbeque pit. Definitely a bit more spice, that's for sure.  In addition, for what I paid here, I have gotten almost double the amount of food at said more-southern barbeque places. That's not to say the prices are ridiculous; I just wanted more a bit more food for what I paid.  But hey, the cups are cool, and it's definitely clean and a decent place to eat. I just probably won't go back because its not quite what I want in a barbeque place."}
{"text":"Not really worth the $$$. I got the 2 meat platter with pulled pork, BBQ ham and 2 sides. The sides were the highlight of it all. Baked potato casserole and Mac n cheese. I also tried the fried okra, which was pretty damn good. I'd go back for that okra and sweet tea but the meat was not worth the hefty price tag. Both the pork and ham was dry as all hell, even when drenched in their mediocre BBQ sauce. The portions are laughable. I noticed they had a soft serve ice cream machine in the dining area too, which I did not par take in because I was in a bit of a hurry to get home. I might come back one day. Probably won't. Rollin smoke takes this one. Also, the young lady who took my order had a scowl on her face the whole time. The young dude who took my money however, was very pleasant."}
{"text":"Have eaten at other Dickey's before in Arizona and was not that impressed. But I tried the new location on Pima it was very clean. I am on a no carb diet and asked a lot of questions of the help.How I could order things without carbs. The gentleman was very helpful and offer samples of the meats. The brisket and pork were great. The sauces worked well for me this place will be my go to for a barbecue fix."}
{"text":"I would give this review a 3 or 4 star, but one particular staff member was just really annoying to a point where I didn't want to eat there anymore. He was a red head. That's all I'm saying. At first he was funny and just joking, but then I just became irritable. I just wanted to order and get out of there. He kept making jokes that I couldn't order this or that, or that he's going to quit now so he can't serve me. It was unprofessional and not very good customer service."}
{"text":"Eat at the new proper pig today and had to change my rating based on local comparisons"}
{"text":"I shouldn't have waited until after I ordered to read the reviews. Words like dry and fatty jumped off the screen at me. Dead on. This is simply NOT good bbq, so aside from a kinda waste of money, it might be a good thing they provide so little food. Tiny portions for a lot of buck. One of my ribs was so dry I could barely get the meat off it, and the brisket was mostly fat. The Mac and cheese was good, but tastes pretty much like stoffers frozen, which I love, but wouldn't pay for as a side on a $15 plate of food. No complaints about the beans, but certainly nothing special either. Guess I've been spoiled by Can't Stop Smoking over on Chandler and the 10. Worth the drive. But I won't come back here. Disappointing."}
{"text":"I love Dickie's and the food is delicious. I've only ever eaten at the one in Tempe, so I was super excited when I saw one was opening near my home. Boy was I disappointed. I ordered sliced brisket, they gave me chopped brisket and didn't offer to fix it. Chopped brisket is still delicious but it wasn't what I ordered. To top it all off they don't have an ice cream machine at this location which is one of the reasons why I go to Dickie's. When I asked the manager if they would ever be getting an ice cream machine in the future she said no. Never going back"}
{"text":"My first experience was about a week ago. Friendly service. Ordered a pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw and beans sides. Impressed and could not wait to go back. Went back today 3/6/18, friendly service again, and ordered a meat plate that has two ribs and brisket with coleslaw and beans sides. Both of these orders were take out. When I got home I found the ribs dry and tasteless. The brisket was the same very dry and with little taste. Even the barbecue sauce could not improve the taste. The coleslaw was just marginal this time but the beans were still very good. Really disappointed especially since my first experience was so positive.  I will give the place one more try before I look elsewhere fro ribs."}
{"text":"I had heard good reviews from people who had tried this barbecue location. Ordered a to go pork rib plate with cabbage slaw and barbecue beans sides. The service was good and the price reasonable. The beans and slaw tasted ok but the ribs that were just out of the smoker were too spicy. It tasted like they had a spicy rub put on them. The barbecue sauce was just ok. Only ate two of the ribs and tossed the other two in the garbage. Will not try this place a second time."}
{"text":"It wasn't what i thought it would be but from the look of the outside why would it be ??..I wouldn't say go here and i wouldn't say don't i would just say it's like famous Dave's but not the food could be better the customer service could be even better !"}
{"text":"First opening week it was phenomenal. However, since they have been open a while, it seems as if the quality of care from the staff & food has gone down quite a lot.  Also to note, this is the only location where you pay $2.25 for a drink and CANNOT get refills. According to the staff, \"it is a health hazard,\" by reusing the cup because it can touch the tap? Understandable in a way, but they refused to even pour us refills through an intermediate way.   The food is okay... Nothing to go out of your way for.  The dessert, well, you're able to have a free soft serve ice cream cone, which is awesome, right? ...Except if they're so concerned about our health codes and being rude to customers, they should really up keep their sauce & \"ice cream\" station better, right? (See photo)   Dicky's is usually pretty good, but my suggestion is to avoid this location if you're looking for decent service and a clean location."}
{"text":"Good food. But if their vehicle is this dirty how clean do they keep their restaurant and food!"}
{"text":"Like so many BBQ joints in the Charlotte area, the food is great, but the portions are average... When I leave a BBQ joint, I want it to hurt..."}
{"text":"Really like the taste of the food. Ice cream is really good too. Ordered a meal to go online. Arrived at specified time to pick up and wound up waiting an extra hour and a half because they kept running out of chicken at 2PM. What? Staff was apologetic and handed me three coupons for a free sandwich, with purchase of course, over my next three visits. In no real rush to order a family meal again. The coupons were a nice gesture, but just doesn't get the bad taste out of my mouth."}
{"text":"I had been to one of these in Tucson and remembered not being thrilled with it. However this one opened recently so we decided to give it a shot. The service was fast and friendly. I also like the free ice cream cones at end of meal.    If you want overnight true bbq this probably isn't the place for you. If you want fast easy and reasonable it's a good choice.   It's not that the food is bad it's just not great. The brisket was drenched in sauce where I like to really taste the meat. The Mac and cheese tasted like it came out of the freezer. The fries were average fries."}
{"text":"Had the Wednesday combo special. Loved the bake beans. Great price.!  Oh n Free ice Cream .!!!"}
{"text":"\"UPDATED\" Ordered mac n cheese, never got it and we were never told they don't have any.  Both soda machines were down, the workers got snippy when flaws in the meal were brought to their attention.  We thought the green way location was bad. ... took forever to get your food and it was still wrong.  Feel bad for the employees with a lack of management.  This place needs to be on mystery diners. ... heck, I could tell them their problem from sitting in the restaurant. Another dickeys that I will not be going to again.  Management, where are you?  Update - I got a message from Dickey's customer service asking me for my contact information the very next day.  I gave them my email address now over a week ago.  No response.  They must work like this in every department... they now have 1 star from me.  It is now the 8th of May - still no response from Dickey's."}
{"text":"i was pleasantly surprised. we had lunch there yesterday. i'd never expected too much from this little place but it was good. D and i both had pulled pork sandwiches which were good. i also had potato salad and barbecue beans. the sides were good enough, though i wouldn't likely order the potato salad again - too much mayo. i went back for another sandwich - a chicken sandwich this time and liked it also. nothing special, but good enough. if you want a quick bbq lunch, you should check it out. i'll be back."}
{"text":"Yikes...I won't be going back.  The ordering system is confusing. The staff also seemed confused. The food was very bland and pretty tasteless.  THIS PLACE IS NOT EVEN IN THE SAME LEAGUE AS HONEY BEAR'S NEAR THE AIRPORT!! Skip this bland chain, and go to Honey Bear's!"}
{"text":"Zero customer service.  I struggled through their online menu, could not place an order.  The Google search with reviews has the wrong phone number but finally found the correct number.  With eighteen minutes before closing, I called at 8:42 pm and somebody answered with a \"hello.\"  I had to ask if it was Dickey's and then the person explained that they were closed and how I was encouraged to visit them in the future.  I was across the parking lot at a hotel and only wanted take out.  I walked by and they were not closed.  Terrible experience and a waste of my time."}
{"text":"Tonight was our first and last trip here. Why?  1. Very limited kids menu 2. Walked in and there was a haze of smoke from the kitchen. Was surprised the fire alarm wasn't going off. 3. Bathroom was gross and all of the grout had been turned yellow due to neglect/smoke/grease. 4. Fellow diners were a sketchy bunch. 5. Over cooked meat and waffle fries that were like biting into cooled grease. 6. Awful stomachache from eating 1 rib, side Caesar salad and a few waffle fries."}
{"text":"BBQ is very much a personal preference. My favorite kind is mesquite or hickory smoked. The smoked brisket at Dickey's seems like they might use oak, definitely not mesquite. I also like a good rub on my smoked meat. This meat has the smoked flavor, but no rub that I could detect and slightly dry. To me, the brisket tasted like chopped beef, UNTIL I added the BBQ sauce. Now, that spicy sauce was the bomb! I will definitely go back for the sauce. I also tried the jalape√±o cheddar kiolbassa slider. It was good, but not spicy at all and the cheddar was the most flavorful part.  Cool deal: FREE soft serve and a souvenir cup that can be refilled for 99 cents on your next visit."}
{"text":"So it went to dinner here last night freaking amazing. When you first walk in matter fact right when you pull up in the parking lot you can smell the smoker then as you're walking to the door gets stronger and better as you walk into the restaurant oh shit that's awesome the smell the aroma in the building is just overwhelmingly delicious. The staff was very friendly very helpful and extremely happy to be there something you don't find too often nowadays and kitchens. So I ordered my food went to grab it knocked everything on the ground on accident the staff was extremely helpful remade my plates didn't fuss or complain and that's surprise me. Most places you go to in this happens everybody gets all butt hurt and upset not this place they laughed it off even we were joking about it having fun highly recommend going here I will most definitely be going back more and more often straight felt like family restaurant love the atmosphere the people there were awesome definitely if you haven't checked it out I would check it out preferably this location cuz I don't know about any of the other ones best experience I've had in a restaurant in a very long time.."}
{"text":"First time here and we arrived and were unsure of the order process.  2 guys were behind the counter slicing and gave no acknowledgment.  We waited in the designated order here area with no one in front of us. Finally asked one of the guys behind the counter if we ordered here and they said we had to wait a moment while they were doing some other people's orders around the corner.  My friend ordered brisket and I ordered pulled pork. The pork contained 8 oz and possessed decent flavor but fatty part s and vessels which are both unattractive and inedible.  I will return but they need to learn how to dissect and choose the meat.  from my personal opinion, I think they need to do a better job of training the staff that works here on both customer service, and plating from a chef's perspective.  no one wants to eat the portions of an animal that are tendon, vein or fascia."}
{"text":"This place is really good.  They do a good job of greeting you as you walk into the place.   This trip I got the Chicken and Pulled Pork.  I chose the green beans and coleslaw as the sides too.  The food was good and fresh as always.  I like the sauce selection they have too.  This place is good and worth a try."}
{"text":"I lived in Texas for a few years and haven't found a good beef brisket that took me back to those days. That was until I found Dickey's. The smell of the place is enough to induce a mouth watering experience. Once you bite into the meats you are rewarded with a wondrous time that is only ruined when you run out...the prices are great for what you get, $10.50 for a single meat and $11.50 for two...but there are plenty of both, 2 sides and some bread, pickles and onions. Don't let the size of this place mislead you, visit often and be hungry.  Only have one complaint...no banana pudding (which I mention every time I am there, lol). That won't stop me from going back frequently."}
{"text":"I went there surprised that they were finally open, I had the pulled pork, brisket, and spicy sausage along with baked beans, and mac n cheese and a sweet tea. The sweet tea was good, sweet and tea lol! But it was well brewed and not bitter tasting at all. The pulled pork was great! Smokey, tender, and juicy. It was excellent with any of their sauces. The spicy sausage was also good, lots of flavor and great texture! Onto the brisket, as our first time here it was a given for me to try the brisket, it was everything a good brisket should be except it was chopped/shredded and I could tell it had a nice smoke ring, tender, and flavor was there. When we sat down and were eating we overheard the servers give another customer the option to have their brisket chopped or sliced.  We were surprised as we told them it was our first time there and we were not given any option. I would have preferred sliced as that is what I prefer personally,  I would have appreciated the option as I didn't know there was one. So for your info if you dont get an option for the brisket you can just ask for your preferred cut. The mac n cheese was good, mac and cheesy goodness. The baked beans was also good but I had 75% liquid and 25% beans. I would have liked more beans. The dinner roll/biscuit on the other hand is just down right awesome. I would come here again just for that and the ice cream lol! I will be going here again as they do have flavorful and good barbeque I may have just gotten someone's off day."}
{"text":"This place is great, simple, fast, and really great food, if you like BBQ you have to definitely have to give this place a shot"}
{"text":"Love this place. My second time here and it is one of the best BBQ for the money.  The staff is friendly and the environment is easy, clean and welcoming.  The only thing that would make it better is deliver.  A must try for lunch...and catering."}
{"text":"This is the worst Dickey's location in town. Ordered the 3 meat plate. The brisket was HORRIBLE!! it was so tough. The two employees working behind the counter were not getting along. They were arguing right in front of me. The condiment area was a mess. Don't bother coming to this location.  I recommend the one one of Southeast end of town."}
{"text":"This was my first time here and holy crap this place kicks some serious butt.  I ordered the three meat plate.  I got pork, jalapeno and cheese kielbasa and chicken.  The sides I chose were coleslaw and green beans.  The meats were excellent.  The kielbasa was really good and my favourite.  The green beans had a little bit of spice too.  The coleslaw was a tad sweet and to my liking.  BBQ is different all over.  This place I believe is from Texas.  I think people should give it a chance."}
{"text":"What a gem!The family pack is a super deal! Fed a small army of 5 and we were stuffed and still had leftovers.  The staff were all super but JOHN was the nicest and sweetest - if all people could have this temperament, what a better world this would be!  We visit family here in Vegas in North Vegas/Aliante area often but we will come back to this location."}
{"text":"I like Dickey's. It's not the best barbeque I've ever had, those are in Kansas City MO, but for an almost fast food kind of place they do a great job. I usually skip the sandwiches and just order a half pound of uncut ad untrimmed brisket. It is just what the name implies, a hunk of meat. But it only costs about $5.50. I add a side or two and a drink and for about $11 I have a large meal. For barbeque that's cheap. The meat is always favorable and juicy. I do like a little bit of their spicy barbecue sauce on it also. They changed the potato salad a while back and I don't like the new stuff as much so I usually get a side of green beans. The old potato salad was really good, I don't know why they changed. The new stuff is just any that you can buy in a container at any local market. I would recommend that if you want some meat then give them a try. Just understand when you go it is it's not going to knock your socks off but for the kind of restaraut that it is it above average in their meats. And you don't have to take out a second motgage to eat their. Oh, they also have free icecream for desert and I believe they have a special for kids. Also get a punch card and after your tenth meal you get a free one. Not a bad deal I hope you enjoy it/"}
{"text":"I would really love to rate this restaurant but I can't because I was not able to order. I stood at the ordering counter for no less than 6 minutes. In which time I watched their very not busy employees (nobody else was in the restaurant but me) flirt with each other, complain about past customers and do their food prep duties sarcastically slow.  I politely but obviously asked \"hey is this where I order?\"  To the employees after being ignored so long. Their reply was \"yeah, be with you in a minute when I'm done with this menial task\". So I left. I don't have the kind of time to watch people waste time while I'm on a schedule and wanted to order food and leave.  I went to Robertos next door and was promptly served.  Save your money here, but more importantly, save your time."}
{"text":"Don't let a couple bad first impressions deter you from this delicious food!  We came in last night for our first time not knowing what to expect. Luckily there was no one in line when we got there, so we took our time browsing the impressive menu of meats and sides.   The young guy at the counter was very helpful with choosing our food. The brisket and  pulled pork are very tasty, and their original BBQ sauce is delicious.   As for the price, for two sandwiches and three sides and waffle fries, we spent a total of $16 and the two of us were full! There are options on the menu for families or meat by the pound that cost a little more but still seem reasonable.   Overall, I think this place is a great new addition to our neighborhood and definitely look forward to returning!"}
{"text":"I like the food most of the time. Issue is. Inconsistent. Chopped brisket has good flavor, sometimes chewy, sometimes fatty, sometimes cold. Good Mac n chz.  Not cheap and I don't mind if it's good.  Quarter pound of brisket and small side of mac n chz 7$."}
{"text":"Loved the bbq beans, and the pulled pork is just like back home. Trust me I know good bbq I'm from North Carolina."}
{"text":"If I could give less than 1star, I would.  Service was terrible. ...nobody knew what they were doing. ..repeated our 3 orders multiple times, then rude cashier asked again 3 times !!! Seriously. ....she literally threw plate on counter! And food dry and not hot, ribs tough... Don't think I'll be back. .."}
{"text":"We decided to cater our Father's Day get together from Dickey's and ended up with mixed feelings. The online ordering process was super easy and I liked that it allowed you to track the status of your order. But when it was 15 minutes from scheduled pick up and the status showed our order was still in queue, I was a little nervous.  When we arrived to pick it up, however, everything was ready and the staff was very nice. The restaurant is also nicely decorated and gives all the bbq feels.  On our way home, I rechecked the status online and it still showed in queue, so I guess it never worked as intended. Everything was packed nicely, but the biggest disappointment was the meat portions. We had eight adults but I ordered for twelve to make sure there was plenty and it was barely enough. On the other hand, the sides were more than generous and probably could have fed twenty people. Our meal included sliced brisket, sausage, turkey, green beans, bbq beans, Mac and cheese, and potato salad. Overall the food was good (I'd skip the green beans next time), but it should have had more meat!"}
{"text":"Quick and easy BBQ dine-in. You seat yourself after getting your food at the counter line. All the condiments, utensils, drinks, and FREE ICE CREAM are at the side counter. I love their very cheesy mac and cheese. Only thing I would add is corn bread."}
{"text":"When I drive by my girlfriend's work, my heart breaks a little bit every time. My favorite bbq of Arizona came to a quiet end a few years ago and my stomach has never recovered, and at times I want to refuse Jruggs ever shut down.  I had dreamed of filling the wall with notations of the times I had finished multiple full racks of their ribs with photos of my gluttonous glory, but alas, only a single lonely notation remains upon the walls inside dated February 12th, 2010.  Sometimes I drive by at night and hold a candle in memory of all the good times there.  This grown man has no shame in crying over his lost bbq love!  So with that said, I'm not entirely sure how I feel about Dickey's.  I feel like this is sort of like how you break up with a totally awesome chick, and if you fly solo long enough you start counting nickels as dime pieces.  The first time I went, the ribs were fatty, godawful, completely lacking in any sense of smokiness, with their redeeming items being their fried okra and decent, tangy sauce.  Subsequent visits have discovered the wonder of their Spicy Cheddar sausage, Onion Tanglers, Waffle Fries, and other sides, with their ribs still being hit or miss.  If there were other BBQ places in the vicinity I'd probably be eager for an upgrade, but with this being whats available I come here once a week with my gf.  They seem to have replaced some of their more slow working employees, with service being much faster than previously.    All in all, lots of places can do better, but lots of places do worse, and no other places are in a comfortable vicinity for a work lunch break, so if thats what you are doing, then this is a good place to go versus the plethora of other chains in the area."}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical at first but the food was delicious, It also had a ice cream machine for free ice cream cones, You have to be direct about your food or they will probably mess up your order, If your a veteran or police officer they good deals some days"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in this location. It really deserves 2 stars, and looking at the other reviews, my experience was not an anomaly. Service was slow; they need more people working there; some employees were not friendly (though some were fine). I have been to other Dickey's locations and service was much better (friendlier, more professional, and faster.) My family and I got there at 6pm on a Sunday and waited a while in line, but we were lucky -- the line was to the door the entire time we were there, and moved very slowly. They were completely out of waffle fries, very low on the standard BBQ sauce, and out of the spicy. They ran out of ice cream, and after we finished we heard the employees telling customers they were out of macaroni and cheese. The location is small and tables are crammed together, and we had a hard time getting up to do anything (like get drinks). And since I eat chicken but not pork or beef, I'd appreciate if they didn't cut our chicken right on top of the mess from the other meats.  I will say that most of the food itself is fine; the chicken is tender; the BBQ sauce is good; the kids enjoyed some nuggets; we liked the stuffed baked potato. But the mac and cheese is awful; it's like cheese soup. And my son, who loves Caesar salad, took one bite of his and declared that he didn't like it; our youngest daughter (who also loves Caesar salad, and who hadn't heard our son express his distaste) took a bite and declared the same. I opted not to find out for myself.  Finally, it seems unfair that I could not couple the Groupon with the \"kids eat free on Sunday\" deal. We spent $12 on the Groupon, good for $24 only toward family packs; for that amount we would have gotten 2 adult meals and therefore 2 free kids' meals. And we still had to buy drinks. (Oh, and they were out of large cups.) So using the Groupon wasn't a good deal. We ended up separately buying the potato and a BBQ chicken sandwich (not a great deal at $5.50) to get the kids' meals free and took most of the family pack home. (Kids want nuggets; there's no way around that.)  There are other Dickey's locations that aren't too far. Or we'll go back to Joe's Real BBQ. (For the record, Tom's BBQ in Mesa is just ok; our favorite is Phil's in San Diego.)"}
{"text":"I was craving BBQ one day, so I pulled up my trusty Yelp app and found this place close by. The prices are a little expensive, but I figured it'd be okay to try it at least once. The guy at the counter helped me out with ordering and suggested I get the daily special to get a deal, since that's what I wanted anyway. It didn't take long for them to get my order ready and I took it to go.  The food was delicious, both the big barbeque sandwich and the sides of green beans with bacon, mac & cheese, fried okra, and waffle iron fries. It filled me up so much that I had to save the sides and eat them later that night.  Because the food is pricey, I wouldn't eat here often, but I wouldn't mind coming here every once in awhile to eat."}
{"text":"Placed an online order today. Showed up at little after the time it said it would be ready and it was not ready. After about 10mins, I was handed my order. I briefly checked my bag and noticed my 1/4lb chopped brisket was not in the bag. I told the guy at the register and the guy that made my order swore it was in the bag, looked at me like I was lying, and verified my receipt. I told him I checked and it was not in my bag. He handed me a box of sliced brisket instead. When I got home, I noticed the beef and cheese baker I ordered didn't have ANY beef (chopped brisket) and didn't have BBQ sauce or ranch dressing like I ordered and it was very bland. I mean how are you going to forget the beef on my beef and cheese potato? I don't think I'll be coming to this location again."}
{"text":"Not horrible but not the best I've ever had. Sauce is delish. Mac and cheese was mushy, beans were flavorless. Until I added BBQ sauce. Ribs were tender and nicely spiced. I like that they are just dry rubbed and not drenched in BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"I want to thank you for tonight. We walked in 17 min before closing. The let us finish our dinner. The food was delicious.  We will be  back."}
{"text":"First time there, glad I picked this location. Super clean & right off the bat we were greeted by a staff member advising us how to order. Very friendly & helpful. I got the jalapeno kelbasa with fried okra and potato casserole. Everything was delicious AND they had free self serve ice cream cones! I am usually not a big BBQ fan, but this place was good and you get alot for the price. Will def be back!"}
{"text":"This is my new go to spot when we don't have money for Lucille's ...LOL. Anyhow, came here for the first time today and I'm pretty happy. At first I see the price for the 'Rib Plate' and I thought 'oh man please be good!'  And I wasn't disappointed! My husband loves the beans, a little too much kick for me but still great flavor. He's from Texas so he know BBQ better than me. His pulled pork and brisket weren't 100% but he was still pretty satisfied. We left very full and happy. I love their drink cups cuz you can keep em! I plan on coming by on Tuesdays when the rib plate is on sale! Just hope the flavor doesn't change. And the staff was super nice! From the tall Caucasian guy that greeted us, to the brunette female with purple highlights and another older guy super nice. Very clean.  I didn't give it 5 stars becuz, I didn't see any WET WIPES!! Lol i guess I've been spoiled by other places after eating with my hands cuz how else am I supposed to enjoy the ribs.  Great job to staff!"}
{"text":"This review is for the new Dicky's on S. Rainbow Blvd. I pass this place on my way home from work everyday and since there are really no good BBQ places in Las Vegas I thought I should consider trying this place. I called a friend of mine that lives in Texas and asked him about this place and he said Dicky's is very good. This week I just happened to get a coupon in the mail for a buy1 get 1 free so I figured what better time to try. Me and my husband went in at 8:00 pm on a Sunday night. They close at 9:00 pm.There was no one in the place but when we entered we received a warm welcome from a man who seemed to be the manager. He asked us if we had ever eaten there and we said no. He immediate replied. Well you know what that means . You will be back again. I told him I really hope so. We then ordered. My husband got a huge baked potato with chopped brisket and cheese on top and I ordered the chicken. The man said they were out of chicken and ham. I then ordered the chopped  beef brisket and two sides. Mac & cheese and coleslaw. We decided to take our food home. The sweet tea is the bomb. The man who gave us our to go order advised us that since he didn't have the meat I requested in the beginning of my order he gave me extra meat to make up for it.he then thanked us and we said hope to see you again .once we got home and started to eat we couldn't believe how tender and delicious the beef brisket was. My husbands baked potato was huge and I had enough meat to feed two people. The Mac and cheese was great . The coleslaw was awesome. My husband kept eating my coleslaw.Overall from going into this place on a Sunday night an hour before they closed. They exceeded my expectation and have new customers for life. Cuddos to the African American guy behind the counter. He had a great attitude and  was a very helpful person. I look forward to going back  because of the customer service and the food. Good Job Dickey's"}
{"text":"The door was locked at 8:00??? We knocked and waited for the terribly rude girl at the cash register to open the door. Horrible, horrible absolutely horrible service.  Very poor food...french fries were rock hard.  Turkey had a very rubbery texture.  The tea was spoiled.  The ice cream was so soft.  The girl at the register did not speak to us she dropped our plates on the table and when we told of the bad tea she said \"oh well we are closed anyway\".  What a shame and an embarrassment for your establishment."}
{"text":"Wow so 3 years later and another Dickey's BBQ visit and this was so bad that I just threw the 2 Plate Combo out the brisket was dry and absolutely horrid and somehow the pulled pork the one BBQ product that is bulletproof was so dry it was crumbly. I am so sad as I remember Dickey's years ago in Georgia was awesome. The creamed spinach was fine but overall I would rather not wasted my time and money here."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is the worst BBQ I have had in the Phoenix AZ area. Horribly dry and stringy brisket, zero smoke ring, and really flat under-seasoned vinegar based sauce. I am actually sorry I wasted my time and money on this lunch today."}
{"text":"I've eaten at all of the Dickey's locations around Phoenix and this one is by far the best.  Thank God it's close to my home  .  The food and MGT are excellent here.  One employee in particular named Taylor is especially fantastic...Hard worker, friendly and personable...Keep up the great work...."}
{"text":"Again at work we have this delivery company called foodsby and I love it. Today all I wanted was a salad and I thought to myself ok well how hard is it to ruin a Ceaser salad. Well  I was wrong. Yes I know this place is a bbq place so you shouldn't expect too much with a salad but I expected a nice green salad. The chicken was ok, it wasn't dry at all. The croutons were put under the chicken so they were soggy by the time we received the salad. They included two containers of their bbq sauce...that was pretty good. I will be saving that for later, lol. I also order a side of mac n cheese for 2.50. The size was not as big as I expected and the flavor was just ok. Not a mind blowing mac and cheese. Needless to say do not order the salad if your wanting a good salad, maybe try the bbq."}
{"text":"So I don't eat much barbecue but this new place opened up right around the block from my house so I tried it and let me tell you everything on the menu is good we've been there more than once now and the staff is helpful suggesting what food is great we love it"}
{"text":"It sucks! We haven't been here in 4 or  5 months and I will never go back there ever again. We used to eat here a lot but we were taking a break. The food was horrible, the service was horrible and the place was a mess. There were no utensils, barely any ketchup in the bottles on the tables. We should have know there was a problem when on a Saturday night at 6 pm there was only one other family there. My husband only ate a few bites of his food when he found a piece of some kind of plastic wrap in it and then when I went into the restroom to wash my hands, someone had been smoking cigarettes in there I couldn't even breath it was so bad. We left, never to return."}
{"text":"I loved Dickeys. I got the two meat plate on one trip and the huge baked potato with chopped beef the next. The sliced brisket was very smokey and the turkey was amazing. The sides are average but they were about what I was expecting. They have BBQ sauce in warmers that was very flavorful. Unlike the other reviewer  i think Dickeys is head and shoulders above famous Dave's. Chopped beef is for sandwiches the sliced beef is better for the plates - it has a beautiful pink smoke ring! Made myself hungry - think I'll go there now :)"}
{"text":"I tried Dickey's at an event they catered.  I had two of the chopped beef sliders and covered them in the hotter of the BBQ sauces, some pickles, and some delicious onions - mmm.  Excellent.  I also had a delicious order of Cole Slaw and give that a great rating.  I tried a bag of their BBQ chips, and they were a little too strong on the MSG side of things.  Tasted a bit \"unnatural\".  Also I forgot the mention their super excellent service.  Yummmmm."}
{"text":"A bit disorganized but the food is an A+.  This location has fried okra so they definitely make my A list.  Food is fresh and really great.  I can easily see this location becoming a weekly stop for me!  Friendly folks, too!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food! PLENTY of meat,; coleslaw was amazing; loved the fried okra; pulled pork was tender and fantastic and you get free soft serve vanilla ice cream with your purchase. Loved the bread roll- nice and buttery. For the price,  you're getting a great bbq meal that is WELL worth it!"}
{"text":"One of the best BBQ places in town.   One of our favorite places to get pulled pork and brisket."}
{"text":"This place is bomb to the diggity. The pulled pork sandwich, waffle fries, and mac n cheese was stupendous. Place deserves 10 stars out of 5. Then fir the finally free ice cream."}
{"text":"A Model of Inefficiency.  My daughter and I had been eagerly waiting for the new Dickey's BBQ joint (3rd St. & Greenway) to open, so we took her 2 daughters and went on Sunday when \"Kids Eat Free.\"  When we arrived, the line was to the door and barely moved in 20 minutes.  During that time, we had ample time to study the menu and note that the ice cream machine was out of ice cream (in a brand new restaurant?).  When we finally got to the very cramped ordering station, the two servers seemed harried and confused.  One took our order and then slowly proceeded to chop and then painstakingly measure out each ounce of meat.  The other server attempted to fill to-go boxes behind the first server, which involved lots of close encounters as he scooped up meat and crossed back and forth behind her.    Finally, we were allowed to go to the next station to get our sides.  There were 3 girls there (I'll call them A, B and C.).  A asked what our sides were.  My daughter replies mac & cheese and baked beans, so A fills a cup with baked beans and tosses an empty cup to C to get the mac & cheese because it's too far for C to reach the cups.  Then A asks me what my sides were.  I replied cole slaw and potato casserole.  Ten seconds later A asks me again what my sides were (she had apparently forgotten within the last 10 seconds), so I repeated myself.  She filled a cup with cole slaw and handed a cup to B, who scooped up the mashed potatoes and put them in the cup.  Then B leans across in front of A to get chives and cheese to top the potatoes.  Then A asks which side we wanted for my daughter's 2 children.  We respond mac & cheese, so A tosses a cup to C to get the mac & cheese.  For the other side order, we responded French fries and were told that they were out of French fries.  (A BBQ joint without French fries?)  Disappointed, we got chips instead.  Squeezed between the 3 girls and the cashier was an older, grim-faced woman whose apparent sole job was to hand the trays to the customers.  An older gentleman stood next to her coaching the cashier.  We had ordered 2 adult meals, 2 kids meals and 4 drinks.  The kids meals were free.  Simple, right?  You would think I had asked the cashier to calculate the square root of Pi.  After several minutes of button pushing, she finally produced a receipt, so I handed her my debit card and we escaped to the relatively quiet outdoor patio.  In total, it took about 35 minutes to order and get our food.  While devouring our food--which was all quite tasty, by the way--I noted that the cashier had not fully discounted the kids meals, leaving them both 20 cents short.  My daughter and I joked that the sign should have read, \"Kids Eat Free on Sundays for a slight surcharge of 20 cents but don't expect any ice cream or French fries!\"  Seriously, we learned later that this new location has been open for two weeks, so they should have worked out the bugs by now.  To see a franchise restaurant this poorly managed was upsetting.  If they don't bring in a decent business manager who will streamline the ordering process, reduce the staff, expand the prep area, manage commodities and equipment, they will drive the customers away.  We saw lots of folks in line simply give up and walk out."}
{"text":"Last time I was here, the brisket sand which was the best ever! Today....kind of dried out. I'm not a big fan of the buttered bun. It looks too greasy to eat.. service has always been very good, but cashier has trouble making change. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! Pork, Beef Brisket, Chicken, Turkey and Sausage!!! Sides, Yum! Mac and cheese, bbq beans, Cole slaw, loaded potato casserole,  green beans, Okra, and many more! From sandwiches to Meat plates and Kid meals. My Favorite is their Bakers!!!! A Large Baked Potato with your choice of Meat, cheese and extras! I get the Brisket with cheese, bacon, tanglers with sour cream on the side! Soooo  worth the price! Yum! Coke products and Tea. To top it off Free  cones! Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Good food and good prices. Nice and paid back too. Stress free place to bring the kids and ice cream to end for all. The fried okra is so yummy and the brisket mmmmmmm. I love the different choices in BBQ sauce too."}
{"text":"Delicious Texas barbecue! Was a little taste of home and kids eat free every Sunday. Make sure you try the brisket, pulled pork sandwich, and sausage with a hearty side of fried okra. Desert is always available with complimentary soft serve vanilla ice cream. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I have to admit I was sad to see the former Arbys location go out if business. I anxiously waited to see what would be the replacement.   As soon as Dickey's opened, my interest peaked. I did not have time to go inside but went through the convienent drive thru. I ordered the Picnic Pack - 1lb. meat, with 2  sides, and 4 rolls. Ordering was easy and service was very friendly. The smell in the car driving home was amazing!   As soon as I unpacked, couldnt wait and just had to dig in. I ordered the beef brisket; sliced bot shredded (Delicious!), baked potato casserole  (AMAZING!) and asiago cheese creamed spinach (Extremely fantastic - even if not a spinach fan I was told!).  The sauce has the right amount of flavor.   Only negatives - they did not include my 4 rolls, this pack is a bit overpriced for the amount, and this pack is suppose to feed 2-4 people....I would say 2 people but not 4. Maybe I'd feel differently if I just had some rolls! :-(  With that said, I will go back since the selection of meats and sides makes my stomach quite curious!"}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago our daughter and son-in-law took us to their favorite BBQ place in Durham, NC. The food was fantastic and we were pleased when we found a Dickie's right in our own backyard here in the Phx area. Had lunch there yesterday. The food was consistant with the NC location but the service was not. Thus... 3 stars instead of more. I don't think the register girl knew how to speak.  Food and prices do warrant a return visit. Hopefully they will get their act together because they are a contender in the East Valley Barbeque restaurant market."}
{"text":"Even though this location doesn't have Fried Okra everything else is awesome!  Very clean restaurant with even a set up for large parties.  Restrooms are spotless. Good parking.  Super service with friendly folks!  Yum."}
{"text":"Eating here at random because we went to FedEx! It's freaking delicious! I usually get food like this from Whole Foods for waaaaay too much money. This food is delicious   Round 2: even better  Round 3: sooo good.  3 meat plate: pork, brisket, kielbasa No bread, double cole slaw"}
{"text":"Suppppppeerrrr good in love with the pulled pork salad to die for!!! Mac and cheese awesome"}
{"text":"We walked in at 4 pm on a Sunday.  There were 10 people in line and waited 15 minutes...  The line hardly moved so we left. Don't come here if you're used to the normal, quick, friendly Dickeys service."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, more food than I can eat on one regular plate and the best Sweet Tea outside of Texas.  The meat has a great slow smoked taste and the sides are always great.   THEY BROUGHT THE ICE CREAM MACHINE BACK!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know how this place has stayed in business the quality of the food I would get three stars. But the staff and cleanliness of the place knocks it down to two stars you don't slap someone's food together.I would not recommend this place for any barbecue matter-of-fact for anything go someplace else."}
{"text":"I wanted peach cobbler so bad that I remembered a BBQ joint was in the Walmart shopping center. Their has been 3 different BBQ joints at this location and all 3 where good. The only thing i didn't like was the ribs needed more sauce. I don't mind adding but I would like it cooked on. Service was fast and nice was greeted at the door and the guy behind the counter asked if I'm new and I told him yes and he told me what's the specials and how to order. Easy menu sweet tea was good too. But NO peach cobbler."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying out Dickey's.  Upon walking up to the door, I was greeted by the smell of smoked bbq which is always a good sign.  The inside is very nice but is a little tight in some spots.  I ordered the brisket, which was pretty good. The sides were average.  The Mac and Cheese was very thick. It tasted like instant MAC and Cheese and did not have the originality I've come to enjoy at most bbq joints.  The potato salad was average as well.  I will say the iron waffle fries were very good.  I took a few from a coworker.  I think you should definitely check this place out.  It's nice to have a bbq joint in Ballantyne by the office park"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great BBQ. Would Definately recommend. The smoked ham is great, as are the side dishes."}
{"text":"Since Dickey's has opened in Scottsdale, I have stopped by at least once a week to pick up a Picnic Basket to take home to dinner for my family.  Last week I stopped by and drove through the drivethru.  I ordered the usual Picnic Basket and when I pulled up to the window, the guy handed me a bill for $28.  I called him back and said that there was a mistake because the Picnic Basket was $20.  With that, he told me that they had raised their prices but hadn't changed the prices on the drivethru billboard, and that he would not honor what the price on the board said.  I asked for a manager and he said that he was neither the manager nor the owner, and he would cancel my order.  When I asked that he honor the posted price, the said \"No, I'll just cancel the order.\"  Bad for business to lose a customer over a few dollars, especially when the prices on the board had not been changed.  Very disappointed!"}
{"text":"Amazing tenderness of pulled pork.  3 great bbq sauces to pick from.  Loved the slaw.  Beans were on the sweet side."}
{"text":"Dickie's catered an event in my neighborhood--the food was all outstanding! Loaded mashed potatoes, baked beans, coleslaw, and pulled pork were so good; I'll definitely be going to their brick and mortar restaurant!"}
{"text":"COMPLETELY OVERPRICED and very little portions.the food is average.nice staff however."}
{"text":"This place was great when they opened but service and quality of food has gone down hill since. Only reason to return is for the okra."}
{"text":"Purchased food using a Group On. First was impressed with the staff. They provided great and fast service for the amount of food we purchased. Picked up food for 18 people. The food was excellent and great tasting. We covered the majority of meats they had to offer. The BBQ wasn't overly smokey which tends to happen at many places. Definitely will come back here for BBQ. Great place if you are getting good for a large group."}
{"text":"Slowest place to get BBQ food. Hell, I went in at 6:30, 7pm rolled around, and I was still standing in line. 7:10 came around, and I just said forget it and left the place. This place has no urgency to the customers. Did I mention that I wasn't the only one that left? 2 groups of 3 left the place as well. If you want to waste an hour in line, then this is the place, if not, then I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Dickey's is great BBQ! Ron, the GM is always friendly and welcoming. The pulled pork is my favorite paired with waffle fries and onion tanglers! Make sure to try out the different kinds of BBQ sauce... I prefer the spicy! The meats are always fresh and the ribs are some of the best! Careful though... Your clothes will come out smelling like a smokehouse!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Great barbecue! Very generous portions and fair pricing! I've interacted with the staff and the manager there several times. They are always extremely pleasant and personable. Haven't had anything there I don't like. All great! Free ice cream cones for everyone and good specials for children. I had them cater an event wants and it was fantastic! Portions were larger than I expected and they were right on time! My guest loved The food! I will definitely use them again!!!"}
{"text":"I've never had a worse experience at a Dickey's before. I placed an online order. Arrived 20 minutes later for my pick up and was told it was not ready. I waited another 20 minutes for mu food which I took back to my office to eat. I open it up to find my order was wrong and the meat i was given was barely cooked enough to be safe enough to eat. There was nothing \"BBQ\" about it. Flavorless, fatty, chewy and slimy brisket. Bland sausage. Terrible in comparison of what I've come to expect of this company. I would say this is the most expensive unappealing lunch I've had."}
{"text":"Had a great meal with the family and was delighted with our server Nicky. He was pleasant and courteous. He made wonderful suggestions which led to a wonderful meal everyone was satisfied with. With service like this we will be back!! What a nice young man!!! Yummy food"}
{"text":"I love BBQ - I mean really love BBQ. I can honestly say I LOVE the flavor and tenderness of the meat. Portions are good size. Very little if any fat found in my sandwich - that's always a plus for me. I always feel welcomed and appreciated at each visit. We love it so much we average visiting once a week!"}
{"text":"The food is really good, but, mercy, they are really slow on the service.  Don't get me wrong, their staff is friendly, but slow.  And for goodness sakes, turn on the air conditioner."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times and it's always been great..The friendly staff and handsome owner are great additions to the food!    ;)"}
{"text":"Amazing! The restaurant is pretty awesome!  If you like BBQ this is the place for you! The menu has great options and varieties.   Along with the BBQ and giant cups, they offer free ice cream!!   Sweet!"}
{"text":"When the owner of the franchise has the customer service skills of an angry ape, it's no suprise fellow yelpers are down on this place. Purchased food through the drive through a while back and the order was filled incorrectly. So went back to the store, and after dealing with the manager just wanted a refund. He refused to provide a refund because he said we were rude. Ended up leaving food at the counter and walking out the store. Not worth the time, maybe Dickie's corporate will take it back."}
{"text":"Just strolled in there today. Been meaning to try and WOW this is good (Las Vegas) barbque. Good job John! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Decent BBQ, but atrocious service. Waited in line for nearly 30 minutes for no real reason. When I finally got to the cashier, I didn't even receive all of my food. Food isn't good enough to justify service this bad."}
{"text":"First thing, this location is a tight squeeze; there is a couple of pinch points where you will run into other people easily (i.e. drink machine).  The prices are what one would expect in the Ballantyne area; however they do not accept the Ballantyne Card yet, so no discount if you work in the area.  The order setup is different but manageable.   After two visits, I have tried their Smoked Sausage (good), bbq pork (okay) and brisket (could be better).  I also typically order fries and okra, which they make to order, but have to wait while you already have your meats on the plate.  My biggest problem was the brisket (supposedly what they are known for); I had it chopped and a good quarter of it was just fat, not edible.  Overall, I really expected something good here, but I feel let down instead.  With nearby barbecue places that offer better value and better food, I don't see myself visiting Dickey's voluntarily for lunch again."}
{"text":"Good food served quick. That's a great synopsis of Dickey's Barbecue Pit. Third time here, so finally able to get a fair review out there. Having been to some authentic bbq places throughout the south, I can say Dickey's ranks right up there with the best of them...which says a lot for a chain restaurant. The look and feel has a relaxed southern feel to it and the music helps a lot. I walked in today and The Allman Brothers are singing 'Sweet Melissa'! Talk about ambience! LOL  Obviously we're here for the food though. You have a good number of choices, meat plates (5 different sizes inc. a rib plate), sandwiches (3 sizes w/ choice of 7 different meat), baked potatoes, and salads....yes, salads! Some options come with a choice of sides but most are ala carte. There are 12 different side options. I have to say, I have become partial to the pulled pork, having tried five of the various meat options. The Westerner sandwich gives you two meat choices, which makes it easy to give the options a try in just a few visits. The thing I like best is they don't drown the meats in a wave of sauce, one of my big turn-offs at most bbq joints. A separate counter has three different sauce choices which allows you to decide how much to put on your meal....and subsequently on your shirt.   The pi√©ce de r√®sistance? Free ice cream cones at the end of your meal!! (dine in only however) Definitely give Dickey's a try the next time you have a hankering for some good ole down-home bbq. You might even get to hear Buck Owens over the stereo!"}
{"text":"Not the best BBQ. . .but definitely not the worst either.  =)  I'm originally from Texas and in Texas I would not set foot inside of Dickey's as there are far better BBQ places all over Texas.  But here in Vegas. . .my choices are limited.  LOL    1 star for great friendly service.  Yes the manager might not be the best but the people that were carving the brisket, sausage, chicken, turkey etc both times I have been have had that southern hosipitality that you look for in a BBQ joint.  =)  Next Star for consistency in their quality.  Both times I have gone, brisket was juicy.  Turkey and chicken were both very tender and moist.  Jalapeno Sausage was on point.  =)  Fried Okra. . .OMG was da bomb!  =)  I mean come on, anything fried is always good in my book.  LOL  ;P  Third star was for the cleaniness of the place.  It was clean and smelled like smoke.  =)   AND if you are not sure of what to order, ask them for a taste.  They will give you a generous portion to try it out.  =)"}
{"text":"Well let me start by saying the food we got today was amazing. Me and my hubby ordered the two meat plate with the chopped brisket and the Turkey. I got the Turkey sandwich and our sides were bbq beans, mac and cheese,  and the potatoe casserole. Everything was delicious and the spicy bbq sauce made everything just a tad better. My only complaint is that the service sucked. Upon walking in no greeting or nothing. The girl who was cutting the meat was not friendly and after I came in they were about 3 people behind me and she said to the other girl I'm not taking them so you better do it. Service is a big part for any establishment and it looked like they're was only teenagers working today at around 7 30 PM. I'd be back for the food but for the service most likely not. Not even a hello or thank you or anything."}
{"text":"Had the two meat plate yesterday night with pork ribs and the brisket. It was too good and a lot of food for 12 dollars. Would definitely go again"}
{"text":"I had never been into Dickey's before and didn't know what to expect. I went in about 20 minutes to close and while there was a smaller selection of sides, the food was amazing; I was pleasantly surprised considering it was the end of the day and the food was still fresh. However, I want to focus this review on the staff that helped me. I was unsure what to get, as I wanted a smaller portion of ribs. I was informed on what the staff suggested and was pleased (the one meat plate). And while I decided to get my order to go, I was assured not to worry about the time. They were in good spirits and happy to help me, telling to me to take my time. I will definitely be back to this location next time I'm craving barbecue- Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Portions are not the normal size compared to other franchise owned locations. This is a big bad red flag. The owner of this franchise is guilty of skimping. How can Dickeys corporate let this go on?? I'm sure no one will ever contact me but this is the last time we eat at this location.  All meat plates and sandwich were definitely on the short side yesterday. 2nd time this has happened. How is this a fair proposition?  Ordered online and still had to wait 25 minutes when arriving. What's the point of online ordering?  People were walking out of this place and taking their money elsewhere since the staff is not adequately staffed to serve a Friday or Saturday evening customer levels. Way to go franchise owner...you probably lost at least $100 in five minutes from those two groups.  This place cracks me up. The trays are greasy, no ice, no ice cream, no forks. This location couldn't stock air from the atmosphere if they wanted to.   Thanks to this franchise owner, Dickeys on Power Road will not be a place we visit often.   Anybody from Dickeys corporate read this? Will you force the owner to not skimp on portions and create fair value for their customers?"}
{"text":"This is our new favorite BBQ date night!  The staff is so  friendly, it's close (but not quite) as good as the TN BBQ from my youth... and free ice cream !!!.  We have tried several menu items but my fave so far is their baked potato with fixins. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"The food at Dickey's is pretty good for a franchise. It's sort of like the Pei Wei of bar.b.q.  Their brisket is moist and flavorful. The spicy cheddar kielbasa is good as well.  I'm not a fan of St. Louis ribs but if you like them theirs are not bad.  The sides are average.  A family owns it and runs it so their kids are around doing their homework in the back.   The service is friendly and they did one of our Holiday dinners this year and everything was tasty and fresh.  It's not Frashers but it's also a lot closer.  It's also pretty cheap for what it is, especially if you get the Managers special of the day.  We always get more than we can eat.  The place is like the Chipotle of BBQ without the e-coli problems.   My favorites.  Brisket, Kielbasa, Pulled Pork."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and some very tasty offerings. John the owner is a sweetheart. They have great daily specials. My favorite is the ribs with fried okra and onion tangles. Try it you'll like it."}
{"text":"Well this is the first time and the last time we will try this place. It smelled awesome when we walked in. I decided to get the two meat plate (chicken,pulled pork) with two sides (load bake potato, fried okra) and a drink. My husband got the two meat sandwich (brisket, pulled pork) and two sides (fresh dill potato salad, coleslaw) to GO!! When we got home we were shorted a side my fried Okra!! They gave us to little containers of BBQ sauce which was not enough since the items were very dry. For my plate it was 10.50 and the portions were very small as well as my husbands sandwhich. We could have gone to Famous Daves and gotten better BBQ for lunch and cheaper. Since we were not happy with the food and know we are not going back we did not call and tell them of our missing side."}
{"text":"I love love love Dickeys , the night crew is amazing ! Especially Kyli , she is very helpful and sweet . Her attitude makes you want to come back , she remembers my order and is genuinely kind . Only 3 stars because the day people are horrible ! I've been here around lunch time before and they make you repeat your order 10 times , it's very frustrating . I asked for 3 meant plate and paid for 3 meat and it looks like only 2. Kyli deserves 5 stars at night ."}
{"text":"Our office got lunch from Dickey's 1-2 times a week for years, then it changed ownership and the service plummeted. We haven't gone for about a year, so today I suggested we try them again. BIG mistake. Two women were working and were crabby as all get-out. One asked if I wanted pickles and onions on the sandwiches and I said, \"Yes on both of them please.\" The other told me she would put my receipt in the bag. Got back to work and the sandwiches had NO pickles or onions and of course, there was no receipt in the bag. We won't be back - just way too many other options in this town where your patronage is appreciated."}
{"text":"best so far... good service as well & FREE SOFTSERVE !!! yummyy ...definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Took my son here to give it a try last week. There was only one person on line in front of us, but it still took 15 minutes to place our order. There were three staff working and none of them seemed happy to be there. After paying for our order we went to get our drinks and the ice machine was broken, why we were not told about it before paying for drinks I don't know. The food here is good and tasty. The reason I will never return is the service is absolutely horrible. If the service doesn't improve this place will not stay in business."}
{"text":"First time visitor, stopped for lunch. Service was quick and food was tasty. Fried okra was by far our favorite side. Brisket was okay but not amazing. Loved the original sauce and portions were generous."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite barbecue place, but it has definitely gone down hill. They completely changed the menu.....there are no more plates son everything is separate now. They no longer carry any fried foods, so goodbye okra. And they no longer carry jalape√±o beans, one of the best side dishes they had. The staff here, every time I've gone, are not friendly. This is the first time I have walked into dickies and walked out empty handed. What's disappointment....."}
{"text":"Foods always great, nice people cant wait till next visit, thx dan"}
{"text":"My brother suggested this place because its one of his favorites. The free ice cream & pickles were delicious, I was NOT impressed with the BBQ.  It's was very greasy & the sauce was mediocre. They have 3 types: original, spicy & sweet. Unfortunately they all tasted the same and all I could taste was ketchup and a hint of spice. The mashed potatoes were awesome I do recommend them as a side. I would only eat here again if someone else was paying."}
{"text":"This place was great! Had the pulled pork and sides! Tried a few sauces and sweet tea, everything was fabulous! Eric the manager was super nice and everyone was friendly. Going to have to make this my go to for BBQ ! YUM!"}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan. The food good. The service is very quick and friendly. The hand crafted lemonade and free unlimited soft serve ice cream really set this place apart from the competition."}
{"text":"Decent but not spectacular BBQ. The food is on the pricy side for the quality you're getting.   The sides are EXTREMELY sub-par, and none are likely made from scratch. The mac & cheese is not good - has that fake (kraft cheese powder) look and taste. The green beans taste straight-out-of-the-can.   Take your kids for free on whatever day that is - but don't spend a lot of money or expect a quality food experience."}
{"text":"Driven by several times so thought I would check the place out.  Ordered rib plate and a 1/2 lbs of brisket to go.  Also got a side of fried okra and bbq beans.  Place was empty with only 3 customers and the service was adequate.   Ribs were tasty fall off the bone meat and the bbq beans also tasty.  The brisket on the other hand was complete garbage.  I don't know if it was sitting in a holding bin all day, probably was, but it was aweful.  Dry as bone, no smoke ring or smoke taste and chewy as hell.  I have fed it to my dog over the last 2 days and she loved it.  Ribs good, brisket horrible.  Worse than horrible an offence to the word bbq brisket.  Hell a sandwich chain that rhymes with scharmbies has brisket that is 100% better than what I got.  I will never be back even though the ribs were good."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim and fell in love! Immediate fan of their pulled pork and BBQ sauce. The restaurant is set up like chipotle (fast casual). You order and pay for your food up front. There's cool new country tunes playing with dim lights that make for a calm relaxing dinner. Glad we stumbled upon this one."}
{"text":"I was lured into this store through the succulent aroma from their smokin' BBQ! I'm not a huge BBQ fan but I do appreciate good BBQ when I crave for it.   It was hard to decide what to order for the first time since they had so many tasty sounding dishes. Well, I decided to try a little bit of whatever I was feeling and save the left overs for later.   Meat Orders:  Sliced Beef Brisket: Wowsers! Meat just rips apart with no effort, mild but evident smokey beefy flavor.. Just smother their bbq sauce and enjoy!  Pulled Pork: A mound of thinly shredded pork, doesn't explode with flavor but has a good sublte porky taste to it  Polish Sausage: Plain ol' sausage goodness. comes sliced and doesn't need any sauce to accompany it  Side Orders:  Green Beans with Bacon: When I saw Bacon I was sold! Goes great with the green beans  Baked Potato Casserole: Its like a Baked potato thats been mashed. Goes hand in hand with any of the meats mentioned above  Macaroni & Cheese: simply a southern comfort side you can't go wrong with  * Their Deli Style PIckles bathed in their jumbo jar aren't bad  and their Bread/Dinner Rolls are so buttery, a must have!  I like their original bbq sauce but their spicy wasn't bad either. I Defiinitely recommend all of the above mentioned but most of all their Sliced Beef Brisket.. MMMMMMmmmMMMMM!!"}
{"text":"OMG.... the staff was amazing and so was the food. Im stuffed. Me, hubby and son enjoyed ourselves to the fullest!"}
{"text":"The pulled pork and Mac & cheese is delicious. They have free self serve ice cream too which I love! You should come here and the staff is friendly. When I went they answered questions about the menu and gave suggestions because I couldn't decide what to order. Overall a good experience and great place to go to."}
{"text":"Before I begin, let's put this in perspective, ok?  Dickey's is a chain, and I don't particularly care for chains.  Two years ago, we visited the Dickey's up on Shea, and had an immediate adversion to the place. The brisket was tough, the sides were mediocre, and the people that worked there looked like they could've cared less...about anything.  Today, I visited Dickey's for the second time, but in a new location, close to home.  I was starving, craving ham, and wanted to check it out, you know...in case I contracted a hangover some day and needed some immediate BBQ relief (this is kind of a joke). I had the 1 Meat Plate, with ham, and tried the BBQ beans and cole slaw for sides. Pretty good. Better than the other BBQ place I recently reviewed close to home.  Not as good as Joe's in Gilbert (no where near Joe's perfection) but pretty damned good.  The line is substantial since their opening a few days ago, and the place is small, but nice personnel that are eager to please, and pretty damned good BBQ... I'll be back..."}
{"text":"ok BBQ HAVE had better but this isn't kansas dorothy... small portion for a 13$ lunch."}
{"text":"Picked up dinner to go. I have had Dickey's before but this was my first visit to this location. I chose the two meat plate with Brisket and the pork ribs. For sides, I had the loaded mashed potatoes and the green beans. The meat was as good and just as tasty as the other locations. The brisket was not dry, had great flavor, and coupled with there BBQ sauces was delicious. The pork ribs were easy to eat as the meat pulled right of the bone. For the amount, there was a sizable portion of brisket, and while pretty meaty, there were only 2 ribs in the serving. The loaded mashed potatoes were great. I really enjoy these, and they didn't disappoint. The green beans tasted too peppery, so they didn't taste as good as last time, but I think this was just a one off. Overall, a solid meal with leftover brisket for another day."}
{"text":"Well here we are again with another free sandwich yearly review. In this review, I uncover how you should speak up and get your food served and not get grossed out. Dude has rubber gloves on glistening with the pulled pork he just pulled and then it's my turn to order. He is about to handle my chicken breast with those same gloves, so I request a glove change. Then he is about to cut my chicken amongst the pork juices on his cutting board, but I tell him to get a new cutting board. He also tried to put my bun in those same pork juices. According to him (and was nice), nobody has ever complained about this disgusting situation. Finally after all my corrections, I enjoyed a good chicken breast sandwich minus the pork juice."}
{"text":"Friendly service but the food was just meh. Had the two meat plate with Barbeque beans and Mac & Cheese. Had the pulled pork and beef brisket. Pulled pork was OK but was flavorless. The sauces didn't really help as they all tasted too vinegary and watery. Beef Brisket was probably 40% fat which turned me off. The Barbeque Beans though. Whew! I could eat those all day everyday. Fresh Lemonade was amazing and they did give me A-1 service with a smile."}
{"text":"Won't come back here. Everything I wanted to order, they didn't have. Should probably put a sign in the window or something to let people know NOT to waste their time attempting to eat here. Aside from that, it was HOT in the restaurant. The thermostat is near where you order and it said 95!"}
{"text":"This USED to be a good place to get barbecue - until they decided to put everything a la carte.  You could get a combo meal at a decent price.  Now everything has to be purchased separately, which significantly drives up the price.  We used to come here quite often, but on our last visit, took one look at the menu and drove to Famous Dave's.  You've lost our business."}
{"text":"My family really enjoys dickeys. We have been here 4 or 5 times since they opened. The ribs are fantastic. My son always goes for the ham plate which is excellent as well.   One thing both my wife and I enjoy is the onion straws. They were excellent! The owner and manager are very nice as are the employees. Always great service   The drive through takes a little longer as you have to wait for waffle fries"}
{"text":"Tried this place for lunch on Monday. They had the $2 special BBQ Chicken Sandwich. I was expecting a tiny slider style sandwich but it was as big as any sandwich you'd find at McD's. The chicken had a nice smoky taste to it and was moist and slathered with good amount of sauce. The dickey's sauces are also delicious, with sweet, spicy and regular. I'll have to try their meat plate combinations next time. To finish off the meal, try the free vanilla ice cream! Can't go wrong with free!   Tip: If you subscribe to their VIP club beforehand, you'll get a coupon for free Large Dickey's Cup!"}
{"text":"We eat lunch here at least once if not three times a month.  The monday lunch special pulled pork sandwich.  What we really like is the zippy bbq sauce, different sides and ice cone for desert."}
{"text":"Food! Atmosphere! Service! FOOD!! What can I say that isn't summed up in my very first words of this review? We were looking for a place to have lunch, and decided to stop here. What a wonderful choice!!! Casual dining doesn't get any better than this. I tried the signature ribs with a salad and baked beans as side dishes. Generous portions of delicious Southern cooking! The staff is just like a scene from \"Mayberry USA\", friendly as can be! Did I mention how good the FOOD is??? - Daily Specials and a diverse menu, with many possible combinations await the hungry fan of good home cookin'. Easy on the wallet and an overall 5 Star dining experience! We will be back, ya'all!!!"}
{"text":"We were out shopping for and found this new bbq place and it turned out to be so yummy. How I know we'll go back other than the taste of the food and great service? Our kids who normally don't eat anything chowed down on the food. The way they set up how you order is Co venient, the ambiance is relaxing and the prices were fairly good!  The people behind the counters were super friendly. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad they finally got an ice cream machine! And and onion tanglers! The meat is pretty good, love the original sauce. The sides are pretty good too! I like the Mac and cheese and potato casserole, my husband loves the tanglers. We love going on Sundays when kids eat free. Nice to have a location so close to home."}
{"text":"We tried Dickey's BBQ today and really enjoyed it.  At first, I was a little scared they were going to burn the place down with a paper bag on their stove.  I kept watching it to see if it would go up in flames and had to shake my head when the guy took it off the stove to find it smoldering and had to take care of that.   We ordered meals for each person and tried out the ribs, sliced beef and pulled pork.  We were impressed that the meat was cooked just right and very tender.  The flavor was good and the bbq sauce was tasty and had a little bit of a kick. The macaroni and cheese was tasty, the waffle fries were good (but needed more salt) and the fried okra was tasty but a few were undercooked.  Overall, we were very happy and will return again!  They were friendly and I even got a free drink because I signed up for their e-mail list."}
{"text":"i was very disappointed i ordered a half slab of ribs to go just to see what they tasted like because  i have never been to dickeys before. well the good things first . the people that worked there were very nice; thats about it. the ribs were dry hardly any bbq sauce on them even though i asked for extra sauce. no bbq flavor at all . they tasted like they were cooked in an oven . i paid $14 for a half slab of ribs what a joke."}
{"text":"Good food, and a cute atmosphere. They even warmed up our food when it got cold. Huge portions with an excellent price. I would recommend it to anyone who wants barbecue at a decent price"}
{"text":"Today, my husband and I came to Dickey's and had a wonderful experience. The staff was so friendly and asked if we had any questions about the menu. They offered Texas Toast to try and my husband loved it! I loved the atmosphere! The manager on shift today was so kind and you could tell that he was happy to serve! His team echoed that, too, with their \"Welcome to Dickey's\". This is definitely a go-to for us! Highly recommend.   The manager's name is Trevor! Super awesome guy!"}
{"text":"Had such a great lunch with my kids here today! Staff was very friendly and helpful as this was my first time here. Food was fresh fast and delicious! Definitely will return again!"}
{"text":"Picnic family pack is a great value. Brisket was good and moist. Mac and cheese are very creamy. Green beans are good. Free ice cream for dessert!"}
{"text":"This is a good place to go with the family. The food is good and fresh. The staff is nice and helpful. As long as you eat in the restaurant, it's good. I don't recommend taking it home. It can get cold and isn't nearly as good. This is one of my wife favorite places. This isn't the best BBQ place in town, but it's pretty good considering it's a chain."}
{"text":"It was like a real outdoor bbq, complete with flies everywhere. Only problem, we were sitting inside! Gross. Food was okay but I was too grossed out by the flies. Won't return. Doubt this place will last."}
{"text":"The beans are the bomb! (My picky eater) Okra is my favorite & I love the variety of sauce Melts in your mouth along with ice cold sweet tea"}
{"text":"Solid bbq with delicious sides.  I'm always a little wary of a chain BUT this is different - mostly because as you open the door to walk in the lovely smell of meat smoked perfectly in some wood chips de heaven hit your nostrils.    I didn't want to take up limited room in the tummy with a bun so I opted for the meat plate - pulled pork and brisket - both tasty, not fatty and falling apart tender.  I got the jalape√±o beans (could be hotter) so toss some hot n spicy sauce in them & the loaded potato casserole (de-Lish!) they asked if I wanted to up charge for cornbread - who would ever say no to that! - and don't because it's good!   Now get your big yellow cup - fill it with some tiny ice and sweet tea and make your way to the hot (you read that right - hot/warmed) sauce choices - I like the hot n spicy - but the weak heaters will love the sweet bbq as well.  Now when you walk to your table know a few things - there are napkins on the table as well as ketchup, yes that ice cream is free and you are gonna need a wet nap - now DIG in!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite BBQ here in North Las Vegas, the food has always been sooo good! My only complaint had been the fact that they are stingy with their bbq sauce. After all, who wants to spend $65 on bbq and have to go to the store and buy bbq sauce to eat with your leftovers???? We always order the 6 pack and an extra side of kielbasa to feed the whole family for a couple of days. Today after we placed our order, (including our request for EXTRA BBQ Sauce) they called because they \"were out of brisket.\" Even though we were all disappointed, the brisket is EVERYONES favorite meat, we decided to go ahead with our order and substitute chicken instead. This wound up being a huge mistake on my part, because the chicken is fatty, and rubbery, and just not very good. Had I known I would have cancelled our order, or doubled up on something else that I know we like. Again we purchased over $65 worth of food and received 1 container of bbq sauce. A little larger container than last time, but not by much. I'm not sure we'll order food from here again or look for another place to get our BBQ that is more consistent with their quality and quantity. Definately disappointed."}
{"text":"No BBQ sauce.... Purchased $90 worth of bbq via Grubhub. When it arrived it was cold, so we microwaved it. Didn't get the 4 cookies we ordered, didn't get the dressing for the Cesar salad, and didn't get a single drop of bbq sauce."}
{"text":"Loved this place! We did not expect to be super impressed, but we were! Good amount of food, the BBQ was great and sides were delicious.. Fun atmosphere and friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Dickey's is traditional Texas barbecue. I had the pulled pork and beef brisket with baked beans and coleslaw. The barbecue sauces are not added and not cooked in. You need to add your own sauces to your own taste. People who say this food is too mild or tasteless are people who don't know how to season their own food. They slow cook the meat until it is perfect and still tender. You then add your own barbecue sauce, which you can dipper as much sauce as you want. They have Dickey's house sauce and a spicy sauce. They have a lot of free stuff. Gigantic dill pickles or jalapeno peppers in large jars, extra large souvenir cups for a self-serve drinks. There is a soft-serve vanilla ice cream dispenser for the customers to self-serve themselves with small cups or ice cream cones. Their biscuits are tasty too, and fresh-baked. This is only for people who like barbecue and can season their own. If you want the sauce added for you then go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is okay bbq fare but there is nothing special about it.  Their sauces are bland.  The food has no great flavors and tastes overly microwaved or possibly like it came in a bag from Sysco.  They give you too much food and the prices reflect the portion sizes.    I've had the ribs and pulled pork sandwiches.  Both were meh...nothing special to write home about.    I wouldn't make this a destination but if you have other things to do while shopping at Norterra...it isn't a bad choice, just a VERY mediocre one."}
{"text":"No beef ribs? Forget it, this ain't a Q place.  Where are the guys chopping hickory? How do they actually smoke anything?  $$$ to high for a hole in the wall prefab Q place.  (Sort of an update) My wife said the above was unfair if I had not even tried the food so she brought me some to make an informed opinion. So here it is:  The brisket was dry and the smoke taste was I think injected, I could not locate a smoke ring. The ribs were drown in sauce and for good reason, the hog was overcooked, sad. The sides were nothing to cheer about, I have had better beans and slaw from Walmart, and that is truly sad.   The original single star is exactly the same after eating the food. I may have made some assumptions based on what i saw when I walked in the first time, but I seem to have been right. Still looking for great Q in Vegas. (There is good Q, but still looking for great Q.)"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered the 3 meat plate. We both ordered the pulled pork and spicy cheddar sausage. I had the beef brisket and he had the ham for our third meat.  Neither one of us liked the sausage but it wasn't bad and my husband finished all his.  The food was good but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. I had the peach cobbler with their soft served ice cream and again it was good but nothing spectacular.  Staff was friendly and service was good.  Overall it was a good experience but not great."}
{"text":"I was really hoping is finally found good bbq relatively close to me.   While not completely disappointed, I'm not totally thrilled with this place either.   Walking in, I had hope. The place smells like a genuine pit bbq joint. But that's about it.   The brisket sandwich I had was good, and the meat tender, but there just wasn't much flavor. I do like a smoky brisket.  moving on..  There are three types of bbq sauce here. \"Original\" \"sweet\" and \"spicy\". I didn't try the sweet. Unfortunately, I mixed up the cups of original and spicy so I didn't know which was which. And I never found out either. Both had the same bland store bought taste.   Bummer.   I had a side of \"creamy cole slaw\" which was fairly decent. I'd prefer a little more kick but it was ok.   The last thing I had was the house made \"sweet tea\". Unfortunately, it tasted very watered down.   On a better note, the atmosphere is nice, the place was fairly clean and the service was pretty good.   I do wish the portion sizes were a little Bigger.   That's why this place earns a solid 3 stars from me."}
{"text":"I used to spend my summers back east in a small town in western Tennessee. There, near Reelfoot Lake was a family run shack of a barbecue restaurant that is still the greatest barbecue I have had to this day.   Dickey's comes awful close.   I got the daily special (a huge pulled pork sandwich with two sides, the classic barbecue beans and mac & cheese for me.) The pulled pork was great in flavor and consistency, there was no strings of fat - an instant turnoff and a problem with many other local barbecue places - and it was good enough to be eaten without sauce. But where's the fun in that when Dickey's offers three varieties.  I tried all three and have to say the spicy was the best. The sweet was a close second. The original was just that - original and kind of plain. The spicy has a bit of a kick, so be warned.   The barbecue beans were great - not too sweet and very smokey tasting. A guaranteed choice upon return.  The person I ate with tried one of their potatoes with pulled pork. Again, excellent, though the potato was a little dry. Slathering it with more spicy barbecue sauce did the trick, but be prepared for a lot of potato. The crispy cooked onions that go on the top were except and added texture. Overall pretty darn good.  Finally, we split their peach cobbler. As good as homemade? Pretty darn close. I eat a lot of cobbler spending time in the South. A good cobbler isn't chewy and gummy. This was excellent in consistency and taste. Free ice cream to add at your discretion was an added bonus.  I'm no self-professed barbecue expert, but I enjoyed Dickey's and will definitely be returning - Southern family in tow!"}
{"text":"I understand this is a chain but it's no excuse. I got the 3 meat plate, brisket, pork ribs, and jalape√±o cheese sausage. The brisket was chopped and very dry, for a plate it should be slices not chopped. The pork ribs were also dry and somewhat tough. The sausage was spot on and I would order again but sorry it's not enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"Food dry as cardboard.  Staff pushy to get you out the door.  Interrupt you while you're ordering so you'll order faster, which takes even longer.  Food and service not good and it should being how new these places are."}
{"text":"I have died and (literally) gone to hog heaven. Great food (ribs, brisket, sausage, sides, etc). Quick service & Eric the manager  very helpful with us newbies."}
{"text":"One of my favorite \" fast food BBQ \" joints here in the valley. The gf and I usually come on wed/ thur for their daily deals, which is typically a sandwich or meat combo with two sides and the big yellow cup ( I have over 10 at home ) the combos are priced at 9.50, not bad for the generous portions you receive .  The staff here never forgets to take their happy pill lol please share with me next time :) , but seriously all jokes and puns aside  they're so friendly and one gentleman in particular always walks around to see how you're enjoying your food and if you need anything . Food is always fresh and tasty !   They offer 3 different BBQ sauces - spicy, original and sweet. All different and tasty.  When I pick my sides I always choose  the fried okra and BBQ beans, because duh? The okra and the beans though!!!If you're still hungry after your feasting enjoy their complimentary self serve ice cream station !"}
{"text":"This place is awesome they have good prices and also free ice cream and amazing sausage and pulled pork. I'm gonna go back and try everything on the menu.  They have really good and small crushed ice and really fast service. I really like this spot and I'm gonna keep going back. They have good music"}
{"text":"So today at work was safety meeting day. For lunch Dickey's CRAP B Q was delivered to us. We had pork spare ribs, BBQ chicken breast, ham, Mac and cheese and beans. One word ALWAYS comes to mind when I think of Dickey's, \"DISGUSTING\".   A few observations I have about this so called \"BBQ\"  You never see a smoke ring on ANY of the meat. No smoke taste, ever. Drowning food in BBQ sauce does NOT make it BBQ.  I ask of anyone to tell me if you have ever seen smoke coming from any Dicky's restaurant? I sure haven't!! This is because IT'S NOT REALLY BBQ!  Several co-workers and I started to feel ill a couple hours after lunch. Must have been the semi warm baked chicken breast swimming in a gallon of sauce, or maybe it was the bone dry ham, could have been the so called Mac and cheese. What ever it was, I will never eat Dicky's wanna be Q again!!"}
{"text":"Food was good. This was our first time being there. I would work on your customer service.. the order takers act like they didn want to be there..  kids portions are a little small for the amount you pay.. the free ice cream was a plus.. in all I would try it again.."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good BBQ, look elsewhere. If you are looking for reheated meats and microwaved sides, keep reading. Obviously this place is a chain, but I didn't know this until I did some further research after eating here. This is a fast casual type of place, where you order and pay at the counter, then self serve drinks and condiments are around the corner. They have daily specials at $9.99 each. The special of the day (Friday) was pulled pork, 2 sides and a roll. I went with this deal, and also added a drink so my total was around $12. As soon as you tell the guys behind the counter what you want, they start preparing your food. The counter is super duper high, so you can't see what is going on while the food is being made. This bugs me a little bit, but it's not a deal breaker.  While my food was being prepared, I made my way around the corner to get my drink. Fountain sodas and sweet/unsweet tea was on tap. I chose the sweet tea and it tasted pretty un-sweetened to me. You could tell there was sugar in it, but if I am drinking sweet tea I want it to be SWEET. They give you a large souvenir cup that you can take home with you and reuse which is cool. Next to the drinks they have some vats of house made bbq sauces. Spicy, original and sweet, I got a cup of each.  I got back to work, and when I opened up the box of food excited to dig in, I was underwhelmed. Inside lay a pile of un-sauced pulled pork, 2 raw white onion slices and a few dill pickle chips. A white roll accompanied my 2 side dishes of jalapeno beans and mac and cheese. Let me just say that the beans tasted like Bush's from the can, and the mac and cheese tasted like Stouffers. The meat was not seasoned at all, there was no smoky flavor and I had to douse it in bbq sauce. I thought all the sauces tasted very similar. All in all, I can't see myself coming back here."}
{"text":"One of my favorite locations! Excellent food, great customer service (Noah was so friendly, he let me sample my meat of choice before ordering) and just a great overall experience. Comfortable with tables and bar stool chairs that have charging ports at the counter top making it a great place to work and eat!"}
{"text":"The food and service are always great, but what the heck is up with the new menu, no more combos??? And the prices are ridiculous. Won't be coming back very often anymore"}
{"text":"poor service I was waiting in line,  and when the manager got to me, He addresses me as \"Buddy\" and tells me I have to wait because he was too busy with orders.  He didn't really care about the people in line that had already been waiting.  I just went ahead and left.  Too many good restaurants with excellent service in the Scottsdale area"}
{"text":"The food was cold, and microwaved.... The employees are in the back talk loud and cussing while families are up front, had to flag them down to come to the cash register. I like bbq, but you can tell employees and management don't care about quality...."}
{"text":"The food here was okay but the reason I'm giving this place a 1-star is because of the service. They were dishonest and charged us something they said was included. Check your receipt and the menu carefully unless you have money to spare.   My husband and I went in and asked how it worked because it was our first time eating there. The manager started guiding us in the ordering process, he said if you get a plate then it comes with two sides if you get a sandwich then it does not. He told us about how much meat comes in each meat plate. When I looked at the menu it didn't say the plates came with sides so I asked him again to clarify, so if we get the plate it comes with two sides but if we get the sandwich it does not. He said yes that's right. So we proceeded to order a plate and two sides and went to pay. We had originally gone there because we have a coupon from the entertainment book but when we went to pay we couldn't use it because it was one entree, okay that's fair we said we'll just come back. The bill then came out to higher than what I was expecting and when I went to check the receipt my suspicions were confirmed, the two sides had not been included they were extra. So now I hadn't ordered my sandwich (which also would have allowed us to use the coupon), and we paid for two sides we probably wouldn't have gotten had they not been \"included.\" Of course my husband went and talked to the manager about it and he tried saying he hadn't said that they were included. My husband is more of a pacifist so he let it got. I went back up at the end of our meal not wanting to spoil it and clarified with the manager that he should have been upfront and honest with us. That he lost two customers. He offered to give back the money, I told him no that it's fine but that we wouldn't be going back. We weren't complaining to get a free meal but fair is only fair. So no I will NEVER be going back here again. If your dishonest about that what other things could they be hiding."}
{"text":"Medina rules. BBQ scene in Medina is pretty dope. I liked everything I had here and everyone had a good attitude. This place is not 100% killer but it's pretty slick. I like the choices of sauces and all the sides. Pretty kick ass little spot.  Seedoman"}
{"text":"I used to think franchised BBQ can't be good. then Dickeys came to town and proved me wrong. I eat here often since I work just a few blocks away. Its always good! I dare you to walk anywhere near the place and not get hungry. The aroma of smoke and meat wafts in the air. Try it and you'll be hooked like I am."}
{"text":"MEAT - Got the two meet combo (like $1.50 extra from 1 meet combo) with Pulled Pork and Brisket.  Brisket was amazing and I will be back. Pulled Pork was a bit overcooked, making it dry and not so great.   SAUCES-  The sauces (3 different ones) were great too, they keep the heated which I like and is pretty rare.  Good portion and great price. Fix the pulled pork and your my next favorite BBQ spot. SIDES -  The stuffed baked potato was great as well. The beans were good-not great- so i would probably try a different side next time. There sweet tea is perfect tho!"}
{"text":"We were staying in town for the night and wanted some good BBQ. This place was great. We tried the brisket, pulled pork and chicken breast; all were delicious. For sides, you can't go wrong with BBQ beans and baked potato casserole. Staff was very friendly and provided great service. 5 stars all the way"}
{"text":"Like many of the other reviewers stated, the food is decent but the service is sub par. This group of young men felt like ordering from a high school jock squad. Go take a lesson from some of your Dutch Bros neighbors and learn to converse with your customers and at least pretend that you respect your customers. Be professionals. Even if this is your first job and you are 16, act like you belong there and be grateful for your job."}
{"text":"I was so excited to write a review for this place.   Like I've mentioned in previous reviews, I'm a fan of the little guys.  Especially when it comes to BBQ.    I've had Dickies several times, mostly catered for corporate events, and I've always been less than impressed. It was never that is was BAD, it just wasn't great.   This particular location BLEW MY MIND!  I had a bad day at work, and wanted BBQ and this was close to home.  My husband and I split a family picnic with pulled pork, mac and cheese, and beans.  The pulled pork was the right amount of dry, with tasty little chunks of candied sauce.   The mac and cheese was wonderful, I could taste the cheddar. I didn't ask if they make it in house, or if there is another company but I LOVED it.  The Baked beans were okay, a little too spicy for my taste buds. My  husband and father LOVED the beans, said it reminded them of chili.  The manager told me it came from an outside company, so the beans technically aren't even theirs to rate LOL   Did I mention free ice cream? I didn't have any, but my mom made herself a rootbeer float and was happier than I had seen her in ages LOL  It's neat to see a resturant giving stuff away for free! My parents only got sodas, and didn't eat - so being offered free ice cream twice by the manager was awesome.   Spent quite a bit of time talking with Andrew, the General Manager - who told me, himself and the two owners are all culinary school graduates with backgrounds in fine dining.  They stated a majority of their rubs/sauces come for corporate - but they enforce clean kitchens, and 24 hours marinations.  I don't know what the differences is, but it's working.  Andrew, you run a great resturant. We will certainly be back."}
{"text":"My first visit to Dickey's. I really enjoyed it! My only complaint....TOO MUCH food! Seriously the 2 meats was enough for two people. I had the brisket and pulled pork which were delish. I'm sure my dog will very much enjoy the leftovers."}
{"text":"Good value for make your own plate meals. However my potato salad, the potatoes still tasted hard and raw. The staff was kind enough to change my side for another of my choice. Meat choices were ok, nothing to rave about. Standard sides that you would get everywhere for a Bbq plate. I did love their cornbread muffins though. Would I visit here again? Maybe."}
{"text":"The food is awesome but I have three stars because of the workers. We came in on Sunday night 10/15 and the two woman who work there are the worst. They act like they can not be bothered to help you. Uh hello then choose a different profession. The two guys are the same at least we got a hello out of one of them. I wish I got names but the other guy who I can assume was the manager well let's just say he picks and chooses who he has conversation with. Kids eat free there so I was charged and I asked if they could fix it and they did but not before he talked down to me.  It was so uncomfortable in there we didn't even finish we just left."}
{"text":"Was intrigued to see a new BBQ place in Mentor especially considering I drive all the way to the west side to eat at Famous Dave's when I'm craving bbq and all the fixins. The dining room seemed super bright with the fluorescent lights overhead (maybe its weird I notice such things) and it didn't really have a great ambiance. It's setup a la chipotle where you make your way through the line ordering your items as you go. My two complaints were 1) the line was soooo slow, as in I waited nearly 20 minutes just to make it to the meat order window and I was only behind about 5/6 people and 2) I am befuddled as to why they wouldn't make the sides visible to the customer. Imagine going through the chipotle line and not being able to see any of the toppings that's how the Dickey's line is setup.  I finally made it to the meat ordering window and choose the meal with 1 meat and 2 sides. Another side note, they smoke their meats which give them a very distinct taste and smell. I ordered the chicken with Mac and cheese and coleslaw and could have cried when I got to the register and asked for cornbread and womp,womp, they only have rolls. How can you serve BBQ and not serve come bread?!   The chicken was alright, a little to dry and smokey tasting for my taste and the Mac and cheese was good. I didn't finish everything so I stuck it in my fridge and  my entire kitchen and fridge smelled like fake smoke smell for the next 2 days, so strange.  All in all. I probably wouldn't return as I didn't care for the smokey flavor on the chicken and the sides were underwhelming  and I didn't get any beloved corn bread."}
{"text":"This place is amazing food always cooked when we order and the service is great the cashier made me and my girlfriend laugh quite a bit he had good jokes and they have free ice cream and delicious bbq sauce."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place since it was in the neighborhood and we like supporting businesses in the neighborhood. I ordered the Beef and cheese sandwich with a side of macaroni and cheese and my wife ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of baked potato casserole. Both sandwiches were good as well as both of the sides but we wish the sides would have been warmer. A little above room temperature doesn't cut it.  They mentioned having a new menu because they forgot to put the cheese on my beef and cheese sandwich. The kicker though was a smell coming from their sewer or grease trap that was strong when standing at the cashier. Not sure if that is an ongoing problem or not. We will probably try this place again one day to see if they have the menu memorized and the smell is gone."}
{"text":"Dickeys is a place to go for your fast food bbq needs. The spicy bbq sauce is so delicious and goes well with all their meats. The pulled pork is so good I can even heat up my leftovers after a few days and still tastes good."}
{"text":"My son introduced me to this restaurant in Tucson at their Oracle location. And everything was GREAT. So, when I saw this one here in Mesa. I knew I had to stop.  I was across the street at Panda Express. I now wish I had stuck with my first choice.  OMG!!!! This place was a mess from the minute I walked in. I went on a Saturday around 1pm. There was no crowd or a long line. It was only a group of 3 and they all ordered the special.  I waited in line about 15-20 minutes just to place my order. That was totally ridiculous. I ordered the 2 meat plate (beef brisket/spicy sausage) with 2 sides. No, a drink is not included. This was a joke, it was more like 2 pieces of meat. The sausage equaled out to about half of a sausage sliced up. Don't even get me started on what was suppose to be slices of brisket. It was 2-3 small pieces of crispy burnt dry meat. I guess mine skipped the smoker.  My side dishes were the only things that were hot. I did get a piece of pecan pie for $2.95. My total meal cost me $16 bucks.This was what I ordered thinking it would be for my lunch and leftovers for dinner, WRONG!!! The portions of meat were so small, I ate it all in one setting. The best part of the meal was the fried okra and pecan pie. Yea, the ice cream is free. It should be for what you pay for the food.  In the future when I want BBQ. I will make the drive down to Rudy's. Where I know the food is lip smacking finger licking good. And I will get more big bang for my buck. I will NOT be returning to this location again.   Maybe they should try compensating their customers for their wait with a small drink, a cookie or something. It's all part of Customer Service."}
{"text":"I've finally found a cheap BBQ place that's delicious. I've passed this place so many times over the years while going to eat next door at BWW. I don't know why I never walked in, I love BBQ. Man, I've been missing out this whole time.   Their chopped brisket is amazing. As is their pulled pork. I was pretty dissatisfied with their ribs though. They weren't \"fall off the bone\" tender as I hoped they would be. Actually they were pretty tough. i'm hoping it was just an off day though. I keep meaning to give them a try again, but I can't pull away from their damn brisket.   They have a good 2 meat deal, which comes with two sides and a biscuit. It's usually the option I go for. It's a great amount of food to feed me when I'm super hungry, and makes great left over when I'm not so hungry. They also have daily specials which come with the aforementioned plus a drink.   All in all, a great place to grab some quick BBQ if you don't want to do a sit down restaurant."}
{"text":"Well... it's okay; I still am looking for a great BBQ place in Vegas there just really are not; the good here is adequate but for the price you pay adequate is not great; ribs were a bit dry and chewy and the brisket lacked flavor; spicy hot link was okay"}
{"text":"Oh man. So good! I got the pulled pork sandwich with macaroni and cheese and onion tanglers. Can't wait to go back. I'm not even obsessed with bbq, but now I can't stop thinking about it."}
{"text":"A luscious BBQ joint, where the sweet smells set-off one's olfactory cells in the nose & make your taste buds weep with joy.....  We drove as fast as we legally could from Elyria to Medina for one of our favorite meals.  Yes, Dickey's is across from Northland Drive on the strip of corporate chains lining Route 42 through Medina, Ohio, but it is one of those smaller, unique franchises that are worthwhile.  There is always plenty of parking.  Dickey's is fast-casual restaurant dining.  You walk through the ordering space going from the meets station to the sides to the other & finally beverages.  Just FYI, they serve beer, but the lemonade is out of this world!  Tonight, we ordered the XL Family Pack of three (3) meats (BBQ Pork Ribs, Chicken Breast, & Jalape√±o-Cheddar Kielbasa) with four (4) side dishes consisting of Baked Potato Casserole as well as Mac & Cheese.  We also got the dinner rolls & an order of four (4) pieces of Cornbread.  If you like spicy kielbasa, then you must try Dickey's, it's mouthwatering.  It will literally ignite your taste buds.  The Pork Ribs were juicy & meaty, and the Chicken Breast was soft & crumbling apart with flavor.  You really only use Dickey's home BBQ sauces (Original, Spicy, & Sweet) to try the sauces, but none of the food needs it.  The food stands on it's own flavorful blaze of glory.  Dickey's is a great place for family's or group, because they have the space, even a small party room, & best part - THEY HAVE A FREE SOFT-SERVE ICE CREAM MACHINE.   Maya & Anna we're on deck, & did a wonderful job serving our family as well as making sure our needs were met.  We were kindly advised to always call ahead for ordering meats by the pound in the pack sizes, then our order will be ready when we arrive.  The staff was professional & presentation of the food was excellent.  We were eating right up to the brink of close, so we appreciate that they were in the back cleaning, & did not rush us.  The menu can be a bit of a tag shock, but you really have to consider the amount of food you're receiving.  We always take home enough food for two (2) more meals with the XL Family Pack.  Weigh your needs well, or you should be prepared for take-out leftovers.  After all, the food is so tempting that you will want to try it all.  The great thing is that Dickey's is a caterer as well, and we will definitely consider them for any event.  Our favorite is the Jalape√±o-Cheddar Kielbasa & favorite side is the buns.  You can't go wrong with any side they're all good.  Our least favorite was the Barbecue Honey Ham; it wasn't bad, just very different from typical ham - it tasted more like a catered meat.  Apologies for no pictures, we jumped right into eating tonight.  We promise photos next visit, please check out the website - the food actually looks better in real life for once!"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a sunny day about 3pm to pick up dinner.... There was the nicest guy behind the counter, chopping and slicing on the beef brisket. This man made me feel welcomed and was genuinely concerned with my order.   Alternatively, the woman cashiering was not as hospitable, to put it nicely.  She seemed ticked about having to pull the order together.  My biggest issue is not with the service, 50% of the service was perfect and would bring me back again.  My issue is the value for the money.  We spent nearly 53.00 for a family meal, out of that - the sides were whoafully lacking and the bread was sad, couldn't make it better with butter, honey - nothing.  The sides were filled by the cashier, they were just over 1/2 way full. We've eaten at Dickey's before and always had the sides filled up to the upper rim for the cup. This time, the cup was just a little over half full (or, half empty?)....  The meat was wonderful, great flavor! The amount of meat was quite generous, too.  But really, that's a lot of money to spend for a couple pounds of good bbq meat and not much else.  The $$ icon should be changed to a $$$, more realistic to the actual price per person. Not worth it for the money.... probably won't be back... too expensive."}
{"text":"We ordered 3 lbs of each (chicken, brisket & pulled pork) for a party over Memorial Day weekend and the service and food were excellent. The woman at the counter even helped me bring the food out to my car. Our sides (mac & cheese, cole slaw, and beans) were also very good. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because the food was a bit pricey. I would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"When this Dickey's BBQ had first opened it was pretty good the portion sizes were decent the customer service was awesome the food selection in menu was really good. But it seems all that has changed.  I could never call this \"real bbq\" it just doesn't have that taste, you taste more seasonings than anything and  the menu has changed and so have their portion sizes and value. I'm personally not a big fan this barbecue place but give it a try and decide for yourself."}
{"text":"I would rate this place a five, if the staff was nicer. Nevertheless, I cannot overlook that the food is so delicious, in that \"southern comfort, greasy, totally unhealthy\" for you type of way. I ordered the beef brisket, and oh my was it worth it. Juicy, flavorful, and not too salty, just how I like my red meats. For the sides, where do I start! The baked potato casserole was so scrumptious, as a matter of fact, I liked it better than the meat, which is saying alot. The green beans were fair, not out of this world but good. The Jalapeno beans are a must try, smoky, not too hot, just right in accordance to southern style cuisine.        The all you can eat, self serve ice cream is a plus. Sure it was a little watery, but for \"all you can eat\" it suffices. Once again, my biggest reservation is the staff. No one says you have to love your job, but at least make me feel like I am somewhat welcomed at the establishment, a simple hello would be nice. For what it is, Dickey's is a decent BBQ joint. Try it to get it out of your system, wouldn't blame you if you decide to return despite the solemn staff."}
{"text":"The only reason I gave two stars is because the food that my co-worker shared with me was fantastic. Otherwise, I'm horribly disappointed with this restaurant and will never give this location my business in the future.   Today at work, my co-workers & I decided to get Uber Eats for lunch & placed the order at your Dickey's location. After I began unpacking the food in our breakroom, I noticed that one complete meal was missing, along with one side from another meal. I immediately tried to call the Uber Eats driver on the number from the text message we received from them, but no answer. So I then called your restaurant and spoke to a woman who took my information and looked up my number. She noted that they had indeed forgot a meal & one of the sides. She stated that she would credit the card back for those items. I asked her if that was it? There was no way to get the meal & side delivered as it was YOUR error that it wasn't placed in the to-go bags for the Uber driver to pick up? She stated that no, no one would deliver and that she could credit the card, or if I was able to come and pick it up. I told her no, that I was at work & that was obviously the reason I ordered delivery.   So today I sat and was the ONLY one of the employees who didn't eat lunch because I didn't a receive that YOUR employees forgot, and another co-worker paid $12 for a freaking chicken salad with soggy croutons and no side. And your best correction to those errors is to simply credit the card back. Terrible, terrible, customer service."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this restaurant and dine there frequently. The BBQ sauces are delicious, and the meats are always good. They seem to run out of things often, it's a bit overpriced and ordering is completely awkward every single time."}
{"text":"Was looking for a quick brisket sandwich and headed to Dickey's. The brisket was average, but the the staff was weird. No one was at the drive thru and I went in. There were several Spanish speaking employees kind of wandering around and finally(after about 5 minutes of standing around) a white guy finally took my order. The brisket was passable, but the experience was not good."}
{"text":"This is where I take my wife when she is not feeling happy. She loves the sausage with the sweet sauce."}
{"text":"Customer service was awesome!  Our first time at a Dickey ' s and they walked us thru the menu!  The lady ahead of us was even raving about the pulled pork. She was getting 10lbs. for Christmas Eve dinner! Another gentleman said everything is good but he gets the brisket! To die for!!  And he goes to a lot of BBQ places on his travels.  We were very impressed and would be back again soon!  And FREE ICE CREAM CONES!! how can you beat that!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in tonight, what happened here geez. Combo plates are gone and you now buy meat by the quarter or half pound. Not a deal whatsoever, every thing else is a la carte. To make a combo like it used to be, came out to around 15 bucks. Done with this place, free frozen powdered ice cream and dry brisket, people need to expand their horizons and try some of the amazing other places in town: rollin smoke, roadkill or Jessie Rae's. See ya dickies...."}
{"text":"Went back for lunch today and got the all meat brisket with slaw.  OMG the bark on the meat was perfect and the meat was melt in your mouth goodness, juicy and flavorful ..  The slaw has great flavor and a perfect consistency.  For the second time the manager or owner briefly stopped by and asked how everything was. My go to place for excellent BBQ used to be El Paso but of course they went out of business during the recession and Pork on a Fork which was across the street from where I worked.  This  place, the employees and especially the food are the bomb. Dickey's in Surprise is definitely my go to place for all things BBQ!"}
{"text":"This was my first experience with the Dickeys chain back in Fall of '14.   My GF and I have a timeshare right next to the outlets(the better one, if you know the two, haha), and it's conveniently located next to Dickeys. I gotta say, for a chain BBQ joint, I was impressed with this location. The food was legit, the prices were legit, and the staff was friendly.   We liked it so much, that we got food from here 3 times during our stay...Twice we ate the daily specials in restaurant, and one time we got the family xl pack. It was all good.  Imagine how disappointed my GF and I were when a Dickeys location opened up next to us in Woodland Hills, CA, and it turned out to pale in comparison to the vegas location. Night and Day. I was expecting Vegas Dickeys when I went to the Woodland Hills location, but all I got instead was a cold plate of something I didn't order.  So to be clear,  Dickeys Vegas Blvd South, NV = Awesome  Dickeys Ventura Blvd, Woodland Hills, CA = Disappointing Slop (gotta blame the staff...sorry guys, but Vegas was good!)"}
{"text":"It's hard to find a good place in this big city to call \"Your BBQ Pit\" but Dickies totally makes you feel at home. We go every Monday and have been for about a year and a half now and absolutely love it! Employees never forget a face and know your meal on the spot."}
{"text":"Had never eaten here before, but we had made a big to go order of a picnic pack for a pool party on Father's Day . It was a pretty guide size and fed everyone we had. The ribs were really yummy. Brisket melted in your mouth but was a tad dry . But they have extra BBQ sauce for all the meats. Loved the green beans, they had a very nice Cajun flavor. Mac and cheese was the same as most places. And the rolls were vey good as well!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.Al the negative reviews are about people that don't know good food.I am from New York..... I know good  food.The brisket is excellent.The sides .....onion rings and creamed spinach are to die for.This food is good !!!!."}
{"text":"If you love BBQ and want something quick and good, this is your place! This Dickey's location has new owners and they know how to run a Dickey's. They've brought the free ice cream cones to this location that always keeps the kids and hubby happy. They also have kids eat free Sundays! The store has nice decor, is big and has the newer Coca-Cola machines. Oh and of course the sliced brisket is our favorite."}
{"text":"Kids Eat Free on Sundays is always a bonus! Food was phenomenal (enjoyed the Ribs, Cheddar Sausage, Mac and Cheese and beans) and the free ice cream is great. 4 star is because an employee rang up the order incorrectly. She didn't charge me for the kids meals. After she gave me my total and I handed her my card, the manager came over and said, it's only one free kids meal per adult. She replied, they told me two kids free earlier and he said no, so she added more. I had no problem with this but didn't appreciate the interaction and the manager made me feel as if I tried to cheat them. Nevertheless we will still return."}
{"text":"Six months ago I would have rated this higher. The meat is still tasty, but this will no longer be my \"go-to\" for BBQ.  The new menu (no combos, less items, no fried items) is disappointing and the pricing makes a sit-down establishment more inviting. On the hunt for a new favorite..."}
{"text":"Texas BBQ chain that reminds me of home! Their plates are inexpensive and you get a hefty size portion. You'll leave fat and happy (literally). This is fried, southern comfort food. They have their different sauces as self-serve, which is a great touch. Also, self-serve all you can eat pickles, yum!"}
{"text":"I just went there for the first time yesterday. The food was great, the people working were super friendly and helpful, and the price was pretty good."}
{"text":"Why did I wait so long to try Dickey's?    My husband and I visited Dickey's on Sunday afternoon for a late lunch. The smoked meats on the menu are pretty straight forward, pulled pork, beef brisket, sausage, ham, turkey and chicken - all hickory smoked in their onsite pits. Now, I know I'm in North Carolina where pulled pork is king, but I can't pass up brisket. I ordered a 1 meat plate with beef brisket. The plate comes with 2 sides and I chose the baked potato casserole and the fried onion tanglers.  Boy, did I choose right!  You get a hefty portion of meat with a soft roll with pickles and onions. You can also choose from a variety of sauces at the sauce bar.  My husband also got the brisket but got the jalapeno beans and fried okra.  He said he really liked his plate too.  The brisket was tender with a nice smokey flavor. I chose the original bbq sauce and it was the perfect accompaniment.  And to top it all off, everyone gets free soft-serve vanilla ice cream!  It's self serve and it was a great ending to a really great lunch!  The service was super, super nice and attentive. I've been plotting our next visit. We will definitely be back!  The bakers (stuffed baked potatoes) will be next on my list!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS BBQ with perfect sauces, regular-sweet-spicy. All very very good!  All sides were served piping hot and also delish. Rolls weren't our favorite, but who cares when we filled up on the tender smoked brisket, pulled pork and fall-off-the-bone ribs!  Shared a slice of the pecan pie for that perfect sweet finish to a very enjoyable meal!  We appreciate the friendly, helpful staff as it was our first time there. The smallish dining area has a cool atmosphere with the store's history and the overall cleanliness was OUTSTANDING, which is sadly not the norm in many places lately!  We'll definitely return when we golf in this area again, and we live an hour away! Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Yesterday I had met a friend for lunch at Ike's, which we all know is amazing, and as I was blasting by on Alma School I noticed this newly-opened Dickey's.  When I used to travel all over the country Dickey's was one of my goto places if I was craving BBQ and there was one close to the hotel.  They are consistent, the staff is friendly, and for me, it's a relaxing atmosphere.  I don't listen to country music generally, but for some reason I really feel at home at Dickey's.  And if you don't tap your toes to John Denver singing \"Thank God I'm a Country Boy\", well then there's something wrong with you.  This morning I told my Mr. that I had an idea for lunch.  Let's go to Dickey's and share something and then go to Ike's and share something.  Well, I got myself under control and we just ate at Dickey's.  It smelled so good in the parking lot, that I knew it would be tough to decide what to order.  When we walked in we were greeted by friendly employees, one of whom explained the layout of the restaurant & the ordering process.  Then we ordered a 1/4 lb of chopped brisket ($4), a 1/4 lb. smoked sausage ($3.75), a side of green beans ($2.25) and a side of baked potato casserole ($2.25).  They also brought us some freshly baked rolls.  Everything was delicious except I thought the brisket was a little over-seasoned.  It kind of irritated my throat it was so salty, but that's why you buy the big yellow cup ($2.25), to fill it with something to wash it all down.  As a side note they have Coke products.    I love their sides.  The green beans taste like something my grandma used to make with bacon and some pepper.  Delicious!  And I could eat a large side of that potato casserole all by myself.  REAL potatoes with a little salt and pepper.  Just perfect.  All in we spent $15.67 after tax and it was plenty of food for both of us.  They also have a punch card so I can earn some free food.  I'm sure we'll be back now that there's one closer to home."}
{"text":"I love this staff. My first visit was great and the pit master is awesome and has great personality and happy and willing to help! He definitely deserves a raise. My visit just now they forgot the rolls, but made up for it by including some extras at pick up! Thank you staff!"}
{"text":"ADDICTING! I have had the BBQ pork pit sandwich. Delish! Friendly staff, every time i have went in to order to-go I have seen the staff cleaning off the tables. Clean store. Also, you get to enjoy free ice cream. Recommending this place to all my family and friends."}
{"text":"This location is great the the food and service is always excellent.   The owner is usually around which makes for motivated employees.  He food is excellent as always and the smoked meets are good.  And free soft serve.  Good job guys."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good for what it is, honestly. The pulled pork and brisket are my go-tos. Give me the fried okra all day, please (tip: it's almost better as cold leftovers, strange as that is).  This is where I get my occasional BBQ fix now that Bullie's is gone."}
{"text":"Let's start this off right. This is not a gourmet BBQ joint. What this is, is a tasty place to eat, if you are on the go, and surprisingly healthy...wait...stop...don't leave...I'M NOT KIDDING!!!   OK quit giggling and start googling. Still with me? No no...it's ok...google Dickey's nutrition information and follow along...it's cool...I'll wait. OK I lied..not waiting.   The smoked chicken breast is delicious, low fat, low carb, and delicious. Yes. Delicious is in there twice. It is honestly really good!!!  Pair that with a side salad and use 1/2 the dressing and you have a recipe for a healthy to-go lunch/dinner when you are on the road.   There. See. I am not insane...OK I might be according to the loving wife...but her opinion is the only one that matters.   Back to the food. It is good, fast, and can be healthy. Keep an open mind and an open Google app and you to can eat healthy on the go."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of home without having to go too far out of my way. Being from Texas, I used to eat at Dickey's quite a bit, especially during lunch when I needed a quick bite, along with other fast casual or quick service BBQ joints off course. Although this one's a bit smaller and slower than the ones back home, the food more than makes up for it. Most of the time I'm here the meats are well smoked and flavorful, although the pulled pork and brisket could be a little more moist and less lean, which makes it dry when you smoke it. The sides are pretty delicious and I tend to go with the mac and cheese and bacon green beans, but half the time I can't even decide which 2 I want to pick.   If you stop by on a weekday during lunch, they have a special of the day now and for $8.99 you can grab a BBQ sandwich or entree with 2 sides and a drink! The most recent time I was here I opted for this deal and I felt like there was more than enough food I could barely finish. They also have a free ice cream machine here, as does every Dickey's location, but I wouldn't recommend it except for kids...it isn't very good ice cream...but hey it's free right?  There are typically only a couple front line employees and 1 register so it could take a while if you come in during lunch rush. But since this is a pretty small location, I doubt it could be streamlined any better. I believe they just opened a new location near S. Rainbow, but I haven't had a chance to check it out yet."}
{"text":"Snobby employees, bad vibes, great food. I can't consciously give my money to a place with horrendous customer service but I will continue to enjoy myself some Dickies, just at a different location! 15 minutes until closing and they wouldn't let me eat inside. I'm a habitual eater, I've been here a bunch, always tip and always always always clean up after myself. I'm a customer you will never see again. I had to take my entire order to go and it was cold by the time I got home... this location will go belly up- BYE"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, quick service with a smile, good eats, they get 5 stars! Yelp wants more words but I think I've covered it pretty concisely..."}
{"text":"Great service and food is awesome! Clean place. Manager took the time to give us a little background from the company, which we appreciate it. Seen the manager take owner ship, was preparing food as well! Awesome To see this! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for a quick lunch. The place is very clean and everybody was super nice and welcoming. I ordered their 2 plate combo. Brisket- good and was falling off my fork. Pulled pork- very dry. The sides : potato salad and BBQ beans- alright. $14 later- will move on to discover a different BBQ place."}
{"text":"Horey sheet...bomb.com. This some good BBQ. Must be kind of a secret place because I can't remember hearing about it before and I found it by accident. Really good. If you've never been here, try it!   Menu is a little complicating but it's like that in new places for me usually. I usually just try to listen to what people are ordering in front of me. I'd say they need more advertising but I don't think they even need it. Place was busy but quick."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with my son. There is a HABIT Burger joint in down the street from them and we went to go grab a burger, however, we never made it in to get a burger because we smelled Dickeys Bar B que. So we rerouted and went to Dickeys and had a very memorable meal. Their restaurant was clean and food was prepared with hand gloves. I got the brisket slices and was fortunate to get the meat they were just putting out. Very good experience and we will be back. Folks dont listen to these negative comments...try it for yourself. Had I listened to these negative comments i would have missed out on a good meal."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service.  Food was very fatty and still tough.  I ordered the Westerner and asked about the sandwich.  The employee said it did not come with a bun.  How do you have a sandwich without a bun?  He could not explain and another employee stepped in.  It was a difficult order with him as well.  I paid for three meals and three drinks.  The cashier did not allow me my perk points or give me my drinks after the part of the meal came and we were told they would bring it.  I was taking my cups and then was accused to stealing drinks.  I said I did pay and had my receipt.  The employee who could not explain my order earlier said it was his job.  To accuse me of stealing? Terrible service, food not so good."}
{"text":"First time here. Pit master was helpful with selecting choices. Wish we would've waited til Monday for the rib full rack special but the food was very delicious and the manager was really nice."}
{"text":"This is my second visit and I have to say that I am not satisfied with the food or the person that prepared my order. The young kid at the register was ok and polite but the older guy preparing my food wasn't pleasant at all. He should have stayed home today. I think he might be the manager or owner because I saw him last time and he hasn't changed. I ordered the 3 meat plate and the portions he gave me were very small and it looked like he just slopped it all in the container. For $14 I expected more meat not a quarter of a sausage and about 2 ounces of pulled pork and chopped beef. I asked him a question and his response made me feel like it was a dumb question. Horrible place, the ice cream is good though!"}
{"text":"The brisket was very salty.  The potatoe casserole is mashed potatoes with bacon.  The Mac n cheese tastes like stouffers.    It was bad food, but it wasn't great food either.  My co-worker said the chicken and Caesar salad are very good."}
{"text":"OMG, this BBQ is AMAZING!  I was completely shocked when I took a bite of the chopped beef brisket.  It's extremely tender, no fat and has a smokey taste.  I have been back several times since and have tried all the sides as well as the pork. All are amazing.  They also give you a free soft-serve ice cream cone after!!!  I highly recommend Dickey's BBQ!"}
{"text":"Absolutely no complaints. The staff was friendly and helpful. Food was good. They even have some free ice cream. It's not the best quality ice cream but hey it's free. Also they have really nice fountain drink cups. Nice decorations"}
{"text":"I love Ribs when the meat just falls off of the bone when you bite into it. That's exactly what these did. Their sauce is just right and is tangy and sweet just as it should be. I didnt enjoy the mac & cheese as much but I wasn't there for the mac & cheese anyways. I saw everyone had ordered the baked potato casserole as a side and it looks delicious! I've tasted the okra, the fried onions, & the BBQ beans and those were all great sides, totally recommend.  At the drinking area they have a big jar of pickles & you are more than welcome to take as many pickles as you want out of the jar for yourself. The pickles aren't too salty either, they have a great crunch and are so fresh. They also have three sauces  beside the jar of pickles that you could choose to bring back with you for your dipping pleasure. They are all great, but I prefer the original. Right next to the exit they have free ice cream, it's French Vanilla and they have ice cream cones or cups you could put it in. Very cool place, I loved my experience!"}
{"text":"Dropped in here today with the family, was glad to find out they have a kids eat free on Sunday.   All the different things we tried were: Pulled Pork, Hot Links, Sliced Brisket, Fries, Jalepano Beans, Cole Slaw, Potatoe Casserole, and Onion Rings.   My Family and I enjoyed all the food.   We did not have any problem with the customer service.   I would come back."}
{"text":"This place is the best! So delicious and great priced for the quality! I plan to cater my 21st Birthday from here! Best BBQ if you wanna stay in town! Haven't had something this good since the road kill grill."}
{"text":"My husband and decided to go here after a friend of ours said they had really good BBQ. When we went in we were greeted and told about the 10.99 daily specials. Today, Friday the 10.99 special was pulled pork, 2 sides , a roll and drink.  We both choose the special. After hearing it was our first time there he let us sample a few of the sides. I had green beans that were delicious, some of the best I have ever had and Mac and cheese which was fine. My husband had the potato salad (it was a mustardy mayo base that was delicious) and baked beans that he really enjoyed. The pulled pork was really good especially with the original sauce which is slightly spicy.  Servings were plentiful. If you save your cup and bring it back it is only 99 cents to refill on your next visit. Very friendly service and down home BBQ, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The ribs are excellent and the BBQ beans are even better and great service,fries are good also"}
{"text":"Decent BBQ without having to drive too far from home, although that's not really saying much because there really aren't any awesome BBQ joints in Vegas...  The food here is pretty consistent and rarely too dry. I usually go with sliced brisket or ribs with creamed spinach, mac & cheese, and/or Caesar salad as my sides. My only gripe is that for the price, the amount of food you get is a little on the smaller side. But they have daily specials (except Saturdays or Sundays I think) posted which come with drinks, making it a little cheaper if you order those.  If you sign up for their e-club, they send out occasional coupons and offers but it's pretty scarce. If you regularly get fountain drinks here, be sure to save your plastic yellow cup because you get discounted refills on future visits instead of having to buy a whole new cup"}
{"text":"Great place great food great experience here with staff. i am from out of town just like back home and very clear place. will be back next time in town .thanks dickey's"}
{"text":"Do you want cold over priced BBQ with terrible customer service? Come to Dickeys Mesa! I work in Scottsdale and have been eating at the Dickeys there for years. This one opened up close to home and decided I would give it a shot. I don't know how they're able to call this place Dickey's with a straight face. First we were treated with rude staff members where my only interaction was \"What do you want?\" with out even a smile. Eventually after several failed attempts at small talk with the workers I was able to get my order. Once I sat down I was even more disappointed. Mushy spicy sausage, cold chopped brisket, and cold mushy macaroni and cheese. What's a Dickeys staple? Free Ice Cream? Nope none is had here. HERE'S TO THE NEW GENERATION OF STORES. The only good thing about this place was the free water cup I was given. If you want good BBQ fast food go to a Dickeys in Scottsdale or Phoenix."}
{"text":"Last night, I had the privilege of traveling with friends to this restaurant. I've missed pulled pork sandwiches more than ANYTHING in the world, so I entered the place extremely excited and a bit under the influence. Pulled pork sandwiches? GIMME GIMME GIMME. I can never get enough of them. Last I'd had them, I was at my grandmother's funeral after-party.  They have so many options, and all of them are barbecue-licious. Of course, I chose the pulled pork sandwich with macaroni & cheese and barbecue beans as sides. This was my first course, anyway. I sat down to eat with my dearest friends and, much to my delight, I was at once stolen away to the land of purple food faeries and euphoric fluffy clouds, all drenched in barbecue sauce.  Trust me when I say that that's a good thing.  After I finished this course, I simply had to sample more. I went up to the register and asked the polite and serviceable employees what kinds of assorted desserts were available. They told me they had pumpkin pie. And that was it...  I ordered the pumpkin pie and, ravenously true to my nature, I scarfed it down in less than a minute, feeling God return to forgive my soul its agony with every bite.  Shortly after, I glanced at my friend and grinned at a very special prospect. I was going to order another pulled pork sandwich. We left and went to the dollar store, then I returned not more than ten minutes later, insisting on another pulled pork sandwich.  The staff happily obliged. In hindsight, I probably seemed like a weirdo. I am a bit of a weirdo.  But trust me, Dickey's Barbecue Pit is worth it even if you have to deal with weirdos like me!"}
{"text":"Dickey's ending up being my new spot too try this week. It really close too my home past by it almost daily basis and always wondering about the food. More times then not the parking lot seems empty and keep thinking too myself how long will this place last. It been while since had some BBQ so just meant too be.  It was my first time not sure where I was going too attack the menu. Sandwich. Even if I wanted Ribs apparently they ran out that night. I found little odd cause came here for dinner around 6pm. Either there really good or make so much each day?? Any case not feeling like ribs but nice pulled pork sandwich. I ended up getting the Westerner Sandwich. It comes with two choices of meat. I was thrown for loop thinking more times then not sandwich is one kind of meat. So have few choices too choose from I went with the pulled pork and beef brisket. If you want can go double the same meat instead of mixing it up. I felt same as most reviewers beef brisket was dry side. The pulled pork I did enjoy! I felt pulled pork nice and moist combine with the BBQ had nice flavor. The sandwich needed more BBQ make up for the beef brisket but thankfully they have pot of BBQ on the side that you can add much as you please. Also the sandwich did come with slice of cheese (it made no sense that cheese never melted) and sliced raw onions (both things if want without can do). The bread for the sandwich was ok. I had much better at other BBQ restaurants.   My sides (they have lot too choose from) went with the Mac and Cheese, second side jalapeno beans. The Mac and Cheese was ok. The pasta was cooked right on and nice cheddar flavor could have been creamer texture. The Jalapeno beans for me not work at all. The guy like it has nice kick too them. I could hardly taste the kick or see any diced jalapenos in the beans. Overall not much flavor in the beans. Both sides I liked the portion size not huge nor tiny but decent amount.   The sweet tea was disappointing for me. I use too Raising Cane sweet tea here just not even come close. I felt like needed more sugar in it. They do offer both sweet and non sweet tea.   The service was great! The guy at counter was very helpful being my first time. Not sure if manager but also came around asking all the guest checking up see if enjoy the food. Every staff member had smile on their faces and friendly. There wait staff you go up too the counter order and most part they put everything together then pay.   Overall thought the Westerner was good sandwich. It was nice hearty, filling, and sides just ok. So much more better BBQ around Vegas. It not high on my list but since close too my house probably be back again."}
{"text":"Super unhappy- food was pretty good, but the menu was not super clear and when we asked for clarification, the manager gave us misinformation and then denied it later.  Not going back."}
{"text":"Dickey's Barbecue Pit is a barbecue establishment that serves a variety of classic BBQ main dishes and sides. Each day, they offer a special lunch/dinner meal, which comes with a side and drink. It's slightly discounted compared to purchasing it at full price when it is not on the \"special of the day.\"   When you walk into the door, you get a waft of bbq smell. FYI, you and your clothes will definitely smell like bbq when you leave... It is obviously not the best establishment for people who do not eat pork, beef, or chicken. There are few vegetarian sides available, so best to pick a different place if that's not your jam...There are many classic menu options, such as beef brisket, pulled pork sandwich, etc. Classic sides include mac & cheese, beans, baked potato, etc. If you are finding a place for a family, this is a good option, minus the fact that it's on the slightly pricier side. They do have a kids menu.  In addition to the food you can order, they offer free ice cream while supplies last in store, located by the drinks. When you get your drink cup, don't throw it away! You can reuse the cups and get ~$1 off you next drink when you return with the cup. All the bbq sauces are located by the drinks, so you can make your dish as dry or as \"wet\" as you like.   I have recently begun the keto lifestyle, so there are many meat options to fulfill your macro needs. As for sides, the only real keto options are a side caesar salad (ask for no croutons with dressing on the side) and green beans. They do have creamed spinach, but per myfitnesspal.com, it comes out to 18g carbs and 6g of fiber= 12 total net carbs. For my keto friends out there, their original bbq sauce has 10 grams per 2 TBS.   While many people can bbq food for a cheaper price, this is a place to go if you want some quality bbq with a short wait. Check them out if you're in the Mesa area!"}
{"text":"First time at Dickeys and I have to say we loved it , I had green beans and mac and cheese with brisket and smoked spicy sausage , husband had brisket and ribs  and green beans with sweet tea  .The meat were moist and tender the green beans are great cornbread was good spicy sausage was a high point of my meal we will definitely eat there again"}
{"text":"The meat was really good, but it was cold for some reason? Mac n cheese wasn't good (tasted like something out of a box), and fries were nothing special. Really expensive for just an ok bbq."}
{"text":"I ordered the Brisket/Rib combo plate. Brisket was dry and had no flavor. Ribs were even worse. Lacked any smoke flavor and i had to drown the ribs in sauce to make it taste edible. The only reason i'm giving this place 3 stars is because the workers are all very nice and for fast food it's a nice change. If you are desperate for BBQ this place could work."}
{"text":"If you're craving the McRib at a time when it's not offered at McD's, then Dickey's has got you covered!  Don't be fooled by the smell.. Dickey's is to BBQ what Taco Bell is to Mexican. I went to Dickey's for lunch and ordered the Westerner, a sandwich with pulled pork and sausage, along with macaroni and cheese and loaded mashed potatoes. The sandwich wasn't horrible. It just wasn't good. The bread was pretty nice. Someone on here described the Mac and Cheese and being Krafty. To that I say, don't get your hopes up. Kraft is much better then their cheese sauce concoction. The loaded mashed potatoes were actually pretty good as was the sweet tea. I finished my meal with a complimentary cone. It was labeled ice cream, but don't get your hopes up. It's cold and has an appearance similar to ice cream, but it's definitely not ice cream.  The service was good, the place was clean and the prices were reasonable. I think it's a great place to take kiddos. I don't think I'd make an effort to go back, but I wouldn't be opposed to it if I had a coupon. Bon appetit."}
{"text":"Finally made it out to check out the new Rainbow location and I like it a lot better than the location on the Boulevard because of efficiency and speed of service. I got here on a weekday around 12:30 for lunch and it wasn't very packed at all. I placed my order, paid, got my drink and my food was ready before I even found a seat. Awesome! At the other location I've experienced longer wait times even though there are only a couple people in line, mix ups and sometimes even issues at the register.   I went with a rib plate that included 2 sides and a roll for 13 bucks. The plate came with 5 ribs, which were good overall although some pieces were a little chewy. I got mac and cheese and a Caesar salad for my 2 sides. Their mac and cheese was very cheesy as usual which I love but the salad was a little overdressed for my taste. The roll was meh since it was just a roll and I didn't really bother to eat it. I'll be coming to this location more versus the old one because service here causes a lot less headaches. Their food isn't the best but it's probably one of the better fast food/chain BBQ joints around, especially in Vegas, and will fill you up quick for cheap."}
{"text":"Service and quality of food were top notch - LOVED the pulled pork. I ordered online and the  it was simple. The food was ready when I arrived. The ribs were fall off the bone. The pulled pork was perfect and the spicy sauce REALLY good.    Will definitely be heading back there in the near future!"}
{"text":"Came here again with some co-workers. Lesson learned from the last time we were here, no more splitting family meals with a bunch of hungry adults. I think this time we all got our own meals. Two meat meal was my choice no sharing. Texas style brisket was good but probably should have done the sliced brisket, looked bigger and not chopped up. The turkey was juicy and good too. There was ice cream.  They were fast with bringing out our food. Don't mess with hungry peoples food. But still pricey didn't have any lunch special prices."}
{"text":"So much for your price. The guy at the counter is nice & he offers you extra sause, pickles, onions the drink vup is huge!. Only drag is the pounding/ chopping of the awesome meat you have to endure as you eat the yummy food."}
{"text":"Good food, fast and friendly service.  I enjoy going here in a pinch.  Very nice staff."}
{"text":"Good stuff.... I always have more sides than I should. ( mac and cheese is awesome) quick and tastey place for lunch."}
{"text":"Considering this is a quick-serve, almost fast-food style BBQ place, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of their BBQ. It was easily among the best I've been fortunate enough to enjoy. We had hot links, ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. All were smoky, juicy, and tender. No complaints there. Their selection of sauces was on point as well. Standard, sweet, and spicy. Loved the spicy variation. Loved seeing the crushed red pepper floating around in there.   The service on the other hand -- nothing to write home about. Like I said, Dickey's should be a quick-serve restaurant. When we visited, it wasn't quick serve at all. Line out the door -- even being 20 minutes before closing -- and the folks weren't exactly moving the customers through. I spent 15 minutes in line before I ordered, and probably another 7 before my order was in my hands ready to eat. Like I said, the BBQ is great, but we had to wait forever for it.  Convenient location too -- just south of the Strip, past Mandalay Bay in the south outlet center."}
{"text":"Decided to have barbecue for lunch and stopped in for take out. We ordered one and and a half pounds total of sliced brisket, chopped brisket, and polish sausage. Our order also came with one pint of creamed spinach. The food tasted good but the meat was a bit on the drier side and the sausage was too greasy for my liking. Also, the amount of chopped brisket was on the skimpy side. Overall, everything had a charred and hearty flavor but I think the quality was a little average. It is a bit overpriced for the amount of food they serve--it didn't quite seem like a pound and a half. On the plus side, our food did stay hot even through the ride home, they provided us with utensils and napkins, and they do have a barbecue sauce bar so you can load up on tons of sauce! I'd give an overall rating of 3.5."}
{"text":"I give this 4 stars because I'm from Texas and yer just not going to find BBQ like Texas. That being said I really like Dickey's. The chopped pork sandwich is my thing with fried okra (well done) and the mashed potato has sour cream and cheese = yummy! I like the fact that i get free ice cream when I go there and their spicy BBQ sauce is awesome. Everyone is pretty friendly for the most part and the place seemed to be nice and clean. Writing this review makes me want to go there right now, so off I go. ;)  ps: Why is yelp asking me if this place has Gender Neutral Restrooms. Are you people retarded?"}
{"text":"They just opened this week. Nice and clean inside the restaurant. Staff was pushy while I was trying to decipher the complicated menu. Not a lot of seating as it's located in a retail strip.   I saw meat on the counter with a date sticker that had the yesterdays date. I asked about it and said I didn't want yesterday's food. The employee said it was fresh. I asked how it was fresh if it was dated the day before. He just said \"that's how we do it\".  Not sure how that works.   Food tastes okay. Nothing special. Not enough smoke and the sides were okay."}
{"text":"For a quick BBQ fix this is the place to go! Meat is consistent, sauce is good, I had the brisket, pulled pork and ribs all very good! It was almost as good as some of mom and pop joint in VA. The only thing I suggest is STAY AWAY FROM THE POTATO SALAD. The consistency was not that great and it tasted like mashed pickles. Overall delicious place I am going back as soon as I get a chance."}
{"text":"(4) Stars based on fast courteous service, cleanliness, and overall experience but lost one for quality control.  Today was the first time I've been served chicken that could not be described as moist but it did still have the great flavor.  Meat was served on an improved bun which could brioche but that's a guess, regardless it's an improvement over the standard white bread synonymous with BBQ.  The soft serve machine was out of service which was a disappointment but neutral to the star rating as I saved a few hundred calories and was issued a rain check."}
{"text":"Really Google BBQ.  Highly recommended the mac and cheese, cheesy and we'll cooked pasta. Need to come back and try some other items. Bonus is the souvenir cup. Good sized cup and while I may only use it to rinse off my dogs during a wash it is also recyclable. I had the fried okra, stole some from the hubby. Also you can control your heat and size of your BBQ sauce. They have a dispenser.  Clever and clean place. Big ups."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout one evening, the food is bomb asf! The only downfall was, they were limited on the selection of sides but I think this was due to the place closing soon which I can understand! Brisket f*ckin good! The chicken was cooked just right & the pork was okay!"}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place! Excellent service,  fast friendly. Clean very well maintained, bathrooms included. Fantastic food!!  I've had the pulled pork sandwich as well as the ribs both are delicious as well as the sides. Ice cream is included definitely a wonderful surprise. I definitely recommend Dickey's and will be returning often."}
{"text":"Sauce is everything. Tender meaty ribs. Pull pork. Potato salad. Baked beans mac and cheese. Sweet ice tea. All were good. Not feeling the seasoning the green beans were cook with. Really liked eating on the patio"}
{"text":"Quick tip: wash your lettuce before you serve it, thanks! Compliments to the chef :)  Highly unimpressed.  Will not be back."}
{"text":"They have great food, I got the beef brisket sandwich and it was delicious it was a great blend of beef and BBQ sauce, unlike most places they don't drown ur food in BBQ. Also the beef was moist and juicy. On the side I got Mac and cheese, it was good but nothing special. Overall this place is great and if ur looking for some BBQ this is the place to go."}
{"text":"First time at this Dickie's. I arrived at 12:15 on a Monday and it was as 1/3 full. I stepped right up and ordered a two-meat plate: brisket, jalape√±o cheddar kielbasa, baked beans, cole slaw and a roll. I added a soft drink for a total of $15.93.   The sides were pretty standard, so no complaints there. The sausage was very tasty, with good amounts of jalape√±o and cheddar. The brisket was very dry. The meat cutter even hesitated while cutting it, trying to decide if he should serve it. He said he had to use up the piece before unwrapping another.   Sadly, the brisket has always been my benchmark for good BBQ and this location failed me.   Probably no return visit."}
{"text":"Food: This is good place to get some fast service and good food. The overall quality of their food is pretty good. I usually get their BBQ pulled pork sandwich with a side of their loaded baked potato casserole (a definite must try!). I love the fact that they have 3 different BBQ sauces out at all times, and they are pretty darn good! Beyond that they always have self serve vanilla ice cream out which is a great way to end the meal.  Service: The service is fast, kind and effective. The menu is really easy to read and understand, and has several images.  Location: This location is found in a small shopping center with a dollar store and little ceasar. The inside of the restaurant is always very clean and it is cute"}
{"text":"Great BBQ!   The staff are friendly and love the free ice cream.  Only problem I had was the sweet tea, It had a funny taste to it, it was either old tea or they aren't cleaning there tea brewer.   I'll go back and try it again."}
{"text":"We've been here many time since it opened. Today was the first time the brisket was not tender and juicy but rather, overdone and chewy. This may be due to it being very slow on Easter?  Also note that on 2-3 occasions we've witnessed food preparers handling cash, credit card and the register without removing the gloves they wear to protect the food from contamination.  We are hoping that management becomes aware and retrains the employees on proper use of gloves and food handling. Downgraded score to 4  Previous review:  They're newly opened and busy, but they're doing pretty well with the crowds, all things considered. We ordered a lot of food because we were trying different options. I ordered the pork and jalape√±o cheddar sandwich, which was really tasty. My husband had the brisket, and it was extremely tender and flavorful. He said it was in league with Little Miss BBQ, which is quite a compliment. The okra, cornbread and mashed potatoes were all delicious.  The Mac n cheese and coleslaw were also good. We came home with plenty of leftovers and very full bellies!  We will be ba"}
{"text":"below average BBQ. Had two meat plate. Pulled pork was dry. Had to wet it down with a lot of BBQ sauce. Sliced Brisket was so dry it crumbled apart. Not even BBQ sauce could save it. Jalapeno Beans are VERY bland and not even a HINT of jalapeno.  Original Potato Salad was just OK. I've eaten at Dickey's in other states and really enjoyed them.  Here...not so much. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is like looking for bbq at Arbys.  There is way better Bbq out there for the same price or less.  Where do i start, i usually eat somewhere at least twice before i write a review just to be sure about my experience with that being said i walked in here today about 3pm and ordered to go and we were the only customers in the restaurant the male taking orders was rushing us while we were trying to decide what we wanted to eat we looked at the menu for maybe 15 seconds and he was like are you ready to order we said oh were still looking and 10 seconds later he said are you ready to order its my second time here and i wanted to try something different then the last time, and also i got a $2 off coupon from the last time I came as an apology for not giving us the kids meal we ordered and we waited a long time for(we ordered a kids meal they gave us all our other food but that and the girl at the cash register said i will bring it out to you i walked up there and asked her for the kids meal and she looked at me like i was dumb then ignored me and then a man walked up and asked what are you waiting for and i told him a kids meal and he said oh okay we will get it right out to you, well..... we all finished our meal by that time they brought it out which mistakes happen but the cashier was super rude)but anyways back to the ordering so i told them i had the coupon for 2 pulled pork sandwiches and then also got a brisket sandwich and then got macaroni and cheese, potato salad and Cole slaw as sides. The sandwich bread was soggy probably just too much butter not a big deal.  The meat tasted old and was cold nor did anything we ordered have any flavor and its not cheap. I definitely wont come back here."}
{"text":"Decided to give the place a try last Saturday. Simple and clean. Loved the brisket sandwhich. My two sides included coleslaw and mac&cheese. Sampled my friend's waffel fries. Food was delicious and reminded me of typical southern slow smoked BBQ. Sauces were tasty and jar of pickles and soft serve ice cream added a nice touch. We were both filled and satisfied. Employees were young high school age. They were couteous and helpful.  Mrs Owner came out, said hello, and asked what we thought.  I have been back and I will be back."}
{"text":"Ah! not impressed! For real pit B.B.Q is pretty easy  To execute, this place didn't do a very good job of that My first time there, and i have to say say it was just ok! I bought 3 two meat dinners so my wife and I could try some  Variety. They should offer a 3 meat dinner, spicy sausage was not good, green beans  Were tastless! Okra was very good, portion size is horrible you can acually see them Weighing the shredded meats and only 2 bones for a combo plate w/ sausage And 2 vey small sides for almost $11 a rip off! not a value for the quality"}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way to the airport - just looking for a place with good food to run in and out of quickly. Dickey's complied to our needs.  For $7 they offer a double meat sandwich with two sides. I ordered pulled pork (one can order two different meats however). I was expecting a little more meat on a double meat sandwich - glad I didn't order a \"single meat\" sandwich. The pork was quite good though as were the waffle fries and cole slaw sides. Free drink refills choice of 3 different sauces.  Glad I stopped in here - I'll keep it in mind for future airport runs and whenever I'm looking for a decent BBQ sandwich in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I don't know if these are corporate restaurants or franchises, but in either case, this particular location is pretty bad.  First of all, we went for dinner at 5 pm and after waiting 20 minutes to get to the ordering counter, they tell us they are out of brisket.  WTH?  What BBQ joint runs out of brisket at 5 pm?  And they don't have a sign in the window or at least a chalk board when you walk in, to tell that there is no brisket????  At least 80% of the 50 or so people behind me want brisket too.  OMG!!!  Their order taking and prep system was designed by the 3 stooges.  3 people trying to help customers and they are trying their best, but their \"system\" is atrocious.  Instead of using a production line system, each person tries to do everything.  So let's start at the beginning.  You order your plate -- either 1,2, or 3 meats.  Let's say you want a 2 meat plate with pulled pork and smoked turkey.  So the guy goes to the warmer and takes out a pork butt and a turkey breast, all wrapped in saran wrap.  He pulls your portion of pork off and cuts a few slices of turkey breast; wraps the unused portions back up and puts them back into the warmer.  Now the next customer wants pulled pork too, so he goes back to the warmer and takes out the newly wrapped pork butt, that he just re-wrapped 15 seconds ago, pulls off the saran wrap, and preps a portion for the next guy --- WTH?    Now he does this while wearing those food server gloves, which is a good thing.  But then he has to take them off to scoop the sides into little paper cups -- beans, cole slaw, potato salad, etc. etc.  Then he pushes your plate to the girl at the cash register so she can ring you up.  He then goes back to the meat prep station and has to put on gloves again.  Now when the girl at the cash register is done ringing you up, she goes to the meat prep station and puts on gloves to help the next person in line with their order.....like I said, it's like watching the 3 stooges in action.  Meats have very little if any smoke flavor.  Ribs are very salty and the dry rub in not flavorful.  BBQ sauces are thin and have no depth of flavor.  Sides are pathetic -- coleslaw is very similar to coleslaw at KFC....I call this kind of coleslaw grass clippings from my lawnmower--chopped up bits of cabbage and lousy dressing.  Beans came out of a can.  Other sides are meh....but the waffle fries and onion strings are OK.  And to top this all off, they have no burnt ends and no rib tips!  Prices are higher than average for below average food, IMO.    I know this review is critical, but other Yelpers should know that good places from the bad."}
{"text":"The ribs were very chewy like jerky, and very salty. The bones were small and breaking. Not a great experience. The sides were good..coleslaw and spinach. Mashed potatoes (\"casserole\") and someone in our party got fries and Mac n cheese they liked. The turkey had a good flavor and wasn't dry, same with pulled pork. I think it's pretty lame that we were served stale and hard dinner rolls."}
{"text":"The first thing I ate after a 9 day fast, 7 days on a restricted diet, then 2 days on a clear liquid diet. This good should have tasted like the best food in the world.  I ordered,  a 3 meat plate and two extra rolls. I had about three table spoons of brisket, half of a polish sausage and two of the smallest ribs I ever saw.  I knew the macaroni and cheese would be good but it tasted like straight up paste and had no cheese flavor. They only had waffles fries which were too hard, none of of meaty (you call it creamy) potato texture. Ribs were cooked on a grill so they had no smoke flavor whatsoever. Brisket was a bit dry, Polska kielbasa was okay but I would have liked it is light bit crispier like grilled sausage.  Then those rolls, were greasy, didn't taste of butter, they were more like biscuits, I paid $1.09 for those two extra biscuits and threw 1 and 1/2 in the trash. The barbecue sauce wasn't very sweet like the manager said but failed to say that regular and sweet taste exactly the same, I don't even want to know how spicy the spicy was.  My sister had a rack of ribs which is about five bones worth, with mashed potatoes which she did eat, so I guess they were okay. My sister also had creamed spinach which had that same pasty taste as my mac n cheese.  We gave it place a thumbs down, we don't want to go back. I would have had wings but they had only boneless skinless breast,  code name, dry and tasteless. We spent $40, it absolutely was not worth the money!"}
{"text":"First time at Dickey's. Heard all about them on the radio. Arrived at 11:15 on a Friday morning. Second in line but still waited 12 mins, since it was a one-at-a-time service counter. He was meticulous at weighing each item, seemingly adjusting 1/10 ounce discrepancies, which created lots of scraps.   My lunch took time to assemble and consisted of a 2-meat plate (I got brisket and jalape√±o cheddar kielbasa). I added a drink for a total of $15.94. It got off to an auspicious start, since one of my side dishes was the wrong item. She promptly replaced it and offered me to keep the mistake in a pleasant manner.   The condiment area offered 3 BBQ sauces: regular, sweet plus spicy. I chose the Spicy and was pleasantly surprised that it was!  The meat portions looked to be about 4 ounces each, which was a bit skimpy for $16. Most others give 1/2 pound portions. The brisket was over cooked but had good flavor. The jalape√±o link was excellent, with good spice level, lots of cheese and good snap.   The sides were good too. The Mac and Cheese was pretty basic but the beans were exceptional. Good BBQ flavor, well cooked and hearty. The potato casserole (mashed potatoes) was well assembled as well. I hadn't ordered it but would order it again. I enjoyed the buttery, garlicky hints.   The country music was extremely loud, which made me wish I'd taken it to go."}
{"text":"Just had lunch with my mom here and the food was great! Try the loaded potatoe side, it's awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I got the pulled pork sandwich, mac n cheese and mashes potatoes for $9.50 and it was perfect. No complaints. The portions are good size, and trust me it will make you extremely full."}
{"text":"The meat is bbq less. Who wants to add sauce to their own bbq...not me. It was 3 star worthy. The fries & beans were just ok. Will I return maybe."}
{"text":"Have come here since it opened.  Haven't been here for a little while and ate there this evening and was disappointed.  Side portions got smaller.  Had side salad that was over chilled in frig.  Lettuce was slightly freezer burned and wilted, ham was dry, not as good as it usually has been.  Must have been and off night.  Ice cream always a delight."}
{"text":"It was pretty good. The meats were tender sauce was tasty. We had brisket, chicken and ribs. Mac and cheese and jalapeno beans not so good. Will try again tjough"}
{"text":"The meat is fantastic here. I love their jalape√±o beans.   Even their Caesar salad is good.  This time we tried their mashed potato casserole and potato salad. I would order them again. Come hungry because portions are large"}
{"text":"I think after my experiences here, three stars is about as good as it gets for this place.  I've been to Dickey's quite a few times and while the lure of soft serve (and self serve) ice cream is interesting at best, the BBQ is decent.  I'm not saying it's the best I've ever had, or that the service is fast and attentive.  What I AM saying is that if you like BBQ it's a place to try.  It's not usually packed (even though it's not a really big place) but it somehow runs out of food on occasion.  I've been by Dickey's to get some ribs and the ribs are on the \"Sorry we're out of...\"-sign.  How does this happen??  I guess perhaps I'm spoiled by Vegas being a 24 hour city and I expected too much.  I guess BBQ places in other cities run out of product occasionally...perhaps."}
{"text":"The food is delicious. The jalape√±o cheddar kielbasa and polish kielbasa was juicy and yummy. The mac n cheese and mashed potatoes were hearty. The buns were soft and tasted fresh. Their BBQ sauces are out of this world. I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place for awhile. We walked and and were so excited, the smell the sounds it was almost BBQ overload!! We walked around and got the lay of the land and ordered the 2 meat plate with 2 sides and roll. Let me tell you too many choices are a good thing, good thing my wife was with me to divide and conquer. We tried the brisket, the kielbasa and the turkey for our meats and the beans, Mac and cheese, green beans and creamed spinach for our sides. Let start by saying I hate smoked turkey it's dry and just terrible,, NOT here it is so juicy and flavorful! I couldn't stop eating it. The brisket was top notch and the kielbasa was like my grandfather made!! The sides were outstanding. So tasty! My wife said the beans were some of the best she has had!! The staff were friendly and took care of us each step of the way.. if you are near a Dickey's you have to stop in it is worth the trip!!!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes before venturing to Dickey's.  Unfortunately my hopes were dashed.  It would have probably have been wise to leave shortly after entering this establishment.  After ordering my food, I observed some \"sketchy\" sanitation practices...one of which believe it or not was the server preparing my sides literally eating a chunk of meat while doing so.  You don't have to be a health inspector to know that is not allowed!  The briscuit and turkey was dry and nearly tasteless.  Avoid this place like the plague, it shouldn't be hard to find better BBQ than this...heck, after rating this place with 1 Star, almost anyplace would be better."}
{"text":"Do not even try this place... The WORST food I have ever eaten... I love BBQ and have lived in Central Texas for awhile... I thought a BBQ Place by my house was bad... I need to apologize to them... This place is the worst place I have ever eaten... Ever... I have never had food this bad ever..."}
{"text":"Hard to beat this BBQ.  Not usually a franchise fan, but Dickey's has got it down!"}
{"text":"Went in and there was nobody in line. Placed meat order and went to sides guy who proceeded to open the potato casserole which is in a bag and not made fresh. At least open the bag in the back and not in front of the customer.  He then proceeded to squeeze out the potatoes in front of me. Then he walked away to help customers at other tables who were missing food. At this point you have touched numerous trays, doors, and food with your gloves. That's a sanitation issue. Yet still haven't come back to even finish the food I'm not going to eat. Didn't even ask me what other items I had ordered. After 10 minutes of watching this display I walked out. Sure new places have kinks but this was unacceptable. Food coming out of a bag is not something you want to see anywhere. Meaning it's boiled or microwaved to heat up. Won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"For a quick BBQ pick up, this food is pretty good. I don't like their bread rolls though, tastes kind of plastic like"}
{"text":"First off, the description on their website about the meat platters is not accurate for this particular location. This is not enough to quench a meat eater's craving as it falls a lot smaller in portion than what I was expecting. I ended up getting two orders of the 2 meat option (brisket & pulled pork) with fried onions and mac & cheese for carry out. What I ordered smelled amazing and the aroma got me so excited to dig into these two plastic wrapped bundles.   However, to my shock, the meats and fried onions were disproportionate in serving. The brisket and pulled pork serving in one to-go container was smaller than the other, very annoying. Not to mention that their fried onions, the one thing that didn't seem pre-packaged, also came out disproportionate.   I have no idea if this is just a \"to-go\" thing, but I'm willing to try \"dine-in\" options."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my hubby there yesterday. It was better than I expected. I am not a huge BBQ fan because sometimes all you taste is the liquid smoke. No matter what the meat. However, this place is so delicious. I tried a bit if everything, the chicken was juicy, the brisket tender, the pulled pork savory and the ribs were the best I've had in a while. My husband agreed. They have a side of the actual BBQ sauce for you to put as much on your plate as you want. Plus, the soft serve frozen yogurt at the end isn't a bad deal for the kids. We'll be going back."}
{"text":"My wife and I looked forward to eating here for weeks. We decided to get one of our favorites tonight, bbq pork ribs. Let me say... extremely disapointed! Neither one of us would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Eh. I've heard people swear by these guys, but I just can't give a good review.  The food was ok... service wasn't good... took forever to get the food.  One thing that seemed pretty weird is that they had a weight loss infomercial on the whole time.  Um... have they not heard of the psychology of the eater?  It's better to have cooking shows on to make people eat more... not weight loss! We don't want to be reminded how this pulled pork is going straight to our hips!  There are other better bbq places real close to this place."}
{"text":"I'm from KC and I think this bbq is just so so. Nothing they make stands out where I could give them better rating for their food. As for staff, cleanliness and things like that I would give them a 5 though. I wish there was more to say but it and average bbq place"}
{"text":"Do not waste your money or evening out at dickeys. Poor service and average food. Go to Applebee's at least there you know what you're going to get.   That's all I have to say about that."}
{"text":"As you can see, I haven't been to this restaurant since October of 2015 because of a poor experience. Well, today I finally went again. I was craving barbecue and my friend didn't want Lucille's because he said it was heavy. He suggested Dickey's, which I was reluctant to go to. But, I did. This experience wasn't any better. We walked up and there was no line. The guys who were chopping the meat greeted us. One of the guys said, \"we'll take your order in a minute, we need to get this catering order done.\" We waited five minutes. I got the special which was a sandwich with polish sausage and pulled pork. The sausage was rubbery and tasteless. They hardly included any pork in the sandwich. I basically had a barbecue sauce sandwich. The fried okra and creamed spinach were good. But, I felt ripped off spending $10.95 plus tax for lunch with no drink. And, to top the experience off, the ice cream machine was out of order! Another Dickey's fail! Save your money and go to Lucille's."}
{"text":"I had a good experience.service was great especially Josef who is very friendly and made my time at Dickeys a pleasant moment. The food was also good really good and the prices are great. Give it a try and make your own opinion!!l I will come back for sure so they deserve a 5*"}
{"text":"The chicken was great.. So was the pork and brisket (even though it was a little dry). The only issue I see is that the order process needs to be simplified.  Otherwise a good meal."}
{"text":"I herd this place food was awesome so I tired it our! It was okay not amazing but I do like the onion things and their turkey is great the pulled pork is very Greasy but I'd still recommend trying it for your self!"}
{"text":"This place is the only BBQ Pit worth the trip too! Love the food and Joe the Pit Master was very helpful in making suggestions and very professional. Update: went back and the employee who made my experience great is no longer an employee. And the staff now on floor was as ambitious or helpful! Lowered the stars to 3.  On a note, just so everyone knows they run out of certain popular menu items because they make it fresh it is not frozen and thawed meat so if you decide to pop in late and want that special meaty goodness you may have to wait until the next day or go early and place an order so they have your meats you want.   Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Took the fam out for barbecue at Dickey's the other night and I must say it was really GOOD.  We ordered the family meal which was plenty for the four of us. I haven't had brisket this good since I lived in West Texas.  We'll be going back!"}
{"text":"I got the 2 meat combo plate. Super tender briskets and juicy chicken. I'm getting back in line to get more fore my pops!"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout twice the first time was absolutely incredible the second time there was an issue with our order it was delivered and complete. The manager wasted no time bringing us the remainder of our order along with some coupons and bonus item. The meets were cooked to perfection, the sides are delicious and the pricing is pretty good. This is definitely our go to barbecue spot in surprise!"}
{"text":"2nd time trying this joint 1st was a better experience but this time was bad.ordered the special brisket sandwich and it was ice cold.slow service place in need of a good wipe down.this place charges high end prices for low end quality,not that it is authentic bbq but i would rather drive up blue diamond and get famous daves. will not return.."}
{"text":"It's rare to find some place my husband, my kids and I agree upon eating, but this place it the spot we all love! The food is delicious, the service is nice and a plus, every Sunday kids eat free (with every adult plate).  Lauren, the manager, is also great!"}
{"text":"I was surprised this place only gave a few ribs and a pickle and onion. Also the 3 ribs I got one was real dried out. The sides were ok but nothing great. I wouldn't go again."}
{"text":"They taste better then some other places and yes did make a mistake but the manager was very professional and we get a free 2 dinner's next time. Good Manager!! Free Good Guy."}
{"text":"People were very helpful while we were choosing our food the first time we went. The meat was delicious but I was hoping for more with the sides. But again, totally worth it for the pulled pork, brisket and ribs."}
{"text":"Jalapeno beans were too watery.  Ribs were very salty on the hard outter layer of meat.  Chicken was ok..  I liked their sweet bbq sauce.  Maybe I'll try the pulled pork next time.  The prices were kind of high for what they offer.  The free ice cream had a weird greasy texture."}
{"text":"I really like Texas food.  Yeah, Tex-Mex for sure.  But, real Texas food... Texas BBQ!  So if you like genuine Texas BBQ, Hot Links, Pulled Pork, then look no further; this is your place. Everything, but beer as they say!  We've been here a few times now and have enjoyed their Brisket, Pulled Pork, and a number of their sausages items.  The sides are equally good, such as Fried Okra, Jalape√±o Beans, Fried Onion Tanglers, and Creamy Coleslaw.  All good, A-Ok.    So how do I rate Dickey's when Yelp gives you the choice of Two Stars (Meh. I've experienced better) or Three Stars (A-OK)?  Well the answer is, we would agree.  I'm sorry for the unintended pun, but both are true.  Have we enjoyed better?  Yep, Texas Roadhouse or Famous Dave's in Mesa comes to mind real quick.  So, is the food A-Ok?  Sure. Absolutely.  So what is Dickey's?   It's just a quick, inexpensive place when you feel like Texas BBQ, and not thirty minute drive to Mesa.  It works for what it is.  So 2 1/2 Stars!  Like I said, everything but beer."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today, this location has been open for about a month. Had a BBQ Pork sandwich with waffle fries.  With a drink (souvenier cup no less!) It came out to around $10.  The ordering menu is a little confusing, they could use a few lunch specials.  The have family packs you can order, it reminded me of a fast food version of a Famous Dave's.  In the end it was pretty good, a nice restaurant in a nice developing area.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Dude. This place is HEAVENLY.   Been here about four or five times with my girlfriend and we have never walked out disappointed, however we went last night around 8:30 and we were beyond satisfied...  Dickey's has daily specials - $9.99 each. Yesterdays was a pulled pork and spicy cheddar sausage sandwich and it came with two sides. I got the mac and cheese and waffle iron fries, my GF got the fried okra and jalapeno beans. If you've read my past reviews you know I'm stupidly lactose intolerant - yeah, no, I regret nothing because this mac and cheese was like a tiny orchestra playing O Fortuna in my mouth (Google it). Also, I tried fried okra for the first time here and let me wish every other establishment that gets blessed with my presence good luck because Dickey's set the okra bar PRI-TY high. The beans are always perfect; the fries are always a crispy gold. Ugh, delicious.  Not to be outdone by the food, Dickey's also offers a variety of self-serve BBQ sauces for those of you who are like me and like to DRENCH their food in sauce. Go big or go home, right? My favorite is the spicy flavor. In addition to the sauces, they have packaged ketchup which I always appreciate because it minimizes the amount of wasted product (plus I can take my unused ones home and stash in my \"unused condiments\" drawer for when the struggle is real). And instead of those ugly WHITE plastic utensils, you get pretty silver utensils for when you're feeling classy but need to be reminded that, hey, you're eating BBQ and are gonna get messy so don't take yourself so seriously.  Dickey's also offers pecan pie for purchase and self-serve ice cream cones FO FREE! The drinks come in these large plastic yellow souvenir cups that are absolutely perfect for traveling or drinks on the go. I think my GF and I have about six now.   Okay - so I said last night I was beyond satisfied and believe it or not, it wasn't exactly because of the food. Again, if you've read my previous posts you'll know that I am a firm believer that no matter how good your food is it means nothing if your service sucks and if your service sucks I will not return. The service here is always great but last night the staff went beyond ANY customer service I've ever received. Every time we walk in we're immediately greeted. This time we were greeted by a young man named Dustin. I'm not sure how old Dustin is but obviously at least 16 (Dustin, if you're reading this and you're a lot older than 16, I'm sorry. I too get mistaken for a 16 year old and I'm 26. We'll be thankful for it later). Dustin had the manners that I hope my children have one day. It was \"ma'am\" this and \"sir\" that. He thanked us for coming in, he checked on us when we were eating. Rather than go up to ask for boxes, he came and brought some for us. My GF ended up tipping twice LOL.   In addition to Dustin there was also another gentleman whose name I didn't get. He was working the grill and had the best attitude - very friendly, charismatic, patient. At one point during our meal another customer went to the counter and told them their rolls were hard and their pork was cold, then looked at his \"companion\" and asked \"any other complaints?\" Honestly a few other comments they made, made me realize these people were a bit obnoxious. Regardless I watched the staff apologize and remake their meal. After giving the couple their new food I continued watching the staff, waiting to see an eye-roll or look of frustration. Nope, I was wrong. They all just went back to doing their job and that impressed me. It was near closing time and it would've been easy to be a bit annoyed but they weren't - instead they made the customers happy because regardless of how wrong someone may be, the customer is \"always right.\" Honestly I was beyond impressed. Thank you all for doing what you do and not only making the most amazing BBQ food but for providing the best customer service my girlfriend and I have ever received. We've been to a lot of restaurants, a lot of hotels, many businesses, etc., and this is the first time I was ever excited to write a review on a business based solely on the way they conducted themselves.  Okay, I'm getting all sentimental now.  Fin."}
{"text":"It took me 2 years but I finally found it...A proper pulled pork sandwich.  I really wanted to give Dickey's 4.5 stars and round to 5, but I couldn't. It's honestly a 3.5 that I rounded to a 4 (but a solid 3 in the south).  Don't let the shopping center location and chain restaurant appearance fool you. This place is the real deal...For certain items.  But...they just try to go in too many directions. They want to try to compete in all these genres of BBQ, and as anyone who is a die-hard BBQ fanatic knows, you just can't combine it all under one roof without compromising each item. The prices are in line with the quality and certainly the quantity. A Sandwich plate with side, and drink averages about $7 A combo plate with 2 meats, 2 sides, and dinner roll is about $10 Unless you are going to chug down a 32 oz tea while you dine in then take another with you don't bother with the BIG Yellow Cup. It's a $2 upcharge.  5 Stars for:  Pulled pork, Sweet Tea, Okra, Baked potato casserole, Loaded Baked potato stuffed with pulled pork, and FREE soft serve ice cream cones.  4 Stars for: Brisket-Not the best i've ever had, but Damn Good for the price. Sauce-3 types: regular, hot, sweet) I mix them together and it finds a decent balance depending on the meat. The pork sandwich really needs a savory, spicy vinegar based sauce, but this thicker sweeter sauce still has a little brine to the flavor so it works ok. Having Waffle fries Super friendly service 3 Stars for: The sausages (They are now advertising that they have trippled the cheddar in the spicy cheddar sausage...so i guess pretty soon they will just have spicy grilled cheddar?)  & Almost everything else on the menu. Friendly...but sometimes forgetful service. (There is no waiter service but there's small order mistakes about 25% of the time. 2 Stars for: The Ribs... & How the HELL do you mess up Mac N Cheese.  My recommended order:  2 meat plate with brisket and chopped pork (add a bun on the side) sides of Okra and Fries; and The pork stuffed baked potato. (If you are from Memphis, the coleslaw is decent, and works well enough for a Memphis style sandwich.)"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me?  I was disappointed after seeing all the good reviews. It is fast food BBQ. If you want a McRib and McDonalds is not Serving them go here. Do not go here if you want real BBQ. This place sucks!"}
{"text":"The food was delicious and they gave you just enough--not enough to put a person in a meat coma--which I prefer. Had more of their food in the Cedar City, Utah area so I got to pig out. Love the beans and brisket and pulled pork! The service? Could've been better. Seemed like a couple of bored teens were working there that afternoon. We were new to the place and we didn't feel welcomed nor instructed on the ordering process. Customer service is important. It decides if you will have returning customers which will keep your business running."}
{"text":"Love the food but the last experience I had kinda made me not want to get food from the Goodyear location anymore.. the girl cashier was rude, looked at me like I was stupid for asking if an drink came with the meal, looked me with a stupid expression and said \"nope\". Rude. Then I was mimicked by one of the guys working up front, when trying to get my two year olds attention-  rude. Maybe have a girl who knows what a smile is working the register instead. Just an idea."}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I have had in a long time! Cheddar sausage and brisket, The Absolute Best!  Don't live on this side of town but will come again for sure."}
{"text":"We always get takeout and it has always been great! Love the fall-off-the-bone ribs!!! I'm getting hungry already!"}
{"text":"I was really hoping this would be a hit for me since it's close to home, unfortunately it was nothing special. The portions were small & I wasn't a fan of their bbq sauce at all. The smoked turkey was pretty good & it had a great smokey flavor but the sauce was so vinegary I couldn't even eat it. Really good fries & they have free ice cream which my toddler loved. I won't be rushing back."}
{"text":"Once a month my church, Scottsdale Center for Spiritual Living hosts brunch after service. We usually have 14 people. Well over 20 enthusiastic people showed up to Dickey's BBQ! Everyone loved it! We kind of took the staff by surprise right after they opened, but they handled the service wonderfully! The food was great too, as always."}
{"text":"Got 1/2 pound of brisket.  It was delicious and plenty of meat.  Look forward to trying the sides."}
{"text":"Great bbq and very decently priced. Call ahead to make sure ribs are cooked, or order online to skip the line. Deffinently will be returning. Mac and cheese was some of the best ive ever had."}
{"text":"YUCK!  No joke, the worst bbq my family and I have had.  We went once, didn't even eat,  left and went to another place. So disappointing!"}
{"text":"Wow!  If you go, take a some money with you, you're gonna need it.    Does $21 for a to go order of brisket (1/4 lb) a lg order of beans and a large order of cold slaw and a soda sound excessive?  I do, especially for just mediocre bbq and what is really just pork & beans like the kind you'd get from the can.  I still can't get over how expensive this place.  I'm thinking of going back just to look at the menu to see if they rang up my order incorrectly."}
{"text":"The BBQ for the most part was very good. Waited over 10 minutes for one sandwich and two sides which seemed a little odd. If I rated the food alone it would have been a four star. The cleanliness was sub bar, flies were everywhere and the poor customer service could easily be a two star rating."}
{"text":"Good food, nice staff but I'm waiting for the time I go that they are not out of something. Today it was chicken and Sprite. Last time it was jalape√±o beans and brisket and the time before that is was sausage and ice cream cones. Not sure what the issue is. :-/"}
{"text":"Delicious barbecue and nice people. A little pricey but the servings are large. My favorite is the brisket sandwich."}
{"text":"Excellent!  What a great find while vacationing in Vegas.  We were staying off the strip and my \"other half\" decided he wanted BBQ.  He's a chef, so tends to be quite picky.  We had our 11 year old with us, so we weren't heading out to anything on the strip.  We had driven by Dickey's a few times and decided to walk in and check it out.  The smells were amazing and the line was out the door.  We listened and watched as everyone seemed to have their favorites.  We were the only \"non-local\" in the place, which also says something.  Great flavor, large portions of meat, sides were a bit smaller than I anticipated, but plenty of flavor in most.  The spicy BBQ sauce was wonderful!  Most definitely a go to location on our next trip.  Thanks a bunch to everyone who was working hard, fast and doing a GREAT JOB the day we were in there.  You guys were slammin' busy and never missed a beat!  Kudos on the GREAT FOOD, GREAT SERVICE and serious TEAM WORK!    A Very Happy Customer, Acton, CA"}
{"text":"The crew in this location is awesome! Everyone is super friendly and quick to give you their favorite combos. This time around I did the 2 plate combo w/ turkey and chicken breast, Mac n cheese & green beans. The quality is great and the price is fair for the amount you get. I can't wait to try the spicy kielbasa next time, everyone was raving about it.  You guys have the customer service element down. I'm a a completely satisfied and impressed customer.  Oh!.....and be careful, this spot comes with one side effect..... FOOD COMA! :)"}
{"text":"To be honest it's hard to give this place a fourth star.  Service is awesome, sauce is awesome, food is awesome and there's soft serve.    You walk in and the guys greet you warmly.  Serious issue for me is how you have to order up front but the menu wraps around so that really doesn't help to get in and get which is the true reason for why I just can't push it up.  Been here three times and it's fast."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for the next wonderful brisket which is verrrry hard to find. Well today I found one. I went in for a small sandwich for the drive home. When I got in the car and tasted it, I ran right back in for another to take home. The brisket just almost melted in my mouth, the little french bread was great and the barbque sauce was so good... (they didn't put a sauce in the bag for the second sandwich but I had enough left over). Will definitely go back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Took our family to dinner on Valentine's weekend.  Was excited to try this restaurant.  When we walked in it took the staff a minute to be acknowledged. When they finally took our order they did not even look up. We ordered three chicken sandwiches and a three meat meal. We were very disappointed not only with the service but with the portion size of meal and the quality of the food. We spent $47.00 on our meal and left very dissatisfied. We will never go back to Dickey's, nor will I recommend it."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is incredible.    Amazing, absolutely out of this world flavor on their meat, melt in your mouth delicious... My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  It's that good.  You have to try this at least once.  Make sure you try the smoked brisket, polish sausage and pulled pork, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place so much!!! It's super convenient to my home and I LOVE the drive through. But the brisket was just bad. There's no other word for it. So dry, it crumbled apart. And not in a melt in your mouth way. In a gray, overdone, mealy, shoe leather way. So sad. The Mac and cheese was ok. Nothing special. I'll probably try again and hope this was a fluke but looking at the other reviews about the brisket, I'm not hopeful"}
{"text":"First visit to Dickey's Barbecue Pit and it was delicious! The establishment is nice and clean and well taken care of. The employees were very nice and the manager Josh was very professional and courteous. I enjoyed the two meat combo plate. Pictures are posted. I will definitely be back for more and to try out the different meats. If you are in the area and are craving barbecue, then I recommend Dickey's. I am stuffed and sleepy now. Next stop is Napville, USA!"}
{"text":"Friends had told us to try it so we swung in for lunch last weekend.  It was a great little BBQ shop.  Super casual (almost fast food style) atmosphere.  The staff were very helpful with the menu.  They have great daily specials and we will be back to check them out."}
{"text":"My family and I have gone to Dickey's for years, so we were happy to finally get one in Surprise.  However, when we walked in we didn't even recognize the place.  Different menu, no ice cream machine.  This is no Dickey's, this place sucks."}
{"text":"They just opened here. I loved Dickey's when I lived in Texas. Instead of mesquite, which is big in Texas BBQ they use Hickory. The ribs are tender except if you do a combo you might get the smaller end which is more cooked and smaller. If you order a half or full rack they are tender and very flavorful. The Brisket is very juicy and tender. I was surprised how much I liked the Jalape√±o Cheddar Kielbasa. Just the right amount of heat and melted cheese. Pulled pork is nice and juicy also. Side are of average cup size, and have around 12 to choose from. I've ate here with my wife three times this week and the place is getting fuller and busier too. Goodyear come check this place out you will be glad you did"}
{"text":"UPDATE:  Within 2 hours of posting the review below,  Dickey's contacted me in order to make things right.   Well Done!    I declined their offer for a gift card, but will try their Shea location at some point.     ______________________________________________________ In a world of liars Dickey's would be king.   Having put an ad in the AZ Republic listing a January long special of $1 BBQ pork sandwiches on Mondays I had been driving up to this location after work on Mondays to take advantage of this deal.   The Monday before last they were \"out\" of the pork but were good enough to substitute for another meat. This Monday they decided to NOT honor their advertised special stating \"that isn't for Arizona.\" Your pants sir are on fire.   A. You advertised it in an Arizona specific Newspaper   B. The Shea location honored the advertised special"}
{"text":"Is it better than your average fast food place? Yes. Is it the best BBQ ever? No way!   But Dickeys food is decent. Food is cheap Ribs and pulled pork are good, rolls and okra- darn good.   Went in the other day because I didn't want to cook, and after watching \"Super Size Me'\" about a month ago, I stay away from the obvious \"fast food\" restaurants completely. So, craving some red meat I went to Dickeys for take out because it was close and I figured their food wouldn't be as processed as McD's- seriously that movie gave me nightmares.   The staff was super friendly, the football game was on TV., the food was done quickly- giving me enough time to make myself a root beer float and watch AZ lose in OT- :(   For 3 of us I ordered the ribs, the turkey, coleslaw, mac and cheese, fried okra, potato casserole, and 2 rolls.   When I got home I was disappointed to see that the turkey looked like processed poo on a plate. Really guys- picture slimy poo on a plate-it was that gross! I refused to taste it, and everyone else was brave enough to at least try it, only to decide they couldn't eat more than 1 bite- but the dog thought it was delicious.   Never tried the potato casserole because Dickeys forgot to pack it. The mac and cheese was gross! I'm not a salt person, but it definitely needed salt and pepper to give it flavor and the macaroni was over cooked to that gross slimy noodle consistency.   So, the 3 of us shared 4 ribs, okra, and an individual size coleslaw with 2 rolls- one person was hungry enough to go ahead and eat the mac and cheese even though he didn't like it.   Dickeys would have gotten 1 star but the ribs and okra were pretty darn good and I made one hell of a root beer float while I was there.   I may be seen in Dickeys again because I have a fondness for fried okra and I have tried their pulled pork Sandwiches before and liked it. But I will definitely check my takeout before I leave to make sure it is all there and I will never order the mac and cheese or processed turkey poo again."}
{"text":"As I start my new quest to find great B.B.Q I thought I would give Dickey's a shot. The reviews were favorable so I went for it. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was there was no B.B.Q smell usually you smell smoke, the sauce or something. I ordered the full rack, the guy turned to a warmer and grabbed a rack of wrapped ribs. Yes they were already saran wrapped. He didn't even throw them on the grill, just chopped them up and into the box they went. the ribs were so over cooked it was difficult to tell when the meat ended and the bone began. When I could find a decent rib the sauce was so bland it took away from the meat. My 2 sides were the creamy coleslaw (I think someone owes K.F.C for stealing the recipe) and the loaded potato casserole (mashed potato's with melted cheese on top).  You can't beat the prices but I would rather pay more to get flavor with my meal."}
{"text":"My boss is a big powerlifter so when he says a place is good (it may not be on the healthy side but more the meatlover side) IT'S GOOD.  I went in here after a long hike one time with a group of coworkers and absolutely pigged out.  Service is FAST here because they already have the various meats cooked. Even with this, the meat is very fresh.   The only thing I'd ever ordered from here is the westerner because it is a roll and you can choose two different meats. I usually get the westerner with a beef brisket and pulled pork. Cheese, pickles and onions are also what they include in this but are optional. My favorite side items are carb loaded though with my usual mac and cheese or garlic mashed potatoes (with chives and cheese).   They have a wealth of condiments such as 3 flavors of barbeque sauce: spicy, sweet and their special combination sauce which I love the most.  Also, they do have weekly specials from Monday-Friday.  Love how these guys cater as well.  Free vanilla ice cream on your way out at the exit is the bonus!  I am a regular at this place and recommend it to any of my friends who love meat."}
{"text":"This place was OK, I gave them 3 stars because the service was a little slow and the food was luke warm.  Other than that, FREE ICE CREAM!"}
{"text":"Poor customer service. Stingy with BBQ sauce...when I had a big order and asked for extra he said I added a big one like I'm not supposed to need more. Extremely disappointed. The brisket is rubbery and not lean like I asked. Cherry on top of this mess - missing bread. No excuse, it was the slowest time we were the only ones there ordering to go. Midwood smokehouse from now on!"}
{"text":"My husband and I got a Groupon for Dickey's Barbecue. We had never been there. We really enjoyed the experience. The meats were very juicy tender and delicious. We had the beef brisket sliced pulled pork and Polish kielbasa we also had sides of beans coleslaw and potato salad. We really enjoyed everything. We will definitely go back. They gave you a lot to eat."}
{"text":"I don't live far from Dickey's BBQ so I decided to give it a try since I love bbq food and wanted to try something new.   Overall the flavor was really good but my chicken wasn't very hot and the portions were very small for the price. If they up'd the portions, I would go here again. The bbq sauce was amazing but just not worth the price."}
{"text":"I would probably rate this food closer to a 3 1/2. I stopped here for dinner the other night. I did the drive through as it was bad weather and I just wanted to go back to the hotel. I must mention that the service was quick and polite. This was my first time to any Dickey's location.  I ordered the 1/2 pound beef brisket, loaded mashed potato's and just had to try the giant loaded baked potato. The brisket was good but not great in my book. Nothing wrong with it as it has the good bbq flavor but as the same for this and pizza and pasta sauce it is a matter of taste. The loaded mashers were pretty good. The loaded giant bakers was great! They have 3 different kinds based on toppings. I chose the classic loaded style with butter, sour cream, cheese, bacon, chives and pulled chicken. This thing is a meal in itself. So if you are in the mood for food like this Dickey's s a decent option."}
{"text":"The service was kind of bad - there was just 3 workers for the entire restaurant, So the person taking your order and money was also serving your food. There was one cook and one busboy. The food was room temperature.  We just can't go back."}
{"text":"This place was good but it wasn't the most amazing BBQ I've had.  The place is homey, clean and staff are very friendly. Ordering is simple too, there's a menu on the wall or if you can't see, there's also paper menus for you to look at.  My husband got the 2 meat platter and I got the 1 meat platter that comes with 2 sides each and a roll. I would say for the price, I think mine was 11.99 or 10.99, there could have been a little bit more meat. I picked chopped brisket with a side of fried okra and green beans and my husband got pulled pork and cheddar sausage with Mac and cheese and BBQ baked beans.   The meats were nice, tender and moist with a good amount of smoked flavor but a tad bit lacking salt. There are also 3 different types of BBQ sauce that they have as well- original which is pretty good, sweet has a bit of a tang and spicy has crushed red peppers in them. I liked all 3 of the sauces!   The fried okra has a nice crunch to it as well, the way fried okra should taste! The Mac and cheese was nice and saucy and the BBQ baked beans were delicious with a bit of a vinegar twist to it. The green beans tasted a bit off to me, I couldn't put my finger on it, but it wasn't my favorite.   They are also famous for their big yellow cups as well that you can keep for a souvenir and once you're done eating, there is a free ice cream cone waiting for you as well!   This wasn't my favorite choice for BBQ but I will come back to try other items on the menu to give another opinion!"}
{"text":"Don't pass buy without stopping in. Great food great staff and Chris the manager is really cool stop by and say hello and have some grear food."}
{"text":"Just ate at Dickey's on Decatur!!! This food is horrible!!! The meat was dry and tasted a day old, can't believe this place is selling barbecue that taste like something I'll feed my dog! Never returning back , scratched off my list of restaurants period..."}
{"text":"Had the brisket sandwich and waffle fries.  Meh, nothin special, not worth visiting."}
{"text":"We were craving BBQ but were too lazy to make our way to Bobby Q. MAJOR MISTAKE.   The brisket and the ribs were adequate but the portion sizes for the meats were small. The chicken and turkey both looked and tasted processed. The side dishes were uninspired, with the mac and cheese being mushy and tasting like it came out of a box. The area around the beverages and BBQ sauces was absolutely filthy and all the cutlery had to be wiped down before we could use it.  Adding insult to injury, no one told us that there was complimentary ice cream for customers- we discovered that as we were leaving (for the first and last time I might add)!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit. I had the Ribs, baked beans, and mac&cheese. The food was good with excellent service. I would recommend if you need a BBQ fix."}
{"text":"It's good BBQ at good prices. We all need to have a place like that in the neighborhood, so this does the job. The portions are good and the meat is tasty. Sincerely, I would have been even willing to give it 4 stars, but I get half star off for service, and the other half for carelessness with salt. As soon as I informed of my coupon to one of the attendants, whom seem to be a supervisor, she started acting rough, and throwing lids and making noises. I may be absolutely wrong & she might have been just cleaning but even the other lady serving the food looked back as to see what she was doing. As a customer that is very uncomfortable. It's best to always remain kind and professional. Throw the lids and the doors when no customers around. And also, they need to be more careful with the salt. Specially the macaroni and cheese. I could feel the loads of salt. And that makes it a place i personally cannot trust. Ta-ta!"}
{"text":"Dickey's is awesome. You can smell the smokiness before you walk in.  The food is always delicious. Plenty of choices and you can eat pretty healthy as well.  The employees are very friendly and seem to like their job.  And the best part is free ice-cream!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, mediocre food at best.  The place is extremely dirty and the lunch wait is too long."}
{"text":"This review is for Dickey's catering service.  Hosting a lunch for 25 people. Quite simply it was very easy and hassle free to order and set up.   Ordered online and next day Alonzo from their corporate offices has the quote to me.  Rob from the local store on Rainbow followed up and we set the time of delivery. Needed to make a couple menu changes which was easily handled with Rob.   Delivery was on time and the food hot. All enjoyed.   Thank you Dickey's for making this event special."}
{"text":"I had to give this place a try. I love me some Texas BBQ.  Smoked Brisket is my favorite cut along with some pulled pork.  this place did not disappoint me.  They chop the brisket right in front of you.  It had a nice smoke ring and flavor.  What I also enjoyed was the sauces they have for you to serve yourself offering a HOT, Mild, and one other that I did not try.  The sides were decent, I had the mac n cheese which you can never go wrong with this and also the potato salad which tasted fresh and had good flavor.    Thomas was one of the team members there and he was friendly and greeted everyone with a smile.  These type of team members are hard to come by so make sure he stays happy.  An asset to your company.    Dickey's Offers daily specials daily which is a good way to work your way around the menu with out breaking the bank.  With vegetarians in the family it would be impossible for me to bring home the family meal so I often have to sneak away for a meat eaters delight."}
{"text":"Dickey's is a quick service bbq franchise and does a great job preparing and serving the usual bbq meats, along with three different sauces. While this location lacks fried okra and complementary ice cream, that disappointment disappeared the moment I dug into the creamed spinach and cole slaw. Didn't miss the okra, and no room for ice cream!  My wife always does pulled pork, while I stick with brisket, chopped on a sandwich. When you need a bbq fix in a hurry, Dickey's is the place."}
{"text":"Was it good? Yes it was. Way overpriced for what you get. Got q in the area gives you twice the meat for 1/2 the price and is just as good. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Ok came for lunch coke machine didn't work no ice. the cashier that looks like Herman the monster was very rude wears glasses didn't give a fuck about his customers didn't have a sign on the ice cream machine saying it's not working overall won't be here again I wonder why this place was empty for lunch"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this spot ... came back after a couple months with the craving for some BBQ.. what in the heck ??? All The sides items are a total different recipe , as if they are trying to cut cost YUCK  potato salad was my favorite and now tastes like straight shit. Tried the BBQ beans and those are worse .. the bread was harder than a rock as if it was old!! I will not b coming back to this location !"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious and you really can't go wrong with what you get. Pulled pork, brisket, chicken, turkey is all smoked and never left under any heat lamps. There are three types of barbecue to try; original, spicy, and sweet. All are great tasting and go with anything you get.   All of your favorite southern sides are there and the fried okra is a must along with your southern sweet tea."}
{"text":"The barbecue meat did have a good flavor. I will give this another try and hopefully the meet will be a lot hotter it was very room temperature. Potato salad a little dry."}
{"text":"We were starving and it was the only reasonably priced place open at 9:30pm in Northern Scottsdale.  The brisket was edible and the sides were mediocre."}
{"text":"We used to love Dickeys and would go all the time but then they started making changes to the ordering process. Every time we go there now they forget part of our order. I normally wouldn't leave a review, but tonight we got our order to go and I get home and there's a short black hair in my mac n cheese. I won't be spending money there anymore honestly."}
{"text":"Worst bbq in the valley, seriously over priced and under portion... Severely disappointed and would choose anywhere else especially for the price."}
{"text":"Food was very good. Confusing needing to tell one guy what meet you want another the sides then they bring it together and you ring out  Awsome taste and a little pricey for fast food but not cheap meat with filler. Fries, onion rings and pulled pork sandwich where great."}
{"text":"A little pricey for BBQ but worth it!  The all you can eat ice cream is a great finish to your meal.  It's definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Food is awesome. The meat is always cooked perfectly. The employees are really nice and their service is exceptional."}
{"text":"One word: WOW. I ordered the quarter plate with pulled pork, jalapeno beans, and mac and cheese. The meat was phenomenal! Smoky and delicious, and I love that they serve the meats without sauce. Great menu, prices, portions. I will be back!"}
{"text":"My friend and I were on our way to the infamous Studio B Buffet at the M Resort when we realized that we only had an hour to eat. I had a plane to catch at 3pm today and I was debating if I should miss my flight so I can enjoy my meal at Studio B. Alas, we knew it was impossible. In the end, we came upon a strip mall and decided to eat fast food. It was a choice between Dickey's and Buffalo Wild Wings. Instantaneously, we chose Dickey's, only because we just had Buffalo Wild Wings recently.  Walking into Dicky's, we realized that we probably picked the right choice because it was super packed!  This was another casual restaurant. The first thing I did was get in line. While in line, I checked out the big blown out menu. There were a lot to choose from.  I ended up with the Big BBQ Sandwich combo with 2 sides ($7).   Now, my order didn't end there. I now gotta order the type of meat. There were a lot of meats to choose from and I ended up with the beef brisket. As for the sides, I added waffle fries and fried onions. I also added a side of fried okra to my order. The total bill came out to be $9.19 ($1.50 for the third side, plus tax).  The condiments were at the self serve station. At the station, you can get unlimited dill pickles and BBQ sauces. There were 3 kinds of sauces:  1. Dicky's special sauce 2. Sweet BBQ sauce 3. Spicy BBQ sauce  Overall, the sauces pretty much taste the same. The only difference was the flavor of the sauce being more bold, spicy, or sweet.  The brisket itself was ok. It was lacking flavor and it wasn't tender. The sides definitely made up for this.   Overall my experience here was ok. I came to the conclusion that the reason why this place was packed was because the patrons were just like me: we couldn't make it in time for the buffet at M Resort!  Tip: The Big BBQ Sandwich itself costs $5, BUT on Mondays, it is only $1 !!!!"}
{"text":"Not too many BBQ places in Las Vegas to rave about, but this place is at least worth reviewing. Dickey's smoked meat is delicious. I had the half-rack of ribs on this visit and they were finger-licking-good. Can't wait to try the chicken and brisket next time I visit. I only gave Dickey's 3 stars because I felt the prices were a bit high. I had the half-rack of ribs (with no sides) and my friend had the 2-item-meal with a large drink and it came out to $28 bucks. Way too pricey for lunch for two. I do recommend it and I will visit again soon."}
{"text":"This place is legit. A native Kansas Citian is telling you this, so trust me!  I moved to Wisconsin in 2009, and needless to say, it's difficult to find Kansas City-style barbeque around here. I only know of one restaurant that touts itself as \"KC-style,\" located in Waunakee, but it falls short on several levels.  Dickey's is a fast-casual, quick-eat sort of place, and it surprisingly serves tasty KC-style BBQ! The smoked turkey is just wonderful. I also really enjoy all of the side dishes and like the mac & cheese the most. Beware of the green beans, though: they are a very salty side dish.   At Dickey's, you also get free ice cream. That's just 5 stars by itself.  You're not going to find KC Gates/Zardas-quality BBQ at Dickey's, but you'll get pretty close."}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever encountered....no eye contact, no smile...wouldn't even respond back when I spoke. Laughed and reprimanded me for not calling the order in. These guys were complete dicks. Never again."}
{"text":"Best Dickey's in Vegas! We're regulars and have tried nearly everything on the menu. While the ribs and sausage are my favorite, everything is delicious - especially the cole slaw! Their catering is easy and reliable and the owner is super friendly. If you want tasty BBQ, you'll definitely find it here.."}
{"text":"Disappointed that they don't have what other Dickey's places have, and no ice cream machine!  Food is good, tender beef brisket. Sides are overpriced. Creamed spinach very good, but again, priced more for a sit-down restaurant. Not overly friendly or efficient staff when we first got there, better later. Decor is very cute and modern."}
{"text":"Fast food BBQ done right. Decent portions served hot. Tried the pulled pork and the brisket. Better than Tom's BBQ. Sides were generic but tasted ok. Sauce is everything and it was pretty tasty. I would return. Only thing I wasn't fond of was the biscuit roll. Cornbread would have been better...clean restaurant. 4 stars for a fast casual restaurant."}
{"text":"I give the place 4 stars as maybe I don't know what a five BBQ place taste like. but I see Dickey's been around since '41. so it must have many liking it  Funny that I have never heard of the place but then why not as they are new to Az. I haven't seen any ads for the place or places. We came to the store for lunch and I had the brisket with potato salad. I enjoyed the sandwich because it wasn't loaded with sauce as we put what sauce we desire on it after the meat was cut and served. 3 sauces, original, spicy, and sweet. i like the original sauce. The potato salad was better than store bought but my wife makes better than either of those salads.  I look forward to returning again for another brisket. ."}
{"text":"Update: since them opening a few weeks ago, I have been here at least 7 times. I love the food however they really need to better train their staff.   First- The guy at the meat station yelling the order to the assembly line (which is unnecessary because the assembly line staff have to ask at least two more times what you ordered). Not only is the meat guy yelling unnecessary, but it also creates an uncomfortable dining experience.   Second- they are always out of product. I understand they may be out of meats because they only cook so much and they are still tying to get a gauge on the business levels, but running out of sides/ sauce seems a little like bad planning. The last 5 out of 7 times I have been there they have been out of something. That's a little frustrating.   Third- they need better training. It's a very simple operation but I feel bad management is causing the staff to fail. The staff are trying but they look very confused by the whole operation.   I don't know if this is why the other locations like Norterra didn't last, but I hope they figure something out before they go out of business too."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at this location, customer service was solid and everything we ordered came out quick and tasted great. The ribs, pulled pork, and brisket we're the standouts.Good selection of BBQ sauces. I liked the lemonade and sweet tea. I thought the soft serve ice cream was tasty, if you combine the cookies with this I have a great desert to finish your meal."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. With every dish, I fall even more in love with this place. I really enjoy the ribs, obviously (duh), but the chicken and the turkey are just absolutely amazing. The baked potato casserole is genius! They have have military, cop, firefighter discounts. They do catering orders and deliver those.   Want desert? No worries, they have soft serve ice cream, brownies, cookies, and pecan pie. I love to take the ice cream and put it in my root beer for a root beer float!   The staff is always professional and friendly. Josh is the manager who runs the location. He is always there, smiling and helping everyone and just seems to always be on top of everything. Simone and Sarah are awesome.   I met the owners of the three locations in the area on the soft opening for friends and family night, they were not what I expected. They were so nice and genuine. I've known many chain store managers and have never really liked them much. They all seem to have a \"God-complex\", just so conceited and bragging about their success. These owners were completely different, they wore the same uniforms as their employees and were very humble. I enjoyed the short conversation I had with them. Even so, I could tell they were so different from my former managers of Massage Envy and other chains. I would recommend this place for ordering food AND for anyone looking for employment. They don't really seem to have teenagers, contrary to the previous review, but yes, they do have young people here and would hire anyone 16 and over.  I just love this place and always look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I went there for lunch and luckily got there early; Dickey's is definitely a popular place for lunch.  When my vendor and I left the place was packed.  When I stepped up to the counter to order, I must have looked dazed (by all the good choices lol) that the cashier asked if I had ever eaten there before.  Once I said \"No\" he explained the whole menu.  I ended up ordering the 2 meat plate and it comes with 2 sides.  My meat choices were the pulled pork and the chicken breast, my 2 sides were the creamy cole slaw, and the waffle fries.  There is one size, plastic, drink cup (yay souvenir) and free ice cream.  Also, you get to choose what bbq sauce (out of 3-Dickey's original, hot n spicey, and sweet) and how much since its next to the soda machine.  My vendors food was at our table even before she sat down with her drink! Now that's service :)  The chicken breast was AMAZING.  Warm and moist, could be cut with a plastic knife.  It had flavor, so even if I wasn't a sauce fan, the chicken would have been good on its own.  The same goes for the pulled pork.  Now, the only reason I didn't give a 5th star is because my pulled pork wasn't warm, it wasn't cold, but it should have been heated up before it was served to me.  However, even with that issue the pulled pork was delicious!  I was too full to partake in the free ice cream, but I'm sure I'll be visiting Dickey's again.  *Side note* The staff isn't half bad to look at either"}
{"text":"When we walked in the staff was so nice and pleasant toward us. It was our first time there and he suggested we try the rib plate, which to me was delicious. Will be back as soon as I return to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Second time I go to this place  First time I was sure they just had a bad day but I guess not  The portion are TOO small  The price is very high  The taste is ok but not more then that  They are offering you ice cream for free and it's a weird powder that taste bad  The side dish's are ok and taste good  The stuff is nice  I would say it's more fast food place then a restaurant  Go try but no guarantees"}
{"text":"I received a free classic sandwich with order of a side. I picked waffle fries, which were good but my sandwich was terrible. The chicken had a smokey taste with a sponge-like texture and was super dry, even with tons of the BBQ sauce. The thick slices of chicken on sandwich highlighted that more for me sadly, I couldn't finish it. The Coca-Cola freestyle machine was nice and the whole shop had a nice clean vibe about it. The staff definitely could use work more work interacting with people and explaining the process to newcommers. The guy slicing meat was short with me and didn't even offer me cheese to add, finding out right before cashing out that's an option. Now to be fair it does say it on the menu but as someone new I just missed it. This was my experience at the Cactus Dickies, and I can't stress enough that this is my personal experience and it might be completely different for someone else. Thank you"}
{"text":"We finally stopped in and boy was it a treat!!! Kids eat FREE on Sunday's plus they had a two meat and two sides special with a roll for $11 which came out to $22 for the wife and I. Grand total with drinks only $29 next time will be cheaper because we got the refillable cups. Their ICE Tea is really good plus there is free ice cream. Remember, the specials at least for kids are valid for Sunday's only. Good barbeque at a fair price. It's a winner and we found our new favorite spot."}
{"text":"If I could give a big ZERO, I would. Last night my husband and I visited because we were craving BBQ. Usually we make the 30 minute drive to Chandler to go to Rudy's BBQ which is from Texas, but last night we were too tired. I ordered the brisket. It was grey and absolutely dry. The spicy beans were cold and the food plainly... sucked. My husband ordered their chicken sandwich. It was nothing special. A couple chopped up chicken pieces and bbq sauce. Totally disappointing!! I can not understand how this place stays in business, If you want GREAT BBQ, go to Rudys!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try tonight since I've been wanting some bbq. Honestly not worth the price. I got the pork rib plate which came with two sides and a drink. The sides were SO small, tiny actually. I got the Mac n cheese and coleslaw. They didn't even completely fill the containers. The ribs were alright, Texas Roadhouse is so much better. The ribs here are salty. We also got the brisket sandwich. Also very small. For all that we paid $30. Not worth the price whatsoever. I wouldn't be so disappointed if the side portions were bigger or if they're that small, lower the price. It's not even a sit down, server restaurant. The coleslaw was delicious though so I'll give it that."}
{"text":"We've been here a few times, it's never crowded but a steady busy. I'm stuck on the baked potato and it's big enough as a meal.   My husband likes the chicken - is not dry. He had the sausage, chicken and brisket plate, which he like - the portion size was ok. He's a big eater. He agrees that the baked potato is a meal"}
{"text":"I went to the new one at Tatum and cactus it was really good. Good service and I got the pulled pork. I would come back again"}
{"text":"So I ordered from Dickey's through Grubhub.  I ordered a side of baked potato casserole to go with my sandwich.  I ended up getting potato salad.  Not what I wanted.  I called Dickey's and the manager \"Josh\" was called to the phone.  First off, he was sarcastic and said , with a laugh, he would \"fire\" whoever gave me potato salad, trivializing the mistake..  like I shouldn't even have called..  Next, he blamed everybody but the person who assembled the order..  blamed the Grubhub driver , says they are supposed to check the order before they deliver it.  I asked him how the Grubhub driver was supposed to know that the container was full of potato salad vs the casserole when the containers aren't marked?  He blamed the driver again.  Then he told me I could come and get the casserole myself if I wanted to.  My question was, why would I  order and pay for delivery, if I wanted to leave the house and go get food?  Didn't that defeat the whole purpose?  He, again, blamed the driver.  To top it all off, I ordered root beer to drink, and had the driver call me to tell me they didn't have root beer so, I had to take sprite.  So, the driver was being conscientious.. and he did look..  Finally, after about five or ten minutes on the phone with \"Josh\" he agree to refund the $$ for the potato salad side on the \"tablet\" but, as of yet, I haven't seen it.  Won't order again.  My issue here is with both the restaurant and Grubhub.  My order accuracy with Grubhub is sitting right at about 25-30%.  The restaurants aren't looking at the orders, and nobody seems to care to check the orders.  I guess the message here, today at least, is that they just don't care.  Whatever happened to customer service?"}
{"text":"I've never had turkey this moist and delicious! Everytime we visit the employees are always friendly. The price is a bit higher, but the quality is great. The ice cream (custard?) always hits the spot after eating some bomb-arse brisket!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but staff is totally clueless I asked if they were St. Louis or baby backs and the chef didn't even know what kind of ribs they sell he could only tell me they were pork ribs. Train your staff dickies......"}
{"text":"I must say what a major disappointment. BBQ sounded good and thought we would try it since we are new to the area. Thought it was a bit pricey though. Tried the pork ribs and they were over cooked and must have been sitting out because they were cold. Also the brisket was even colder and if I had a dog I am not so sure I would have taken it home to him. Must say the fries were pretty good. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"We stood at the counter and it took 4 minutes for anyone to even address our presence. Three people milling around and not even a \"hello\" or a \"be right with you\" from any of them. The guy who takes the order and serves the meat was very curt and gave off an air that the mere presence of customers pains him immensely. Maybe that's why we were served two globs of fat masquerading as pulled pork. The whole place is depressing. Seriously, I've never observed an entire staff behave as though they're trapped in the fifth circle of hell. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"For the price, you get a great meal at Dickey's BBQ especially if you go on a \"specials\" day. I usually go in on Ribs Tuesdays and it's a hit or miss when it comes to the quality of the ribs. Still worth the price. Sometimes the ribs are hot, sometimes cold. However, the meat always falls off the bone and I can get into the marrow.  For $10 3 ribs, 2 sides, a biscuit, and a large drink in a big #yellow cup is a great price for the convenience, that is if you don't want to pay a little bit more and wait longer for ribs from Ellis Island. The staff is usually pleasant and the restaurant is clean.   I especially enjoy the free ice cream cone, and the fancy plastic dinnerware!  The barbecue sauce is decent. I've done a taste test and there is a mild difference between each of the sauces. You can taste a little bit of a kick in the hot barbecue sauce vs more brown sugar in the sweet sauce.  The reason for my 4-star rating is sometimes the ribs are a hit or miss. They aren't the best ribs I've ever had, but they aren't the worst. The fried okra isn't the best, I usually prefer the baked potato salad for my side.  REASONS TO VISIT DICKEY'S BBQ: 1. Great Daily Meal Specials  2. Ample Parking 3. Clean Restaurant 4. Plenty of Seating 5. Lots of Side Options 6. Family Appeal 7. Friendly Staff"}
{"text":"The food was great.  However I chose Dickies because of a Restaurant.Com gift certificate and the meal packages.  However when I called to place the order,  the prices and selections available were not the same."}
{"text":"Wow the meat is so tender and  juicy. Very clean  great customer service. The price is right. The spicy  sauce its awesome. We need one of these in Seal Beach,CA ASAP I had the 3 meats plate ...yummy"}
{"text":"I lived in Dallas, TX back in 2003.  The one thing I discovered there was Dickey's Barbecue.  I used to live about a mile from the original Dickey's and I love that their sides are buffet style.  The food at this location is always consistently good.  I moved back to Las Vegas and was so excited to see that Dickey's was coming to Vegas.  I now live in Phoenix and I was so happy to see that Dickey's has multiple locations in the East Valley (Mesa, Gilbert and soon Queen Creek).  I can honestly eat Dickey's 2-3x a week and be happy.  Their meats are great.  The only negative is I wish their sides had a few more options (they have many options, but I would love collard greens, squash or even carrots).  If you want good BBQ hit up Dickey's.  You will love it."}
{"text":"This place is great!!!! Service was great!! I'm not sure why they only have 3 stars... I looked at those other reviews an am perplexed??? Anyways daily special are a some with 2 sides and a large cup you can keep! Free ice cream is unheard of!!!! Wow!!! I will be a regular from here on out!!!"}
{"text":"Okay third time was not the charm. First time we tried this place brisket was great and ribs where so-so.  Second time we did a big to go and found items missing but we drive today to go back.    Okay so went there a few days ago and that will be the last time we do. How the hell at 6:30 PM at night do you run out of ham, turkey, brisket, and some of the sides? REALLY!  Totally wrong and that was only after standing there for over 10 minutes waiting to get an order in.   Walked out.  I'm done with this place"}
{"text":"Getting greeted upon entry is always a good thing. I came in and slammed them with a large order and they didn't blink an eye. The manager hooked me up with recommendations which I always like. The ice cream machine was rocking tonight as the place was full of kiddos. But I got my share and I must admit it was really decent soft serve. Especially to be free :). The place is kept clean and the aroma alone catches you at the door.  The ribs were solid, links had a nice bite, and the fried okra complimented the other sides well. If I'm ever in a pinch and need last minute catering again I would hit them up for another round. They were an easy three stars but the quick service when I was in a bind got them the extra boost to 4 stars."}
{"text":"I came here with my family to have some classic BBQ.  I had purchased a Google Offer and wanted to experience and savor some true Southern cuisine.  Not a chance.  I placed the order for everybody and whipped out my phone.  The cashier refused to take my coupon.  He insisted that it be printed, not scanned from the phone.  I told him that the number on the phone will link me with the coupon and we can all be happy.  He called his manager and I got the same story.  Finally, the let me talk to the owner, he gave me the same story.  Meanwhile, at noon on a Saturday the staffing consisted of one person taking drive in orders AND walk in orders.  I have absolutely no idea what the manager and owner do (except reject coupons from customers).  The line was through the door and people were leaving because of it.  I did not try the food, but looking at the other ratings, may it was an omen that we ended up having a great meal across the street at Butterfield's.    How this place survives???? I cannot answer that one.  Avoid -"}
{"text":"We just had our 3d order of ribs and it was just as disappointing as the first two.  I guess we're finished.  The meat falls off the bone but is dry and chewy.  The skin is blackened to the point that it is like chewing on wood.  I've had BBQ in Texas and this falls way short."}
{"text":"We ended up going back and found that all the \"negative\" areas had been fixed.  The service was faster and they had beef!  Seems to be headed in the right direction.  I highly recommend the Jalapeno beans!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Dicky's. The place was relatively small which gave the impression that it was built for Take Out orders. In fact I drove past the place because of the small sign and business location.  The staff was friendly: The jalepeno beans which I have never had, were spicy and tasty; My order included  four ribs and they too were tasty.  Unfortunately, the overall impression of the food was that it was just..........OK?"}
{"text":"The food here was decent, but not great. The wait was so long people were just walking out after waiting 15+ minutes just to order. We waited 20 minutes to order & were even at the front of the line the entire time, while Tommy, one of the most rude & condescending employees I've ever encountered never even acknowledged our presence. My food was cold before the fries even came out. We were pretty disappointed as we'd had high hopes for a BBQ place!  The only two redeeming qualities were the ambiance due to the fun themed decor & the free self-serve ice cream."}
{"text":"It's not what I expected. Food was cold, beans were watery, the rolls were like Olive Garden for Italian food. Pickles were ok. Meat lack seasoning and flavor. The food for the price we paid for was in small portions, I was expecting more food for the money we spent."}
{"text":"I am almost embarrassed to say that our kitchen cabinets hold a large set of big yellow cups.  They are the perfect size!  We usually end up here on Sundays.  What makes Sunday so special you ask?  Well, kids eat for free on Sundays.  Dickey's has daily specials.  I really like this place a lot.  It's a simple bar b que place.  I don't have to deal with overpriced meat and rude waiters.  You go in and order various smoked meats.  The sides are great too.  I love their loaded bake potato casserole.  The green beans are great too.  I f we have guests in town we take them her most of the time.  When you are done with your meal enjoy some free ice cream too.  If you are in the area you have to stop in and try Dickey's out.  Make sure to get your big yellow cup because it will end up in you kitchen cabinet!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Used to eat at Dickey's at the Dallas Airport in between flights. Very pleased to see the location in South Chandler. Stopped by with my sister for lunch. Nice clean place and very friendly staff. We both had pulled pork sandwiches, coleslaw and sodas. The service was fast and efficient and the barbecue was predictably very tasty. Great to have a new Dickey's in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I don't know why this place got such mediocre reviews?! I eat a lot of BBQ and have eaten it pretty much everywhere in the valley. I came here and got the usual pulled pork sandwich and potato salad. It was cheap...quite a bit cheaper than Scottsdale BBQ and a lot tastier. There is a Drive-thru here which I actually find awesome, so I can get quick BBQ lunches on the go...but it's still a sit down restaurant too. I've been here multiple times and always leave satisfied!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ, the chicken, pork and sausage was much better than the ribs.  The ribs were very fatty but hopefully that was a one off so we'll try them again and hopefully have a better batch."}
{"text":"Thought we would try the BBQ place closer to us so we ordered food from the Surprise location. When my husband got home we realized the 4 rolls that came with the family pack were shorted to him . The smoked chicken was dry and the marinade was not a good flavor , green beans they  were over peppered-the only thing that was good was their mashed potatoes. very disappointed-you get small amount of food for the price you pay, and the quality is definitely not there. What a huge disappointment. It was 30 dollars for this food and the only thing that was good was the potatoes.  Won't ever be back."}
{"text":"Love that fact that you are greeted by an upbeat, smiling employee as soon as you walk in the door! He seems to always be there and is super friendly and genuinely courteous, you don't see that very often these days! Of course the BBQ is delicious too, top it all off with free ice cream and you go yourself and winning combination!"}
{"text":"To Paul S...they have a full variety of sauces  to bring home.  It's not up to the store to put the sauces in your bag for you.  Perhaps you wanted them to feed you your dinner too?  Restaurants are effected by poor reviews and they should not get your negative review based of your own incompetence."}
{"text":"First time at Dickey's. We ordered online and picked it up to eat at home. We arrived a couple minutes early so we had to wait, but that was expected. The food was very good. We have been looking for a good BBQ place since we left Alabama and this is the best so far.  The whole family had ribs, a couple of us had pulled pork and I had sliced beef brisket. It was all cooked perfectly tender and the flavor was good. The sides were good, nothing to be too excited about. Mac and cheese, fried okra and waffle fries.  Overall I gave this 4 stars because the food was so good. The price was fair.   We will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"So this is an order at the counter and go to you seat kind of place.  The BBQ is pretty good for a chain.  The sauces had nice flavor.  The pricing was good.  The customer service I experienced and witnessed was really good.  I would go back for a meal, but I would not call this my \"go to\" BBQ."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place when it came to my neighborhood but was disappointed. It was not worth what I paid. I had a long wait while the employees behind the counter chatted amongst themselves. Then when my children and I finally got our dinners the were warm at best the ribs were dry and overall disappointing. There are definitely better places within a couple miles."}
{"text":"The food is awesome the help from the owner with a luncheon for 100 people  I would give them 10 stars !!  Thanks to Jason we will always be grateful"}
{"text":"The staff is so polite  funny and they make a genuine connection with the customer. I absolutely love this place! I am from Houston and we are home of the barbque....This"}
{"text":"Not bad but not \"good\".. thanks to Daren I took his freebies and used them before the movies last night .  My husband and daughter ate at Dickeys with me and the consensus is it's just meh.  The food tasted okay but nothing outstanding in taste. The brisket and chicken had little flavor other than cooked, no smoking , the bbq taste  only came from the sauce which you could choose spicy or sweet.   The bread was good for the sandwich tasted like they trucked it in fresh, the roll served with the 2 meat plate tasted biscuit like and was tastier but looked like a roll.  My coleslaw was very bland and just tasted like wet cabbage.  My daughter  liked the macaroni and cheese , but only cause it tasted like velvetta, ew.    Would I go here again ? Maybe , if I wanted plain meat and a side of cabbage."}
{"text":"My oldest son is a typical 18 year old, in that he can and will eat pretty much anything. Fortunately, he has a sense of adventure and, like his father, enjoys dining at new places. Spoiler Alert: Dickey's Barbecue Pit isn't new! I've heard the Dickey's name before. I've seen the big yellow cups. But I had no idea the chain has been around since 1941!  Anyone who knows BBQ, knows there are regional variations. Dickey's specializes in Texas style barbecue. And their menu features several other options besides just beef. I was thinking \"pulled pork\" as my son and I walked up to the building. Apparently, so were a lot of other people. The first person we spoke to at the carving station informed us that they were out of pulled pork. I won't hold that against them. It just means I'm more anxious to try it!  We each chose an entree featuring the beef brisket. My son got the Beef and Cheese sandwich with a side of barbecue beans. I chose the Mac and Beef, which is a bed of creamy Mac 'n' Cheese topped with beef brisket, and added a side of slaw. The beef brisket portion was generous, tender and had some wonderful flavor all by itself. The only reason I deducted one star is because the Mac 'n' Cheese was just warm. It was still delicious, just not piping hot.   My son loved his sandwich and the beans. I had to sample them and I agreed. But the best part of the meal was discovering my new favorite BBQ sauce. Dickey's original BBQ sauce is the bomb! The sauce, the menu options we didn't get to try, the quality of the meat and the reasonable prices are all reasons why we will be back soon."}
{"text":"They changed the buns. The sliders are now just meh. I would say Dickey's is now a 2 1/2 star place and will probably only be visited once a month instead of once a week."}
{"text":"Great food!!! Nothing like fresh barbecue on a hot Saturday great job guys and special thanks to CODY we will definitely be coming back for more very juicy tender meat I got chicken and ribs combo I must say that I'm very happy"}
{"text":"Fried onion rings on my salad??? These people know how to make this girl happy! This is my 1st visit to a Dickie's, it looks like it's right out of OKC. Instead of our traditional salsa bar they have a \"sauce bar\" complete with 4 flavors and an ICE CREAM MACHINE!  Yes, I ordered the Smokehouse Salad in a BBQ place. They were kind enough to substitute chicken for brisket and it was all white moist breast meat on fresh crisp romaine.  Very nice. Came with a delicious, albeit unhealthy white roll slathered in butter.   I'd come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent pulled pork and the sausage jalape√±o kielbasa was delicious! I had the sandwich combo with mac and cheese and green beans - also great. Highly recommend if you are in the mood for a good BBQ lunch or dinner. The staff was great also!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. My choices have ranged from BBQ Brisket salad to a full on meal. It is aways good, but not amazing.  Dickey's is a rock solid 3 stars, perfect for a quick bite served with a smile."}
{"text":"Changed the hours on me. Wouldn't have been so painful if he hadn't locked the door in my face at 6:02. CONSISTENCY is key."}
{"text":"Regular good Dickey's food and decore.   Employees are not yet fully trained so expect a rough experience."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite fast stop barbecue place, the brisket is my first pick  over there, the cream spinach and potato salads are always fresh, service is prompt and they have a positive vibe, this place is well maintained, clean bathrooms and dining area, it is a little over price but it is worth it."}
{"text":"It says a lot about a company and its employees when they go above and beyond to correct a mistake. I had a party I had ordered for a week in advance and, even after calling and confirming the order one more time the very morning of the party, when I got home they had not given me my full order. I'll admit completely that I was not the best person to deal with on the phone when I called to register a complaint. I had ordered 1 1/2 pounds of sausage, pulled pork, and sliced brisket, but had received only 1/2 orders of each, and this was supposed to be feeding eight people so I was very upset considering my party was due to start in fifteen minutes from when I got home with the food. Now, if they had denied any wrong doing, or hadn't done anything to fix it this would be a completely different review. Considering it would have taken fifteen minutes alone to drive back to the place to get the order corrected, Dickey's instead drove over the rest of my order in record time. That's what makes a great company. You guys made a mistake and went above and beyond to fix and you handled my anger over the phone extremely well. I'm so sorry about my tone over the phone; I know that kind of customer is never easy to deal with. Thank you so very much for making my party go off without a hitch in the end, and the food was absolutely delicious and perfect when I got it all! I will still recommend Dickey's to anyone looking for some good BBQ, because it really is wonderful."}
{"text":"The food is delicious I got the three meat special with the brisket the pulled pork and the Kabasa sausage topped off with a Caesar salad and baked potato casserole it was is delicious. Just like being out at a restaurant only right from your home you get to eat it"}
{"text":"I preordered a Party Pack one week prior for a surprise Birthday Party for my husband, it happened to fall on Mothers Day. The food was delivered at the specified time, accurate, hot and delicious! There was plenty of food and everyone was more than satisfied! My only \"problem\" would be it would be nice if I were able to choose my own 3 sides, however, other than that, my hubby was surprised and all guest were well fed. I will be going back for sure! Thank you to all staff involved!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: BACK OPEN! As of June 7, 2018 this location is back open for business. Apparently another Dickey's franchisee took over. Thank you. We have already been there again to pig out. Pun intended. Old review: Closed! We went to eat here on Friday and there's a sign on the door. That really bums me out because I preferred their BBQ to other joints in the area. And I'm not spending 30 minutes or more driving to and from another location, especially for lunch. Hasta la vista big yellow cup!"}
{"text":"I've had this chain restaurant several times in various states and this one is by far the worst. They've taken so many things off the menu that I could even recognize it. Maybe I am a harsh critic because I'm from Texas and the barbecue there just seems to have a bit more flavor and smoke. Because this generic version of a barbecue stand is as basic as the tacos at jack n the box. I'll pass. I'm sure there's better places in Phoenix I just haven't found them yet."}
{"text":"Don't order the Mac and cheese!!! I had to start there. It was mushy flavorless and pasty!!  Not sure if that's how you want your dinner described but I don't. We ordered the stack and it was like eating Elmer's with brisket.   Well why did I give it 2 stars?  Because the other meat combo plate was great. But The baked potato with sausage was so good I wanted to eat the box.  And as soon as I ate it I went in to the combo to finish my ribs. But once I looked in the box and realized the staff forgot the pickle and onion!  This is not only a Dickies staple. But a Texas must with BBQ.  I was extremely disappointed that I almost drove back across town to ask for it.   Overall good food (-Mac). Friendly but forgetful staff! Quick Texas BBQ when in a bind. - put it this way. I didn't use the sauce because it didn't need it."}
{"text":"Some would say if your from Texas and you've been to Lockhart, TX or Austin then this isn't real BBQ & you could even be shot for eating at such a place like Dickey's and i'd agree to a point, but  lets face it we live in AZ were BBQ joints aren't really a  on every street corner and we don't have pitmasters being born every second of every day! Sure i'd love to drive to one of the great local bbq joints here in the Valley but thats really not a option during a 1hr work lunch! So with that said i wouldn't go out of way to eat here but its within walking distance of Mill Ave and Arizona State University so its close and beats a cold sandwich w chips, again some in Texas might disagree... Adds a little variety to your typically fast food joints around the Tempe area. Lunch specials during the week are reasonable priced and the staff is very friendly and can help you pick something out on the menu that you might like if your not familiar w BBQ. I wouldn't say they have NO options for people who don't like meat but if you know one of these non-meat eaters i certainly wouldnt recommend taking them here. I'd personally recommend the large potato w brisket or the brisket salad both were ok, sides i've tried are fried okra and potato salad. again nothing to jump up and down about but was ok and filled my need for lunch. They have 3 types of sauces you can help yourself to, sweet, hot, mild (reg). They have free soft serve ice cream which i like to use to make a root beer float and you can pick up a yellow cup for a $1 refill next time your in. I'd give you 3 stars but afraid for my life when i return to Texas....."}
{"text":"I think I have also been here two times. It was really good. I think I got some mac n cheese and it was bomb! I remember having bread and maybe pulled pork. I think that's the meat I got. But all around it was amazing! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate at Dickey's late Saturday afternoon.  We were a little surprised it was a fast food place but overall we were satisfied when we left.  The staff was extremely friendly constantly circulating, checking in with us and cleaning.  We split a full rack which was good.  It was a little fatty for me and could have been served a little hotter.  The ribs were more than enough for both of us and had a great smokey flavor.  Three types of hot barbeque sauce are available and were good as well.  The sides were OK.  For the price, food and commendable staff and bonus free soft serve ice cream I would rate it a four stars."}
{"text":"It's not often I get to write this kind review. I absolutely enjoyed my visit here this evening I had just a pulled pork sandwich and it was great but I'll tell you the staff was very outgoing I was a newbie there so she came around the counter and showed me the specials gave me the whole Lowdown on ordering I have to say that there was one gal particular that just made it absolutely wonderful. It was great food at a very reasonable price and very enjoyable the place was clean and I got free ice cream after my meal! Excellent place I highly recommend it children eat free on Sundays, so if ypur not much for the possiblity of  alot children, I'm thinking, you might want to skip Sundays but,  if you've got children and are looking to head out forva family meal Sunday's might be great! Either way I'm sure you'll enjoy it here!"}
{"text":"Dickeys BBQ is a damn fine place to eat really good and leave full. I'm a Dallas man born and raised. Majority of the family is from Kansas city Missouri so I'd say well experienced with the entire spectrum including Memphis pit and the Carolinas. Yes the gentleman mentioned costs. That's typical for good BBQ.  If a choice piece of meat is properly done it can take half a day and often longer to get the beautiful pink smoke ring. Some things are just worth paying for unless a person wants to tackle it at home which requires more skill than \"meat on fire\".  Ha. Texas uses dry rubs as KC is a wet mop sauce. Nothing extravagant but is a place to get your BBQ fix quick."}
{"text":"First time here and I don't think we have this place in California. Really good sauces and they have free ice cream! Their whole concept is great and they have the food to back it up. I'd come back again when I visit Vegas."}
{"text":"First time here and the BBQ is phenomenal. The sides are just as good; best baked beans I have had since living in Las Vegas. I didn't give it a fifth star because the young people behind the counter were dropping f-bombs and being loud, which normally I wouldn't care, but people don't normally walk into a restaurant and hear about what one of the guy's working there did to a girl. Good food though, staff just needs to grow up."}
{"text":"For a \"fast food BBQ joint\" I really thought this was pretty good.  They give you A LOT of food for your money too.  The brisket was dry but the pulled pork was really juicy and full of flavor.  Everyone in my group liked what they had, no complaints.  I'd go back given the chance."}
{"text":"I like this place, Only issue I had was the ribs were not ready yet. So I ended up purchasing a pulled pork sandwich.  Sandwich was good, I had chips with it. Service is very good, and always there to serve you when needed. I want to try their ribs, so I will be coming back again. They do have a good size menu, and ice cream for the kiddos."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate lunch at Dickey's during a recent stay in Madison.  Chain bbq restaurant.  It was clean inside.  Kind of an upscale fast food atmosphere.  Stand in line and place your order and they give you your tray.  A little pricier than typical fast food.  Expect to spend about $10 for lunch.  The bbq brisket sandwich was good but was not anything special.  Very good selection of side dishes.  The fried okra was a star.  Good place to satisfy your bbq cravings but I would not go far out of my way to eat here."}
{"text":"OMG!  Bomb food. . Had the Western Wednesday special with Mc and cheese and coleslaw.  best bbq around.    they need to sell beer... Good service and great atmosphere. .."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night and really enjoyed the rib meal.  Staff was very polite and nice.  The Pork ribs were great, I found that by \"blending\" their 3 sauces that I ended up with flavors I really liked (sweet with heat) and the sides were nice.  Green beans/bacon reminded me of those my Grandmother made - nostalgic moment here.  Potato Casserole was probably a serious calorie coma inducer but then again I WAS at a BBQ restaurant.  I ordered just water and they gave me a Dickey's cup.  $12 before tip, looking forward to returning"}
{"text":"So when I used to travel to Texas I would always make a stop at Dickey's in Dallas. They were everywhere and were always great. This location is not consistent with the Dickey's I knew from Texas.   The location is very small. Not like any Dickey's I have ever been in. It's also poorly laid out. I don't think they really thought that design thru. The drink area is a one person at a time ordeal with no return if there is another person there.  When you order you have to speak loudly and it feels very unorganized. Too many people asking me what I want and I have no idea who is filling my order. The one person at a time thing takes a long time to order even with 5 or so people in line. I can't imagine that place during a lunch rush.  The eating area is small and cramped.   The food was OK but not up to the Texas locations I have been to where the food is much better and taste really good. There was something missing and the meat lacked flavor or intensity like the Texas locations.  There seemed to be a fair amount of confusion as well. On top of that there was a young lady working there who seemed to like to roll her eyes a lot. This is extremely annoying. She came out to wipe tables and rolled her eyes when she found a misplaced napkin. When she found something else she again made some half cocked comment and rolled her eyes and when I asked about the sweet tea she again rolled her eyes at me while one of the other women (who looked like they were owners or invested) helped me. She looked to be related to someone or maybe just has a bad habit or rolling her eyes every time you ask her for anything but it's annoying enough to never want to go back and look at her roll her eyes at me every again. It's just disrespectful.  Everyone else in there was nice and engaging but there are still lots of kinks to sort out. Let's hope they decide to move to a larger location cause Texas BBQ can't be in a space that small...it needs a Texas sized location!"}
{"text":"Growing up in the Deep South I know my bbq. To my total amazement,  my local Arby's got replaced with something wonderful!! Never heard of Dickey's before but hey, I'm all in for them after a couple of visits!  The meat is 5 stars! Maybe a little on the smoky side. The sides and breads average.  I'm not gonna knock them on that though, I get a side of potato salad with my brisket, just so I don't feel guilty about eating my vegetables!   I don't like sweet bbq sauce and Dickey's instantly won me over here. They have sweet stuff if that's your thing,  but their original sauce is awesome. It's tangy with a tad sweet and spicy but not like pouring candy on it.  I use the sauce sparingly, the flavor of the meat is outstanding on its own!  Growing up in Georgia, the best bbq was your own...Out here in AZ, when you need some good bbq and don't have the time like we did to do it right at home, Dicky's is a welcome neighbor!"}
{"text":"This is a chain restaurant, the food is good, staff is friendly, menu a little confusing on your fist visit. It's a stand in line to order type place, there's are a few tables. The staff does a good job of cleaning the tables as people leave but can be busy at lunch time, may have to wait a few minutes tor a table. The turn over is usually pretty quick. Better than most fast food places but it does cost more."}
{"text":"All I can say is kids eat free on Sunday I have a Family of five and it's not cheep to go out to eat I feed everyone foe 25 bucks it's great and the kids get free ice cream"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for an early dinner and the place was empty which got me a little worried. I can't say much that would be useful about the service since we were the only customers however it was very fast.  My wife had the pulled beef and I had the pulled pork. The portions were generous and the meat was appropriately prepared.  They do have a variety of sauces so I tried them all and enjoyed each of them. I will definitely go back and try other menu selections."}
{"text":"This Dickey's Barbecue Pit has improved my impression of this chain. The Madison East location left a bad taste in my mouth. This location had friendly staff working on the Sunday night that I went in.   I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with two sides and small beverage. I had the baked beans with french fries. The beans were delish! The fries were good enough.   I really like the fact that I can get some ice cream after eating, it just adds to the whole experience.   If I had to offer any advice it would be to put some sort of open sign facing Greenway Blvd. The back windows are blacked out and the front of the store faces the Marriot so it's hard to tell when they are open. I do see the signs in the grass but they still don't draw enough attention. As someone who lives walking distance of this location I hope to see just a few things improve to help earn them a 4 or 5 star review."}
{"text":"This place did not deliver... By that I've heard my \"okay\" things about it. I wasn't impressed. It seemed over priced for the little food you could get. I ordered a bbq sandwich and that alone was $6.xx. It wasn't very big, the bread tasted way too processed.   I won't be back..."}
{"text":"Since the closure of RUB, I have been on a quest to find good BBQ in vegas.  So far Dickey's is top of the list. I worked down the street, and had lunch quite a few times here.  The BBQ is good and it's served pretty fast. The menu is rather limited, but the few things they do, they do well.  Plus they have a 5 gallon vat of pickles, and I am a pickle freak, and they have free ice cream bye the door on your way out.  They usually run some good specials, so keep an eye out and you can score a sandwich for under a buck.  In a town with limited bbq, Dickey's works when I need my brisket or pulled pork fix, it's not the world's greatest but amongst the best in vegas (which isn't really saying much)"}
{"text":"Customer Service and food was great! I had the pulled pork, beef brisket, loaded potato salad, mac n cheese, and a sweet tea! Everything was fantastic. I tried all three BBQ sauces and my only complaint was the \"spicy\" sauce wasn't very spicy... But still good! We will definitely be making this a place we frequent!"}
{"text":"I first tried them in McKinney TX and I was not a fan.   It was like eating steamed meat with no flavor. I was a bit surprised actually as to why my Texas born bride was so excited to eat there?  Because of this new Las Vegas location, I like Dickey's. I live walking distance from a Famous Dave's, but it's nice to change it up sometimes.   I've been to this location twice now and it was consistent. The staff is very accommodating and will fix any issues you may have if you just ask.    The ordering process is a bit annoying, especially for short people. They have this castle like wall that you have to call out your order to the person behind it chopping up your meat selection. The menu is so high up that you will hurt your neck even if you can read it clearly. You then move down the line and call out your side dishes. You then get to the end, and have to tell the cashier what you ordered. If you are buying for a group of people, you might want to write it all down lest you make everyone in line wait longer. I'm not a fan of this system. It's backwards, UN-efficient, and mistakes can (and have) be(en) made. It is designed for one person at a time which must be hell when its busy.  The layout of the restaurant needs some rethinking. I haven't been here for a busy dinner, but not sure I would want to especially if I was in a wheel chair.  There is only one 4ft wide isle that gets you from the back to front of the restaurant. If you come with more than 4 people, you may not get to sit together because there is no room for joining tables.  Once you get your order and get your beverage, you have to cut through some tables and dodge around other people trying to do the same thing as you.   Most of the needed space is being wasted by the enormous one-person-at-a-time backwards ordering line. They have these large connected pillars to indicate an ordering line that is about 5 feet in width. No one needs that much space to stand.  My suggestion would be to invest in a POS system with 2 order takers at the front of the line. The POS system will assign guests a ticket number, tell the meat cutters what to make, track all the data you can ever use and simplify the process of getting hot food out to hungry guests as fast as possible.  Have an ORDER HERE in the beginning and a PICK UP HERE at the end.  Let the guests get their beverages and fixins while they wait for their number to be called. 86 the connected pillars please.  FOOD  The brisket can be hit or miss. It tends to dry out on your plate if you dilly dally with eating it. Pulled pork was as it should be. Turkey was really, really good.   I've tried their bbq beans and mac n cheese which were very good. Cole slaw was forgettable, okra perfectly fried. The little roll they give you with the combos is soft and fresh and useful if you like building a BBQ slider at your table.   They certainly know how BBQ properly at Dickey's, I only wish they seasoned their meat more.   I shall return"}
{"text":"Love their Macaroni Cheese & Potato Salad. It was delicious. Customer service was awesome. TY. Will be there again soon!"}
{"text":"... We really liked Dickey's when it was at Norterra and were sad they closed down and even more worried to try this location after seeing the reviews for this location..  First, to the guy who complained the portions were small and didn't fill you up, you sir, ruined my dining experience because instead of ordering the Little Hoagie and two sides, I opted for the Big BBQ sandwich with Mac N Cheese and Waffle Fries.. Now I'm so stuffed I can barely shove down a FREE ice cream cone! Listen here, I am an EATER.. I can eat a 300 pound man under the table (not literally of course, but you know).. So the fact that I left uncomfortably full should mean something to anyone who knows me..   At any rate, I even was worried about ordering and noted the time I placed my order.. Except that as I was paying 30 seconds later, food was ready.. Saturday night at 6:15 pm.. Maybe some people caught them on an off night because we didn't have any of those problems!   My husband ordered the 2 meat plate with spicy sausage and pulled pork. I don't like sausage (insert sarcastic comment here), so I can't give a review for it.. But he enjoyed the food, too, and really liked the baked potato casserole! He thinks it's a little pricey, but that's BBQ places for you.. Plus, I would pay a little more for no fatty meat.  We will be back.. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Their entire menu is awesome. During my lunch hour I order the westerner with a side of mac and cheese. One of the best BBQ I've had in a long time. The sides they serve are also worth checking out too. They have barbecue beans, backed potato casserole, coleslaw, and much more. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves outdoor BBQ. I will definitely be back soon enough."}
{"text":"It is what it is.  If you've actually had good barbecue, don't set your standards too high.   It's a chain barbecue restaurant.  I've had the ribs and the smoked turkey from here.  It is what it is."}
{"text":"Line of 6 or more people around 6:30pm yesterday...5 kids behind the counter that didn't know jackpoop! Food is a nice bbq fusion of all sorts...and the bbq sauce is taaaaasty, BUT...Houston, we have a problem- no one will ever come back if your team members are not properly trained. I thought I saw a lady just leave because it was taking so long. Food for thought would be to send some secret shoppers (aka buddies or family members of yours) in a few times to see what WE ( my fellow yelper, Mike W and I) are talking about.  Not sure how many people will give it a second chance AND you have a prime location :("}
{"text":"THIS WAS THE BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT... First of all we ordered 3 entrees and found multiple hairs in two of them.... :(   The sides were watery and bland.. The ribs, brisket and pork lacked flavor,, They gave such a small amount of BBQ sauce and more was needed just for flavor.. I would not rush back here.... You can get bad bbq any where in Madison the big difference being the complimentary hair... (honest)"}
{"text":"I was working in the area and in the mood for BBQ.  I ordered the two meat plate, two meats and two sides, and a drink. Price just under $15.  For the meats I had pulled pork and sliced brisket. For the sides I had bbq beans and baked potato casserole (loaded mashed potatoes).  I'll start with the sides. One of the things I like about bbq places is trying the different sides each place offers. The baked potato casserole was excellent, the bbq beans average at best.  Before I get to the meats, a little background is needed. I have three smokers at home a vertical, a side box and a gas vertical. That being said, I'm no stranger to bbq, so my bar may be a little higher, than the average bbq eater.  Both of the meats were dry from being over cooked, they needed sauce to make them moist. Good bbq is kept moist while cooking, it doesn't need sauce, after cooking, for moisture. The sauce, after cooking, is something you add to personal taste, if at all.  The pulled pork was less dry,  I tried it without sauce and it had a decent taste on it's own. I still ended up putting sauce on it because it was dry and I wanted to sample the sauces. The portion was generous, I had leftovers of the pork.  Now the brisket, totally over cooked and dry. You have the option of sliced or chopped. I ordered it sliced, though it didn't make much difference, you couldn't cut it without it breaking into little pieces. It's suppose to be tender, but retain it's structural integrity. You should be able to cut a piece off and pick it up with a fork, not a chance. I tried to pick the bite up with a fork and ended up with little pieces on the tines of the fork, the rest of the bite was sitting in the basket in pieces. It was so dry it absolutely needed sauce. The portion was less generous, no leftovers.  Since I mentioned the need for sauce, they had three sauces, normal, hot n spicy and sweet. Since I had plenty of dry meat that needed sauce, I tried all three. They were all three good sauces. I liked the regular, the hot and the sweet, in that order, but that's a personal taste. I don't care for sweet bbq sauces in general, if I'm using store bought sauces, I prefer Chris and Pitts, to KC or SBR's sauce, because it's less sweet.  Summary: The above being said, the place is not terrible, I've had far worse bbq. Would I go there again, probably not."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I love the fire wood that is placed in front of the counter, I almost wanted to take it home with me! The chicken is moist and well seasoned and their sweet bbq sauce that is in the condiments section is so good! So is the spicy one which I put on the ribs. The ribs are small but good. I enjoyed the pulled pork and added some sweet sauce to it. It was a little on the dry side. The Mac n cheese is forgettable but edible. The creamed spinach is good. The roll was not something I'd eat, too hard and uneventful lol  The staff was friendly and they were interviewing a high school kid while I dined in. The tacos seem boring...just meat and cheese...who wants that?"}
{"text":"Great sliced beef sandwich. I'm a seasoned BBQ lover, and this place hit the spot.  Not exactly like we had back in the motherland of TX, but as good as anything I have found in AZ. Will be coming back to get my fix. The baked beans seemed to be out of a can, but I still enjoyed them. The Shiner Bock was a great compliment."}
{"text":"Just opened, went there for lunch with some work friends. They had a great friday afternoon lunch special and were giving out free drinks for the grand opening. The manager, in fact all of the employees, were very welcoming and catered to us throughout the meal. Sit down restaurant service, at fast food pace and price. Will be back for lunch again soon. Recommend over the boring subway lunch that you're used to."}
{"text":"Good bbq if you in a pinch  it's not Texas bbq but it's good . The sauces are good . Place was clean very helpful Friendly staff all around good place  I had a pulled pork brisket sandwich with Mac and cheese  was good"}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  Horrible, horrible Customer Service. I get up to order and she doesnt say hi no eye contact. What do you want?? So i thought to myself ok she is having a bad day  It happens.So i order and she was just chopping away and  throwing meat on the floor. As Im watching her I told my husband lets go. she take a other order and just leave my food there.  so i get up to the cashier and let her know that my order and can i get my sides. My food was cold by the time i sat down to eat. Im sitting there with my husband and daughter. We look around and everyone there is pissed off. My husband ask the cashier to turn some music on maybe it would help the mood in the place. I will not go there again or recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Not the Dickey's of old but, still good. This new little location was busy throughout our visit. Our service was fast and friendly. The brisket was done perfectly. The jalapeno cheddar kielbasa was a bit dry along with the pulled pork. The beans and potato salad is good, the creamed spinach really needs more spinach, the slaw is perfect. The cleaning of the tables could be kept up a bit better however the bathrooms where spotless.   Cheers, I'm sure Dirty & Dude will visit again.   History lesson;  Dickey's Barbecue Pit is a true American success story. In 1941, Travis Dickey, a World War II veteran, opened the first Dickey's Barbecue Pit in Dallas, Texas. Dickey was a true Texas character blessed with the gift of gab and the love of authentic, slow-smoked barbecue. In the beginning, Dickey's Barbecue Pit was truly a family operation with Travis working the block and Miss Ollie Dickey serving sandwiches. Space on the restaurant sign was rented out to help pay the start-up costs for the restaurant and the menu was limited to beef brisket, pit hams, barbecue beans, potato chips, beer, bottled milk and sodas.  Brothers Roland and T.D. Dickey took over the business in 1967, continuing their father's legacy of quality, hickory smoked signature meats. Under the direction of the Dickey brothers, Dickey's Barbecue Pit expanded throughout the Dallas Fort Worth area and quickly became known throughout Texas for mouthwatering hickory-smoked barbecue, popular catered events and the iconic Big Yellow Cups. Franchising began in 1994 after loyal guests and barbecue fanatics demanded more locations. Today with nearly 600 locations in 43 states, loyal guests are what keep Dickey's thriving in every community.  The brand has come a long way from Travis Dickey's first location. But, some things never change. Dickey's Barbecue Pit still slow smokes all meats on-site just the same way they did in 1941. The menu features beef brisket, pulled pork, St. Louis style ribs, polish sausage, spicy cheddar sausage, smoked turkey, and marinated chicken, with an extensive array of homestyle sides from jalape√±o beans to macaroni and cheese. Buttery rolls are served with every meal along with complementary ice cream. And just like always, kids eat free on Sunday.  Roland Dickey, Jr. became Chief Executive Officer in 2006 continuing the family tradition. As the fast casual chain racks up recognition, the Dickey family still serves up the same quality barbecue recipes handed down for generations coupled with the same brand of southern hospitality, only on a much larger scale.

{"text":"Just found this place.  I got the brisket sandwich..one side potato..one dessert.  Tons of meat.  I was expecting some sauce but it tasted great as is."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp a couple weeks ago. Went there on a Sunday after church. Totally surprised me. The food was delicious and at a great price. Free self serve ice cream! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Went back again today and same pleasant experience. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I have tried to eat at this restaurant two times. Both times they were literally out of turkey, chicken AND ribs. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Always Good  I have visited Dickey's a few times and I've never been disappointed. The food is always good, service is always great, and the restaurant  is always clean.  On this visit we shared a nice variety of smoked chicken, ribs, brisket, macaroni and cheese, potato salad, cold slaw, and hot rolls.   Dickey's is reasonably priced and good value for the buck"}
{"text":"Average at best. Everything seems precooked and packaged. I guess that isn't the craziest idea. Sometimes I need a little quick brisket. Buns are decent. Can get in and out without problems."}
{"text":"Awesome bbq spot!!! I had the three meat platter with polish sausage, brisket and pulled pork. My sides were fried okra (surprisingly tasty!), bbq beans and Mac and cheese. Everything. Was extra tasty and filling! Bonus, kids eat free on Sunday's! Don't forget to have your free ice cream cone on the way out."}
{"text":"This place is great! Portions are good, I think ppl who are complaining are gluttons. Best okra in town. The guys behind the counter are helpful and honest."}
{"text":"I was a first time customer and was extremely pleased.  Dan ( one of the workers, possibly manager) took time out of his day to explain everything and recommend they're delicious brisket along with two sides. Everything was absolutely delicious and Dan went above and beyond. I will be back"}
{"text":"Cleveland is a city devoid of acceptable BBQ. I have wandered through this city in a state of smokeless depression for far too long. Famous Dave's is a reasonable option if you want to sit and make an evening with some good chain BBQ but it's not the kind of place like you find in other great cities across the country where you can pull up a stool and grub down on quick, delicious meat.   When I saw that Dickey's plopped down next to Parma mall a few months ago I eyed it with trepidation. Parma is a hotbed for bland, boring cuisine and with no smokey smell permeating outside, I wasn't sure I should take the chance.   Thank goodness I did. Today I rolled in with a serious craving for pulled pork. Like I said, you won't smell the smoke outside but once you step in you'll be hit with a glorious punch of tangy smoked goodness. It's a shame that they aren't venting some of that smell to the public because it would drum up more business for them (although they told me they've been extremely busy since they opened).   Inside you are greeted by a nicely decorated interior that is true to its homey roots. The staff were extremely friendly and immediately I could tell that they truly love their BBQ.  That's what puts a joint like this ahead of others in the city. There is joy in their food.   I ordered 'The Westerner' sandwich with pulled pork and brisket along with a side of jalape√±o green beans and baked beans. I started off with my piping hot sides which, to be honest, we're a little disappointing, but not bad. Once I drenched them in their homemade hot BBQ sauce, it changed the story completely. The sauces were great!   The sandwich was the star of the meal. I held moist slow-smoked meat with the perfect amount of sauce, topped with pickles, onion and cheese. There are many styles of BBQ across the country and I couldn't quite place where this flavor originated but I can tell you that it was good. It's more similar to Georgia or Tennessee BBQ than Kansas City or the Carolinas. Was it Oklahoma Joe's (Kansas City) good, or Heavy's (Mountain Home, TN) good? No. Definitely no. But I've found that with BBQ, it is futile to compare meat across borders. Dickey's is certainly the best BBQ I've tasted within 200 miles of Cleveland. They should consider that a huge compliment.   As far as cost goes, I found the prices fair for what I got. BBQ is a bit more expensive than other foods in general so my meal came out to about $11... More than I like to spend for lunch but it was enough for that I took a to-go box for a second meal.   I tip my hat to Dickey (if there is a Dickey) and thank him for finally bringing some good BBQ to these parts. You've made a young man very happy! Now please figure out a way to pipe that glorious smell out to the public. Share the wealth!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! I ordered the Rib plate and the servings are so generous and the sides were yummy. I got the fried okra and the mac and cheese. It's been difficult to find fast food BBQ for a good price and living in Texas kinda made me a BBQ expert... I'll be back to try the brisket soon!"}
{"text":"Ordered our food for pick up it was done right on time that we were told, placed our sides in little cups so our sandwiches didn't get soggy and everything was hot and delicious."}
{"text":"I remember this place on Chandler Blvd many years ago.  As I recall it disappeared shortly after the Chandler Mall was built and Dave's BBQ opened.  Dave's isn't the best, but it certainly was better.  Suddenly my wife discovers this location.  Well, we were in the area last night so we stopped in.  Joe's crown is safe (Joe's Real BBQ). Dickey's was totally ordinary. The beans tasted exactly like Bush's beans.  As canned beans go, Bush's are good.  But I expect more in a restaurant than opening a can.  The brisket had no sign of rub or smoke flavor.  It was properly cooked, but tasted like unseasoned beef.  The pork was a bit better, but still bland.  Sauce was mandatory to get any BBQ flavor at all (which good BBQ should NOT require).  I saw a bottle of the sauce and it has HFCS instead of actual brown sugar.   The waffle fries were very good.  They do have free soft serve ice cream, which is a nice touch.  But overall \"I've experienced better\".  I might go 2.5 stars, maybe.  And if I have to round my rating I absolutely cannot go to three stars."}
{"text":"Good food is great, good BBQ is greater.  However, excellent service is a true gem.  Yes the food is fantastic, they even have okra, but the staff could not have been better.  Welcoming, knowledgeable, patient, fun, and friendly make this place a treasure."}
{"text":"This is a franchise BBQ place.  There are several of them.  I believe they originated in Texas.  They had a special on pulled pork which is what drew us in.  So we had pulled pork sandwiches, green beans, potato casserole, and pecan pie.  Because of the special promotion it was a really good deal.  Good value.  However, regular pricing is a bit steep.  So...how was the pork, you ask?  It was OK.  I really didn't taste much evidence of a rub or smokiness.  It was moist and tasted like good pork, but that's all.  Good BBQ doesn't require any sauce, but if you want some flavor you will need it.  The good news is that their sauce is actually pretty tasty.  So I put a good helping on my pulled pork sandwich.  The green beans were a little overcooked for me, and I actually like mine overcooked.  But the flavor was pretty good.  The \"potato casserole\" was really just a cheesy mashed potato.  The flavor was good.  I didn't have any pie, but my wife indicated it was mediocre.  Not bad, but not something she would want to pay for again.  The staff was slow, but very friendly.  They apologized several times for \"the delay\".  At least with the customers they were very cheerful.  Obviously we did not sample the ribs or brisket.  So I can't comment specifically on those.  But what we did have was pretty average.  Not much smokiness to the meat, and sides that were fine but not great.  And they were small.  Yes, I have \"experienced better\".  But I do think this place is better than just two stars.  I wouldn't make a point of coming here, but neither would I refuse to go if others wanted to come here.  There are better places, though, and not very far from here."}
{"text":"I am typically polite and will eat almost anything despite my feelings of the pallet. But in all honesty I am very picky and will critique every small imperfect detail and forever judge those responsible. This holds true especially when it comes to BBQ. My favorite of all foods. So when I entered Dickeys BBQ Pit, I immediately began my assessment.   A decent smell immediately filled my nostrils when I opened the entrance door. My stomach, which was empty, immediately began to rumble. But not for BBQ. It smelled like meat cooking but not BBQing. I was instantly concerned. I love when a grill is fired up and the combination of good old American BBQ is smoking, which should consist of a sweet tangy smell and thick cut beef.  Sigh but anyways the decor was cool. It was picnic themed. Not alot of places to sit though. It was either sit near foot traffic or near the bathrooms. The tables were very small and cramped too.   The staff was friendly. They greeted my party and I. The menu is pretty simple. We got the family order which is two meats 1lb each, three sides, and seven rolls. Drinks were seperate. Overall the cost was $49.   The pitmaster imformed me that all items on the menu were made from scratch. Pretty cool. All food was already made though. They pulled the meats from the ovens and the sides from the back. We were eating within 15 minutes of coming in.  So for the meats we ordered 1lb of pulled pork. And two 1/2lbs of sausage. One was spicy and the other was jalepnio spicy. For the sides we chose macoroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, and bbq'd beans.   Despite the small cramped table we were all able to make our plates and began eating.   The pulled pork was ok. It was a little cold but cooked just right. It lacked sufficient seasoning in my personal opinion but it was still good. Also I should mention they provided three types of BBQ sauce on the side. They were sweet, spicy, and original. I paired my pulled pork with spicy. BBQ sauce was perfect. It had a nice spicy punch with a savory sweet tangy lingering after taste. It didn't burn and yet fulfilled my spicy needs.   Both sausages were quite good. I was very impressed. Each bite was delectable. The jalepenio was injected with cheese. Good Lord! The other one allowed me to enjoy the sausage in itself which did not disappoint, let me tell you.   The BBQ beans and Mac and cheese weren't anything special. I mean they were good but they didn't have a wow factor. However, the mashed potatoes were on a different level. They were mashed to perfection. They were sprinkled with large chive chuncks. They were lightly buttered. They had a nice top layer of cheese on top. They even had a slight burnt crunchy layer on top. Very good. There were other sides to choose and when I go back (and I will) I will try them, but I will still get the mashed potatoes.  Also the rolls were pretty good. They had a unique underbaked style to them that was quite enjoyable. The kids in my party made mini sanwhiches with them. I wish we got more than 7 though. When we find a dish that we like, we like to have seconds and even thirds sometimes. A family of five (two adults and three children) will not be satisfied with 7 rolls.   Overall the experience was good. Very good BBQ eatery. Kids eat free on Sundays and everyday there is free unlimited ice cream. (rootbeer floats anyone). I rate this place a 5/5. The only changes I would make is the tables and the amount of rolls served. I will definately be back."}
{"text":"Had the 1 meat plate [$10]  Brisket was fresh & amazing.  It was just thing I was craving.  My sides were the baked potato casserole & greens beans.  Friendly staff too!  Ended up getting kids sized cups for 1.50.  [*] I let them know I had cold Brisket they were apologetic & told me they'd have fresh Brisket out for me.  Sure enough they did!  Came right out with a huge serving I took a photo of the nice portion."}
{"text":"Just ordered online for pick up and can definitely say that I am not impressed at all with the size of the meals we received.  Ordered the 1/2 lb of ribs with 2 sides and a roll and received 3 small ribs and 2 small sides. I have never received so few ribs before at a BBQ restaurant when ordering a half slab or half pound and was actually quite offended at the lack of the remainder of the 1/2 lb of ribs I was promised. I had also requested a couple of sides of their original BBQ sauce which was also omitted, possibly I imagine, because there wasn't enough ribs to need any additional BBQ sauce at all.  I ordered the classic sandwich for my husband and asked that they add coleslaw, onions and cheddar cheese which came with two sides as well. His sandwich was quite big with plenty of meat and the sides were on the smallish size as well, just like mine. The onions, cheese and coleslaw were present, however. So that was nice and apparently tasted very good with the sandwich. (Can't get much in the way of adjectives out of my husband in the way of description of food. He either eats it, or complains about it. In this case, he ate it and was happy.)  Now that I am done criticizing the extreme lack of food that I received for the same price I would pay anywhere else I will speak to the quality. It was delicious. The ribs were exactly what I was craving and the baked beans were perfectly spiced and seasoned. I tried some of the brisket from my hubby's sandwich and was pleasantly surprised as well.  I also got a slice of the pecan pie and was equally surprised to find that they make theirs without corn syrup. It, too was delicious as I find corn syrup in the recipe for pecan pie to be too sickeningly sweet.  I will most likely return to Dickey's for another meal, but it will likely be for lunch and only for myself since the concept of sharing the rib meal with anyone else was not an option as I had planned to do. Three tiny ribs was seriously a let-down. If you're jonesing for ribs and are looking to share, buy the full rack. That might just come with enough to share between two people. Maybe."}
{"text":"Well the highly anticipated barbecue rib place was extremely disappointing went through the drive-through on three different occasions they did not have ribs and they tried to push pulled pork on me I said I was interested in the ribs and this is the third time.  surprisingly and I don't know why I went back-and-forth time and they did have barbecue spareribs! They were old dry and the flavor had me needing to drink something to take t terrible taste out of my mouth I figured I wasn't going to eat them that I would give them to my dogs and to my surprise they sat there for two days my dogs did not even eat them either"}
{"text":"One star is being very generous I went there six times trying to order a full slab of baby back ribs since they're known for ribs each time they didn't have it so I left I didn't order anything else then to my surprise the seventh time they had the ribs they were the worst I have ever ever tasted they tasted like dirt   I went back to the window to return them and she told me that they could not exchange it for something else I stated that they are an edible and only one bite was taken out of the ribs they refused to give me something else and they refused to give me my money back which is fine because I will never go back there again and asked for my guests they tried the pork pulled sandwiches which they threw away and we went to Lucille's barbecue which was amazing"}
{"text":"Great food and good prices. Plenty of deals to be had. Plus, free ice cream and pickles. Join the Big Yellow Cup Club. Kids love this place."}
{"text":"Customer service is awesome this place rocks!.... I was hungry and had never eaten there before, and they made some amazingly tasty recommendations and everything was hot and moist, their brisket and ribs, sausage and chicken are on point!.... The fried okra is very good and I don't like okra!.... The cheesy spinach is reality good too.... Highly recommend stopping by"}
{"text":"Tried out this new location and was very happy with the food and friendly service. I had the Friday Special, which was the pulled pork and my husband had the smoked sausage. Each came with two sides. The creamed spinach is the bomb! It was recommended by one of the employees and we were so happy we tried it. Also had the baked potato casserole and the barbecued beans which were very good as well. They have three different barbecue sauces to choose from. If you like spicy they have one that is exactly that! And not to be forgotten - they have free soft serve ice cream. Our meal was delicious and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place out for awhile my daughter treated me to this establishment very nice people nice to clean however here we go I am  Advocate barbecue woman that cooks BBQ for years with good seasoning good marinations and take my time. We ordered the two meat platter.  I'm used to have smoke seasoning and a great taste, from the pic however this tastes like boiled meat with some barbecue sauce splashed on it, macaroni and cheese taste like it came straight out of a can I asked for my money back because we were that's not satisfied was told they don't give refunds or put money back on gift card, he said you're welcome to order something else so I was going to deal with the issue with my food however, my daughter  decided to order a loaded baked potato guess what oh my goodness they're out of potatoes!!!!! the stand in manager got involved gave us back our money and we moved on from there never-the-less not sure if we were to visit this establishment so for you that this place you must have never ate some Southern BBQ with seasoning please view the picture for sloppiness for preparation wish you all the best of luck!!! But the lemonade was the bomb I'll give you that!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch. Visited with Dan T. for a lunch break one day and it was amazing. My favorite dish was the side of sausages you can get with cheddar and jalapeno chunks in them. Highly recommended if your're in a BBQ mood for the day."}
{"text":"I pre-ordered our family meal and the person on the phone said they will have it ready in 15 minutes! When i got there I had to wait in additional 30minutes. Food was alight."}
{"text":"Well that was disappointing.  We've been coming to this location on and off for several years, and found it to be consistently good.  On our last visit, I noticed the menu had changed.  More of a focus on sausage and chicken, the Lil' Hoagie was replaced with sliders, some of the sides are gone, tacos were added.  I should have ended it there.  But I didn't.  Even after we got the list of stuff they were out of, we still stuck it out.  My husband and I both ordered the Fancy pulled pork sandwich which was supposed to have slaw on it.  I also added pickle and onion.  Both sandwiches arrived with nothing but meat, so really not so \"fancy\" after all, and I had to ask for those items after the fact.  The pulled pork was much saltier than it used to be and a whole lot greasier, too.  If that had been my experience at the first visit, I would have never returned.    As it stands, I may not.  It seems the attempt to fix what wasn't broken might have backfired.  The place was really busy, so perhaps I am in the minority in my disappointment."}
{"text":"Great BBQ place! The cheddar jalape√±o kielbasa is amazing. We also tried the okra, waffle fries, BBQ beans, and Mac n cheese. Love the rolls too. Try all 3 of the sauces, but the hot is awesome. Customer service was great, the guy even ran out the last item of our order that didn't make it into the bag before we drove off. It was definitely appreciated."}
{"text":"Super delicious!!! The staff were great and friendly!! I am still thinking about the delicious polish sausage sandwich I had! Thanks guys! Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"This review is mainly for walk in/take out. All I can say is that I'm happy there's one in Surprise now because I can stop by after work on the way home and grab food to go. The place is quaint, not too large. I'm thinking of bringing my staff there so we can try some of their lunch combos.  I ordered the beef brisket chopped, the slow cooked pork, and the cheddar jalape√±o kielbasa. I didn't get the family combo but the one smaller than that so 1lb of pork and 1/4lb each of kielbasa and beef brisket. I think it came with 4 dinner rolls. It came with 2 sides, so I went with baked beans and potato casserole which was very mashed potato-ish but awesome, just as they recommended it to be!   I wouldn't compare Dickey's to the greatest BBQ ever but when you're in a bind, and want something to satiate that craving, then this is a good chain place to try. Everyone who works there was very friendly and there's so many combos you can try.. a bit salty for me this past time so just be sure to hydrate well!"}
{"text":"Texas meets Carolina BBQ is the best way to describe it.  All the meat and side were excellent and the staff was awesome.   A bit pricy for the portions but considering the location that is no surprise.    I'll be back if I'm in Balentyne ."}
{"text":"Great experience! Everyone is super friendly with fast service. Neat and clean inside. Awesome menu options, hearty servings at a great price!"}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced. I ordered the two meat plate for $15.94 I ordered it with ribs and brisket when I got home I looked at it it had two ribs in it that's it and not even enough brisket to make a sandwich.  If this is the way they want to run their business by exploiting their customers good luck with that! I will never be back to this place. Oh by the way the food was subpar period lot of fat on the ribs."}
{"text":"Nice new place. Ike the food, should definitely try a pulled pork sandwich. The staff was friendly and it was a great place for kids."}
{"text":"We came here because other locations have been awesome  The guy cutting meat was dripping sweat and should have used a towel but obviously didn't care.  there were about 7 people working but everything took a really long time to be prepared for some unknown reason.   The dripping sweat guy was replaced with somebody who had a bandana around his head, probably because he knew people don't like the idea of somebody sweating all over their food.  although the sweaty guy came back to prepare food...  Again, 7 people and it probably took us about 10 minutes to order as nobody knew what we were ordering or communicating to anybody.  This is not complicated, you ask for meat and sides and move on, maybe ask some questions about what comes with what but all together it is simple...    After we ordered and sat down I was asked by each employee how I liked my food.  This would seem fine but after 7 people working at a place where food takes to long, a guy is dripping sweat and everybody is talking about getting out of there ASAP, I begin to wonder what the heck did they do to my food that EVERYBODY wants to know how I enjoyed it...  Not to mention the entire floor felt greasy and slippery...  I think the owner of this location really needs to do some quality control.  For $15 I will never ever ever go back to this location.  I will also tell EVERYONE I know about this experience.  good luck."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable, I'm loving the half pound of pulled pork with cold slaw and bbq bake beans. Always great and for a good price."}
{"text":"First time visit Friday night 7pm and was not happy on how long i stood waiting to place order. I was told that on-line orders come first ! all i wanted was a full rack of ribs to try . For $22.95 a rack was disappointed did not come with any sides. The ribs were ok not great the ends were dry.The station with BBQ sauces was a mess and only one still had any sauce. I had been in the food service business for over 35 years and most likely will not go back"}
{"text":"It was my first time trying out this place just because my husband had Dickey's BBQ before but in different area.  I was very disappointed they didn't have fried okra or anything that has to do with fried food due to changing their menu.  I ordered their beef brisket, it was good but only gives you small portions especially when I ordered the plate menu.  I'm sorry to say I'm not coming back to this place!"}
{"text":"My family and I eat at Dickey's often and We love that they offer such a great military discount. That all changed during tonight's visit. When we arrived the woman with the blue hair seemed extremely annoyed and acted as if we were an inconvenience. We ignored her \"yup's, mmhmm, you done?\" While she took out order. When it was time to pay, my husband asked about the military discount- blue hair again seemed extremely annoyed and said she didn't know if she could do that, walked away and went to speak to her \"manager.\" The manager scoffed and replied \" no, we don't do that anymore, since you are using the kids eat free for Sunday's.\" The delivery of the message and the service was terrible. We have used military discount and the Sunday discount on many occasions. It's disappointing that the attitudes of the employees will most likely prevent us from returning.   PRO: the man preparing the food was very friendly   CON: blue hair and manager had TERRIBLE social skills and even worse attitudes."}
{"text":"Bad location but Awesome BBQ meat. Brisket and Pulled Pork was juicy and spoke for themselves. Regular, Sweet, or Spicy BBQ sauce. The sweet was the best. Jalape√±o Beans and mustard potato were okay-nothing special. The bread and sweet tea were sad. The drink is what hits the pockets. One size souvenir cup. 15$ for a 2meat plate w/ drink. The staff were friendly but FYI it was slow. Good eat    Funny story. While cutting the brisket, the gentlemen hulk slammed his fist into the cutting board spooking the lady that was watching him cut. lmao I was confused why he did it? I thought dude had Tourette's- no offense. I asked if he was okay. He explained the meat is extremely hot- It's burning his hand when he holds it while slicing. Ummm you don't have to use your hand to hold it when slicing smh poor dude will learn what a fork is some day."}
{"text":"One of my favorite BBQ joints in Vegas. They have $2 chicken sandwiches on Mondays. Prices are decent and food is excellent."}
{"text":"You would think that with as many \"cowboys\" are in the phoenix area that there would be some great BBQ. I have to say I was very disappointed with the quality of the food. The baked beans were down right horrible. I gave them two stars because of the free soft serve ice cream that you get with every order. :)"}
{"text":"Loved it. The meat is authentic and the free ice cream is amazing. Go there - you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I  do not normally eat bbq out. I lived in South Carolina and know what bbq is suppose to be. But this place has some descent \"q\". I have eaten at the location in Madison, WI and Wheaton, IL., neither disappointed. I prefer the brisket and recommend it. The food is southern inspired as such you must remember that Mac and Cheese is a vegetable in the south. That said I enjoy the okra and green beans. They have good sweet tea which is known as the house wine of the south. They also have a soft serve ice cream machine, although the fresh peach cobbler is missing (at least I miss it). If you are looking for some southern bbq this is very close to it. Enjoy your \"q\", try the sweet tea, get some extra sauce, and don't forget the wet naps."}
{"text":"Wondering why hardly anyone was in this fast food restaurant on a Saturday night. Most of them are at great places like Texas Roadhouse. Why? Value. I spent $48.00 on three little plates of food. The side salad was so small I ate it in 2 bites. Petrified rolls. Come on guys. I could have had steak. Dang it."}
{"text":"I love this place, not only was my meal DELICIOUS I had excellent customer service I believe her name was savannah.. one thing that did throw me off was the way the manager ((older woman long hair)) was addressing her staff. She was yelling and basically growling through her teeth at a nice young blonde girl for the managers mistake, over my receipt. Treat others the way you want to be treated and if you want to run a successful business please for the love of god respect your staff."}
{"text":"First time there. My 90 year old dad went with me. He's a bbq expert. Ribs were day old and dry.  Chicken was dry. Coleslaw was good as were the fried okra. Potatoes casserole was tasteless.  Beans are canned. Won't go there again. People were very nice."}
{"text":"Love to try new places.  So here I am in Vegas staying with friends. Wanted to try something that I can't get back home. Since we have kids to feed plus multiple adults, my friend suggested this place. It is good. And for the very reasonable prices, worth it. We had the family pack with 2 meats (1lb each), 3 sides & 6 rolls for $30. We decided on pulled pork & chopped tri tip. They were both seasoned and smoked very well. It was a little dry for my taste (I like rare) but with the sauce (mild, med or spicy) it was fine. The sides we chose were BBQ beans, green beans w/bacon, & onion strings. The bbq beans were just right (not too sweet) and the bean w/bacon were really good. The onion strings were lightly battered and seasoned just right. Oh, there is a big barrel of very good pickles & free ice cream.  It is not the best BBQ but they are up there based on taste, quality and price."}
{"text":"My family and I enjoy the food here whenever we visit.  But my last visit, a take out order - deserves mention.  When I came in to pickup my order and left, it was not until I got all the way home did I notice that my brisket was missing.  I called the store and Travis immediately apologized and packed up my missing brisket with some bonuses and drove them to me.  I was very thankful.  When customer service and great food meet - it's worth telling your friends.    Instead of leaving a sour taste in my mouth over the error, I'll be coming back, and hope Travis gets some praise for his service."}
{"text":"Ordered for our office meeting. It was ok. But most everyone got expired chips. Seriously?  I know they're most likely still okay, but still unacceptable in my opinion."}
{"text":"The staff is the nicest I've encountered at any of these locations. Polite and friendly and they even crack jokes with you. Customer service is great. Food wise you get what you pay for, no complaints about anything here. GET THE MAC AND CHESSE! It's the best here!"}
{"text":"I like dickey's. Their daily specials are a good deal and will fill you up. Or those with heartier appetites I say 2 meat combo. I always feel soooooo full afterwards. The spicy BBQ sauce is very tasty. Free pickles are yummy and a great appetizer. Top that off with free ice cream and you're good to go. If you're in the neighborhood, stop by. You won't be disappointed. The turkey is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food at cheap prices.  That about sums up this place.  This is the first time I came to a Dickey's outside of Texas and probably the last.  Dickey's in Texas is much better.  In Texas, you can get pretty good barbeque for cheap prices.  Not so in Arizona.    I ordered the beef and cheddar baker (baked potato) with green beens, bbq beans, and peach cobber with ice cream on top.  Well it seems the beef brisket had no taste nor flavor.  They gave a minimal portion of beef as well.  In Texas, I remember getting much bigger portions. The baked potato was so so, greens beans are edible, bbq beans edible, peach cobbler was decent.  I did not get sick or feel bad from eating here so that's a plus."}
{"text":"How awesome, I just drove by dickeys and saw the sign that said now open!! Went in and asked when they opened at the cashier said they just opened today I was customer number two. Makes me happy that I do not have to drive far to get my barbecue fix!! Driving home with my rib platter!! I can't wait to dig in!!"}
{"text":"Dickeys: Home of the micro-tacos, would be a good slogan. I had the street Taco combo, which comes with 4 tacos, a side, and a drink. I got the Mac and Cheese for my side.  The tacos had a disproportionate amount of meat to coleslaw, and the tacos themselves could use about 20% more meat and half of the coleslaw on them. Also, it's a BBQ joint, so even though it's petty, it should go: meat-bbq-slaw; not meat-slaw-bbq. Again, petty, but the BBQ should meet the meat. ;)  The mac and cheese was okay. I mixed it with a half cup of sweet BBQ and it gave it some good zip. My \"beef\" is that it was soupy and nothing my taste buds will crave.  Overall it was good. For $9.95, I can say that I am certainly stuffed. I'm bias to BBQ, so it's difficult to say that any BBQ is bad unless they are trying to make it bad. However, compared to other BBQ in Arizona, and particularly Phoenix, this one narrowly hurdles the bar. There wasn't any wow to the sauce or the meat. It was just good and was a fair value; if there was more meat.  I did -1 for the meat shortage and the par food, and -2 for extra shitty service. The service was intimidating my first time, and when I asked about the ice cream cones being out, the employee said give me a moment; but then helps every customer in the restaurant until I left. It's apparent you only matter up-to the point you pay, then you can go to... Well... Ya know. Not a satisfying experience."}
{"text":"Looks like a new location. Out of town- but been to a few dickies before.  Decent BBQ- had the Pork BBQ sandwich and son had ribs which he really liked."}
{"text":"Pretty standard franchise BBQ joint. The daily specials are the best bang for your buck. It comes with a meat, 2 sides, a roll and a beverage for $10. If your on a budget you might want to skip this place foe your lunch hour but hey, BBQ is more expensive then your run of the mill burger joints. I had the mac and cheese and the BBQ beans. Both tasted great. The pulled pork was tasty with the spicy sauce. Service here was on point and got it out to me in a hurry. All in all a safe pick if your in the area and have a hankering for smoked meat!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Delicious food, excellent service. Dug the free ice cream and pickles.  The employees seemed to care, be excited to be there, and want you to enjoy the experience. Funny thing, they didn't work on tips--and i'm not even sure I saw the pre-requiste tip jar either.   We'll be back for the fall off the bone pork ribs, and spicy bbq sauce!"}
{"text":"I really should give this place a break since it is opening day but with a chain should there really be growing pains? Dickie's is a national chain with tens of stores.. should they be out of pulled pork? Potato Salad? Dirty tables and condiment area? Should the staff be rough around the edges? You know them not having pulled pork is like McDonald's being out of Big Macs!  Eating here lead to more questions then it did answers. Why were the ribs like jerky? Or the beef brisket moist tender and juicy? The food was just all over the place in terms of its preparation. There was a very steady stream of customers who seemed very happy that they were open. Of course I had a cloud above my head and wondered why a chain with so many stores was so off?  Not sure if there will be a repeat visit anytime soon.. perhaps in a few weeks or months they will get it all 'pulled' together? Ouch!"}
{"text":"Tasty BBQ and Good Sweet Tea!  I got a Groupon to eat here so I thought I would try this place out. The staff was extremely friendly, the manager was super nice. The three meat meal was pretty tasty, but the brisket is definitely my favorite.  The fried okra was a delicious side. The store was very clean and there is free ice cream at the end of your meal which is cool.  Stop by and get yourself a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Amazing. First time in and ive never had such good friendly service ever. They helped me out and took care of me. Food was amazing, i loved the mac and cheese and a side. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"While it's not the best barbeque ever, I like the consistency of the chain. I know I'm going to get good BBQ in a clean restaurant, good bbq sauce, free ice cream, and excellent deep fried okra. Some of the other sides aren't spectacular, but they're all decent (except the green beans), and good for when I get a craving for smoked meat. I've been to 4 or 5 locations across the country, and I can say the same for all.  I didn't actually realize this location was here until today, from what the employee said they opened in October. The LV Blvd location is too far for me to go for weekday lunch break, but Spring Valley is perfect.  This location is bigger than the LV Blvd store, and the ice cream machine is easier to use, otherwise it's pretty standard. The ordering location is that weird tall wall like everywhere, not sure why it's so tall, I am 5'5 and can barely see who I'm talking to. When I go with my husband I always make him order for me.  To sum up: Good enough to go again, and a good location. Recommended.  PS, if you plan to be a repeat customer, don't forget to bring along your big yellow cup, drink prices are much cheaper (free sometimes) if you bring your cup."}
{"text":"Well, I was excited to see another BBQ joint move in to the old spot occupied by Hog Heaven and I was confident that Dickey's being a chain would ensure a consistent dining experience.  Sadly, my first time eating here proved mediocre at best.  I ordered the 3 meat combo and chose ribs, chicken and a Polish sausage.  For sides I chose potato salad and BBQ beans.  As it happens, the sides were the best part of the meal - the beans were hot but really just a sugary, run-of-the-mill version of what could be bought in a can; the potato salad was chilled and had a pronounced but tasty dill flavor.  The meats, however, all came out lukewarm and virtually flavorless.  The lone exception was the Polish sausage which tasted peppery but was mushy and gray, not juicy at all.  No one told me there was BBQ sauce available, but after sampling the food I got up and started looking... I found 3 containers of different sauces and that made the meat more palatable.  Still, it's disappointing that the meat had no real inherent flavor of its own.  To round out the meal, a dinner roll was included, but it looked and tasted exactly like raw dough.  Even butter wouldn't have helped make that thing tasty, but not to worry - none was included.  Best part of this meal was the price... Only $12.50 for the combo, which is a bargain.  Unfortunately what I got for the price was less than satisfactory."}
{"text":"This review is for their catering.  We had Dickey's at a park for a wedding celebration and it was delicious! I packed my plate with coleslaw, mac and cheese, roll, pulled pork and sliced brisket with the spicy bbq sauce to top it off. Despite the heat and humidity (dear Lord!), I was surprised the food held up well. We placed them in coolers when there was a break in eating, but as soon as we brought them back out, I was impressed that the food still tasted as fresh as when they came. Mostly impressed that the mac and cheese didn't get clumpy and thick.   First impression was definitely good. We're planning to come in sometime and eat off their regular menu."}
{"text":"As good as Texas! Tasty, tender, treat, with fun western decor. Had the three meat plate, large ribs, baby back and tri tip."}
{"text":"Bullcrap service.  Looking at the menu for like five minutes or so tell the guy it's going to be a while. When I start the order he literally walks away in the middle of my order and the other guy comes up and asked me what I'm ordering.  First time at a dickies so not sure if that's how it's supposed to work but I don't really want to have to repeat my order.  Then I get down to pay and the second guy is ringing me up repeating back my order but he forgets half the things that I have to clarify for a third time if I got the sides that I requested.  And he asked if I want to drink which I had already told him I wanted to order a drink. Then he asked if I want two drinks so I have to clarify that I only want one drink per my request for a drink.  Feels like the worst $35 I spent at a restaurant.  Food taste good but the poor customer service leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  In their defense what do they care if somebody has to repeat themselves they get paid by the hour and probably barely making minimum-wage so maybe I'm the problem here."}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ on the north side of Vegas!  Everyone is always friendly and the atmosphere is chill. Occasional the line gets a little long as they carve your meat selection to order but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I ordered the brisket sandwich and was not disappointed. I didn't think it was anything extraordinary but I ate everything on my plate. The price seemed a bit high for the small sandwich, but I'll definitely be eating here again. I'm a sucker for ice cream and it's free here. I'm currently eating my 3rd cone. Will definitely be coming here again."}
{"text":"Went there again today! It was fantastic. A huge pulled pork sandwich,Baked Beans, Baked Potato Casserole, and soft serve! Portions were generous- I have left overs for dinner! :)"}
{"text":"Very happy to find real BBQ in Ohio!  The brisket is delicious.  Well smoked, and good seasoning.  There are many good sides to choose from, but I especially like the green beans.  There is no better sauce!  Try it, you will like it!"}
{"text":"Just two words to describe this place. ON POINT !!!! The pulled pork is succulent flavor bombs going off in your mouth. The Ribs were delicious. St. Louis Style were worth the drive from west park to Day Drive.  Found a place to come regularly for bBBQ as the price is right."}
{"text":"I have to say, I've tried a lot of beef brisket, at many different places, but the brisket I just ordered from Dickey's was good!! It was perfectly moist, tender, and juicy...it practically melted in my mouth!! I will DEFINITELY order this again!!"}
{"text":"I stumbled into this barbecue joint today and it was actually pretty decent. I've found it next to impossible to find any excellent barbecue in Vegas since Lil' Joe Orduna's Texas BBQ closed years ago, and while this place doesn't even come close to Orduna's, it does an alright job of BBQ at a cheap price.  There was hardly anybody in the restaurant, so I was able to make an order pretty quick with a friendly server at the counter. I had the 2-meat plate with Chopped Beef Brisket and Pulled Pork. For the two sides, I ordered the Waffle Fries and the Mac N'Cheese. It came out as $10.80, which wasn't too bad since the meal filled me up completely.  I was pretty pleased with the meal overall, though the Pulled Pork was definently better than the Beef Brisket...and the Mac N'Cheese was pretty bad. TOO much cheese with really soggy noodles. Next time, I think I'm going to opt for a double order of the waffle fries or maybe some extra tasty rolls :)  I didn't try any of the free soft-serve ice cream on the way out, but I'll be sure to try it next time I swing through Dickey's :)"}
{"text":"I discoved this place at Bite of Las Vegas a couple of years ago and lets just say after trying the pulled pork at Bite I went to the store 3 times in the next 2 weeks.  If you love bbq but don't want to spend a lot this is the place for you.  The pulled pork is insanely delicious especially when you put their coleslaw on top. The ribs are tender and fall off the bone like they should.  The chicken is juicy and has an amazing smoky flavor to it. The ham was even a treat. The only meat I wasn't so impressed with was the brisket, it was a little dry for my taste but with enough sauce its okay. I haven't tried the sausage yet.  The sides they offer are a good range for everyone to find something they like. I adore the coleslaw, the baked potato casserole is yummy and filling, the waffle fries are crispy and even good cold, the green beans have onion and bacon in them-can't go wrong there, the ceasar salad is always crisp and fresh, the mac and cheese is creamy and sooo cheesy and the onion tanglers go great on a sandwich smothered in one of their 3 sauces. I tried the pork and tangler tater and wasn't so sure about it but the flavors came together wonderfully. I'm still trying to get through the whole menu. Oh, and don't forget the free \"ice cream\" on your way out, its soothing after stuffing your gut."}
{"text":"I discovered Dicky's Barbeque Pit today and was greeted by the smell of BBQ as soon as I jumped out of my car. As I was the only customer when I walked in I was unsure of how good it would be but I'm always up for trying a new place, especially for BBQ.    I ordered a 3 meat plate and a 2 meat plate with pulled pork, beef brisket, chicken breast and BBQ honey ham. The sides were coleslaw, barbeque beans and potato salad. It also came with rolls, onions, pickles and BBQ sauce.   My boyfriend and I really enjoyed it. The meat was flavorful and tender. The beans were spicy and delicious. Coleslaw was reminiscent of KFC but the boyfriend liked it. I wasn't fond of the potato salad, it tasted like it had dill in it, it was just OK.  The employees were also very nice. Patient with my indecision, which is a plus since everything looked and smelled so good. Lol   I'd say we got our money's worth and we will definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Not too impress...but it was my first time going and i got the deal of the day...pulled pork sandwich and two side's bbq bean's and salad...sides are way two small"}
{"text":"I travel all over in my job and as often as I can I try the BBQ.  I had the opportunity to try this restaurant.  I passed by it three days before deciding  to give it a try, it appeared to be a small hole in the wall place.  Sometimes they are the best.  As it turned out this is a chain.  I tryed to order a slab of ribs, which was a waste of item the order taker kept saying we don't sell them by the slab we sell them by the pound.  asked for two pounds and guess what I got a slab, what a surprise.   On to the ribs, they were very tough and chewy.  They needed to spend at the very least two or three hours more in the smoker.  The sauces were tasty but you cannot make up for bad meat.    They also have a large pickle jar loaded with dill pickles, another mistake they were soft and warm.  I may give dickeys another chance but not at this restaurant.  I expect to be in San Jose in July and I understand they are opening a place there.  If I go I will write a followup."}
{"text":"We just had the best experience! We have a large number of family members in and I had a very big order. A couple of items were missing from my order, but they corrected it immediately and were so gracious about it. We love this barbecue! Great customer service! We will be back."}
{"text":"This is nothing more than over priced bareque fast food. The meat was alright and it was obviously pre made, the sides are actually pretty good would recommend the onion tanglers! Overall is not worth the price, probably won't be back!"}
{"text":"Pure garbage. This is BBQ for those who've never had decent BBQ. The sauces are bland, the meats are mediocre, at best, and the sides lack flavor and character."}
{"text":"Sooooo good, that I had to add them on yelp and write this!!!! Hubby and I just got back from Texas and we were missing the BBQ, and by coincidence this was right by the house so we decided to come in. Holy cow! Everything was delicious. We ordered their brisket and it was soft and most, and super flavorful! All three of their sauces were over the top and their sides were great! I better start hitting the gym because I'll be here too often!!! :P"}
{"text":"We frequent here for lunch. Food is great. Staff is great. Clean. Can't beat the deal of the day and free soft serve ice cream."}
{"text":"Ordered to go,  they didn't have the sauce out for customers to serve themselves.  Cashier said she would give me some. Got home..... no sauce!  Food is good."}
{"text":"Good BBQ!!  I really like this place a lot! Couple reason why... The food first of all is outstanding!! I little bit on the pricey side, but I am always full when I leave this place! Second of all... They have complimentary pickles and soft service ice cream!!   The atmosphere here is really cool. A lot of the decor is of old vintage western types. The photos on the walls are clearly vintage western.   Right when you walk into this place your sense of smell is going to get the best of you... You will not be able to wait to order your food, with such a delicious sent attacking you!!  They just started doing this points program where you enter your phone number and for every dollar you spend you get a point. When you rack up 80 point you get a free meal. Kind of cool I think!  When I come here I usually get what they call the 2 meat plate... I get it with the spicy cheedar sausage and chopped beef brisket. You also get a choice of two sides. I like the baked-potatoe cassorole and the mac and cheese. The meal comes out to about $10.  I would really recommend the Spicy BBQ sauce they have! Very Good!!  I wish they had more locations throughout the valley :("}
{"text":"Walk in the door and up to the counter and the friendly guy on the other side handling a knife says with a knowing eye, \"you want the brisket.\"  How did he know?  Yes, two meat plate.  You could select another type of meat but I go for a double brisket.  With an approving smile he commences to start slicing away.  \"How's that?\" he asks.  The counter is tall so I step forward and peer over.  \"Looks good\" I say.  Next comes the sides (2).  He presses his prediction luck - \"mac & cheese\".  \"Nope, give me the waffle fries and BBQ beans.\"  \"Got it.\"  Move on around to the right of the counter where you order and you'll find the drinks and BBQ sauces.  The sauces are in these warming kettles and it's \"help yourself\".  Good stuff.  There's a window counter next to the soda machine where you pay and pick up your order.  If you're staying to eat, there's a couple of rows of tables behind you leading back to the front door.   The brisket was tender without being fatty.  The warm BBQ sauce was tasty and supported the protein. The beans and fries were beans and fries.  The plate comes with this delicious buttered roll.  It's a thick textured bread that satisfies and complements everything else.   The place is clean and smells like good cookin'."}
{"text":"Solid 4, used to rate beyond the 5 stars and shoot for a 10. First, my last visit was today and my order was messed up, but quickly fixed. The place was a bit of a mess, especially around the ice cream machine. My trip, a couple weeks ago, was a great one though. I went to lunch with my little girl and we finished up our meal, and wrapped it up. Decided on a quick trip to the lady's room and came back to find our table cleaned up, including our to go bags and drinks. I went up to the cashier and let them know and she said \"oh, must have gotten trashed.\" My heart sank, no leftovers... She verified with the cook, and he admitted to throwing our to go bag away. Then they did the unexpected, they offered to remake everything! Down to the sweet tea, we got an entire meal to go!   No onto the 4 stars: the price has shot up, and unless it's a Sunday (kids eat free), it is very costly! Pickles are gone (dunno about you, but I looooved dem pickles!) this used to be my weekend stop, not it's very few weeks as the cost is too much, so I just make my own. Other than that, I will choose this place over more popular places in my area (Lucille's, Memphis, and Famous Dave's)."}
{"text":"You've missed breakfast, you're busy all morning going from place to place, you're about to miss lunch, as a matter of fact your feeling a bit light headed, and as you're driving down Shea Blvd. you see Dickey's Barbecue Pit.  Ya think, I've gotta stop or I'm going to pass out at the wheel.  Good idea?  Let's see.  Look's ok from the outside.  Walking in I realize the place is appropriately named.  Seems a bit dirty; a table of construction workers sit in one side of the pit while a lone businessman sits on the other.  It's lunchtime right?  I go to the counter where a man and a woman employee are talking.  I wait and wait...I don't want to be rude, I know they see me, I think they understand that I'm a potential customer.  Already I'm getting this feeling that I'm interrupting something, but hey I'm starving, how bad can it be.  REAL BAD!  The meat was cold, the mac cheese was gross, and the fried okra was actually good, explains why the plate was full of it.  I ate the cold meat, and as much okra as I could without feeling stuffed, there was a good serving left on the plate.  I merely touched the mac whatever it was, I later felt sick from that mere touch and now I'm still having nightmares about it.  Without a doubt it was the worst meal I've ever had, and I've had many, many bad ones.  Definite waste of eleven bucks, I don't see me going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"This review is more about service and business operations, than it is about food quality.  So let's start with the positive- the food. Pulled Pork and brisket - the food is good quality. The price is actually comparable to the quality- no complaints about the food. Which is why this is a 3 star and not a 1 star review.  This is a busy location, I get it.. As I've mentioned in several of my reviews: I don't mind a wait - for good quality food. Today Dickies dropped the ball - as I waited in line for 45minutes to place my order (there were only 2 others in line before me)  The person working the meat station was on top of it, cordial and preparing the initial order as the front of the line workers got the orders out.  The FRONT of the line is where the problem was. Several people walked in to pick up phone orders, which either were not ready, or could not be found at all.. After 20 minutes, one of the people in line before me had STILL not been asked what sides they wanted( their meat had been sitting on the line the whole time) they finally walked out. Instead of noticing this, the front line staff proceeded to pack up the WRONG order and have it to the next person who walked in for a call I. Order.. Not realizing this until both customers had left.  After another 20 minutes, the person directly in front of me was STILL waiting to have THEIR side order taken, as THEIR meat choices sat on the line getting cold.  The front line staff (3 of them) were either very new, or simply unable to multi task.. And this was with 3 people in line...  I finally left myself, as I waited ANOTHER 5minutes and could see they were not going to be able to get an order out fresh, hot, or correctly. I understand things happen , what perplexes me is: I did not see ONE person who was managing the obvious failure of the business model!! WHERE was management??? Epic fail, Dickies."}
{"text":"This place is small and tucked away, but it has a nice mom-and-pop ambience.  We really enjoyed the pulled pork and side dishes, which were a delicious representation of down-home, country style comfort food.  The service at the counter was average, but that was overshadowed by the owner who was very friendly and accommodating.  Overall, it was what we expect from a casual restaurant -- a nice dinner in a relaxing, stress-free environment."}
{"text":"It's BBQ. ... decent BBQ.     Sunday is kids eat free so that's always nice. I got the one meat combo,pulled pork, fried okra , potato salad.  The potato salad was very bland, I added a ton of pepper and it still didn't help. The pulled pork was good, three different sauces you can try I kind of went back and forth between the original and the sweet.   The sweet tea is delicious and you get ice cream! I'd come again but I've had better BBQ  it's about 10 dollars a plate and up."}
{"text":"Not surprised by the mediocre ratings. We called in a to-go order tonight and the girl who answered seemed like I was inconveniencing her and sighed the whole time we were on the phone. When I finished our order and asked what time it would be ready, she said \"We can have it ready whenever you want so when can you get here?\" I live maybe 3.5 minutes away and I didn't think they would have it ready by then and she finally said 20 minutes. We got there and I have to say, the guy who was actually preparing the orders greeted us and was ready to take our order but I told him we were picking up an order and he said \"Oh yeah, for Jessica?\" He finished packing it and we walked up to the counter and were greeted by the same phone girl who said \"Yes?\" as we approached her. I would have started with a \"How can I help you?\" or something similar. The food wasn't bad at all but I just felt like every interaction I had with this girl was an inconvenience to her. There was a mix-up with our meats. Unfortunately I didn't notice this until we got home and we just shared and remedied it ourselves.  I can only speak for the food I ate, which was the chopped brisket, polish sausage, Mac and cheese, and the blondie. It was all really good. Another gripe is that I got a slice of pie for my Mom and instead of putting it into some sort of container they just wrapped it in Saran Wrap and stuck it in the bag.  I'll have to give them a second chance because the food was awesome, but I was definitely disappointed in my experience with the service today."}
{"text":"Good BBQ, fair price for the portions, and great management. Chicken breast is always a go to and their brisket is excellent."}
{"text":"Now, I have had Dickeys before, but nothing as terrible as this place. The meat was cold, almost rubbery and was really really dry. The sauce tastes like it was something my sister could create with an easy bake oven and she is 3, I'm not sure if it was just because all of my food tastes cold and old or if each store does something differently. All I know is that I could say I've never had worse bbq before in my life. Seriously the only thing that is a saving grace is the amazing cupcake I had next door after the atrocious monstrosity of spending my money on that bbq."}
{"text":"Food tastes good, but service is all over the place. The last 4 times I have gone I ask them to chop the brisket, EVERY time they have served it to me in big lumpy chunks. I like the way it tastes chopped, the juices mix together so much better. Today I repeated 3 times at the drive thru, chopped, \"I would like the beef brisket chopped, chopped, did you note that I want it chopped?\" (I said it politely btw), about 11 seconds later I heard a careless \"yeah\" from the employee. Drove out and checked, of course, 4 lumpy logs of meat. The brisket was cold to lukewarm, and it was cold like this the last 2 visits, this location sucks. When I go to the Scottsdale and Tempe location, they never F%# up like this place. Also, the last 2 times they didn't give me any utensils or napkins or bbq sauce. At first I noticed the service was poor, but I thought they are a new store, give them a chance to improve, that was months ago, the store attitude and cuatomer care still blows. I work so close to this location, but will now begin to avoid this place unless they improve. I used to love Dickey's, but lately with the cold temperature meats and apathetic employees, they will be getting a hella of a lot less money from me. I was going to cater a huge party at my work for 700+ employees, through out the day for a December potluck, but after tonight, I've changed my mind about Dickey's. Hope a Mgr is reading this. You just lost a huge order. We do quarterly events like this and I'm in charge of arranging the details. Hope they improve. Until then, will be scouting out new bbq eateries instead."}
{"text":"pretty good BBQ for vegas. Lunch portions were fair. BBQ pork sandwich came on nice soft bun. side of fried okra was nicely cooked and crispy. side of Mac n cheese was very cheesy. too much and too heavy for lunch probably would order less next time. give it a try."}
{"text":"I will give 2 stars because food and value are good. The service was a mess. You now order at a wall that makes no sense and then food sits and gets cold while making others and waiting to be rung up after. I think the old numbers and bring it out as great so unsure of why changed. The lady on the register was making food and touching the register and credit card. That is not acceptable. I have eaten here too many times to list and use to always be perfect. Hope you can work this out!"}
{"text":"Pretty Good for the price. They got our order wrong but quickly fixed it. The free ice cream doesn't hurt either!"}
{"text":"The food is only okay but it's way overpriced for what it is. Would much rather go to pork on a fork or little miss BBQ and pay similar prices for better food. 2 stars because of the decor and atmosphere . I won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Went there to get to go order. I think that they were about to close. Greeted warmly by the cook. When I ordered the ribs another employee says to the cook, \"there goes my dinner\". Evidently he had planned to have them for himself. The cook had already saved him some. Why did I need to hear that? The owner and another employee stood right behind me talking loudly while I waited for my food. I didn't need to hear about their aching muscles. Good ribs but not very professional staff."}
{"text":"Good food!! Maybe not the greatest I've ever noshed on, but better than a few BBQ places we have in town, which is unfortunately VERY few. I'd still say *sigh* Famous Dave's is a wee bit better."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch today, great service with great food. I had the smoked sausage and sliced brisket with Mac and cheese and fried okra. Great meal for a good price! The sweet bbq sauce is the best!"}
{"text":"Excellent customer service and generous portions. This is one of best of all the dickeys bbq locations."}
{"text":"This place is too expensive for the portions they give you and the food is mediocre at best. I paid 16 dollars for a tiny pulled pork sandwhich and two super small sides. For that price I could go to a decent restaurant."}
{"text":"I love around the corner and decided to try the new BBQ place out . I love love moist brisket . When I came in I asked to see a piece of the moist brisket and the first thing I noticed that is the counter person just pulled it out  off the of counter and wrapped in the clear plastic wrap normally it's keep somewhere warm or steamed I looked past it . Ordered half a pound I asked for it moist and not trimmed . I go to try it out it wasn't up to par at all it was moist but not like it was cooked moist it was like it was cooked dry and juice was added to it for the moistness . Not much of the soft and tender brisket I'm used to . Not much smokey taste to it either . I guess I'll have to stick to Rudys or little miss BBQ from now on . Too bad it's so close to me :(    Not sure how to msg you ur welcome to email me imphoking@gmail.com"}
{"text":"If you happen to be around Parma and are craving some BBQ and don't have any major league options, I'd recommend coming to Dickie's. Apparently this is a chain but I have never heard of it before and since I'm up for anything I decided to give fast food BBQ a shot (honestly I found a coupon in the mail and that lured me in). The staff was welcoming and patient with answering all of our questions about the menu. I settled on the 3 meat plate with beef brisket, pulled pork, and spicy cheddar sausage. It comes with 2 sides and a piece of cornbread for an upgrade. I added an extra side and ended up with: coleslaw, baked beans, and baked potato casserole. My dining companion got the chicken and turkey breast with potato salad, mac & cheese, and the jalape√±o Beans.   So since this is fast food you have to lower your BBQ standards, but I would still say the food was good for what it was. The meat is slightly dry, but you do have 3 sauces to choose from (basically just regular sauce with one a little spicier and one a little sweeter), and I did enjoy the kick from the spicy cheddar sausage. I liked the cornbread and actually asked for a second one. The sides were decent, the only one I did not like was the baked potato casserole; I'm pretty sure it was instant potato that had been sitting so long in the warmer that it turned brown and tasted like sadness. I threw it away. My companion did not like the potato salad because it had dill in it, but i thought it was good. I don't drink pop so I got a water with my meal and they gave me a tiny baby cup. I'm not sure why it is thought that those who drink water don't need as much liquid as those who drink pop, but if the reasoning is based on price of a plastic cup then I am more than willing to pay the .15¬¢ for it.   To sum things up, the food is decent and you do get free vanilla soft serve if you want. We spent about $28 for 5 meats and 6 sides and had plenty for leftovers. Just a word of caution though, get your food to-go as there are a lot of gnats inside and we just ended up packing our food up and leaving."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review. They went from mediocre to bad, 4 guys at 12noon standing around doing nothing they could care less about the customer. Pulled pork and Brisket were of low quality. Hardly anybody in there but some police detectives looking for a freebie. I believe that's where they hang out.  It's not worth eating at Dickies even for free. Don't go!"}
{"text":"I tried them out because of a Groupon, I met several family members there we had a total of 3 Groupons.  The place was dead, only one other family was there, went on a Saturday afternoon (4 ish).  Customer service does not exists here, we were not greeted at all, the cashier was to busy texting to even look at you. We got brisket, chicken and pulled pork.  The chicken and brisket were good, the pork dry.  I question  if they actually cook onsite as all the meat was pulled out of a warmer and was wrapped in plastic.  The potato salad is disgusting, more like mashed potatoes they threw some left over stuff into.  The waffle fries were pretty good, happened to be fresh which was a plus.  Would not be in my top 5 places to go for BBQ."}
{"text":"I have two free meals here and can't seem to bring myself to going.   Anyone want to try it risk free? Pm me and I will arrange the details."}
{"text":"Better then I had at Norterra.  Friday special is pulled pork plate for 9.00. 6oz of pork, 2 sides and a roll plus a drink.   I had Mac n cheese and waffle fries. The mac was ok the fries were really good.   The pork was well trimmed, no fat ( I like a little) but most do not. Good smoke, NOT to dry NOT too wet.  Sauce was good after I combined sweet and hot.   Service was good but none else was there ordering when I was. Did not have to repeat my order at all.   I like the decor here too."}
{"text":"Four stars for fast food that doesn't taste like fast food. Very clean. Kid/family friendly. Great chicken BBQ, brisket and sausage. Slaw and waffle fries good also. A bit expensive. I will return."}
{"text":"Picked up the XL Platter last night, good value and good food.  Only disappointment, it was 6:00 on a Friday night and they were already out of jalapeno cheese sausage, pulled pork and almost out of chicken."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! Go!!!! The meat is SO flavorful. The brisket is ahhhmazing. For someone watching their weight or on a strict diet, I totally recommend the chicken Caesar salad-- which I ate WITHOUT the dressing because the chicken was so flavorful. The management was very friendly and helpful. Honestly, just walk into this place and smell how delicious BBQ should be."}
{"text":"This place is a joke! The food is disgusting!  Instead of getting fries you get potatoes crumbs. The brisket was dry and hard.  The worst BBQ I ever had."}
{"text":"Pretty mediocre.   Barbecue sauce was fair.  It's better out of a bottle.   Meat was fair too.  Mac n cheese was nasty.   You can easily find better food.  And it was free for me too (someone else brought to into office)."}
{"text":"Having Celiac it's really hard finding a good Barbecue place that I can actually eat at. The fist time going I was immediately greeted with a smile and with the help of the staff I was able to find a meal that is definitely worth the price and the service."}
{"text":"This was absolutely the worst dining experience we've had in a long time.  I am praying we don't all get sick. Where to begin? They were out of: Pulled pork (at a bbq restaurant?) Ham Turkey Sausage Bbq beans Pickles Silverware The food we did receive was cold.  The place was dirty and disgusting. The sauce station hasn't been cleaned in who knows how long. Wrappers all over the floor. The bathroom was worse than most gas stations. The workers could not care less that the place was a wreck. I wish I could give zero stars. Do NOT go to this restaurant. Please God don't let us all get sick tonight. ***Edited to add:  I am a long time Yelp reader but never post (just not my thing) I actually CREATED an account tonight because this was so bad.  I have a duty to warn people.  We should've just left.  Why oh why didn't we?  Oh and the bathroom also smelled of cigarette smoke.  And previous reviewer was right on about the sinks not working etc.  What a DUMP."}
{"text":"This is by far the best barbecue restaurant in town! I love their smoked barbecue. Its definitely worth your money! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Texas going to the original Dickey's. This location has food just as good as any I've had back home. My family and I especially liked the sliced brisket. The service was great too. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Dickey's is my go-to at Dallas Luv Field. I am vegan, so you'd think I'd never go to a  bar-b-que joint, but at Dickey's I get a large baked potato with some chives and a side of green beans. Sometimes I add jalape√±os. It's a great meal on the go and it's always delicious! And the potato is so big, it fills me up."}
{"text":"So Dickey's is OK, but thats about all. It's not a full fledged BBQ restaurant, but rather a BBQ restaurant crossed with a fast food place. Your order at the desk, then pickup when called, so expect fast food service and quality. It wasn't bad. No complaints here, just know what you're getting. Simple, OK and cheap."}
{"text":"Yum!!!!! The portions are great for the price, the food is INSANELY delicious, the people are super nice and helpful! The meats are all smoked in house and they're so perfectly juicy- even the chicken breast! I got a three meat plate with pulled pork, chicken, and brisket. It was amazing. Can't wait to come back. Thank you guys for a great dinner with no fuss."}
{"text":"The food was really good. The menu at the entrance when you first walk in makes it hard for entering, leaving and those trying to figure out what to eat when first get in. I will go back for another round."}
{"text":"The Texas Frito Pie was amazing as usual; this time kicked up with pickled jalape√±os!!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place and the employees are awsome!!! The manager pays attention to details and the food is GREAT! !!"}
{"text":"I have no complaints on this pretty good BBQ franchise. I have been to many Dickey's establishments in my time and never leave disappointed. Could the price point be a little lower? Yes. Could some of the food come out a little quicker? Yes. But Dickey's BBQ is certainly a restaurant my family would visit again and probably again, oh and again. We are fans of the brisket and pulled pork, the rolls, and well mostly everything else. Good eats."}
{"text":"Just back to South after 25 years in NYC and was eager for some \"Q\".  Just visited this spot near my home and was happy to see the \"we speak BBQ\" sign on the door!  Went to the counter and ordered a CHOPPED OUTSIDE sandwich.  Kid behind the counter looked at me like I was speaking Yiddish!  I spoke slowly - I -  WOULD - LIKE - THE - DARK - CHARRED - OUTSIDE - MEAT.  Still a blank stare.  OK - i pointed and said - how about one of those sandwiches.  Meat was good quality although a bit soft as though it had been steamed.  Needless to say \"no bark\" but the sauces were very good.  Based on meat quality I \"may\" go back and give them one more try.  But Dickey's, PLEASE take the sign off the door!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was good! Fast service, the workers are courteous and made suggestions. The kids meals were free with our purchase. We will definitely be back since it is so close to our house!!!!"}
{"text":"Best food in Vegas! Service is great, we had a sampler for the whole family and couldn't even get through half of it! We took boxes home and will feast again tomorrow."}
{"text":"Love the meats here! All of the smoked BBQ is great and I love their sauces. Sides are good and cups can be taken home for reuse! Parking is slim for the lunch rush... Free ice cream!"}
{"text":"Delicious! And the staff was nice.  I love the sauce on the food and can't seem to get enough of it. Smells GREAT! I had the beef brisket. I hope it was that... not that I think about. I can't recall exactly what the meat was. The bread was really good for some reason. Better than I would have expected. So the place is not bad. I haven't decided if I like Tom's BBQ's sauce better or not yet.  Plan on coming again to try some more variety of food."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service.  Went with 4 other people and we sampled a number of things from the menu from the brisket to the green beans -- all good.    The free ice cream is a nice touch.  It especially helps cool the mouth down after you've been inhaling some of their hot sauces."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure why there are bad reviews at this place. My wife and I have been going here for quite some time now. Service has always been great. The food is really good as well. We pretty much get the brisket every time, not because anything else is bad, just that the brisket is so good. I like that we were asked if we wanted any fat. Brisket typically has fat, I prefer it, however my wife does not, so they accomedated us without us even asking. We have never experienced bad customer service, they have always been polite and friendly."}
{"text":"Dinner here was disappointing. As I type this, I'm burping up what tastes like I ate an entire bottle of Bacon Bits.   Ordered the Smokehouse Salad, which only *looks* good in person. It was served to me on a baking pan along with a small, stale bread roll. The salad had an incredibly rich and heavy flavor. Romaine lettuce -- much of which was wilted -- was topped with chopped brisket, which reminded me of overcooked corned beef. There were layers of ranch dressing, shredded cheese, and fried onion tangles to top it off. I couldn't bear to finish the whole thing.  My boyfriend ordered the two-meat combo that comes with two sides and no beverage. I feel like this shouldn't be called a combo if a beverage isn't included, but what the hell do I know? He selected the pulled pork, chicken, beans, and caesar salad. I tried the pork, which was bland; the sliced chicken was also flavorless. Dip these into some BBQ sauce and it's all too sweet. A bread roll also came with the order, and that was stale as well.   The upside: Service was quick and there are free drink refills.   Food is mediocre. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Woooo, doggies buckaroos and buckarettes!  Texas barbecue is back in Scottsdale.  With the closing of El Paso Barbecue (Damn the economy!) I've been jonesing for some good ol' TexBBQ.  How is TexBBQ different than others?  Mainly, we ain't much for puttin' rubs on the meat.  Salt 'n' pepper the stuff and slap it on the pit; smoke it and eat it.    Anywho, I was sittin' here at the house and in walks the BF with two bags of Dickie's To Go.  Pulled pork.  Smoked turkey.  Macshells und cheeze.  And holy of all holys, fried okra.    The pulled pork was just right.  Not overly smokey.  No fat in sight.  Not pre-sauced.  Hog heaven folks, hog heaven.    The smoked turkey, though, needs help.  Its juicy consistency was on the \"sliced deli\" side of the spectrum.  And it just plain wasn't smoky enough.  Real smoked turkey is smokey, smokey and not a whole helluva lotta moisture.  Reload and fire again, Dickies boys.  Macshells und cheez was a little creamier than I liked it, and needed more cheeze but a tidge of salt cured what ailed it.    I liked the fried okra and am grateful for a source for it.  With fried okra there's no gray area.  You either like/love it or you hate it.  I love it.  (My Momma's fried okra is coated in cornmeal, salt 'n' peppered; and the cornmeal splits and some of it chars and the rest is brown as a berry.  Folks, it's like eatin' popcorn!  I'll stop there.  I'm makin' myself miserable.  Momma and Momma's fried okra are back in Texas.).  Anywho, Dickie's version needs a dash of salt just after it's taken outta the fryer.  For a treat, kiddies, sprinkle some parmesan cheese over your fried okra.  Yeah, I know puttin' parmesan on it is like puttin' a tux on a frog, but everything needs to go steppin' out up every once in awhile.   And Mr. Clark, I'm givin' Dickie's a solid three stars.  It's gotta good beat and it's easy to dance to.  Check it out and chow down."}
{"text":"Good food, but the sandwiches are a little small for the price. We have used the catering services for work and yet was a big hit! Can't go wrong with free ice cream: my tip- make a float to eat with your dinner!!"}
{"text":"The food is OUTSTANDING which is the only reason I gave them 3 stars. The service was terrible. The guy taking our order asked us what we wanted and then started talking to a coworker. He completely misheard our order. When I corrected him, he said, \"I know.\" Uh then why did he put the wrong meat on our plates?! The food was slow to come out and our kids didn't even get their rolls. There were no cups for the sauce. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"The food was great, but the customer service was not at all friendly. It's really hard to enjoy a meal after one of the workers is constantly giving irritating glances and orders to his coworker."}
{"text":"We ate there on Saturday. We had a wonderful greeting from the employees and had a fantastic meal. I will definitely go there over and over. I have to give kudos to the staff.  Way to go with the excellent customer service!"}
{"text":"First, I would like to state this is a long read, however due to the absolutely worst and completely lack of service I had to be very clear just how inexcusable BAD this experience was.  My girlfriend and I went in to the store around 230pm for a late lunch on Saturday.  First, there was no one in the dining inside the store.  A young African American girl was at the far end of the cook/prep area and said she would be right with us.  We waited for about 5 minutes while my girlfriend saw her struggljng am attempting to open #10 can of product.  She finally comes up to counter and asks if we will dining in or take out.  I said it will be take out, she then replied \"thats good.\"  Next my girlfriend ordered the classic brisket sandwich special of the day and mentioned she received an email for a free birthday sandwich.  The girl replied stating \"well your coupon is good until the 13th so you have time to use it.\"  My girlfriend said we will not be back before then.    Next the Dickeys girl said \"well that coupon is just for the sandwich and doesn't include sides.\"  My girlfriend  said she understood and why couldnt she just order sides?  The Dickeys girl said with an argumentative tone in her voice \"but the coupon doesnt come with sides.\"  My girlfriend said I understand, but why can't I order sides?  As the Dickeys girl was prepping the brisket for the sandwich, she had a grumpy look and then my girlfriend told her to nevermind the sides and it would only be the sandwich.  As we stood there waiting, the girl started to aggressively chop the brisket, several pieces of meat came flying over the service order counter and pieces landed on both my girlfriend and me.  We were standing about a foot away from the ordering counter.  After this my girlfriend and I looked at each other and then walked out.  I turned and said \"no thanks, nevermind\" as we walked out the door and went somewhere else for lunch.  This was the absolutely the worst experience possible, especially at this location."}
{"text":"Was worried when I read some of the comments. I went their Friday night at 7pm. But I liked it. Pork was good and moist. Chopped brisket was tasty. Beans had a little spice. Southern style potato salad with a little lemon taste and firm not mushy potatoes. The Mac and cheese had a runny cheese, which I don't care for but the taste was good, my son killed the Mac and cheese. Bread was warm and tasty. We will go back. Must try everything. Free soft serve ice cream cone. As for the service, I ordered they bagged I paid and left, was pretty simple."}
{"text":"I love their BBQ. But, after multiple visits, they are really lacking in customer service. Picked up take out and got back and discovered- NO BBQ sauce. How can you forget that? So, had to return. They offered no apology and made me get my own spicy sauce!  Maybe understaffed but come on?!?!"}
{"text":"I just moved from AZ to San Francisco and there's no real BBQ restaurants really over there so I was exciting to visit home and get some good BBQ and Dickeys BBQ did not disappoint! I ended up craving more all night long! Definitely want more before I go back to San Francisco!!"}
{"text":"Lindsey was very nice and attentive! We tried the picnic pack..was enough for 3people.food was okay! Bread really dry.we try brisket and pulled pork.meat was dry..."}
{"text":"Not really sure how to rate this place. I mean its ok but I have had better. Maybe its because I have gone close to closing each time and I am getting what is left but hey it is what it is. The polish sausage was good as well and the bread was nice and warm. Oh and they do give you free ice cream. You will have to judge for yourself on this one.  Its not my favorite bbq place as the portions are kinda small and its just lacking a certain something that I can't quite put my finger on."}
{"text":"I have been here about 4 times.  I always get the rack of ribs.  This time when i got them they were soggy for some reason.  I'm not sure what happened but it was definitely sub par.  The people here are always friendly and work hard.  Unfortunately,  the product wasn't up to normal standards this time.  I will think twice about returning as it is $28 for just a rack of ribs and if they are not upto par it won't be my first choice anymore.   :("}
{"text":"How is this spot rated so high? I always check yelp before I even walk into a place, so when I seen this had 4 stars I jus had to try it ! Worst barbecue spot I've tasted yet! Meat was cold like it was sitting for hours cold fries . Jus bad never again. I really want my money back :!"}
{"text":"Dickies was as good as it gets...Brendon made it that way. Hannah was there too, cleaning every little thing and making sure I had what I needed. Brendon gave me the menu, explained what meats met my dietary preferences, had me taste the cole slaw, and made sure my experience was perfect. Yes, the brisket and the chopped pork were exceptional. But, when the service is \"this good\", the food follows. Kudos to the wonderful staff at Dickies. I went back, btw, and the manager was there. He and his assistant were also wonderful. I hope the owner knows that he has the knack for finding the kindest and most accommodating staff in town!!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! That is until a customer verbally acosted me and no one said a peep. Wonderful food and experience ruined. Was one of my husband and I's fav. Will not return. At least not alone.  Very unfortunate. Lucille's just down the road best bet! They're really good. Too bad.    Update!!  They reached out to me and made it right!  This place is the best!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is trash. All of the food is trash. The atmosphere is trash . The employees are rude and not helpful at all. Don't go here!"}
{"text":"They don't pull the chewy skin off the back of the ribs.  Made them a little tough.  Jalape√±o beans and fried okra were good.  Just not impressed this time."}
{"text":"I like Dickies sauce  and meat as always but that is the only positive feedback to offer about this location.  The place is dirty. I witnessed the tea container being refilled and it had obviously not encountered soap and water in a very long time.  The table was sticky. What was that?  They obviously have sewage issues because the odor literally took my breath before I even got into the restroom.  Just Say No!"}
{"text":"Its BBQ fast food, not the best, but not the worst either. If your wanting a switch from burgers & fries its a good change, plus kids under 12 eat free on Sat/Sun. The soft serve frozen uh, ice milk translucent looking stuff was kind of scary, but my 2 year old enjoyed it. The yellow take home cups were cool though."}
{"text":"Mediocre, overpriced BBQ for premium prices.  Had a three-meat plate, consisting of pork ribs (note the plural was listed on the menu), pulled pork and kielbasa.  There was ONE rib, a tiny smattering of pulled pork, and a few thin slices of sausage.  For $15.95, one would expect a lot more meat.  Significantly more.  And the meat was nothing to write home about, the pulled pork was cold.  At least the location was clean."}
{"text":"I couldn't decide what I wanted for dinner today, as usual, and this place popped in my head so I thought I would check it out.  Wow was I impressed.  I got the special plate, which today was the big beef brisket sandwich.  For my sides I got barbecued beans and slaw.  The slaw was your standard slaw but the beans were just amazing.  They had a small amount of heat which was perfect.  I got a small side of sauce for free which I put on my brisket sandwich.  That sauce is incredible!  So complex and it has some heat too.  The brisket was perfect.  Tender, juicy, I was in BBQ heaven.  I need to go back and try everything on the menu.  Also, make sure you eat in.  They have free ice cream there so that's perfect after your meal.  Don't forget about that.  The entire staff was exceptional.  They were nice, helpful and informative.  I'm for sure going back here."}
{"text":"This barbecue restaurants fantastic. My family met the owner who also owns the cold stone next door! The gentleman was fantastic their service is great and food delicious. If your in the mood for BBQ this place doesn't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Solid 3 stars.  This is my first time at Dickie's and I might not be a repeat customer.  It was $9.50 for the manager's special of a pulled pork sandwich, two sides and a drink.  The special was basically a free drink.    I could have used more meat on my sandwich.  I felt like they proportion of bread to meat was on the low side.  That being said, the meat was good. Not overly greasy and decent flavor.    Now the sides.  Mixed reviews here.  I ordered the mac and cheese and green beans with bacon.  The green beans were fantastic.  They were a little watery but the flavor was so delicious.  They were seasoned and cooked well.  I could have eaten a whole other side.  Yum.  Unfortunately, the mac and cheese was awful.  It was no better than the noodles you get in a frozen dinner.    You do get free ice cream, so for kids this is a great place to eat.  The barbecue sauce set up is awful!  There are only three tubs, each holding a different kind of sauce, set-up between the soda and ice cream in the main thoroughfare.  Wow, poor planning.    The original sauce is perfect.  The sweet barbecue is good but definitely sweet.  And unfortunately with short people problems, I could not read the spicy sauce to try it otu."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere very friendly people customer service was excellent. Not to mention the pricing was very affordable for the amount of food. Baked potato casserole is a must have for your side."}
{"text":"The wife and I like to eat at Dickey's BBQ every time we come to Vegas.  For the price and the amount of food you get, you really can't beat it.  Are there better BBQ place, yes, but you definitely will have to pay a lot more.  I would say they need to improve their side items."}
{"text":"First time here, and I'd probably say my last, if you need a bbq fix, it will do, but it's nothing that will knock your socks off. I had the big bbq sandwich mad and cheese and a salad. All of which were ok, nothing that was over the top delicious. I'd agree with another reviewer, the meat to bread ratio was off and the meat was barely warm. It was fairly tender. Price range was acceptable but the staff was very friendly and helpful with any questions. The sauces were ok, nothing compared to Kansas City, St. Louis, Memphis or any other bbq joint down south. Overall not a bad place for lunch, but don't expect the best bbq in your life."}
{"text":"Solid Texas style bbq and very good for fast and casual meal. Have ordered catering many times and it is always a crowd pleaser."}
{"text":"Ate here a few times and food was just mediocre, plus never busy at all in there.. even during dinner time( not a good sign to me)  The last time my husband went to pick up a take out order, the food was super fatty and to top it all off, the young girl at the front (old enough to be his daughter) asked him what he was going to do with all that food and if he wanted to share it with her when she's off work. That's so disgusting and trashy. This is super close to our house but not worth ever going to again for several reasons. Oh well, with the way they are doing business lately I don't see this place lasting at that location anyway."}
{"text":"I'm a transplant from Texas. I'm not into the whole \"happy cow\" thing. lol  When I saw Dickey's was in Vegas, I immediately called to see where their meats came from - air shipped straight from Texas. O M G.  I found a place that has REAL BBQ! Not that weird stuff at Famous Dave's, which is not BBQ btw.  This place made me feel like I was home again."}
{"text":"This Dickey's is so friendly and the food is delicious!!! We really like this place!!! We are coming back soon!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner, and tried a few different sliders.  They were pretty good, and the sides were also tasty.  The staff greeted me on the way in, offered several suggestions, and were very friendly.  I wish I could have tried a couple ribs too but they only come in half/full rack.  I'll definitely be back to try more.  Honestly, nothing \"wowed\" me about the BBQ, but the quality was top notch; pretty much on par with other chains like Rudy's."}
{"text":"I'll give them credit for having decent pulled pork. That's all the good I can say.  The over priced mac n cheese was brought out cold, I asked for it to be warmed up and the guy who brought it back out looked so annoyed that he had to put it in the microwave for 30 seconds and clearly demonstrated such.  I'm waiting inside right now as I write this review, I've been waiting for the manager for about 30 mins when they said he would come talk to me in 5 mins.  I called ahead to ask if they had WiFi and the girl told me yes. When I got here another girl said they do have WiFi but its for employees only.. I wasn't sure why that would be the case and I asked to talk to the manager if and why that's true. Here I am waiting..   Fairly lame experience here, customer service isn't easy I guess."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times in the past few years and in the past though it was decent, but today I had two bone chips in my pulled pork. Such a turn off. Plus weird lemonade and bbq sauce, and kind of bland all around. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Glad they have moved in to the neighborhood! Yummy food and quick service. I love the fancy pulled pork sandwich and bangers/mash. Also kids eat free on Sunday!"}
{"text":"So it's no surprise to me to find this has closed. With management so inattentive to customers and obviously not business savvy, it's no surprise another statistic added to the number of failed startups. No great loss here."}
{"text":"The meat was the best thing about this place. Five star meat.  My pulled pork tacos were poor. Tortillas very dry. I could not differentiate between cabbage and cole slaw on tacos. The bbq beans were about 200 degrees. The jalape√±o beans were extremely spicy. That's all I could taste was spicy mush. The prep area has a wooden wall which makes me wonder what's behind there. The communication between workers was horrible. The sides cups were not filled all the way, which makes it seem like we were shorted.  The original and spicy sauce were good. They do have free ice cream cones, which was a nice bonus. It's odd that the meat sold by the pound is all the same price. We won't be back."}
{"text":"I eat at Dickies at least once a week so I may be a little biased when it comes to writing this review.  The food is always awesome, hot, and filling.  I always get the sandwiches but the one time I got the meat plate it was good as well.  All you can eat pickles... all you can drink soda (with that awesome crushed ice)... all you can eat ice cream... and three different BBQ sauces to choose from?  What more can you ask for?    How about 32 ounce domestic beers for $3.50... two big screen TVs that are always playing sports... and a friendly and awesome staff always there to offer tips on types of food if you're feeling ambitious to try something new.  -- Waffle fries are awesome... -- Baked beans are delicious... -- Mac and Cheese are shells that are kind-of odd if you are used to the Kraft box style like I am... -- Side salads are small but you get the point...  Make sure to say hi if you see me there on a weekend day!! :)"}
{"text":"Brisket was delcious with the sweet and spicey BBQ sauce. Rolls were hot and delicious, and there was complimentary soft serve ice cream. Serive was friendly, Scott was helpful in explaining menu items, super friendly and funny; a real character. Restaurant is clean, and the sweet tea is outstanding!  Will dine again."}
{"text":"Small portions for the sides however, the food is delicious. I ordered the westerner sandwich with kielbasa sausage and pulled pork and it was wonderful. The sides are very good also."}
{"text":"Eventually had the pulled pork sandwich which was good. My wife had the Beef and Cheese after we were told they had no sausages at all. He chopped brisket was a bit more fatty than she likes and it was just mediocre. Their BBQ sauce was devent though and the spicy one was really spicy! The service was chaotic and the guys behind the counter were sniping at one another. Then before we could pay a customer brought up a large side of mashed potatoes he'd been given by mistake. The cashier then took the side and dumped it back into the mashed potato bin to the horror of my wife and I. We definitely wouldn't go back here. They kept making excuses to other customers that they had been unusually busy even though there was only one customer ahead of us and the place was 75% empty. I guess they could of had a lot of online orders but they seemed to have trouble filling even the simplest order as if they had never done this before."}
{"text":"Dickey's was close to home. Decided to go in and order the 2 meat plate. I paid $15.99 for 2 medium size Pork Ribs, 5 small slices of chicken breast, small cup of bbq beans and a bag of waffle fries. The ribs and chicken were good but sweet sauce made it taste better. A value is debatable, but a deal it is not."}
{"text":"I am a huge lover of wood smoked bbq and I wanted to try a new place. I stumbled upon Dickey's from Google maps and took the family. Without a doubt the best bbq I have ever had. The brisket, mac and cheese, beans, and ice cream were top notch. The staff was very welcoming and had great attitudes. Everything was clean and spotless inside. It had the kids, girlfriend, and myself in a food coma, haha. If I could give a higher star rating I would. The best part is the mind blowing fact that the complimentary ice cream smashes any ice cream you can buy hands down. I have definitely found a go to place for any occasion. Very well done!!!"}
{"text":"Welp...I got some grubb at Dickies.....got a 3 meat combo (polish sausage, brisket and pulled pork) tater salad n jalape√±o beans. Had better BBQ....meats were kind of dry...polish was good. But it wasnt something to brag about. Tater salad wasnt my thing. Didnt have the taste I wanted with BBQ. The jalape√±o beans were actually good if u add som BBQ sauce in them. The sauces themselves were great....great flavor on all three. All in all it was ok....maybe I should eat there next time n not bring it home....will see."}
{"text":"Just stopped in and had a great dinner.  Excellent customer service.  The Pitt boss came out from the counter and explained the menu.  We were very impressed and will be back.   9/17----went in tonight at 515 pm.  3 employees working.  I waited 14 minutes for them to take my order because they were all working on a \"Door Dash\" (a call in or internet order).  During those 14 min, 4 customers left the line. The staff noticed and kept saying thank you for being patient but it made me realize I'd be better off placing an order online instead of waking in.   After 14 minutes and $28 later, I expected to be offered a beverage for waiting so long or a cookie but that didn't happen.  They need a better system with the waiting."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for Dickey's based on the local buzz and the crowds. I ordered the pork rib plate which came with 2 sides and a roll.  The ribs were cooked well and had good smoke on them BUT the dry rub was WAY too salty. Maybe I'm a bbq snob but I can pull better ribs off my Traeger.  The best thing in my order was the coleslaw. I'd give them another shot but I'd avoid the ribs and jalape√±o beans..."}
{"text":"After much anticipation, this location is finally open! The location is shiny and new with friendly staff in a huge space. Food was good as usual and they have a fancy soda selector machine. Unfortunately, they do not have a soft serve machine which I have come to consider a Dickey's staple. Hopefully this location will add it soon!"}
{"text":"Even though this is a chain I know from Texas , this Dickies uses locally sourced meat and wood chips. I ordered the chopped brisket plate. The plate comes with a piece of bread and a side. However none of the sides were on my \"protein\" diet, so I just got the meat.   The cook / server took out a brisket from the warming oven. Sliced off the crispy fat, chopped it and set it aside. Then he sliced the meat, chopped it and combined it with the fat he had set aside. He then weighed a 1/2lb  for my plate!  The meat was delicious with the smoked fatty crust, but a little too heavy.  After I ate my food I was surprised (or not) to find out it's high caloric content. I will definitely go back, however next time, I'll be ordering the smoked turkey or chicken.   My daughter ordered the baked potato, which was huge and loaded with your choice of meat and plenty of fixings. All meals come with soft serve - self serve ice cream. Always a hit with the kids."}
{"text":"Mediocre ribs. They use the cheap cut that has griddle in it. \"BBQ\" beans were gross.  Basically canned pork n beans with some spices and chopped peppers. Brisket was pretty good. Soft enough to cut with a fork, but not a real deep smoke ring and a little under seasoned. Potato casserole was the best part of the meal. Bread roles were nothing special. If this us what passes for 4.5 star BBQ in Phoenix, I'll stuck with Outlaw BBQ in Sedona."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place when I was in Dallas. Finally got my chance. Not disappointed at all."}
{"text":"FANTASTIC! Good food, amazing side options! Easy to stop in or grab and go if your eating at home. I do recommend dining in though because there is FREE ice cream. YES! Free Ice cream machine after you finish your meal. It is a great addition to the meal and the experience. However, my one issue is pricing. It's a little high priced, Buy a drink which is expensive at first, but bring back the souvenir cup for $.99 re-fills. The bbq is impressive!! WE love this place!"}
{"text":"I have only visited the E. Thomas Road location and have never experienced a Dickey's before.  The food is really good, perfect portions and is my go-to place when I just don't feel like cooking dinner.  I have not been happy with the service though... the staff make me feel like I am bothering them and are short on several occasions.  Sort of throwing the food around in the back counter, plopping my to-go bag on my table after letting it hover over the table, rushing me to order and there's no line behind me.  It doesn't feel friendly and I only keep going back because I have a coupon booklet to use.  Please work on your customer service.  I'm not a hard to please person, but I wouldn't choose to keep going back to a place that the staff makes me feel like a burden."}
{"text":"This place is great and the food is really good. I just wish the menu was easier to read its kind of confusing. If there's someone behind you it's a feeling that you are getting rushed to order. Other than that it's one of my favorites."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this location. Food was really good. It was all fresh. We had brisket sandwiches with generous slices of beef. We had a good experience ."}
{"text":"This place was another case of me going and being so hungry that I forgot to take pictures before it was no more. Went here with the family tonight as I had only been to a Dickey's once in the last 6-8 years. I used to go all the time and there were 2 things I loved about it. The first was the big yellow cup for the drink which you got to take home and the second was the FREE ice cream. Well, both of those perks are still around.  As far as the food goes, it is still pretty good BBQ for a \"fast food\" type of restaurant. All of the meats that I have had have been pretty good quality. Tonight I had the pulled pork sandwich with BBQ beans and baked potato casserole. I added onions and pickles to mine with a sweet BBQ sauce and it was awesome. The sides are pretty good too.  My wife had the Tuesday special which was 3 pork ribs with 2 sides and a drink. The ribs tasted great but did have a decent amount of fat on them. Her sides were Cole slaw and Mac and cheese. Both good, although not the best Mac and cheese I have ever had. We will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"WOW!!!  Delicious. Thank you. We needed this. My family came in tonight to celebrate a graduation. I do not have any complaints. Tender, JUICY, seasoned well. I wish I could show you my cheesy green chile potato cakes that fluff to perfection in an iron waffle maker.  We'll be back tomorrow (lol) and more than likely Saturday & Sunday.  Honestly, BBQ sauce is fresh, homemade, unique, delicious & classic all at the same time. Macaroni, again perrect (I would add some dry bake white cheddar/pepper packs) The chicken is sliced in front of you. It's the real deal my relocated eastern/southern coast folks.  Delightful & Super clean....... Honestly, haven't cried in 10 years but you brought tears of Pure satisfaction to me. Truly, we were in NEED of this....    BOLO, we'll be ordering Thanksgiving from you as well this year. We used to order mimi's cafe. --- but you hands down; replaced them...  Addicted already :) Thank you"}
{"text":"I go here a few times a month for lunch and the crew there during the day is phenomenal! They are always friendly helpful and they give the place a great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some barbecue so here I am. My first time here and it awesome! From the moment you stroll in the aroma of smoked barbecue hits your senses. I tried their pulled pork, jalape√±o and cheddar sausage, mac n cheese and baked beans. Awesome! It was all fresh, hot and delicious. Their spicy barbecue sauce was on hit. I'll definitely be back to this spot when ever I get another itch for some barbecue."}
{"text":"It definitely was a first time I would have liked to have back. Told the servers that it was my first time there and they really didn't even acknowledge it. I asked what really was popular and it seems that they just pointed to the most expensive thing on the menu.   The meat wasn't even all too great. It was dry and there really wasn't a taste to it. We had the brisket, turkey and ham. The portions was definitely ridiculous as well. It did not even fill me up.  I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"So I saw this place they got excited about eating there. Went there on Sunday , the guys behind the counter were awesome and very friendly very informative. I had the brisket sandwich and the potato salad , it was awesome I love the barbecue here best so far in Phoenix. You have to try this place"}
{"text":"This is going to be a review mostly for the service we received at this restaurant (or lack there of) Even though the turkey was extremely dry the service was worse! Our family moved from Texas a few months ago, so when we're missing our TX BBQ we usually head to Rudy's or Dickeys'. Today we chose this specific Dickeys' location because we love our kids and they wanted the waffle fries and ice cream here but not available at our other location closer to home.  So back to the bad service, my husband ordered one of our younger daughters a kids turkey sandwich where the server put one small piece of turkey in the roll. For our other young daughter my husband ordered a kids turkey where she received multiple slices of turkey. My husband mentioned to the server that the kids plates were inconsistent in size and the server argued with him about how one is a sandwich and one is a plate (even if it's the exact same thing with one roll. This server (with a toothpick in his mouth) was rude and spoke to us like we were idiots. The female server next to him was just as rude and inconvenienced because we asked her for sides! The first server then proceeded to let the part owner/manager who was well aware of the service he was not happy working the day after his birthday! God forbid anyone works the day after their birthday!  SO bottom line is DO NOT WASTE YOU TIME OR MONEY HERE/ Read the other reviews on this location most are the same as mine. My husband did share our experience with the part owner and she did not seem concerned at all and well aware of her employees treatment to customers! We will never Ever be back.... RUDY's next time!!!!"}
{"text":"I just can't get past The Rib Plate.  I've ordered it all three times I've been here, once in response to someone I watched eating ribs on TV.  Can't beat a craving with anything else! And Dickey's turn-around time from ordering to eating is fast.  The pork ribs are flavorful and meaty, and practically melt in your mouth!  Our go-to sides are the potato salad (loaded with dill), the jalapeno beans and the waffle fries.  The fried okra was okay the one time I ordered it, but not enough to make me order it again.  The complimentary rolls, soft serve ice cream and huge pickles (in-store) are a tasty touch and perfect compliment to a stick-to-your-gizzards-goodness kind of meal."}
{"text":"Went in for an early dinner boy what a disappointment. The Mac and cheese was watery and the beans from a can.  The barbecue was terrible. I won't be going back ever."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time after driving by for years and never stopping. Our experience was fantastic. The food was great?but the most important part was the service.   Eli was so helpful in helping us choose the food we wanted. He was so kind and efficient. We even came back the following day because of the food and him.   5 stars to Eli."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a Lucille's or Famous Daves type of setting, this is NOT the place to be  For me, it's like a fast food BBQ joint. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with that. It's perfect for anyone who's craving BBQ that's on the go or in a rush.   The food was decent, prices are reasonable, portion size is sufficient.... and you get free ice cream with any meal!!! =)"}
{"text":"Well it was Saturday and I decided to drive to Dickeys, the drive was worth it. The brisket was great and smoked perfectly. The sausage was great, I expected spicey when I ordered jalape√±o sausage not the case it just provided flavor. The staff was friendly and it's not common to have the owners serve you food and ensure you enjoyed it. The sides are good, they have both types of potato salad mustard and mayo based. The sauces were great, they even have a vinegar based Carolina style sauce which isn't common for dickeys. Thanks for the service and food we will be back for sure."}
{"text":"A new location for the Dickeys BBQ franchise.  I liked the brisket but I was disappointed they did not have a fryer so no fried okra or French fries.  They also did not have any daily specials like the other Dickeys locations.  Also the smoker does not have the great bbq flavor that the south Scottsdale location has to transfer to the meat."}
{"text":"I very rarely give one star reviews.  There is usually always one thing about a restaurant that is redeeming, but for this particular restaurant, on this particular visit, I could not find one.  To be fair, I did visit one hour before closing, which gives some reason for the behavior that I witnessed, but certainly does not excuse it. I ordered the two meat combo, brisket, pulled pork with bbq beans and fired okra sides.  The first issue I had with the meat was the temperature.  Both items were room temperature at best.  They had both been over cooked, or at a minimum kept in a hot box way too long.  They had lost texture and were short on flavor.  The beans and okra were also disappointing.  The beans were a failed attempt of spicing up canned pork-n-beans.  The okra was frozen and the only flavor was of used fryer grease.  The roll that was served with the meal was quite a surprise.  It actually tasted like the plastic bag it was stored in.  This was a very disappointing meal from start to finish. The real kicker of this experience was the staff.  There were three employees present when I visited.  A young man and woman working the front kitchen area and a slightly older male working in the back.  The older of the three seemed to be serving in some type of \"lead\" position based on him commanding the other two to complete various chores.  As the trio were cleaning up the restaurant, the \"lead\" person in the back could be heard cursing out into the dinning room and making disparaging comments about the restaurant.  He was telling the other two to \"turn the f-ing open sign off,\" we are \"closing this bitch down early.\" \"Who wants to take some of this f-ing food home?\"  One of the employees came over to our table several different times to inquire if we would be getting any soda, tea, ice cream, additional sauce, as he was wanting to turn off and clean these machines. I understand the dynamic of young kids working shitty jobs, most of us have been there, but this was unacceptable.  Say, do and act how you want, AFTER all the customers have left."}
{"text":"I'll update the rating when they figure out how to serve up a decent side salad... with the next size up being 32 bucks... no way."}
{"text":"I've been to different Dickey's across the country and this was a little below par compared to other location visits. Environment was friendly, staff was attentive, but the food wasn't hot or even very warm, definitely not the way you want to enjoy barbecue food. Maybe it was an off night, but I don't know if I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"This is the best bbq I have tried for a while. The meat melts in your mouth and the bread is buttery and soft. Their coleslaw, jalapeno baked beans and loaded baked potato casserole are amazing. I had the westerner which is a sandwich with 2 meats. I had the pulled pork and brisket on mine. I didn't even need to add bbq sauce to my sandwich.   Sundays kids eat free!! They have a limited menu for kids though...chicken nuggets, sliders or 1 meat plate are the choices. My kids of course stuck with their favorite, chicken nuggets.   Oh and free vanilla soft serve ice cream  with your meal! It is the real stuff, not frozen ice milk. :)   You should give this place a try. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The flavor and taste of the meat was decent. I had the 3 meat...beef brisket, pulled pork and jalapeno kielbasa. Unfortunately the meat was COLD. $14 and change for cold food? Not impressed."}
{"text":"My family and I decided to order barbecue for our Saturday evening dinner. I ordered online. Ordering online is quick and easy as well as convenient.  I ordered the family meal. For the meat, we chose pulled pork. Two sides and dinner rolls accompany it. We selected green beans and Mac n' Cheese. The green beans have white onion and bacon added in-delectable! I added coleslaw because I personally think eating barbecue isn't complete without a good coleslaw.  We picked up our order within 30 minutes of placing the order. It was fast, quick and easy. Our server was friendly and pleasant as well as efficient.  The meal is kept hot in a warmer until pickup. Once home, we took the food containers out and opened them. The food was hot and fresh. The rolls tasted like they were right out of the oven.  The entire meal was delicious. I highly recommend Dickey's Barbecue for lunch or dinner. It's amazing!"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined right before closing on a Saturday night. The food and service were both outstanding. The manager was extremely friendly and gave us coupons for our next visit. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"BBQ was great but the mac and cheese taste like KFC mac and cheese. Customer service was great tho."}
{"text":"What brought is in was the website saying they had fallen off the bone ribs.   These ribs couldn't be ripped of the bone.   I couldn't get any meat off it,  it was horrible.   But before that,  the service was awful.   We weren't acknowledged for awhile we were the only ones in line.   The girl standing there making food couldn't just look up and say something to the affect of,  be with you in a minute....  So we ordered our ribs,  then some other girl is yelling across saying cone over here and order your sides,  we were like are you kidding me....  By the time we sat down we were so appalled at the service and that we were so stupid to actually pay and stay.   Then the food was just awful,  my husband has never and I mean ever left food on a plate in a restaurant,  his plate was full.   He did complain and got a refund but we will never be back and if you want good service or fall off the bone robs,  don't go here."}
{"text":"Great service, good food in generous portions. And soft serve ice cream at the end! It's not for the serious bbq fan but it does the job every few months for a quick good bite to eat. I would recommend!  Only problem was that they had CNN on their TVs."}
{"text":"I love BBQ so could not wait to come here.  Food was terrible, the brisket was dry.  They had no business so I assumed it sat around all day."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch and it was delicious! The restaurant and restrooms were clean. The staff was quick and friendly. Our food was great! We loved the spicy BBQ sauce and afterwards wished that we'd purchased some to take home - next time! We will definitely stop again."}
{"text":"I was given a promo code for a free family meal at any Dickey's if ordered online. I placed the order and the promo code worked perfectly, I just had to pay the tax. However, the next morning, I received a phone call that they would not honor it and would charge me full price if I picked up the food. How shady! Steer clear of this business, I certainly will!"}
{"text":"Wanna spend $15 for a meager few slices of chicken breast, and a small fistful of brisket, with literally 3 slices of pickle? And the staff... Please don't let us know how much you hate your job. Have some pep in your step. Acting bored as hell and indifferent to customers. Needless to say, this visit was a mistake, and won't be coming back again(of course). And yes, I've spent more at a BBQ place. But I got BBQ in return. Here I got three bites of chicken and 4 bites of brisket for $15. Mediocre BBQ at best, to top it off."}
{"text":"For a fast food type place this was excellent. They had a special- 2 pulled pork samiches for $5.50. The pork was super moist. They had several BBQ sauces to choose after and free ice cream."}
{"text":"Even though it was close to closing, employees were VERY friendly and prepared everything to a T. Food was very good,as usual, but this review was geared towards the employees that worked tonight.  Although i would come back regardless because food is so good, employees tonight made the experience that much better."}
{"text":"This is my go to bbq. Food is consistently great and the staff is always happy. The manager Dominique is always awesome, she always recognizes us when we come in. The other Dickey's is closer to us but her store is worth the drive."}
{"text":"So been here 2 times. First time I come in 35 minutes before they close... And I get the look of death chairs up and they are packing up. So i left. Come back again and I order they are out of two of the meats. Then the people are anything but friendly plus not very clean looking. The food wasn't bad but the service, employee caliber, and lack of customer care makes me think twice about giving it another shot,"}
{"text":"I ordered online @ubereats but there was no selection for french fries due to the possibility of fried foods being soggy on long trips, but the gentleman Josh took down my name and made sure the meal I ordered would come with french fries. He went above and beyond and the food is great, this was my first time trying this establishment and I will be back! Excellent service and great food, GO JOSH!! Thanks for your help!"}
{"text":"I just ordered ribs from this spot and the meat was so salty I couldn't eat it. I literally gagged when I bit into them. Had to throw them in the garbage. The sides also weren't very good, no seasoning on the green beans. I just wasted $30 and still hungry."}
{"text":"Loved it! I ordered online for a company lunch. The food was hot & ready at the scheduled time. Very good. Everyone loved it!"}
{"text":"Thank goodness for this damn fine bbq chain! Seriously, we've dined at a number of Dickey's bbq locations from Az thru Cali and in Seattle as well! Very consistent and affordable on-premises smoked bbq meat selections! 6.00 for a tall meat sandwich on a round bun....what a deal! So, you can go stand in line(1.5 hrs?) at those expensive & 5star places or just walk in, place your order, pay, pick up and eat! This location is one block from the lightrail station by Sundevil stadium."}
{"text":"My wife had this franchise on the brain for a while now. Her friends at work had talked the BBQ ribs up at this location. As a result, we drove out of our way to satisfy her desire to try these ribs. The service here is deli counter style. Bottom line, the ribs were excellent. They had great flavor and were fall off the bone tender. However, I was taken a back at their prices. $16 for a half rack and $29.99 for a full rack. This was for ribs only. Sides are 'a la carte. I for one did not think much of their sides. However, my wife liked the green beans with bacon. They do have a great daily lunch special with a pre determined entree by day of the week, side and beverage for $9.99. I took advantage of this special and on this day it was the pulled pork sandwich.  This sandwich was very good. I ordered the Mac and cheese with this special and it was lacking. If you are in the mood for ribs you will not go wrong, just be ready to get out your check book. If you are hungry for a quick lunch I don't think you can go wrong with their daily meal deal."}
{"text":"Every time I go in here people are friendly.  Zane has by far got to be the most outgoing.  Super cool guy.  He's a big reason I'll be back."}
{"text":"Food is average way overpriced two 1/4 pounds of meat, a small side and a drink ran me about $14. I'm very hesitant to go back not only for the mediocre food and crazy expensive prices, but I also went to the dickeys on college avenue and it was the worst, driest, and most expensive barbecue I've ever had. Sorry dickeys not coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered a three meat plate brisket ribs and turkey the brisket was 3/4 fat the turkey had 0 flavor and the ribs tasted like they boiled them then put some rub on them them baked them no smoke flavor what so ever! Also ordered an all rib plate was told no fryer items such as okra which is really the only side item I like also no fries which is one of the side it's my boyfriend likes no opinion tanglers either so we ended up getting bean which were probably the best part of the entire meal which isn't saying much potato casserole was just just garlic mashed potatoes and the Mac n cheese tasted like something you would get from a microwave dinner I've eaten Dickies all over California and this is possibly the worst experience ever!  Since they started opening up everywhere their quality has gone way down way way down over $30 for the two plates without drinks is terrible also the plates used to come with a buttered roll which they do not have and they also did away with the onions and pickles all and all I will not be going back"}
{"text":"RECOMMENDED:  I'm so glad that I gave this place a 2nd shot.  I am happy to report that upon further review, it's even better than the 1st time.  My beef on my first visit was portion size ONLY.    Walking in, I was immediately met with the sweet mouth watering smell of hickory smoke enticing my taste buds.   Today, I elected to order 1 lb of meat as my meal, 1/2 pound pork and 1/2 pound brisket.  My wife ordered 1/2 pound smoked chicken and 1/2 pound pulled pork. We did not even come close to finishing it all!  I really enjoy the deep hickory smoke flavor of their meats.  It is delicious.  I WILL BE BACK OFTEN!  Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This bbq is amazing!! It was Smokey  and flavorful. Loved the ribs and pulled pork. We got mac n cheese. Baked beans and potato salad. Literally everything was delicious. I would say the roll was boring and had no flavor but everything else was amazing and well definitely be making this our favorite restaurant!"}
{"text":"Had the beef brisket and chicken breast with a ceasar salad. Brisket is tasty and full of flavor chicken was juicy and tender. southern sweet tea was refreshing on this hot day. This is a great lunch combo. Enough for two but I managed to finish it myself. And they have free ice cream. Cool little lunch spot. I'll  be back for more."}
{"text":"This location has good bbq.   The sauce is a bit on the Spicy side but overall it is good stuff.  The brisket is not overly fatty and has a good smoked flavor.  The pulled pork was good too."}
{"text":"I'll preface by saying the female owner and her daughter did make us feel better after our first and last visit. Candidly speaking, this was the worst bbq I've ever had. 2 bites was all it took. My brisket was flavorless, had no bark, no smoke, and the tiny ribs were hard as nails. It was literally inedible due to how dry it was. Creamed spinach was cold. Extremely over priced. My wife got the 1 meat plate with brisket. I got the 3 meet plate with 1 serving of brisket and 2 servings of ribs. See the pictures below of the disgrace. My portion sizes were a third of the portions they gave my wife. When I asked about it, the server said the portion sizes become smaller depending on the number of meats you order per plate... Despite the prices being higher for more meats. Huh? This makes absolutely no sense. Took my 2 bites and asked for a refund, which they gave. The mac and cheese was good and hot. The creamed spinach was good as well despite being cold. All in all, I get the feeling the workers here lack passion and a true regard for the guest."}
{"text":"Finally a great BBQ place right by my work! They have generous portions, and different lunch specials every day. The only thing holding this back from 5 stars it that it is going to completely ruin my diet. Not to mention they have some of the best sweet tea in town.  Make sure to get there right at 11am when they open, by noon they are usually slammed full of people and on occasion it take a little longer to get your food that it should."}
{"text":"Great quick service. Slightly hidden behind potbellys but worth finding.  Never been disappointed and like the free ice cream at the end."}
{"text":"Guy Fieri made me crave pulled pork. Since I don't cook, I search Medina and ended up here. The craving was satisfied. I had the one meat plate and chose barbecued beans and Cole slaw. I was not disappointed. The cashier gave me information about my choices of sauce and all of the specials available next week. I may just go back."}
{"text":"This place is no big deal. I think if you want a change from fast food and want some quick BBq then this place might make you happy. If your hopping to find a great little BBq place that yoiu just cant wait to go back to forget it. Prices are not bad and they do have free ice cream which is always good in my book. I had acombo meal for $8.50. I chose pulled pork and beef brisket on my sanwich. The brisket was tender but no flavor and dry. The pulled pork was really dried out so you needed lots of bbq sauce. I did get two sides with this I got the mac n cheese. This was watery, cheese needed to be thicker. The waffel fries were ok but could have been cooked a little longer so they were crispy. Mabey it was a bad night that I stoped by but i dont think ill be commin back here."}
{"text":"Excellent pulled pork big barbeque sandwich.  The sides are all great, though I haven't tried the okra yet.  Kids 12 and under eat free on Sundays with an adult meal purchase, and there are unlimited vanilla ice cream cones.  Several options of barbeque sauce, which are all tasty.  Service at this restaurant is great."}
{"text":"Must have new owners or something but they have changed the menu, tacos were hard and awful, said they didn't serve the rolls after 7pm, out of chicken and other meats. Food was cold! We used to frequent this place but NOT coming back after today's experience! Would have given no stars but that's not an option."}
{"text":"So after writing my review about Dickeys in Mentor Ohio, I get an answer and request for a phone number and email so they can contact me.  They left the below message on my Yelp account....   VERY INTERESTING....  didn't seem to care one bit!!!  Hi Laura,  Sorry to here that our ribs aren't any better than Giant Eagles.  Well, since this is a free country, at least you have the option to get your barbecue there when you have a hankering.  So enjoy your Giant Eagle ribs and have a great day.  Ron Barnhart Owner"}
{"text":"Dickey's good food is always a given for us. I like that they are constantly adding new menu items, but how can I avoid sliced brisket for me, pulled pork for my wife and ribs. Makes it hard to experiment. Some of the newer locations do not offer free soft serve ice cream and we used to be able to buy bottles of their bbq sauce. I am giving five stars for the food, but miss free dessert and the take home sauce."}
{"text":"Been looking forward to this place for a long time finally came with my son we order ribs and brisket coleslaw side and the creamy spinach side upon entrance it looks like a nice place clean ordering process is simple the menu is a little complicated but the people are helpful the employees are very helpful  lacks in execution.   it's very hard to keep barbecue smoked meats moist and hot but they did an adequate job not jumping out of my shoes probably will not come back but they do a good job"}
{"text":"Dicky's is to BBQ as Taco Bell is to Mexican. It's edible, cheap, but that's about all it's value. Anyone who says Dicky's is good BBQ hasn't ever had good BBQ. The meet was dry, had no flavor of it's own and the sauce was ok. They managed to make pulled pork dry. PULLED PORK. They have a sign displaying the 'definition' of BBQ. Other than the meats listed, they don't actually fit that definition. Perfectly fine for a quick meal, but next time I'm craving BBQ, I won't be going here."}
{"text":"I know some people are hardcore when it comes to their BBQ, not very many chains are able to please a true brisket connoisseur, If there was a person I would imagine they reside in the bowels of Texas... or in my house.    This place is as close to the real deal without being housed in an old run down barn.  The brisket sandwich is amazing as is the pulled pork.  Todays visit was extra special with the extra scoopful  of kindness provided by the staff.  If you don't come for the BBQ you must come for the ice!"}
{"text":"Not one of our better experience here, we just arrived into town and needed something quick to eat before heading to bed from a long drive in. We decided to get dickies hear a try as we have had the food in the path of the locations close to home. The food was OK but it feels like it had been sitting out for a while and lost some of its flavors. The two gentlemen that were there helping us we're very professional and courteous. This is why were getting in a four star rating was because of these two gentlemen. The place was not completely clean of the time of our arrival which tells me they were behind and trying to catch up. We are willing to give this place another try upon our next visit to see if they can improve their food quality. We are not saying to not give this place a try you may have a better experience than we did but please be aware"}
{"text":"I work right near this location and my co-workers rave about it so I decided to try it.  The menu was a little confusing at first, but the man who took my order was patient and friendly.  The food was delicious.  I had a turkey sandwich, mac and cheese and the baked potato casserole.  The only down side was the bun was too soft for the heavy turkey.  Next time I will be ordering the platter since I ate it open faced anyway.  There will definitely be many more next times."}
{"text":"So it did seem clean ...which is good but the bbq was not good ... when ordering ...I did a three piece and the guy behind the counter asked me if he could surprise me with the third piece ..... whats that about ?  Anyways ..I did enjoy the cake I got for desert but the bbq was lousy ."}
{"text":"Nice interior, clean, with history & info in big letters on the walls. Friendly service. I had to take-out. I love the sweet tangy sauce!! I had ribs & ham. Tender tasty ribs & smoked ham. The potato salad is creamy, subtle, almost bland but I ate it all. Was better with salt & pepper added. I'm not used to that type of potato salad. The green beans & bacon is lovely! Side order take-out containers are larger than other places. The roll was yum. Good amount of food for good price. I would def go back. I hope there's one in LA."}
{"text":"First things out of the way first, the food itself tastes pretty good.  That being said, I paid $17 for a \"3 meat plate\" which came with 2 sides. What I ended up receiving was a tiny total portion of meat (one of the thirds being less than a full size kielbasa, got maybe half of one). There wasn't even enough of the pork or brisket to make a sandwich out of, quantity wise.  Then the sides came in two small containers that held maybe 5 spoonfuls worth of beans or potato salad.  Absolutely horrible value overall in terms of what you get for the price."}
{"text":"I tried it the other day and was very good and very nice. I had ordered my phone ahead of time and at closing time but they waited for me and made my fries fresh. Tonight I return with my husband and we ate there and had a very good experience. Very nice workers there. Will be back. Glad I open the valu coupons that comes in the mail."}
{"text":"I came in on Sunday around 1 PM, The place was almost empty, two tables, on One there was a guy eating by himself and on the other there was a Family of four, I ordered to go two dinners - you can choose with one meat or two meats or three meats, i ordered two meats, One had chicken and brisket and the other had Polish sausage and pulled pork, paid almost $28.00 not even counting drinks - drinks where additional When I got home to our surprise The portions were so small that I felt cheated of my money Two slices of brisket? Really?  I think you should make your portions bigger! Make me want to go wow ! and come back again for more because I got good value for my money -not feel cheated, I don't know how much food you probably Waste or goes bad because it's not sold, Or maybe you don't but in any event I think that if you would make your portions bigger your place will be filled up with people on weekends If you're not getting enough traffic into your dining room that is probably the reason why --the food is very good and people don't mind paying a bit more as long as they are getting good value, People that like barbecue like to eat a lot! Just saying, that's my humble opinion. Not coming back because I Think you charge too much for too little"}
{"text":"Decent fast food style BBQ. I had the brisket and the pulled pork - in my opinion, if you don't do those right, you shouldn't be selling bbq, so those are the go-to choices for any new bbq place for me. Having said that, they did them pretty well here. Tender, moist, flavorful...I didn't find out what kind of wood they use to smoke, but it was a good, mild smoke flavor. The sides were decent too actually. I've been to bbq places before where the sides were terrible. not here though. Mac n cheese was pretty decent, the beans were good as well. Free soft serve ice cream to boot, if you're still hungry that is..."}
{"text":"We orders food for six people and after being 20 minutes late on having the order ready, they forgot three items.  Really poor services, don't waste you time with this food chain."}
{"text":"I ordered from here via Uber Eats. Never eaten here before. I ordered the feast that fed 4-6. Bbq was good. But they forgot my potatoe salad.  Bbq just isn't the same without potato salad. When you have somethings delivered and pay an extra $6.49 for delivery, it would be nice if everything you ordered was there."}
{"text":"Delicious & moist bbq brisket. The green beans and mash potatoes were good too. I will definitely be back. The place is very clean and the staff are nice and friendly. They also offer free vanilla cones if you have any room after your meal."}
{"text":"I just popped in for some quick take out. Never having been here before the staff was most helpful and extremely friendly. I got the one pound of pulled pork and a medium potato salad. Both were delicious and the pork made 4 large sandwiches with some left over.  The spicy sauce was delicious as was the original. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I liked the old store set up better. The baked  bean recipe tastes different (on the bad side) and the prices have jumped up. $13 for a small 3 meat plate- I would rather go to tony romas for that price or Memphis BBQ which is just down the street. Oh and the Mac and cheese sucks! Even microwave crap tastes better."}
{"text":"Barbeque with a side of flies!   This place really delivers an authentic experience of sitting by a swamp and enjoying your BBQ while being assualted by a continous squadron of flies. You just can't beat that real southern flavor of blood sucking insects landing in your food and letting their fresh germs infuse with the smokey flavors. This place should be featued in Guy Fieri's Diners, Dives and Drive-By's, because if you see it, keep driving."}
{"text":"This place just opened on for 4-9-15. I visited on day two at lunchtime and things seemed to be running smoothly. Very busy, but the line moved quickly. Tables, but no table service. You order at the assembly line, like at Chipotle.  Standard barbecue offerings: ribs, brisket, pulled pork, sausage, chicken. For sides, there's waffle fries, mac & cheese, beans, slaw, etc. Sweet tea, of course. Kids meals (free on Sundays). Oh yeah, and free soft-serve vanilla ice cream.   Sauce was good enough, but pulled pork was great. Waffle fries were a little lamp, but they have to be made in advance to keep the line moving as quickly as it did. The sweet tea could have tasted a little more fresh-brewed.  All in all, a pretty good place that I can see myself returning to regularly."}
{"text":"This place has really dry ribs. I would never go back. I'm sure this location will be gone soon. It is supposed to be fall off the bone, these are hard to get off the bone"}
{"text":"Came here because some friends really wanted to eat here. Service was slow but the staff was attentive and very kind. I ordered the pulled pork and chicken sandwich and it was mediocre at best. I thought it was over priced for the size of sandwich I received and the small amount of meat that was in it. Plus the meat was kinda bland and dry. On the plus side, I ordered a side of waffle fries and they came hot and absolutely delicious. Gave them 2 stars because of fries and awesome staff."}
{"text":"I was hoping for more, was excited to try Dickey's since they were very close. However, the food was very small portioned and over priced and honestly not that great tasting I ordered the brisket and it was full of fat so sorry guys not coming back."}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ. Service was friendly. I really loved the spicy BBQ sauce. We sampled the pulled pork, ham, brisket, spicy cheddar sausage, and ribs. It was all tasty but our favorite item was the ribs. The fried okra was good too. The only disappointing part was the soft serve ice cream. It tasted artificial and was a little \"off\" in consistency. Overall a good experience. Id go back."}
{"text":"Cost is pretty expensive. Could lower the price $2 overall and you would get more customers no doubt. The person running the \"meats\" area is not friendly at all. Two different times, different people even. . .were rude. Not a fan of how the menu is laid out so damn high."}
{"text":"Was getting my car washed next door and wanted to grab a bite to eat.  Since I love BBQ, this was an easy decision for me to give this place a shot.  After browsing the menu, I decided to try: 4 oz BBQ Beef Brisket Sandwich, $4.50 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z8Em-bhZI3Mmspml7tj6tg?select=Erry3muhVFQdFZQPCJRHzw 2 oz Hot Link Sandwich, $3 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/z8Em-bhZI3Mmspml7tj6tg?select=qxTdcqqimxhFcmoW1Iyj9g I got them both \"dressed\", which means they give you Onions & Pickles on the side to put on the Sandwich.  Next to the Soda Fountain, there are vats of Hot & Mild BBQ Sauce for self service.  I of course went for the Hot BBQ Sauce.  The food is delivered to your table when it's ready.  I went for the Hot Link Sandwich first and didn't put any Hot BBQ Sauce on it so that I could taste the natural Spiciness of the Hot Link.....well, I was disappointed, it's not very hot at all.  Damn, the search for real BBQ Hot Link Sandwiches continues.  Next, I went for the BBQ Beef Brisket Sammie.....I poured some Hot BBQ Sauce and added the Onions & Pickles to it.  It's not a bad Sandwich.....pretty good.  I thought the Bread was a bit blah....like grocery store Bread......a nice Italian or French Roll would have been better with it.  The Beef was tender and juicy and had a slightly smoky flavor to it.  I prefer it to have a bit more flavor to it, but like how they serve you the Sandwich dry and allow you to put your own BBQ Sauce on it.  The Hot BBQ Sauce was pretty spicy......really enjoyed that a lot.  Overall, it was a pretty good experience.  Return Factor - 71%"}
{"text":"I've been dieting and basically the only thing I can have is chicken and a bit of veggies since my meals are split to 5 per day, it also has to be super low cal. When you're out and about and in a hurry this can be dang near impossible. I've been heading to chipotle for their kids meal for the grilled chicken tacos without the shell but I've been very disappointed in their customer service and quite frankly it lacks flavor without paying for additional toppings. So, today, I decided to give Dickys a try right next door. Upon waking in I was greeted by Scott, he was friendly and had a good sense of humor that helped when I was being a pain about calorie count and nutrition info. Low and behold they actually have health options for us watching our macros! I ordered the grilled chicken breast and a side of green beans (they don't jam pack these with calories from butter etc (only 50 cals). The chicken came pre sliced on this neat metal tray and was absolutely amazing, it has a freshly smoked flavor to it and was juicy and the perfect temperature. The greenbeans came unexpected in a delicious seasoned juice and were soft and tasty. I will absolutely be back! Thanks Scott for the good service."}
{"text":"Horrible. Had second thoughts when I didn't smell smoked meat outside or even when I first walked in. Should have listened to my instincts."}
{"text":"There food was usually good that is why we have returned, but each time I go the service gets worse. The girl but the cashier doesn't seem like she is all there I handed her a coupon and she took my card but never applied the coupon. After getting my card back she just walked away. The older lady is also rude. She just asked what do you want as we were just waiting for someone to hand us our food that was sitting behind the counter. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"A good bbq place ive found in Phoenix so far. Havent tried many others so nothing to compare it to.enjoyed the pulled pork by the pound and love the spicy bbq sauce. Drink selection kinda sucks. And once I did get a slab of ribs with 70% fat and grissle. But overall good bbq and fast. Sausage very good. A bit pricy for portion size however."}
{"text":"This use to be my favorite BBQ restaurant in Las Vegas. Now they have changed their menu so you can't order combo plates or plates anymore. You have to order meats by weight and order sides separately and no more pickles with each meal. and their meat recipes have changed and are horrible. The chicken is no longer smoked and is rubber now and the brisket flavorless and bland. Big letdown. Lost a customer."}
{"text":"Was able to catch the tail end of an event where Dickey's was catering. Wow! Really good stuff!!!  The beef brisket was so smoky and tender. You might just moan when you eat it - it's that delcious. All the sides were good - the mac and cheese, slaw and yeast rolls. The Green beans cooked with bacon and onions took the prize! You could taste the bacon fat/drippings - now that's flavor - took me back to my grandmas cooking!  The two staff members catering the event were incredibly professional, helpful and made you feel spoiled! Didn't catch their names but one was a sweet girl from Texas - she knows who she is and she knows she's awesome!!! They wouldn't even take tips (now that's professional) but they did get free hugs from me!!"}
{"text":"Good bbq and since its located on the north side of town, we will take it. Bbq ribs are great, pulled pork was also spot on. I got the two meat combo with mac n cheese and waffle fries. The mac n cheese was something you would get at kfc almost runny not the common homemade mac n cheese most bbq places have... but it was decent. The waffle fries were good. Husband got 3 meat combo with ham, brisket and ribs which were all gone... His sides potato salad and beans he didn't like the beans. Good portions and very reasonably priced. And free ice cream cones for everyone, even if you take to-go. Pretty awesome  will return"}
{"text":"It is important to note that today was this location's grand opening. (There was another reviewer that didn't understand that, and wandered in during their private soft-opening yesterday and responded with a 1-star.)  I used to go to the Dickey's at Happy Valley before it closed a couple years back. I was very pleased to see that a new location was opening closer to home. As I suspected, the food is still outstanding. I recommend the Brisket and the Pulled Pork.   Was a little disappointed by the Potato Salad, but I like mine made with mustard, so that's kind of a coin flip anywhere you go. Also, the dining room was pretty dimly lit, but I'm sure they will work the kinks out.  I would recommend to the management to try and find a solution to streamline the ordering queue, the suite is laid out pretty awkwardly with the door to the patio crossing through the front of the line. Maybe it would be better to take orders and transactions more rapidly and bring them out to tables as they are ready as you see in other fast-casual places.  But, at the end of the day, it's great BBQ at a reasonable price. It's certainly cheaper than taking the family to famous daves or what-have-you. Self-serve ice cream cones are included free also, so it's great for kids."}
{"text":"Simple establishment with good barbecue at a decent price.   We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The food was good but we will never go back because of the young rude and immature staff! A bubble gum popping young girl was actually fighting with a customer while we were eating I was disgusted!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend got me this for dinner last night and i was happy with what he got me. I had a pulled pork bbq snadwich, there was a side of mac and cheese (that my very picky toddler loved) a side of beans, and a piece of pecan pie. It was all very good. I need to come in myself and look at all the options to see what else to try."}
{"text":"don't waste your money here...way over priced & poor quality of food, the ribs were DRY and the brisket wasn't much better, potatoes were cold. and for sure DON'T get a to go order cause they won't get it right. we will NEVER go here again. BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY"}
{"text":"When I heard a new BBQ joint was opening right around the corner, I couldn't wait for it to open.  I don't like to go to new places when they first open because that's usually when things aren't their best....  But they've been open long enough now to have the kinks worked out, and they def. do not.  I went there around 5:45 pm (tonight, a Friday night) and there were only 3 people sitting eating, and only 2 people in front of me to order.  It took at least 15 minutes from the time I walked in and for me to get my order and leave since I ordered it to go.  There was a general sense of the employees still not knowing exactly what they were doing and they seemed very confused and disorganized in general.  The gal working there had to bark simple orders to them several times.  There is also NO sense of customer service by anyone working there whatsoever.  I ordered the big beef sandwich and 2 small sides (potato salad and mac/cheese).  They originally gave me 2 sides of mac & cheese even though the guy repeated back to me exactly what I said to him??? Also, the website says if you order a sandwich and 2 sides you 'make it a plate' for a special price.  The cashier had no idea what I was talking about, and when I questioned it a 2nd time, she literally ignored me and just took my credit card and charged me.  Nearly $14 for a small beef sandwich and 2 small sides.  I ate it all in one minute flat, and am still STARVING as I type this.  The food is good, but the portions are very small and over priced, esp. for the location and demographic of this particular area.  I don't see how a place like this is going to last very long, esp. with a brand new Chipotle right next door and a Popeye's drive thru coming soon right across the parking lot.  The bbq sauce is very mediocre as well and tasted like it had been watered down somehow.  Won't be back, soley due to the fact that you aren't getting enough bang for your buck.  If anyone reading this wants some legit amazing BBQ where you're getting what you pay for, I highly recommend Little Miss BBQ (best in town hands down) or the BBQ Company."}
{"text":"If you love BBQ, you'll love Dickeys. The best part, aside from the friendliness of their staff, if the quickness. Yes, if you go in during mid-lunch or Sunday evenings, you'll experience a line. A line is a good thing! It means people want to eat there!   The Westerner is my personal favorite with brisket and honey ham. Enjoy some soft serve while you wait, dine in or take out, but always enjoy. It's not every day you get good BBQ in Phoenix.  I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I hate doing bad reviews. I usually prefer to just not rate at all in hopes that's it's a one time/bad day kinda thing but some things.....smh. Anyhow, to begin, i found a burnt/twisted/melted dirty piece of plastic in my side of fries. Of course it was mixed in so I didn't see it until I had eaten half of them.  how that even got in there, I have no idea. I also ordered ribs that were lacking in flavor and room temperature at best and tasted more like unsauced leftovers at best. It's been about a year or so since we've eaten here but I do remember their service and food being nothing short of 5 stars. I'm not sure what happen. They were polite and may have tried to rectify the problem had I went back and complained, idk. (Ordered Take out) Honestly just kinda grossed out and not a fan of complaining about food and asking for a redo from the same kitchen and praying to not find anything more in my food or worse. I more than likely will never go back. For what it's worth, the rest of my family's food was fine. But this isn't their review it's mine. ? and im the one who paid for the food. So it may have just been my luck, who knows. Go at your own risk."}
{"text":"Well they've screwed things up and changed the menu where it is unrecognizable.     And the daily specials board is gone.  Bad deal.   No more BBQ plates, everything is a-la-carte.  The Little Hoagies are gone and fried okra is no longer on the sides menu.   The employees often seem, well,  distracted and excessive wind blasts at both doors must be endured upon entry.   If you can get past this needless aggravation  the food is still very good."}
{"text":"For bbq this place for me was just ok. They only serve spare ribs which have only been cooked for 4 hours. While the meet came off the bone easily the top part was basically bad jerky and inedible unless you want to sit around for a few hours chewing.  I quite enjoyed the bbq sauce - for me it was better than famous daves but then again I like a sweeter sauce.  Sides I thought were good but for sure not fresh and have been sitting under the heat lamp.  I would not come again only because for the price I should be able to eat every part of the rib and not have to throw out the jerky top."}
{"text":"Good food,  although I always get the same thing all the time. .. pulled pork sandwich and baked beans. Delicious. I'm sure everything else on the menu is good too. Prices are just right,  fast service."}
{"text":"We used Dickey's to cater our rehearsal dinner. The food was fabulous and so affordable! They also supplied the plates, napkins, and plastic ware. We chose to have the beef brisket and pulled pork, the mac n cheese, the baked potato casserole, and baked beans. We also had them cater dessert which was delicious. Loved the food, loved the price!"}
{"text":"As far as taste goes this place is fantastic!  Several choices of BBQ sauce and tasty sides to go with your chosen meat.  The only reason I gave Dickies 3 Stars is because although my taste buds love it, my stomach does not."}
{"text":"Smoking meats properly takes a lot of time and can't be rushed and sometimes I just don't have the time to do it myself.  Honestly ain't nobody got time for that. When this occurs I go to Dickeys to get my meat fix. They're like the fast food of BBQ that doesn't skimp on quality. But what really happens is some angel of BBQ wakes up long before you and I and gets the 'que a cooking - just for our carnivorous pleasures.  Anywho... I think I prefer their brisket because that's what I usually order on Sundays. All the other days my  decision is made for me as I always get the deal of the day - Its all so good. But on Sundays the special is kids eat free and I stopped passing for 12 many years ago.  If you saw my Dickeys cup collection you'd know I was legit about being a regular. The cups are big. And yellow. And the hard plastic makes them totally reusable.    Protip: when you get tired of the free ice cream cones go ahead and make yourself a rootbeer float in your brand new travel cup."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time, and I absolutely love it. I will continue to come here for great BBQ."}
{"text":"I could see why this place has such inconsistent reviews. I can totally agree with some of the low and high reviews on here. For example, I think they really need to work on their customer service. The wait can be horrendous here sometimes especially during lunch hours. And it seems like the employees don't even bother to rush or speed up what they are doing. Everything works on their time here.   Plus, the older lady (is she the owner?) is helllaaa stingy with the food. They measure and weigh every single thing here! Am I at a science lab? I mean I get it, you wanna maximize your $$ and keep the food portions consistent. But when restaurants start weighing your food items that really turns me off.   As for the upsides of this place. The food is decent (ok) and they got pickles and free soft serve ice cream! YES. So yea. I'm very hesitant to give more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"This was our next stop on hubby's on going tour of brisket in the Greater Madison area.  Today the brisket was served chopped instead of sliced as he previously recalled.  This seems to be a way of hiding or masking the fat.  When sliced, he can easily work around the fat, it was more difficult dealing with it as a chopped meat.  Overall though, he didn't have to pick out too much excess fat and the taste was pretty good.  He chose green beans as his side and thought those were very good.  I got a half rack of ribs which was really too much for me.  They do have a rib plate option that comes with two sides that may have worked better for my appetite.  The ribs were good.  The final rating for Dickey's would probably be more of a 3.5 as the experience as a whole was a good one.  While the weather is still nice we'll likely hit up our favorite BBQ food cart and maybe get to Dickey's more once they close up for the season."}
{"text":"Great \"fast food\" concept applied to great home-style BBQ. This place is good for the soul! Fast, fresh, flavorful. I like that the meat is tender and juicy and you put the sauce on yourself so that it's not hoppy or over-done. Totally satisfied my craving."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and professional.  The food, on the other hand, did not meet my expectations.  I wasn't a fan of the chicken (I liked that it was boneless but was hoping it would be cooked in bbq sauce) and the ribs were fine, nothing spectacular.  I'd be interested in trying the pork and brisket, but my first experience was not good enough to make me return.  Probably would have given 2 stars if not for the good experience with employees."}
{"text":"Dine here for dinner tonight hmmm wasn't impressed. My food was dried out also very taste less. Would like to say I'll try them again since I received a $1 refillable cup with my order but I doubt it. First signed of I shouldn't eat here was there was a line at the establishment next door and NO ONE inside Dickey's BBQ ."}
{"text":"I remember coming here for the \"Grand Opening\" a few years back.... and I remember really loving the food. I have made the trip back a few times over the last 3 years... and each time have been a little more disappointed than the last.   I went there for lunch yesterday after \"selling\" a co-worker on how good it was.   I was sorta wrong! :(  The prices have gone way up... and the quantity of the dish was way less than I remembered.  And it was not overly good, or bad... just mediocre BBQ. And I can get that anywhere.   I made a big deal of the free ice creme to my coworker.... and wouldn't you know it... the machine was OUT OF ORDER on our visit!   Sorry Dickey's... I am not sure when I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Pretty pricey, but you can't deny the taste of the food. It's worth it considering. Kids eat free on Sundays which is cool!"}
{"text":"My. Goodness.   Let's start by saying that we moved here from the south where barbecue reins supreme. We lived here for a good 4 years and couldn't find a decent rib to save our lives - so we relied on Famous Dave's to get us through the cravings. Fast forward to the glorious day we found Dickey's.   Dickey's was spotted from across the shopping plaza, tucked away a corner like someone's dirty little secret. We gave it the ol' 'why the hell not?' and strolled up to the counter. The menu is INTENSE with so many options. I shot straight to the rib plate, because ribs are where it's at in my book. My husband got the brisket sandwich.   The tray - yes, TRAY of food I received was overflowing with yum. The ribs fell off of the bone and were delectible down to the very last finger-lick. The fried okra....HELLLLOOOOOO yum. Thank you so much for doing this right! Perfectly seasoned, lightly breaded, crisp and not too slimy. Eff yes. The yeast rolls were tough (on multiple visits) and something I'd gladly give up for an additional side. My husband enjoys the beans, too - says they're just like home.   The yellow reusable cups are awesome because they help to reduce waste, and my husband loves to use them for water cups here at home. The beverages are self-serve so there are endless refills. What we love to do is use the cup at the end of the meal to get our free soft-serce icecream, and then fill the cup with root beer for a delicious root beer float for the road :)  The crew at Dickey's is topnotch. These guys know exactly what they're doing, and their customer service is outstanding. I love that they interact like best friends while providing an awesome experience for the customer.   We've recommended Dickey's time and time again, and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"Amazing food for a fast food BBQ......the pulled pork sandwich was so good. Loved the onion straws as well. My boyfriend had the ham an it was also great..love this place. Definitely going back.."}
{"text":"Gosh I have NO luck with this franchise. Came here just now and they tell everyone they're all OUT of RiBS!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ.  Good Beans.  OK mac & cheese. Good sweet tea. Small place but great for takeout."}
{"text":"People only review this place if they had a negative experience, so I'd take most of those negative reviews with a grain of salt. This place is constantly hiring new people, so it's only natural that some of them mess up sometimes. Eddie (the manager) is the nicest guy you'll ever meet and he is more than willing to make up for any mistakes new employees have made. Most of the workers there are super nice and friendly and are willing to chat with you while they prepare your order. The food is really high-quality, and I'm picky about my barbecue! Overall, this is a great restaurant I would highly recommend to anyone looking for some nice barbecue."}
{"text":"Music today: Todd Snider Johnny Cash Waylon Jenning Kid Rock (\"Picture\")  The sign is now up offering daily specials. I got the pork special today and the meat was moist and smoky.  My girl brings her people here and the people enjoy sharing how the staff knows her.  They keep it clean!  Bring yourself and your people here. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I've been to a few Dickey's and they're pretty consistent with what you get. I got a pound of brisket and 1/2 pound of pulled pork here and it was really good. A really nice smokey flavor on the brisket with some melty fat at the ends. Just how I like it. The pulled pork was good too. It was sweet enough it didn't need any sauce."}
{"text":"I was a little apprehensive when I came in at noon and there were only two people in here. Not a good sign. This place should probably invest some time in training their staff, because they were all over the place. There were three people working & they all must've been super bored cause instead of just one of them serving me, they all decided to talk over and interrupt each other when I was attempting to place my order. They were perfectly nice, but it was annoying that it was so hard to communicate with them, all talking at once. Food came out quickly, but I was a little shocked by the price considering it seems like a fast casual place. Anyway, I figured maybe they make up for it with big portions. Nope! I spent $12 on what looked like a kid's menu-sized pulled pork sandwich, a half cup of coleslaw, and a small drink (the drink was $1.50, sandwich $7 and side $2.50). Tasty, but definitely not worth $12. They had some daily meal deals, but I don't see why you couldn't get a sandwich & side combo going daily. That being said, It's got some nice decor, it's very clean, the staff was friendly (they just need to learn to take turns), and the pulled pork was pretty yummy."}
{"text":"Friendly service and tasty BBQ. I love the baked potato casserole and the pulled pork and brisket are always tender and flavorful. I'm looking forward to trying out the ribs soon."}
{"text":"Love this place the food taste awesome the service is always great.  Only downside is they ran out of ribs. Which I guess means they're so darn good everyone wants them. Yum."}
{"text":"This place is always packed at lunch... probably because the have great prices on their deal of the day! I just placed my 3rd catering order with Aaron. Their prices are phenomenal for bbq. Dine in when Mary is working the register.... it is a completely different atmosphere when she is off. Call ahead if you know what you want and skip the crazy long line!"}
{"text":"This was a great surprise first time experience.  The meats are moist smoky and full of flavor.  It's a good value and I'll be back for sure.  We had turkey and brisket with 2 sides.  The meats are sustainably sourced from better places, and the prices are low.  Nice variety on the menu too including tacos and sliders as options.  Employees were super friendly as well.  Just wonderful."}
{"text":"Great barbeque joint. I really love their pork and sausages. For sides, their fried okra is pretty good! They usually fry them upon ordering so although you have to wait a bit to get them, they're hot and crispy when you get them."}
{"text":"Just o.k. food and don't expect anything more. A bit on the disappointed side. Hard to believe that there is more than one of these restaurants here in Vegas. Must be a good sized chain because I saw a Dickies BBQ up in Billings Montana. It was half the size of this store. With that being said, it is safe to say that this place is spacious. Good friendly and helpful customer service."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place..  Very disappointed on the portion size of the food..  The menu claimed \" TEXAS SIZED\" that couldn't be further away from the truth.  More like mouse sized portions.   A little over priced for what you get. Brisket was a little dry what a let down.  I hope they improve soon.."}
{"text":"Called ahead and made a to-go order.  The food was hot and ready when we go there.  They  honored the \"Kids Eat Free\" promo on a to-go order, which many places would not do.  The staff was all so friendly and welcoming.  I had the sliced brisket, coleslaw and baked potato casserole and my son had the kids pulled pork and mac and cheese.  Everything was delicious!!! We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This was something great. Then you broke it.  This Dickie's location menu has changed dramatically. The only listed sides are waffle fries and okra. I do love their okra, but have no idea what \"foo foo\" seasoning is supposed to be. That's it. No beans, no slaw, no mac & cheese. Then, the coup de¬†gr√¢ce: the plates and sandwiches have all changed. My big pulled pork sandwich is no more. There is one similar, but it has a bunch of junk in it. Everything is now ala carte - no plates, no specials board.   I don't know what Dickie's had in mind making this change, but I no longer will patronize this location. In my opinion, this is a mistake for the business. My coworkers are also disappointed, as we visited at least once a week. Guess we're going somewhere else.   You've lost us Dickie's."}
{"text":"I finally tried Dickey's and I was not disappointed. Tried 1/2 lb. of pulled pork and 1/2 lb. of brisket. I enjoyed the brisket so much I went back the next day to enjoy some more!... had slaw and Mac n Cheese for the sides.. my new favorite bbq spot!"}
{"text":"I had the ribs with mac and cheese and baked beans. I was very surprised how great the ribs were. I can't believe I have not seen this place before now. It's been here for three years. I recommend this place hands down!!"}
{"text":"I had just driven my wife and daughter to the airport for them to have a weekend trip. I was so looking forward to having BBQ. I entered the store and the \"meat man\" was welcoming and explained the choices. So I got a multiple meat dinner with sides to go.   Get home and there is no BBQ sauce! I'm left with dry meat and no F$%^ing sauce!  I couldn't go back and resolve the situation. So my dog got a pulled pork and sliced brisket $14 dinner.  Contacted the HQ for Dickey's and after a month there is no response. Screw them and this chain."}
{"text":"What's NOT to love???  I have previously eaten Dickey's barbecue, at various catered events, but had never been into the restaurant until today.  The restaurant is very clean, wonderfully decorated, and the customer service is excellent.  The barbecue brisket and pulled pork is among the best I've ever had, and their sauces are the perfect addition.  The portions are generous.  I was talked into trying the mac-n-cheese by one of the ladies behind the counter, and I may now be hooked for life!  To top it all off, there is free ice cream in the lobby, but I was too full to try it.  Maybe next time!  I can hardly wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"Alexa is the best!!! All of the food was excellent, the best Texas BBQ I've had in years...besides my own!!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness gracious! In my opinion, they have really good barbecue and macaroni and cheese. I think that you should go here to eat dinner! They also have vanilla ice cream in a cone, it's yummy also! This place is very clean!    The staff there is also very nice and friendly, which is always a plus!"}
{"text":"Incredible food best BBQ in town. Highly rec!!! The mac and cheese is great. The employees were friendly. Price is very decent for what you get considering it is all fresh"}
{"text":"First time there. I have had much better else where. Honestly? Its fake BBQ. The meat taste like something they got from Safeway. It doesn't even look like chicken. Beans were gross. I can go on and on. Save your money, go else where."}
{"text":"My family and I all had the pulled pork sandwich with sides. Everything was cooked to perfection and tasted even better. The staff was very friendly and greeted every guest as they entered the front door. I couldn't be more happier about my visit. They've just earned a regular customer.   PS. Their meat locker is heaven!"}
{"text":"First time here and Last time here!! Been to many bbq places so had to try this one! Its a rip off and a joke!! Lol ordered 2 bbq sandwiches and two sides of beans!! Could not believe my eyes!! The sandwiches looked like an arby Jr sandwich!! And the beans were in a little dish!! All of it maybe enough to feed a 5 year old! The quantity of the food for the price is an outrage!!! 21.00 dollars!! For two small sandwiches and beans!! I could eat well in many other places!! Don't waste your money here folks!!!!"}
{"text":"Dickies has really good fried okra and tea, but their brisket is extremely dry and chewy. This has been the second time that I have had a brisket sandwich that was this way.  I'm disappointed because this is pretty close to our home."}
{"text":"$13.65 for lunch?  Really?  A pulled pork sandwich decidedly on the small size, two sides, and a drink?  Ok, I made the mistake of adding beans to the $9.99 lunch special.  They charge $2.50 for what must be .25 worth of beans.  The food was good, service fine, but seriously.  Lunch should be half this price.  I'll be going to Rudy's or Shanes or some other place that offers a better value and equal or better Q."}
{"text":"Had a daily special, brisket sandwich.  Not bad, tender, but not memorable either.  The fresh, HOT fried okra was the best part of the meal.  The other side was forgettable.  Dickeys is middle of the road, middle-priced bbq.  I'll report back later if I ever go back to try their ribs.  Service was good.  I'm sure plenty of folks would be just fine with this place; me, I want something above average."}
{"text":"Our new favorite spot. Im not a huge bbq lover and chain restaurants arent alwaus made with love. This team was great, kind and helpful on all levels. Great customer service and food. Very clean and organized. Their spicy bbq sauce tastes great with the beans, meat and rolls. Will def be back."}
{"text":"So last minute needed to order food. Tried to do UberEats but it would not work. So I called Dickey's and talked to Chris to place a pickup order. So glad I did. Just so nice to meet people that are busy but still pleasant to talk to and helpful. The food was AMAZING. We bought 2 of the XL family pack. Mac and cheese fantastic. Ribs GREAT. Cole slaw great. Mashed potatoes YUMMY. SAUCES love them. Thank you"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I had the beef brisket pulled and pulled pork sandwich. I will for sure come back again."}
{"text":"Oh Dickey's, you moving right next to my work has cost me. I'm addicted, and I always look forward to more.  I am always wary of chain barbeque joints; it's hard to find one that sticks out. However, Dickey's has impressed me time and time again. I always get the pulled pork sandwich with the original (and a tad bit of spicy) barbeque sauce. The pork is moist and the sauce is absolutely delicious. I don't have much to say for the sides however: they taste fine, but just that.  Prices: so cheap. I can walk away with a small sandwich for $5! For the cost, this barbeque is especially worth it. I can find myself eating here twice a week, and it's pretty difficult to stop. Parking is always available, and I've never seen a line longer than 5 minutes. The interior is clean (and always smells amazing).  Dickey's, you have my attention. I can't wait for more!"}
{"text":"We have loved Dickey's for years. The past couple of times we visited or had it delivered the brisket was very dry."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite. Nothing fancy, but the BBQ is really good. I don't recommend the sausage however, a bit too greasy without much flavor. Staff has always been friendly while we were there, so I wouldn't be hesitant to ask for advise. The texas BBQ beef tip has become my favorite. The rolls are fresh and super soft and if you're an okra fan (like my partner, not me) I'm told its excellent. We spend about $10 ea when we go. Recommended"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ!  Been going here for about a year and have not had a bad meal yet!  And the peach cobbler with ice cream is the BOMB!"}
{"text":"Update: I received a response from Dickeys, however that was the extent of it. An empty attempt to make things right. They asked me to provide my contact info so that they could make up for my horrible experience, but gave me no information on how to reach them."}
{"text":"Ordered take out and it was 20 minutes late.  Understandable with as busy as they were one table was filled with no food on the table just empty containers watching the World Series.  I assume they had been there a while.    Fried okra very small portion, nothing to rave about.  But they have a good ceaser salad, again very small.  The meat the pulled pork was actually shredded which I appreciate.  Just a little dry, very little smoke.  The chopped brisket was really dry, not quite leathery but close.  Again where is the smoke?  Okay marinated chicken is gonna make up for it.  The marinade shined through the absent smoke ring and again where is the smoke.  They had a smoker in there it must be broken.  Nothing made me even want to give this place another shot."}
{"text":"Ordered food online at 7:00 on 7/21, had left my house & was en route to pick up dinner for my family when I got a call from the manager, stating that they were out of just about everything that I had ordered and that they wouldn't be able to serve me today. I understand that BBQ places are notorious for running out of food, but if a place accepts online ordering, they should be able to fulfill their online orders.  He proposed I reschedule the take out order, which I had already paid for, to the next day and offered no reprive as to what I was to do that night for dinner. I ended up having to pick up dinner from another local restaurant becuse I had nothing ready to cook at home & it was already getting late.   I returned the next day to pick up the previous day's order and was treated like it was no big deal that it took them 24 hours to fulfill my online order. Took the food home (10 minute drive), both the chopped & regular brisket were dry to the point of shoe leather & weren't finished by my family, everything else was acceptable but not outstanding. We're living on a tight budget, as most people are these days, and dining out is a treat for us, not something we can do every day, so being forced to order out twice in one weekend not only put a strain on my budget, but the food I recieved wasn't even the treat that it was meant to be for my family. I was very disappointed in the service I recieved and lack of responsiveness of the employees to the issue when it arose; my family will not be returning again.  If you do want to give this place a shot, here's what we ordered & what my family thought of it:  Meats: Chopped brisket - Stringy & dry, had to be dipped in BBQ in order to eat it. Regular brisket - looked & tasted similar to beef jerkey,  Pulled Pork - Acceptable, but not outstanding, we've had better at most places in Phoenix & Gilbert. Ribs - This one bright spot. Meaty, membrane left on, but the smoking process made them taste more like ham than what you'd expect from ribs.  Sides: Mac & Cheese - Edible, middle of the pack among BBQ places, make sure to have pepper at the ready. Green Beans & Bacon - Nice change of pace from the rest of the food, as these tasted like they were steamed or boiled. Bacon seemed like an afterthought, but wasn't necessary. Baked Beans - Very smokey, almost too much. Pretty sure it was liquid smoke & not from their smoker. Potato Casserole - Mashed potato, cheese, bacon, and green onions. This was delicious, unfortunately, we had only ordered 1 helping of it & it was gone quickly.  If you are going to give Dickey's a shot, try the ribs & potato casserole, and call ahead to make sure they aren't going to be out of food when you get there."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and fantastic bbq. You will fall in love with the dill potato salad.  3 sauce options and many meat options it was hard to choose, so we tried them all. YUM!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ. Meat was cooked well, bbq sauces were delicious and there were a great variety of sides. Love that kids eat free on Fridays!"}
{"text":"Ehhhh. Ordered the 2 meat plate. Texas Brisket and Spicy Cheddar Links, Waffle Iron Fries and Mac N Cheese. The whole plate was cold the first time so I asked if they could warm it up and the remade it. The fries were just OK and they were the only good part. The texas brisket was just a pile of mushy fat and the links were gross and inedible. The mac n cheese was from a Kraft box for sure. Only reason for the 2 stars was the big drink and free ice cream. $25 for 2 people at a fast food BBQ place is a little bit too much. I'd go to Famous Dave's anytime over this establishment."}
{"text":"I sat here at this table thinking what I should write. I watch my cursor blink..blink...blink. So I had the 2 meat plate: ribs, brisket, jalape√±o beans, fried okra. The brisket was tender and fell apart. It was very good. And although the ribs were tender, there was something amiss for me on them today. But they were very good so I just must be tired of the heat outside to praise them today. Beans and okra were to be expected.  But something about my meal tasted off, can't put my finger on it but it hampered my review and rating. But I'd come back"}
{"text":"Went here tonight and saw they had taco's...thought great meat why not try the 3 taco special...wow what a disappointment...there was more meat on one slider my gf got than i had on all 3 tacos...and it was 8.50 for the taco special...what a shame because always have enjoyed the food here but this left me disappointed and after a movie got home and ate leftovers!  Won't be back anytime soon that's for sure..."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, but it has some flaws.  The smell of the meat cooking in smokers is overwhelmingly good and really makes you hungry.  I think if they could just improve the service the place would be better.  First of all the whole ordering thing is somewhat disturbing.  You stand in a line and tell some guy who is chopping the meat what you want for meat.  Then you stay in line and move on down to the next station where you tell them the sides.  I tried to tell the first guy my order and he almost bit my head off with a \"Tell that to her\".  Then you slide on down to the next station and wait in line to pay the money.  I was somewhat offended that you are talking to people working behind what seems like a wall that is almost 6' tall.  It's just plain weird.  This sort of concept might work if you had enough people working to handle the workload, but in this case the ordering and payment process took almost 10 solid minutes.  They need to rework this and have at least two registers, two people on meat, and two people on sides.  It also took 10 minutes more to actually get the food.  It was not that busy for the service to be this slow.  The people at the register seemed distracted and not fully engaged with the customers.  OK On to the food.  I ordered a daily special which on Friday is a Pulled Pork with two sides and a drink for about $8.99.    This is not a bad deal, but the regular prices are quite high in my opinion.  The pulled pork was tasty, but seemed a bit too mushy almost like they boiled it or added a bunch of water to it.  It's not quite the pulled pork that I expect.  The Mac&Cheese was quite good.  The potato salad was also pretty good.  I liked the sides better than the meal.  It also comes with a warm roll that I dipped in their BBQ sauce which was quite good.  I'd go back and give it another chance.  If they perform I reserve the right to add a star to my rating."}
{"text":"At Dickey's, you're not going to get the best tasting, fall off the bone, melt in your mouth, type ribs here.  What you will find at Dickey's is decent BBQ with super prices. When I think of Dickey's BBQ Pit, I think of having that \"wine taste, with the beer budget\".    Dickey's was a last minute decision for us.  We were looking for BBQ, but wanted somewhere quick and close to our current location.  Dickey's fit the bill.  I ended up getting their 2 Meat Plate which consisted of 4 oz of sliced beef briskets, 4 oz of chicken breast, waffle fries, and beans.  All of this was only $10.50, which is a steal of a deal to me.  As for taste, I've had better.  Both the briskets and chicken was a bit dry. However, a huge plus was that both were lower in calories than the other BBQ joints out here.  The waffle fries were also dry and the beans tasted like they were just out of a can.  The kids had good ol' fashion mac n cheese, but good was far from it.  Both teens stated that Kraft Mac N Cheese was better.  Looking for great tasting BBQ, Yelp other places around town or go somewhere else. Looking for quick BBQ and cheap prices, then give Dickey's a shot.   PS:  Was overcharged close to $10 on both Mac's.  The Manager took care of the issue by crediting my debit card.  My advice, check your bill."}
{"text":"Yum! The BBQ is delicious, great prices and the staff is friendly! I had the brisket and pulled pork and it was so good.."}
{"text":"I am a Dickey's regular. The food is seriously way good. But every time I come to this location, I'm very disappointed by the poor service. And I have visited this location a number of times. The people behind the counter are inept...They are completely incapable of seeing a need and responding to it appropriately. I brought my wife here for her first Dickey's experience (poor decision on my part - she's not a fan of bbq to begin with). She will probably never come back again with me. Here's a list of annoying things that happened on this visit:  1) We waited in an average sized line for a much longer than average amount of time.   2) The guy behind the counter screwed up my order after I repeated it to him twice, and he repeated it back to me.   3) I ordered a side of jalape√±o beans and the girl only filled the cup half-way.   4) The tray that my food was on was filthy and greasy.   5) The restaurant was in a dire need of cleaning and upkeep...the floors were disgusting, the trash needed to be emptied, the drink fountain was gross, the bbq sauce station needed to be wiped down, and tables were not being cleared after people left.   6) The ice cream was out - the only thing my wife was excited about.   7) You might be thinking \"Maybe they were just short-staffed.\" Nope. As we were walking out the door, I just happened to notice one of the employees sitting on his duff, taking a break while all of the above stated issues went unattended.   This seems to only be a problem at this location. Whoever the Owner is, they seriously need to reconsider their staffing decisions. I will continue to go to Dickey's but will avoid this location whenever possible.    UPDATE 4/14/15:  I sent a personal message to Dickey's B. per the request in their reply below. It has been 3 weeks and I have not heard back from them. In all fairness, I have not been back to this Dickey's location to see if they have addressed the concerns listed above. But my above review will stand until I either have received a response from them or I go back to this location to see if it's any better."}
{"text":"Found this place accidently. Awesome atmosphere, very family friendly. Clean, relaxed environment great for kids. Food smells fantastic. I ordered the popular Brisket Mac Stack. Offers military discount and free ice cream that is lactose free. Check this place out, they have multiple locations in the valley."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place and I really like it! The food is fairly consistent but depending on the day and time you go and who's in the kitchen, you might get a drier or a fattier brisket, an overcooked or undercooked turkey breast, etc. The meat combo plates are a great way to try different items and are perfect for someone as indecisive as I am. I adore the green beans with bacon side and I usually get a double order. The chopped brisket is the best thing here, followed by the chicken breast. The turkey has been hit or miss and the sausages are just \"okay.\"  All drinks come in a big, sturdy plastic yellow cup. They have sweet and unsweetened tea and free pickles and ice cream (eat 'em together or separately, whatever floats yer boat). Not much atmosphere to speak of but I like how you order, pay, and a runner brings your food to the table. You fix your own drinks."}
{"text":"Sooooo delicious!!! We ordered a pound and a half of their pulled pork and it was amazing! This was our first time and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent pork sandwich..hot, fresh with good flavor. Nice interior, clean and well decorated. The only downfall.. very under staffed. Incoming phone orders was annoying since no one picked up the calls...so the phone rang constantly while one of the employees in the kitchen was apparently on the phone texting with no concern to answer the phones. Solve this issue.. and all would be great."}
{"text":"Very disappointing visit today. This establishment used to be a good place to eat. First, the guy behind the counter had a long nasty beard that should have been covered by a net so hair doesn't fall into people's food. Second, the salt & pepper shakers were sticky and covered with grime. Third, the lady working there, who appeared to be a manager, sat the cups to put bbq sauce in on the top of a disgusting trashcan before she put them were they belonged on the counter. And lastly, the place was just filthy and the food was mediocre. Sadly I will not be visiting Dickeys again."}
{"text":"Having been a fan, and this a weekly habit - particularly when the Batali farmers market was just over the bridge, it pains me to say that Dickey's has become a sad caricature of itself...dry, tasteless, bbq, stale bread, bad sides... ugh.  The best part of going is getting their perfect ice in a giant yellow cup to make a DIY muddy water with their freshly brewed tea.  I used to love the pork.  no more.  I thought the turkey worthy of the trip; not any longer.   The stuff they pass of as free ice cream?  bad icemilk on a good day.  Service?  no.  Sticky tables?  yes.    I've pretty much given up on the idea of finding good genuine bbq in town.  I'd even settle for genuine, imitation, real pit bbq... (an inside joke for my dearly departed mother...)"}
{"text":"The foods not bad. The prices are reasonable. But I will never go there again. I ordered a kids meal since I had weight loss surgery and they refused to serve me. I explained my situation to the girl @ the register and even showed the card the surgeon gave me for this situation,but she said she'd get in trouble. I asked for a mgr and was told there wasnt one. Hard to believe no mgr at lunch time. I sent a email to their corportate officr and never recieevd a response"}
{"text":"The service was great! We ordered the XL Family pack and it was ready in 10 min. We ordered sliced brisket, pulled pork, spicy cheddar sausage for the meats and for the sides, waffle fries, mac and cheese, fried okra and baked beans. It also came with fresh pickles, onions, bread, and a lot of BBQ sauce!!  Great amount of food if you're feeding 5.  We felt the sliced brisket and pulled pork was a lil dry and the okra needed more seasoning like more salt but it was still good. I wasn't a fan of the bread. It was a lil on the doughy side. We did love the spicy cheddar sausage, mac and cheese, and the spicy bbq sauce!"}
{"text":"The service I received on a pickup order today was beyond amazing. I wish I had written down the names of the two young ones that were working today because they deserve an immense amount of praise. It's the day after Thanksgiving, so of course no one really wants to be working today, but these two were smiling and courteous with everyone in there and I commend them for it. That's not even the part that impressed me the most, however. When I got in, I let them know I was there to pick up an order. After checking, they let me know they were still working on the order and it would only be a few more minutes. I didn't think anything of it because I was early to pick it up, and they let me have free ice cream, which is more than I've ever been offered anywhere else. I'm already smiling, but it gets even better. Within a few short minutes, they have my order ready to go. I'm told that they gave me an extra order of fries for making me wait...which I didn't really even do. This part blew me away. This is stellar customer service. Not because I got free food, but because they set such high expectations of themselves, that no reasonable person could be upset if they ended up coming up short by their own measure. I really left with a genuine smile that day. I wish I had left a bigger tip or something. If the owner of this establishment is reading this, I want you to know that the two that you had working on 11/24/2017 around 1:30PM are amazing and you did a great job in choosing them to represent your chain. Please give them a raise, a day off, or SOME sort of commendation. They really deserve it."}
{"text":"Great BBQ,  Texas style!  Meat would have given 5 stars, but no bottled water and no table service..  A nice variety of good tasting sides. Will come back, easy to get to."}
{"text":"No ribs how crazy is that for a bbq place. Will never come h ere again . The ribs are why u ou go to Dickeys"}
{"text":"They also go above and beyond on service.  I showed up at this store thinking I put in a catering order and my mistake I placed it at a different store, they had not problem hurrying up getting me all the meat I needed and canceling the other stores order for me.  Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Always a fan of Dickeys. Good daily specials. Sweet tea is great. Fried okra, potato salad, baked beans are all good. Usually get pulled pork or beef brisket, both are excellent with the spicy BBQ sauce they have fresh and warm. Don't forget your ice cream cone on the way out."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place but sadly the meat was very bland and they didn't offer any sauces. The only thing I did enjoy and would go back for is the fried okra, greenbeans and the sweet tea."}
{"text":"Not sure what was worse the BBQ or the attitudes of the employees. Being a chain restaurant I am going to give you the quick review.   Brisket - It's okay. Barely any smoke ring and no bark as they scrape it off. Pass if you want good brisket. Strike1  Ribs - The must of found the worst time to give me the part of the ribs that should be trimmed off before smoking as they will burn and be over done. Guess what burnt and over done. Strike 2   Sausage -  Although Jalapeno Cheese sausage tasted best of the whole meal it's texture was a bit funky. Strike 3  Employees - These people had awful attitudes. Sorry that I bothered you by ordering food and trying to pay for it. The guy cutting the brisket was clueless. I asked for a certain cut and it was like he either didn't know what I was talking about or didn't care.   Won't be going back here. They are OUT!!!!"}
{"text":"1st try, the line was to the door at 1:30. Somebody likes this place. Walked out due to no time.  2nd try, no one ahead of me or behind me. Felt rushed to order. The dude kept yelling to the crew as I was ordering. Had to repeat myself. Confusing process. He didn't point out the daily special.   Fries cold and undercooked (soggy). Chicken dry. Rest average.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm from Texas and grew up eating and making BBQ, so we're always looking for amazing BBQ anywhere we go. I've tried a few in Vegas and only like one other place in north Vegas (a small drive through place), but today we decided to try Dickie's for Mother's Day because my mom wanted ribs for lunch.   We almost decided to go to a chain place, but we knew it was going to be busy. I'm SO glad we decided instead to go here-- a small business, family friendly, clean, fast and super generous spot.   The employees were amazing! They were so nice, making recommendations, giving us honest opinions/samples about the food, and being very amenable when we changed an order. All 3 employees behind the counter were friendly and went out of their way to ensure we were satisfied. Plus, Sundays, kids eat free!   I paid about $40 for 3 adults and 2 kids. And we had plenty leftovers. The adults had the 3 meat combo and a rib plate. The baked potato casserole and fried okra sides were awesome. You could actually taste the okra. They weren't over fried and greasy. The fries also were nice--the oil for the fried stuff was not old or overwhelming.    Even the kids apologized for thinking they weren't gonna like it. They both had the chicken nuggets and mac & cheese with a drink. For dessert, there's free soft serve ice cream. This place was almost perfect.   The only thing I didn't like was a huge Ronald Reagan photo on the wall. I'm assuming with the owner. I'm not a republican and not a fan of this racist, classist president. Although all the workers were white and most of the patrons as well, they were all nice. So I hope Reagan is not representative of the politics or bias of the owner. You have to be careful with what message you send to customers of color."}

{"text":"I have been to Dickey's a couple of times though it had been a while between visits.  I don't honestly remember much about the first time I ate here.  I think I liked it OK.  I just never came back because I'm not usually in the area.  But I was in the area this last weekend and BBQ was sounding pretty good.    I was in on Saturday and the daily special was a chopped brisket sandwich, two sides and a big yellow cup (drink).  I ordered BBQ beans and potato salad for my sides.  The entire order was up very quickly.  I was almost disappointed with the apparent size of my meal for the $10 and change I paid.  I was mistaken though.  The sandwich was actually filling on its own.  With the beans and potato salad being as heavy and dense as they are by their very nature, I was more than full when lunch was done.  And it was all good food.  I could taste the smoke in the brisket and it was chopped wel enough that it was easy to eat.  I generally prefer sliced brisket but its not a deal breaker to have it chopped.  The beans were awesome.  Full flavored with a bit of spice.  Mixing in some BBQ sauce elevates them to that next level.  The potato salad was about the most average part of my meal.  There was nothing wrong with it but it didn't stand out in any way either.  Just your run of the mill deli style potato salad.  I might go with another side like green beans and bacon next time.  I don't usually come to this part of the valley but next time I do, if I am in the mood for BBQ, I may just cruise in for a bite.  The price is fair and the food is good."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is incredible.. like on par with joes BBQ good! The prices are very reasonable , and there is a daily special where the drink is included for $9.99. Love the fact that the cups are reusable . My husband and I ordered the daily special which was a sandwich and 2 sides . We both chose the BBQ brisket sandwich . My sides were green beans and creamed spinach. Both very so good! The green beans were so flavorful with chunks of onion , garlic and  of course bacon . Creamed spinach was just like grandma used to make . My husband had the potatoe salad and Mac & cheese. He loved his sides and said he would definitely order this again. Oh they also offer kids eat free nights ! Such a deal"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we found this place! Its great for quick quality BBQ.  We both ordered the 2 meat plate ...brisket was delicious and flavorful and not full of fat. Pork was great with the BBQ sauce. Plenty of food to leave me very full.  And they have FREE vanilla ice cream which my boyfriend was very happy about. We will probably be back next week!"}
{"text":"First time to dine at this location.   We just moved back to Ohio from California. The service was good and quick. Restaurant was clean. We will definitely eat here again and again and again ...."}
{"text":"Not good! I had such high hopes for this place, but it was a real let down. We had the 2 meat combo plate with Texas chopped brisket and ribs. The brisket was moist, but lacked flavor and the sauce on the side overwhelmed it. The ribs were probably some of the worst I have ever had! The back membrane was not removed (a novice move in my opinion) and they were so salty you could babrely eat them. And I am a huge fan of salty food! There was also harldy any meat on them and the outside was so tough I had to spit a few pieces out. I had coleslaw and waffle fries. My partner had mac n cheese and onion tanglers. The waffle fries were ok, nothing special, but I had joked about how I wondered if they got the coleslaw and mac n cheese at the KFC that is across the street as it tasted just like theirs! The onion tanglers were horrible!!! Basically onion strings only a bit fatter. They were way over done and both of us still have heartburn and upset stomachs 3 days after eating there! What a let down!"}
{"text":"I have to say not bad at all for a chain BBQ joint. BBQ had a good taste to it but what got me was the sides we got was very good, I really liked the baked potato casserole. You also get to take home the drink cups which are hard plastic cups, I know it's the little things! Service was good but they could use a lesson on when to not talk out loud when customers are in the place. But I would go back again for sure. They also play awesome music from TX over the store."}
{"text":"I dropped by this place for dinner. I ordered:  2 Meat Platter: beef brisket, sausages, dinner roll, some bean chili like thing, onion rings Total: $11-12  The service is friendly and good. They brought out everything without the roll and promptly informed me that it was in the oven, toasting up. They brought it out soon after.  Also, there was definitely Wi-Fi. I wasn't sure if it was from the restaurant itself, but my laptop connected to something and I was able to read my emails.  As for the food. I'm sorry to say it was unlike the service. The beef brisket was very dry. Not jerky dry, but it was kind of like a powdery dry. The sausage was a sausage, kind of smoky, spicy and sweet. The bean chili was very sweet (and some people like my mother would love it). The bread, was soft and airy. It reminded me of a roll I might find at \"Texas Roadhouse\" with a slight baking powder flavor (it's like a pancake's aftertaste). Everything was fine, until I started the onion rings. It was not fried right. It was definitely very crispy but also pretty oily in a bad way. I wasn't sure if it was just the onions inside the batter that was giving me issues, so I laid it out on my napkin. It left a rather noticeable oil ring.  All in all, I get the feeling they are still learning the franchise's instructions. However, I'm going to have to have to say that the service was not horrible. I'm going to let some time pass before I give them a try again. Those onion rings..."}
{"text":"BBQ fast food at its finest. Better than most BBQ places in Las Vegas . Recommend the Westerner sandwhich"}
{"text":"Meats were all good (pulled pork, polish sausage, jalape√±o cheddar sausage, and turkey were what we had), sauces were on the side and you could choose how much to put on.  Sides ranged from mediocre to bad...green beans with bacon were canned beans and had no bacon taste, creamed cheesy spinach was pretty awful.  My plan next time would be to just get meat to go and go home and do sides."}
{"text":"So, BEST pulled pork hoagie that I've had so far! I keep coming back for it and find myself craving it often! Their spicy BBQ sauce is the best BBQ sauce I've ever had! Can't get enough! Oh and free ice cream?! YUM!"}
{"text":"I got the 3 meat plate (beef brisket, polish sausage and ribs) and I have to be honest it wasn't very good.  The brisket was good, sausage very boring and the ribs were below average.  No flavor.  The mac n cheese was like a creamy soup and they were small shells.  I got the waffle fries and they were lame.  Best thing I had was the biscuit they include with every meal (I guess).  Over all I would put this as the worst BBQ restaurant I have had in all of Vegas.  Its near K's BBQ which I used to drive all the way across town for.  Between these 2 restaurants you have a good representation of how you can F up BBQ.  Avoid this place."}
{"text":"Just left this place because the guy at the front was an asshole. Came in and said hello and he just looked at me. It was our first time there so we were looking at the menu and he rudely said, \"Are you guys gonna come up?\" (Meaning the counter) We asked him what was good and he said everything in a condescending tone. I looked at my husband and told him I wanted to leave. Why work at a customer service establishment if you're going to be rude and miserable. Never coming back! Too bad I didn't get his name so I could add it on here."}
{"text":"It is a great place to grab a bite. I enjoy the food, I wish they would give you more pickles but I  have never asked so I don't know that they won't. They have kids eat free on Sundays which is a perk for us. The best part of Dickey's is the staff, they are so funny and kind. The gentlemen who do the chopping are always friendly and it makes it a nice environment."}
{"text":"Cheap bbq and free ice cream and free pickles!  When I'm pregnant I imagine I'll be frequenting this place a LOT more.  The staff let me order the three-meat platter when I can't decide on what to choose from.  The three-meat platter isn't on the menu but it exists!  I just love Dickie's!  My boyfriend introduced it to me because he and his coworkers frequent Dickie's for their lunch specials.  I had to check it out to make sure they didn't have hot servers or slutty cashiers.  They didn't so I can breath relief.  There are not servers btw- it's a casual place where you get in a line and order your food and then you can pick a table and eat without anyone bothering you.  I love to come to Dickie's after a hard day of outlet shopping.  My boyfriend says when we have kids we will be here on Sundays a lot because kids eat free; fine by me because I hate cooking all the time."}
{"text":"Worst catering experience ever. Not on time and didn't prepare what was ordered. Owner was rude and didn't respect our organization. The food is good, but I will never order from Dickey's in Tempe again."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Lady that help us was very nice. Atmosphere was great. Their sauces are outstanding! Prices were about what my expectation was. Only complaint is from the counter to the table my meats were both cold... It was disappointing. I will give it another go around though!"}
{"text":"Twice I was overcharged. The first time I thought it was an honest mistake but the second time the girl lied and when I was owed 8 dollars back and change and she tried to give me $2 dollars and change, I asked for my full twenty dollars back and left. More stores are trying to take advantage of the customer like this place.  I was me bring a purchased cup back in for their deal towards a discount. If you bring a refill cup in, the refills are supposed to be $1.0, not $2.75. I was charged inaccurately both times. The brisket is okay but the hassle of employees and the look down upon your attitude towards customers will not work for me.  WAY OVERPRiCED with poor service."}
{"text":"This is some of the best Barbecue I have had in a long time. Frank and Nick helped us with our choices and made sure we knew what we were asking for. We ordered the Chicken and the Beef Brisket plates. At first I thought the 1/3 lb platter looked small, then I started to eat the food and could not finish my meal. Believe me , I wanted to. It was much more than I could finish. The pricing is a little high, but well worth the value. I will definitely be back to try the other selections. Try it, you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"My wife took my daughter and me here for a Father's Day lunch.  It was fantastic.   I got the 3 meat platter, my wife a pulled pork sandwich,  and my daughter got chicken nuggets.   I got beef brisket, pulled pork, and spicy cheddar sausage.   I had fries, and macaroni and cheese side dishes.   It was delicious.   My daughter had vanilla ice cream for dessert.   Every thing was so good. It was all what I wanted.   We will return some day soon."}
{"text":"Great place to eat . Good service . Will come back many times. We have been looking for a place where they have Great brisket..... Found it .... The two lady's that helped yes are soo nice too. So good went twice in one day ... Only hope one day they will have Tender pastrami... (sandwiches)"}
{"text":"Horrible experience!!   First I ordered my meal which was delivered with half the meat being fat and gross. It then was also missing the side order of potato casserole. This meal was to feed my kids after getting home from a long day. So I called the place to speak to a manager and a female answered the phone. Her name is Jayla Fountain or something like this THREATENING me like she was a gangster gang banger. I have NEVER as a customer been spoken to in such a manner. She literally told me \"Come down here!\" In a threatening manner. I finally spoke to Dylan after being hung up on by her 2 times and he was very nice. He wanted to fix the issue but my fear of the unprofessional employee threatening me made me fear what she would do to the food I feed my kids. I never went back nor would I again. Do yourselves a favor.... Hire good employees who treat your customers well instead of TRASH!"}
{"text":"Agh the Barbeque wasn't all that. Even drowned in sauce the meat was dry. It had the taste and texture as if it was cooked the day before and warmed up for service. It was a bit chewy and the meat itself lacked flavor."}
{"text":"This place sucks. The service sucks, the employees suck,  the BBQ sucks, the BBQ sauce sucks, even the BBQ sauce holding cups suck, the beans are from a can. If you want really good BBQ in surprise go to Got Q. The food at Got Q is amazing, the service is amazing, and the owner and staff are extremely friendly. Dickies BBQ pit is more like shitty dickies. The BBQ is horrible, very fatty and undercooked."}
{"text":"I can't lie - I was a little skeptical of fast food barbecue. There are plenty of sit-down barbecue restaurants that don't get it quite right, and I've been burned by some fast food BBQ before (looking at you, DFW airport Salt Lick).   Dickey's is by no means the best barbecue I've ever had, but for something so quick I'd definitely stop again.   When we went in on a Sunday afternoon there was one person working and he was knowledgable, friendly, and didn't seem to mind that it took my friend and I literally 5 or 6 minutes to make a decision. She asked what he thought of the cheddar sausage and he offered her a piece to try. So, so helpful (and it ended up being what she ordered).   I went for the Sunday special - a pulled pork sandwich, two sides, and a 32 oz. drink for about $10. You get enough food to make two meals, and the to-go cup is sturdy so even though it's ridiculously large if you go for a non-carbonated beverage you've got a leftover drink to go with your leftover food.   Pulled pork sandwich: soft bun, tender meat. Not a lot of bark which is my favorite part - I'm sure I can ask for a little more of the outside in my meat selection next time. I saw the chunk of pork when I rounded the corner to pay, and it had a nice dark coating so they're not just throwing a chunk of meat in a crock pot.   Sauces: I tried both the original and spicy and couldn't decide which I liked more so I just alternated bites. Beware the pumps - the sauce is kept heated and my arm got splattered with hot sauce. They do have warnings but I didn't see it until after.   Mac & cheese: very creamy, good cheese flavor, slightly mushier noodles (but not like, KFC/frozen mushy), and generally reminded me of a less-processed-tasting Velveeta shells and cheese. It's not going to wow you, but so many similar mac and cheese have no texture to the noodles and are seriously flavorless so I will give them a pass. I would choose it again for a side.   Baked potato casserole: I almost went for the BBQ beans but this sounded unique so I went with it. It's a scoop of mashed potatoes topped with some shredded cheddar and green onions. I'm not a big green onion fan and these were potent. I had to scrape most of them off. The cheese isn't enough to add anything. The mashed potatoes were tasty, but just that - mashed potatoes. I was definitely expecting something a little chunkier and more exciting with maybe sour cream and bacon. I'd eat the potatoes again but probably skip the toppings.  Drink: in addition to your regular fountain choices they do have lemonade, iced tea, and sweet tea. I went with the lemonade; it had a vaguely chemical taste that got better as ice melted into it. It's not a housemade, it's whatever comes on the Coke product lineup.   Ice cream: when you dine in, you're welcome to a soft-serve vanilla ice cream cone. Cake cones are in a dispenser and you serve yourself. I am a sucker for soft-serve, even when the mix has an artificial vanilla taste. Pull the lever up harder than you think - there's room for some movement in a slot that the handle goes through, but that's actually sort of a hook mechanism - pulling to the top of the slot isn't enough, you have to pull up the whole thing.   There aren't any to-go containers out, so if you are confident you aren't going to finish your meal and want the leftovers, ask them to package it to go or ask for a box when you get your food - there was a line when we were ready to leave so it took a few to get a box."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and delicious food! Came here with my toddler for lunch.  Loved the decor and very clean inside. I was surprised at how large it was inside and you smell the smoked meats right when you walk in. I will be back!"}
{"text":"i will make it brief.    best bbq by far in las vegas      i'm from the south where      bbq is king"}
{"text":"I'm usually a fan of this BBQ chain. The food was on par and the service okay. However this location is pretty run down. It's hot and they have a loud mobile AC unit. The place seems grimier then others.   Worth going to if you're nearby but not a special trip."}
{"text":"I think Dickeys is the bomb. When I first discovered this place I came like several times in one week. I didn't realize it was a chain at first but I think it's pretty damn good for a chain. You get a TON of food regardless of what \"plate\" you get. The beef brisket is really good but the pulled pork is my fave. The best sides in my opinion are the mac and cheese and the coleslaw. I got the fried okra several times and wasn't a big fan but maybe I just went on the wrong days because I gave it one more try the last time I went and it was really good. They have 3 different types of BBQ sauce: regular, sweet, and spicy. The spicy is my favorite but they're all really good. This is a great place to get takeout and to go in and sit (it would be even better if they delivered...) and if you dine in there's a little froyo machine. They run Groupons a lot and when they do I buy several! Also, this is a good place to go when you want all the fatty sides and a roll and all that stuff but I've been doing the slow carb diet and you can come here and get the meat plates without any carbs or bad sides (they have green beans as a side). Get a yellow cup because you can keep bringing it back. But maybe you should keep it in your car or something because we have about 15 of those cups and every time we get there we realize we forgot them...."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at a Dickey's and it was very disappointing.  I placed my order online for pickup. The website was easy enough to use and I chose a pickup time. I arrived at the restaurant 2 minutes after my pickup time and my order had not even been started. As a matter of fact, my order was still on their printer and not even looked at yet. It took about 10-15 minutes for them to make my order.  Why bother having people choose a pickup time?  The food itself was not impressive.  I had the brisket sandwich w/waffle fries.  There was not a lot of meat and it was very dry.  It tasted like it had been sitting around for a while.  The waffle fries were borderline under cooked and soggy.  My wife had the two meat plate (chicken and brisket).  The chicken was ok (a little dry) and she found her brisket to be very fatty (and also dry). Her sides (mac & cheese and jalapeno beans) were ok.  The order was filled mostly correct, except we paid for a cornbread muffin which was not included. The above order (plus a grilled cheese sandwich for my son) came to about $35 with no drinks or dessert.  Based upon the quality and quantity of food it was just not worth it."}
{"text":"Seen this place and I kept saying I have to try it, finally I did. I had the ribs and some okra. By far the best okra I've had, fries fresh when I ordered it. The ribs were awesome too, St. Louis style. They have 3 bbq sauces, original (Dickey's), sweet and spicy. All 3 are amazing, spicy being my favorite. Friendly staff. Recomend it not just for thw food but very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Food is good, located in a gas station with a couple of tables Had a (2) combo plates about $10 each, decent value Plan to return"}
{"text":"Love the decor and the service was attentive, personal and good, BUT none of these can be eaten. We tried the pulled pork and brisket sandwiches with sides of mustard based potato salad, Cole slaw  and fried Okra. The Cole slaw was tasteless, the potato salad looked like it was made with instant potatoes and the fried Okra was hot on the outside and still frozen in the middle. The pulled pork was mushy and I was surprised when my wife said she liked it. My  brisket was way over cooked  and sliced as thin as sandwich meat. The buns were so doughy that neither of us had more than a bite of them. The three sauces weren't anything extra. I combined a spoon of the normal, a touch of the sweet and 3 spoons of the spicy on my overcooked brisket. I did try a taste of the sweet tea and that was very good. The sauce dispenser was seriously drip covered and I watched 4 employees walk by it without stopping to clean it, so I took some napkins (they are cool) and cleaned the dispenser.. Again no employees saw or said anything."}
{"text":"The brisket was amazing. We had 1lb of sliced and a brisket sandwich. This place hit the spot, craving some BBQ from back home in Louisiana, couldn't have been better. They had my food done well before the estimated delivery time as well."}
{"text":"We ordered Dickey's through Uber eats.  Food was very good and huge portions.  I was not expecting to receive as much as I did.  The meat was good and their bbq sauce just added to the flavor.  They also took the time to read the extra requests on the ticket and went above and beyond to meet expectations.   Thank you so much!    Highly recommend Dickey's BBQ."}
{"text":"Love this place!  We have been here a few times within the first week of opening because we have been missing some good BBQ nearby.    So far our favs are the chopped brisket, pulled pork, Mac n cheese and potato salad.   You can't forget the free ice cream cones!"}
{"text":"Had the classic pulled pork sandwich w/ bbq beans and Mac & Cheese.   Sandwich was really good; loved the warm sauce!  Mac and cheese was pretty tasty.  Beans could use some flavor. Sizes of portions could be better. Also? The staff wasn't very friendly, so minus one star for that.  I mentioned it was my first time there and they couldn't have cared less. The whole service process felt like I was interrupting their day. You'd think they'd be more welcoming and explain the menu, etc.  Maybe that costs extra?"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! I used to get the half rack of pork ribs and they were delicious, but a little pricey. Since then I have graduated to the \"Deal of the Day\". I typically come in on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Let me tell you this is a literally smokin' deal. You get two meats of the day plus two sides of your choice, pickle, onion, a roll and a large drink. This is for about $9. The meats are just incredible. Pulled pork, cheesy sausage, pork ribs, you name it. Strangely, I have never availed myself of the free soft-serve ice cream, but I know it's there if I want it. The location is excellent: near campus, but off the beaten path of Mill Avenue, so you won't be tripping over dirty hippies on your way in the door."}
{"text":"First time we've tried Dickey's BBQ.  It a nice restaurant in our neighborhood and the patio is on the east side so it's shady in the evenings.  My wife and I both had the sliced brisket and it was really good - tender and with good smoked flavor.  I also had the turkey and it was equally good.  Besides the flavorful meats, the fried okra was also very good.  We'll both cone back!"}
{"text":"MEATS: The beef brisket is moist and tender, I just wish it has bit smokier flavor. The ribs are tender, juicy, finger licking good. The spicy cheese sausage has a nice kick (although a bit greasy and not as smoky as I want). SIDES: The side are tried are: fried okra - delicious, crispy and not greasy, Mac and cheese (very good according to my daughter. Once more, she did not share), fried onion tanglers - cut small and flavorful, potato salad - has dill flavor which I like.  Ordering is a breeze. Staff are nice and helpful. Place is small but clean. Will be back.   TIPS: Kids eat FREE Sundays. Yay! They have a FREE self serve soft serve ice cream. Yay!"}
{"text":"One must rate a place fairly.  This is a fast food BBQ.  Its not going to taste amazing, Its mass produced fast food after all.  The sauce is alright.  The meats tend to be a bit dry, but the sauce helps.  For fast food, this place is pretty expensive.  $11 for a sandwich, 2 sides, and a soda.  Waffle fries are pretty good.  The soda cups are made of a pretty thick plastic; I take them home and reuse them."}
{"text":"Not impressed. Ordered over the phone the 2 mean plate. I chose Pulled pork and Chicken. I get there to pick up my order and they tell me they have sold out of both. So I choose two other meat options. Again I am informed that those have sold out too. So I asked them what they did have and was informed they had brisket and ribs. Alright I can do that. but, I was irritated I couldn't choose what I really wanted.  Ribs had okay flavor but lacked something and was a little too tough. The brisket was mostly fat and nothing else. what meat I did have was tough and un-flavorful.  I most likely wont be going here again."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for a while.. I finally decided to go to the asu campus location, sadly I was very disappointed.. I was craving the rib plate and when I placed my order , I was told they were sold out of ribs and chicken... At this point I was tempted to leave ,however I decided to go with the bbq ham... Let me tell you that was a joke... It was basically ham with some bbq sauce in a little container.. They didnt even give me enough bbq sauce for the ham... I had two sides with the order .. the bbq bake beans were okay, I've had better and the potatoes salad was mediocre as well.. Overall I wouldn't ever go there again and I suggest you save your money as well."}
{"text":"My husband and I just stopped here for a late lunch. The food is delicious and the manager and workers were very friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"this was my first experience with this restaurant. I placed an online order, and it's supposed to track it and tell you the process; if it's ready to pick up, in the oven, etc. I placed my order at 6:35 and it said it should be ready at 7pm. At 7pm it said the order was still \"in cue\". So I tried calling. The phone number doesn't work and hangs up on you automatically. So I drove there (it is now an hour past the time I placed the order). I talked to someone up front (who was nice and helpful) and he had someone else come out to talk to me. Wouldn't really listen to me telling them the online system was clearly not working, as well as the phones, kind of just blew me off and then handed me my food. My food was cold, and is missing part of my order. I am literally never coming back here. But shoutout to the nice kid who apologized to me."}
{"text":"Everything is amazing here! The food is exceptional, the sauces to choose from are endless and there's a frozen yogurt machine in the store for self serve at no charge. My fianc√© gets the ribs while I get the pulled pork and the fried okra. Oh, the fried okra...deliciousness. Staff is very friendly, service is fast and efficient. Go here. It'll be your new \"spot.\""}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ! Not a huge selection but the quality is fantastic and you can't beat free ice cream :)"}
{"text":"FOLLOW-UP: I have always had a genuine desire to support local businesses in my area, especially when the economy took such a hit a few years back. After an initial disappointment here, I did something I usually don't do whenever I have a bad experience at restaurant: I went back (SEVERAL times, mind you) just to see if things would improve... Staff training, customer service, consistency: I never blame the staff whenever any of these things is lacking as it ALWAYS starts at the top... \"They just opened, they're probably still ironing things out, don't give up on them, give the place a chance\": That is what I said to myself after the first time... And the second time... And the third time... In the end, I gave this place MULTIPLE opportunities to get it right & at this point I sadly have to say that it's a lost cause. My most recent order contained undercooked meat (a taste that i'm VERY familiar with from back when I was first learning how to cook)... For those who don't know what undercooked meat tastes like (chicken, specifically), you bite into it & it tastes like you're chewing on wet/slimy rubber: That is what I received today, & to say that i'm disgusted would be an understatement. It's one thing when you're a newbie cook, stumbling your way through the learning process... But when you're a PROFESSIONAL food establishment like this, you don't undercook meat, period (especially chicken). As I type this, i'm sitting here with an upset stomach, praying to God that I don't get sick (although it may be too late). If there's anything positive here, it would be the fact that I never had a chance to bring my family/friends here &/or place a big catering order (all of which I was eventually planning to do, had \"Dickey's\" finally gotten it right). I am truly saddened as I really had high hopes for this place with it being one of the new spots in the neighborhood, but when you've had more bad experiences vs good, it's pretty much a sign that you need to leave it alone (& NO food is worth ending up in the hospital over, no matter how good it might look/smell/etc). At the end of the day, you'll have to make the decision as to whether or not your health & well-being is important: If it is, i'd steer clear of this place based on my most recent (& final) experience here. I'd feel terrible if I saw the news, heard that someone died after eating here & I knew that I never at least made an effort to share my most recent experience: This is the ONLY reason why i'm taking the time to share, so that I can have closure/peace & move on. Goodluck & Godspeed in any event."}
{"text":"Been to this place Several times always good BBQ and good service.Reasonably priced as well .they also have food to go.Would strongly recommend this place ."}
{"text":"Be ready for the slowest service in the world. The food is good, but the efficiency of getting people through the line is awful. It was like this 2 weeks ago but we gave them the benefit of the doubt....NOPE....The guy cutting all the meat isn't getting any help and is touching everything around the kitchen then touching the meat again without changing his gloves. Taylor, who seems to be the manager, is watching the huge line without helping and I can see 4 people in back standing in a circle just chatting. I have watched multiple people come and then leave because of the wait. Just got my food and was in line for 22 minutes with only 3 others ordering in front of me. The owner of this store needs to read the book \"raving fans\"."}
{"text":"This joint is WAYYYYYYYYY better then Rudy's which is right down the road. Their BBQ and sauce taste great and their sides complete the meal. The portions are not small for the quality and a meal is quite filling. Maybe people want 4 lbs for $13? I don't get it...  well the mac is great, the kids meal is huge and fed my daughter for 2 days, the sandwhich was gigantic with two meats in it and fed me for two meals. The first time I went in there was a small glitch with one of my sides and they comped me a free meal. The staff is friendly and they have a re-mix machine for drinks and also high quality lemonade that's tasty. I will be going back for sure and my friends love the place too."}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Vegas! Turkey is my overall favorite. They have great daily specials and kids eat free on Sundays. Everyone loves the free soft serve ice cream."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times before .  This time I ordered takeout online for Mother's Day.  Quality sure seems to have gone downhill recently.  Ordered a family pack and also ordered a extra full slab of ribs (almost $30 alone) Ribs were horrible. dry. sauce hard as a rock. overall just nasty, probably left over from the day before. My dog didn't even like them. Beef brisket as part of family pack was also pretty bad.  Ordered sliced, not chopped. Maybe one slice down the middle but huge gobs of fat.  And to think I paid Damn near $100 for this order.  Be my last time here.  BTW got a full slab at COSTCO yesterday. $16 bucks and VERY tasty."}
{"text":"Wow I am glad Dickey's came to NE Ohio! We went for lunch today with some people from work and it was delicious!  Very reasonably priced for BBQ and they offer catering which is a big plus for our office.  Great sides to choose from and free ice cream all the time!"}
{"text":"In the area and used Yelp to find a good spot to eat.  Totally scored with this place.  The pulled pork with sweet sauce was excellent.  Also for a side the barbecue beans nailed it.  Parking is limited but well worth it!"}
{"text":"We ordered delivery thru Grubhub, tried Dickey's for the first time. Wife had the half rack of ribs and I got the 3 meat combo with pulled pork, beef brisket, and kielbasa. They have fried okra which was a pleasant surprise, and it was really good!   We enjoyed everything and will definitely go back!  One note to Grubhub, the delivery was top rate, it was early and it was great. The rating part of the app needs work. On the question if anything was crushed or spilled it is too instinctive to hit yes. I read others did it and I fell for it too. Nothing in my order was damaged."}
{"text":"The sides were delicious but I didn't care for the BBQ sauce which means the meat was just alright once the BBQ sauce was added. We did take out and 3 items were missing from our order. Check ur order before you leave to make sure your food is there. Nothing like getting home and ur kids sandwich is missing so u have to give Her half of yours."}
{"text":"THE BEST BBQ around the valley. Fresh ingredients and super flavorful. One of our fav family lunch /dinner spots."}
{"text":"Wasn't even noon and they're out of chicken and turkey. While brisket was definitely not dry it was flavorless. The drive to Bobby Q's or Rudy's would have been very much worth it. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Drive thru bbq...yes please. Until you taste it and realize it's exactly what you would expect. It wasn't joes bbq which is normally my go to. I  for the family pack to be able to try a few more items.The mac and cheese seemed over stirred and the noodles didn't have any shape. The cole slaw and pulled pork was the only decent items. The rolls seem store bought and even the sauce was runny."}
{"text":"This place was very good. We went at lunch and got the special for that day, it was a large sandwich deal with side and a drink. Good price and it did not take very long.  They did miss one order as we were getting everything togo and I had ordered for a friend that was going to meet us. But were able to get it right away for us.  I will return to try more items."}
{"text":"Love the pulled pork sandwich. Even get it on a combo special on Mondays. Always get the fried okra and never walk out without the free ice cream cone to go."}
{"text":"This place is waaaayyyyyyyyyy over priced not good at all no flavor very Disappointed my husband had hair on the plate, food was red as you can see my 2yr old said no to everything and that's a shocker cause she eats every and anything!!! the amount of food for $32 damn dollars I thought it would if been wayyy better . So needless to say just don't do it to your self smh I would give no stars but can"}
{"text":"Where has this place been hiding? Thank gosh for yelp! We were in the mood for BBQ and searched and found this hidden gem. On Sundays kids eat free so that was super awesome! We loved the meat, the sides, and best of all a free cone of ice cream to top it off. Super helpful staff and make sure to sign up for their text club too!"}

{"text":"Food is really good but we have been 3 times now and each time the order has been wrong. Just got home and we received none of our side dishes. Not worth getting in the car and driving all the way back for some beans, potato salad, mac and cheese etc  Sorry dickeys but i am not a glutton for punishment. 3 chances are plenty we won't be back."}
{"text":"Dickey's is nothing to call home about.  The pulled pork sandwich didn't even come with barbecue sauce.  The sides were bland.  Nothing special at all."}
{"text":"Figured I'd check out the new BBQ joint in surprise. I was not impressed with the amount of food for the price. I came in at 7 pm, I  figured the food would be hot and fresh, not the case at all. This was their last rack of ribs,  they were dry and hard. The brisket was cold and dried out. The ceasar salad was brown. They were already out 2 of their sides. When I purchased the food, the girl ran my card through and walked away, I had to ask if I was good to go. All three ( original, sweet and spicy ) bbq sauces were nearly empty, having to scrap the bottom to get enough sauce to make the meat edible. Both the sweet and original ice teas were empty. Needless to say that I will never return here. Please save your money and go to another restaurant"}
{"text":"Decided to check Dickeys out. Food was good but they were out of several menu  items including Brisket which is what I went there for. Not a good first impression"}
{"text":"Well, the food was good, but everything else is basically a mess.  Apparently, there is a hidden area on the right side wall for a line to form.  No signage at all.  Then we got to the front and were greeted by a bunch of people behind a really high wall sort of staring at you and not saying anything.  We're staring at them, they are staring at us... After a while, one of them decided to ask what we would like.  We asked what the difference was between the pork rib plate and the 1 meat plate with pork rib.  None of them knew and had to ask someone else.  Apparently, the port rib plate has a half-rack of ribs and the other one has \"less\" but no one knew how much less.  Basically, the entire ordering and paying process seemed to be run by people who all seemed lost and completely without direction.  The person taking our money was just standing there with most of our food sitting in front of us and just looking off into space.  She seemed to wake up when I mentioned that one of our sides was missing... and we'd like to pay as well.  They all wear gloves, which is nice.  Unfortunately, they don't seem to understand why there are wearing gloves.  We watched the same guy who had been putting orders together walk over and try to figure out why the soda dispenser was not working.  Then he walked over and noticed the garbage was getting full.  He proceeded to PUSH the garbage down into the can with his hand, and then walk back over and start touching the selection screen on the soda machine.  Yes, all with the same gloves on.  Touching food to touching garbage to touching the same screen that you touch when you select a soda.  Nice.  Another employee walked out from the food prep area to refill and enjoy his drink before returning to the food prep area... all while wearing the same gloves.  We honestly thought that they just opened a few days ago and were all still getting the hang of it.  Then I saw a review that was 2 months old.  Nobody there seemed to have any idea what they were doing or really seemed to take anything seriously.  Lots of smiling and giggling followed by more blank stares.  It truly looked like a high school play with a bunch of people pretending to be working at a restaurant.  At least they had chicken and turkey, unlike the Dickey's we tried on the east side of town..."}
{"text":"Originally form the south so I've tasted my share of smoked n BBQ. All I need to say is when my parents come in town the first place they are salivating to go to is Dickey's. The stuffed baked potatoes are hands down delicious."}
{"text":"The GF said dickeys, I said rubios. Now I'm here writing the review holding back vomit, while she's worshiping the porcelain throne. I would really love to rub it in right now but it's not an appropriate time. Maybe tomorrow if we're still alive.    First off, I think dickeys is part of sheriff joes work furlough program, because the guys working there looked like they were out on good behavior.  First red flag!  No disrespect, they are probably good guys with no food handling safety.   I walk up to the order spot, he's scraping meat off the cutting board and finds a big chunk of pork, grabs it; While holding the trash can he offers me the pork. I smiled and politely declined. Second red flag!    By this time I should of walked out. But the GF was set on the fried okra and I saw a coupon.   Long story short, yada-yada-yada (Elaine), were are swearing off dickeys. Never again. Shame on me 2x real quick."}
{"text":"food here is amazing and quick service. had the street tacos and bbq beans, was bomb.com"}
{"text":"This place is very meh for the price. It's just not good enough bbq. Don't come here if you're used to good bbq and have any type of cravings for it.  Because this place isn't going to satisfy it."}
{"text":"I came into Dickeys tonight at about 515 for the first time. I live around the corner and have been meaning to check it out. I was buying dinner for my family. I walked in thru the side door. It smelled really good inside and paper menus were readily available. I walked down to the end of the counter where the counter was much lower to order when I hear a voice saying \"you gotta come order over here.\" I walked over to the voice and I  walked too far apparently. I then heard an annoyed voice saying \"right here you gotta order right here\" I could barely see her the counter was up to my nose. Again with a condescending tone \"Don't you see the sign?\" She pointed up. I tilted my head all the way back and saw the order here sign about 3 feet above my head. I said \"I see it now. She said \"yeah just making sure\" raised her eyebrows gave a fake forced smile. It didn't feel good to be talked to like I was an idiot. I left immediately and will not be returning. The young blonde girl behind the counter cost this business years worth of my money. Maybe she has to say it all day long or perhaps she thinks that everyone should know that the sign is there because she knows it is. But I personally think that her remarks and attitude were unnecessary.  I also think the counter is extremely high to be an obvious place to put in an order."}
{"text":"I recently did an Uber eats order from this location and they were out of the item that I ordered. I received a phone call asking if I wanted something different instead. The order I got was good. It was chicken, cabbage slaw and Mac n cheese. The slaw wasn't that great, but the chicken was cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"Went to Dickey's today with my husband and kids. Andrew, the manager was so friendly and professional. Our food, as always, was delicious! This is like a fastish food joint, but with actual good food (novel concept)! The place was clean and the food was hot and prepared fresh. I love that you can mix up the BBQ sauces to whatever your liking. Not to mention the soft-serve ice cream after a delicious meal! FYI kids eat free on Sundays, which is a great deal for families."}
{"text":"The best BBQ brisket ever and my husband loves the ribs, too!! I have tried to find a really great moist and flavorful brisket for what seems forever. Went from Michigan to Henderson and Boulder City and found the best at Dickey's on Las Vegas Blvd. south. If I could give it more stars I would. :-) Carol"}
{"text":"Not the vary best bbq in vegas but for the price you can bring home alot of food. I tryed the family pack and went with the sliced brisket and ribs..brisket was really good but the ribs..not so much. Really chewy and tough..the bbq beans and mac and cheese was vary tastie and some of the best sweet tea in the business. I go buy it by the gallon..no bullshit...over all I gave it the forth star because they have great staff..they were vary friendly and professional."}
{"text":"BBQ was not bad! I'm not really a big BBQ person to begin with but I will say that this place was good. I had the beef brisket with beans & Mac n cheese. It was better than I expected. But because I'm not a big nba fan in general I didn't give 5 stars. But 4 will do!"}
{"text":"If you read all my Yelp reviews so far, you will find that the majority of them cover barbecue joints. Yes, we like barbecue. My wife and I each have a sibling living in Austin, Texas, so we think we know the real deal when we taste it. Dickey's isn't quite that, but it's a nice addition to the Madison 'cue scene and I hope it's here to stay.   The meats have a good smoke flavor and they're tender, if sometimes overcooked. But that's to be expected in a fast-food/fast-casual place where I'm not sure the meats are smoked in-house daily. They might be smoked elsewhere and delivered, but for the price, that's OK. The ribs and brisket are worth ordering. The chicken is a grilled breast you can get anywhere.  The sauces (original, spicy), are served hot, just like in Texas, and they're of that thinner, Texas consistency. I like them. The option to top your meal with jalapenos and onions is also very Texas-like, but the smoked sausage isn't. The slaw and potato salad are decent sides; the others are unremarkable.   Dickey's offers free soft-serve ice cream where the most clever among us can make a root beer float in our big yellow drink cups. Kids eat free on Sundays with each adult meal purchased. We are always satisfied when we leave. What more can you expect for under $20?"}
{"text":"I got the three meat plate, all the meats I got were amazing!!! And the side didn't disappoint!! If your into BBQ then I would hit this place up for sure!!! Quality food and the people working here were super friendly!!! I even met the owner Tom and he was super nice!!! I will defiantly be back to this place to eat with my family and I will also be using them to cater my office party this month.  Great experience"}
{"text":"OK, the ordering process is a little awkward and confusing, not unlike being at the DMV.  Do I give you my drink order? Some else asks me if I want sides. Wait, where do I get my drink? Why is the counter so high? Ok now that that is out of the way. Here's the positive; the food here is great. They also have a very good email club. So for fast food BBQ this is your place.  Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!"}
{"text":"This was my first time coming into dickeys and I am very happy with it. There was a miscommunication with my order probably due to me not speaking loud enough. Without hesitation, Sara Emily cleared everything up and gave me a discount taking blame for the miscommunication even though I'm sure it was my fault. That was one heck of a first time. I'll continue to come here regularly just because of the customer service alone. The food is a given."}
{"text":"Tasha and Aaron made this first visit Incredible! I wanted a stuffed baked potato like in Texas- not available. Yet these two Superstars customized a delicious treat for me and my family. Super Awesome and Outstanding Customer Experience!!!"}
{"text":"Not impressed. Sadly we were the only customers there. Too many fruit flies everywhere to enjoy eating. Busy waving them away from plate. We couldn't wait to leave. But very polite people working."}
{"text":"I was really surprised by how much I liked this place. This place is a valid option when you combine the price, convenience, and good food.  My office ordered this for lunch. We noticed other departments in our office order from here a lot for meetings and thought we should give it a try too. Dickey's offers online ordering which was convenient for placing a large order. We ordered the largest package which includes three meats, four sides, rolls, and BBQ sauce for about $60. The pricing was reasonable for the amount of food. We did add an extra meat since our office appreciates its meat. :)  Since meat is the main subject of this meal I'll start there. The ribs were flavorful and very meaty. The pulled pork was tender and one of the more simple meats. The hot cheddar sausage was indeed hot and loaded with cheddar cheese. If you like hot and you like cheese you will love this. Lastly, the brisket was a tender meat cut in thin slices. My favorites of the four were the sausage and the ribs.  For sides we chose macaroni and cheese, fried okra (I repeat fried okra!), green beans, and baked potato casserole. The macaroni and cheese was not my favorite because the cheese sauce didn't taste awesome. It tasted like it might have Velveeta in it. The fried okra was one of the highlights. I don't see this offered enough. It was really good, slightly hot with a nice fried breading. I didn't even bother with the sauce that came with the okra because it was unnecessary. The baked potato casserole was good and had plenty of flavor.  The rolls were not the most exciting, but were soft and the perfect vehicle for sopping up extra sauce. The BBQ sauce was also really good and I was surprised at just how much I liked it."}
{"text":"Went in around lunch time and the place is tiny, had to wait about 10 minutes just to sit down somewhere... The food was excellent, just felt rushed and crammed into a small location.  Oh and they have free ice cream, which is delicious."}
{"text":"BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE -The employee was not friendly or helpfull.  He was unpleasent and confrontational to my grandma Over Priced - beware of the $10 large fry Several different meats were all dry and tough Looking at the other reviews this seems just to be a bad location"}
{"text":"Dang it!! Dang it!! I wanted to like it!! I really, really did!! But, their customer service was sooo lacking that I couldn't  enjoy the experience to the fullest.    My husband and I went for dinner Saturday night after reading the positive reviews on Yelp. We walked in and didn't get greeted with warm welcomes.  We didn't even get acknowledged until it was our turn to order.  There were five people working the line and service was still slow. When it came time pay .. welll.. that's when the customer service got from bad to worse (sorry Mason).  A little acknowledgement (such as hi) and a smile goes a long way. My husband actually had to reach across Mason to get our tray of food.    I got the pulled pork sandwich with waffle cut fries and cole slaw and my husband got the brisket sandwhich with the jalape√±o beans and waffle cut fries. Our fries werent ready when we got our food. We were told that when the fries were ready they would be brought out to us.  Sadly, they were never cooked and my husband had to go remind the staff that we were missing our fries.  One of the employees who brought out the fries gave us a coupon for a free sandwhich.  Thanks that was nice:)   I'm happy to say that the food was really good:) However, because I'm such a weirdo about customer service (I will willingly eat ok food with great customer service than eat great food with bad customer service).   The final straw.  My husband and I were sitting on the patio enjoying the beautiful fall weather when one of the employees went outside to smoke a cigarette.  We left because the cigarette smoke was so strong. :("}
{"text":"2 stars is high for a biased Texan. It will do in a pinch, might be the best around, and reminds me of home down to the Imperial Sugar.  The facility is clean & well run."}
{"text":"The first time the Pit Master was generous with the brisket and it was perfect, the second visit the Brisket was dry and not so generous. Now on my third time its gotten worse!! The Pit Master was not so generous with the brisket, the bun was stale and the brisket had more fat than beef. Not sure if I will give it a fourth try."}
{"text":"It was ok. And just that. I did appreciate that they smoke most of their meats in house.  The sauce was mediocre at best and the sandwich I had was decent.  I had the Mac and cheese and jalape√±o beans which were mere after thoughts. I paid 10$ but would be writing a different review if it was priced more like 5$ because that's what you ought to pay for this."}
{"text":"Dickey's Barbecue what can I say , always very tasty. Today I had the brisket with the ribs so tender  they melt-in-your-mouth.  Green beans are always a must when you visit Dickey's, the barbecue beans yum yum just the right amount of barbecue sauce in these barbecued beans. This was our first time for our visit here in Las Vegas, restaurant was clean, the staff was very nice."}
{"text":"Great customer service.....thank you!  High in sodium; however everything in moderation."}
{"text":"I thought it was a delicious experience. We had a large take out order and brought it home. I thought the chicken was a bit dry but the ribs were spot on.  The sauce they gave us was gluten free but I don't think they had a gluten free kitchen (and they weren't pretending too).  I will return."}
{"text":"Stopped in after I was at my kids LAX  tournament.  I must say the BBQ was tender and quite tasty (between the three of us we had ribs, pulled pork, and brisket)! Sides were very good  too.  This location sells beer and has free soft serve ice cream.  Will most definitely go here again.   Food was prepared much better than the Parma location that can be read in one of my earlier reviews  Blows Old Carolina BBQ out of the water!!!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ at a good price.  My 9 year old son and I shared a three meat platter of beef brisket, pulled pork and sliced chicken and it was very tender with a great smoked flavor.  Free soft serve vanilla ice cream cones too."}
{"text":"Fast Food BBQ-They gave me a FREE Sandwich for my Birthday! (sign up for E-Club)  This time around it was pretty damn good. Still no bark but good smoke flavor and tasty beef brisket.  KIDS now eat FREE Sat & Sunday!! Always FREE Ice Cream and its pretty cheap. A-ok!"}
{"text":"Went to this spot on Friday night ordered sandwiches and brisket. It was very good. Wonderful food and great service. Will certainly go back. Excellent Jalepeno Smoked Sausage  and smokey Brisket"}
{"text":"Decent bbq and sides although the prices seem really high, I wouldnt waste my money on a family meal but an individual meal isn't to bad, disappointed they don't have whole pickles as well"}
{"text":"I did get an email apologizing and asking for my contact info as they would like to have me back. I never heard from them after I replied so it was a nice touch but not sincere. :("}
{"text":"Good food, wonderful service! This is our go to for BBQ . Price is reasonable and bonus you get free ice cream! Our kids love it"}
{"text":"Food is good , fairly priced and owner looks out with discounts . Very people friendly and place is clean. Just wished the stayed open till 10."}
{"text":"I have got back since and the brisket was better. The creamed spinach is good and I really liked the pecan pie. The filling is better than most.   So far I've had the pulled pork, brisket, turkey, ribs, and kielbasa.   The pulled pork is reliably good. The brisket is usually good. The turkey and ribs were ok. The kielbasa is one of the stand out meats. It tastes nothing like a grocery store kielbasa. It's heavily spiced with a good flavor that compliments the smoking. The Turkey was not bad, but had a slightly processed taste, like an oscar mayer turkey breast, they don't smoke the whole bird. But all considered, this place does pretty good BBQ, and I like how fast and convenient it is."}
{"text":"Great pulled pork sandwiches mac and cheese BBQ beans and Diet Coke floats with free soft serve Ice Cream!!"}
{"text":"I'm wishing I could give just shy of 4 stars and there isn't anything wrong with Dickey's. Why not a better score if there isn't anything wrong? Well, we have to face facts, people are into cooking their own BBQ, like myself, so we have a bit higher standards. Also the competition is pretty intense.   Some places do at least one dish exceptionally well, but either I didn't order that dish or there wasn't one. From my short recollection, I believe they were using a Southern Pride smoker that was onsite from when Kinfolk BBQ  used to be there.  I like a bit more smoke on my meat and the BBQ was good, but not memorable in any way.  I would recommend you try Dickey's if you haven't. The best thing I had was the hot link, which did have the smokiness I was looking for."}
{"text":"I found Dickey's on Groupon and got a XL family pack which was good for dinner for 3 and 3 lunches the following day. The BBQ is good, solid food that I would go back and visit for again. Nothing super great to write home about and travel to the ends of the earth for but good enough that I'd return. Try the brisket. Stay away from the Mac and cheese it's a bit bland. The original sauce is great!"}
{"text":"Someone wrote the place was dirty? LIES. The place is immaculate and like new. When I walked in, they acted like they knew me and were super friendly. Ribs were fresh and delicious. The sides left a little to be desired (I prefer baked macaroni versus velveeta shells and cheese) but the meat and ambiance were good. And you get souvenir cups!  I'll be back..."}
{"text":"I've had Dickey's before- many of times. But I will never be returning to this location. The pork was dry, my salad was warm and has 4 pieces of lettuce, and the mac and cheese had an awful after taste to it. I was so disappointed especially after waiting almost 30 minutes just to order our food."}
{"text":"Husband and I tried this place out a few nights ago as he overheard some co-workers talking about it. Being that it is on the North side of town, must be they get a lot of service members as the cashier asked my husband if he were military with no hesitation. We received a discount which is always nice.  Moving on, it is a quick-serve BBQ joint, which I wasn't aware of until we got there. You order what you want, move down the line, pick your sides and meats, and then get rung up for the meal. Three types of sauces and drink machines are centrally located.  I chose to get the two-meat platter. The brisket was kind of dry and did not have a really good smokey flavor I would expect. Most of it tasted more like a roast, which I don't want when I ask for brisket. If I want a roast, I can slow cook one myself. I can't make myself a brisket as I don't have a smoker - so this was a bit of a disappointment.  I also had the spicy sausage with cheddar, and my husband had the regular sausage - these were so, so good. I would go back for the sausage. My husband also got the pulled pork, which he said was good, but I did not have any.  As for sides - we got four in total: mac-n-cheese: hard to mess up, this one was fine. Baked potato casserole - basically mashed taters with cheese melted on top and chives, I liked it as it was very smooth, but with good flavor. Also had the BBQ beans - OK, nothing special, and the coleslaw - dry, it needed more liquid ingredient.  Overall for BBQ the price isn't too bad, but you aren't getting the very best quality BBQ. You can definitely find better BBQ elsewhere in the Valley, but if you want something quick and you don't want it from a sit-down restaurant this isn't a bad option."}
{"text":"Ate here the first and last time. We were in the neighborhood and felt like having barbecue.  We each got something different. We had ribs, pulled pork and brisket with coleslaw, beans and macncheese. The ribs were tough and dry like jerky but worse. The pulled pork was dry and tasteless which is hard to do. The brisket was the slightly better choice butmstill significantly poor. The place was empty but very clean. Staff were nice and helpful."}
{"text":"The best Texas style brisket in the Charlotte area. Kids eat free on Sundays,they have free soft serve ice cream, and they have good ice"}
{"text":"Does NOT even deserve ONE STAR!  I went to this location for my 30 minute lunch break. Pull up to the drive through and sat at the intercom saying \"hello, hello\" for five minutes. After trying to remain patient I decided to pull up to the window. There was a car sitting in front of me (they must have a lot of patience) and I never was shown any service. After waiting for another 10 minutes behind the car in front of me, I drove off.  After driving off, and not eating since at this point I would not have time to go anywhere else and be able to eat before going back to work, I called this location and asked them if their business was even open. The employee told me their drive thru intercom is not working properly and when I asked to speak with the manager, she told me that they are EXTREMELY busy.   I have never been through a drive-thru and not be immediately helped, isn't that what they are for?"}
{"text":"This is the very first time we have ever eaten at a Dickey's Barbecue. We have lived in the area for 2-years now and thought we would try it. We were rather \"under\"whelmed!!  The food was fine but we were just not thrilled with the atmosphere or lack there of. We thought it was a sit down restaurant and it does have picnic tables but no table service and the place was not the most efficiently run place we have ever been in.   We may go back but if we do it will be for take-out."}
{"text":"My buddy and I went to this location today. We are by no means experts, but we have competed in BBQ competitions in Texas on several occasions. This place is a disgrace to Texas and should not have the title BBQ attached to its name. We had the pulled pork, brisket, and the spicy cheddar sausage. There was no bark and no smoke ring on the pork and brisket. The meat had no smell of smoke whatsoever and it had no flavor at all. This BBQ tasted like it was cooked in an oven. For meat that is cooked for 12 hours with hickory, I'm completely blown away. This was hands down, the worst BBQ we have ever eaten.   The sausage was obviously store bought, and this was the best we had. We were appalled at the sauce as well. It was sweet North Carolina sauce that is heavily infused with vinegar."}
{"text":"Dickeys catered our wedding, and everything was awesome!  The brisket and chicken we soo good, and all of the sides were delicious! Our guests had lots of good things to say about the food and the service! I can't thank Nick enough for all he did! Working with him was so easy,  really took the stress or of the meal part of our special day.  I would encourage everyone to choose Dickeys to cater any kind of event!"}
{"text":"So, we've eaten at this location 3 times in the past few weeks. Each time the service has gone from bad to worse. I'd rather not go into detail of each occurrence but they were definitely consistent in the following:  -Never once greeted upon arrival -Were told to \"stick and move\" - then forgot we had 4 orders and not 3 -Stood at the counter while the order taker kept his head down for 5 minutes before acknowledging we were even standing there -Ran out of BBQ sauce - how does this happen? I get running out of meat, but sauce?  Just a few of the highlights. Definitely not somewhere I would want to continue to patron. I'd rather spend the gas money and drive across town from Silverado Ranch to John Mull's in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"These people have NO idea what they are doing.  As a person who has grown up eating the best BBQ (meaning chopped/pulled, seasoned pork shoulder) in the US (in eastern North Carolina), of course I am going to be a tough sell.  But I was open and very disappointed.  The meat on the pulled pork sandwich was not pulled at all, but rather sliced and in chunks.  Further to that, it was dry and tasted like it had been cooked over a gasoline flame. Yuk!  This place is great if you have no idea what the offerings are supposed to taste like.  I feel bad as I write this review, because the proprietors and staff are SO nice!  But between the dry chunks of gasoline flavored pork and the spoiled sweet tea, don't waste your time."}
{"text":"They completely remodeled this old Arby's. I really like what they've done with the place.   We ordered a half rack ribs, potato salad, green beans and a cookie. The ribs are so good. I love the flavor and they were the perfect texture and consistency.  The potato salad was store bought, the green beans were mushy and we did not like the flavor, the roll was like a  thick biscuit like rather than airy fluffy rolls.  The cookie was soft and tasted great. Cant go wrong with a cookie. :)  Its a descent place, not the best, but good enough when I'm craving ribs. I won't order the sides next time though."}
{"text":"Pulled pork wasn't very good. Beef brisket was a little better. Fried okra and mac and cheese were ok."}
{"text":"There is not a lot of good barbeque in Vegas, so I was pleased to hear about this place a little over a year ago. Its 'fast-food' barbeque that is JUST as good as Lucille's for a third of the price.   I eat here way to much. Having lived in the south for a number of years I'm always looking for a good pulled pork sand which with pickles and onions. These guys always satisfy the craving without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"It wasn't all that bad. I had the 3 meat plate with pulled pork, beef brisket and chicken breast. My sides were Mac & cheese and green beans w/bacon. The beef brisket was a little dry, but flavorful. I did enjoy the Mac & cheese as well as the beans.   It was a little bit more than what u wanted to spend for one person, spending $20. Though it's not my favorite place, I would eat here again."}
{"text":"If your looking for 'real home-style BBQ', go BBQ at home.  But for strip mall Vegas style BBQ, Dickeys is alright.   The ribs are decent and the sauce is worth a try. If your a rib snob, try the brisket. If your a brisket snob,  just eat a napkin as a sauce vehicle. I'm sayin' the sauce is pretty good.   However, If managements goal is to attract less costumers to the restaurant, then they have succeeded thanks to recent changes in their menu.   I used to get a rib plate and a drink / side for under 9 bucks.   Now i get a rib plate, and 2 sides. With no drink for over 11 bucks. W?  I just traded my drink for an extra side, for an additional 3 bucks. Do the math.   But it doesn't take a Mathematician to know that sitting in that place for 30 minutes listening to pop-country, isn't worth the best BBQ in the world for free.   Another thing that bugs me is the plastic yellow cups. They encourage costumers to take these home, but look inside the trash bin on the way out. Filled with plastic cups. Waste of money.  Aside from this, the place is clean and service is prompt. Also, It is in every restaurant owners best interest to install a self serve ice cream machine. Good call here. Its a great gimmick and it works.   Advice to stay alive: Hire a business major, kill the PA noise (silence is the savior) and spend less on high-grade plastic cups, charge less for low-grade BBQ.   Thx"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good, and we keep coming back for that. Price is ok. However, service here is weird. There are different people working there every time I go in. And 3 out of 5 times, they'll get the order wrong - especially if you go through the drive-thru. Don't ever leave here without checking your order! Seriously ... they get it wrong all the time. They've got free ice cream which is cool if you dine-in. My 9yo son doesn't think they care about their customers, lol. Sometimes, the restaurant doesn't seem well cared for."}
{"text":"Read the previous reviews....lot of anger for this place.  I like the BBQ sauce and really that is what we are talking about here aren't we.  I am not a fan of any of the sides but the BBQ chicken or turkey sandwich is great, I usually take off the pickles.  I like how you can get free ice cream and the whole set up is nice and clean.  There are 2 large flat screens to keep you entertained and they bring the food out to you.  I would say this is the best BBQ but it serves a good purpose for the north valley.  It is a great spot for a quick lunch so I have to say....yah, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"Overdone and dry meats plus sides weren't available. The potatoe casserole tasted like plastic. Staff was nice though."}
{"text":"I would give only one star, but the sever at the drive through window offered me a very sincere \"have a nice day,\" so they at least have nice help. That said, Yuck!  I was beginning my second leg to Nashville and had slept in a bit longer than I intended, so I was a bit rushed for time. I did need fuel for both my Volvo and stomach so decided some BBQ would go nicely with my trip to the (somewhat) south, but to save time I chose Dickey's instead of the local place in town.   To begin with, the drive through speaker pedestal completely blocks the middle of the menu board - at least in a smaller car. I also wonder how well lit it is, as it is a dark sign with an odd choice for the color of the letters. It was probably researched, but based on the rest of the establishment, not well. By the way, I do know this is a chain. I ate at one in ND several years ago and wasn't that impressed then, either.  I selected the sliced brisket sandwich with mac and cheese, and a sweet tea. This cake to $11 something. Service was quick, as there was no other cars in sight (noon on a Saturday, hmm), so after my friendly server exchanged food for money, I was off and quickly on the interstate. One thing that always frustrates me is when I get no napkins in a drive thru. Let's face it, a burger and fries is not ending up being paired with bone china and fine linen. It is almost undoubtedly being choked down at at the first available red light, but I digress. With this order I got one napkin and NO utensils. Seriously, I got a snifter of mac and cheese with nothing to eat it with. Unbelievable!  The brisket was wet, as if it had been sitting in warm water or perhaps under plastic wrap. It had little evidence of smoke (no bark or smoke ring), and while it had some pinkness, it was dry and completely tasteless. The bun was flat and the entire thing had been thrown together with absolutely no care whatsoever.   The mac and cheese... Remember Nancy Reagan in the '80s? Take her advice and Just Say No. It was ironic to be in Wisconsin, the self- proclaimed (or at least insinuated) cheese capital of America, and there is a place that uses powdered cheese. Yep, the cheese in this side dish was made from powdered cheese. I would believe it had been mixed in some factory, canned, and delivered here, but it was gritty and the consistency of thick water, and in no way resembled real cheese.  I included pictures so you don't have to take my word for the quality, but if you have read any of my other reviews, you know I that I care about what I eat and drink, so take my advice: drive the extra few blocks to Hardee's. You will pay less and because you will have lower expectations, you will be much happier and more satisfied.  And on second thought, the same kid who wished me a good day was the same who didn't give me a fork. Evil! (And there goes the second star after all)."}
{"text":"The food is good, the service at this location however is horrible! We walked in and there was nobody up front, it took a few minutes for someone to come up and acknowledge us. Then while we were trying to place our order a couple more employees came up and would interrupt and start rushing our order, acting like they were busy when we were the only people in there at the time. It was not a very friendly welcoming environment, everyone looked like we were inconveniencing them. There were no napkins out anywhere just a couple rolls of paper towels tucked away by the drinks, and they had no tea made at all. They were very pleasant to the next  group of people though that came in about 10 minutes later, even offered them their daily special that we were told nothing about. Sorry to interrupt your little hangout session in the back and make you do your job! I will not be returning to this location."}
{"text":"ordered this for the office luncheon.  I ordered the XL Family Pack (X3) which included 3 meats: Texas-Style Chopped Beef Brisket, Smoked Chicken, Pork Ribs and I chose 3 of 4 Sides: Idaho Russet Potato Salad, Mac & Cheese, Cabbage Slaw.  Delivery was on time and all the food was still hot.  Everything tasted amazing, esp the chopped beef brisket!  Will definitely order from them again and will also go for myself to the restaurant.  Pretty good BBQ in Vegas!"}
{"text":"New menu is horrible. Employees are rude. They can't seem to get it together. Waited in line for 30 minutes for cold food. Just left. Waste of time. Get it together."}
{"text":"The BBQ smell soon as you walk in is mesmerising. Get the rack of pork ribs and the meat falls off the bone. Their sauces are vibrant and add a burst of flavor to any cut. The kielbasa is delicious too. I don't think you can order anything wrong. They have daily specials all week. And to top it off, they have an ice cream machine no charge, this was a home run for bringing the kids. Can't wait to go back and have more!"}
{"text":"Not sure if I want to come back when staff is coughing on the sauce and ice cream and cones. Plus, it be better if they heated up the meat. Tastes better when it's hot."}
{"text":"I am so sorry that my favorite place change so much, I understand that we are creatures of habit and we all hate changes but today I visited this location, I noticed that there were no napkins on the tables or any condiments just plain tables, the food was great and tasty I order the 3 meat platter but when I was about to eat I noticed that I only got 2 orders of meat I ask one of the guys behind the counter and he said that he needed to take the meat from my plate and check for weight, so he did and he proceeded to add the order that was missing, he cut one pice 3 times so he can only give me the correct amount, I think it was a bit in the embarrassing side wile he was doing it there some customers watching, I don't think I be back to a place that a employee need to cut a pice 3 times in order to give me 3 oz of meat ( I really hope this is a franchise location and not a corporation one ). And yes ! No ice cream"}
{"text":"I go here sometimes when I am at work and in the mood for BBQ.  I can smell this place about half a mile away.  Their BBQ sandwiches are very good.  I have to have he coleslaw added along with the cheese.  I usually get a pulled pork or brisket sandwich and they are always overflowing with meat.  So much so, that I always grab a fork to pick up the stuff that drops out.  They have 3 different BBQ sauces and they are all good.  I like my sandwiches super sauced so I make sure to get enough to drench my meal.  I don't get any sides as the sandwiches have held me down.  There is also a ice cream machine so that is just a bonus, especially on summer days in the AZ."}
{"text":"I thought this was pretty awful, gave it 2stars instead of 1 because at least the sides were ok. Good pie. I had Mac n cheese and potato casserole. And their BBQ  sauce is good. I ordered 3meat meal. Got two fairly skimpy ribs, asked for pulled pork but 90% sure it was Turkey, either way it  was super dry, and the chopped brisket was also dry, I not only went through the sauce they gave me, but had to use a bunch I had at home from my own stock (ordered take out) since all the meat was so damn dry. I usually am a light saucer and just like to enjoy the meat. I have a smoker at home,I have little experience and even still I'd say if I stood outside the door and sold it for DOUBLE their price, people would go for mine, it was that bad as far as BBQ standards go."}
{"text":"This is my third attempt eating at this rib joint, my first attempt the line was too long and the cashiers were either too slow or not enough. Had to walk out. Went in again today after going to a movie nearby not really concerned about the long lines, I was ready to wait 25 to 30 minutes for my meal.  Sure enough, it took almost 30 minutes to get to the slow as molasses order takers and cashiers, and when I get to the front they don't have any ribs... I ask for barbecue chicken instead... They ran out of barbecue chicken.  There is no sign warning the customer who has to wait 1/2 hour for his food, that they ran out of ribs, and barbecue chicken. It does a disservice to customers wait in the long line and wind up extremely disappointed.  Since I invested all this time waiting for the food I got the pulled pork, which is not my first choice instead. The meet was kind of soggy, It could been around for a while. The flavor was passable, but then again it's not my cuppa tea. They really have to rethink the service, and the delivery.  How is the food there? I guess I'll never know this is my third attempt and I don't plan on going back there"}
{"text":"Good pulled chicken and pork sandwiches.  Somehow the chicken has a great smokey flavor and is not dry like so many other places.  The managers special is $8.00 for a sandwich, side and a drink.  They have really good slaw.  Great value!"}
{"text":"I was here 2 nights ago... The food was good, from what they actually had, but they were literally out of everything. No sausage, no chicken, no fries... The fryer was down... And to add to that, there were homeless people coming inside grabbing drinks and using the restroom forever. The inside was definitely not clean. Beware if you come in at 7:30 like we did. It was my first time here, and will most likely be my last."}
{"text":"In addition to some delicious BBQ, Dickey's has always been very supportive of the local high school. Greatly appreciate your support and your awesome food! More mac n cheese, please!"}
{"text":"This place has the BEST pulled pork! It's addictive. I also like the bread and my favorite side is the jalape√±o baked beans.  Yum"}
{"text":"I would say this place was alright. I've had better bbq. I prefer my meat smoked and the meat here was all oven cooked. I had a 2 for 1 coupon so that made it even better lol.. We ordered 3 meats with ribs, brisket and turkey. Ribs were good but a little fatty and I prefer my brisket cut in slices and this was like pulled pork style. Mac n cheese, potato casserole, and baked beans were excellent. When u leave you get a free ice cream! Overall I probably will come back but not often!  This place is basically the fast food of bbq!"}
{"text":"The reviews here seem pretty bad, but Im basing this review on the fried okra my girlfriend had..  She said it was the best she's ever had.  One problem..  it's not around the corner, but we'll still get it if we're here.  That's all we got.  So we have no idea how the other food tastes.. based on reviews, Im going to guess.. not so great."}
{"text":"I've heard their Texas locations are really good.  This place just did not do it for me. I could say more, but I'm not out to bash any staffers.  The food was just eh.  Sorry guys.. won't be back."}
{"text":"We just happened to notice this place, it's somewhat new to the Tolleson area, and we don't go by there a lot.  But, we both love BBQ, so decided to check it out!  You walk in, and it screams BBQ!!  It's cute and warm and family-friendly.  You order at the counter, and for us, they had our food ready while we were paying...so, it's pretty fast.  Of course, we were there at an off time, so it wasn't too busy.  I had the daily special...3 ribs, 2 sides (I chose mac n'cheese--awesome!!!--and potato salad--cold and tasty, exactly how I like it), a roll and a drink.  My ribs were tender and pretty much fell off the bone, but the rub was a bit strong for me.  I still ate them, but they were kinda spicy (I'm a major spice wuss, so for most everyone else, they'd be really good).  Hubby chose the 2 meat plate (he got ribs and brisket), 2 sides (cole slaw and loaded mashed potato) and a roll.  He had to order a drink separately.  He really enjoyed his plate, and loved the brisket.  We also decided to get a cookie and a blondie, which were at the cashier.  They also had pecan pie, which looked pretty good, as well.  They had a separate counter where you can get your drinks, condiments, silverware, etc...  They also had a little ice cream machine, which I'm sure the kids love!  They have 3 different sauces...original, spicy and sweet.  Hubby liked the original, and I went with the sweet.  It was pretty good, but still had a spiciness to it, which was strange, since it's supposed to be sweet.  All in all, we really enjoyed our meal.  I want to get the brisket the next time we go.  And, I have a feeling we'll be popping in a lot.  You can also order online and have your order waiting for you.  They're open daily 11am-9pm."}
{"text":"This place was soo good! Their pulled pork was super delicious! Their sides are fabulously yummy. The prices are just right. And the best part.... FRE ICE CREAM! Where can u go wrong!"}
{"text":"These folks make barbecue that is far better than any found in Los Angeles. However it isn't like having barbecue in Texas. The meat was nice, and the sauce was pretty good. I had the spicy sauce and was quite impressed. The place is obviously a fast food type of place, but you have to give them credit for making pretty decent barbecue."}
{"text":"the sauce is wayyyy to spicy to much pepper in it burn your mouth type of spicy and for what your paying  you figure you would get bigger portions but instead you get these tiny little portions that made me ask the driver if my order was correct thats how small the portions are oh well i guess you live and learn"}
{"text":"Awesome hard to find in Ohio BBQ - its a little small and just a fast food joint but pick it up for a picnic and you will think you are in Texas - love the baked beans!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. First time here and it was great, thank you! Got the pork sandwich and Mac and cheese. Definitely will be back and the bbq sauce is the best! Great staff."}
{"text":"The employees were extremely nice was greeted by everyone. Be sure to look on there sites for coupons my girlfriend was able to get a free drink. I was disappointed on how the food came out the meat was just room temperature hopefully next time it will be made fresh. They do give a good serving size for side dishes."}
{"text":"Not sure how there are any bad reviews on this place. Its our favorite bbq place and we always get the pulled pork sandwich plate. The food is consistently delicious and hot and the service is always great. Everyone is so friendly and genuine. Definitely better than Texas Roadhouse or Famous Dave's."}
{"text":"The portions vs the price is unbelievable. You get much more if you go to a restaurant and sit down and have dinner. We made an order to go of a 1 meat plate and a 2 meat plate. When we got it home there was no more meat in the 2 meat plate than there was in the 1 meat plate. Made us think that perhaps they forgot to put a portion in the 2 meat plate. Needless to say, I will NOT be returning to this place. Way overpriced and portions are extremely small for the price."}
{"text":"Excellent food very clean place.  Have visited many times,  always impressed.  Sundays is free food for kids so that's a great excuse to go out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"Very friendly and fast service, and they offer free soft serve!  The bbq itself is a bit pricey for the amount and quality you get though.  Although the bbq chopped brisket is one of their signature dishes, I found it was a bit too chopped for my liking, since the pieces of meat were very tiny which made it hard to eat.  They offer 3 different types of bbq sauce to go with your meal: original, sweet, or hot.  They all seem to originate from the same base, with a few extra ingredients added."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Dickey's.  My husband and I shared a full rack of ribs and two sides; Mac and cheese and the cole slaw.   The ribs were fall off the bone delicious and not drowning in sauce so the true flavor could be enjoyed.  Additional sauces were available but we didn't need them.   The Mac and cheese was creamy and cheesy and the cole slaw was a perfect compliment to the ribs.   The free ice cream and being able to keep the drink cup as a souvenir was a bonus. My only complaint is that there isn't a Dickey's near our home town (3 hour drive)."}
{"text":"I may have caught them on a bad day but... Overall, I have to say this place gets a tentative thumbs down from me. The food itself is decent. Nothing spectacular, but somewhat tasty (I did enjoy their fried okra).  The problem I have is their service. I think it stems from the fact that they only have ONE cash register to take orders. The person behind that register was extremely slow. In addition, I didn't even get one of the side dishes I ordered! I didn't realize until I got back to work (I took it to go). Fortunately, the place is on my way home, so I stopped by again. They did give me my side dish and I ordered an extra pulled pork sandwich; it had no BBQ sauce on it!  So for me, that's three strikes. They are kind of minor, but enough for me to leave with a figurative bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday afternoon and the place is very clean and I like the decor.  I do like the loose pieces of chopped wood around the walls and counter.  I had one family of 3 in front of me and there were 5 workers working.  It took me around 15 minutes just to check out.  :( The workers don't seem to know what they are doing and kept running into each other or stepping on each others toes.  One guy was working super hard while the others were running around not really doing anything.  I ordered a chicken sandwich, side of mac, and a pecan pie slice.  The sandwich was bland.  I went and got a cup of spicy BBQ sauce for it, but no matter.  The mac was the same and the pie was terrible.  I don't usually complain about price, but this time I felt they charged way more than what I got.  It was very very disappointing.  Hopefully they get their act together and it will be better."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here for lunch a while back and really enjoyed it. The food was good and hot and was decently priced for the amount of food we received. The cashier was very friendly and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Food was great, but place was kinda a mess. Table was not sturdy kept wobbling. Window was dirty. They were also out of tea... so had to wait several minutes for tea to be brewed. Food was great and came out fairly quick."}
{"text":"This place absolutely has the worst customer  service.  The red head girl looks at you like your retarded. Another guy was friendly but awkward like. But he was ok. Now I work at a restaurant, I know what customer service I expect and if I gave someone at my restaurant this type of experience they gave me .... I would be fired. It's not all about the food it's about the experience. The girl I dealt with acted like I was an inconvenience to her day, this was my first time there  and I promise I won't be back. The food was ok not worth what I payed. Now I came on Sunday to my surprise kids eat free on Sunday's! So I was to get my daughter a kids meal she wanted ribs, well I had ordered to go and they said I could not do kids meal unless I ate there. I said fine I'll just sit down and then ask u for a to go box. Then I say I want a rib kids meal , they tell me that will be 1 rib. Are u kidding me? 1 rib? Wtf???! So of corse I'm not going to buy my daughter 1rib. So I get her the same as me a rib plate so I payed 30$ for 2 meals, no biggie if the food was worth it. Or maybe I was still salty over the the lil red headgirl behind the counter. Either way my daughter didn't even like her plate, and I will never be back. DICKEYS: hire ppl that can successfully work with public!!!!"}
{"text":"Tried Dickey's for the first time today-will definitely come back. First impressions are everything...the restaurant was very clean and the employees were very nice. We both had brisket and pulled pork with 2 sides each. The portions were perfect for both the sides and the meats. The BBQ sauce was good- not thick and syrupy. The spicy had a nice kick to it and the sweet wasn't too sweet which was nice. I have to admit, I was worried this place would taste too chainy but it did not. We'll be back with the kids."}
{"text":"Just walked in for dinner and was completely ignored by the 3 male workers behind the counter. If I could have given them 0 stars I would. We have eaten at Dickies before when it was on Shea. Upon walking in there was no greeting or direction on where to go for ordering. When I walked to the cashier to order I was redirected to the start of their prep line to order. So I walked back to the start of their prep line to place our XL family order. After being ignored and listening to two workers bicker about how things should be done we decided to walk out and go to NYPD pizza for dinner. So disappointed with how we were treated! I hope the older couple who were about to walk in after us had better luck at getting some food than us. Want to be ignored and listen to workers bicker amongst themselves on how things should be done? This is your place then. Otherwise go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I grew up in Texas.  I have eaten BBQ all over the country from CA - TX- KS-SC in the past 40 years.  This is no joke. This has to be the worst restraint and dirtiest that I have ever been to.  If you like fat brisket, low quality food and no air on a hundred degree day,  then you might like this garbage.  I really hope I don't get food poison tonight. Make the drive across town to Rudy's if you really want good barbecue or Bryan's in Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"This is some fast BBQ. You order before you sit down and they make your plate as you order. I had brisket and chicken with Mac n cheese and salad. They give you the option of sliced or chopped for the brisket. Both meats were juicy and tender. They have an ice cream machine by the drinks, nice surprise.  Oh and they have crushed ice which is the best with their sweet tea."}
{"text":"I loved the attitude, menu and prices here. I loved the sides too. Mac and cheese and the mashed potatoes casserole was excellent. I also liked the sausage . Good stuff. Of course the base of every pit BBQ place is pulled pork. I had a three meat plate to try things out. While I liked the flavor of the pulled pork, I have to say it was very dry and dissapointed me. When you try real pork BBQ , one must try it without sauce first and try the sauce next. I did so and the pulled pork was just dry and that was not good. The sauces and everything else was good. My third meat selected was the BBQ ribs. Just a couple ribs but it was a lot of meat. It was tasty and moist. The ribs were very fatty but I don't mind that since it keeps the meat moist.  Again , the staff was great and everything else was going good. But when I went for lunch, the pulled pork was just dry. I will return a second time to see if this was an aberration and it normally is moist. I'm hoping so."}
{"text":"This is my second trip to this location.   I came back because my first trip was so tasty    I will not be back.   The two young women working were walking around like it was so terrible that they had to work - one was on a cell phone.  Very little interest in waiting on me or the other two people in line.  Literally the girl who took my order still had her phone in her hand and I had to repeat three things to her because she wasn't pa ying attention."}
{"text":"This review is only on customer service NOT food  Not happy with them. It says they close at 10pm on saturdays and we show up at 8:30pm and they tell us they're closed! Drove from NM and looked forward to their food for nothing!  Please change your advertised hours on both the website and yelp!!!!"}
{"text":"Fast and Friendly service! Absolutely delicious!! Seriously finger licking good! The ribs fall right off the bone and they are juicy. I can't wait to go back and try the other items. They also have a daily special every day and it includes sides and a drink."}
{"text":"Wow. Just the perfect thing after a frustrating day. I had the lunch special which was the 2 meat pulled pork and sausage sandwich. It was fantastic. Another place for a good meal in North Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been here one time, it did not \"Wow\" me. It did not leave a good impression. The food was dry for the most part. It was overrated. I have not had the urge to go back here.   [Reader: Please add me as a friend!]"}
{"text":"Much better than I anticipated it would be.  Too bad they don't do burgers and other backyard bbq staples."}
{"text":"Stopped by here when I came to see if a certain baking company was still open. Nice little casual joint, with everything that you would come to expect from a barbecue place. Had a few meat items, baked potato, and a few sides. Everything was absolutely fine, but that's about it. Nice place to come for a fix, but there wasn't anything that jumped out at me enough to make the 30-minutes drive out here again. If you live close by and are wanted a halfway decent piece of brisket, then you could do a lot worse. However, you could also do a lot better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Dickey's is always a go-to lunch destination for our work group! Stacy and crew always put out top notch food. She is always very helpful and friendly - and MOST of her employees are helpful and friendly as well.  I am actually a bit surprised by the low rated reviews. I understand the confines are cramped - but when is the last time you moved into a restaurant? Anywho, everything on the menu is delicious. Yes, sometimes the quantities can be a bit tiny for the price - that is one negative - but, boy is it tasty goin' down the throat hole... And you can follow all that with a free vanilla ice cream cone. Go ahead - your parents aren't watching - you don't even have to clean your plate! But, why would you not clean your plate? It's Dickey's and It's barbeque!!  Join the rewards program too! Its worth it...  Don't forget: They cater as well! I have used them a couple times to cater our auto dealership Saturday lunches that I coordinate and Stacy always takes care of us - even with our tiny budget!"}
{"text":"Witnessed the manager reprimanding 2 employees in a very disrespectful voice. He was wearing a purple shirt Thursday May 24. He needs anger management classes! I felt so bad for the woman behind the register."}
{"text":"Ordered online and got there after my pickup time and my order still wasn't ready. They even completed other people's orders who hadn't even ordered by the time I had informed I was there and my order was not correct. One of my orders didn't come with the bun it was supposed to and I had ordered sliced brisket and got chopped. The corn bread muffins were dry and the buns are gross, dense, dry, little tiny baby buns. They use a lot of garlic on the potatoes, fries, and okra which is ok, I did really like the okra. There was a huge chunk of fat/skin with no meat in my turkey; the turkey was just ok as was the brisket. My daughter really liked her pulled pork. They need mire than one sauce station or an easier way to get sauce, like in squirt bottles especially for Togo orders.  We will try it again but probably not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Fast service. Staff was very friendly and welcoming. They asked us how our food was and thanked us for coming. I got beef brisket and BBQ honey ham. Ham was so tender and beef brisket was so good!! I love how there is a option of BBQ sauces. I got the spicy and it was just right. Macaroni was good. And the baked potato casserole was similar to mashed potatoes with green onions and cheese. My fianc√© got beef brisket, chicken breast and pulled pork. He loved all his meats. Best part about his meal was the fresh fried okra. It was piping hot and not mushy in the middle. They have two different types of potato salad-mustard and mayo based. He got mayo based and liked it. They also offer free ice cream which is a bonus! I would definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Staff not well trained, very disorganized!  I placed an order for a pulled pork sand. with Cole-slaw, and a Coke.  The cashier rang up the entire order wrong, had to cancel and do it again, as others were waiting, asked what was my side, had to explain I did not order a side....poor training.  The food was mediocre, nothing special and I felt over priced for the portions they serve.  Possibly I was there too soon after their opening, but they should have been trained before!----the whole experience was one I would not want again!"}
{"text":"Great food and super friendly service! Spicy Cheese sausage was great! My super picky son even cleared his plate. A rare occurrence. The free ice cream was the cherry on top of a great meal! Great way to cool off from the spicy BBQ. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Being from San Diego I thought I would never find a place like Phil's bbq until I tried Dickey's bbq pit in Vegas. I ordered the 2 meat plate with pulled pork and pork ribs, baked potato casserole, and Mac n cheese. So delicious!! My husband and I have been coming here since we've been here. People are friendly and the restaurant is very clean. Love it here."}
{"text":"I  am sad this place has so many low star reviews. I work behind the shopping center just east of Dickey's, so my boyfriend & I come here often for lunch... to the point where I'm pretty sure the entire staff recognizes and remembers us. It's my favourite lunch option in the immediate area that gets me back to work within my allotted 30 minutes.   I am completely addicted to their Spicy Cheddar Sausage, and the Pulled Pork is also quite delicious. So I tend to stick to their 1 or 2 meat plates. They offer 3 different kinds of BBQ sauce - I always opt for Original, but they also have a Spicy and a Sweet. They offer complimentary pickles AND soft serve ice cream. I don't recommend putting those two things together, but free is always good!   Boyfriend & I have always experienced top notch service here, but we pretty much always come after their lunch rush. Staff has never been anything less than helpful and friendly. We get greeted, they offer to take our empty baskets, and we get thanked when we leave. :)"}
{"text":"The people who work here are rude. I requested half brisket and half pulled pork (instead of just 1 meat) and they made faces like it was such a pain in their rear. The workers are just unfriendly in general. Plus this place skimps you on the meat. It's a shame because the meats are really tasty."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying how thankful I am to have found a little oasis of Texas comfort food here in Vegas.  I've been missing my Texas staples like Tex-Mex and real, authentic BBQ.  I got to Dickey's about 20 minutes before closing, so they were out of a lot of stuff, but the service was amazing.  The host / assistant manager was extremely friendly, offered suggestions and samples of a few of the sides, and went out of his way to make up for the fact that he was out of a few things that I really wanted.  The food - amazing.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  The potato salad was creamy and dilly - just like my mom's.  The mac & cheese was perfect.  The BBQ was nothing less than I would expect from a bona-fide Texas BBQ pit.  If you are hungry for BBQ and happen to be in Vegas, then go to the experts, and in Vegas, that's Dicky's."}
{"text":"Franchise places usually are in the bottom rung on my dining to go to list...BUT I find this place scores on many levels... Even when busy the staff is more than cordial and caring...You enter, spy the menu (like the daily lower cost specials) and order it up at the counter...They smoke the meats right on site and they are way above average in taste and flavor...Sides are numerous and I always do the Mac and Cheese plus devour that super delicious potato casserole...Pay up, get your tray filled and head for a table...You pour the drinks and score one of three types of BBQ sauces...I go with the original and the sweet...Kids will like the no charge soft ice cream for desert...ONLY beef (me so funny) is the parking can be horrid in this super poorly designed center...I'm old dude so we usually show up on off chowing down hours and don't have that far to walk to the front door...Believe me, Dickey's is low cost, very good, and overall a winner whether you eat right there or pack it for the road..."}
{"text":"Decided to try out the new Dickey's and am so glad I did. Tried the 3 meat plate with Pulled Pork, Sliced Brisket, and Chicken and was not disappointed with any of my choices. I also had the Mac and Cheese, Coleslaw, and Baked Beans. If the quality stays this good, I'll proudly call myself a regular."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. Good meats and sides, was higher quality than I was expecting. Friendly, helpful, tasty. They took the time to find out if their sauces were gluten free so my husband could enjoy."}
{"text":"Right when you walk in you can see by how there freshly slice and prepare each order that these people know what they are doing. Their meat, no matter what you order, is perfectly seasoned, extremely tender. Its almost as though they handle their food with love LOL. My boyfriend would go everyday if he couple. I love spicy food, they have a good spicy bbq sauce. Thats a dealbreaker for me. The staff, extremely friendly. We got the backstory the business, and was surprised to find that its a franchise"}
{"text":"Went in for lunch and while the parking lot was jam packed this place had a modest amount of customers and quick service. Down sides were that side dishes are heated in plastic bags and put, still in bags, in the warming table- not great for the environment or for your body :/ The chairs and tables are too big for the space, I realize they want to be prepared to accommodate people but they do it at the cost of having to skinny squeeze around furniture to get a drink, utensils, etc. The staff was eager to take my order and knew how to correctly take a phone coupon"}
{"text":"Food & service was great again.  We will be back again.  BBQ & side was delicious. The free ice cream is a bonus."}
{"text":"This' an excellent BBQ place to enjoy Hickory-Smoked meats.   Be sure to try the sliced brisket sandwich. Also, ask for the daily special and see what's going on that day. I love their regular barbecue sauce as well as the spicy.   Excellent sweet tea, jalape√±o brand and BBQ beans as well.  Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Nice food, quick service. Ive bee to a few other ones and it falls inline with those ones. The ketchup was out but the manager changed it quickly."}
{"text":"Always great, quick service and delicious food. The bathrooms are clean with outside seating in summer. My only reason for bot giving this a 5 star is the lack of seating and parking. Many times Ive been here and just grab the last spot to sit or a few times in summer was forced to sit outside. A handful of times I drove in the parking lot with no where to park so kept on driving and went elsewhere.The lack of parking and seating is costing them business but Ill be back."}
{"text":"Best BBQ, my kids love their free ice cream."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good BBQ at a reasonable price then this is the place to go.  When we walked in we were greeted and we decided what to get. I got the two meat platter. It comes with 2 side dishes which you have a lot of options to choose from. I picked brisket and spicy cheddar sausage. Both were very good. The brisket wasn't dry which is sometimes hard to do. The platter was $12.  I think if you just want a good and fast BBQ plate just come here. Food is good and service was friendly and fast. Plus you get free ice cream!"}
{"text":"I will mostly refer to the food in this situation. I tried the brisket, pulled pork, and smoked chicken. They cook everything fresh right on the premises. It is good bbq for fast food! For sides, I tried the mac and cheese, green beans, and cabbage slaw. Slaw was good, just like I like it. Not too creamy. The green beans were pretty spicy - wasn't expecting that and unfortunately couldn't finish them. The original bbq sauce was also a tad on the spicy side; maybe I am just a wimp. Overall the food was good and for a quick bbq, this will be where I come.   Honestly I should knock it down a star for the service. The guy cutting meat seemed very stressed out, like his job was a very difficult one. The ice cream machine wasn't working (the freeze button needed to be turned on), and we had already promised our kids ice cream for dessert. The lady didn't apologize, just said that she needed to turn the machine on and it would be 10 mins. We had take-out, so weren't planning on sticking around. If she had apologized for the inconvenience I probably wouldn't have minded too much, but the fact that she did not even care or show empathy was really annoying. We went through the nearby McDonald's drive through to get ice cream :/"}
{"text":"Brisket dry, bread tasted like it wasn't baked through, green beans too salty.  Not recommended."}
{"text":"First time at this place wasn't a bad experience. I love the fact that I got to taste samples before I ordered. That's always a sign that a restaurant has nothing to hide.  We ordered take out and it took a few minutes for us to make up our minds on what to order. The server didn't rush us and he answered all of our questions. He was a pretty cool kid.  We ordered just a 2-meat plate. It came with two sides (we got Mac and cheese and bbq beans), a roll, pickles and a piece of onion. We got it all for $12.50. Not a bad price if the full meal is as good as the samples were (I'm currently writing this while taking the food out of the bag, so I haven't tried everything yet).  Oh and let me mention, we made free soft serve vanilla ice cream cones as we left. It's cold as heck outside, but I can't say no to free ice cream. They were pretty good by the way.  So, I'm eating now. I really like EVERYTHING, for the most part. The bbq beans are spicy and I like that. They are better than a lot of bbq places I've had recently. They are not all sauce, I actually have beans. Even with driving 12 minutes to get home, the beans are still really hot.  The Mac and cheese is really \"wet\" or \"runny\", but it's still okay. They added to much water for sure. It doesn't really have a taste. It's just plain ol Mac and cheese. Maybe if I had added salt and pepper, it would have enhanced the taste (I wouldn't know because I didn't add any and now it's gone). Nothing was going to help how loose it was though, except maybe the roll that came included. Maybe I could've soaked up some of the moisture. Too bad, I ate the roll first (It was good too lol).  The pulled pork was extremely good to me. I think it's the best I've had in a long time. It was one of the things I got to sample back at the restaurant. The pork reminded me of Jack's BBQ, back home in Nashville. I think I found a favorite place for pulled pork.  The polish sausage I ordered, as a second meat, was just as good. The server also recommended I taste it too, so I did. I'm glad he let me because I was actually about to order brisket. I'm not sure if I would have loved the brisket like I love the sausage. It's really good.  The BBQ sauce was good too. I enjoyed the flavor. It's kind of tangy and spicy. I would order some and just keep it around the house, if I could. I wonder if I can?  In all, I really like this place. I feel like, if they improve the Mac and cheese (which is already better than a lot of place) they could win an award for the best bbq, if they haven't already. I would definitely go back. I would have to get my owe plate though, because the plates are kind of small, they are not meant to be shared."}
{"text":"Good BBQ chain second one I have tried out, not very many positive reviews on this location. I have to say the food and service at this location was great! The meat and BBQ sauce all very tasty I would come back again! They also have free ice cream :)"}
{"text":"Best thing about this place is the lemonade. And you can buy a gallon of it! Food is pricey for the amount you get. Only one roll comes with meal and also picture shows a drink but thats not included in the meal. Satisfied my pregnancy cravings but wish food was worth the amount i spent!"}
{"text":"RUN!  The brisket was Luke warm no flavor and had fat pockets congealed on it. We waited on the chicken breast it came out literally Cold. The side roll was not edible, hard. The cabbage slaw was spit out after one bite also no good flavor or texture. Tasted old.  The Fried okra and waffle fries were fine the okra actually delicious. I spent 27 bucks essentially on an order of okra and fries I didn't even finish that because I was so grossed out thinking about the hand of the gentlemen that served me my beans and handed me my coke and water cups. His thumb needed to be bandaged. It looked infected and i I could not believe this man was serving food. I've never eaten at this chain before. I don't usually right bad reviews but this was over the top. My wife is pregnant and I would not let her try the beans."}
{"text":"I read through some of these reviews and came to the conclusion that some people don't understand how the rating scale works.   Tonight after making a purchase at a near by store one of the employees made the suggestion to try Dickey's when we asked him what was good to eat in the area. I'm glad we took his advice. The pulled pork is good, albeit slightly chewy. The coleslaw has great flavor, and the mac and cheese was decent. It didn't have any flavor besides cheese, but obviously that's what I expect mac and cheese to taste like. The bbq sauces are thin, but still pack enough tang. I also tried my boyfriends mashed potatoes and waffle fries, both were great. Maybe some Scottsdale locals are just used to eating in fancy restaurants, and expect the cheaper food to taste just as good? Who knows. This place did fine by me."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service the food was AMAZING!! If you like BBQ this is a must try restaurant. Pricing was good. I had the pulled pork and my husband got the chopped brisket plate. The meat was tender and lean."}
{"text":"Good as usual. High quality bbq fast! Clean location. Place was packed but I had my food instantly! Love this place. Always a good quick bbq destination"}
{"text":"One of the better BBQ places we've been to here in Las Vegas especially for an indoor chain. Nice thick slices of brisket, a little dry but had a nice bark and smoke ring on it. They had good red (pinto) beans and not the crappy baked beans so thats a olus in my book. The Mac n cheese was just ok because the noodles were soggy but thats how I like them but not my wife. I also had the jalapeno sausage and it to was ok, was not warm but had a good flavor. I liked that their sauces were warmed up, but they were a plain type but not bad. I had at first thought that it was expensive for the amount of food that was on the tray but I was really suprised cause I got really full AND bonus is the ice cream at the end of the meal.  Now I have lived in TX and TN and have had Fantastic BBQ and let me tell you them Texas boys in Mason and Llano know how to do it but since thats to far to go I would definitely come back and eat here."}
{"text":"Needed a BBQ fix and Dickey's popped up in my yelp search. I ordered online which was super easy to do and drove on over. I walked in and my order was ready to go. I collected a variety of sauces and headed out. Very quick and easy experience.   I ordered meat by the pound. It is a very good price for the amount of food you receive. The meat was delicious and tender with a great flavor. I will definitely be ordering from here the next time I need a fix!"}
{"text":"Good location, good food, good prices, free ice cream (not so good though...), what more can you ask for?   Being from Texas, I've had my fair share of good barbecue. While this place certainly does not compare to places like Franklins/Salt Lick, it's definitely worth going to. I find it MUCH better than That BBQ Joint on Willy which a lot of people claim to be the \"best BBQ in Madison\".   This place has extremely fast service since it's a Chipotle-style tell-them-what-you-want-and-they-give-it-to-you restaurant, but that doesn't take away from the quality. I also have to give this place kudos for the free ice cream machine!  If you're looking for a quick dinner and in the mood for BBQ, I would definitely recommend stopping by here. Tons of parking and quick service with ample seating."}
{"text":"Best bbq in town. Jay can sure cut some meat let me tell you.   Manager Jeff was very welcoming as well. Best brisket I've ever had. My man was even talking to the guys working and mentioned it was our first time there and definitely not our last.   Keep up the good bbw guys."}
{"text":"I love this place. I've had the chicken sandwich and pulled pork. The sides are delicious. The Mac and cheese and greens beans are my fav. The spicey bbq sauce is amazing. The staff at Dickey's are friendly. It is a little pricey but not overly priced. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"Seriously?  I was disappointed after seeing so many great reviews.  It's like fast food BBQ.  It's ok of you want something fast, but its not true bbq.  Tough and spongey chicken.  Brisket was ok.  I've been to many bbq places where there is actual bbq meats being cooked right there with their personal bbq sauces and seasonings.  Plus the bbq sauce seemed watered down and it was just lightly squeezed onto the chicken.  Not even sure the chicken was bbq'd."}
{"text":"This one star is purely based upon poor customer service. I ordered online for a later time and when I arrived at that specified time my order was still not ready. It's not as though they were busy either. There was one family finishing up in line and only one other family eating in the restaurant. I'm a little scared to look into my order when I get home for fear of discovering that there are missing items. Overall, this was just a very poor experience. The restaurant offered no apologies for the late order. When I order online I do so so that I can basically walk in and walk out without the hassle of waiting. That didn't happen today."}
{"text":"They replied to my comments saying the guest response team will reach out to me. I gave them my information and of course no one REACHED out (guess it was too far) or perhaps they don't care, I am leaning towards the later!!!"}
{"text":"I was surprised that I actually liked it. I'm pretty particular about bbq being from the south. My husband and I were there for a late lunch during the week . We were greeted promptly and our food came out fairly quickly as well. I had the pulled pork sandwich with fried okra and onion fries (I think that's the name). They were all good too me. I personally like to add my own sause so I was okay with it not being smothered already. My husband had the brisket with Mac and cheese and green beans. He liked everything except the green beans. I'm a sweet tea junkie so when I'm pretty picky with that too. It was soo good and they have fun shaved ice...can't beat that. They have free ice cream cones if you want them, but we were too full. We liked it. Hubby has been back already...lol. it's nice to have something different and good in the neighborhood. Please keep in mind it's fast food bbq, so don't go crazy with wild over the top expectations. Try it and see, you may be pleasantly surprised...we were."}
{"text":"They have kids \"eat free on Sundays\" and that's what normally drives us to come visit. Aside from that the food is consistent. Today they must have some new employees that didn't know what comes on the salad I normally order cause it was missing some ingredients but as soon as I ask, even though they were ridiculously busy, they apologized and fixed the issue which was very appreciated.  Thank you again Dickeys!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, and though the service sucked when they first opened, the current employees do a fine job."}
{"text":"The bbq was sooo, chewy, barely could get any meat off to eat! Not worth the money!!!! Never going back! Save your money!"}
{"text":"I used to be the duchess of Dickey's Pleasanton. I can't wait to be the duchess of Dickey's Las Vegas! This location has a great set up, but the service is something to be said for. Every employee is super warm & welcoming as well as very knowledgable about the menu. Portions were very generous and I loved how custom the brand has become."}
{"text":"Had this for our luncheon today at work.  Phenom.   It was amazingly delicious we ordered the family style which feeds 6-8.  The brisket was tender .We also had chicken and pulled pork.  The sides were great. We had the green beans, mac n cheese, potato salad, and cole slaw. Just saying for BBQ this place is a must try.  Everything we ordered was perfect.  Good job Dickeys."}
{"text":"The Gentalmen look at Didn't Get Acknowledge when Entering wasn't offer service this was A horrible experience Didnt Even Get a Chance to Order  Food"}
{"text":"Dallas native who moved here to VEGAS 30 years ago. Dickey's was founded in downtown Dallas in 1941, the year I was born. SONNY BRYAN'S and THE RIB were considered \"the best\" BAR-B-Q in DALLAS when I grew up there but DICKEY'S was always good and the best \"value\" with \"free\" soft serv ice cream. Today, I hear the best BAR-B-Q in DALLAS is \"SLOW BONE\".  There was no decent BAR-B-Q (or TEX-MEX) food here when I moved here. Still no \"TEX-MEX\"! I was delighted to learn that DICKEY'S had opened a couple of franchise stores here a few years ago and have frequented the one near the OUTLET MALL (on S. L.V. BLVD.) since it opened. Now, I don't care about the DECOR or atmosphere of a place, its all about the food for me. If you have to DINE \"fancy\" on fine china under CANDLELIGHT and have the server blow smoke up yer dress (like my \"dining snob\" next door neighbor) then don't go to DICKEY'S. BUT, if you want REAL TEXAS BAR-B-Q that is the best I've had in this town, for cheap, DICKEY'S is your place. Just leave your snooty (S.A.P.) attitude at home if you go there! The \"bonus\" is, they have the best \"free\" soft serv ice cream you ever had."}
{"text":"AWESOME BBQ, poor service. I've gone to Dickey's for years in multiple states, but this location seems to struggle- solely with regards to the number of employees that have on. There were only three working the line at 7:00 on a Saturday night; woof. Ice machine ran out- so it REALLY slowed the line down as one left to go fill it... And the ice cream machine ran out. I never did get a cone :(   Basically, if there's more than 5 people in front of you in line, you might wanna bring a book or some snacks-- you'll be there a while."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time last night. Surprisingly not very busy for 7 pm on a Friday night. Might be that it's not the best location. That doesn't matter though they had good food for a good price. Servings were good size. The fried okra was just about as good as the authentic okra one would find back in the southeast states. The staff was friendly and eager to answer any questions. Really cool about the souvenir cups and complimentary ice cream."}
{"text":"We had the Friday special, chopped pork with 2 sides and a yellow cup for 10 bucks! Plus free ice cream!  Great price and food!"}
{"text":"Ordered the brisket sandwich with mac n cheese and fried okra. Service was good and quick with brisket carved. Per order. Sadly the brisket was sliced with the grain and overcooked to mush. The flavor was good though. Fried okra was a pleasant surprise while the mac and cheese was just ok. I will try again when in the area just to try the ribs and other meats along with sides."}
{"text":"Don't usually do this but OMG this food is trash! It's so gross. Employees suck ! Ugh waste of 15 dollars, I am so upset. Literally the worst food I've ever had!!!!!! Do not come here!!!!"}
{"text":"Great BBQ fast food!  The food was VERY filling and tasty and the prices were great!  This will be going on our MUST EAT list whenever we visit Vegas again!"}
{"text":"I keep coming back. The sliders are great; the buns are fresh, the pickle and onion fresh, and the meat the tastiest, most tender stuff I've put in my mouth. Nice warm, northern-upper-altitude type cabin-esque vibe. Friendly staff. Fair prices."}
{"text":"Overall I was very pleased by Dickeys even though I was sad to see the arbys nearest to my house close. I ordered the brisket (amazing) and had some sausage with the bacon green beans and potato salad. All were very tasty. My only two gripes were all the items are ala cart and they don't have like a combo. And the girl who packed me up didn't give me any bbq sauce luckily I have famous daves bbq sauce at home and the meat is so good by itself you almost don't need any sauce."}
{"text":"the food was great.. but the service was soooooo bad.. the employees were constantly yelling to each other from far sides of the restaurant.. one was the supervisor..  the guy gave me attitude when i asked him questions about the menu.. and then again when i asked him about the ice cream machine.. which has a sign on it that says ask the employees for help.. i asked for help and he just said lift up on the thing....  won't be going back to this location.. probably won't go to any of their other ones either.."}
{"text":"1st time visitor and I'm pleased to say we will be visiting again. We were greeted by a very friendly and helpful staff that went over the menu and specials even offered samples. The food was delicious but the friendly staff is what made our 1st visit perfect. Side note kids eat free on Sunday with paid adult and complimentary ice cream. Great job and look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"We get take out at dickey's in surprise. They just ran out of chicken so we ordered the turkey. So glad because it was amazing.  Going back for more to make sandwiches for the week.  Highly recommend this bar b que"}
{"text":"Here we are again trying to find something we haven't tried before and surely we found it at Dickies Barbeque Pit.   We were in search of something different that set itself apart from most usual of flavors and styles out hear in Las Vegas. We saw a Geisha House which we already reviewed and then we saw something that cought our eye sitting in a lonely corner of the shopping center as we've never heard of Dickies Barbeque Pit before.  BBQ pit? Never been to anything like that. So Toni and I strolled in looking for something to fill us up and keep us coming back for seconds. We walked in greeted by two gentlemen working on meats behind the counter. We quickly scanned the menu for anything that would catch our attention and quickly found it.  From pulled pork sandwiches to ribs and brisket Toni and I began to order. She ordered 3 pulled pork sliders with BBQ beans and a large fountain drink. I decided to go the route of Ribs, Brisket and a side of potatoes salad with bread rolls that matched Toni's sandwich buns.   Once we received our food we quickly turned around and grabbed our drinks. To my surprise, the ice machine dishes out small marble size ice which was a plus to me as I love chewing ice and it's more efficient at cooling drinks in this shape. On the other side of the fountain drink table, we saw the ice tea for those who choose a sugarless drink and a free ice cream cone dispenser for everyone to get a free dessert after, during or before your meal.   The items that I recommend at the table were all the fountain drinks are seem to me are quired for your meal. The sauces change the entire plate in one little dab or dip. From sweet, regular or hot, they all cover an individuals favorite taste. I'm surprised that they don't come included but understand that the meat stands on its own merits. These sauses only complimented our meal and completely turned every bite into a new flavor.   The ribs simply fell off the bone, the brisket had an almost sweet taste from the dry rub burned into the outer edges. The buns were fresh and soft and the potatoe salad topped me off to full. Toni enjoyed two of her 3 pulled pork sandwiches and allowed me to enjoy her last trying to dissect every bite and tie it to every sauce and the person who would typically enjoy them.   The location, although in a corner, had a very lovely outdoor eating area for when the sun isn't out on a murderous rampage and the inside was clean and organized from what I saw along with the restrooms. All in all, it was a great BBQ experience and we could tell people enjoyed the atmosphere as even employees from the next door Geisha House came in to break away for something delicious and different.   Highly recommend this place for anyone looking for great BBQ at a fair price for portion."}
{"text":"Recently brought here after church by my niece and nephew (they always take me different places lol) I fell in love with this place! I've never really been a fan of bbq, but this place is really good. They have 3 signature bbq sauces. 1. Regular 2. Spicy 3. Sweet, They have great beef brisket and pulled pork. Kids eat free on Sundays, that's nice for me and other families who want to have a nice lunch on Sunday without breaking their bank account. I get full with the 'Westerner' which has 2 meats and is like 8 inches long, can't beat that! Oh, Free ice cream too!!"}
{"text":"Mine and my boyfriends first time here, we both got the pulled pork original sandwich and a side of waffle fries! We were both really happy with our food it was better than we anticipated! The souvenir cup is a cute little bonus. He enjoyed the spicy BBQ sauce and the original BBQ sauce was just tangy enough for a good kick! We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Accusing customers of lying is a rookie mistake for new hires or young kids who have no customer service experience. For managers, however, it's just plain insulting and disrespectful. Especially over a $2 side of coleslaw... Not to mention the last four times we have ordered from there, the order was wrong and it seems like there's new staff every time I go pick up food."}
{"text":"The pulled pork is where the $ is at! Got the 3-meat plate also with boneless chicken breast and brisket. The chicken was moist but did not have as much flavor as the pulled pork.the Mac and cheese is creamy and the green beans had a nice meaty flavor to it. The Coke Freestyle machine has the flavor mixture set to high so the sodas are excellent!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times and I think its on the higher end of the fast food chain but it's still fast food which comes with it's ups and downs.... I'm not a BBQ connoisseur but I've been on several occassions and each time tried something different. I love their chicken. It has excellent flavor, tender and moist. The Jalapeno kielbasa was tasty. I'm not a fan of their Mac and cheese and their food assembly line was confusing the first time I went in. The person who corrected me on where to order was kind of rude about. It basically seems like a BBQ version of Chipotle and is nice to have as a change of pace from the typical fast food joint."}
{"text":"Horrible. Brisket was so dry that it makes Memphis Championship's look moist by comparison. Ribs were decent, pulled pork was subpar. \"Baked potato casserole\" was nothing more than mashed potatoes, cheese, and green onions.   This is the kind of Q you get when a Franchisee pays a corporate trainer to learn how to work a smoker. It was a disaster. I would fire anyone who A) didn't pay attention to the meat and let it dry out and B) served it anyway.  If people pay good money and are actually happy with this quality of Q, then GOOD barbecue would make their heads explode."}
{"text":"645 pm. Saturday. No ribs. No polish kielbasa sausage. No turkey.  So we went next door to Chipotle.   Hope this place makes it."}
{"text":"Too pricey for what you get. Manager seemed like my presence was annoying him.  Seemed to rather focus on whatever report he was trying to run on the computer and also the phone call he was on"}
{"text":"Very disappointed as first time we ordered from Dickey's. Pulled pork and sliced brisket was dry, green beans tasted like someone dumped a can of pepper on the beans.  Other sides were so so. We had high expectations and sorely disappointed. Not ordering from here again,"}
{"text":"I've eaten at many Dickies in Arizona and always liked their food. I had the pulled pork sandwich today. It was pretty dry. I wanted to get the onion strings and I was told they don't have their fryer yet. I also was craving an ice cream cone. They don't have the ice cream machine yet either. This is the first time I ever left a Dickies BBQ disappointed. I was excited to have a Dickey's Barbecue on the west side. It might just be an off day for them and they are new and not set up yet, but I probably will not come back to this location."}
{"text":"Parking stinks.  Lot is small and closed up.  Meals are  expensive for the type of locale. $6 for a potato is extreme in a place where you order and then sit down.  Not impressed."}
{"text":"This place has amazing tasting food-specials every day and consistantly delicious. The fried okra is terrific,,everything we have had is great -including the (Free) ice cream-"}
{"text":"Brisket is good.  Service isn't all that. Pricy in my opinion.  Small side $2.25. Med $5.75!  One size soda cup $2.25."}
{"text":"Being from the South, I'm always in search of good BBQ.  Typically on Sundays we have Italian Family Dinner!  Well, husband was out of town (he does the cooking on Sunday) so we decided to get \"Take Out\".  I've tried BBQ all over Vegas, never been happy!    Found Dickey's on Yelp, well Emily did.  We decided to give it a try.   It was wonderful, from the minute we walked in we were in LOVE!  The employees were amazing! They were so nice, Mark stated off making recommendations, giving us honest opinions/samples about the food.    Family was very excited about BBQ Sunday, but I think they were a little scared.  Well not for long everyone loved it.  We experienced everything they have; ribs, brisket, chicken, pulled pork, sausage, BBQ beans, Potato Casserole, Cole Slaw even the green bean with bacon.  It was all delightful.  We will go back really soon!"}
{"text":"No matter how good the food, if the restaurant doesn't have good customer service, they aren't worth my time. Is it that hard to fake being nice? Employees are rude (and quite obvious about it) and their portions are too expensive for what you get. Food wasn't bad, wasn't great. Obviously won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We all met after a movie group, we all where treating very nicely, food was great, will eat here again!!!!"}
{"text":"I had a party of 20 catered by Dickies. Everyone loved the food the brisket was so moist and tender, pulled pork was fantastic, the beans were great,  the loaded mashed potatoes were a hit . We had coleslaw also that had a perfect amount of sweetness and tang. We will order from them again . A thumbs up experience. Thank You"}
{"text":"Enormous disappointment...  Upon much deliberation on where to order dinner, our family decided to give Dickey's the old college try. None of us had had it before, but we are all BBQ fans and wanted to see what they had to offer. We checked out the menu online and called in our order for the 3 meat meals. We each ordered brisket, turkey, and hot links along with sides of coleslaw, beans, and potatoes. The meals also come with rolls so we thought this would be plenty of food. Boy were we wrong! Our food was delivered and the first thing we noticed was how microscopic the portion sizes were. One meal wouldn't feed a child! To make matters worse they only gave us 2 meats and no brisket so we were down even more food. There were no sauces to accompany the meats and the meats themselves were dry and flavorless. The sides were nothing special either. Needless to say Dickey's was a huge disappointment.   The only thing good about Dickey's is that it is cheap BBQ, but that's just what it is. Do yourself a favor, spend the extra dollar, and go to a decent BBQ restaurant that cares about the quality and quantity of the food they serve."}
{"text":"The sides are the greatest part of Dickey's. The fried okra is perfection, the baked potato is HUGE and comes with an array of delicious toppings, including the bbq meats, but best of all is the dill potato salad. It has no onions!! Up until this point in my life the only potato salad I have ever encountered without onions are the ones I make myself. The poor kid behind the counter somehow felt the need to apologize that it was dill flavored, clearly not understanding that dill potato salad is the ultimate unicorn of flavors, unheard of in the world at large. I could live on it and it alone. If not for that whole dying of diabetes or malnourishment thing. The jalapeno beans have some actual heat to them and the free ice cream is nice in the heat of a Vegas summer, but I am all about the potato salad."}
{"text":"Not a bad place to go for the great American epicurean feast of SMOKED meats...I have used this place for both single meals, family meals and even catering for business meetings.  1.  Parking - Strip mall parking, it is what it is.   2.  Ambiance - Nice sized restaurant, about 21 tables approximately, so usually it can accomodate most busy days.  3.  Food - Very nice overall. The pork ribs, pulled pork, the sausages are awesome. The chicken is nice too.  The sliced beef brisket is very dry, however, I have not had the \"texas\" style chopped brisket which they claim is \"juicy\".  That I will try next.  My kids like the kids menu, the mac and cheese and all the sauces.  Next time, I am trying the ham, the cheese sausage and turkey. I will be back as it is a good priced deal overall.  4.  Prices - I find it overall that the prices are reasonable. Besides all the meal deals and combo's, you are paying roughly 12.00 per pound for the meat, any meat and if you have a large family, the 42.00 XL Combo deal includes 3 lbs of meat, 3 sides, bbq sauce 8 rolls and that is reasonable.  This can feed a lot of people and at least 5 adults.  Be careful though, as if you all order a drink, they do charge 2.00 and that is an additional 10.00. A good deal is that at the exit, they have a soft ice cream maker and you can get a free dessert. That is a good deal.  5.  Service - Interesting. I find some of the cashiers are very friendly and knowledgeable. Some of the servers that deliver your order to your table are also very friendly and hard working. I find that the cooks or food prep people, and even the managers are not as efficient as the cashier or server. I spent 100.00 there in past two days for two group lunches and on the second day, it was take out and I ask for a serving tong, and the manager did not even look at me, but told the cashier \"Well yeah we have them but he has to pay 1.00.\"  Why not address me when I am 5 feet away and instead marginalize me by telling the cashier who is right next to me?  Then the cooks had to be reminded by me that they left out the rolls, the extra pound of meat I ordered. Do you think that they were apologizing or service friendly?  Nah. I am concerned as this was a take out order and if I left without checking , it would have been an issue.  Overall, the food is about a 3.5 to 4, and the service from the top, their manager and cook, is about a 2. And, by the way, I actually called used them three months ago, called in an order for a meeting while I was on vacation in Hawaii for a business meeting coming up and you know what, the manager told me to call back when they were less busy.    For sure i will be back, I just have to be careful to manage what I order to ensure that I am satisfied, since the management here is a bit challenged.  GK Says, it is smoking, check this place out."}
{"text":"The brisket was dry.  The green beans were bland.  The baked beans were watery.  My daughter thought it was soup. The brisket sandwich was okay. Mac and cheese good.  Fried okra was decent.    The sandwich and one side and drink was $8  Would  I go back?  No."}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch and I was very excited b/c it smelled so good as soon as you walked in. I ordered the $7 sandwich that comes with 2 kinds of meat and I added the 2 sides to make it a combo. I went with chopped bbq and spicy sausage. OMG the sausage was delish! but the chopped bbq got cold quick..that or it was already cold - and kind of dry. I'm from West TX and brisket shouldnt be dry if prepared correctly and cooked to perfection. I wouldnt order the brisket again but i'd def. order the sausage again. My sides  fried okra and bbq beans. Both were very good. and to top it off they have ice cream as you leave.. oh and someone mentioned banana pudding... mmmm what? and pecan pie.. ooh walk away..walk away.  . slowly out of the restaurant b4 you order something so deliciously sinful. And I did.. and decided to go to the outlet mall right behind the restaurant. I walked for 3 hrs hoping to make a dent in my caloric intake of delicious lunch. I'd def. try this place. oh sides were addl $2.00.   nOTE: the nicest workers there.. the guy taht took our plates away was so sweet and genuinely nice.. i was w/ my bf so his niceness was genuine!."}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ but I find the prices to be a bit over priced. You get huge portions though. I consider the food closer to 3 stars but I received really bad service last time we were there. Which normally I would chalk up to someone having a bad day but the gentleman behind the counter who happened to be African American was much nicer to EVERYONE who he helped after us. I not usually one who notices if I am treated differently but it was blatant as he was giving out samples and being super friendly with everyone else when he barely even spoke to me or asked what I wanted to order. I don't know if race truly played a part of he just didn't like my smile but it put me off for sure and was pretty upsetting. Overall its nice because they give you free ice cream and my kids (who happen to be bi-racial) LOVE the ham! I will be back again I just hope that I get treated better next time."}
{"text":"I visit a different location on a regular basis. I was shopping at the Outlet Mall, and decided to pop in and get my 3 meat plate. Seeing a familiar face, Mary from the Rainbow store cheered me up!!  Her hospitality made my day!!  It just feels comfortable like HOME.  I'll be returning here as a trip on my way to work. Thanks for the consistency."}
{"text":"Working at Buzz BBQ for as long as I did, I found a new appreciation for BBQ. The \"Chain\" BBQ around, isn't all that it's TV ads make it to be...  But, Dickey's gets it. The meats are tender as delicious. The smoke ring proves to me that \"slow hickory smoking\" is done on site, and not at the \"Hormel\" factory...   The service at this particular location is always friendly and helpful. If you have any questions, they answer with a smile!!   And who can resist \"Kids eat free Sunday??\" Or the \"FREE ICE CREAM??\""}
{"text":"Decent BBQ. The Brisket was good but I got a bad cut of the ribs, so I was disappointed with that. The fried Okra was very good as was the other side I got, the mashed baked potatoes. All three sauces were good; sweet, original and spicy."}
{"text":"4 stars only because they refunded our money. Ok so I think I'm being fair here with my review. The food was excellent. My family enjoyed everything that we ordered as take out. The biggest problem wasn't the food but the portion size. It was like I ordered from the kid's menu. My boyfriend has sat down and ate here, always raving about the food and how they stack his food to the point that he can't never finish his meal. Needless to say I was excited to sit down and enjoy my meal. I was left with hunger and disappointment :( I will attach photos and you can see the ham that my 3 yr old got was more than the brisket I ordered. I also have a picture of \"double portions\" which to me did not look like it. We did speak to the manager and they did refund and apologized BUT hey ... Food was great.."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ ribs, meat, salads, fries. Very inexpensive and very good. Free ice cream :)  Awesome spot to go to when visiting Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The Husband is all about some good barbecue and first heard of Dickeys during a recent visit to Reno.  When I mentioned that there was a location in Vegas, he was all over it.  One of the bigger pluses on our visit was that I had an Entertainment Book coupon for BOGO free!  Score!  We both decided on the 2 Meat Plate to maximize on the coupon and the variety of food to try.  * The 2 Meat Plate ($10): Signature Chopped Beef Brisket and Sliced Beef Brisket, Waffle Iron Fries, Mac N Cheese - Although it's their signature chopped brisket, the Husband preferred the sliced one more.  The waffle iron fries could be seasoned too.  The mac n cheese was very creamy though.  * The 2 Meat Plate ($10): Spicy Hot Links and Fall Off the Bone Pork Ribs, Fried Onion Tanglers, Baked Potato Casserole - The spicy hot links weren't all that spicy or impressive, sadly enough.  And the pork ribs were just okay.  We were expecting something different from the baked potato casserole when all it ended up being was mashed potatoes with some fixings.  The onion tanglers were just limp onion rings and were only okay as well.  Both orders came with a bread roll and you can help yourself to dill pickle slices and barbecue sauce.  They also offer Sweet Tea in their signature plastic yellow cups that you can take home.  Ultimately, it sounded like a lot more food but in reality, it wasn't all that much.    Overall, it was just an okay experience with only okay food.  On the particular day we went, there was a line going out the door because of a promotion they were offering.  Other than that, we probably won't be back.  It just didn't live up to the barbecue hype we were expecting."}
{"text":"The meat was moist, the portion sizes were ample and I did not leave hungry.  I'd never eaten hear before and as a self proclaimed BBQ connoisseur I was pleasantly surprised with Dickey's.  If I'm ever back in the area I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Despite other reviews we were greeted and had good service.  We had brisket and chicken with potatoes and waffle fries which was good.  We liked the original sauce best.  Good food and was pleasantly surprised after reading all the bad reviews.  Wasn't the best BBQ in the world,  but worth trying."}
{"text":"Not the best BBQ I've had, I felt it was not worth the price. For me the BBQ was too greasy"}
{"text":"Ripoff!!  If you like ribs, I hope you are well off. A full slab, sorry two 1/2 slabs 2 sides and a drink. $35 I should have walked out. But I didn't. They were ok but not $35. I shall never return. If you want great ribs go elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is some of the best barbecue I've had since moving away from the south. I'm a SoCal boy from my early years but spent 6 adult years eating Southern Barbecue which really is the best thing about living there. Since moving back west I've looked for that good flavor again. Well, I found it here! I had a smattering of about everything thing in the menu (someone else paid which of you can get that deal I highly recommend it anywhere you go ;) ) and you really can't go wrong with anything."}
{"text":"BBQ brisket sandwich was great. Meat was smoked well, moist and tender. Nice soft round bun. Good sauces. A good amount of brisket is put on the bun. For $5.50, this is a real good deal. I will go back to get the brisket, but to try other items. Nice greeting and friendly people working here. It took less than 5 minutes to get my food."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for second time this week. Ordering process went quicker. No snafus at checkout. Only had to wait a few minutes for fresh okra which they fry on order.  People before and after me had some errors in orders or  missing sides.  I did hear a lot of \"I'm sorry about that\"  but altogether seemed to go better.   Ordered the 3-meat plate this time with Mac and cheese and okra.  The okra rocked! . The meat plate not so much.  Hard to decipher which was the brisket and which was pork. In my pic the upper left is the pile of fat I had to pick out before even tasting.   I may give them one more shot and that's it."}
{"text":"Great food, affordable daily specials, unique entrees and sides like the jalape√±o and cheese kielbasa and cream spinach. Great service, they chop the food up before you, similar to deli, this spot is a must visit and will be my new BBQ fix."}
{"text":"Great ice tea, free ice cream, really good cheddar jalapeno sausage, good brisket, overall good bbq, Not the best but very good....."}
{"text":"First time here and I'm sold! Brought my almost 3 year old and he loves his food too! I got brisket and pulled pork, onion tangles (amazing!) and Mac n cheese. He got the polish sausage and green beans.  Got 10% off for being a first timer so my bill was just under $16!!! Turns out you get a free ice cream come too! Flavor is legit for BBQ. Kids eat free on Sunday's so- I know we will be back!"}
{"text":"The store was clean, fast, and super friendly. The store manager Dan, IS THE MAN. He was so nice and friend with people who came in. Give this man a raise!"}
{"text":"This place is not the same place as it was several years ago.  The place is dirty.  The bathrooms are gross.  The faucets barely turn on.  Ok, here is the weirdest thing - a worker sat down at our table with us to fill the ketchup bottle.  You think I am kidding, but I am not.  We could not believe it."}
{"text":"Good quality meat is used in their barbecue,  the sauces are southern style vinegar based, each with it's own personality. Side dishes each have their own flair as well. Very enjoyable tasty experience."}
{"text":"Worst Bbq I've ever had.. it was cold upon arrival bread was greasy. My daughter loves pulled pork she wouldn't even eat this. It was aweful. Never again!"}
{"text":"Decent BBQ fast food.   If you don't want a full service meal, then Dickey's BBQ Pit is a good choice. You walk up to order, then your meal is ready at the other end of the line at the register. The prices and portions are decent. They have a variety of side dishes.   Pulled pork is moist and smoky flavored. My friend had the brisket and said it was on the dry side. The sides were delicious!  They offer daily specials and I think kids eat FREE on Sundays. I would return here again whenever I get the craving for some quick BBQ!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the meat here, so much I went back the next day. The jalapeno cheddar kielbasa is my favorite so far. The rolls that come with the meals are some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"We had the three meat platter the mean was very tender but was not what we expected from a great BBQ joint."}
{"text":"The customer service at this pit is absolutely terrible. The food is not worth the aggravation. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"If only I was shown \"super friendly\" - I'll even take friendly service, no super needed maybe then I would have had a better experience my first time at Dickeys. After having amazing, mouthwatering perfectly seasoned Staceys BBQ in Phoenix, it was just my luck driving by Dickeys in Tempe and deciding why not have lunch there since I never had it before! However, I completely regret going there, wasting my money and for allowing my day to be sucked dry on such a beautiful day. I walked into Nicole, a complete mood killer standing at 5 ft something, with a lanky ponytail, who told me that she was Dickey's Manager after me wanting to speak to one. When I walked in, I wasn't greeted at all, she had no personality, (with me at least) and her smile was upside down the whole time, she was so miserable when it was no other customers there but me and one other guy. I was planning to stay there and eat my lunch but changed my mind obviously so took the bag she handed me, maybe she assumed I was getting it to go too. So, I left, got on the highway and after 20 minutes made it home ready to enjoy my thick sandwich.   When I opened my sandwich it was just the meat and bread (sauce on the side). I asked for everything and all I got was bread and meat. I get in the car because I'll be damn if I get treated like a bum on the street and then accept and pay for just meat and bread.  So, I go back to a complete \"I don't give a sh*t\" attitude manager, who gave me a slight shoulder shrug and a meaningless sorry after I tell her I only got bread and meat like I was at the homeless shelter. After getting a correct Dickey's sandwich, I get home, unwrap my sandwich to find that what was missing was only TWO things; dry pickles and a big raw onion.   Pickles and onions. How can anyone forget two freakin little items? And why the carelessness even after recognizing her own mistake and why not try to rectify the time and gas I spend to come back to just get these two simple things? Customer are the reason these businesses STAY IN business.   I would never support this location that has a person who treats customers like this, I'll be damn contributing to your pay.   As far as the sandwich, just go home and use your crock pot to make the meat, fry it to burn the edges a bit then just slap the meat on burger bread."}
{"text":"Second time at a Dickey's.  First was in Texas.  Place is clean and the food is OK+.  Unfortunately,  everything is overpriced for what you get.    Kraft mac and cheese is better than what they sell.  I won't be back.   There are just too many much better options."}
{"text":"Their barbecue is ON POINT! It's actually better than many places I've sampled, even in the south. Their customer service is wonderful; you're greeted almost as soon as you walk in the door, employees are quick to offer suggestions or satisfy any request, meals are served up super-quick, and the restaurant is very clean. I took one star away only because it's a \"fast food\" establishment and not what you'd expect from a typical barbecue joint.  What to order: ANYTHING. It's all good! My personal favorites are the pulled brisket, barbecued honey ham, and the pulled pork. As for sides, I've really never had a bad one. I personally love the onion straws and the mac and cheese is very good also. Don't forget to grab a sweet tea to drink!   Extra bonus: They have all-you-can-eat free vanilla cones to end your meal."}
{"text":"The wife spotted this place when out shopping so we decided to give it a try for dinner. In all we got 3 orders of the 2 meat plate and 1 order of the 3 meat plate so we were able to try just about everything. When entering this place the smell of the food hits you and makes you crave BBQ even more and the staff makes you feel welcome. Got home and the food was extremely cold and dry (no sauce at all), the sides were room temp but had good flavor to them. Willing to give another try but think I'll eat there next time in hopes it will be hot."}
{"text":"They're going to give Rudy's a run for their money. We had ribs, chopped brisket, pulled pork and potatoes. Everything was excellent. Chopped brisket was super tender and moist. Pulled pork had tons of flavor. The ribs had a good smoked taste. All 3 sauces were very pleasing to me. You can get pickles and onions and make a sandwich with their delicious rolls. Place is on the small side but we were comfortable. Staff were very friendly and spoke to everyone. We'll be back for sure. Good addition to Surprise."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine took me to Dickey's yesterday, to have a birthday lunch.  I have not been to Dickey's before, however, I've had many of BBQ, including southern BBQ, so I knew going into this, that I was going to compare.  When we walked in, we noticed a long line of people which meant a very promising meal.  To the left is a big menu for you to decide and the to the right are tables, about 20 of them.  The wait to order was very long.  We spent about 15 minutes in line before we got the opportunity to order our food.  Here's what I got:  2 choices of meat and 2 sides for about $10.  After we ordered, the food came super fast!  I got the Texas Style chopped beef brisket and pulled pork with the fried okra and the dill potato salad.  The pulled pork was delicious and nicely smoked.  The brisket was nicely marbleized, but didn't have as much of a smokey flavor as the pork did.  The okra was crunchy and super good!  The dill potato salad was too sour for my taste.  My plate also came with a couple of pickle slices, onions and a butter roll.  The roll was ON POINT!  So light and fluffy!  I think the BBQ sauce tasted nice and sweet.  This places offers free ice cream to all guests.  Not the best BBQ I've tried, but it was good.  Overall a cool southern vibe that makes the experience comfortable."}
{"text":"Great brisket and jalape√±o cheddar sausage. Kind of pricey, but very high quality meats. I especially like their potato salad and spicy bbq sauce (I like mixing them together). The inside is very neat looking and everyone is very helpful. The best part is if you are sneaky enough, you can walk away with a free ice cream cone. They are only supposed to be for dine in."}
{"text":"We had a gift card and went in for lunch was fast service and great food. Will come again !"}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place. We heard kids eat free on Sundays so we definitely wanted to take advantage of that. But then we learned why...   Kids chicken nuggets are actually the store bought Dino Nuggets you can pick up at any local grocery store. Their waffle fries also  tasted like they came from the frozen food isle. If we knew this ahead of time we would have just stayed home.   My husband and I shared the 3 meat platter and we were completely underwhelmed. We aren't snobs and we don't like to waste, so we ate as much as we could stomach and decided to test out everything so we can warn others.   Their beef brisket was mainly fat and extremely chewy.   Their chicken was subpar at best and lacked flavor.   Their pulled pork was dry and needed to be drenched in sauce.   Both meals came with a hard ciabatta roll.   The coleslaw was soupy and the cabbage was not fresh.   We also had the side of potato salad. It was ok. I usually down potato salad even if it's store bought and I just couldn't stomach this one.   My kids got a free soft serve cone which was awful. Have you ever known a 3 and 5 year old to throw out ice cream!?!?   We also noticed they made their lemonade from store bought jugs I saw once at WinCo but didn't get because of the insane amount of sugar and the lack of actual lemon juice.   I gave two stars to the two employees who were at least friendly but obviously lacking in customer service etiquette, as one of the employees told another customer that they didn't have any ribs because they didn't make any today because someone forgot to clean the pit....  he gave her $5 off but it was just so unprofessional and didn't make us feel comfortable."}
{"text":"I think this place is under new management. No where near the service, or cleanliness it used to be. I ordered my food. It looked great, taste great, and was hot. I always get sweet tea. I told gentlemen behind the counter there was no sweet tea. He said I'll be right out to make some. We must have different opinions of I'll be right out. He and he's friend had to discuss something on their phone. 5 mins later he made the tea. I got up to get some. He didn't sweeten it. I told them. Something on the phone was way more important than their job. Before I left they finally sweeten the tea. I was one of three customers in the restaurant. They had plenty of down time while I was there but they played on phones instead of cleaning. Drink and condiment area was a wreck. I will think twice before coming back here. My photos tell the whole story dirty areas around drink machines, items almost out. Needed to be stocked. I'm giving a one because the food was good but judging off everything else I wonder if my tray was clean and how clean it was behind the counter. Not happy with this visit! Guess that's what happens when you leave a couple kids in charge."}
{"text":"Exceptional food especally the chicken and mac and cheese.  You can definitely tell the meat is fresh. Great lunch spot. Cannot wait to go back and try more items."}
{"text":"Decided to try some barbecue tonight, however they were out of everything!! On a Friday night!! The people behind the counter said they got busy early and ran out of meat. LoL. I asked why they couldn't cook more and she said that it wasn't worth it. The ladies were very rude! When advised them that they lost our business due to poor food planning, the lady said \"that's ok\". I guess they don't care if they are in business or not. Very SAD. The owner should be furious with the people working there."}
{"text":"Just had the brisket salad, I must admit the brisket is very good.  The salad itself is quite small for $8 but it was tasty.  Service was friendly but slow"}
{"text":"After putting off going to Dickey's for a few weeks after receiving gift cards, I finally drove over to pick up dinner last night. I've never been the biggest BBQ fan and by no means am I a BBQ expert (after all, I am from NYC... I know pizza and other things but not BBQ). I didn't know what to expect from Dickey's. Recent BBQ I've had elsewhere wasn't all that impressive to me and I found myself wishing I had something else instead. The decor is cool and about what you would expect for a franchised (I think) joint. The service was a bit awkward and I felt like one of the guys working for sure was either pissed off or just did not want to be there. I don't think he smiled once the whole time. The other guys were ok and they lady at the register was very nice and friendly. The counter where you place orders is really high which I can imagine is not customer friendly for those of you under 6 feet tall. For me it was a bit high and I'm 6'2\". The guy taking the order is also the one dishing out the meat which is a bit strange... almost like a BBQ version of Subway except you can't see everything going on. Not comparing the food to Subway... just the experience. Think they need to work on some things here. Maybe it was just because it was late? Not sure. Anyway... to the food.  The Westerner Sandwich - choose 2 meats - I ordered pulled pork and brisket - comes with onions, pickles and cheese. I didn't want this sandwich to end. Everything was delicious. I never really been fan of pickles on my sandwiches but I gave it a try and it was awesome. Meat was delicious and cooked perfect for my liking. Giant Baker + Meat - texas chop brisket - with the works. This thing was GIGANTIC! KC thoroughly enjoyed it and has leftovers for lunch.... and dinner... and maybe another lunch. Mac & Cheese - typical BBQ joint mac & cheese. Nothing fancy, just the basics. Fried Onion Tanglers - basically skinny onion rings and a must side for BBQ for me. Threw some on my sandwich and I was golden.  Will be back. Hope they open more locations around Vegas. Guess I'm a fan of Texas style BBQ."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere,  fantastic food, and amazing service!  The menu is big, with lots of selections.  Everything tastes like it's made by your Gramma in her own kitchen!  The mac and cheese is definitely southern style!- rich and creamy. All the sides are truly like home made. The service is 2nd to none.  I went in with a funny shirt on, and they made it happen!  See the pic.  Thumbs up to Lee, Robert, and Evie for a perfect meal & experience. Highly recommend and will return!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time going to dickys bbq there mac and cheese was delicious there pulled pork was also good but there brisket was a lol dry rolls were also good but the reason why I will not be returning to any of your locations will be because of your staff I don't know if it was a manager but I think it was when I got my order he did not acknolege me or say good bye to me but the WHITE guy before me he almost got out of the back to say thank you for coming the manager saw me when I left and got my order but still did not say nothing to me the only person who said anything to me was a latino female who was in the front that's not how you want to start your business in a latino neighborhood I will also tell my friends and family around your location to think twice before going there"}
{"text":"Honestly, I think her name is Jayla... she was extremely rude and bad attitude. The blonde girl who cashiers is always super nice and professional. Other than the horrible customer service from Jayla,  the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I have been a steady customer of this location for quite awhile.  They utilized Spendgo to keep track of purchases and earn points which were good for free meals.  I accumulated enough points for two of their daily specials when the program was cancelled.  Their email referenced an intention to initiate another program and the points would be carried over but he email was not very clear.  I went in to see what was what and was not helped at all.  Apparently only the owner can solve such a major problem, so they took my name and number and said he would call.  He didn't.  Fortunately there is a nearby Dickey's that just opened that is not owned by that guy.  (He does own another one in Chandler.)"}
{"text":"Dickey's saved my Thanksgiving!  My brother & I decided to do Thanksgiving w/ friends super last minute. Hash House a Go Go ran out of turkeys. WTF. So did Mimi's Cafe, Lucilles, and Famous Daves. Double WTF. I needed Thanksgiving to-go and only 2 days to do it! Dickey's had 2 turkey options for $49.99--Cajun Fried Turkey or Smoked Turkey. Of course, they were sold out of the fried turkey but they had 1 smoked turkey left. I called dibs!!!  The pick-up process was easy. Zipped in and out within 5 minutes. They're closed on Thanksgiving so pick-up needs to be the day before. They're open late so I picked up around 7pm. The turkey is wrapped in foil and comes in an oven-safe aluminum pan ready-to-heat. It takes about 2 hours for the turkey to reach eating temperature. Excellent packaging since my friend just moved to Vegas and has minimal bake/cookware available. I needed low maintenance food and Dickey's definitely made the holidays a bit easier for me.   The turkey itself was pretty tasty. I was a little concerned that the smoked turkey wouldn't have the Thanksgiving flavor I was looking for but it was delicious. Not the best I've ever had but very good. As much as I love cooking and being able to put all the flavors I want into things. It was a relief to not have to deal with cooking a large bird and focus on the epic games of Settlers of Catan and Wii Tennis."}
{"text":"Since having Dickey's for the first time last year I have to say I was extremely excited to know they had built a location right down the road from my home. As always the food was great. I'm not to fond of their rolls as they taste like literal flour but that's not important. Had the 3 meat plate last night and it is still just as filling as the first time I had it. They were out of turkey and had to substitute with chicken. Which was fine considering the time of night I ordered (oops sorry). I have yet to venture into any other meats as I am stuck in certain ones I like, but I am sure that everything is just as good. Oh! And they are partnered with door dash which is how I lazily ordered last night. Overall food was great at this location!"}
{"text":"Both times Ive been there, lunch and dinner, they had lines out the door... Free Ice cream, excellent meat, sides, and rolls.  Gotta try it to believe it... Dont throw out your yellow cup, refills are only 99 cents on future visits!"}
{"text":"Have been a faithful customer of Dickey's BBQ Pit ever since trying it once. Pulled pork, brisket, chicken, turkey, ribs -- they have it all! Service is friendly and you get free ice cream with any order. Their barbecue sauce selection is stellar and all of it is delicious. Save yourself some time by ordering online and picking up in person. The next closest barbecue by distance is Rudy's, however Dickey's is light-years from Rudy's in taste."}
{"text":"Dry brisket, unexciting bland sides and costs the same as good bbq. Wish I could love it because I live close, but there are much better options close by. The place was spotless and looks like there is free ice cream to make floats out of, so it's not horrible or anything."}
{"text":"Yikes! Went on a recomendation from a friend and boy did they get it all kinds of wrong here! First off, i felt rushed to order. There was nobody behind us and if there were i would have let them ahead of me. They kept asking us if we were ready, NO, we are looking at the menu, CALM DOWN! We will order shortly. Secondly, the rude staff (Look at Firstly). They all were really hounding us to Order. Then, after the first order, the cashier was on me to pay quickly. (Again, Nobody behind us). I told him once all the orderes were put in and verified, then i would pay. I got a nasty look. Oh well, you will wait for me, I will not be rushed. I was never asked to order a drink, nor were my friends. We were not told about the free ice cream. Had no idea about it. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I don't know about those other reviews, I just ate here for lunch, and was very impressed. The restaurant was clean, the staff was friendly. And the meat was delicious. I really enjoyed the spicy barbecue sauce. And I really love the smoked turkey. A++++"}
{"text":"Attempted to eat here tonight. Waited for 20 minutes and the line didn't move. Witnessed an older man who was working be a complete dick to anyone who asked him a question. After the line didn't move in that 20 minutes my husband and I called in Bobby Q's to go, which was ready in 15 minutes, and obviously better. Won't be attempting to try this place again."}
{"text":"This is so far my favorite BBQ place in Phoenix.  Me and my boyfriend are at the new location on Peoria and close to 28th drive.  The brisket sandwich was excellent!  We got to try samples.  We are there and the aroma was incredible!   It was nice and clean!  I had the Blondie brownie which was really good too!   Me and my boyfriend just fell in love with this place.   Ooh and they have great daily specials!   They're a keeper!  Lol"}
{"text":"As soon as you get out if your car, the delicious smells don't let you walk away. Just grabbed some dinner here. Their BBQ beans are great. Just what I was looking for. Their sauce (spicy) is also really good. Their waffle fries were just eh. They were kinda soggy and I think they could have been seasoned better. Just blah. I got the pulled pork and sausage sandwich. It was ok. Kinda wish it had a little something extra..(maybe hotter when I got it and I prefer the meet IN sauce instead of dry on the bread). I will definitely be back to try the ribs and other things. Service was good. Also, I liked that even though this place wasn't \"cheap\", they did have more affordable options like just the sandwich for $5."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, I really did. I've been to the ASU location once before and it was pretty good however this one did not live up to those expectations. The staff were good at explaining what everything was as I was confused on the order. Ordered pulled pork sandwich, Mac and fried onion strings. Also my friend got a rack of ribs and a sandwich. I was so excited but when I got home to eat I realized there was no sauce, my god, isn't that what they're famous for? BBQ...with sauce?   Who orders all that meat and doesn't expect sauce? Which I'm told they always provide. No thanks. Meat was very dry otherwise and bun was spongey... And they have free ice cream? No one told me that... I love ice cream. Plus my sandwich came with onions and pickles on it, meanwhile I said several times I hadn't been there before and didn't know what all came on the sandwich and I was assured it was just meat. I would have specified just meat yet again if I had been told that or read that.   I didn't finish the sandwich, the strings were good and the Mac was alright but it's really glorified melted cheese on pasta.  **Comment Response**: I don't know how to private message nor did I think users could message establishments.

{"text":"Worst bbq I've ever eaten at this location.  I was served ribs that were hard and inedible.  The brisket was more fat than meat.  The Diet Coke was pretty good.  Don't go here the kid cutting meat was clueless and could have cared less.  The Dickey's on McDowell has better service and I've never gotten sub par meat there."}
{"text":"Great Texas BBQ!! I think it's better than Rudy's because it's closer and tastes like great Texas bbq without needing to go to Texas.  If you don't like Texas bbq then why would you go to at a Texas-based placed? The sweet tea is great,  the three sauces are great so you have options of regular, sweet and spicy. I'd prefer more bacon bits in my green beans but at the end of a day, when all I have to do is order food,  bring it home, eat it, and melt in my couch,  I'm happy. The staff were really nice and helpful too in making decisions.  I'm excited to try the Texas Frito pie!"}
{"text":"So I waited in the line for 40 mins today to get Dickey's BBQ and was serenaded by the staff complaining that the reason they were slow was that management didn't have the courtesy to show up this afternoon for their shift. Obviously, not many workers showed up either. So bad to hear the workers talk negatively about the workplace to the customers. It is Sunday and kids eat free so the family in front of me had 6 kids.  I got served the dregs of beans that the kids didn't want as a side. It was  just a cup of cold bean juice soup with no beans - no quality control. I spent $16.95 for a rib plate and this is how I am treated. The ribs are okay but cold - I felt ripped off. Wonder if the kids free meal was hot.  I guess the kids come first. Maybe if management showed up to work it would have been a different story. So I see a ice cream machine available with cones for samples but the kids had drained it dry so the machine no mix in it. I got no ice cream cone even though I am paying customer. I will never go back to this location - obviously the customers are not important."}
{"text":"Seen this establishment once on our way to the grocery store and there was a long line outside, so we went back a few days later, I had the racetrack sandwich and my friend ordered half rack of ribs where the meat fell off the bone, the BBQ sauce was delicious, the people were extremely nice, I would recommend coming here.."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, super clean, well organized. I love the kids eat free Sunday special. The sausage was great so were the baked beans. The mac and cheese wasn't my favorite, but my son loved it. And the brisket wasn't my favorite. I'll go back, I just won't get the brisket."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh this bbq was bad. I hate giving bad reviews and I'm always somewhere in the middle. Stopped in being that I'd never heard of this place. I was in the area so why not! I thought it was weird that walking up to the place I didn't smell the smell of bbq anywhere. I didn't let that deter me. There were two people inside but it could've been because it was around 5 pm. I'll rate below:  Brisket-- Insanely bad. This tasted exactly like a roast. There was so much fat on it. If you want bbq roast, then go for this. Mac & Cheese-- Definitely nothing special  Green beans w/bacon-- I think I saw about 3 pieces of bacon Rolls-- HARD! Turkey-- Pretty good  My husband is the type of guy who eats anything and after picking over his food, eected to throw it out. This is just my opinion and I see that some people like it but I will not be trying this again."}
{"text":"I would have to agree with most of the reviews for Dickeys... I got what I thought was a great lunch deal....a brisket sandwich with 1 side and a drink for $6.00.  The bread was ick...nothing at all special , the meat was dry and VERY bland with 2 tiny rings of onion and 2 small pickle slices....if it wasent for the average bbq sauce I would have tossed the sandwich and learned where NOT to go for BBQ!  I chose cole slaw as my side which like the brisket was bland and nothing to speak of.  One  of the people in my party had mac and cheese....\"can you say boring\"?  Althought another person got the \"baked potatoe casserole\" as a side which was actually really good..... in fact I would say it was the best thing I tasted there.  A nice perk is the mini ice cream cone you make yourself.....especially when you put it in a cup and add Root beer!     Dickeys is the closest BBQ place to me and yet I would rather go without or take a drive to the next closest place.  Food is s personal preference and I am the most PICKEY person I know and the only reason I would go back is to get some more of that potatoe casserole!  You decide....and in the meantime....  Bon Appetite'"}
{"text":"This place truly made me realize how spoiled I am by Rollin Smoke and John Mull's. Unimpressed with the quality of meat. The only cool thing is that they give you free soft serve vanilla ice cream cones- but 2/3 of the members of our family have dairy allergies. The spicy sauce was actually decently spicy! And the staff was really great despite the food."}
{"text":"The food is decent, one of my wife's favorite places. But I've walked out on more than one occasion because of the slow service. They really need to improve their efficiency. If there's more than 2 or 3 people in line just find somewhere else. Portion size is a bit weak too as evidenced by their careful weighing of EVERYTHING."}
{"text":"Just ok. Had the ribs. I have had better bbq however it wasn't terrible. The two teenagers at the counter had a little bit of an attitude, they said all the right things just didn't seem real happy to be working there."}
{"text":"Honestly we need new BBQ in the Northwest! I keep hoping it's just a bad visit and next time will be better but it never is!"}
{"text":"The food tastes really good but for what you pay you don't really get that much food, maybe it's cause it was carry out, you pretty much get 4 slices of what you order. I guess if you want more go to an actual restaurant. The place itself was very clean and the staff was very nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Please don't bother going here. My husband  and I came here recently and it took 45 minutes for us to stand in line and walk out the door with our food. The staff were yelling at each other and it was clear that there was no organization in anything. The tables were not cleaned from previous customers. I will take my chances at other sit down barbecue restaurants in the area, I will not be going back to this location at all."}
{"text":"Last night I surprised my boyfriend by offering to take him out somewhere for some BBQ. I was told by a friend that this place is pretty awesome. Turns out she might have a bit of a bias since she used to work here.  When we arrived there were 2 highschool girls 'working' the counter (they were really fooling around and it looked like they were throwing the sour cream packets around. They were fooling around the whole time, which I understand having some fun, but ya know what? Do it where I can't see it. I don't want to think about you playing floor hockey with my food!)  When I ordered they  told me that they were out of chicken and french fries (on a Monday night). Wow. Really? So I thought about it and instead of chicken I had the pork stuffed inside a baked potato. The food wasn't too bad, but it also wasn't the best I've ever had.   My boyfriend and I agree that the best part of this place is the free pickles and free ice cream. Maybe I'll try this place again after spring break is over ;)"}
{"text":"Let me just say this is not the first time I got food poisoning from this location. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich same thing I ordered the previous time and got violently. And the service here sucks it took me ten minutes just to get recognized"}
{"text":"I expected more from this place even though it's a chain restaurant. I ordered a half a rack of pork ribs and brisket sandwich. The meat on the ribs was dry and had the texture of the kind of ribs you get when you buy a precooked rack of ribs at your local supermarket. The brisket sandwich didn't impress me either. Maybe I just came here on a bad day.  As for the prices they are reasonable, but I can not justify coming back here again for the food. At least the BBQ beans where good, but then again it's hard to mess that one up.   Famous Daves or Lucilles BBQ is much much better in my opinion. And the best BBQ rib joint in Vegas is John Mulls road kill in North Vegas."}
{"text":"I lived so close to here, so I did come a few times... but wasn't very impressed. The food was fairly dry and flavorless for being BBQ food. Not terrible, but not great or satisfying."}
{"text":"Never disappointed coming here! Always great food and helpful staff when it comes to choosing. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This was our first time in this establishment across from Ballentyne Village. We thought it was great and I appreciated them offering some grain-free/low-carb sides, which not always the case.   I had the pull pork; the wife and kids had the brisket; zero complaints. They even offer free soft serve ice-cream for dessert.   The staff was very welcoming and friendly. We'll likely frequent this place after church on Sundays -- and kids eat free on Sundays too."}
{"text":"Not great barbecue.  I've eaten here 4 or 5 times over the last 6 months while going out to lunch with coworkers.  The meat used in the sandwiches comes out of steamy plastic wrap that is kept in some sort of warming bin.  Barbecue sauce is just basic.  If I want good barbecue, I'll go to Famous Dave's or Honey Bears.  Sorry."}
{"text":"They ran out of ribs, sausage, and Brisket!!!!!  It gets worse, they ran out of change and wanted me to change my order or use my card (which I left at home)... insanely unprepared to be open yet."}
{"text":"Service was great, food was tasty. The owner even spent time talking with me. I liked it so much I'm going to buy one!"}
{"text":"The food is always good. The waitstaff was FABULOUS. Very attentive and helpful. One of the side items was a little too spicy for my taste and they replaced it no questions asked even said I could give the other side to my guest cause they couldn't take it back. Seems simple and what everyone should do but harder to come by these days. Then they brought my new side to the table and asked if they could get us anything else! I'll be back and back and back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, Went to Dickeys for the first time on Wednsday here in AZ,Could not have been better from Counter Service to the food served. Ribs,Brisket,TX Toast,Mac-Cheese and Beans as well as the Sauce they Bottle and Serve. Have returned a 2nd time already this week."}
{"text":"I'm a big BBQ fan.  It really hit me on a trip to Memphis a few years ago and I had the real deal.  Since then, I'm always open to see what local joints have to offer.  I haven't found the time to hit Dickey's since they opened up off Greenway Blvd.  Finally I was able to eat there, and I was not disappointed.  The restaurant is clean and open.  The folks there were nice (enough).  I thought the menu was pretty clear, and I liked the daily specials posted right in front of your face.   I went with the pulled pork sandwich with sides of cole slaw and onion strings.  I always get cole slaw with my BBQ.  And I'm picky about my slaw.  It was good.  Not great, but not bad.  The onion straws were fantastic.  Fresh made and tasty as could be.  Now, with onion straws, you have to know what you're getting into.  They could very well haunt you later, but that's part of the deal.  I didn't care.  They were fantastic.  The pulled pork was pretty good.  VERY tender with a good smokey flavor.  The sauces were available in pumpers off to the side.  I tapped a mix of \"hot bbq\" and \"original bbq\".  I should have had more of the \"hot\" in the mix, as it didn't really make the sandwich pop like I wanted it to.  Don't get me wrong - it was really good, but the sauce could have been better.  \"Honey BBQ\" was also an option, but I'm not into the sweet stuff.  A nice touch was the free ice cream available.  It was a bit soupy - firm enough to hold it's shape, but you could literally blow it off the cone if you wanted.  It was free, so nobody was complaining.  :)  Dickey's is a nice place to grab a good BBQ lunch.  It's a great change of pace from the run-of-the-mill burger/pizza options.  I'll probably explore their menu more, trying some of the other meat options, notably the ribs."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience! I walked in shortly before they closed and received great food and exceptional service. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Never again will I step foot in this establishment!! The food has gone downhill, the staff is unprofessional and the manager John is more unprofessional than his staff.  My husband and I came into eat on a Sunday afternoon and every single table was dirty and there was not one single customer in there. One of the employees was sitting in the lobby with his friends obviously not worrying about cleaning up any of the mess for customers. I had to ask for a towel to wipe down a table just so we could eat. The area where the sauce is was a mess and the floor looked like it hadn't been mopped in a week! As we are having our lunch we hear very inappropriate conversation going on between the employees and their little friends in between all of them going outside to \"vape\" right in front of the front door!! The worst part is when I sent a message to the manager he basically had every excuse you can think of and seemed to be very hostile!!  If I could have given zero stars I would have!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here. Portions are great sizes and i enjoy the fried okra. The serves us really quick and everyone is friendly here. I love the sweet tea, the recipe is always correct. Only fault is a feel its a little pricey. It could be about 2 to 3 dollars less in price."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Food is good, everyone is friendly and it's clean.   Had the pulled pork today very tasty"}
{"text":"Went on a Wednesday night with wife and daughter.  Very happy with the atmosphere and food.  We got the Picnic Pack Family meal.  Corn bread was more like a cake muffin but I like sweets.  We got Mac n Cheese and Green Beans as sides."}
{"text":"Friggen awesome food. The staff is always awesome and today I just found out about their peach cobbler OMG! It's only available some days usually Friday Saturday Sunday but gave me a sample today... just adding to my craving for their food yummmmm nom nom nom"}
{"text":"For a quick bit of BBQ at lunch this is OK - It's a tiny step up from most fast food. I'm not a huge fan of their side orders, but the beef brisket is decent, as is their spicy bbq sauce, which I drowned it in. Good inexpensive place to bring little kids who are new to BBQ."}
{"text":"Not that bad for a chain. I prefer their Texas style brisket and the pulled pork. The Jalapeno beans are pretty good too. I haven't had them yet but the baby back ribs looked amazing. I also really like their spicy BBQ sauce!"}
{"text":"Not bad for bbq, not the best but still good.  Ordering part was a little frustrating and they messed up my order but quick to fix. Had to wait for the fried okra but it was pretty tasty. Price could be better..."}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices. I love their biscuits and fries and especially love the chopped brisket with the sweet sauce."}
{"text":"Excellent Service! Excellent BBQ! Love the Brisket, YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS PLACE you won't be disappointed. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been ordering catering from Dickeys for a couple years. Food is always delicious, The staff is always very attentive, Their prices are very affordable. I always recomend Dickys to anyone I know."}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience here!!!!  Last week I had an argument with the staff at the neighboring restaurant Roberto's who will NEVER have my business again, and Dickeys earned my business! They assisted me last week, but I wasn't able to try the food till today.  John, the owner or manager, can't quite remember, Karla, and Mike are absolutely fantastic! I dealt with them both last week and today and they have amazing customer service skills.  Now the food, it was delicious! The beef brisket and pulled pork were so tender, they melted off my fork! I had mac and cheese and the jalape√±o beans as my side with a roll, and they were fantastic. The roll may have been under baked, but still good!  I highly recommend the food and environment and will be returning!"}
{"text":"I thought I had a favorite barbeque spot until I tried Dickeys. Wow!! That was note worthy good. I had the brisket sandwich which was delicious. The meat was super moist. I didn't have to ask for moist like at my other spot. I love coleslaw but not everyone has good slaw. Dickeys was exceptional. Heck yes, I recommend this place and will be coming back. Yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I don't typically take the time to submit complaints but this was upsetting. I've never been here before but my husband told me the food was amazing and said i would regret it if i didn't stop in - with that kind of recommendation how could i pass it up? I walked in and was greeted within moments by a woman cleaning the soda area which was very nice, i then stood next to the \"order here\" sign for about 5 full minutes waiting for the woman that was cutting meat to acknowledge me, when she didn't i thought well, she's wearing a black shirt and the other two girls are in plaid so maybe it's not her job and that's why she's blatantly ignoring me maybe i should wait for the girl who said hi to me...but she never came over and the other girl in plaid never came over. Finally i asked \"is this where i order or should i go to the register?\" The girl in the black shirt said \"order here\" so i told her I'd like the special, she said \"okay\", so then after noticing you have multiple options for sides i had to ask her \"do i pick my sides or does that come with something specific since it's the special?\" She said \"pick your own\" so i let her know what i wanted; then she  walked away without a word. I moved over to the register where the girl from the soda area smiled at me and asked how my day was- the first time i was smiled at since walking in and the first time i was asked how i was doing. She rang me up and i walked over to get my drink, shortly after a different girl came over and handed me my food saying \"here's your food lady\". Overall, i haven't had such a terrible customer service experience in my life. I text my husband and said the food better be good cause the service is terrible and he responded \"oh yea, awful; the worst...but the food is good.\" Is that truly the taste you want left in your customers mouth? I hardly even want to eat the food now."}
{"text":"Ordered two meat platter. Chicken fresh sliced and juicy. Brisket was flavorful but served in a 'pulled' manner I've never seen before, had to dig out some fat chunks but it's brisket, that's expected. Sauces are all delicious. Service was quick and friendly. Loved the green beans."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because of the fried okra and the baked potato casserole. The meat was a no go from the minute I saw the guy scraping the bark and the fat off my request for wet (or moist) brisket. The pulled pork was a weird mix of dry and mushy meat. The ribs were super salty and not very good.  But before all that was the service that was SO SLOW!! I think I got two new gray hairs just waiting for him to pull out the meat we wanted. Needless to say we won't be going back. If I want good bbq, I apparently need a plane ticket home to the South."}
{"text":"I dunno, maybe I was off-put when they fished two vac-pack racks of ribs out of a hot water bath and then served them up, but that began the downward spiral for me. We had an Entertainment coupon that gave us a rack free for up to $22, so I kinda thought inasmuch as it was a modified cafeteria style service in which one ordered then paid then hauled one's food to a table, that we'd skate out for maybe $25 or $30 bucks. Somewhat nonplussed by the fact that the $25 bucks for a slab included no sides, and left me hauling off the food, I forgot to order drinks and we each got only one side and yet it was almost $40, and I was hauling my own food around and fetching my own plastic silverware and thirsty to boot. Call me old-fashioned but if I'm getting second-class service,even if I am the one providing same, I kinda expect second-class prices knowhatimean? The green beans were great, the wife enjoyed her mini-Caesar salad, the ribs were ok, but lacked the smoke-flavor I was seeking, (perhaps they spent too much time in the water-bath), however I am not a good waiter so the service kinda bit.  Don't get me wrong the guys at the counter were fine, it was my own performance that bit.  I fully admit that it's been eons since I've purchased ribs in a restaurant, but the last time I did, methinks it was for under $25 bucks and that a waiter brought them to me.  Granted meat prices seem to have risen by 25% in the last six months, but still..... We were there on a Sunday noonish and the parking lot was as abandoned as could be, ours was the only occupied table in the place, so it's possible that others have quietly hopped on my bandwagon before I even launched the damn thing! It would require a bit of persuasion to get me back."}
{"text":"I love Dickey's BBQ! Have eaten here several times and even had it catered for a work lunch recently. I ordered online (pulled pork w/ mac & cheese and potato casserole) and it was to be ready for pickup at 7:30pm. I kept watching the order tracker and it never moved from \"in the cue,\" though it should actually be \"queue\"... I figured maybe they were busy so I waited awhile longer. The tracker never moved so I figured they probably weren't statusing it and headed to the restaurant. They were definitely not busy and my order was ready, they just had to bag it up. My food was very yummy. The employees either need to status the tracker or have it removed from the confirmation page/email if it's not going to be used."}
{"text":"I've been to other Dickey's locations but this one was a first. I got the pulled pork with mac & cheese and waffle fries. The pork was a generous helping and I thought it tasted what I would describe as a little \"piggy\" in spots (BBQ sauce helps--sweet & original). The mac and fries were good. Love the complimentary ice cream cones! Iced tea is pretty good too."}
{"text":"This was my first time I have ever been so my thinking going in was \"I hope this place has some real authentic smoked BBQ.\" I can be skeptical of BBQ joints especially when they are in places that just are not known for having BBQ.   I had the 3 meat plate. I had Ribs, Brisket and Pulled Pork with green beans and bacon and mac and cheese. My plate also came with a roll, pickle slices and onion slices. The mac and cheese was good but not the best I have had. It tasted like it needed more love. It kind of tasted bland. Did not taste like those who put 3 or 4 different cheeses into their recipe. The green beans were good but I think they had like 2 pieces of bacon in the entire bowl. Green beans with bacon should have a little more bacon in it. The rolls do not look like they are fresh baked. Looks like they are just some store bought rolls. Would have been better if the roll was warmed up a little.   Onto the meats. The meats had some excellent flavor and were very tender. The brisket pulled right apart like it should and was not a bit rubbery. Didn't have much of a smoke ring for smoking over night for 13-14 hours but was very good.   The ribs were awesome. Meat pulled right off the bone. Had an excellent Texas BBQ flavor to it. They were nice and sweet tasting. You could definitely tell the smoke penetrated the meat on the ribs. They had a great smoke ring and color to them. I think they go best with the sweet BBQ sauce over the regular BBQ sauce.  Like the ribs, the pulled pork had a better smoke coloring to it than the brisket. Pulled pork was done just right. It also goes better with the sweet BBQ over regular BBQ sauce.  My chart placement of the meats would go like this: Ribs, Pulled Pork, Brisket  The customer service was good. Didn't seem to lively though for being such a new place. The guy that served up my dish answered my questions with no hesitation. I did not catch his name. The guy that rang me up was John and the guy that was working with him serving up the dishes was an Asian guy.(Sorry that's all I can describe lol)    This place has only been open for 5 months and has the potential to be a really really good place. They just need to work on their sides a little bit. At least the Mac and Cheese and the Green Beans with Bacon. I also think the portion size could have been a tad bit bigger for the price. I was partially full when I was done but the food settled quickly. When it comes to BBQ, I want to practically be in a food coma with left overs for the next day. That's just how I am when it comes to BBQ."}
{"text":"First time here with the family, Jon was amazing and told us all the good stuff to get and deals! KIDS EAT FREE ON SUNDAYS!! We will be back asap!"}
{"text":"#onpoint, this place is amazing. Everything I had was very good. Pulled pork sandwich with the spicy bbq sauce , waffle fries, baked beans and the rolls. Definitely going back very soon."}
{"text":"I recently received a coupon for Dickey's in the mail and I was all, \"What is Dickey's BBQ Pit\"?  I was surprised to see that this place opened in Parma.  We don't get a lot of new restaurants around here often.  So this evening, I told the wife we're trying Dickey's.  She called in our order and it was ready in about 20 minutes.  We ordered a rib dinner, a brisket dinner, chicken tenders, onion rings, waffle fries, cole slaw, and mashed potatoes.  All the food was very good.  It doesn't really compete with Famous Dave's, but for a fast food joint, this was good.  The slaw was good and would go great on hot dogs with a little chili.  I asked how long they smoke the meat and I was told four hours.  They have three different sauces to choose from: original, sweet, and spicy.  I tried all three and I prefer the spicy.  The sauces were all good though.  They offer catering and have a tiered menu to choose from based on the number of people you're feeding.  My brisket was tasty, I have to admit.  But I didn't like the fact that it was shredded up.  Shredded up means more air in the dish.  More aid in the dish means less brisket.  It came with a biscuit, which was warm and tasty.  I t tasted my wife's ribs and they were really good.  I will definitely order them next time.  The quiet stars of the show were the onion rings and the waffle fries.  The seasonings on these two sides were very tasty."}
{"text":"Texas BBQ.  Pretty darn good if you ask me.  Chris T hit the nail on the head as far as I am concerned.  I've eaten here three or four times and left satisfied every time.  Even the BBQ chicken salad is pretty good - if you are crazy enough to order a salad at a BBQ joint!  Iced tea is very good.  Pretty fast-foodie decor , which tempts me to give it a four, but I'm a sucker for decent portions."}
{"text":"The food and service were great. Good bbq for sure. My only complaint would be the pricing. Close to $30 for two of us to eat. Will be back though :)"}
{"text":"Was hanging out with family in Phoenix. We decided to come here. It was clean and staff was friendly. Portions are small and they didn't have a vegetarian option.  The famous BBQ place in San Diego offers a veggie BBQ burger. I ended up eating just the sides. The sauces were delicious and hey offered a few options. They also give you free ice cream as well. Everyone else enjoyed their food, but portions were very small."}
{"text":"First time going to Dickey's, the best brisket, yummy bbq beans. Will be going back again."}
{"text":"I've ordered take out from here twice in one week. The ribs and the brisket. Both were exceptional. Good flavor, cooked well, very tender."}
{"text":"Basically what I expected from a chain BBQ restaurant. The chopped brisket was okay as well as the pulled pork which was decent. Unfortunately the ribs we're subpar for me, two fatty and not a good flavor. The barbecue beans were basically just bush beans out of the can , no meat or additional seasoning done to them. My biggest problem was probably with the portions size for the money that was charged I feel it was a little overpriced. It says hickory smoked meat but I really did not get much of a hickory taste out of anything. I guess if you're craving barbecue and there's no other options it will get you by. I only gave three stars because I took into consideration that this is a chain food establishment and if you're expecting Premier Meats you should probably go down the street Allison's Texas BBQ or maybe Tom's Chicago BBQ."}
{"text":"I eat lunch here frequently.  Their manager's lunch special is a great bargain... sandwich, side, coke, and a ice cream cone for under $10, all in.  Granted this isn't exactly Arthur Bryant's or Smoque, and it doesn't pretend to be.  For a quick lunchtime BBQ fix at a fair price this place is dependable and tasty."}
{"text":"Yum! This place completely took care of my BBQ craving. The whole family loves this place and the FREE ice cream doesn't hurt either. For our family of 6 (1, 3, 8, 10 and Mom and Dad) we usually get the family meal (two meats, three sides and rolls). There is so much food that we always come home with leftovers.  Our favorite is the pulled pork, brisket, mac and cheese, and green beans with bacon."}
{"text":"Love this place everything is fresh customer service is great. Free self serve ice cream to thank customers restaurant is super nice do yourself a favor and come and check it out!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Stopped here as we were driving through Madison.   Tried the Fall-off-the-bone ribs and smoked pulled pork. The original sauce was perfect! For sides we had the potato casserole, beans, and creamed spinach -- also all good. The roll could use some improvement - over cooked and dried out.  Then ended our meal with the ice cream cone.   Clean place with a nice outside patio and friendly service. Worth stopping by for a try."}
{"text":"Yum! A BBQ place right down the street. Bad news first....Dickey's is tiny. I thought it might be take-out only when we first walked in the back. The only other nip is the ordering is a little weird especially if you're not six foot tall. That being said....the 'q was very good. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot. Great daily special pulled pork Sammy with two sides a drink and ice cream 8.99"}
{"text":"This used to my go to spot, but tonight after the treatment and disgust in the food I got delivered that had a hair in it.. they refused to refund or replace my order. They said there was nothing they could do. I hope you change how you treat loyal customers because I for one will not be coming back or referring anyone else."}
{"text":"I have always felt that chain restaurants should be reviewed in category all there own because they will never be able to compete with a restaurant that produces a fresh product. With that said, I would rate Dickey's as one of the best chain BBQ restaurants that I Have experienced. The art of a chain restaurant obviously starts in the kitchen with the ability to mass produce a product in one location or  standardize a recipe and distribute in another location with minimal effort for the staff, requiring a lower pay scale to support the almighty bottom line. From what I could see they use a vacuum sealed bag product that merely needs to be reheated.  However the art is in fulfilling the taste buds and creating the illusion of freshly made product. This was accomplished!  The second part of a successful chain that is control-able is  the staff interaction and presence with the customer. For this I give Dickey's in Scottsdale a ten+. I was there on the 4th of July; working holidays is always the worst part of the restaurant industry. The staff showed no signs of animosity towards being there on a holiday. To the contrary the staff added to my holiday experience!  I also enjoyed the unlimited self sever BBQ sauce bar with whole dill pickles and soft serve ice cream! Well done Dickey's and staff!"}
{"text":"Nice people, very friendly service and good BBQ. If your looking for a change from your boring lunch spot it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Went with family to try new location and underwhelmed. Brisket was good, portions were inconsistent and the soda machine was out of coke."}
{"text":"I'll always give this place 5 stars because the BBQ here is just awesome. Good cuts of meat and over a dozen side dishes to choose from. Lots of drink choices too and FREE soft-serve ice cream! I got the pulled pork and beef brisket combo plate which was damn good."}
{"text":"First time trying  this place. Staff was  welcoming.  Ordered their Tuesday  nite special 4 ribs,two sides and  drink  9,95.. ribs well cooked meal fell of bone very tasty. My sides  baked beans & baked potato casrole..both c sides good beans tangy. Baked potato was ok . Staff was constantly cleaning..Would definetly return ."}
{"text":"Very good meal and service. I am a fan of BBQ chicken. Some BBQ restaurants serve dried out and tough. Dickey,s does a great job serving up a very tender chicken dinner."}
{"text":"This is awesome BBQ! Clean restaurant, friendly staff and great food! You can even get a free ice cream cone for dessert while dining in. While everything is delicious I love their fried okra Yum!!"}
{"text":"4 of my co-workers and I decided to go in on their 6pack combo deal. Ordered the Brisket, Ribs, 6 Rolls, 2 Mac n Cheese and a mashed potato casserole. Preordered it for pick up. It was hot, fresh and ready just as we showed up to pick it up. The food was absolutely delicious! So happy I got to finally try this place out as I was eyeing it for a while now. $40 bucks and it fed 5 people plus a little left over. Will definitely come back and recommend!"}
{"text":"The husband wanted to try this place. Friday evening nearing 6. We had no waiting but there was a line after us and continued for the 45 minutes we were there. Our order was correct and it appeared everyone else has theirs correct. This is a clean low cost very good BBQ place. The okra is second to none and I don't mind waiting for something that good!  Had it before I took my first bite of food. The husband is already thinking about our next stop there!  The free ice cream is also good!  Great place with good food for a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"I've eaten Dickey's once before, and was extremely unimpressed in the selection and quality they provided. The only real pit barbecue meat I saw were the ribs. Everything else is just a bunch of pulled or sliced meat that they throw together with other items like a BBQ version of Subway. The food isn't even fresh. It's all just sitting there waiting to be doled out.   On this visit, to this location, I had been looking forward to having some ribs all day. I had been working all day, and just wanted some I didn't have to prepare myself. There aren't many BBQ places near me, but I knew I could at least get a basic rack of ribs from unimpressive Dickey's. Apparently not though, because when I got there they said they had no ribs. Wow. A BBQ place, where the only item on the menu they might actually barbecue are ribs, and they don't even have the shitty ribs. What is the point of you guys even being open? Stop calling yourself a BBQ pit, because you're not one."}
{"text":"I walked in with a Texan and he nearly flipped his shit. Doesn't that say it all?  No? OK, moving on: a meal will run you about $7. The meats are smoked and tasty and come in a multitude of combinations (the pulled pork was my favorite) and instead of soaking the meat in sauce all day waiting for you, they pull it out of the smoke and cut it up and hand it over to you where you are able to dress it with one of 3 sauces. Also, there's a jar of pickles the size of your wrist on the counter, how good is that?  My Texan was moaning and saying that it tasted just like it did back home, seriously, how can you argue with that?  So pardon me if I don't tear this place to shreds for being imperfect; None of us are, after all. All I know is it was a really friggin' good lunch for a decent price and it put a smile on my friends face.  Oh, and it's located right next to a Dunkin' Donuts! Im from MA and *THAT* put a smile on MY face ;)"}
{"text":"This place is the best!! The manager John is great but I think he hires people who he thinks he can change. Kinda the stoner-ish kids who dont listen. Sorry to say John but you want to hire the hardworking 16 year morman kid who will say yes sir, no sir, etc.. and work his butt off.. Last time I was there 2 of the workers were definitely stoned, one gave me attitude when I asked him to change his gloves because he wiped his nose, drank his cup, and touched other things( he was the guy who cut up the meat) The other one acted like he could barely hear me and every question I asked, he didnt have a legit answer to. Just played dumb. Only one person working on the line that day was a good worker, and that was the kid with dreads! He's awesome. It was getting very busy too and Ive worked in a food industry line and when times get busy, you need people to be on their game, but two of them werent.   Idk who those workers are but they need to be let go. one was taller with a piercing on his eyebrow and one was shorter had a funny curly mustache.  John, you looked like you were doing all of the work for those guys.  Anyways, great food !!"}
{"text":"better than famous dave's & costs more but totally worth it. free ice cream when dining in"}
{"text":"So happy to have a good (actually great) BBQ place in the area. We just happened upon it and were back two weeks in a row.  Everything we have had is good but the ribs are amazing, some of the best I've ever had. Do yourself a favor and get them! Pulled pork sandwich is really good, too...lots of meat, all chopped up in front of you. We saw folks getting little samples of things too.  Lemonade is great and sweet. They have one of those make your own Coke selection computer screens. If you get the big yellow cup and bring it back, refills are .99. Did I mention there's FREE ICE CREAM soft serve at the end? Very clean inside and all nice folks. Just get the ribs already, you'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Ok..I'm really disappointed in this place. The pulled pork was dry and bland. The beef brisket really didn't have any flavor as well. I'm from the South and this is more like a corporate attempt to bring BBQ to Surprise. Little known secret...GOT QUE. Better quality for half the price. Oh...tons more meat too! FYI, I should have been warned off when the customers inside were complaining about the food. Visited 12-27-16 6pm. Will not be back. The only reason for 2 stars...the decor!"}
{"text":"I went here just before 6 today, and am currently sitting here. Unfortunately the meat was super hard. I could not eat my sandwich at all(brisket). in addition I would expect better service as I was handed the food with a dirty face and when I went to wash my hand in the restroom there was no soap. Terrible experience. Lost a routine customer:("}
{"text":"Dickeys is the world's okayest bbq. Nothing great, nothing bad.. its just average bbq at average prices. The worst part about the experience is the mumbly man behind the counter. If you dont know how to order you'll first have to scream across a counter at Mr. Mumbles, who will respond in unintelligible whispers. You wont know what he's asking, but you'll respond with what meat and sides youd like. The mumbly man will give no facial expression, but will mumble something back at you and begin to make your order. You'll have to move to the side and hope for a few minutes that he got all that, because he'll do some more mumbling and you'll do some more yelling all without any meaningful feedback. Its awkward, but kind of fun. At the end you'll pay and get to eat some average bbq."}
{"text":"Been here before and was decent when you have a hankering for bbq.  Not memorable bbq, but I don't remember it being terrible by any means. But tonight....The husband ordered some takeout and we got some grilled chicken breast with some bbq sauces on the side and some waffle fries. The chicken was tender but so saturated or marinated in salt salt saltyyyyy we couldn't even eat more than one bite...And that was without any bbq sauce on it. The fries also were so overly coated in salt seasoning that I had to brush/shake off salt even to eat a couple. Total meal ended up in the trash. We are not goats! If I wanted a salt lick I'll get one at Petsmart okay!? Chill out on the salt ppl! Never going back here ever again. Disgusting"}
{"text":"Get the daily specials and you're all set! The food was good BBQ but not the best or anything super special. The staff was slow to take our orders but I think they were a bit overwhelmed. All and all I would definitely come back again and eat!"}
{"text":"I thought my family would try Dicky's again. It wasn't great the first time. We gave it a second chance. Will we never go back. The pull pork was dry and no flavor. The ribs were all fat. So I told the manager about the ribs and said Ya so! Manager does not care about quality of food. The side of beans were good. The rest was nasty including the manager!"}
{"text":"I love going to dickeys barbecue the staff here are amazing always welcoming always smiling that's why I go here once a week for barbecue they even give you a free ice cream cone at the end just to make sure if you didn't get that good feeling on the way again you got it on the way out. Are usually go here and get the two meat platter are usually do double brisket but I also like the jalape√±o cheddar Kabasa If you have a chance to stop in I would highly recommend it"}
{"text":"The most amazing mac and cheese in town! The power was out last week and they couldn't run a card - they were so accommodating and kind so I was more than happy to leave a little extra.   I will be back!!"}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. I love the variety of meats and sides on their menu. It made it tough to decide but I got the turkey and spicy cheddar sausage with Mac & cheese and waffle fries. The turkey was amazing and I loved their spicy sauce to go with. They also have free ice cream which was a perfect end to the meal."}
{"text":"I brought my fiancee here for lunch hour which was more like a dinner. It was $30 for lunch for 2, but there was a ton of food. We both got a two meat plate with two sides (macaroni and cheese, green beans, coleslaw and baked beans) and cornbread. It was very good, we really enjoyed it and we will be back another time."}
{"text":"Appearance was very clean. The staff was friendly and polite. A man, I am assuming was a manager did come over and checked on us and offered a coupon for a family meal on our next visit. That was nice to see.  Unfortunately, the food was bleh to us. My husband got the Fancy pork sandwich which not very big and it was $6.50 with no sides or a drink. My husband said the pork tasted dry. I got the Holy Kielbasa Jalape√±o Cheddar. Which tasted just like a Hillshire Farm Jalapeno Cheddar sausage on a slider bun for $6.50, again with no side or drink. My daughter for the kids meal chicken slider with a side of mac and cheese. She seemed to like it. I just think it is a little overpriced for what it was. If you want pulled pork I would just go down the street to Got Que. i am not impressed with my first visit at Dickey's but I am not opposed to giving it another try."}
{"text":"Basic run of the mill chain bbq joint... but guess what ?? Dickies has some good vittles. Definitely worth a shot with their chopped brisket ."}
{"text":"Great food, great people! Before even getting to the menu I want to note the customer serivce. Everyone is always so nice and friendly and willing to help. If you have any questions about the menu they will gladly talk you through it and make sure what you are served is fresh. In fact, the last time I was there I heard a couple mention they can't eat pork for religious reasons. The man working immediately changed knives, cutting boards, and gloves to ensure what they ordered would have no contact with the pork.   Now for the food: there are 3 sandwich styles and then plate choices (like ribs). The meats are smoked over night (I believe), and carved in front of you. I HIGHLY recommend the turkey - it's amazing. From there you can choose two sides from choices including baked potato casserole, mac and cheese, fresh waffle fries and onion rings, salad, and a bag of chips. They have 3 different bbq sauces which are all kept heated which makes all the difference. They also have a kids menu and offer catering. Each day has a different menu special, ON SUNDAYS KIDS EAT FREE.  Drinks come in a giant plastic cup you can reuse at home (we use them for dinner all the time), PLUS there's free vanilla ice cream. If you're feeling daring, do yourseld a favor and skip the cone and make a giant float in your cup.  Its seriously a great spot to eat. Sure it's a little more expensive than other fast dining, but the food is A+ and the experience and atmosphere is worth it!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is totally freaking amazing we loved it !!! The barbecue was so delicious crazy out of this world and the place actually had free ice cream when you leave we absolutely love this place and we will plan on coming back several times!!!!"}
{"text":"Brisket big barbecue is the way to go. The pit crew was very accommodating and hooked me up with the burnt ends (the best part) on request. Sandwich was affordable, super filling and some of the best BBQ I've had. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I apparently went to alternate-world Dickie's because I liked their BBQ just fine. We chose Dickie's because last year I had tasted their BBQ at the Scottsdale culinary festival... their stand had a super long line and it one of the more popular stands I saw. We ordered Dickie's take out for our Super Bowl party and got a variety of dishes and sides including pulled pork BBQ, sausage, brisket, rolls, cole slaw, beans, and more.   I made myself mini sandwiches with the rolls (nice, soft bread), pulled pork, a mix of regular and spicy BBQ sauce, and some cole slaw. I didn't try the sausage or brisket, so can't comment on that. Everyone at the party said they really enjoyed the food.    I would agree that the actual restaurant left a lot to be desired. I think I'll stick to take-out. Maybe I just like anything doused in BBQ sauce?  Maybe we got lucky?   Not as good as Dave's Famous BBQ or Texas Roadhouse, but still very decent."}
{"text":"We like this place.  Vegas has the original menu compared to other places that are a la cart.  The chopped brisket is good."}
{"text":"Gross.   Went to the Shea and Scottsdale store today. 7pm.  Filthy. Tables not cleaned.  Two staff members doing nothing.  I can only imagine what the kitchen looks like . If that was my restaurant I sure would be there to manage things. Never going back.  First and last time."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something new with my husband during his lunch break. I love brisket and thought I would check this place out.  It is delicious! Got Mac n cheese with my meal and it even tasted great. Not too many places have good Mac n cheese. My husband thought it was okay. I will be back in the future. It is a little to far from my job which is a bummer."}
{"text":"Their ribs were really good with a good amount of heat and flavor. The Mac and cheese and baked beans were really tasty as well. They had my order ready right when I got there and the staff were friendly."}
{"text":"Always a winner for brisket. Get the pulled pork special on Thursday. I start & end my meal with their complimentary soft serve cone. The mini size is adorable. Staff is attentive & friendly."}
{"text":"Best BBQ place in Vegas I've found so far! Decent portions and prices!  Love the baked beans and green beans! This is our BBQ go to place!"}
{"text":"This was my second visit.  Prep line guys work at a pretty snappy pace but there was a break down in communication between them and the cashier.  My son and I got the brisket plate.  The meal itself is fine but for the second time the condiments were less than stellar.  The bar itself was messy, was low stocked and the onions seemed old.  The cashier seemed new or untrained.  I've got enough patience for another visit but if the cleanliness and service don't catch up with the food that will be it."}
{"text":"Sad and pathetic, I ordered the beef brisket and cheese sandwich to be picked up. When I got home and opened up the sandwich all that was in there were two small dried pieces of meat and one small piece of cheese. This is supposed to be a $6 sandwich, I would not pay $2 for it."}
{"text":"I remember when this place opened a few years ago. I would look forward to the day of the week I would come here for lunch. It was a very expensive lunch. ($16) but  I told myself I was getting the best ribs I've ever had for that money. It was well worth it! Big succulent fresh ribs. Mmmm....   Fast forward to today. The order taker was beyond weird and I felt like I was bothering him by being here.  The ribs, if you can call them now still, are now tiny and very dry. I've tried a few more times since then, hoping the awesome food would come back and it was just a fluke, but nope... it continues to suck. I haven't been back since :("}
{"text":"Awful service.. online order.  I requested a 3 meat plate... got 2.  Only one rib in the other one??? They said it was due to weight.  So we just share a rib? Also..shareable salad is a small cup of salad.   Never again..."}
{"text":"Thank you for making delicious turkeys! My in-laws were satisfied.  Thanks for making me look put together hahah"}
{"text":"The service was friendly, knowledgeable, and courteous. The portions were generous and delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Bbq is very good, not great but very good.  Excellent service and friendly employees as well, will return!"}
{"text":"This is some good bbque I had the ribs with cole slaw and jalepeno beans. The cole slaw excellent ribs mouth watering . I think they just need better combinations far as the meal if you get half slab you have to buy sides seperate. If you get meat combo you get half slab minus one bone plus two sides . Fast service and conveniently located."}
{"text":"I must tell you - for a fast food type BBQ joint, this place has it together. I have eatned my share of BBQ over the years from Texas to North Carolina and back to cold, cold Ohio. Is this the best BBQ I've ever had - no. But it is really, really good and it's fast.   They smoke all of their meats in house and then wrap them in plastic wrap to keep the moisture in - and it works. I had the two meet platter which included pulled pork and brisket. Both were super. The added the fries and corn bread as well. The corn bread might be the best corn bread I have ever tasted.   The three sauce options were good even though I prefer a thicker, St. Louis type sauce.   To top it all off - free ice cream cones. You heard that right - free ice cream.   Go there - eat Q - be happy!"}
{"text":"First time with uber eats and was super excited, but sadly when i got my order there was no barbeque sauce but i called and everything was fixed so fast i was so happy. Right when i called, sarah answered and quickly resolved my issue and replaced my order. When i called again just to make sure i ordered extra sauce, josh answered the phone and made sure to pack two containers of each sauce. Josh delivered it quick and hot. Was very pleased with how i was treated and my experience was great. Cant wait to eat again. Great price and great food."}
{"text":"Just had Dickey's for the for the first time tonight. The restaurant was very clean, and the service was outstanding. The ribs on the other hand were subpar.  I had Don & Charlie's last night and there was simply no comparison....."}
{"text":"I'm happy there is a Dickey's Barbecue Pit that is available in the area finally.  It took a long time for one to arrive.  There hadn't been very many locations for many years. I usually love the brisket at Dickeys. Sometimes I get a brisket plate and sometimes I get a brisket sandwich.  I also like the jalape√±o beans. However, they have been telling me lately they can't get those right now.  I hope they will be able to offer those soon because I don't care for the other beans as well. The mac & cheese is good. I also like the french cut green beens. I think they are tasty. Also, it is nice to be able to have a little ice cream after my meal."}
{"text":"Ribs tender and very tasty, servers helpful and friendly!  Clean surroundings and ice cream when your finished!  Serve yourself soda and lemonade with Dickey's famous sauces as much as you want.  Very pleased and doesn't seem like a chain but more like the neighborhood BBQ.  I would recommend to a friend."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!!! I had never heard of it, but found it on my trusty Yelp app.  It's set up like Chipotle or Panera, or any other fast casual place. There's a lot to love about this place: everything we tasted was delicious, free self-serve ice cream, the price is right, and the employees are super friendly.   I ordered the Saturday special: a big brisket sandwich, and two sides (I chose BBQ beans and potato casserole). My boyfriend got a platter of brisket and spicy cheddar sausage, corn bread (omg, so good), cole slaw, and waffle fries, plus a couple big fountain drinks (iced tea is best I've ever tasted!) - the total was about $25, which was very reasonable.   What is not reasonable is the amount of food $25 will buy. It is enough for a family - the fact that I ate an entire giant delicious sandwich, most of my beans and potatoes, and then started in on my bf's leftovers - that is gross behavior. I had to waddle out to my car, and when I went to Target right after, I contemplated picking up some Liz Lange maternity pants to change into.   I'm still stuffed, four hours later.   This place creates a problem for me in that it's so delicious and it's by my house, so I'm going to want it all the time...but I also need to fit into my summer clothes, so it might be awhile before I can make a return visit."}
{"text":"3 meat brisket meal witt fries lean as possible no onions XXX pickles..  By LV standards its pretty good not like KC BBQ"}
{"text":"Today my  Big Brisket (2) was good as usual.  Smoke was good on it... The fries & sauce was good..  BUT  I am assuming the owner is here a white guy named (JASON) come from the back office and their was someone at the counter he ask to help the customer but immediately turned to the female black worker who was cleaning the lobby and said \"DON' T EVER LEAVE THE LINE UNATTENDED\" in a very condescending tone In front of customers in the lobby and the one standing in front of him.  Thankfully the customer let (JASON) know she already spoke and said she was coming right over... (JASON) Continued to express his dislike for the situation in front of the customer waiting to order... So sad it reminded me slavery situation!    I GAVE IT A 1 STAR BECAUSE OF JASON!"}
{"text":"If you like a homestyle cooked BBQ meal this is the place to go. The pulled pork, beef brisket, and ribs are amazing. They have meals for one or you have the option to get a meal for the entire family and on the way out make an ice-cream cone to go for free. Beside great food, the service is outstanding. We went Saturday afternoon (feb 28th) and the young man and woman that were working the front were so kind and helpful. They made you feel like you were at home in your mothers kitchen."}
{"text":"The Yelp review I was going to write when I left the store lost a full star by the time I got home, for one simple reason:  Dickey's can not get an order right to save their effing lives.  Every time I've had takeout from there, something has always been missing. Sometimes it's something small, like the onion and pickle that are supposed to come with every platter but only show up about half the time. Sometimes it's something medium and annoying like a missing side. Sometimes it's something mission-critical, like the bacon on a baked potato. They did, however, make sure to include BBQ sauce! With my baked potato, so the bag had a smoked meat aroma that taunted me in the absence of the missing bacon. #fail  It's a shame too, because the food here is actually decent. At $4, those giant stuffed baked potatoes are a great deal. Their BBQ isn't the best I've ever had, but it's certainly good for a quick-service counter joint, and I'd sooner eat here than the flavorless Famous Dave's and the stupefyingly overrated Memphis Championship BBQ. And they get bonus points for serving smoked turkey year-round.  Other good meats include the pulled pork and the hot link. The best sides here are the waffle fries, cole slaw, potato salad and baked potato casserole. The sweet tea is as it should be, and they offer complimentary pickles and soft-serve ice cream, which is a nice value-added touch.  The BBQ sauce is perfectly acceptable but nothing special. They have sweet and hot variants for a little spice of life. I prefer the hot, although I don't think it even has the slightest bit of heat to it.  Bottom line on this place? Decent BBQ, especially for the price, but be sure to audit your order, because the only thing you can depend on with their service is its complete lack of dependability."}
{"text":"Have been several times. When the owner is there it runs efficiently and she is super friendly and runs a tight ship. The few times we have been there when she is not there was a different experience. The food is tasty. Some great sides. Love the ice cream cone machine. The lunch specials are a good deal. Limited seating but a friendly atmosphere. Worth a try."}
{"text":"Surprised we had not tried this place out yet.  It's been open awhile now, but for whatever reason, we just hadn't been in the mood for BBQ, I guess?    My mom was in town and we needed some takeout, so we finally decided to grab something from here.  I placed an order online for a family pack with chopped brisket.  We chose mac and cheese and baked beans as the sides (also comes with 4 rolls).  We also got 1/4lb of smoked chicken.  All of this was just about $31.00.  Drove down, picked it up and brought it home.  Here are my thoughts on the items we got...............  Chopped Brisket-  This was pretty tasty!  The family pack came with a pound of this, and a pound of chopped brisket is A LOT.  It was diced up nice and small, almost shredded.  Had a great smoke flavor, no fatty pieces etc.  This mixed with their sauce, was pretty freaking grub!   Smoked Chicken-  Nice and moist, pretty tasty.  Nice coating of pepper on the outside.  1/4lb is not much, but we were all able to have a few slices of it.  Mac and Cheese- Only had a bite, but it was incredibly cheesy and tasted great.  Reminded me of a Velveeta shells and cheese type macaroni.  If you like that style, you will like this.  Baked Beans- Only had a bite of these, too.  They were just ok.  They were a little runny (I prefer my baked beans thick and rich), but still didn't taste bad.  Doubt I would get them again, or I would ask them to drain them first.  BBQ Sauce-  We got the Original sauce and it was fantastic!  Just sweet enough, heavy tomato based type sauce.  Reminded me and tasted just like this place we had in Santee, CA called KB's BBQ.  Some of the best BBQ sauce I have ever had.  I was very impressed with this sauce!  The family pack also came with 4 rolls (didn't try any), some pickles and some raw white onion.  Everyone in my family enjoyed the BBQ and we will get it again soon.  There was enough to feed 3 adults and leftovers to make a few sandwiches with the remaining brisket the next day.    Guys in the shop were friendly, online ordering was easy, and that BBQ sauce was BOMB!  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Alway yummy! Gotta love the fancy pulled pork tacos  I could seriously eat them every day"}
{"text":"I have now been to both of the places named Dickeys in the greater Phoenix area.  One, Dickies Dogs out in North Scottsdale would occasionally get my retox business, when we lived out that way...they were close to DC Ranch and close to the DC Ranch Village, so it made getting a hot dog easy enough:)  Then people started throwing dynamite through the windows of Dickies Dogs in the middle of the night in a misguided attempt at extreme restaurant critiquing:)  I quit going to Dickies Dogs when the possibility of getting fragged reared its ugly head!  I'm thinking the guerilla critic might have been guilty of a case of mistaken identity (as well as multiple Class A federal felonies:(  While Dickies Dogs made serviceable hot dogs, you really can't say the same about the \"barbecue\" from Dickeys Pit.  I met a friend at Dickeys Pit yesterday for lunch and a business meeting...from the moment I walked in, I just sort of knew it was not going to go well for Dickeys Pit:(  I took a look at the somewhat limited menu, while I sniffed in vain for the slightest hint of wood smoke in the air.  Then I read their menu more closely.  When they talk about how they make their \"barbecue\" at Dickeys, they talk about how they \"cook\" their meats \"on the pit\" overnight...wait a minute...that's not barbecue!  I walked around to the side of the counter and saw the stainless steel \"pit\", over which they \"cook\" the meat...oh crap?!?!?  At any rate, I was there and I was starving (power yoga and no breakfast make for an empty boy:) so I went ahead and ordered the pulled pork sandwich with \"barbecue\" beans.  They brought out my sandwich, which had been \"cooked on the pit\"...sliced pork shoulder (not pulled pork) without so much as a hint of smoke, served with watery beans that had more in common with bean soup than with real barbecue beans...except without the flavor of good bean soup:(  They have serve yourself barbecue sauce and I got regular and spicy sauce (the sweet sauce was almost like candy:(...and I slathered the spicy on my sandwich in an unsuccessful effort to get some flavor into the meat.  It was just a sliced pork sandwich with second rate barbecue sauce poured over the top...it wasn't barbecue, pit or otherwise and it wasn't good:(  The place is clean, modern, family friendly, pretty cheap and completely without redeeming value when it comes to the food they serve.  I think the mysterious Mad Dickies Bomber might just have had the wrong Dickeys!"}
{"text":"First time I went there I thought the BBQ was amazing.  Although I ordered the side salad,  and the lettuce was all soggy.  Like it had been sitting in dressing all day with soggy croutons :(  Second time I went there I got plastic wrap in my sandwich.   Then I started to eat my side this time which was creamed spinach and that was barley warm.  The gentleman in back did come out and apologize for the plastic being in the food.  He gave us a coupon for a free sandwich if we buy a drink.  Not sure if that's enuf to get me to go back."}
{"text":"I thought it was pretty good!  I had the brisket with 2 sides (spinach and baked potato casserole).  I ordered over the internet, and they had my order ready.  Very easy.  It looked clean, and the customer service was good.  I had the original BBQ sauce, and it was nice.  I wish I had tried the sweet for comparison.  I would go back for sure!"}
{"text":"What happened?! This place used to be amazing! Go in today and the menu has completely changed. Before there were sandwiches and potatoes and tacos, a whole variety of dishes. Now it's just meat and sides. Those changed too! Meat was undercooked and cold, sides weren't fresh. The portions also shrunk and the prices went up. They used to give half a pound of meat now it's 6.5oz for more money. They also changed to a chalk board for prices. So disappointed! Bring back the old Dickies!"}
{"text":"Saturday May 17, 7pm: Wife, son and myself waited in line 20 minutes just to begin our order (there were only four orders in front of us). First, you start your order with the guys cutting your meat, not the cashier (no paper record of what I order until I tell the cashier at the other end? Weird). As I watched them cut the brisket, I noticed he scraped the fat from the outside of the cut, and then started chopping it. \"Holy crap; are you going to put that in my order?\" No response. I like BBQ fat, but only as it is just trimming the meat, not the main dish. Short story: I ordered a two meat plate, with bun, pickles, onions, two sides (Okra and baked potato casserole), Wife ordered turkey Hoagie, son got mac and cheese and chicken nuggets. My meal is the picture attached: on the left is the pulled pork, the right is my gristly ass brisket. The masses of brown and green which look chewed up and spit out are my portion of fat and the flaccid pickle. No side dishes, had to go back and get them. Son got overcooked nuggets with VISIBLE SALT CRYSTALS ON THEM. Who in the hell salts chicken nuggets? And he is three, doesn't need a salt lick yet. Wife got lucky: she got two sandwiches. I felt bad for the people working there; they were overwhelmed by the small crowd, mostly because of their ass backwards ordering plan. Try this Dickey's Greenway: Cashier takes order, prints order, gives paper to guys in the back who slap it together, put it in a bag, hand it to the customer. TA DA. And don't sell me fat. I friggin hate that. Your guys even had the nerve to weigh out the portions."}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, service was quick.  Not very busy on Friday afternoon at about 4 pm Split a fancy pork sandwich with a friend. No sauce, meat overdone to the point, my friend said it could have passed for tuna sandwich.  No sauces or condiments on the table to make it edible. Just decided to buy my own smoker."}
{"text":"Soooo not impressed!! I got the three meat platter to try a little of everything. While tender the turkey tasted like the pressed roll stuff you get for sandwiches at the deli and the brisket was bland. None of it tasted smoked or bbq'd. I also got some hotlink on the platter which tasted old and reheated. The loaded mashed potatoes tasted like dry and reconstituted potatoes. Call me spoiled but I have had better BBQ out of a Banquet Frozen Meal."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge BBQ guy, but my family loves this place. I can admit that I have never had anything bad at this place. The meats are fresh, good portions, and taste great. There are plenty of sides to choose from. Their coleslaw is excellent. We tend to go on Sundays because the kids eat free. That is like getting $10 off. They love the chicken nuggets and can't wait to clean their plate for the free soft serve ice cream afterwards."}
{"text":"Went to Dickey's Barbecue Pit at the Scottsdale location (14884 N. Pima) for lunch today for the first time and the only problem is how I'm going to keep myself from going there every day for the rest of my life. The friendly and accommodating service could not have been better, and top that off with superb barbecue and now you got addiction... Thank you Dickey's and staff for having a great place to go."}
{"text":"So on my way back to Los Angeles, My friend and I were looking at a joint to Grubb, and after two well known places were packed, we ended up here.  What a great choice, I tried their 3 meat plate (sweet pork ribs/brisket/spicy sausage) with Mac & Cheese and baked potato casserole, their side dishes were wonderful, their house roll was sweet and rich.  Free Ice Cream (cone or cup)  Try this place out and you will not be disappointed"}
{"text":"Maybe it was the hangover or the lack of sleep but I thoroughly enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich here.  Dare I say....the best pulled pork sandwich I've ever had??  The big slice of raw onion really was money on the sandwich.     Mondays are an awesome deal.  For $5 you get a pulled pork sandwich, 1 side dish and a large drink. They claim they cook the pork for 12 hours overnight on premises and it sure did taste like it to me."}
{"text":"They've been sending out coupons in the mail for a couple of weeks now so I got a takeout order.  The deal was BOGO meat platter with the purchase of 2 large drinks.    The place was pretty dead on a Wednesday night as I only saw 2 customers dining at 7pm.  I got a rib plate and a 3 meat combo.  Both came with 2 sides each, a roll and pickles and onions.  My 3 meats were pulled pork, beef brisket and turkey.  All of them were good with the brisket being best.  There have been a lot of complaints about the brisket in several reviews being cold or dry.  The lady in front of me ordered a pound of brisket but let it be known she worked for a well known publication in town and spoke with the manager on duty as well.  I think they brought out the most recently cooked brisket because of this.  Maybe everyone should do this to ensure the best quality meat?  The ribs sucked big time.  I am not sure if it was the quality of the meat, the preparation or all of the above but they were very disappointing.  I won't be ordering these again.  They advertise them as \"fall off the bone\" and it was anything but that.  Stay on the bone ribs?    I also saw that Nadine K just posted a picture of her ribs from this location and mine did NOT look like that at all.  Her ribs look much better.  Maybe she works for Time magazine?  I would also avoid the green beans with bacon side since that was a watery mess with not so fresh beans.    I know I'll be back from time to time as long as they keep sending coupons but it's only because it's quick and near my home."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't know about Dickey's until a few weeks ago. I feel like I've been robbed of opportunity to enjoy delicious smoked meats and sides-- time I'll never get back.  The price is amazing. The food is extraordinary- not just for the price, but overall, better than most BBQ restaurants. They have a great menu with lots of options, but not in an overwhelming way. The people who work there are really friendly and seem to love what they do. They infected me and made me a fan for life.   Now, if we can just get them to open up more locations...."}
{"text":"My buddy Andre Ironwing told me about this place so we met there last night for dinner.  Not knowing it was closing within the hour, we were the last of the customers to roll through the place before shutting down.  Since I have never been here, it took a moment to go through the lengthy menu but I finally decided on the Rib Platter.  1 rib shy of a 1/2 rack and it comes with 2 sides and a dinner roll.  I opt'd for the Mac-n-Cheese and the Cheesy Creamed Spinach.    My cashier was concerned that my ribs were not up to par as they were the last of the batch for the day and he offered me something else as he did not want my first experience to be unmemorable.  I chose to stick it out as they did look great but the bottom line would have been the taste.  Let me tell you, they were great!!  I grabbed a cub of the Hot BBQ sauce to slather them in and did not not need it once. They were fall off the bone delicious!  When I finally did sop up some of that wonderful sauce, I was blow away by its flavor.  Hot but not overwhelming, sweet but not too much.  It was perfect!  The side dished as well were just right.  Mac-n-cheese was wet and saucy, not dried out.  The spinach was a bit over processed and almost like it had been pureed.  I felt it could have used a few more larger pieces of the greens as opposed to a baby food consistency but delicious, nonetheless.   When we were finished, I could feel the heat from the BBQ sauce catching up with my taste buds and needed something sweet to finish off the meal.  Well, they have the answer, FREE Soft Serve!!  Awesome!    Before leaving, I went back over to tell the cashier of my experience and also to know where he was in the organization as he acted like an owner with his concern for my meal.  Turns out, his name is Devon and he is only the assistant Manager.  I would have sworn he owned the place the way I was taken care of last night!    Bottom line: This place is great.  Cost is reasonable, food is terrific and the customer service is over the top!  I highly recommend it!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Terrible. I was really disappointed with this place. I didn't go in with high expectations since its a franchise in a strip mall, but it was worse than expected. They were out of baked potatoes (which were the daily special), limited side dishes which were already pre-packaged, and the meat was just \"meh\", nothing to write home about. I did like the sauces bust did not like the hard, dry rolls and didn't understand why the meat plate included a raw onion!?! I was excited to have another food option near by but I don't plan on returning. If you want chain bbq nearby,  go to famous daves. If you want great local bbq nearby, go to Joe's! If you want overpriced mediocre bbq, eat HERE!"}
{"text":"I have given this place 3 chances . Yes three totally separate chances to be fair. My review did not change. The food is expensive but expected for barbque.  But if I'm going to pay a lot for it the portions should be more.  The portion sizes are laughable especially the ribs nowhere enough for the money paid. The seasoning of the meat was off a couple of times. The caliber of the employee is scary. I wasn't sure if they were clean or not. They were young like high school young maybe but the were joking and playing when I walked in and did not notice I was standing there.  That made me very uncomfortable when people are preparing my food.  This just didn't taste like authentic barbque. And their so called famous sweet tea is not sweet it's disgusting.     I do not recommend this place and will not go back. Gave it 1 star because it was close to home."}
{"text":"Great service and extra friendly and helpful  Jacob's pit crew did great job. Good temp. To eat inside without freezing! Both the pork and brisket were excellent."}
{"text":"Great food but questionable service. The new location is √ºber small! I don't like seeing their office door open and seeing staff's friends hanging out and even off the clock staff hanging out. The kitchen is super small. I even saw a bunch of ribs just sitting on the counter, not even under a heat lamp. I had a coupon and two staff couldn't even figure out how to use it correctly! It's not that hard!  The only thing they have going for them is the delicious food but that's it."}
{"text":"I eat here a couple times a month.  The food is good for the price, but only mid tier as far as BBQ goes.  I typically stick to their brisket and pulled pork sandwiches with mac & cheese on the side.  The food has always been fine.  My only real complaint is this place is super stingy with the rolls.  I once ordered a pound of meat and asked for extra rolls.  They gave me one that I believe is included and would not give me any additional.  I would have been willing to pay extra for them but they were not on the menu and the option was not given.  I know this is an odd thing to complain about but it really bothered me for some reason."}
{"text":"Awesome experience!! Kind of stumbled upon this. Everyone super friendly. Love the decor and great lighting perfect music. Kind of a fast food BBQ but with elegance. Definitely be back."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try for a late 8:30 dinner take out after work since it was on the way home. Glad I did! I was greeted and advised to try meat and side samples. I only tried 2 and would like to come back and try more. The 2 I tried were what I purchased as sliders. The sliders are your average size slider (picture has chapstick for scale) and I didn't want to commit to one whole sandwich, especially since I wasn't that hungry. I had the beef brisket and polish kielbasa and small Cole slaw. I was given bbq sauce (I guess it's just one flavor, no spice levels) and I used one small container for both sliders. I wanted to make sure I could still taste the meat and bread, and the balance of flavors, to fairly judge it. I really enjoyed it! The kielbasa had a good kick to it. I noticed I was charged for a jalape√±o cheddar slider but I didn't taste the cheddar)... I read a review and noticed they had military discount. I forgot to ask but I was also in uniform. Oh well, next time. I must come back and try their other stuff. I also came at a time with only 2 other costumers so I didn't have much wait time. I highly suggest for others to try! Now it isn't inexpensive, but it sure isn't a rip off. Especially since you get to taste what you're ordering before hand."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I got 3 meat plate $15.98 supposed to be Texas sized. I got two tiny ribs with no meat on them. I'm not quite sure how to descibe them: day old, kept under heat lamp, just kind of had a funky taste. The jalape√±o cheese sausage link was ok, but it seemed just like ones you would get from grocery store. The beef brisket was above average. But the bbq sauce they give you to put on it has no flavor. It tastes just like tomato sauce. The best part of the meal was the roll and potato salad....I won't be going back.  I wish someone would build good authentic BBQ joint in sun city / surprise......"}
{"text":"K & I were looking for a place to have lunch while Grandma C was having a procedure done at the heart hospital a few miles north. Driving down Power Rd. and I see the sign for Rubio's Fish Taco's. We agree that sounds good but immediately notice Dickey's and change our minds. BBQ it is. 1 pm on a Wednesday and this place is dead. Ok, sure, there aren't a ton of business parks around but geeez, if this place gets a lunch crowd, where do they come from. So now, sitting in our car deciding if maybe Rubio's would be the better choice K gets a call from a relative checking up on Grandma C. I use the time to Yelp Dickey's. Hmm. Not that great. I notice that a lot of the reviews mention good food but lousy service. Well, we're not here to eat the service so, as soon as K wrapped up the call we headed in. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a young lady behind the counter, Taylor. We checked out the menu as well as the \"Deal of the day\" board. I had a question about the DOTD which Taylor answered politely.  K & I ordered the Wednesday DOTD. A pulled pork & Polish sausage sandwich, 2 sides which I chose Cole Slaw & BBQ Beans & a drink ($8.99).  K also added a side of Green Beans ($2.25), a side of Potato Salad ($2.25) and a drink ($2.25). The sandwich was really very good. It is served open faced. On the bottom half was a nice pile of Pulled pork with a Polish Sausage sliced on the diagonal sitting on top drizzled with their regular BBQ sauce. On the top half were pickles, onion slices & a half slice of mild cheddar cheese. Plenty of sandwich for us to split. The pork was tender & properly seasoned. The sausage had a nice kick to it and was very tasty. Winner winner pulled pork & sausage dinner. The Cole Slaw was good. Crispy, not watery, seasoned properly but could have used a tad more vinegar. Excellent effort. The BBQ Beans were ok. I stress O K. Nothing at all to set them apart from a good quality canned BBQ beans. Bummer. The Green Beans were a grade above ok. The breans were cooked properly & seasoned well. The bacon was actually chopped pork & the diced onion imparted a good flavor.  The Potato Salad. YUK! There is mustard (I love) in Dickey's potato salad. But I don't know how they get the potato salad to turn the color yellow it was and still not have an overwhelming taste of Mustard. Plus, it is more like Mashed Potato salad. There were very few discernible pieces of potato in this side. The flavor is NO different from the tubbed potato salads at the grocery store. Major disappointment. Portion size was fine for what you pay. Each side was $2.25 which is entirely fair. Our sides were all filled to the appropriate levels. The DOTD we got was great for us to split for lunch & would easily make a nice dinner for 1. I thought it was interesting that I didn't read any reviews that mentioned the drink cups. They are the same 32oz plastic cups you get through the local theater chains loyalty programs. For $2.25. Awesome. This alone is almost worth a half star. In addition to the cool cups, there is the free ice cream with cones or cups available by the drink station. And kids eat free on Sunday. Now here's the cool thing if you like Root beer floats. When you're done eating & going for dessert, empty your cup & fill it with root beer & the soft serve. Booyaa!  The dining room was clean & while we ate an employee was going through the room cleaning the tables & straightening up the tables that needed attention. The pulled pork polish sausage was a great sandwich, the cole slaw was good, green beans & BBQ beans were ok, potato salad was crap. Fair prices, portions appropriate, clean dining room, friendly staff, great drink cup, free ice cream. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"C and I were on our way home when we passed by Dickey's on Alma School and realized they were open. I've been passing by this location for weeks and I'm happy to have a Dickey's so close to home. The menu is the same as the location I've visited out on Power Rd. Smoked Brisket, Chicken, Pulled Pork, Pork Ribs, Sausage and Kielbasa available by the half pound. Sandwiches and sides. On this visit, C had the Beef Brisket and I had the Chicken. They were also offering a special of Pork Street Tacos so we had a couple of those as well. The Brisket ($8 / .5lb) was great. Super good smoke flavor and very tender. C devoured it quite quickly. I enjoyed the smoked chicken, $7 / .5lb). It was tender, good light smoke flavor with some nice added herbs. Winner winner chicken dinner. The pulled pork street tacos were not so great. The slaw made the tacos very wet and somewhat unappealing. Although the price was good, the final product was not. The other thing I noticed was that there was no ice cream / soft serve dispenser. Maybe that's only over at the Power Rd. location but it's a nice addition and hopefully this location will consider adding it to the condiment area. The restaurant was clean as it should be, it's brand new. The place was very crowded and that made placing the order take quite awhile. I think the guy working the counter spent as much time explaining the menu as he did chopping up the meats. The staff was super nice and as I said, I'm glad they're just down the street now. I think the prices are between fair and a bit high. Plus, the product they serve is delish.  Good BBQ. Fair Prices. Nice, Friendly staff. Clean. 4 Stars."}
{"text":"Not crazy about it! The Potato Salad had more cream than potato, overpriced and small amount of ribs, the food was not hot and the staff not very friendly! First and Last time!!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed w Dickeys. I've had BBQ all over the country (from NY, NC, KC, etc...) and this was possibly the worst BBQ I've ever had.... pulled pork and brisket were cold and could tell it's been sitting there for a while ... pork was fairly fatty... sides were veryyyyy small. Also for a 2 meat plate, there wasn't even a lot of meat.  Small portions all around... For $13 without a drink...I should have actually been full, needles to say... I'm not.   There is another place close u should look up very close \"Hek Ya BBQ\" if you want good bbq.... Only problem is they close super early on Sunday."}
{"text":"My sister ordered from here for my brother in laws birthday. She ordered a variety of meats and everything was pretty tasty! The one thing I wish she would have ordered more of was the Mac and Cheese! Wow, it quickly disappeared and I didn't even get a taste. We will be ordering from here soon ... Oh and they do have delivery!!!"}
{"text":"Food was cold this evening, very disappointed.  We had pulled pork sandwiches, bbq beans, green beans and waffle fries.  Only thing good tonite was the cold sodas.     I've not had this poor of food since we started coming here."}
{"text":"Dry, boring bbq, that was very expensive. The customer service was interesting...I think they hated being there more than my opinion of the food. We got ribs, brisket, sausage sandwich, with plenty of sides. It was all dull, dry, and finger-licking good. Save your money and your taste buds and go elsewhere. Not going to waste anymore time typing about this place."}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ and great customer service. The manager (Stacy) did an amazing job helping us pick things out and let us try some samples for our party! Best BBQ I've had from a store!!"}
{"text":"I was going to give this place three stars until I had my leftovers yesterday... Definitely a two star place with a few three star characteristics...  Service - Good Food as follows: -Ribs - Actually decent -Turkey - Tasted like deli-warmed turkey. Even with sauce, it was horrible -Ham - Asked if I wanted it glazed. Even with glaze and sauce...the worst I've ever had -Pulled Pork - Dry. Did I say dry? Dry... -Brisket - Not a bad taste, but a little dry -Chicken - Ummm...Didn't have any because they were out... -Sauces - OK...Three of them (regular, sweet and spicy) -Roll - Hard -Beans - Average -Mac & Cheese - Very \"Krafty\" -Fried Okra - What's the hype? It was ok -Ice Cream - Yuck! Taste like ice milk with ice in it.   The service was good. The restaurant was clean. The prices were very reasonable. The food portions were plentiful. I had part of my leftovers before I threw them away. There would have been enough for a third day had I not thrown it away. If I ever went back, I would get the rib plate and bbq beans. That's it..."}
{"text":"We're regulars here at Dickeys and are always pleased with our meal. The nice thing is that kids eat free on Sunday's for every ten dollars you spend. The employees are very friendly. It's nice to get a quality meal and a decent price without having to go to a fancy restaurant."}
{"text":"Haven't eaten here too often although it isn't far from where I work. Each time I've enjoyed something new based off the friendly, young staff's recommendations. They have deals going on once in a while and their prices are great. Overall, everything is delicious and the environment is well themes and decorated. Although I know this is a chain, it is in a prime and clean location. As a matter of fact, I think I'll stop by again for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"The employees looked overwhelmed and unorganized. The place is new so I want to like them, and cut the employees some slack if they are new, but the service really was lacking.  The food was not bad - it's a quick BBQ joint.  I would try them again and hope they get their service dialed in.  It's not there yet.  If they get it together, They could do very well in the area and we observed a steady line customers coming in.  There is another locally owned BBQ joint one exit down on Greenway next door to the Fry's supermarket.  I have never tried them but now I want to go there and do a comparison."}
{"text":"This Dickey's location is steadily improving.  My first visit was after they were only open for a few weeks.  The staff did not seem to know the difference between lean and moist brisket and the brisket pulled pork was just ok.  This time around, the brisket was good... and paired with cole slaw and baked beans, it was a decent meal!    Admittedly, the Valley has much better BBQ and I will never \"love\" their BBQ'd options more than some of the other local options... but their food is solid and the sides are consistent.  It's A-OK!  ***THREE STARS***"}
{"text":"I love Dickey's Barbecue but this particular location has some challenges. I ordered the Beef Brisket sandwich plate and they didn't ask me which type I wanted (Chopped or Sliced). Gave me the chopped but preferred the sliced. It's always fresher and more moist. Also the other stores show you the full smoked brisket and then slice it to your  instructions. This location just steers you to the cash register after you have ordered. Leads me to believe possibly that they precook the briskets and refrigerate and reheat them. Sort of tastes like it too. Also another reviewer Steph here accurately pointed out that they don't fill their side order cups up enough. I would say about 50 to 60% of the way. They were also out of two of the three types of BBQ sauces on the condiment bar and slow to refill them and didn't notify me when they finally did or offer to bring them to my table. Bottom line great concept with quality food but shortcuts in their policies and sloppy follow-through in this location."}
{"text":"Loved our experience.   Decent value good food really great service.  Crystal was really nice and help me with our order.  Good job to the management team in hiring her.  Thanks."}
{"text":"Staff has always been great to me.  Meat is always smoked right. I love their sweet sauce, it doesn't taste like what you think. Try it. Plus I can get fried okra."}
{"text":"I went to dickeys today which is Easter didn't know they weren't opening till 12 got there at 11:20...they saw me in the car trying to figure out were I was gona go get food from instead...n asked if I placed an order I said no i tried online bit it wouldn't take me to this location... they asked what I needed to order and let me in n got my order so I could have for our Easter party that started at 12... I got there in time with the food I promised everyone... thank you for letting me in and going above n beyond for me"}
{"text":"Love the food, the brisket and okra are my favorite. However the past TWO times we have went to this location they are out of something. \"Before you order we want to let you know we are out of brisket, pulled pork and chicken.\" That is what we have heard the last two times we have went, two hours before closing. Very disappointing and because of that we have yet to return."}
{"text":"A big let down.  Lacking any good BBQ spots near the Scottsdale Rd. / Shea area, I was excited to try Dickie's when I saw it had opened.  I gathered a couple meat-eating co-workers and headed over for lunch.  I got the three meat plate, two sides for $10.99.  Not a bad price for BBQ, I figured.  Not a bad price, that is, if it's GOOD bbq... this was not good.  First their meat portions were tiny compared to what I get at Cooper's BBQ in Gilbert.  Second, the meats did not have a good, bbq'd taste, they were plain and frankly, the brisket was kind of gross.  The side of beans were so-so and the fries definitely tasted \"fast-foodsy\", if that makes sense... they had that weird, added crap on them.  Third, their BBQ sauce was VERY watery and pretty much sucked.  Fourth, they only had one size drink, this mammoth 32-oz yellow cup made of hard plastic.. not very enviro. friendly, or cost effective i'd imagine.  Then they punish the water drinkers by providing a little dixie cup.  This place sucks and I should have known going to a chain-bbq spot was a bad idea, but I just had to try it.  Note for gluten-free eaters, their BBQ sauce is gluten-free."}
{"text":"I don't know how I've never found this place before.  Food is delicious!  I had the BBQ brisket sandwich and it was awesome.  added two sides and it was still reasonably priced, 12.00 for everything.  decor is nice, it is a southern rustic look.  Very clean and inviting.  the owner even came over and chatted with us for a while.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time coming here. Got the 3 meat plate. Pull pork, brisket and jalapeno keilbasa. Meat was cold not even warm. Jalapeno beans wasn't to great. Waffle fries need to be crispier. Don't get the corn bread you'll regret it. But they are friendly."}
{"text":"After waiting years for a BBQ place to open in Parma, Dickey's finally answered our prayers. Dickey's has a great, casual feel and an assembly line for speedy service. Their pricing if fair, and they also have daily specials for those looking for a deal. I ordered the pork platter and it was heaping with steaming meat and bbq sauce. The friendly workers cut the meat before your eyes, and most importantly, they take meat from different sides of the roast. You get just the right amount of crispy outside and tender inside. All the sides are incredible, especially the mac and cheese. Get an extra roll if you are a bread person because they are buttery and delicious! Overall 4 out of 5. It isn't exactly like you're going to get down south, but you cant expect that from a speedy bbq pit in Ohio."}
{"text":"Great place for BBQ in Scottsdale. Free ice cream, kids eat free on Sundays! 4 star  GO HAWKS!"}
{"text":"Service was terrible It was slow and they got my order wrong and where on phone and rude , food was cold. Never again"}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I've never been to another Dickey's so I don't have any reference how they usually are, but I've been here 3 times since they've opened and every time it was delicious.   The staff is really friendly and it smells so stinking good when you walk in, I want that smell piped into my house. It's decently priced, not the cheapest place in the world, but I've been to more expensive BBQ. It's also great that it's so close to home."}
{"text":"Five stars might seem a little heavy handed but this is really the only place around that does BBQ like this. There isn't anything special to it, it is just good straight forward BBQ done well. The prices are good because the portion size are rather large and I usually need to take a little break half way through the BBQ sandwich. It's nice that they have giant soda cups as well because that really helps wash down all that delicious meat. If you are looking for tasty BBQ that is ready to go when you are this is sure to please you."}
{"text":"Ribs were perfect but the brisket was very dry. Barbecue beans just tasted like regular beans nothing special here.  If you looking for fast food you will definitely get that here."}
{"text":"Just ordered Dickey's for the first time (pulled pork tacos and sliders platter) for my offices lunch and it was a hit. The owner, Andrew, was very friendly over the phone and was patient with me. When I went to pick up the order everyone was very friendly and had big smiles on their faces. Andrew was there and was so generous and kind. We will definitely be ordering from them again! By the way, their barbecue sauce is UHHHHMAZIN!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed at all. Aside from being greeted when we came in the door, the experience here was so below par that it's hard to give even one star.   The meat was cold. When I say cold, I mean no warmth whatsoever. The okra was soggy and the staff clearly wanted to be somewhere else.   \"Ash\" in particular needs a lesson in customer service and speedy delivery of food. She took her sweet time putting our trays together and stopped our transaction to go talk to another employee.   I came based on a recommendation from a friend, but my family will not be back. The only redeeming quality was the jalape√±o cheddar kielbasa. That's it. If this franchise is a shining example of Dickey's, what trouble they're in...."}
{"text":"Absolutely,  hands down,  one of the nicest,  most well kept places for barbecue i have been since the haydays of big apple and the like.    First the service: every question i had was answered with a smile and a hearty joke.  These guys know their craft.  The food was prepared perfectly,  was brought out promptly,  and was piping hot straight of the smoker. They are welcoming,  friendly,  and genuine. There isn't a fake bone in these people's body and that alone has made me a return customer.   Second,  the food: delicious is over used,  and fairly common,  but god bless is it right on the money.  The food here is top notch and you can taste the dedication these people put into the job.  My favorites are the pulled pork and the jalape√±o cheddar kielbasa, both of which i highly recommend with their spicy sweet sauce! Which was another great point, self serve sauce bar and Icecream station! They have 3 sauces at this location,  sweet, spicy, and traditional barbecue,  of which i recommend the spicy with the sweet combined! Also try their fried okra,  it is divine. What really is awesome is the souvenir cup,  99 cent return refills, and free refills during current visit. Sadly my cup broke recently,  but i will gladly purchase another.   Third: cleanliness- this is better than spotless,  and i hope i see that tend continue.  The bathrooms were great,  the tables were clean,  and never once did i question the fountain faucet heads, the ice cream machine,  or the silverware.   I give this a well deserved 5 stars, and a \" go try it now!\". Thank you to the staff at Dickey's for being so awesome and taking the time to welcome me properly,  as well as answer all my redundant questions!"}
{"text":"While visiting family this summer in Texas, we ate at Dickey's twice.  Both experiences were excellent.  High quality meat, deliciously BBQ'd, and tasty sides.  Turkey, chicken, sausages, brisket, pulled pork, turkey, ham... a meat lover's paradise.  So when we saw this location open near home, we were excited to give it a try.  Did they manage to authentically bring a lil piece of Texas to Parma?  The food did not disappoint.  Tender, flavorful, and generous with the meat.  Meat is fresh, and sliced right in front of you.  We visited on a Sunday.  No special plate that day, but Sundays Kids Eat Free (under 12) which is a great deal for parents.  There is free soft serve vanilla ice cream every day.  I had one complaint.  The smoke.  Now before you roll your eyes, please give me the benefit of the doubt, I am no \"mamsy pamsy\".  I like meat. I know where it comes from. I know it tastes best cooked over a fire.  A wood fire. I know that a good wood fueled fire produces smoke. I LIKE walking into a restaurant and smelling that smoke.  The problem is, the smoke was billowing.  You could see it rolling over the lights along the ceiling in clouds.  It seemed bad enough that I was concerned about the workers that have to breathe it for 8 hours.  Everything we wore had to be laundered (except the wife's coat which was unfortunately dry clean only).  The next morning I could smell it being washed out of my hair during my shower.  That's a little much.  We love the food enough that we will give it another shot.  Perhaps their exhaust system wasn't working right that day.  If it ends up being typical, we'll have to carefully plan what clothes we wear next time.  And don't eat here before going somewhere important.  Hopefully just a temporary glitch, because the workers and the owner were extremely friendly, and the food was phenomenal.  UPDATE 7/17/2014 Made it back today for the first time since the initial review.  Yes it's been way too long, what can I say, life has truly been challenging lately on a personal level.  I have been dying to go back but it never quite aligned.  I am REALLY glad to say they definitely figured out the ventilation/smoke issue.  Just a hint of smoke in the air to stir up your taste buds!  The food was just as great as ever.  Had the brisket as a sandwich, and okra, and onion straws.  The owner was there again. Shows me he cares that the place is being run well.  He is very friendly and always working hard.  I think this Dickey's is my favorite $10 meal in town.  Delicious."}
{"text":"I went here last night for the first time and was pleased, overall.  My food was satisfactory, (though this being my first visit here I had nothing to compare it to.)  This location appeared to be staffed with a decent group of guys that were pleasant and accommodating.  The dine-in area appeared clean from what I noticed, but I thought the prices were a bit steep.  The general parking area was a little hectic, though this being no fault of the restaurant's.    Overall, I was pleased and would try it again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Disappointed at this location. They were out of chicken and ribs. Took our order to go and there were no containers for sauce, condiments, BBQ sauce pan was empty. Looks like they were shorthanded.  Food is always good. Please don't disappoint me again. Get them some help!"}
{"text":"Ok this place is a chain franchise which always makes you wonder if it's watered down processed junk.  I must say I was surprised to find quality BBQ that satisfied my palate.  Ribs were well smoked and tender.  Give this spot a try.  Service was excellent as well.  Some of these family owned joints need to step it up."}
{"text":"Had the half rack of ribs with Mack and cheese was really good for a quick fix on my BBQ craving. My kids even love the ribs too because they were not spicy. The macaroni and cheese was real good nice and creamy and cheesy flavored."}
{"text":"Like the food. It is a little pricey for fast food. The specials they run help. The brisket is their best choice. Been there a few times will continue to go back"}
{"text":"Super tasty.  Nice people, quick service, ice cream.  I am gonna crave this.  I had the western sandwich, or something like that."}
{"text":"This place is great, awesome bbq and service. I am also very picky about my tea, and theirs was really fresh and delicious. The brisket was to die for, and their sauce is top notch!  Must go. I will be going there again."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! Meats were dry sweet tea was watery mac n cheese taste like boxed kraft. Bbq sauce runny. Never Again"}
{"text":"Ordered to go and the half rack of ribs was mostly bone and bark.  Almost no meat and the bark was super dark and salty.  Not sure if they over smoked them, reheated them, or what.  I've been here a few times previously and everything was good.  The pulled pork today was good.  I'm surprised that they would let ribs so obviously below par be served."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Dickey's in Nashville and Dallas so when I saw the location I was excited. I had the 4 meat plate consisting of kielbasa, pulled pork, brisket, and the ribs. The meat was cooked to perfection- it was like a party in my mouth. The ribs fell off the bone and the meat melted in my mouth. The employees were very friendly and helpful when selecting the meats. I would highly recommend this incredible BBQ place to all the locals of Medina or anyone looking for a great meal passing through the area."}
{"text":"Nothing I hate more then dried out BBQ and it doesn't get any drier then this.  Maybe next time I should order the shoe leather"}
{"text":"I couldn't help but feel massively cheated by this place. When you pay $13 for a meal that is supposed to have three meats and you get as little as I did.......I mean it was utterly pitiful. I couldn't believe it. The only upside to that was my eyes being bigger than my stomach and thus the bitter reality did not allow me to waste food.  The mac n' cheese was okay, nothing to write home about. But not bad. The jalapeno beans were super bland. I tried to spice them up with their bbq sauce, but alas their bbq is lame too, so that did not help.  It's bothersome that they have three different bbq sauces that ARE NOT DIFFERENT. They taste the same, only one is a tiny bit sweeter and one is a little spicier. But they pass them off as three different kinds. Cheap, cheap, cheap.  The meat was not bad but way way way overpriced for what you get.  They have free soft serve vanilla ice cream, which I made sure to get two servings of and was tempted to waste some just to get my moneys worth. I get that this is a bbq place and will be a little smoky, but dammnnnn......isn't there like some sort of ventilation or something? I don't mind a little smoke but golly gee this was bad.  I probably would not go back because there's just so many better food options out there. Why settle? Life is too short for meh food and experiences."}
{"text":"Yum, yum,  this is the best barbecue ever!! Everyone is very nice and welcoming, very clean and cozy, u must try this at least once"}
{"text":"I've driven by Dickey's BBQ so many times and finally decided to try them out.  The menu is straightforward and easy to pick out a meal.  I ended up doing the three meat plate featuring chopped beef brisket, polish sausage and pork ribs.  My sides were the potato salad and green beans.  Price wise it is very reasonable with three meats, two sides and a dinner roll.  I rank the chopped brisket the best of the three meats chosen followed by the pork ribs and the polish sausage rounding out the three based on flavor and overall texture.  The ribs were quite tender but could have used more meat surrounding the bone.  Chopped brisket was flavorful and somewhat tender.  All three meats went well with provided BBQ sauce.  The green beans were very tasty as well as the potato salad.  Overall I would recommend Dickey's for a quick BBQ fix and will go back again to try other meat combinations."}
{"text":"The food was just ok. It was a bit speedy and certain things are a. No thanks. Mac and cheese was ick. The potato side dish was awful. The meat was pretty good we had turkey and some sausage."}
{"text":"So I was a first timer today at Dickies.  Never been there had no idea how things were.  My first impression was horrid the guy named JOSEF had the worst attitude ever.  Yelled at me my friend and daughter saying \"Did I take your order yet? You need to move back here\" pointing two feet behind me.   This was our first time here and this meat slanging jerk was thriving as he yelled at us.  I immediately wanted to curse him out, luckily my child was present so the High Road it was.  The food taste like how JOSEF was on the inside,  Nasty, Bitter, Tasteless and Overcooked.  I had the Green Beans with bacon that bacon was old  it was disgusting, The  Beans Flavorless and well overcooked. The polish sausage another disappointment.   If you want BBQ go to Famous Dave's it might be a couple bucks more a plate but at least you will be treated kindly there.  I am still upset on how rude this guy was. Besides his nasty attitude the food was still horrible.  The worst Brisket ever.  Dry fatty and clumped and shredded.  Pulled pork not much better.    Management should consider terminating this employee he has major attitude and does not belong in customer service by any means.  JOSEF you are a major jerk and your attitude matches your face quite well."}
{"text":"I like going to Dickey's.  The food is consistently good, the service is outstanding (the guys behind the counter are always friendly and gregarious), and who can hate free ice cream?    The only thing that keeps my review from being five stars is their pricing. For the portion size, they seem to be a tad bit high.  I only go when I have a 2-for-1 coupon or something like that."}
{"text":"Ordered three meat entree ham and double sausage meat was tender smokey flavorful. Fries were also fresh."}
{"text":"Went there last night for the first time and I wasn't impressed. Food was expensive, mediocre, and lukewarm. The soda machine was overflowing with ice and was dirty. I observed dust on the counter, and it just wasn't as clean as I would prefer a place I'm eating at and spending 40+ dollars at. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"This place can be summed up in one word........ridiculous.  My fiance and I have been to this location several times.  At first, the service was reasonable.  However during the past few visits, the service has been horrible.   First, we called in a pick up order which was supposed to be ready in 20 minutes.  I arrived at the location in 30 minutes and the staff hadn't even started the order and was absolutely clueless on what to do.  Yet, I tried to be patient, picked up my food and went home.  Second, we called in another pick up order.  Again it would be ready in 20 minutes.  I arrived at the 20 minute mark and to my surprise, they hadn't even started the order.  Well, this was enough, I simply advised the staff to forget the order and left the property to hit up Joe's BBQ in Gilbert, who told me my order would be ready in 10 minutes..........and it was.  I typically don't write reviews on restaurants, however, I felt I needed to advise Dickey's of their service issues.  I did, and the manager promised changed and for me to try it again.  So about one week later I made the same order and they were on time for once.  The manager promised change and thanked us for giving Dickey's another chance.  About a month later, we sent in another pick up order and nothing had changed.  It was the same ordeal again.  I absolutely refuse to visit this Dickey's location and spend my money at this establishment.    My fiance still had faith in this location, however the same exact service was provided to her.  Obviously there are some management and staff issues at this location as they have no idea how to properly deal with To-Go orders.    Take it from me, you are better off driving over to Joe's BBQ or visit the Dickey's location in Scottsdale.  The Scottsdale location has never once given my fiance and I this type of service.   As a disclaimer, I want for you to keep in mind that during all of these visits, it wasn't busy.  There wasn't a line going out the door.  It simply came down to a lazy staff and lack of management that caused these issues.    I am firm in my decision that I will never get food from this location.......even if it were FREE!."}
{"text":"The remodel did them good. Way less claustrophobic. Prices are reasonable and customer service was very good."}
{"text":"Ribs were dry and very little meat. Sauce was flat and too spicy for my liking. I'm not going to go back."}
{"text":"***military discount!*** Went there tonight for dinner. Food was quick and yummy. Less than $30 for two people after military discount.  Ribs-lil dry on the outside but inside was great Love the warm bbq sauce and free ice cream Waffle fries - perfect Mac & chz- liked it. Reminds me of Stouffers Sweet tea-awesome."}
{"text":"Dickey's remedied an issue with my teams lunch that was missing all the rolls.   I'll be returning"}
{"text":"The food is not prepared fresh.  I ordered a full rack of ribs and they were obviously from different slabs of meat.  Some were ok most were dried out.  The ribs were too salty and are already coated in sauce you can not get them dry.  For sides I had the baked beans which were mushy and bland, and the green beans that tasted as if they were canned and from days ago.  A huge disappointment."}
{"text":"After our 2nd Sunday in a row dining at Dickey's, I needed to write a 5 star review. Not sure why this location only has 3 stars? I believe they just opened and maybe they needed to work on some things.  Anyway, we've tried everything from the brisket to the chicken breast. While the brisket and the chicken was very good, the pork ribs and turkey made it to the top on our list. Ribs fall off the bone and the turkey is moist and delicious. The sides are so good but the Mac and cheese is so good the kids are stealing it right off our plates. I even needed to buy an extra for my littlest because her Mac plus my Mac was not enough for her. Guess I should've ordered a large side to start. She really doesn't eat any restaurant Mac but I had no choice as she does not like nuggets. Glad I did! Did I mention that kids eat free on Sundays? Umm ok! The other kids loved the nuggets with side Mac and of course the bread. They love the Texas toast though and yes they stole it off our plates. Luckily there is so much food we still went home with leftovers.   We'll be back for more bbq soon! Staff has been very nice and helpful! Place is clean! Did I mention that the prices are great?! Especially when your dining with 2 and sometimes 3 children."}
{"text":"Good Barbecue at a good price stopped in and had the beef briquet sandwich with 2 side dishes and a drink for $10.00 food is consistently good and so is the service"}
{"text":"we love dickies they know us when we walk in they are always nice and clean restaurant! always come here almost weekly reminds us of being back home in Texas"}
{"text":"The place was nice and clean and the staff was friendly until I asked for a change in the order. It was changed immediately but the delivery of the replacement item was, shall I say less than friendly. I was surprised by the price of the iced tea, my bill went from 17 dollars to 25 dollars when two cups of iced tea was added. I should have complained immediately, but as it was my first time there, I was willing to blame it on  my not asking for the price prior to ordering. We ordered ribs, brisket, and an additional half pound of sausage. The meat was horrible, and I am not talking about just one item, or the item we asked to have replaced. I mean all the meat was awful. The ribs were old and had no taste other than wet pork. There was no glazing or any kind of preperation to the meat that would rate as barbecue. The brisket was completely tasteless and had the appearance of sitting on a steam tray for hours. As they do catering, perhaps it was leftover from a recent event. I won't even address the so called sausage, it was just that bad. On a brighter side the beans and coleslaw were excellent... to bad this wasn't called Dickeys beans and coleslaw house. So one star for the friendly reception and fast service and one star for the side dishes. If you are reading this prior to going, do yourself a favor and just dont go."}
{"text":"This is the third dickies I've eaten that and I've been pleased every time. The food is good the service is generally pretty good. If I have a complaint it's that portion sizes differ at each location. I'll still eat there though the food is very good."}
{"text":"Good food although the service was a bit chaotic. I had brisket and pulled pork both were very good. Mac n cheese was institutional"}
{"text":"Excellent food. The ribs are great and Avery friendly staff. Probably the best BBQ available in town right noe"}
{"text":"An above average fast food BBQ place, Dickey's does right by their turkey and polish sausage, but the main events of the brisket and pork  are just passable... A bit too pm the dry side. Service has been mixed but not offensive, though it's confusing to be told they have run out of one of their marquee meat options at 11:30am...  Overall a solid option for a quick nearby BBQ fill, though there are loads better options around the valley (hello Little Miss BBQ)"}
{"text":"Guy with the pony tail has terrible customer service. It doesn't help the situation when the menu is confusing and he has no patience. Flinging the knife around when we had questions. The other 2 workers were so nice, it's too bad their rating gets lumped in with one person bringing them down. Food was ok. The service just ruined the whole experience for us."}
{"text":"my first experience with Dickey's BBQ was in Dallas and was very great so I was much excited to finally try it here in Vegas.  Great little street side restaurant with a walk up order style and food is prepped and sorted on the spot and ready by the time you hit the cash registered.  The service was very quick and all employee's were very nice and polite.  Overall, the portion sizes seemed to be a little on the smaller side. I ordered the two meat combo, which I choose Pulled Pork and Sliced Brisket with baked beans and iron waffle fries. Nothing special about the baked beans and fries other than they were good. Pulled pork was definitely moist but lacked any type of smoked or seasoning flavor. Brisket was a little dry and also lacked smoke taste but had appearance of dry rub.  The sauces available were all very good in taste and certainly helped flavor the meet, however, I am always looking for the meat itself to taste flavor before adding sauce. The soft serve ice cream was a nice little addition available if you choose.  Overall it was okay but definitely not in comparision to my experience at Dickey's in Dallas. TX."}
{"text":"Love the ribs here !!!! So tender and delicious. Perfect combination of sweet and spicy. Mac and cheese is really good and their waffle fries are the best!!"}
{"text":"Very cool place. The service is GREAT! VERY nice people working there.  Got a half order of ribs ( around 13.00) and some potato salad, and fried okra. This was for two people. Decided to try the cheese sausage. Like I have said before I don't like to eat a lot of pork , so it has to be GOOD when I do.  The ribs were so-so. A little fatty, sauces all kinda tasted the same. ( sweet , hot and original) The cheese sausage was GREAT. Next time I come I will def order this again.  We tried a piece of pecan pie, was pretty good. 2.50. Not bad at all.  They have a DIY drink bar with different teas. and BBQ sauces. Thats cool.  Over all its good for sundays,and pool days, when you don't want to cook. Lots of squirmy awkward tourists from all sides... It is on South Lv Blvd.  The service there is delightful and the reason Id come back again."}
{"text":"I had the Westerner sandwich with the chicken and beef brisket. Was pretty darn good. I am not a huge eater, and they advertise this as their largest sandwich, which is honestly not that big. I ate the entire thing, and again, I'm not a big eater.  They also mention if you add 2 sides, it will create a combo for a special prize, which is did not! The cashier didn't ring it up that way and I didn't realize this until I got home. For the sandwich, 2 sides, and a drink I paid around 16 dollars.  For the sides, I got the waffle iron fries which I really likes, and the mac and cheese, nothing special.   The choices they have for BBQ sauce is really good.  The counter is so tall!! I am 5'7, and it literally came up to my chest. Like, what do they not want you to see back there?  The food is actually pretty good, but $16 for pretty much a sandwich, fries, and some mac and cheese is just too much."}
{"text":"Favorite BBQ place ever! The staff is so friendly! I ordered the pulled pork and kielbasa meal deal and 2 kids meals (pulled pork sliders) all of our food was fresh, hot and delicious. To top it all off we got free ice cream! I love their sweet tea. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Food is bland. Beans from a can. Only bright spot was the okra. Go to Mission BBQ down the street. Thank me later."}
{"text":"Read some pretty good yelp reviews for this franchise. Was in the mood for bbq so I went to get some take out. 5pm in the evening. The man at the beginning of the line has an attitude. Shouldn't be in customer service, and is a terrible ambassador for the food business. Wanted ribs-guess what \"we're out of that\". \"Will take hour and a half\" for them to be ready. Is the leadership this inept?  So I got brisket and ham. The brisket is so over smoked as the guy \"sliced\" it crumbled. Little pieces, looked like \"beef hash\".  Ham was totally dried out. Do they cook the green beans as long as the meats?-mush! The baked beans are good. When I got to my car the guy in charge had run out to the parking lot. They had forgotten to give me bbq sauce, \"new people working\". \"You would have been \"pi$&@/\" if you would have driven home without this\"!!  That's right! The sauce was good, and I had to pour it over the beef crumbles and ham to eat my dinner!! The sauce is good, which is why I gave this review two stars. The fried onions were also good. Should have known better, I've tried the franchise out in California where I live, thought it was just a lousy store. Nope-they're bad everywhere. Don't go!!"}
{"text":"The girl behind the counter super friendly, the one cleaning up to close the restaurant at 830 pm, rude. Called at 820pm to place a pick up order (40minutes before closing) and told them I'd be there with in 5minutes as I was in my car driving there... well we close at 9 are you going to be here by then, I replied yes I'm on my way and it is a take out order I'm not coming to hang out....arriving at 830...she's still rude. I almost don't want to eat my food because the vibe she just gave me about. It being happy that I stopped in to pick up food??? I'm unhappy and wish I wouldn't have even ordered pick up food..I'll just stop somewhere else on my way home and grab something different. Never had a bad vibe from this place EVER. But this girl is just not happy with life. Ps. As I write this entire review..guess what you're still open another 15minutes!!! I hope someone else walks in to order right now."}
{"text":"So disappointed I start a yelp acct: The description of the Pork Ribs ( fall off the bone ribs) is incorrect. More like gnaw at the very tough ribs. This was so far from tender. If I had dined in, instead of ordering out we would have returned it to the disorganized kids behind the counter. I did not care for the bbq sauce flavor..and that is just a matter of opinion. But the quality of the ribs were bad, tough and pink. Someone needs to explain what falls of the bone means to these people. I hate wasting money on poor quality."}
{"text":"We enjoy the flavor and food so much.. There is one complaint.. The bun for the pulled pork sandwiches are very small.. It seems as though they are the 99 cent package sized buns.. We pay a decent price for the food but the sandwich is not restaurant size. Food for thought.."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall has really great food its right near the Spring Valley Hospital so great if you're staying at the hospital."}
{"text":"A new location that has recently opened up in the last month. The owner Nate is very Hands-On and concerned about his product. Food is what you'd expect very tasty. I have been too many Dickey's in the past and this is one of the friendliest helpful locations I have visited. Highly recommend come in and giving them a shot. They also do catering and is conveniently located for quick in and out service."}
{"text":"I have been too many Dickys around the country they have a pretty decent barbecue for a chain restaurant, except this one. They over cook things all the time, so they are dry and tasteless and try to cover it up with BBQ sauce, well guys that does not work on anyone with taste buds. This is one of the worst run restaurants I have ever come across. The owner is obnoxious, rude and makes you feel like you are doing him a favor by coming in and spending money at his restaurant. You would think the Owner after reading all of these HORRIBLE reviews would try to do something about it but obviously he is a LAZY business owner and will put himself out of business soon enough. Yes you owner you have a 2 STAR rating out of 5, that is 40% that is an F in any book. This location is dirty and always has lots flies in it. Even worse four of us went there for dinner we all got sick. The following day I called and spoke to the owner or manager and basically they said too bad so I called their corporate office and they said someone from that store or area supervisor would be contacting me and making things right. I have called back 3 times since my initial call, well that was 2/15/13 and now it is 5/11/13 and still no contact back. If the Corporate office at Dickeys cant see this store is killing their \"Brand\" they deserve to go out of business. Wish I could give -1 stars."}
{"text":"Great customer service, super fast, and delicious! Definitely a good addition to Surprise."}
{"text":"I have only been to Dickey's one time, and it was at this location.  The food was good, I have no problem with that.  I will probably eat at Dicky's again, just never at this location.  The staff was rude from the moment we walked in.  One of the staff then started sharing his personal problems with us.  Don't care.  It was a really weird experience, and a bad first impression."}
{"text":"We went here last night for a date out with the kids.  I was very impressed.  The food was fast and absolutely delicious.  My husband dragged his feet to go... but he commented multiple times how good it was.  We had a family pack and had enough for our family of five plus enough for lunches for all left over.  It's rare that we can get two meals out of $40 especially when going out.  The restaurant was very clean and was kid friendly.  I was also really impressed that the owner came out and personally went around to each table checking in on how things were.  I love been treated well and enjoying a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Ordered the \"fall off the bone\" ribs and was very disappointed. Not very meaty. I've had better. I ordered online and the service was prompt. I'm sure there are other good items on the menu to try. Just don't do the ribs... Sides aren't bad. But among the BBQ spots in Cleveland, this isn't a top tier."}
{"text":"\"Barbecue may not be the road to world peace, but it's a start.\" ?  Anthony Bourdain  As soon as I got out of the car, the smell of hickory enveloped me.  Aw yis, I'm ready to eat some meat.  I'll be honest, this place may have over 500 locations in 43 states but this was my first time eating at a Dickey's.  I mainly stopped in because I've been wondering what took over the neighborhood Arby's and because Kate M. convinced me to give it a try.  I'm not regretting this decision at all.    The two of us shared a quarter pound [4oz.] of brisket, a quarter pound of jalape√±o cheddar kielbasa, a half rack of ribs, an individual portion of mac & cheese, an individual portion of baked potato casserole, an individual portion of Asiago cheese creamed spinach, a slice of pecan pie, and two drinks.  All this cost $40.  We went a little crazy but I really did want to try it all!  My thoughts?  I recommend the jalape√±o cheddar kielbasa, baked potato casserole, the half rack of ribs, and the Asiago cheese creamed spinach.  The mac & cheese was pretty standard and vanilla, the brisket was on the drier side [although they have three kinds of bbq sauce to help you get it down], and the pecan pie was just blah.  All in all, I had a fulfilling dinner and wouldn't mind stopping in again!"}
{"text":"We were driving by and saw the place and decided to try it...great that it's a Sunday and kids eat free.  My ten year old was the only one that enjoyed her meal and it was free she had the chicken nuggets and she didn't even get her fries. My husband had the ribs it was cold and the sides were cold the baked potatoe casserole you know it's cold when  the cheese don't melt.  My other daughter and I had the $6.50 BBQ pork nachos....it was cold and the cheese didn't melt it just sat on top of the meat.  We barely ate it.  The good part was the manager came out and gave us different ribs that were still cold and the guy that cut it was not happy that he needed to cut us new ribs.  And she corrected that I was charged $9.99 for the nachos. The other thing was the ice cream my kids liked that.  So in other words we will not be returning.  It was a disaster and not worth the money."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with the pulled pork!! The baked potato casserole is one of my favorites and there rolls mmmmm"}
{"text":"Best BBQ place in Mentor.  We ordered the XL Family pack with brisket, pork, and chicken breast.  Sides were onion straws, fried okra, masked potatoes and Mac and cheese.  Every piece of this was top quality BBQ.  The meat was tender, the sides were fresh, and the bread was warm and soft.  In my opinion the price was reasonable for the portions and their was enough food to go around.    I've been to many places around Mentor and this is my new favorite."}
{"text":"Horrible food. The meats were almost all fat. The service was terrible, the cashier girl was far from friendly. They made me feel stupid for not knowing their menu. The only glimmer of hope for this restaurant was the guy making the food. He was upbeat and helpful."}
{"text":"We were so excited when this finally opened as we go to Geisha House (next door) quite frequently.  Live very close  and are always looking for food options.  Well....the excitement was deflated the moment we stepped in this location.  We ordered a 65.00 order for take out. We had family in town from Ohio and was hoping this was the best option for all of us.   I did this online at 3 pm.  Requested pick up to be 6pm.  We arrived at 5:50 pm.  Stood at the register for literally 5 minutes before we were even greeted.  Not a \"hello, welcome\"?  The Manager saw us and seemed surprised that we had not been greeted.  There was a young gentleman working that was very apologetic and qutie pleasant.  Wish I could say the same for the Manager.  Told him we were there to pick up our order.  After leaving for several minutes, he returned to say they were out of chicken which I ordered.  Out of chicken?  Well...come to find out, he informed us that a large party came in earlier and whiped him out.   Wow.  So, we said to him, basically you gave away our order?  He offered another meat choice.  But of course, that would be expected.  Seeing as we had no choice, we opted for the turkey (which was underwhelming at the least).  He also \"threw\" in another meat choice.  I would have much rather had the chicken we ordered 3  hours previous, but that is what he offered.  Actually, would have much rather received a discount off of our meal or at the very least a gift certificate to try to get us to return.  Well, that will not be happening, sorry to say.   I am in customer service and have been for many years, and this experience has to rate up there with the worst.  Can you imagine going to pick up your pizza and they say \"sorry, we gave your pizza to someone else, but we have this for you!\"  Have to say this is the first time we have ever experienced this in our lives.  Just had to laugh at this point.  Food was ok.  Not great, not terrible.  Hope they get it together or they will fail miserably."}
{"text":"I took home the prize! A whole brisket with all the trimmings and full rack of BBQ ribs... Can you imagine my dilemma!? The brisket is really good. The chef cut them thick like my wife's legs.. and they are just as juicy. The ribs are moist and flavorful. I should have asked for more BBQ sauce.. sweet and tangy.  I am having eggs with the trimmings for breakfast and tortillas.. Life is good when you have a good BBQ joint close by."}
{"text":"\"Improved Since My Original Visit\"  I stopped last night since I was in the area. I ordered 1/4 of brisket and an order of fried okra. On my last visit some time ago, my experience was far less than stellar.   This visit, my fried okra was good, and the brisket was much improved - moist, tender and not fatty. This time I made sure it was sliced and not chopped. I enjoyed the spicy bbq sauce with it. This isn't what I would describe as great bbq, but this time I ate my food and it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"We had Dickey's BBQ catering for our Memorial Day House Party and they did a terrific job at a great price with an abundance of food. Starting from John, the Assistant Manager who made ordering everything very easy, he had great ideas on how much food I would need and he was professional and very accommodating. Their staff arrived a few minutes before I expected which was great and they were pleasant and courteous. The food especially the sides were delicious. The ribs were a little salty for my taste but everyone thought the food was wonderful. My favorites were the mashed potatoes, just yummy creaminess with a touch smokey bacon flavor and the doughy yeasty rolls, I think I ate most of them. We still have some leftovers today. If you like Dickey's food I would highly recommend their catering service."}
{"text":"Not terrible but def not good. Sauces are ok, meat is either dry (chicken) or flavorless and tastes like it is boiled (brisket). The sides were ok but who comes to a BBQ joint for sides?  We tried this location in addition to another hoping that the different locations might do things different or better and nope, they don't. We wont be back."}
{"text":"Really great service and food. I would like brisket that isn't too fatty. BAM! Fried okra too. Hell yeah, what else? Yeah, make with the potato salad. BOOM! Put that in your pipe and smoke it. Been driving by here for a while, not sure what to have for dinner. Looked in the fridge. Yeah, pass. Fast food.... Sucks. All right, time to try Dickies. Husband had more pulled pork than he should have and will probably be in a food coma and pass out on the couch from it, sleeping soundly as he does from a really good meal. Only waking himself up every few hours with his leg kicking and twitching like a dogs and shouting out \"more bbq sauce!\" Before violently shifting back to sleep.  For myself, a hard day of work and school and this place hit the spot as well as a stiff cocktail, but is better for the liver. Oh yeah, ill be back."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and it was amazing. The food was hot and ready to go. The food tasted amazing. And the manager and staff were so kind and let you try samples of the food before getting it."}
{"text":"I've had nothing but bad experiences with this place. Every time I eat here their service is slow. This time I ordered online and when I got there at the time they said it would be ready, they hadn't even started on my order. On top of that, they were out of the chicken that I ordered. Next time I'll go to Famous Dave's."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this was the absolute worst BBQ I have ever eaten ! I knew that I should have let immediately, when I saw the counter man grab my Ribs from the \"HOT BOX\" which is totally no acceptable to me, and if that was not bad enough, the ribs were wrapped in Glad wrap! YUCK! My Ribs were fatty and slimy, Horrible, but the potato salad wasn't bad! Real crap food, in my opinion! I've eaten BBQ in Texas, Kentucky,Tennessee etc. this was the worse ! Sorry not worth a trip! Now i am only talking about the place in Madison,WI, other locations may be better1"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Dickey's, and come here at least once every other week for lunch. The daily specials are killer deals, and the sides are fantastic. From green beans with bacon to loaded mash potato casserole to fried okra, it feels just like the southern food I grew up with in Tennessee. The spicy cheddar sausage and chopped beef brisket are both personal favorites! You shouldn't neglect their spicy barbecue sauce, and don't forget the free softserve ice cream cones!"}
{"text":"It's good. It's a good place to order for a large group since it's more economical with the larger orders. I like their baby back ribs."}
{"text":"Thank you Trevor, Emmons, Donna, Mike and Store #403 for the great last minute service last night! The food was AMAZING!"}
{"text":"I have been to Dickey's twice now during my lunch break at work since my employer is so close to this particular location.   I have been twice now within the span of one month. The first time I ordered the brisket meal with sides of coleslaw and BBQ baked beans. It was good and resolved my hankering for some barbeque.  I really enjoyed their sweet tea.  My second visit I decided on the pulled pork sandwich combo with sides of coleslaw and macaroni and cheese. They were skimpy with the brisket though, I paid $12 for this meal, I expected a little more meat. Their macaroni and cheese leaves a lot to be desired. It is much the same as the processed cheese macaroni and cheese that they serve at KFC. I make a  delicious 50's style macaroni and cheese and if they used my recipe I know they would be tops! It is a common and wanted side that should be really good, I was disappointed with theirs.   Anyhow, I do like the serve yourself hot caldrons of the BBQ sauce that you can pack up yourself. I am a sauce girl so it is nice being able to take as much as I want with a choice of three flavors.  The staff is super friendly and helpful I have to happily say."}
{"text":"We were feeling disappointed with a side of sad. Unfortunately this location is not up to par with the S. Las Vegas blvd location that has great fresh HOT food!   This location is close to home but I don't think we will be back after this first time bad visit.  I don't enjoy BBQ that is reheated and still not warm enough to enjoy. We both ordered a 3 meat meal, double order of brisket and pork rib. The brisket and rib was cold, dinner roll was hard and cold. My one side was even cold, macaroni and cheese. The baked beans were the only item I ate that was hot.   My husband complained to me that his food was cold as well, we dined in so this is unacceptable.  We ate it, what could we do, walk our trays back up to the counter and ask the girls to heat it up after we already took a bite? It just was not something we wanted to have to do so we ate the cold BBQ food and left highly disappointed.  I may continue visiting the Las Vegas Blvd location once the bad taste of this location visit wears off in my mouth :/  Not a happy customer :("}
{"text":"Grew up eating Dickey's in Texas. So excited there's a couple locations in Phoenix. After reading some of the reviews, I was happy that the service I had was good rather than abysmal.  Our order was taken quickly, food brought out a few minutes after, and none of the staff were acting unprofessional as far as I could see. I had the quarter plate with sliced brisket, potato salad, and cole slaw. I like the smaller portion of the quarter plate since the regular 1 meat plate is a bit much for me. Cole slaw isn't weighed down too heavily with mayonnaise which is nice. Potato salad is super creamy. Accompanying roll was soft and buttery.  Yum! If you like Texas style BBQ, try Dickey's."}
{"text":"What can I say? Dickey's is a staple BBQ joint in Texas. If you like thick cut brisket and BBQ sauce, Dickey's is worth giving a go.  I prefer my brisket sliced (hearty and delicious), usually with a side of jalapeno beans (spicy!), mac and cheese (a good, standard side), waffle fries (fried deliciousness), and their spicy BBQ sauce (yum!!!). The turkey is also pretty good. Regular BBQ sauce is the way to go if you don't want your meal too hot. Rolls are decent; the bread for the brisket sandwich is really good.  I can see this kind of BBQ not being for everyone, but if you like Texas style BBQ, give Dickey's at least one try."}
{"text":"A variety of meat selections and I have had the beef brisket, smoked turkey and chicken breast. As far as sides best fried okra I have ever had. Ever order the okra has been seasoned and fried perfectly. The baked beans are also good. As one person said and yes there is free ice cream which is probably the taste equivalent of dairy queen vanilla but somehow slightly better. They also have several different bbq sauces from original to hot and spicy. Great customer service every time I visit."}
{"text":"What a great find!  I was headed to a family event and it was my night to bring the food. I didn't want to bring the \"usual\"  and I remembered trying the food from here at the mentor chamber tasting  event. I sure scored major points from the family for bringing this food!   From the outside, I did not expect to see the ample seating. You go up to the counter and order what you want either for dining in or takeout. I opted on the 2 meat plates for each of my family members. I got to choose 2 sides for each meal and choice of bread. We sampled brisket, ribs, pulled pork, cole slaw, green beans, baked beans, and loaded potato salad. Everything was so good! My father kept going on and on about how good the green beans were. I personally was very pleased with all of the sides. Definitely the best from any of the other area rib joints. The meats were very tender and flavorful. My favorite was the chopped brisket.   Price wise, this place can't be beat. We got a TON of food for around 13 bucks per person. They also have different specials each day.   Oh wait, I almost forgot! You get to serve yourself to a FREE ice cream cone!  How cool is that!"}
{"text":"Gross. I ordered this on door dash. The portion was super tiny whatevs we were hungry. The pulled pork was beyond salty. The ribs were burnt to H, and the beef brisket was dry dry dry and so salty. The Mac n. Cheese was watery and sides were so small. The jalepeno sausage and the bread were actually very good. The best part of this experience was the door dash delivery. Fast, friendly, early even had a insulated grocery bag to keep food warm. A million thumbs down."}
{"text":"Chris, Jackson and Jake seemed like they hated their job.  I walked in and had to instigate the order at which time they did not ask which sides or ask if that was all I wanted to order.  After explicitly telling them I wanted the Thursday 2meat plate and a kids meal.  Then they proceeded to talk about other customers in front of me in derogatory fashion which did not set well with me.  They obviously dislike working for Dickey's and maybe soon they won't be.  With the lack of friendly attitude and general dismissive behavior I will not be dining in another Dicky's again.  I do not know how your hiring process could allow for individuals with zero respect or customer service be hired to work with cutomers.  Furthermore the Resturant was disgusting and every table was dirty.  I picked a table that had the least amount of filth and cleaned it myself.  Also they advised me thy would bring the kids meal out when it was ready.  I placed my order at 5:33p and at 6:03p we were done eating (shared my meal with my child) and asked the Manager Chris for a refund of at least the child's meal.  Not only did he refuse, he half assed gave me two $5 vouchers to come back when the \"service was better\" indicating that he acknowledged how horrible he was running the place.  I want my money back and a written apology from the general manager.  Period."}
{"text":"Just had a late lunch here today. The place was quiet but the service was superb and the restaurant was clean and welcoming. We were asked twice by the manager and one of the counter guys if we were doing ok and needed anything. This is a great place to eat something that isn't fast food! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I got a salad with brisket and my boyfriend got a sandwich with Mac and cheese and bean. My salad was not good at all. The brisket was in a dry clump in the top of the salad. I tried taking some off and adding some ranch and bbq and it was still disgusting. $9 for the salad and it ended up in the trash. My boyfriend paid $14 for his with a small drink and he said it tasted like fast food.  Also the main guy who took our order wasn't friendly at all. He wouldn't even look at us as he was taking our order and was really rude to the two younger guys, probably in their twenties. The younger gentlemen was nice and friendly as he rung us up.   If you want fast food quality bbq this is your place."}
{"text":"ToGo order:  Ordered the Family Pack, feeds 6, 2 lbs meat and 3 sides. The side dishes were about 12oz each, hardly enough for 4 much less 6.  The desserts were extremely small also.  Having said that, the brisket was really good.  I won't go there or order to go again."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite spots, however sometimes its incredibly inconsistent. ie... last time i got the brisket plate 2 of the 3 slices were just complete utter fat.... no meat at all.... then theres times where its just amazing- it just makes it difficult to want to go back if your unsure which experience your going to have."}
{"text":"My review is from a recent lunch there with a good friend who lives very close to this location. The atmosphere is good with clean seating and clean restrooms. Looks like a typical suburban BBQ joint.... nothing fancy or special in the decor. Food was excellent and preparation was spot on...I tasted the beef brisquet and although it was a bit dry, the house sauce made it very tasty. The jalepeno beans and creamed spinach accompanied just perfectly. My tummy was happy and the iced tea with lemonade and crunchy small ice goes along smoothly. What I was shocked by was the pricing.......way too much for a lunch. My tab was over 30 dollars, ....shit I can make a whole brisket and 2 lbs of beans for that... I can't see myself going back here without a coupon or special groupon deal. It is good grub , but 30 bucks for lunch for 2 is a bit steep for BBQ...and I was still hungry. C"}
{"text":"Food is good but customer service is a bit awful. I asked if they had a location out in Tennessee because I haven't heard of Dickies in a while and wasn't sure if where I was was what I remember. The girl shrugs her shoulders in a \"don't know/don't give a shit\" way. There's ways to shrug your shoulders out of not knowing something and not look like a snooty bitch about it.   I had to look it up myself. Typically, BBQ places have good service, but I guess this place has \"don't know/don't care\" attitude.   I got the Westerner with Waffle fries and a coke with a side of jalape√±os and their delicious sauces. Very awesome food"}
{"text":"Not bad at all. The service was great and the food is pretty good for the price. Just don't go there too late because the food you want maybe gone."}
{"text":"On my way home from work, drove through. Got the half rack of pork ribs. Cost 15$. 6 medium size, pretty meaty, ribs. Pretty good, not great. I actually prefer the ribs cooked outside of Fry's markets on holidays. They are $10 for a full rack. Drive thru is convenient, can't rate the sides, didn't try any."}
{"text":"First time trying their meat.  Chopped Brisket and Pulled Pork were both very tender.  Both had almost no smoke flavor and were dry and quite bland.  The meat was almost cold when I got home.  Their BBQ sauce was thin and watery and didn't care for it.  Your favorite sauce at the store would be better.  However, the price is better than most at about $11.50 lb for either meat.  I would buy the meat again just for the price, warm it up at home and use my favorite sauce.  Then, it would be much better.  The little bread rolls they give you with the meat I threw away."}
{"text":"I did not like the ordering process I felt like  I had to yell my order over the counter. I ordered the brisket and it was great!   Food was Great!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Service is fast. Food is fresh. I usually order to go.. but the atmosphere is nice. The staff is extremely friendly. First time I went here I got a plate with brisket and there was a lot of fat.. so I was disappointed. This time I went I had no fat."}
{"text":"I tried this while in the area. Not super impressed with the food. The service was great though. I got the sausage links and a couple sides. The green beans were not good, I don't recommend."}
{"text":"First time to location Crystal was amazing so helpful and friendly and will definitely be back cuz of her"}
{"text":"I'm going to hope all the mistakes and issues I experienced are from new employees needing more training/experience. I may re-review if I ever am brave enough to try again.   My first visit I ordered the \"six pack\" which includes two pounds of meat and some sides and bread. Running about $50 after tax. I asked for chicken but they were out so settled on a pound of pulled pork and a pound of ribs. Upon getting home with my order, the pound of pulled pork was missing. I decided I was just going to call them as I didn't have time to run back down there. Eating the ribs and sides first, we found the ribs extremely dry and the green beans swimming (SWIMMING) in liquid that was not very appetizing. The other two sides, the mac and cheese and potatoes were good and ended up being the only things my family of 5 ended up eating. They were good but nothing spectacular. Definitely not worth $50. Calling them I was hoping they would just refund me for the meat that was missing but Ian, the manager on shift, told me unfortunately he could not do that over the phone. He said since I had to come back down he would just replace the whole order for me. He not only told me this over the phone but left a voicemail on my phone stating this. He also said he was going to put me on a list so other managers would know so if he wasn't on shift, I'd be taken care of.  Just a few days later I go back. The manager on shift pulls the list and I am not on it. Sadly he refuses to honor the offer of the other manager... even though I have a voicemail (which he won't listen to) stating I could get the \"six pack\" again, on the house, for my inconvenience. Ultimately he said the most he will do for me is offer me the deal below what I originally ordered, which only includes one meat, bread and some sides. Disappointed (since I was expecting what the other manager offered), I go ahead and accept that as it is better than nothing ... and after all, they did originally just forgot one meat. They had chicken this time (which was good but again, nothing to get overly excited about). And I re-ordered the mac and cheese and potatoes. (Again, both were good, but not spectacular) Once I got to the cashier, I went through the bag to see if they forgot anything and sure enough, the bread was missing. Mind you the restaurant is not busy and they have about 5 employees working the line. After throwing some unbuttered bread into the bag, I'm on my way. Yeah, not going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"2 people can share one meat item, and 2 small sides.   These portions are huge.  We shared the beef brisket, deep fried okra and potato salad. We made the mistake of getting 2 potato salads.   The kids behind the counter were sweet.   Steady customers, but they weren't full.  I think it's pretty good value, but I don't think it's all that good for you."}
{"text":"This is a fast food barbeque place, so you really need to understand that. I had great service, but I went at 2:30 p.m. so there were only a few customers. I ordered 1/2 lbs of brisket and pulled pork and a soda (one size only, a big plastic cup with free refills and costs only $.99 for refills on the next visit per the staff). The brisket and pulled pork were good. They had three kinds of sauce, IMO the original is by far the best. They also had onions and pickles available on the condiment bar. I passed on the sides as they are $2.50 for a pretty small container (not sure why all barbecue places have such expensive sides, but it seems to be common). A server was nice enough to offer me a side as a free sample so I went with the coleslaw which was real good. Overall a very good lunch alternative. The only reason I held off from 5 stars is the price is a bit steep for what amounts to really good fast food, but I'll definitely return. I think it's better than Frasher's down the street."}
{"text":":::This review is primarily for Dickey's catering services:::  I have ordered from Dickey's a few times now for catering at my work. So far, I have no complaints!   The meats are delicious, the sides are wonderful, everyone finishes eating full and happy. The Sliced Beef Brisket is a big favorite among my coworkers and tends to go quickly. No leftovers in sight when this is on the table! Recently tried the mac and cheese which was another big hit. Nice and creamy, they don't skimp on the sauce, and the noodles aren't mushy like a lot of side mac and cheese tends to be. The potato salad was great as well, has a nice bold tangy flavor to it. Yum!   We were provided with plenty of cutlery and serving utensils, plates, napkins - everything you need.   It arrived on time and the delivery guy was super friendly. Will definitely continue to order from Dickey's in the future!"}
{"text":"Good stuff.  It's a national chain, so the menu items, sauces and meats should be consistent from one location to another.  That said, what they offer is tasty, authentic bbq.  Yum!  They even offer big, goofy yellow plastic cups with discounted refills for repeat visits.  You can't go wrong with Dickey's BBQ."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at the service and quality of food. I ordered over the phone and the  order taker (Bree) was pleasant and professional. The food was ready when I arrived. Took it all the way home to San Tan Valley. The ribs were delicious and fell off the bone. The pulled pork was perfect and the sauce super good.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the coleslaw was missing from our order.  I would definitely go back when I get a craving for BBQ again!"}
{"text":"I had the ribs and the meat was so hard that it was very difficult to chew or swallow.  It tasted very over cooked.  I've had softer, more tender beef jerky.  The free ice cream is that icy, sugary junk you find at very cheap buffets.  The pulled pork was OK but not great.  I did like the creamed spinach.  I've been to this restaurant in 4 other states and really liked it.  This location is just bad.  I'll never be back to this location."}
{"text":"5stars! I wanted to do something special for my co workers. so I ordered BBQ for our at-work 4th of July foodfest. From the catering dept, from the owner, to the wonderful hard working staff, I've never experienced such amazing and on point customer service! Everyone had gone above and beyond to ensure my orders were completed.  And the food! From the pork ribs to the baked beans everything was delicious, packed efficiently and they even threw in serving utensils! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! ! A big THANK YOU from us at The VP!!"}
{"text":"Solid place to stop in for lunch. There's nothing earth-shattering as far as food goes, but it tastes good, staff is nice, and you get free ice cream. If you get a drink then you get a nice little souvenir cup to take home."}
{"text":"First time ordering. Food was ok. Restaurant was questionably dirty. There was nothing remarkable about the food. Workers were quick and friendly"}
{"text":"This location is no comparison to the Rainbow location.  It smelled like a sewer and the ribs and brisket were greasy and tasteless.  The green beans were grey and awful.  I don't think I will return."}
{"text":"The staff was friendly and knowledgeable My husband thoroughly enjoyed the meal.  He says anytime the meat is tender is a win-win. I on the other hand was not overly impressed.  The atmosphere was dull, as were the selections for desert.  There were only 3. A cookie, a blonde brownie and a VERY small sliver of pecan pie.  We got the 1/2 slab of ribs and the 3 meat plate. We also got the huge baked potato with the pork toppings,  that was the most boring dry thing, although it looked pretty. We also got the green beans with bacon, that was bland and I had to search for the bacon.  The fried okra were uninspiring. The baked beans had a lot of pepper in it, which I am not a pepper fan but my husband is, so I guess that's just a preference thing.  Other than that, they were flavorful.  The best thing for me was that cute little square roll.  Other than that, Im glad I finally got to try this place, but still enjoy Joes real bbq in Gilbert much better.  My husband wouldn't mind coming back,  but I'd like to keep it moving and find a great bbq place."}
{"text":"I am orig from memphis Tennessee and have tried some prior bbq joints. This is bye far one of my favs. I had deep fried okra, mac and cheese and bbq pulled soo good I was expecting for some lack luster drive threw mc d's bbq kind of establishment. However I was rather shocked, very good food flavors where all there, bbq sauce was really good, even pork had a nice taste to it a little spicy but beats dry or un flavored. Will be heading back for shure .."}
{"text":"Never knew this place existed, but glad I found it. We got the Tuesday special which was three ribs, 2 sides and a drink.  For $10, it was a great deal.  The ribs were really, really good and dumping a little of the bbq sauce over them made them that much better.  I got the green beans and bacon as well as the cole slaw as sides.  Again, both were great, which is important to me because sides at a bbq place should be almost as good as the ribs.  The further I got into the meal, the happier I was.  My only complaint is that there are no locations too close to us in Summerlin.  Staff was super friendly and offered recommendations on the sides.  A great meal was topped of with a free ice cream cone and I am already ready to go back for more."}
{"text":"I started visiting Dickey's because a coworker would bring in his dinner from there every Saturday night, and it always looked/smelled AMAZING.  I've patronized both the S Rainbow location, as well as this one.  The first 3 (2 to Rainbow, 1 to Decatur) visits were good........  I was given a gift card for Father's Day.  I attempted to use the card 2 weeks ago, and the cashier said \"there's nothing on this card\".  So, I checked online.  Dickey's system was showing the card wasn't active.  So, I asked the gift giver for the receipt.   Yep, showed the card was activated.  So, Target agreed to exchange the card for me.  I went to this location today in an attempt to get carry out.  I had the receipt IN MY HAND showing the card was activated at time of purchase.  Franchise holder happened to be in the store.  He checked the card....not active in their system.  His solution tot he problem?  \"You can get a $50 gift card for us at Lowe's for $40\".  WHAT???????  THAT'S YOUR SOLUTION????  So, I contacted Dickey's Corporate through their website, outlining my experience, including what the Franchise holder suggested as a solution.  About an hour later, my cell phone rings.  Not recognizing the number, I let it go to voicemail.  It was the Franchise holder.  Who stated HE DID NOT offer the Lowe's suggestion as a solution to the problem, it was a suggestion to avoid paying full price for another gift card.  ANY possibility of me visiting this location again went out the window with that phone call.  His first mistake was letting me walk out of the store unhappy (and without placing an order) and the second was LYING about what he suggested.  If he had ANY business sense, he would have let me order my food (which I would have paid for out of pocket) and thrown in a side dish or a drink as a gesture of \"sorry you're having problems\".  You simply don't let the customer walk out the door unhappy.  When they do, they tend to post negative online reviews (you know, kinda like this one).  I contacted Corporate office again....this time via phone, and left a voicemail for the customer service department.  I made it clear I DID NOT want to hear from said franchise holder again, but would gladly speak to someone from Corporate."}
{"text":"I went here today and while it smelled like a dream, I was not impressed. The line was very long, and I didn't really care for how the counter was set up (you order in one spot, then pay in another). They did tell the truth about the meat falling off the bone. It was very tender-like (notice the like) The ribs were DRY AS HELL! They were also kind of small for it to be a full rack. There wasn't a lot of flavor either. You shouldn't have to add BBQ sauce for moisture and flavor. The BBQ sauce was very good, I'm not gonna lie, that's the only thing that saved me from throwing the food away. The coleslaw had no flavor and the rolls were not good. The sweet tea is good. Overall I will BBQ my own food next time."}
{"text":"This place is a treasure in Texas that's made its way down to the SW. Valley. Not only is everything delicious but the employees are respectful,helpful and they take their business serious. All that integrity shows up beautifully presented on your tray. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place isn't so bad if you arrive with low expectations. I had a coupon so we ended up picking two to go plates to take horn with us.   My fella and I both chose the two meat combo. They have pretty limited selections of meats and from these choices I picked the spicy cheddar sausage and the pulled pork and the potato casserole and mac & cheese.   We were in and out in no time and took our meals home to enjoy. The meat was dry, both moisture-wise and sauce-wise. They didn't put any BBQ sauce on any of the meats and they provided a very tiny portion in the takeout container. Luckily we had some of our own to douse the meat with. The sausage was spicy and tasty but nothing I couldn't have purchased in a prepackaged container from the grocery store. The pulled pork was decent but definitely needed more sauce.   My two favorite things about Dickey's were the potato casserole which is essentially loaded mashed potatoes and the crushed ice from the drink machine. I don't think that's enough to draw me back without a coupon."}
{"text":"This is Just first time. Very friendly. Love the drink machine. Very clean and orderly. It's new. Everything new. I believe this will be one of my regular places. Brisket gooood!!!!"}
{"text":"The food across each Dickey's is pretty much the same. What makes this location special is the staff! From the moment we walked in the door to when we walked out they were friendly and engaged. Everyone had a great attitude and were great with my son (9 months). We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Consistent quality BBQ. I have been to several of these shops in LV and Utah and the shop on Las Vegas Blvd has the best most outgoing and funny employees that go beyond just serving up some great BBQ.  My favorite is the rib plate $13.95 with two sides the sides are tough to choose just two. Favorites are mac m cheese, waffle cut fries and baked beans. Try the okra. If you have never had, this may make you a fan.   Great food at a fair price."}
{"text":"We went in on a whim. The service was wonderful, very friendly, and helpful. The food was yummy.  We liked the original sauce the best. My kids loved the free ice cream. ;)"}
{"text":"The food was okay but the service was terrible and one of the staff members was actually rude to us.  My girlfriend asked to order a kids meal and treated her as though she has tried to hold the restaurant up at gun point. The food was pretty decent but the fact that we waited at the front of the line with no one even acknowledging us for 10 minutes was un acceptable. Then when we were acknowledged it was with rudeness. On top of this the the employees were fighting with each other and another patron complained and was refunded.  Thank God they have free ice cream because makes even the worst experiences seem a little better."}
{"text":"We have given them 2 chances and have been disappointed both times! The meat is filled with fat and grizzle! You barely get a couple of plates out of an entire container because of how much nastiness is included in your box. You only get about a quarter to a half a pound of edible meat out of an entire pound that you purchase!  But on the plus side everything else the dogs really enjoyed! Kind of expensive for dog food but hey you gotta do what you gotta do.  Coleslaw was a tad better than KFC but KFC is fast food so that's not saying much."}
{"text":"Very disappointed in my food from Dickey's tonight. I ordered the westerner sandwich with sliced brisket & kielbasa and A side of okra... immediately told they were out of okra(this is the second time I have tried to order okra they are always out) so I got Mac n cheese. The sandwich was poorly put together and the brisket was chopped not sliced and very dry. The Mac n cheese was super thick, I will not order either again."}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner.   I had the Original Westerner sammie, and a side of the tangled onions.  Hubbs had the Texas Frito Pie. My sammie was actually two smaller sammies instead of one large one.  I had one, hubbs had the other, and we shared the onion rings.  The brisket on my sammy was sliced a LOT thicker than it should be (should be pencil thin), and was VERY dry.  The kielbasa on the sammy was pretty flavorless. Hubbs liked his Frito Pie quite a bit. The tangled onions were AWESOME!  Best part of the meal in my opinion. Their bbq sauces are quite good.  Free soft serve cone by the drinks, which hubbs had, and enjoyed."}
{"text":"Dickey's was decent barbecue - I would go back.  I had the ribs and a pulled pork sandwich.  The sauce was spicy and the service was good.  The online ordering did not show any sides- they need to fix that."}
{"text":"First time visitor, didn't even get the opportunity to try the food. Terrible customer service! Even from the manager, who insisted on arguing and raising his voice at my wife. Typically customer service is led by example, which was evident. It was 4:30 in the afternoon so it was quiet in the restaurant, only a few other customers. We walked up to the order counter clearly marked \"order here\", and were not acknowledged by the 3 individuals behind the counter (one ended up being the manager). We stood there for a couple minutes and decided to move to the cash register at the end of the counter thinking this would draw their attention. A few minutes later, we decided they didn't want our business so we headed out. My wife decided she wanted to make the manager aware that we were waiting and were never helped. She walked back inside and straight to the cash register. One of the workers (manager) behind the counter said \"welcome in\", as if he didn't even realize she was just standing there for 5 minutes. My wife let him know the situation and he persisted to say you need to stand by the order sign, which we did for several minutes. He began to raise his voice and argue with her in front of the other patrons. Everyone in the service industry know that is a big no-no. He then denied not acknowledging is, but clearly they didn't as he welcomed her the secund time in. We ended up at porkopolis not more than half a mile down the street, their food was good and service better."}
{"text":"Online ordering here is really bad. The food is great, but 3 out of 5 last times we have ordered online we get home to find out they shorted us food. They don't review your food with you or your order with you.  Last night I got home to find out my wife didn't get her BBQ classic brisket sandwich and even though we ordered pickles and onions, with the spicy sausage and sliced brisket, and chopped brisket none were included. We also got 0 dinner rolls or spicy sauce. To top that as I am waiting for food, they come over to tell me they are out of the creamed spinach, and would I like another side? At 7 pm? I probably should have cancelled the whole order there, but I said cole slaw. So they gave me a individual side to replace my medium creamed spinach.   So since the creamed spinach and the sandwich was for my wife, you could say she was a little let down.   In all we ordered $58  The other two times we ordered qty 2 on meats and only got 1.  Hope they fix this. Hate writing negative reviews on good food.  Would love to hear feedback from management to address this issue. Test it yourself."}
