{"text":"Trying a new place for Mexican food.  Just a medium size strip mall type restaurant,  ambiance is ok, food and service is great.  Prepared oysters on the half shell with onion, tomatoe, and shrimp salsa and an avocado strip.  Don't miss the shrimp empanadas.  Plato with bistec, shrimp supreme 3, and thre shrimp aka Diablo were marvelous.  Karla, our server, was one of the most polite, informative, knowledgable we have had in a long while.  Her smile is infectious.  All in all a very good first experience, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat... Outstanding service as soon as you walk in I ordered empanadas de Cameron as my appetizer.  And my seven seas soup to eat"}
{"text":"Service was great. Can't complain 
We ordered there shrimp enpandas and they where delicious.  We tried other things there and we had no complaints. Everything was on point."}
{"text":"The shrimp tacos are delicious! The Jamaica drink is perfect amount of tangy and refreshing. The Pi√±a Loca is a shrimp/octopus cocktail inside a pineapple!"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD! Great service!! Worth the drive!!! It was soooo good! Luved every bite... The quality if the food wad very authentic. Fresh seafood. Good portions. Service was on point. Atmosphere was very nice, music friendly waitresses. Good family place"}
{"text":"Great fish tacos. Be sure to use plenty of green salsa! This is not your average commercial Mexican restaurant.  Let Ricky take care of you!"}
{"text":"Great food!  We read the reviews. D took a chance coming from the Vegas strip.  Worth the drive"}
{"text":"This is a really authentic mexican meal..great taste on the meat n shrimps ..were perfect cook.."}
{"text":"Great food and a great atmosphere. This is where the Mexicans eat, so you know it's the real deal. The owner was super friendly and made great recommendations from the menu. I left very satisfied and full to the gills! Would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was more like 4-1/2 stars. Really good seafood, very flavorful and fresh, served in a no-frills eastside downtown location. Loved the aguachiles shrimp, the carne asada, the molcajetes and the fish tacos too. The fried fish has this really crispy but thin coating that is just the best! I am used to cabbage with fish tacos, so the lettuce they came with was a bit weird, but maybe that's a regional preference? The mango chela and micheladas were great; as was their Jamaica, which was tart, fresh-tasting, very cold...delicious!
The salsas are excellent, and the tortillas were fresh. But we didn't eat much of the beans that came with the meals...they had no taste at all. 
The only thing we kinda regretted ordering was the fried ice cream. It was frozen much too hard (in my experience, fried ice cream is frozen hard, THEN put into a deep fryer for a just a bit, before serving it, to soften it and crisp up the coating); and it was not served in the \"cone bowl\" as earlier reviews had pictured it. 
Stick with the seafood and you'll have a tasty meal!! And the owner is super-nice :-)"}
{"text":"My lady took me here, This was the first time I've had authentic Mexican food. Bomb.com status. We had some shrimp, meat, veggies, sauce, in a giant cart iron bowl. She accidently ordered 2. All good though. Left overs babes!!!"}
{"text":"The best molcajetes in town with shrimp and carne asada"}
{"text":"Good but even though I love hot spicy food the shrimp a la diabla was waaaaay to HOT to eat - so I took the rest of it home and suffered through it again- and for $18 too much / really not edible"}
{"text":"The food was really good. We had the aguachiles and fried mojara with some fish tacos on the side(2for1 tuesday). Excellent cheladas. Clean and host very friendly and helpful. Will return for sure."}
{"text":"Growing up in a Mexican family it is not very often you find a Mexican restaurant that lives up to your expectations. That being said 7 mares did and exceeded my lofty expectations. The food is prepared in a very traditional Mexican manner and the quality of the fish was great! Bundle it up with great service and an attentive staff and it's almost as great as my grandmother's house. I would recommend getting a variety of plates and sharing. The molcajetes and camarones a la diabla were my personal favorites!"}
{"text":"Both me and my wife had dinner there and the cocktails were very well prepared. ..Scott  y ramona will be back.  The tequila  camarone cocktail  was delicious ...gracias"}
{"text":"Great seafood, great customer service, and if you like micheladas... they were great too. Also they have karoake! Would definitely recommend this place and will likely visit again when I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"recomendado 100% rapido servicio y buenos platillos definitivamente regresaremos cuando regresemos sabrosa comida"}
{"text":"I've never left any reviews but this place is fairly new and I loved it!!!! If you are looking for authentic Mexican food this is the place to go!!! Just a short drive off the strip. Price is reasonable. Food is amazing and the staff is very friendly. Wish I would've taken pictures before I ate. But I will definitely be back once I'm in town again!!!"}
{"text":"Oh my! Our waitress Anna was so awesome bringing us 3 different types of flavored salsas! She also suggested the Camarones with cheese and sauce plate, mouthwatering! Of course the Michiladas are great as well :D
Best Tacos on this side of the Mississippi !"}
{"text":"Reasonable prices, great food and goods services, don't let the location deceive you. Fresh seafood. Had a ceviche de pescado tostada, pretty big and filling, but had to try something else the shrimp breaded tacos were a top notch!"}
{"text":"Friday night dinner time was not too shabby! We ate a shrimp cocktail and camarones a la diabla. The shrimp cocktail was ok- but the camarones were BOMB. It's spicy so be careful!  The Jamaica is delicious! Tart sweet and fresh! Ice cold Pacifico complimented the meal too!  Friday Saturday and Sundays they have karaoke!  It's so much fun to watch! 
The only thing i can complain about is service. We were greeted by an older woman very sweet. Our waitress was rude from the drink order and beyond. She asked us if we were okay about 5 times in a 15min frame and every time it seemed like the frown was more and more frowny. It took her even longer to bring the bill. 
That took the 5th star."}
{"text":"Amazing! Went there for my dad's birthday and although the location is not exactly ideal the food was so good! I had the shrimp quesadilla and it is way better than Lindo Michocan. The parillada is really good too and it's worth the money believe me. It says it feeds four people but my family of five couldn't finish it. The Jamaica is also really good, it's not too sweet which is exactly how I like it. I highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"So good  i usually eat lunch there every other day !!  Best place to eat!! My favorite lunch is burrito de camaron OMG! Soo good!! I recommend this place 100%"}
{"text":"Great service and seafood! The owner is very nice and attentive. Great place to try.
The food came out in a timely manner and it's very authentic."}
{"text":"Pleasant establishment & clean. They do a lot of take out! Had a fish soup & a filet fish plate. The soup was not too spicy &  was filled w/lots of fish & carrots. It came with cilantro, limes & tortillas. I did not want to wrestle with a whole fish body so I was offered the filet. Large filling pieces of flavorful filets that came with a mild bean splotch and lettuce/tomato side. Seafood plates range $15 and up."}
{"text":"Been in Vegas 12 years and this is the best Mexican-seafood restaurant I have been too and I have been to them all! Great service, flavor, and very well reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"Wow was this place delicious!! I had the Asada with bacon wrapped shrimp plate and the shrimp was by far the best shrimp dish I have ever had. Salsa and chips were also. This is one place I will be coming back to often"}
{"text":"Hungover and hungry we wanted the closest Mexican food we could and it did not fail us, service was great and fast and food was delicious. I definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Went here for the reviews and they are very friendly! Willing to accommodate your needs(we asked for different music and without hesitation they did so). The food was DELICIOUS! I say a bit overpriced for the portion BUT not complaining about the bill at all. We came two days in a row out of the three days we were in Vegas if that helps show how much we loved it.  It is emptyishhhh but honestly, I loved it. Service was extremely fast and the server (which I tend to believe was the owner) was very on top of things. Did not let us down one bit. Loved it! Will come again!"}
{"text":"Great food.. we stood here for 8 hours eating and hanging out . Atmosphere was great . Service was excellent ."}
{"text":"Loved this place, the food was amazing and our server Karla was the nicest most attentive waitress I've ever had. The micheladas were unbelieveably tasty and the empanadas were delicious. Very happy to have found this place during our trip. Will dedinitely visit this place again. Thank you Karla!!!"}
{"text":"Probably the best Mexican Seafood restaurant in Las Vegas. The Mexican food has FINALLY gotten better here in the last few years. Service can be a bit too leisurely and it is off the beaten path. Worth the effort..."}
{"text":"So fresh,,, mi favorito eres el plato molcajete lo comparto con toda la familia viene con mariscos y carne asada nopales y salsa ranchera... le recomiendo mucho las Micheladas Great family restaurant super affordable price enough food for the whole family"}
{"text":"Muy ricos mariscos
