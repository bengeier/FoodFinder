{"text":"WOW!  Food is awesome! Service is a little awkward but if you could look past that or just get take out. ... you'll get some great dim sum for a cheap price!"}
{"text":"A great dim sum spot at really good prices. Pricing is generally cheaper than TnT and Oceans but the items here are made fresh to order and homemade with no bitter msg after taste. Friendly chef brought the food out himself. Service is a bit odd, no \"hi, bye, thank you\" when I walked in and out, but meh, I can live with that for food at cheap prices.  Alot of the negative reviews is based on the decor....but for me the decor is humble and unassuming, kind of reminds me of a hole in the wall shops you see in China."}
{"text":"It has amazing food that isn't too expensive. Definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a great dim sum shop!"}
{"text":"I found this mini restaurant randomly and I'm soooo happy I did. If you are looking for good quality dim sum for cheap this is the place to go!! It is a family run business and everything is made fresh to order. Every item it less then $2.50. Only down side is the interior but it's not too bad. You  can dine in or take-out.  They only take cash. This is truly a hidden gem."}
{"text":"This place isn't fancy and it's not in the nicest plaza in the city, but don't let that keep you away.  What this place is, is good and cheap.  It's not good because it's cheap, but the fact that it's cheap makes an otherwise good dim sum restaurant in a hole in the wall worth coming back to.  The selection here is good, and the service is friendly, so if you're okay eating in a place that's not spotless, give this restaurant a try."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go to for dimsum in Sauga.  I love that they have frozen selection of dimsum you can buy to bring home and heat it yourself.  their bao's with the golden stuff inside is sooo amazing!  (forgot what it was called lol)  Overall love this place.  only downside is that its really really small."}
{"text":"Most delicious dim sum ever!! Authentic and tasty!! Only problems.  Crackhead hood rats loitering outside  Found a hair on the Dumplings Sub par cleanliness for serving Bamboo  Cheap atmosphere  Overall I will return though because the food is delicious! So many selections!! So cheap!!"}
{"text":"Been here a dozen times and I must say I've grown to like this place. Firstly, I'm sure they know they're not pushing to rival that of other dim sum places with standard table service. Since it's a bakery, I feel their main focus has been takeout and that's how it should be treated.  It's a family run establishment and they do lack some charm. Some work with cleanliness should be a priority but I did notice at times they're short-staffed, especially during lunch hours. If anything, the main focus should be on the food because I think you get great quality at a great price, not to mention they arrive quickly. I usually order the deep fried shrimp dumplings, rice noodle, and deep fried tofu with shrimp. I didn't notice any off smell or taste from the deep fried items so there shouldn't be any issue with the oil. These plates were done right and although the deep fried shrimp dumplings use different skins, they're not as salty as the ones from dim sum places. The rice noodle comes out fresh with great texture, and for a price of $1.80 you cannot go wrong with that.  I've been a regular here somewhat now; whether it's dine in or take out. There are some things that need work but because the food is up to my standards I can really look away from it. The area is somewhat of a dump but I hope people come give it a try because they're missing out on some great dim sum."}
{"text":"No frills, fresh, authentic, super affordable and down right delicious! Need I say more! We just found our new favourite dim sum spot in Mississauga."}
{"text":"Super cheap. Super good. Super quick.  This place is a small family owned and run restaurant.  The building itself and interior do look old and run down but it still has a Green Pass from the Health Inspectors so that means it is good enough for me.  The moment you walk in you order from the sheets and the food comes out quick.  Each dish was $1.80 and probably costs less than making it yourself...well maybe.  They have pictures of every dim sum dish on the walls in case you need to know what they look like.  When I ate here, the lady was really nice to us and gave us great service.  All of the dishes were fresh and super hot when it reached our table.  Definitely a great place for hangover dim sum!  I must warn everyone though, do not come here for the looks of the restaurant.  Come here for the Food only and you will leave with a smile and more money in your pocket compared to other dim sum places."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favourite dim sum place. My family has been getting take out from here for years and just recently started to dine in. The in house experience makes me love this place even more. If you like dim sum, you have to come eat here.   The shop is pretty small and fills up quick so you gotta come here early or during slow hours when people don't generally eat lol. However, if you do come here during peak hours, the wait isn't too long. They even give you the ordering sheet so you can decide on what you want while you're waiting. It's worth it too because the food is so good, fresh, and cheap. Almost all the dishes are $2 for the same portion size and quality as other dim sum places - such a good deal!!!   My favourite dishes: steamed shrimp dumplings, pork suimai, chicken feet, beef tripe, bean curd pork roll, steamed rice noodle with shrimp, shrimp spring roll, and sticky rice with pork."}
{"text":"Came right before the lunch rush. Even on a weekday it can get busy. This is a small place where you can seat yourself. It's a very casual atmosphere. Sometimes you have to catch the staff's attention or even go up to them. I saw customers going behind the counter to help themselves to plates and napkins but the staff do bring it to you. Like most dim sum restaurants: write down the quantity of the dishes you want to order. Considering most of their dishes are $2 each it is easy to get carried away. Service is quick. Everything was tasty and good quality. However, I wasn't a fan of their desserts. The mango pudding lacked that sweet mango taste I was used to. I should've asked them to bring the egg custard buns out later when I was ready to eat it. The tea was not steeped ahead of time. You are given a tea pot of hot water and a tea bag inside - let it steep! A bonus is this is a place where you can buy frozen Dim Sum food to bring home and steam yourself.   They have Vietnamese newspaper available for Vietnamese readers :)"}
{"text":"#cheap #dimsum #mississauga #food  Okay, quick version: quality dim sum, very cheap, family run business, no ambiance, opens early, communal tables.  Long version: -came across this place on Yelp and it used to be called Jade Dim sum which relocated to Queensway. -the new owners are using newer tables and keep it cleaner than the old owners. Family run because you see the daughter bringing out dishes -most items are $1.80 to $2.00.  This is extremely cheap as the grocery stores are now around $2.20 to $3 for dim sum. -it is more like an old food court setting  We ordered pork siu mai, bean curd roll, Shanghai soup dumplings and preserved egg and pork congee.  Total price incl tax: $9.40.  The siu mai and bean curd roll were delish.  The congee tasted good but didn't have a lot of meat.  The Shanghai soup dumplings were okay but not even close to the specialized places.  Overall, I'm a fan of this place for quick good cheap dim sum."}
{"text":"This is a nice small place for dim sum.  Prices were cheap and the food came out hot.  There were a lot of people stopping by to buy their frozen bags of dim sum and ordering take out."}
{"text":"Happy Dim Sum is my favourite place in Mississauga to get dim sum. Although it might not be visually appealing the food they serve is better than those fancy dim sums.   Most of the dishes are between $1.00-$3.50 which is super cheap for dim sum. I've been here many times with my family and the workers/owner can speak Chinese and Vietnamese and they always remember us because we became their regulars.   Like they say, don't judge a book by it's cover. Though it might not look the best, it serves the best dim sum."}
{"text":"I am not a yelper but I know my dim sum. I have not made any reviews in the many years that I have had Yelp but for this store to have a 3.5 I had to try to help. Don't come here for service or ambience or whatever you expect in experience. Do come here for food. The cost, choices and the taste is great."}
{"text":"It's a small and very busy restaurant. I think it's the cheapest dim sum place you can find in Mississauga. But there is a reason why it's cheap. Food is alright. Only siu mai was good, the others were too plain. They make the buns by themselves, you can taste the flour. I noticed lots of Asians get whole baffled frozen siu mai from them, I think they all know what's the best there."}
{"text":"I came here on a wednesday morning. There was only 1 other table. Service was slow but it was worth it. The food was excellent and also bought frozen items"}
{"text":"In a run-down plaza, it's a regular spot my friends, boyfriend and my go-to for a morning breakfast and or brunch. This time we came, we were seated quickly which is very unusual. They took our order and the food came out quickly. For some reason, the food quality has declined significantly within a couple or few weeks. They have a new staff member, she has a very poor customer service skills. I literally stood at cash, to pay for my food and she completely ignored me for a good 10-15 minutes but helped another customer as soon, as they got up to pay while I was still waiting. This annoyed the crap out of me, the audacity she had. Even the food may be cheap, the customer service went out the door due to her poor mannerism and professionalism. The other regular staff were great, always on their game like any other day."}
{"text":"Whilst the dimsums are good and quite cheap, I'd prefer not to return to this place. Here's why:   1. It's not the true dimsum experience - with the little carts to choose from.   2. The washrooms are incredibly smelly and a sight very few can withstand.  3. The place itself reeks of uncleanliness.  4. Rickety seating.   5. Family run business, and nobody's polite.  Basically, you get what you pay for. I'd rather pay some more for something more comfortable."}
{"text":"I don't know, I'm still a bit on the fence about this restaurant.  It used to be Jade Dim Sum Bakery up until about nine or so months ago.  At first when Happy Dim Sum opened, the lady that used to take our orders was very friendly but now there's some new woman who (like most Mississauga joints) is quite rude; hence, no matter how reasonable the prices are, it's hard to deal with that level of customer service.  Prior to the rude woman, we went maybe once or so every two weeks for take-out.  We would order rice noodles with barbeque pork - I think it was less than $2 for three pieces and it was so delicious.  The steamed shrimp dumplings were a little on the pasty side but well-flavored.  Very tasty spring rolls and steamed pork dumplings.  Everything was always fresh but, in all our visits, we were never given chopsticks or any additional sauces but, for the money, you can't really complain.  It's also cash only.  Just note that this place is not the cleanest ... think Chinatown."}
{"text":"The interior isn't very appealing from the inside or outside but if they renovated they wouldn't be able to sell you such cheap but yummy dim sum!! Don't stuff yourself all at once, the food is very hot! The 8 dishes we had came to $17! You can even buy it frozen to steam it yourself at home. Seat yourself type of eatery but the service is good here. Also lots of parking and remember to bring cash!"}
{"text":"Questionable area of the city in a dumpy strip plaza?  Check.  Outdated, '80s donut joint feel?  Check.  Dim sum from the freezer?  NO!  It's true that there's no \"dim sum\" experience, re:  no carts, no cart pushers who call out their offerings in Cantonese, no hustle or bustle.  However, the price reflects this - there is no tax/tips.  The max. price that I saw for a dish was $2.50, so it's really reasonable.  I don't like dim sum carts 'cause I KNOW that things on there aren't necessarily fresh and re-steamed, re-fried, and re-heated in some other way.  So I actually prefer the ordering sheet method, especially for places with less turnover.   They also sell freshly baked Chinese buns that are ~$0.65.  I knew they were fresh 'cause there was condensation inside of the clear baggie.  Based on the atmosphere, I expected re-heated pre-frozen dishes, but instead they were all made in-house.  The Chinese meatballs had a softer texture, the ha gow wrapping was more supple, and the shrimp stuffing wasn't as tough/tight.  So I was pretty impressed with the quality of food at this place.  Would I piss here?  Not unless I was desperate!  Update:  My mom said she had diarrhea after eating here.  I was ok though."}
{"text":"Came here based on previous reviewers.  The dim sum is mostly $2/dish but the proportions are small.  There was hardly any shrimp paste in the stuffed tofu and eggplant dishes,  ha gow were nicely made but, again, a little skimpy in the filling. The decor and cleanliness,as everyone had pointed out, is bad and a bit of a turn off.  Overall, I would say if you want cheap,decent, and fast dim sum, this is ok, but you are trying to impress a date or new friends, I would try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Cheap all day Dimsum in Mississauga! Finally!!!! One entree costs $2-$3.  Tip: HOME MADE DUMPLINGS!!!  Two of us ordered 5 different type and it just cost us $11.30 (including tax)  Well for the decor, and ambiance. Cant really complain because.. youre there for the cheap & delicious food right?   They also sell frozen dumplings. 50pcs of siumai for only $17.50? FORREAL? TAKE MY MONEY!!!! Would definitely comeback.  Food make take awhile because Im guessing there is only one cook at the kitchen and they arent that busy most of the time.  Also... PLS BRING CASH."}
{"text":"Love this place! I believe it's Viet-owned, since every time I've gone the owners speak vietnamese to me.  Cheapest dim sum in Mississauga, but don't let that deter you from the taste. They're still delicious and taste just like any other expensive place.   Most items are $2.00 which is great! Depending on the day, it may take a while to get your order. You can sit and eat or go for take out.  This place also looks like a hole-in-the-wall cheap dingy asian place as well, so just a heads up, if atmosphere and decor matter a lot to you, this isn't the place. However, the owners are extremely humble and nice and they home-make their dumplings with love.   Tastes like mom made it, delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious dimsum at a affordable price. Each portion contains about 4 pieces and is around $2 or $3. Although the food is great, the service is, on the side, not very great. The lady  is quite scarily ride sometimes. It's a place for just order&go. They do sell some frozen dimsum dishes that can be made at home. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is one of my family favourite small dim sum joint/bakery.  It's small fast food place with outdated deco but dim sum here are reasonably cheap ($2 each) and tasty!    We usually take out and if you come during lunch hour it gets really busy with diner so expect for some waiting time..   If you're not hurry.. Won't hurt to give a try!"}
{"text":"My friend took me here. It is cheap cheap cheap, butttt you get what you pay for, and in my case, a horrible stomach ache.  My advice, do not get anything on the menu that is deep fried. I don't think they ever change the frying oil which would explain the horrible sour-ish taste that any of the deep fried foods have (the deep fried wonton, the chinese deep fried bread, etc). I'm pretty sure the bad oil is what gave me the stomach ache. The steamed foods were okay but I would definitely not come here by choice. Even the tea they give you tastes weird and off."}
{"text":"The place is not really invating ... look so run down and bit messy .  Happy dim sum is cheap but you get what you pay. We ordered sio may , fry dough,  sticky rice and curry cutlet. The taste is same other place but sticky rice mmm I don't know ... :-("}
