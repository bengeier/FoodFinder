{"text":"The food does not taste right, the sauces are heavy and have odd flavors that do not match the \"usual\" taste of Chinese food. The fried rice was hard and not flavorful.

Avoid it and go down the street to the one by Marc's. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great food, best Chinese in Brunswick or surrounding area. Very friendly owners"}
{"text":"Dragon is a great place for Chinese take out. They have seating but most of the business is take-out. A husband and wife own and run the restaurant. The husband cooking, the wife taking orders and dealing with the phones. The food is made when you order it, not sitting in a tray. If you want food lightning fast go to Arby's, this food is made fresh. It's best to call ahead of time and place the order. If you go there at a slow time for the restaurant you will see them cutting vegetables or cleaning up, again fresh. I've had most of the menu, except for some of the seafood dishes and some of the fried items. The portions are always generous, the vegetables have a snap to them, not cooked to death, and the selections are extensive with new items presented every once in a while. Some of the best Lo Mein I've had even when comparing to a more expensive sit down restaurant. All that I've had has been very good from Szechwan chicken to MuShu pork. I am a person who loves to explore food from Moroccan to Vietnamese and others but have never been disappointed in Dragon. Great Take-out. Best in the area."}
{"text":"Not the best.  Ordered an entrée from their diet menu, that was supposed to have the sauce on the side.  I thought that was a pretty cool idea, but when I got home I was surprised to find everything was already mixed.  

We had three entrées, including orange chicken, and everything was just so so. The orange chicken had very little orange flavor to it.  The entrée my wife that had very little sauce, which was a bit disappointing since typically Chinese carry out is dripping in sauce. 

On a positive note, the food was ready when requested via the online ordering system. Everything was very hot, including the egg drop soup.

At the end of the day, there is better Chinese carry out in Brunswick and Strongsville than the Dragon."}
{"text":"My favorite in America!  Seriously, it's that good and really fresh. I actually even ran into the owner at the store today buying all of his supplies it's really nice to see that he buys really good stuff."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Brunswick!  Their garlic shrimp is amazing!  Never go anywhere else for Chinese take out.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Last time was there had to wait almost an hour for take away and it was not that busy.  They did not care about there customers.  Ended up walking out.  The place is very small and not that clean."}
{"text":"I had sesame chicken. It was pretty good but could've used some vegetables. I normally get general tsaos but they don't put any spice in it anymore so it's virtually the same sauce as sesame chicken. The owner is very nice and is very personable."}
{"text":"Finally a Chinese restaurant in Brunswick with good food.  Prices are very reasonable and they will make the heat level as you prefer."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Brunswick Ohio. Great atmosphere and run by a great family. The food is always delicous. Great food and great friends."}
{"text":"The food is delicious!  Coconut chicken is my favorite! The owners are also very nice! !"}
{"text":"This has always been my favorite Chinese food in Brunswick. The general tso's chicken sauce is the best and they will make it as spicy as you'd like. Honestly, this is the only place I will go unless it's not my choice.

P.S. The Crab Rangoon is equally fantastic."}
{"text":"Best fried rice in Brunswick.  Very friendly owners, they will cook whatever you want.  They just added Pad Thai, which was good.  Great Lomein, chicken on a stick.  I miss their buffet, but they have consistently very good food.  They recently moved out of the Buehler's Plaza, but still have good food.  Going tonight again for takeout."}
