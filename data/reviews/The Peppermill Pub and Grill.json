{"text":"This is a quirky and quaint little neighborhood bar/eatery where the staff consistently over achieves. The bartenders are friendly and helpful. The food here is solid bar food.  Great fries. Great wings. The owner and head-chef, Mike has a real flair for Italian food. His pasta entrés are savory and delicious. Mike always has some top notch specials on his board. I always just ask him \"what's good tonight?\" and he's never steered me wrong. He conjured up some fresh clam sauce pasta recently which was absolutely killer. I've been to Tuscany and Mike's Italian dishes would fit right in there... no kidding. The food here is better than anyplace within a 5 mile radius. I've been a customer for a long time and this place has really come into its own in the last year or so, now that Mike has things the way he wants them."}
{"text":"I was passing through town and needed a place to stop for lunch.  It definitely looks like a hole from the outside but inside it's nicely decorated, clean and cozy.  I ordered pasta with a side salad.  My waitress was friendly and the food was very good; you could tell the ingredients were fresh. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is our first visit to Pepper Mill and our last!! Service was horrible, waited for for 53 minutes to just get appetizers. There were 8 of us and only a few received their dinners  at a time. The manager was made aware of the situation but was too busy on his cell phone and going out to smoke. He never came over to our table but made his way to the bar!"}
{"text":"We were here on Friday night just for a quick dinner after work.  I wish we would have turned around when we realized it was karaoke night.  Besides one girl that was great, it was 80 year old men singing frank Sinatra.  We looked past that until it took 32 minutes for a soup and salad before our burgers.  The bartender was so drunk she couldn't even look me in the eye without going cross-eyed.  She brought us the wrong drinks after mine was empty for about 10 min. She didn't even visit our table in the half hour it took for our soup and salad.  It's infortunate that the bartender was so horrible because the burger was pretty good.  If I ever go back it will definitely be a day time visit before she starts hitting the shots."}
{"text":"Mike the owner is outstanding personality. Soups are homemade and fantastic. Chicken parm and the early bird ziti are fabulous. IVe been there at least 30 times, and the service was excellent at least 27 of those times. Bartender is cool. Prices are actually low considering QUALITY and QUALITY. And there  are a plethora of bands if you like entertainment. GREAT PLACE."}
{"text":"The burgers here are fantastic. You won't leave hungry or broke.  I had the BBB burgers and it was great. I also had the ravioli before and it was good too."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly, the food was decent but the decor was outdated.  This place is worth a try, the menu is Italian based with a good amount of variety."}
{"text":"Last night I went to the Peppermill Pub and Grill.  I found this place on Yelp, staying south of Cleveland for business.  I was surprised at the \"store front\" appearance and hesitated, but decided to go in.  I was met by the owner, Mike, who was extremely pleasant and told me about the specials - which sounded fantastic.  Unfortunately it was late and I was looking for something lighter.  I had the Greek Salad with Chicken - delicious!!  The rock music was a little loud, but not overbearing.  The bartender, Danielle, was very pleasant and attentive to the food and drinks.  Don't hesitate, go in and have a great meal and enjoy it!!"}
{"text":"Met some friend for lunch here over the holidays.  The decor leaves something to be desired, but the food was good enough that I plan to return.  My husband got the meatball sub, which he said was probably the best he'd ever had.  I got a half order of pasta with the \"My Nani's Sauce,\" which was also really good.  We had the brie appetizer, which was not great.  The cheese was fine, but the fruit all looked way past its prime.  I don't think anyone at the table was even brave enough to touch the grapes.  While I am grateful that they have a website and their online menu lists prices, the website could really use a makeover."}
{"text":"Visited from out of town on a suggestion from hotel clerk. Parking lot was being resurfaced and there were no cars out front; we weren't even sure they were open.  Walked in and eyeballed the place and made assumptions about the bar food we would be getting.  Our assumptions were way off. The food was unexpectedly varied (mushroom gorganzola rigatoni in a bar??) and unexpectedly delicious.  Service was attentive and fast, though we were the only ones in the place.  The food did not match the decor, but this place did not disappoint. Not too expensive either."}
{"text":"Great Service...Fun atmosphere...So far so good...All appetizers have been delicious! The wings were excellent and a nice finishing touch with Lemoncello Mascarpone Cake...YUM!  Ted and the engineer were here too...thanks Uncle T-Bone..."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to go for a salad tonight because he works security on the weekends and didn't want to go into work too full. We walked into the Peppermill a family owned and run business in our neighborhood to check it out. We were greeted with hello's from atleast 3 different people and immediately felt comfortable. Needless to say once my husband saw the menu he did not stop at just a salad (he's very mad at how full he is right now ) . It was definitely beyond bar food from another person's yelp review. We had clams, salad (homemade dressings), 2 apps, and a chicken cutlet and baked eggplant dinner to die for. The portions were hearty so we have leftovers partly because we tried what felt like half the menu.  All of it was fantastic and by the end of the night we were talking with the entire family (lovely family). I support local family and small businesses and highly recommend this restaurant. We will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour specials,  biggest wings in Cleveland,  amazing  selection of sauces,  and they have White Rajah"}
{"text":"I was driving past the area and was starving and seriously craving wings. I have been to Peppermill before so I knew they had really huge wings but I was a bit in a hurry so as per my fiancés recommendations I called them to order my wings ahead of time. Extra crispy, just how I like them.  I came in right as my wings were coming out and they were amazingly crispy and ginormous. The sauces aren't all that special although their own house made sauce is pretty good. Super friendly staff makes the place.  I was in on a Tuesday around 6-7 so it was dead. I was one of three people LoL. That just made for a more personalized experience. The rest of the food I've had and it's nothing special, a three star eatery but the fact that they so readily accommodated me with my demands and he sheer size of the wings I give them an extra star."}
{"text":"Lobster bisque made with imitation lobster tasted like fish and was way to thick, watery marinara sauce on cold overcooked pasta, dry wings with way too much sauce and tasted like burnt greese. Service was no better, our server sittin at the bar playin on her phone. Overpriced drinks and hip hop playing so loud we had to yell to hear each other. Never again."}
{"text":"I will preface this by saying my rating is based strictly on the service received at the bar last night at the Peppermill. I have been in world class saloons and the lowest of dives and I don't believe I have ever seen a bartender less deserving of the title than Anthony, my bartender last night. I watched him argue with customers about their drink orders. I watched him decant one kind of wine into a decanter, pour it into a glass then pour a second kind of wine into the same decanter without washing it and serve both to a table. When i said something to him about it, he lied right to my face saying it was the same kind of wine, despite the fact that both bottles were still sitting right there. I sat for ten minutes with a completely empty drink before he finally asked if I would like another one, at a time when all of 5 people were seated at the bar. He was far more interested in discussing the drama of the day with fellow employees than taking care of his patrons.  Based on my experience last night, I doubt I will be returning.  NOTE: reviews for this establishment dated prior to 2012 reflect different ownership and management."}
{"text":"This place is great!  I really like the new menu.   We have eaten here a number of times and have always had an excellent meal. My favorites are the stuffed Italian hot peppers, lobster bisque and burgers.  The wait staff has always been very attentive and really friendly. The owner, Gus, seems to love his job and welcomes everyone in.  Update  New owners, new staff, new menu, new clientele, new opinion.  Food below average, we had dinner.  It was meh.  Staff / service....not so friendly, not so attentive.  Probably won't go back.  So sad."}
{"text":"What is the opposite of a bait-n-switch? That's what this place did for me, it was not compelling from the outside then blammo it turns out to be super cute and nice on the inside.  It appears to be recently redone in a nice neutral non-offensive way. The staff was really friendly and welcoming.   The food was outstanding and obviously homemade. I was craving meat after a long day of traveling so I decided to order the meatball sandwich. I now realize that I have never had a good meatball sandwich before this glorious treat. Homemade meatballs...HOMEMADE. They were totally a hybrid, probably pork and beef. So yummy on ciabatta bread. Accompanied by a hearty side dish of double fried french fries.   Heaven."}
{"text":"Great food, great people, reasonable prices - there is not much not to like about the Peppermill.  The owner is a great guy - staff is nice - music is a nice added touch.  Go - eat, drink and enjoy.  BTW - the stuffed peppers are fantastic."}
{"text":"The guy who runs this place knows what he's doing. He has been fine-tuning the menu and the interior since it reopened as the Peppermill and now it is really a good place to get a cheap dinner. From the outside it is just a storefront bar but the place has been fixed up and the tables aren't jammed together anymore. They have enough business that the Guinness tastes fresh and there's always somebody at the bar (if that's your thing) even if its an older middle-aged crowd.  The service always seems to be fine and because it is such a small place, you never get forgotten. If you want a refill, they're right there to sell it and your food gets there quickly because the kitchen can't get backed up when there's only a dozen or so tables.  The food is surprising because it clearly is not bar food. For instance, if you order hot wings, you don't get buffalo wings. The wings are batter-dipped and maybe even baked (couldn't tell) then drizzled with some hot sauce. It's not the standard fare. The fries are spot-on replicas of those Max and Erma's fries and the burgers are real and made from scratch- better than you'd think. The salads look okay and the perch fish fry looked impressive-like something you'd get in Port Clinton.  A lot of lousy restaurants don't seem to be tuned in to you as the customer but this place has been excellent all three times. Here's an example: I have ordered burgers there before and I get the standard burger which is darn good. This week I went in and mentioned to the waiter that I was hungry. I ordered a burger with everything just like before but this time he must have told the cook that I was looking for a monster burger and when it showed up, I had more fries than usual and the burger was so loaded with stuff I could barely pick it up in one piece. The guy didn't say a word, he just went on a hunch and I was happy. I got what I was looking for, he got a hefty tip and all is right with the world.  The Peppermill is a lot better than The Courtyard. You won't have to wait for a table, you'll pay about the same, and the food isn't from some food distributor."}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the 'atmosphere' - it's kind of just one big room - decorations are minimal and uninteresting.  Was also not impressed with the food - basic bar food.  I think it's important to really enjoy your food and if it's healthy too - it's a bonus. Neither of those were true for this restaurant."}
{"text":"Found the place on Yelp, looking for a small pub.    This place has a real family vibe to it.  Not a big beer selection, but Guinness on tap so can't complain.   Had the Greek salad, with grilled salmon on top. The salad was good, the salmon was freaking delicious!  Met Ken, the owner, as I was closing my tab."}
{"text":"Had a meal and some drinks here while home for Christmas.  I would describe this place as a sort of hybrid neighborhood bar/gastro pub/italian restaurant.  They have lots of different sorts of bar food, but the owner is from a very old-school family of Italian grocers from NE Ohio--not sure if it is still there but they use to have the Galluci grocery up in Cleveland  I had the chicken soup with shell pasta and it was very tasty.  Also had the stuffed banana peppers which were really good stuffed with ricotta and italian sausage.  Followed that up with a small serving of spaghetti with a meatball and the \"nani's sauce\" which was your real deal italian grandma sunday gravy with meat.  Other person at my table had an order of wings which also looked good.  Not the standard buffalo style sauce but looked like an asian hot chile sauce.  I didn't taste them but they looked and smelled good.  All of the food was obviously made in house. This is NOT some sysco truck garbage bar food.  The only dish that we did not like was the salmon which came in some sort of reduction sauce that was too sweet for our palates.   The fish was good, just didn't pair well with the sweet sauce in our view.  This may be a personal preference rather than an issue with the dish.  If I had to criticize the place I would say that the wait staff was a little slow to get new drink orders, fill water, etc.  However, this is a bit par for the course when you are seated in the bar area rather than the tables in many places.   Or maybe we were just drinking at a faster pace than they were used to--I was at a table of \"pros.\"  I grew up in Brecksville and it was always lacking a local pub with good food so I was glad to find this place and will definitely go back whenever I am home visiting family.  The owner and his wife were present and it was obvious that they take pride in their place.  I heard that there have been several failed bars/restaurants in this location so I hope that this place breaks the curse because I would definitely go back for some of the italian items.    I live in Philly and would say that Peppermill is serving the real deal as far as their gravy, the meatballs, stuffed peppers, etc.  Just be careful getting here and leaving!  Brecksville cops are legendary a*&holes and you want to watch your speed coming down 82 or 21.  I would suggest getting off 77 at Wallings Rd. and coming down Mill to avoid the speed traps!"}
