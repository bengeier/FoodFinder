{"text":"So, don't even bother opening up the popcorn shrimp... all you will find is UNCLEANED shrimp, still needed to be devained... bleh. And as for their garlic bread... It's not even toasted.. Not sure if that's usually how they do it.. or if I was just unlucky. Pesto was fine... I guess, paid extra for chicken, and got tiny chicken bits. and, the bowl looked awful, but after getting past the sight, there was SOME flavor. Garlic fries are just their regular fries with minced garlic. this is a never again go to place."}
{"text":"The food here is good and delivery service was fast!! Eatstreets emailed me telling me that my food will take from like 45-60mins to get to me, so I was, alright. What am I gonna do, I already ordered it. And then like 30mins later my food came. Yay! So yea, they were fast and food was bomb! Definitely going to order again!"}
{"text":"Nice little pizza joint near the Las Vegas strip. The PhillyCheese steak sandwich  was pretty awesome.                              BREAKDOWN  Taste- Soft steak with provolone cheese  and nice crunchy bread .  Portion- Got the double Philly loaded with meat and came with lots of salty Fries.  Service - Kind owner helped me with my order and very kind and accompanying me and my friends  Overall Hidden gem in Vegas , I got to try their pizza next."}
{"text":"Me and several of my co-workers ordered lunch from Cafe Verdi, as they were one of the few delivery places with somewhat decent reviews in the area. We each ordered the 5 piece chicken finger meal off of Grub Hub. One was an order of garlic, one was for something titled garlic Panamanian, and the last for an order of mild buffalo. When our food arrived, each order was the same (what I assume they would consider just garlic). Luckily the prices were the same for each order. When my co-worker who ordered the food called in to point out their mistake, a rude man told her that garlic and garlic Panamanian are supposed to be the same, that's just how his manager wants it displayed on the website. Maybe they were actually trying to enter it as garlic parmigiano, but due to their obvious and ongoing lack of attention to detail, confused an Italian cheese for a small Central American country. The only order that was credited back was the mild buffalo, as even though the others were two different menu items, they both had garlic on them, so same difference to Cafe Verdi apparently. The overall quality of the food was mediocre at best, and we discovered that their restaurant was once featured on dirty dining. In summation, mediocre food, terrible customer service, geographically illiterate, and filthy. Needless to say, we won't be ordering from Cafe Verdi anymore."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, but delivery sucks. 75 minutes for delivery. I really like the calzones..flavorful and cooked right. Delivery sucks or the review would be better"}
{"text":"Awesome!! 24 hrs now too. Gotta go to the one on the west side. The east side one lacks.  So good that I called them to tell them so!!!"}
{"text":"The Verdi special is delicious! They are open 24 hours! I order from this place every time I am in vegas. Its the perfect food choice after a long night of partying in vegas!  I highly recommend them! Not only is the pizza amazing but they also provide exceptional service!"}
{"text":"I am in Las Vegas on business and working late. I didn't want to go out anywhere and had a flyer under my hotel room door. I ordered the lasagna and garlic bread. I was told it would be delivered in 45 min - 1 hour. I called after 1 hour 20 minutes and was told it's on it's way. I finally got it about 10 minutes after I called (1.5 hours after ordering). The lasagna was barely warm, almost cold, and the garlic bread was dry and hard. The soda was cold, which tells me the lasagna sat there for a while before the delivery guy grabbed the soda out of the cooler and brought it to me. I ate it because it was late and I didn't want to go anywhere. The next day, I was sick to my stomach and spent most of the day in the restroom."}
{"text":"We placed our order at cafe verde, 40 minutes later we called to check on our order status and found to our surprise that our order was canceled!!! Why? Apparently we're \"not within delivery distance\"...could have told us that when we placed the order and it's funny how that was never a problem before?!?  Seriously Verde? Never again!"}

{"text":"Awesome staff, doesn't get any late night rowdies like other places open during the midnight hours and good food. Awesome considering the price!  14\" pizza for less than $7. And it's good.  You can't beat that without whatever you find beating your stomach.   Been here 3 or 4 times and gotta admit, I like it a lot.   Had their Philly cheesesteak and some pizzas. All have been good.  I recommend getting the larger Philly rather then the 3oz smaller. Pretty sure the smaller is way less than 3oz less. They can not add in the veggies if you don't like them.    Open 24.  Small place with decent seating inside.  Says that they don't have public toilets but they do (just be nice and they'll let you).  Ou have to ask for the menu. Nothin is posted on the wall.   Ask for specials. They beat the price on the menu by far."}
{"text":"I ordered the family pack today from cafe verdi and I was supposed to receive a pizzia 3 pounds of wings and soda. So they said delivery was going to take 30 mins so about a hour and a half goes by and I get my food and I open the wings and I have 12 wings so just by doing the math 12 wings wouldn't add up to 3 pounds unless I'm stupid.  The pizzia was the most greasy dirt of pizza I've ever had I called the uneducated  manager and he said he didn't make the menu and starting cussing at me. The smart choice here is insted of sending 30 bucks and cafe verdi call your closest napolies pizza and get good food."}
{"text":"Worst delivery I have ever had in my life. Driver was two hours late, didn't understand how to open the gate even though I order food weekly and nobody else has ever had a problem pressing a button. The food itself was horrible. The mozzarella sticks didn't have cheese in them as it had been overcooked which made the cheese leak out the sides and become hard, burnt crust so basically just empty shells of fried crap. Pizza was ice cold and tasted like a frozen pizza. NEVER order from these people. What a waste of money. They should give refunds for such unbelievably BAD service.  unreal."}
{"text":"This place has the WORST customer service you'll ever receive! They always mess up on orders, they're never prompt with delivering and the employees are beyond rude!  I called to get a resolution because my order was messed up (for about the 4th time) the manager had the nerve to YELL at me. The man spoke to me with so much disrespect and when I asked to speak with the owner he told me it doesn't matter.. And to take my business else where, he also wouldn't fix my order nor give me my refund.  Although the food is decent, they don't appreciate nor respect their customers, If I were you I'd take my business where it's appreciated and respected!"}
{"text":"The graveyard shift gang at work always ordered from this place because they delivered till 4am. If you're not watching your fat intake... rejoice. This place has good Philly cheesesteaks, chicken fingers, wings, fries (ask for extra crispy if your doing delivery, they get soggy fast), antipasto salad, chicken Caesar salad.   My only grip is the delivery fee on top of a tip."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I ordered two days in a row. The first day was fine, nothing went wrong. The second day however was terrible. Today I ordered food and waiting 2 1/2 hours for it to be delivered. The delivery lady called and had the nerve to raise her voice and tell me I gave her the wrong address. I checked to see if that were the case, that wasn't. I gave her the right address. I told her to change the gps. When she got here it was well over 3 hours. My food was cold and my garlic knots were burnt. I WILL NEVER BE ORDERING FROM HERE AGAIN...EVER. Plus the deliver lady barely spoke English."}
{"text":"Their food is usually mediocre at best. Plus is that they deliver to my area 24 hrs. However the customer service is terrible most hours of the day, you're on hold for half an hour or they treat you like a burden instead of a customer. One of the workers talked to my girlfriend as if she were a piece of garbage once as well, due to them being \"busy\" late on a slow night. I would order elsewhere if it weren't for convinience..."}
{"text":"The only reason this place even gets 2 stars is because I actually enjoyed the sandwich they eventually got around to delivering to me! Initially it told me an hour and a half which was fair considering I live 9 miles from the cafe. But the first time they were late almost 30 mins they have a gut show up with 2 2 liters of different pop. As you can guess neither was the pop of my choosing. As I proceeded to give a little tip (even though it was not deserved) the driver looked at it, turned his nose up and walked away without so much as even a good day! Like cmon dude my fries are cold and you didn't even bring the right pop! So again I got hungry and thought I'd try my luck. The wait time again is an hour an a half. This time once the time was up my boyfriend called and inquired on our order which was supposed to be \" en route\". Not even five minutes after my boyfriend got off the phone my driver calls me and tells me he's just not leaving and it's going to be 20 mins to get to me. LIKE WTF!! it's not my problem you guys are down to 2 drivers. The least you guys could do is let me know in advance you guys were short handed and once again it's always better to call your customer first, then for them to call you! They are horrible with the time. I do like their food though, so for that I say just go to the cafe if you don't want to die waiting."}
{"text":"I ordered through eat24.com at around midnight.  The website stated that I could expect my food in 45-60 minutes.  When it did not arrive in 70 minutes, I called to check the status of my order.  Without even asking what my order number was, the woman on the other end of the phone told me that all of her drivers were out with food, and that I should have my food \"momentarily\".  30 minutes later, I got a call from the delivery driver, who was lost and talking on the phone while driving.  He dropped his phone twice, explaining he had passed by a highway patrolman.  Unable to get him to take simple directions to my apartment, I ended up meeting him at a nearby gas station to pick-up my food.  When I got home with my food, the fries were tough and crunchy, but aside form being overpriced, the rest of the food was not bad.  Customer service is seriously lacking!!!"}
{"text":"Delivery  came 25 min late, pizza was good but very cold, fett alfredo was OK and tiramisu was warm and horrible!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken fingers and a turkey club  The turkey is clearly not fresh. Vegetables are not fresh either.  Chicken fingers were gross and slimy. I would not order from this place again"}
{"text":"DO NOT ever order from here unless you like to wait hours for your food to be delivered. I ordered my food at 10:30am and it's 1:00 now. Still waiting... there is absolutely no excuse for this. Ridiculous."}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty good..not heavily salty like a lot of them are. Toppings are plentiful, thick and fresh, just the way I like them. I ordered half cheese half supreme. Tons of good cheese.. prices aren't bad either..."}
{"text":"Cant say anything about the food because it was so bad we didnt last that long there. My boyfriend and I went to dine in and were completely ignored. We had to go up to the counter to ask for menus, they gave us one. Then we waited and waited and none of the THREE workers who were just sitting there chatting ever came to take our order. We got up and left and went to maestros where we got outstanding service. F cafe Verdi."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from this place for years & see a decrease in their quality of food. Tonight's the 2nd time I've gotten food poison from this establishment. I'm sorry but I don't think i can ever eat their food again"}
{"text":"An hour and a half later and cold, over priced for bad service. I used to really enjoy this establishment, however; I've been coming here for years and the service has been getting progressively worse, regrettably I will not likely be back, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone"}
{"text":"Had one of their specialty pizzas (forgot the name) my friend and I thought it was very very good."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service skills. They deliver all night to your hotel. And the food is great!"}
{"text":"Zero star? Can't make a zero star, I'll give it a 1 star. Food sucks, I relate it to prison food. Maybe worst than that. Service is more worst than the food. It's couple guys in there talking about dumb shit"}
{"text":"The best pizza in town. Excellent customer service. They're open till 6 am. The Philly steak was the best I ever had"}
{"text":"I ordered from the neighborhood closest to my job their chicken fingers were cold and gross they did offer to replace them also cold and Gross ordered from this location hoping for a different outcome... the soda was hot and the fingers were cold very gross yet again!!! They offered me a free 10\" pizza for inconvenience. I just called to redeem the free pizza ohhhhhhhhhhhh they were very rude... stating you get a free pizza THAT IS IT... I replied OK I don't disagree... then he stated we will not just deliver you a free pizza you need to order something additional.... instead I went and picked it up. The Cheese Pizza was ok but the philly cheese steak I ordered was good. The young lady at the cafe was very polite."}
{"text":"Yay, they are open again!!! The jalapeño pizza is my favorite. Service is also very good."}
{"text":"Had the wings and fries wings were disgusting the \"mild\" sauce was like vinager and the fries were hard not crunchy.  Figured I'd try something else the swenson much better but the thing was tiny isn't a Philly melt supposed to be filled?  There was more bread than anything . And on top of all that it took literally 2 hours after I was estimated 60 minutes.  Really need to work on their food.  And delivery time.  And on top of that the delivery driver sexually harassed me ... I'd put 0 stars if possible!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I had the misfortune of ordering food from Cafe Verdi through Eat24 yesterday and it was by far the worst delivery experience I have had since being in Las Vegas.  The ordering online through Eat24 went very smooth.  They estimated 60 minutes delivery time, which I was not happy with, but since they don't tell you the estimated delivery time until AFTER you order and pay, what can you do?  Well, 60 minutes came and 60 minutes left and no food.  So I used the Chat on Eat24 to find out about the order.  Melissa said she checked with the restaurant and that it was out with the driver and it would be there in a few minutes.  So I waited.    After waiting 20 minutes, I chatted with Melissa again and this time she told me she would call the restaurant and find out about the order.  Funny, I thought that is what she had done the last time, but this time it did take her longer to answer.  She said it was definitely out with the driver and would be there in about 10 minutes.  So the \"few minutes\" that she had told me 20 minutes ago was now going to be 30 minutes.   Well, finally the food arrived - Meatball sandwich with frys and a pizza, 95 minutes from when I ordered.  The driver offered no apologies.  I took the food in and put in on a plate and took a bite of the sandwich.  It was ICE COLD!!!  As were the frys.  The pizza was at best warm.  So after 95 minutes, I needed to microwave my $30 dinner.  This is no way to run a business for either Eat24 or Cafe Verdi.  I figure they are both the blame.  This is unacceptable and I will use neither again.  I recommend you do as well."}
{"text":"I ordered from here recently. The delivery man quickly gave me my food and took off without even a thank you. I wish he would have stayed a second when I opened my food. Not only did they get our drinks completely wrong, but the carrot cake we ordered was not there. The food was decent enough, but I felt sick to my stomach after eating. Could of possibly been bad.  I would never recommend cafe verdi to anyone."}
{"text":"Okay...here's the thing. If you do something, you have to do it right, or just don't do it. This place offers delivery, but does it so horribly that they shouldn't do it at all. Every time you order from this place it's going to be AT LEAST an hour to get your food, and it's not going to be fresh food, it's food that's been sitting around for at least an hour. Everything tastes okay, and it's cool you can get some late night delivery, but the amount of time it takes is just ridiculous. just cook yourself something or don't eat."}
{"text":"I've ordered pizza from here several times, but it'll be a year or more before I try it again. The people are nice and they try hard to please the customer. The problem is lack of consistency. I've had pizza from here that would rival any NYC pizza joint and best any LV pizza. Other times it's a greasy mess you have to force down. Sometimes the crust is too thick and other times perfect. Same with the toppings. It can be uniform or look like they threw the toppings from across the room. The prices are good and they're open for delivery all night. You're in Vegas; if you're hungry and want to spin the roulette wheel of pizza give them a call. You'll either get the best pizza you've ever had, or one the homeless guy on the strip pedestrian bridge won't feed his dog."}
{"text":"Ordered late night from here not more than 2 days ago, a sandwich and some pasta with chicken. The salad was wilted, the sandwich made me ill, so I figured one last shot with the pasta. Reheated it in the oven today and found something crunchy, pulled it out of my mouth only to find CHICKEN BONES in the chicken. I understand doing late night deliveries is a pain but that doesn't give any room to make people sick or possibly carve their throat open. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"Getting off work, Don't wanna cook, this place has great pasta and sandwiches, delivery takes a little while but, hey the food is always good, and they always hook it up with napkins and enough sauce for things I order. Good stuff..."}
{"text":"Horrible place. Food came is super late and I live right around the corner. Ordered a cold and hot sandwich and mozzarella sticks and the hot one was cold. Very stingy with their meat and marinara sauce was extremely watery. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Delivery took 2 hours, order was completely wrong, driver had to come back because some of the order was left behind. Enough said."}
{"text":"I ordered twice from this place.the fist time was fast and nice. But the Second time, it took them 1hour and 20 mins to deliver the food . I called once, the service told me to wait. I waited for 10 mins no one answered my phone so I hang up.I only ordered chicken wing  and tiramisu cake. It's not hard to remember right? But still the cake was not there. I called them again, and told the lady I don't want to wait I need to talk to someone but still she didn't even listen. Then I called them later and told her right away that I need refund. She was super rude and told me she will fix the order later. I have to call E24 and make changes. I WILL NEVER ORDER anything from this place again."}
{"text":"My food was delivered an hour later then they said to expect it.  That wouldn't have been as annoying if the food was worth the wait.  Chicken fingers were burnt, salad was limp and slimy along with having bits of black debris mixed in it which was definitely not pepper or any seasoning of sort.  I didn't even eat it.  This was my first time ordering from this place, and my last."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from here for the last 6 months. And slowly the food quality has declined. From limp bacon, to todays disgusting soggy cold fries and onion rings. You'd be better off driving through Mc Donalds and having their over salted food. At least its not a soggy mess. Who wants limp onion rings. Terrible. Too bad I had to give it a star to rate it. Disappointed is an understatement."}
{"text":"Ordered a calamari today and the calamari is overcook and has to much breading. If you want a rubbery over breaded calamari this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Order was late and wrong items delivered! I ordered from them through Grub Hub. It was 12:30 and it said I would get my order between 1:40 and 2pm. After completing my order, it updated to between 2pm and 2:10pm. OK, this was an office order, including our bosses sandwich. At 2:10 I call to see where out order is. I was told that the driver was out and should be there in 15. So he was saying 2:25. It was 2:45 when I called again and he FINALLY explained that they were a cook short and slammed. That the driver left 15 min ago and should be there soon. Remember at 2:10 he said the driver was already out? This was at 2:45 so he lied to me the first time?? He said the food would be fresh, they are just slammed. He finally arrived at 2:50pm, the food was between warm and cold. To top it off, we received the wrong sandwich and the wrong dressing. Our confirmation clearly had our order right but they sent a Salami sandwich instead of my bosses Turkey and some mystery dressing for a sad iceberg salad. I called to speak to the manager and of course, he isn't there according to the person who answered. I left my number and hope to hear from them. If they do anything about this unfortunate experience, I will update my review. If I don't hear back, I will also update my review to let you fine folks where to better spend your money! This location was not worth the wait and we won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I can't say how their food because I never received it. After waiting an hour and 15 minutes after placing an order for delivery, I called to cancel. It wouldn't have bothered me if they would've quoted me that length of time, but I was told 45 min and even then I thought was a little long."}
{"text":"Waited 2 hours for a salad and a sandwich when it arrived my salad was soggy and hot look like cooked greens my sandwich was cold and my fried were cold. I call to speak with the manager he was not there the guy on the phone gets an attitude and says he will give me a $5 credit toward another meal when I didn't agree he got mad said the driver would bring me back my money and told me to fuck off. I will be up there when I get off work to go off cause I still have received my money back... smh"}
{"text":"We've been ordering pizza from work here for the past couple months and they have been so tasty and impressive that I drive far to come here on my day off just to get their pizza. Thin New York slices, fresh tasting ingredients."}
{"text":"This place is bottom line number one spot for me ,5 stars for sure . Not to mention there fabulous customer service . When I received my pizza it was on point and delicious ,I would highly recommend anyone who loves a good tasting pizza come here any day"}
{"text":"I called to get food from here. Now I see why they have such a low rating, they suck! The girl that took the order, I gave her directions and they're a piece of cake. But she couldn't get it right and didn't care. After having waited for over an hour, I called back to see what the hold up was. Gave her the directions for the 2nd time, still couldn't get it right. Maybe if they're going to do delivery, they should use GPS. Their loss. Will never order from there again."}
{"text":"Ordered extra saucy wings mozzarella sticks and extras on pizza . The wings were not cooked right or saucy at all and they forgot to deliver the mozzarella sticks . Bad customer service , never again !"}
{"text":"Ordered 5 lunch specials to our work today.   Delivery was pretty quick.   One lunch was missing the drink.   Pasta was really bad. Noodles with green stuff on them. Didn't taste like pesto. Did t taste like anything. Just bleh. Garlic bread was good.   Salad was fine.   Pizza was fine.   Popcorn shrimp had a bit of a shrimp deficit.   Wings were good.   Overall average lunch ..."}
{"text":"We are regulars and tonight disappointed that the cornmeal style crust was not presented.  Hope this is not the end of our normalcy!"}
{"text":"Great customer service experience every time I go in  thank you Johnny for your amazing customer service food is delicious i would definitely recommend this place ....."}
{"text":"AWESOME food, standard delivery time (FREE DELIVERY!!) and they totally hit the spot for late night munchies ;3"}
{"text":"2 THUMBS WAY DOWN!!! Used to eat here all the time. Will likely not be returning after my last visit. Had minor issues in the past, but tonight was the final straw. The pizza and burgers are great. But I decided to come with my girlfriend to impress her with their good food. We ordered the pickup special and a fettuccine Alfredo. The pizza was good, and only $5. The fettuccine however was overcooked, bland,  looked old, had zero protein whatsoever and costs almost $10 after tax!! There is more sustenance in HALF of the pizza I ordered.  When i complained the lady looked at me and said \"it's been that way for years, and your the first person to complain.\" Riigghhht. The lady didn't even offer to remake it for me or offer incentive to come back. At the very least she could have offered to throw some chicken or broccoli on top. Ridiculous!! I (used to) come here almost every night. Probably will never return. This is the last straw. AND they charge an extra dollar just to use a debit card. Cafe verde STEP IT UP. And get rid of the white lady with black hair already"}
{"text":"New management. I have ordered pizza from here last year and didn't like it. But I decided to order from them again after hearing that the management changed and let me tell you what a difference I had their supreme and pepperoni pizzas with wings and it was great. Ot was cooked as i ordered it...well dobe and crispy., thinner crust, the cheese and menlted to prrfection and their house made ranch was one of the best i had. I finally had pizza from a mom and pops that I can enjoy. Thanks"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Order was wrong- they still wanted to charge me then put me on hold for 30 minutes. Disgusting food, not at all the right order. Avoid!"}
{"text":"As I said before in one of my other reviews, our work EDR doesn't always cut it, so sometimes we order out. Kung Fu is great and delivers quickly, but when you work graveyard, sometimes you don't have that option.  Cafe Verdi is open 24 hours, and the food is okay. It's not top of my list, but it's open and it delivers, and when you can't take lunch before 3.30am, it's the best out there.  However, this past order will be my last, as I placed an order online during a quick 15 minute break, with an estimated time of 30-45 minutes. After a little over an hour I called Cafe Verdi, and after a very lengthy hold time, I was told by what sounded like a very frazzled manager that the delivery guy left as he didn't have a room number. Now, I've ordered from here quite a few times before, and mentioned that I work at the front desk. It's not like a new customer. Never before has that ever been a problem.  The guy offered to knock $6 off the offer, and said it was really busy but he would get it out as soon as he could. Another NINETY MINUTES PASS and it's still not here.  Oh hellz naw.  I called back the restaurant and was put on hold 15 minutes until the phones unceremoniously dumped me. I had myself a little woosah moment because now it had been two and a half hours and I was pissed, and it's not like the food is worth that kind of wait. I called back, finally got the manager again, who sounded like he was surprised (I can act surprised too, buddy), and I cancelled the order.  Ten minutes later, the delivery guy finally shows up, and I told him we cancelled the order. As I walked away I heard him go, \"Oh, come on!\" and he's lucky I was at work because I had half a mind to take him to task for such a pissant response (pardon my language, I have stronger words I'd rather use).  I won't be ordering from here again. It may be the only thing open at 3.30am, but I'd rather get a mocha from Starbucks to hold me over until I can get real food with people who give a hoot."}
{"text":"Disgusting order last night never ordering here again wings weren't cooked all the way worst cheesecake (jack n the box tastes better)"}
{"text":"Two sandwiches ordered at 2:10am due to a late night plane arrival (one hot, one cold). Yelp gave me a 45-60 minute delivery time- completely acceptable. Sandwiches arrived in 30 minutes hot and delicious and right to our hotel door! Would absolutely recommend and order again."}
{"text":"Ordered food. Took 90 minutes to deliver not in itself a problem, except they forgot part of my order. Had to call them to get the rest of it delivered.  At the end, I realized I paid about $13 for a meal that was worth about $5.  Might have forgiven the service if quality of food had matched the price.  Will probably not visit again."}
{"text":"Nothing here not to like. Pizza arrived after a late night, hot, crispy crust, good toppings. It even arrived faster than estimated. I would order from them again."}
{"text":"do not order gyros!! cold, tasteless and dry! if u want gyros, go to a real authentic gyro place."}

The food is awesome and the staff is super nice:) delivery is speedy.. my food is always hot and fresh.. you really can't go wrong with anything on their menu, from pizza to wings to burgers and fries.. they seriously have something for everyone's cravings:)  Perfect for when you're in a pinch or just don't feel like cooking lol  The staff is awesome.. I'm always super high maintenance when it comes to my food and they always (without a problem) make sure it's right:) the delivery drivers are sweethearts and they're always courteous (cute too!!)  Oh and their ranch is to die for!!! I could for real put it on anything lol I would definitely recommend Cafe Verdi to anyone that wants good grub:)"}
{"text":"I can sum it up it three words -- Philly Cheese Steak! I visit Las Vegas often, very often, for two reasons, one is for friends, the second being Caf Verdi. I accidentally found them when ordering in after arriving in the middle of the night once. The guy said sure they deliver and we ordered Pizza and a Philly. Well the delivery guy couldn't find the hotel and then couldn't find the room, but we did finally get the order, unfortunately it was cold and an hour late, but even so, what I tasted was bliss. Going to the caf the very next day we ordered it again, fresh this time and it was ecstasy. The weird thing is that their Philly Cheese Steak it not quite a real Philly, it is a weird Las Vegas Mediterranean version of one that is just fantastically delicious. If you go to Las Vegas and like Philly Cheese Steak, Caf Verdi is a must.  Overall Rating: 5+ Pros: Philly Cheese Steak, Close to Downtown Las Vegas, Reasonable Price Cons: Delivery gets lost, Small Dining Area, Tables wobble Cost: $$ of 5 Recommendation: Highly Recommended"}
{"text":"At my job, we order delivery from here at least once a week (delivery usually takes about 45 minutes - an hour when we order at 11am). Unfortunately, nearly every single time, the order is wrong. The most recent time was the last straw, because when we called to tell them it was wrong, the man on the phone raised his voice and was incredibly rude, saying there was nothing they could do. He also argued with us, saying that he physically stood next to the cook while he was preparing it, and it was 100% right. When we brought the order down to their restaurant to prove that it was in fact wrong, they \"fixed\" the situation by giving us the sauce it was supposed to have - except that STILL was not right, because the replacement sauce they gave us was oily, watered down, and not at all the same sauce that we order and enjoy every week. So over it, will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Prices are good, but so far the last two experiences were pretty much negative. First time I received the wrong sandwich, and this time, after I specifically asked if sandwich was hot, and even asked to make sure bread was toasted, I received the sandwich cold including the inside; obviously it was mildly microwaved, while my co-worker's different sandwich was toasted. If I hadn't inquired ahead of time what I was getting, it would be ok, but the fact that not only I asked to make sure sandwich is grilled or pressed, but bread and chicken were microwaved instead of grilled was just wrong. Bread was also a few days old because when I tried to press everything inside so I can take a bite, it started to come apart.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because this time they offered to send me another sandwich, but I declined, because I already ate mine, and did not want to wait another hour to have my lunch. But the thing is that food should not be microwaved under any circumstance, and when you ask for something, you expect to get what is promised. I could have ordered something else, but they confirmed what I asked for... Oh and by the way, my co-worker ordered the sausage sandwich believing it was whole pieces, instead he got thinly sliced pieces like the ones you put on a pizza. A piece of advice: please specify on the menu what you are getting... Last time we order from there."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery with these guys. Was quoted 60-75 minutes initially which seemed steep to me given that it was a later Sunday evening. I waited about an hour and 20 minutes and there was still no delivery so I contacted the restaurant and they said the driver had left 5-10 minutes ago. Long story short, the delivery didn't arrive until after 2 hours... And all I had was one pasta and mozzarella sticks! The driver was rude when he delivered and the food was cold and dripping in grease!   Will never order from the restaurant and I should've known by all the other bad reviews, I just thought I would give it the benefit of the doubt!"}
{"text":"Prices are pretty decent. I love the fact that you get fries with just about anything you order. The delivery time was pretty fast but it's kind of sad that they wont bring your order up to your room. If you order from Café Verdi, expect to walk all the way down to either your hotels valet or check in counter....  The pizza tasted pretty decent but as others have stated, it is indeed pretty greasy.   The only things that made this a 3 star review instead of a 2 star review is the fact that they are open 24 hours and they brought my two can sodas ice cold."}
{"text":"Dont know if it were cafe verdi or Grubhub but my food took longer then an hour , I'm still waiting on delivery! Gr!"}
{"text":"Their food is good but not worth it because of their lack of service of not checking the bag and making sure everything is there. Did this twice in a row!!! Shows how much they care?!?   also if you want your food delivered one hour later this is a perfect place for you!!!"}
{"text":"I give this place 1 star because even thou their food is good their service of delivering is horrible!   1st - they take more then a hour to deliver  2nd - always forget something in my order happened TWICE in a row!!!   Offered me my money back because he was close to my house still, what a wonderful way to keep a customer happy.    If you guys can't deliver within your own standards that you guys say you do why even put an option of delivery!? you're just putting your business to failure."}
{"text":"I don't know why people disliked this place.  On a late night in Vegas, this was the go to spot for pizza delivery. I thoroughly enjoyed the flavor of their pizza.  This being open late night was a good look.  Liked the Spinach and Feta, the crust, the sauce.  Bam!  Thank you Cafe Verdi!"}
{"text":"They really need a lesson  in customer service !!  Went there one night and it was good. 2nd time absolutely TERRIBLE !!! $6 pizza !!!! Yeah ok. Not So Much!?? Forgot to Mention the called me a \"Faggot\"."}
{"text":"They r closed for remodeling. It wasn't very convenient when it says 24/7  during my late night pizza craving"}
{"text":"The BBQ chicken pizza and wings are the best in town! I've tried BBQ chicken pizza all around the city and their's comes best by far. Family owned and operated. Super kind people. Wide selection on the menu if you're feeling spontaneous and they're open late too!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I wish they had 0 stars to give. This place is so rundown and horrible! Please don't make the mistake I did and try it! Not only were they out of practically everything I ordered, some of my order didn't even arrive! Then when I called to ask them if they could bring it, the man on the phone was acting like it was my fault and was so rude even raising his voice! The delivery took over an hour to get here and it's been almost 2 hours since I called about the missing food that they said they were going to bring. Pretty sure it's not coming! BEWARE!!!!"}
{"text":"Free pizza coupon's make this place the best value in town.  What's more is they even deliver 24/7!  Here is the key to ordering from this restaurant: If you like ordering pastas, gyros, sandwiches, or burgers for delivery, you basically get a free pizza to go with it, which is nice for those who like to have a nice hot fresh slice of pizza and toss the rest in the frig for a cold pizza feast later."}
{"text":"I can give less then 5 stars, as matter of fact i could give 100 stars if is possible, i ordered here like 6 times all different dishes and they all great, the food is just amazing!! Hold on to that cook, because the food is clean fresh and tasty"}
{"text":"Drove 1180 miles and looked for a 24 hour restaurant to just order some pizza. We ordered two fettuccine alfredos with chicken, a Ceasar salad, a large pizza, cheesy bread and a Pepsi. The only thing worth a crap was the Pepsi. The pizza was alright but arrived cold. The alfredos tasted like fettuccine pasta covered in coffee creamer with rubbery chicken. We called to voice our concerns and the man on the phone stated that the alfredo sauce at been sitting in a vat since the early morning! The previous early morning! He also voiced that they knew there could be a potential for a problem! We paid 70 dollars for this mess. Still waiting on a refund that was promised!"}
{"text":"Okay let's be honest, the only reason 9 out of 10 of us order from here, is because it's 4am and your trashed. I've never had a problem with this place, we use to order here all the time after partying the night away. The other night, we come staggering home from fremont street and decide to order our regular, 10 inch pizza and wings. Of course the food itself is not that great, but its 4am and there isn't too many other options at that hour. We waited 2 hours for a food, which we realize, there is lots of other drunks following our foot steps in search of their late-night snacks. After 2 hours, we call and they tell us the driver came, and we never answered the door or the phone. First off, we live in a highrise, with a door a man. The door man ALWAYS calls us before they let someone up. It doesn't matter if your my Grandma or the Cafe Verdi delivery guy, he is going to call and make sure it's okay if they come up. Well, we never got a call. Neither did the driver. According to the front desk, no one ever showed up with a pizza during those 2 hours. The person on the phone from Cafe Verdi goes on to say \"We have had problems with you guys not answering the door before.\" Well that is a lie. I don't know if they confused us with someone else, another address, or something. Of course we bitched them out and I got them to reverse the charge on my credit card. Needless to say, we aren't going to order from here anymore. Boston Pizza delivers until 4am and their food x10 better."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great prices and fast delivery service. I highly recommend eating from here, the food was still fresh and warm when we got it. Fries and pizza are amazing. Don't listen to the other orders they probably have wrong directions we got called twice to double check the right location and they delivered right to our hotel room."}
{"text":"Was the pizza good? Yes, it was ok, average... but it would have been better if it wasn't cold by the time it got to us. We ordered a bbq chicken pizza with three sides of ranch. It arrived an hour and a half after we ordered it, with no ranch dressing. When I asked the guy where it was, he said \"sorry, whoever took the order didn't write it on the ticket,\" which was taped to the box. He pointed to the ticket on the box, then he left. My boyfriend and I went back up to our room. I noticed \"3x ranch, was written on the ticket, and even circled! Nice. I'm so glad we waited an hour and a half for a cold 28 dollar pizza, with no sides, to be delivered by a moron. Thanks Cafe Verdi. My boyfriend and I will not be ordering from you again next time we're in vegas, which is often."}
{"text":"I usually get a thin crust pizza from this place once a week or so. Last night was no different. Until a few hours after my boyfriend and I finished the pizza. We started vomiting and have continued to do so for over 12 hours. :( I will never get another pizza here again."}
{"text":"Late night or 5 am food on a Saturday night? Don't want to leave your hotel room? This place is it. Fast Italian, so don't get your hopes up. Got a dinner salad though and was pleasantly surprised by its size & quality. 2 girls late night snacks delivered...$13 plus tip. Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"Beyond expectation Never had food deliverd where I needed to let food cool down Baked ravoli excellent garlic cheese bread Excellent ! Will recommend to anyone and everyone ! Thank you cafe Verdi ."}
{"text":"This place is a real life saver. Only spot I can find that delivers food 24/7!!! Thank you cafe verde!!!!"}
{"text":"Super declicious! Always on time with delivery! I love their pizzas, I always get a large and create my own! Burgers are really yummy! Fries are yum! Love cafe Verdi!"}
{"text":"This place is trash. The wings were dry AF, and the spaghetti tastes like the bulllshit they serve at $5 buffets. I ordered this crap through UBER eats . So I called the restaurant to tell him about my complaint he said bring it and we can reimburse you so I drove 15 min to take their bullshit food back. Just so he can can tell me he can't reimburse me because it was through UBER but he knew that already. Then he made me waste 20 minutes more of my life while we figured it out on the phone with UBER. Then uber eats wasted another 10 min of my life to resolve my problem. Horrible freaking experience.  NEVER ordering from this place again. A whole hour wasted and still hungry."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible customer service. My food was ordered over one hour 25 minutes ago. Their driver called me 30 minutes ago to tell me he was leaving the restaurant. He is still not here. I called to ask where he might be. Johnny who answered The phone told me he doesn't know. I asked what will the restaurant do if my food is still not hot. He made up excuses. I said is it possible that my food that's taking over 30 minutes now will be hot when it gets to me? He said, well it won't be cold. I said please do not joke around, it is late and I am hungry. I then said is it fair if it's cold I will call you back and you either resend me a hot order or you refund my money? This guy said no. I asked for a manager. He said there is not one there now. I said when will they be there? He said you call the owner tomorrow but I don't care if you call him. This is horrible customer service and this place should be ashamed of themselves. The only saving grace, when the driver did get here, he was very polite and very nice."}
{"text":"cold burger cold fries cold onion rings squashed dessert wrong soda crappy salad extra slow delivery never from this dump again I had to throw it all away,even the soda was flat"}
{"text":"okay, so i work nights and it's impossible to find food that isn't fast food at 3am. good thing i live in Vegas!  after driving the strip to no avail for some pizza. i finally stumble upon Cafe Verdi. it's located in a strip mall, and easy to miss. i know they deliver 24 hours but i live out of range so i have always gotten carryout. lemme tell you, they're pizza is YUMMY!  first time i went i ordered a simple pepperoni pizza, and my friend ordered the spinach. my pizza was great. right amount of cheese, right amount of sauce, sauce didn't taste nasty. my friend's pizza was extremely flavorful, and just all around good.  2nd time coming i got hawaiian, and my friend got the BBQ chicken. hawaiian was good, duh, and my friend's was awesome once again! other than when the employees yell at each other in the back (pretty entertaining), and the lie about having fresh lemonade (it's country time), i will definitely be coming back for the remainder of my time in vegas :]"}
{"text":"very disappointed. gave them a third try because the first and second times were horrible in regart to food, delivary time and order accuracy. ordered a mushroom swiss medium mozzarella sticks with extra ranch. when the food came it was cold, my burger was burnt to a crisp,fries were soggy and the mozzarella sticks were still cold in the middle, and they forgot my ranch! Never again will I order from them."}
{"text":"WHAT THE F@CK IS THIS SH@T?  Suppose to be zucchini sticks? These were tiny, gross, and mushy, had more bread than zucchini, never ever again! A waste of $5.99! FARMER BOYS is $4.99 and way bigger & crispier!!!  The pizza is gross too The cheese burgers will give you a heart attack"}
{"text":"Awful service, always a disappointment. I don't recommend getting food from here, rude employees as well."}
{"text":"I placed a order with these jerks, and the manager was the delivery boy for the night. You would assume that the manager would have a sense of direction and great customer service.... No!...... Also put into perspective that I was at a friend's \"apartment\"  and apartments have maps of the complex at the front office which most drivers use to navigate themselves to a customer's apartment, but no I was left to give him directions, simple one at that and the \"Manager\" failed to pay attention to detail causing him to miss his turn and built frustration. After a extended frustrating moments of him missing his turn I broke and said \"keep the effing salads\",  the manager said \"FUCK YOU\", then hung up in my face. I called the store location asking them to refund the money back to my debit card because I did not receive my order, the employee wanted to speak with the \"manager\",  I said regardless of what he says I did not receive my order due to him having a bad sense of direction, cutting me off he puts me on hold and automatically, so I hang up and do not receive a call back at all. You would assume that they would have the desency to put my money back on my card right?..... NOPE! I CALL THE FOLLOWING DAY AND I WAS DIRECTED TO TALK TO THE SAME MAN WHO \"CUT ME OFF PUTTING ME ON HOLD TO SPEAK WITH HIS RUDE MANAGER\", HE PROCEEDED TO EXPLAIN TO ME THAT THE MANAGER AND I SAY THIS AGAIN THE MANAGER INSTRUCTED HIM NOT TO GIVE MY MONEY BACK BECAUSE I GAVE HIM POOR DIRECTIONS. It's not my fault your manager does not posses the basic knowledge to read a map, it's not my fault he got frustrated due to my \"poor\" directions he failed to pay close detail to, it's not my fault I reflected frustration when I sensed he was, and I have every right to cancel my order and to ask for a refund, WHICH WAS NOT GIVEN TO ME. THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE AND I WONDER WHAT WOULD IT HAVE BEEN LIKE IF IT WERE SOMEONE ELSE IN A SCENARIO WHERE THE CUSTOMER  FROM OUT OF TOWN VISITING A FRIEND OR FAMILY TRYING TO GIVE DIRECTION TO A MAN THAT SHOULD HAVE A GPS, SHOULD ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY ATTENTION TO SIMPLE DETAILS, AND HAVE PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE. I'M PISSED THAT THEY DID NOT REFUND MY MONEY. I WONDER HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE CAN RELATE TO ME AND WHAT HAPPENED."}
{"text":"Ordered online,  and recieved a phone call to specify the address including the cross streets. Recieved a call an hour later from a different person who went the opposite direction,  who told me it would be another hour before he would bring me a cold pizza. Explained multiple times to cancel the order then."}
{"text":"We ordered at 1140- they called back 20 minutes after ordering to tell us they didn't have something we ordered. Okay? They said it would be 45- an hour.  An hour goes by- nothing. I called and the girl said the pizza guy left 7 minutes ago. Well we are only 9 minutes away. 30 minutes later still nothing. Come to find out the driver went to another customers house that ordered after us first. By the time we got our food it was cold.  Ive been trying to reach out to the manager for 3 days (which isn't on duty at night) the girl told me a name and it isn't the manager. So at this point I'm waiting to hear back.  Kind of upset how this whole ring around has gone."}
{"text":"Placed an order for a single burger and fries at 5pm, didn't get it until almost 7:30.  Customer service is non existent.  I used to get all my staff to order from here... no more!"}
{"text":"The taste will have you coming back for more. I dont know what people are talking about. The food is good, the service is great and the calzones are huge. Filled with meat sauce and anything you want to throw in. They make your food fast and with love. My favorite pizza spot for a late night meal."}
{"text":"Their food is good, prices reasonable, and offet 24 hour delivery i live in a large complex, and the driver couldnt find me.  An hour and 40 minutes after placing my order  they delivered cold food that went right into the trash.  I work at the jockey club on las vegas blvd.  We give them a lot of referrals, mostly from my department.  There will be no more recommendations now.   Their driver said he was at my door, but could or wouldnt describe my welcome mat.  He laughed at me on the phone, and accused me of costing him 20 bucks in gas.  This is the only delivery that was unable to find me.  Uber and lyft find me.  Tacis find me. But not this snot nosed arrogant excuse for a millenial.  They wont cred it me.  Do NOT give them your business."}
{"text":"Order delivery a lot, they dont take more than an hour to deliver, this place isnt that bad! Their burgers are tasty but super greasy, still good though!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've ever had in my life. Ordered from uber eats and pizza came hot and fresh. A must try is there combo with fries and hot wings. Really satisfied with this place!"}
{"text":"I had like them at first since they deliver pretty far and because their prices weren't that bad. My boyfriend and I had order from them one night ( the lasagna meal for two) and the meal was a 7 1/2 out of 10 for us - the garlic bread arrived soggy but the lasagna was pretty good. We decided to eat there again but dine in this time, no one was there - but there phones were ringing constantly. It's obvious they make their money from people ordering around campus & because they're 24/7. It can't be the food because that night we dine in I had felt nausea; but this is something I deal with almost all they time so I thought it was just me. We were up late once again and decided to go back to Cafe Verdi for the same meal, arrived again no one was there. The phones would NOT stop ringing and I thought it was a good thing for business, I would be happy that it's a busy night. The lady who works there was complaining and so was almost everyone else besides a bald white guy. Our food was brought out, customers actually started coming in to dine in - I cut my meal short and took everything to go because their vibes were killing mine. They were so pissed that the phone wouldn't stop ringing and it was becoming a bummer - I felt as if they were ungrateful. Anyways, late at night my stomach once again started turning and twisting about 20 mins into it I ran into the bathroom and threw up everything I had for the WHOLE day. It was terrible, I knew it was their food AGAIN; my boyfriend felt nausea as well so it wasn't just me. We were disappointed and decided that we will never support Cafe Verdi again. The food was most likely under-cook due to them rushing and having bad attitudes about their jobs; if you hate your job QUIT it. BAD FOOD - BAD SERVICE!  It's also funny because before I wrote this review I read the old ones; and there's one written in 2012 by a man who also had the same meal and went through the same horrid vomiting. I don't know what they are doing over there but I wouldn't go back!"}
{"text":"This place is always hit or miss. Been going here for years and every time service and food is great and other times it sucks. One thing that's consistent is the staff is always rude. One night a group of my friends went to eat here at around 3am after a long night out and were laughing having a good time (not drunk), and the owners sitting at a table by us rudely told us to keep it down. We were the only customers in the restaurant. For the place itself, its nothing special and easy to miss. The food is probably the only thing keeping this place open. Philly cheesesteaks are always good along with the fries. However the last time I had it, the bread was hard. Calzones, pizza and chicken fingers are also a good choice. I've only ordered delivery a couple times and it always takes about an hour to get your food. They do tell you it takes awhile before ordering though. If you come here, don't expect much from the staff and just enjoy the food.  Oh yeah the place has a C for its health rating for as long as I can remember, but I've yet to get food poisoning."}
{"text":"Great and convenient!  Delivery was prompt and friendly! Mozzarella sticks were perfect even with the delivery, burger was delicious and so were the chicken wings. The best part of all, the brownie!!!"}
{"text":"They take FOREVER for delivery, I've been waiting 2hrs and 5 min for a salad and chicken fingers.."}
{"text":"I always get Chicken Wings and a salad... The food quality is ok, I wish they would expand their Wing sauces... Also if they could start serving Gluten-Free Pizzas I would order from there a lot more often!!"}
{"text":"Stopped here the other night for a quick late night dinner to share with my boyfriend. I got the philly cheese steaks with grilled onions, plus tomato and lettuce- which was 6.99 a sandwich. Each was a very light, fluffy, toasted roll filled with lots of cheese plus grilled beef and onions with a few slices of tomato and leaves of romaine. Not an extraordinary sandwich but an easy solution after a late work night. They offer chicken wings, fingers, salads, warm and cold sandwiches, pizza and different pastas. Reminds me of you standard neighborhood pizza joint.   Pro: Open late, if not 24 hours! Yay for people who work late for me having yet another option for food.  Con: Food seems overpriced for what it is. Not a sit-down restaurant,  the decor is more suited to waiting for a quick pizza to go.   Once I try the pizza I'll give it a more in depth review, but so far I'm not planning a return trip any time soon. It filled my belly but wasn't crave worthy for me."}
{"text":"I found this place through EAT24. an easy online ordering app. I ordered for delivery. I waited over an hour and a half for my food to be delivered. When the subpar food finally arrived it was ice cold. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"We ordered 73.00$ of dinner after driving 800 miles to get here. We got 2 chicken alfredo they were absolutely tasteless. Horrible! Tasted like old creamer and chewy chicken. The only good thing was they said they would refund the price of the 2 alfredos but haven't seen it yet! We will see!"}
{"text":"Had the worst service ever in my life. Ordered a spinach pizza and waited over two hours before they delivered. Called to see if we could get a discount and the guy never apologized and didn't offer any discount. Then we open the pizza and it's ice cold plus it was the wrong pizza, it was a buffalo chicken pizza instead. Called back again and talked apparently to a manager and he said he would send us a free pizza in 45 minutes which turned into another hour. We are regulars but we will never order from this location again, they just lost a loyal customer. This is completely ridiculous be careful when you order from this place it was 5am before we got free pizza."}
{"text":"Ordered for the first time and got a small verdi special supreme. Estimated time said 60 minutes and they showed up within 30. I wasnt disappointed. Really tasty  great prices and i love that they are open so late even on weekdays. I'll definitely be ordering from here in the future"}
{"text":"Closed down by the health department on 3-13-16 with 42 demerits and an imminent health hazard. Severe infestation. Enough said....what a dump."}
{"text":"We ordered a pizza at 12 noon and showed up at the house 1.5 hrs later, pizza was cold so I sent it back.  When I tried to talk to the manager a very rude female would not give me her name and said that it would take about 45 min to an hour.  She refused to give me any information on the manager saying that his name was private information.  Their only remedy was to give me 20% off and remake the pizza and redelivered.  I would never tell anyone to eat here and will tell all my vet buddies and associates to never order their pizza.  I hope the manager or owner sees this post and contacts me.  Navy.dav91@gmail.com"}
{"text":"Such an excellent little place! Quaint little restaurant, delicious food. The pizza crust is thin and the perfect amount of crunch, and just right in texture in regards to cheese and sauce ratio. Their Greek salad with the balsamic dressing is fresh and tastey. Highly recommend. Really FRESH food. The staff was more than accommodating!"}
{"text":"I love the Verdi Special pizza and their wings & fingers are pretty good too! Great sandwiches or better just said a notch above your average pizza & wings spot. I'm just not happy with their prices!Yes it's slightly above average but you can't even purchase a half bucket or whole bucket its order per order , so for 10 chicken fingers I just paid $18.99!!! That's outrageous! Too much for take out these are OutBack steak house prices for wings! Sorry I love Cafe Verdi's but we would probably be more frequent customers if you weren't soooo high!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to order because of all the bad reviews but I wanted a Philly cheesesteak at 9 am so I tried it lol. Order came on time (hour) and when I went back into my house I noticed my drink was missing. It wasn't a big deal, but 10 mins later the driver came back with it without me asking so that was nice. Cheese steak was really good, lots of meat! Jalapeño poppers were good as well. I'll order again."}
{"text":"Pizza is awsome here..... I usually get jalapenos and sausage on my pizza... the wings are a little dry"}
{"text":"New restaurant opened in Henderson, decided to give it a try since the one on Maryland Parkway in Vegas has great food. I ordered for delivery. I was told it would be an hour. After a couple calls and 2 1/2 hours later the food arrived, cold pizza and wings, and warm soda! Not even a comp offered. Driver gets here and says this is wrong, I'm going to have the manager call you, and guess what?? You guessed it! No call!! Hey!! I work hard for my money and I am not going to spend it on cold food and incompetent people thank you very much!!! Awful service!!"}
{"text":"I have pretty bad jetleg and cafe Verdi saved me. The food is very delicious and delivered in 30 munites... strongly recommend to late hours"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery, a small pizza and a piece of cake. It took an hour to receive my order and the pizza was barely warm. Also the chocolate cake was very hard I took one bite and had to throw it away."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. I literally live across the street and my food arrived 45 minutes late, cold and burnt. I'm beyond disappointed."}
{"text":"Last night, I ordered from here for delivery for the first time. I ordered spaghetti and meatballs. So, that, with a canned drink, garlic bread, $2.50 delivery charge, and $2.00 tip, cost me $16.30. What I got was a 9\" metal tin with about a package of unseasoned, barely sauced pasta, accompanied by 4 meatballs a little larger than a golfball. To say I was upset wouldn't cover it. I just sat there, feeling completely ripped off. I can't recommend this place, at 10 pm, at least, nor will I give them a 2nd chance. How that was allowed to leave their business and delivered to a paying customer with a straight face was all the info I needed."}
{"text":"The food here is just Amazing! The quality of food is just insane for the low price paid. The wings are massive and oh so delicious. The pizza has the best crust and sauce I've had. And the Calzones are so tasteful. Very impressed, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delivery took forever, popcorn shrimp was awful, fries were good though....won't be back."}
{"text":"This place was horrible. Food took an hour and a half to get here. Pizza was cold. Most of my order was not delivered. Called the restaurant and staff was rude and hung up in me. Got the rest of my order half an hour later and hot sauce for my wings was still missing. Horrible place. Never order from them..I never will again"}
{"text":"Called in a order to get a custom calzone. They did it no problem. Stan didn't charge me much at all for adding provolone cheese. Note to readers of this, their strombolli and calzones are made the same way, only different filling combinations is all. They both use mozzarella cheese instead of the calzone with ricotta. Had a slice of really good cheese cake, you can tell how fresh it is by the crust being a bit crumbly. All in all really good quality ingredients, preparation, and delivery-showed up just barely able to eat hot. Will be going back again for sure."}
{"text":"2 1/2 hours to deliver burnt cold food. Just ordered a calzone, uploaded the photo shocked that any cook could let this be served to people. Definitely NOT ordering from them again. Quality has gotten way worse than it used to be."}
{"text":"Horrible service!!! I came in for a pick up and the cashier just stayed looking at me while having a full conversation on the phone and not one time asked to help me with anything."}
{"text":"Update: the delivery guy finally showed after two and a half hours. Ready for the kicker? He knocks on my hotel room door repeatedly at 2am....I ignore it because uhhh it's 2 am in Vegas and I already cancelled it....then he CALLS my room another 3 times."}
{"text":"This place seems to get some critical reviews mostly complaining about delivery times. I've ordered from here twice and it's arrived sooner than quoted and the food was good and hot. Their pizza crust is good, which is hard to come by in Vegas for some reason."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! Best 24 hour pizza this side of the Grand Canyon.  Plus if you're a guest in a hotel they bring you paper plates and napkins, heard dat."}
{"text":"This is the first and only negative review.  We used to order here at least twice a week, because the food was good and the 24/7 delivery is a great convenience.  When one of our credit cards showed \"irregular activity\", my wife and I realized that Cafe Verdi was the main place we used the card. When the replacement card arrived, we used it only at Cafe Verdi. A couple of months later, we had the same irregular activity again. So, we decided to go elsewhere.  Just don't use your credit card at this establishment."}
{"text":"I haven't even tasted my food yet but these fools are rude as hell. Never ordered from this particular spot before, but I use grub hub all the time so I'm kind of used to quickly picking and going to checkout, them already having my address & whatnot.   I'll own up to my mistake of not double checking when I submitted my order to say delivery instead of pickup. I'll also own up to me not checking that they had my address on the order or for not having my iPhone next to me when they called to correct the issue.   But the way whoever that impatient ass buffoon working the phone talks to a customer it's quite unprofessional. I asked a simple question in the calmest sweetest voice that I could muster up. I mean, how mad can I really be? I don't feel like cooking so I might as well make whoever does feel like doing it for me a little less perplexed.   I asked the asshole on the phone if it was cold and I can only assume that he felt attacked because his tone became accusatory and defensive as if I were some pest.  I get it I work in the food industry as well, but if you can't handle a mishap with grace or do something as simple as disguise your tone of voice, maybe you shouldn't be working the phones. Or in a restaurant at all."}
{"text":"The food here is good. Really good actually. The pizza, the chicken fingers, the fried mushrooms, all delicious. The Mediterranean food also very very good. Falafels, kebabs, hummus and salads all  tasty. Especially the baba ganoush. Best baba ganoush I've ever had actually.  The problem with this place is the service. Especially with delivery. Never had an issue with take out. The guys that take the order are not the nicest or most polite or courteous but with take out you get your good food fairly quickly. Delivery though, Fugetaboutit! Always something wrong or missing and by the time the food arrives you've passed out from the hunger! This last time we were missing an order of pita bread, a salad and a lentil soup. (Wasn't charged for the soup)  Will I order take out again? Absolutely! If and when I'm ever in the neighborhood. Would I order delivery again. Nope. Not happening."}
{"text":"Great place The pizza here is delicious I love ordering Italian food from this place!"}
{"text":"My wife and i thought we'd give a local pizza place a try. Bad move! After being talked to like I was an inconvenience to this guys night.. 1 1/2 hours later we call back wondering where our food was. Come to find out the guy who took our order did NOT write down my credit card info correctly and didn't bother to call as well because when the manager repeated my phone number back to me... It was correct.   I have one word for Cafe Verdi... incompetent."}
{"text":"Ok so I was hungry at night when most restaurants are closed I found Cafe Verdi and let me tell you... The pizza is soo delicious and flavorful! I will order from them again . Keep in mind that they are usually very busy so the food takes a wile to get there but it's well worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome place for late nite delivery . I order online two 16\" pizzas and received one for free. Food was delivered really fast . Pizzas was hot and fresh. Definitely will use this service again in future ."}
{"text":"The nastiest, greasiest pizza I have ever ordered in my entire 44 years. The pizza could not even be picked up because it was in a giant puddle of grease. I am disgusted. The crust was soggy and fell apart immediately."}
{"text":"How many different ways can you say terrible? Pizza super greasy and undercooked...chicken parm is horrible...not sure if that is even actually chicken. I would rather eat a tv dinner. Better be nice and drunk if you are going to give this place a shot.  So..I tried the \"new\" location.... delivery. Still no good....sub-par pizza just as I remember. Oh well...what can ya do?"}
{"text":"All I can say is, wow. From the texture to the flavor, the food was absolutely terrible. Being my first yelp review ever - I must share how terribly gross and unsatisfyjng this meal was. The Philly cheesesteak was drier than the Nevada desert. Let's not even talk about how miserable the hummus was. And, also, the rice bread pudding was not prepared as described or pictured. If you want unflavorful food and soggy French fries, this is the place to go. Cheers"}
{"text":"Ordered a cheese pizza, waited about 2 hours. Pizza was already cold. The pizza itself was ok, a little salty. Apparently they were busy, delivery man was apologetic and asked if I still wanted my pizza."}
{"text":"Quality pies. You have to love that they are opened 24/7 and that they deliver at all hours too. The food has always been on time and hot. I do wish they offered a Mexican pizza. Maybe someday they will"}
{"text":"Value, food and service all great. Missing ambience, TV for sport games would be great."}
{"text":"absolutely horrible. I ordered a chicken quesadilla with extra sour creme and salsa. it took over 70 minutes for my food to arrive. I called to see where my food was and they kept hanging up on me. when my food did finally arrive it came with not sour creme and salsa but instead buffalo sauce and no chicken in the quesadilla. when I called to complain about that they man on the phone was really rude and made the excuse that they are a pizza shop so they don't have sour creme or salsa even though the other cafe Verdes here carry it. also the quesadilla is really soggy not crisp almost like they used the microwave to cook it. I really wish yelp had a negative star option so I could give these jokers negative 50 stars"}
{"text":"Avoid! The owner and management are the reasons for the bad ratings.   The yelp responses from the manager say it all. He won't respond to my concern and happily ignores all complaining guests but pointlessly responds to 5 start reviews? Lol not smart at all!  I ordered dozens of times, had a problem once, was nice and just wanted a little discount on my next order. Waited and I finally spoke to the manager and was blown away. The management or owner was so pathetic and rude the way you handled it. Literally didn't care or even try to listen to my concern at all. Waited over 2 hours for cold food and got no credit!!???  If they just would of tried I'd of likely ordered again but they'll never see me again!  Yelp and Nevada should shut this place down for stealing from hundreds if not thousands of people. For every bad review on here there are 20 more losing there money."}
{"text":"Such good pizza, and i loooooooove pizza c:  1 problem which docked off 1 star, we ordered the specialty deal with 1 pizza with 2 toppings, choice of chicken tenders or wings (we got tenders) fries, and a 2 liter. Our pizza barely had any of the 2nd topping which made us have to deal with an all Olive pizza with only a tiny bit of bacon. We aren't cry babies though that like to complain and leave 1 star for something so minor. We do sure hope that next time we will have an even amount of bacon with our olive pizza though. Besides that, the chicken tenders were extremely quality, tasted really good, fries are the bomb diggity, they gave 2 cups of ranch, there we napkins in the bag, and a lot of ketchup packets which made me happy (: and although the pizza lacked the 2nd topping, it was still good pizza! We order through Uber Eats during late night hours and the food always gets here in a timely fashion, so all the people that have bad experiences due to delivery should really use their brain and use a different method of delivery cause Uber Eats always works very well. Anyways, I hope this place stays open and doesn't get too much affected by the cheap losers that demand compensation, cause for a place thats open 24 hours, has many different delivery options, and there's a lot of good food, you can't beat it! Definitely a fan!! :D"}
{"text":"Are you freakin' kidding me ? They advertised to La Quinta Inn & Suites Las Vegas Airport N Convention -- their flyer was the first thing I saw when I opened the door. 24 hours? Sure, why not. I'm starving after coming back from a convention event at 830pm tonight. Called, ordered an $8.99 Tuna Sandwich with $1 fries. I had to call them back because the total I was quoted didn't initially make sense to me. $13.80. Guy I spoke to said it was because of tax and delivery fee. Okay, sure. So delivery guy comes to the lobby of the hotel, I hand him a $20, expecting $6 back because he quoted me an EVEN $14 instead of $13.80. He asked how much I wanted back, I said $6. He gave me back $2. So technically, he claimed his own TIP as $4. At least GIVE ME the freakin' chance to figure out tip for myself. $18 for a tuna sandwich with bread I didn't even want, and fries where as I bit into the first piece, grease dripped from my lips down to my chin. And I'm still hungry because I refuse to force myself to eat crap, even for 18 bucks. Come on!"}
{"text":"Love Cafe Verdi! Very convenient and close to Anthem. The staff is attentive and friendly. They are very flexible with menu items and are willing to customize orders."}
{"text":"The service and food were both mediocre that's why I'm only giving this place 3 stars! Ran by a bunch of old sweaty Italian men!"}
{"text":"1:30 a.m.....3 people starving with not a 24/7 McDonald's around....We have been getting these menus from Cafe Verdi at our door for quite some time but I was reluctant...However, with 2 hungry men and not wanting to cook, I decided to order from Cafe Verdi on Maryland Parkway.  First, I'll comment on the telephone service....The gentleman who answered the phone was VERY personable and friendly.  He did not have any problems understanding what I wanted to order.  He placed me \"briefly\" on hold..and I don't mean for more than a minute, maybe,I would assume to verify that they delivered to our little corner of the world.  After confirming, he asked what I wanted and I proceeded to place the following order:  1-Double Bacon Cheeseburger, well done...he replied that well done is \"standard\"..which is a good thing...We don't like under cooked hamburger....2. Cheese steak with grilled onions (no special ordering instructions) and a Triple Decker BLT without the \"T\"..(don't like tomatoes)  He quickly took the order and gave me my total..which I found to actually be reasonable considering the hour and the food we ordered...and explained it would be about an hour...O.k...No problem....Waiting is not a problem....We expected the food around 2:30 a.m.....imagine my surprise when not 35 minutes later, there was the delivery man...just a little behind my husband who had just arrived home after a very long long day at work..so..as far as delivery time, they Excelled...arriving well ahead of the stated time...Now as far as the food.....My brother in law got the Double Bacon Cheeseburger....well done exactly as he wanted and he Raved about it....Said it was something he would \"Definitely\" order again....My husband got the Cheese steak with grilled onions....It didn't look to be anything out of the ordinary...but my husband said he \"would\" order it again....so far so good...Now my Triple Decker BLT Club...no tomatoes....It was a \"standard\" club sandwich....3 slices of bread....bacon/lettuce/mayo on white bread....Mayo was just fine...lettuce was fresh...My ONLY complaint on this sandwich was that the bacon was VERY under cooked....to the point where I was afraid to eat most of it......I don't like under cooked anything, especially meat....so that was not a high point for my \"dinner\".....If I were to order it again I would emphasize Well-done/Crispy bacon....another thing about the order....for the price, a few fries with the sandwiches would have been a nice thing...although I understand that the \"lunch specials\" do come with fries and a soda.....All in all, I'd say....Not bad...Not great..but not so bad that we won't order again...Next time I'm trying the pasta...(manicotti/stuffed shells or ravioli)....After the next order I WILL update...Thanks for reading....Have a wonderful day!"}
{"text":"- Placed my order via Grub Hub at 10:15pm.  - Received confirmation it would arrive at 11:15-11:30 (long wait time for a Tuesday night, for a sandwich) - By 11:45 started calling - Voicemail recording said the In Box had never been set up. - Grub Hub called and they said driver almost here. - Never showed up.  - Going to bed hungry tonight. Thanks, Cafe Verdi!"}
{"text":"I don't know who the driver was but he was an older gentleman. He gave me a humbling feeling that he was delivering for his family.  He was very sweet and I know I'm 33..... but when I looked at him my eyes lit up and In my Head I said ( Santa)  you just know. ( loss of words)"}
{"text":"This is by far the WORST customer service and On top of that my order was late by an HOUR and one of their customer service representatives was so rude to me saying they will respond to my yelp review saying I was a bitch??uhhhhh why??\" Oh that's right bc they are crazy and never make it right with their customers.. Stay away from these people!! They will tell you what you wanna hear and they are full of it.. Just saying stay AWAY! And also I've had their food.... So standard and really gross do yourself a favor and order Thai food from a better place"}
{"text":"Best place in Vegas for pizza when you've been drinking.  Eat24 delivery is a big plus, too."}
{"text":"Did an order last night...not only did it take 2 hours for the delivery, the delivery guy forgot our pizza that was apart of our order. Called and they said they will comp us a larger pizza for the next time. Which was ok for us. Once we started eating our food we were even more disappointed. The good was stone cold and stale. Tonight we thought we would just use the free pizza comp and the pizza is charred and burned to a crisp. We will never eat here again"}
{"text":"First timer; ordered off Grubhub. I figured since it was on the list to deliver to me it would be close. I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, which comes with fries and a pickle, and I also ordered chicken fingers. It estimated delivery about 45 minutes to 1 hour later, standard delivery estimates. When an hour came and still no food, I realized I should check this place on my map. It was a 20 min drive away and there was construction in between in a lot of areas, oops. (I recommend checking traffic before ordering delivery.) So I was expecting my food to be in really poor condition especially with all these negative comments.  I'm not gonna lie, when I got my food it smelt terrible. I'm pretty sure that's because of the hot pickle.. Naturally the fries were soggy, so I was worried my burger would be too. First I took of my wilted lettuce, then I took a bite. It was amazing! Maybe because I was starving, maybe because I was expecting it to be soggy and sickening, but it was wonderfully crispy and the flavors were really great! Then I checked the chicken fingers, I was also expecting them to be soggy like the fries were, and yet again I was happily surprised! The weren't soggy at all, in fact they were perfectly crispy. All in all, my mistake in ordering delivery from a 24-hour, delivers anywhere, food establishment, was not as much of a mistake as I thought it could be.."}
{"text":"Well, this is one of the hundreds of mediocre pizza places cluttering up the Las Vegas foodscape.  I hate to be so negative but quite honestly the pizza here is worse than Little Caesar's AND you pay through the nose for it.  I have sampled their pizza twice now and both times it has been pretty awful.  They offer a huge 24\" pizza, which is great for sharing, but unfortunately it tastes like the box it comes in.  They don't seem to use quality ingredients and they are very stingy with the cheese - even on a cheese pizza!  For $20 there are much better ways to feed a group... Oh, and the menu says they are open 24/7, even on holidays.  However, when I called at 9am they answered after 3 tries and said they were closed til 10.  So who knows?  All I know is I won't order from them again."}
{"text":"They delivered at 4AM on a Wednesday night, solid.   I got the buffalo chicken pizza with onion and bacon, but ordered it without the ricotta. Not a big ricotta fan :) My friend got a massive philly cheesesteak that looked delightful.  Not the best quality, but definitely passable for late night food. Decent menu, will probably try a sandwich next time. Decent prices, just a perfectly par place. You see that alliteration? I'm a goddamn poet."}
{"text":"So on 7/22/2014 (hope the owner sees this) around 11:45 pm i called and asked if they are delivering... I was asked \"where\"? I said las vegas they said \"FUCK YOU\" and hung up before i could give a full address...  So i called back and asked for management.. they said \"FUCK YOU\"... that i was an idiot and there is no manager... So i said look i am a paying customer and i would be there in the am to talk to an owner ..,.  The \"Employee\" says he will fuck me up and that i am a \"FAGGOT\"  Amazing place... NEVER ORDER HERE.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have to disagree with everyone else about this place. I called to order a plain cheese pizza for delivery, the guy who took my order told me my pizza will be delivered in 45mins. So I waited and waited, waited some more. As I seen the time has gone by it's been 1 hour and my food isn't still here. So I called them to see where has my pizza taken place at! They said it's on it's way. So I waited again til finally after waiting for almost 2 hours for a pizza delivery I finally got my pizza. And it was cold. The chocolate eclair they gave me was old. I was very disappointed. So I DO NOT recommend ANYONE to order from this place. They Suck at delivery."}
{"text":"made an order tonight not very hard to complete just wings and a gyro and its been way over an hour and order is still waiting for a driver to pick up this is ridiculous. each time i call to find out whats going on, the answer from the employee  is non--caring !!! go eat somewhere else!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for mom and pop restaurants and randomly came across this little gem. They have a large variety menu to choose from with all fresh ingredients. I was very impressed with how quick and friendly their service was. The pizza and wings were delicious and I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"the pizza was good for late night food but the delivery took forever."}
{"text":"Over 2 hours for 1 piece of cheese cake, 1 piece of chocolate cake, and 1 can of orange soda.  The wait is normally long but I normally order around dinner time but for stuff they don't even have to cook that is just plain lazy.  That and the guy at the restaurant with an I don't care about it attitude makes this the last time I will ever order from here.  Don't ever order from here."}
{"text":"This place has some of the best Afghan food I've ever had, very authentic. Cheese pizza was dope as well, can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Chicken Alfredo for delivery. The noodles were overcooked and the sauce was watery and bland. The garlic bread was good, but overall it was a waste of money. I won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Great food may need to tell them well done if you like things crispier. Staff is small so your quality food takes a couple minutes later. Place your order before you get there to help."}
{"text":"Do not order here unless you want your food to be late, cold, tasteless, and missing items! If I could give zero stars, I would not hesitate to do so. My order: Chicken & Waffles with bleu cheese and buffalo sauce on the side, one Chocolate Eclaire, and two slices of Tiramisu. Chicken: Barely warm at all, hard, overcooked, tasteless, and under-seasoned. Waffles: Overly sweet, really small, and cold to the touch, as if they had been in the cooler. Soggy to boot. Lucky I just got a toaster that is big enough for waffles. My old one wasn't. Chocolate Eclaire: Was upside-down in the box, so all the chocolate stuck to the styrofoam. So now my Chocolate Eclaire is just an eclaire. Filling is not pastry creme but some weird, whipped, sickly sweet, artificially colored mess. Sauces: Bleu Cheese was just Ranch with tiny bits of mystery cheese in it. Buffalo sauce was missing entirely, so I had to make my own. Tiramisu: Tasty enough but definitely not authentic. Not made fresh but purchased elsewhere, I know because several other restaurants in the area sell the same mediocre tiramisu, plus it was still frozen in the middle. Delivery: Driver was polite enough but obviously hot and tired, which I felt bad about. Give him a break, guys. Food was twenty minutes late even after the confirmation time was 45 minutes longer than the GrubHub app-estimated time. All in all I am extremely disappointed with my order. I don't know if I am just expecting too much from working at an actually GOOD restaurant but this certainly does not fit the bill. I will never EVER order from here again and I will tell my friends to steer clear as well!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to find such awesome middle eastern cuisine in China Town. As you can see we ordered two dinners, we were very full but I wanted to eat more. I will be back for sure..."}
{"text":"Excellent customer and I'm from the restaurant business my self staff was very friendly Ms. Lou is great she helped every step of the way. That calzone was awesome and very filling."}
{"text":"No one here speaks English enough to hold a rational conversation or take an order. The delivery person was only capable of saying \" Copy \" and \" Manager \". I signed the credit card slip but he kept yelling \" COPY!\" at me. When he tried to push my door open and come into my apartment I yelled until he stepped out and shut my door . When I called the manager she denied it happened, and called me a racist and gave me a lecture about how Abraham Lincoln welcomed immigrants. I'm a racist because I can't understand a person who can not speak enough English to deliver a pizza? Pizza is pizza, I can order from somewhere else next time where there are no acts of trespassing nor accusations of racism."}
{"text":"I had to come to the front of hard rock to get my food. The brownie was average to bad and the lasagna was bland with barely any ricotta cheese. I asked for Parmesan and red pepper and I got a packet of each. Wasn't worth ordering except they do have bottled water and I needed that lol. Don't waste your money. I'd rather have not given into my lasagna craving."}
{"text":"Legendary cheese pizza delivery nom nom nom nom. Excellent hangover cure. And excellent pre-party munchie. It's all about their cheese.  2 pizzas w/ 2 toppings, and a liter of Pepsi straight to our hotel door under 40 min = $31. Delivered by legit Italian pizza mafia.  You gotta try their cheese!"}

{"text":"Pizza: The Pizza there is cheap and well made. Taste like they actually do it by hand and not already prepared in a box.  Subs: Meh I had bettter sandwiches  Calzones: If you stumble into this resaurant you have to try the calzone. It is so good youll want to have sex with it unproteced. Just make sure it is made by \"Carlos\" the mexican cook. He knows his way around the kitchen. Avoid going to eat during the weekends and a full moon.  Service: The service there is lacking but nothing Mitchell the cashier cant fix. Mitchell the cashier is a busty, blonde babe who gives you spontaneouse orgasm as you undress her with your eyes. Youll want to eat of her naked body, motor boat her boobies, and slap that ass goodbye when your done licking the tomatoe sauce of her cooch. Oh and the service needs some work to be done."}
{"text":"I've never dined in, but I order late night delivery eats from here constantly. I've recently ran out of menus to call or order by so lately I haven't been calling. Oh...how I've missed your pizza Cafe Verdi!   I love pizza! But, don't get me wrong, I am no pizza pro. However, if pizza tastes good, then so far, it's done the job! The taste of their pizza is just sssooo different from the franchised pizza places. It has that great soft herbal taste that goes with the pizza which makes it taste a lot lighter, and little less saltier than most pizza's I've tasted.  I usually love to get their Cheesy Garlic bread for $2.99. I mean seriously! Who doesn't love cheesy bread! Cheesy bread brings out the daring side of a person you know...I also get the 10 inch Hawaiian or the 10 inch BBQ chicken pizza, oh! and the white pizza for $9.99. It's just heaven!   They are also 24 hours, 7 days a week, including holidays, so it's even better. If you're just tired of the same old $3.99 steak and eggs after a fun night on the strip, this would be another good alternative joint, that's anything besides breakfast."}
{"text":"The owner who drives a grey challenger is not the brightest crayon in the box. After rudely telling me he was checking his call log in order see how long it had taken my hubby to come down to the lobby and retrieve our food, which by the way there's a delivery charge so why the hell it matters how long they wait. Why the hell the owner is the delivery driver? I will not even go there. We ordered $31 of just two salads, yes and specifically asked for utensils and extra dressing. You guessed it got none of the above. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM! The owner is a diabolical joke. Rude as all hell too!!! I would give zero stars if I could!!!"}
{"text":"Simple: David is awesome. We buy pizza from him on Mondays and they are great every time. Great pizza for a great price! We hope to cater from him down the road."}

The person who answered barely spoke english and when i asked if they delivered he (rudely!) told me it would take an hour minimum - not even knowing what i was ordering or where it was to be delivered. I said forget it and hung up. Bad customer service = no service."}

New York Crust 2.) Balanced  Sauce neither sweet or salty  and 3.) Plenty of Cheese, The interior was nice with old school retro pics on the wall and comforting place to eat  and had  and Service was very nice walked by our table a couple of times making sure we were taken care of.Overall very nice place to eat.Enjoyed ;)"}
{"text":"This place just plain sucks I don't have anything good to say about this place besides that it's open 24 hours and the guy I had to deal with was a huge PRICK! Just wait to eat the next morning or make a microwave meal this place I ain't worth it!  If anyone ever suggest microwave food over a restaurant you know you should stay away."}
{"text":"Ordered here for deliver. Boyfriend said he was on Yelp for hours trying to find something to eat because he didn't want to drive lol  Took about half an hour for food to get delivered. Ordered a small pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms and small fries with extra ketchup. I opened the box and the pizza looked great. As in, looked delicious right from the box! French fries looked really good too. It was crispy but he preferred it to be more crispy.  The pizza in my opinion was really good. Boyfriend thought it sucked. But this is coming from a guy who prefers Pizza Hut over a classy, real pizzeria where they hand toss it in front of you.   Didn't rate 5 stars because, it didn't absolutely blow my mind but was pretty good that I'd go back. Probably try the wings, a salad or one of their pastas next time. Or a margherita pizza cuz that's one of my faves!"}
{"text":"Tried ordering from Cafe Verdi as they have a late night delivery service!, after waiting for 2 hours  at 2 am I get a call from them explaining that they won't deliver to Westgate because security here will have their drivers arrested for trespassing. When I tried to negotiate a different place to meet off property nearby he hung up on me,  and when I called back he gave a string of excuses and told me I was on my own. Basically he told me to go screw off.  I had ordered near $100 of food, had to resort to the sport book deli where my family ate expensive junk food."}
{"text":"I just wanted to say that after reading the less than stellar reviews on here, I wasn't going to order from this place. However, at 3AM hunger, laziness and desperation were setting in so I figured I'd give it a try. I've made 2 more orders since then and I figure 3 orders is enough experience with a place to write them a fair review.   For late night food with free delivery I say this place is great. My order has always arrived within the specified time frame and the last time I ordered food arrived way earlier than expected,  nothing has been screwed up and it's pretty decent food too. I don't know what to say about the service because I don't expect much in the way of customer service from a pizza place. As long as my food gets here, it's warm and they are not assholes then I consider that good enough for me.   So maybe I've gotten lucky with this place. I guess I'll find out because I'll continue to order from them and recommend them to anyone who likes decent pizza late at night."}
{"text":"Okay so...... where to begin. We ordered delivery tonight and we'll.... kind of confused. The pizza? DELICIOUS. That being said. Ordered the deal, 15 wings, 6 fingers, two liter. The only thing that was 100% correct on the order was the soda. Their olives say (black and green). We only got black. The wings we ordered hot, came plain, ordered the fingers with parm and garlic, got 15 plain chicken wings. Yeah, we got x2 orders of 15 plain wings instead of wings and fingers. No hot or garlic parm sauce on the side, got 6 ranches. This review would  be zero stars if possible EXCEPT the pizza was very good, despite the lack or proper toppings. Not sure I'd ever order delivery from here again. Would have to babysit the dense cook and QA. Decent food, slightly obtuse workers. Also here's my receipt."}
{"text":"So I'm working at the World Series of Poker, and around 1am a delivery guy walks in with two huge pizzas for a poker player. We find him and help him setup a table for his pizzas, and then all hell breaks loose. All the other poker players see the pizza and come over to get a slice, assuming it's fair game. Poor guy that ordered the pizzas, fighting off all of these moochers.  The guy offered me a slice, and I felt bad, but it was 1am and I can't turn down a greasy slice of pizza. Greasy slice of pizza is an understatement, cuz this thing was DRIPPING with greese. But I took a square, and as soon as I bit in to it I was like WOW. Now don't get me wrong, this isn't a place I'd be ordering from if I was ever craving pizza. I like healthier pizzas with more toppings. I don't know if this place puts sugar in their dough or what, but the flavor was great, and all I can say is this is a great shitty slice of pizza. Don't know if my experience could be duplicated, and I'm afraid to try, but that piece hit the spot. Now excuse me while my heart explodes..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The cook during lunch is always on point with getting the orders right. The front of house staff can be hit or miss with good service depending who's working. I order here for my work about 2-3 times a month and almost never have in issue with the food. The owner is a friendly person who I often see helping is staff and keeping the ball rolling. Thanks again!"}
{"text":"After reading so many lackluster reviews, I was really hesitant on ordering here. But I pulled the trigger and went with it. I'm glad I did. They were extremely quick and it wasn't even an hour wait. The food was great. I'm a pizza guy and I like trying new pies and this place is very good.  You get A LOT of food for the money. The delivery surcharges suck and add up quick (especially with tip), but you can order this food the day you come in and eat on it all week.  I wasn't impressed with the french fries. The pizza, wings and chicken fingers were awesome. The pizza (pepp and sausage) was really solid and no complaints. Hot wings weren't really hot, but tasty. Sweet Chili chicken fingers were just that and delicious. They have really good ranch dressing, too!  Give them a try! Food - 7/10 Delivery - 9/10 Price - 8/10"}
{"text":"Terrible service, weren't willing to deliver properly. Asked for delivery to our room and were denied."}
{"text":"The pizza was good. But the service...  I passed this place and saw an inviting sign on the window that read: \"Anytime Special.  Any 2 Slices & a Drink, $5.\"   Just what I needed!  I was greeted by a short blonde woman who needed to check if they still had slices. I understand, it was 3.40PM.  Sometimes slices are only available at meal times.  Her - Me  \"Yes, we have slice's.\" - \"Awesome!\" \"Pepperoni or cheese?\" - \"Actually, I'd like pepperoni and mushroom with extra sauce\" \"We can't do that.\" - \"Really?  You don't have mushrooms or sauce?\" \"We do, but the pepperoni and cheese slices are already made.\" - \"ok, can you just add it before you throw the slices in the oven?\" \"No\" - \"Really?  That's how lots of pizza by the slice places work...\" \"Ok, we'll add it.\" - \"great, thanks!\" \"Your total is $6.\" - \"But the sign says $5 for any 2 slices, including a drink?\" \"I have to charge you for the extra toppings.\" - \"But the sign says?\" \"The sign is incorrect, we're in litigation with the sign vendor now.\" - \"Ok, well can you honor the current offer?  Seems like you should, that's the whole reason I came in...\" ::Lots of sighing and grunting:: \"Ok, $5.50.\" - \"Thanks!\"  There was no mention of my drink.  Fortunately I didn't need one.  Like I said, decent pizza, but this confrontation was appalling."}
{"text":"Delivery took 2+ hours, but magically arrived minutes after calling the restarunt. I ordered the Boyd, it was missing the veggies & au jus - I've had better sandwiches from grocery stores. The fried mushrooms were disgusting."}
{"text":"Hopefully I'll be updating this review after another try. We ordered about 5 different menu items around 11pm, the food arrived quickly, but it was not surprisingly below par. The lasagna was literally like a marinara sauce soup, in which I had trouble finding actual pasta or meat. The bread was pretty stale and plain, the pizza was very average to below average, and the wings were decent at best.   Honestly, I'd still recommend this for late night based purely on it being food and having delivery available."}
{"text":"I generally order from this place because it's so close to my house. The pizzas are good but anything else is pretty gross. Most things taste like they are reheated after being freezer burned. I ordered a pizza last night to be delivered and it never showed up, however, I was charged for it. So I paid for nothing. I will no longer be ordering from this business."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! It was great for our pizza Friday! Can't wait for future pizza. Pepperoni pineapple was my favorite."}
{"text":"when you're too lazy to go out and get food after a long night of drinking and partying, this is your place! pizza was bomb and they didn't take long delivering the food either."}
{"text":"The few times I've ordered I've had to wait over an hour and a half, the last order took 2 hours!! I waited 2 hours for luke-warm mediocre food. Needless to say I'm not happy and will not be ordering again. There are so many other places that have better food."}
{"text":"Me and my entire family got food poisoning off a cheese pizza here. Do yourself a favor and go hungry tonight, it's not worth it."}
{"text":"UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT! Food is fantastic and reasonably priced! I live close, so I can't speak about delivery, but the pizza sauce is so GOOD! Their \"feta cheese\" pizza was out of this world! Chicken fingers and the baked specialties (lasagna, etc) can't be beat! I found this restaurant because Napoli Pizza prices have gone crazy!! ... like $17 for baked ziti??? Forget it!!  Give these guys a try - the food won't disappoint!! Dine-in, pick-up, or delivery."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered food from here earlier tonight and over an hour later it still hadn't arrived so we called the store and the female manager told us the driver was on the way and the food would be cold. It finally got here but the food was cold so we figured out she lied to us. We called again and she told us she would send us new food, no problem. But then we waited almost another hour so we called once again asking where the food was and she replied with \"oh, I forgot to have them make it\" so she lied again. We then asked for a refund but she told us she would need to send a driver to collect the food in order to give us a refund. We ate the food because we were starving, we had been waiting on this for almost 3 hours. So my boyfriend called one more time asking for a refund and the same female manager told him the refund will take 3 business days and then started yelling at him when he told her he would go to the bank for the refund instead. When he was hanging up I heard her call him a \"fucking dickhead.\" I tried calling back over 10 times but she ignored every one of my calls. Food was disgusting, bullshit service, and if the bitch is reading this you have my number and my address so you can pull up."}
{"text":"My wife turned to me at 2am and said she was hungry. Luckily, my trusty Eat 24 app let me know what in the area was a 24 hour delivery service, because I had no desire to get out of bed to get her food. I'm on vacation and she's not pregnant. I love her, but no.  We ordered the double Philly with everything, garlic fries and jalapeño poppers. Asked for ranch (not listed as a condiment in the app, you have to ask for it in the special instructions) and they delivered. Poppers weren't anything to rave about, just the usual. The garlic fries? I LOVED them. **Warning** if you don't enjoy a STRONG garlic taste and stank breath at 3am, don't order these. If you're a rebel and feel like making your significant other kiss your stank breath mouth before bed (toothpaste doesn't kill it) then balls to the walls! Do it!  But the glory of the whole meal? That Philly. So, so good. And SO MUCH FOOD! Wanna know how good it smelled/tasted? It literally woke my friend up from an alcohol induced coma enough to text me from her room and ask if I was cooking steak. Also, there was enough food to share between all three of us.   The only thing I feel shitty about is I didn't tip the guy (because he was 20 mins late) and I was sick of hearing my wife whine. So, my message to the delivery driver:  Sorry bro. Next time, I'll know better and I'll make it right."}
{"text":"Not bad for a 4am call for delivery. I just wish it would've been hot and the crust a little crispy. I'd order again. It was also delivered sooner than expected."}
{"text":"The food really was pretty good I'm happy for that and this is one of the few places that will deliver late night which is nice but they really need to get it together.  First of all they greeted the phone like this: \"didn't you just call and hang up?\" Me: \"uhh nope not me\" them: \"oh well it was the same number soo...\" I checked the call logs to see if I did on accident...nope. me: \"uhm okay well I'm sorry?\"   Anyway places the order for a pizza with white sauce and 2 toppings. Al pepperoni, half mushroom half ham. Seeing as in the menu they pride themselves on making the pizza any way you'd like even in quarters! I didn't think that was too outrageous or a lot to ask... and a 2 liter of coke with a side of ranch. Time quoted, 45-60 mins but probably closer to 45 because we're close. Okay cool. Thanks!   After an hour and a half our food finally showed up. Forgot the 2 liter, they didn't put it on the ticket. Okay as long as I didn't get charged for then whatever I guess. Start getting the food out, no ranch. And the pizza is half pepperoni and mushroom half only ham, instead of white sauce we got LIGHT sauce...like I could looked past it if they didn't miss half the Order but seriously? Pay attention!  So to sum things up they were super rude, forgot half my order, and messed up the other half. I will not be ordering from there again"}
{"text":"That was one of the best pizzas I ever had!! I order from them almost every day and most of the time I have my order in less than 40 minutes after my call! The fastest drivers and cooks I guess. 5 stars from me :)"}
{"text":"I come to Vegas 6 times a year and this the best place for tasty chapli kabobs and there thin crust cheese pizza."}
{"text":"I will never eat here. I called to place an order for delivery and they place to on hold... Or so they thought they did. They were very rudely talking about someone who didn't leave a tip or wanted them to run their card for tip but was talking about them very very badly. They even had a chant that they were singing while running the card.   Cheap..cheap...cheap...cheap...with a drum role.   And once he picked up the phone I let him know that I wasn't on holding and  that was very rude and he said yeah whatever."}
{"text":"This was an amazing experience in flavor and quality food. Definitely one of the best pizza-pasta place in town. Good service and fairy prices ever!"}
{"text":"DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE  After almost 2 1/2 hours waiting for one pizza I had to call grub hub to refund me my money and cancel the order ... I give it zero stars because I never even received my order .... DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE"}
{"text":"I usually love this place, but this is unacceptable... I ordered a pizza on grubhub as I usually do and waited 2 hours (and over 20 minutes on hold) just to be told they thought I cancelled my order (my order had not been prepared for at least 1.5 hours). The guy on the phone was rude & unapologetic, saying that they were \"backed up\"... As a veteran of customer service, I understand places get busy sometimes, and am sympathetic to any person in the weeds. However, this is not how to treat your loyal customers. I'm going to bed hungry, and will never order from here again.   Shame too, cause the pizza isn't bad."}
{"text":"Under new management . Please don't go by old reviews, it was all by the old management. This place is delicious!! We ordered pizza, wings and calzone. All was amazing!!!!! My fav tho was the wings! By far the best! And maybe it's because of the ranch dressing it's sevrved with. Let me tell you,,, their ranch dressing is made from scratch and it is out of this world! Fresh, in house made, very light and clean tasting. Not heavy and overpowering. I would go back there just for the wings and ranch dressing. Sooooooo good!!!"}
{"text":"Located in the plaza with Target, you will find Cafe Verdi hidden on the same side as GameStop and Sally's. Luckily, this place is opened 24/7 and also delivers 24/7 (though I haven't used that service). At night, it will be difficult to find as their sign doesn't have a light on.  We walked in and ordered a 16\" pizza, half cheese and half spicy chicken. My boyfriend also ordered a Verdi burger and we got a 1 liter of soda. The total cost was $25... Seemed kind of pricey to me.   Food 2/5 We sat down at the table and waited for about 20 minutes before the food came. While I was eating, I had realized that this pizza was just mediocre. The portion is very large so I only had two slices. I also took a bite of the burger and it was mediocre as well.  Nothing special, but wasn't disgusting.   Service 3/5 Nothing noteworthy about service. The guys there were helpful but the environment seemed extremely casual and some employees seemed clueless. We asked for ranch and never got it, but the guys seem nice.   This place isn't a place I would recommend or come back to unless it was convenient. Because it is 24/7 with delivery too, it seems like that would be the only time I use their service. Otherwise, nope!"}
{"text":"YOU Would walk right OUT if you went IN. It always looks like it's in a state of renovation or a contractor walked out on the job. a real dive Just the 3 Armenian-looking guys running the place-the Cook-The Counter & Delivery.   REAL SCARY GUYS!! Always on their phones yelling at someone!!  Pizza & wings. We have eaten here 20+ times over the years. It is CHEAP ($8.50 for 1 topping Large) and it is GOOD.  The pizza is brick oven baked-the crust is VERY thin & crispy just enough sauce and just enough cheese to be GREASY but NOT too greasy. If you like it NY style this is a good spot.  FEED THE FAMILY FOR UNDER $20"}
{"text":"I'm editing my review that i wrote over a year ago (today is 3-6-18) because it seems like they've switched owners or management and now everything is completely changed for the worst. I would avoid this place. They've pretty much ruined everything good about the restaurant. The pizza crust is cracker like, the sauce now is overly seasoned with oregano, the vegetarian pizza now includes inedibly large dollops of raw garlic, the strombolis are no longer rolled which sorta makes them not calzones, the wings that arrived were under sauced and under fried. I haven't tried all the other stuff on the menu because why would I? It looks like the new owners have added a slew of Mediterranean dishes which I haven't tried. For all I know they might be good. But I was a loyal cafe verdi customer for about 9 years and now I'm regrettably going to have to walk away :( Cafe Verdi I will miss you. You were there for me on so many later nights. RIP"}
{"text":"Love the food there I would recommend  this  place to everyone they do need to advertise more often and put out flyer on there restaurant  best crew they got delivery  and cook pass the word around u will enjoy it a lot"}
{"text":"I came in, no ones inside. But decided to give it a chance because it IS early. I walked in and suddenly the wild stench of the place seemed to have punched my nose from horridness. I just wanted to vomit. I ordered a sandwich and a drink. BAD CHOICE!! Aside from not having fountain drink, they charge $1 for using the card.. I mean. Wtf? They dont have a restroom. The guy on the counter recieved a few phone calls and banged the phone whenever no one responded. Wow. Maybe he forgot a customer(me) can hear him.   Anyway, food. The food was a bit overpriced for me. But it was GOOD! I don't know if the fact that I am starving helped in any way but I think it was phenominal!   I feel like if this place is updated it would have more customers."}
{"text":"This restaurant was terrible and it finally caught up to them the health department shut them down permanently per ABC News"}
{"text":"Don't get the pancakes!!! For $6.99 I got 4 slightly bigger than silver dollars cakes that were burned hard and tasted like grilled frozen cakes, horrible breakfast"}
{"text":"This was the only place that delivery up to 10pm. I was crazy to eat some Mediterranean food. The price is fare, the food is very good, delicious bread, very fresh salad, I use to go eat in some Mediterranean restaurants and they don't have fresh salad like this one. The food tastes very good. The only thing is, they should tell us at the website details about the food. I was not expecting pepper. I'm not American, I don't like pepper and this is one of the reasons why I love Mediterranean food. Usually in the Mediterranean restaurants, at least the ones I use to go, there's not spicy meat in the main menu. I didn't write a note asking for non spicy food cause I was not expecting for that but it was my bad too. Good thing is, the taste is very good so I can handle it. Everything perfect. I will definitely order again! But you guys should definitely put some more details about the food seasoning. Also the they confirmed my order only one minute after by text message and it was delivered before the time expected. Very good service! Congrats!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews my coworkers and I were a bit skeptical about ordering from Café Verdi but we were pleasantly surprised. While the wait was long (about an hour and a half - though our location is hard to find.) the food arrived warm and delicious.  We ordered a variety of things from the menu. My coworker Bridgette and I decided t go splitsies on a Buffalo Chicken Pizza. The pizza was great in our opinions. The onions were sweet which was a nice offset to the mild spiciness of the Buffalo sauce (personally I would have liked to have had more of the Buffalo sauce, but the amount there was perfectly acceptable). The crust is plain in general with no pizzazz or distinct flavor. For a CHICKEN pizza there was a lot of bacon and the ricotta cheese was a nice compliment to the dish as a whole but not necessary. In the end we both went back for seconds and I would recommend it. We also ordered Jalapeno Poppers considering we are all fans of the classic BBQ side. The taste was 'good' but it lacked the spice we look forward to as a group. In my opinion they were a bit cold, but that was probably due to the wait time. All in all, not bad and we would recommend for flavor but not for spice. On top of that we ordered Mozzarella Sticks. There is nothing defining about them as they are your run of the mill freezer appetizer but notably the marinara sauce was thin and oily which was disappointing and kind of gross. I would not recommend if you are picky. My coworker ordered the Spaghetti and Meatballs; he enjoyed the pasta, and the sauce was 'soupy' he can be quoted as saying \"the meatballs taste frozen and processed\" and he would not recommend it to a perspective customer. My boss ordered the Steak Calzone Everything - no mushrooms. He can be quoted as saying the calzone was \"decent\" but he gives it two thumbs up.... This inconsistency in enthusiasm is probably due to his personality but I digress. He would \"definitely recommend\" it to a perspective customer. Lastly I ordered cheesecake being the resident sweet tooth of the office and am sorry to say I was disappointed. I was looking forward to a great slice of dessert and what I got was pre packaged and frozen. After it defrosted the taste was mediocre. All in all a lot of the food came off as frozen and not fresh but it's still edible and of average quality."}
{"text":"I like Cafe Verdi the food is good and the delivery is always on time. I left three stars because after seeing other reviews about cockroaches and flies it grossed me out. I hope they clean their kitchen up. I don't think I'll be returning until I do further investigation with the health department about the establishment. Also they are required by law to post there grade on the wall I'm going to see if they got an A or atleast a B."}
{"text":"At 3 am, in a desperate stroke of hunger I ordered from here, with low expectations. As the only place in my area that I could find to deliver, my hopes were not high. I ordered via grub hub at 2:51, they were supposed to arrive at 3:55, and finally at 4:10 it was here. I must say that while the food was lukewarm and 15 minutes late, it was actually quite tasty.   The personal pizza was smothered in salty cheese ans the sauce was light and sweet. The crust had a slight sweetness as well and was soft and pillowy like a bread stick.  The mozzarella sticks were lightly breaded with no crunch. The ranch dressing (as requested) complimented the flavor perfectly.  Even the chocolate cake beat the typical plastic-wrapped pizza joint standard. It was fluffy and not too sweet.   It all reminded me of the kind of junk food you find at at a baseball game- a greasy, artery-clogging,  guilty pleasure. This place is undoubtedly a go to for Superbowl parties and hangovers. The prices are great too- but unless you like to waste money DO NOT order delivery!! What should have been a $15 meal came out to almost $30 with a staggering $8 delivery fee and a 20% tip. For the food to be cold and late, it was definitely not worth the cost. Otherwise, great food!"}
{"text":"The food is good, cheese pizza is yummy.   BUT, the staff is just rude. The old guy who answers the phone is an annoying ass, and then when you pick it up, they act like you are annoying them and taking up their time.   BTW-it's the 2nd time in a row the old guy who took our order via phone was rude for no reason. He acted like I was 3 years old, yelling \"Hold on hold on...\" multiple times as I slowly told him what we wanted.   With sooo many choices, I may not go back. Too bad, the food was good at a decent price."}
{"text":"Terrible! After I waited 1 hour and a half they delivered my food and it was cold. Not to mention they forgot half my order!!!! The fries were cold and the wings barely had any sauce on them. I'm so disappointed and will NEVER order from them again EVER!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"BEWARE OF LAWRENCE THE PHONE MAN. HE IS ARGUMENTATIVE, DISRESPECTFUL. THIS \"BUSINESS\" IS TRASH.  First off anyone who would order from this cave must be desperately hungry and not thinking there options through. Which I was. Here's the low down with this dumpster...  I made an order at 9:13 AM the food arrived around 11 am. What a joke. The order was for chicken tenders NOT SPECIFIED TO BE DRENCHED IN HOT SAUCE, but to include an order of the 3 sauces. Ranch, hot sauce and BBQ sauce. The chicken tenders came  lately around 11 am. 2hours later. They where DRENCHED in hot sauce, to the point of an uneatable marinade of sloppiness. Ranch never came and poor quality bbq sauce.  The eclair was the only eatable thing but was too sweet and tasted like an artificial sweetened product of poor quality for the price of 3.25. (not worth it) The french fries where literally damp. Soggy and uneatable. There where even flecks of green mold on the edges of the fries. I'm surprised this place is approved by the health code in las vegas.  Now this is where it gets even more crazy and im not writing this because i have any personal issues, im writing this because of how they handled there business with me. I had almost cried when my order came because i was just so hungry and it was terrible i couldnt eat it. I called the place to ask for an exchange of chicken tenders. I told the man how i ordered the sauces and how they did not specify they prepared them drenched in hot sauce. The man started SCREAMING and shouting at me and actually insulted me by calling me \"stupid\"! I said look, either way your going to have to fix my order to plain tenders or give me a refund. He said he will not fix the order and that If i want another order I will have to pay for it?? how absurd is that! How can they mess up an order and not offer a replacement? That is foreign to me in the restaurant business! I didn't even eat the chicken because of the incorrect preparation. I then felt so sour in my stomach because after being called stupid by lawrence he then raised his voice again in a hostile nature when i asked for a refund. He said good luck trying to get a refund! Well I called  my bank and made sure I did. I had to hang up on him because of him screaming and shouting. It was so bizarre. I dont understand how someone running a business could be so hostile and rude. This has to stop or this place be boycotted."}
{"text":"AMAZING PIZZA beautiful and sweet front counter girls always smiling clean appearance of the Resturuant"}
{"text":"The only reason I created this Yelp account was just to write this comment. The food is over priced and gross. The cheese steak cost $8 and that was with no fries. The cheesesteak barely had any meat or cheese. I also ordered the fingers and those were even worst! Made me sick to my stomach. I do NOT recommend this place to anybody. You are better off driving to a McDonald's or just wait for another place to open. It's better than getting sick from eating the food from this place."}
{"text":"Super yummy pizza cooked so nicely every time!! Usually get a jalapeño + pepperoni + bacon combo. Have had thin crust and regular #pizzaheaven"}
{"text":"Highly recommended for a quick tasty pizza. Very convenient for late hours. Close to strip......."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza delivery super late the other night and not even being starving drunk could make this pizza taste decent! Gross! Only upside to this place is their hours and that the delivery didn't take forever like a lot of places in Vegas. But even if it showed up instantly: if it's disgusting, does it really matter? Even Sophia's is better than this!"}
{"text":"My cousin ordered a Philly cheesesteak and a Caesar salad at 8:30pm because this place is LITERALLY 1 MILE AWAY! It is now 10:00 and the food just arrived. She received a phone call an hour after she ordered because the driver said he'd gotten lost (and of course he barely spoke English), so she had to direct him street by street until he got here. The lettuce in her salad literally tasted like dirt because it obviously wasn't washed, the chicken on it tastes like sawdust and the garlic bread that came with it was soggy and mushy and cold. The Philly cheesesteak was like a half-ass sandwich, barely filled at all, also freezing cold. And the fries that came with it on the side were so cold and hard it was like they had been sitting there for over an hour (which they had)! They also gave her an extra side of caesar dressing instead of the ranch that she asked for with her fries. Everything was so incredibly bland. No seasoning, not even a dash of salt to help the tastebuds force down a bite of the shit that they call food. $20 for \"food\" that we can't even bring ourselves to finish eating. Please do yourself a favor, and avoid this place at all costs. I can't believe they're still in business based on all the nasty reviews. If I could give this place a -3, I would."}
{"text":"My dogs and I all now have food poisoning. I used to order from here ALL the time. So disappointed.  To SPECIFY I NOT ONLY HAD A PIZZA BUT HAD CHICKEN, MEATBALLS AND SHELLS AS WELL.    Since I've been getting bitched at for my review by a YELPER with no reviews I am only to assume that that was the restaurant.    I would eat your guys food 3 or more times a week for the past 2 years."}
{"text":"This was the worst food I have ever ordered.  The pizza was chewy and tasteless.  I ordered extra tomatoes on the margarita pizza and there were 4 on the entire thing.  The basil was cheep dried spices and when it was delivered all the toppings were pushed over to one side like he carried the box sideways.  The pasta was even worse.  Waaaayyy over cooked, bland sauce and the meatballs were tasteless and mushy.  I have never felt so cheated in my life."}
{"text":"If I could I would give this shit whole NEGATIVE 3 stars! We ordered at 10:30 and they got here at 1:15 am!!!! Our food was cold, they gave us a cheese pizza when we ordered pepperoni, their excuse was that they 'had too many orders at that time' bitch... Please."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever. And if you're looking for food that is even remotely warm this isn't the place. I order from the frequently and now they are telling me they can't deliver to my neighborhood acting like I'm crazy for ordering food from them even though I do frequently and they hung up on me. They take hours, won't tell you who the manager is , take 0 responsibility for their product and are just plain rude to customers. Insanity."}
{"text":"TLDR:   Overall:  average Service: Okay Food: passable Experience:  baffling  When I first walked into this establishment, I walked into an unmanned dining area and a bar with people in it.  Naturally, being a Las Vegas resident, I bellied up to the bar, only to be told that the two establishments were completely different.  ( The area is open air, and the restaurant is attached to Molly's tavern.).   I got up and walked over to the still unmanned dining area, created a summoning circle of stale cigarettes and  straws and conjured a hostess.    We sat down, ordered beverages, and being desert rats immediately sucked them down.  We asked the young lady for refills, and were told she'd refill them once..  but they were popping cans, and didn't have a fountain.   We got our refills and immediately put our drinks to the side.  I maybe thirsty, but A girl wait.  We ordered appetizers, garlic rolls and some sandwiches.  The food was passable.  I don't know that I would crave it. Ever.  But it filled my stomach.   Our order came out quickly and correctly.  We paid out bill and left.  To be honest I'm not sure I'd ever go back.    Pros:  - food was passable.  I'd consider them for take out  Cons:  - confusing.  Not sure if they're the same restaurant or not.    - need wait staff who stay on the floor  - you're a restaurant, attached to a bar which I assume has a soda gun.  If you're not mutually owned, work something out with them.  In this day and age as a sit down and dine establishment there is NO excuse for not having free refills.  Figure. It. Out.   - food was passable, but nothing I'd go out of my way for.  There are better Italian restaurants in the area that don't smell like stale smoke, have super attentive wait staff, and unlimited soda.  (Insert plug for Giuseppe's or casa di amore here.)  I'm going to wrap this up with the hope that the owner does read these reviews.  You're onto something.  Your food is passable, but could be stellar if you decided on a specific cuisine.   Presentation is amazing when it's here.   You need to decide if you're a bar or an Italian restaurant.  And stick to it.  And for god sakes.  It's the twenty first century, in the most soda obsessed country in the world.  Invest in a soda fountain.   Seriously."}

{"text":"We ordered from here via UberEats. I ordered the garlic parm wings and fries. The wings were very good and flavorful... they could've actually put more seasoning on it but i know for next time. The fries were crispy and fresh and didn't need anything extra. One of my friends had the BBQ wings and another ordered the sweet chili. Both were great!"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!! After waiting an hour and 45 minutes the pizza was cold and the pasta was DISGUSTING. They charge you $3 extra to add chicken to the fettuccine Alfredo and the whole meal isn't even worth $3. NEVER ordering from this place again. Definitely isn't worth the wait time or money."}
{"text":"I ordered everyday for a month recovering from surgery. Food was good but pricey for delivery. The last order I placed was OVER $50 AND ARRIVED AFTER 3 HOURS! Food was ruined by that time and they refused to refund my money OR come get the food! Told me they would give me $10 off on my next order!  I've spent probably $750 ordering from them in the past and won't make that mistake again. The guy who takes the orders is a total smarmy douche lacking social skills or proper phone etiquette.   Despite having my standard order in the data base, they insist on seeing my credit card and driver's license every time and rubbing it for an imprint. The drivers always claim they got lost despite my knowing them by name. Come on guys, don't BS a BSr."}

However, they called me and told me that was only within a 5 mile radius and it would be $2.00 extra per mile beyond 5.  I was then told to have the $2.00 extra for the delivery driver.  I found it unacceptable that they didn't just say \"we won't charge this time, but for next time\".  I felt bad for the delivery driver because that money ended up coming out of his tip.  When we got the food, it was bland, tasteless and only lukewarm.  We won't be giving them our business again.  Very disappointed."}

Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"I order regularly from Cafe Verdi.  Love their food, prices are fair, and delivery is always on time if not early.  When I eat in the staff is friendly, the manager takes my order and delivers my food to the table, and the atmosphere is homey.  I highly recommend you give them a try!"}
{"text":"I got in late from my flight and asked for recommendations of places to eat, since I hadn't eaten since 12 pm that afternoon.  They deliver anywhere in the vicinity 24/7. Best wings and fries ever. Maybe bc I was so famished at 3am. But it was good. Fast food, great service, typical wing place prices. Well, a little more steep than what I'm used to. I paid about $15 for 10 wings and fries. Including tax and delivery. So not bad."}
{"text":"don't be fooled into gettin one of the 6.50 lunch specials...disgusting. the delivery guy was such a jerk and the food took an hour and a half to get here..after a few calls of them saying 'hes almost there!'"}
{"text":"On a Thursday night, delivery took a little over 75 minutes. We got two pizzas and an order of zucchini sticks, and everything was hot, fresh, and delicious."}
{"text":"Café Verde east is gross we order delivery tonight and I am very unhappy calamari is fake, overcooked and smells bad my wife and I ordered steak subs both of which I think are made with steakums not even sure if I want to try the macaroni salad doesn't look safe sorry but I will never order from this restaurant again"}
{"text":"Waited for pizza never came. Called and asked what was up. Got yelled at. Just bad service."}
{"text":"I did not even want to give this place a one star. The person that answered the phone in regards to my post mates delivery about an hour ago at 3:20 AM on this Thursday/Friday morning, Is really unprofessional. I ordered post mates food and his company did not follow up with the driver or Postmates to ensure that my food got here on time. Rather he told me to call Postmates to deal with it myself. I've been ordering from Café Verdi for well over 27 years. I'm a long-time customer. But after today I am not pleased with the service, and will be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"i just ordered our meals today on Christmas evening.  All other times have been great from here so when i noticed several items on my order were incorrect (no FF like i ordered, texas burger only having meat, cheese, lettuce and green peppers and no BBQ sauce and no pickle spear) i thought calling and mentioning it would get me a small discount on my next order.. after all everyone makes mistakes especially on xmas. WRONG. as soon as i called in and started to mention it the guy is being very rude and basically says that im wrong....i tried rephrasing what i was saying to assure him im a long customer and im not tripping i just wanted to mention it..bottom line dude is a real rude jerk and should learn A BIG  lesson on customer service... just a note i was charged correctly from them but was not what i ordered on eat24"}
{"text":"Cafe Verdi (used to be) my FAVORITE pizza place. Unfortunately the new owner messed with the pizza recipe & screwed it up! PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD...make it the way the old owner did! He had it right, the first time!!! So disappointed with the new recipe..it was SUPER greasy, pizza dough was too doughy & under cooked & the cheese tasted like play dough. Yuck!"}
{"text":"Ordered late night cravings and they delivered quickly (30 minutes) their pizza is amazing! The fries and wings were also amazing. Oh and they gave us ranch without even asking :)))))"}
{"text":"So it was late at night my fiancé and I were hungry so we came across this restaurant, he ordered the gyro with fries and I ordered mozzarella sticks and onion rings , tho it came within the time frame the gyro had razor thin slices of meat and he was only given a small handful of fries mind you his alone was 9.99. My mozzarella sticks were fine but my onion rings literally had NO onions in them at all it was just breading, I thought maybe it was just a few but every single one had no onion at all. Our total was just under $30. Quite the rip off of you ask me and I've never been so dissatisfied with food I've ordered from any restaurant in Vegas."}
{"text":"So..the food was delicious and the delivery driver was equally as snacky  if he comes along with each order I'll be a repeat customer"}
{"text":"An absolute travesty. The people who work here are absurdly unprofessional and by far the rudest I have ever encoutered. I ordered my foot at 2:25am. I just got home from work. It is now 4:15 am. And it has not even been prepared. They tried to refuse a refund. When you pizza is late it's free. Not \"because you still want your food you pay\" or \"either you get a refund or your pizza.\" As if I'm somehow at fault. They wanted to tell me \"there's no need for attitude.\" They have lost my business."}
{"text":"This place gets a gold star in my book, as it's the only place I can find to deliver a fresh, tasty pizza, laden in toppings and gooey cheesiness, to my door at 4 in the morning. Man, late-night poker tourneys are very demanding, and you need fuel to win!  I've never had a problem with placing an order or receiving it in a timely manner.  The prices are pretty much standard pizza prices, and the pizza you receive is pretty much a standard pizza. Nothing fantastic, but nothing to complain about, either.  I will admit that we only order from them when everything else is closed."}
{"text":"Ok, if you have no other options.   I work graveyard, and this is one of the only places that delivers near me overnight.  Their pizza is ok, NY style.  But, aside from their pizza, I'd advise to stay away.  I don't think there's a single fresh ingredient anywhere to be found. That includes their meat/chicken.   It's not too hard to throw a chicken breast on a flat grill, but this place insists on using pre-cooked chicken on it's items.. And you can really tell.   All of their appetizers are frozen, and fried.  If this is your last ditch resort, then go ahead.. But if you have other options, exercise them!"}
{"text":"Very very very good pizza!  Not a very pretty restaurant though. Needs a good renovation?  Tried their subs yoo not bad."}
{"text":"Things to celebrate: It's open 24-hours. Our service was really charming. The gentleman behind the counter paid more attention to what I wanted than my husband. My husband said, \"We'll take half vegetarian,\" and he said, \"I think she wanted spinach.\" He was right! (I even appreciated the part where I heard him yelling \"F*** this. The only people who are suffering are the customers,\" I couldn't quite understand the problem, but it had something to do with cold fries. Regardless, I support anyone who supports a customers' right to hot fries!) The flavor was delicious, meaning the sauce, toppings and cheese were all doing their job.   Things to lament: If you are dining in, the surroundings are a little shabby. The crust, although it is thin, is a bit doughy, not crisp, which means it is great for dipping in a sauce of your choice, but not a superb pizza vehicle. It was easy to cut, though! I got a little pizza belly following our late night meal here. If it weren't for the post meal feeling, I may have stuck with 4 stars.  I saw two fellow diners noshing on some Caesar salads that looked big and fresh. I was a bit envious.   Overall, definitely A-OK, and the place for your 24-hour pizza delivery needs. I noticed plenty of orders heading out to the casinos when 11pm rolled around!"}
{"text":"Ordered lunch for the 2nd time.  The first time it was okay - good enough to go back but what a disappointment today.  Greek salad loaded with cheap Feta cheese that was very hard and way over-used.  The lettuce was all Iceburg and mostly the hard white stalks rather than leaves.  Very little flavor to the dressing, could see no oregano and the garlic bread was greasy.  Co-worker was uninspired by the chicken fingers with soggy fries.  They included a free cheese pizza but it was greasy and also uninspired.  The sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce.   We won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Didn't get our order right, put the wrong toppings on our pizza and forgot to bring our 2 liter that I got charged 3.49 for. Pizza has that weird cardboard-like crust like Little Cesar's.  The person who called to confirm my order couldn't talk, didn't understand one word he said, he just kept saying pizza, so I kept saying \"yes, pizza. I ordered pizza\". It was one of the few places open at 1:30 am. This place sucks"}
{"text":"Ordered 2x gyros and a combo appetizers via grubhub Was delivered in a timely manner. Left nice tip  Gyro meat was very very thin and very very dry. It was like pita bread stuffed with Iceberg lettuce and jerky. Inedible.  Appetizer platter was a bunch of fried stuff and came out about as one would expect. Portions of marinara were fine but single container of ranch was half filled which kinda sucks."}
{"text":"The food is decent, but they cant seem to get our order correct. We order from them quite a bit using the eat24 app. The last 3 times we have ordered chicken fingers it asks what sauce you want on them. All 3 times I have selected the sauce and then in the notes asked for it on the side. The first time no sauce, ok whatever, 2nd time ordered two orders of fingers and two different sauces only got one sauce. Let them know via eat24 that the sauce was forgotten. Tonight ordered again and once again no sauce. I called them and then had to argue with whoever answered the phone that there was no sauce. He finally apologized, realized they also forgot the cheese pizza (its their special order a certain amount and get a free cheese pizza). Said he would send the driver back right away with our sauce and the pizza and he would throw in a  \"dessert or something\". Now 45 minutes later still no sauce the fingers are now cold and havent heard back from them. I plan on adding them to the dont order list. Yeah I enjoy the food but not enough to make up for not getting the order right and then not fixing it in a timely manner."}
{"text":"Just like you may read in a few other reviews, they do take around two hours to deliver, however the food really is awesome. I am extremely picky about pizza and their pizza was extremely good. Aside from bringing me the incorrect soda, I ordered Pepsi and they brought me a Sprite, I have no complaints. Especially from a place that I ordered from at 6 AM."}
{"text":"Ordered a Hawaiian pizza and BBQ chicken wings from this place yesterday. Pizza was nothing at all special. Dense and chewy dough with very little in the way of toppings. Sauce was bland and spread too thin and pineapple out of a can and cheese that tasted artificial. Chicken wings were ok. Way too much sauce however. Found myself scraping off most of the sauce just to eat them. On the positive side the Service was good and good was hot and brought out quick... won't be coming here again any time soon."}
{"text":"This place is ridiculous!! We ordered off grubhub & it took 2 hours & 3 phone calls for them to finally get the order to us and they couldn't even get that right. Don't waste your time or your money!! When my husband called to complain, the guy who claimed to be the manager refused to help him, and when we demanded a refund they told him they were going to call grubhub and hung up on him. We will never order from this place again and will be sure to tell everyone we know about this horrible experience!"}
{"text":"I h e a very love hate relationship with Cafe Verdi.   Pros: Amazing hot sandwiches   Cons: Meh salads Slowest delivery service in Vegas.  I order from them on occasion because their Philly's and Meatball subs are to die for, but I have to be prepared to wait 1 1/2 - 2 hours for it to come. This place is probably better if you eat in."}
{"text":"I ordered from grubhub. After ordering I read their reviews, and then came to yelp for the reviews as well. All of the reviews were rather disheartening and I became anxious. But, my order was on time- actually 30 minutes earlier than expected- and was accurate. I don't know how the attitude was with the delivery driver since my husband was the one to greet him and get the food, but he didn't make a complaint to me so I took that as a good sign. I ordered a meat pizza and sample platter. The sample platter was delicious! The mushrooms were fried just right; the mozzarella sticks were oozing cheese; the poppers were spicy; onion rings were just okay; my only complaint with the platter is the fried zucchini - it was very mushy and I couldn't eat more than one, but my puppy loved them! The pizza is great if you're drinking, which we were, but not so good as leftovers. This was disappointing because I absolutely love next day cold pizza for breakfast on-the-go.  Overall, I'm happy with the food and delivery and will most likely be ordering again.  I will update after my next order."}
{"text":"Could not find 0 stars. Got one of there flyer's on the door and decided we were desperate enough to try this place for their spaghetti, meatballs and pizza. Boy, what a mistake!!!! The food was promised in 30 to 45 minutes and arrived in just a hair under 2 hours. Lets start with the food had a weird smell to it. Now we opened the spaghetti. It was cold, extremely dry, flavorless, the noodles were dried out like they were cooked yesterday. In their menu it states they \"only use the finest quality imported pasta\". BULL $HIT. If they did, they imported it cooked already. Now for the meatballs, low grade hamburger meat cooked in grease with absolutely, I mean absolutely no seasoning or flavoring and small, way to small for the price of them. The pizza was dry, crust was hard as a rock, cold and the pizza smelled & tasted like one of those frozen pizzas you get from the supermarket. The toppings besides the pepperoni was sparse, a light sprinkling of about a half a hand full for a 24\" pie. And guess what the soda that came with the meal was warm. Warmer then the pizza and spaghetti. We called back to get a refund, and the manager (or some flunkie with a fake foreign accent (wasn't quite Italian, maybe Greek)) gives us a bunch of lip about how their food is cooked fresh. After about 10 minutes of bickering back and forth, the \"manager\" claimed that all his food is frozen. Gee, hence the freezer taste of everything. We finally had to drive to their location and surrender our food (which was fine, it was stinking up the house) and got a refund. YUCK YUCK YUCK with a serving of YUCK. Buyer beware."}
{"text":"I ordered the blackened chicken Cesar salad, it was surprisingly really good, the chicken has great flavor. I also ordered the jalapeño poppers which were still crispy upon arrival.  I almost didn't order from here because of the bad reviews. But it was good, and I would totally order from here again. And it's also nice because it's open late."}
{"text":"Not bad for late night food. They delivered to our Strip hotel which was nice, especially for 2 AM. We got pizza, and some other bar-type snacks. The only thing we really liked was the garlic bread. Fries were soggy, pizza was meh. Being that it's a late night delivery place on the Las Vegas Strip I really expected it all to be pricey, but it cost $32 including a delivery charge and tip. It took longer than we'd have liked, but I imagine they're kinda busy. Decent place to order from if you are back from a night out and just need to eat!!"}
{"text":"It only took them 2 & a half hours to deliver a pizza. Absolutely rude on the phone and they were annoyed that we called them back to ask for the estimated time of arrival. Save your money. They burn the pizza every single time I've ordered from there."}
{"text":"Took them 90 minutes to deliver a cheese pizza and mozzarella sticks. Delivery driver grabbed the money and made a b line for the door. The pizza and mozzarella sticks are both cold. Tried to catch the guy, but he was already gone. Attempted calling the restaurant with no answer. I do not recommend ever ordering food from Cafe Verdi!"}
{"text":"Why does delivery take so long. I dont get it. My sandwich wad freezing cold when i got it, and if i wasnt starving i wouldve never eaten it. Plus the delivery driver was so unfriendly."}
{"text":"Food arrived roughly on time but is always cold and soggy pretty disgusting for the amount of money we like to spend"}
{"text":"I ordered online and it says there an hour and 15mins.... 1 hour and 15mins already passed my food is still not here I called them and the guy told me another 15mins because its busy I asked him if thats for sure and he said yes... I waited 25minutes more and still nothing I gave them a call back and they asked me for more time!! almost 2 hours wait time and they want more WOW!! I cancelled my order!!! very inconsiderate!!  we're starving.. next time just dont take orders if you can't deliver it on time!!!"}
{"text":"This business needs to get a younger driver for late night delivery. They have been to my place about 4 times now & every time they fuck up..... leaving me sometimes with out food. The guy that does come, is old & needs to not be working due to the fact that he cannot remember simple orders; & the food isn't even THAT GOOD. They need to work on their phone skills, driving, and cooking.   If I could give this business anything more negative, I would."}
{"text":"I have ordered from here a couple of times. I am not one to pass out 1 star to restaurants, but I had a very poor experience and feel the need to warn others.  The first order was a couple of weeks ago. They were later than promised by about 15 minutes, but the food was at least still warm and edible. I ordered a breakfast sandwich with bacon, breakfast burrito with bacon, and a chicken quesadilla for a later lunch. It wasn't that good, but the breakfast sandwich was worth buying again. The rest was not very good (and I am not that picky as long as there are no onions on anything).  I ordered from here through eat24 since very few places deliver to my area. The order today was placed at 7:20 this morning with an estimated delivery of 8:50. They did not arrive until 9:37 am. Once I got the food inside (breakfast sandwich and chicken wings) and opened the boxes, everything I ordered was cold and stale. Even the free cheese pizza for their anniversary special was cold and stale. I understand that I live 15 minutes drive time from there, but if you cannot deliver an order at least lukewarm, don't agree to deliver to that area. Also, don't cook the food and let it sit for 2 hours and then deliver it.   I requested a refund since everything I ordered was inedible, they refused, and they offered a credit for the next order. Sorry, I will not be ordering here a third time to be disappointed again. I would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food is always really good here but this last time I ordered they sent the wrong cake I love the chocolate cake but I got a mousse cake and in the appetizer combo it had no zucchini and way too many mushrooms only 2 stuffed jalapeños I just feel like I spent 10$ alone on mushrooms, they were close to closing maybe that's why"}
{"text":"A co-worker of mine ordered lunch from here last week, We order from this place often for lunch. The food is desent and the prices for lunch specials are resonable. BUT let me tell you something After my co-worker ordered her lunch it took well over an hour to be delivered, That is a long wait for delivery. Then when the delivery driver arrived he was a rude arrogent A##hole. He demanded a tip and when my coworker said she needed change he got upset. He goes to his car to get change brings back the change throws the change on the desk and says to her, \"next time pick up the food yourself\" how unprofessional is that???   we will never be ordering from Cafe Verdi again. When we contacted the manager nothing was done. A half A*# apology was given making an excuse for the driver stating he was stressed out. WHO CARES! we all get stressed out but you don't treat your loyal customers poorly,  My recomendation is find another place to order from!  RUDE!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"If you like waiting over two hours for cold food then you'll love Cafe Verdi.  I gave them a second chance last night after they took over two hours the first time I ordered from them. Last night was the same deal, only this time they brought us the wrong entree. Their garlic bread is somehow burnt yet soggy, the salad looked like the lettuce had gone bad and when we called for the third time to tell them our order was screwed up they told us we were wrong and were incredible rude about it.  There are a lot of decent places to order food from in Vegas, this isn't one of them."}
{"text":"I got good and bads about this place.   Have only ordered once but it seemed we paid a lot for what we ended up with. 30 bucks for a white pizza 14\" and some onions rings and two cans of soda. The pizza was REALLY good, no problems there except for the fact that it wasn't very big for the price. The onions rings were weird. Definitely frozen, processed, and 5.99!!! The kind you get in a child's frozen meal, and 5.99... You must be tripping.  Its cool that they deliver 24 hours. thats a big plus!  BUT  Don't act all gourmet  with those prices when your going to have frozen onion rings."}
{"text":"Craving a Burger at 3am? Thats the place! Ordered few times. They are paying attention to any details you mention to them."}
{"text":"Great late night delivery! Pizza was really good! Didn't take to long for delivery! Would definitely order from then again!"}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place, I get the pizza and it's always the best pizza. Everyone here is friendly and nice.it also has a great environment. They have one of the best crew. They always make it on time."}
{"text":"I wish I could provide this place with a negative star. Ordered food from this place through GrubHub at 11:33 am; the initial delivery time that the GrubHub website stated was between 12:00 - 12:45. Next thing I know I get an email notification that delivery time will be between 1:00 - 1:15. So 1:15 comes and goes no food. I try to call the number listed on the GrubHub website the number isn't even associated with the restaurant. I google the number that number is out of service. So I call GrubHub customer service where there was a very nice and understanding female customer service agent that even gave me a $5.00 grub hub certificate. Anyway, my food eventually gets here at 1:42. The delivery driver was nice but the food was cold and the beverages were hot enough to melt ice. The food was cold and disgusting. Needless to say I threw away $30.00 worth of food. The salad of all things was the saltiest I ever tasted and the bread was soggy and cold. I will never ever again order from this place."}
{"text":"I have never ordered anything but the pepperoni pizza and have always picked it up myself. That being said, I have never been disappointed by the deliciousness of the moderately greasy pizza!"}
{"text":"Order from them because its 24 hour delivery and pizza i awesome.  Theirs is pretty good but always shows up cold., the delivery guy is never very nice and a few days ago i ordered from them via Eat24 and for the last few months they've had a deal going on that if you spent over , i think it was 20$, you get a free small cheese pizza.  Ive done it 6 times in the last 3 months and it says in the check out the pizza i attached , i asked for jalapeños on the side, plates  and napkins.  Delivery guy shows up with a cold pizza ( normal )  an attitude , no plays,  no napkins,  no jalapeños  and no small pizza.  Even though i only ordered the medium pizza to get the free small. He called his boss and then told me to message eat24 because its not his problem.   Not calling them anymore."}
{"text":"I remember this place and how terrible it was even two years ago. Glad to see it finally got shut down. Anyone claiming it was good either was drunk when they ate there, doesn't know good pizza or was affiliated with the establishment and wanted to bring up yelp rating. Good riddance!"}
{"text":"After a long day of being out in Vegas.. My girlfriend & I were starving.. So we called them up at 3 am and pizza was delivered within 45 minutes! Definitely satisfied our tummies! THANK YOU !!!!"}
{"text":"I have a huge love for two things, ramen and lasagna. Tonight was a lasagna night.  After browsing around yelp for about 30minutes I ended at cafe Verdi.   The online ordering had some issues, so I ended up calling the restaurant to order. Phone gets picked up and she informs me that the wait was going to be 1 hour 15mins due to there only being one driver. Since I prefer ordering in advance I was fine with it. Very polite, took my order, made it quick and before hanging up once again informed me with the wait time. So very satisfied with her service.   I ended up waiting about 1 hour and 45 minutes. By the time the order was here, I was starving, looking forward to my food. However very nuke and though the bowl looked huge half of it was sauce, with very little noodles. As hungry as I was, and the what I had to go through, and there not being much food to it I still managed to not finishing it which the bread and sauce went to the dogs plate.  However quite satisfied with tiramisu. Highly doubt it was made in the restaurant, but I will give credit for it satisfying my sweet tooth. If it weren't for that and my mimosa I had with my meal, I would have had to cooked something up for myself.   This time I had gotten delivery but it's not that I was dissatisfied with the entire meal so I will be going in as dine-in and give it another try."}
{"text":"First time ordering, we work around the corner.We ordered two sets of plain fingers with ranch and bbq on the side with cheese sticks.  My co-worker, who ordered on the phone, went to pickup. Told 30 min, no problem. She goes to get it and bring it back. As they were loading it she asked for the bbq sauce and he replied, \"the person who ordered ordered one with bbq on it.\" She knew we were starving so she just took it. The fries were limp and old tasting (we literally work 2 min away so they had to start out from the restaurant like that), she found some orange stuff in her chicken fingers which is unfortunate because I thought that was the only thing that tasted good, the sodas are cans from the vending machine, and the cheese sticks had a funny taste. The marinara sauce for them was quite watery, and the bbq fingers had so much sauce on them you couldn't even eat them in public.   We literally ate 1 and 2 fingers each, a few of the fries, and a few cheese sticks. We are now sipping on our sodas to fill up because we threw most the order in the trash.   Just gross. Don't do it."}
{"text":"Horrible food. Pizza had very little sauce and really greasy. Spaghetti was overcooked and mushy. Took 1 hour to deliver to the front desk of our hotel."}
{"text":"We order from here at least once a week. Their calzones are so good. I always order a Philly cheese steak calzone and add garlic and ricotta cheese.  The customer service is always good and my order is always fresh and hot.   I definitely recommend it. Plus their open until 6am for when you get the late night munchies!"}
{"text":"So good the food. Definitely ordering again when I go back to Las Vegas the 24\" pizza was so good and the fries were good too and my husband really like the chicken fettuccine alfredo was good"}
{"text":"It's 2AM and I get a craving for pizza. Search my options and find this place delivers all night. I ordered a 3 topping for about $8, decent prices. They said it would take about 45mins-hour, it arrived in about 35 minutes which is super pleasing given my appetite! The pizza was actually really good! It wasn't too greasy, had great flavor, and it was HOT. I really like how they chop up the jalapeños so the heat doesn't overpower the other toppings. Overall I'm pleased. I would recommend to anyone with middle of the night pizza cravings."}
{"text":"This place will steal your money. Missing an item from my grubhub order and the guy is very rude, won't remake the item nor refund me for my purchase. Do not pay ahead if time, do not tip ahead of time, make surev to check your order before you pay. It better yet, just don't patronize this establishment."}
