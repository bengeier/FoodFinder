{"text":"This was the first AYCE Japanese restaurant location I experienced before it was taken over and the name changed to MASA after the renovation.  The previous set up was terrible as there was a buffet bar in the middle with food that sat there too long.  Since the reno, they changed the format to order sheets and the food is much fresher but the quality is not quite as good as other similar restaurants (especially now with so much competition around).  The selection is also not as good as other AYCE places but the decor and atmosphere is decent and service is good.  The rolls have too much rice which is designed to fill you up and the sashimi is average grade.  Overall a 2.5-3 star restaurant for value, quality, selection and service."}
{"text":"I am sorry to say that their service is very bad and coupled with the terrible food this is the only restaurant I will make a point to never return.

I've been there frequently as a college student since it was near campus and during that time we found it alright...

But after a few years when I took my parents there, I told my dad not to tip them because nobody came to seat us for 10 whole minutes of us standing in the foyer. And people were walking past us, and the chefs on the left making sashimi could clearly see us there too.

We left under 10% but there isn't much service for it was an all you can eat, and they never remembered to refill our tea.

So the waitress lady came back out with the bill and basically tried to guilt trip my dad into tipping more - saying the tip is shared between the chefs and servers and blah blah.

Which made it look even worse...if the tip is so important then just include it in the bill...running back out like that trying to argue for tips is just....

After that I swore to never go back.

Alas a few months later a friend who lived nearby that area suggested it even though we both agreed that the service is bad, the all-you-can-eat price was fine for quantity eating (vs quality).

So I reluctantly gave it another go.

And the sashimi was just horrible. I am usually a huge fan of sashimi but I was just disgusted. And all the fried stuff (chicken, calamari) were cold.

And well...not that it matters since the same can be said for the majority of sushi places in Toronto, but this place is run by Chinese people who don't really know much about Japanese cuisine.

Don't be fooled by their nice decor...you'll notice that the place is 80% empty most of the time, dinner and lunch hours."}
{"text":"This is my workplace's go-to for an AYCE sushi lunch.

It has a decent kitchen selection, so that people who don't love raw fish can eat something too.

The service is spotty, sometimes slow (forget your order), and of course the lunch menu excludes sashimi and ice cream, but the rolls are yummy, well made, and tightly rolled.

Can't comment on anything else (dinner, teppanyaki), but for $11 on a weekday lunch, I'm happy."}
{"text":"Although the restaurants interiors was comfortable, our party of four felt cheated by the restaurant. We choose the Deluxe Menu at 21.99 rather than the Regular 18.99 because of the spider roll. When we followed up on the spider roll and BBQ eel roll, illogical and inconsistent lies followed. (supplier deliveries, being made takes longer) The sushi was alright and crumbly makis. At the end, no apologies and no acknowledgement of the deceit. At the end we even had to explain our tip amount!"}
{"text":"This used to be my go to sushi spot. 
Did management change? The service was terrible...the food subpar. I will not be returning anytime soon. I clearly need a new go to."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Masa for years.  The price is right and I have always had great service.  

The food has gone a little downhill recently.  The salmon seems to  be cut thinner and more raggedy...the sushi not cut in a uniform manner.  The tempura is hit and miss.  Sometimes hot, crunchy and tasty...at other times flaccid and greasy.

Though the decor hasn't changed in years and needs a little sprucing up, I love the ambience.  They have that diffused lighting that makes *everyone* look gorgeous.  Great place to meet your blind date...lol!"}
{"text":"Apparently they have a secret lunch menu that changes daily!  The friends I was with knew to ask for it: $7 for a set lunch, your choice of four specials.  I couldn't finish my sushi, though I can't lie, if the food had been better, I would have.  (Not that it was bad! It was just average.)"}
{"text":"One of the worst sushi experiences I've ever had. Smaller portions and lower quality food is to be expected with AYCE but this was a joke. For instance I ordered pan friend beef udon and it came with not a single piece of beef. It was the first time in my life I actually told people walking into the restaurant to go somewhere else the food was so terrible. 

I guess since this is built into a hotel it preys on tourists that don't know any better, but there are so many other sushi restaurants in the area I implore you to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went to Masa Sushi for their AYCE with my friends and we were all really disappointed. The service was really slow and getting the food requires determined effort.  We had to repeatedly remind the serve to get our orders. Finally, it took more than 45 minutes for the sushi to come. However, the sushi fell apart which I picked it up by chopsticks; the sashimi was warm and that just gross. Will never come back again."}
{"text":"It kind of seems arbitrary to have a sushi buffet.   A lot of Japanese food is already created in portion sizes and there is no need to eat an excess amount of sushi.

When you make an order at Masa, you have to eat what you purchase or you will be charged for each piece that you do not consume.  It adds to the tackiness of their buffet.  If you eat all of your food, you can always order more with no extra cost.

I was impressed by the decor of this place and the service.  The sushi quality is okay, but not anything better."}
{"text":"Service was extremely poor.  A big group of co-workers go for their lunch buffet.  Missed our order.  Had to chase them up 3 times.  Food didn't show an hour later and made us late for work.  

The food was below average.  When we pay our bill, the waitress confronted us that we only gave a 10% tips which they didn't even deserve.  She said 15% is the minimum and gave us attitude.  

This place went straight to my black list."}
{"text":"Went here for my friend's birthday dinner. We decided to do the teppanyaki dinner. Not a big fan of their entrance, it kinda sketch me out for some reason, but once we got into the dining area, they're nicely decorated; it's probably one of the better decorated Japanese restaurant. It ALMOST give you a fine dining restaurant feel to it.

I chose dinner set B for $18 which include miso soup, salad, salmon roll, cucumber roll, beef fried rice, 3 pieces of shrimp, striploin steak, chicken, veggies, and ice cream. For $18 I think that's a really good deal. When the chef brought out the meat and veggies, they all LOOKED fresh and didn't seem to come from frozen state.

- The miso soup was a little too salty for my liking
- The salad was probably the worst salad I've ever eaten. Not sure what kind of dressing they used, it taste ok, but they OVER-dressed the salad. I kid you not, it was like a veggie SOUP! I didn't finish my salad...
- The salmon and cucumber roll taste pretty standard
- The shrimp tasted ok
- The veggies (red pepper, mushroom, zucchini, and onions) tasted fine. One major disappointment: the chef didn't do the onion volcano trick
- The chicken was good, the sauce is a little too salty.
- They don't use the best quality meat for the steak, but understandable for $18 meal. It seemed like the chef under-seasoned the steak, but I think this happened because he served us the really salty teriyaki chicken right before the steak, so it overpowers the meat taste.
- I substituted the beef fried rice with regular steam rice.

Our waitress was quite attentive throughout the dinner service. I think the owner or maybe just a manager dealt with our food order and payments. The service was really good and fast except when we asked for our bills, it took them quite a while to give it to us.

After tax and tips, I spent $25 in total for my own bill and I think the whole dining experience and the amount of food they give are quite a bargain. It's a lot cheaper than what you have to pay at Benihana. It's definitely one of the better teppanyaki place I've been to."}
{"text":"OMG !  i went around Jan 2015 and I gave it 3 stars.  I went again, this time around mid-June and OMG, if I could give it a 0 star, or better -3 star, I would !  (Anyone knows if they changed management and cooks or what ?!)  The sashimi pieces were so tiny, you can blow them away if you breath harder.  The wasabi paste looked green, but had no wasabi flavor at all.  Whatever we had order, they gave us half of it.  The grill eggplant used to have those fish shaving for flavor, gone.  The chicken wings used to be semi decent size, gone, we got only tiny ones, guess they could be from spring chickens !  All the fried food were over breaded and over fried.  They tried really hard to cut corners, I honestly cannot say I was happy with any food that I ordered, it was that bad !  We finally gave up and thought, oh well, lets get ice cream and head out.  I could not believe even the ice cream was bad, it looked fine, but when I tried it, it was only ice, no cream at all.  

I will NOT go back again and personally would NOT recommend anyone to try this place."}
{"text":"Just another Japanese restaurant. I'd give four stars for the all you can eat sushi. Come during weekdays (except Friday) for lunch, the selection won't disappoint you."}
{"text":"I went to Masa for lunch and they don't serve sashimi or shrimp tempura for lunch. Huge disappointment."}
{"text":"Masa has a beautiful atmosphere and interior. From my experience the decor was the highlight. I really enjoyed the bar and back area. 
We had the ayce sushi lunch for just $13. For the price I would say the food was average. The sushi was OK to Good. We usually go to ayce sushi for dinner and have become used to  more options. 

I was a bit annoyed about the advertised Yelp check-in discount of 10% only being offered  on take out. Seemed a little counter intuitive, but for $13 you can't expect much of a discount.   

In addition they stop serving lunch at 3. We arrived at 2, and luckily order everything except dessert. Needless to say that could have been a problem. Of course we were offered dessert, but I can't imagine being half way through a meal only to find the kitchen was closed.

I much prefer the ayce sy Fushimi on Church St."}
{"text":"I went here for a friend's birthday party. My other friend and I were late so when we got into the plave we waited outside to see if any host would come and bring us to my friend's table. We weren't the only one outside, I saw bunch of groups too. We waited for a while but no one came, so my friend and I decided to go inside and look for our friend instead. When we got to there table, they were seated in a large table (L shaped) where they do teppanyaki. My friend and I were seating on the other side of the table when a lady gestured to the waiter and they were speaking in Chinese, it seems like she didn't want us to sit on that side. We told her that we're part of the group, she seemed not happy about it. She left and came back with two people who we didn't know at all. She told them that they can sit on our table!! We were all SHOCKED!! First of all that table was reserved for my friends birthday party, second she didn't ask us if we're okay to put someone in our table, third we didn't even have enough seat for the entire group!! I dont know who she is in that restaurant because she wasn't wearing a uniform, she was wearing some sort of grey yoga pants and loose top. I dont think she knows the word PROFESSIONALISM and ETIQUETTE cause she seems LACKING on those aspect!!

There bad service did not just stop there.. we waited for a long time for our server to gave us the papaer for all you can eat that we had to do it ourselves!! We took the paper on the cabinet behind us and we also had to get our chopsticks from it. After several gestures to catch the server's attention, we finally gave him our order. We got our food pretty fast but we realized that we didn't get all that we ordered so we wrote a new one on another paper. Same thing had happened we only got our sushi but we didnt get our tempura order!! 

Our experience was really terrible and I dont think I will ever go back here!! They have lots of options but that doesnt mean that you'll get what u ordered you're lucky if u get half of what u ordered!! It's just frustrating to write our order over and over again for us to actually get it!! And for the price of $33 it's NOT worth it at all!! You can try FUSHIMA or KATSU they are wayyyyyu better than Masa!!"}
{"text":"It looks pretty impressive when you walk in at 9:30 pm on a Friday night. We were seated and we had more interaction with the bus boy who just started working there then the server who took our drink order and then we never saw again. I had to get up and look for someone to place my order,weird!! The quality of food was poor and so was the service. I had to get the busboy to send the wasabi back because it was brown and crusty looking like it had been out all night or came from someones else's plate. I knew I was in trouble!

I have had better sushi from a box at Loblaw's which is still terrible. My friend left a $10.00 tip which we are still auguring about till this day. He is a lot nicer then I am the most annoying part was when we were paying the bill $49.00/tip -2 people(servers) came by and asked us if we wanted ice cream with big smiles on there face.I had not idea who they were?? Not impressed!!! Not worth $59.00."}
{"text":"I would say that I'd give this place 3.5, but I'm rounding it up to four, cause the last couple of times I came, it was really very good. I have only ever been here for the All You Can Eat.

+Decent prices, even for dinner it's not unreasonable
+ Fairly large selection
+The last two times I went it was VERY fresh (the time before that was over a year ago, so I am giving them the benefit of the doubt)
+ Good service
+ Delicious, DELICIOUS tempura
~I didn't order a lot of sushi, my friend and I love the teriyaki dishes and tempura and edamame, etc, so I can't fully review the sushi, but what we had was good
+I really liked the salmon sashimi
-Didn't like the red bean ice cream
-Like I said, one time, a year ago, it didn't taste that fresh, but the past two times have been good

Overall a good experience- I will go back. Also- lots of seating! Yay."}
{"text":"Doing another routine visit to Masa for a late lunch /  early dinner. Service was faster than before and the food was brought out quickly. The meal was delicious . I've read some of the reviews and I was specific in keeping common complaints in mind but there was nothing that re-occurred which would tell me that the common complaints were erratic anomalies.  The past complaints and ratings are valid and the restaurant owners need to see them. There is always room for improvement."}
{"text":"We got the ayce menu with very limited food selections. The sushi had too much rice and it tasted stale.To top it off, I decided to open it up and take some of the rice out to find out they have given me the spicy california roll with rotten avocados (note: the avocados looked fine on both sides but the rotten part was all hidden inside of it) not only that, some of the stuff I ordered was forgotten about and service was pretty slow. This isn't the worst sushi place I have eaten at but it does come second place. Don't think I'll be coming back since I did want to try the teppanyaki there."}
{"text":"Not bad for AYCE sushi. Biggest complaint is a limited menu. Great service, though."}
{"text":"Amazing service. Dropped by to ask about the Teppenyaki, and was wowed by their friendliness and stayed for lunch!

Booked a reservation for my birthday and I am excited! Great Place!"}
{"text":"Restaurant japonais avec formule à volonté, le Masa offre un cadre avec lumière tamisée et beaucoup d'espace. Pour commander son menu vous spécifiez le nombre de pièces désirées et on vous les servira en 5 minutes.
Service rapide et attentioné.
Attention pas de refill sur les sodas mais bon à ce prix là on va pas râler."}
{"text":"Masa Sushi had come under new management a while ago and I think the quality went up since then.
There is ample seating and the servers are polite.
For my father's birthday, they brought complementary cheesecake and tea.
The selection is very good, and I would say that the lunch selection is not that different from the dinner menu (though the dinner menu does have a few more choices, I don't miss them when I do lunch).
Save a few bucks and go for a late lunch; with AYCE, you won't want dinner!
This place is good, consistent, made fresh to order (I'm over buffets!).
I've only been to the Yonge-Bloor location and my family from the suburbs requests it when we come downtown."}
{"text":"lunch menu is just as short as my weiner dog's legs nowadays.
still the same price of 11.99 without any sashimi or shrimp tempura.

alright, to be honest when i go to AYCE sushi buffet I don't seek for quality. I just want to shove my face into salmon sashimi so I won't have crave for next 3 month. but at MASA
I can't even go for quantity cause simply, even to my not so picky tongue, their sushi is unbearable. it wasn't so bad until last year, as far as I remember...but when I was there last week for a quick bite with my friend during lunch hrs, we were their 1st customer and rice was horried. dry, tasteless and must have been squeezed with anger cause they were too hard. I dont know what's the deal with their fish but they were all tasteless.

still keeping the good work with kitchen food, not TOO bad.
and two stars for friendly server.

I don't think I'll go back during lunch hours ever again. but may be for dinner I'll give it a try once more."}
{"text":"Masa was a staple of AYCE sushi in Toronto before places like Aji Sai and Wasabi.  The place offers a wide variety of sushi and cooked food.  It also has a full drink menu and the service is rather quick.  The servers are fairly fast and get your orders down quickly.  

The ambiance and decor are great inside and it looks like a high end music video.  The place is a bit dimly lit, but it adds to the look of the interior.  Washrooms are clean as well, which is a plus at any AYCE restaurant! 

I always get the usual choices of sashimi along with fried scallops and beef slices.  The best thing about this place is that they rarely run out of anything on their AYCE menu.  I will be coming back again when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Came here for the all you can eat lunch with 6 other people to celebrate a birthday and they put us in this fairly large room where there was no one else in there, which meant that the waitress rarely came in and we had a hard time flagging someone down. Apparently only ONE waitress was working the entire restaurant and the food took more than half an hour to come for the first time we ordered. The second time we submitted our order sheets, only the sushi came out and were waiting for another 30+ minutes for the cooked foods only to find out that they screwed up by losing our order sheet. Never coming back here again after this experience and mediocre quality of sushi with too much rice."}
{"text":"Food: 6/10 ---- Value: 7/10 ---- Service: 7/10 ---- Ambiance/Décor: 8/10

The food here is nothing to write home about. It's typical cheap all-you-can-eat sushi where the fish is thinly sliced and wherever they can throw in more rice, they do. In that sense, you get what you pay for and it's downtown. Service was average and the restaurant itself was nice and clean.

The green tea ice cream was a complete fail. I don't even know what that was, but it didn't taste like green tea at all. I guess Green Mystery Flavour. 

If you're just looking to get full with the general taste of sushi, this place is not bad. You just have to manage your expectations and know that you're not coming here for quality."}
{"text":"This place isn't bad for an all you can eat sushi place. The sushi itself can be hit or miss (just ask them to make fresh Tempura for the sushi) and they normally oblige. 

You can probably get better sushi other places in the city, but for an all you can eat place they have good service and okay food. 

It's also a good price.

__________

Update: March 18th. Just did the Masa trek again today. Today the sushi was \"on\" and fresh. I even got some free red bean ice-cream out of it. 

Tip- its not on the buffet menu, but sometimes they will give you a bowl for free!"}
{"text":"Good food and service... the service is really good, and I really enjoyed their green tea while having my sushi. Great for group gatherings, as they have some large tables.
I would go back to try more dishes!"}
{"text":"Worst sushi I've ever had.

I stumbled in here with a friend, having walked by it numerous times. It's a surprisingly big restaurant and it was relatively busy for a Wednesday night, which I incorrectly assumed was a good sign.

We opted not to do the all-you-can-eat and instead ordered some sushi dishes off the regular menu. Prices were reasonable and the meals sounded good. 

Things started off alright with the soup and salad. But when the sushi came everything went downhill. None of the fish tasted at all fresh. But what really killed it was that the tuna was simply BAD. It tasted absolutely rotted to the point that we couldn't eat it. Both my sushi and my friend's tuna rolls were basically inedible. 

The server was nice enough to ask if the tuna roll was OK. I told him it was bad and he offered to bring us a new one, but at that point I'd lost my appetite.

There are far better sushi places very close to this place. There's no reason I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"A horrible, horrible death trap of a restaurant. 

Okay, so my mother and I will once in a while go for lunch to one those HUGE, warehouse sized all-you-can-eat pseudo-Chinese places you find in the suburbs. She likes going there, as the selection is not bad, if you are looking for your typical  'Mandarin' restaurant styled food. Although the pseudo-Chinese food is alright, I normally only go for fish, clams and shrimp which tend to be the least badly cooked items. Having said that, you just know their sushi selection and quality can range from either abysmal to just 'brilliantly insulting to Japanese culture.'

But then again, you are going for the pseudo-Chinese food not Japanese. Now imagine someone trying to transport that same concept to a hotel at Charles and Yonge. Except not as big, and only offers the Japanese food. 

Now the odd thing about this place is that the decor is completely modern and serviceable. You get a good vibe going in except the place was deserted when we got there. Also if you ever go for AYCE, there is generally something quite subpar about the whole food presentation which you pretty much have to accept. Just like another restaurant called Wild Ginger, which has since last time I checked been mercifully taken out of it's misery and closed. 

Like the tempura was just too greasy and the selection is limited. Sometimes you can taste that they are not using a good cut of meat, or rather a very cheap cut of meat. One of my chicken dishes tasted like the chicken was a bit old. You know that sort of overly dried with an infinitesimal sourish flavour that you just know they are trying to hide by bathing it in Teriyaki sauce... Yup, that.

I remember not feeling all that well after eating here. Not that I got sick but I definitely felt the place had tried to cut a few too many corners in food quality and like eating a McDonald's burger, you sometimes feel not too good, perhaps a little wretched about yourself after having eaten it. 

 Which is pretty bad as you can get decent AYCE in many places in Toronto for about the same price and a lot better quality."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times, mostly for Teppanyaki which is great so I would recommend dining here for that as the prices and portions are very reasonable and the taste has never disappointed.

I was quite let down by my recent dining experience here for sushi and will likely never return.  Bento boxes were mediocre with quite small portions compared to similar venues.  Service was too slow for quite a non-peak time although our server was very earnest and eager...perhaps too eager as when I paid my bill, he made the assumption that no change was needed and exclaimed \"thanks for coming!\" as he walked away with what he determined to be a 29% tip!  I was like no way I'm leaving, I'm going to sit here and wait for my change.  I waited...waited...waited until my husband said I don't think he's doing anything, the change has been put away.  At that point, I decided that what the hell, I'll just leave and then he comes back looking all puzzled and says \"miss, did you want your change?\"  Excuse me?!  Yes, I wanted my change.  You should've brought it out automatically without making assumptions.  And now you have the audacity to accuse me of wanting my change and right to freely tip as I please?!  Unbelievable.  Nothing annoys me more than this.  Sure, he offered good service but not good enough to rob me blind.  Seriously no reason to come back here.  

Servers take note: if you offered good service, trust that you'll be appreciated accordingly.  There's no need to steal from your patrons.  Thanks."}
{"text":"This place is really the definition of OK.  Really average sushi, average sushi, average selection. The all you can eat menu basically only has salmon.  I went here a lot until I discovered other places, and it was really consistently OK.  Now that I've discovered other places like Aji Sai, I don't think I'll be going back

With so many other great spots not too far from here, I wouldn't bother with Masa.  It won't be bad, but it definitely wont be very good."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place many times (10+). This time it killed it for me. When we came for dinner (6:45pm) there was a couple of people there. We where seated and then the waitress came over and we asked if they served COKE or PEPSI. She had no idea what we where talking about.  We ordered all you can eat dinner. The rolls came, they where a little bit warm and they where falling apart. We finished them and waited for about 10 more minutes to see if our food would come. Normally they are fast about the food. The waitress came over and said it would be another 10 minutes, because they are washing the floors and the only dish that they make all the food in. So this would take 30 minutes for the food to come. As most people know that Sushi and Teppanyaki dose not take a long time to make. I was floored that washing the floor and cleaning one pot most more import anted then the customers food. Most kitchens clean there floors at the end of the day. I didn't want to wait anymore for the food. so we asked for the bill. the manager charged me for one all you can eat. I said we didn't eat a full meal. Well i only charged  you for one. We ate about less then 20 sushis and meso soup and small garden salad and one pepsi and a beer. She actually was changeling me on the bill. NEVER NEVER WILL I EAT THERE AGAIN. HORRIBLE SERVICE AND GOT CHARGED $32 bucks for nothing.."}
{"text":"This is one of the better decorated sushi restaurants I've been to. It's HUGE inside. Service was good too. I normally don't care much about service but I was pretty impressed by the mannerism of the server we had. This is in contrast to many other Chinese owned sushi places that place more emphasis on price and where the servers don't speak English well so they avoid unnecessary contact with you. This place is owned by Chinese so it proves that not all Asian restaurants don't care about service and atmosphere.

As for the food itself, it can be summarized as acceptable. I eat sushi often so it's pretty hard to WOW me. We had the Fuyu bento and the Take sushi combo. Like other restaurants it comes with salad and miso soup. The kitchen stuff like chicken and skewers were decent but I thought the meat was slightly dry (ok maybe I'm being too picky?) The sushi were ok in terms of rice to fish ratio. Not the best sushi I've had but far from the worst. The salmon in the hand roll was pretty fresh and it wasn't stuffed with tons of rice like many other places. Pretty happy with the meal. 

They have AYCE sushi so maybe I'll give it a try next time. I saw the AYCE menu and there isn't anything on there that amazes me but the closest AYCE sushi place from here is Natural sushi and I'm confident Masa will beat them with ease. They also have Tenpanyaki so maybe I should try that too. 

Prices are on point. I expected a fancy place like this to have higher prices but amazingly I find their prices reasonable. It's definitely not the cheapest but it's far from expensive for a sushi place. So on the basis of good food and acceptable prices, I can recommend Masa Sushi to anyone."}
{"text":"I was quickly meeting some out of town friends for an early lunch and we decided to venture into here since everything else in the area was closed.  I guess they had JUST opened when we got there because the floors were still being mopped and the entire place smelled like chlorine bleach.  We were tempted to go elsewhere but we didn't have much time and didn't want to have to find another place open at that time (11am).

Oh how I wish we had gone elsewhere! 

The Teriyaki chicken was delicious but that is all the place had going for it. We ordered some sushi off the AYCE menu and I don't think it was even freshly prepared that day. Honestly, it was the worst sushi I've had in my life. If we hadn't been running on a short schedule I would have insisted we return the food and not pay for it.  Everything about the sushi was so stale I started to suspect that they had just given us leftovers from the day before.  We ate what we could and opted to just pay for the pieces we couldn't eat, rather than put ourselves through any more.  I've had sushi from the grocery store that was fresher than what they served here. 

Never, ever going back."}
{"text":"Won't be going back. I had the AYCE dinner.

1) The rolls are incredibly ricey - very little filling. I could literally barely see filling in some of my rolls - all rice. I can't believe how little fish I was given (other than sashimi). Me any my friends ordered quite a variety and we were very disappointed  by quality and taste. Pre-packed sushi at supermarkets is better tasting. 
2) The other food in general we ordered was quite ill prepared in comparison to other comparable price point AYCE places. 
3) Incredibly slow service in a fairly empty space. 
4) Servers were ok - nothing out of the ordinary in a negative or positive way.

Here's my issue with AYCE - if you are going to offer it, do it with some quality or it brings down the value of your whole restaurant.

I have been here a few times before, but it was a little while ago - it was better the. From what I could see there has been a management change."}
{"text":"Edit: This place is only recommended for beginners.  Sushi quality is subpar.

Went here for a coworkers b-day since a bunch of people recommended it.  

I wasn't that impressed but wasn't hating the place either. 

Decor: 4/5 - very nice elegant place.  

Food: 2.5/5 - yes I know that's precise but I feel like it doesn't deserve a 3.  The maki rolls were prepared nicely and all the spicy rolls have the right level of spiciness without too much filling.  Also, the miso soup was nice.  As for the sushi itself, it wasn't bad, but it didn't taste as fresh as I would like it to.  Not terrible, but not great either.

Would I go here again? I'd probably hesitate a bit, but it's a decent choice if you and your coworkers want some AYCE."}

The venue of this place is cute. It's down the street from me, never noticed it till I seen it on Yelp( yay)  I was so hungry, I couldn't wait to eat. 

There menu is huge! So many options but I wasn't feeling adventurous at this new restaurant. I ordered my regular green dragon, dynamite and spider roll.

My nose is fairly strong when its not stuffy from allergies. I couldn't stand the smell of my rolls along with the taste. They all were mushy, bland and old tasting. I went here around lunch? Maybe that had something to do with it, I couldn't even finish all the rolls because it had a weird odour. 

Ill try this place again if nothing else is open in the area, sometimes it's good to have lots of options on the menu, but in this case, I question lol"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS FOOD! WILL GO BACK FOR THE ALL YOU CAN EAT!
We all had the all you can eat.

PRICE: $11.99 (Sunday) for each person

SUSHI was delicious! The butterfish melted in my mouth. Soooo good. Red snapper, salmon, spicy salmon, ...all the sushi was good! (Must finish all the rice or there is a fee)

HOT FOOD: CHICKEN TERIYAKI was pretty good. It had crispy skin on it, which I really enjoyed. TOFU TEMPORA was delicious!! I had 3 orders. CHICKEN KARAGE was not as authentic as I've had before, but it was pretty good. My friends thought it tasted like a japanese chicken nugget. My friends had the BEEF RICE and they both liked it. The beef rice didn't have a lot of beef. It was a little scoop of beef teriyaki on top of a full bowl of rice, so if you don't want to get filled up on rice..don't order it. TAKOYAKI was ok. For my taste I didn't really like it, although I've never had it before. My friend has had it before and she said she has had better. Although we did order seconds of it. DUMPLINGS were good, according to my friend.
However, the amounts we put down to order wasn't the amount the came out. I'm not sure if the kitchen was trying to portoin control us, but it was all you could eat, so we just ordered more


Green tea was good.

SERVICE: Great. Very attentive."}
{"text":"Recently, I felt like getting some sushi, so I went over the weekend to get some sushi at Masa. It was my second time there. The first time was a couple of months back, and it was a good experience, so I thought about going a second time. 

First thing you notice when you're outside the restaurant is the AYCE sign they put up it's $12.95 for weekend lunches, and was a bold in your face typeset so you couldn't miss it, which was a decent price. Think it's 12-3 pm are the time for the AYCE lunch time sushi, so if you want that price better plan ahead or else you might just miss the time.

When you're walking in, the decor and ambiance of the place does have modern and contemporary feel to it, it's clean and welcoming. Service was fast, the waitress was there in 20 second and showed me to my seat. There wasn't many customer that day, which was Saturday lunch time, so service was prompt and courteous.

The waitress that seated me was a nice lady and explained the menu items and how I should order. So I started with the Miso soup, which is a good item to start with. The soup came promptly, no complaints there, I didn't remember any of my orders being late, so thumbs up to the chefs and staff. Service was good that day. :)

Sashimi was another extra $3, but I didn't opt for that and just went for the usual AYCE without the sashimi option. The menu was very limited to what I've seen at other places, but it's comparable, but limited. No problem, because it's what I would have ordered the same stuff anyways. I seldom stray far from my usual menu selection until I see something worth trying.

They had a lobster soup that I ordered, wasn't what I expected, it was a soup. But no lobster meat in it. Might just be lobster flavour, but definitely NO lobster meat in there.

On to the meat and potatoes of my review, I then started to order my sushi and rolls. Nothing special, there wasn't a lot to choose from to begin with I think I ordered salmon, white fish and butter fish sushi. And a couple of sushi rolls. Can't really recall too much, but it was good, and nothing stands out or was really memorable. Presentation good, and the sushi tasted was fresh, like what you expect from other sushi places. No dirty or broken dishes to worry, either.

I did noticed that their sushi pieces were on the small side of things. Meaning, that they could have had larger sashimi pieces on the sushi. Good thing was that the rice was smaller compared to the overall sushi pieces. So no loss there. I just loaded it up the 2nd round. I ordered the usual green dragon, gold dragon, salmon avocado, and shrimp tempura sushi. Again, good presentation, and tasted great. Shrimp tempura sushi was my favorite for that day.

Mmmmm..... tasty, nom, nom, nom - as Homer Simpson would elegantly put it. After 2 rounds of orders, I was feeling stuffed. I then ventured into the desserts. It was slim pickings there, so I asked the waitress if I could get one scoop of ice cream for each of the 4 flavours they had, which was red bean, green tea, mango and ginger. Surprisingly, the ice cream was great, was expecting the green tea to such this time around, but it was good. Tasted fresh, though a bit frozen, the ginger and mango tasted the best, green tea was third, followed by red bean ice cream.

Definitely recommend people try this place out, if you want affordable sushi and good service - Give this place a shot. Nothing spectacular, limited menu items, good service, at an affordable price. I had two rounds of 25+ sushi pieces and was stuffed, compared to sushi plates that you buy at the supermarket, I would say the AYCE would be the better value, fresh and cheaper."}
{"text":"Mediocre, won't go back. Food was alright, worth the price certainly, but the service was notably slow, so much so that I have to make a point of saying it. Our waitress also had to ask what I ordered 3 times. Too many other, better sushi joints in the neighborhood to waste your time here."}
{"text":"Decent Japanese food at a reasonable price. The service is a little lacking, though."}
{"text":"Masa's iiiiigh. 

It's AYCE (note: very limited selection compared to Aji Sai or Sushi D); $11.99 for a Friday lunch. Unfortunately, the sushi kept falling apart... 

Great decor though! Saw a wedding reception take place today."}
{"text":"my husband and i love hibachi, so we've tried out this place quite a few times. prices are average for the area, but we've never been blown away by the food. the staff is very grumpy and slow. if i wanted teppanyaki in downtown toronto, this would be my go-to place, but i'd prefer to wait until we leave the city for better service and more reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I am actually surprised I haven't reviewed this place yet, since I have been going for years for the AYCE sushi lunch.

The All you can eat lunch is a good deal for 10.99 - there are lots of rolls and a few sushi options, plus some teriyaki, dumplings, and other hot offerings. I've always been satisfied with the food quality.

Service is meh, but you'll get everything you ordered, just don't go if you're in a rush. The good news is, it's a big place, the biggest in the area, so you will find a table.

They also have a back room with the teppanyaki table (where they cook in front of you ala Benihana). That's perfectly fine too, I just don't like returning to work smelling like a Japanese kitchen."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this restaurant for 3 yrs or so. Its not a bad place, basically good substitute for uptown all you can eat sushi alternatives. 

Among the downtown sushi all you can eat, I'd say they have the best quality. Fresh sashimi and rolls. However, their choices of dishes is somewhat lacking, only few types of rolls and the standard teriyaki chicken/beef/salmon. 

Price decently for weekdays and wouldn't be worth the money during weekends. The mood is not bad, worth giving it a try during weekdays. But if you have the method and time to go uptown, I'd say just skip it."}
{"text":"The menu has changed a lot since the last time I was here, a few years ago...somehow its really skimmed down.  However the atmosphere is very tres tres Japanese! the menu is quite diverse, and the staff are always friendly...Great place, but I'm still searching for a better sushi dive around the Yonge and Bloor area."}
{"text":"Huge restaurant inside even though it looks tiny from the street. The ambiance is great inside, nice lighting and modern layout. Good lunch ayce price as well. Service can be slow though especially when they are really busy, so perhaps come a bit earlier or later for their lunch/dinner crushes."}
{"text":"I came here from a recommendation of this place, what a waste!  The drinks they offer in there menu they didn't seem to have, the condiments in the drinks we finally did get were old and expired and to top it all off when the sushi finally came out it was all rice with very little fish!   After speaking to the \"manager\" of the restaurant he agreed that the sushi was horrible and that he had to change the chefs. He offered to take away the sushi, which we agreed to but then the manager expected us to still pay for the sushi even though we didn't eat it.  Never again will we come back to this establishment, maybe back in the day this place had some decent food, but not anymore.  Such a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Party of 15 for all-you-can eat sushi dinner:
+ staff was friendly
- staff were highly disorganized: (1) they lost our reservation, (2) they never knew which section of the party ordered which sushi, (3) they forgot a few of our orders because they lost our order sheet, (4) they did not inform us until much later that an order we were waiting for was not in stock
- quality of sushi was mediocre 
- brought out everyone's ice cream on a single plate (yes there were 15 scoops of ice cream on one plate) 
- claimed that the service charge was 15%, but we calculated it ourselves and it was actually 22%; we brought it to their attention and they recalculated it claiming it was now 15% (but of course we had already calculated what should be 15% and it was actually only reduced to 20%);  we were so frustrated at this point that we just wanted to get out of there so we paid"}
{"text":"I was told that this place is great for both the food and price so me and my sister went to check it out. I hated this place instantly as we stepped in coz the staffs were rude, no greetings and we weren't seated after 2-3 minutes. The menu for AYCE was limited! When the sushi came, the rice was super thick, as if they were meant to choke you to death. The waitress were super rude. I hate this place. Definitely not going back!  Overall, the only good thing is the price. Food and service, super bad!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend on Wednesday night because I told him I'd been craving sushi all evening. I had even been looking up websites of all the Japanese and Sushi places in the North York Centre area just so I could go try out a place for lunch the next day.
Well, he suggested we go to a Teppanyaki place around Church St, hence we ended up going to Masa. I think we got there around 10pm, and to my relief the Teppanyaki section of the restaurant was closed for the night, since I had been considering sushi other more common Japanese eats to be the only comfort food to satisfy my cravings for it that evening :-) so we decided to going for an A La Carte sushi dinner.
We ordered the Agedashi Tofu, the Rare Beef Sushi, Gold Dragon Roll, and the Spider Roll. Out of the four items we had, I loved the Agedashi Tofu and the Gold Dragon Roll were my favorites. The Rare Beef Sushi for me was rather something new but I felt like it good have looked better, as indicated in the picture, it just looked slightly scrunched up and I was glad I put a healthy dose of the wasabi on each piece that I ate.
For a late night meal it was satisfying and filling enough. I've read some of the other reviews for this place and most of them emphasizing on the lack of quality in some of the components for most of the dishes, but for me I guess my first time there was just good enough. I wanted sushi on a Wednesday evening and that restaurant helped :-)"}
{"text":"Completely disappointed with Masa's all-you-can-eat sushi lunch. To begin, this place has the shortest AYCE menu I've ever seen... It's limited to the basics, with no sashimi (or even an option to pay more and include sashimi).

Taste-wise, the sushi was decent. However, the rolls were so sloppily made that we ended up having to pick them up with our hands and pour soya sauce directly onto them to avoid making a huge, rice-y mess (even though we're good with chopsticks). The tempura was good.

Service was HORRIBLE. Our waitress was misinformed, slow, and shockingly rude. First, she told me the dumplings and spring rolls were vegetarian, but I learned the hard way that they weren't. She took her time bringing us water, as well as our second round of orders (probably so we'd get full and stop ordering). WORST PART... As the five of us paid separately, she hassled each of us about a \"service charge,\" telling us it was restaurant policy to add 15%... Even going so far as to SLIDE A LOONIE AWAY from my friend's change. With no written mention of the charge, we confronted her, at which point she insisted that she had given us good service, so we HAD to leave at least a dollar. We dropped some change and started walking out. I considered complaining, but saw that she was already speaking with the manager who gave us a dirty look. Needless to say, she was tacky as hell, and I will never be returning to this embarrassment to Japanese cuisine."}
{"text":"Went there with 2 friends on Sunday for early dinner.  The cost was $22 plus tax for all you can eat.  

Pros: 
- pretty cheap for sushi

Cons:
- nothing outstanding
- not fresh (frozen)

Food:
- The food is good, nothing amazing.  We had all you can eat, so I will put some things I noticed
- Sushi - They do not have Tuna, Most of the sushi is based salmon and shrimp.  I ordered some sashimi, and some it came frozen
- Teriyaki - The beef and chicken are tasty, but it is noticeable that high quality meet is not used.
- Desert - They got good ice cream, they do not have deep friend bananas as other places do

Service:
- They seem to be understaffed. There are only a few waitresses, which makes time to order food and get it a bit above average.  When I ordered ice cream, she forgot to bring a spoon, which she noticed and said she was going to bring it right away.  5 minutes later I had to remind her again

Locale: decent but a bit crowded.  I would recommend asking to go to the back room with booths"}
{"text":"I checked out Masa Sushi on a Saturday night. It looked like a pretty small and basic joint from the outside so I was a bit impressed when I walked in since I did not expect a quite large and nice place. The restaurant was about half full initially.  My friend and I decided to go with the $17.99 AYCE dinner.

Once we ordered, our sushi  arrived almost instantly (it could not have been more than 5 minutes). The sushi was pretty decent (I've definitely had better though) and the sushi rolls had a bit too much rice than I'm used to. Nonetheless, decent food. We had also ordered other items (shrimp tempura, general chicken, etc) which was taking quite some time to come out. We asked the waitress about it and it seemed someone in the kitchen didn't realize our order. Once we re-ordered, again the food came out pretty instantly. Again, decent food. Nothing was AMAZING. The shrimp tempura was a bit too oily and I really do not recommend the shrimp roll.

Service was great. Our waitress was friendly and always seemed to fill up our waters at the right times which I appreciated. 

I may go back for the teppanyaki, however I would not do the AYCE sushi again unless I happen to be in the area and was really in the sushi mood. I feel there's better sushi joints out there. *shrug*"}
{"text":"I'm updating my review because I just had an AMAZING experience there.  I left a star out because one review won't change what has happened but i will def be going back. 

I had their teppanyaki and btw they have just introduced AYCE teppanyaki.  I had Sam as my chef and he is amazing, he use to work there a long time ago and they brought him back.  I think the guy that has been there for last few months is a good cook but he doesn't have the flare to be a teppanyaki chef.  You cant just cook in front of people and expect them to enjoy themselves, you have to put on a show...which Samuel did.  

The food was amazing, theres two different options a $20 teppanyaki or a $24.  We had the $24 and there was this scallion and roasted garlic sirloin roll which was the best thing ive had in a long time.  

The waitress i had with blonde hair was GREAT i never had to ask for anything she wasn't hovering over me every second but knew exactly when I needed tea or water etc.   GREAT waitress.  Great chef....100% i'll be going back.  Oh btw the AYCE teppanyaki also has AYCE sushi (so both are $20 or $24) its essentially an additional $2 different from AYCE sushi alone, so TRY IT! 

They just started this last week and its great... the flounder was awesome, the salmon was great, i wasn't a fan of the chicken but I'm VERY picky with my chicken...everything else was PERFECT!"}
{"text":"Sushi has way too much rice around it. Service is slow and not at all attentive. 
I've had better sushi in many other places around the area. Wouldn't go here unless as a last resort."}
{"text":"DO NOT GO HERE!

I went during lunch today as I have never been. The AYCE menu is very limited. No sashimi. The service was really bad. They took forever to take my order and bring it to me. I only orderd 3 things and they screwed up my order!! The tempura was very greasy and I don't feel so good. I love fried food but when it is too greasy it doesn't agree with me.

I saw tables get very upset at the time they took to serve everyone. One couple was waiting 30 mins before the server took their order. Another man got up and left after 30 mins as he was getting late to get back to work.

If you go during lunch, expect to wait. 

Also the server had the audacity to tell me that the amount I paid didn't include tip.  I said I know that there was no tip.

I will never go back here. 

The only positive thing was the spicy salmon roll.

There are a ton of other sushi places in the area. Don't get seduced by the AYCE."}
{"text":"Solid 3 star for AYCE lunch buffet - $10.99

The decor in this place really nice - for a cheaply priced restaurant, I was impressed.

They have a few $7.50 lunch options (bento box, rolls) and an all-you-can-eat lunch buffet for $10.99. Menu choices for AYCE were 5-6 types of rolls, 3-4 kinds of tempura, salmon and cuttlefish sashimi, terriyaki chicken and beef, gyoza, miso soup, salad and a few others.

Service was OK - lots of staff on hand, some could not speak any English but they were quick enough to call over someone who could answer our questions.

Food was all adequate and it was served up quickly."}
{"text":"Very delicious food for a great price."}
{"text":"We came downtown for my niece's wedding reception. Such a bummer it was pouring rain and couldn't drive down (from Richmond Hill) because streets were blocked for Pride.  Ok... other reviewers are sooo right about too much rice! Since it was the AYCE, I picked off the fish on top and it was paper thin, and not fresh tasting. We were in a private room of about 50 people and service sucked.  One person doing the room and a back up second you would see sometimes. How ridiculous, it took almost half hour for my boyfriend to get a beer, then she forgot my Perrier, came 10 minutes later.  None of the food was hot, which is especially horrible for tempura. The squid balls (which I hadn't had before) were ok, browned on the outside, but gross mush inside with non existent squid.  I would never return here again.  The food was truly barely edible. Yuk! One more thing, my niece and new hubby were never served first! What a joke, terrible service"}
{"text":"Went here for the $17.99 dinner AYCE and was NOT impressed.  The menu is small and doesn't even have edamame on it.  No drinks included or ice cream.  They do have tapenyaki included which is great, but the chicken, salmon and veggies were all very medicore.

The sushi was decent but they over do it with the rice!!  Little filling and huge amounts of rice, probably to get you full quicker!

The biggest turn off about this place was that we poured out the soya sauce only to find about 2 or 3 small dead flies in it.  We told our server and she was just like \"Oh, do you want a new one?\".  Disgusting.

Will never go back here."}
{"text":"This is your typical cheap food, all you can eat place... quality was lacking in the sushi by all means. I guess if you are really hungry and want to eat a lot as opposed to quality, this would be the place for you. We only wandered in here on a Holiday Monday as Tokyo Kitchen across the street was closed which is HIGHLY Recommended. 

Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I went to Masa for the teppanyaki dinner and show. We were promptly seated in the teppanyaki area. The teppenyaki area was empty, but the rest of the restaurant was pretty busy, so I assume most people come for the sushi.  We were seated right next to the kitchen door, so we asked if we could switch. The waitress obliged, and we were moved  to a more secluded area. 

Service was great. We got our salad, soup and drinks right away. The teppanyaki show started as soon as we finished our appetizer. The chef put on a great show for us. He even repeated some parts of the show (the fire and egg trick) so we could take pictures. The food was delicious! We had the teriyaki steak and chicken combo. The meat was juicy and tender. The vegetables were to die for! Everything for around $40.00, give or take. 

The only negative thing I can say about Masa is that the chairs in the teppanyaki area are not comfortable. So if you suffer from back problems, you might want to avoid the teppanyaki area, and ask for a booth.

Either way, Masa is a great value. Great service, delicious food, affordable prices. Plus, it's got the best teppanyaki in town!"}
{"text":"For a 2 star rating, I did frequent this place quite a bit as the Lunch Buffet wasn't terrible.  The Japanese fried rice and gyozas were quite tasty but the rolls are almost sarcastically large with too much rice (not really surprising for an all you can eat Sushi joint).  

The lunch specials though are quite cheap and I vaguely remember a discount if you did take out and the portions were really generous.  So for $7, I guess you really can't go wrong with one of their daily lunches.  But only eat here if you are restricted to a set budget for lunch."}
{"text":"A little cheaper than other AYCE places.  Sushi is not too great, lots of rice.  Food items took a little long to come out.  

Servers are very nice, the decor is classy and comfortable.  Seems like it would be a great place for groups or business outings.  

I would be wary of coming here again thought, because they just failed a health inspection recently..."}
{"text":"Came here last week with my whole lab for our annual dinner, and had a pretty entertaining experience.  Foodwise, everything was pretty decent..portions were reasonable, taste was alright, nothing particularly striking but relatively okay in quality.  We opted for the teppanyaki dinner, and were able to choose three meat items each.  I got the beef, oysters and shrimp.  I managed to snag some of my friend's chicken as well, and everything was relatively tasty.  Service was pretty decent, and our water was filled on a semi regular basis.  Pretty sure the owners are Chinese, since all the staff seemed to be, which made meant that most of the Chinese-speaking members of my lab got to order their food in Mandarin, which was nice.    
Anyway, many of you may be wondering, why Jon L, if the food was only rather mediocre, what made the experience entertaining?  Well, I'm sure most of you were not actually wondering that, but if you were, I will tell you now.  The experience was made memorable by most probably the worst teppanyaki chef I have ever seen!  He kept trying to do tricks and all of them kept failing!  But what was most hilarious was that he didn't seem to notice or even care.  He just kept on going..it was great!  His pure audacity was the most entertaining thing I have seen in a while and I don't think I've laughed that hard in a really long time.  The best moment was when he start frying some scrambled eggs and told some of my labmates to line up their bowls.  Silly us, we thought that his plan was to eventually get the egg from the grill into those bowls.  In actuality, what his plan was, was to start madly chopping at the egg and spray it all over around a 5 ft radius of where the bowls were..egg on the table, in the crack between the grill and the table and in the water glasses.  And he didn't say anything afterwards, no apology or anything like that.  Just pretended like that was his original plan.  It was great!  
So, would I come here again?  Probably not, but I will always have fond memories of this place."}
