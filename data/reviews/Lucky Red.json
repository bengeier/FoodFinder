{"text":"Very attentive, lovely service and cool atmosphere.   I had the fried chicken bao which had great texture and presentation but was a little bit bland.  I doused it in hot sauce to compensate.   Also. Points off for blaring rap music with really vulgar lyrics.  I don't mind music like that-- but not during dinner at 6pm.  That reeks of trying too hard. (And is a bit of an appetite suppressant)"}
{"text":"Food is really good here. Came here on a Friday, so limited seating, and sluggish service. We go fried chicken (order as soon as you sit down, it's 20 mins wait), papaya salad (yum!), Pork Belly Bao (juicy, saucy, with great pickled onions), and tried a bite of KPC (Kongpao chicken done with Korean gochujang). Again, the food is good here, definitely recommend, maybe on a less busy night."}
{"text":"Come here for reasonably priced asian tapas comfort food. We were here around 8:30 pm on a weekday and it wasn't very busy. The place it brightly lit and very casual.  Our favourite was the Ham Bao Ger which was basically a big mac in a bao bun. We had the fried chicken bao which was OK. We liked the Korean nachos. The beef tartare was good but I didn't think it went well with the shrimp crackers. Also had the five spice bourbon sour which was tasty and well-made.   The dishes came out really quick and service was friendly. We'll definitely be back here again to try a few more plates."}
{"text":"I liked it. Some prefer Banh Mi Boys. I kinds like this place better. Not super cheap but it's OK for a quick bite. Tasty enough for what you pay and there is a decent amount of seating."}
{"text":"First time visitor after friends had very positive comments.  Food, in brief, is interesting and good. Tried the pork belly bao and the KPC (crispy chicken). Bao is thumbs up. KPC is very flavorful but needs an offset like rice or other. The biggest disappointment is the poor and slow service. Waited about an hour for my dishes to arrive.  My wait was more than 3x that of for the fried chicken (noted as 18 minutes on the menu). This is completely unacceptable!  The place has forgetful wait staff who do not write down your order and then completely forget it!  Had to go over to utensils table to get more forks and napkins myself, not offered water/had to ask for more, dishes not cleared by staff in a timely manner. More staff need to be hired! While food is interesting, I definately won't come back."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of BMB. Awesome to see their expansion. The space is bigger and best if you want to avoid the traffic at the queen west location"}
{"text":"Decent place in the heart of Chinatown. New, clean, staff fluent in multiple languages including English. The menu is small which I like. They know what they are good at and they stick to it. You can sample essentially the whole menu with a group of four. The bao's clearly being the flag ship. The Big Mac inspired bao is quite creative. Not in competition with Banh Mi Boys yet but it has long shot potential."}
{"text":"Come here for the vibe and unique dishes. The price is on the high end and the portions won't fill you up if you're not on a diet.   The waitress are extremely attentive!"}
{"text":"This place is beautiful.  It was dim, yet well lit. All the dishes there was fairly priced and tasty! My boyfriend and I have been to Lucky Red a few times already, but this time it was different- they modified their menu.   This time we got:  - Salmon Poke ($13) This was probably my favourite dish of the night. Unfortunately I got too excited and forgot to take  photo of it. However, it was huge- one bowl may be too big for just one person. There was rice with avocados, edamame beans, seaweed and salmon on top.   - Thai Sausage Boa ($8 for 2) - Ham Bao Ger ($8 for 2)  The boas were good (the Ham Bao Ger tastes just like a Big Mac).   - Clams and Sausage ($14) The clams and sausage was decent. The portion was pretty big though.  - Fried Chicken ($6 for 2) This is one of my favourite dishes. Its well seasoned and the pieces are huge. Its also very juicy unlike many deep fried chicken   - Beef Tartare ($8) I can't comment on this because I didn't eat any (I don't enjoy raw beef)   Yes, we ordered a lot for two people, and we were extremely full. 3/4 of those dishes would have been enough but we got too excited and over ordered.   I would definitely recommend if you are in the area"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, love the big \"lucky\" sign on the inside. The food was great, especially the steak tartare. Also try the hambaoger it's like a Big Mac but way better. Will definitely go back!!"}
{"text":"So disappointed.  Have visited this place before, and wanted to take an out-of-town friend here for a quick bite.  I even checked their website for their hours and there's no indication of any closure.  We went on Aug 4, and there's a note on the window that says \"closed for renovations\".  What a total drag.  Luckily, Bahn Mi Boys is within walking distance which is where we ended up for dinner.  Anyway, curiosity got the best of me, as I had talked up this place, and I looked into this further, since they only just renovated last year.  Their twitter feed, which had been inactive since the spring, now says (Aug 3, 2016):    \"Time's up for this location.  See you all again soon. This is not goodbye...let's see where we end up, maybe in your neighbourhood.  It's time to split from this location.  Thanks to all our friends and awesome patrons for the support.  See you later.\"  Oh man, I really liked their baos, fried chicken and ram'n cheese.  Sigh..."}
{"text":"I like the look of this place. It's very clean, cool bar tables and chairs. The tvs avertising the menu catches your attention right away. I ordered the fried fish in a bao, I liked the bao it was very soft but the fried fish was ok, nothing special. I did like the sauce that was drizzled in it, it added a nice touch. However I found the food average and very tiny. Nothing to rave about. Expensive, tiny and leaves you wanting more and still hungry. Not sure I'll be back anytime but was a nice try. As an appetizer it's ok but as a meal definitely not filling. I think It's a cute little place and if I'm ever in Chinatown and walking by I wouldnt rush to come back ."}
{"text":"food and drinks are under $10... You would never be able to tell because the quality is 100%   I had the pork belly and fried chicken.  Both delicious the chicken was like no other I've had. Chinese five spice rub!! How unusual.... Right! So tasty!   It doesn't hurt that they have my favourite beer for $6 (blanche de chambly)"}
{"text":"First off I think the decor is beautiful and it is much more spacious than the Banh Mi Boys Queen St location. Luckily when I went there it wasn't busy so I ordered right away without having to wait in long line ups. The menu seems quite similar to the BMB menu with some differences. The wait times was typical of how long you have to wait at BMB. I got the bulgogi cheese steak bao and rice balls while my husband got the fried oyster bao and pork belly lo mein. You get to choose how hot you want your bao which is medium-shiracha, hot-jalape√±o and very hot- habanero peppers. I got the very hot and well it was not even medium hot so I had to add more shiracha. The bulgogi cheese steak didn't have much cheese in it but a good ratio of meat to bao. The flavour of the beef was your typical bulgogi flavour and it was very tender. The rice balls was a little disappointing because there were barely any sausage pieces in it. The only thing that saved it was the mayo and bonito flakes. I had to drench the rice balls with shiracha for a kick of flavour. My husbands fried oyster bao was way better, very crispy and flavourful. I would probably get the oyster bao myself next time. The lo mein was basically ramen noodles with 2 slices of pork belly. Holly, the pork was too salty and the noodles were  lacking flavour. Out of everything I tried I thought the baos were the best. I will definitely come back but hopefully the second time around they will bump up the spice and quality of their food. Hopefully they will bring something new to the menu that isn't reminiscent of the BMB menu."}
{"text":"Food: Pork Belly Bao: always our favourite. Pretty fatty but tasty enough to have me forget abt the unhealthiness  Panko Tofu Bao: nothing special. I didnt like how they pair up the tofu with pickles  Beef Tartare: over seasoned and too sour.  Fried Chicken: (I had the fried chicken here almost a year ago, and I didnt know if they had changed their recipe or not.) The chicken was juicy and crispy, but they had sugars on the salty chicken. I was personally fine with that but my friend did not like the sweetness.   Service was alright.  If i would come back again, I would probably only get the pork belly bao."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Banhmi Boys so I've been wanting to try this new addition in Chinatown. It is more spacious, more seating compared to the other location and not as packed. The menu looks similar to the other place. I tried something different this time - Panko crusted tofu bao and S'mores bao. Panko tofu bao - fried panko tofu with pickled cucumber.  The soft bao really makes the difference, very soft and the tofu is freshly fried. Nice veggie bao even for a person who is a meat lover.  I didn't try the dessert S'mores bao at CNE so I wanted to try it. It is a fried bao with Nutella, bruleed marshmallow and crushed graham crackers. It was good to try, I like it better than the real S'more but they should put more of the graham crackers in the middle."}
{"text":"4 stars for the baos! They are delicious, creative, and fun to eat. I've been here multiple times and have always enjoyed them. I've yet to find a bad bao here, and I've had the Thai sausage, the fried chicken, the tofu, the ham-bao-ger, and so on. An inspired take on the classic BBQ pork bao.   In my opinion, the cocktails and other dishes don't stand out - the cocktails are perfectly nice, but not as great as what you might find at, say, Cocktail Bar, and the eggplant and fried chicken didn't blow me away. Those baos though!   Another nice thing about this place is the atmosphere - if you're looking for a genuinely stylish, dimly-lit spot to meet a friend for a drink, Lucky Red fits the bill. I love the textured wall, the use of red, and the huge \"Lucky\" in cursive on the wall."}
{"text":"I am going to update my last review for Lucky Red and bump it up to 5 stars.  We are regulars here now. The food in relation to the price of our meals is phenomenal!  It is so easy to come back every week or every second week.  We've had almost every item on the menu, but the bao burger and the BBQ pork bao standout to me and are crave-worthy. I would also like to give a shout-out to their fried chicken where a hint of sugar and perhaps some cinnamon(?) is incorporated - it's great. The Nacho Koreano dish is unique and tasty as well.    They have a unique beer where the bottle is shaped like a Buddha... and my partner orders it ALL the time, so I'm assuming that it would be a great brew to try for those who love trying different beers.  Apart from the food, the servers & manager are incredibly friendly and the location (on Spadina, in Chinatown) is convenient. We bring our friends all of the time and we once occupied the entire backend of the restaurant and had about 20 friends join us for a birthday.  They were so easy-going and accommodating. Everyone loved the food.  Well, I can't get over how inexpensive it is to eat a good meal at Lucky Red. Look forward to paying about $35 for 2 people. Amazing.   I recommend!"}
{"text":"Like it's cousin Banh Mi Boys, there's great food at a totally reasonable price here. So far I've had the fried chicken with spinach and fries on the side which was incredible and the burger, which tastes like a Big Mac only a hundred times better. My only complaint was that they don't serve the noodle bowls after 5. Other than that, definitely going back for more!"}
{"text":"Lucky Red is a spinoff of BMB restaurant but nonetheless does not detract in any way from its predecessor in terms of quality and novel tasting fare. Lucky Red picks up where Banh Mi Boys left off by offering food enthusiasts a unique Asian-fusion dining experience. A notable difference Lucky Red has over BMB is that it has more of a bar and restaurant vibe to it whereas BMB is more of a fast food lunch place.   The food items that stood out for me would be the Ham Bao Ger, Lucky Red Fried Chicken, and Nacho Koreano.   The Ham Bao Ger is what you would expect from what the name would imply, the Asian-fusion version of the classic hamburger. To be more exact, Lucky Red's version of McDonald's Big Mac sandwich. The Ham Bao Ger taste strikingly similar to the Big Mac but without all the added calories.   Lucky Red's Fried Chicken Wings were delicious to say the least. The fried chicken has a familiar but unique taste to it as it has a salty but sweet seasoning unlike any fried chicken I've ever tasted before.   My favourite dish would have to be the Nacho Koreano as it takes Asian-fusion cuisine to another level. I would describe the Nacho Koreano as being a cross between a fried pork dumpling and a nacho platter that you would commonly find at any bar. What stood out about the Nacho Koreano is that Lucky Red blends the comforting familiarity of bar nachos with the novel taste of fried dumplings to create a delectable new dish."}
{"text":"I went here on a Tuesday night after work around 8pm and I had a great time. The service was prompt (always water on the table) and the food was delicious. Keep in mind that the food comes out one at a time in random order. We ordered the beef tartare (a bit heavy on the fish sauce but delicious), pork belly bao (pork was perfectly rendered, could use a bit more veggies in the bao), fried chicken (pretty good, but I've had better, comes with a spicy house sauce that was good), eggplant (my favourite dish, still dreaming about it, so good), duck poutine (not my favourite, but my husband liked it the best), and lastly the green tea panna cotta (excellent!). The prices were appropriate and the atmosphere was chill. I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"I had the fried chicken on a baked bao and it was pretty good. As other reviewers have noted, it's a bit on the sweet side. The chicken was fresh and hot, but a little bland. Overall, it was a bit tasteless. My friend had the fried fish on a steamed bao and it was much better.  Lucky Red is good, but not as good as it should be. Given that the owners are the same as Banh Mi Boys, I expected more."}
{"text":"This place was really hyped up when it first opened, known for its modern asian fusion. I didn't get the chance to stop by until this reading week. We came in for dinner on a weekday, and it was completely empty. The restaurant was dimly lit, red and black with Asian-inspired details. They had booths, but we sat at a higher bar-like table. The chairs didn't have backs so it wasn't super comfortable. We were able to talk for a long time there.  We had a jug of water, and of course the service was spectacular since we were the only ones there. We ordered the pork belly baos. They each came with two thick pieces of meat, and were very delicious. We also ordered the Kimchi fries, which were averagely good as well. The fried chicken on the other hand was not my favourite. The pieces were gigantic and well worth the money. However, they were not seasoned well and they only had lime and a super spicy sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Had the pork belly bao sandwich here. Not exactly filling but the taste was great and the service was friendly. Its a nice place to check out if your in the area. Took a star off as the prices are not comparable to the other goodies in the area. I mean Kensington market is just around the corner. I'd stop in again to try out a few of their other sandwiches. I do prefer their Bahn Mi Boys shop better in terms of value."}
{"text":"Came to this place during their Lucky Hour. Had some great food and drink specials  which my friends and I definitely took advantage of. Food was also great. Since they were on special and we were sharing between friends we pretty much ordered everything that was on the special menu. Items we tried were:  Hambaoger- It is as good as it sounds Soi Mung Rice balls- imagine takoyaki. but rice ball nacho koreano- super goood but wish it came in a larger size. Would even pay a few dollars more for the size increase. It was legit 6 nachos when we ordered. chicken wings- pretty standard pork belly bao- again pretty standard  I took a quick look at their website and it seems there is more to their menu now. Since I visited when they first revamped the place (when they only offered dinner service) things may be different now. Will revisit to confirm."}
{"text":"There's potential.    After reading the not-so-great reviews, I just had to see for myself.  I ordered the fried oyster bao.  The bao was steamed so pretty straightforward (I will try the baked next time).  The fried oyster had good crunch but it was really greasy.  They didn't even try to absorb the oil after frying.  Also, I asked for spicy and there was no kick to it at all.  This seems to be a reoccurring issue.  Overall, it was okay.  I would definitely give them another chance because the oyster was very tasty."}
{"text":"Love the idea of a gourmet pork bun or \"bao\" place. Very casual atmosphere and standard pork bun price. Nowhere can beat china town pricing anyway or how. Interesting decor of the Chinese calendar zodiac signs as a mural on wall which is a great touch. Food is made fresh and has an amazing aroma. Everyone who works here is quite good looking. Very conveniently located by ttc."}
{"text":"When I first heard about Lucky Red, I was tickled pink.   After my original \"tickled pinkness\" faded to a far more subtle \"tingling salmon\" I hoped on Yelp! to see what everyone thought because my preferences are guided solely on the kindness of strangers.  Well, the sentiments of the crowd seemed to have been spot on with Lucky Red. Everything that was so amazing, new and innovative about Banh Mi Boys when it first opened is now a lesser knock off at Lucky Red. What makes this so astounding to me is that everything at Lucky Red could have been accomplished simply by having a new menu at BMB.  As with BMB the staple at Lucky Red is bao with lo mein replacing the tacos and banh  but it seems like they have tried to go further off the map with their menu at Lucky Red. This does not make for bad food, as both my Fried Oyster and Cheesesteak Bao were rich and flavourful. However, it does inch the closer and closer to what I call \"stupid food\". I understand the need to innovate but at what point did we forget that Bao is supposed to be a cheap street food and not a small palm sized sandy that costs 6 bucks.  My only other issue was with the \"Baked Bao\" which, lets cut the marketing mumbo jumbo, is a goddamn sesame seed bun and we all know it!  All in all the food wasn't bad at Lucky Red, it just wasn't overly memorable. Also, where'd the jalapenos go? You know I like MUY PICANTE!!!!"}
{"text":"Good off kilter spot I'm Chinatown. Came here for a quick drink on Wednesday. Also had some Falafel Bao (only in Toronto) and some Tacos. All the food and the ambiance were quite nice. 4$ Jameson as well. Not super rarified but a perfectly passable place to have a drink and a snack."}
{"text":"Being a big fan of Banh Mi Boys, I was excited to eat more of my favorite item - steamed bao - at Lucky Red. All of the baos available at BMB is also available at Lucky Red. I opted for one of the new baos on the menu - crispy fish. Apparently it is one of their more popular items. There was also oysters and cheesesteak and spam which was bao of the month.  To keep things short - crispy fish is a fish taco in a bao. I liked it. I also tried the s'more bao. It was pretty tasty but I was surprised that the fried bao it comes on was not hot and freshly fried."}
{"text":"The star rating is based solely on food. The service was alright, a bit slow. Food was AH-mazing. Best Asian fusion restaurant out there. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Food is still as good as the other restaurants however service here is 'meh'.  I'm not expecting much but I got a weird experience where they had difficulty answering my question of, \"How is the fried oyster bao?\"  When asking this question, I specified I wanted to know how it tastes like but all I got was, \"It tastes like fried oyster\"  I guess I expected a little too much.  They also rushed me to the counter knowing I was on my way (literally walking towards them), they STILL yelled out my name again (a little pushy?).  Regardless, food is tasty but I wouldn't come all the way to China Town for Banh Mi Boys.  Their other 2 restaurants offer better service and the staff are more informative."}
{"text":"I was all amped up for Lucky Red, as a longtime fan of Banh Mi Boys. It's a little pricier and a little less impressive. It was considerably empty just before lunch hour, and has way more seating. The mural includes a rat riding a pig - there's a joke in there somewhere, but it's so goddamn humid out and I'm in no mood to find it. Also, there's self-serve sriracha, and I'm a fan.   I ordered a crispy fish steamed bao and a BBQ pork baked bao. Toppings were good but slightly overwhelming (just a proportion thing, I think), and it seemed like the steamed bao wasn't as moist and squishy as at BMB locations. Everything was fine, but there's definitely room for improvement.   Very tempted to try a dessert bao, and I don't live too far away, so I guess I'll go back."}
{"text":"3.5  So I thought this place was very similar to Banh Mi Boys with the steamed buns and Kim chi fries. Turns out apparently the son of Banh Mi Boys owner opened this place.  Service was good, very nice employees. Food came at a decent speed. Ordered the pork belly steamed bun, BBQ chicken also steamed bun and Kim chi fries. All the flavours were good and I enjoyed the food but it wasn't like a punch of flavour. It was also unfortunate that the pork belly finished sooner than the fried chicken so the pork belly bum wasn't as hot. Didn't even feel like it was fresh out of the steamer.  All in all a good experience. Will come back to try other stuff like the oysters."}
{"text":"My super tasty Lucky Hour (5-7 PM) treats were enjoyed not on a planned visit, but as a spontaneous stop in between other weekend plans. I think that this contributed to my great experience!   The Yelp community seems a bit tough on this brand; perhaps Banh Mi Boys was a bit overhyped back in the day, and then the first version of Lucky Red didn't meet expectations. I cannot comment on the original Lucky Red, but 2.0 is fine by me. I designate myself as a fan at this point because the service was stellar and I truly enjoyed the bites -- good drinking food!   A Lucky Buddha beer and Nacho Koreano came to $11. Pretty well-priced and those nachos are not only creative, but DAMN GOOD. They are satisfying bites of crispy wontons with pork and topped with kimchi, scallions, gochujang sour cream and a sprinkle of cheese.  I want to try the 11-Spice Chicken during another lucky hour (how does it compare to Bar Fancy's 5-7 pm $2 a piece chicken for example?), as well as the Durian Tart."}
{"text":"I've been here several times since they re-opened and the food has always been incredible.  Luckily for us it's never very busy so we can always find a table.  My friends and I have tried many things on the menus and they're all great, but my personal recommendations are the pork Belly bao and the ham bao ger, which is their take on a Big Mac. I actually don't even really like Big Macs, but that bao is amazing. They also have some really great  deserts including a smores bao that's not to missed."}
{"text":"I really regret paying for the food here. Would give 0.5 stars if I could.  $3.49 - $4.99 is not that expensive for a steamed bao. So I think it says something when I feel like I wouldn't even pay that for the food here.  While we were there, the place smelled like burnt plastic. That did not help with my appetite.  We got the crispy fish bao ($3.99) and fried oyster bao ($4.99). They were nice enough to cut it in half like I requested so we could share. The crispy fish bao was oily and was basically a fish and chip type piece inside the bao. The fried oyster tasted very meh. The steamed baos were good, however. It was really the insides that ruined it.  They also offer banh mis here, which I was surprised to see (it wasn't in the menu pics on Yelp). If they're as good as the ones at Banh Mi Boys, I guess it is safe to get them. But I won't be coming back. Super disappointed with this place!"}
{"text":"The Steamed Pork Belly Bao was absolutely delicious!!  It was what I had expected but in reality, it blew me out of the water even more.  The bao was perfectly steamed so that it was soft and cushy and the flavour of the sauce within the bao was perfect!  I absolutely loved this bao."}
{"text":"Went to visit after work and caught the 5-7 PM special. Ordered a few things on the menu to share. Overall, everything was just okay. It felt like they were going for the fusion but didn't quite hit the right balance. The two things that are worth trying are the  Nachos Koreano and the limade. The menu selection was quite small and a lot of the items were deep fried and quite heavy. Not many lighter options to balance out the heavy items. Wouldn't say it was a bad dining experience but we will probably not be going back. Would rather just stick with Banh Mi Boys."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying Lucky Red immediately after I read about it's grand opening, mainly because I'm a huge fan and supporter of Banh Mi Boys (BMBs), I absolutely love their food (refer to my BMB review). I wanted something new, something exciting. The concept for Lucky Red is almost identical to BMBs, so it seems like they took what was good about BMBs and added a few new items and finishing touches.   This location, being in Chinatown has a bao-centric menu. The distinction that BMBs is about Banh Mi, which are Vietnamese, and Lucky Red is about Baos, which are Chinese, was surely made by the two locations.  One thing I did really like was that they introduced the option of baked baos, in addition to the traditional steamed version. Sorta like Milk Bread burger buns, a bit more bite than the steamed counterpart. The baos I tried were the fried fish and pork belly, on baked baos; as well as grilled chicken and cheesesteak, on steamed baos. I think that certain fillings go well with the baked baos, while others fair better with the steamed bao. The opened options are welcomed in my books.   My favourite was the fried fish bao. The fish tasted authentically Chinese in flavour-it was like they cooked the fish next door in a Chinese restaurant, brought it over and stuffed it in their bao. It was crispy, tender, and the sauce with toppings complemented the mild flavor of the filet. My second favourite was the pork belly on steamed bao, an old favourite of mine from the BMBs menu. But I actually think it's different. The recipe uses a pork belly of a different cut, thick and in chunks instead of slices. They were also topped with green onions, cucumbers, peanuts and not with cilantro or pickled vegetables, like daikon radish and carrots. So the flavour of these baos were definitely more Chinese in flavor than Vietnamese.  My Favorite part of the Lo Mein was the pork belly! Although the Lo Mien, (topped with corn, green onions, and salty/sweet sauce) was filling and tasty, I don't think I would order it again. The bowl was too simple of an idea, I would much rather get the kimchi fries which is more imaginative and creative. Flavour wise, it's just also much more compelling.  For 4 baos, a noodle bowl, and a Vietnamese iced coffee, we paid just shy $30. Lucky Red is priced similarly to BMB. In my opinion, the meal was fairly priced, considering it was not only tasty and filling but also a new taste experience. I have never complained about the prices from BMBs (in fact, I have praised them for it) and likewise here. Maybe the noodle bowl could be a dollar cheaper though because for $6.99, in this area, I can find pretty good alternatives. Last, the iced coffees are filled with too much ice! It's cold, that's for sure but I want more than 6 sips to my drink!  Overall, I see myself coming back for more. With more room, it's very comfortable. The food is tasty, diverse, new, and fairly priced. I can't ask for too much more for a quick bite. If Lucky Red opened before BMBs, I would give it a higher rating. I appreciate the changes, but the new items are my least favorite - baos and fries are still my favorite and definitely the things to get here!"}
{"text":"Lucky Red is a good expansion of BMBs. I recommend the milk tea ice cream item they have got. That's really good. Get that.   In terms of their baos they offer on the main menu, they are satisfying as well but they don't have the same attraction to me as their more special items.   The food is made fresh and tastes it as well. It's definitely a solid place to grab a bite to eat. Other than that and the fantastic look I the restaurant, I can't really find anything else to highlight that would make this place more special."}
{"text":"I loved this place so much that I want to open a franchise back home. The pork belly and fried chicken bao were amazing. The s'mores bao may have been sent from heaven. And the 80's rap music made for an interesting ambiance."}
{"text":"Went here a few days ago, they open pretty late. We were allowed to pick our seats and they use empty liquor bottles as water pitchers, I liked the style and music of this place. We got the koreano nachos and hamboegers. Both of these were yummy, but small. I regret not taking pictures. They also offer a special hot sauce that they bring to the table. The only downside is their menu isn't very helpful, just written on some cardstock with no real description. The server was pleasant and service was decent."}
{"text":"The decor and ambiance brings to mind a quaint bar/lounge from Hong Kong (especially with the added summer humidity from the open door). The pork buns and papaya salad were really good! The pork was nice and tender and the salad was very refreshing. All in all, great place to stop by for some drinks in small groups."}
{"text":"I never usually review a place but was so let down.  If you've ever had an actual bao this place will come no where close to it.  Bao wasn't hot, took really long and at the end the filling was falling out.  Didn't taste good either.  Meat was over salted.  This place needs a few pointers from BMB."}
{"text":"I always get excited when I discover a good Asian fusion restaurant. And Lucky Red is one of my favorite Asian fusion restaurants in downtown.  First off, when we went there, before 6pm on Friday for dinner, they were having taco nights. We got two pulled pork tacos for $2.50/ taco!! Meat was tender and flavorful! We ordered two more after having two because they were so good. We also got their pork belly baos, papaya salad, and spicy fried chicken thingy (forgot the name, sorry :P). Salad was a good choice to balance out heavy dishes.   Overall, good food and good atmosphere. The place is a bit small, so I wouldn't recommend for a big gathering. If you want to try something different in a trendier atmosphere in Chinatown, this is a place. Next time, if I ever go back, I want to try their s'mores bao!"}
{"text":"the bilgogi taco. the bilgogi taco. the bilgogi taco.  damn that was EXCELLENT.  over a few days we got a the pork belly, grilled pork, and grilled chicken banh mi's and honestly - they were pretty good. no pate though and that's just wrong. and sad. we couldn't really differentiate between the grilled pork and chicken but still, they were pretty satisfying as far as sandwiches go.  really? it was all about that bilgogi taco..."}
{"text":"From the fine folks that brought popular hipsterized fusion Vietnamese sandwiches to this fine city, comes, uh, hipsterized Chinese street food I guess, served in a 90s/early 2000s hip-hop music deafly-ghetto-blasting, dimly lit and renovated-to-suit sorta-out-of-place place in the heart of Toronto's Chinatown. Chinatown seems to be a favourite and much fetishized part of town lately amongst the wanna-feel-cultured hipsters and restaurant grinders who love the late night cheap ass hangover cures and the \"authentic\" gritty atmosphere, so already we're hitting a few points on my in-development hipsta scorecard.  I dunno what was up with the first incarnation of Lucky Red, but the second iteration takes much of the successful concepts of Banh Mi Boys and apply it to a new resto concept that involves a) full sit-down service, b) alcohol, and c) variations of the Chinese steamed baos.  Bao is what they do here, and likewise wih the BMB sandwiches, in ideas you don't traditionally think of. It's like there's an idea contest of what we can do with or what else to stuff inside these damned baos. Quite conservatively creative ideas, if you ask me. There's the $8 \"hambaoger,\" which are a pair of fresh sliders with the steamed baos as buns, with simple ingredients and sauces that reproduces the Big Mac taste (it's been more than a decade since I actually ate a Big Mac, yet still know what it taste like oddly enough). Fun to look at, quick to wolf down, certainly would go for more if it didn't kill me first.  There's also the smores bao, that uses Nutella instead of chocolate sauce, graham cracker crumbs and a deep fried bao to sandwich the goodness of a traditional s'more together. It was alright tite, but was kinda weird biting into a crispy bun you don't normally think of as crispy.  Service was great, likely owing to that there were only about five diners in an otherwise hot summer night. However as interesting the food experience is, eating at Lucky Red seems for me something mainly for a one-off novelty factor, of trying such food in a culturally gentrified setting and realizing you just spent all your grocery money, you've gone nearly deaf reminiscing over Missy Elliot tracks, but hey, you got to eat beef tartare with chopsticks.  {TTC: 505 or 510 streetcars to the epicentre of Chinatown}"}
{"text":"Good Asian fusion right in the heart of Chinatown. I came here with a friend on a Tuesday night. We decided to try a few of the following menu items:  - Pork belly steamed bao: Decent pork belly bao. It reminded me of the Banhi boys one, which makes sense as the restaurants share owners.  - Hambaoger: Presented like a hamburger, this is a mini Big Mac only with the buns replaced with fluffy steamed white baos. Personally I thought there was a lot of excess oil was dripping from the burger while I was eating it, but overall it was quite tasty.  - Korean popcorn chicken: A plate of small balls of deep fried chicken, this dish was quite heavy with nothing to balance it out. We regretted not ordering a bowl of steamed rice to balance out all these intense flavours. It felt like having a traditional Chinese dinner without your own bowl of rice!  - Side of eggplant: This was shockingly spicy, which further supported why we needed to a side of rice for balance. - Tuna tostata: Very small tuna tostadas - the tostada was crispy and oily but I liked the tuna on top. For $3, it was not a lot of food, just a very small tapa.   Overall great food and service. If you are looking for more of a \"sit down\" atmosphere compared to Banh Mi Boys, this is the perfect place as Lucky Red is an extension of the Asian fusion trend there."}
{"text":"Walked into this place on a rainy Wednesday night with some friends for a low-key but fun dinner. Got exactly what we wanted with Lucky Red! This recently reopened Asian fusion bao house was welcoming with warm smells that enveloped you upon entry. Personal favourites on the menu were the pork belly bao and hamburger, as well as the Korean nachos!   The only thing that I'd change for my next visit was to make sure there's a good balance between fried and non-fried food items because it felt really heavy after a while. Cocktails were refreshing though! Would definitely recommend for a good time in Chinatown!"}
{"text":"Went here today with my wife as I'm a fan of their other restaurant Banh Mi Boys. The menu is similar, but with some new items exclusive to here.  I tried the fried oyster with steamed bao (bread) and my wife had the bulgogi cheese steak.  Both were delicious, but the spice level was not accurate and needed to be punched up a lot. I got medium and she got extra hot.  Neither were hot at all.  We also tried the rice balls and pork belly lo main. The rice balls were okay, but was missing something. We added some of the bulgogi from the sandwich to them which improved it's flavour. For really good rice balls, I recommend trying the ones from Menu Food Truck. The Lo main actually used fresh ramen noodles instead of the egg noodles traditionally found in lo main.  The noodles were cooked perfectly and were accompanied with some corn, crackling and green onions.  The pork belly was tender and gave the noodles a nice smokey flavour, however it was incredibly salty, even with the noodles.  Overall, it was good and I'd definitely come back again to try some of the other items."}
{"text":"Service: super nice but soooooo slow 2/5 Food: pretty much bahmi boys plus bar foods, was okay 3/5 Place: a good space to chat and also a pokestop 4/5"}
{"text":"On Tuesday together with a friend, I was finally able to try out their much-favored fried chicken together with an order of the Fried Chicken Bao. I'll say that the flavors for the chicken seem to be presents only in the coating while I tasted more of a chicken flavor in the meat, but it still came to our table hot out of the fryer. I definitely liked the chicken bao where the flavors of the fried chicken blended well with the steamed bun. Even my friend mentioned more about the chicken bao :-) However, Lucky Red would still be a good go-to place in the Spadina area if I wanted to get some non-frozen fried chicken for a tv night and I could pair it off with some home-made seasoned rice."}
{"text":"Came back because i was in the mood for banh mi boys but fancier.  I saw that tacos were $2.50, i thought this was a great deal since they are $3.75 at the other store.  When we arrived the place was moderately busy.  The servee told us to sit anywhere but if we wanted to sit at the spacious table for six, we'd have to move.  Since it was a monday night, she doubted it would be a problem.  The menu is not extensive.  I was a bit surprised.  I think this place tries to hype itself more as a bar with tapas than a full restaurant.  We ordered the pork belly bao, ram and cheese and one taco.  When they taco arrived i was flabbergasted.  It was the size of a mini taco.  Like the size of wrapper younget for peking duck,  when i picked it up to eat, it fell apart.  Filling was tender and nice but not worth it.  Not even for $2.50.  How about charge more and offer more?  The ram and cheese, ramen with guyerre cheese was alright.  Small portion doe $8 and not really memorable.    Pork belly bao was good it better be since its the main dish.  For $20, we were still hungry,  went to burger priest to share a burger and i was still hungry.  the decor is nice but the food leaves alot to be desired.  Next time ill just go to banh mi boys instead.  Cheaper and filling."}
{"text":"It's  opening day for Lucky! Tough when the machines are down so cash is all for today.  Busy for a new place. If you are familiar with banh mi boys the space  and many are familiar.  Pork belly, crispy fish, BBQ pork, cheese steak, fried oyster and spam.   All served on a a baked or steamed bao   I've been waiting forever how's 30 minutes so far for a steamed bao fried chicken? Ridiculous.   People that order after me already received their food.   Customer service would go far here but the question is does it matter to them? They have some kinks to work out.l"}
{"text":"Beautiful place. Love the urban yet hipster decor and feel.   The waitress was very nice.  We ordered:  Ham bao ger $8 - comes with 2 pcs. It's been compared to a Big Mac, but I didn't think so, but can see why people think this. The secret sauce is sweet  and savoury, and the pickles add a zing of sour to the flavouring. Bao was super moist. Be careful, it's super hot (in temperature) because its made fresh. (A)  Pork belly bao ($7) - wasn't very memorable. Sorry!   Japanese eggplant ($6) - taste the soya sauce. Liked it. (B)   S'mores bao - deep fried bao with Nutella, graham cracker, and marshmallow. My fave! Sooo good. Everyone should try! (A+)  Fried chicken (4 piece $11) - delicious and huge. The batter had a sweetness to it. Very tender, probably cause its dark meat.  (A+)    Water was always filled. Spent about $45. Was full and we had leftovers. Value is not bad!"}
{"text":"Came here late on a Friday night with some buddies and it was a good choice to unwind. Firstly, excellent service. Second, good food and drinks. Had the panko tofu bao and a sakura (love the street fighter named drinks) Both were well done. Also had some shots. Will be back for more"}
{"text":"This place is also right in the heart of Chinatown, Toronto! I love going to chinatown for the food and also how cheap everything is here.  Lucky red is a modern and cool little place. If you are looking for rustic Chinese food with traditional dishes from mainland China, this is not what you're gonna get there at all. This place has all the new stuff, like... Pork belly, fried chicken baos, funky appetizers, desserts, and also a small bar. I took a picture of the menu so you can take a look for yourself before you go!   The decor is very laid back and modern. They don't open until the afternoon I believe and the lighting is a bit dark inside the restaurant. It's a good place to come on your own, with a friend, or group or friends, with family, or even on a date.  I got the pork belly baos (they come in two) and also two pieces of fried chicken. I wanted to order more but I wouldn't have been able to finish everything cause I wasn't that hungry.   The baos were really good! The steamed bao (the \"bread\") itself was perfect, it had a bit of sweetness to it and was perfectly soft and didn't stick to the roof of your mouth because of how starchy it is. The pork belly was incredible too. The fat was perfectly crispy, the meat was juicy and tender and it just fell apart. They definitely put enough meat in there! There's also a nice contrast of the richness of the pork belly with the pickled radish(?) and cucumber. The pickled veggies add a nice crunchy contrast and cuts through the richness of the pork belly. There's also some kind of homemade barbecue sauce they put in there that was really good as well.  The next thing I got was 2 pieces of fried chicken. They also added some baby pickles and a lime wedge on the side. If you don't like pickles then don't eat it! They also give you this plastic squirt bottle that's filled with this interesting sweet chilli sauce (I hope it's homemade!)... It is meant to go with the fried chicken I believe and it definitely adds a considerable and FAIR amount of sweetness and spiciness to the dish. If you can't handle heat, don't put this sauce on! However, nevertheless, the flavour of the fried chicken, the sauce, the sauce with the fried chicken were all BOMB! The chicken was so fried to order and definitely nothing short of molten hot! The skin was crispy as anything can be, and the meat was extremely tender and juicy. The chicken also has a really nice rub it. JUST TO TELL YOU, it's not a traditional rub. It is a dry rub, but there's a slight sweetness to it that you don't really expect. It's not sweet to the point where it tastes like a sweet dish, but there's just enough to make you know you are tasting something UNIQUE.   The people there are all very kind and the waiting staff are very attentive. The price is a little bit on the higher end, but that's relative to other places you eat in chinatown. But I can assure you, it is definitely worth a trip and it is definitely worth it! I will definitely be coming back a 2nd, 3rd, or maybe even 99th time."}
{"text":"Heard that this place reopened but I wasn't sure why they closed in the first place. Anywhoo, I went ahead and tried this place out anyway.   I thought there would be a line up to get in and it would be busy but nope! There were empty seats everywhere. I liked the decor and ambience of this place...very chill and laid back. We came in during happy hour and they have items from their menu for a cheaper price. We were a party of three and we knew the portion size were small so we ordered a bunch of stuff like: lucky wings, soi mung rice balls, Nacho Koreano, fried chicken, pork belly bao, and the infamous Hambaoger.   The lucky wings were juicy, sweet and sticky. Not crispy though which I was expecting. The soi mung rice balls were like little risotto balls with pork deep fried and topped with a bunch of stuff. Not bad at all, I enjoyed it. The nacho was a great concept! Crispy dumplings toped with spicy mayo and kimchi. I expected this dumpling to be light and crispy but it wasn't light just crispy but very tasty! The five spice fried chicken was my least favorite. I didn't get a Wow factor from this at all. It wasn't the crispy I was hoping for, the flavor was ok and it came in 2 pieces for 6 bucks which was a rip off!! But I must say that the chicken was cooked perfectly just not my cup of tea. Now onto my fave...pork belly bao! The bao was soft! The pork was cooked perfectly and it was very tender and everything just went well together. The Hambaoger was spot on and tasted like a Big Mac but better since their patty is made out of Kalbi beef.  The service was fast and friendly!! This place is great to order lots of food and just share with a bunch of friends."}
{"text":"Lucky Red is the creation from the same owners of Bahn Mi Boys. Being an avid fan of Bahn Mi choice, I had to try Lucky Red out. It was also widely hyped by friends of mine, as to being a unique location with great fusion flavours. Sadly, I was unimpressed.  Lucky reds is situated in the center of China town, oddly standing out as a gastropub alongside traditional Asian restaurants. Once you enter, the design of the place clearly reminds you of Bahn Mi Boy's layout, and gives a trendy feel to the establishment. Service was pleasant and quick, and the waitresses were charming and helpful. But let's talk about the food.  Perhaps it was my misconception that the food will be bold in flavour, or the inevitable high expectations of a fusion typed restaurant, the food simply did not stand out. We ordered a sizeable selection of shareables and starters. These include the thai sausage bao, the pork belly bao, the fried chicken, the Korean fried wonton, and Japanese eggplant. Every dish was unique in it's own, with some twist that breaks it off from traditional flavors. But unfortunately it just did not deliver the depth of flavour I was hoping for. The thai bao sausage was dry, the Japanese eggplant was lacking in flavour, and the fried wontons were not filled completely. The most strange combination was the fried chicken with sugar sprinkled on top. Not sure what they were going for with that. The one saving grace was the pork belly bao, which stuck to Momofuku's traditional flavours, which was quite delicious and fresh.  Throughout the entire meal, it felt like Lucky Red is trying to break the barrier of the traditional flavours, by adding or removing a flavour profile from each of the dishes. While that may be considered \"asian fusion\", the end product was lacking and uninspirational. Take this one with a grain of salt...or sugar..."}
{"text":"Once when I heard that this place was opened by the Vietnamese sandwich store by their kids as well as Bahn Mi boys, definitely had to try this place out.   When I first walked in this place the interior was pretty cool. There is a fusion of traditional and modern design together. It sort of reminded me of a gangster or triad headquarters. With the music popping and just the way it looks, this place is  'gangsta.'   Aside from the interior their food is pretty good as well. They serve up pretty good tasting bao's. I tried the fried chicken bao ( my favorite!) the HAM BAO GER ( which literally looks like a burger) but funny name for the food, the Nacho Koreano, and their signature poutine.   The boa's were probably my most favorite thing to eat there. The fried chicken bao was delicious! Seriously I think anything fried chicken tastes good tho. The chicken was very juicy and crunchy with the bao giving it a softness when you bite into both together. The bao helps soak up the flavor and juices when you eat it together. The ham bao ger is generally a hamburger imo, it tasted good, very similar taste to a Wendy's burger tho.   The nacho koreano were interesting. They were like humongous won tons filled with a bunch of stuff. They were crispy and crunchy! very tasty tho! The poutine, was so interesting. It was very delicious but they made the gravy or sauce from a chinese dish which has that sauce but I don't remember what that dish is! None the less the poutine was great! Overall, everything was very good. I really wish I could come back again to try more of their other kinds of baos. Until next time!"}
{"text":"It's a strange thing to do - open up a designer Bahn Mi shop right next to the original, and most legit, in Toronto.  To be honest they can't compete in price.  And the flavour didn't blow me away like I was hoping.  In the future I'll go next door, get two, and use my left over dollar to grab a few buns later.  The food wasn't terrible - but it wasn't something that put it a cut above."}
{"text":"Was kinda underwhelmed sadly. The food was not as in point as the pics make it look. The ham bao ger was pretty salty. Blog TO referred to it as Big Mac like... This was a lie. The special of tea day was a pulled pork taco. The pickled onions were alright but the pork was not as juicy as it could have been. Lacked a distinct/ good sauce/seasoning that makes a good pulled pork. Wasn't hard hitting enough. The KPC much like the burger was a bit on the salty side. Best this about the place was the atmosphere, though it looks like it's shit down from the outside/ store front... Charming? I would recommend this place just to get a drink."}
{"text":"Banh Mi Boys and Lucky Red shared the same owners, and they are actually the sons of the ladies at Banh Mi Nguyen Huong. . A few months ago Lucky Red revamped their menu and I have to say, I pretty much prefer this over Banh Mi Boys. I felt BMB was overhyped and I couldn't justify paying $10 for a sandwich when their mom's shop sell for $2.75 :( (Yes I remember the exact price :p).   -Hambaogur - $8: Dat pun doe. For $8 the hambaogur came with 2 baos, a pretty decent price with the appropriate portion imo. The hambaogur tasted exactly like a McDonald Big Mac, well, a juicier and better big mac of course. I'm not sure what was the \"secret sauce\" here, but the overall hambaogur was delicious (and you know you are getting FRESH patty ok), I would totally come back just for these.  -Fried chicken steamed bao -$8: God damn this was insanely delicious as well. The bao was soft and pillowy, chicken was not greasy and had a crispy exterior with juicy and tender meat. Don't get me wrong, I love heat but I just felt the bao was a bit too spicy for me, and the fried chicken can be a bit too salty for some people as well.  Be careful of the hot sauce that is provided with the bao though, it's really really spicy and my tongue went numb because of it :(.   -Ice cream bao - $3.5: I was deciding between the ice cream bao and the S'Mores, but decided to go with this as I think I would feel less guilty with the ice cream bao LOL.  My only complain of the ice cream bao is how thick the ice cream layer was. I think it would have been better if there was less ice cream or maybe bigger baos :). The Oreo ice cream was not too sweet with bits of ores, but the highlight is definitely the deep fried baos here. I'm not sure how to describe the taste.... The baos reminded me of the deep fried mantou (white buns), rolled in sugar and served with sweet condense milk. These baos had a crispy crust while remained soft on the inside... It's so good.."}
{"text":"Sublime.  Is this the first 5* I've given? It could well be.  Service - worth 6 stars. Stellar (ha!)  Ambience.  Right on, whether you're a kid, a hipster, or an ancient granny type.  We were totally grooving on the tunes - no easy listening BS here.  The beer - Blanche de Chambly with lemon slice. ...sigh... just the thing for our meal.  The food. Oh god, the food.  We shared an order of fish bao.  Like the best fish and chips , done up as a bao slider.  Delish.  Could have used some kind of slaw but the house hot sauce (POW POW fabulous - Scotch Bonnet and peach/nectarine POW POW POW) took it to an amazing taste place.  Then our duck gravy poutine arrived - not old skool poutine, but kimchi makes for a great poutine experience (plus more hot sauce of course).  and then ... the fried chicken.  ...moment of reverential silence please...  Is it always that amazing? I hope so, cuz we're going back.  Tasty, crunchy, juicy, five spice flavoured yummy.  We would have bought some of the hot sauce.  So good.  Did I mention the brilliant service?  it resulted in two little samples of hot sauce to take home.  So good.   Perfect place for a great snacky meal on a snowy Saturday evening."}
{"text":"Pork Belly Baos, YUMM !!  I really just wanted to write what I wrote but Yelp is detail oriented so I will write some more. Cool place, it's all red and lucky, they were playing Hip Hop music and I was jamming. Had tartar and their fried chicken accompanied with tiny pickles, it was cute. We had water but apparently they have cheap drinks too.   I would recommend this place, and would go back again because, PORK BELLY BAOS."}
{"text":"With the re-opening of Lucky Red, and since I come around pretty frequently,  decided to make a pit stop.  Have they improved from the last time?  Yes.  Is it a place where I would be dying to come back? Not.....really.    Now don't get me wrong, the place is fine.  I see that the layout has changed more into a restaurant and a lot less of what Banh Mi Boys is.  They've focused more on the dining in part which I thought was a nice change.  As for the food, since I was pressed for time, I did take-out and got a Fried Chicken bao.  For 2 for $8 (and maybe it's me, but they're a bit...tiny?), it's a bit pricier than I thought and it seems like these Bao Orders now come in orders of two, as opposed to be able to order 1 of something.  A slight miss there, but I like fried chicken.  The bao is good, goes the Korean route with Kimchi, Scallions and a slight spicy mayo/sauce that's put into a bao with fried chicken and cucumber.  Overall product is good, but it's still oversauced (not as bad as before).  The chicken was fried nicely (not overly salty).  However, I wasn't completely blown away by it.    All in all, it's definitely impoved but I don't know if I'll make a return visit."}
{"text":"Place is lit. The staff is amazing and the service is unreal!  I've been multiple times and have tried most of the menu.  The fried chicken is very tasty! Highly recommended.  I'm a huge fan of the rice cakes, and its vegetarian too!  The baos are all good! The fish bao's batter was very crispy.  This is the best restaurants in China Town, you should go."}
{"text":"Review written for the kid who LOVED this place. We liked it too! Service was great, food was Yums. We ordered fried chicken - highly recommended by server and did not disappoint. Crispy and juicy, nice seasonings. We also ordered pork belly bao, falafel bao and the duck gravy poutine. All delicious. Can't wait to go back on our next trip to Toronto. Of course, I wish all ingredients were sustainably sourced, esp the meats. :)"}
{"text":"More like a 2.5 at this time but I want you to know this is just a reflection of the restaurant right now. Not who it is as a person.  This place hasn't got it together quite yet like it's sister shop, Banh Mi Boys. In a neighbourhood with ethnic culinary lightning-type-shit going on north and south of you, -such as this one, you need to bring your A game.  The menu is expansive but similar to BMB. We were served some cold meat this time around, which the staff apologized profusely about. If something is amiss let the staff know. They will make it right, if you talk to them.  I will definitely be going back in a few months to see how this place develops. Till then I'll be going next door like usual. I think the staff is new and they could use a call up from one of the other shops to look at the workflow. Just gotta give props to Banh Mi Boys staff for consistently being awesome. You set the benchmark high. And a shoutout to Nguyen Huong (the store next door) keep on keepin' it real, that shit is spicy son, I'm out. Peace."}
{"text":"The 5 spice bbq pork Bahn Mi is delightful; the bread was warm, the pork was hot and the pickled veggies were crunchy. The same cannot be said about the cold Vietnamese coffee; it was badly watered down version. It  was so awful I did not finish it. It had none of the chocolate undertones plus it was not done in the tradionsl style slow drip method. Here, they used a fancy coffee machine. So go for the food and NOT for the coffee. Get that next door."}
{"text":"Good eats in a cool joint in Chinatown.   I was a bit disappointed that they eliminated many of the items on this new menu as there were much more sides with vegetarian option on their old menu.   Regardless, everything we order was delicious. Would definitely order the  chips and edamame dip again, it was so different and probably the healthiest item on their menu. All the bao's were yummy but again, I wish there were more vegetables options on their menu."}
{"text":"This place has a really cool vibe. The pork belly baos were delish. However, the fried chicken was amazing. It's super fresh and piping hot, so careful with the first bite. If you like Chinese Five Spice (this apparently has 11), then you will get mouthfuls of it. Also, the duck gravy poutine is amazing. It sounds fatty but is soooooo worth it. The $5 Lucky Buddha beer also adds to the ambience."}
{"text":"3 stars overall. 4 stars for the fish bao as it was very flavourful and the fish was nice and crispy. I tried the chicken bao and it was plain and dull. This place is located in Chinatown and near Spadina and Dundas. Venue is modern and spacious and not as busy as the Ba Mi Boys on Yonge. Come here for a quick bite, nothing fancy."}
{"text":"This was a good little spot to grab a quick bite to eat. We had the tofu bao, tuna tostada and papaya salad. All full of flavour and nice portions at a good price. We'll probably be back!"}
{"text":"Was happy that BMB owners were continuing to grow their operation. And in a bigger location offering more seating - that was a great change from the other two locations.  Food is very much the same as BMB, with the addition of the dessert menu, and a couple of new food items. Otherwise, all the usual BMB favourites are here too.  Unfortunately, as of Sept 2, they've CLOSED their doors until further notice.  Very sad.  Read more about it here from their Twitter post:   https://twitter.com/LuckyRedShop/status/506818310026309632/photo/1"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, a unique ambiance, and friendly service. Lucky Red is one of my favorite Asian fusion and bao restaurant.  From the moment you bite into their tenderlicious and mouthwatering pork steamed bao, you WILL definitely want more. You'll also definitely want to order their fried chicken and kimchi fries on the side. As for drinks, have their signature Lucky Red cocktail. It tastes like a cranberry mojito.   Lucky Red has a unique casual, Asian themed, and even potentially romantic (if at night) ambience. There's even a wall-sized \"Lucky\" neon light fixture that's worth a picture.   If you're looking for a unique, casual dining experience, you may get \"lucky\" at Lucky Red"}
{"text":"Nice decor and set up. Did not really like the tacos but the hambaoger was delicious. Bill comes in a red pocket, that was pretty fun."}
