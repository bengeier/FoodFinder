{"text":"The bar is now called Slice's. Bullit is gone (thank god). Great friendly service, great food and the owner is cute as a button. Justin no longer works there but Kimmy and Brian will treat you right. There mixology is beyond reproach. Great fish fry and even better burgers."}
{"text":"Nice place to go get loaded at night but the owner is a fucking douche bag he was really rude to me"}
{"text":"Yelp, you led me astray for the very first time. Wifequist and I were in urgent need of a bar & grill to watch the Wisconsin v. Oregon NCAA tourney game and turned to the trusty crowdsourced advice from Yelp reviews. A \"friendly local neighborhood bar & grill\"? Sign me up!!  First impression:  \"Where's the bar?\" - Wife \"I think it's this warehouse...\" - Me \"Well, I hope we don't get shanked.\" - Wife  We didn't get shanked, thank goodness, but I'll be blunt -- I had quite possibly the worst meal of my life at this place. Sure, I wanted some fried food, but GOOD fried food. The chicken strips were poured out of a paper bag from the freezer and were essentially large Chicken McNuggets in terms of texture and taste. Culver's makes better cheese curds and chicken strips (not a knock on Culver's). My \"Old Fashioned\" tasted like something I would've mixed in high school.  My wife and I left at halftime with uneasy stomachs (partly because of the surprisingly large bill). Her assessment of the experience sums it up: \"Boy, we should've just gone to McDonald's and saved $30.\""}
{"text":"An amazing lunch find! I tried a basic burger and the bean and ham soup and my partner tried the steak sandwich special of the day- with tater tots. . .  The steak was lean, perfectly cooked, tender and super tasty. The burger (with pepper jack and fried onions) was the best I've had in Madison in forever- including, and sorry Villa and Plaza, every place else. For under $18 a truly wonderful place to snag a great tasting and wonderful lunch. A bit quirky of a place but it only adds to their reputation (ala Toby's fantastic feud- take a lesson Stalzey's on how to make a real Reuben). Service? Excellent Atmosphere? Quirky but it's a hidden bar on the northside of Madison so no complaints. Everyone was nice. Spacious, well-lit.  Visit again? Yep. It's a new go-to spot.  Thoughts during lunch? People really still play gambling video games at noon on a Thursday? Too many signs to read but it keeps you occupied!"}
{"text":"Due to the third annual Schizophrenia hardcore/gabber event, my friend Aaron and I found ourselves on the outskirts of Madison and in need of whiskey.  Luckily the warehouse we were destined for was by Slices' (Slice's/Slices).  Boy, oh boy, factory bars in Wisconsin pour stiff drinks!"}
{"text":"Meh... Doesn't treat non family staff right and it shows in the service when just family is working. Food over priced for the portions you get. Decent fish fry though."}
{"text":"This hidden gem is probably the best dive bar in all of Madison. Interactions between regulars and bartenders make it feel much like a family. The owner is a hell of a great guy. Smile and stick around long enough, someone will buy you a drink (which are more often than not heavy handed).  Not much for entertainment aside from 3 TV's that are always playing the newest and relevant sporting event. But if you're coming to Slice's, you're coming to get down to business, and that business is drinking, and you'll find it is a very comfortable place to do so. Tip your bartender well and they will take care of you.   Seeing as you're drinking, hunger shouldn't be too far behind. This place offers a good burger (order it rare, don't be weird) and deliciously greasy and satisfying Sunday morning-only breakfast.  Don't come to Slice's expecting a jaw-dropping experience. Like I said, if you're stepping through those doors, you're stepping in to drink. That's the goal this place caters to. You're stepping into a tight-knit community where most people know each other. And they're all damn friendly. It is a place where local northsiders congregate for drinks, and it shines at being that beacon for townies.  Very unique place. You shouldn't leave sober or without a new friend."}
{"text":"My friends and I were shooting the shee-ot about what makes a good dive bar, and came up with a list of 30 items.  We decided to go to Slices to check out our choices, and it did not disappoint. Cheap beer, stiff drinks, friendly staff and really good food.  This is when of the best bars in madison that people don't know about, and I'm not sure I want them to come...it may ruin the neighborhood feel.  Slice was a bartender with 'Bullet' many moons ago at the Caribou, and they started this establishment in the shadow of the now shuttered Oscar Mayer plant. They make it look easy by providing awesome burgers and one of the best fish frys plates in Dane County.  Swing by, join the local kickball team, and have a drink.  You will love or hate it."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood bar and grill that has one of the best burgers around. Just great quality and you will not leave hungry. The fish fry is very good, large portions with good large sides! The bacon cheese burger is my favorite, with  lots of bacon, lettuce and tomato!    Go to this bar and grill and you will come back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The people are nice, the booze and food is cheap, and I never run into anyone I know. Yay!!!"}
{"text":"Cozy place with good fried food and super cheap booze.  I expected some attitude from the locals when stopping in here before a party nearby and got none--partly because we were the only folks there but also the bartender was nice as could be.  Perhaps some day I'll go back and point out the inconsistent apostrophe position in their signage and get punched in the face."}
{"text":"A friendly locals' dive bar.  Don't expect much, however, it's a nice enough place if you need to whet your whistle out yonder."}
{"text":"For a little dive bar this place is awesome! I am only upset that I didn't find this place sooner. Great burgers and fried pickles. Strong drinks too. I will be stopping here again."}
{"text":"Slices is an awesome spot to grab a burger and a beer no matter what the day! Fresh burgers, awesome buns, and that old school bar atmosphere. Don't get me wrong it hasn't been updated in decades but the food was delicious and extremely reasonable. I think 3 of us ate burgers, fries, and had drinks for $25! It doesn't look like much from the outside, or from the inside, but it's definitely worth a stop!"}
