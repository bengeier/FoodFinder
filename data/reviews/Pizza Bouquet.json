{"text":"This joint satisfies an important niche that has been severely lacking in Montreal: high-quality take-out pizza. It's evident that these pizzas are made with love. You won't find this place unless you know!!"}
{"text":"This is the new restaurant sharing the space with perfect local dive bar, Notre Dame des Quilles. It is also perfect. We've been here a couple times with groups grabbing beers and it's so nice that folks can choose if they want to grab a slice of of something - pepperoni, or a delicious potato pizza - or get in on a whole pie. Their basic margherita is just right - lovely fresh subtle sauce, excellent buttery light crust, quality cheese, good all around. There are additional options for take out that I've only heard great things about and can't wait to try!!! I have a feeling this will become a weeklyish routine in our house."}
{"text":"I picked up a full pepperoni with pepperoncini and oregano and it was phenomenal. A very cool place well hidden but so so worth. The owners behind the counter making the pizzas were very friendly and cool. I rarely write reviews but felt the need to do so as it was top notch. Awesome. Two thumbs up."}
