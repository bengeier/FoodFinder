{"text":"Our very first experience was sadly, disappointing and I wrote a review reflecting that. But, the very conscientious owner, contacted me wanting to change my view  - and change it she did!! Ethiopian food is my absolute favorite eats. I fell in love with the vegetarian options when I lived in L.A. I used to frequent a place that had an amazing buffet. I was thrilled to learn of an all vegan Ethiopian restaurant right in my neighborhood. I love all the differently spiced lentil dishes that compliment the varied veggies you get in a combo plate. When we didn't get any on our first order, my husband and I were super disappointed and still hungry.
After being contacted by the owner, promising she makes the best lentil dishes in town, we decided to give it another try ( perhaps we'd ordered on a bad day?).
The meal we received lived up to my expectations and more! Sooooo delicious. We were full, and fully satisfied. They've won us over as customers. Thank you Ethiopia Vegan Restaurant. May you stay on the Danforth for a very long time."}
{"text":"Amazing Ethiopian food: it was filling, delicious, satisfying, vegan - yet traditional. The restaurant is run by a kind, hospitable family who made me feel welcome. If you're a meat eater, you won't miss the meat at all."}
{"text":"The food was so tasty, the staff was so friendly, and the food was not expensive. The environment was so welcoming and I will definitely be back. I shared the veg platter for two and it was filling and satisfying."}
{"text":"Great little place between Donlands and Greenwood station! Stopped by here to use a groupon with 2 other friends. 

We enjoyed the veggie platter for 2 with extra Injera to fill ourselves up. I really liked the beets, the yellow potato like paste, and the stir fried veggies. I need to find out the exact names because everything was delicious! 

The service is quite friendly and it is a comfortable environment. Tipped 20% because Im always down to support small restaurants that provide great service and food! 

Id like to try other things in the future, this was probably the first vegan restaurant Ive ever gone to and I was definitely full and completely satisfied by everything. I recommend this place to anyone who would love to experience authentic ethiopian food! And they give extra helpings of injera and sauces/dips for free."}
{"text":"Stumbled into this place while just walking the Danforth. Run by a family who have recently moved to Canada. Very sweet and hospitable people. We were the only ones there so the food was fresh and we were treated to an authentic coffee ceremony.

The vegetable platter was exquisite, did not miss the lack of meat and the injera was perfect and a little darker than I'm used too.

Don't hesitate to give them your business and feedback."}
{"text":"Amazing little Ethiopian restaurant, great food and friendly service! The veggie platter was delicious."}
{"text":"SO good and completely vegan! Both myself and my partner will return as soon as we can, everything was delicious. We had the samosas and the veggie plate for two."}
