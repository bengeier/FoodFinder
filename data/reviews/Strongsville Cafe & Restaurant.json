{"text":"Made a recent trip to this joint after a long absence. Now I remember why.  This place is not good, even for a dumpy little beer joint.  With this location somebody who knew how to run a bar could make a mint.  My buddy came in town and we thought it would be fun to visit our old hangout and grab a beer.  It smells musty, the decor sucks, bathrooms were dirty and the bartender could not be bothered.  Somebody rescue this location."}
{"text":"I've been in this bar a hundred times and the last few times I noticed that the crowd had changed. Last night I saw the owner and found out why. I watched the owner grab almost every female in the bar, repeatedly grab his privates and thrust them at girls walking by. The women he could not  molest he yelled out the things he would do to them as they walked by. He made me so sick I had to leave and will never return as long as this man owns this bar. He took a great local bar and turned it into a trashy hole in the wall that you could not pay me to walk into."}
{"text":"UPDATE YOUR FREAKING HOURS!  I've been to your place twice when you were closed when yelp said you were supposed to be open."}
{"text":"Drop by on a Friday night overall a decent spot. It totally took me a couple of turn around on Pearl street to even spot the place. When I did I saw no business parking for their customers which sucks. The place was kinda pack but not really the bar area was full but it was too easy to order. The menu is very basic but it's good. Anything fried is good!! I order a double shot of crown, Long Island, blue moon, and had the platter of 3 diff fried items. Definitely give 2 thumbs up on the service. The music and environment had a good vibe. I'll definitely have to come by and look around again . I was only there for 45 min or less but overall a good drinking spot and CHEAP..."}
{"text":"My first review was removed by Yelp.  Let me see if this fits their criteria a little better.  We were harrassed by the male owner.  He made us drinks from his own \"special collection of bottles\" and then make REPEATED comments about us taking our cloths off.  Would I go back?  Absolutely not."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Bartender wouldn't let me pay for one drink said I had to do two at a time at $8 minimum. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Best locally owned restaurant in Strongsville! 

The Strongsville Cafe is a hidden gem and easily overlooked. The Cafe is full of character and probably has the cleanest ladies room in Strongsville. 

Not only is the Cafe locally owned but boasts homemade food and daily specials. They will customize anything on the menu to meet your tastes. They have daily specials on food and drinks too. 

Tuesdays are always happening with their karaoke and the locals sure know how to sing! 

Park across the street at the Pomeroy House or around the corner at Goldies Deli."}
{"text":"Under a new owner...again.  However, in this case it's not a bad thing!  

Every time I visit the cafe the staff is very friendly courteous.  No matter how busy it gets I am never waiting more than a couple minutes on drinks.  

The prices are also very reasonable..especially for strongsville.  It's not a fancy bar it's just a classic town gem."}
{"text":"This is the best bar of all the bars. You can wear sweatpants or you can wear high heels--you can be your own Taylor Swift song, and sing it too on karaoke nights. You can trust Brandi to make you an outrageous and delicious drink and you can trust Tom to make the best wings in the history of chickens being eaten by people. If you ever wanted to have a bar that felt like your bar, this is the place for you."}
