{"text":"I've had sushi all over Calgary, and El's fits in a snug catagory between the 'pay-through-the-nose' of Globefish & Towa and the 'fast food' of your mall foodcourt sushi. I say this because inside El's, it's more toward the foodcourt end. The actual sushi though, is top notch.  Some creative rolls here too (ie the Mexican Roll) along with the steadfast traditionals. There are only a few tables, so coming at an off-time would be recommended."}
{"text":"Excellent sushi. Much better than globe fish across the street. They need to do a better job of marketing themselves."}
{"text":"Had take out from there tonight for the first time.  I went because of positive reviews and because it's in the neighborhood. I just finished eating part of and throwing out most of fifty dollars worth of sashimi and rolls. Mushy,smelly, poorly cut, poorly presented fish. What more can I say?.  I just hope no one gets sick."}
{"text":"Having tried both Globefish (sad excuse for a Izakaya) and El's, I'd have to say I doubt I would ever go back to Globefish if I was ever in the area.  It's not that Globefish was bad (it's pretty decent for what they do), it's just that El's is that much better in terms of value and quality.  They are small and I have read reports of bad service but luckily when we went the service was decent.  It's not knock you off your socks service like in NY or Vegas but passable for Calgary.  But if you can look past the service and indulge in all the unique offerings they have there you'll be more than happy.  The only problem, too much choice!  There was stuff that other tables ordered that looked really good but we were so full and happy from what we ordered that it's definitely warrants a second visit to try other menu offerings.  They also do a Omakase which judging from how creative the chefs are, might be very tempting on a special occasion."}
{"text":"This place opened up not too long ago and is SUPER small.  We went on new years eve at around 7, but there weren't any line ups (but I would still make a reservation just in case). They had takoyaki there!  So we gave it a try.  David liked it, I was iffey about it. Some of them were a little cold and then some were really hot, I burnt my tongue cause I didn't think it was going to be hot =[ at first, the sauce tasted like it was oyster sauce The restaurant has at least 30 different rolls!  Some of them were quite unique.  We ordered 4 different rolls cause we were expecting them to be quite small. We were right, when the rolls came, it was really small but the taste was HUGE The rice was held together very good and yet it's not stiff or anything!   If you like avocado, the caterpillar maki is amazing, it's so creamy! Some of the cobra maki is really fishy because it's BBQ salmon AND salmon skin. The spicy sauce wasn't really spicy, i like Sushi Kai's spicy sauce on the spicy tuna more.  El's spicy sauce is more sweet than spicy. We loved the El's special maki, there were a lot of flavour in this roll, highly recommended We were going to try the tempera green tea ice cream, but they don't do that anymore.  They only have green tea ice cream left. The place is really small, so with only one waitress, you would think it's plenty enough, but she's soooo slow with everything.  She doesn't clean the tables off fast enough or refill glasses fast enough SOMETIMES she comes off as a little rude or pushy, but SOMETIMES she's really nice. I would definity go back, highly recommended!!!  price wise(the more $, the more expensive): $$ food quality(1 is the lowest, 5 is the highest): 4 services wise(1 is the lowest, 5 is the highest): 2  EDIT: David and I went shortly after our first visit.  The food there was still amazing, the service there got extremely better (still the same girl).  price wise(the more $, the more expensive): $$ food quality(1 is the lowest, 5 is the highest): 4 services wise(1 is the lowest, 5 is the highest): 4"}
{"text":"I heard about the hype and the reputation El's had for having some of the best sushi, that Calgary has to offer. This is very true. As fast as I could, I gathered up a group of my sushi-goer friends and we venture in to the Marda Loop Area. El's is tiny, no wait it's not tiny, it's microscopic - four tables to be exact. As soon as everyone was seated and beverages were served, we were ready to order. I happen to notice some flakes of what I hope was Lemon in my water. I sure hope it was Lemon.  We went all out ordering 11 different maki's including the Blue and White Dragons, Crispy Maki and the Popcorn Maki. The wait was long, but judging from the size of the order, it was understandable, but still pretty damn long. However, as soon as the food arrived at our table, it was definitely worth the wait. The Popcorn Maki was delicious.  It had the right amount of spice and the right amount of crispiness. Even Poseidon wouldn't be able to resist devouring those little shrimps to satisfy his hunger. After the sushi was finished, we attempted to order the infamous Tempura Green Tea Ice Cream that everyone seems to be talking about. Unfortunately, our order took so long that they closed the kitchen as soon as they were finished. Lame.   At the end of the day, El's is amazing and their sushi is some sort of God-like creation that brings a peaceful zen to all of those who consume it. They even have the courtesy of placing Lemon flakes in your water. I sure hope those were Lemon flakes."}
{"text":"Love this place. Small, so it fills up fast but this place is a gem in Marda Loop. Mom & Pop shop, so yes service is maybe a bit slower if it is busy because there is only one of her. Also things are ACTUALLY made fresh. Tempura shrimp in the dynamite rolls are still warm because they were done seconds before not premade as in some places.   Prices seem high but rolls are HUGE and the owner/server is very helpful and accurate as to what amounts you should order. We spend $20 each for dinner there and are stuffed. Lovely plating as well, not just hunks of fish on a plate thrown in front of you.   I have tried the other sushi places and they're not even close to the quality that El's has. Go here. Now."}
{"text":"A retelling of a lunch arranged by my somewhat Secret Admirer (yes, really!).  He adores me and wanted me to have some personal time with my sister, visiting from Vancouver...so he said, experience my very favourite restaurant, a lunchtime forae into wonderful tastes and aesthetics. Try the Age Dashi and the Blue Dragon Roll and perhaps the Tempura Green Tea Ice Cream. Well, who am I to deny the requests of a secret admirer who is kindly treating us?!!  So to El's we went, a plain, small but comfortable lil spot where I chatted with super-friendly owner Mike who has been a sushi chef for twentysome years. How sweet to name El's for his daughter Elisha. We liked our 50's reminiscent silver tea cups!  The avocado & eel Dragon Roll was because my Secret Admirer shares a love of avocado with me and it was honestly divine, tasty & the dribbled sauces ensured you needed no soy.  El's Maki (shrimp & scallop) was interesting but too thinly sliced and hard to eat. However, the Age Dashi Tofu (a fave of both my sister and I), was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. This is tempura-style tofu in nice, big, generous, beautifully, lightly fried pieces. I kid you not...we were astounded. Even guys, who normally have a hate on for tofu, would like this. In fact, we liked it so much we ordered a second round! No wonder my admirer recommended it!  Finishing off with the Japanese version of Mexican fried ice cream was the Tempura-battered Green Tea Ice Cream. It was so different and fun, though I wished the batter had a sweeter edge to temper the not-so-sweet ice cream. But it's totally worth the experience!  We delighted in our sisterly conversation and our happy mouths & pleased eyes. Mike takes great care in his menu (tons of rolls to choose from!!!) and the quality is exemplified by his love of what he does.  And so my somewhat Secret Admirer delighted in our enjoyment. And maybe someday, I'll get to meet him....and maybe at El's. ;o)"}
{"text":"Loved the beef tataki, tempura, and chicken  karaage.  Its a small place that looks to be family run."}
{"text":"Luckily Globefish across the street was closed because I got to try El's.  Being a bit chilly outside, spicy food and soup was a must. I ordered the spicy agedashi tofu, crispy hot tuna rolls and tempura udon.   The tofu was crispy and they definitely didn't skimp on the spicy sauce (same applies to the tuna rolls). The udon broth was flavoured a bit different than I used to, but I liked it (salty with more of a vegetable base) and the tempura that accompanied the udon was great. You got full sized prawns and veggies, battered and fried to perfection.  Parking is a bit hard (it's right on 33rd Ave so you have to park in residential) and space is a bit limited, but they do offer free wifi  (always a plus!)"}
{"text":"Great spot! Delicious and fresh rolls etc. And they are so nice!  We usually do takeout - it's always so fast."}
{"text":"Great place for sushi in the SW of the city.  El's Japanese Fusion offers some of the best sushi I have ever tasted, having been to sushi-centric places such as SF, LA, Vancouver NY and Japan, I can confidently say that dollar/quality ratio here is among the best.  The presentation is nice and the selection is very impressive.    The down sides are the interior, which is pretty bland and the hours are a bit odd as well.  As noted by vanessa t., service has gotten better, and I can longer count service as a down side of El's.  Great place overall, would recommend over Globefish"}
{"text":"We ordered Hot night Maki and two other Maki rolls along with some Sashimi. The rolls were well made and tasty. However, the portions were really small and the sashimi was not too interesting. Not to mention, everything was extremely over-priced compared to what I'm used to in Vancouver."}
{"text":"The four star rating I saw when I looked this place up allowed me to feel incorrectly reassured that the sushi here  would be at least decent. It was not. There was way to much rice in the rolls and the flavor profiles were as dynamic as the mountains of Saskatchewan. Save your self a bad Sushi experience and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Very skimpy portions. You can hardly taste the ingredients as they are so skimpy. And it's pretty expensive. Ambience is poor. Service mediocre. I gave it a second chance but very disappointing both times."}
{"text":"The husband and I went to El's Japanese Fusion for early dinner last Wednesday, we were the only ones in the restaurant but I account that to the time of day as our sushi did not disappoint. The ingredients were fresh and the rice was flavorful as well. We had the Roll Combo (tempura in sushi is a favorite of mine) and an order of gyoza. Both were very well made, well priced, and met our expectations. It wasn't \"off the wall amazing best sushi I've ever had\" sushi, but the quality of food combined with pleasant decor and friendly service makes this a place I will definitely be returning to. Rather than making your way to the Globefish right across the street, I would encourage anyone to give El's a try instead."}
{"text":"The sever treated us like crap when I told him that my boyfriend and I are interested in doing the all you can eat. He kept asking what we wanted and seemed annoyed when  I had questions on the roll quantity. He gave me a menu and told me to look at it. I finally had enough and told him that I didn't know what he wanted me to do since this is our first time there and we needed the all you can eat process explained to us. He took off and came back with a detailed menu on all you can eat and became nicer to us the whole night.  What I like about this place is that the menu for all you can eat is all the best items they had. Unlike others all you can eat sushi places they serve you small quantities and meager tasting items. At Els Japanese Fusion whatever  you order which ever menu they serve it to you on a full on dish plate with creative accents not a small saucer with one piece of roll. The items are a good size and quantity. I was surprised how large the sashimi slices were.   There items are really good. Its ironic how Globe fish is right across the street. I would go to Els again for sure. Come early because they only have 4 person tables and a sushi bar for seating. This place is not good for bigger groups than 4 because you will not have room to seat."}
{"text":"I had a terrific meal at El's last night.   We shared the assorted tempura - perfectly hot and crispy to the last bite. Then I had the new spicy tuna crunch roll and I'd say it's the spiciest spicy tuna I've ever had! In a good way, I love spicy. There was no need for wasabi ;)   My friend shared her assortment of sashimi on rice (the dish had a tough name to say and remember, sorry, but you'll know it when you see it) - it comes with a bbq-like chili sauce. It was very fresh and tasty and I'm definitely getting that next time! Or one of the rolls with kiwi, they sound pretty cool."}
{"text":"Nice little sushi place in the heart of Marda Loop. If you blink you'll definitely miss this place, but it's easy to find being only two spaces away from Fergus & Bix. Will have to try their special rolls and update my review.   California Roll...3.5 stars. Small but tightly rolled sushi and evenly sliced. It's not spectacular but put together as well as expected (and for the price).  Spicy Tuna Roll...3.5 stars. Small, tightly rolled sushi and evenly sliced. Given the size, there's a nice portion of fresh tuna and a dash of hot sauce to give it a lttle kick.  Tempura Soft Shell Crab...3 stars. Deep-fried panko crusted soft shell crab.  Perfectly fried to a nice golden brown. Unfortunately, when you cut through the middle of the crab there's just too much juice. Some of you may like this but I didn't care for it...I would've preferred the crab to be chopped in quarters (and reconstructed after frying for those of you who care for presentation)."}
{"text":"After reading Yelp reviews on this place, we decided to try it.  It was very good.  Exceptionally fresh sashimi. The Rainbow roll was fantastic wrapped with very fresh salmon, scallop and snapper which is a unique way to prepare it. We will definitely come back.  The downside; not licensed. I love a beer with my sushi."}
{"text":"El's Japanese Fusion is a good choice for very quick and reasonably well prepared sushi.  I liked the food.    Now let me tell you what El's isn't ... a Japanese Fusion resaurant.  Not at all.  It's a sparsely furnished diner that serves pretty good sushi.  You go to El's with your pals on a Saturday  afternoon; or you go because you're hungry and in a rush; or you go because a little  time just opened in your schedule... and hey... you're in the neighborhood.  It's a three-quarter step above what most would call a \"hole in the wall\" ... not the venue for a main event.  As for my usual fare, the edemame was good and the salmon sashimi was good.  I always love it when salmon/avocado or tuna/avocado  is on the menu and I got the latter.  Just fine.    When all was said and done, price seemed a bit on the high side, considering really sort of meagrely decorated  space... but I went for the fish, not the scenery."}
{"text":"Great service, nice people and amazing sushi! Way better than Globefish across the street. Hidden gem"}
{"text":"So - finally checked this place out - each time I've attempted to eat here it's closed. Sashimi - tuna, salmon and toro is just so fresh - delicious. Great quality stuff. Dynamite roll - tasty - not too large, good amount of filling. The tempura was just made for us. Scallop maki was okay, but a bit plain. The tuna and avocado maki roll was delicious - perfect balance of flavours - it barely needed soy sauce. Next time I think I'll try their larger specialty rolls The superstar roll is our new favourite. Generous amount of spicy scallop on the top. We also ordered the deluxe dynamite roll. I didn't really like how the rolls were deep-fried - thought it was a bit heavy. Next time I'll try the house roll and alaska roll. I think the fish is fresher at El's than Towa's. But Towa does an awesome black and white roll and dynamite roll."}
{"text":"Solid everything from El's. Always pleasant service and consistently good sushi. Their spicy tofu is quite nice and spicy also. This place has kept me loyal and kept me from even trying Globefish across the street. Sushi sashimi and rolls all get full marks from me."}
{"text":"Small. Unimpressive in every way except for the food and that's what matters. Loves...   Bad tea cups, boring decor, funny setup, parking okay, pretty girl, excellent food."}
{"text":"Oh El's, how I've missed you!   There are some places in town that you go to - not for the service, not for the ambience, and certainly not for the prices. You go there in spite of everything because the food is consistently SO good. El's is definitely one of those places.   When you've actually made it to El's, get their makis. Makis, makis, makis. It's a little bit on the greasier side, true (mostly fried/tempura-based); but trust me when I say that these makis are filling and absolutely delicious. My favorite is the Unagi Cheese. El's prides itself as a \"fusion\" place, so you'll have a lot of creative items on the menu to choose from. Prepare to be pleasantly surprised.  The best time to go is between noon-5. You'll have to call beforehand, though, to make sure they're open (skip the reservations, it probably won't be kept). I've seated 8-10 people at El's before (so it's not impossible), but it was for lunch, and as you can imagine, we took up half the space. The good thing is since we were the only customers at that time, we didn't have to wait, and we had great service to boot. It's all about the timing, see.  (They also have meal cards! I lost mine, but I imagine I would've had two free meals already had I not lost it.)   There was actually a time when my friends and I would handpick the people that we recommended El's to (we had to show them the place personally, and we fondly referred to it as \"Secret Sushi\"). We did it because we didn't want it to get too well-known or too busy. A little selfish of us, I know. Anyway, I've since brought a Vancouverite foodie, a Japanese national, and a former not-sushi-fan to this place (among others). You'd be happy to know that all of them love the food (and vow to come back).   I should really get commission for every person that I refer to this place. Seriously."}
{"text":"Finally had the chance to come here as I heard so many good things about this place and it didn't disappoint. Probably my favorite sushi place in Calgary. Came here with a group of 4 and instead of going through their big menu, we simply ordered the Love Dish which included 4 Miso Soups, various sashimi, and 6 special rolls ($100) which was enough for us.  We loved everything we ate. Sashimi was soft and not too cold. Loved the scallop sashimi. Sushi had just the right amount of rice and sauce. The rice was prepared well as it was still soft. The sauce that they used on the W-Spicy Roll was flavorful and spicy. The Rock & Roll, which had eel in it, was my favorite out of the 6 rolls; the Crunch Dynamite was my least favorite only because I'm not a fan of warm sushi although it still tasted good. Even the Miso Soup was more flavorful and less salty than other sushi places I've been to.  A bit on the pricier side, but definitely worth it if you're in Calgary. Can't compare the price vs quality to Vancouver though."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews from all these yelpers and general goodwill, I decided to drag my friends down to El's sushi. I was under the impression that it was quality, creative cheap sushi. Well, two out of three descriptors ain't bad.   We walked in, and the bar and the other three tables were full. Luckily we squeezed into a table at the back. We glanced at the menus and seriously freaked out at the prices. It isn't that they are awfully overpriced, but I had come to the conclusion that they were cheap! Not so - El's is firmly in the middle to expensive range of sushi.   My friend got the house rolls and some miso soup, and me and my other friend split the chirashi sushi (sashimi on a bed of rice), the appetizer tempura, and we each ordered rolls and she got miso. I have this issue where I'm always afraid I won't get enough sushi, that I just won't feel full. I definitely have issues pacing myself. Our food came pretty quickly, and everything was amazing and HUGE. Even though El's is fairly pricey, you do get what you pay for. The bill ended up being about $20/per person, plus tax and tip.  Despite our total over-order, we still managed to scarf down a ton of our food. My friend's California rolls were succulent and delicious, the House rolls were huge - at ten pieces they took up the entire plate. Everything was beautifully and excellently presented and I was definitely impressed with the food. We did have to take some with us, and I had a little food baby. I will be back to check out the impressive list of rolls.  Everything was good except for the mediocre service. The server was very friendly, but there was only one of her. She was fairly slow at refilling drinks and bringing out food. Considering there are only five tables, it did get a little frustrating trying to catch her attention."}
{"text":"Great sushi, very fresh.  Family owned. I really enjoyed the torched toro(fatty tuna) sushi and w-spicy roll (tuna, salmon and cucumber roll topped off with their delicious spicy tuna.  I will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"I really REALLY wanted to like you El =(   Food ok... service needs improvement.  1) Service! - poor waiter dude.... he was all alone and was super frantic - y'know you can be frantic on the inside, but if you're dealing with customers and being around customers, you should be cool as a cucumber on the outside! Otherwise, it affects people's dining experience. PLEASE you need to hire at least one more staff!!!!  Long wait for food... but that's cuz (of staff again) but also that all the rolls and sushi you order come out on ONE plate... so basically sushi chef only handles one order at a time and only serves one table at a time. If they served some food to each table then all tables would be eating, instead of only one table and the rest waiting for their order.    2) Food, water, green tea - So... had water first... and it tasted like plastic... ewww... so we ordered green tea - which came at the end of our meal... but yes we gave the waiter some slack b/c he was all alone.... again poor waiter dude! I feel for you.  Started w/ Agedashi tofu, interesting different presentation and it tasted ok. Sushi Rolls were not bad either, we also got the toro sashimi plater - 7 pieces $15. Some thought it was ok... I thought it was not that great - could tell it was frozen... but anyways.  After dinner, 2 of us had stomach aches.... and my stomach is still gurgly....  Overall, I thought it was pricey for the whole experience. I may come back and give them a 2nd chance.  Next time, i would order salmon sashimi (that looked good on another table) and again more rolls!"}
{"text":"I just had lunch today at El's and that made for my fourth visit and I must say that this place moves from strength to strength. It seemed like an odd decision for them to open across the street from the hugely popular Globefish, but wise to the extent that El's can (and does) get spillover business. But it deserves to be a first choice (or at least an equal) in comparison with Globefish. El has a menu comprising a shocking 70 rolls and so far I've only sampled four, and have been coming back to two tried and true: an amazing avocado roll containing, and enrobed with, an ENTIRE avocado, and a \"spicy tataki maki\" with raw tuna inside, seared outside and spicy-sweet sauce all over- so good. But today I finally tried nigiri and fell in love with two gorgeous succulent pieces of unagi- at the best price in town ($2.50 currrently)- and they were not tiny. Rice is perfect too- and what great sunny service. I love this place! But I admit I have to sample more of the menu.  EDITED- I'm revising this place up to 5 stars after a few more visits; in fact El's is becoming an obsession for me as I try more things on the menu and the originality, creativity, quality and value become more apparent. It's leapfrogged past others to become my favourite sushi in Calgary- not bad for a place with a Korean chef! :-)"}
{"text":"Awesome rolls,  we will definitely come again.  I'm not that into rolls,  but the food here is unique and delicious."}
{"text":"Thanks to all the yelpers that have wrote the reviews my finance and I just went. The place is small and we were worried that it was full and we had read about the service but the service ended up the being great the food was great to as well as huge portions looking forward to my next visit"}
