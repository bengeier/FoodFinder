{"text":"It looks tiny from the outside but inside the burgers are big! The lamb burger was perfectly cooked and I had it with chipotle mayo, mustard, lettuce and tomato. The fries are skinny and really good. There are a wide variety of burgers including turkey, Kobe beef, grilled chicken, bison, as well as salmon and tilapia. Not in the mood for a burger? You can get a steak, fish and chips or several types of salad. Sides include fries, sweet potato fries or rings. The only downside was the table next to ours was very noisy and made it difficult to talk but the food more than made up for it. There is an outside patio and it looks like they are expanding."}
{"text":"Their food gets 5 stars but their service made me give it a 4- can be a bit slow. The restaurant music was also a bit loud so it was really hard to converse with friends. 
However, their Portobello mushroom burger and nachos are the bomb ! Really love the extra toppings and dressings that you can add ! Bonus: Thursday late nights are 1/2 off appetizers! Can't remember the times so do double check. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a good burger in downtown Toronto"}
{"text":"Give me cheap beer and copious amounts of panko crusted onion rings, and im yours. And that is a fact, i am a sucker for these burger bars, Ive traversed the city tasting the fruits of the best they have to offer. This place is definitely a contender for best burger bar in the city. The prices are very fair and affordable, considering how hip the decor is (not the mention the very pretty waitresses). The burgers are quite amazing, with an incredible line up of toppings (remember to ask for your bun toasted if you like to overload with toppings, cause the fresh and light bun gets marrauded by the juices). The summer beer pricing is awesome, and its location is so convenient for a hungry Ryerson student to just mow down and relax. Reservations would definately be recomended though, as the first time we got in no problem, we imagined that a friday evening wouldnt be that much worse. Boy were we wrong. 45 minute wait, with the manager to nervous to even come appoligize to the crowd of increasingly frustrated patrons. Didnt get compensated for that foul up, but hey- if you cant beat em', join em. I am a fan"}
{"text":"First and most important: the burgers here are NOT burgers. They are charcoal. There is only one reason to grill burgers to beyond well-done: bad meat. Crunching on carbon doesn't make a good burger.

Service was sufficient but nothing to write home about. Poutine was okay but nothing like Smoke's.

The space itself is awkward: they should have built the bar/counter along the full narrow length of the space. As is, it only seats about four or five people: not a good move in a downtown area with lots of solo business travelers.

Maybe I just don't understand what Canadians refer to as burgers. I'd give the W Burger Bar a miss unless staying at one of the genera-business hotels in the area and just want to get out of the hotel."}
{"text":"Auch wenn in Nordamerika der Burger sehr populär ist, sollte man nicht umbedingt überall Burger essen.


 Eine Sache die mir bei der W Burger Bar sehr gefallen hat: Man hat nicht nur die Auswahl zwischen unterschiedlichen Fleisch (Beef, Bison, Lamb, Chicken, etc), sondern die Beef-Burger sind ebenfalls frei von Hormonen und Antibiotica.


 Zusätzlich kann man sich das Topping für den Burger selbst zusammenstellen um sein geschmackliches Gesamterlebnis zu perfektionieren.


 Um wirklich satt zu werden haben wir uns noch eine Poutine dazubestellt und waren anschliessend vollends glücklich, satt und zufrieden."}
{"text":"My first visit was good, I ordered a lamb burger, and it was tasty.
So I decided to go luxury this time. I ordered a KOBE burger, BUT it was such a turn down!!  The burger alone was $25.28 after tax (including $1 tips since it was takeout). And it tasted just like a normal beef burger!!! (FYI, a normal beef burger is $6.99+tax there)  It's dry, tasteless  and  texture is tough."}
{"text":"Went here for burgers and left liking the poutine. We ordered a couple of burgers and for some reason felt they were a bit on the drier side. I remember our server was really nice though. As mentioned, the poutine was really good, very filling, and for two people an order of poutine + 2 burgers were too much food for one sitting."}
{"text":"Went to w burger yesterday for a friend's birthday. They were very helpful accommodating an always growing table.
One of my friends ordered the steak sandwich and when she got it it was not what she expected (I thought it was amazing but she didn't like it) and the people from w burger exchanged it no questions asked right away. I was impressed to see this.
I ordered a beef burger with some toppings and it was exquisite. One of those times that makes you remember what burgers should be.
I very very much recommend this place for a burger if you are in the area."}
{"text":"I've been to W Burger Bar quite a few times since it's near my work.  Due to the $9 pitchers of Pabst Blue Ribbon it has quickly replaced Pogue Mahones as our place to go for a quick one after work.
 
The beef burgers are pretty good but could use a little more seasoning. I like the fact that you can pick from a large variety of unique toppings like Garlic herb mayo and cilantro yogurt.  As far as gourmet burgers go this place is my favorite (but i haven't tried them all yet).  I didn't really like the turkey burger, only tried it once.  Friends all enjoyed the bison burger just as much as the beef burgers but i haven't tried it myself. 

The staff are really friendly even though they have to put up with a lot of rowdy customers late at night."}
{"text":"This place makes pretty good burgers, and I've tried nearly every one at this point. Tried the kobe burger during their lunch special, and it was really tasty. I order takeout from time to time, and their online ordering is prompt. They have a good selection of toppings, which is cool for someone who puts avocado on everything. 

Their onion rings are so large, you could probably house homeless people in them for the winter. That may be my only gripe about the place."}
{"text":"W Burger Bar offers a dish of celery and carrot sticks along with ranch dipping to patrons once seated! I noticed this to be very thoughtful considering how long I had to wait for my food to arrive. The service was a bit slow but I understood that since the whole place was jam packed with paying customers. 
The only reason I stopped by here was because I heard a huge rave about this restaurant and their burgers so I wanted to check it out for myself, but what I experienced here was a bit disappointing. Biting into their burger, I found the bun to be cold and the patties very dry and extremely hard to swallow. I felt like I was going to choke on it if I had swallowed the pruned up chunk of meat so I had to wash it down with some water. Honestly, the only dishes that stood out to me were their poutine and onion rings! Gravy and soft curds of cheese on top of fresh Yukon gold fries, I'm sure the Quebecois would be proud of. As for the onion rings, they are the best! Made to order and they were the ULTIMATE crispy onion rings I've ever eaten. YAY for the sides NAY for the burger."}
{"text":"Fries were borderline soggy and a bit greasy. Beef burger was dry, tasteless, overcooked, and full of gristle which I spent a good bit of time spitting out. Reminds me of that Seinfeld mutton episode. Atmosphere wasn't bad, but I won't be going back if I have anything to say about it. Here's the secret recipe for their burgers if you want to make them at home: go to the grocery store, buy some beef, throw it in the oven until dry, place on a bun. Voila."}
{"text":"Burger Bars are popping up everywhere these days. With a groupon deal in hand, we decided to check this place out on a weekday night. Although seemingly small storefront, turned out to be bigger than we thought inside. The place was dimly light, as I suppose a bar usually is. 

We got down to ordering a bison and lamb burger with half-and-half fries. The burgers were home-made and were good portion sizes. Both burgers were well done, extra kick with chipotle mayo. For two hungry folks, it was nice filling meal. 

Not sure if I would be back, without another groupon deal. Like most other places, the overpriced hype doesn't always live up."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some take-out fries. They were delicious but the atmosphere was very strange! It was like people eating burgers in a nightclub while furiously texting each other because the music was too loud."}
{"text":"People's opinions of Burger Bar are going to be greatly afffected by what they're expecting. Don't expect an amazing classic cheeseburger like from Burger's Priest or extremely indulgent toppings like from Dangerous Dan's. What you should expect, is well priced specials, (very) cheap beer, and a great selection of toppings.

The best value on the menu is generally whatever is being offered as the deal of the day (for instance, today was $10 for a bison burger, side, and a pop) but the quality of the protobella burger shouldn't be overlooked either. However, what scores the burgers the most points is the great selection of toppings. You can choose as many as you want from a wide selection including cilantro yogurt, chiptle mustard, beets, etc. etc. With a little creativity, you can make a fantastic meal.

The incredible beers prices shouldn't be overlooked either. Especially when the selection of watering holes is so meager in the area, Burger Bar is a decent place to go for a bit and a drink."}
{"text":"Great gourmet burger place for anyone wanting to eat a healthy burger meal.  We came here for lunch.  We ordered the beef burgers with goat cheese salad.  The toppings are top notch with uncommon items like beets and alfalfa.  The patty is good.

Based on other reviews, it looks like this place can be inconsistent.  Our burgers were hits.  Similar to the other posters, we care a lot about high salt content common to other restaurants.  The patties we had were fine for salt content."}
{"text":"Some complaints here about dry burgers, mine was nice and juicy and not over salted.  I believe it is a new business so perhaps it took some time to get their groove on.  I'm sure the leaky roof has been fixed, we were there during a fairly large snow melt.  
I noticed the place while on the bike path right behind it last fall, was up in the area looking at some lighting so I decided to give it a try.  
Great anti biotic free beef burger at a price similar to the more fast food oriented places.  Killer onion rings and delicious onion rings.  Beer and wine list could be better.  Service was like being at a new friends house who was really trying to impress you.  
I'll be back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch a few days ago, after someone recommended this burger joint. The food was quite tasty while dining in, whether it was the beef burger & fries, potato skins and banana Split.  Would revisit again sometime soon."}
{"text":"One of the worst meals I've had delivered in Toronto.

The food arrived stone cold - not a lick of warmth remaining. And that was just the beginning.

I ordered the portobello burger. Do you know what I paid $9 for? A grilled portobello cap on a bun. That's it. No toppings or condiments. Just a mushroom cap on a dry bun. I was floored. It wasn't even tasty. It was just grilled. 

My roommate and I both ordered onion rings. Each order contains exactly 4 onion rings. Granted, they are massive. Like as big as your fist, massive. But they are several layers of huge onions, which the batter does not stick to. Neither one of us could even eat one whole ring. 

The Greek salad was fine.

So for $30 we got an ok side salad, 8 onion rings, and 1 portobello cap on a bun. Total rip off."}
{"text":"I give it four stars because the only thing disappointing is the atmosphere. There is so much TV noise that I cannot even hear my own thoughts. I do love the burgers, the condiments are great because they have so much selection for my picky needs !
The fries are to die for, I cannot fathom a life without those delicious skinny fries. The service was good also just on busy nights they are a bit slower, so don't go when your on the verge of starvation ! 

Great food recomend this place to anybody :)"}
{"text":"Best burgers I've had in a very long time. Service was quick and friendly. The food was great - like being in someone's backyard for a great barbecue. Fries were tasty and fresh. Definitely worth trying and then worth coming back."}
{"text":"I read great reviews on Yelp and was in the neighborhood with family so we popped in. W Burger Bar has a warm and fun ambiance with a lot of menu options for food and spiked milkshakes. We had burgers, poutine, salad, and onion rings. Everything was delicious and fresh. This is more of an upscale version of pub food, and the ingredients are creative, colorful and delicious. I highly recommend you eat here!"}
{"text":"Tried the Bison burger, the meat was good but the bun was cold as if refrigerated.  I like all the options of condiments and toppings you can choose to have on your burger.  
I have had better burgers and if I were to return I would try their sampler.  Luckily we ended up going at a time where the apps were half price as well as the burger.  I would have been really disappointed if I were to pay $18.99+HST+tip for a burger that wasn't what I expected it to be. 
We also ordered the deep fried pickles potato skins & breaded onion rings.  The pickles tasted like every other restaurant, they probably all receive the same product.  The onion rings were large and tasty but oily.  The potato skins were my favourite, very flavourful and topped with real bacon.   
Service was friendly and fast. 
I think most people go to this restaurant for the cheap drinks."}
{"text":"Only OK. The key to this place is to ask them to toast the buns, because otherwise you get them cold. Blows my mind. Also, burgers seem underseasoned, maybe next time I will ask for extra salt. Lots of topping choices otherwise. 

Although they don't know how to make a burger without your help, make sure to have panko onion rings, those are great! And the cheap beer."}
{"text":"I Love the atmosphere, the top shelf drink selection of scotches, the beers they have on tap are really good beers not just your regular bar tap. When is the last time you've seen Sleeman Honey Brown on tap?
What i like the most about this place is the modern atmosphere, and the menu has a real homey feeling to it, you just wanna try everything.

I had the Aussie-Rules burger with sliced pineapple, beets, and a fried egg topped with BBQ sauce, cooked medium, and i loved it.
I really wanna go back to try other stuff on the menu like the Salmon burger with wasabi sauce, or the Lamb burger, or the Turkey burger.
they have sweet potato fries and Panko breaded chicken strips.

I'm gonna save up my burger bucks for more burgers."}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME! onion rings are with chipotle mayo are WAY too good. I've been frequenting this place for a few years and the service and quality of food has been consistently fantastic.
Also a great place for hilariously named shots for super cheap annnnd for a cheap pitcher."}
{"text":"We went there on a Friday night with a baby and they were very accommodating to us.  They were very busy, maybe a bit short staffed.  Lots of seating, looks smaller from the outside.
Big downfall for our visit, out of lamb burger.  With so many restaurants in Toronto, I usually never go back, so that was very disappointing.  Especially since they didn't tell us until we ordered.  So all three of us were ordering it, and when he came to take our order we had to choose something else.  
I think because they were so busy the waiter made some mistakes on our toppings.  No big deal, he had them fixed and gave us some very nice discount, even though we told him not to."}
{"text":"Had the lamb burger and sweet potato fries. Nice atmosphere. Good service. Solid 3/5."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try since I was starving and craving a burger. Pleased to see they had Bison on the menu but unfortunately it is farm raised. First sign. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and tried it anyway. When took a bite into it I was confused. The taste was so bland and dry. I had to ask the waitress if it was indeed Bison. To me it tasted like a cheap, over-processed beef patty. Continued takin small bites but it did not get any better and there were crunchy bits. The burger was not juicy just over cooked. (Not worth the price) Had them replace it with a turkey burger and it was easier to get down my throat but still subpar in my burger experience. Sweet potato fries are standard. Ill stick to eating wild meat.


What a miss"}
{"text":"Burger moyen. Important il faut rajouter chaque aliment et donc la note peut monter vite. Le pain était froid. Service expeditif."}
{"text":"This place gets busy but there's a good reason. The food is good,
it's reasonably priced and the usually have a $2 beer special. (12 oz mug) The service is good and the food is tasty. Don't worry if your
not into beef, the offer veggie and salmon burgers as well.  The 
fries were also very good...."}
{"text":"I ordered a lamb burger and my friend ordered a bison burger. My burger was a little bland and the toppings were nothing special. The garlic Herb sauce was also pretty standard. My friends burger was actually cold and sent it back. Waitress did take it off his bill. Overall the service was slow and that may also contributed to the cold burger."}
{"text":"So many burger joints, so little time.

I wanted to check this place out since it opened and only managed to get over there last week. Well, it was worth the wait and I'm happy I finally made it in there. My experience overall was a good one, with a hiccup here and there, but I'd still go back (that's how much I enjoyed the burger).

When my friend and I got there (just before 1pm) so at the height of lunch hour, there was only one table left on the patio (and rightfully so as it was a beautifully hot, breezy, summer day). We wanted to explore the op for a/c, but the inside was p-a-c-k-e-d. No harm done. Outside we went, and beneath an umbrella so it was totally tolerable.

For a burger joint, the service could definitely be faster (and by that I mean the time between ordering and getting your burger). I mean really, it's lunch hour, you're a small venue in a super high-traffic location -- I'd expect that you have your timing figured out by now. Understaffed, poorly staffed - not my problem. Fix it. Another tiny hiccup was when my burger arrived and when I lifted the top bun, I found that none of the condiments I ordered were on it. Standard ketchup / mustard / relish please - I'm not high maintenance :) Then, I advise the server and she tells me \"you didn't tell me that when you ordered\", to which my friend piped up \"yes, she did\". I was a little taken aback that the server would #1 say that outright, especially when I HAD ordered it, and #2 wouldn't have just taken my burger back, got the toppings and returned it. Anyway, after checking my order in the computer she did admit to having missed that. Redeemed? Sure. Slightly annoyed. Yes.

BUT. The burger. was worth the hassle and I'm pretty confident that it won't happen again (or hope anyway because I'm going back for sure). D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S. And I just had the basic beef burger. As long as service proves to be good from now on, I plan to taste a different burger each time I go."}
{"text":"The classic beef burgers are what have made W a popular burger joint, but don't discount the chicken and salmon burgers, which are actually very generous portions of grilled chicken breast and grilled salmon fillets - they taste great and are a very health conscious choice too (particularly if you go for the whole wheat buns).

Sweet potato fries are hit and miss; some days they are thick and tasty, while others they are too thin and almost burnt.

Here is a tip: I usually order many extra toppings on the side and the servers don't seem to mind. Even if all the toppings don't make it into my burger, they make a nice side salad :)"}
{"text":"Best poutine in Toronto!  I especially liked la poutine quebecoise.

Went there for lunch on a Wednesday and the Kobe burger was half price.  Delicious burger!  The shakes and alcoholic shakes are excellent.  Good selection of beers on tap.  I wish I had ordered a drink in a fishbowl but I needed to make room for the large poutine!"}
{"text":"We went here to kill time & hunger cravings before our movie started. All 4 waitresses completely ignored us and we must have waited for 20+ mins before we flagged the manager to take our orders. Once the food got there, we had to book it out to catch our movie, which we were late for.  Finally the manager gave us a card for complimentary slider on our next visit, which was nice, but I won't be going back there."}
{"text":"The first time we eat at it was a great experience; however, we went again recently but the burger was greasy."}
{"text":"I love this place so much, I made a video review...

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuB569uZSEw"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT MEAL, FRIENDLY STAFF, AND VERY LITTLE WAITING TIME! Went here with my girlfriend after having a horrible experience at Volo *******DON'T EAT AT BAR VOLO, ABSOLUTELY AWFUL****** We were seated right away, and treated with some veggies and dip upon sitting. We ordered deep fried pickles to start which were very tasty and delivered right away. Ordered the bison burger for dinner, whole list of toppings to choose from. When paired with some $2 shots and a 22 oz beer, our night of treachery at Bar Volo turned into a fortunate mistake since we ended up at W Burger Bar and enjoyed the hell out of it. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great quality burger bar with fresh food and great taste. One of my favourite places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome.  I'd avoid the turkey burger because it is for clowns and it doesn't taste good.

The stuff that does taste good is the delicious beef sliders.  You can get 5 of them for like 9 bucks or something.  They have endless amounts of toppings, you can do your burger up however you want.  Like you'd assume, there's pitchers of beers that are moderately priced.

Oh and there's Kobe beef sliders/burgers.  I didn't bother, because from what I understand they WILL NOT cook it medium rare, which in my opinion is pretty much ridiculous.  Other than that folks, this place is worth a poke and a half.

The waitresses aren't as dope as Duff's but who cares?  When was the last time you've boned a waitress anyways?

I wish there was one of these in Boston.  It was a nice place to chill and pound my favorite of all foods, BURGERS."}
{"text":"I come here all the time and love it. Great food and service at a reasonable price. The $11 PBR pitchers are a nice touch!"}
{"text":"i popped by there the other night just to check out the selection with a friend. i've driven by there a couple times before and it always looked busy. it's definitely one of the more upper scale burger joints in toronto, and the manner which the food is served speaks to it.  it's not often that you get comp veggies with dip but i guess that's to offset the massive orgy of meat that you're about to consume!

we ordered their burger sampler with their spicy chili poutine with a couple of pints to wash it down. this is the only place i've come across where you can order slider-sized burgers. if you're not familiar with white castle or the first harold and kumar movie, sliders are about the size diameter wise as a grade lid at starbucks, and because of that, i'm guessing that's why our burgers ended up the way they were. 

the sampler comprised of their beef, turkey, lamb, bison and kobe burger in the aforementioned size. of the five, only the beef had any semblance of moisture in it, close to medium.  the rest were more than medium well. the only thing that saved the burgers were the toppings which were the recommended topping for each burger with the exception of the kobe.  the blue cheese didn't seem to agree with the somewhat charred piece of meat it was placed upon.  

the poutine that we also ordered was great, once you dug out from under the mound of chili that was piled onto it.  the chili itseld was not as spicy was we were was anticipating, somewhere between mild and medium.  underneath, the cheese was nicely melted. the fries itself is nothing special and seemed the same as you'd get at any other burger joint.  

i'll still give it another shot but order the normal sized burger just to see if those burgers were an anomaly or that's just how they do it there. i'm hoping it was."}
{"text":"Was in this area for an appointment and hungry.  I didn't want to look for somewhere to eat so I went with the burger bar because you can't go wrong with burgers.  There was a lunch special of $8.85 for burger and fries and $2.00 Pabst blue ribbon beer.  I didn't realize any of these specials ... I just walked in and sat at the bar and ordered a burger and fries and a everything was suggested to me.  The staff were great!  Very friendly and didn't miss a thing.  The burger was okay.... the bun was a bit crumbly and the fries were tiny ... which are my least favourite way to eat fries.  Overall it was a good dining experience."}
{"text":"I'm really surprised at this place's good reviews. If you're really looking for a high-quality burger (why wouldn't you, it's called W Burger Bar?) then please try somewhere else. Let me list the ways this place has disappointed me:

1. The Burgers
I've tried two burger variations and both were flops. Each time I received an over-cooked and mealy patty served on an uninspiring bun with a few decent garnishes. The fries were slightly above-average.

2. The Acoustics
If you would like to be able to converse with someone or even if you would like to leave without a splitting headache, this is not the place for you. I have no problems with noise level in a crowded bar, but despite the name this is more of a restaurant. It's often packed (I'll explain why later) and somehow the volume of the crowd reaches a fever pitch that couldn't be penetrated by the crumpling of a Sun Chips bag.

3. The Service
The servers are demeaned with whorish outfits (usually not a big problem for me), but they all seem to thoroughly hate their lives. Every waitress I've had has been slow, snooty, and annoying.

How did this place get 2 stars instead of 1, you ask? CHEAP BEER. I don't think there's any cheaper beer in the city. You can get a pitcher of PBR for $8. Yes, I said a PITCHER for EIGHT dollars. It's ridiculous.

Summary:
Don't go there to eat. Don't go there to talk. Don't go there for good service. Go for cheap beer."}
{"text":"Well priced burger and well cooked. Their pulled pork is so good! Drinks are great too! Spiked milkshake~"}
{"text":"I went there with a groupon. The burgers were dry and overcooked. They had a limited selection of beer on tap. The pitcher of Sleeman we ordered was flat (even though they told us it was a new keg). Their poutine was good (being from Quebec, I'm usually pretty picky when it comes down to poutine). Their facility was in a so-so neighborhoud. The roof of the place was leaking on other customer. The service was great though. It was not a horrible experience, but I'm not sure I would go back (and don't go there after a rainy day or you'll get rained on inside the building!)."}
{"text":"The have the best fries and gravy but unfortunately their burgers were so dry you can choke."}
{"text":"Came where with a bunch of friends at around 8:00PM on a weekday as well as ordered take-out a week later.

The dine-in visit:

Had to wait about 30 minutes for a table and there was no where to really stand and wait. The area by the door was kind of small and there was a lot of people coming in and out and waitresses grabbing menus from the ledge by the door. But that's okay, it's downtown Toronto. Places are small, that's expected. Also, for a small place, i found it to be very loud and the tables were a little close together.

We ordered two pitchers of Sleeman, which was decently priced and two people ordered the fishbowl drinks. The fishbowl drinks tasted nice and fruity but couldn't really taste the alcohol. My friends mostly ordered burgers. I personally ordered a poutine and my boyfriend had the chicken fingers. All the tables were full that night but no one waiting at the door. We had to wait about 30 minutes for food to arrive. A little long, in my opinion. My poutine was amazing! I really enjoyed it. Too bad I only got a small one. The chicken fingers were forgettable. They weren't terrible, just nothing special about them. The burgers looked really well done. 

When the bill came, I liked the fact that they were able to split the cost of the pitchers evenly between all those who drank but the waitress messed up a little by also charging one of the people who didn't drink. That's okay though, there were like 10 of us so it got kind of confusing. It was an easy fix. Overall, it wasn't a bad experience.

The take-out
I liked that fact that we were able to order online in advance and then head over to pick it up. We ordered two burgers and two poutines. I thought the burgers were over-cooked and wasn't too well seasoned. I wouldn't get it again. However, the poutine is still good and I am absolutely a fan of them.



Overall, I like the poutine and drinks there but there's nothing special about the burger. If you do order the burger, ask for it to be cooked medium/medium well or else they will overcook them."}
{"text":"I dropped in W Burger Bar in the early afternoon and after a long day of doctor appointments. So I was ready for a treat! I ordered the beef burger and went with basic topings to see how it measures up. I was asked \"how u would like my burger cooked\" which you rarely hear these days!  The beef Patti was thicker than average, very well made and to my order.  And They make their own buns everyday! 
I ordered small fries with my burger and I always manage to finish my fries an burger everywhere else. Not here though, the burgers are not small, very yummy and require at least 2 napkins! I will definitely go back to try the lamb burger and the poutin!"}
{"text":"Really, really, really gross. Holy hell, it wasn't a question of what went wrong... it was a question of what didn't go wrong! I'm going to write this review in point form - excessive elaboration might cause you to vomit.

- Crunchy joints and tube-like vein thingys in my bison burger
- Filthy kitchen and dining room floors - fries, napkins and dirt all over!
- No soap in the ladies
- Arrogant staff - this once was a great place.. now the manager and waitstaff don't give a F@#! if you have an issue. 

My only regret with this review, I forgot to take pictures of my crappy meal.

Thanks WBB for giving me no reason to come back here..."}
{"text":"Food arrives quickly. Burgers are very good. Not the best I've ever had but very good. Buns are good and suit the burgers. Fries are terrible. Stringy and cold. The draft beer is poured well. Staff look and dress as though they were hired for their looks alone but are surprisingly pleasant, efficient and accomodating. The place is way too loud - not much can be done there without installing some sound insulation overhead. The TVs are left on the same sports channel regardless of what is on. Really? A 30-minute infomercial on new cars? Some customers are pretty boorish but what do you expect from Yonge St?"}
{"text":"No complaints but no real raves either.
I had the beef burger with 1/2 regular fries and 1/2 sweet potato fries. I have never seen that offered on a menu before, which is a nice option.
As I expected, the sweet potato fries were soggy, but still OK. The regular fries were also OK. They tasted frozen - but, to be fair, they do not claim to serve fresh-cut fries. Though I kind of expected fresh from this establishment.
The burger was good and I liked the variety of toppings, but not a standout. It was a bit on the bread-y side, in that the proportion of meat-to-bun wasn't optimal (though I did have the whole wheat bun, which may be a factor).
The service wasn't great, either. One waitress took my order; another delivered my food (and, while definitely not cold, wasn't hot-of-the-grill either); a third waitress bussed my table and delivered my cheque. Nobody checked up on my meal - servers should do this at least once, and it was not in the middle of a shift change, nor was it that busy either.
All in all, I have no problem going back - but I would not be the one to suggest this place either. I would rank Big Smoke, Great Burger Kitchen and Acme Burger all above this place, (but I would still rank HERO below). For about $13.00 + tip, it was adequate."}
{"text":"I'm pleased to report that since my last visit (last December), W Burger Bar has only improved. The vegetarian burger is still hella tasty, the fries definitely upgraded (lots of little crunchy bits = thumbs up), and - AND - $2 PBR!!! I don't even LIKE beer very much, and I ordered two of them. When it's that cheap, and you're eating a burger... it kind of makes perfect sense. 

Let me reiterate here: TWO DOLLAR BEER."}
{"text":"Been a long time patron of W Burger Bar and my only regret is that they don't stay open later than they do on weekdays.

I started visiting when it first opened (they had awesome burger deals in the beginning!) but have since then stopped eating most of their menu items, not because I don't like them but my visits have transitioned into a late night poutine-and-beer kinda deal. I really enjoy their poutine, they give a good amount of cheese and gravy although there have been times where they miss. 

For you burger buffs, their burgers are good - I just haven't been eating meat patties for a while. Their portobello mushroom burger is done just right, not breaded and deep-fried like other places' nonsense (what a waste of a portobello patty). This one is marinated perfectly and juicy. 

And you can have cheap beer with your nice big carnivorous meal! Pabst Blue Ribbon pints for $9.99. What a beautiful blend of gourmet fancy meets classy hipster.

{"text":"Great service and flavourful burgers. If the basic burger tasted this great, I can imagine how yummy the others in the menu would be. The topping selection is great. I don't know if Frank is the manager or owner but he really knows how to serve his customers. He introduced himself and checked in periodically to ensure we were satisfied with our meal, and this is in addition to our server doing the same. I felt like I was being treated like a princess so there's no reason why I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Amazing experience. Party of two. All the waitresses were attentive to every question we had as it was our first time being at this location. I had the chicken burger with a side of Onion Rings and all I have to say was that it was the best chicken burger I have ever consumed in my life. What really caught my attention however was the fact that the cooks, during there downtime were ensuring that the work area was clean, literally scrubbing the smoke ventilator from the top of the grill with a sponge. I was very impressed and I will definitely come back again very soon!"}
{"text":"I waited 30 minutes for a salad in a takeout line?  Because they have only one cook during lunch hour... (Yo managment, the guy needs help back there!)  It goes without saying that I won't be going back for that again. I don't have time to waste at lunch, and for a couple dollars extra, there's a much better balance of food, price and experience."}
{"text":"So over the weekend, I got the chance to sit in at this resto.  I've gotten take out before and because of that, things were a bit soggy because it and less crunchy (onion rings) so it wasn't a good way to review the restaurant as a whole.

We had about 14 people and it was a Saturday night so it was pretty busy.

Decor/Ambiance:
W Burger Bar definitely puts effort into making it more trendy and modern vs. a traditional pub or burger joint.  I guess you could say this is an upscale burger joint.  And the \"bar\" designation is correct to a certain extent where you can order some drinks and sit at the bar counter (from what I recall). But seriously, if you want to go a bar to drink, this place is too small for that type of crowd.  Like a bar though, this place is loud.  Don't expect to have deep intimate conversations here unless you want to to upgrade to a potential yelling match.

Food:

**Best [I've ever had] ONION RINGS segway**

Most people that I talk to always comment on the onion rings of this place being wicked and I will vouch for all those ppl that it is indeed true.  This place has probably one of the best onion rings in the city (comparable to Ruths Chris, Turtle Jacks).  The way they're breaded is what makes it different because it's not a traditional beer batter.  Also, did I forget to mention that they're huge?!

**Best [I've ever had] ONION RINGS END**

The burgers themselves are probably average in my books.  The first time I went, I ordered a Kobe Beef burger because I figured I might as well since I don't go often.  The second time I went, I ordered a bison burger.  It's unfortunate to say, that both burger meats taste the same to me.  So, in my mind, the Kobe Beef is not worth the 20$.  I do appreciate their large selection of toppings and even a fried egg! 
Both times, I've opted for the fried egg and bacon along with other condiments.  These are good burgers but not spectacular by far.  My friend said the Chicken burger was good so maybe it's worth trying other meats like salmon as well to see for yourself.

Service:
As it was a busy night, I would expect things to be a bit chaotic.  I do appreciate what these people have to go through sometimes and that waiting on tables can be a bit stressful.  Unfortunately though, the service was really slow and our orders were forgotten a lot.


Overall:  
This is a good place to go to if you're in the area and want to eat a burger. Because in that vicinity, it's probably the only place to go to but if you're not in the mood to wait or want to be more low key, you should probably choose something else.  But if you're looking for a lively night out accompanied by burgers, then by all means!"}
{"text":"I personally do not love this place since the food isn't good here. The good thing about this place is its location and the very cheap pitchers of beers.

The burgers here are dryyy, I can taste the low grade beef being used in the patties here, they do have a nice smoky flavor though so I will give them that, the bun is your standard run of the mill bun, it isn't even toasted. Anyways do not expect great burgers here.The onion rings are huge but greasy and some times you get soggy ones -  not great.

The atmosphere is like a typical sports bar, lots of college students come here since the food isn't that expensive and the beers are pretty cheap for the area, I think a pitcher of PBR is about $10.

Service is usually pretty good, the waitresses check on you sporadically, but isn't intrusive. Overall, I can see why some people might like this place (eg for predrinking), but I am not really into that kind of thing, so for me I wouldn't come here unless my friends insist."}
{"text":"Location: Located just west of Yonge St on College (you'll see a Starbucks on that corner) is W Burger Bar. Walkable distance from Green P street parking at $2.50/hour.

Facility: Standard pub with plenty of flatscreen TVs and decent music. The ambiance is quite loud, so you'll have to yell at your friends to hear them. Washrooms are decent.

Food Quality & Price: We were craving poutine and turned to Yelp for recommendations. The regular poutine dubbed Poutine Quebecois was justly priced for it's size and tasted great. The fries are SKINNY but it does not compromise flavour. W Burger Bar was also very generous with gravy and cheese curds. We also ordered the sweet potato fries (also very thing, like McDonalds). It was also delicious. 

Service: Good service with a smile from both the ladies and the gents. Fast, and checked in on us just the right amount of times. Never felt rushed.

Overall: Great place to go for pub fare and poutine. The crowd looked to be in their 20s and it was generally pretty loud. If you're in the area and have no idea what to eat or where to go, if you've got a diverse group who can't decide, W Burger Bar won't let you down."}
{"text":"Came here with three other friends for a late lunch.

We ordered the potato skins, one turkey slider (since after all, this is a burger joint) with a side salad, the portobello burger with a side of sweet potato fries, a large poutine and a nonalcoholic chocolate milkshake.

The potato skins were dry and lacked flavour. The complimentary dip helped a little, but overall it was forgettable. The slider/salad were also pretty forgettable. The portobello burger was nothing special but what was really atrocious were the sweet potato fries. They were stale, greasy, exclusively crunchy and tasted as if they'd been fried twice-- as if they'd been left over from someone else's meal and deep fried yet again and reserved. They were so bad that we had to send them back. The gravy and cheese for the poutine were decent but the fries tasted stale, not unlike the sweet potato fries. 

The milkshake however was delicious and gigantic, it kind of tasted like chocolate ice cream mixed with milk and was well worth $5.

The service was fantastic and the waitress even took the price of the sweet potato fries off our bill although that didn't nearly make up for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Great burgers fries and sweet potato fries. Fishbowl drinks are great and very cheap ! Service is okay not the best but for the high volume of guests in the restaurant is completely understandable.. I bring all my friends here and would definitely recommend !"}
{"text":"I went in on a weekday afternoon and ordered a steak burger. It was perhaps the most delicious burger I've ever had. The only downside is that the waitresses don't pay much attention to you after you've gotten your food."}
{"text":"well well, I liked this place a lot!  A group of us went to get a booze and burger fix (why there aren't more places that specialize in these two things exclusively is a mystery).
Anyways, although it was a pretty crowded weekend night we managed to get a good seat very quickly and our waitress was great.
The food was pretty good, and the menu had a lot of option, different meats, veggie options, different buns (lettuce included) and sauces. If anything it was almost over-whelming. But when i finally did make a decision it was tasty.
There own take on mixed drinks were pretty good too, not too sweet and not overly alcoholic. And the best part...the boozy milkshakes, although to be honest it would be very very hard to mess up a boozy milkshake, but they were really great."}
{"text":"OK, so I'm just going to go ahead and give this place 5 stars.

Of all the \"boutique\" burger joints who've infiltrated beef-lovin' Toronto in the past couple of years, W Burger Bar's burgers, and onion rings, have risen above all the rest.

Burger options are endless and most additional toppings are free (awesome!), and we're not just talking fancy sauces. Definitely try their panko-crusted onion rings, which are huge, delicious, and enough to share between three people. 

Service is average - they look to be university girls making extra beer money, so who really cares - but if you get a chance to talk to the owner (?), a jolly older man, he's the kinda guy that loves to hear what you think about the place. The space is comfortable and dressed up, though there are signs of it's past life in the scratched up walls, and there are flat screen TVs broadcasting sports 'round the clock.

But all those things aside, let me reiterate that the burgers are delicious.

Next on my list to try? Their spiked milkshakes..... mmm..., and maybe a splurge on their $20 Kobe beef burger."}
{"text":"First time and went with friends for drinks.shots there were 2.50 - 3.50. Amazing service by the waitress. Very quick on our order even though a busy Friday night and food was great. Would recommend the pullpork nachos to anyone."}
{"text":"Great burgers that you can order cooked medium (leaving them nice and juicy).  The topping selection is tops.  Decent fries too, of which you can get a half and half of sweet potato and regular ol' potato.   And a pitcher of PBR for under $10 at such a convenient location (streetcar/subway intersection).  The only real problem is that its usually pretty full and the seating really isn't great for groups of 5 or more."}
{"text":"c'mon are you serious.. this place has got to be one of the worst service burger joints I've been to in the city. 

yes the look is nice, a dark ambiance, a few big screen to watch the game, a bar, some nice sounding menu selections. beauty is only skin deep. 

let me tell you what happened.

so we ordered a couple of burgers, onion rings and fries. nothing exotic or out of the ordinary. the side orders were great thanks for the tip on that one! the onion rings are huuge and battered nicely  but the  the staple of the meal, the burger was dismal an overcooked patty. 

I specially requested that it NOT be overcooked when ordering, they said the house cooks them medium ok , well obviously our request was ignored because it was tough and well done. we're not the only ones this has happened to. i've read that in other yelp reviews also had noticed this. .

From the get go the service was very slow, about 20min wait for the burger, we asked for water about 3 times from 3 different servers and didn't get it until 15min in -- is this really necessary?  no wait staff checked on us the entire time we were there, not even a glance, is this a full service restaurant or just a takeout establishment?  because it seems like the latter.

we also asked for the bill on 2 occasions.. I just wanted to leave the place after finishing. i wasn't going to ask them to re-do the burgers, we don't have another 20 minutes to waste.

seriously to the manager, review your quality of service and food , your signature  burgers from the kitchen are overcooked and your servers don't give a flying hoot 

to anyone else considering going here, you are the well informed consumer who do the research before deciding to spend your hard earned money.  save it.
 
you can get a better tasting 'gourmet' burger at even a franchise establishment like heroes or south street burger. those establishments can deliver a better experience than what I had experienced at W."}
{"text":"This was my second visit to W Burger Bar, once after a night out for bar snacks and beer, and this was my first time coming in for dinner. 

I had the bison burger which was overcooked and dry, Bison is a meat with much less fat than beef and they cooked it enough to essentially ruin the meat. I requested extra spouts on my burger which they did deliver though. kitchen gets 2/5

Management/Service gets 0/5
My $11 à la carte bison burger had a huge piece of gristle in it. I only ate half and informed the server that I was unimpressed with the nasty inedible chunk of not meat. They took my burger and proceeded to charge full price for what was a poorly cooked, and overally gross piece of meat. I will certainly not be going back fo have food. the decor is nice enough and beer is reasonably priced to have a drink or two, but dinner there is certainly no longer on my list."}
{"text":"very good food and the service was also very good
my only thing is it is a bit noisy but I am an old fogy
it is also very reasonable"}
{"text":"Really great spot if you're looking for a quick lunch or dinner (or craving a burger). Veggie options are great, too - really- even my non veggie father liked the mushroom! 
Will 100% go back. Also, the staff and owner are very doting and take care of you. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Went here Tuesday with a groupon. Our server Emily was great! Told her we had a bus to catch to the Buffalo airport and had to be out in 45 mins, sure enough we were! We had the bison burgers which were mouthwatering good! The bison was very juicy and tender and all the toppings were very fresh. My boyfriend and I also shared a poutine, got the large which is a great size for 2 to share. We also had a pitcher of Sleeman, at $12.99 why not? Nothing is better than an ice cold beer with your burger. Really happy we found this place. Definitely will be back for more bison burgers!"}
{"text":"Great service. Amazing onion rings. Had the burger with blue cheese. Cooked right the way i like it."}
{"text":"I work around the corner and will admit I've spent a few evenings here for a familiar reason others have noted, cheap beer. 

I've had the burgers a few times, no complaints, but definitely still a little shy of other gourmet burger joints in town for the price.  Really nothing special. 

The room is definitely loud, and is almost always full for the after work crowd. 

Service is usually good, but can depend on the server. For the most part, they're quite attentive. 

If you're looking for a place for cheap draft, it's a go. if it wasn't for that, however, I'd probably start thinking about other options as there are a ton in this area."}
{"text":"I've been here quite a few times, I find it to be very mediocre. Food isn't bad but nothing fantastic either. It's a good go-to spot for cheap pitchers (of PBR to be specific). They have awesome choices for tasty drinks, $2.50 shooters as well but they're at that price for a reason. Service is friendly too. All in all, average resto/bar."}
{"text":"I will admit I did not indulge in a burger, although I was eying up the turkey burger while going through the menu. The chicken tenders and panko onion rings are delicious, though. And I can't say enough good things about the spiked milkshakes. Sure, they're $10 each, but so are most drinks at bars downtown. A good way to get your buzz on if you're not into slamming back Sleeman's Honey (a pitcher goes for $12.99 - deal!) or their fruity, sugary shooters.

Prices are reasonable and range depends on what you're after. A meal for two people adds up to about $30, but drinks will raise your bill like at every other restaurant in existence.

Service is good. One night I was there with a large group and the place was packed. Our server did the best she could, albeit she had far more tables than she could handle. Shit happens. We all got our food and drinks and when one big bill came, I helped her separate it into 12.

A new location is coming near Eglinton and Caledonia and I'm excited to not have to go downtown for a milkshake."}
{"text":"Had a bison burger. It was $10.99. It was....like a 7/10. 

That's good, mind you. There were aprx. 40 free toppings for the burgers. I asked for all of them but they wouldn't do it. Assholes. 

Avacado, Bacon, Cheese are extra btw 1-$2.50.

Bathrooms: Clean. Urinal way too low. Heard the owners were midgets 
(not a joke) so maybe that's why.

Interior: Good. Clean. You can watch the dudes sling burgers. Maybe a little too bright, but they'll dim lights if you ask them to.

Beer: OK, This is the big draw. A pitcher of PBR for $8.99. This beats Toby's for cheapest pitcher. Are you reading this? This may be the best deal for beer in Toronto--- and in a setting not repulsive, as one might expect. 


Oh, I'll be back"}
{"text":"A great little spot downtown for a crowd that's mostly students and young professionals. Affordable meals and some fun cocktails on offer, this place is always busy with good reason - Their service is fantastic. The few times I got beef burgers here they were a little on the dry side. A little more fat in their mince would soon fix that and keep everything juicy. All in all, a good spot to catch up with friends without breaking the bank."}
{"text":"my 2nd fave place for gourmet burgers (after burger shoppe). they have 10 kinds of burgers...from lamb, turkey, chicken, portabello mushrooms and yes BISON! the meat is fresh and patties can be grilled to your liking (i'm always med rare!). the best part about this place are the endless free toppings! there's no additional charge, unless your specifically order a topping that's extra (most cheese toppings). you can create your own burger with anything :) they also have burgers with recommended toppings (eg. lamb with mint jelly & asiago cheese - that are always $3-4 extra). i usually get myself 4-5 different toppings on the side and experiment, they're usually really nice about giving you extra toppings on the side. so go ahead and get a variety, a lot of their sauces make for good dipping for their fries too. they've got a plate of sliders which is a good way to sample 4 of their burgers. their sides of fries, sweet potato fries and poutines are separate but really worth it. meals are usually around $12-15 per person. 
must try: lamb burger with yogurt cilantro, sauteed onions, alfalfa sprouts and sweet potato fries :)"}
{"text":"A great stop to pick up a hearty protein-packed lunch.  

I love, love chipotle ketchup.  The smokey flavor from the chipotle compliments the char-grilled beef patty perfectly.  Highly recommended.  The beef itself was okay, not as juicy and flavorful as I would like.  The shoestring fries were a disappointment.  They were soft and soggy, with a lot of broken end pieces in the bowl.

Classy décor.  Light color walls and dark furnitures give off a modern yet classic space.  The best thing about this restaurant was the service, fast, attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"This place is pretty great!
Its kinda like the go to place for my friends and I. Beer is cheap $10 pitcher...only if you get Pabts Blue Ribbon .

If you go on weekend evenings get ready to wait, this place gets really packed. 
Its a loud place...gets louder as the night goes on.

Food is not too bad. Try the sweet potato fries or the Poutine!!

Service is usually good but some servers are hit and miss.
Deff a place to go and check out!!

I still have to try the fishbowl"}
{"text":"I just ordered the burger. They had good prices for food and drinks. The burger was really good. Lots of variety for toppings and cheese. My only complaint was the bun. It was dry and otherwise boring. I would have rather removed the bun and just ate the burger. I hope next time they don't serve me a dry hard bun. I definitely would go back though, it was a relaxing environment, a few tvs showing sports and friendly service."}
{"text":"Get your fill at W Burger Bar! 

For 6.99 you can get your basic beef burger. But basic is not basic at the W. You get to choose from an enormous roster of toppings and  condiments that normally you would have to pay for! The only extras are the cheesy, the eggy and the meaty. 

The night started a bit rocky as we were first seated at someone else's reserved table. Instead they moved us to the table directly beside, which is weird. They was no difference between the tables, beside about a foot. 

I got the beef with a whole wheat bun topped with mixed greens, alfalfa sprouts, tomato, beets, sauteed onions, and chipotle mayo. I'm a burger mixologist; it was great. How about toasting the buns though? Just a little bit so the whole burger is warm to pick up. Other than that, everything tasted fresh and I loved the addition of cooked beets on the cheap. 

We also order the 50/50 fries, half sweet potato and have regular. The first basket we got was decent, not the warmest. Since condiments are free with the burger, I highly recommend ordering them for dipping the fries as well. Who needs Heinz ketchup when you have chipotle mayo and tzatziki? Quickly received, our second bowl of 50/50 was WAY better. It came fresh from the frier, perfectly crispy and delicious. 

It was my second visit here. Clearly, second time's a charm!"}
{"text":"I bought a Groupon for this place. Total scam. The groupon was $10.99 for 2 Burgers. However, the groupon does not include toppings (learn this when the receipt comes to you). Each burger goes for 6.99 to begin with... so you can do the math. At most you'll save a dollar. Total scam. 

In terms of quality of food: this pales in comparison to Burger Priest and The Works Gourmet Burger. It is also cheaper at The Works. 

There is also no real Air Conditioning at the place. Expect to be sweating while eating."}
{"text":"Late night burger joint. Lots of toppings to choose from. Noisy, local hangout for young people. I have had both the veggie and beef burger. The beef burger was decent but the veggie burger was phenomenal. Fries are done well. Staff are friendly and efficient. Worth a try."}
{"text":"I had an amazing celebration last night at W. The staff were incredible! So accommodating, organized and made the night a breeze. The burgers were on point and how could I forget the endless supply of shots all under $5. Thanks W"}
{"text":"After a great day of relaxing in the morning, going to see the UFC weigh ins, and watching Fast 5, I wanted to end my night by hunting down a good burger.  The idea was great but we were SOL trying to find a good burger place as we ended up finding W Burger Bar as the only place that was still open.

We walked in an hour before closing and asked the bar tender if the kitchen was open.  The assured us that it was and there was a lot of time.  My brother and I grabbed a seat at the bar so that we could watch the hockey game but more importantly just grab a bite then leave. 

We both ordered a burger on white with a side of fries.  Our toppings were slightly different but not a difficult order at all.

The meal got there pretty quickly and I had a few fries to start.  The fries were pretty terrible.  They were a little mushy but that wasn't the worst part.  The fries were so salty they made McDonald's saltiest fries taste bland!

I had a bite into my burger and realized 2 things.  The burger was cooked really really really well done and the bun was whole wheat.  I was not sure where the bartender had taken off to but after a few minutes decided to take another bite and just didn't want to wait around to get a different bun.

My brother had the same experience with his meal but his meal might have been a little more...really really really well done.  The burger was charred on the outside and he actually peeled some of that off the burger.

I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Obviously a classic, so if you're reading this review you must be a tourist.  The hype is legit, go for it."}

Definitely a close fav to come too!!"}

I had bison burger with blue cheese and sautéed onion; it was a quite flavourful experience, and I would love to try one some other things on the menu!"}

{"text":"Burgerlicious.
So delicious.
T, to the A, to the S-T-E-Y, burger, you tasty
To the D, to the E, to the L-I-C-I-O-U-S
Check-check-check it out!

We came here after work for a quick bite and beer.
Simple decor, modern, with overly-loud televisions.

The burger was juicy but not the most flavorful.
I like the option for whole wheat buns.
They have a lot of toppings for you to choose from. The wasabi cucumber topping was yummy.
However, I actually felt lazy and I wish I didn't have to choose my own toppings.   I like places that have recommended toppings.  Not just one recommendation for each burger type.
The onion rings are awesome and ginormous.

Our waitress was slow and pretty forgetful.
She forgot the sauteed onions.
She also forgot the grilled red peppers.
She also forgot that we wanted to pay.
That's ok, I'll forget to give her a good tip.

Aside from the bad service, the burger was good, and I will come back and try other things... like that $18 Kobe beef burger."}
{"text":"\"The first and the last!!!\" If I could give it no stars I would.

It was our first time ordering from W burger bar through foodora.  I was quite excited to try this place but unfortunately to our dismay I was dissapointed at their customer service.  Our office had a big order in for all our doctors for lunch and one of our orders never even arrived.  I called to complain about the mishap and I was met with the worst customer service from their manager.  They did not even owe up to their mistake and instead blamed foodora for it which is complete bs.  They packed the bags for each order and then they're telling me its the delivery guys fault?  Never will W Burger bar ever get our business ever again."}
{"text":"If you want cheap shots, good food, and a good time this is the place to go to! 
They serve $2 and $3 shots... So don't mind if I do! I often come here for birthday events or just casual nights after work or so. 

I also came here for my 20th birthday (2012), the manager on duty that night was Paul and he was so accommodating. My friends were running late as per usual and I actually had two extra bodies than what I had initially reserved for. But even after 30min past our reservation time he still gave me the table and extra chairs. Saved me big time! 
Definitely try their sweet potato fries and poutine, simple but yummy! Portion sizes are worth the price you're paying for. Overall the food and drinks are inexpensive. 

The only downside to this restaurant is the space. It's pretty small and can easily get packed. So make sure to make reservations!"}
{"text":"When it says burger in the name, they better be good. And these are indeed very good. I had mine with bacon, cheddar, mayo, and a fried egg. Yum.

The fries are even better, some of the best I've had. I suggest getting half regular, half sweet potato fries.

The milkshake was subpar, though. Too thick/ice-creamy.

It was loud in there, but I'm not sure that can be helped.

{"text":"Gourmet burgers as a popular food trend is nothing we in Toronto haven't experienced before. What perhaps has changed is the quality and options you can now enjoy in some of these new burger joints. While some establishments like ACME Burger are merely one notch above their fast food mega-chain rivals, some new burger restaurants like W Burger Bar exalt the hamburger to a level that once bitten into will spoil you against anything lesser.

Walking into W Burger Bar you'll notice how pleasantly crisp white the interior looks. Certainly this is one of the more pleasant gourmet burger restaurants you'll ever sit in. It's not a very big place, just perfect for lunch which I believe makes up a good portion of W Burger Bar's business. Moments after entering the establishment I was pleasantly greeted not only by a server but what appeared to be the manager as well. The first impression I got from the staff was \"Welcome, we're pleased to have you here.\" This despite the fact the place was full up and humming with a lunch crowd. Already I'm impressed.

The menu consists of not only beef burgers but lamb, bison, salmon, chicken, veggie and more. Note that the beef is both hormone and anti-biotic free and comes from the local Rowe Farms! Available toppings are too numerous to mention here but let's just say you're burger is pretty well covered. Sides include the mandatory french fries both in regular potato and sweet potato variety. If by chance you went to W Burger Bar to eat something other than a burger (you big silly) there are other comfort foods like chili, mac 'n cheese, grilled cheese sandwiches as well as soups and salads.

I decided to order a simple beef burger with a 50/50 side of sweet and regular potato fries. For toppings I went with a mix of what appealed to me, top on the list was sauteed onions (the only way onions should be done for a burger). For a beverage I discovered a special on bottled Steam Whistle at $2.99 and so \"Una cerveza, por favor.\" You can also get Pabst Blue Ribbon by the pitcher for some ridiculously cheap price here as well. The burger I ordered medium as I was told that was the bloodiest I could get it. I also opted for the whole wheat bun, cause that's how I roll.

Soon after ordering I was given a gratis snack plate of carrot and celery sticks with dip, nice! The food I ordered arrived in the exact time I'd expect it to take to prepare, I looked at the burger and it was huge! Meaning I could actually see the meat and toppings as oppose to just a giant bun with something hidden inside it. The burger was delicious, I gobbled it down. The fries were also good though I felt could have been a little more on the crisper side. All in all I was stuffed and quite satisfied. Gourmet burger, fries and a beer and the total with tip came out to somewhere around $15. 

On my way out I was thanked again by the manager for my patronage and the waitress who served me dashed to offer me a free brownie sample before I headed out the door. All I can say in closing is the \"W\" in W burger Bar probably stands for \"Wow.\"  I recommend."}
{"text":"I work so close, but this \"just before the East-side\" strip has been neglected. I was shopping at Winners and decided on a burger with a friend after striking out entirely across the street. Thursday drink specials are martini's- $7. Walking in, this place was packed! The number of Yelp reviews speak to the popularity. We were seated right away, though. 
Sean, the owner/manager, upon questioning, said the Bramble was his favorite martini.  So, I ordered the bramble- Gin, campari, lemon and sugar and it was strong! 
I had 3 options as a vegaquarium: Salmon, portobello, and veggie pattie. The Pattie was made with some of everything- a lot of grain, but I find at places where I like a lot of toppings, the mushroom burger just doesn't absorb the toppings like a grain burger. 

Recipe for Kat's Southwestern Veggie burger: 
Chipotle Ketchup (WOW!), cilantro yogurt, jalapeno's, monterrey jack cheese, lettuce, +/- avocado. 

Biggest gripe: I had to ask for more chipotle ketchup. 
But, when it came, I dipped in. 

$25 all in. No Sides"}
{"text":"So maybe trip to A&W has got me in a burger state of mind... The burgers here are good, lots of toppings to chose from, ranging from the expected to the un. Good fries, good onions rings and nice that you can order thins separately. 

The showstopper, though, are the spiked milkshakes. Ever order a chocolate shake and wonder how much better it would be if it were boozy? W Burger's on that! The hard parts are deciding what kind to order (there are a few sweet options...) and whether to order with your meal or as dessert.

It's a good spot for groups dinners or a smaller crowd or after work drinks/snacks."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a couple of times now and I definitely like the ambiance and the staff.

I usually come for lunch for a quick bite and I had burgers both times I came.

Once with fries on the side, once with salad and a friend of mine ordered burgers too.

Since it is named W Burger I thought for a moment that was related to the W hotels but it is not.

The burgers are very delicious and tasty and the service it is surprisingly attentive for a downtown burger joint.

You can sit in the front area, the bar and they have little private rooms for parties or for when it gets too busy.

I recommend this place if you are coming in for a quick bite and you want something good, but also for work related lunches.

For who like me loves sports, they have plenty of TV screens playing games and you would definitely be entertained."}
{"text":"A friend of mine celebrated her birthday here. The location is really convenient since it's just outside of College station. We were sitted in their newly built 'party' room, which was decent since the regular dining area was really loud. For a group of approx. 15...I personally think the table arrangement was pretty awkward (but that might just be me). Our group took up half the room...but if it was to be a completely filled room, it wouldn't be so great if people on opposite ends wanted to converse amongst each other. The place was really hot as well, which isn't fun when you're drinking. The window was opened, but it would've been nice if there was AC instead.

Now for the food. I'm not a burger person, more of a wings type of girl. So, I ordered the wings. They were okay....obviously I figured they wouldn't turn out amazing considering it's a burger place. On the menu it says you get a pound of wings for 11.99 (without sides)...but I feel like I got less than a pound. I've eaten at Wild Wings, St. Louis, and a few other places that have wings so I know what a pound of wings would generally look like. It's pretty sad too that you have to pay extra for sides...

From what my friends mentioned about their burgers and fries/poutine, it is amazing. I also shared the 50/50 sweet potato fries & regular fries with one of my friends and her friend and they were pretty good. Plus they provided dipping sauce for the sweet potato fries - one regular and one spicy (which I loved!). 

Shots were really cheap!!!! They were about $2.50-$8 depending on what you wanted. But the $2.50 shots were already good and enough for the birthday girl to go ham and get wasted over lol. They also have fishbowl drinks and spiked shakes.

Lastly, washrooms are pretty sketchy since you have to walk to the basement. My friend (birthday girl) said she almost got run over by a human bowling ball? Didn't see what that was about, but she sounded pretty weirded out and shocked about that lol."}
{"text":"Been here a few times. Service is great. And atmosphere is great especially for a Friday afternoon after a long week and you just need a spiked milkshake to make it all better!! Plus I hear $4 shots but I never tried it, so I won't comment on that except that's what I was told! 

First time I went I got the mushroom burger... Amazing! Two grilled mushroom caps on a bun... Yummy!

Second time, lamb burger with cilantro yogurt, mint sauce, goat cheese and arugula...Yummmm!

3rd time I wanted something light, so I tired the salmon burger in lettuce. I forget what toppings I got! Ok... The salmon burger was a salmon steak... Looked baked not grilled and had some kind of crust on it. It was bland and cold and I could've done it myself at home. Which sucked cause I really wanted   An actual salmon burger and I could do it myself at home too but it's so much work!  Oh well at least I had my milkshake to wash it done! 

 Will stick to my lamb burgers!"}
{"text":"W Burger Bar does a few things, and for the most part, it does them well.

The burgers themselves seem to be a mixed bag (although I base this on an admittedly limited sample size).  My girlfriend and I came here using a Groupon ($10.99 for any two burgers, excepting the aggressively-priced $18.99 Kobe burger).  She opted for a Portobello mushroom burger, and I the Bison burger.

The Bison burger was quite dry, and came with an extra lump of severely browned meat adhered on top that, unbidden, invoked the image of a beef nipple.  Suffice to say, it remained unfinished.  The Portobello mushroom burger, by contrast, was streets ahead.  Tender and juicy, with a pleasant umami flavour, and no resemblance to a nipple, it was everything a burger made of fungus should be, and more.

The drinks at W Burger Bar may be the most noteworthy aspect of the establishment (they may want to think about rebranding themselves simply as \"W Bar\", such that future patrons may be spared any unwanted nipple experiences).  Pints of PBR are $4.50, and all other draft pints are $6.  Pitchers of PBR seem to permanently priced at $9.99, remarkable for a pitcher of beer in downtown Toronto.  Shots are also offered for a paltry $2, and martinis are $6.99 on Thursdays.  Forget the burgers, come here to get blasted!

The service is friendly and attentive, and the facilities are sleek and hip-looking.  The walls are festooned with high-mounted flat-screen TVs, so you can convincingly pretend to be absorbed in philosophical contemplation while actually watching football.  Primary patronage seems to be well-dressed 20/30-somethings and people on dates.  They boast a patio looking onto College St., so in the summer you can inhale fresh exhaust and get leered at by hobos while enjoying grilled nipples.

All-in-all, W Burger Bar is a good restaurant that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend.  Just don't order the nipple burger."}
{"text":"Where to go, where to go...  Lets check out that burger place on Caledonia...  Sure why not.  Get in car go over to an empty lot.  Are they open?  well we checked the door and went in.  Nice place red banquettes, grey walls and large blow-ups of old movie stills.  900 giant TVs, well not 900 but you get my point. I really do not get the whole testosterone-jock-o-TV-overload thing, but anyway... I had a Beef burger, poutine and onion rings, my companion had a beef burger and fries. Burger was a lil on the dry side but my main complaint is that W Burger Bar engages in a common bar practice....  Over Salting. In fact all I could taste after was salt and not being a drinker it was not to their benefit anyway.  Anyone with high blood pressure or any other heart issues should avoid this sodium saloon for sure.."}
{"text":"After reading the menu on line with words like Amazing etc., also an acquaintance recommended that I try the Bison burger.  This was quite a disappointment.  First of all the place was dirty. Seems like the floors were not moped for awhile. The fries were cold and limp, the bison burger was over cooked and tasteless, the basic organic burger was the same.  The turkey burger had some flavour and less dried out.    The server was very friendly."}
{"text":"Fist impression was not the greatest - 5 waitresses, plus a hostess, and a chef hanging out around the podium at the front of the restaurant.  Granted, the restaurant was not very busy, but there must be other things they could all be doing.  

We were seated promptly, by a waitress that seemed very friendly and helpful.  That would be the only good point throughout the night - her helpfulness, and smile.  We looked over the menu, and were a bit surprised by the prices.  Most of the burgers were $10 or so, and didn't come with any sides.  I settled on a Bison burger, grilled, with red onion, roasted red peppers, lettuce, horseradish mayo, and barbecue sauce.  My girlfriend chose a regular beef burger with lettuce, tomato, cucumber wasabi mayo, and ketchup.  We also got a large order of fries to split, with gravy.

We received a plate of celery and carrot \"sticks\", as a starter.  It's one of the first impressions you have of a place, and when we were served 3 small pieces of celery and a few of what seemed to be carrot SHAVINGS, I was not impressed.  It just looked sad. 

Our burgers arrived within about 10 minutes, along with our fries and gravy.  First surprise, was how small the \"large\" order of fries was.  I am all for portion control, but this was barely enough for the two of us.  They were also quite heavily salted, and because they were served in a deep, small bowl they were clumped together and soggy.

Now, I had ordered my burger medium well (they refused to do it medium rare, which already had me confused - wasn't this supposed to be a higher end burger joint?), because nothing is worse than a well done, dried out burger.  

After two bites, I couldn't eat any more of mine - it was cooked to that horrible grey colour, all the way through, and was too dry to consume.   So I flagged down the hostess, and explained the situation.  She didn't seem at all surprised, and agreed to get me a new burger, this time done on the flat top grill (as I had hoped this would assure more \"juiciness\").  

While I was waiting for my burger to be re-served, my girlfriend commented on the issues with her burger. It too was fairly dry, and her \"wasabi\" mayo just tasted like mayo - zero kick to it at all.  Our waitress came back over, and offered me any item on the menu free, as apology for the mistake with the burger.  I wasn't expecting that sort of compensation for something I considered a minor mistake, but gladly accepted it.  I asked for the chicken fingers, and she smiled and went to get them.  To me though, it was a sign that they had issues like this frequently, to be comping things for customers without hesitation.  Sadly, the chicken fingers weren't much of an apology - they were bland, very small, greasy, and overcooked as well.  

My burger showed up soon after, oddly with a whole wheat bun when I had originally ordered white.  But I was too frustrated at that point to bother pointing that out.  I immediately was greeted with wonderfully pink meat, in my first bite.  And the flat top had definitely brought more moisture to the burger.  But halfway through the burger, it was apparent that it was nearly as overdone as the first one.  It was dry, and mealy and I just couldn't finish it.  On top of the burger being overcooked, both the barbecue sauce and horseradish mayo were bland and flavourless.  It was just sad.  

My girlfriend still wanted dessert, while I was done with the place.  She ordered apple pie a la mode, which appeared before us quickly, in the hands of a VERY apologetic waitress.  You see, the pie was a mess on the plate.  It wasn't in the shape of a slice of pie, because as the waitress explained, they take it from the freezer and heat it up (microwave it seemed), which causes the pie to just fall apart as the ice melts.  My girlfriend hesitantly accepted the slice, only to stop after one bite.  Why?  The pie dough was either raw, or had become mush from the freezing/microwaving procedure.  Fed up, we asked for the bill.  

I would like to take this opportunity to say that our waitress was great.  She was prompt, apologetic, friendly, and never lost her smile.  She was really helpful, and we left her a tip.

With the sheer amount of \"gourmet\" burger restaurants opening up all over Toronto, I do not think there is ANY excuse for W Burger Bar to be offering up such little quality, for so much money.  If they don't get their act together, I doubt they will be there much longer."}
{"text":"Burger Bar appears to be a happening joint - I've been twice now, and it's been packed both times. Right at Yonge and College, so it attracts business types on lunch I suppose. It's a modern, shiny, semi-gourmet take on the better-than-a-fastfood-burger. Attention - it's capital-L Loud in here! Lots of people chatting, plus music, plus the bustle of the kitchen - I found myself raising my voice almost to a yell just to converse over a small table for two.

Other reviewers have said this before, and I'll echo it - the onion rings are fabulous. Fantastic. Lovely. Perhaps in a two-man breakaway from all comers along with the quinoa-battered rings at Fresh, I'd eat a meal's worth of them alone. Avoid the sweet potato fries, though - stringy, salty and anemic.

But what of the burgers? I've had the Kobe (very expensive and not exactly living up to the godlike beef experience the menu hypes it up to be, though if you come on Wednesdays they knock the price down by half for a special so how could I refuse the upgrade?) and the  bison burger (surprisingly juicy/tasty given the leaner meat.) 

They cook the burgers thick here, and usually on the wellish side of medium so be warned if you like your burger rare. The buns leave something to be desired - they're soft and fragile and kind of bland. I'm not sure about the seasoning on the patties either - a bit salty for my taste. 

There are many available condiments (some old standards, some quite exotic) available to customize your burger to your liking. Despite this, even when ordered with an assortment of condiments that I thought I liked the sound of, the burgers seemed to come pretty plainly dressed. Having said that, the chipotle ketchup is certainly recommended if you're looking for something new or unusual to put on your bun. As we're talking about condiments, it reminds me - I've had the servers forget bits of what I'd ordered on my burgers both times that I've been here. Not cool, guys. 

As far as their grill goes, W Burger left a decent impression on this carnivore, but the restaurant seems to otherwise be trying to dress up middling pub fare and lots of drink offerings in a trendy suit. I like a burger to be satisfying and hefty and focused not just on the meat but also the \"works,\" and W left me wanting in that latter regard (especially given the price, which is on the high side for a quick burger, fry and beer.)

Also, a note for the vegetarians: my girlfriend asserts that this place has the best veggie patty she's ever tried. I had a bite - it's certifiably good and not your average \"meh\" meat replacement!"}
{"text":"We ordered from W Burger Bar using Foodora on a weekday afternoon lunch, probably around 2pm. We each ordered a burger and a side, one combo and one without. I liked how you're able to customize exactly what you want in your burger, down to the toppings and condiments. There's decent variety in terms of options for toppings and meats and condiments. I would recommend the Chipotle Mayo for your burger, as a dip for your fries/onion rings, anything. That mayo was amazing!! They should bottle that stuff and sell it. 

Right off the bat, I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't a combo option available with a vegetarian burger. I'm not sure if this is a flaw of Foodora's menu of W Burger Bar or of the restaurant itself. Either way, I ended up ordering a burger and a side individually instead of a combo. 

In terms of portion sizes, the burger was on the smaller side, imagine a burger the size of a typical grocery store hamburger bun. The sides were large though, with plenty of fries/rings to last the duration of the meal. Since everything was a bit on the mediocre side, I don't think I'd revisit, especially since there are so many other burger places in Toronto."}
{"text":"Went here with a group of friends. We've been before, it wasn't anything special but  it was fine. We went on Friday night, we were waiting at our table for over a half hour, no one came to take our order, but a waitress clearly saw us. The washrooms were also appalling; dirty, no toilet paper, and obvious signs that people had had sex in one of the stalls. After this and the long wait we decided to leave. I will not be returning and now this place will forever be referred to my friends and I as \"The Burger Barn\"."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast and really enjoyed their fresh breakfast. I also do like to have less choices and it was pleasing to look at their minimalist menu. The quality was good but the price was great for the portion."}
{"text":"I like the sweet yam fries and the ambience is good here. Very sporty and clean with TVs all around. And most of the waitress are pretty good to look at with their slim black outfits. 


The burgers have always be pretty good but not sensational. I've tried the Bison, beef, and chicken I think. Been here several times, always a consistent experience."}
{"text":"Quick efficient friendly staff..Tight quarters but worth it ...the food was outstanding and not overpriced.. Kayla was our server today and was excellent, quick and attentive. I had Quebecois poutine, my son had chicken strips and fries and my boyfriend had their breakfast burger..peameal bacon, 2eggs, tomatoe with mayo..with a pint he loved it  they dont call it burger bar for nothing. Oh almost forgot deep fried pickles were great."}
{"text":"The concept of W Burger Bar is pretty neat - you pick your meat: beef, lamb, salmon, tofu, you name it... then you can select from a large list of additional toppings, most of which are free (other than bacon and cheese). Sounds fun!

I chose the lamb burger with sweet potato fries. The waiter took my order using an iPhone app, which sounds great on paper. However, it actually meant a long time spent at our table scrolling through lists of toppings while we waited to give him the next item. When our food came, after a long delay, the burgers didn't resemble our order. They probably used the Burger Genius app to predict what actually wanted (I thought I wanted cheese... but what do I know?)... isn't technology wonderful.

When we finally got the right food, it was actually pretty good. It is nice to be able to pick from some not so common toppings. I don't eat burgers that often, but I'm sure there is another pub that can make a burger just a good without the headache. Come to think of it, C'est What's lamb burger is pretty good. Why don't you go there instead."}
{"text":"This could be a great establishment, unfortunately service leaves much to desire.

I've been to the establishment a few times for food and drinks. The food is great bar food that I would recommend. Prices are great with awesome deals.

Where this place lacks is the service, the dining room is severely understaffed and waiting over 15 minutes to put in an order, 20 minutes for a drink and another 20 minutes to ask a menu to make another order is quite frankly ridiculous.

I hope there is change to this establishment because without, I cannot see myself recommending or returning."}
{"text":"Strengths are the variety of free toppings you can pick with a bunch of different sauces. Ordered the portobello burger (I know... veggie option at a burger joint) and the taste was a solid 7/10, but the bun was soaked through two minutes after it arrived. 

Good portion of semi-skinny fries and quick service. 

Lunch combo - burger, drink, fries - with 15% auto-grat on party of 8+ came out to ~$16, which is comparable to other downtown spots."}
{"text":"Excellent burgers and fries in a comfortable environment with pleasant table service make W Burger Bar one of my new favorites.  Prices are comparable to order-at-the-counter gourmet burger places in Toronto.  The selection of toppings is unsurpassed.  Fries (regular and sweet potato) were hot and crispy.  The menu was quite extensive and went beyond burgers and fries, though all of us had burgers.  Only problem was that the music was way too loud.  At our table of four, we had to shout at each other and had trouble communicating with our server."}
{"text":"Mmmmm poutine!
The fries were delicious, and the light brown gravy tasted great!  There were curds on it, which were tasty, however not really squeaky.  And really...there could have been more of them.  This poutine sort of fell into the dangerous nacho category - you know where you have a stack of chips, and only the top ones have cheese on them? I hate that!
Anyway, also had a beef slider, which was totally delicious and very cute.  I definitely want to come back here for a full-sized burger and some beers.  Yes, they have beers!  How awesome is that?!  And the decor is really great too...its a great spot to have a tasty meal."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after passing by many times. Had the beef burger and a small side of poutine and they both just tasted okay. The burger tasted very dry and tasteless. The poutine tasted very salty. Really nothing special about both of them. The only good part is the cheap beer and thats it nothing else. If i want a gourmet burger ill go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Burgers here are amazing and they even have vegan options! I love the build it yourself style with tons of different options. The fries are always perfect and food comes out fast! Staff is always nice and friendly"}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 3.5 rating from my order of a beef burger with a side of sweet potato fries. I bumped it to a 4 because of the complimentary carrot and celery sticks that they offer at the beginning of the meal. It adds a nice touch!

The beef patty was quite large, though a little dry in the center but was well complemented by the assortment of available toppings. I especially liked that they offered sautéed onions and alfalfa sprouts as options :)

The fries were stringy and chewy - the type you could nibble away on without feeling full until it finally hits you. I personally enjoyed them more than the typical starchy thick-cut fries. 

Service was friendly but a bit slow and the restaurant was emptier than expected for a Saturday evening. I wouldn't mind coming back for the lunch specials, which appeared to have some good deals."}
{"text":"100% fatisfied. had the bison burger with bacon , egg, avocado, swiss cheese. small poutine and a coke. burger was excellent exactly what I was craving for. spend $30 . I bit over price I think.

hosted pretty and welcoming, lots of parking clean great atmosphere. 

will probably come back again.

recommended 100%"}
{"text":"Came to this place just for the Kobe beef burger, very dissappointed about the beef. The beef was cooked to SUPER WELL DONE SUPER DRY SUPER BLAND, completely lost all the fat juice and tenderness from the japanese beef (I had wagyu many times before I'd say this beef is nothing like a wagyu steak)
Apart from the beef, everything was great. The cranberry topping definitely saved this burger, little sweetness elevated the flavour in the burger. Garlic herbs mayo was on point, lettuce was crispy and fresh, bun was soft and not soggy.
Would come back again, but just order the normal beef burger for less than half of the kobe burger's price ($20+)"}
{"text":"Just graduated from Ryerson University that is right around the corner from Burger Bar. Also used them as the go to catering company for the last company I worked with. Have eaten here over 20 times. 

This place is great for many reasons. Food, owners and drinks. 

The topping list for burgers is endless and the prices are decent. The Kobe burger is out of this world and the same with the bison. I would recommend this burger place to anyone looking for a solid burger and fries combo (sweet potato fries are awesome also) and cheap drinks. Many nights with 2 dollar shots and great priced beer."}
{"text":"Definitely a weird setup for this gastropub/ burger bar. The tables are insanely crowded, and the bar is so close to the entrance that you feel \"squeezed in\" as soon as you walk through the door. We were headed to the old Garden for a college hockey game, and so rather than feel so tight there we decided to grab three poutines (to go) and take them to the rink.

The poutines hit the spot. The little cardboard container hid just how much even the small poutine contained, and it was enough. The fries were thin and a bit mushy, and there was sufficient cheese such that every bite represented the trilogy: cheese, gravy and fries. Nothing particularly stood out in terms of cheese, fries or gravy, but it was legit.

I'll have to go back and try the burgers next time. I just wish they had a better layout (perhaps a bit less crowded)."}
{"text":"Been here a few times because a friend really likes it, plus it's located close to home so it's an easy choice.

Like:  Variety.  This is like a fast-food joint where you pick your burger patty and toppings, only more upscale and classy.  Prices are actually really reasonable, especially for downtown Toronto, which is appreciated.  Service is consistently good.

Dislike:  Food is generally just OK - not bad, but nothing to rave about.  Portions are good, I just don't find the taste to be overwhelmingly amazing.

Overall, I'd come here again because of it's location and that is really isn't a bad place to eat.  It just really isn't an out-of-this-world one either."}
{"text":"I have had my share of not-so-great experiences here (including a raw salmon burger!) but I keep coming back because I really enjoy this place.

I don't like spending too much on lunch, so I almost always come on a Friday afternoon for their vegetarian lunch special (veggie burger, fries/soup and a soft drink for $10). Carrots and celery with dip is provided on every table every day of the week as well.

Their veggie burger is freshly made with oatmeal and soy, but usually does not stay together very well. I eat it with a knife and fork most of the time. I almost always get it with sauteed onions, jalapenos, salsa and tzatziki, and I usually choose the soup and a Diet Coke. I actually wish their portabella burger was used in a special because I prefer it to the normal veggie burger.

It is never too busy on vegetarian special day so I don't find it too loud, but during the evenings carrying a conversation is a complete write-off.

Overall the service is friendly and professional.

I like W Burger Bar if I'm by myself during lunch. It's a good place to watch sports or read a book, as long as it's not too busy."}
{"text":"I went here on Saturday February 13, 2016 with my hubby. On two occasions he found hair in his food, once in his burger than in our poutine. We both ordered the pure burger and the beef pattie was poor quality. Hubby had his burger replaced, with the wrong toppings. I got diarrhea the next day. Not sure what happened that night but I've tasted better from this spot! Waitress was accommodating."}
{"text":"good atmosphere & great food, they accept u.s. currency. outdoor patio. seat you with some carrots and celery and ranch dressing pretty cool, prices are fantastic. Emily was very knowledgeable, she suggested the panko onion rings with garlic herb mayonnaise and 1/2 ketchup, it was awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for a long time. Really well priced food for the location, lots of variety of burgers, attractive wait-staff. I also think they give out free burgers if you sign up for their email list or if its your birthday. Really smart business decision if you ask me.

Only con is that the place is all kind of squished together. Not that bad tho."}
{"text":"Yummy Messy Burgers! 

Came here for lunch, got the basic \"Beef\" Burger medium done ($6.99 + $1.25 for the cheese), with assorted greens, sauteed onions and tomato, with cranberries, chipotle ketchup and herb and garlic mayo. 
I enjoyed it thoroughly and thought it to be better than a burger you could get at a pub or a place like Jack Astors. 
It is on the pricey side though but I was expecting prices to be higher and I say it's worth it. Got a root beer float to go with it and a side order of delicious sweet potato fries! 
The root beer float did not seem to have enough ice cream when it came to me, but magically it turned out to be the exact right proportion I needed to last the drink. 

I'm definitely going to try it out again, I wish I could try the $19 Kobe burger out of curiosity, but the beef burger serves its purporse very well that there is no way I can legitimize spending $20+ on a burger. 

The bison/turkey burger for a dollar or 2 more might be something I decide to try on my next go at it. They did have a \"Portobello\" burger and from what I gather, that's a mushroom between buns, I'm probably not going to order it, but if one day you happen to sit next to me, order it so I can see what it's like!

Service was friendly too! Couldn't really find much to complain about here. I also approve of their fancy toilet amenities such as the sink tap that allows the water to flow out instead of shooting down at you. (The smallest things do grab my attention!) :)"}
{"text":"Sadly, our weekend in Toronto was coming to a close and we needed a good place to eat near the Toronto Coach Terminal before our long ride back to New York. The area around the Toronto Coach Terminal has your standard offering of fast food joints and all that good stuff, but I wanted something nicer (dressed up fast food, perhaps?), so W Burger Bar was an excellent choice.

The menu here offers an impressive variety of burgers with lots of delicious (complimentary) sauces and toppings to go on the side or on top. I ordered the standard burger, which was great and came with a wonderful chipotle ketchup and herbed mayonnaise (for my fries). On the side, I ordered a 50/50, which consists of half sweet potato fries and half regular fries. Everything was fresh and once again, huge portions. They have a nice offering of beers on draft and some cocktails too, so this is great place for a relaxing meal. The prices are reasonable and the service was fast and friendly.

In having read various Yelp reviews, some noted that a reservation was in order, so I called ahead an made a reservation, but as it turned out, it was not necessary since the place was only about half-full when we arrived. The place itself is bright and modern with a sort of industrial vibe. There are big flat panel televisions here and there so we Americans could enjoy the novelty of others actually watching Curling. Really, who would have thought?"}
{"text":"Friday evening. 6pm. Dinner. 
With advice from Kat F. I made reservations and so glad that I did. I was a bit late, but they still held the table for us. There was a lineup with about 3 parties, and we walked right by like VIPs and got seated at our table. AWESOME. 
I guess this is the type of place that don't really need to allow reservations, but I'm very glad they did. 

However, the table was right in front of the kitchen kind of in the middle nowhere. I commented to my friend that this was awesome, but we got the crappiest seat in the house. My friend said, are you gunna yelp about it? I said probably. Then... maybe he heard me, maybe he didn't, but the manager (? guy with glasses) passed by and said \"you can see the kitchen? sorry about that. would you like free drinks?\"
I'm like... uhh. SURE!!! and i got a half pint of beer :) :)

Onion rings are superb. 

I took a long time to decide. My ultimate burger would be Bison + Egg + Pineapple + Mushroom + Cheese + avacado + Bacon ... but that's just heart attack waiting to happen. 
Had to be selective. 
Got a Bison ($9.95) + Chipotle Ketchup (free) + Monteray Jack Cheese ($1.25) + Portobello Mushroom ($2.50)

To be honest, it was good, but could have been better. The cheese was thin (i.e. melted, I can see thru it) and the ketchup was only in the middle of the sandwich so only tasted it with one bite.  The mushrooms were there, but didn't really add much to the burger. 
However, I will come back there one day and try this infamous frilled cheese with egg. 

We were a little hurried, to get our bill and sod off, but I could see why: there was at least another 5 parties waiting (and line up out the door). As we walked past them, I wanted to shout, You can CALL AHEAD!!"}
{"text":"I don't even like burgers, and I love this place. 

After living in the city for a few years, me and my spouse fell into a rut and decided to have a date day and just explore. I based it loosely on visiting the Allan Gardens, so I didn't know the area or where else to go. WBB was our final stop and the best part of the day. When we arrived, it wasn't very busy and we managed to snag a table on the teeny tiny patio, which I loved. We got to people watch and admire the ornate building across the street.

The service was lovely, the food was perfect...we both had the Bison Burgers. I decided that Blue Cheese would go well, but I didn't know what else to do with it. I left the rest of my order up to the suggestion of the waiter, and the burger was sublime.

Even when the place started filling up and we were on the end of our meal, I didn't feel as if anyone was breathing down my neck to finish and free up the table, even though we had a prime spot and had taken our time.

I can't wait to tell some foodies at work about this place."}
{"text":"I had just made the special, a burger and fries for 830 they also had burger, side and drink for 11 but I was planning on get a beer so I opted for first one.


It's a pick your own topping or go for a premade. Either way it was good burger I didn't ask but it seem like 6 oz.  I like good selection  of toppings. Only thing I wasn't a fan of was the fries but I came h3re for a good burger  and got it so that is excusable.

As well as specials for lunch  it does have its beer specials I ended up drinking two mini pitcher of Creemore  but they were 850 each so it was worth it.


Outside of the fries, the service  did bother me. First you seem lost when first coming  in, not sure if you should help yourself  to a table or wait.  I wasn't  really checked on too  often  and the gentleman seem  unprofessional, he was on his phone texting a few times and even took a seat at the bar. I'm sure they have a back area away from public  for that.

Not the image you should be portraying. Most of my issue are minor since the burger  was good and well priced. But organization  and staff service  and behaviour needs to be worked on. They get 3.5 from me but I'm not bumping  it up."}
{"text":"Service experienced was awful! The waitress was more interested in her phone than taking down my order- no surprise she got my order incorrect. 

Food is okay."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here after class because we had a buy one get one coupon. The location is great and so perfect for me. It's a few blocks from the Eatons centre. 

I got the regular burger along with onion rings. There are SO many different things you can put on your burger! It's so customizable! Sautéed onions, garlic mayonnaise, hot sauce, and of course they have all of the regular toppings. 

The menu was pretty cool! They had many options of sliders. There was burger sliders and I think chicken burger sliders and others. I will be probably trying this out next time I go! 

The inside of the restaurant is really nice. It's not too fancy, it's a perfect mix between classy but still casual. 

My burger was really good! The onion rings were very large - I ordered a side of onion rings and it comes with like 4 or 5 onion rings. They were different than normal onion rings, they had a different type of batter. It was really good!"}
{"text":"I went here a couple weeks ago, hoping W Burger Bar could redeem itself in my eyes. This time, I chose to dine in with some friends.

I loved their lemonade. It was the perfect combo of sour and sweet. My friends and I anxiously awaited our food. The weather was delicious and we sat near the open street window. We people watched and created their background stories until our food came...which went on for awhile because the food took awhile.

I ordered a regular beef burger and still had the same comments I had with my previous take out order. The beef was plain. There was no seasoning or flavour. My toppings also didn't have as much kick as I thought it would. I didn't taste the horseradish in the horseradish mayo and the chipotle ketchup tasted like regular ketchup to me. It wasn't a bad burger but I've definitely had better.

My friends and I also ordered foods we could share amongst ourselves. I got the side of macaroni and cheese. It was okay but eating it made me crave Harlem's mac and cheese and we didn't end up finishing it. My guy friends ordered the beef poutine and they said it was a waste.

The place was pretty empty when we went and it turned me off a bit that our waitress was just lounging on the bar, looking extremely bored. Most of the time we had to wave or call out to get her attention. Thoroughly annoying.

W Burger Bar is not a bad restaurant, but like the rating chosen, it's just okay. A lot of items lacked that extra punch to make it restaurant worthy food. The atmosphere with my friends was good, but I can have fun with my friends almost anywhere and have better food to go along with it."}
{"text":"They make the best Veggie Burger I've ever had. You can get it wrapped in cabbage leaves also. Fresh cut Sweet potato fries are good too. Lots of free toppings to choose from. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"This burger joint definitely gets an A for atmosphere and decor. The first thing I noticed was how lively the setting was. A little loud to converse but a nice place to hang and watch the game. Our server was fast and efficient, she got our orders and served it up with very little wait time. The TVs grabbed our attentions as the ball game kept us entertained. I was, however, quite disappointed with the food. Admittedly, the prices were reasonable and the choices were vast with so many ways of customizing your own burgers. The alcohol selection was also very extensive, ranging from tap to cocktail mixes. When it came to their specialty, I felt that the burgers fell short of what to be expected. The fries were less than stellar; both the regular thin cut and sweet potato fries were limp and a bit soggy - noticeably unevenly cooked. When it came to the burger, we ordered the bison burger and beef Burger. They came out looking great, the patties seemed to be at a nice thickness that would diminish some chance of overcooking. It was with the first bites that the flaws presented itself. The flaws were too major to ignore. Both patties had little to no seasoning, the only taste was lent from the sauces of choice...which, when you have a thick patty can leave an overwhelming bland taste of meat that off putting. I feel strongly that a well seasoned burger helps to keep the meat moist and juicy too. The burgers were both quite dry and overcooked. The bison burger especially was rubbery, dried and bland. With each chew, the meat just got tougher with what seemed like a lot of connective tissue. The beef burger was slightly better but not by much. I would return to this place for their alcohol selections and for the fun atmosphere but nothing about the burgers left a lasting impression. Check it out if there's nothing better you prefer or just want to hang with friends."}
{"text":"Extremely slow and inefficient service. We had a party of 6 and the server only attended 1 or 2 guests at a time
Flat soft drinks and under seasoned beef patty. But it is better than over seasoned patty for sure since other variety of condiments can off set it. 

It was much better when I did take out orders last time."}
{"text":"Visiting toronto for a few days, wanted to try some good food. Found the place through yelp. Decided to get a beef burger with all the toppings, including a deep fried egg. It was so delicious and had onion rings on the side which made it  a lot better. I would recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Convenient spot in a busy area for something quick, simple and cheap.

Came here after work for their afternoon delight special (3pm - 6pm). During these hours they have bar rails and a selection of dishes for $5. I got the sliders - you can maybe eat one in three or four bites, but you get two of them that come with chipotle mayo, sautéed onions, pickle, and a side of fries. Not bad at all for $5! My friends tried the fish tacos, potato skins, and deep fried pickles - all of which they enjoyed. We also all ended up getting the $2 beers which is a deal they have all day. Its 12oz of Pabst so as long as you're not picky about your beer then it's great.

The service was friendly and attentive, and the food/drinks all came out pretty fast. The place itself is simple and not fancy at all, but provides a good atmosphere for a get together with friends, quick lunch, or a few drinks."}
{"text":"I work in the area and have had lunch here many times.

Eat-in service is friendly, but often slow and inefficient. Cleanliness of table settings is hit and miss. 

Burgers and fries are passable. I'd go elsewhere for those if it wasn't for the convenience factor.

There are good healthy alternatives on the menu such as salads which can be upgraded with grilled chicken or fish. 

Decent overall, but not a top tier burger destination."}
{"text":"In town with the family for one night and found this place within walking distance from our Hotel.  It was a Sunday night, not very crowded but place looked nice.  Service was attentive, atmosphere was cool with classic rock on medium+ volume and a modern look.  We had our two boys, ordered the chicken fingers and they were overdone and pretty tasteless.  I had a burger on a wheat roll with their chipotle mustard.  Burger was done perfectly and the mustard was Very good...if you like it spicy go for this for sure!  My wife had a veggie burger and it was not that great.  It was very mushy and bland.  Beers were good, nice glassware.  Overall I would recommend, but seems like you should stick to what they are known for, the burgers."}
{"text":"This place is the most racist place ever.The Server Anthony just abused us because we were indians and treaty us badly .we justasked for tissues and this guy had the audacity to tell us that he is not sorry.The manager wasn't available to talk to and no one was giving his number. DO not go to this place"}
{"text":"With a group of 7 friends we went to the very back of the restaurant on a Friday night, and it was a good spot because we were facing LCDs with NCAA game either side of the table.

A friend of mine ordered 10 min ahead of us because she was vegetarian and knew what she wanted, fries.  She did not get her fries until  she requested it again when the rest of us were ready to order.

A friend that visits regularly instructed us to JUST get the burger, because it would be enough food but did we listen? NO!  I had the Bison Burger and felt somewhat obligated to get a side, Panko Onion Rings.  The Bison was ordered medium and it did come medium, and tasted okay.  Now I know why my friend ordered a Beef Burger.

It felt like forever before I stuffed down the burger and because I didn't want to let my friend brag about his ordering instructions, I mashed half the Onion Rings down but it wasn't fun doing so.  

W Burger Bar made me depressed because I couldn't believe I didn't FINISH a burger/rings combo!  I walked out looking behind me at the leftover Onion Rings as if I was leaving behind a girlfriend.  :-("}
{"text":"I wanted to love this, I really did. I have come here before and it was pretty good, so I thought a repeat was in order. 

First, I will start off by saying the place was very loud, and I mean very loud. I came here for my anniversary with my boyfriend, and I knew it wouldn't be romantic, but I still also didn't think it would be that loud.

I ordered a burger and small poutine. First, the fries were sooooo salty, thankfully I over dosed the fries with ketchup so it was fine. The burger was ok, nothing awesome. If it is called a Burger Bar, generally they should ensure they are serving great food. My boyfriend got chicken fingers, which were burnt.

The service overall was very slack! I was like 3/4 done my burger before they came and asked how it was, and the person who asked wasn't even our waitress. 

When I did ask for the bill, because there was 2 guys she asked if it was separate or together. I found this a tad insulting, had it been one male and one female I know they would not  have asked. That kind of irked me. 

The last time I was here, the food was so much better. I will say a positive they have for them is the fact they have fishbowls (just not many options). I am debating if I will return or not."}
{"text":"My boyfriend first introduced me to Burger Bar, a little under a year ago. Over this period of time, we have  visited the joint over a dozen times, so you can consider this a fair review, in the sense that it is absolutely not based on a  one time experience, but rather a collection of visits, ranging from good to bad.

I certainly will not add anything new to the plate. here by stating that the food there is of great value relative to its price point. Probably some of the best tasting Burgers I have ever had, hands down, however, i definitely will have to agree with most who have said that the service there is either hit or miss, as it does indeed seem as though the service tends to go down quite a few notches, as the place gets busier. We've been forgotten and underserved many  times.. but will return for the food... every time"}
{"text":"The selection of toppings for your burger is awesome sauce! There is a whole list of toppings and sauces you could choose from, heck you could ask for all of them (although I wouldn't recommend it)! 

I ordered the Bison burger, Greek fries and a Beef burger. The burger was cooked fine and I had a lot of toppings on my Bison burger which made it hard to distinguish exactly what I was eating, but it was good nonetheless. I've never had Bison before, but it's more 'meaty' and robust than Beef, the texture is a little bit more rough. I think I might prefer beef over Bison, but it was an interesting experience and I wouldn't mind ordering it again. The fries are cut thin and small, almost shaved. I found it a bit too salty for my liking, but the fries were nice and crisp and the gravy was nice and generous. 

The place is well kept and clean and the servers are friendly. The interior feels modern and reminded me sort of a hotel lobby sort of thing. The food is good, nothing special but not your average burger. A slightly above average burger. I wouldn't mind stopping by this place for a meal!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but I agree that if you want to have a full meal, you'll have to spend quite a bit of money. Ambiance is fine, but the tables are too close.
Price of drinks is good."}
{"text":"Absolute filth! I've been here 3x before and had alright experiences. This time I got take away and it was horrendous.  I had a lamb burger wings fries and asked for a side of ketchup and two tatziki sauce. No sauce or ketchup.  The burger was old rank mutton.  The wings were alright and fries were over cooked.  I can think of better ways to spend $35.  A shame this place has gone so downhill since I was in Toronto last."}
{"text":"Loved this burger place in the College Park area. Quite the lively and hip place during the weekend nights. I simply loved their $2 Blue Ribbon beers. The $2 beers sign outside their restaurant definitely catches your eye and draws people into the restaurant. I ordered the beef brisket burger with fries. Fries were good but a bit tad salty. I loved the burger and it's great that you can customize your burger with different toppings and sauces. I got the basic toppings for your burger along with the chipotle ketchup and garlic herb mayo which were pretty good sauces to put on. Beef brisket was nice, tender and juicy! $10.25 for the burger was a pretty fair price for the portion size. We also ordered a bunch of drinks including shots! They have $3-$4 shots here which is pretty cheap and I simply loved the name of their shots! Very flavourful and delicious. I have to say service is pretty slow here. I waited nearly 10 minutes before actually being served. The restaurant was busy but that is no excuse for the very laissez-fair. The burger prices here are fair and of course the drinks are moderately priced. I wouldn't mind coming back to try their lunch specials. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here. Definitely a nice place to get burgers and drinks! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"$10 pitchers and a variety of burgers. That's Burger Bar to me in a nutshell. 

Came here for a small get-together on a Saturday night. While the waiters had initially told us there was no way we would be getting a table for 8, they worked hard to make room for us and even chased us down College St. to bring us back. 

They have a variety of burgers, including a very expensive $19 Kobe burger. I opted for the rather cheap $6 original burger with a side of sweet potato fries. There wasn't really much of a wow factor to the burger, but it was quite good. The sweet potato fries were very good as well, although they had a touch too much salt. 

The decent burgers, along with the cheap beer resulted in quite a good night. I'd definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Came on a Friday afternoon for lunch.  Service was good and the burgers came quick.  I had the lamb burger with the fries and it was pretty good.  The portobello burger is awesome if you're vegetarian.  The fries were skinny and delicious.

Pricing is pretty on point with what you get, portions are perfect size, and the drinks are nice.  Those nice sized fishbowl drinks were well priced and tasted nice.

If you want a nice burger and drinks for a decent price, come here!"}
{"text":"I liked the place. Was taking 1/2 day tour after my meeting in Toronto on $10.75 full day metro pass and got off trolley here as entire neighborhood looked interesting.

W had wifi and was crowded for lunch around 1:15pm which was a good sign and was able to sit me in an area in back where I could stretch out. I ordered the turkey burger and side of greek salad. both were good, though a little pricey. very attentive service.

All in all very good and if back in Toronto anytime soon will stop back again."}
{"text":"I cant say i will go back to this place I was not in agreement with the size of hamburger that I got...If Im goin to pay that much I expect to at least be partially full.   Nice lil venu just when I want a hamburger I will not be back here even if someone offers to buy it for me..."}
{"text":"Its a good place to have a burger I can tell you that much. I wanted some new place to try so we made a trip here spontaneously and the food did not disappoint. They have a bar for alcohol (hence, the name W burger \"bar\") and they have tvs around thats on the sports channel all the time soooo... basically a mans cave for sure. lol 

Although it took awhile for our order to arrive, it was worth the wait for the meal for sure.. plus we weren't in a hurry so we didn't mind..just not sure if you ARE in a hurry and how long it would take them to make the food.

So, I ordered their Beef burger with lettuce, tomato and caramelized onions with ketchup and it was so good! I promise. Try it. And for my side, I wanted sweet potato fries..but the waitress heard me wrong so she got me the loaded potato skins which was like a baked potato with a bunch of sorted cheeses, bacon and a side of sour cream but I didn't mind it (so I didn't complain) bec I wanted something new anyway. Sure enough, it was filling by itself and also good too.

My partner got the lamb burger with lettuce, tomato with ketchup and mustard  and a side of sweet potato fries (which I ate and gave him my skins later on,
lol) and he absolutely liked the lamb burger a lot and would recommend it to anyone.

We are definitely coming back here in the future. It wasn't crowded when we came because it was a Sunday afternoon (and cold) so it was nice to be able to enjoy our meal in a moderate chill environment. Do try it!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. I had the burger and a Lynchburg lemonade. Everything was great.  Definitely a must visit when I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"The food is decent...tried the slider with beef, cranberries, relish and lettuce. I was excited that you choose toppings and that they have quite a list of toppings to choose from. The combination I had was really good and would try it on a bigger burger. I would go back and try just that. I was rather disappointed with the onion rings as they were big slices of onion and the coating was falling everywhere. The waitress that was at the bar was easy to talk to as she poured drinks and handled the other customers at the bar."}
{"text":"I guess you can say this is my local gourmet burger joint, being less than a block away from my place. I've been there 3 times and haven't been disappointed so far. I don't order anything fancy, just there regular beef burger and I pick from there list of free toppings. Last time I took my friends out there and one of them commented that the burger looked a little small but once she took a bite she realized there's a nice thick, juicy piece of meat in there. 

Since the first time I've gone there I've always ordered the potato skins and it's because of a little \"incident\" with them that was one of the reasons for giving 4 stars. Last time I went I ordered them as usual and the're usually before the meal as an appetizer. Well, this time the manager told us they had accidentally burned them so had to make another order, so they were served during the meal instead of before. Because of that they ended up comping us for the skins even though I would've been fine paying for them. If anything this showed me that here was an experienced manager, they made a mistake and they dealt with it in an appropriate manner. It was good customer service and I gotta give them kudos for that small gesture.

BTW, if you're vegetarian, don't come here. This is a burger joint, you gotta love meat. My sister ordered the vegetarian burger and although it was tasty the patty didn't hold together very well."}
{"text":"Tried the Kobe burger with extras for like $25. Not really any better than regular meat and I know what Kobe is supposed to taste like.

Cool vibe. Late night eates. Lots to like but the food is average at best."}
{"text":"If you can afford to spend a little more for a decent burger and happen to be in the downtown Yonge strip, W Burger Bar is a good bet. They offer a wide variety of different meats for the patty, but it will run you up an arm or leg if you choose something other than standard beef. Which I guess explains their notably cheap PBR on tap.

However they always have a $9.99 lunchtime special on every day of the week. Almost all of them involves a soda and fries combo, except for Wednesday, where yep, they still do the $9.99 Kobe beef burger. And it was pretty good and well-presented. Their list of toppings is so overwhelming that it discouraged me from wanting to have a burger \"with everything.\" Most of the good stuff costs extra, like cheese--at least goat and blue cheese is available. 

I find the staff generally friendly. It is not hard to imagine the house packed full on after-work hours or on a game night with patrons staring at the myriad of TVs, despite having plenty of tables. From my observation during wolfing my food though, take out orders seem to take longer. 

It's an alright place. I don't mind being back here again with some friends. But nothing beats trying one of their boozy milkshakes when it's like -20°C outside. Mmm mmm burrr it's good. Just don't freeze to death.

{TTC: College subway station. It's right across the street from College Park.}"}
{"text":"Love the cheap drinks everyday of the week! Creative shots between $2-$4 without having to purchase anything in order to get that deal. Burgers are amazing there, but I especially love their onion rings! Lamb burger in particular is my favourite so far with a variety of toppings that are complementary."}
{"text":"I don't know why I still bother with this place, other than it's sometimes the only burger joint that's open late through Foodora on Mondays. 
Of my most recent experience:
The bun and fries were extra soggy. I'd specified tomato on the burger. I did not get tomato on the burger. The Greek salad was 99.999% lettuce: a quarter of a tomato cut into 2 wedges, 2 thin slices of cucumber, 3 olives, about 5 minuscule pieces of diced onion, about 4 to 6 tiny pieces of diced pepper, an unbelievably light dusting of what must have been feta. I kid not; I could count how many pieces of each ingredient they used. It was a sad sad sad affair...$5.99 for a plate of lettuce. 
I'm not expecting them to bankrupt themselves by using all the olives and feta in the world for a salad. But, why skimp on the cucumber and onion? That stuff is cheap!
The thing is, this place is very haphazard. It appears that they just don't care and there's something wrong every time. For a customer who orders from here about once a month, it gets very frustrating. 
The food generally tastes good, the sizes of their burgers and fries are very generous, and the overall concept deserves to do better than this. If it weren't for their apathy and carelessness I'd be inclined to visit and/or order from here not just as a last resort.
At least the burger was wrapped is foil this time."}
{"text":"Hostess: Good evening. 
Me: Good evening. 
Hostess: Do you have a reservation? 
Me: A reservation? 
Hostess: Yes, a reservation. 
Me: You serve burgers here. I need a reservation to get a burger? 

WTF? This ain't the Rosewater Supper Club. This is the first time I've ever been asked if I had a reservation for a burger. Damn, this place better have some great meat for this much attitude. 

Ok, let's get this out in the open right off the bat. The W Burger Bar, all slick and tres mod is really just a jacked up burger version of Hooters a la beef. Now I see why all the previous guy reviewers like the wait staff. This is eye candy central here. 

It was a busy, noisy Friday night when the girls who love to eat the meat, Shari M. and myself met up with Kat D. to celebrate my Decemburger victory. So I figured since this was all about the burgers then I should be going for the Ferrari of burgers....the big Kahuna....the Kobe Burger. So much expectations on my part. Such a big let down. 

Our waitress, who appeared to be one Red Bull over the line, could do the speed dial routine on our order but seemed to take for ever to get a drink for anyone from the bar. When I first arrived I ordered the signature cocktail, The W. which is actually really refreshing and not cloying at all. (Vodka, Sloe Gin, Lime and sparkling grapefruit juice) I order....and 15 minutes later the waitress apologizes for not delivering yet because the bartender is totally swamped. The very same thing happens again to Shari...after a long wait for her libation it's the same old song from the waitress. Apologies and tells us the barkeep is super busy. Yet the table behind us sits down and the manager comes running over with a tray of shooters. Hmmmmm. 

I order the Kobe burger and keep it simple because I want to taste the meat. Caramelized onions, mustard, relish, pickles. I said it before and I'll say it again, don't eff up Momma's burger. They completely missed the onions. While taking our order I suggest to Shari that we share some fries and Shari suggests we share Poutine instead. I say ok, I'll go for that. The waitress, on auto pilot and speed dial, for whatever reason brings us both poutine and the fries. Huh? 

As for my Kobe burger it was bland. Kobe meat doesn't need much to give it flavour. Initially on the first bite it was tasty but that waned quickly. This was definitely a knock off Kobe burger and for this they charge $18.95. Steep price for sub standard meat. I've had Kobe before and it has a very distinct flavour but this burger was null and void of any flavour. 

Meanwhile the table behind us gets their pitchers of Pabst Blue Ribbon beer minutes after ordering and Shari still waits upon her cocktail. Service is whacked. Totally inconsistent.  It even took Kat practically waving her credit card to get the bill. Sure makes me glad that I didn't make a reservation at this place.  We even had to ask for cutlery after she brought the food.  

Whatever. The evening was saved by the great company and a nightcap of coffee and pie at our favorite Pie shrine out in the Beaches. Thanks Tim for saving the night for us. We got more attention from Campbell the dog then we did from our waitress at W Burger Bar and we didn't even have a reservation at the Pie Shack.

W Burger Bar - Two and a half stars and that was for the cocktail."}
{"text":"First impression were pretty bad at W Burger Bar. Walked in, was asked how many people and then proceeded to be completely ignored. Since it wasn't busy I decided to sit down. It was only after we complained to somebody that we got service. 

WBB was quick to recover, providing us with free sweet potato fries (probably could use some salt which could be considered positive and negative). Ordered the Bison burger  (other choices include Beef, Chicken, Turkey, Lamb, and Kobe) on whole wheat with recommended toppings. The burger was a solid serving. It was flavorful but I found the wheat bun very overpowering. My recommendation is to skip the healthy whole wheat and give the white a shot. Had the plain poutine as well which was fine. It was good to have something normal instead of something crazy that seems to be all the rage these days (they do offer a meat one if you want).

I would say that W is the same range as Craft, BQM, GBC, etc., but it differentiates itself by serving 'spiked' milkshakes. If you like the above mentioned competition, then you probably won't be disappointed. I actually think that the decor at W is a minus compared to the more understated Craft, BQM, or GBC. To me, W is a bit too trendy but maybe that's a positive for others."}
{"text":"The Kobe burger was very disappointing. It wasn't anything special at all and not worth the price. I've had a better burger experience with McDonalds premium Angus burgers than this. The malt milkshake was great though, hence the 2 stars. Also this place is excessively loud and you have to shout to seat mates."}
{"text":"This place serves up some pretty tasty burgers 

I ordered the beef burger topped with real cheddar cheese , bacon , lettuce & garlic herb mayonnaise .  This was one of the most flavourful burgers I've ever had . 
It was fresh , juicy and cooked to perfection .  The staff are super friendly and efficient . The inside is nicely decorated and quite comfortable & and is a lot bigger then it looks from the outside . There was plenty of parking available. I did however almost drive by the place because I thought they were closed !!   They should try to light up the place a bit better or get better signage .
  But with that said , you won't be disappointed . Next time I'll have to try the KOBE burger .  Tip ... Go for that on Wednesday , I think it's on special that day !"}
{"text":"Service was good and food was decent.  But what shined was the alcohol.  11 bucks for a pitcher.  Don't come here expecting fancy drinks and out of the world food.  Burger was slightly dry and pretty basic."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from W Burger Bar, and I really wish it was better. I've been here a few times, and make no mistake, it's a good burger place, but it's definitely not a great one. Each time I've gone I've had the beef burger with a mix of different condiments (the wide selection of condiments is great - especially beets, try them if you've never had them) and each time I'm struck by how the meat is somewhat dry and bland, although the toppings are great. The prices are very good, especially when it comes to beer, and the service and ambiance are above par. I'm not a huge fan of onion rings, but other people I've gone with have raved about these ones. Don't bother ordering the poutine over the fries - the gravy isn't that great, and the fries are tasty by themselves.
An odd thing here is the TVs. There is a strange amount of them - not enough to be a sports bar, but enough to be distracting. Also, they show games on them, but play loud music instead of the broadcast. This would be a great place to watch games if they had a couple more TVs and played the game instead of music.
I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars, because it IS above average (especially for the area), but if you're willing to walk an extra 15-20 minutes you'll find better burgers in many other locations."}
{"text":"Poutine was good but when I ordered a Kobe burger, I expected an above par burger for $19. I wasn't expecting \"Kobe\" since only wagyu exists outside of Japan, but I was expecting a way above average burger. 

It was so dry!!! If it was really was a waygyu cattle, it was wasted. Mcd's burger is more juicy than the Kobe burger here... I had high expectations, but was pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Very Slow service. Burgers overcooked. Unprofessional employees. Missing items from my order. Silverware and cups dirty. Dirty atmosphere. Ive never waited so long to get a debit card machine. These employees need someone to manage them. Burger was falling apart barely edible. Fries were skinny, cold, and soft. Fish and chips were gross. The fish was unknown and unseasoned, but the breading was alright. 

To be honest i got full from drinking the pop."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend around 7:00 on a lovely summer evening. 

W Burger Bar was a pretty good venue for us. It is clean and well maintained. It has a pretty fun ambience and lots of TVs if you want to catch up on the latest sports game. 

One thing that I didn't like was that the music was very loud, which made it difficult for us to hear each other and we often had to ask the other to repeat what was just said. 

One aspect that I really liked (and appreciated) was the cheap drink menu! They have drink specials for each day of the week (Friday was a Long Island iced tea for $6.99). They also offer $2 shooters! Pretty hard to resist if you're looking to have a good time!

My friend ordered the potato skins and I had the house salad. Both were decent. Neither particularly stood out, but given the name 'Burger Bar' it's not fair to judge them on dishes that aren't part of their namesake!Service was friendly and attentive.

I'll return for sure, and will definitely have to try out those $2 shooters at some point!"}
{"text":"I love the burgers here... luckily my girlfriend picked the toppings and it was delicious... otherwise I'd have no idea what topping to get.  Wish they had a list of suggested topping groupings."}
{"text":"My Canadian boyfriend took me here on a Wednesday afternoon for lunch. We were both famished, and we were recommended to try this place by his cousin. Needless to say, we both loved it - the burgers and poutine were amazing! Will come back again next time I visit Toronto! Our server was great too! She kept checking on us."}
{"text":"Walking in, I felt the initial atmosphere to be fun, hip, and cool with lots of white walls, tall ceilings, a fully stocked bar, cute girls in cute uniforms, several flat screen TVs, planters lining the banquettes, dark wood tables, dark wood chairs, and an open kitchen. A man came to greet and seat us but there was a severe lack of greeting as he looked rushed although it wasn't close to busy in the restaurant. We were seated and the ordering began.

Service was spotty but I think it was because the server is new. She wasn't too knowledgeable with topping recommendations or was she particularly personable but if she's knew it's understandable and can't fault her for it. She did bring everything we asked for but it just lacked that extra special feeling where a server makes you feel like an individual.

It's called the W Burger Bar. Being a burger bar I expect some pretty stellar burgers coming out of the kitchen and the recommended toppings should not just amaze the taste buds but enhance the flavors of the burger. Unfortunately The W burger bar dropped the ball on the burger and the necessary accompaniments. I enjoyed the complimentary celery, carrots, and dip but it's not the reason I came here. The bison burger, cooked medium, was tough and lacked flavor. The accompanying toppings didn't help the lack luster meat as the sauteed onions lacked seasoning and was also under caramelized and the \"chipotle ketchup\" lacked chipotle and ketchup. The bun was probably the best part of the burger as it was light, fluffy, and sized perfectly to hold the burger so you can put it down without compromising the burger's structural integrity. Score count for food, 0/1.

I ordered 50/50 fries and sweet potato fries but felt they served up 0/3 as the regular fries weren't crisp or flavorful as were the sweet potato fries. If I come back I will definitely try the panko breaded onion rings as they looked fantastic. I also ordered a Red Eye spiked milk shake. It was flavorful and deceivingly larger than expected, these bad boys could be dangerous as you can't taste the alcohol and the chocolate to espresso balance was perfect. Total food score, 1/4.

Overall, the price cannot justify this sit down burger restaurant. 1/4 on a burger bar and the one point is for a spiked milk shake. Take that how you will but it's a disappointment to me considering how nice the space is. If your are going to do a burger bar, please make ALL burgers well."}
{"text":"Fast service given the fact that they had a party of 50+ people there.

Finally a cheat meal that was actually worth it! Their onion rings and fries and gravy were worth all the guilt lol Sooo good."}
{"text":"This place has a really great burger menu, with tons of options for not only toppings, but choice of protein as well, including lamb, turkey, and even veggie or Portobello mushroom for the vegetarians. 

A group of us went for lunch mid-week and we all ended up choosing one of the burger specials for lunch, which is your choice of burger and side with a glass of pop for $11.75. My choice was the brisket burger, with a side of fries. The fries were kind of limp and not at all crispy, so I can't recommend them. One of my friends had the sweet potato fries and really enjoyed them. I'd get those or a side salad next time. 

My burger was not what I expected. It looked and tasted like a regular beef patty. I was expecting something different, perhaps more like a slab of smoked brisket. It tasted really good, so that's what mattered to me. 

Next time, I'll try the lamb burger with feta cheese. Yum."}
{"text":"I have been meaning to come here for awhile, so when a Groupon came up, it was the perfect opportunity.  It seemed a little expensive at first glace for the amount of food you received, but I was pleasantly surprised at how filling and delicious everything was.  

The place was a lot bigger than it looks from the outside.  There were patio seats at the front, a bar that you could sit at, and then a number of seats that stretched down the hallway to a big back area.  

I had the lamb burger and dressed it with tzatiki, feta, onions and tomato.  It was cooked perfectly with generous toppings.  I added the panko crusted onion rings.  OMG so delicious.  The portion was pretty big, so next time I would probably share the side.  

I was delighted to see the variety on the menu.  It wasn't just burgers.  There were a number of other things I wanted to try.  I was also surprised to see tons of drink specials.  I didn't realize that it really had a bar atmosphere (my bad, considering it says \"bar\" right in the name)

Service was friendly and fairly quick.  Lots of people there watching the hockey game - which you could see from any seat in the house on big flat screens.  

Definitely one of the best gourmet burger joints I've tried in Toronto so far."}
{"text":"Yummy burgers... 'Nuff said... Usually get takeout, but the one time I dined in the service was great, attentive."}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time on a Friday. We came mostly for the cheap drinks. Shooters for $2.50! Food was pretty decent for pub fare. But the thing that stood out most to me was the friendly service! It's clear the manager makes sure the waiters/waitresses are providing good customer service. Our waitress was so kind and helped us choose drinks and recommended appetizers. She came by our table often to clear our empty shot glasses and bring us waters. And when another server mistakenly thought we left already and cleared our table while we were in the bathroom, our server apologized profusely and brought us shooters on the house! Kudos to the manager who clearly hires the right people."}
{"text":"So I see this pop up when I'm searching for another burger joint and remember when I used to work close by and coworkers and I would visit here fairly often. I haven't been in awhile, but what always struck me about this place was that while they were  usually pretty busy, they were never so busy to the point that there was no one around to serve you, a common issue with a rising number of bars and burger bistros. 

The W has been around for awhile, and the food is fantastic. Flavorful, generous portions and service is also good. I think the only reason I don't go very often anymore is merely because it is not close to where I work. 

Drink specials and burger deals I do believe are still offered and a draw, and there is plenty of seating available. Atmosphere is laid back but polished, music is not too loud, and there are TV's to keep you up to date on the game.

Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Went here with my mum and was dissapointed. Burgers were small for the price you pay for. They were stingy when it came to the free toppings as well. Onion rings was good - 1star. Service was not attentive.  Not coming back as I would rather go to big smoke"}
{"text":"This place has potential.

The menu is full of choices, including beer and interesting alcohol-laced shakes (which already puts it ahead of most of the other burger joints).
But my burger was kinda tasteless. 
I had the basic burger with \"suggested toppings: chili, mozzerella and sour cream\", and it was just OK.

And the fries were downright bad. 
I'd heard that the restaurant was owned by Quebecois businessmen, so I thought the fries would be outstanding...double-fried like they should be, but alas, that's not the case.

Nevertheless, I plan to go back again, perhaps to try the lamb or bison burger, because I'm rooting for this place to succeed.

By the way, on their menu, it says their Kobe Burger is \"Japanese beef\"....it's not. It's American Wagyu, which is great on its own, but the menu should reflect the reality."}
{"text":"Delicious! Stopped in here mid-afternoon to tide me over until dinner, and ended up coming back two days later for dinner as well. Lots of sliders to choose from, with an assortment of different meat (Kobe, ground, lamb, etc.). Admittedly, my favorite thing about this place is that they give you carrot and celery sticks when you order. So much better than getting bread or rolls. 

If I'm ever in Toronto again, I'll for sure be coming back here."}
{"text":"We went at ~9pm on a Saturday and the place was packed. As a result service was a bit slow. I had the chicken sandwich and my boyfriend had the beef burger. Food was pretty good, although nothing spectacular. I didn't like their fries because I found them too greasy. Overall a really nice burger joint."}
{"text":"I'm basically at W burger bar every week and it's pretty sweet. 

a) beer is cheap. actually cheap, not toronto cheap. ask about specials if you're not sure. i think pitchers of PBR are 8 bucks. 

b) spiked milkshakes. i've only tried the polar bear, and not only was it strong enough to give me a buzz, it was the most delcious thing ever. 

c) here are the delcious things you should eat: ONION RINGS (nuff said), chicken burger (it's actually moist and flavourful, and only made from the happiest of all chickens...or something), burgars (i'm no connoisseur, but damn!)

d) waitresses and bartenders are pretty damn cuuuute. 


A note about the service: I've been coming here on the reg since it opened and there has been a huge improvement in the service since then. Although, I'll admit sometimes they'll miss a topping or something on my burger. The owners are always hanging around and are quick to give you free stuff if a mistake is made."}
{"text":"Eh - it's daily $11 pitchers of PBR and other cheap booze options -- that's the only reason to come here.

Service here is usually pretty minimal and the place is loud attracts an obnoxious pre-clubbing crowd - expect to see plenty of drunk white girls lighting cigarettes the wrong way outside.

I come here every now and then cuz the booze is cheap, it's close to my place and the lady likes the veggie burger option here.  I think I've only actually eaten here once and I honestly don't recall anything about the burger (I wasn't drunk - it was just that forgettable).

But basically, there are two main reasons why I avoid the food here - both are cardinal sins for a burger place:

1) 'Kobe' beef burger on the menu -- which is one of the biggest rip-offs/lies in the restaurant world.  Wagyu beef (commonly mislabeled 'Kobe') is prized for the highly fat-marbled beef - the shit is heavenly when thinly sliced and lightly seared.  Now, tell me -- how does this make a difference in a *burger patty* where you can mix in as much (or little) fat as you like?  I'm not going to even get into the why calling it 'Kobe' on the menu is wrong.  Any place with a 'Kobe/wagyu beef patty' on the menu instantly drops points for me.

2) Too many topping options -- okay, I know some people like customizing their burgers.  But come on dude -- I don't need over a dozen sauce options and a dozen different toppings to pick from.  This is the same reason I hate 'Mongolian wok' style joints -- just assemble the burger as you would recommend in a few pre-set options and I will tell you if it sucks.  I came to eat, not make decisions.

As I said, come here for the cheap booze if you can stomach the crowd."}
{"text":"Great place for a quick bite. The bison burger and massive assortment of toppings was amazing. The service is hit or miss though so be prepared."}
{"text":"Expectations got the better of me.  

Pros - went 2 times around 7:00PM.  Small but lively place filled with friends wanting a reasonable burger and draft beer.  Potential to be even better, but if the place remains crowded, it is less likely to happen. Too bad, when the buzz fades, tough to bring back the crowds.

Cons - poorly trained help, medium quality food is inconsistent.  

Help, the waitresses are all cute and awesome shapes (need to with the standard uniforms).  Someone with restaurant experience needs to train the entire staff on basics.  Between greetings, offering recommendations, inquiring on the meal - all three were missed both times I dined.  Also, the waitress, bartender and busboy all dropped glasses.  2 of the three cleaned the glass off the floor and grabbed food before cleaning their hands.

Food quality.  First, the fries - standard frozen fried that are too soggy.  Either use fresh or learn how to cook them properly.  Next the burgers - balance the toppings.  Our group had different toppings and some had stuff flowing off the plate and others had to lift the burger to find the topping.  Finally, clean the grill. Since you put your kitchen in the open, people watch.   Never saw the cook clean either the open grill or grill top.  All types of burgers (beef, bison, kobe, mushroom, lamb) - were all cooked on the same uncleaned surface.  Also, the peppers, mushrooms, onions were all cooked together.  Tastes blend and people notice it.  They should scrape down the surfaces constantly.

The concept and site are great, but training and execution are sorely needed."}
{"text":"Love the beef burger and bison burger.  Not sure what people complain about.

The place is a very nice, modern, and clean place for the area, given that the neighbourhood is a bit run down.  Police frequent the business so there's definitely no safety issues here.

Beef burger and fries with a side of gravy, favourite, without breaking the bank.  Friendly and excellent service.

Who doesn't like sports? Lots of TVs to fill that hunger."}
{"text":"There was four of us and the table they gave us was pretty small for four orders to sit comfortably along with four drinks. Menu is good but I was kind of disappointed at the burger. It was burnt up, oily and did not have the toppings I requested. My friend also had a similar issue where she clarified that she would like EXTRA tomatoes and got one incomplete slice of tomato. 
Staff is friendly but food quality wasn't worth the price."}
{"text":"i decided to give the burger hype a try in TO. 
we picked W burger bar since we were in that vicinity.

i got their regular burger with a few toppings, n one of their sauces to see what the hype was about. good size of meat i give you. but the burger was ok. i enjoy good burgers, but the W's burgers wasn't that great. the sweet potatoes were decent tho. i got them as fries, and they weren't crunchy, more 'soggy' style but still tasty.

my friend got the bison burger, he said it was good. maybe i should had half a star for that.
but i can't give it 3 stars, wish i could just give them 2 1/2 stars."}
{"text":"I came here twice at the time of the writing of this review, all during dinner hours where I paid the full price on everything. There is a lunch special, and a 4-6 pm half-price appetizer special that I feel is very worth it, which I might try in the future on a not-so-busy day. 

I went with 2 other people, we shared a plate of 6 sample-sliders which showcased the entire line-up of their burger meat (this was an appetizer of roughly $20, which as you can see, could be $10 during happy hour). It includes regular beef, bison, lamb, turkey, Kobe beef, and pulled pork.  Of course, the condiments on the sliders were not offered a choice. They slapped on their special sauces and items which obviously makes the entire thing taste differently if you had ordered the actual full sized burger with that meat and slapped your own choice of condiments on there.  Nevertheless, they were pretty good. 

I also enjoyed a regular, full sized beef burger. When I eat beef burgers I go for a level of juiciness and the instinctive smell of the freshness of the meat. There were many different complementary condiments you could add, plus other ones at some cost. As usually, I recommend adding an egg to your burger.  They did not make the egg oily or charred, and served the purpose of why I always add eggs... to increase the steamy, juiciness of whatever is in between the buns, but not in liquid, dripping form (I hate those). I also added peameal bacon for fun, but I regretted this choice because it didn't do anything special or add to the paradigm of taste.

The only thing I didn't really think was any special was the bread buns. They were a bit cold, raw, and it just feels lacking. The restaurant could do /something/ to improve the experience of the burger bite by doing something to the bread. It didn't taste bad or anything."}
{"text":"Burger bar, burger bar. I've had better, I've had worse.

I work down the street from W Burger Bar, so occasionally I'll pop by and pick something up for lunch. I'll say this: if you come to W Burger Bar, stick with the burgers and don't bother with any of their other food items. The burgers I've had here have been good. There is a nice selection of toppings you can put on them, and a few different types of meat and beef you can choose. I like that you have the option of wrapping your burger in lettuce instead of a bun. 

All the other food I have had here, I have regretted getting as soon as I got it. The chicken fingers are tough and dry, the deep fried pickles are dry with the breading falling off, the poutine was cold and the fries aren't anything special. Stick. With. The Burgers.

I can't say how they taste as I haven't tried them, but they do have an interesting looking array of boozey milkshakes. Mmmmmm. Booze + Ice Cream.

Staff is hot & cold. Some are nice and friendly, some treat you as if you are a pain for being there.

The two star yelp description does W Burger Bar justice - \"Meh\" pretty much describes how I feel about it!"}
{"text":"I have a love-hate relationship with this place.

Pros: Tasty burger, pretty consistent, cheap beer, hot waitresses, close to home.

Cons: Loud (i.e., LOUD), and tables are too close together.

My order: turkey burger - dijon mustard, horseradish, alfalfa sprouts, mixed greens, tomatoes, pickles, relish, sauteed onions. Delicious. If you want to try new condiments, ask for them on the side.

Good for groups (they'll take large reservations), but the noise makes conversation difficult. Better if you want to be rowdy and shout at the hockey game."}
{"text":"How can you say no to $2.50 shooters?  This place has one of the cheapest drinks so if you're ready to have a drunken night, pre drink here!  You can also get their special beer for $10.  I tried their mojito in their mason jar for $7.50- it tasted really delciois!"}
{"text":"My partner and I got some take out burgers there and we were pretty impressed. The burgers themselves were good (I had Bison, she had Beef), and there's a huge variety of topping choices. We also had poutine, which was really satisfying. Portions were generous, but not horrifyingly large.

We had a drink there while we were waiting for our food. There's a nice selection of taps and cocktails, all at very reasonable prices. The atmosphere hits a pleasant middle ground between nice and too nice. We didn't have any issues with poor service like the other reviewer, everyone was attentive, but they all seemed...nervous. I suppose that happens when you open a new restaurant, but I would encourage the management to loosen up a bit; it's okay to make small talk. 

This place is in danger of becoming our new \"go to\" place. It isn't oh-my-god brilliant, but it seems really solid. And really solid is a good thing.

Edit: Went back and ate in. Service was pretty poor. Dropped to 3 stars. Despite the middling rating, I will still be going there a lot. I really like the place, it just has room for improvement.

Edit2: Been going fairly consistently for awhile, the staffing and organizational issues have cleared up. Back to 4 stars!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for a friends birthday. Got the beef burger with a side of onion rings. The meal was good and reasonably priced. Also they have $2 and $3 shots which are pretty good. 

For a Tuesday night the place was packed! Good thing we had reservations!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a nice burger n' fries dinner with family. Nice venue, and the music isn't too loud. 

The burger was exquisite. I would like to try the bison burger (or the Kobe if my numbers come up), but the burger is good. I like blue cheese on my burgers, and the blue cheese they have is nice. 

The fries are ok at best, but the ceasar is mediocre. You can get coke in a glass bottle, though."}
{"text":"The food and service was fantastic, not to mention the waitress was polite, and cheerful. 
Specially like the idea of choosing what you would like on your burger, and since the woman i was with was vegetarian, they have that covered too so you can have your burger between two pieces of lettuce, which mind you i have never seen done. :-) Will for sure be returning."}
{"text":"We came for some late night drinks and cheap shooters and they delivered. Some drinks are better than others. Our server was also very nice and accommodating. I remember having food here before and enjoyed it, specifically their poutine."}
{"text":"We were downtown for an appointment this day, and we had time to stop for lunch afterward. We decided to give this place a try, we were craving something burgery. Based on the decent Yelp reviews, we decided to give this a try. I wanted a place where I could sit at a table and relax.

I think we were the first people in the place, after it had just opened. The waitress was friendly and nice, and took our beer order. She quickly came back and let me know that the beer I'd ordered was having trouble coming out the tap, and recommended an alternative. The beer selection is pretty decent, with some macros and at the time of my visit, Okanagan.

Everything is a la carte, so if you order a burger, it doesn't come with any sides. This makes things pricey. We decided to split a poutine, and we both ordered basic burgers. They were decent and tasty, and the poutine was quite delicious. The service by the waitress was excellent, and that's what put this at 4 stars.

I think overall, it's pretty pricey for a decent burger, and I am guessing this place is pretty busy in the evenings. I'd probably visit again."}
{"text":"W Burger Bar is a pretty decent, no-fuss place to grab a quick bite. The service is friendly and efficient. The place is kind of diner-ish. The extensive menu has something for everyone. In addition to burgers, they had sandwiches, salads, chicken fingers, hot dogs etc.  I normally just get a beef burger with cheddar. I tried the veggie burger once (which is vegan-friendly, btw). It's a patty of veggies, tofu, and grains and it was not very good. The patty was dry and lacked flavour. I would stick to the meat options, unless you're vegetarian. The sliders are adorable and a good way to sample different burgers - beef, pork, turkey, lamb. The long list of complimentary toppings and sauces is impressive. I'm a big fan of the cilantro yogurt. 
As for sides, I like that you can order a \"50/50\" - half regular fries and half sweet potato fries. The panko-breaded onion rings are also kind of amazing (and HUGE). 
For drinks, there's some standard cocktails and a small selection of beers and wines, but they also have spiked milkshakes! Sounds kinda odd to me, but maybe I'll have to try it next time. 
Prices are pretty reasonable. Burgers/sandwiches don't come with a side dish, so you have to order it separately. But the portions are pretty big, so you can usually share one side between 2 people."}
{"text":"As how it usually is, I was lured here not by the food but by the promise of booooooze - spiked  milkshakes and 3 shot fishbowls were too heavenly of a proposition to turn down.

I didn't order a burger, but a lot of people in our party did. As far as I can tell, having poached a few bites off a friend, they were fine. Solid burgers. The fries were the really thin, crispy kind - you can get them plain or in poutine form; it's a nice change from the starchy, fat, meaty fries that you usually find in poutine. Overall, good food but nothing exciting, which was OK since food was secondary to my goal. As I like to think, there are three cures for mediocre food: good, good enough, or enough alcohol. 

Got the pineapple fishbowl - it's served in a cute little fishbowl. It's pretty potent, especially since it really just tasted like straight juice. Couldn't really detect the vodka sting to it, which was a little scary since we were sitting at the bar and I definitely saw her put it into my drink. We're talking creepy frat party levels of mysterious punch. Really enjoyed it, and quite a deal for $10.

The spiked shakes were very good too - solid, creamy and thick. They were pretty sweet, and covered with whipped cream. I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so it was actually a bit much for me. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Bison Pepper Burger @wburgerbar
Monster Rings
Poutine 

A dinner of champions with friends. 
The burger options here are WoW. 
It was my first time here. I must have been living under a rock. 

The meat is amazing and is not full of fillers. Everything was made fresh. 
It was worth the 30 min wait. 

Looking forward to the other great options here."}
{"text":"Met a friend in Toronto and we decided to meet up here for lunch. Simple looking place with not much for decor that I could tell but they had all the football games on which was good. I had a Lamb burger the the other guys had the Bison. We also tried the classic Canadian favorite Poultine, it was very delicious.  But the low star rating was because of the burgers everybody ordered their temperature Medium since the meat is very lean but showed up Well done which was as guessed Very dry. Service was nice and I liked the local brew, Sleeman Honey Brown."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of W Burger Bar!  $2 shots, can't go wrong with that and I love the drinks that come served in a fishbowl.  Cheap pitchers too. They take reservations, but any party greater than 6 is pretty difficult for them to accommodate.

They have a great selection of pub-style food and I would recommend the chicken nachos and their poutine that comes with ground beef.  The atmosphere is lively but not too loud, there's sometimes some sports playing in the background.  

It's just a great after-work place to grab a drink.  They also have a burger and fries online special that I've done before too.  Great value."}
{"text":"I wanted to find a place around Yonge and College to dine at after singing Karaoke so I chose this place since I remember my friend, Precilla, enjoying this restaurant.

I told my boyfriend that we must share a milkshake like in those cheesy movies/cartoons/shows that I watch/read when I was little. I'm glad we did share a milkshake because it was delicious but also very rich so you won't be able to finish it on your own.

We also shared a beef burger (he was kind enough to let me add whatever I want into it in which he later picked out everything) and a large poutine. Let me tell you, even though we each only had half a burger, we were not able to finish a poutine so opt for the small poutine whether you're sharing or eating it by yourself.

The burger wasn't the juiciest burger I've ever had in my life but it was decent for the price ($6.50, I believe) and you have an option of adding many toppings and sauce. The poutine was also very standard.

I give this restaurant 4 stars because the service was decent, food was decent and price was good."}
{"text":"I really like the food and drinks they serve here. But they have a serious problem with the service. Why they have to be SO SLOW? 

I've been there twice. First time for lunch, ordered a small salad, it was super giant and delicious. But had to wait ages and the place was quite empty. The second time I went for dinner and drinks, even bar was OMG SLOOOOW. I can't understand, they should hire extra staff if they can't deal with the current amount of orders. I have to say, everything, from food to drinks, was impeccable, awesome, but I hate waiting so long for food and simple drinks. 

I'll probably come back, but there are better (and cheaper) places around."}
{"text":"After reading some reviews about W Burger Bar, I decided to pay the place a visit with my brother before heading off to a concert at the Phoenix.

The interior of the W Bar appeared very industrial, with gray colours and simplistic furniture. I found the hallway leading to the bathroom to be very dull, yet the bathroom was very clean and organized.

I found the food at the W Burger Bar to be quite delicious. I had the Chicken Burger, while my brother went with the Bison Burger. I loved the array of toppings to choose from, but I felt that the garlic mayonnaise was my favourite addition. My brother and I also shared a small fries and onion rings, which we found tasty. However, next time we would probably only order small fries because the onion rings were slightly overcooked. 

Overall, I enjoyed my stay at the W Burger Bar, but the people beside us were obnoxious and rude. The tables were way too close and we could not help but eavesdrop on their conversations. I found that they ordered maybe two drinks between three people and would not stop yelling or making inappropriate comments. Additionally, the staff continually was attending to their table, having quick conversations and seemed unprofessional."}
{"text":"I revisited this place yesterday and what a turn around since I first came in.
I ordered a Stella (that wasn't on tap) and the waitress just brought me a bottle.  Uhhh I'd like to be somewhat of a lady so could you bring me a glass?
When she passed me a \"clean\" glass it looked like it had been used and rinsed.  You might want to check your dishwasher because that looks REALLY bad.
Smudges and smears all over the glass I was disgusted.

Service wasn't the greatest and this place used to be packed! 

Look how things have changed."}
{"text":"I cam here for a late dinner/ drinks for a work social. The staff was very pleasant and the atmosphere was great. TV's surrounding the walls which is always a plus in my books. 

We started with drinks, most were to shy to try the spiked milkshakes and stick to beer. But one brave sole tried the chocolate monkey milkshake, It looked delicious!

The food was great, they sure do know how to make a burger, the Kobe beef burger was my choice and it was fantastic! A huge selection of toppings to add.

The one downfall to this place is the bathrooms are in the basement and are by no means roomy. In fact I smacked my head off the roof as I tried to squeeze my way into the stalls.   

Cool place worth a try if you are in the area"}
{"text":"I love this place, come hungry! I had the bison burger it was fantastic and so were the sweet potato fries. The toppings were divine. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"$9 pitches of Sleeman - need I say more?!?!?

I was out with two of my guy friends, bar hopping and watching the last Montreal/Philly Game and we ended up here - mainly because there was $9 pitchers.

What a night -  we downed 4 pitchers, a caesar, an order of fries and 2 orders of poutine - and the bill was only $75!  I don't think that I would eat the poutine or the caesar again, but it's a great place for cheap beer.

The poutine was blah, nothing compared to Craft Burger.  It was interesting to see a poutine served in a bowl...I'm used to it in a cardboard container.

Not gonna lie - this place was HOT!  So hot I was sweating.  The front window was open and the fans were on but it was still VERY VERY HOT.

Our waitress Malory was a great sport and was new on the job, but she hung in there with our crazy antics.

I'll have to stop in next time to try the burgers and of course have some more $9 pitchers."}
{"text":"I went to W Burger bar when it first opened on College Street. I thought it was a great burger and I was a very happy customer. About a year or two later a friend of mine went and came back saying he thought it sucked. I couldn't understand why but I thought today would be a good day to get a second opinion.

I went to the new location on Caledonia Road and having some trouble with the street location I finally found it in the middle of what looked like warehouses but in reality weren't. I walked in and sat at the bar; W Burger is a sit down burger joint with a rather large menu for a burger place. They have starters, salads, sandwiches and fish. They also have a variety of burgers including beef, Kobe beef, chicken, and lamb and as per usual a variety of toppings such as fried egg, portobello mushrooms and cilantro yoghurt.

I order the usual, a double beef (two 6 oz patties) with ketchup, mustard, tomato, lettuce, onion and pickle, with a coke and fries. The grill guy was out in the open but I was distracted and didn't see him put the burger on the grill (actually a flattop). It took about 10/15 minutes which is the longest I've waited since starting these reviews.

I got the coke first, which came in a frosted coke glass which is always good and keeps the drink nice and cold. Then the burger and fries came. The burger was massive, the fries thin and fresh cut. I dug into the fries first. They were okay. Nothing special. I think they needed to be thicker which would make them better.

Then I tried to squish the burger down so it would fit into my mouth. I couldn't so I just bit into it as best I could. Now remember I said I thought the burger all those years ago was very good. Well this one wasn't that good. It wasn't the worst burger but it also wasn't very good.

But let's get the good out of the way first. The onions were crispy red onions that were whole rings and very tasty. And the pickles were yummy, the best part of the burger. The bun was a good size for the patty and had a nice flavour (more to be said about the bun below) and the burger patty was still juicy. That's about it for the good.

The bad. Where to begin. Let's start with the patty. It's a flattop burger like I said, but there was no crust, no burnt edge, nothing. It had the taste of a grilled burger which is kind of weird and it felt rather tough for a flattop burger. Usually a flattop keeps the burger very tender, not here, not by a long shot. After two or three bites I noticed a strange taste which I thought was something other than the patty. I ripped a piece off one of the patties and ate it. I was wrong, the strange taste was the patty. It tasted like something was in the patty that wasn't beef. Egg maybe? Maybe the lamb or bacon that's grilled on the flattop along with the burgers? Either way it just wasn't the greatest taste for a pure beef burger.

Then there were the toppings. The lettuce was chopped but so soft and wilted and the tomato was stringy and tasted old, not like a fresh tomato should. And now back to the bun. It had a good flavour but it just wasn't soft enough. It wouldn't crush, it wouldn't bend to my liking, it was annoying, it wasn't what I would call a perfect burger bun by any stretch of the imagination.

When I was close to done a new order was taken from a new table and I got to see the patty pulled out of the drawer and placed on the flattop. It wasn't a fresh red beefy colour, it was brown and looked like it was made a day or two ago which could account for the taste I had experienced. Then I got the bill and after tip (15%--it is a sit down restaurant with servers) it came to $21.50 (rounded).

So it turns out my friend was right, this place just wasn't that good. Maybe it was better when they first opened but man was I disappointed today. The quality wasn't there, the taste wasn't there and it was one of the most expensive burgers I have ever had. For that money it sure as hell wasn't worth it. There are by far worse burgers out there in Toronto but there are so many better burgers that I can't really see myself returning here, nor after this experience, would I want to.

{"text":"The toppings may be interesting, but what is the point of a burger if it is cooked within a millimeter of being carbonized?

Oh, and LOUD."}
{"text":"We've lived at Yonge & College for a little less than a year but had yet to go to this place. I've been here before with a group of friends but hard to review when you had a lettuce wrap burger!

Came tonight with the husband. The place was packed, I guess because there were a ton of drink specials on a Thursday night. Had no idea but I'd probably come back for the drink specials. $10 pitchers sound good to me!

We had the lamb burger and bison burger. I had simple toppings: lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and red onions with Garlic and herbs mayo, mustard, hot sauce on the lamb. Husband had the same but with chipotle mayo and salsa on the bison. We had low expectations but they cooked the burgers pretty well. My lamb burger was moist and flavourful. The bison was hard to tell since there were too many toppings and a big soggy! We also got the 1/2 regular and 1/2 sweet potato fries. Large portion and small thin fries but the dip that came with it (some sort of mayo) was pretty tasty. The fries were a big dry but seasoned well. 

We opted not for drinks tonight but after our meal, our waitress said they were giving out free popsicles: creamsicle or fudge. Pretty nice ending to our meal! I'd definitely come back for the drinks and a good burger. Pretty reasonable prices for the food as well. The couple next to us had a giant nachos appetizer that looked really good. The only thing I had a complaint about was the noise. After a long day of work, I was pretty annoyed in having to practically scream to have a conversation. Other than that, a good restaurant with good service."}
{"text":"messiest burger ever sauces are dripping everywhere cuz i think the bottom bun is smaller than the top one?? 
I WANT TO EAT A BURGER WITH MY HANDS!!! NOT KNIFE AND FORKS!!!!
anyways the lamb burger tastes really good and it's really satisfying!"}
{"text":"been here a while ago and i remember they had a great selection of delicious burgers!! and cheap drinks which was awesome!

I also recall the waitresses being super bubbly, cute and fun. 

I don't know why I haven't been back, but I will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but there isn't a lot.  It's hard to fill up on this for a dinner without spending a lot of money. 

Its fantastic that you can essentially make your own burger, but there is a cost....The place can get packed very quickly and when it does it's so loud that I want to hurt people.  

Alcohol can get very cheap...which is very nice! the Owner is a really nice guy as well...very sweet, got a free brownie once :).  Burgers are good but a bit messy, as the bun gets really drenched.  

My boyfriend is bugging me to add that THERE IS NOT ENOUGH FOOD.  You have to get something on the side...or you will be hungry. 

Cost: 2 People 2 mains, 2 sides, $30
Food quality: 4/5
Food quantity: 2/5
Alcohol Selection: 4/5
Service: 4/5

Would I Go Again: Yes."}
{"text":"I've got a bad case of the meat sweats as I write this.  Having been to various burger joints nearby, I was pretty stunned to see how packed up this place was.  I was also pretty stunned by our server.  Like a deer in headlights, I had chestigo everytime she came within view.  Now, I'm not normally a pervert, but I'm sure that I am on that page in the back of her book now, with a capital P.  But this review is supposed to be about the place, not the tits.

I ordered the Aussie special.  For the uninitiated, this comes with a fried egg, pickled beats, pineapple, boobs and bacon.  The burger patty itself was a good 8 or 10 oz, and had an absolutely DELICIOUS flavour to it.  I quite had my mind blown by this tower of tits....  I mean beef.  It took me a whole 3 minutes to inhale this fucker.  I mean it.  I was engorging myself with every ounce of strength.  The sweet titty fries, I mean sweet potato tits... You know what I mean...  They were quite tasty as well, although not salty enough, and the only condiment was ketchup.  I'm sure we could have ordered one of their many sauces, but we were too busy staring.  I mean eating.  

Another thing should be mentioned.  Their ranch sauce was AMAZING on the celery and breasts.  Er.  Carrots.

The bill clocked in at a whopping $18, but it was great!"}
{"text":"I've come back to W Burger Bar several times since my last review. I think the service has improved considerably and I've come to realize that it is a really unique spot.

For a sit-down restaurant, the food is really reasonably priced and tastes great. (I like the free appetizer veggies too.) Pitchers of beer I think start at $10 -- incredible. And equally important, the interior is clean, modern, and incorporates pictures of old Toronto. Many places with decent prices like this have shabby interiors, but Burger Bar isn't like this at all.

Consider the customer service infractions noted in my previous review forgiven!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday night and the vibe of this restaurant felt like a night club. If you like this type of atmosphere, then you will like this place. Personally, I expected it to be more like a restaurant that you did not have to scream across the table in order for your friend to hear you. But it was an experience, so we stuck it out. On Thursday night Martinis are $6.99, so I got a watermelon one because I love Watermelon. I am really not a fan of cocktails, so I really don't know why I got one. There was nothing special about it, but then again, I don't care for cocktails. In terms of food, I ordered the pulled pork poutine with sweet potato fries instead of the regular fries ($2 extra). My friend ordered the onion rings and a sandwich (can't remember which one). The best part of my friend's meal was the aioli, which I tried and really liked as well, so I got one for myself. The poutine itself was ok. What I did not like about my poutine were the overcooked fries, and the thick and chunky gravy. The portion was good and I did like the actual pulled pork. Would I come here again? Sure, but on a day that is nice out so that I can sit outside in their little patio, rather than indoors where screaming can become a necessity."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery to my hotel. Very flavorful burger, tastiest onion rings I've ever eaten, and delectable poutine. My only recommendation is to ask them to include a plate and utensils. They were not included. Definitely a wonderful burger experience. Update 2/14/16: second time ordering wasn't quite as successful. The onion rings were not cooked well enough so the breaking was doughy."}
{"text":"The beer is so cheap that it is impossible to give this place anything less than four stars. Not going to lie, the food could honestly be poisonous and I'd still give a place four stars for serving $10 pitchers (I'd be writing the Yelp review from the hospital, but still).

Went here on a Saturday night and this place was PACKED, so you're going to want to make a reservation (that is, unless you enjoy standing around waiting and making small talk with your dining companions while you're all preoccupied by eyeing other patrons meals and willing them to hurry up and leave). In spite of the crowd, service was actually quite speedy!

I had the Portobello Burger and it was delicious! I love that they have such a wide selection of toppings to choose from (careful though - not all of these are free of charge and they can definitely add up!).  When I ordered my burger, I was asked what I would like for a side.  The phrasing of this question lead me to believe that sides were included with the burger. Be aware: THEY ARE NOT!  The fries were decent enough, but not fantastic by any means. If I were to do it all again, I'd skip them and just order more cheap beer! :D"}
{"text":"Since my last review I've been back a few times and have been disappointed in some way or another.

Sometimes they give you the little chocolate square at the end, but usually they don't. I don't know what the criteria is to getting that, but getting it twice I expected to get it every time, but not so much.

Sometimes service is slow, sometimes it's good. You get the best service if you sit at the bar I find. The girls who work there are friendly. The only problem with this place is that they constantly overcook their burgers. Their staff does not know how to grill a burger. It's dried out almost every time. The suggested toppings are great. The buns are pretty decent. The beef itself would taste better if they didn't suck all the moisture out of it from overcooking it.

I tried the sampler the last time I went. Lamb was good, turkey was good, beef on beef was good (beef burger with chili on it). The bison was decent. The Kobe beef burger was quite disappointing! For all that talk about fancy beef, I expected a bit more. Do the owners and managers know that their cooking staff is completely destroying any potential of people buying the Kobe beef burger a second time because they dry it out? I've heard a lot about this beef, but if this was my only impression of it I'd never order it. I asked for medium rare and they can't do that because they don't grind their own meat. Fine... But if I ask for medium I don't want it to come back extra well done!! Like, this is insane, the staff does not know how to cook a burger! I think 1 out of the 6 or 7 times I've been I've had a proper burger that blew me away (and that was the first time)

I only come here because of the nice atmosphere and because I don't want to deal with the overcrowding at Craft Burger. If you're looking for a solid delicious burger done perfectly right, go to Craft Burger. If you want second best in a nicer atmosphere where it's less take-out style, then go to W Burger Bar. Depends what I feel like dealing with that day.

Their beef chili is amazing though. Their salad is bad. Their signature cocktail is mediocre.

Solid 3 stars because they are consistently inconsistent with properly cooking the beef. Also, some days service is better than others.

W Burger Bar, if you read this, please teach your staff how to cook a burger properly because I want to love you more than I do now. Also, maybe it'd be a good idea to invest in a meat grinder and grind your own meat so as to be able to please the people who want a medium rare burger. Craft Burger doesn't even ask how you want your burger, they just do it right."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Huge portions, delicious food, bomb service. Unpretentious setting - not too trendy, but clean and modern, great vibes.

The three of us first shared a MASSIVE plate of pulled pork nachos (they did not skimp! it was totally delicious and we totally devoured it) then followed it up with the sampler sliders (which were adorably plated). In order of least to most delicious, it would have to be the bison, lamb, kobe, turkey, beef, then the brisket for me. All of them were delicious with the exception of the bison - too tough and those grassy sprouts did not do it any good.

Cranberry sauce on the turkey was great although the meat itself was a bit dry. One of us really loved the lamb. Spicy ketchup on the lamb and kobe was a bit hot for me, but I'm certainly an outlier when it comes to spice. Can't go wrong with classic beef, but the brisket was two of us' definite favourite - very tender, juicy, just lovely! 

We also had some shooters which were hilariously ripe with innuendo: I Wanna Leia (delicious & sweet, kind of Kool-Aid-y), Honey Dew Me (bitter and not that tasty), Blue Balls (listerine, bleh), Broken Down Golf Cart (one of my favourites, $2 special as it's being taken off the menu, unfortunately). 

Service was top notch too. All this and splitting a Pabst comes to around $25 a person. DAMN. And those nachos - too good. We all went home with three unplanned food babies.

Final Verdict: want to come back and try everything (which I promptly did). The nachos weren't as good as the first time, but you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Amazing place with amazing shots for amazing prices. Oh and amazing staff foods good too. BEER AND SHOTS FOR $2!!! music could be better though. But I totally recommend!!"}
{"text":"I am normally not a fan of burgers, but W burger Bar really won me over. 

Highly recommend: Beef or Lamb Burger with Garlic Herb Mayonnaise Sauce. Make sure to put cranberry sauce as one of the toppings. Really savoury balance of the meat with the sweetness of the sauce. Flavourful, and just the right size. 

Location: conveniently located right across from the College TTC station

Décor: Patio is nice, right on college street. The interior is a little dark, and has a bit of a sports bar feel to it, especially with all the TVs. 

Price: Surprisingly affordable. The beef burger is only $7.5. 

Ambience: A little too loud for my taste. It was difficult to hold a conversation, with all the shouting that was going on from the adjacent table. 

Service: Very good. Servers are friendly and considerate. Remembered that I don't take ice with my water when refilling."}
{"text":"Hubby & I shared the sliders tasting platter with the 1/2 regular fries & 1/2 sweet potato fries & onion rings. I was really surprised to see the burgers come in fully dressed with condiments. I'm allergic to some condiments & hate the taste of others. So because they came with ketchup, mayo, mustard etc I could actually eat only two of the sliders that didn't have any condiments on them. The Kobe slider tasted strange to me. And the overall presentation was sloppy. The regular fries tasted like they were over-salted. But I liked the sweet potato fries. The onion rings were gigantic and the batter they were coated in didn't have any flavour. The food was really disappointing. 

They only had two waitresses running the whole space with one manager, two cooks & one bus boy. Despite this the service was actually okay. One of the waitresses was really nice & the manager actually served us as well. But the other waitress was walking around with a sneer on her face. She looked like she could care less about anything going on there. But perhaps she was having a bad day.

As for the look of the place, it looks less swanky in the light of day. There was food on the floor that didn't get swept up. Anyway after the lunch both my husband & I felt nauseous. Needless to say we won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great burgers. (I would hope so, because that is their name.) 

I had the bison burger which I loved. The poutine was very good as well but the burger is what made me really happy."}
{"text":"You know those nights where you eat a very expensive, delicious gourmet dinner and two hours later, you've digested it, peed it out and starving?  That's how we ended up at W Burger Bar.

Arrived around 10pm on a Friday night.  Lots of big groups awaiting reserved tables but we were able to get in on a table for two.

Our server came over right away for drink orders.  Although I was tempted by the fish bowl of fruity booze that the barely legal girls at the next table were slurping, we went with a pitcher of Sleeman's Honey Brown, a bargain price at $12.99.  

We decided to split the beef burger ($6.99), an order of onion rings ($3.99) and a large poutine ($6.99).  The kitchen was kind enough to half our burger for us.

Unfortunately, it wasn't a very tasty burger - very dry and kinda on the small size with no additional sides.  Onion rings were tasty, as was the poutine but we found the fries on the thin size.

Wasn't a big fan of the ambience - lots of youngings guzzling shooters, groups of guys bro-ing it up over rounds of Long Island Ice Teas, etc.  Burger was edible but not fabulous enough for a return visit."}
{"text":"Brought in for the booze... Stayed for the booze. 
A regular beef burger with an assortment of free toppings + avocado is what I ordered with a Lynchburg lemonade fishbowl to wash it down. Came out to about $22; not that bad. 
The lemonade was delicious, seriously good, but the burger wasn't anything special.
As far as service goes: it was a quiet day so we were served relatively calmly and quickly, although the waitress forgot the one ingredient to my friend's desired burger; bacon.
All in all it was a decent experience, and I would recommend it to my friends, but only for a night out of drinking to be honest."}
{"text":"The food is okay--nothing special.  The service especially weekend brunch is an abomination.  What a tragic missed opportunity to pickup the Frans overflow."}
{"text":"When I go out to eat, I generally follow two lines of reasoning: 

1) I crave something exotic that I have yet to figure out how to make well at home; or 

2) I seek comfort food-higher calorie and faster and at a different time of day than I'd usually get it I were to expend the effort myself. 

Otherwise, I've got more than enough to eat at home. 

My tastes and frequent downtown employment generally give me the opportunity to pursue option #1-down here they are legion: curries and noodle soups and flatbread-wrapped sandwiches from around the world. I am free to explore the dodgiest spots and have only myself to blame for the occasional tummy ache. 

My friends may have less adventurous palates, and since I'm no great fan of dining alone, I wind up on the #2 track often enough. 

W Burger Bar is a salve to my less-adventurous friends. Part of the Great Burger Wave of the mid-2000s, it anchors a heritage building at Yonge and College. Right near Frans, and a Starbucks-perfect for less-adventurous diners with a few extra minutes for lunch. 

It's been a while since I've hit the bar scene, but W has always struck me as more of a pickup joint than a burger bar. All hard angles and bouncing sound and tables squished too close for comfort, dominated by determined drinkers at the front and blaring TVs throughout the joint. Perhaps they seek to put the \"Meat\" in \"meat market\". 

A pretty, young server (the staff is all pretty and young\") screams above the din, \"DO WE WANT A TABLE?\". 

We scream back, \"YES\". 

\"IT'LL BE A FEW MINUTES\" (it's true, the place is always busy)

\"OK\" (I'm getting a bit hoarse, and will likely be pretty quiet through lunch as a result). 

\"WOULD YOU LIKE TO WAIT AT THE BAR?\"

\"NO THANKS, WE'RE JUST HERE FOR LUNCH\". 

She pouts, prettily. Staff all pout prettily when we tell them we don't want alcohol. 

Eventually, we are seated, and shrieked at in greeting by our server \"HAVE YOU BEEN HERE BEFORE? DO YOU KNOW HOW IT WORKS?\". 

I resist the temptation to point at my tummy and say \"The meat goes here, right?\". 

I give W credit; they present an impressive array of burgers (grilled or flat-topped-my preference for juiciness' sake), sides (including onion rings like a boss), and a few other items. Food takes a while to arrive and is subject to frequent mix-ups, but when it gets here, it's hot and fresh from the open kitchen. 

On a lark, I try the fish and chips. Fish arrives overcooked in undercrisp batter; a small portion I try not to feel bad about in the name of portion control. It's sided by really good, thin, crispy fries, which completely undermine my portion control argument. Coleslaw tastes of vinegar and wilt. 

Burgers are the restaurant's calling card, and other than the general Night at the Roxbury vibe, my biggest complaint. You see, I make really good hamburgers. Often. Purists would say they're more mini-meatloaves (I add veggies and eggs and breadcrumbs), but trust me, they're delicious and juicy and thick. 

W Burger Bar features fun buns, and all manner of condiments...but the meat itself is just kinda there. Often dry, and overcooked, and lacking beefy depth. And expensive for what you get, in an environment the lacks the greasy fun of 'downscale/upscale' burger joints like Big Smoke or Burger's Priest (although in fairness, their knockoff of Shake Shack's portobello and fried jalapenos make the Priest a find in any case). 

So, yeah. I go along to get along, feel a little bit creeped out over my lunch hour and head back to the office, thinking ahead to dinner. 

Did I mention I eat better at home?"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favourite spots to watch NBA games, eat good food, drink and hang out. It's generally pretty packed especially on weekends so it might be a good idea to make reservations. The organic burger, burger with a fried egg and or avocado is fire!"}
{"text":"I ate at W Burger Bar with a couple friends for lunch. Unfortunately I didn't really experience the *bar* part of the restaurant, but I did experience the food and service. 

My friends and I all ordered the lunch special, which is a full sized burger, a side and a drink for a staggeringly low $11.50. For a sit down restaurant with full service, this is really low! I couldn't believe it. 

The food was great - you get to customize your burger by choosing a patty and toppings. You can also choose from other sides (my friend loved his poutine) and a choice of soft drink. For the price, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better burger meal. 

The service was great too. I didn't catch her name, but our server was friendly and personable. It was my friend's birthday so she gave him two popsicles at the end of the meal, instead of the complimentary one. Oh yeah, they also give you free popsicles. 

My lunch experience at W Burger Bar left me excited about the other experiences I could have here. Can't wait to try it out!"}
{"text":"Two days ago, I discovered burger heaven! I told myself I'd try to get away from doing reviews on this blog, but this place was too good to pass up. Yes it was so good I had to write about it. Two days later, and I'm still craving a wburger.

It was Thursday night and I was craving something meaty. I like to consider myself somewhat of a burger connoisseur. A friend and I have spent the last 4 years experimenting and trying out different restaurant and pub burgers, giving each our own personal rating and class etc etc. Friend texted me and wanted to know if I wanted to do dinner and try out this burger joint called wBurger Bar. Jackpot. A burger joint. Just the meaty dish I was craving for.

Thursday nights are $2 Sleeman nights at wBurger. They're half pints though, but order a pint and you save a buck almost. Sleeman pints are normally $4.97. They start you off with veggies and dip at no charge. They have a great menu of burgers. I like how the focus was on the burger, the meat. How it works is you select your burger meat, and the toppings and sides are listed on the side of the menu, and you order your burger to your liking. They have a range of meats from regular \"hormone and anti-biotic free fresh from the farm ground beef\" to high class Japanese Kobe beef.

I broke the temptation to try out the exotic beefs like bison, kobe, lamb, and a special scramble egg mixture (they even have vegetarian options like portabello mushroom and veggie patty) and went for the ground beef. What scored a point on my check sheet was when they asked if they wanted it medim well, well, or well done. And even asked if I wanted it on a flat top or a char grill. Oh the sweet lovely details. My order was the ground beef with mixed greens, roasted peppers, sauteed unions, chipotle ketchup, and garlic and herb mayo with a side order of 50/50 fries (regular potato and sweet potato fries). My friend had the bison burger with sauteed onions, chipotle ketchup and horse radish with a size of panko breaded onion rings. I'll tell you about that in a bit. The onion rings themselves were worth blogging about.

Despite all the veggies I loaded onto it, they paid particular attention to the detail. Instead of a large sloppy mess to make the burger look bigger than it was, they actually fung shui-ed the veggies and sauce so that it all fit under the bun and still making the meat the prominent part of the burger! As for the taste, they added just enough of the condiments and veggies so that it would accent my burger, but not take away from the actual meaty taste. And was it meaty!

I wish I had a better camera as the mood lighting was a bit low for my iPhone. But this was how meat was suppose to taste and look. Beefy. Not dry, not too runny, not burning hot. Just the right beefy texture like good organic farm raised chuck was suppose to taste like. Finally a burger that tasted just as good as it looked!  I won't go into the fries, good as they were, they didn't stand out, but my friend's panko breaded onion rings did!

Large pieces of panko style breaded onion rings, with a side of chiptle mayo. I suspect they used an egg white mixture for the batter as the onion rings stayed crisp and light and not heavy at all. What I loved about them was even through the meal, they kept their crispy consistency as they got colder! Amazing!"}
{"text":"The worst burger I have ever eaten (as far as I can remember).  It was burnt ALL the way through.  The fries were also way way WAY too salty as well.  With all the burger options in this city, I just don't see why anybody would want to come here.  I definitely won't be."}
{"text":"W Burger Bar is an upscale diner of sorts, with a pretty good menu, and plenty of flat-screen TVs to catch a game or two. The place is a little loud, but not overly so. The service was fine - we had to wave our hands for a while before we caught our server's attention! 

We tried the veggie burgers w/ fries and they were good. Not great, not bad, but good. Ours was a little cold, but it tasted fine nonetheless. There are several condiments that you can add onto your burger, but beware, the price keeps adding up! I might go back just to give them another chance.."}

{"text":"I love going to Burger Bar on the weekend for their $2 shots! Their burgers are also amazing! And I love the amount of choice you have, from the type of meat to the LONG list of toppings.

I have ordered delivery from them and had a whole pack of burnt up shriveled fries as part of my order and my burger certainly did not taste as good as it did in the restaurant. But who knows what happened there...

This is a great place to go with your friends and have some drinks and meat while watching a game!"}
{"text":"One of my girl friends brought me to this place and wow, I was blown away with their prices! Totally affordable; $10 pitchers and $2.50 shots! 

The crowd seems to be mostly college/university students. It has a dim atmosphere and also a outdoor patio. Just be careful when your're walking inside because the floors seems to be slippery as if there was greese on them. 

Wonderful and attentive servers. Overall, it's a comfortable place to be in except that you'd have to yell at each other to converse."}
{"text":"This place probably opened up during the Toronto burger craze. I dismissed it at first, thinking it was just a Hero Burger doppelganger.  However, my low expectations were exceeded and then some. 

Their signature pure beef burger starts at $6.99. I was actually impressed by the quality given how cheap it was. I've had far worst burgers for far more. They have lots of complementary toppings and sauces to choose from. Cheese is extra, of course. The 50/50 fries are a brilliant idea! 

Unlike its evil Republican twin, this place has booze and lots of it. Who's the Hero now?! There's booze in milkshakes and there's booze in fishbowls! The spiked milkshake was really delicious and potent. The fishbowl drinks looked like a lot of fun. 

The female wait staff is cute, chirpy and come around often (albiet service is understandably slow when they're packed). If you're the macho chauvinist type (I'm not one!), this will be the closest you'll get to heaven. Juicy beef and cold beer served by cute waitresses wearing skimpy clothes and hockey playing on flatscreens all-around, how does that sound you fat pig?       

This place is unassuming and serves pretty good food. I can but will not find flaws with W, as I'm quite taken by their approach to doing really simple things right. I'm not saying they make the best burger, just decent ones at a good price."}
{"text":"I am not a giant fan of burgers but I thought my kobe beef burger tasted amazing... too bad it was almost $25 with toppings and no side! 

My waitress was a bit stiff... she seemed to be uncomfortable and a tad robotic.

That being said I liked what I got and since I wasn't paying I think this place deserves 4 stars. Next time I am totally gonna try their spiked milkshakes!"}
{"text":"I have yet to try their burgers but my friend and I split the fish and chips with a side of poutine. The fish was perfectly fried but I found the batter to be a bit thick. The tarter sauce was quite good and the coleslaw was different from traditional coleslaw, not just cabbage and creamy mayo, but vinegary and crunchy goodness. The poutine was great too, but quickly became soggy since the fries are super thin. Will be back to try the pulled pork poutine."}
{"text":"Cane here with a Groupon and it was alright, but not worth it for full price.
The burgers were average but the deep fried pickles were the star."}
{"text":"This place is super cute!  A bit expensive for a burger joint but the burgers are pretty delicious!  Poutine was great, sweet potato fries were good. I would go back!"}
{"text":"This place is not worth the space it occupies. #DISGUSTING

Dropped in a few months ago to grab a burger and a drink with a friend. The location was ideal as I had an evening class to attend at UofT St George campus so I wanted to stay on the college streetcar line. 

We were barely served. The staff was too busy flirting with one another and commenting on a game to notice us. We were clear from the beginning that we only had 45 minutes to eat and they assured us everything would be out in 20. It wasn't out in 40! They served us dried crusty carrots and a ranch dressing that had gone off while we waited, and forgot about our drinks until reminded.

Then the burgers arrived and they too were dis-gus-ting. For a place with 'burger' in the title- I mean seriously! The waiter grew attitudinal and even less available and we basically (over)paid at the front and left before the bill materialized.

I will never forget the terrible experience I had at this place. If I could give it 0 stars I would because nothing left us satisfied."}
{"text":"I got mahimahi, bf got veggie.  We both got experimental with the toppings (which escape me now) but the concept was enjoyable and our cavalier topping choices paid off well as we both really enjoyed the food--some shared onion rings and cheap-as-eff beer ensured we left bloated with satisfaction.

The ambience and service aren't great, but I don't get the impression that this place is really trying to make an impression if you feel me."}
{"text":"Really liked this place! I went today and got a chicken burger. My friend got the kobe burger because it was around half the price. Both were delicious. We also ordered the French fries and they also tasted good. Everything tasted really fresh, none of it tasted deep fried or greasy. The only problem was my glass of water was disgusting. There was left over food all over the glass. It was such a turn off but the food was great."}
{"text":"I took the classic burger with Swiss cheese. It tasted alright but was on the dry side. I could do better at home. 
The fries were cut thinly not my favourite kind. The service was good within the range of what you would expect us a customer. 

The washroom was cold and the water was so cold there, even the blow dry machine was blowing cold air! 
I would classify the burger experience as mediocre/ maybe average. 

When you pay with your card you have the option of paying a tip of 18% or more! No less. I think I won't be back. I've tasted much better."}
{"text":"W Burger Bar is a modern establishment on Yonge and College offers a variety of burgers, alcohol, and other bar items. A couple of weeks back, my friends and I decided to go for drinks after an early dinner at Grill Time. We decided upon seeing W Burger Bar as the weather got colder, and we didn't want to walk any longer. The modern establishment on Yonge and College offers a variety of burgers, alcohol, and other bar items.

While the others opted for alcoholic beverages (pic omitted but they got beer and cocktails); I decided to just get the strawberry milkshake ($4.99). The frothy milkshake was made perfectly, and you can really taste the strawberry flavor of the ice-cream used. For those who love alcohol with their milkshakes, you can get the alternative version which is their spiked milkshakes with 2 ounces of alcohol. 

They offer a selection of 10 different burgers priced between $6.99 to $18.99. Every burger is served on a freshly baked homemade regular or whole wheat bun. They also have a variety of complimentary sauces and toppings. However, cheese is extra for $1.50 per slice.

My friend ordered the bison burger (farm-raised bison seared on our flat top to seal in flavor and tenderness) ($10.99), and liked it. According to him, the burger meat was solid, and the onions caramelized into the meat making it a tasty burger. 

One of my friends and I decided to share the WBB signature sauce chicken wings (double dusted and fried to perfection) ($10.99/lb). I love the wings, and unfortunately these wings are one of the worst wings that I have ever tasted. The wings were of a good size, but the sauce made them so overly bitter and salty at the same time. I really had a hard time eating them, and downing them down with milkshake didn't help with the bitter aftertaste."}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday night with some friends, they were accommodating with groups. I got the turkey burger on a whole wheat bun, it was ok. The potato skins and onion rings were really good though. 

The restaurant itself is in a tight space, very little room to move around. The restaurant is also very loud, it makes it difficult to talk to people beside you. 

I would go back for the apps and to try out more burgers!"}
{"text":"Food is truly a hit or miss. Sometimes the beef is juicy and delicious. Sometimes it's dry and awful. The poutine is delicious though. Prices are average. Waitresses are easy on the eyes but not too useful."}
{"text":"I've been to the burger bar twice so far on College street , the shooters are a reasonable price so we decided to go for it . WRONG CHOICE, we received extremely poor service , there was a fly floating in my shot. The manager handled it very poorly and unprofessionally , once he had taken away the shooter from our table he continued to serve others instead of handling the situation right away, which should be done as a part of great customer service . On top of that we had to call the manager over to find out what was happening with our shot , the manager did not even communicate or let us know that a new shot was being brought to us until asked. We waited 15 min for a new shot and our finished plates were left in front of us as well . overall the manager and the staff need to work on their customer service skills and treatment of their customers"}
{"text":"Got the chicken burger with fries and the chicken burger tasted good! The fries, not so much. The fries were super oily and did not taste good at all! It literally felt and tasted like there was oil at the bottom of the dish and the fries were drenching in them. The service was okay, the waitress came by a few times to see if we were okay, but we sat at the far back, so it was hard to get her attention."}
{"text":"I'm a fan. It's on a quieter side street. The inside is pretty big and on Friday night was full and loud. The patio was chill and quieter and we got good fast service on the patio. The burgers are basically all build your own. You pick your protein and bun (including lettuce bun) and then add toppings. There is a big list of free toppings an sauces and only a few toppings in the $2-3 range. The sweet potato fries are also good an the bowl was large ($3.99) - they came with a not so spicy Chipotle Mayo. Our waitress was really really nice and friendly and had that \"I genuinely care that you are having a good time\" attitude. I'd go back for sure."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for good burger-and-fry combos, and this place certainly delivers. Great tasting food, friendly and helpful service, and a fun atmosphere all make for a very pleasing eating experience. Highly recommended!

P.S. They've got those great, thin, crispy fries that I love!"}
{"text":"Cheap drinks and great service! Can't complain here. I came here with a total of 6 people on a Friday night. I was told that it gets really busy here especially on a Friday night, so I made reservations ahead of time. We reserved for 7pm and we had a few late comers by 730 (there was a snow storm that day LOL). It didn't get busy till around 8-830pm. 

As for food, it was mediocre. I ordered the fish tacos, angus beef hot dog, and a bison burger for 2 people. The fish tacos came in 3 pieces, really small and was alright - the fish pieces were really small in size and costs $12. Other places are bigger and tastes better for that price.
The hot dog was just a hot dog. I didn't try the bison burger, my boyfriend ordered because he's never bison before. He was really excited for this one but wasn't feeling it after 2 bites. Maybe it's just the meat? Has to be grilled a certain way for it to stay moist and tender? He said it was really dry and bland. They have so many other things that I wouldn't mind trying if I came back again, but def won't order any of the 3 we picked. 

Food 2.5
Service 4.5"}
{"text":"I was here twice within 24 hours, both times chosen by friends.

The first, for the Decemburger grand finale. At 7pm on a Friday the place was slammed with customers but even without a reservation (yes, you can make reservations here) I didn't have to wait long. I got veggies and dip as I mulled over what to order, and decided on the salmon burger with goat cheese and avocado. Our experience was decent but the burger not really memorable. The fries and sweet potato fries both remained virtually untouched, which is somewhat telling as I am a french fry FIEND. Needs improvement, although the next day when I returned, some repeat customers raved that the fries had improved since day one, so it looks like they're on their way to perfecting the process.

The second, for Vivek S's surprise birthday party the next day, was nearly flawless. Our server, Marianne, was efficient and warm towards our colossal group of rabblerousers (and I needn't mention that she was also gorgeous). There were at least thirty of us monopolizing the entire back area of the restaurant and she and her stone-faced co-server (who I'm sure would be pretty if she would crack a smile once in a while?) handled our orders like champs. Food came out swiftly and no one was left waiting while the others ate - I was really impressed with how this was handled. Drinks also came quickly and without any flagging down.

My grilled cheese with egg and tomato.

GET IT. 

The fluffy sourdough bread was lightly toasted the way I like it, and the cheese within oozed out and complemented the fried egg and tomatoes nicely. This is seriously one of my new favourite flavour combinations and I would come back anytime to order this sandwich. 

Here's what sealed the deal: at the end of the night when we went to wrap it up, we received separate bills without any fuss or even having to ask. Phenomenal. 

Other than the french fries and some of the tables near the front being too close together/in the way, W Burger has got it goin' on. It's consistently busy with good reason: cheap drinks, good food and a boisterous atmosphere. The bathrooms are also very clean and well appointed. 

TIP: Don't come here for a date on a Friday or Saturday night (it's very noisy), but any other time would be perfectly fine. And remember: they take reservations!"}
{"text":"I'm a bit split on the W Burger Bar, and I ascribe most of that to my decision to get takeout - but more on that later.

Walking in, this is quite a nice place. Clean design, TVs, music playing - very nice indeed. Staff is incredibly friendly, and as you sit down with a menu - even if just to order takeout - veggies and dip are served. Sweet.

The gourmet burger shop is a new experience for me, so I'm not used to variety - beef AND bison? Kobe beef? THREE kinds of Poutine??! What luxury! I went with the Bison burger for my friend and I, with a 50/50 order of fries and a Quebecoise poutine, all for takeout.

This is where the story falls apart.

It's a bit of a distance heading back to my friend's place (Spadina and Bremner / Fort York), and sadly the fries and poutine really didn't make it. I mean, the box made it there, but the soul was gone. Mushy, lukewarm and not overly tasty at that point. Burgers were very tasty, though.

I think the key takeaway here is, uh, don't do takeaway - at least not for longish distances, and *certainly* not with potato-based sides. Disappointment will surely ensue. Having said that, I will be coming back at some point in the near future, and I will be eating in the lovely restaurant this time to give 'em a fair shake. The burger definitely left an impression on me."}
{"text":"Overall, the burger was pretty good. But I fear that if I eat here too often, I'll die sooner!
My burger was a little overcooked, but I really loved the complimentary condiments that W Burger Bar offered. The patty was a little bland, and could've used a little more seasoning.
On the other hand, the thick-cut onion rings really blew my mind off. They were sooo delicious! I totally neglected the fries after tasting the onion rings!"}
{"text":"At the W Burger Bar, they have a ton of toppings available with a lot of custom ones that you'll probably not find anyway else (ex., cranberries, cucumber wasabi, garlic herb mayo, mint jelly, etc). My burger was dressed with mixed greens, tomatoes, pickles, red onions, ketchup and chipotle mayo. And my first bite, simply amazing. It was juicy and gave me the impression I might have picked the right combination of toppings. But with so many toppings on their menu, you can't help but want to come back to give it a round 2, or maybe even 3, 4 or 5. As we continued to munch through our dinner, that slowly changed. The fries did indeed become soggy and the oil now overwhelmed the fries. And after our first couple of bites, the burger has changed quite a bit. It has become kinda dry and started to lose its flavour fast. Maybe it was an off night or maybe it was just my burger. Starting off strong is great, but you have to end strong as well.

{"text":"I went here for lunch not too long ago.  The food was great.  This is the cheapest place in the city to get a pint of beer as well -- anyone who says Pabst is garbage doesn't know what they're talking about.  However, the wait staff was slow and inexperienced.  Along with waiting forever to receive my order, the waitress forgot my order of beer and took her sweet time bringing over the bill at the end of my meal.  I would have given this establishment another star if the waitresses were more competent."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT service. Why? 
- Reserved a seat for 5, there were only two of us for about an hour or so and the servers didn't bitch us out for taking up seats when there was a line out the door.
- Sign-up for their newsletter and you get a free (7oz.) burger
- The place was packed but there was no attitude or slowness in the service
- Drunk friend was loud and boisterous towards the end of the night and knocking over drinks, they laughed it off and cleaned the mess with a smile
- Gave separate bills and we didn't even have to ask
- Takes reservations

GOOD food. Why?
- Massive onion rings with nice crispy panko breading
- Fries were ok
- Burger was a bit over cooked this time around but only because (asked the waitress) there was a group of 20, so the cooks tossed on lot of burgers on the grill. Upside - there was not wait for our food! I've had their burger before and it's really good. Thick and juicy. Burger looks tiny but once you're through with it, you are full.
- Daily specials

CHEAP drinks. Why?
- $10 PBR pitchers
- $2-3 shots
- daily specials
nuff said.

Recommended. 
Just make a reservation!"}
{"text":"I have never come across a burger this good in Vancouver.  It's worth flying just to eat one.  You should try the breakfast burger (but not actually for breakfast, it's too much)."}
{"text":"Ok tried the kobe beef burger again this time I know better than to get the \"defaults\".  Anyway on Wednesdays they have their Kobe Beef Burger at $9.99 which is a lot more palatable on the wallet than their regular price.

So I had it with the garlic herb mayonnaise and tomatoes as the toppings on whole wheat bread to keep things simple.

This time around it is way better just because there were not as much things to hide the flavour and texture of the meat.

Taste wise, it is more fragrant than a regular burger, it's almost like eating minced marbleized steak that is pan fried.  Though I kind of wish they didn't have any cartilage so a bit lot lack of quality control with the meat, but overall the taste was good.  The mayonnaise and tomatoes I chose did bring up the meat taste better.   If you can tolerate spices, I think you should try with the chipotle mayonnaise instead of what I got.

I would still go again, but very rare as the price is a bit high."}
{"text":"Yeah for $2.50 shooters! 

My friend and I came here on a Monday night. To be honest, I thought this place was closed as we were literally the only customers when we walked in! The ratio between customers and workers were probably 1:5.. but, this means very attentive and fast service, which was amazing! 

My friend and I ordered, the mini pitcher to share, 2 blue balls ;), and 2 pink lemonade. For food, we ordered the calamari, 1/2 sweet potato 1/2 reg potato fries, and the sampler sliders. Yumyum. Can't go wrong with the drinks! 
As per the food, I would recommend chowing down on everything as it comes out as it did get cold very quickly! 

Will be back for more! Who can say no to cheap drinks.. especially in downtown!!"}
{"text":"W Burger Bar is a hit if you're hungry, not poor and in the Yonge vicinity. It is far superior than heading to chain city at Yonge and Dundas, plus they have cheap beer. That's right folks, cheap beer and fancy burgers. Hard to go wrong. 

How cheap is the beer? 20 ounce PBR for $4.50. That's dive bar prices in the heart of downtown. Unlike most high-end burger joints, W Burg Bar gets you with the food, not the drink. 

The lamburger is $10 before a side and without any fancy toppings added. Some topping are free, but they charge for cheese, and things like avocado will run you an extra $2.50. Careful, friends, this can add up. 

They have plenty of side options including various poutines and sweet potato fries. I had the panko crusted onion rings, and I will have them again whence I return. Love me some flaky rings. 

PEPPER POINTS: For the cheap beer, obvi, and they have boozy milkshakes. Drink up!"}
{"text":"Why doesn't yelp have half stars?
Now i have to round up. #sheesh

I liked this place. the owner chatted with Wendy and I for like 5 minutes. It was great. The guy believes in bringing Home back into Burgers.
All meats used are farm raised, natural raised meats. Veggie burgers are made in house by the veggie chef.
AND, they bake their own buns daily [so if you do take out, they may get soggy.. as no preservatives et al in them, so.... yeah]

The guy is about Fresh and Real Food.

The milkshakes were AH-MAZING.

Just be prepared to get a burger baby, and be filllllled up afterwards.

The Onion Rings are a MASSIVE portion, way more than one person can handle, and the Burgers are MASSIVE [expensive too...] but they are good. Just be prepared that it is a filling meal. So don't order more.

Infact, you would be doing yourself a favour to order less. However the more you order the better, as they place gives money to SickKids from every sale... nice touch.

Waitress was super friendly, fast, and they wear pink tops with grey skirts!

I recommend the place. It's not anything fancy, but a good place to try and have a burger.
[they failed on their fries tho... nothing special whatsoever].

Round Up.
Passbyable - but nice touches based on ingredient selection.
Quick, friendly, delicious.
Modern, and clean washrooms."}
{"text":"Just like my rating, this place is \"A-OK\"

Beer is cheap but I am not a fan of the layout and the food was meh."}
{"text":"Burger was good, though a bit over cooked. Poutine was delicious, though I've never had it before, so I don't know how it compares. The Polar Bear \"spiked\" shake was very tasty, and the right amount of alcohol. The place was about par price-wise, based on the other places we went to in Toronto"}
