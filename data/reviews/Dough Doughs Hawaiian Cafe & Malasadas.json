{"text":"Very solid loco moco and the malasadas were off the hook. Nice little spot and inside of the Gamblers General Store."}
{"text":"So so good deserves more recognition. Malasadas were delicious and the the loco moco was great!!"}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of Loco Mocos and by far, this is the best one! Everybody was amazingly nice especially the owner. Strongly recommended to try this joint! Malasadas were so good too!"}
{"text":"Edit: Returned 2 weeks later and restaurant is now open but still working out their kinks in regards to menu items. Staff very friendly. \"Mini\" malasadas are huge, so I can only imagine what their normal size is. Parking is interesting due to construction on main street

 Excited for a place that serves malasadas, however, made the trek out to downtown to find out the restaurant was closed to \"equipment issues.\" It's a little concerning when a new restaurant has equipment issues"}
{"text":"This restaurant is pure Aloha. The food is great, fresh, and you can tell that it is made with love. The owner Tania even offered a free desert while I was there. It was delicious. If you are looking for a hidden gem off the strip in Vegas then this place is for you."}
{"text":"I got The Pete Burger  and added a fried egg with fries  and Malasadas. The burger was huge with the pork on top and tasted great. The mix of flavors paired really well with one another. The fries where nice and crisp and they top it with a nice seasoning blend. The Malasadas where rolled out fresh and served hot with the dipping sauce. Great desserts to end the meal. I will be back to try more."}
{"text":"Malasadas are really good. Owner is extremely friendly, place is clean, and food is reasonably priced and very good. Place is good for kids - very welcoming."}
{"text":"Yelp showed me this location for Hawaiian foods and what caught my eyes were MALASADAS!  It was walking distance from my work and I was excited to trek there on my lunch hour.  Hours of operation said they closed at 2pm which gave me well enough time to get there.  I got there shortly after 1:05PM and the door was locked.  There were no signs as to why they were closed before 2pm.  

This joint is connected to a gambling shop so I walked around to the other entrance to see what was up with this restaurant.  Everything looked in tack when I approached the restaurant part of the shop, but no one was there.  I asked the people in the gambling shop what was up with this Hawaiian business and they had no clue.  The gal couldn't even tell me if this Hawaiian place was even open on a daily.  

So I'm pretty disappointed with the place not being open as it states on Yelp.  So I can't say if this business is even in business."}
{"text":"Really disappointed to have made the drive out from the strip to find the place closed (especially after driving around the block three times to even get into the parking lot because of the road work) on a Friday at 10:30am. Mahalo for nothing."}
{"text":"I heard about this place and wanted to try their malasadas but we went there 11am on a Monday and it was deserted. I asked storeclerk if the restaurant was still in business and he did not know. He hasn't seen anyone there since January so one can assume its permanently closed."}
{"text":"Came here to try out their food. However, it's closed. Road construction in the area makes it really difficult to get to. I tried calling their number before coming down here. It would have been great if their voicemail said that it was closed due to whatever."}
