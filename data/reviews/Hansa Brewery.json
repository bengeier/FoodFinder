{"text":"My husband and I went Hansa Brewery last night for drinks and we loved it! The service was great and we could tell that the staff works well together. Nick helped us at the bar most of the night and, when he was busy with other customers, Paul was there to make sure we didn't need anything. Definitely a great place to have a nice beer if you're beer people like we are (and at 5 bucks a beer it made it that much better). I also had an apple cider mimosa (or two) and it was delicious! Overall we were extremely pleased! Congratulations to management for putting together such a great team. This is a great addition to Ohio City."}
{"text":"This brewery is awesome. The owner pours the beers and the atmosphere is great! This place is worth the stroll from the market, way better then the other breweries in the area. Not to mention the food! Give it a try!!! You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"First I'd like to say that the brewery has only been open a few weeks so some of the other reveiws are probably a bit harsh considering every new restaurant or pub has a few kinks to work out in the very beginning. With that said, I went here on opening night for dinner with my husband, once by myself for a quick appetizer at the bar and again for dinner with some friends. Opening night I had the grill and the apple strudel, both delicious...it was packed but our food came out hot and in a timely manner. Our server, Danny was great and Nick the bartender is the best! 
On my second time back I sat at the bar and had the pleasure of having Nick serve me again. I had an appt and only had a small time window to grab something to eat. He put a rush on my food and the chef had it out to me in 10 minutes!
On my third visit I sat on the patio with 2 friends. It happened to be the same day they were premiering their Oktoberfest beer...lucky us! We had a older brunette server that suggested we try it and we weren't disappointed. She was personable and the service was great yet again! 
You'd never know they have only been open a few weeks. The place is beautiful inside and out and you can tell some serious love went into everything. The owners are super friendly and are always around which is cool. The food/beer is good(especially the Potato Pancakes, those addictive Cevapici's, the Oktoberfest & the Dopplebock) and crazy reasonable. Next up for me on visit 4 will be the schnitzel!"}
{"text":"This place is has a wide range of German products at affordable prices. They have German bread, cheese, and cookies. There is a huge chocolate selection and a small deli. They also have TONS of great beer. The people that work there are super friendly. Apparently they are opening a German restaurant and brewery later this summer. I can't wait to try it!"}
{"text":"This is a review based on the brewery and not the store when we visited this evening 9/24/2016. We entered the brewery and waited to be seated for in total 29 minutes in that time we were ignored twice by the hostess who spoke to two people behind us in line without acknowledging myself and my wife. She did not have the courtesy to say 'hello' or even 'I'll be with you soon' she said to us 'there is no seats outside' when I politely asked why there was none outside when the two people behind us in line had been seated outside she responded 'no' and ignored my follow up question to begin speaking to the next person in line. I have never experienced such bad service from a hostess and hope that the business looks into this matter as we will not be visiting this brewery again due to such bad customer service"}
{"text":"The Best Potato Pancakes In Cleveland? Maybe, maybe. You can make that argument. Thick, crispy, they stand out in a town that has many great choices. The rest of Hansa Brewery is excellent as well. 

Owner Boris runs a classy joint. We had reservations for a large group on a Friday night and he kept everything running smoothly. Great service. Among the dishes our group enjoyed most were the schnitzel, which is also among the best in town. The charcuterie plate was very good, and the cevapcici burger was an interesting choice. A couple of us ordered salads and they came out fresh as you'd hope. 

The beer selections were dizzying, and each was as good as the last. This is a fine addition to the list of great Cleveland spots that specialize in German/European cuisine. We'll be going back."}
{"text":"Friends and I stopped in after visiting several downtown restaurants for some cold brews here.
The beer selection is very good and a nice change from an average bar with run of the mill beers.
Tried several different beers and was not disappointed although the bartender could have had a better attitude towards customers."}
{"text":"The beer is pretty good. We got a flight and regular beer so we were able to try a variety. Wasn't disappointed with anything. Give it only 3 stars because the service wasn't great. We waited to get menus for a while and after we finally were able to order and got our beer the server never came back. We would have kept drinking and wanted food but didn't want to wait any longer. It wasn't busy enough to have to wait like we did. Everyone around us also had to wait a while for everything. The table next to us even had to order again. We sat on the patio with our baby and was excited to see no one was smoking outside (maybe it was just a non smoking crowd?) but anyhow, it was disheartening when the server or the cook or someone was smoking on the patio right next to us. I'm not too picky but when service is so slow, I don't want to see someone lighting up on a break. 
I want to say I'd come back but I'm not sure I will because of the lack of service and having to wait like 30 minutes for a beer."}
{"text":"A little piece of home in the middle of Cleveland. 
I love this place!

Lebkuchen from my hometown of Nuernberg, german magazines, specialty cheeses ( like Limburger! ) as well as Quark, rosehip jam...the list goes on.

This place is within walking distance of the West Side Market, so we can kill two birds with one stone every time we visit."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant and brewery in Ohio City. The beer is very good, particularly the \"German IPA.\" Food is very good as well .  Loved the sausage platter. Prices very reasonable. Part of the revitalization of downtown. It's great!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food and service. We came for my boyfriend's birthday and when Boris, the owner, discovered we were celebrating he personally greeted us. Excellent time."}
{"text":"I have been to the brewery twice since it opened a few week ago.  I love it.  I was told by the bartender that it was \"3 years in the making\"....you can tell.  They have paid attention to every detail.  The food and beer are excellent. The staff is very friendly.  On our second visit we met the owner, Boris. This is exactly what the Ohio City area needs.....a great, family-run restaraunt/brewery that really cares about the product and service they provide.  It's a nice change from the other brewpubs in the area."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly service, and a slate of well-done German style craft brews. Plus a fantastic German grocery store right next door."}
{"text":"Great beers. Flight prices are stellar for happy hour (4-6pm).   Soft pretzel app was great. Loved it."}
{"text":"We so wanted this new restaurant and brew house to be great , as we have been fans of the store and owner for years . But unfortunately on our first visit on a slow Saturday the food totally fell flat, we had ordered a schnitzel to split between us , it came finally  but was hardly worth the wait , it was dry and flavorless. You would think a German restaurant could at least get a schnitzel right. Don't know if we will go back to the restaurant again but will hope they start to get it right."}
{"text":"I enjoy Hansa.  Great beer selection.  The place is open and there is space to move around.  Lots of stalls in the restroom.  Boris is always scuttering about to make sure his guests have been taken care of."}
{"text":"We really enjoy Hansa. The food is great as are most of the beers. I really like the Christmas Ale this year though be prepared, at over 15% you won't drink too many. There are plenty of selections to please any palate. 

As for the food, the schnitzel is great and I really like the cevapici. Whatever they are doing, I hope they keep it up."}
{"text":"I'm disappointed in the food at this place. They have a very limited menu which is great. So why not do it well and do it in house? The first few times I came for lunch the Schnitzel was pan fried and was great. Then I came again and I could tell they deep fried the Schnitzel because it was curled and crusty. The bartender told me the chef quit and it was a new chef and he is doing things differently. I decided to give the place another try last week and asked the bartender if they could pan fry it for me. He said no, and said they never have pan fried them. He was lying! (Same bartender every time). I can see deep frying Schnitzel at the Oktoberfest because of the high volume but not a restaurant! Apparently they are content taking shortcuts! I didn't give in. I said I wont order dinner then! I did however order the pretzels. What a mistake that was! They tasted like they came pre made (Sysco)! Don't restaurants make anything in house anymore? Why would I even want to go out to dinner if Sysco is going to make everything? By the way, even their spaetzel came from a box! And the potato pancakes looked like they came from Sysco as well! 
I must say their beer is good though. There are too many good places in the neighborhood for me to eat here again."}
{"text":"Great place laid back atmosphere. Very nice people, great service. It's a European style Brewery and food . If your looking for super hoppy beers and overly trendy staff and food probably not for you. If you like good beer and food and nice servers with a nice comfortable laid back atmosphere it's the right place for you ."}
{"text":"First, the staff was amazing. The beer was pretty good too.  Now for the food we ordered. We ordered the grill platter with raznici, cevapcici, potato salad and vegetables. First of all raznici is like city chicken NOT a piece of pork on a stick. Your cevapcici are rubbery and pan fried. Definitely the wrong meat used for this and they are NOT supposed to be that peppery.  Sweet Jesus. Your potato salad is missing the last 1/4 cup of mustard left in your jar. There are too many ethnic that live in this area and would be embarrassed to bring fellow Croatians,  Slovenians, etc to eat what I just ate. You should have researched your area before serving what was served."}
{"text":"Forget about all the other Cleveland breweries: Hansa wins hands down! Customer service is amazing here, and the owner Boris goes above and beyond to please his patrons. Waitstaff and bartenders are equally amazing. When ordering food, stick to the traditional meals like Schnitzel or pork roast. The burger/more American food isn't as good."}
{"text":"I went to Hansa yesterday (Friday) as my first stop checking out some of Cleveland's breweries. I visited with 5 friends, and we were all greeted immediately. I sat at the bar and ordered a soft pretzel with German IPA Sauce and Lowensenf Mustard and a flight of 4 beers. The beers I ordered were: Bye Felecia ( English brown ale), Femdom (Kolsch), B.S. German IPA , and the Wit Wit (witbier). The pretzel was delicious and I enjoyed each of the beers. I really enjoy Hefeweizen beers so I ordered a liter of the J.U.G Weiss bier which had a hint of banana and was very refreshing. The owners came over to see how everything was and they were very friendly. We also met some of the brewers that worked there. It's a family owned business and you can tell that they take pride in what they do! We will definelty stop back next time we go to Cleveland."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Hansa today.  It was my first trip there and I was definitely impressed.  My coworker and I both had the lunch special... which included beef noodle soup, side salad, turkey cordon bleu, and German style potato salad for $13.50.  All food was perfect and in large portions.  I sampled a couple of the beers (even though I was on my lunch break from work).  The beer samples were also very good.  I am going to step out on a limb and say this was the best restaurant experience I have had in months.  I will be coming back for dinner and full beers soon! 

GW"}
{"text":"Stopped by for the game- was relatively uncrowded so we were able to sit down. I had a beer sampler which I thought there was a good variety of beer in what they gave me. Everything was good.

We had the pretzels as we just wanted a snack. The pretzels were good but nothing special. Others in the group got the burger and the potato pancakes which they enjoyed.

I heard they may getting a rooftop patio later in the summer..."}
{"text":"Horrible horrible place! Ate here on Saturday and it just seemed like no one had any idea what was going on. Everyone's plates came out at separate times, and the food was not at all what I was expecting.  To add insult to injury when I went to use the restroom I heard a man screaming obscenities in what I believe was the kitchen, so unprofessional.   Do not waste your money at this establishment, you'll be throwing your money right out the window."}
{"text":"Check out the nice patio. Great to people-watch while having a award winning brew (& they have a few here) I like them all. (get a pretzel to add you'll luv the mustards offered)
Food here is to die for. That's what pushed me over the edge to the 5 star. (have eaten here a few times and now decided to write the review.) Only Mom cooks it as good.(did I mention the crispy fresh apple strudel?)
The neighborhood is ok here ! (and you come to the brewery-district for a reason) you are not going to find an easier place to park \" in the later day\" with some choice  public friendly spots around. The neighborhood has turned around at this end I would say. See the other positive reviews, good reads. Cheers !"}
{"text":"Hansa Import Haus is a hidden gem in Ohio City.  You would never know it from the exterior, but Hansa has a nice selection of specialty imported German and Austrian foods and grocery items.  When we stopped in a few weeks ago, we were especially surprised to find Swedish rye bread, which they bring in weekly from Canada.  Definitely worth stopping in to check out if you are in the area for the West Side Market."}
{"text":"Terrible atmosphere, super bright and loud. Staff is so unfriendly. Beer was just okay. Great Lakes, Market Garden, and Nano Brew are all right around the corner and so so so much better."}
{"text":"Years in the making, Hansa offers Ohio City diners a relatively unique experience, incorporating traditional German specialties with decidedly Pan-European influences.  The respectable beer selection includes hefeweizens, porters, schwarzbiers and a variety of IPA's, with alcohol percentages conveniently listed for reference.  I chose the Schofferhofer Grapefruit Hefeweizen, which was only 2.5% ABV, but big on fresh, citrus taste. 

The menu includes German favorites like jagerschnitzel and wienerschnitzel, along with Mediterranean dishes including shrimp risotto.  We chose the lamb chop medallions and \"brancin\", an adriatic-style bass, grilled and served atop sautéed spinach.  Our entrees were prepared perfectly and served personably and professionally, which greatly enhanced our dining experience.

The atmosphere was loud, as the main dining room is rather large, with windows on two sides.  Plenty of natural light, to be sure, with a spacious patio for summertime sipping under the stars. The attached store sells a variety of imported foodstuffs and sundries.  

If you are a beer connoisseur, do consider paying a visit to this eclectically, European eatery."}
{"text":"I've been to Germany and Austria a couple of times so when we decided to try Hansa for the first time I definitely had a certain expectation... and it did not disappoint.

Sitting on the patio, which captured the buzz of people walking to or from nearby W. 25th St., we started off with drinks. I'm not into beer so I went with a bourbon smash -- a nice, light drink that captured the bourbon. But Jeannene had a weissbier and enjoyed it plus I know of beer aficionados who have come here and been impressed.

For an appetizer we had the potato pancakes and they were definitely Old World -- three of them, a half-inch thick and crispy on the outside, served with a nice tart chunky apple sauce and a smooth, mild sour cream.

For the main course, what I had been waiting for --the wiener schnitzel. It's possibly the most simple dish in the world, just a piece of pork hammered down so that it's thin and spread out over the plate and then covered with a nice crispy golden-brown breading and topped with a lemon wedge to be squeezed over top. And Hansa nailed it, especially the crispness of the breading. It came with the fluffiest spatzle (you could also get fries or fried potatoes) and a little bit of pickled peppers (arghhh, was really wishing for the traditional red cabbage and apple instead of this very non-German taste).

Jeannene had a similar dish but with a mushroom sauce over the schnitzel and that also tasted top-notch.

Dessert menu looked good -- crepes and strudels -- but we were done for the night. But we will be back."}
{"text":"Rare selection of typically German grocery items includes staples like soup mixes, spices, canned goods, cookies, chocolates and other candy. Their stock of imported German beer varieties and typically German liquor and wine is unmatched! The deli counter also offers a lot of German delights not found anywhere else in the area. A sampling of German toiletries includes name brand soaps, bath oils, hand cremes, lotions and even cologne. Even nostalgic parlour games and old weekly gossip magazines are offered. To anyone looking for reminders of what a German grocery store or drug store offers, this is indeed a treasure chest. One problem I observed repeatedly was that expiration dates are frequently exceeded, groceries that have been stored for a long time are \"expired\" and often no longer enjoyable to eat. Christmas candy is sold well into the new year, a practice that should raise eyebrows even for customers from \"the old country\". Prices range from reasonable to steep. It all depends on how badly a customer wants a piece of Good Old Germany. To pay triple or even quadruple of what the item would cost in Germany can be a difficult decision, or simply a sacrifice well worth it. A visit to Hansa Haus will be a delight to anyone who wants to recreate a the German food experience, simply because in the North East Ohio area there is little chance to ever come as close to the real thing as Hansa Haus! Four stars from this reviewer and regular customer!"}
{"text":"Great time there with friends from Bay Village and my 91 year old dad.  Super food and drink.  Meal was superb.  The owners and staff were tremendous.  Look forward to going back."}
{"text":"The store and the woman working there were neat. There are other shops that sell the same imported goods, but it's still cool. The brewery wasn't that great, our experience was pretty lackluster. Our female bartender was either the most socially awkward person ever or just really hated us lol. The Oktoberfest beer was good, as well as the doppelbock, but the other two we tried were awful (especially the weisserbeir). We probably won't go back to the tavern, but would go to the store."}
{"text":"It was a beautiful Cleveland fall evening when we went to Hansa Brewery so we were able to sit on their expansive patio.  It's in a great part of the city and we enjoyed people watching while on the patio.  My husband and friend ordered the beer tasting and added two beers (for seven total).  They both agreed that it was a good way to try some unusual beers, some of which they liked and some of which they didn't.  The menu is a little limited and since we were on our way to see a play (and sit for two hours!) we were careful what we ordered.  I had potato pancakes and a spinach salad and my husband had more of a meal.  We both enjoyed what we ate but the service was a little disjointed -- orders coming out at separate times, dishes not cleared timely on what was an overcrowded table, water not refilled after repeated requests.  We will certainly be back to give the place another try and to visit the Eastern European food market that is located next door but was closed when we were there."}
{"text":"This place is great! The owner and his wife are super friendly and helpful. It is a great bargain for lunch and they have delicious beers. The patio will be awesome in the warmer weather!"}
{"text":"Hansa Brewery fits in nicely with all of the other Westside Market area list of Breweries and Brew pubs. Hansa has that \"Gemutlich\" feel to the dinning bar area, kinda cozy, comfortable place to have a beer and meal. The staff was attentive and happy to review the beer types and menu options.

The beer selection, all tap beers brewed on site, covered the typical range of German styles with a few twist. The lunch menu was split between German and Slovenian dish, hearty comes to mind. I started with the Pilsner while my mother had the Weiss beer, both well crafted. It was nice when we were given a small sample of the Octoberfest beer that had a malt forward taste. 

I went with the mixed plate and my mother tried the daily special that included veggie soup, salad and a pork loin and Semmel Knodel. The main dish portions were easily dinner sized, looking forward to my leftover tomorrow. We passed on the desert but watch an older couple devour their orders across from us, guess the desert was hitting the spot."}
{"text":"Just came home from a fantastic dinner at Hansa Brewery.  While we did not try any of their locally brewed craft beers, we did have great martinis',  delicious schnitzel, wonderful crepes for deserts, and attentive service.  All very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"The weather warmed up. Time to visit one of my favorite Cleveland Westside restaurants for a couple of beers on their outside deck. 

Good selection of beers. Owners and staff are friendly. Love their food. 

Worth a visit when in Cleveland. On Lorain & W 28th."}
{"text":"Great German bar with friendly service. The no fox is an awesome Pilsner and they have many other great beer selections."}
{"text":"A traditional Central European beer hall with lots of German, and if I observed correctly, Czech, Slovak, and Slovene décor.

Their in-house brews cover a variety of styles, and I enjoyed the Hansanator doppelbock and the Black Flag schwarzbier. They also offer a solid menu of German and central European favorites like freshly baked pretzels, schnitzel, and decidedly meat-heavy dishes. They also offer plenty of familiar third-party brews; the Stiegl radler was a sweet, light way to round things out.

Service is courteous and efficient and, overall, this is a nice venue that literally feels like you're on a trip to Europe."}
{"text":"NOTE: There seem to be quite a few reviews on here for the Hansa Import House, the little ethnic store next door to the brewery/restaurant, so just to be clear, this review is for the latter. Now, let's do this thing.

Yeah, I've got a bit of a thing for certain ethnic comfort food and craft beer. It's in my DNA, so there's no denying it. Anyway, Hansa Brewery, it's almost like it was designed for me, and with a fantastic brewer like Corey Miller at the helm (we did a short stint together at a local homebrew supply shop), how could it possibly go wrong? Well, for the most part, it wasn't the beer that was the issue...

Finally, after what seemed like 20 years, Hansa Brewery was born. Late September 2016 to be more precise. At the time of this review, they still didn't have their patio completed yet, but I'm hopeful that this will be done sometime before 2020.

We stopped in around 5:30ish on a Thursday. Pretty quite and empty. The space is well-lit and open with a beautiful wood-slab bar to the left of the host station, large flatscreens overhead and a few tables. The main dining room with its polished wood floor and  is toward the rear with an awesome view of the brewery's stainless steel tanks. German decor abounds, festive murals on the walls. There's just a nice, warm feeling to the place that I really liked.

When we walked in we saw the \"Please Wait to be Seated Sign\" so that's what we did. The bartender acknowledged us, but we still stood there for a noticeably long time before finally being shown to a table by a hostess.

First, the highlight - the beer. All of the beer is brewed on site and I've gotta say, Corey has outdone himself here. They have 12 total taps, 9 of which are house beers and a flight is only $5. All have a decidedly German spin with a few oddballs like a black IPA and a blackberry porter on nitro thrown in to keep things interesting. They've got weissbier, doppelbock, schwarzbier, and even an IPA brewed with all German hops. For me, the standout was the kettle-soured Lichtenhainer. It was light, gently tart, biscuity, incredibly well-balanced and delicious. If I was rating the brewery only, we're talking 5 stars here. But I'm not, so let's continue.

The menu, as you're probably guessing by now, is basically German food. We're talking schnitzel, sausages, spaetzle, and the like. All things I will eat in volume if given the chance. We decided to start with the German pretzels (of course), spinach salad and charcuterie plate. For my entree I opted for the sausage platter while my wife was content to nibble from all of the aforementioned goodies. Here's where things derailed just a bit.

Why are you serving average pub fries with a German wurst platter? C'mon, man. I shouldn't have to tell you that it's spaetzel and/or potato salad with sauerkraut. Make the fries optional, not the other way around. Next, the pair of soft pretzels were soft, warm and delicious but the tiny cup of beer cheese was way undersized. Our server happily brought us another upon asking - no charge. The spinach salad was, well, a spinach salad - a bed spinach, a sprinkling of red onion, tiny pieces of bacon and some croutons with a sliced hard boiled egg. It did its job like it should.

The charcuterie was pretty good, too. A decent selection of meats and cheeses - two types of salami and some kind of cured ham along with a few gherkins. The cheeses included some kind of soft, washed rind number and a firm, orange-ish one. Looking back on it, I probably should have asked what I was eating, but it was good, I had beer and I didn't care all that much to find out. I thought the crostini they served as the vehicles were a bit uninspired. BTW, wanna know how a charcuterie is done? Head across the street to Great Lakes Brew Pub. Another brights spot has to be the trio of sausages on the sausage platter. They were all delicious. Flavorful, loaded with spices, a perfect natural casing snap to each bite. As far as tubed meats go, they were pretty damn tasty.

The service was good for the most part, just a bit slow. Our server was running her ass off basically taking care of five tables on her own, so I get it. Boris, the owner, eventually stepped in to help out, but during most of our visit the pace was pretty slow. Our server also neglected to explain the items on the charcuterie plate and didn't bring my spaetzel as requested with my entree. She was very friendly and knowledgeable about the beer and even offered to bring me a sample of the sour ale, just in case I was uninitiated in the style.

OK. Others have already mentioned it. Hansa Brewery was just born and they're still a bit wobbly on their baby legs. I get it. They'll need some time to get the details right and settle into a routine. Hell, I'm a forgiving guy, I'm not gonna slap 'em with a two-star review or anything, but the number of basic \"Restaurant 101\" missteps were just too numerous to overlook. I'll revisit and reassess."}
{"text":"So so. I was expecting it to be bigger, like some of the German import shops in Lincoln  Square in Chicago. There was also few gluten-free products. Besides that, there were a good variety of products and I think that for most people without dietary restrictions, it would be just fine. But it didn't really meet my expectations."}
{"text":"We decided to make it one of our stops on our brewery themed date night. The space is big and it offers bistro style seating as well as a long bar when you first walk in. It was a Friday night, so a 45 min wait was expected - we showed up around 8-9 pm.  

One unfortunate thing that I remember is that an older couple were sat at a 6-top table. It just felt like that was poor planning on the hostess's part. 

This is a restaurant/brewery that is very family friendly. Don't confuse that statement with images of little hellions in booster seats and high-chairs... (Thank God, I didn't see anything like that) but everywhere I turned it looked like the parents took their adult kids here for a family night. So, if you're looking for a more raucous German brewery ... try Hofbrauhaus. This is an entirely different atmosphere. 

With that said, service was great. The soft pretzels are delicious. THESE are better than Hofbrauhaus. Hands down. The dipping cheese and mustard is very unique and flavorful. 

Not a lot of beer to choose from. I get spoiled at other bigger breweries in the area. But the catch with Hansa is that it feels special. It's unique and simple and it seems like not a lot of people know about its existence. (I really enjoy these places that stay under the radar.) I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"The brewery was nice enough to open on a Sunday to host a reception for an Singing Angels memorial. The service was excellent, every beer I tried I enjoyed, and the food was fantastic! The big soft pretzels with beer cheese are to die for, the sausage and vegetables were delicious and the potato pancakes were incredible. The applesauce tastes home made. I could eat a huge bowl of just that alone! The patio is also perfectly shaded with plenty of seating. I will definitely be coming back to order off of the real dinner menu on a night they're open to the public!"}
{"text":"i love this place. it's real home cooking. it's like if your grandmother was German and really knew her way around the kitchen. it's the from scratch chicken soup, the delicious sauerkraut (which is not always easy to do unless you're a major lover of the stuff). it's the tender schnitzel, and the perfect spaetzle... to the hand stretched apple strudel and respectable cup of coffee - as well as the beers that are extremely finely brewed... Hansa is a solid choice in cleveland that won't let you down. real food. no frills. SOLID. and i bow down to that."}
{"text":"The latkes were slammin! Yum! Delightful new addition to the neighborhood. Will be back."}
{"text":"Can I say never again. We came in (2:15 pm) on a Sunday near close 3 pm and the bartender Melanie was not friendly or accommodating at all. I ordered the Sunday special.  The salad came with no dressing. I asked for dressing and they ran out of it. The beef soup had hardly any beef and only one matzo ball dumpling. I asked for the strudel to go and they ran out of strudel too! The people next to us mentioned they didn't have their credit card and she couldn't find it. Low and behold she had it. Like I said never qagain."}
{"text":"Great little brewery on the edge of Ohio City.  Sampled several beers and they were great.  Apparently they have recently won several awards for their beers.

We also tried the beef carpaccio, which was amazing and the pretzel that had a great mustard sauce. 

The place has plenty of room, a large patio for people watching and an import store next door.  Will definitely be back for dinner and some more beer."}
{"text":"Tonight is the 1st night of the World Series.  We were planning on going to a place on w. 25th to eat/drink/and watch the game.  We couldn't find parking over by 25th, so we came down and parked near st. Ignatius.  We started walking over to 25th, but saw that this new place finally opened! So we decided to check it out.

Since it's still newer, it wasn't to crowded.  We walked in and they had a couple large tv's behind the bar.   They had a few long tables with good views of tv's.  Then they have another room without tv's(please add one!), we got a table right where you walk in to the other room with a perfect view of bar tv (we were lucky!).   

Our server was pleasant.  The menu is small and simple but good German food with a couple burgers. 

I had their Oktoberfest and it was good and smooth.  
The potato pancakes are delicious!!! The applesauce is delicious!  I asked the server if it was homemade and she said yes.  I got the pork schnitzel with a side of spätzle.  When the plate came and I saw no gravy I thought 'oh no, this is going to be tasteless and dry.'  As most German places I've been to serve it with a gravy(and it usually needs it).   But I was so surprised how moist and flavorful the pork schnitzel was!  The best I've had!  And the spätzle were perfect, a light buttery taste.  My dinner partner and I cleaned our plates!!  I was tempted to get dessert but was stuffed!  I'll have to wait till next time for the homemade apple strudel.  

It was fun watching the Indians play the Cubs there. Cleveland fans are the best!"}
{"text":"Really glad to see this business in Cleveland. Conveniently located across from the Westside Market, it's a great place to grab a meal in a sit-down type of place if you just did all your shopping. 

Unfortunately, I didn't get to try the food but the beer was really solid. We got flights and were impressed by many of the beers. The Oktoberfest was fantastic. It was well balanced, malty, and full of fall spice flavor. The Kolch was crisp and right on par. 

The service was great too. The employees were very gracious and helpful. The owner even came out and chatted with my beer-loving husband, and made him sample something else that they didn't serve. Really great Cleveland hospitality!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable! Good beer and service too. Love the European vibe! Also in such a cute area. Our server was super sweet! Love this brewery!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for import stores and this one was no exception.  I loved the cottage facade outside and inside, a German lover's delight.  Marzipan, beer, nutcrackers, as far as the eye can see!  Prices seemed pretty reasonable.  There was even a deli counter in the middle of the store so you could get some fresh meat and cheese sliced up for you.  I bought some salty fish-shaped licorice - odd, to say the least, if you're not accustomed to it.  And the woman at the counter was friendly, she even complimented my gloves!"}
{"text":"Had a great time talking to Boris (the owner) he is from Slovenia. I tried the Oktoberfest...very nice brew...nice and crisp. The restaurant has an abundance of Pine wood trim , it has a very Bavarian feel!"}
{"text":"Oh HELL yes. My mom was born and raised in Germany, and came over here in the 1960s, when she met my dad, fell in love, yadda yadda yadda, the important thing is that they had an awesome kid: ME. And pretty much every year until I was 16, we would head to her home of Hamburg either in the summer or around Christmas time. Looking back on that time, I was one lucky kid, being able to travel as much as I did.

But back then I hated it most of the time. We had to stay with weird relatives in their weird-smelling houses eating weird food. I probably cried for McDonald's and \"normal American\" food every other day. But after so many times of going to Germany, I did straight-up get hooked on some things you really only can get in Europe. Or so I thought, until I hit up this place.

Kinder Eggs? Check. Bratkarfoffeln mix? (Look it up.) Check. Knorr soup mixes? (The Knorr chicken soup mix really is the best ever.) Check. A torrent of nostalgic feelings washing over me as I walk the aisles of this place? Check. I will definitely be back, if not for the beer selection alone."}
{"text":"Holy hell this store is cool!  Ive worked across from this store for 10 years and just discovered it not too long ago. Im not Gernman but I love buying the Curry Katsup, German cheese and beer.  They have German makeup, soap and all sorts of canned stuff too!  If your looking for Belgian and German beers check this place out.  They also are a travel agent.  Stop in and see these super friendly people!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!!!!!  Seems very authentic. Great German beers, great atmosphere. Seems to have friendly regulars. We had the pretzel and the apple strudel. 2 pretzels and a small beer cheese come in an order. They wet so soft and light. Maybe the best pretzels I've very had, not really dense. The strudel was small but manageable for a dessert or snack and the crust is handmade & soooooo flakey. Love the Ohio City area and Hansa is one of our favorites."}
{"text":"The beers that I tried, JUG Weiss Bier and FemDom Kölsch, were great. We shared a charcuterie plate, which was simple, but nice."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a brewery tour on 6/17 and were pleasantly surprised at this gorgeous spot. Love the outside patio & giant beer barrel  fabulous potato pancakes & pretzels. Beer was"}
{"text":"This was a great low-key option on a night the Cavs had a Finals game and most places were busting at the seams. The J.U.G Hefe was fantastic and the bartenders were very personable. My wife ordered just a water and the bartender made it in a nice cocktail glass with lemons so she didn't feel left out. 

The space is really cool, with high ceilings, great woodwork, classic German decor but still modern. 

The food looked dynamite, but we had already eaten."}
{"text":"I can't add too much to what the other reviewers have shared. It's a great store full of hard-to-find treats from Germany and other parts of Europe. Some wonderful packaged goods, condiments, candies, and many other rarities. The selection of German beer as well as beers from Central and Eastern Europe is incredibly good. The deli counter has a lot of nice and uncommon German meats, but they're generally not as good as the locally made stuff you can get from Old World down the street at the West Side Market. Nice place run by nice people."}
{"text":"I will be the first to admit that I don't eat German food nearly as often as I eat other ethnic foods. So basically all I need is a good beer and some delicious sausage to make me happy. I got so much more than that at the Hansa brewery!! As a party of nine, we tried to begin the night at the big-name big box German beer place. The music was incredibly loud, and after an hour and a half of waiting for our promised table, we got in our cars and drove five minutes west to Hansa. We were greeted by the owner and immediately seated. The owner himself was our waiter for the evening. He shared his story about coming to America, and about opening the restaurant recently. The food was absolutely superb. I got the weinersnitzel with spatzel and carrots. The beer was excellent. It could not have been a better night. The atmosphere was friendly and quiet enough that you could actually have a conversation!

It won't be long until the word gets out in this place becomes crowded. With a beautiful decor on the inside and ample seating on the outside, easy on street parking, and fantastic food; Hansa brewery will be the place to be in the spring and summer of 2017. I can't say enough good things about it. Go there. Now."}
{"text":"Hansa Brewery has a nice restaurant as well as brewery I tasted the core flite of beers, good traditional European beers

My favorite were the Grolsch. And Weiss beers

The group I was with tried three different kind of schnitzel and one tried pork loin and juices All came  with spaetzel and vegetable. I tried the pork schnitzel with mushroom gravy which was excellent

We also tried the deserts which were very good
I tried apricot crepes which were excellent.The bill was also reasonable"}

I've had lunch here twice, have not been for dinner. Great German style beer is brewed here. Not some trendy stuff or pumpkin spice beer. The food is legit. I had the schnitzel twice. The side of spätzle was perfect. The potato pancakes are the best around. Strudel for dessert is real, hand pulled dough, not phyllo, and the filling is not from a can. This place is the real deal.  Can't wait for warm weather when the outside beergarten is open.  Also, it's just far enough from the W25 crowds. Well done Hansa, well done indeed.

Carry on"}
{"text":"I've been to Hansa Brewery twice now and I really like it.  To be honest, I'd like to give it 4 stars for the food, 3 for the atmosphere.  This could be a 5 star place if they were were a little more authentic in the atmosphere and décor.  But, the food is more important when talking about a restaurant so we'll start there.  The food is some of the best authentic German food in Cleveland.  It beats the food at Hofbrauhaus hands down, in my opinion.  The schnitzel is some of the best around.  I had that on my first visit and I actually wanted seconds!  Not because I didn't get a large enough portion (I certainly did!) but because it was that good.  The sausage platter was really good and gave you a great way to try things.  They do have seem to have a different menu for either the bar area or for late night because when were there last weekend it was a pared down menu than the first time we were there.  I don't think they cut things out of the menu, I think we just had a different menu at the bar than in the dining area where we were the first time.  

Now let's talk about the beer - really good!  My husband is in love with the black IPA they have which isn't my style of beer but friends of ours we were with also loved it.  They are all beer lovers so they know what's good.  I loved the heffewiess and the pilsner I had.  It's worth coming here for both the food and the beer.  

Now the atmosphere/décor.  This is where I get lost and I think they are missing the boat.  There is just something not quite right, not quite \"German\" about the place.  Sure, they have German steins on the shelves and pictures of Germany on the walls but there is just something lacking there.  Not sure what it is.  They play pop music which may contribute to why they don't feel like a German restaurant but like I said I can't quite put my finger on what's wrong.  This doesn't mean I won't go back because I certainly will but I wish they had more of the atmosphere that I'm searching for than they do."}
{"text":"Hansa has a very homey environment and feel. You feel relaxed just sitting there. Looking at the beer kegs is interesting. I find it a little funny just watching people tend to them.

The wait service is very kind and welcoming. I don't speak much German but I could still hold a short conversation, which is nice comparing my attempted conversations in other languages at other restaurants.

The environment is great I would go even without the food. Speaking of the food...

The food is wonderful. You want to stay at Hansa for days, just to savor the food.
I had a hackbraten (a German meatloaf) and it was wonderful. It was hard to savor it, but I did try.

I normally don't like to get desert but I couldn't resist. I had an apple strudel and I wolfed it down too. It looked incredible but the taste was even better than its looks.

I loved Hansa. I strongly recommend going for lunch sometime if you're into German food.

P.S. I went to the import shop afterwards and let's just say, they have a lot of really good chocolate ( according to my friends.) 

P.P.S. I don't eat chocolate."}
{"text":"Didn't eat but the beer was great and nice bright atmosphere. Change from the typical dark bar."}
{"text":"We were recommended this place by a friend. We were all very surprised that this place existed. Clean and welcoming diner with authentic German decor. Parking can be found all around the area. There is a German store just next door. 

We came for lunch on this rainy day. Half a pint of Bier and a lunch special for me and the Original Schnitzel for my boyfriend. The lunch special had a carrot soup, salad, and Hackbraten. The Scnitzel came deep fried with a side of mixed vegetables and spætzel. 

There was a lot of food! To the hunger and deliciousness of the food it was gone by the end of our lunch along with our drinks. The house made tiramisu topped off our meal, definitely a must have. 

What made it great was the great service by our waitress. We will be back."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Hansa in my endless effort to try all of Cleveland's fare. We ordered two flights of beer (8 beers total) and pretzels to munch on. Our server was very friendly and our beer and pretzels were served quickly.

We sat at the bar for about 30 minutes watching women's golf while drinking and eating. The beers were tasty. Some were better than others. I love that the beer menus include the IBU because it is a very good indication if I will like a beer or not. I typically can't tolerate anything above 30 IBU, except for beers that taste like Guinness and coffee stouts. I think my favorite beer was the Hansanator Dopplebock. It had a nice color and flavor. The J.U.G. Weissbier was decent also. I didn't really like the blueberry beer as it also had lemon in it that took the flavor in a sour direction that I wasn't fond of. I don't like sauerbeer in general.

It was a nice visit, but overall, we prefer Great Lakes food and beer, which is right across the street. There was no wait at Hansa, but there was a 30-minute wait to be seated at Great Lakes Brewing Co."}
{"text":"Probably the best hefeweizen I've had outside of Europe! Delicious beer and a delightful patio."}
{"text":"3.5 stars for Hansa!

In Ohio City, there's just breweries pretty much everywhere all over the neighborhood- it's nice that we live in the neighborhood, but some days it's just hard to pick which one to go to!

We were curious about Hansa- and as it had just opened, we went. It's definitely very German- connected to the Hansa Imports store and when you walk in- it's German music, German food, German drinks, etc etc. It's actually quite the fun environment- picture, Hofbrauhaus without the loud crazy people but somewhere where you can watch a sports game and hang out. 

I ordered an IPA and it came out in a huge mug (like BIG), and it was only $5. I was a bit surprised at the size- as well, I'm a small girl and that was rather large for cheap as well. He ordered a flight - and we enjoyed it as well. It's good. 

We ordered a pretzel though- can't vouch for the food yet though- it was really really salty. But, since I haven't ordered any of the food (and really can't judge German food well, since well, we're not German), not sure if it's good? There were definitely a lot of people eating though- so I'm assuming it was decent?

It's a nice addition to the Ohio City neighborhood- one of the more laid back places where you can catch a sports game and just catch up with friends- check it out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I am glad we finally got to stop into Hansa! I have been wanting to check it out for awhile now. The inside is much more bigger then I realized when we walked in. It wasn't too crowded for a Thursday night at 6:45. Our waitress as well as another gentleman (maybe the owner?) were both extremely attentive.
To start, we each ordered a flight for $5. (See my photo). I ordered the Blackberry Porter, the Winzig, the Kolsch and the Dopplebock. My favorites were the Porter and the Winzig. The Winzig was almost like a sour and was different for everyone depending on your pallet. The Porter's blackberry taste was very smooth and unique. 
Next the food! We ordered the potato pancakes as an appetizer and they were amazing! Crunchy outside with a delicious tender inside. They were perfect. I was disappointed because they were out of the turkey wings and I was looking forward to trying them. My husband ordered the turkey Schnitzel which came with spaetzel and carrots and I ordered the Ohio city burger. My Ohio city burger had carmelized onions on top that added great flavor. Both entrees were delicious and very decent portion sizes. 
My only complaint was that they were out of turkey wings but I plan on going back anyways so hopefully I can change this into a 5 star :)"}
{"text":"Fantastic Beer, Fantastic Food!

Hansa is an Authentic German restaurant with great craft beer. Its the best kept secret in Ohio city, and I imagine it won't be that way for long!"}
{"text":"Finally! A German find in Cleveland! Schnitzel was awesome and so are the potato pancakes. This is a very nice place- great food, solid beer and clean"}
{"text":"The beer list had a lot of varied options on it. Flights are $8 (4 beers) if you want to try a few. I enjoyed a Polish style smoked beer. The beer was light, but the smoked flavor was definitely present, unique and enjoyable. 

For appetizers the pretzels are great. There are two smaller pretzels in an order that are served with a good light cheese sauce. The potato pancakes are three to an order and served with chunky cinnamon applesauce and a mayo based sauce. The pancakes were thick, not greasy and nicely cooked.

For entrees there were a few specials in addition to the menu. The pork roast was bone-in and cut thick. It was sitting in flavorful, but slightly salty sauce. While the pork wasn't necessarily tender, it was made tender enough from the sauce. Potatoes and mixed veg accompanied the dish. 

The Schnitzel, pork or turkey, was breaded, but the breading was flakey and thin, but slightly salty. Again, the pork wasn't super tender, but it was thin and good enough in this regard. This entrée was served with baby (frozen?) carrots and Spätzle, which wasn't my favorite.

While I may have had better food elsewhere, this was I believe truly family, home made food. This didn't feel like a restaurant, but spending a couple hours in a family home. Furthermore, the owner, Boris, was present behind the bar helping out some, but mostly talking to guests. He had fun historical facts to share and information on the beers and really added to the atmosphere. The décor was also homey. I loved the Europe map on the wall and the LH 747 shot ski on the bar.   

I really enjoyed my first time here. The bar area was full on a Thursday night, but there were plenty of dining room and patio seats open. The space is massive."}
{"text":"Hansa is one of my favorite places to go hangout with friends and have a drink. Unlike most bars located near the West Side Market Hansa rarely gets over crowded. Due to this it is a great place to sit and actually hear someone talk. Outside of the ability to talk Hansa has amazing staff that make you feel like family. After going to the bar twice the bartender remembered my name and knew what I liked to drink. 

Hansa also offers a mug club, which I would suggest joining. They usually open it up during Feburary time. About once a month a new beer comes out and the mug club members get a sample of the beer. Also you get a $1 off every drink you order. And they host special events for mug club members."}
{"text":"Great food and beer! The owner is very nice and showed us around the brewery. Food is very authentic and restaurant and bar are very cozy!"}
