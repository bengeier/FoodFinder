{"text":"I love Poké so I'm pretty biased but I liked this place! The staff was very friendly and offered good suggestions. Price was around $10 for a small. Maybe a little pricey but it was a good size and they did offer unlimited toppings. 
Only complaints are that the decor was very plain, there was no character to the restaurant. The fish was also a little warm (not cold like sashimi typically is)."}
{"text":"Finishing my Volcano Bowl as I type this...all I can say is AMAZING! If you like spicy, this is the poke bowl for you."}
{"text":"My first visit here definitely would have been 5 stars! I loved my bowl and have returned countless times with friends since then. With each visit though, I've found there isn't any consistency and the quality has worsened.

I know what I like and get the Cali bowl every time; not only have the portions gotten smaller (the amount of avocado halved in size, and the amount of poke just makes me sad), I've been noticing a distinct fishy taste/rancidity to the poke that wasn't there before.

With poke being such a hot trend right now, you might find better luck with another establishment until Poke Guys returns to its amazing beginnings."}
{"text":"Incredible example of Hawaiian poke. Very creative marinades and toppings. A must try for a sushi lover!!"}
{"text":"My first poke bowl in town and I loved it. Fresh, tasty and fully loaded flavours! We got the signature cali bowl, small size and it was filling. There's a hype around sushi burritos but I rather head over to Poke Guys any given day. You get more fish, more veggies, nori, and just more. Poke bowls isn't just another Chirashi bowl. They marinate their fish and you get to choose 5+ different sauces if you want another depth of flavour. I recommend the wasabi mayo. Has a lovely kick. I will be back next month!"}
{"text":"There was a small line for the lunch crowd, but it moves fairly fast. Servers were helpful with suggesting some good sauces for the Cali bowl (spicy aioli & shoyu). 

I got the regular size bowl and like some other reviews, the tuna & salmon portion was really small. It cost $5 to add any protein which makes it more worth it to get the large size if you want a filling meal."}
{"text":"I've tried several poke joints and this is by far my favourite! I ordered the Cali Bowl for the third time because it does not disappoint. It comes with Avocado, Salmon and Tuna which is a win for me as there's variety. I also added seaweed salad as an extra topping (every extra topping is 75 cents - which is worth it because they don't cheap out on the portion). All of their toppings are really fresh and the marinade/sauce of the Salmon and Tuna really elevates the flavour. My favourite is adding Tempura Bits.

You are also able to choose all the sauce that you want which is a big plus for me because i'm a SAUCE-y type of gal. Definitely my go-to poke place after trying several joints because the price (regular for 10.5) with the portion they give you is totally worth it. Especially the flavour that's infused with every poke bowl. 

Also, if you're a student and show valid student ID... they offer a deal that gets you a free drink! Super plus for me!!! Will always come back."}
{"text":"I just went here recently and to be honest it was the worst poke I'd ever had (maybe this is just because I've been blessed with having good poke before ...). Not because there was anything particularly bad about it that is easy to pinpoint, but it just wasn't very great. I'd recommend going to Pokito which is not that far away from Poke Guys."}
{"text":"I am so on board with the poke trend in Toronto!! This place is tucked away on a street off Dundas but it's not hard to find at all. 

We came here for lunch and ordered two of their signatures - cali bowl and a hui hou bowl, both regular size. Both were delicious and all the toppings were very fresh. I really enjoyed the variety of ingredients in each bowl.

Everything is made to order and you can customize your bowl to your liking if you don't like their signatures. This is a refreshing addition to the fast food lunch options!"}
{"text":"Terrible experience - I can't speak to the food, but the staff and organization was terrible. The shop had only been open an hour and they didn't have a number of ingredients ready for service, not just for what I wanted, but other customers in there with me. The service was slow and there seemed to be no system in place. I manage in the food service industry and know that it can be a challenge, but somethings got to be done. I left mostly due to hanger."}
{"text":"Overall the food was decent but when we got there around dinner time they had run out of a number of ingredients and the ones left did not exactly look fresh. Service was extremely slow and some staff thought it a priority to speak to their friends in the back of the line rather than serve customers which led to an unruly wait while this guy finished his conversation. Also everything kind of tasted the same. Cafeteria style ambiance. I am a poke fan but next time will try another place."}
{"text":"So good. We got the Hui bowl and the Cali bowl. Both were fantastic. Perfect amount of everything. The fish was really nicely marinated and super fresh in taste. I found the regular sized bowl to be the perfect amount. My fiancé got the large & it was more than enough. Annnnd we ordered it on uber. Overall, really satisfying and would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time, I am very pleased that at nearly closing time their fish still tastes fresh. I did the BYOB and got shoyu salmon with crabmeat and seaweed.  Tbh, I would give this place 5 stars for the service and taste. Portion wise, the salmon was alright, I had more crabmeat and seaweed. I'd still come back cos it's the closest poke place to me, hopefully they do a rewards thing and be more generous with their fish."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. It was my favorite find in Toronto and I will be back. It's like Chipotle and a Sushi place made a love baby. What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"I've never had Hawaiian food before, but DAMN will I ever be going back. Their fish IS DELICIOUS! now i'm planning my trip to hawaii"}
{"text":"Nowhere near a real Hawaiian poke!! Don't waste your $. The amount of fish is close to nonexistent what you are served. It's about 2 ounces for a small and 4 ounces for the large. They fill the bowls with either rice or lettuce. We payed $36 for 1 large & 1 small bowl.

Yes it tasted good but it's way overpriced for what you get. You're better off eating sushi if you really want to have fish. 

Hardly any seating inside & no a/c."}
{"text":"Poke guys is one of the many restaurants that have opened up to capitalize on toronto's obsession with food trends. This time, the poke bowl. 

I have tried poke guys twice and have had a similar experience both times. Both times I ordered the Cali's bowl with brown rice. The first time I got a regular size, the second I got the large. I would tend to go for the large, tho the regular could probably still keep you full for a while.

In both of my visits, in which I had I have had the Cali's bowl, I found it to be overly salty. I'm not sure if it's the marinade or another ingredient, but it ruins the whole dish for me. Maybe I should try a different bowl, or create my own (which seems to be an overly expensive option).

In terms of service, the staff is nice and friendly. Happy to answer questions, and generally very helpful. In my second visit, however, I was never asked if I wanted any extra toppings or any garnishes. After I placed my order, my bowl was made and taken directly to the cashier - not giving me the option to add anything else if I wanted (especially considering garnishes are free). 

Overall, I would say that although I'm a big fan of poke, I am unfortunately not a big fan of poke boys."}
{"text":"A friend introduced me to Poke Guys and I have gone 3 days in a row now.  Tried the PG, Cali and A Hui Hou Signature Bowls...  all are great, very fresh and delish!!  Staff are very friendly.  Good amount of seating.  There may be a line up depending what time you are there."}
{"text":"Ordered a hui hoe bowl. The large is super sized large almost to the point its unappetizing. When I first received it I thought to myself, \"fantastic, three meals right here.\" Sadly, I didn't even make a half meal out of it. Salmon had a fishy taste indicating the unfreshness of product. Even though very minimal) marinade couldn't hide the fishy taste. Edamame, while filling, had the stench of their refridgerator. White rice not properly cooked.

I'm sorry, but if this place is considered by Yelpers to be the best poke in Toronto, I won't bother trying the other stores."}
{"text":"It's 4.6.

This is probably the best poke place in Toronto(I've tried quite a few in the downtown area).  

Definitely get the Cali's bowl.  I usually get all the garnishes(minus the white onions) + ginger yuzu mayo.  Big chunks of salmon and tuna with slices of avocado, crab meat etc. everything goes so well together.


It's probably the best bang for the buck poke in town.   Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for takeout, I come here a couple of times a week, usually for the Cali bowl.

Some tips:
- The smaller size is probably going to be enough for you unless you're really hungry. The large one huge.
- Avoid around noon, 12-1pm. There's always a huge line that goes outside the store.
- You can combine two sauces - spicy aioli and creamy togarashi is a good combo for most bowls."}
{"text":"I visited Poke Guys for lunch and there were various types of bowls in two sizes, either regular or large.  You could chose to Build your own bowl or one of their Signature Bowls.  My choice was the Cali Bowl which contained white rice, salmon and tuna classic shoyu, masago, crab meat slaw, avocado, fried onion, nori and sesame seeds for $10.50.  The actual bowl was delicious and filling, I think well worth for what you get. 
The only thing I didn't like was that I saw a fly which bothered me.  For this reason I feel like the place needed more cleanliness.  Hence the reason why this review is not five stars."}
{"text":"Heard lots of good recommendation from my co-workers. Personally, i love to eat Hoedeopbap, a Korean dish that combines sashimi and all kinds of veggies topped with a bowl of rice and Korean sweet and sour hot sauce. Kinda like the Japanese style sashimi rice bowl Chirashi, but much much better in my opinion. However, after trying this Poke Bowl, i think it is even a level higher than Hoedeopbap. I can no longer be satisfied by Hoedeopbap!!!

It was a short 10 mins walk from my work at MaRS building at University and College. Finally get to try it today. When I got there, there were already a HUGE line up~ at least 30 ppl...good thing it didn't take too long, about 10-15 mins wait. It was well worth it.

Ordered a large Cali Bowl, topped it with pickled ginger, fried garlic, seaweed, and green onion. For the sauce, I chose the ginger yuzu mayo. 

It was awesome and super filling. The fish and toppings they gave was more than what I expected. The salmon and ahi tuna was well marinated. What i love about these Poke bowl is the complex flavour and freedom to create different combinations base on my preference."}
{"text":"First timer for poke bowls - it was absolutely delicious! Great size (regular), good price, friendly staff. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I went here with my friend's and Yelp's recommendation for lunch, but my excitement turned into an alright experience over all. We walked in to workers on their phones, not the most welcoming (however most of them were young so if it's the student life bringing them down, I understand). The place can only seat maybe 15 people, so we were lucky to get the window seats. I ordered PG's Classic and was happy to know that the other toppings were unlimited. The taste overall was filling and delicious all except for the kimchi. I'm unsure how kimchi is usually supposed to taste like, but theirs had a bitter after taste that turned me off from my poke bowl. After eating it all to savour the rest of the dish, the salmon tasted fresh and the combination of corn, brown rice, and cucumbers was refreshing. If Chipotle included raw fish chunks in their menu, I expect it would taste like Poke Guys' poke bowls. The cost was $11.30 including tax for a regular size, which I think is fair. I would maybe go again but opt out of the kimchi for a while."}
{"text":"One of my friends convinced me to try poke for the first time, and I did! Ordered the Cali bowl which was excellent. Its covered with a good helping of tuna and salmon sashimi pieces, along with shredded crab meat. Wasn't a huge fan of the lettuce leaves they added to it, thought it was a bit weird combo (thus the -1 star). Also rice was a bit hard, though granted I ate it an hour after I bought it. Service was fast and friendly. Would come again for a good lunch downtown."}
{"text":"My first sushi experience in 19 months (I was pregnant / nursing). Read a lot of reviews, this one seem to be one of the best ones. Thus I had really high hope, but the fish was not fresh, it tasted very fishy.

Its a bowl with a lot of ingredients that doesn't work well together at all"}
{"text":"Poke was yummy and will go back. Many sides to choose from. Did not see macadamia nuts there though."}
{"text":"Finally a good poke place in Toronto.
There are so many other mediocre poke places that sure, they taste alright, but I think Poke guys has it down the best.  It's not necessarily the most authentic, but it is a fresh twist on a classic that brings a really vibrant and tasty meal to Toronto.  It's not that they completely reinvented the wheel and that this is worse than \"real\" poke, but this is their own take on poke and it is really really delicious.
For one, the prices are so reasonable for what they give you, especially for the pre-made combos.  They give a ton of fresh ingredients and a surprisingly large amount of fish.  I had been used getting cheaped out by other places giving so little that I was so happy to see this place give a good amount of fish so that your last bites are not just rice.  I have been here maybe 3 times by now and if it was closer I would be here every day.  The food is fresh, it's healthy, and they do a great job in finding flavour combinations that work.  I did not find anything too salty, and everything was given in generous portions.  The price again, is like 10 dollars + tax for something that absolutely fills me up.  
There is always a bit of lineup though as it is a small place that is getting more and more popular, but that is barely an issue.  Hope this place keeps up the consistency of taste, price, and portion."}
{"text":"I go to Poke Guys with my friends for lunch every other week. What could be better than something that resembles a giant sushi in a bowl?

It's a small place that gets packed very quickly during lunch hours, but the food is good, service is great and portions even greater. My personal favourite is the A Hui Hou Bowl. And no, I can't pronounce it either."}
{"text":"Went downtown to try out few new places for a nice family date at Dundas & University! 

First for a mommy with a stroller & big diaper bag, love how there is street parking in busy downtown on Elizabeth street & the store is on street level without any big long STAIRS! 

Staffs are super friendly & welcoming~~ 
My hubby & I both custom our own poke bowl!
We both love the classic Korean Hau Ta Pak (sashimi rice bowl with hot spice) but always wish there is different sauces or ingredients! 

I had salmon& crab meat slaw with spicy Aioli & hubby had salmon with Ginger Yuzu Mayo & tangerine ~~both were deliciously refreshing ~~"}
{"text":"Went here during Poke Week Nov. 7-13, 2016 to try their Poke. My friend said their Poke was really close to the real one she tried while she was in Hawaii. 
    Being such a caveman but a true foodie,I tried Poke Guys with said friend and I wasn't disappointed. All the ingredients tasted really fresh,healthy,lite and complimented each other. Even came back a 2nd time to get more : Perfect to eat while watching \"Dr. Strange\" @ Drive-in, Lol.
   If you've heard of Poke but never tried it before, I highly recommend going to The Poke Guys . . . trust me, u won't regret it :)"}
{"text":"Great portion sizes, and healthy yet delicious!
Fast service and nice, relaxed decor for eating in. 

Best poke I've had in Canada so far :-)."}
{"text":"Perfect stop for lunch. Quick service, friendly staff, good food. I had the Cali's bowl and add some spicy aioli. Good portion for the $10ish CAD. Heck of a deal. Regular size bowl is perfect size but if you are extra hungry then splurge for the large size."}
{"text":"With all the hype and rave about this poke bowls, I gave it a shot with a coworker. We went over for a lunch and I had \"bulid your own\" with spicy salmon and my coworker had cali bowl. When we got there just shortly after noon, the line up wasn't so bad and the place wasn't very packed. But within 5-10 minutes the line was going out the door and no place for sitting.
Food was okay but I wouldn't say it was really good. It definitely was not terrible but not something I would rave about. The bowl was pretty small for the price (I got regular size for about 13 bucks) but variety of toppings made it interesting. The spicy salmon was plenty salty, so I regretted having sauce on top of it.
The staff was nice but I don't think I asked more than one question, so I wouldn't know how \"helpful\" they are.
Overall, it was good experience to try it out and I would come back if my friends want to eat here, but I definitely wouldn't be a \"regular\" to this place."}
{"text":"The food here was really good!! I tried the Cali bowl (11) and the large spicy shrimp bowl (around 15) and both were really good! The people working here were so nice and we were served really fast on a Friday afternoon. The tuna and salmon were my favourite part. It tasted so fresh and good I ate all of it (surprisingly because I don't eat a lot)."}
{"text":"Food is very fresh and good! Tasty and filling for lunch and $10 is price better than Rollation close by! Will sure go back!"}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to this place as I've never tried Poke before but I was some what disappointed not because it's not good but I just felt it wasn't as special as I had hope.  If you've ever had Chirashi, it's similar to that.  It's pretty reasonably priced for what you get but I felt like the quality can be better.  But it's a quick food place so maybe I'm over expecting.  I felt like more attention to details can be paid to the quality and presentation of the bowl.

The employee could be a little more helpful in helping us with the menu and the sauces.

Overall it's ok and I would still return if I'm in the area and craving for sushi/chirashi/poke.

It's located in a small street off Dundas and Bay area, so it might be hard to find for some and it's a completely self served place."}
{"text":"Great poke place. Cali bowl was a nice treat. Big size and plenty of toppings. Really enjoyed it. Well priced. I just didn't need all the rice but that's a small problem - just didn't eat it."}
{"text":"Portion sizes were quite generous for the medium size pricing however there could have been more fish.  I ordered a cali's bowl and added green seaweed salad which I felt gave the dish more flavour. For sauce I choose spicy aioli at the recommendation of the staff . The flavour was refreshing,  delicious and various  ingredients added a contrast of textures.

I recommend that they dice the fish (Tuna & salmon) into smaller bite sized pieces and also give more fish. Some fish were cut too big.  I would still return for a poke bowl fix if around the area."}
{"text":"Since I work in the area,  decided to stop by for lunch to try this infamous poke bowl.  Came with my colleagues and we all loved it.  Super fresh,  healthy and yummy.  

Food:
I ordered the Cali bowl with Ginger yuzu Mayo sauce.  It was very refreshing and filling.  I ordered the regular bowl and the portion was generous.  It was so good that I finished it all but was very full after. The salmon,  tuni,  avocado and veggies were all very fresh and delicious.  

Decor:
Menu is very nice and colorful on a chalkboard with very clear indications if you want to make your own custom bowl.  Limited tables and seats though.  It was so packed that I went to eat at the park across from the store."}
{"text":"Had the cali bowl. Very good combo. Rice was warm and had a nice bite. Fresh avocado and nicely marinated fish."}
{"text":"I built my own bowl today. 

Food: fish was cut too big but portion was generous. There were a lot of chewy gross bits I had to spit out unfortunately. The marinade was very nice on the classic shoyu. I wanted macadamia nuts on mine, which the server said is not an option even though it was clearly on the board. The rice portion was really small and unproportional but well cooked. 

Service: service was bad. There was an Asian girl with a very long ponytail who was really annoyed when I wasn't ready to order and still looking at the board. I then got served by another girl who was fine, but really sloppy. There was also another guy on crutches who was coughing all over the food without covering his mouth, super disgusting. 
My low rating is based entirely on the first server, and the guy on crutches."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend! Sushi bowl was delicious and came with generous toppings, especially the sashimi. I would go again when I'm in the area. Average bowl is $10"}
{"text":"Service is great but the food is dangerous. Went in with a bunch of friends and we all had salmon dishes, it was really delicious, however an hour after we ate we all got upset stomachs and I was visiting the washroom a lot.

Don't think I will go again. 

A shame because the location isn't bad and the people who work there are nice."}
{"text":"Been dying to try this place for some time now and finally had to opportunity to last night, with our Poke Week Passport. Because of Poke Week, their feature was the Cali Bowl which is their most popular one. 

Cali Bowl - Consists of white rice, salmon & ahi tuna classic shoyu, crab meat slaw, masago, avocado, fried onions, nori, black & white sesame seeds.  We were given the spicy ahi tun by accident, which we were happy with.  Although the promo just came in a sample size bowl, it was actually still quite satisfying.  What I personally appreciated about the serving was their generous amount of fish.  This afterall, is what you're really paying for, on top of the garnishing.  Even though it was spicy, I also chose their creamy togarashi which was absolutely delicious. 

I would definitely go back here and try another one of their signature bowls or even make my own. 5/5."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite poké shop. They have fresh ingredients, great combinations, good proportions and welcoming customer service.  I always get the cali bowl, never disappoints. I would recommend this place to others for sure!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite poke place but I am not sure now..
They start to decrease their food portion...

Scoops for fish egg or other stuffs changed to small tea spoon and their crabmeat salad has half cabbage mixed  together."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh, GENEROUSLY portioned (and I only got their \"regular\" which is their smallest size, some people ordered large but seriously, I don't know how those people were able to finish it), and a bit of a novel/hip thing to eat.  

At first glance, it seemed to be quite expensive at ~$10 for a regular signature bowl, but oh em gee, it is filling AF because the Cali bowl I got (which was absolutely yummy) was half loaded with white rice (aka almost got a diabetic shock from that carb-overload). Needless to say, I didn't finish it, and would have been totally content with eating half the bowl.

A couple of downsides include:
1. Their fish is pre-mixed in cucumber and sauce already (assuming the mixture is to your liking, but unfortunately for me, cucumbers are my hated vegetable of choice), however the server was very nice and tried to accommodate by avoiding it when scooping... 
2. Ran out of certain food toppings/garnishes...for my friend who got a signature, so it ended up looking more like a custom-made bowl.
3. There is a lineup, be prepared to wait.
4. Very limited tables and seating.

And in case you're wondering... no, this place is not related to Pokemon in any way, but does happen to be a Pokestop."}
{"text":"Following my discussion with Jenn, the owner, who got in touch with me wanting to improve my experience on the next visit - I've gotta say that the consistency situation has really improved. I went with my bf and both of our large bowls were given equal and fairly sized portions of fish. The staff was very welcoming as always and served with a smile. 

I really appreciate that this business takes the time to address the concerns of their consumers and that they are actually listening to us. Thank you for that!

I'll be revisiting soon in hopes that the consistency of serving is still consistent ;)"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is exceptional and the price is fair. My go-to is the spicy tuna poke bowl on white rice with black & white sesame seeds, edamame, spicy pickles, and jalapenos. Damn. 

Tip: the regular size is more than plenty with 2 ladles of poke. I've tried the large with 3 ladles of poke and couldn't finish it. 

Uber Eats delivers from the Poke guys if you'd prefer. Other notes: relatively small seating area, really nice staff and they take credit card."}
{"text":"Me and my husband ordered Cali's bowl and Wasabi Octopus bowl, both of them were very good. Cali's bowl comes with salmon, tuna, avocado, crab meat and assorted greens, which are all my favs. you can add whatever you want and choose your favourite source. We ordered regular size which is huge, they were $23 something in total, it was a little bit pricey to us. Service was really good, the girl who helped us was very friendly and patient. We will go back to this place again if we ever want some light food in downtown.

(Fun fact: no idea what does poke guys mean?? But the pronunciation is extremely extremely similar to a Cantonese cursed word)"}
{"text":"Got the regular size pg's bowl and it was amazing. It was actually hard to choose because they all looked so appetizing. The portion was quite big for a regular size, i couldnt even finish it!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst poke I had in Toronto. Yes, the portions are larger compared to other poke places but in the end, it just became a huge rice bowl. The fish cuts were not fresh and was very chewy. Decent amount of seating for a poke place, enough to fit around 10 people. Overall impression was alright, wouldn't go back to it."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It was the first place I tried poke and it's definitely the best as well. 

I have tried the Cali Bowl and it's hard to deviate from that, I did however try other places and it just doesn't compare. This place offers the most fresh and price competitive bowls. It costs about $11 for the Cali after tax and at other places I find I pay close to $14 after tax. 

I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place was a great value and very tasty! I got the Cali bowl, which seems to be there most famous selection since it had a mixture of salmon, tuna, crab meat avocado, and other things you'd find in a California roll sushi. It was $10 for a small and $13 for a large

I liked the fact that you can choose different toppings at the end. The fried garlic was pretty delicious. I chose the wasabi mayo sauce and found it to be a great mix. The wasabi wasn't too overpowering, but really accentuated the taste of the bowl.

I was very full after the small bowl, but a guy could probably use a large bowl. 

The place was a bit small, so it's not ideal for large groups. We had three people and one of us had to sit at a table to reserve it, as well as negotiate with another group to get an extra table - that was slightly stressful..."}
{"text":"Average poke to me, nothing specially with the Cali bowl.

Also, I ordered carryout. I would appreciate if they give us the actual carryout box instead of taping two bowls together to replace a lid which imo does not do the job. My food was spilled all over the place."}
{"text":"I love this place, but I got food poisoning after eating the Cali's Bowl recently (I think the Crab Slaw was the culprit). The signature poké bowls taste delightful and are relatively inexpensive, and the lines move quickly at lunch time. Hopefully I can muster the courage to go back, but with many other options around I may take my digestive system elsewhere."}
{"text":"Got my office hooked on poké and Poké Guys are the best! It's totally a food trend but I'm glad it's here cuz I've been wanting to try poké for years. Have never tried authentic poke... Obvs! But I like the what the Poké Guys are offering.
I've tried a few poke joints in the city and these Guys have the best flavour and bang for your buck. Their regular size bowl is packed with lots of fish and very filling, the regular size is equivalent to the large portion at the poke spots. I ordered the large once and I had to stop halfway cuz I was too full. 
My go-to order is the Cali Bowl ($10 plus tax) with half brown rice and half salad, and you can add as much toppings as you like. Customizable and fresh ingredients are a plus! I've ordered vegetarian and gluten free bowls for a few co-workers and they loved it. Service can get a bit hectic especially when it's busy but they turn it around pretty quick.
I've always taken my order to-go as the space is small and it's always busy. But I will definitely come back for more."}
{"text":"The California poke bowl we shared was extremely filling and well priced. The small restaurant was busy but we managed to grab the last table. The staff provided great service."}
{"text":"Very fresh poke and good toppings. I don't like that all the fish options were mixed in some sort of sauce which had either garlic or spice. Limited seating but a lot of people walked in for to go orders."}
{"text":"I ordered the large volcano bowl. It came with several ingredients (edadame, spicy seaweed salad, spicy salmon, etc). Toppings and sauces are free and unlimited. The ingredients were fresh and tasty. The bowl itself was huge. I wouldn't mind paying $14 again for a large bowl."}
{"text":"Being just a few steps away from the Eatons centre puts Poke guys conveniently down town. Virtually empty when I visited, it doesn't quite have the same draw as it's neighbor on Elizabeth street, Japango. The space is a little dark, even during the day, but as a 'fast-casual' spot, you're not there for the ambiance.

Poke bowls highlight fresh ingredients, with nothing to hide behind, so I'm sad to say that this is where Poke Guys disappointed.  The rice was slightly hard in the middle, clearly undercooked. Similarly, the avocado was underripe. I give them credit for pre-marinating their poke."}
{"text":"I've always liked Poke Guys. They may be the first poke joint that I've been returning in to Toronto. I mean, obviously I cannot compare to the poke from LA or the poke from Hawaii (never had the latter) but they are definitely delicious and consistent with their food.

I've had probably half of the items on their menu and my favourite might be Cali Bowl with brown rice. It's a nice mixture of wet and dry ingredients but what I don't like is how big the pieces of fish are. They're actually huge and difficult to eat. Their volcano bowl is delicious as well but way too saucy and ends up being a big gloopy spicy mess in the end but it still like to eat it from time to time.

The size of the bowl is huge. I usually share a large as the small is too much for me. So for the price, you're definitely getting your money's worth. The staff is also really nice. Would definitely recommend Poke Guys!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the couple times I've come! The service was always fast and friendly. I'm always very full after and my appetite is above average for an adult male. I feel like the portions are quite adequate, there's enough fish that I can have a chunk of with almost every bite. I'm always craving for Poke Guys when I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"When I first heard of poke, I had no clue what it was but there were tons of stores opening in Toronto. I had my first poke bowl down the street at Rolltation (I know it's known for sushi burrito but I really wanted poke). It was filling but pretty expensive and the quality was just alright. 

Then, when I heard there was a cheaper alternative right down the street! I knew I had to try it.  One day a coworker and I visited the store. She had the Hui Huo bowl and I ordered the Cali bowl. It was delicious!  We both liked the variety in our bowls. The portion size was super generous and the quality was perfect. I've been wanting to try the other bowls but I think I've committed to the Cali because the ingredients are such a wonderful mix and you get both salmon and tuna! I had gone back to try the Hui Huo and it is a great choice, I think it's great you could get seaweed salad in your bowl with a mix of other cool ingredients too.

The owner really cares about making the customer experience better and that's why I would give this review 5 stars. I had a little incident where I wasn't informed about a promotion and was disappointed, but it was quickly rectified and dealt with professionally. I'd definitely come back and pick Poke Guys as my first choice for poke bowls. Not only is the food wonderful but Poke Guys will make sure your experience is a great one."}
{"text":"Recent times I've been here the fish just hasn't been as fresh anymore. Was super disappointed, this used to be my favourite place :("}
{"text":"I had the large Cali bowl which came to just a bit over $15 with tax. Importantly for that price there was a very reasonable amount of tuna and salmon...I hate it when other places skimp on the star protein of the bowl. 

The combo of flavors was delicious and very filling. The fake crab slaw was yummy and the fried onions added a delicious crunch. Avocado always a winner with salmon and tuna. I substituted brown rice and had the wasabi mayo both were great. Little disappointed they didn't have the macadamia nuts on the menu which I was willing to pay extra for. 

Guy who made my bowl just stared at me no hi or what would you like. Girl he handed it over to was pretty grim too - didn't ask if I wanted any garnishes and just said very matter-of-fact \"no macadamia nuts\". Cashier was much better. Saying that I'm here just for takeout at lunch so don't really expect 5 star service. I'd come back and try some of the other bowls as long as they don't start cheapening out on the fish portions."}
{"text":"Girlfriend and I ordered the custom bowls. A regular size is about $9.50 and $10.50 for a large, with just one topping and you add $0.50-$1.00 each topping (I think it's $1.09 for crab meat and avocado). Just ask the servers and they will gladly help you order! Don't be scared! Overall it was kind of pricey but honestly it was really delicious. We both had spicy salmon and the quality of the salmon was great and taste was amazing. I'll definitely try it again but not often."}
{"text":"First time coming here and I was pretty impressed with the quality of ingredients and the large size was pretty huge. Wish they had a medium as the small was too small so went large and that was a lot of rice. 

Fish had a great marinade on it, ingredients were fresh and in good portions. Had the California bowl. Will be back."}
{"text":"One of the first poke shops to arrive in downtown Toronto and definitely my favourite so far. Located on Elm Street in the quieter end past Japango. Large chunky pieces of fish, abundant amount of toppings, well cooked rice...what more can one ask for? 

Their Signature bowls are a steal at $10 and I love the Cali's bowl. Tuna AND salmon, with crab meat, veggies, avocado, it is filling! I eyed the large bowl the first time I was there and luckily my friend advised me to just get the regular, and that was a smart choice. 

The fish is actually marinated. And they give enough so that I always have a piece or two left when I finish everything else (which never happens cus I devour them). 

Friendly staff and yay, they give take-out plastic bags. Don't get me wrong, I am all for the paper bags and the environment, but when it's raining/snowing outside, it's hard to grip paper bags and prevent it from soggification."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch to try out poke bowls.
We had the PG's bowl and the Caifornia bowl.

When i ordered - they ran out of tuna so they gave me extra salmon.
Fish was fresh and the portion is a good size.
Normally it would be about $10 per poke bowl but when we went there was a special on $5 signature bowls so we paid $10 for 2 bowls + tax."}
{"text":"This was my first time trying poke guys. I got the Cali bowl with white rice and my grandma got PG bowl with white rice, both in the regular size. The  portions and flavours were all great but one HUGE disappointment that completely ruined the experience for me was the fact that the white rice was UNDER COOKED. Then I tried my grandmas bowl, the rice was ALSO UNDER COOKED. How can you serve rice to your customers without tasting it first and making sure it's cooked? Will I have another poke bowl? For sure! BUT it will definitely NOT be from poke guys."}
{"text":"Still awesome!!! I eat here about once every couple of months and it is delicious and satisfying every time :)"}
{"text":"This place is yummy in my tummy :) a great place for a quick bite for either lunch or when you're in a rush. As there isn't a lot of seating I would say out of consideration to other customers this isn't a place for that lengthy heart to heart talk, hence fast food :)

Poke is actually a raw fish salad. Poke is the Hawaiian verb for \"to slice or cut\". People think that this place is a Japanese fusion place based on Pokemon but it's actually a new cuisine very new to the Toronto food world!

That being said, I had the Cali bowl which traditional ahi tuna and cucumber poke, with avocado, flying fish roe, crab salad, and greens on rice. Toppings are considered on the house so I chose seaweed flakes, crispy onions, and sesame seeds. The finishing sauce I chose was spicy aioli because the worker said that was the best ha.

I found the small to be extremely filling as I have a small stomach and was really savouring every bite, but The boyfriend had a large and finished it all so to each their own :) 

The fish was legit melt in your mouth fresh, I was amazed as I was under the impression that they'd cheap out on fish quality considering the bowls are only 10$. I would eat here like every week if I was around that area but alas GTA is where it's at :p definitely a huge favourite of mine to come.

One big flaw was there were flies around a lot and the garbage was pretty gross as people keep wasting the rice and only eating the toppings.... just ask for no rice then losers. As staff are so busy with customers this task also needs to be remembered to check often. A green bin for  unfinished food with a lid would be great. Recycling bin too for the bowls, just saying."}
{"text":"So popular among friends and was the talk for a bit so I had to check this place out.

It is a small shop that has some tables but definitely not meant to hold large crowds. Pretty clean and I came at a quiet time (lucky me) so service was fine and they waited patiently while I studied the menu.

I ended up getting the PG bowl with a few extra sides and i chose the bigger bowl. Holy moly was I full! Like a good full though! They gave me tons of the included ingredients like salmon, edamame, corn, etc. which is awesome! No cheaping out, great! It all tasted pretty good and they seemed to have fairly fresh ingredients. They also didn't give you an unreasonably large amount of rice unlike other food shops that just want to stuff you with rice instead of the actual goodies. That's a plus for me! Price is reasonable too given the portions provided.

I will definitely come back to try their other options since I enjoyed their food a lot. Indeed they deserve to be the talk among friends for a fairly new food place to try!"}
{"text":"Location/Service
It's on a side street along Dundas (near Tsujiri/Chatime area). The restaurant has a pink/red sign, so it's not too difficult to miss. Parking is available on the street or by a paid lot. 
Inside has a very simple interior. There's a few tables available if you want to dine in, but more of a grab and go layout. 
Staff were very nice, explained the menu very well and answered any questions. 

Food
Shared a large Cali bowl, which has the classic salmon, tuna and crab meat. Seafood ingredients were fresh and a good portion. I chose brown rice, which was crunchy to taste (maybe not to everyone's standard). I liked how there are sauces and toppings to add if you are feeing adventurous and they're made fresh right in front of your eyes. 

Poke is really now a healthy trend in Toronto and there are multiple places to choose from. I didn't see this one any special compared to others, but having a convenient location and a quick go-to place adds a nice touch."}
{"text":"Probably the best poké place in Toronto. I would highly recommend the Cali bowl and add seaweed salad! I love all the different sauces and toppings that they offer i.e fried onions, fish eggs and scallions. All in all this is my go to Poké spot in the city and it's only a couple of minutes alway from Ryerson and Eatons centre!"}
{"text":"Really delicious. Had the make your own bowl. Brown rice, greens, pineapple, edamame beans, seaweed, sesame seeds, and wasabi sauce. Great mix of flavours. The small was the perfect amount for a filling lunch :)"}
{"text":"Their fish tastes old. Edamame even went bad. I paid extra 50 cents and had to throw them away. I ordered Cali's bowl and the only good thing in the bowl was crab salad. Sorry for my honest review but I won't go back."}
{"text":"I came by here because I was craving poke after looking at some photos back from my Hawaii Trip. Boy, it was a good decision! I recommend Building your own bowl and treating yourself to the heaping scoops of spicy tuna over a bed of rice. Super tasty and fresh + very flavorful. They do have salmon as another fish option, and their add-ons are great as well! Many items to choose from: sesame, Wakame, edamame, corn, avaocado etc."}
{"text":"This is a must try place!  I think it's the best option if you are looking for something fresh and healthy!  Also if you are trimming some carbs down, their bowls are super healthy and they have a vegan option...  #tasteofhawaiiintoronto"}
{"text":"This was my first time trying a poke bowl and I loved it! The flavours were amazing and you get a good portion for their price. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The poke here is great! Went here in the beginning of September for the first time and was not disappointed. Lots of choices there! You can make your own or you can just pick one from the menu. Quality was great too! Super fresh and tasty. The guy that was helping us was super friendly and inviting, as well as gave us suggestions. there's not a lot of seating, but that's because of location, so not ideal for a huge group."}
{"text":"I came here with friends and got one of their signature bowls, the A Hui Hou bowl. For toppings I got nori, shallots, and dried beets and spicy sauce. In hind sight could have got it without the sauce because it was too salty with it. I really enjoyed my bowl. The toppings were great with the fish.  Beware there is a lot of rice so if you don't want as much maybe ask them for less. I would come back for lunch since it's close to school."}
{"text":"After waiting about 20 mins in line during a Thursday lunch rush, I chose to try the Cali bowl. The bowl has ahi tuna, cucumber poke, with avocado, flying fish roe, crab salad, and greens on rice. Toppings (which are free to choose) were seaweed flakes, onions, and sesame seeds. There are a bunch of finishing sauces that you can choose. I went with the spicy one.

All in all- it was ok. The portion size was ok, too much rice. The fish was decent. I have tried numerous poke places in Hawaii and the New York. Their bowls are really to die for. 

I would come back to Poke guys given the convenience of the location"}
{"text":"Delicious and a couple bucks cheaper than the nearest competitor!! fast and friendly service. Been there 3x - will be back. Have more promotions or loyalty card!"}
{"text":"This was my first time having poke, and it was delicious. Originally, me and my best friend were supposed to go to a different poke restaurant, but due to this one being most close and convenient, we quickly switched plans. We sure are happy that we did.

Me and my best friend visited on a Saturday around noon, and it was not very crowded. We quickly got to order, and as a person who constantly changes their mind and takes a while to decide, the worker making my bowl was very nice and patient. I ordered a regular size bowl with a white rice base, salmon, wasabi mayo, fried onions, furikake, and nori. I really enjoyed being able to create my own bowl, and having everything I like in it. For the price I paid, it was extremely worth it. It filled me up, leaving me full and was a way more healthier alternative then going to a fast food place. 

Overall, Poke Guys was an amazing place to eat at, and I will most definitely be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Glad I paid Poke Guys a visit whilst I was on my Toronto trip. So much Poke-ing better than the ones in London, UK. Not only were they cheaper, tastier but the toppings are much more generous. I ordered a regular bowl but it's probably double the size and half the price of the ones I've had before and the fish chunks were huge compared to my usual ones. $10CAD +VAT for a regular bowl"}
{"text":"Excellent poke bowls, but no substitutions on signature bowls (I like the Volcano bowl, but I don't like the cucumber, and I was told I couldn't substitute). And I think getting the custom bowl is a bit more expensive. Large size bowl is indeed quite large, but recently they increased their prices. 

Mihito (which is nearby) offer some more ingredient choices, tacos, and Ritual pickup (which I prefer), so I tend to like Mihito a bit better.

Quality: 8/10. Services: 8/10. Value: 7.5/10. Overall: 7.5/10 (not an average)."}
{"text":"OH SO FRESHHHH! Got the veggie bowl which was super delicious. They were out of edamame, so I got to replace it with another vegetable. I chose the kimchi. On second thought I should have gotten any other vegetable..kimchi has an overpowering flavour. Avocado was perfectly ripe which made me happy! If you can, try all the sauces!"}
{"text":"They give generous portions. But quality is not consistent. Here's my experience: 

Bowl 1: Cali bowl had fresh fish, but they gave me very little crab salad and it's one of the more expensive toppings ($0.50 extra). At least the avocado was ripe and buttery! 


Bowl 2: Cali bowl with very SALTY salmon. The fish wasn't fresh at all, pretty watery when you bite into it. I got more crab salad but they gave me a smaller slice of avocado compared to bowl 1. It was very obvious that they gave me A LOT more crab salad than the first time I had this bowl.They also drenched my bowl with sauce (not a big fan) which adds to the extreme saltiness. 

I'd go here again to fill my stomach up. They give very generous portions. About $10 for a regular sized signature bowl. It's $13 dollars for the larger size.


EDIT: they changed the recipe of their crab salad. Now it contains a mixture of cabbage or a vegetable of some sort. It doesn't taste as good as the previous recipe. I feel like the crab salad plays a vital role in poke, so I won't be eating here as much as before."}
{"text":"As others have mentioned in their reviews, poke guys provides good value for what you are paying. The bowls are big and come fully loaded. But fully loaded means stuffing you more with the cheaper items like rice.  But I thought the poke was just alright. I didn't enjoy the sauce as much my rice was not fully cooked."}
{"text":"Went to downtown Toronto with my friends today and stopped by this place after reading the reviews, and I have to admit, the reviews totally match my experience here! 

From the moment I walked in I was greeted by one of the many friendly staff working there. They have a list of pre-made bowls or your can build your own bowl. I ended up ordering the wasabi octopus bowl. 

The restaurant doesn't skimp out on meat, as my bowl came LOADED with octopus. Furthermore, the vegetables on top were fresh and crunchy/just as they're meant to be. The bowl comes with the ingredients said on the menu, but you choose the garnish you want and the sauces. I got jalapenos, tempura garnish, and spicy aioli.  I loved the different textures in the bowl, and the kick provided by the spicy sauce and wasabi, though the wasabi was overpowering in some bites. I got a regular bowl but the portion size was more that enough to fill me up. 

Overall, this place is definitely recommended by me. My first time trying poke was totally worth it."}
{"text":"I would recommend the Cali Poke bowl! There's salmon, tuna, avocado and the fake crab meat salad for 10$. The ingredients and fish taste fresh, and if you're carb-conscious I'd recommend going half brown rice and half spring mix and get the sauce on the side. I highly recommend  the togarashi sauce! I think the regular serving size is sufficient."}
{"text":"Can I just declare my love for this place and eat here every day?

I've been a fan of poke guys since their soft opening in the summer, and definitely have abandoned my packed lunch on more than one occasion to eat here. The portions are *always* generous, and I love that they don't charge extra for brown rice. I've taken a dabble at creating my own poke bowl but can't get enough of their signature A Hui Hou bowl. The combination of seaweed salad with their salmon poke is perfection. Not a huge fan of their Soo Fresh Bowl as I found the bowl lacking in flavour and a bit watered down from the squirts of shoyu. 


Tip: Depending on the staff, you might want to ask for light dressing at the final station as they sometimes can overdo it."}
{"text":"Since the poke / bowl trend is so popular now, I decided to check out this small poke restaurant as I walked back along Dundas street in the early evening.  I was curious to see how the poke bowls here in Toronto compared with those back home!

Atmosphere: 3/5  This is a small convenient restaurant located just off Dundas st close to university.  There were only a few tables and not very busy when I visited during the early evening hours.  Overall probably too small to sit comfortably for a standard meal and most people tend to take out, but simple and no-nonsense.

Food: 4/5  I love the fresh taste and variety of ingredients in a poke bowl, and there was no exception here.  I ended up creating my own large bowl of brown rice / greens, with classic salmon as the protein and corn, seaweed salad, masago, edamame, tomatoes, green onions as toppings.  I esp liked the small amount of flavoring and chewy texture of the brown rice!  Good portion size 
  
Service: 3.5/5  Efficient and friendly

Price: 2/5  Unfortunately, this bowl was more expensive than I expected, perhaps because I was not used to the additional PST!  Another thing that bothered me was that I had to pay for each topping, and even the large bowl only came with one protein option.  As a result, it was a little difficult to estimate the cost of the bowl until the end.

Overall: 3/5  The ingredients were great and I enjoyed my poke bowl as always, however the space was a little small in this restaurant and the pricing scheme seemed a little less friendly compared with what I was used to.  I would still recommend trying out the bowls here though!"}
{"text":"Get the cali bowl. You won't regret it. The price is reasonable for the amount of fish, toppings, and rice that you get."}
{"text":"SOOO GOOD. when I went with my other friend it was very empty, but i think that enhanced the experience. we were able to take our time with ordering since there is a lot to choose from. the worker was very helpful along every step of the way. the endless list of toppings and fresh fish was so amazing... definitely wont be my last time there !! highly recommend if you are a sushi lover but dont wanna pay over $20 for only 2 rolls. this will satisfy your craving"}
{"text":"I've been a here a few times and while I started out liking the place, it's gotten worse with every visit.

The last time I went, the server messed up my order but was defensive and said that he thought he'd heard something else. He made me another bowl - so that was fine. 

However, the fish (salmon and tuna) in the new bowl he made for me was absolutely inedible. Not only did it have a slightly 'off' taste and slimy texture, it was incredibly chewy and seemed to be comprised of only tough muscle fibres. It was not possible to eat at all. This means one of two things: Either I had been given inedible odds and ends of the fish that a respectable cook would usually throw away, or I had been given stale fish that had gone bad. 

That night, I also saw a post on facebook from someone who had found a giant bug in their poke from the Poke Guys. Never, never, never again."}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite poke restaurant cuz I loved how they don't skimp on ingredients and everything tasted so fresh, but I got it for dinner last night and the portions got way smaller and the poke didn't taste or look fresh at all. I'm really disappointed and hope this was just a one-off!"}
{"text":"Poke is the next new thing in Toronto. However, I feel like poke guys leave a lot to be desired. When I arrived, it took approximately 20 minutes for me to order and receive my bowl. I get putting all the ingredients in a bowl takes time, but not that long. 

The rice tasted like it had been in the cooker for a bit longer than it should. Finally, the whole bowl was drenched in sauce, which helped to diguise the not so fresh tasting fish and garnishes. Overall, Poke bowl would be satisfactory for someone who's never had poke before. But if you experienced authentic poke before, you will surely be disappointed."}
{"text":"My go to place for Poke when I have a craving for sushi or  sashimi - this is the good inbetween. I like the fact that you have the option of brown rice to feel healthier.

I've tried the cali bowl (my go to) and the Hou Hui Bowl. 

Ingredients are fresh, crisp and go well together - there really is no bad combination. Portions are generous a regular size ($10.5) is enough to fill me up! 

Will def. be going back :)"}
{"text":"Saw this place on blogTO when it first opened up maybe 2 months back. Never heard of Poke before, so when I saw there was a new business called \"Poke Guys\" I was thinking \"poke? What's poke? Do they offer poking services? Perhaps this is an acupuncture place? But why would it be listed as a restaurant?\"

I decided to go with a regular PG bowl the first time around, and it was pretty filling.
The large bowl is a bit flatter, so I'm not sure how much more food you get in there, but it's only a few dollars more.

Haven't tried a customized bowl myself, but have seen others try it and paid more than just getting a signature bowl, so unless you must have certain ingredients, going with a signature bowl seems to work out better in terms of budget.

The back of the building is quite interesting if you decide to go on an adventure to find the washroom. It looks like it's connected to a larger building so you're pretty much going through a series of hallways. Kind of amusing.

Chopsticks were available the first time around, though at a subsequent visit they were not available for taking. Not sure if they decided to stop offering chopsticks or if they ran out."}
{"text":"I come here all the time whenever I'm feeling poke. I definitely come here because of proximity to work and school."}
{"text":"I believe in giving second chances, so I decided to return to Poke Guys and ordered one of the signature bowls A Hui Hou bowl.  Poke Guys has redeemed themselves.  The rice was cooked perfectly this time and was also a little warm, which is my preference.  With the sudden pop-up of numerous Poke joints, Poke Guy is definitely a better value at $10 for a regular sized bowl, you get a fairly decent sized bowl that is packed with toppings.  The bowl may appear small, but it is deceptively filling.  This is coming from someone who is usually a big eater.   Poke Guys you have won me over and I will add you to my roster of weekday work lunches."}
{"text":"Very tasty Poke Bowels. Great selections and seemingly fresh. Good portions."}
{"text":"I had the cali bowl again but this time I got a large and it was way too filling. I had to force myself to keep eating it (similarly to when you order so much all you can eat sushi and you get determined to finish it all. The quality and freshness is consistent. Fast service as well."}
{"text":"I had always been a fan of Poke Guys. It's close to my office, so I go for lunch very often.  But during my past few visits, I had found that portions of the poke became less.  I'm not sure if it's just inconsistency of the servers or they have decided to cut portions, but I really hope this gets fixed. It use to be the best poke place in the area."}
{"text":"I'm not crazy about the topping prices. However it's a decent poke place if you're craving. Depending on the server, some give more, some are stingy. Would i come here again? If I'm in the area. I wouldn't go out of my way though. 

For me personally, I always get the tuna and it comes with cucumbers so that saves 85cents. 
The pineapple is a nice surprise! Never would have gotten it. The seaweed salad made everything in my bowl fishy but that's just me.

Posting pictures of the new menu prices as there are none here."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on the weekend got the Cali's bowl and volcano bowl.

Atmosphere: 3
- casual setting
- very clean inside 
- cool wall decors 

Food: 4
- Cali bowl includes your choice of brown or white rice, salmon AND tuna in a delicious blend of shoyu, crab meat slaw and avocado. It was however a bit too saucy and the crab meat slaw was overpowering. But it's still their most popular dish. 
- Mauna Loa bowl (volcano bowl) includes your choice of brown or white rice with spicy salmon, spicy seaweed salad, spicy cucumber and edamame. They actually didn't have edamame when I went so it was substituted with corn which was actually very good. It is on the spicier end but overall it was delicious and flavourful! 
- all the ingredients taste fresh!
- regular bowls $10.5
- large bowls $14 
- portions are generous...I couldn't finish my regular size bowl...

Service: 4
- staff are friend and accommodating to dietary needs 

Tips: ask for less sauce... the fish itself is already very flavourful."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with my boyfriend at a time when it wasn't busy and I was greeted by a very friendly staff member. She helped us decide which poke bowls to get based on our preferences and that was great since it was my first time at Poke Guys and my boyfriend's first time having poke ever, and I wanted him to have a good experience. We both ordered regular sizes to go; he got the Cali Bowl and I got the A Hui Hou Bowl. We got takeout and then found a place to settle down to break into the food - and man, was it tasty! The fish was fresh, the sauces made everything a delight to eat, and I really enjoyed the simple toppings. Later on, I've come at least 2-3 more times with other friends and they've really enjoyed it! Plus, I found out that I have a couple friends/people I know working there, so everytime I go, they give me the employee friends and family discount and extra scoops of poke at no extra charge, plus a free drink with student ID. So great - service, quality and experience :) In addition, it's not a bad price - quite affordable compared to some poke places - for the portions. I would definitely say with all the protein and rice they pack into a regular size that is sufficient for a hungry appetite, get large only if you're absolutely famished or sharing."}
{"text":"I like their Cali bowl because it contains both salmon and tuna. The first time I had it, the rice was a little bit under cooked. I came back a couple of times and I did not get that problem again. Spicy mayo adds a very creamy texture to the bowl but it could be a tad spicier. 

Overall, the ingredients are fresh and the bowl itself is flavourful. The bowls are very customizable and you can DIY, which is great for picky eaters. The price is decent for the portion size you receive."}
{"text":"Poke Guys is by far the best poke place downtown. Most importantly, their fish is FRESH. They offer a choice of brown or white rice, or a salad base, and a wide variety of toppings that compliment the fish well.

I usually go for the PG bowl, their new volcano bowl, or ask the staff to make me whatever's on their mind. I've never been disappointed so far!

Jacky, the owner, and the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Even though they put care into every bowl, arranging ingredients to look good, and answering questions about topping choices, they still manage to make sure you're able to place and receive your order quickly. So don't be afraid if you see a line, they'll get to you soon enough, and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I like this place! 

It's a causal little space with great fresh food! They are very generous with the toppings! I feel good after eating this for lunch, knowing it's fresh and it's real food! The only unhealthy part is the creamy sauce but they are soooo good. I got creamy togarashi for my sauce- interesting! 

I came around 11:30am. There's a few people in line for take out. The dining area has a few tables, definitely not for big groups. Service is fast and friendly. 

I will come back for sure if I am in the area."}
{"text":"I would give this place zero if I could. I feel like I wasted all my money and also I can throw up any second. I never review but this is necessary. Avoid at all costs. Maybe it's just me but ya I wouldn't ever come back again. The fish just didn't feel fresh and the combination just didn't work together."}
{"text":"Had the regular size make your own bowl 
*  brown rice 
* spicy salmon 
* Fried onion 
* jalepenos 
* masago (fish eggs)
* corn 
* spinach leaves 
* bunch of other things I can't recall 

Great service. But this place gets busy during lunch time so come prepped for a place packed with people, little seating and crumbs on the table/counter.

Overall loved the poke bowl .. absolutely delish and the regular is filling enough!"}
{"text":"Located on a side street near Yonge Dundas Square. Came here at around 1:30PM on a Saturday because I was craving some poke and wanted to have my partner try it for the first time. 

We decided to share the regular size cali bowl as we ate something just before coming here so we needed something to fill up the rest of our stomachs, haha. They follow the dish's ingredient list and at the end, let you choose your garnishes and sauces. I chose nori, the crunchy brown flakes (idk what they are called haha), watermelon radish, and sesame seeds. Topped the whole thing off with aioli, wasabi mayo and shoyu sauce. Total came to $11.30 with tax. 

The poke bowl was delicious and so filling!! My partner and I couldnt get enough of it. I just love the different textures and tastes, all in one dish. However, the poke was a bitttt on the salty side so next time I think Ill skip the shoyu sauce. 

Overall, great food, filling portions, and lovely service. Give it a try!!"}
{"text":"Really delicious and worth the price. I got the Cali bowl and there were lots of pieces of salmon and tuna, so it's good knowing they didn't skimp out there. Large size is indeed quite filling, but you don't feel bloated and tired after. You can also pick some garnishes too, so you can tailor it to your tastes (I added spicy aioli and jalapenos for a kick). 

Would definitely recommend and I look forward to coming back here and trying more of their bowls."}
{"text":"This was my first time having Poke, I had no idea what to expect. 

The staff were super friendly in helping me add a few things to my bowl. I ordered a veggie bowl trusting their judgement and added some spicy mayo - which totally ended up working! Really loved their tofu and the ingredients were all super fresh. 

It looks like a small bowl and I was fairly hungry but I'm the end it was super filling! 

I've now started describing Poke to friends as \"sushi in a bowl\" as that's my understanding. 

Can't wait to come back and try different combinations!"}
{"text":"All of it combined together with the sauces and everything tasted good, but ingredients were not \"fresh\". Service was also a bit weird, the girls behind the counter definitely didn't want to be there. 

Wouldn't come back as there are so many options."}
{"text":"I've been to two other poke joints (Cali Love) and (SuBu) - and Poke guys is the BEST ONE thus far in terms of taste and value! (portions; price). The portions are GREAT - I usually get a regular and it fills me up. They definitely don't skimp on the fish as well as the premium toppings (crab slaw, avocado, fish eggs, etc.). I highly recommend this place! The staff are always friendly as well!"}
{"text":"I kept an open mind and have been meaning to try poke bowls to see what the hoo haa is all about. It's good! Don't get me wrong, the idea of poke bowls I like. I love raw fish and I love salad. However, I really don't understand the high demand/trend/popularity of it. I guess for me when I ordered my Cali bowl, I felt like I could just go the Lawrence Market, buy the sushi grade fish and all the fresh veggies, and make it myself with a bigger portion of the fish etc. It isn't something I find would be difficult to make really. But it definitely was tasty, I just don't understand the big hype and all the poke bowl joints opening up. 

I guess the way I see with food is if I can easily cook/make it myself at home...I don't want wait in line to fork out money for it. Unless it has some kind of secret method/ingredient.

Overall if I was to give a grade to this place...a C? or C+. I recommend anybody to try it at least once, just to see what it's all about."}
{"text":"Came here just before 12pm on a weekday and it was empty. It gave us first timers a lot of time to peruse and get feedback from the staff(super friendly) as to what to order. About 10 mins later the place filled up, out the door line ups and all the tables were full. 

For those that don't know Poke is marinated raw fish, here - salmon or tuna. You have shoyu (a type of soy based sauce, sweeter less salty version of soy sauce) salmon or tuna. Spicy version, and a honey garlic salmon. They put this on top of rice, with lots of various add ins and sauces. 

You can get pre made bowls or make your own. ($10-15). Small was good size for lunch. I was full up afterwards. Bowls have rice (white or brown), add ins like kimchi, avocado, corn, and toppings like seaweed and fried onion, as well as sauces like spicy aioli or creamy tobarashi. 

The amount of fish you get is good, I wouldn't say they skimped out. Just compared to in Hawaii, well, that's a different story. 

I completed my meal with dessert at Tsurji right around the corner"}
{"text":"The Hawaiian version of a burrito bowl. Mmm!

I tired the Cali bowl which is a mix of raw delicious salmon, tuna and salad in a bowl. You can either go with what's pre-defined or create your own bowl. I choose to leave it to the bowl experts at the shop.

Could defiantly be a little more liberal with the fish, but for under $12, it's expected. I'm sure their rent ain't cheap for being downtown and having 3 staff on hand (when I went), they have to make money some how.

Will defiantly come back for more, when I want a change from my usual burrito bowl at Burrito Boyz."}
{"text":"Had a poke bowl here with the brown rice base, a lot of different options for toppings and a few selection for salmon. I chose the wasabi sauce and it was enjoyable. A great place to grab a clean lunch!"}
{"text":"I've gone to poke guys on multiple occasions for lunch/dinner. The signature bowls are excellent. Tons of toppings and the flavours are all delicious. Great value. 

I usually pick up the Cali bowl. I used to order the bowl that came with pineapples. That had a really interesting flavour but that option has been discontinued. 

I wanted to give poke guys 5 stars, however, the last time I went for dinner, my partner and I had major intestinal issues that lasted for 2 days. I've been too afraid to return -- although I do miss their bowls. 

Perhaps if you decide to try Poke Guys, stick to lunchtime."}
{"text":"Hubby, Wifey and Porkiebun came here yet again with Hubby's brother to satisfy our poke craving after getting disappointed at another poke joint.

We just wanted to update our review and mention specifically about the consistency of quality service at each and every visit. Today's visit... while there was no customer in line, one of the girls at the counter came up to our little Porkiebun and gave her a treat (of course, after asking for our permission). Such amazing customer service at this place!"}
{"text":"Poke bowls, gotta try 'em all. 

After having tried various poke and poke-ish  (places that serve other things as their main thing, but also do poke on the side) spots in Toronto, I've concluded that Poke Guys is the best poke restaurant in the city, and is the one that is the most worth it.

I look at four things in poke: flavour, portion, price, location.

Flavour. A+. 100%. The many ingredient work well together. The rice is seasoned (some places don't do that!!!!!), the avocado is fresh (once again, some places don't do that!!!), and they don't skimp out on the fish (honestly, one of my biggest pet peeves).

Portion. Perfect!!! The regular was just right for me. The large was just right for my tall friends who need more calories.

Price. I don't have to sell an organ for a bowl of poke, so that's nice. But seriously, it's cheaper than a lot of the other poke places and the price-to-food ratio is probably the best in the city!

Location. It's a little bit further for me, but it's close enough that it's not that big of a deal.

Anyway, after my very extensive scientific study of poke restaurants, I conclude that this is the best poke place in Toronto."}
{"text":"My favourite spot in Toronto for poke bowls! Poke Guys uses large cut fish in their bowls, unlike many other joints which dices their fish into small pieces. There are a variety of signature bowls to choose from with many toppings to choose from. I highly recommend the Cali bowl which includes both salmon and tuna. 

Staff is also quick and friendly, so that's a bonus!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars because I walked in with big bright eyes and so much wonder but was left feeling sorely disappointed. 
 
Visited said establishment at 8pm and the place had 5 customers + 2 in line + me. Female employee who looked bored AF came to take my order. (Lucky me!) Ordered the Calis bowl due to the rave reviews and my first thought when she brought the bowl to the counter after scooping the brown rice and fish was, \"holy crap, how come there is so little salmon and ahi tuna?\" Looked to the order in front of mine (person also had a regular bowl but not sure if it was the Calis bowl) and he had a significantly larger portion of fish. My thought? WTF. I know the bowl is only $10.70 and one might argue, \"how much salmon/tuna are you expecting?\" Fine. Imma finish...

\"What kind of sauces do you want?\" 
\"What do you have?\"
*Points to board*

Female employee did not even look like she wanted to be there. Well, at least not around the customers because she looked like she was having a grand old time with her co-workers. At this point it reminds me of a prison line up for food. Shut up, tell them what you want, sit down and eat your food. The difference? I actually had to pay and I didn't sit down. Just for the record, it's not even that amazing and the fish is not as fresh as some of you say. I feel like they load up on toppings and sauce to make it gigantic and flavorful but you're only getting a few chunks of fish. 

I wanted this to be a memorable experience so I can take my story back to 'C Block'. But nah. So it's a nah to being a repeat offender, errrr customer."}
{"text":"We were starving by the time we got to Poke Guys so we thought it would be a great idea to each get a large poke bowl. Boy, were we in for a surprise. Each poke bowl was filled to the brim and we could barely finish them. The portion size was huge but that's not what made the bowls great. It was the freshness of the ingredients that made it so tasty. 

Cali Bowl - The combination of the the spicy aioli sauce plus raw salmon, avocado and warm rice was delicious. 

Mauna Loa Bowl - Spicy spicy spicy, everything was spicy in this bowl. If you are into hot foods, this is definitely one you should try. 

Atmosphere: Casual, fun and friendly. The interior was decorated with cool graphics on the walls, with a few tables and some window seating.  Staff are extremely friendly in giving suggestions on what sauces and garnishes go well with your bowl. 

Overall, a great place to grab a quick bite before a ball game or movie!!"}
{"text":"Good place for lunch, I keep coming back ever since it's open. Their ingredients are fresh and the portion is generous for a regular size bowl."}
{"text":"Pretty good! :) amazing prices, but the fish is more salty than I like can it's not as good as the Poke place on queen"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday to try this newcomer in the area. Restaurants fairly quiet for a Wednesday at noon. Apparently the week before there were long lineups but not this week. There is a menu and option to make your own poke bowl. Chose the Cali bowl on salad base. Asked for substitution for spicy poke and was told couldn't do it. Expected just a price increase for spicy on Cali bowl but the server didn't even offer to substitute even for additional price. Lady Server not friendly and didn't look like she enjoyed her time. The Cali bowl came with shoyu salmon and tuna poke mixed with soy sauce and some seasonings which was fine except it was a bit bland. Toppings were standard portions nothing out of ordinary. Overall regular poke place with option for customization but they seem inflexible for substitutions. Will try other places for poke."}
{"text":"Delicious poke bowl! Feels super healthy even though it is tasty and fresh. Suitable for lunch, dinner, families. Bright, clean. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"First time trying poke and The Poke Guys made the experience a beautiful one.

I went for their Cali Bowl and was not disappointed as it offered a great blend of flavours and taste into the world of poke.  It just works.

You get to try both the classic marinated salmon and tuna poke along with avocado, crab meat slaw, and fried onions.  I went ahead and added some corn and edamame beans to my bowl too. MmmmmmmmMmmMMMMm.

I think the price is very fair for something that is healthy, fresh, and filling.

Definitely will come back again when I am in the mood for poke."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place! I come here very regularly especially in the hot summer months, my husband and his coworkers are also  hooked and everyone I introduce to this place loves it. I recently pre-ordered 12 bowls for a work meeting and they came through with flying colours!  Many coworkers tried it for the first time and loved it. Fresh fish, delicious toppings and sauces and a very reasonable price point compared to many other poke joints. You can't go wrong and I... can't... stop eating poke!"}
{"text":"A Poke place with a vegan option.. I think I'm in heaven! I came by during their soft opening and left very satisfied. Poke Guys is bringing the classic Hawaiian dish to Toronto and doing it right. You can choose one of their 5 signature bowls, customize your own bowl, or just have an order of poke with no rice or toppings. Their vegetarian bowl (which is vegan friendly!!!) is made from marinated tofu and it's dang delicious! The tofu is silky and very flavourful. The rice was also on point (yes, not all rice is made equal) -not too mushy, not too hard.. Just the perfect texture and flavour. They didn't cheap out on the toppings either.. the bowl was filled to the brim with colourful, fresh toppings. I love that they cater to vegans despite poke being a fish dish traditionally. They also have a wide selection of sauces garnishes that you can top off your bowl with for free (yes, free things do taste better)! They also have spicy cucumber and kimchi for toppings which I am hands down all for. 

The space is also very nice - The decor is simple and sleek and the menu is beautifully written on chalkboards. There aren't many spots to sit as it is meant to be mainly a takeaway joint, but it's spacious enough to seat about 15. 

Poke Guys really impressed me with their flavour, variety, and individuality. I have yet to come across a poke place that is as accommodating to vegetarians/vegans as them. Definitely recommend it if you're looking for a fun and delicious spin on the classic Hawaiian dish!"}
{"text":"Wanna feel refreshed and healthy? You've got to try out one of their salads here - they're amazingly fresh and delish! If you are watchful of your budget, safest bet is to go with the classics. If you are undecided about the dressing - try wasabi mayo - it's so good and blends well with the classic salads' ingredients.  As I was eating the salad, it was reminiscent of the food we had had in Hawaii, and brought back so many good memories!!
 
Definitely worth your visit - at least once!"}
{"text":"good food, exceptional value, especially checking in via FB then you get $5 off"}
{"text":"I've had authentic Poke in Hawaii (Maui) and of course the freshness of the fish cannot compare. However, I've eaten at Poke guys several times since they opened, and was always impressed with the freshness of ingredients and portion size. 

However my last visit, i noticed that my Cali Bowl takeout order was extremely less in portion size. I dont know if its the new girl server, or if thats their new policy, but i received about 5 cubes of salmon (asked for salmon only) whereas i normally get like 15 cubes. Also the rice portion was way less, and i was still hungry once finished. I think they may have raised the prices too since its about $11.50 after tax and before was under $11. So overall not impressed, i might give it another try in the future, but that would be my last time if i had this experience again..... there's tons of other poke restaurants in the city, so dont limit yourself! The reason why Chiptotle and similar restaurants are successful is in the standardized portion control! Take note Poke Guys!"}
{"text":"Looking for a good Poke Bowl ? This is the place to get one. We had two of their signature bowls. The Cali Bowl and the Mauna Loa Bowl. Both we delicious and fresh. The Mauna Loa has just the right amount of heat to it. I added extra tuna to the Mauna Loa. Perfect serving size. I would recommend the regular bowl, it was just the right amount for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm actually surprised I'm enjoying this as much as I am. I'm not into hype, so poke being one of the foods of the moment, I was skeptical about how amazing Toronto's rendition was.

To be fair, I'm writing this not having been to Poke Guys. My brother brought a bowl back, and I'm eating it after it probably having been in the fridge for a few hours. That being said, I'm impressed by the amount of flavor in this bowl. I know I've got some sort of salmon poke and some sort of tuna poke, but it's everything else in the bowl that really gets me. We got white rice. There's wakame (seaweed salad), crab meat salad, avocado slices, edamame, spring mix and flying fish eggs on rice. Huh. I'm eating this as I write. There's also cucumber pieces, corn kernels, and kimchi. The kicker is whatever sauces is on there. The mayo one(s)? It's incredibly tasty. I could forgo the poke part and just have the sauce with the accompaniments. 

I'd actually be willing to come if I was in the area. I'm impressed.

Update: I've been informed that I'm eating a Cali bowl with stuff added to it. Original price $9 something."}
{"text":"I've ordered from here 5 times in the last week! Amazing poke, always fresh and flavourful."}
{"text":"Poke guys is amazing.  It's a healthy lunch with a Hawaiian take on good food.  The place is small and not on the main street but it has grown popular even after the promotion offer.  

Although you can choose your own toppings, I decided each of the three times to try a different signature bowl. The servers were nice and cheerful. When you settle on your order, the server will first layer a bed of rice and then top with a variety of items including tuna / salmon as your protein and then continue with veggies, edamame, seaweed salad, crab meat salad and corn plus other items of your choice.

Despite a 10 min walk from the office, I would go back and try to the other bowls.  The regular size is good enough for me but if I'm starving, I may upgrade to the large size.  The place has a few tables but I usually order take out."}
{"text":"Great new restaurant tucked away off Dundas street.

Poke Guys is a refreshing change to the restaurant landscape of Toronto. They offer a very popular version of a Hawaiian style dish called 'Poke' which is seasoned raw fish served with rice.

The dish is not comparable to the poke offered in Hawaii; however, it gets huge points for flavor and for offering a healthier alternative. 

Definitely worth the lunch time wait or sneek by before closing."}
{"text":"Not much of an ambiance but great food and a lot of seating for now. I expect it to get a lot busier with how fresh the food is."}
{"text":"Didn't try the original poke but the spicy tuna poke was delish! Regular size is pretty filling considering they pack the rice and don't skimp out on toppings. Spicy cucumber and yuzu mayo are delish. Tuna sells out quick though! Don't forget to add the fried onions!"}
{"text":"1st poke experience! almost gave up cuz had trouble looking for the tiny shop next to a dry-cleaner store.

The waitress was super helpful with recommendations, telling me what's popular, suggesting things that would go well together. NICE! also i liked that she arranged the ingredients carefully like creating art lol. pretty impressed, lots of fish, yum-o! 

Cali bowl is pretty freaking great. only issue was the tuna had a lot of stringy connective tissue-things. salmon was superb!"}
{"text":"Tried Poke Guys twice and can say this place is good if you're looking for something healthy in the area (eat your veggies!)...Will say that the marinade for the fish was too salty for me the 2nd time around =( 

I got the regular size PG's bowl both times I've been here and it had \"White rice (I opted for brown), salmon in classic shoyu, masago, edamame, kimchi, corn, fried onion, pickled red ginger, black & white sesame seeds\"

A regular bowl does keep me full and the bowls are very healthy. I will say that the create your own bowl isn't really value for your money considering each topping is $0.50+ 

I understand that the point of the fridge is to display the freshness or highlight the various types of fish available, but it actually causes some sort of traffic/bumping of the servers when they are making your bowls..maybe move the fish fridge to the end to optimize your assembly."}
{"text":"Came here to get my Mealpal lunch for only 18 cents. I love Poke bowls and haven't had one in a while prior to this. The Mealpal bowl had lots of good ingredients including salmon, corn, seaweed, coleslaw, spicy mayo and much more. Everything was good about the pokebowl except the rice. I felt the rice in the pokebowl wasn't as fresh as I thought it would be. I tasted like it was a few days old. In terms of portion, it's pretty good for the regular size. They also have the larger pokebowls if you want something more filling. Aside from the signature bowls they create, you can also build your own bowl. Overall the pokebowl was good. Nice location. There is some seating here but mostly it's designed as a takeout place."}
{"text":"Poke guys serves up great poke bowls given that you put the right combination of toppings and ingredients together. 

I went with Poke Guy's signature Cali bowl which included shoyu marinated salmon and tuna, crab slaw, and avocado as the main toppings. I then proceeded to add some various garnishes and went with creamy togarashi and spicy aoili for the sauces. And voila! The bowl is complete and looks absolutely delish.

The poke was a joy to eat because of all the individual components coming together, and having a party in your mouth. And while the California bowl was good, the combination of flavours could have flowed better. This was mostly coming from the soy marinated tuna and salmon, which was rather heavy and overpowering on the umami side. The bowl was missing an integral sweet component and hence, you're better off customizing your own bowl, built to suit each and everyone's own taste buds. For example, seaweed salad, pineapple, or even corn could have elevated this bowl to the next level (which are toppings you can add)

That being said, I recommend going for their custom bowls which you can even 'recreate' the exact signature bowl, and customize, all for a buck less."}
{"text":"Cali bowl and ai hou hui bowl are the way to go here! I would say out of the three poke joints in Toronto this place does it best

Don't expect it to be on the same level as Hawaii or Cali...we aint living next to the ocean so fish ain't gonna be cheap and plentiful!"}
{"text":"We keep returning to this spot because of it's convenient central location. 

Food wise it has fallen into the 'meh' category. Portions are still generous but I'm really not a fan of protein that's scooped out of a bowl of marinade that's been sitting in it for who knows how long.  The fresh fish becomes rubbery, looses texture and taste from being over denatured.

The rest of the ingredients making up the various bowls are fine but there's no layers of flavour. It all tastes like a mashup."}
{"text":"There wasn't a line when I went but quickly got busy from time to time. The menu is concise and small so it was easy to choose. I chose the cali bowl and it was really good. The fish pieces are good bite sized cubes and it tasted really good with hot rice on the bottom with the other garnishes and fresh ingredients. There's a lot going on in the bowl and it made me full really fast. It looks small, but it's very hearty. So many toppings! The only thing was that the fish wasn't the freshest but other then that it was good. I'd like to go try the PG bowl next time :)"}
{"text":"You know I never thought Poke Bowl would be something I would enjoy, but when I got my first bite in this, I couldn't stop eating it! This place been very busy since they opened so I never really came here until last week when my colleagues and I made the walk there to grab one of the famous Poke Bowls for lunch.

Lineup was okay, waited around 3 minutes and placed my Cali's Bowl order and the process was quite fast.  I am very happy they got numerous toppings that are essentially free and the selection of sauces are amazing.  I went with the Creamy Togarashi which was sort of the sesame salad dressing sauce you get from japanese restaurants.  I loved the combinations of rice, salmon poke, crab meat and the sauce paring was a perfect match.

Really enjoyed this place and could be a place I would visit more often for lunch if I am feeling to pay over $10 for a lunch in downtown."}
{"text":"Good potion and quality compared to the the other places. 

Ordered the signature Cali bowl and wasn't disappointed, found that it was good value compared to some other places (eg. Rolltation). Flavours were good , but ordereing does take a bit off time though / could be faster."}
{"text":"My favorite Poke in town after trying more than 10 different places !
Food is fresh and so good, the only negative note is the schedule... they close way TOO early.
But good job guys, 5 stars"}
{"text":"Went here with 3 of my friends today for our first times trying Poke. It was around a 10 min walk. We all ordered the Cali bowl (a signature bowl amongst about 6? options). Then you can get add ons with your bowl (like fried onions, nori, sesame) and different sauces (ex. spicy aioli). My total was around $11. 

The fish was good - if it was Japanese, it would be good sashimi. It was fresh and the salmon was nice and fatty. It was served on a bed of rice, a choice of white or brown rice (I got white rice and was worried that it would be plain white rice. But it was actually sushi rice!) They mixed the fish with onions and shallots but the taste wasn't that strong ( i HATE onions and shallots so this is saying a lot ), barely tasted it. To me that's a good thing lol. They also gave us half an avocado (!!!!!!!), some spring mix leaves, and crab meat slaw (a little too hard for my liking). Overall our experience here was really good! I may be back when I'm back to Eaton's Centre. However, if you're looking for sushi and sashimi, you might be better off going to a Japanese restaurant. If you want to try sushi/ sashimi as something new , give this place a try. :)"}
{"text":"This was my first Poke experience, and all I can say is MIND BLOWN. The fish is fresh, the rice cooked to perfection, and the owners super friendly. Make sure to try the wasabi mayo on the traditional salmon.

Great lunch idea if you work around University and Dundas."}
{"text":"+1 great tasting
+1 Much more healthy than a bowl of Chipotle. However not as filling
+1 Big size is sharable for 2
+1 nice place sit down 
-1 no wow factor, just a bowl of mixed food

I got california ginger yuzu sauce. Pair it with a fruity rum highball and it will be great.

Probably will still go to Chipotle more because more filling."}
{"text":"Great value for money!  Super generous portions - a regular is big enough!  Had the Volcano Bowl.  Only thing I would add is avocado to balance the heat."}
{"text":"Fresh, flavorful and healthy food at fast food speeds.

I'm not a fan of raw fish so I'll rate PG through the taste buds of my hubby. We ordered the regular sized PG's bowl (white rice, salmon, corn, masago, edamame, kimchi, white and black sesame, fried onion and pickled red ginger) added octopus ($5 ouch!) topped with wasabi sauce and the Cali bowl (white rice, salmon, tuna, crab meat slaw, masago, avocado, black and white sesame, fried onion and nori bits) topped with spicy aioli sauce.

Bowls are deceptively small but they are extremely filling and the harmony of flavors definitely left us satiated and full. There's a sign on their board that suggests you eat your bowl within 30 minutes for maximum freshness. Hubby enjoyed the Salmon, tuna and octopus but his favorite was the Salmon.

Shout out to Cindy L. whose review and encouragement led us here."}
{"text":"If you say Poke Guy 10 times quickly you may get a slap across the face from a pretty Chinese lady.
Nonetheless PG has been here since the summer, serving up some fusion Japanese Hawaiian dishes: edamame beans, ginger tuna, seaweed salad, crab salad, etc are just some of their freshly served ingredients all displayed.
Coming here Saturday evening, finding a seat is very...VERY limited as its not your traditional sit down restaurant.
The concept is open, clean and the service is efficient.  Small bowls are approximately $10+ tax, large is $12+ tax.
I ordered their Hui Hou bowl served with rice, seaweed salad, edamame beans, fresh ginger tuna with a whole lot of goodness.  Their large bowl is a substantial portion! Your bowl also comes with other condiments such as crispy garlic, etc.
JC had their small Cali Bowl which she barely finished and had to takeaway, her verdict...TBD lol.

Cleanliness 2.5/5
Service 5/5
Value 5/5"}
{"text":"Poke Guys.....  while their portions have gotten just a tad smaller since they first opened, it's still a very generous portion designed to fill you up.   The poke is pre-marinated so it actually has flavour and they are very generous with the sides and toppings...which I absolutely love.   All of their toppings are always fresh...and they will keep adding toppings to the bowl till you say stop!   

I love the Poke Guys.   While it's a little hidden right off of Dundas street on Elizabeth, it's easy to get to.  The lunch crowd is a dedicated one, we usually try to get our bowls in before the lunch rush and there's a decent lineup.  I can see why...fresh ingredients, great location, very generous portions, healthy options ...it's all the good stuff and more!

My fav...Cali Bowl....because avocado with tuna AND salmon is definitely my thing.

Their new menu item:  Mauna Loa Volcano bowl....the spicy seaweed and spicy cucumbers are FREAKING AWESOME!    The jalapeños are a tad too much spice for me...but the rest of it was yummy and I love it.    I've eaten at a lot of poke places...this is the only one I've given a solid 5 stars to.   Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Probably the most reasonably priced poke bowl place I've seen. 

I made my own bowl and they provided a healthy portion of everything. 

Too bad the location could be better."}
{"text":"Tried Poke Guys out during Poke week. I had the Poke Week Special - It had salmon, tuna, crab meat, avocado, spicy sauce, sesame seeds and rice. It was quite delicious. I did find that they put too much sauce in the rice bowl though, that overpowered the other ingredients... Otherwise this was pretty good."}
{"text":"I ordered the Cali Bowl and when I started eating it, the combination of flavours were unbelievable. The salmon and tuna were fresh. Toppings  and sauce were right on but when I dig in to the rice that's where it went downhill! The rice was undercooked and hard! 

C'mon people it's not hard to make a rice even kids nowadays can do it! So not sure why you have to mess up a good dish with an undercooked rice. And to think that you were using a rice cooker! 

So disappointed to pay $11 for a half-eaten meal!"}
{"text":"Gave them a second try, was definitely better than my first time. I underestimated how spicy the spicy seaweed salad and spicy octopus would be though"}
{"text":"Poke guys, as you can imagine, specializes in poke bowls, which basically is marinated raw fish, various combinations of toppings (e.g. kimchi, corn, avocado, salad, crab meat slaw etc etc etc) on top of a soft bed of rice. I've been here several times already and I've tired the Cali bowl, the PG's bowl, and the A Hui Hou bowl.  I haven't yet ventured into the create your own bowls yet but I'm? interested in trying that next time! So far all the ones I've tried have been delicious! My favorite so far is probably the Cali bowl! The fish is fresh the marinade is delicious, and all the toppings, even though it doesn't seem like they'd go together, surprisingly blends so nicely together! In addition, each bowl is $10.50 and it's a lot of food for that price! 
Yummy food, good value, I'm definitely gonna be back for more!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick lunch here before a meeting the other day. The location is on a side street and easy to miss; however, the joint is very popular and the line was extending out of the store when I got there (around 12:50pm on a Thursday).

Service was quick. I got the Cali Bowl from other Yelp recommendations and it did not disappoint! The spicy aioli sauce added some great flavour. A regular sized bowl was large enough for me, though you can opt for a large as well.

I really enjoyed this place. Would recommend!

Update: Came back again for a second time and it was still as good as the last. Love it."}
{"text":"Glad to see BYO poke places are popping up here in Toronto, but I think I've been spoiled by poke shops in California so this place wasn't spectacular.

Toppings start at $0.50 each which can get extremely pricey if you pile them on. I would stick with the signature bowls since you get around 3 toppings added already. Signature bowls are $1 more than build your own, and the build your own starts with no toppings -just the base, fish, and sauce.

I got the Cali bowl which had salmon and tuna already marinated in shoyu and tossed with cucumber, white rice, avocado, greens, and crab salad. The crab salad was made out of imitation crab sticks instead of shredded imitation crab. Not a huge deal but it made it a little hard to eat.

I feel like poke places will get big in Toronto soon, if they aren't already popular, and I have high hopes that if Poke Guys makes the necessary adjustments and listens to customer feedback they will definitely be amazing!

Kudos to the staff who are very friendly!!"}
{"text":"Such good poke! They have generous sizes which is great because most places downtown give so much less food in the bowl. Definitely worth trying if you like poke"}
{"text":"Quickly becoming a favourite place of mine, but you have to get there early to avoid the lunch time rush.  I think I've had the california bowl or something a few times.  I'm too un-advernturous to try something else.  I need tuna and avocados in my life.  Sometimes they go pretty heavy with the spicy mayo.  I should totally get that on the side.  Maybe next time.  It's really tasty though and the portion sizes are pretty reasonable."}
{"text":"I've been eyeing to come here for since they've opened and finally I had the opportunity and it was worth the trip. They didn't disappoint. 

I ordered the regular size ($10) Cali Bowl + spicy mayo sauce + green onion + pickled ginger. The portion was good. I was getting quite full and I can eat. I didn't have my lunch until 4:30 pm so I can say that it wasn't busy. I can see that lunch and dinner time being a popular spot.

Decor is simple. The staff are nice. I would definitely come back and try the other bowls."}
{"text":"My friend and her partner brought me to Poke Guys for lunch while I was at work.  I had seen some not so positive reviews online but wanted to give it a try.

Poke Guys is a small, generally not super accessible restaurant offering Poke style bowls.  The meals are served cafeteria style.  The place was really packed so I was not able to see if the bathrooms are gendered.  You can totally have a vegan bowl, but your only option for protein is tofu.  If you're okay with that, it's awesome, but if you don't or can't do tofu, don't eat here!

I was pretty happy with the price to value ratio offered.  The options and ingredients were innovative and fresh.

It's too bad the place is so small.  The atmosphere is certainly lacking.  The staff generally look tired and overworked.  During the 40 minutes I was there, they served at least 30 people.  It's also really difficult to get a cup of water."}
{"text":"Been here twice in the last month - one for lunch for a full bowl, and one for a fish craving for dinner after work.

With the customized bowl, I thought it was a little deceiving because the standard price only covers fish + rice... anything like vegetables, and sides, you have to pay at least 50 cents to a dollar for. It would have been nice to have a customized bowl come with 1 - 2 of these options. Afterall, you wouldn't have a bowl with just fish and rice (see Salad days for inspiration). The flavours were clean and the compilation and presentation is clearly beautiful with an assortment of colours from the fish, veg, toppings, and sauce. I have no complaints!

Second time - I purchased a small container of poke - straight up raw fish to go. I preferred to do my own thing in terms of seasoning and flavours since I was using it to compliment my meal, so I opted for plain fish as is. One thing I learned is that chopped fish is good enough to eat raw, but I don't know to what extent it is full sashimi grade. It is cut differently and it will not be as soft as tender as you expect. However, it was tasty and for $11, it is a pretty good portion.

I'm interested to try some other poke places.... it's madness here in TO!"}
{"text":"First time I've had poke and it was pretty darn good! Really refreshing and tasty. Everything was fresh and restaurant was clean. Taking a star off because the rice was a little undercooked which was really distracting while eating."}
{"text":"Been hearing about poke bowls for a while now from my friend's in NYC. I just figured it's a chirashi bowl (which it kinda is), but I have to say, it's pretty damn good. I've been a few times, and I like to build my own bowl.

I like the variety of toppings and proteins. there's a variety of crunchy, spicy, umami, and pickled elements. The one thing I would like to see is a quinoa base. I don't know if it's a healthy meal option or not, but it gives me the illusion of being one, so that's good enough for me."}
{"text":"Wanted to try some of their new bowls. I had the Volcano Bowl, which has spicy salmon. I enjoy my spicy food and the interesting thing about this bowl was that different ingredients had different levels of spiciness. The salmon and spicy (red coloured) seaweed was very manageable. Then I bit down on the cucumber and I was very surprised that it had a jalapeño-like taste and then the hotness jumped at me. I kind of enjoyed the varying spicy items, I could literally pick what I wanted without being overwhelmed by the spiciness. As for the salmon, it was soft and tasty as last time. The edamame gave the bowl a nice crispy texture. And just like last time, the large bowl was surprisingly filling. I couldn't finish the entire bowl. Next time, I'm going to try the wasabi octopus bowl."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, I've been to Hawaii... numerous times.  I've had Poke in Hawaii... numerous times.  

Ok, with that out of the way, Is Poke Guys a solid place to get good Poke ?  Absolutely.
Is it the best Poke I've had... not even close.  

Kudos to Poke Guys, you have a few signature items and then there is a wide variety of items to do the \"Build you own\".  

I decided to do the build your own as each of the signature bowls had something that I thought was either, not my fave, or it sounded like a weird combo.  

Since it was my first time there, and I told the guy he walked me through the ordering process.  Great job on that and kudos for taking the time.  The one thing about building your own Poke bowl... there is no waiting for someone to serve you... you build it, you eat it.  
I had decided to go for a large and I added one of the premium toppings... so with a drink I was up over $20.  Not exactly cheap for Poke, but hey, this is Canada, and Poke is a Hawaiian thing.  

Once I got my bowl I sat down to chow down.  It was pretty good.  Salmon was nice and fresh, the wasabi cream had a bit of kick but not so hot as to burn the hair out of your nostrils.  All the other adds were definitely nice and fresh.  My only complain, the rice.  Ya, I know Rice !  it either hadn't been cooked long enough, or it had been refrigerated too long... it was a bit hard.   

Overall, I like the place and the choice of toppings.  Poke is all about the fish and Poke Guys delivered on that.  The rice wasn't quite right, but service was good and staff were helpful.  I think the only other thing about this place is they had some very strange rap music playing, but that could just be the staff at the time and their playlist.    Yup, it's a solid place, and I'll go back when I need another Poke fix !  But I'd rather make a trip to Hawaii and get the real stuff !"}
{"text":"Ordered poke guys from uber eats late last night. I ordered a large Cali bowl with spicy aioli and my boyfriend got a large custom bowl (salmon shoyu, brown rice, kimchi, tagaroshi mayo). I really enjoyed the taste of both, though it was quite doused in sauce. I loved the big chunks of fish, and it was plentiful too! Having gone to Hawaii last year, I'd say the poke bowls here are very delicious but have more of a modern take than what is traditionally offered. 

The bowls are better value if you purchase in-restaurant than via uber eats. I don't use uber eats that much, so maybe everyone already knows about this, but I think I paid a bit more to use the service. For example, based on some existing photos, it looks like a large poke bowl is $14.50 but via uber, a large was $16.50. 

Also as a side note, when my order got here, it was a small cali bowl instead of the large one, which is what I ordered. Had to make a couple of calls to the restaurant and uber eats, but it was solved with a refund relatively quickly. Was also offered a complimentary bowl next time I visited, which was super awesome of them.  Thumbs up, Poke guys, for taking care of this so promptly! Looking forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The first time I had Poke it wasn't very good at all. I didn't even know it was one of the latest food crazes to hit Toronto, so I just didn't understand what all the fuss was about. And then thankfully we hit up the Poke Guys for a Yelp event -- life changed.

Basically this has become one of my most-favourite things to eat, and when I'm in the mood for Poke (which is a lot) then I grab it from Poke Guys. The bowls all taste amazing, and they're loaded with ingredients. And not just crammed with tons of rice, but all the good stuff like tuna, salmon, greens, veggies, avocado, etc.

I've not ventured off the signatures and created my own because I don't trust myself to get the flavour combinations correct. So I usually stick with the Cali, Veggie, or PG's. You can't go wrong with any of these sure-shots. Ingredients are all fresh and delicious!

Service is always great and friendly. There's usually 2-3 people behind the counter at all times so when they line-ups begin you get your food rather quickly. Location is a little hidden down a side street, but well worth the hunt.

I've only tried a small handful of Poke places in the city, but this is easily my favourite."}
{"text":"Tried a custom poke bowl before a greyhound bus ride as it seems to be quite the fade lately. I definitely enjoyed it! The food was fresh and healthy tasting and it was quick to order. The portions are quite large and definitely satisfying. It is on the expensive side though, I wasn't aware that a bunch of my toppings I was adding (ie seaweed salad and corn) is an additional $0.50 so my bowl ended up being $13 which was pricier than I imagined. I would come here again and order a signature dish though if I wanted something healthy."}
{"text":"Had a regular Cali bowl which was amazing with spicy aioli. The crab meat slaw I believe was so refreshing and good with the sushi rice, and whatever was crunchy in it was nice for texture. Both the salmon and tuna was nicely seasoned. In addition, I added seaweed salad which went well with the bowl as well. MUST TRY. Very pleasant and did not get a stomach ache as I usually do when eating poke bowls or sushi burritos."}
{"text":"This place was just OK for me. Long lineups are fine but they really need to move, especially during lunch time - 10 minutes in line waiting to order with 4 people in front of me isn't acceptable. I ordered a PG bowl with no rice and it totally threw them off. I felt bad for getting mildly frustrated with the girl that worked there, but I honestly didn't know how to be more clear. Food was pretty good though - everything was fresh with a decent amount of fish, very flavourful, and satisfying - but the long lineup and the complete inability of the counter staff to process a \"no rice\" request without making me feel awkward and bizarre will probably keep me from going back."}
{"text":"Checked this out after some friends recommended this place to me.  It was better than I expected.  Thought I'd need 2 bowls to satisfy my hunger but one regular bowl was enough.  I ordered the Cali bowl which included salmon and tuna.  The marinade they used made it hard to tell which fish pieces were tuna and which was salmon.  If you aren't picky about salmon or tuna, you should get salmon because you'll get more fish.  I liked how they let you pick what sauces you want and also the garnishes.  The fried onions and sea weed added a lot extra of flavour to the bowl.  I'd give it 4 stars and added an extra star for the facebook check in  promo they were running."}
{"text":"This was my first experience with Poke, and let me say I'm a fan! 

I opted for the Cali bowl (tuna, salmon, crab, avocado, etc.) and personalized it with the addition of kimchi, wakame and a few other things. Loved that you can choose between brown and white rice as well.

The final bowl weighed like 5 lbs...and I ate most of it! Everything tasted fresh and delicious, huge chunks of fish. Friendly service. Loved it."}
{"text":"Pros: flavourful, lots of topping choices, fish was fresh. Bowls were yummy, and I love the option of purchasing just poke and not the entire bowl (ie just the marinated fish). 

Cons: price 

Worth trying, and definitely worth treating yourself to if you are a poke fan."}
{"text":"Came here last summer/fall and was very pleased with the food. Fresh tasting and well seasoned - made a point to come again. 
This time, I learned they delivered with DoorDash so I tried it. On DoorDash, items are $2.5 more expensive, and the website charges a service fee ($1.35ish) and delivery fee ($1.99). The promo code POKEGUYS gives $5off though so I still ended up going through with the order. Estimated 50min delivery for 1pm on a Sun, ended up being ~30mins. 
Overall, food was still as good as I remember. A little bit less fish given than last year (now it's like 5 cubes of salmon and 4 of tuna in the Cali bowl) but the bowl was stuffed to the brim. I selected brown rice on DoorDash but got white rice.. Not sure if that's the fault of the restaurant or ordering platform but I'm not picky enough to argue about that - others may be though."}
{"text":"Small takeout style place that serves one thing only: poke bowls (as its name would suggest). They have several preset combinations to choose from or you can build your own, which will most likely end up more expensive as their base price is considerably high. 

I ordered the PG Bowl to go for lunch on a Saturday. No line ups, restaurant half seated. I'm not sure I am a fan of marinated salmon. It comes across a little more slimy than usual. Chunks are a little too big, as most reviews have commented, but understandable as they sit in marinade and would be much saltier if in any smaller size. Rice was cooked well and other ingredients fresh. I felt the kimchi was a little overpowering, but an interesting addition.

Price is reasonable, cheaper than competitors in the area (Rolltation, I'm looking at you). Tucked away a little distance from Dundas, this is worth a try."}
{"text":"The restaurant is tucked in a side street just off busy Dundas and Bay, so it's easy to miss if you aren't looking for it. Craving something healthy but more substantial than a salad? A poke bowl is the perfect choice. There are several suggested combinations or you can make your own if you know exactly what you like and how you like it. 

The components seem typically the same: a base of rice or salad, a generous scoop with marinated chunks of raw fish and your choice of toppings and sauces. No matter what you pick you end up with a bowl of fresh, healthy and delicious meal. The portions are big also, a regular bowl is more than enough for one person and could easily be split between two people looking for a smaller meal."}
{"text":"I love poke guys. Yes it is pretty expensive ($11ish for regular size and $14/15 for large) but I think it's super worth it. I always get a large because it gives you a lot more food. My go to is the A Hui Hou Bowl with all toppings and Yuzu mayo. The portion of main protein (raw salmon) they give you is actually a lot which makes the price more worth it. They allow you to either start from scratch or choose from their creations. All in all, poke guys might be the top poke place in Toronto so I highly recommend trying it out."}
{"text":"Of all the places I've tried so far, Poke Guys keeps being my favourite place and always makes me wanting to go back. They are normally quite generous with salmon and tuna chunks. These chunks feel so fresh and therefore tasty. The added soy sauce also adds some flavour to it."}
{"text":"I had their Cali bowl 2 days ago but I am writing a review now cause I just saw their ad somewhere so I came back to check their rating. 

Reading from the comments above, I discovered that I am not the only one who experienced their bad edamame! Their edamame tasted so weird I am guessing they have been sitting there for a very long time... Other than that, the rice wasn't great either. It was very hard to chew. So I end up throwing out my poke away cause it made me hesitate whether their other ingredients are fresh or not. There goes my $10. What a waste! :("}
{"text":"I got the regular sized Cali bowl here for lunch and as someone with a smaller appetite, I think its very filling. I liked the variety I got from choosing what toppings and condiments I wanted but I felt the Cali bowl that I got was too mushy/creamy for my preference. I think it's the combination of the crab slaw and the fact that they added extra mayo to my poke bowl."}
{"text":"Poke Guys is tucked away on Elizabeth St. near Yonge/Dundas.  There are a number of good eateries in the surrounding area but Poke Guy is among the best for its food quality, quick service, and price point. I came here on a Saturday night and it was relatively quiet.  It's set up like a fast food joint where you order at the counter, pick your toppings/sauces, and there is cafeteria style seating in the dining area.  I ordered a regular size Cali bowl and it was EXCEPTIONAL. I was most impressed by the portions of fish and its quality (very fresh). Even the slices of avocado were fairly generous. I was honestly expecting them to skimp out on both... But was pleasantly surprised. I topped my bowl with spicy aioli  and the ginger yuzu mayo.... Ahh, it was truly heaven in a bowl!  Service was also quick and friendly, I had a few questions about the menu seeing as it was my first time and the two ladies were both nice and informative.  The dude seated next to me ordered a large size bowl and it was massive.  I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Following a discussion with Jenn (the owner) privately after she reached out to me, I've decided to give Poke Guys a second go and this time was significantly better. Apart from my own order (which I did not disclose myself till the very end to the cashier), the portions were on average about 80% improving on consistency. I've seen the bowls fill up more accordingly than the last time I experienced which I am generally pleased about their commitment to work on consistency truly acknowledging the reviewers from fellow Yelpers.

I had a brief conversation with the cashier in which she told me that standardizing the portions has been one of their working areas of improvement so I am bumping my rating back up to a 4-star to commend their efforts in hearing with the other Yelpers and the owner's active participation to ensure that quality and consistency is still one of their core values."}
{"text":"Yum.  Poke guys is me of my favourite go-lunch joints. Apparently Imn not the only one since there's regularly lines that go along the sidewalk during standard lunch hours.  The staff is very efficient and the line moves fairly well. 

The food is delicious and fresh! My favourite are the Cali bowl and the hou hui (?) bowls. Definitely a must try."}
{"text":"I'm amazed by the consistent high ratings Poke Guys have been getting from foodies all over town. Which makes me question, how come my bowl did not receive the same treatment.

Let me start off by saying that I've not had a wide variety of poke bowls across town, but I've had enough to justify the points in this review. These points are mostly relevant to price to value ratio, and the quality of the ingredients.

Poke Guy's variety is on point, with many choices and hundreds of permutations from the build-it-yourself menu. The restaurant trusts your ability to build a stunning poke bowl, and often advises you on which combination makes a winning bowl, nice.

But upon tasting, the salmon I ordered had a distinctive fishy smell, that often comes from salmon that was stored too long. Since I opted for the marinaded salmon, the texture of it is  also chewy and firm to the taste. Some may find that texture weird, in which I suggest the non-marinaded fishes instead. The rest of the dish's components were fine, ranging from $0.50 to $1.00 per topping. However, the fishy smell and the squishiness of the fish subsequently killed off the rest of the dish, regardless of the other components. This was not a problem with other poke bowl locations.

Price is competitive with other poke locations, but expect to pay higher if you like to load it up with toppings, but be careful with the main star of the dish, the fish itself. It just might make or break your bowl."}
{"text":"Place was busy, looked really good when we ordered 2 Cali bowls and a \"make your own\".  Sat down to eat and immediately disappointed with the salmon.  Poor quality, not cut properly (gray fibrous layer not removed) and my daughter's salmon was still in a clump - not cut through.  Will not return a second time."}
{"text":"My first bowl of poke was extra special because not only was it really darn delicious, but it was my first Yelp Elite event!
The Poke Guys were great and loaded up my spicy Ahi Tuna bowl with a bounty of colour and deliciousness. The bowl weighed a hefty pound or two, but that didn't stop me from eating every single morsel... with pleasure.
The gentleman who crafted my poke bowl did it with excellent suggestions and an artistic touch.
If you've not tried the latest fad to hit the streets of TO get yo'self to The Poke Guys and see for yoursel


PS if you haven't tried for Elite or attended an event, do it! I had a great time and met some wonderful people."}
{"text":"I think what distinguishes a good restaurant from a bad one is not only the food but the attitude of the staff! 
I have been here a few times and as obviously mentioned before in many reviews by people, they can be easily missed as it is on a side street. The novelty of having sushi in a bowl is great but the place is unnecessarily expensive and they don't let you customize your bowls for a cheap price! On top of all of this, the staff is super rude and entitled! ( I don't know why, they only have line ups because the staff is snail paced and the restaurant is literally shoebox sized)

Want something similar but wayyy better service and customization.. please head to Rollatation a few steps west on Dundas. They might be the same price but way better ingredients and service!
Disclosure- I have no conflict of interest with Rollatation .. just trying to give an honest review of the place!"}
{"text":"First time having a poke bowl!!!  I ordered a regular size of the Hui Hou Bowl which comes with white rice, crab meat slaw, seaweed salad, masago, fried onions, black and white sesame, salmon (I requested for spicy salmon instead) and edamame (they ran out so I opted for kimchi).  The salmon sashimi was fresh and very flavourful.  They gave adequate amount of toppings.  There was also \"just enough\" rice in the bowl.  There's also a variety of garnishes and sauces you can choose from.  This bowl was filling and satisfied my tummy.  I love to eat food with a variety of toppings so I definitely enjoyed this meal.  

They currently have a special- if you check in on Facebook by September 4, you can get a regular size signature poke bowl for $5."}
{"text":"Poke Guys! Love Love love this place! I think so far i've eaten here around rather 5 times or so. Poke never gets old and always crave for some hawaii food. 

I know I should change it up time to time every time I go but I end up always just ordering the same bowl every time because it is just that tasty imo. The bowl I usually get every time is the Cali Bowl. It is a fresh combination of white or brown rice (your choice), salmon & tuna shoyu, crab meat slaw, masago, avocado, fried onions, nori, B&W sesame seeds. To add more tasty ingredients I like to add avocado, corn crab meat and sometimes seaweed salad. Avocados and crab meat are extra, I think like $2 each? 

But with all those toppings mixed together makes a delicious and fresh poke bowl. All the ingredients are fresh and tastes great when mixed together. The fish grade is also really good at this place too. I can tell the sashimi grade they use is much better than other shops. I normally get a large bowl which is around like $14?  If your super hungry I recommend you upping the size up to a large since it is only like $2--$3 more from a regular bowl so it's pretty worth it. 

Did I mention I love this place? Probably already did 10000X times.. Service is great, alot of cool people working there too. It's also super close to Eatons centre too and if your craving for bubble tea Chatime is just across the street =)"}
{"text":"We are staying at Ronald McDonald House while our daughter undergoes treatment. Having an alternative to hospital food makes a big difference - and with it only a couple blocks away it makes for a nice day all break and a perfect meal

I had the angry shrimp and my husband had the volcano bowl - both perfect and made even better from listening to the dr swing recommendations from the staff."}
{"text":"Delicious food for a fair price, not to mention that it's healthy. They offer a variety, and also customization. The atmosphere is alright, it resembles more of a fast food grab and go type. It's not spacious, thus has limited seating. It tends to be always crowded due to store size..."}
{"text":"Went to Poke Guys for lunch today and it was great! Had the PG Signature bowl with marinated salmon, kimchi and spicy aioli. The fish was very fresh and buttery in texture and the bowl was delicious overall. Great service and location. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Hands down best poke place I've tried 

You MUST try the Cali Bowl, it's amazing! I get it every time with wasabi mayo. The salmon is so so so fresh and the sauces and toppings are on point. Seriously you have to try it!! Ask for the brown rice! 

The staff are so kind and friendly, it makes the whole experience better. I once called to see if I could order ahead of time and they made an exception for me! 

It's not really a sit-down type of restaurant in my opinion. I prefer to grab and go because it's always so busy when I go. Poke guys is incredibly fresh and tasty for \"fast food\".

In terms of price, I do consider it a pricier meal (small bowl around $11.95 and a large being $14.95) but a small bowl is extremely filling! There's been a few instances when a small bowl became 2 meals for me because I couldn't finish it in one sitting. So to me, it's DEFINITELY worth !!"}
{"text":"Hi! I've had authentic poke in Hawaii before and I really enjoyed it, so I'm really happy that poke is now quite trendy in Toronto. I read through the reviews beforehand where people are dissatisfied with the restaurant, but I had a lovely experience overall. 

Poke guys is perennially busy. We went around dinner time and all the tables were filled up with people chatting and eating happily. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and I'm a big fan of the large number of choices you have to customize your poke bowl. We ordered two signature bowls, and the regular size filled me up just fine. 

We swapped out white rice for brown rice, but otherwise we got the Cali Bowl and PG's Bowl. They're both delicious! They're very generous with the salmon and ahi portions, and the huge chunks of fish were so numerous that I really couldn't finish them all.

It's cheaper if you customize it yourself, and they also have veggie-only options for vegetarians. You can pick a base (white rice, brown rice, or vegetables), protein (salmon, tuna, or tofu) a ton of different toppings, a couple of sauces, and as many garnishes as you want. 

I'll be coming back when it's less busy, but I'm very happy with the service and quality of the food :) 

Favorites: crab meat slaw!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of poke bowl but unfortunately this one fell flat. I got their PG bowl mainly because they charge extra for each topping. I'm used to places where you can get as many toppings as you want. This really limited my experience. They had a very limited selection of toppings and garnishes to begin with. The serving size was decent and the fish seemed fresh. Service was not great. I had asked for two bowls and they only made one for me before serving the people behind me in line. I think the server had some trouble understanding English."}
{"text":"First off buy their signature bowls because woth the bulk your own bowl very  ingredient is extra cost I had the spicy salmon poke they should focus on just the fish I'd they want to nake authentic  Hawaiian food because I feel like I'm in a another Japanese restaurant not coming back here again trying it once is good enough for me"}
{"text":"Not the biggest fan of this place only because the Poke Bowls are way too saucy to the point you can't even taste the fish (ordered the Cali bowl last time). The portions are reasonable and the price isn't too expensive either."}
{"text":"Tried this place out a few weeks ago with friends. The line was long but moved fairly quickly. I had a custom bowl. It was my first time trying poke and it was pretty good. I love sushi so this was basically sushi in a bowl with cool toppings :)"}
{"text":"Great poke! The owner is very lovely! There was a small mistake made and it was very efficiently and quickly corrected."}
{"text":"My first poke bowl was from here and it's delicious. The staff was super friendly and helped me browse the different options. I like how they also have the make your own option but I recommend their menu items!"}
{"text":"To be honest I was quite disappointed by this place... I tried the create-your-own poke bowl with the classic shoyu tuna poke. Thought they could be a little more generous with the poke... And the sauce overpowered the flavor in the fish. Toppings at $0.50 each weren't all very fresh... My avocado was kind of brown and they were kind of stingy with the toppings. Also the spicy mayo sauce wasn't very good either (too creamy, not enough of a kick). All in all, not sure if I'll be back."}
{"text":"I got a regular sized custom bowl. Essentially it's the signature Cali bowl but I replaced the salmon with spicy salmon, crab meat, tuna, seaweed salad, white rice, and dried watermelon crest (pink, pretty, and tastes like a radish). For sauce I got wasabi mayo and spicy aioli. 

This is my first poke bowl and it was delicious. The flavours were good. I really liked the crab meat which I was surprised about. If I could go back, I would have made both the tuna and salmon spicy. The regular sized bowl is filling. So ask for \"less rice\". I would definitely come back. I also met two of the owners and they're pretty awesome."}
{"text":"I had their cali bowl last week and it was amazing! Everything about the bowl was super fresh and worth the money! I am so excited that they opened up in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I've been here 4-5 times and have tried the PG's, Cali, & So Fresh signature bowls- I enjoyed them all! The poke is nicely seasoned and there are a good variety of toppings. For the quality and generous portion you get, the bowls are reasonably priced. I like that they are a healthier fast food option that keeps me full for quite a few hours.

The people who work here have always been really helpful and friendly, even when they are very busy. 

Will be back for some tasty poke."}
{"text":"Okay, I officially have to change my review for this place. I have now gone with my colleague probably 3-4 times, and the workers now know him. I think with my previous review, I had a one off experience. The last few times I have been and my bowls were quite delicious. I've tried the Cali Bowl but my favourite is the Hui Hou Bowl which comes with the Honey Ginger Salmon. I think when I had the Cali, I didn't like the Tuna as much. I now know to only have the salmon going forward!

They honestly pack your bowl with generous portions of rice, fish and the toppings. My bowl felt like a brick when I was carrying it out. They really stuffed my bowl up with salmon, crab meat slaw and seaweed salad (my faves). I really couldn't finish my lunch - it was that much and I eat a lot! I feel it is very good value ($11.30 with tax) for what I got which is why I felt I needed to update my review. With my Hui Hou bowl, I do a little bit of spicy mayo and shoyu. Delicious. 

Thank you Poke Guys for improving my experience!"}
{"text":"I first tried poke guys shortly after they opened one day after work and enjoyed it so much that I treated myself again in the same week. 

If you're coming here for the first time, I suggest you opt for one of the Signature Bowls. I had the Cali bowl which included chunks of  shoyu ahi Tuna and salmon, crab meat slaw, masago, avocado, onions, and nori all on top of a bed of white rice. You can also opt for brown rice if you're feeling healthy.

The regular size bowl itself was quite filling, and I liked that all of the ingredients, especially the fish, tasted fresh. The staff was also friendly and helpful in making recommendations for me. 

Overall, I will return again to try their other selections."}
{"text":"I always try and arrive here before noon--this place fills up quickly! That said, I'm impressed by the speed of service; they tend to keep the line down to a minimum. Everything tastes really fresh and the options are delicious. I tend to go with the menu choices vs. 'build your own' because I figure they know what they're doing. The regular size bowl is a perfect size for lunch."}
{"text":"Poke Guys (not to be confused with Pokémon Go) is a must-try for Toronto foodies & tourists alike. New to poke? Try one of their Signature Bowls like their Vegetarian Bowl, PG's Bowl, Cali's Bowl, Sooo Fresh Bowl or A Hui Hou Bowl. It's a small but mighty operation sure to be a hit in the local food scene."}
{"text":"Poke in Toronto? YES. I've been spoiled with the selection of poke restaurants up and down the state of California. As I'm going to school in the Midwest, it's quite difficult to find somewhere that makes pole with fresh fish. This poke bowl here really satisfied the craving I've had for a few weeks. I ordered the Cali Poke Bowl in a regular size which is more than enough for one."}
{"text":"Lots of choices, great selection of fresh ingredients! It's gonna take some time for me to try out all the different combinations but spicy salmon is a must.

This is definitely a place to try out if you're looking for healthy options."}
{"text":"PRO excellent bowls overall... one of the best in the city for poke bowls imo;  

for the Cali Bowl;  love it the most! the menu set up is great (can do custom; large or small, and pick your toppings); size is great, toppings are awesome, fish variety is good/tasty as well; would def come back; large portions at a great price

CON fish isn't as fresh as it could be; location is off dundas, on a smaller street, but is well located overall (old chinatown or whatever it's called now)"}
{"text":"This was the first spot in Toronto where I had poke! Toronto is always late to the game but at least when one opens, a ton other follow after. 

Their portion is the best, out of the few others I have tried in the area. I see a lot of reviews claiming that the portions are no longer like before, Ill have to leave that to an updated review. They are generous with the toppings and not afraid to stuff the bowl! 

One small complain - some toppings a re a bit too salty for my personal preference, such as the seaweed salad.

Go early during lunch (before 11:55) to avoid long line up"}
{"text":"I just tried Poké Guys at an event and I was VERY IMPRESSED... The salmon chunks were HUGE and the toppings were fresh!!! I loved the sauces and everything about the Poké bowl. I'm upset there isn't a closer location to me :("}
{"text":"i've been here a few times now. The regular size bowl is a decent size. I've tried different bowls from them and they're all pretty good. However, they're not really similar to the poke bowls one would actually get in hawaii, but I digress. 

My main knocks are: (i) the poke portion is fairly small and (ii) they've slowly started cheaping out. On my most recent visit, the crab slaw was half crab and half celery, which is pretty annoying. 

The line-up is out the door sometimes, but it goes by pretty quickly. Hopefully you have some decisive people in front of you..."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty, healthy...get there!  I did a custom tuna bowl and it came out to under $13 with tax, which is good value for this kind of quality.  The fish was tasty and they don't over-sauce it like other places do to cover up sketchy quality.  You can pick and choose all your toppings...some cost a bit more, but many are free.  You can get brown or white rice or spring mix as a base...the smart move is half rice /half salad...gives you a nice mix and cuts down on the carb loading.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"5 out of 5.
All the yes.
This was just as amazing as the first time. 
Poke is so freaking good. I can't get enough of it. 
If you love fresh, marinated, delicious chunks of raw fish atop a bed of perfectly cooked brown rice, tobico, half an avocado, veggies, and a variety of other choices... Poke Guys is for you.
There are so many choices! This was the 3rd time I got the large cali bowl and for $14, you definitely get a lot of bang for your buck.
I am POSITIVE my large bowl was around 2.5 lbs of food.
You always have a solid second meal out of the large size bowls.
They have premium toppings like seaweed salad and Kim chi that are an additional 50 cents (worth it), and they have green onions, fried onions, wasabi mayo, spicy mayo, the most delicious soya sauce mixture, and black and white sesame seeds.
My boyfriend doesn't like seafood (I know, I'm working on him), so he got the vegetarian bowl. It has mini mandarin oranges, tofu, white or brown rice, seaweed salad, etc.
The tofu wasn't warm so in the winter, I can see why he wasn't thrilled with it, but he said everything else was really good.
Our server was super sweet and funny, and the place was bright and clean.
My only recommendation to Poke Guys is to maybe add a meat option (like beef skewers or something to add to a bowl) so that my boyfriend will want to go and in turn, I will get to go more often XD."}
{"text":"The food here is really good. My only issue is that when I asked to substitute the type of salmon in my bowl, I was told no substitutions, which is ridiculous especially since they have a create your own bowl option. Also, I'm not a fan of crab meat which is in almost every bowl. Of course, you can tell them not to add it, but if you try to substitute it for something else like kimchi (which is a cheaper add on their menu) they will still upcharge you 75 cents. I like that they have white rice, brown rice and salad options for the base. Would be amazing if they had black rice."}
{"text":"This is my favourite poke place. The food is fresh and prices are reasonable. I usually get the large Ah Hui Hou bowl and it's consistently good and filling. Don't expect too much from the staff...most of them are a little clueless."}
{"text":"My favourite poke shop hands down!!!

Ive been here multiple times and every time i go here theres always a line up! I guess business is doing good. 

The pokes fresh, and the portions good! I heard that they are adding new flavours that i would surely try! I love customizing my bowl and add whatever i feel like! 

The place is a bit hidden compared to the other poke places but im happy that theres  always people there. 

Keep it up poke guys!!

See you soon!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my very first time trying poke. After so long I decided to give it a try. I ordered the Cali Bowl. Oh my god I best thing ever!! I'm not one to write reviews but these guys are amazing!! It was super delicious and filled me up. I will definitely be coming back!!"}
{"text":"I continue to try new Poke places. This one, however, is the one I always go back to. Whether it's on uber eats or dining in, I always get the \"make your own bowl\" and I find the quantity as well as the taste is great for the price - add ons are always extra but the quantity is a lot comparable to other places. The fish is also always fresh as well."}
{"text":"I came across this place on a whim while in Toronto.  I love poke and this place caught my eye because it reminded me of a place I really love in New York City.  On to Poke Guys!  The workers here were very pleasant, and really accommodating of being patient with my boyfriend and I for learning the menu.  They were happy to explain everything to us and helped us with picking the perfect dish for each!  The portion sizes are great.  The regular size was great for me and the larger size was exactly what my boyfriend had in mind.  I'm not sure why so many other reviews claim the sizes are not right!  Their up-charge for extra items is not excessive, especially for what already comes on the dishes...you really do not need to add much else.   The ingredients are so fresh and I REALLY loved my CALI BOWL.  I can't wait to come to Toronto next month and grab another."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for poke shops to open since I had poke in Cali a few months ago. And I've tried the one on Bloor which was really disappointing so I was looking forward to trying Poke Guys this week. A friend recommended it to me and when I went into the store I was happily surprised by its quality - taste-wise and space-wise. 

The Classic Shouyu Salmon was fresh and their additional toppings were also really well done. I especially liked the seaweed salad and fried onion! There are several tables and bar seats as well, the lighting is good, and the walls are decorated with cute illustrations. 

They have a promo going on now, $5 for an original size bowl, which is huge! So I'll be back before the end of the week!"}
{"text":"Every time I go to this place I get out of there happy.  Fresh ingredients, delicious bowls and friendly service!  Totally recommend it.  Sometimes there's a long line but if you're not in a rush it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"DELIVERY REVIEW: via UberEATS

Poke Guys is one of my top choices for poke in DT Toronto. The portions are fair for the price, the fish is fresh, and the optionality of the different bases is great. It allows you to be a little healthier by substituting the white rice for brown rice or spring mix instead. It's a go-to place for me when I want sushi, but without the copious amounts of rice.

While they have standard bowls which are tasty, you also have the option to build your own bowl if you choose to. 

The large size bowl is an extra $4.50 on UberEATS and it's well worth it. At least for my order, there was way more than $4.50 worth of fish in the larger one.

My favourite of the standard bowls is the Cali Bowl - I usually eat it with no sauce since the salmon and tuna are already tossed in a sauce.

In comparison to some other poke places I've tried, the ingredients including the fish here are definitely fresher than most!"}
{"text":"My first time trying poke & I am in love!!

It is so good!!! I got a regular size build your own poke.
Base is spring mix. Topped with salmon, seaweed salad, soicy cucumbers, fried onions, watermelon radish, furikake, jalapenos & black & white sesame seeds.

I highy recommend this place. A must try."}
{"text":"I got the salmon and tuna poke bowl and it was delicious!!! What I do have to say is that the guy who helped me didn't tell me about the promo that they were having. He told the other people in line behind me but this was after I paid full price for it. If you had a promo, wouldn't you want people to know so that they can come back another time for your delicious food? 

I actually did really enjoy their poke bowl because of all the salads and healthy choices in their but that erked me a little that he didn't tell me when I had a full on conversation with him about the business. 

Overall great food."}
{"text":"I am so happy an authentic poke place opened in Toronto! Portions are huge for the price - my friend and I happily split a medium bowl. We got the Cali bowl, which had a great proportion of fish to rice. It was super light and refreshing, and I would definitely recommend the Poke Guys to a friend."}
{"text":"After having Poke in Hawaii, I never thought I could have it again in Toronto.  It's amazing to see that there are so many poke restaurants popping up in Toronto.  There was a line up around 12pm last Friday.  So be prepare to wait.  The staff were pretty slow with making the orders which explains the line up.  But they were very friendly and helpful.

I got the Cali bowl which had the perfect mix of rice, salmon, tuna, crab meat, onions, and sauces.  I picked 3 sauces - wasabi mayo, shoyu, and ginger Yuzu mayo.  All the ingredients were fresh.  The only thing that I can complain about is the rice.  I'm not sure why so many fast food restaurants can't seem to get the white rice done right.  It could have been softer - I am very picky with rice.  Maybe next time, I'll see if I can get more veggies to replace the rice.  The restaurant is also having a promo special $5 off the rice bowls if you check in on Facebook.  Great deal!

I also got a small bowl of the spicy shoyu salmon which was delicious.  It was really good but I ordered way too much for one person.

I'll definitely be going back this week to try a Hui Hou rice bowl which sounds like another great combination with honey ginger salmon, crabmeat, edamame, seaweed salad and fried onions.

If you love Poke, there's going to be a few more places opening up - Pokito (tried it at Night It Up, not bad), Su & Bu (tried it the EX and it was pretty yummy), Poke Wrap (haven't tried yet) and Big Tuna Poke Bar (haven't tried yet).  I guess I'll have to try them all to report back my ranking."}
{"text":"Tried this place out last week and i can honestly say that there is an authentic Japanese feel to it when I walked in. The store was beautiful and the food was fresh! Must give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Price increase, significantly smaller portions. Maybe it was just the server who served me who gave such a small portion, but definitely did not fill me up. Only 3/4 filled up. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Good value poke spot in a convenient location. Stopped by for a week night dinner and there were no lines but surprisingly a lot of staff behind the counter. They seemed new and getting the bowl was kinda slow considering I ordered a default option. It was mainly a take-out spot but did have a few tables for eating in. 

I got Cali Bowl - Large ($13), which was way bigger than I expected. The actual container was a wide, shallow dish but they packed the ingredients into a dense mound. There was a choice between white/brown rice and spring greens as well as the option to add sauce but it was savoury enough without. Ingredient quality was decent but there was a generous amount of fish and so much rice that I would probably get a regular size next time."}
{"text":"Poke Guys is a great hangout for poke lovers! My friends and I were really craving a bowl, and we decided to check it out. I ordered a Cali Bowl with spicy aioli, and I absolutely loved it. The tuna and salmon were delicious, and the sauce was super tasty with the fish and rice. The atmosphere is pretty chill, I'd describe it like a subway that sells poké. You could either takeout or sit down."}
{"text":"I would like than no other a place to write my first official Yelp review as an elite than my beloved Poke Guys. Beat value for your buck.  For $10.00 for a regular size signature bowl you can't go wrong.  They also have  make your own bowl for $9.00. 5 signature bowls all with their own twist.  The fish is marinated in their own poke sauce absorbing all that flavour.  And I appreciate not having to pay an extra dollar for Avocado when buying the signature bowls.  

Garnishes and sauces are on the house on top of the classic or build your own bowl which is super generous.  So far no other poke bowl place is comparable and I always come back to this place time and time again.  


The only can would be the slower service.  The place is run my people in their early 20s and they Really take their time and are so kind and courteous.  So really,  the wait time in my opinion is worth it.  The man that cashed me out with the blonde hair and backwards hat was calm and collected and managed the other cooks well regardless of all the UBER orders and line that reached the door.  


Check this place out before you try any other poke bowl place and you'll see the difference.  The poke brings me back to the islands of Oahu.  THANK YOU POKE GUYS."}
{"text":"Not sure if it's because I went to Haiwaii and had poke before so I keep comparing, but this was slightly disappointing. Don't have your hopes up for authentic poke bowl, but be prepared for a more fusionized style.

Cali's Signature Poke bowl ($10)
Rice with salmon and ahi tuna in classic shoyu, crab meat slaw, masago, and avocado topped with fried onions, black and white sesame. The salmon and ahi tuna in classic shoyu flavor was not on point - it essentially just tasted like sashimi mixed in soya sauce, was missing that sesame oil flavor. The fish portions were small - when you get your bowl you can't really even see the fish. All ingredients were fresh and went well with each other, but it felt like there was too much going on.

A Hui Hou Signature Poke Bowl ($10)
Rice with honey ginger salmon, crab meat slaw, edamame, seaweed salad, and masago topped with fried onions, black and white sesame. The fish lacked flavor - didn't taste any honey or ginger flavor. I asked for spicy mayo sauce which they drizzled on top of my bowl at the end, and that pretty much overpowered the original marinated poke flavor. Portion was generous in terms of overall ingredients, but not so much on protein. Felt like this bowl had a lot more ingredients than the Cali's Bowl. All ingredients were fresh and went well with each other, but it felt like there was too much going on.

It's funny how the place is called Poke GUYS, but when I went all the staff members were female....lol"}
{"text":"I have no reason to give it any less stars then 5. The staff was extremely nice and the food was great. I'm glad they had a vegetarian option. Would come again :)"}
{"text":"Went to hawaii a couple months ago and always have cravings for poke.

Tried the create your own with shoyu tuna topped with tomato, clementine, spicy cucumber, corn, edemame, white onion, green onion, fried garlic, pickled ginger. Fish was pretty fresh and veggies were really fresh.

Poke guys has a great product, does poke justice. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Cali Bowl is the best, always add corn - makes it unbelievable! The big bowl is good for 2 person to share, which comes only 15$ for two!"}
{"text":"This is your generic sit in fast food venue serving Poke.  It is likely the least authentic but the value for what you get compared to other Poke places are higher.

Service has always been great; food is great.  No complaints.

There are lots of mayo based sauce which everyone loves and their ponzu sauce is definitely not the best.  The combination of flavours though... Can be tasty.  The Spicy bowl is my favourite."}
{"text":"Located conveniently downtown I can definitely see this place being a go to spot for a quick take-away lunch during a work day. 

I tried the PG bowl and my friend the A Hui Hou bowl. I honestly thought it tasted pretty average. We both had a regular size bowl, and I think this is a good portion for lunch. There was a good variety and amount of toppings in each bowl. My friend really enjoyed the crabmeat slaw/salad. The fish isn't the freshest or highest quality, but average (didn't have high expectations there anyways though). I do think they can be a little more generous with the classic shoyu at the end when they ask you what sauce you'd like. But the only real thing that bothered me in regards to taste was that the rice was cooked with too much water - some parts clumped together and tasted mushy. 

The staff was friendly but service/prep was a bit slow as they were all still learning the specs to each bowl. It's forgiven considering they're newly opened. 

The place has a few tables and seats along the window. The decor is simple inside. 

There is definitely room for improvements but overall it's pretty average IMO and worth a try.  Their advantage here is that they're serving something different.  I definitely recommend trying this place if you're looking to try something different dt or if you're feeling for something lighter/healthier. 

I'd definitely come back for a quick bite when in the area. I look forward to trying the Cali bowl next time."}
{"text":"Tried the soo fresh bowl, I still like eating the Cali bowl better because of the crab meat slaw (soo fresh bowl has seaweed salad instead)"}
{"text":"Poke was great! I had the Cali bowl with salmon. The place is in a good location and they definitely focused more on their food than anything else which is awesome.  It's a little on the pricey side but I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Can't vouch for authenticity but I first tried a poke bowl in NYC and this is very much on par. I got the PG's bowl with brown rice which was $10+ tax (reasonably priced). The bowl had a lot going on with the toppings but I wouldn't recommend the PG bowl just because the addition of the kimchi was a little too much flavour that didn't blend with the rest. I'm a huge fan of sauces, so I really enjoyed the aiolis - which you can ask to add to any bowl. Extra toppings come at $0.50 or more. The regular portion was a good size, I was feeling pretty satisfied after eating it - not too full but not needing to eat any more.

It's difficult to find a spot during lunch hour so I'd treat it more as a take out place."}
{"text":"I came here a couple of times and have gathered some serious issues of this place:

1. During my recent visit, my rice was so hard that i couldn't chew down. Their rice is either cold or hard as a rock.
2. Leftover fish gets served the next day - i was there upon store closing and i saw how they packed the leftover fish to serve for the next day. You think the food is fresh but it's not.
3. Some staffs have attitude problems and try to trick you with misleading pricing of the build your own bowls. I'd just stick to signature bowl.

There are tons of better poke bowl places."}
{"text":"Meh. I have had way better poke elsewhere. Fish were cut in huge chunks of meaty flesh which were gross imo. Also the fish was not fresh nor did it taste very marinated. I ordered the spicy salmon poke and it was less than mediocre."}
{"text":"Tried another Poke Bowl from another place, which was too expensive and super small. The one from Poke Guys, in the regular size at 10$ is a reasonable price for the generous size of the bowl. 
Loved the Cali's Bowl, Tuna and salmon marinated in Shoyu sauce are tasty, as well as the rest. The quantity of all the ingredients were in generous serving and it's a very good point. Friendly service also.
It's a place where I would love to have my lunch again.

Edit: i came back after trying many different pokes, and i have to say that this one is easily one of the best i have tried. Actually marinated and tasty fish, unlike a lot of places that just throw raw fish in there. I also like the size of the fish pieces, big enough to have a nice taste of fish... and avocado included in one of the bowl and not 3$ extra like some do. There is another poke place I truly love but Poke guys is close second."}
{"text":"The recent Poke invasion of Toronto continues and Poke Guys is the best the city has to offer that I've tasted so far. I wrote a long winded review of Big Tuna Poke, one of the first poke places to open in the city. While the tuna there is decent, its overshadowed by its small portions considering the price point and the small amount of fish you get in a serving. Having had plenty of poke in Hawaii, Poke Guys is the closest I've had in Toronto that compares to what you can get in Hawaii. I wonder if the owner's here took notes from how Big Tuna Poke does things and just decided to address everyone's criticisms with that place and offer an overall better service for the customer.

Portions here are perfect, I had a hard time finishing a large bowl myself. You can choose from their pre-made bowls which offer a good mix of everything, or you can make your own with the huge variety of toppings on offer. Just watch out, making a custom bowl can quickly raise in price and you can find yourself paying for a $20 bowl of fish. If you got the cash to burn, then go crazy, but you'll still end up with a tasty poke bowl if you decide to be conservative with your money.

I had PG'S Bowl, which is a great starter bowl if you've never had poke before. You're given generous pieces of tuna in your order and its very tasty. After visiting this place once, its easily become one my go-to places to grab food in the area. To all those people who've had poke in Hawaii, rest easy friends, Poke Guys is the place to get the quality of tuna you're looking for. The tuna may be better in Hawaii, but thats the best recommendation I can give an establishment that is trying to give you a food experience you can only truly get somewhere else in the world. I tip my nonexistent hat to the owner's of Poke Guys, friendly staff and great food that cater's to both veteran poke fans and newcomers."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and built my own bowl with brown rice and honey ginger salmon. They have a lot of toppings to choose from and their fish was fresh and delicious! In addition to the toppings, they've got a bunch of sauces to choose from! The atmosphere is quite nice with comfortable seatings and friendly staff. Their menu is easy to navigate through and offers choices of signature bowls in addition to building your own bowls, which really gives a variety of choice for customers of all kind. Prices are reasonable for the amount and quality of food they provide. As someone who usually does not enjoy raw fish, this was a treat that I thoroughly enjoyed from beginning to end. Definitely going to be returning with more friends!"}
{"text":"mmm this was good. This place happened when the sushi chef didn't want to bother to learn how to roll! its the Asian burrito bowl but with sushi! ....a sushi bowl if you must. A small will have you shelling out $11something after tax. 
Had the cali bowl which was a little bit of salmon and a little bit of tuna in a bowl of some really delicious toppings ....or underneaths (is that a word?) 
My only regret is that I didn't add soy sauce to my to go before leaving. The fish pieces are on the larger side and the marinade dosnt really penetrate too deep. It would have been better with a little splash of the salty stuff. 
Will go back here. 
Oh PS don't fool yourself calling this place 'healthy' ....it isn't .....go for the taste. it definitely is loaded with calories and the brown rice shouldn't fool you."}
{"text":"Came back here again and this time for dinner, which was much less busy. 

I took my own advice this time and ordered the signature bowl instead of the build your own and added extra topping (seaweed salad) for 50 cents (great deal). Somehow I feel like they are more generous at night with their portions maybe end of the day or depends on the person building it. Overall a big bang for your buck. The regular small bowl was filling. Be careful of those jalapeno peppers they were unexpectedly very spicy. 

I like the Ginger Yuzu mayo sauce from last time better than the Spicy Aioli this time. It's all preference really."}
{"text":"Poke Guys is steps away from my office. I wanted to love them, unfortunately, it didn't make the cut. There were many glitches at the time of my visit. 

I opted for the California bowl with White rice, salmon & ahi tuna classic shoyu, crab meat slaw, masago, fried onions, cucumber, nori, avocado black & white sesame seeds (originally $10, 50% off with Facebook check-in). Poke Guys ran out of almost everything when I visited - brown rice, fish toppings, crab meat slaw, etc.) I felt like I was getting scraps. To be frank, I did not find traces of ahi tuna in my California bowl. My bowl was also missing avocado advertised on their display board. I had to return to the cash for the addition of avocado. 

I could have overlooked everything IF, Poke Guys did not commit the deadliest sin in the book of cooking crime - raw rice. The rice was under cooked. It was very disappointing. 

While, the flavours of the bowl was great, under cooked rice cannot be forgiven.

Update: I walked to Poke Guys to provide feedback for the owner last week - try the rice before serving as a quality control measure. Received private message from a fellow Yelper a week later on under cooked rice. Needless to say, the chance of me revisiting is very low."}
{"text":"This spot is close by my current workplace and when they had initially opened I was there a lot. I had loved the flavor, the portions, etc. No complaints up until recently when I assume the fish was either old or the veggies were old and it gave me some serious stomach issues for about two days. Not to the mention the portion sizes for the servings shrunk a huge deal from when they had initially opened. I think its about time I found a new poke spot."}
{"text":"Sooooooooooooooo good, am really happy I found this place. 
I had the Cali's bowl for $15 tax included. The only fish they had was tuna and salmon, would be even better if they had more selection. 
First time I had poke was in LA while on vacay, and have been craving for poke ever since. Brings back memories from my vacation ! 

I forgot to take a picture because I couldn't wait to eat it... By the time I remembered, I already ate the entire thing.......

Would highhhhly recommend!"}
{"text":"Been here when they first opened and you can tell that their portions aren't as generous as they use to be. They use to allow us to swap out a topping on the signature bowls for another topping of an equivalent price, but not anymore!! 

The staff seem really nice, but even when you order a signature bowl, they don't remember the combo or put the wrong topping even when they are constantly referencing back to their cheat sheet. And sadly because I wasn't paying attention, I realized after the fact that they missed to put the masago in my Angry Shrimp Bowl!!!!! Now, I'm the \"angry\" one.. lol
Advice - watch them while they build your bowl. 

Overall flavor is still good :/"}
{"text":"Yum! Even just before closing their bowls tasted fresh, delicious, and full of flavour. The PG bowl is my favourite."}
{"text":"I had lunch at Poke Guys on a friend's recommendation. I was a bit lost when deciding what to order, but the staff was friendly and helped me decide. I ordered the cali bowl. It contained salmon, tuna, avocado, nori, masago, imitation crab, fried onions, and topped with sesame seeds. So many of the ingredients that I enjoy. The presentation was excellent. However, I thought the taste of the poke was just okay. I found the flavor to be a bit bland. It's possible that poke is just not my thing."}
{"text":"Great food for affordable price. Very casual atmosphere, and very friendly staff. I never had to wait for a spot. The turnaround time is pretty fast. 

My favourite is the California bowl and make sure you ask for brown rice - it's tastier and at no extra charge! I usually get a regular size and it's already very filling."}
{"text":"Small place with good decorations - not much seating though so definitely would consider take out. 

Got the Cali bowl (~$11) and it was delicious. It had tuna and salmon on a bed of brown rice with avocado, fried onion, green onion, and essentially any other topping you want. It has great value for what you're paying (as compared to the other choices).  I eat a lot and the regular size was very filling - just for a frame of reference. 

Their \"pre assembled\" bowls seem to have more variety and toppings than making your own so I definitely would recommend doing that."}
{"text":"I always crave a good poke bowl and this did not disappoint! I like the variety of choices available and opted for one of their signature bowls since it was my first time. The volcano bowl was great but my mouth was on FIRE. I'm usually ok with spicy foods but I think this bowl had spicy cucumber, spicy seaweed salad and spicy salmon; I topped it off with spicy aoli too haha. My boyfriend had the Cali bowl and the avocado and mix of tuna and salmon was great but I enjoyed the explosion of flavour in the volcano bowl more. I went for brunch and only finished half of my regular size bowl so I think portion size is fine. The final cost for the both of us was $25. A little more than what I would like to spend on a quick meal but I would go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try out Poke Guys for a long time and finally got to try it. It's very small inside with just a couple of tables and booths along the window.  We ordered 2 large Cali bowl - one with spicy aioli and one with classic shoyu.  Unfortunately, it was a bit of a let down. They are very heavy handed with the sauce that goes on top but I guess it's the only flavour injection.  The tuna and salmon didn't taste like it was seasoned and the most of my salmon wasn't fresh which was off putting.  Don't bother with build your own, it will add up and get really expensive. You're better off ordering a bowl off the menu. 

On the upside, the bowl sizes are bigger than all the other poke restaurants. Their toppings are generous as well. The tuna and salmon was cut in nice big chunks."}
{"text":"Sorry but first off, this owner has NEVER been to Hawaii. Isn't that embarrassing? When I asked what inspired them, the owner responded saying he started the business because he \"liked to start trendy businesses and tried Poke once in New York once so had to open one up here\". So obviously there isn't a true passion for this? 

My boyfriend and I came here twice, the first time during the soft opening. We felt the stinginess that day but we thought we'd give them another chance. The second time was the grand opening. They had some \"special promotion\" we wish we never got, because it wasn't filling AT ALL......Super stingy, and they wouldn't let us buy another bowl because it was \"one bowl per customer\".... so we were just awkwardly standing there still hungry. On the opening day too? \"Um yea, it is a small lunch\" said the owner.   

Sorry but do these kids know what customer satisfaction is about? Evidently lacking experience in restaurant hospitality. I could tell other customers felt uncomfortable because they would do things like fill the bowl with greens and take some out and put it back into their salad bar because they were so stingy. Hygiene? I kid you not I could count the 4 pieces of salad greens they put in the bowl. I could go on... I'd never come back. This place is so embarrassing.

And it's far from authentic Hawaiian Poke I'll tell you that. And these kids have no experience at running a restaurant.  Everything was so awkward."}
{"text":"Having eaten Poke in Hawaii numerous times, I was ecstatic in knowing that it had become popular in Toronto. I came here on a Sunday at noon to get take out after hearing good things about Poke Guys and I wasn't disappointed.

I was debating between trying one of their pre-made bowls or making my own, but in the end I decided on trying the Cali bowl aftering seeing the toppings included. I got a regular which was more than enough for me. I ate half of it for lunch and ate the rest a day later (will comment on that later). 

The Cali bowl, like others have said, has the perfect ratio of rice (I picked brown rice), shoyu tuna, shoyu salmon, crab meat, avocado, fish eggs, fried onion, and seaweed. The tuna and salmon chunks were generous in size and amount. Actually, not just the tuna and salmon, the other toppings came in generous amounts as well. I remember thinking that there was a lot of avocado in my bowl and was quite impressed with that. (If you want to talk quantity, it was 1/2-3/4 of a full big sized avocado). I topped the bowl off with a little bit of aioli sauce. The regular sized bowl was around 13$ with tax. 

I couldn't finish my bowl having eaten a late breakfast, so I left half of it for lunch the next day. I wasn't sure how it was going to taste since there were a mixture of sauces and leftover toppings. To my surprise, it still tasted pretty good! Big thumbs up for that.

Overall, I am a huge fan and will be back for their food."}
{"text":"Great spot tucked away around the Eaton Centre. Really nice poke bowls at an affordable price but with good portions too! Definitely an easy go to whenever I'm feeling for a poke bowl downtown."}
{"text":"Prepared very quickly in a filling serving, the bowls were fresh and delicious! I usually find raw fish unappetizing but I loved their salmon! It wasnt slimy or anything and had a really great texture."}

There are gluten and vegans options available. 

I opted for a regular size build your own bowl. I got white rice, class shoyu tuna, seaweed salad, cucumber, avocado, and crab meat slaw with spicy aioli (mayo). The regular size was more than enough for me, I still had food left over. The tuna had so much flavor and it was so fresh. I tried the crab meat slaw because everyone was raving about it. I do not like coleslaw, but I did like their take on it. I love the variety of options that are available and the friendly staff. I will definitely come back to Poke Guys the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Got the Cali's bowl with a substitute of spring mix instead and added pineapples for extra cost. I absolutely loved the number of fruits in their toppings selection and also their garnish variety as well! The fish and veggie base was fresh too. 

Only complaint is they were very heavy handed with the sauce, but it surprisingly didn't effect the overall goodness of the poke though! I would easily come back for their amazing poke (and fruit selection) but just request for less sauce (:"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried the Volcano Bowl and Cali Bowl today and found that it was very salty and there was way too much sauce. We both couldn't finish because the bottom of the poke bowls were filled with sauce - it was like a ricey soup near the end - very unappetizing. Probably wouldn't try this again as I was told these were some of their more popular bowls. There's better poke places in the downtown area worth trying out! Only giving this place two stars since the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Summary: finally Poke Bowls in Toronto. A nice, low-key restaurant that serves simple and fresh poke bowl.
What is poke bowl? In my simple terms, freshii with fishy, or lazy sushi. It is like sushi version of buritto bowl.
Price: Around $13/person without promotion

This seems to be the new trendy (also instagram and facebook picture friendly) place in Toronto, so I went to check this place out with my friend. I had poke bowls in LA, which I really really liked. Now Toronto finally has it.
I ordered make-your-own bowl. This place is like Subway that allows you to choose your toppings. My large make-your-own with 4 toppings came to $16 in the end. It is pricy, but pretty big portion, and it took me 2 meals to finish.
This place is a nice and clean. The raw fish is pretty fresh. It is a good dish for the hot summer day.
I would probably go back here if I went to shop at Eaton centre and want to have a non-food-court meal break."}
{"text":"This place is really clean, and staff is really friendly.

The food is amazing!

 I was surprised at the cost initially ($15 for a large bowl) but then I realized it is basically a conglomerate of delicious unrolled sushi in a bowl! I got the cali bowl with all garnishes, and damn was it tasty.

Definitely a unique food experience, and a great venue. 5/5"}
{"text":"Very nice! The person who made my bowl was an Aussie who engaged me in the most attentive small talk ever. The person who cashed me out was also super nice. Very kind people and friendly service all around!

I had Cali's Bowl. To my delight, I got to pick some of my own toppings! The fried onions with the shredded seaweed is so good. The spicy aioli went well with it as well, though I might try the tadarashi mayo next time. 

The poke itself was good too - saltier than I would have expected (I'd never had poke before and imagined it would be like ceviche but with just fish) but that made it go well with the rice. The cold poke and warm rice made for an interesting sensation in my mouth. Ideally, if I were making fresh poke myself, I'd prefer to have the fish cut in smaller cubes. But since they do marinate it in soy sauce, which is quite salty, I get why they keep the fish chunks larger.

The serving is quite generous as well! I got the regular size (as opposed to larger) and a can of Nestea and I was stuffed mostly because of how much rice was packed into it. 

And at $10/regular sized bowl, I found the price quite reasonable (especially compared to sushi burritos)."}
{"text":"If you're around City Hall or Ryerson U, or just want a quick bite after a 'shop till you drop' session at the Eaton Centre, be sure to check out Poke Guy's signature Poke Bowls, or if you're feeling adventures, build your own Poke Bowl. My personal favourite is their 'Cali Bowl' which comes with a mix of Salmon & Ahi Tuna (best of both worlds) on a bed of white rice, and topped off with crab meat slaw, masago, avocado, fried onions, nori, and black & white sesame seeds! Not only were the staff super friendly, but the portions are quite generous too. Poke Guys is definitely one of my favorite go-to spots for 'dem' Poke cravings."}
{"text":"Went here during the 5 dollar check in deal, and I was pretty nervous after reading all the reviews regarding the rice. I ordered the Cali bowl that came with a mixture of salmon and tuna. The entire experience was really good and there was no problem with the rice when I went although I find the portions of fish were a bit lacking. Deducted a star because they were out of a few ingredients, I felt that there wasn't enough fish, and despite having a make your own bowl option they could not swap out ingredients (not sure if it was just a language barrier)."}
{"text":"I am somewhat a foodie and follow all kinds of foodies on Instagram. Lately, I've been seeing a lot of posts on something called a poke bowl and decided I needed to try it. I quickly looked up a few places and decided to head to Poke Guys. I'm so glad I made the right choice.

A poke bowl is like deconstructed sushi in a bowl. I decided to go with the Cali Bowl it is a rice based bottom topped with fresh Tuna, Salmon and a crab salad among other fresh ingredients. It was perfect. The portion size was very generous and the fish was super fresh. You can top it with different sauces and I opted for the spicy alioli and a wasabi mayo, yum!

Writing this review, I'm craving it again and may need to go back soon. Although, I'd want to try another bowl, maybe the spicy shrimp, I absolutely loved the Cali bowl and don't know if I'll be able to steer away from it.

Definitely check it out! If you like sushi and sashimi, you will not be disappointed!!!

Enjoy!!!

{"text":"This place is great and never a disappointment. The staff are courteous and attentive walking you through the Ingredients and options should you have any questions.

There is 2 bowl size options. 1 regular/small and the other a large. A couple can share 1 large and be satisfied easily. If you wanted to do your own thing then get a regular/small. You'll be stuffed either way.

The fish is tasty, fresh and well kept. The place is spotless behind the counter which is key when serving a lot of raw meats(fish in this case). 
I have never been to Hawaii but from what I hear this place gets the look and taste pretty spot on. Save your money on a flight ticket and come try out this location."}
{"text":"One of the first poke places I tried and they're always consistently good. They're usually busy but if you come during off peak hours it's quite efficient. Their staff is great, very helpful, and their portion sizes are worth the price. Fish is alright, ingredients are good. Can't complain."}
{"text":"To me, Poke Guys sets the standard when it comes to poke. It is undoubtedly the best poke place I've tried in Toronto, and I've tried quite a few. Every poke place has their own take on the concept. Some like to create an Asian twist, while others insist that they serve only authentic Hawaiian poke. Some are purist when it comes to poke (the fish is the star of the show) while others offer toppings galore. 

But no one does it quite as well as Poke Guys when it comes to the amount of flavor they can pack in a bowl. 

Plus for the portion and the price, it's pretty damn great. My favorites are the A Hui Hou Bowl and the Cali Bowl (Salmon and tuna! Because, why choose between the two when you can have both?) Now if only they also served zucchini noodles..."}
{"text":"This place is one of the OG poke joints in Toronto that serve some of the best valued poke bowls in the city. They allow you to customize your bowl as well-whether you're getting one made from scratch or one of their signature options. The ability to add extra free toppings and to choose from a variety of sauces makes this place stand out. 

They have been trying to standardize their portion sizes and prices recently. I would say that their regular sized bowls are close to perfect for most people's appetite. The large bowl is really big and I have never been able to finish one-there's just way too much rice included! Stick to the regular sized bowl to avoid waste, Imo =)"}
{"text":"This is my first time eating a poke bowl and it was quite an enjoyable experience! I ordered the volcano bowl and the regular size was more than enough. Probably wouldn't order the large unless it's shared with someone else. Although it was SUPER spicy for me (probably will try a different one next time I come) there were really good and plentiful ingredients. The fried onions added a nice crunch as well as the watermelon radish. I like to mix all the ingredients together so all the flavours can be well combined. The fish pieces were very big and the server was pretty generous with the portions. This location didn't have too much seating, but we managed to grab a spot on a busy Friday night. Very anticipated for the other locations that will be opening closer to home :)"}
{"text":"Favourite poke place in Toronto, by far.

+ Located very close to Dundas square
+ You can create your own bowl or choose from a wide selection of standard bowls - my favourite is the cali bowl and the hui huo bowl
+ Serving size for how much you pay is well worth - I always get full from the regular size bowl alone
+ Large variety of toppings and sauces - I really like the watermelon radish and the wasabi mayo
+ They pack the bowl with toppings! I never had an employee who was stingy with the serving sizes
+ The fish always tastes fresh and is seasoned and marinated very well - I highly recommend the spicy shoyu if you are looking for something with a little kick
+ Available on uber eats!

This place never disappoints and the poke always tastes amazing - I always come back. What more can I say. I definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to try poke for the first time - you won't be disappointed."}
