{"text":"If you're visiting Akron, you must try a burger from Skyway!  Very similar to Swenson's, but the single burger is a bit larger. Also, their fried chicken is surprisingly good!!"}
{"text":"burnt burger and soggy fries cooked three hours ago. yum my favorite. this is the second time this has happened and i will not be back. this is what you get for 24 years as a loyal patron? this place used to be great but they don;t really care anymore. the people who give it good reviews are stuck in the past and overly nostalgic.
thanks for the two thin napkins already covered in grease too. that was very helpful."}
{"text":"best burger usa period. i have been across this world eating shit and nothing brings me back to home more than a skyway burger. absolutley simple and perfect, i could not ask for more, and the fact that they consistently run 2for1 specials in the beacon journal is that much better, everytime i am home my grandma gives me a coupon and i leave that place the happiest man in akron for $4. P.S. the california is the greatest drink ever. in case you were wondering. Im sorry to those who prefer swensons they dont hold a candle to skyway, and i say that in the most objective manner. skyway burgers are thes best i have ever had and they truest reminder of home."}
{"text":"I make the drive from the westside of Cleveland to eat here. I luv their take on the big mac, The Skyway Burger yum! The fried chopped ham sandwich add cheese & mustard so good. The chili dogs (Nathan Hotdogs) with cheese , mustard, & onions are worth the drive in my opinion. One thing though I come for the chili dogs & their out of chili half the time I come. So call a head if you want chili or chili dogs. That's how I discovered the chopped ham sandwich,no chili. The sides are good, fried mushrooms, Aunties onion rings, cheseteasers, sauerkrautballs yum ! Luv the California Fizz & Florida pop. Grape & Orange pop with Ginger Ale. Stop by if you're passing by on highway 77."}
{"text":"Wow! Looks like I'm the only dissenter here... Was looking forward to a quality retro experience. Friendly guy quickly took my order of a Sky High burger and onion rings and.... 20 minutes later they arrived at room temperature. I sent back the burger and asked for a hot sandwich which they cheerfully replaced. I have to tell you that even hot, it was just ok. I'd suggest better quality (juicer) beef. In fairness... The onion rings were homemade and probably would have been good if they were hot. Bottom line.. Nice people, sloooow service and mediocre food. Next time I'll go to Midway Oh Boy between Elyria and Lorain... That's a burger worth a trip."}
{"text":"Well been here a few times after my bad experience and they rock !! Their burgs are way fresher than Swensons..... And the Orings are clearly real and not frozen. No comparison in my book. I think maybe I
Hit them at a slow time.... Gotta go when the lot is full :)). Yummmmmm"}
{"text":"Part of my Cleveland NCAA experience.  We came to Akron to stay a couple nights and because I was already a fan; we made our way to Skyway.  Some people will debate Swenson's is the one, but this is it for me.  You sit in your car and they come to you to take your order; so have the tunes in your car ready or the game du jour.  You can also go in to order for take out I'm sure, but sitting in your car is the way to go.  They have their way of doing things and it's worked for quite a few decades now.  Some people don't care for the ketchup, it is much thicker and sweeter than most, but for me it does the trick.  Hamburgs are really good and VG quality.  The general menu is typical burger fare.  Treat yourself and make your way to Skyway!"}
{"text":"Great 50's era drive in - get the signature Sky-hi burger for a mayo party in your mouth. Rings are greasy and California is just ok. When you want to tour the dives of Akron stop by and lights for service!"}
{"text":"This place is right down the street from where I grew up. The fries are the best, so are the onion rings. I was just home and I can't believe I didn't go!"}
{"text":"Best simple burger.
Best chicken sandwich.
Best shakes.
Great service.
Vegetable Soup is outstanding.
Nothing better than having a picnic with your stinky girl and bringing a bag of skyway!"}
{"text":"Great burger, I like it more than Swenson's currently.  Onion rings are amazing, but the shakes are too watery."}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and have no wish to enter the Skyway versus Swenson's debate...really, I like both.  Indeed, my Skyway chili dog was excellent.  This was big (for the price, I expected one of those thin jobs that's barely a mouthful) but instead I got a robustly sized, tasty, slightly spicy dog covered in just the right amount of chili.  The milkshake rocked as well and the server was a pro.

Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"I have been going to Skyway for a couple of years. I absolutely love it. I recently went on a diet and allowed myself one bad meal a month and this was this month's choice. I was craving it so bad, I read all of these reviews in excitement. I noticed all of the Skyway/Swenson's comparisons. I myself have had Swenson's some time ago and forgot what that tasted like, so I went today and tried both. 

I went to Skyway first. It was amazing as usual. I ordered the ultimate burger combo and had half of a Sky-hi burger. The ultimate burger comes with a 3/4 lb burger with a lot of cheese, bacon, lettuce tomato and mayo, fries and a 32 oz drink for a very good price. I got a Florida drink and my girl friend got the California. Both amazing. I always get the ultimate burger. It is the best burger I have ever had for the price. It is loaded with cheese, bacon and has the sweet brown sugar taste that Skyway burgers have. I LOVE IT. I also got their hot dog. It is very good as well. They use the Nathan's type of hot dog. The snappy casing dog. Those are much better than a cheep hot dog.

At Swenson's I got the galley boy, fries and the tator teasers. I got these items because I saw the many complaints about Skyway's fries in this and I wanted to compare the tator teasers.

Now, to everyone who is comparing Skyway to Swenson's for the Sky-hi and Galley Boy sandwiches. Both are fair comparisons. They are VERY similar. To be honest though, both are not very good. They are loaded with thousand island and it is all you can taste. I had half of each burger and I could barely eat that. It completely takes away the brown sugar, buttery bun, and cheese taste. I give those burgers a 2 out of 10. If I had to pick one it would be Skyway's. There sandwich was larger and had a little less thousand island dressing, allowing me to taste everything a bit more.

For the fries. Both restaurants have the exact same fries or at least they looked and tasted like it. Swenson's fries came out without any salt at all on them, but salt packets. Skyway's came with salt on them. Both were crispy and fresh/hot. This one is a tie. They both suck and need some type of seasoning or different fry. 

I have had the tator tweasers(or whatever they are called) from Skyway many times and really like them. That is why I tried them from Swensons. Swensons came with less than Skyway, but Swenson's tator tweasers were over-all better. They had a bit more of a kick to them and had a better texture. 

Now the main point behind this review. From looking at Swenson's menu, the Galley Boy is there top burger. That is not the case with Skyway. Their top dog is what  I always get. The ultimate burger. It is amazing and huge. It really fills you up. 

I always have very fast service and short waits for food at Skyway and the food always comes out fresh, even too hot for me to eat sometimes until it cools down."}
{"text":"One of the two, eight hundred pound gorillas of hamburger glory in Akron, OH.  A delicious time capsule of beef goodness with a big ole side of FRIED splendor.

Worth a visit by all visitors, worth being a regular for all locals."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying I love skyway. My last two visits have been subpar. My last visit was 30 minutes before they closed. They brought my family's food out on bags and said they were closing. We were allowed to eat there but they turned off the lights. The time before that, they lost my order. After I finally flagged someone down, and explained, they put my order in. No apologies, no discount. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"The burgers here are absolutely incredible!!!! However if you're vegetarian or avoiding eating beef, there isn't a huge array of choices unfortunately. But the burgers, oh my god, sweet Jesus they're delicious."}
{"text":"Skyway Drive-In is comparable to its rival, Swenson's. The SkyHi sandwich is similar to the Galley Boy, but has a different sauce. I'd say 7 out of 10 times I'd pick the Galley Boy over the SkyHi sandwich, but it is still a good sandwich. The coleslaw was underwhelming, and the fries weren't spectacular. Overall it is a good drive-in burger joint."}
{"text":"You really have to take a stand when it comes to Rubber City Drive-In Dining.  Do you worship at the fryer altar of Skyway, or do you spin on the malt machine of Swenson's?  For nearly my entire life, from cradle to about two years ago, I only attended burger church services at Skyway.  I had friends deliver greasy sacks of burgers by plane to California, where I deep-froze them, ready for a quick re-heated Sky-High fix whenever I couldn't hide from the urge for one more minute.

Then, it happened.  A friend from Columbus took me to Swenson's, and ordered me up a Galley Boy.  Uh-oh.  It was a conversion.  The Swenson's was better, and not just a little bit better.  It was about a third again as good as Skyway, and by that I mean:  Fresher.  Fuller flavor.  Better bun.  Better overall presentation.  Come on, a pimento-stuffed olive, on a toothpick skewer, outside the foil wrapper?  That's drive-in genius, right there.

Now, for the onion rings, Skyway is still better, by a country mile.  No comparison.  I'm not that much of a french fry guy, or a milkshaking man, or a fish sammy guy, so I don't want to sully this review on that front, but my dream date would be to snag a Galley Boy from Swenson's, shag on down to Skyway for some o-rings, then waltz over to  Barnhill's for a sundae.  Oh, sorry.  Barnhills's closed during the Nixon administration.  Why?  WHY?

Service is WAY better at Swenson's.  Cleanliness is better at Swenson's.  If not for the O - O - O - rings, I may never return to Skyway.

My two stars are not to convey that this is so awful a dining experience, but with a Swenson's so close, just a peel-out down the straza, why on earth even THINK about Skyway?  So, Mr. Skyway?  If you're listening, and you want to win me back?  I'm afraid you're just mailing it in, riding on the dogged, unflinching faithfulness of the Ohio burger hound.  Have your carhops smile.  Scamper out to my truck, if you can't run, which the good folks at Swenson's do, approximately EVERY TIME.  And keep that lot clean, will you?  Sheesh.  It isn't that tough.  See you at Swenson's!  Turn on your headlights for service!"}
{"text":"I've lived in West Akron/Fairlawn are for 15 years and have never been here, so today I decided to try it out. I bought a double cheeseburger and a chocolate shake, wasn't impressed. My cheeseburger was good size, but tasted strange. The only thing I tasted was the mayo which overpowered everything else. The shake was ok, nothing special. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Living and working in Fairlawn made SkyWay the place to be every Fri. or Sat. night.  Swensons was not open in Montrose in those days, so we were loyal to the neighborhood and didn't venture to Wallhaven to eat at Swensons.  We use to circle the building in our cars to see who was there before parking.  Having those fond memories, I was so  disappointed that the employees now park in our spots.  Seeing empty cars there is like seeing abandoned homes in a neighborhood.   The burger was still good and onion rings as remembered.  I don't complain that the prices were higher since I live in So. California where we have paid $16 for a burger, that I enjoyed less.   I hope it continues and that the management bring it back to the standards of 1969."}
{"text":"Just tried this place Sunday and been back twice. Yes that's three days in a row. I love this place and not sure why it took me over 30 years to pull in. My guess is I lived a block away from Swenson and was taught Swenson's is the best. I learned indeed they're not. I took 30 yrs to learn the long hard way. I will never go back to Swenson's. Swenson's quality and quantity has decreased as the prices continue to rise over the years. I love the combos offered by Skyway and I'm totally addicted to the buffalo burger there. Food served piping hot and fresh."}
{"text":"I love Sky Way!! Get their cheeseburger and sauerkraut balls! Their best milkshake is Oreo Milkshake. I've tried Swensens before and I have to say Sky Way is way better. I've gone here since I was younger. I'm in college now and I miss it when I'm away at school,"}
{"text":"Skyway has very good burgers and fries.  The only bad part is it's a little pricier than Swenson's and I wasn't very happy about the service at this location.  The guy that took our order wasn't friendly and was in a hurry to get us out of there.  Overall the food is delicious, but I prefer Swenson's service an food over Skyway's."}
{"text":"Ever hear of Pat and Gino's in Philly, well Akron has Swenson's and Skyways.  But instead of a bad cheese steak, these are the best burgers ever made.  I personally like Skyway better, but my family likes Swensons better, you determine which is better since they are about a mile apart from each other.  Go to both, get  milkshake, onion rings and a cheese burger and there is no better meal in Akron."}
{"text":"Ski hi and onion rings is the best! Always worth goong out of my way to get some skyway"}
{"text":"First time here and not disappointed! I had a custom combo cheeseburg with grilled onions, lettuce, tomato and mustard. Very nice, hot and fresh. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Old school drive-in that totally brings me back to my childhood. My uncle used to work there and we would go all the time for burgers, fries, onion rings and....my favorite.....the \"California,\" which is a sugary, delicious blend of 7-UP, grape juice, and fresh lemons (at least I think so....I haven't been in a quite some time). 

What is it about eating in the car off of a tray hanging from the window? Everything just tastes better. I haven't had one of their burgers since the 1970s, but I am told they are still delicous. I think they put sugar in the meat. I loved those things! They also have sick (in a good way) fried mushrooms."}
{"text":"The burger here is good, you will not be disappointed.  One thing i love about this place. 

The only thing i have a problem with is having my lights on and being ignored for twenty minutes while other who arrived at the same time or later than me got got prompt service.

I understand it gets busy, but watching me enter and park, then do nothing is disheartening.  At least a \" hi, just give me a moment and i'll be with you\" would have been better than being treated like a ghost."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on a cold snowy wintry night.  Their menu served chili, and fried chicken or something, as well as burgers.  If Stephen King's Christine Car was hungry, it would come here.  A dude comes flying out the door, throws me a menu, and tells me to turn on my lights when I'm ready to order.  I was late for a movie, so I flashed my lights immediately.  What do you recommend?  Dude says...Tonight's special.  Burger, fries, and drink.  Gotcha...do it up!  Burger comes, and he tells me to roll down the f'in window for the tray of food as the snow storm picks up and buries my burger.  What the hell are these instructions?  Screw that...let's do it Texas style, throw everything in the passenger seat and eat what doesn't fall on the floor. The burger...what is up with the special sauce?!!  Now I understand what sets Ohio burgers apart from the rest of the world.  Good thing France is far from Ohio...they would steal this recipe.  Highly Texas recommended!"}
{"text":"Skyway has long been a family tradition, I basically grew up eating this food. After not having it for about two years, I was able to get my hands on one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life and undoubtably the best sauerkraut balls I've ever had. When I go to skyway, I order a cheeseburger with everything (mustard, pickle, onion). You can also order your burger with the works (lettuce, tomato, ketchup maybe?). You're totally have to get their sauerkraut balls and their onion rings, order them crispy. And to top it off I love to get to a California drink: grape juice, sprite and lemon juice - SO good. This place is so fun because you get to pull up your car in a spot and flash your lights - This is the signal for someone to come out and help you. If you want to eat there which is awesome if you have the time, they bring a tray that sits on your car window. Skyway is full of nostalgia for me and will definitely bring you back to a simpler time."}
{"text":"It's obvious with skyway stores closing that things are deteriorating, but we still ate there tonight.  Called at 8:30, no answer on the phone. When we arrived we said we had tried to call ahead, the curb runner said \"we're getting ready to close in an hour so we don't take phone orders.\" Quality of the burger meat or how they cook it has gone south. I will say the chocolate shake was decent (at least enough for a two year old)."}
{"text":"Oh Lawd, what did I just do to myself? It's been a while since I ate at Skyway and thought I'd give it a try. Not a good choice. 

First off, the service was slow. I almost left before the only server working finally noticed me.  After taking my order the food came out pretty quickly. I saw the server standing by the door keeping an eye on things until it was time to pay the bill and leave, then he was nowhere to be seen.

I ordered the Skyhi sandwich with onion rings and a strawberry shake. The shake was pretty good (not great, but good). The burger patties were thin and dry, with not much flavor. The most dominant flavor was the Mayo in the special sauce. The onion rings were a little over-cooked. When I bit into one all of the coating crumbled off. They were also very greasy.

Overall, not a good experience. It's safe to say I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Very comparable to Swenson's, same style and price point. Burgers might be slightly larger and aren't as sweet, fries are better though and do come salted unlike their competitor!"}
{"text":"There are two competing hometown drive-in burger chains that vie for \"top bun\" in this town.  This is one of them.  They have always turned out a great burger, a secret sauce type double burger, killer onion rings adequate fries that don't taste fresh cut, uniquely enough sauerkraut balls, a fresh veggies snack pak and the rest of standard drive-in fare.  A word of caution, if you like totally flavorless fried chicken that is only marginally identifyable as coming from a domestic bird, order some here, otherwise stay away from that pick, but the rest of the menu holds no major flaws.  Recently they added a line of \"Gourmet\" burgers one of which has several onion rings on top of a huge half pound burger.  That burger will actually call out to one once one has partaken and beckon one from afar like a siren of Greek lore.  Car-hops jog to your car and bring fresh hot food and a bill.  Happilly they tend to publish coupons in the local newspapers that offer BOGO offers and such regularly, so keep an eye out and save a buck!  Actually featured on Food Feuds with Michael Symon for you foodies.  I have never  had any of the service issues other reviewers have noted and often call ahead and the food is waiting for me when I arrive.  The preferred burger treatment is \"everything\" which is just pickle onion and mustard, but that's how a burger should be served."}
{"text":"After watching Food Feuds with Michael Symon, I thought I'd give Skyway and Swensons a try.  Here are my results:
1. Service: At Skyway we waited 30 mins for our food.  During that excruciating wait, I watched as car hops walked (yes walked) right by cars with lights on, then get angrily honked at.  There was so much honking due to lack of competent service, I felt like I was sitting on 77-S at 5pm coming out of downtown!
2. Burgers: I ordered a sky hi burger, my husband a double cheeseburgs.  The \"special sauce\" had melted into a white watery liquid making my burger a soggy mess.  Added nothing to the burger.  The meat was moist, but lacked any real flavor.  The bun was sweet, which helped boost the overall taste some.  I give them credit for trying.
3. Sides:  I ordered the onion rings, my husband got the cheese teezers.  Well, I can't tell you what the onion rings were like bc I never got them. The car hop messed up my order and I got their stale, flavorless fries instead.  Considering I waited 30 mins for my food, I didn't feel like sending my order back.  The cheese teezers lacked crunchiness and my husband thought there was not enough jalapeno in them.
4. Milkshake:  We got a chocolate milkshake.  It wasn't fully blended lacked depth of flavor.  I didn't think you could really mess this up, but somehow they managed to do so.

Swensons has no competition.  When we went there, the food was out in less than 10 minutes.  The car hops RUN, are knowledgeable, delightful, and don't mess up orders.  The burgers are way more flavorful, with the Galley Boy being out of this world!    Don't even think about going to Skyway - what a waste of space."}
{"text":"There are two kinds of people in Akron:

1) Those who claim \"Swenson's is better\".
2) Those who have actually had Skyway and KNOW it's better.

Don't be a fool and don't be a sheep...just get a Sky-Hi."}
{"text":"The onion rings are some of the best I've ever had.   Always frsh, never frozen.   Try a 52 combo for the ultimate experience.  This is a REAL DRIVE-IN restaurant.   Similar experience at Swenson's, but no onion rings.  Menu has expanded some since I first started coming,  but I stick with the Sky-high burger (a slightly sweet yummy bun), onion rings, and hot fudge milk shake (extra on the combo)."}
{"text":"Excellent burger spot, classic place to grab lunch in Akron! Be sure to grab a California, a great drink to wash down your burger and onion rings with!"}
{"text":"The California (Ginger Ale and Grape Pop w/ a lemon slice) is unreal. One of the best soft drinks ever. The Florida (Orange Pop and Lemonade) sounds good also. The burgers here are delicious. I still think that Swenson's is better, but that does not discount the quality of Skyway. The Galley Boy is better than the Sky Hi Burger easily. The normal cheeseburger was great. Onion Rings were excellent. Chicken nugs were good. The Cheese Teasers were also awesome. My favorite element of Skyway was the cool drinks. My friend thought Swensons blows it out of the water."}
{"text":"Going back in time 60 years or so.  This drive in has maintained its integrity.  
The burgers are really tasty with lots of options.  I had a delicious strawberry milkshake.  I tried some of hubby's fries. They were like home made.  Yummy.
The servers come right to your car window.  Turn your lights on for service.
I never eat in my car, but since we're driving a rental, I don't care.  It was fun.
However....I had a bad stomach ache all the next day and night.   Can not confirm source."}
{"text":"My grandparents lived in Fairlawn, and my mother told tales of going to Skyway with her sister when they were in high school. It was a good place to meet boys and have a burger and a Coke. I was introduced to their onion rings and cheeseburgers when i was a wee lass. We always balanced our visits between Skyway and Swenson's, and I was happy with either. I mean, when I was a kid, going out to dinner was something we didn't do often. I preferred Sky Way, simply because Barnhill's was close, and we'd go there for ice cream. I still miss that place. Anyways...

When my grandfather passed away and my grandmother left Fairlawn (which coincided with me getting a drivers license), I became a full-fledged Swenson's fanatic. I'd check in with Skyway on occasion, for nostalgia or whatnot, but Swenson's was always the go-to for a burger and fries.

I hadn't been to Skyway in years, so mom and I decided to stop by there this past weekend. Wow, wow, wow. First of all, the place is falling apart. The driveway could use repaving. The signs are all faded and could use some paint (i do love that they use the old signs still, though). The service was slow. Once we got the menu, I was shocked by how high the prices are--most of their items are higher than Swenson's! I was tempted to drive down to the Swenson's on Hawkins, but decided nah, i'll give this place a shot.

I wish I had left and gone to Swenson's.

My Sky-Hi was terrible. The quality of the burger is BAD. The patties were dry and thin, and not very sweet. The cheese they use is gross--those slices of Processed American Cheese that don't melt very well. And i'm fairly sure the Sky-Hi sauce was just a huge blob of mayo.

My fries were great, perfectly crispy and not too greasy. Mom's onion rings were awesome...but the grease! Holy crap! There was a good inch of grease at the bottom of the bag!

The only reason that they're getting two stars is because they make real Cherry Coke with Grenadine. I remember thinking I was fancy as hell when I was young and i'd get to drink that. One sip took me back almost instantly.

I wish I could give them 1/2 a star, because I was so sick the next day after all the grease I ingested. I wish I could say that I'd go back, but honestly? The only time i'd go there is if i have the munchies (ahem), and i want some sauerkraut balls and a real cherry coke. otherwise, i'll be at Swenson's, where even the veggie burgers are the bomb."}
{"text":"I started going to Skyway about 15 years ago.  I love the sweet butter that they use on the buns so much that I order my burger plain so that nothing takes away from that great taste.  I have tried Swensons and have not been nearly as impressed.  When we were in Wisconsin a few years ago, I was so excited to try butter burgers thinking they would be a better version of Skyway.  I was so disappointed, they were good, but not Skyway good.  It's on that bun!

I can't comment on other sandwiches because in the dozens of times I've been there, I've never been able to order anything other than a plain burger!  My mom did try the baked ham sandwich this time around and really liked it, especially since the buns have the same secret sweetness.

I have started ordering the fries well done as I used to be very disappointed in them, they seemed limp and undercooked.  Ever since I ask for them to be well done, they have been hot and crisp and yummy.

Go Skyway!"}
