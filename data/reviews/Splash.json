{"text":"Good food, great service from Caleb! We were weary from traveling all day and he was a bright light-funny, great service and an all around nice guy. Thanks Caleb, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had the breakfast burrito and a cup o' coffee.  The cook/server was super cool and friendly.  He brought the food out the my table, poolside.  Burrito was nice and fresh with tons of flavor.  Coffee was Starbuck (sorry, not a fan) and typical medium brew.  Prices were quite high, but on par for the location.  Very convenient.  If I were to stay here again, would not hesitate to repeat."}
{"text":"Splash is the latest name for the bar at the sheraton desert oasis. The menu is typical for a poolside bar (chicken tenders, fries, burgers, tacos) as well as smoothies and alcoholic options. 

The prices at first glance seem reasonable but when we were handed half empty plates with 3 half-size chicken tenders and 15 tiny french fries, we quickly realized the cost was not worth the portion. The food was average in taste, nothing special. For the smoothies they do not use real fresh fruit, instead ice and a premade pur√©e mix :/

Needs much improvement."}
