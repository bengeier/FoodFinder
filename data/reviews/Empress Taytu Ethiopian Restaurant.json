{"text":"We first ate at Empress Taytu in 2008 and the whole family loves it.  The incense is pungent but smells wonderful to me.  We always sit in the traditional seats around the injera basket and eat with our hands but there are also tables and silverware if you prefer.  The restaurant is decorated with Ethiopian art and fabrics and you almost feel as though you have traveled to Ethiopia.  The staff is friendly and the women cooking can be seen from the dining area and will greet you when you come in.  We have eaten at Ethiopian restaurants in DC, NYC and Las Vegas and Empress Taytu is our favorite.  I should probably mention that two of our kids come from Ethiopia and my husband has traveled there twice, so they are quite familiar with Ethiopian food.   We usually start with the sambusas, the little pastry puffs filled with lentils or beef and both are  very tasty.  Two of the combination platters has always been plenty for the six of us.  We usually get one meat and one vegetarian. I love the cabbage, especially, but everything is delicious.  The staff is always generous with the injera and brings us extra.  Speaking of the injera...it is light, fluffy and heavenly.  Our favorite injera, for sure!  I have to admit we have not partaken of the coffee ceremony...hope to do that next time."}
{"text":"Phenomenal!  Delicious food and excellent service.  I had braised lamb dish, veg combination platter and tried my cousin's chicken - every single thing was great. They even offer glutine free injera."}
{"text":"Great food and great atmosphere. Make sure to ask for a traditional table"}
{"text":"Now this is some REAL Ethiopian food!   Empress Taytu is a gem. It's authentic, and family run. The minute you enter, you forget about the fact that you are in one of the shittiest neighborhoods in Cleveland! You can hear the women speaking ... well, Ethiopian, I guess! When you walk in the entire staff is dressed in traditional Ethiopian clothing, and they welcome you warmly. They even have a grass-roofed hut to sit under for dinner, which makes you feel you are enjoying your meal outdoors. You sit on low African seats around a woven basket table, and the waitress brings you hot cloths to wash your hands with right away.   When your food comes, it is laid out on a large round serving tray which is lined with Injera bread. The food is served in neat little piles on top of that. Each person gets their own basket of fresh injera to tear away, and \"pinch\" the different meat and veggie dishes with. Of course, you eat with your hands.   Empress Taytu has a few beer, wine, and mixed drink selections. They also have a coffee ceremony to end the meal with.   Now that I live in San Diego, I sure do miss Empress Taytu! It was a first-rate experience at a super reasonable price!"}
{"text":"I love that there is an Ethiopian restaurant in Cleveland. They aren't that easy to come by even in bigger cities. I think this one is pretty good. It really only seems to have the basic dishes, but unless you eat here every day I think that's enough. I always order the vegetable selection and have never been disappointed. If you like etiopian food this place has a fine selection."}
{"text":"empress taytu is exciting because it is: a) an ethiopian restaurant and b) an etiopian restaurant in cleveland (i'm not sure that anyone else can hold stake to that claim?)  the food was great, though i have no idea what i ordered (i think we took the server's advice for something with meat, greens, veggies and was spicy!) like the previous reviewer, i too got the opportunity to sit under the grass-roofed hut. this is a great place to go with a group, and be sure you go on an empty stomach b/c portions aren't small!"}
{"text":"Serendipitous find off the freeway in Cleveland, east of the Zoo. Rush hour traffic dispersed as we dined on exotic cuisine.  Lovely service, reasonable prices, easy parking."}
{"text":"Overall, this is a decent Ethiopian dining experience. This was out first time.  Ambiance was great.  The food itself was good but a little blander than we like our Ethiopian.  Personally, warm injera is more appealing and theirs is served cold.  It's great there's a decent option in Ohio.  Otherwise, it's Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I went to Empress Taytu with a group (my boyfriend had been previously and said it was good) and I was really excited since one of my fave spots in Atlanta was an Ethiopian place.  Atlanta has a large Ethiopian community so there are a number of options.  I've heard that this might be one of the only Ethiopian places in Cleveland - I would encourage any Ethiopians in the area who have considered opening one to do so.  The place is really cute and we were greeted by a couple of friendly people.  The menu would be better if the items had details regarding the various dishes.  The service would be better if it were more attentive.  I don't think it is a matter of a language barrier, by the way.  There were no mistakes in our meals.  They took forever to arrive and we didn't have much in the way of follow up from the waitress (I hate the word server).  Parking is limited but the bus seems to run right there.    I'm usually not picky about service- I'm a former waitress and I know it can be tough.  This place had some serious problems, though."}
{"text":"This experience was the most unique I have ever had! We opted for the traditional setting with the grass basket table under a grass hut. There was beautiful Ethiopian music playing in the background. The servers were very helpful and gave some fantastic recommendations. I would recommend the Beef Tibs.   Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the meal was experiencing eating with your hands. We had a lovely salad and meat dishes that we rolled in a kind of Ethiopian Crepe. Light and delicious!  I will say that if you're in a hurry this isn't your restaurant. It is one of those places that is perfect to meet up with friends and relax and enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"It was our first time trying Ethiopian cuisine and we had a great experience at Empress Taytu. The food was delicious and the service was attentive and friendly.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Ok. So I am a lover of ethiopian food and started this journey in college in michigan. I later moved to DC and continued to refine my palate of this delicious delicacy. I have gotten the same dish for 20 years and is the veggie combo which typically includes a variety of lentils greens and a cabbage carrots and potato dish. maybe a salad and injera.  This restaurant is good bc we only have one choice in cleveland. So with that said O am grateful I have at least one choice. If we had opts i wld try another place but find the food here good enough to satisfy my cravings. Location..in the city off beaten path  Staff and service changes depends on waitress"}
{"text":"My wife and I just moved to Cleveland from San Francisco. In San Francisco, we ate Ethiopian food at least 2-3 times per month, it was really a staple of our lives. We've travelled to Ethiopia twice as well. We were so relieved to find that this place existed and was on par with best Ethiopian food we've ever had. Not only that, but the experience was really wonderful. The owners were friendly. The interior is beautiful, covered in Ethiopian art work.   I imagine we will be coming back often now that we live in Cleveland (just an 8-minute drive from here in Ohio City when you take the Shoreway). What a treat!"}
{"text":"Very nice good esp Sambusa and Shiro ... Good service too would love to visit many times again."}
{"text":"This place is really great if you love African cuisine.  I loved the fun d√©cor, but also the fact that they had Ethiopian TV running in the background, great for ambiance.  We got the Sambusas as an appetizer, and the Dorowat and Minchetabish for entrees.  The portions initially looked small, but there was more than enough food for my SO and I, and we left stuffed and satisfied.  Took off 1 star for the service being a little slow, but really with the atmosphere and music, we didn't mind taking our time here."}
{"text":"This place was great. First off the decor and ambiance was amazing. It's so unique inside. Everyone is friendly and smiling, the waitress was so attentive and so concerned with us having a good experience. We ordered the vegetarian and a chicken combo. Expect to eat with your hands-the waitress brings a steamed towel to was hands, which is a lovely cleansing experience. Everything on both plates was delicious and very flavorful, some very unique tastes with each bite. We also ordered dessert - the peanut butter injera with honey and the Taytu cake with ice cream covering the cupcake. Both desserts were to sweet and an Ethiopian take on something you could order at an American restaurant, but I would recommend trying them. The portions were huge and we both took leftovers home. It's an experience, so share it with someone adventureous enough to enjoy it!"}
{"text":"I was really disappointed food was cold and injera wasn't real most don't know any better .I travel on the road and I was craving my husbands mom food .Guess I should have waited till I was home in Atlanta.Then you want  me ti give you three dollars to give me real injera?Huh?That's crazy."}
{"text":"Went back here again today. This time had the shambousa, misi, chicken tib,yellow split pea and collard greens. This is such a nice little restaurant. I enjoy trying new dishes and I recommend it to others."}
{"text":"We ordered an appetizer platter, three dinner combinations, and one dinner entree. I think the combinations are the way to go. It was impossible for the four of us to finish it all, and we all left extremely satisfied and talking about the next time we would come back. I cannot wait to experience this again."}
{"text":"Very nice and authentic place. Would recommend getting a traditional table setting, than just a table and chair. Very authentic decor.  As for food, very eclectic taste. Would definitely recommend the mushrooms and chicken dorawat. If someone's in a brace mood, would definitely recommend the raw beef.  Try the traditional \"their own specific\" drink too."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in this experience. After trying Ethiopian food in SFO, I was expecting similar experience. We were in a group of 5 adults and a baby. The Good: Place was empty....as expected on Thursday night. So no waiting. And food arrived quickly. Service was good. The hostess made recommendations which have us a chance to sample the variety. The decor was typical of Ethiopian restaurants. The not so good: Food. Really - it was bland and highly under seasoned. Only their lentil/legume preparation was good.  The greens and cabbage/carrot thing were not appealing at all.  Also, they automatically added a side salad (lettuce, 6-7 tiny diced pieces of tomatoes, 2-3 sprigs of purple cabbage) to our meals and charged $3 for it.  Its not about the $3 but more about the fact that I felt deceived.   All in all - I don't feel like going back.  But based on reviews, I will go again on a busier day.  Maybe we just caught a trainee chef on a weekday evening."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. We had 12 of us on a Friday night and we had a great time. Good food and strong drinks. Beef sambusa is a must. I had the beef and it was amazing for something fun and different try it. My little 6-year-old boy didn't dig it though."}
{"text":"Really solid Ethiopian food, and definitely the best I've had in Cleveland.  The service is the only thing that gets them dinged a bit.  It is really hit or miss, depending on the night."}
{"text":"This was my 4th visit (over the past 10 years) and I have enjoyed the unique experience and cuisine each time I go.  This time it was with a co-worker, and we have a delicious meal under the hut.  We ordered drinks (Ethiopian wine and a cocktail) and settled in with a Sambusa appetizer, the lentil version.  The small pastry shells were filled with a seasoned mix of lentils and served with a spicy dipping sauce...what a great way to start the meal!  For the main dish(es), we decided to split both a vegetable combination and a double-meat combination.  They came out (together) in a large, shallow basket lined with Injera and served \"family style\".  The vegetable combination had five different items...kik (yellow split pea), misir (lentils), gomen (collards), tikil gomen,(cabbage), and kai'sir (beets & potatoes).  The kai'sir was the only cold item, all the rest were served warm.  The kik and misir were the stars of the show, the gomen and tikil gomen were on the spicier side of the plate.  The double-meat combination came with two meat stews: Dorowat (chicken) and segawa (beef).  The chicken was good, but the segawa beef was truly outstanding with its smoky, spicy flavors just pouring out.  All of these items are intended to be eaten with the Injera (served in a basket on the side) by tearing off small bits and using them as your utensil.  The experience is unique and fun at the same time to share in a communal meal.  After dinner we decided to partake in their traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremony (we did the decaf version).  First, the roasted beans are brought to your table where you get to \"sample\" the aromas before the actual coffee is made.  Then later, when the tray is brought to your table there is a wonderfully aromatic incense burning and the coffee is served with a small side of ambasha bread to leisurely consume while you sip.  The entire meal experience is wonderful, and the servers are so polite and attentive.  This is really a wonderful experience for a group of folks or even a small to-person gathering.  So glad this place continues to thrive!"}
{"text":"I really can't say thanks to this place enough.  When I was a youth growing up in the wastelands of North East Ohio, there weren't exactly a lot of options for food.  You could go to McDonalds...or a McDonalds clone.  TGIFridays...or a Fridays clone.  Thankfully, when I was 16 or so I discovered this place.  Thanks for diversifying my palate, Empress Taytu.  You remain the standard I judge other Ethiopian restaurants against to this day, 15 years later."}
{"text":"The food is So good!!! Such a unique experience and the restaurant atmosphere is a must see! The coffee ceremony is really tasty and fun too! Great for a date night or with a group of friends! Love the eating with your hands concept and the spongy bread is delicious!!"}
{"text":"YES 100% YES to this amazing restaurant. This is not just dinner, this an entire experience. My family opted for the traditional table setting which I highly recommend for the experience. The food was delicious and fun to eat. I myself had the Chicken Tibs which were juicy and deliciously spiced. I also tried a bit of my mother's Bozena shiro which was delicious. After dining, we partook in the coffee ceremony and it was an unforgettable event. The coffee was so aromatic and tasted absolutely delicious. The coffee ceremony was an amazing end to our delicious dinner and I definitely recommend trying it if you can!   I must admit that I have never had Ethiopian food before dining here, so I am unable to speak to the authenticity of the food. I can speak to the deliciousness of it though. It was a unique experience eating with my hands and creating what basically amounted to little burritos with their injera (flatbread-type food) and my chicken. It was fun to create my own food.   The waitress was amazingly nice and definitely willing to recommend food to those who are not familiar with Ethiopian food. I often times find myself recommending Empress Taytu to friends who want a nice, interesting night out. If you haven't tried it yet, you should!"}
{"text":"My partner and I came in for dinner. We love Ethiopian so we were excited to try this place out. Completely ignored me when I walked in and waited to be seated. Someone FINALLY gets us a seat.  Then, thirty minutes go by. We were completely ignored the whole time. We sat and watched everyone else get served or acknowledged. The restaurant wasn't even busy. A simple \"we'll be right with you\" would have been enough. Nah. We were completely ignored. After thirty minutes of that...we got up and left. Great service!"}
{"text":"Authentic Ethiopian food with, sadly, authentic Ethiopian service.    The good news; the food here is great.  You can eat at a small hut, and have the bread spread over the table like pizza dough, and eat little bits of spiced vegetables and meats by tearing off the bread and then scooping it up with your hands.  It's phenomenally tasty, even though you should be warned that the bread WILL expand in your stomach.    When you're done, you can have genuine Ethiopian coffee, which is like thick Turkish coffee but a little more cinnamony.  The only problem?  Don't come here unless you have some SERIOUS time to kill.  We spent two hours, and the coffee took - no joke - another hour to get.  It was delicious, but every time we've thought about going back, we asked, \"Do we have the time?\"  And we've heard from friends that the situation hasn't improved."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this spot! Authentic Ethiopian for sure. We've been on several occasions and haven't chosen anything we've disliked. Recommend the lamb or beef tibs and the vegetarian platter, that way you get to taste a variety of their selections. The coffee ritual is also recommended at least once. Look to spend about $75-100 (includes tip) for two - totally worth the experience. Nevertheless just go and know yourself of the goodness!"}
{"text":"How does this place have 4 stars?  Can we say disappointment?  Empress Taytu was my first Ethiopian food experience and has steered me away from Ethiopian cuisine.  Well not necessarily Ethiopian food yet, but definitely this restaurant.  The atmosphere was a mishmash of Hawaiian Tiki Bar with rural Ethiopia- State of confusion?  The restaurant is in a state of needing repairs with warpped walls and water damage through out the ceilings and walls.    I ordered a glass of Ethiopian honey wine that was sweet, but not worth $6.50 for 4-5 oz of wine.  My friend had bottle of Brazilian beer that had a slightly chocolately taste that was yummy for $4.50.   We had the appetizer combination with the meat and vegetarian sambusas.  I didn't enjoy the meat sambusas, but the lentil sambusas were tasty.  The collard green/cottage cheese were mushy and left a terrible aftertaste in my mouth.  The appetizer was $12.00 for 4 mini sambusas and a bowl of collard greens/cottage cheese  For our entree we shared the combination platter.  The platter was just composed of several piles of different kinds of mush.  The mush piles included \"just ok\" yellow split peas, spicy chicken that had a gamey taste, bland ground beef, bland cabbage, bitter/awkward tasting collard greens, and dry red lentils.    The bread served with the meal is cold and doughy (like a wetter/grainer pizza dough)- Ethiopian food is served without eating utensils.  The entree altogether was $17.00  The service dragged- we waited 20 minutes for drinks and another 20 minutes for appetizers and then 25 minutes later our food slowly trickled out of the kitchen.  I was done with what I was willing to eat on my plate before other members of the table even got their food.  The bill came out to 60.00 for 2 drinks, 1 appetizer, and 1 entree- severely overpriced for its decor, location, and food.  I ended up eating at another restaurant because I was only able to eat a few things."}
{"text":"The environment is very authentic to what I would imagine to what an Ethiopian eatery would look like. The service was good, they worker are beautiful and the food was amazing and very well seasoned. I would definitely go back and would suggest this place to anyone who would like to expand their taste palette."}
{"text":"Wow!  Talk about a unique place.  The ambiance is like nothing else in the city that I've experienced.  If you want authentic, then this place is for you.  The staff are extremely nice and the food was great."}
{"text":"Can you believe there is only one Ethiopian Restaurant in all of Cleveland? That fact would be most upsetting if Empress Taytu wasn't so good! If you haven't been here, you are missing out! The dal and collard greens dishes are amazing, and you have to try the 'coffee experience.'  Empress Taytu is certainly on my Top 10 vegan-friendly places to visit in Cleveland. http://veganhostess.com/vegan-cleveland-restaurants-coffee-shops-more/"}
{"text":"Great food!! Veggie combo was awesome. Lamb dish was heated with charcoal. Unique experience. If you dont mind eating without utensils go for it."}
{"text":"Great authentic food, spectacular service and a welcoming staff. My first time eating Ethiopian food and I was stunned! The meat and veggie combo was superb! It was so flavorful and delicious. The ingredients they use are fantastic! The coffee ceremony was a once in a lifetime experience. Definitely one of the best restaurants in greater Cleveland."}
{"text":"Try it for the sense of adventure and discovery. Try it for the genuine warmth and kindness of the people. Try it for the delicious food that you eat with your hands. Just try it.  The d√©cor is cozy, island-y, authentic-feeling, and pleasantly dated. My table of four split four vegetarian entrees and it was more than enough. Airy pancakes are used to scoop and eat the food. The pancake texture is really odd -- but in a good way; you'll see what I mean when you get your own paws on them. Each entree was $9-10.  The people working here couldn't have been any more warm and friendly.  I want to go back and share it with more friends. Soon!"}
{"text":"I think I'm still digesting my food, if that's possible a week later.  I left this place STUFFED!  I didn't really know what to expect from Empress Taytu since I'd had pretty limited experience with Ethiopian food but I was surprised and pretty satisfied with the menu.  Likes:  the atmosphere, service, variety of dishes (Sambusas, Kik-alicha (yellow split pea), misir (red lentils), Dorowat (chicken) and  minchetabish (beef)), the way in which it was served (family style), the drinks (the Ethiopian honey wine and the Sevastapol were amazing).  Dislikes:  price!  this place was waaaaaay pricier than I expected and it is price and price alone that will make me think twice about visiting again.  It just seems like a little too much money for chicken, veggies and lentils."}
{"text":"If you're looking for Ethiopian food north of Columbus, this is the only place in Greater Cleveland where you can find it.  That being said, everything here - from the wall decorations to the food - has a degree of uniqueness that cannot be easily duplicated from those not intimately familiar with it!  Having been to Ethiopia (2007) I can attest to the authenticity of this establishment and the cuisine that it serves.    Being a vegetarian, I usually order the Bayanetu (vegetable platter) which is served on a round platter with enjera (Ethiopian flatbread), a bread made from teff flour that acts as both a utensil and a food item. It already goes without saying that the coffee is a must have, if you can appreciate the best tasting coffee in the world.  Now, the only reason that I omitted a star is due to the high prices of menu items. If this restaurant were in the D.C area, which is home to the largest Ethiopian community outside Ethiopia, it would have a difficult time staying in business as the prices would be considered too high compared to the dozens of other Ethiopian establishments in the National Capital region.  Here in Cleveland however, it is a lone fixture on an otherwise barren landscape that caters to a predominately non-Ethiopian customer base. Still, the quality of the food is excellent and the portions are generous, which is why I would recommend it to anybody!"}
{"text":"I tried Empress Taytu twice before writing this review, and was not impressed either time. Ethiopian is one of my favorite cuisines, and I'm always looking for good places when we're on the road. Unfortunately, this place does not qualify. The food, while not terrible, is not very good. Ethiopian food is all about the deft handling of spices, and Empress' food is bland and uninteresting. The vegetable stew, greens and legumes that come with the vegetable sampler don't have that quality that I'm looking for in great Ethiopian food...ya know, when you just want to keep eating it? I also don't like the fact that the injera arrives at the table cold. The stews don't hold their heat well when they're sitting on cold injera. Again, not terrible food, but I won't be going back. I'm seeing alot of great reviews here on Yelp for this place, so I'll make one suggestion; if any of you are ever in Indianapolis, try Abyssina Ethiopian Restaurant on 5352 W 38th St. This is the standard bearer for me in the U.S. for great Ethiopian food, and is truly excellent."}
{"text":"Wonder why this place only has 3.5 stars! It has a really sweet ambience..the food is awesome especially for vegetarians... We had the sambusa.. The vegetarian platter and the shiro... Everything was really good but the highlight was the Shiro... It does not come with the platter but it is a must order!"}
{"text":"If you're looking to try something unique in the Cleveland area, I definitely recommend Empress Taytu. I went with a couple friends and we ate in the traditional style and really enjoyed our experience. I appreciated the number of meatless options while my buddies were intrigued and excited for the dishes with raw meat  a little something for everyone! My only disappointment was that we were excited to try the coffee ceremony however when we tried to order they said it would be over a 40 minute wait. It was a busy night so I definitely understand! Either way, we will be back to try for it again soon"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! Love the decor. If you want a truly different and delicious food experience try Empress Taytu. You will will leave happy! Plenty of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Excellent ambiance and food. We tried their ambasha, meat and veggie combo. Loved their veggie and meat combo. It was delicious. All the dishes were well prepared. Overall loved the experience. Will definitely go back.   Excellent idea for large groups"}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite restaurants! Every worker had a wonderful attitude and I had no problems with the service. The food is delicious, I have never had a bad dish. I would recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"My first time having Ethiopian food.  The service was perfect and the food was amazing.  The atmosphere was very inviting and beautiful.  I highly recommend the lamb and tilapia. Get the appetizer combo! Definitely visit!"}
{"text":"Empress Taytu is an Ethiopian delight. My vegan friend and I wanted to eat somewhere Saturday that would fit his dietary needs and he recommended coming here if I was up for an adventure and I am happy we went!  Empress Taytu is in a somewhat depressing, desolate, warehousey part of Cleveland; and like most things it pays to stray from the beaten path.  We were seated traditionally in comfortable arm chairs around a woven table with a recessed surface. Our table was under a straw roof hut of sorts, in a comfortable and cozy setting.  While I enjoy my meal, the best thing I had was the Brazilian beer, Xingu (strange, in a Ethiopian restaurant). The black beer has the look of stout but is smooth and pretty light and absolutely fantastic.  The food was good, not amazing but solid. We had red lentil samoas, accompanied by a chili-type salsa/dip that were very good. We also had some greens with a think bread (not injera) that was also pretty tasty and very earthy. For dinner we both ordered the Vegetarian Combo that had red and yellow lentil dishes, greens and some cabbage on a bed of injera PLUS some on the side. There was enough for at least four people. Injera can be a bit strange for those who have never tried it, myself included. It is thin, spongy bread that is the medium used to eat the dishes. Pull, tear, scoop, eat. It is rather plain so as not to influence or overpower the food and is not something to be afraid of. It holds up well with each dish we ate. Kind of like the tortilla's thicker cousin.  All in all, dinner was very good. The food was flavorful, the staff was kind and the was beer delicious. I would recommend checking it out and don't forget the Xingu."}
{"text":"Despite the neighborhood which leaves much to be desired, this restuarant is authentic and lovely.  I am tall, my date, also tall. We sat at the traditional basket tables underneath the thatch hut-like roof. We looked like Will Ferrel in Elf, and felt a bit silly, but it would not have been the same without the table designed for the food.  I seriously can not tell you what we ordered, we got an appetizer sampler and a meal sampler.   All of the bread is delicious and unlike anything I had ever had. I LOVE bread and was delighted to try a different kind. I may even purchase the flour used to make it.   It was definately not a first-date kind of place. You should know the person you are eating with pretty well considering the lack of utensils.   I really like the warm towel they provided to cleanse your hands before the meal."}
{"text":"From my personal experience,  people either like Ethiopian cuisine or don't care for it.   The aromatics and spice combinations used along with the eating with your hand aspect could be somewhat intimidating to some.   However,  the chances of anyone enjoying this cuisine can be ruined by poor service and long wait times.  I used to frequent Empress Taytu some years ago and recently went back after a lengthy period of break.  I'm very sad to have to agree with some of the recent reviews on the very poor quality service here.   I can clearly understand how for a first timer, the poor service can completely make the experience unworthy of time and price at Empress Taytu.  This can happen to even repeat customers like myself.  The taste of food hasn't change here from when I remember.   However the service quality has significantly degraded here.  Our drinks came out almost 30 min after the order, in stages and sometimes wrong. Our food came out almost an hour and forty five minutes after our order.  We were one of 3 other parties in the restaurant - where one party had 2 people and the other only 4.  The restaurant was only probably 15% capacity during the whole time.  Being the only viable option of Ethiopian cuisine in Cleveland,  Empress Taytu could  resurrect its past glory of excellent food paired with excellent service.  They can also consider updating their interior decor while still maintaining an authentic cultural flare to the space.  Some of the dated aspects could be replaced with some of the modern cultural items.   The service quality most definitely needs to be re-planned.  The kitchen needs to be better staffed with more quicker turnaround without sacrificing quality - they did it before, I'm sure they can do it again.   The attentiveness of wait staff needs to be significantly improved and if some menu items or drink items need to be reduced to increase the efficiencies in other areas then such could be considered.  At present the price to quality ratio is far too imbalanced for Empress Taytu to be considered a 'must-go' or even 'good-to-go' recommendation in my personal opinion."}
{"text":"Service was great! Food was okay. Wasn't sure what to expect since it was my first time trying Ethiopian food. Had the veg combination platter which was nice so that we could try different things. The variety of lentils and vegetables came with bread.  Not sure I would go again but definitely a good place to go if you're looking for something different to try."}
{"text":"Amazing exotic food. Loved it! And the staff was great in explaining everything. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I ordered the yebeg tibs (lamb) and traded a salad for the pepper it comes with. The lamb tasted okay, but did not taste like what I wanted/expected. It had flavoring such as rosemary and some other herb that just didn't belong!! I'm so annoyed because this dish cost $27 and I wanted it to taste more like what I'm accustomed to with Ethiopian food. It's definitely waaaaaaay over priced. I've never paid anywhere near these prices for Ethiopian food, so that's the reason I gave 2 stars instead of 3. So disappointed. They were very generous with the injera though."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. We enjoyed our dinner here. There is parking on the side of the building."}
{"text":"This is one of the most different and exciting restaurants I've ever been to.  I have only experienced one other Ethiopian restaurant, but this one beats it hands-down, both in terms of food and the overall experience.  One can choose to eat western-style at a table, or in traditional Ethiopian fashion, which is what I would recommend: in a small hut built into the restaurant, around a lower table with lower seats.  Food is then brought out and served with bread, which can be used to pick up the food, eating with your hands.  The food itself is amazing: bold flavors, totally unlike anything one would encounter in the types of Cuisine that most Americans have had contact with.  Perhaps the closest I would describe it to is the rich Indian curry dishes, although the food here has a very different flavor and is much less heavy.  Everything I have had here has been outstanding.  The service is good and the whole experience is worthwhile: even the menu is written both in English and in the Ethiopian script.  One can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Are you looking for a new exotic place to eat with healthy food options? Look no further. The empress Taytu is very authentic, delicious and an overall experience that you will want to have again. Don't forget to have the tea ceremony experience under the indoor hut ceremonial area. Injera bread was never more tasty. Get in there, eat with your hands, have a true Ethiopian experience. Awesome place to eat, don't think twice about coming here."}
{"text":"I adore this place! So underrated. Fun festive environment, traditional seating is awesome and cozy under the tiki huts and food is fabulous! Everyone I've ever taken has thoroughly enjoyed it much to their surprise. I recommend getting the combination appetizer and combination dinner plus the Indian beer. Share all of it with someone - it's enough for 2. AND EAT WITH YOUR HANDS! It's all part of the fun and experience!"}
{"text":"If service is this slow in Ethiopia, now we know why they starve there.  I kid, I kid.  But this was my first Ethiopian restaurant, so I was fairly excited to come here.  I was even more thrilled that they have a parking lot hidden from St. Clair - saying that parking on the street is unwise here is an understatement.  So I come in only to see the place seemingly abandoned.  I mean, the place had authentic decor and even a television playing Ethiopian music videos, but I couldn't explain why only two girls were working when they were aware that I was in a party of 10 or so.  There were two other sizable parties, as well, so that makes the under-staffing that much more baffling.  I was also told there was only one person working in the kitchen, as well.  If it means anything, the outfits the servers/bartenders/busgirls are forced to wear are cute in an interesting, ethnic way.  As I said earlier, service was incredibly slow.  It took about 20-30 minutes just to get our drinks.  By the time we got our drinks, we were ready to order - their menu is clear, even if it is a bit wordy, so you have a good idea of what you are about to digest.  I asked for a refill right after I ordered.  Or was it before?  I don't know.  Anyway, the refill took another 20-30 minutes just to retrieve.  They finally relented and rushed out a giant pitcher of water for my party to share.  Ethiopian food is exotic in the Cleveland area (or anywhere in the U.S.), so I understand how difficult it is to make.  Even if it is difficult to make, that does not explain why I had to wait two hours for a giant tub of meat with the spongy bread that all food here comes with, some cottage cheese and a few pieces of salad (\"greens\").  TWO FREAKING HOURS FOR THAT?!?!  They seriously need to hire more people to accommodate larger parties.  It got to the point where I was discussing the intricacies of Pokemon card collecting with a (rather awesome) seven year-old just to keep myself from falling asleep in my comfy seat.  I could forgive them for their distastefully slow service if their food was legendary.  Unfortunately, I cannot find it in my soul to do so.  The food was merely average.  The only things that seemed ethnic about the food were the seasonings and the bread.  In other words, it tasted Americanized.  My taste buds weren't introduced to anything new when I went.  Except for the bread.  I don't know what they call that bread, but it was absorbent and porous.  It expands in your stomach, just a word of advice.  While I didn't drink - I had a drive to make back to Akron - the people I went with did.  The beer and wine menu appeared to be long and exotic.  They have domestic beers (God forbid), as well as Ethiopian beers and wines and alcoholic products from India and Japan, among other places.  Something just doesn't seem right about eating Ethiopian food while drinking sake, but I'll let that one slip.  If I could summarize this place in one corny phrase, it would be \"come for the authentically Ethiopian experience, leave for the authentically bad service\"."}
{"text":"My friend and her family introduced me to this place not too long ago and I had the greatest experience ever! Trying new ethnic foods was so exciting and everything was delicious! Staff was very friendly and welcoming. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Insta-meh as soon as we walked in the door.   With all the build up about this place, I couldn't believe how disappointed I was with Empress Taytu. It was completely empty inside when we arrived, so I'm not entirely sure why 1) our dinner took 2 1/2 hours and 2) we were the first people there, but the last to leave.   I will say that maybe I'm just not a big fan of Ethiopian cuisine, but typically I can forgive lack luster food when the ambiance and service are amazing. This was not the case tonight. Although, since this was my first experience I'm not ready to judge all Ethiopian off this visit.   Also, we did have a pretty tasted appetizer that was similar to an Indian samosa. I just wish I was as pleased with the rest of my meal. My bill was really high and I barely touched my food. The \"womp\" elf has definitely struck."}
{"text":"Such a great experience and amazing food but be ready to wait. Don't go in a hurry but to relax and enjoy the experience. Went with a group of 7 and we're there for a total of 2 and 1/2 hours. Took about 1/2 hour to get our drinks. It was well worth our wait though. Our food was amazing! I was not familiar with Ethiopian food or the tradition of eating with your hands but it was a lot of fun and different than any place I have ever been."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times. Empress Taytu isn't on my radar - But I think I know why. This ISN'T a restaurant you go to because EVERYONE is raving about it. It's a restaurant to go to because no one seems to really know about it. It's a secret. And that's why I like it so much!  When you walk in - you don't feel like you're in Cleveland anymore. It is decorated to look like you are about to share delicacies with Anthony Bourdain or Andrew Zimmern in some Ethiopian village with local friends that you just made acquaintance with. If you can snare one of the little drum tables (Get it? snare... drum...) (I digress...) with the cute wooden chairs - you absolutely must! It's going to add so much more to your dining experience.   I think it's important to note that Ethiopian food is extremely healthy, and if you are vegan or vegetarian you are going to find just as many enticing menu options as your carnivorous friends.   The most recent time I went to Empress Taytu, I made reservations through Yelp. I never knew this was an option before and I have to say the process was executed flawlessly.   We started our meal with a bottle of Spanish red and ordered two appetizers; we got Timatim Salata - which is a lightly seasoned and very refreshing tomato salad. You use the injera bread to eat this. Warm skillet bread comes with the Ambasha, which is a delightfully seasoned home made cottage cheese. This appetizer was so much lighter than the cottage cheese we're all used to. It actually reminded me of tofu that's been food processed to mimic feta cheese on salads. It's light and almost powdery in texture. It was the hit of the evening. Honestly!  We split the Meat and Veggie Combination Entr√©e. And - by then we realized, we ordered way too much food! But it was all soo good! I REALLY like to have a taste of everything and this was such a great way to try meats, veggies, cheeses, and breads that are exotic and unusual.  Our waitress was smiley and she aided in our decision-making. We were well taken care of. I think it was my best visit yet. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I like exotic food and new experiences and Empress Taytu serves up both.  Get the meat and veggie combo and extra injera (spongy bread as my boyfriend continues to call it). The spicy stuff is actually spicy so make sure you're ready!"}
{"text":"I love this place and have been many times over the past few years. It's usually empty, but most places on the East side usually are. I don't mind at all. It's a relaxing atmosphere. The staff (all family, I think) are sweet, and I love watching the videos and listening to the music.  The doro wat is one of the best things on the menu. The chicken always falls right off the bone. But honestly, I like pretty much everything. There have been occasions when the food was a little cooler than I would have preferred, but nothing to make me stop going. I've eaten Ethiopian food in NYC, Chicago, and Boston. I think this easily compares."}
{"text":"This seemed like a really popular date spot!  We got the vegetarian and the double meat combination. The red lentils were a hit among our party. My personal favorite was the beets and potatoes. I recommend the beef over the chicken as the latter came out a bit dry.  It took quite a while to get our food, but the service was incredible otherwise. Our waitress was super helpful in explaining the menu!"}
{"text":"Wonderful experience!!! The food was authentic and delicious, our server was from Ethiopia and was very nice and friendly, the environment was authentic, and the coffee service was great! I highly recommend this restaurant. It takes a little time, as many good things do, and it is worth it. I also suggest you try the traditional tables."}
{"text":"Being the original Ethiopian restaurant in Cleveland, I went into this place with pretty high expectations and I wasn't disappointed. I'd say this is the best Ethiopian restaurant in Cleveland.  The inside is decorated very nicely. There is a great selection of food to choose from. We orders the meat and veggie combo which was more than enough for 2 people. This turned out to be a fantastic choice and the injera bread was really good. The service at the restaurant was very good as well overall. The only downside to this place I experienced was that it closes at 10pm. But all things considered, I will be giving this place a visit again when I have a craving for Ethiopian food."}
{"text":"Total Clip joint. Stay away.  Very rare for me to give one star.  This place sucks.  Everything about my meal just plain sucked.  I got the meat and veggie combo.  It should have been called the \"this meat and veggie combo sucks\".   The chicken was maybe 2 ounces of meat and it was not even hot. Flavor was OK. Then some type of ground beef that was barely a dollop and was not even hot.  The cabbage was not even cooked and it was cold also. The refried red bean were just average with out much flavor, and again it was luke warm, the chickpea was bland and cold as well. Lastly, one of the veggie items was a sorry excuse, it was just some spring mix lettuce in the middle of the plate.  The sponge bread was cold as well.    Well that's my review cuz this place really sucks.  Such a rip off.  Oh yeah the service, I asked if my food could be spicy and the waitress said no, I asked if the food was precooked and she said  it was not.  OK so why can't you make it spicy?  So I asked for some hot sauce and the waitress said they did not have any.  Finally the bus boy who overheard me and saw that I wanted to kill the server brought me some.  Oh the best part was adding 20% tip on the whole amount of the check including the tax.  Screw this place. If I was not with a big party I would have have just left, not even bother to complain."}
{"text":"Every year I pick a new-to-me restaurant to dine at for my birthday.  This year (last week), it was Empress.  As a former west coaster, I am used to having several Ethiopian restaurants to choose from, so having only one in Cleveland made me curious and a little suspect.  Thankfully, Empress came through for us.  Many other reviewers complained about slow service.  I warned the three friends I was with that the service would be slow.  Granted, we weren't in a hurry, but I can honestly say our service was excellent.  Our server's name was Carolyn and she was lovely.  And we sat in a hut (!).  Our food was mostly delicious, minus the bland vegetables.  I recommend the lentil sambusa as an appetizer and one of the yetesenega karyas, if you dare.  We ordered a variety of meats and vegetables, but it was the segawat and dorowat that were the stand out dishes.  The injera bread was a milder flavor than we were used to, but the texture was perfect and we stuffed ourselves silly.  A glass of their honey wine washed it all down nicely.  Next time, we plan on ending our meal with the traditional coffee ceremony."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends for the second time in a couple of years, and I enjoyed my experience.  Despite many comments that this place is often empty, I found it to have a bit of activity there when I went on a late Saturday evening, but my group of 5 was still able to get a table without much wait time.  We had a few vegetarians in the group, so we limited ourselves to the vegetarian options and ordered the lentil sambusas, the misir, the shiro, and the kik-alicha.  All were delcious, and the dishes served family style left our group pleasantly full.  Admittedly, I'm not too experienced with Ethiopian food, as I've only been to one other Ethiopian restaurant in the past and have not quite developed a discerning taste.  However, it's the only Ethiopian place in Cleveland, so it allows some novelty to those who are curious.  I thought the decor was ok and enjoyed eating around their basket tables, though there were some somewhat unsteady small tables to set your drinks on.  It seems as if a number of reviewers are complaining about the service.  During my experience this time around, the service was somewhat slow, with our meal taking perhaps ~2 hours, but I had good company, and it was a chance to have good conversations.  I would go with a small-medium group and be prepared to have a lot of time to chit chat.  If you keep that in mind, I think it will be a better experience."}
{"text":"What a shame - I've been to Empress Taytu many times in the past. I've never gone on a night when I had somewhere to be. In the past, service has been a bit on the...we'll say \"laid back\" side but never to the point where it negatively affected my meal. The service has never been especially warm but I get the impression that that's more of a cultural thing. At any rate, I have a tendency to sing the praises of Ethiopian food to anyone who will listen and I'm always excited when I can talk one of my friends into making the drive up from Akron to try it out. On this particular night, which happened to be a friend's birthday, we had plans to attend a concert at the Grog shop. While not especially close to the Empress Taytu, they are both in East Cleveland so I suggested Ethiopian and the two guys I was with were on board. By the time we got there, we had a good hour and a half before we had to be at the Grog Shop. As soon as we walked in the door, we were asked of we had a reservation, which we did not. We were seated relatively quickly. We waited for someone to stop at our table. Another table was seated. We waited some more. A waitress stopped at the other table. We continued to wait. The waitress brought the other table's appetizer. My friends and I a started speculating about how we got passed up. Did they forget about us? Were we in the wrong section? Should we say something? My friend suggested that maybe, because we didn't have a reservation, we were put at the bottom if the queue of tables to help. Maybe. Anyway, I suggested that we give it another 10 minutes and, if they hadn't said anything by then, we should cut and run. 10 minutes went by and still nothing. We got up, put our coats on, and left. I felt guilty about leaving but at this point, we had been there for almost 25 minutes without having anyone talk to us after we had been sat. Any longer and I feared we'd be late for our concert. So we left. Should I have said something? Maybe. Should we have made a reservation. Perhaps. In the restaurant's defense, I had never seen it that busy. Still it put a damper on my impression of an otherwise decent Ethiopian restaurant in Cleveland. The food there is pretty good, even better of you've never eaten Ethiopian food. Just don't go on a Saturday night without a reservation."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and it's really good Ethiopian food - definitely on par if not better than what I've had in other cities.  Plus, you get to eat in a hut.  Enough said.    Actually, not quite enough.  Get the veggie sampler and some mango juice.   So delicious.  If you're OK with meat, I've heard that the lamb is  great too.  Some of the dishes are pretty spicy, so you might want to ask them to tone it down a little if you're wimpy about that kind of thing.  Or have them point you to the milder dishes - there are a lot of them also.  The servers here are incredibly friendly and very knowledgeable about all the menu options.  They are also really slow.  I've never gone to Empress Taytu in a hurry because the food there is definitely worth savoring, but if you go, don't expect to get out of there in less than two very-well-spent hours."}
{"text":"Moving from NYC to Cleveland has caused for search for a great Ethiopian place.  The empress feels fairly authentic especially when you see the cooks in the kitchen doing their magic and again in landlocked Cleveland ingredients need to be imported or substituted.  Like Mexican food there is nothing like sitting down in Mexico to eat a meal and I believe that would be the same of Ethiopian food.    I give them high marks because I see they care and are doing their best here.   The staff are  friendly and when we bring our now 8 month old, he is greeted with warm smiles and waves."}
{"text":"Great food, lovely atmosphere, and very friendly service! Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"i have been here twice now, but twice in one month. I went here for the first time having no idea what to expect. I have never had Ethiopian. I was very, very happy with my meal. I got the Cabbage and potatoes. As a couple, we have had all of the veggie options. They are all fantastic, our least favorite being the collard greens.  I made the mistake of switching up my meal and trying the shrimp. I did not care for the shrimp. It tasted like it was from a bag. It was overpriced too, but I would go there again in a second to get more food!  The atmosphere is really great, and the servers are always so nice. They will answer questions about anything.   If you've never eaten ethiopian, you should know that you do not use silverware, you use a type of bread, to pick up your food. It is a very fun experience.  They also have an option to have a coffee ceremony for $10, but we have yet to do this, although i hope to at some point.  I will go back again!"}
{"text":"Different or unique certainly isn't synonymous with great. And it should never be mistaken as such.   Just because this is probably the only Ehiopian joint in Cleveland, just because you eat the pureed meat, lentils and veg with your fingers or scoop it with the porous indigenous bread, surely isn't reason enough to ignore the obvious. Giving this place a pass just because it's unlike anything you've probably dined on before would be a mistake.   I've been debating this review for a few days now. We came with a somewhat large group. At the time, I did have an enjoyable experience and didn't really mind the wait since I was in the company of some friends I haven't seen in a while. But after some reflection, I concluded two things specifically that were very inexcusable: the service is slow to the point of aggravating and the prices were way out of line.   Perhaps there was some sort of cost analysis and they had to adjust the prices to compensate for the servers/cooks taking twice/three times as long as compared to most places? If that's the case, the 2.5 hour meal (made up of mostly waiting) for $17+ per entree can be justified. But in the real food industry I know, in no way does the type of food we were served justify such a price point.   I could probably justify it if the service was better, but it wasn't. Our drink request took way too long to be ordered and served. I was then brought out the wrong glass of wine. I ordered a Cabernet and they brought be a sweet white wine of some sort. In frustration that some sort of liquid would be better than waiting another half hour for the correct drink, I just drank the mistake wine. Afterwards, the mistake wine was never offered to be replaced, nor was it taken off my bill even though I brought the mistake to the waitress' attention. A smile and a \"I'm sorry\" is all I got. Ooooo-kay...  About an hour into our drink, our food order was finally taken. When it was ready, it was brought out periodically in different intervals despite the entire table ordering at the same time. This of course was frustrating because proper etiquette usually involves not beginning to eat until the entire table is served their food. Again, another unforgivable mistake.   Overall, I don't think the novelty was worth it. I could be completely wrong about it though as others seemed to have had a better experience. Perhaps the kitchen and staff had an off-night? I'm not completely confident though."}
{"text":"I went with a friend when we found out that there is Ethiopian restaurant in Cleveland. Friendly staff, relaxed ambiance, and the coffee was excellent. We ordered combination platter so that we got to sample various items on the menu. The food was outstanding and delicious. Love the injera and the spices they use. The location was not in a decent area but don't let that stop you from checking it out if you are adventurous eater or like to try something new. The main attraction here was the food and it did not disappointed."}
{"text":"Decently unique, Empress Taytu offers a very interesting cuisine that is not increasingly available in Cleveland. Ethiopian food is something special that is homemade. I decided to try this restaurant after wanting to have Ethiopian food for awhile. The meal I had started with an appetizer which was sambusa filled with ground meet and for my entree I had beef tibs/ chicken dorowat which was simply amazing. The flavors of the spices were amazing and the injera bread was very good. To compliment this meal they have a lengthy list of Ethiopian beer which was a nice touch."}
{"text":"One of our top 5 restaurants in Cleveland.  Order the shiro and the lamb with awaze sauce."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in Cleveland. We go there so often.  Don't miss the atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"service is a tad slow, but the food does not disappoint. i go to harar so often that i dont even have to speak to order, the waiter/owner sees me and heads off to the kitchen to prepare my food. it's a friendly, laid back atmosphere. the number 17 with beans and carrots is a must try. i love harar, it's in my top 3 of places to eat in san diego."}
{"text":"If eating in a packed, noisy restaurant with slow service and pricey menu items (waiting for over 30min for your food to arrive after placing the order) is your thing, this place won't disappoint you, at least not on the weekends. We don't enjoy that kind of setting nor have the patience to wait that long for the food, regardless of the quality of the food, so we may not go again. The food quality and ambience was good, though we've eaten a lot better and a lot cheaper in Columbus' Lalibela and Addis restaurants."}
{"text":"The moment we walked in we knew the food would be good.  The first step we took inside welcomed us with a warm, inviting scent of exotic spices.  The atmosphere and decor, of an indoor thatched hut and basket-tables with various murals, will make you feel that for a short time, you are not actually living in Cleveland, but some foreign locale.  We got a meat sampler and veggie sampler to share and although it might not look like a lot of food, eaten with the injera they give you you will leave very full.  The meat dishes are actually more flavorful than the veggie dishes which I find unusual because at previous Ethiopian restaurants I've been to it's been the opposite case.  The tea we ordered was delicious, but we were a bit confused because we were served what looked like hot tea-colored liquid in a tea cup, and then a Lipton tea bag.  I tasted this tea-colored liquid.  Well, it tastes like spiced tea... but is that just the spices they add to the water, and then I put in the Lipton bag?  And if so, the \"Ethiopian spiced tea\" I ordered isn't very Ethiopian if there is Lipton in it, no?  I decided that the hot spiced liquid in the cup was good enough that it didn't need any Lipton mucking up the flavor."}
{"text":"Simple food with different flavors.  A place to eat what tastes like home cooked food in a cozy, unique atmosphere.  For those of you who have never had Ethiopian food, the meal typically consists of a spongy, slightly sour bread which is rolled out like a pizza on a tray.  Small portions of either vegetables, beans, lentils, or meat are spread out on the tray.  You eat with your hands - warm towels are provided before you eat.  Then you rip off a piece of the bread and then scoop up whatever combination of meat and vegetables you want.  Portions are filling and you can get more bread if you want.  The three star rating is only in comparison to other Ethiopian restaurants that I've been to.  I thought the last few times I went, the food was a little bit on the bland side.  An exception is the chicken drumstick, which I thought was really tasty.  But this is a place to consider if you have never eaten Ethiopian food and would like to experience it."}
{"text":"Cleveland has only one Ethiopian restaurant and rightly so because Empress Taytu gives you no reason to seek another place for Ethiopian food. The decor is traditional and well done. You get a glimpse of the rich culture from the beautiful dresses of the servers, to the artwork on the wall, and the music videos on the TV showcasing different styles of \"Eskista\" dancing. The servers do a fantastic job taking care of their guests and first timers will feel welcomed. They are open for dinner only and it does get busy. I have been here numerous times and always get the vegetarian platter. It's definitely a lot of food for one person but I skip lunch if I know I am dining here ;) The platter is absolutely delicious. Flavorful and fresh; mildly spiced. Despite how full I am, I always make room for the coffee. Do experience the coffee ceremony if in a group setting. And make sure you make no other plans after dinner, the meal definitely hits the spot and you will sleep real good my friend!"}
{"text":"After visiting many more Ethiopian restaurants, I now know how amazingly good Empress Taytu is. The food here is by far the best, full of warm, comforting flavors. Can't wait to visit again soon!"}
{"text":"Between the food and the funky decor, I could stay here forever.  The service is sweet and wonderful at this family establishment."}
{"text":"Limited vegetarian options that run the gamut from fantastic (spicy red lentils) to \"untasteful\" (greens).  Excellent service.  Hot towels before your meal (important when eating with your hands). Interesting Brazilian black beer.  A unique Cleveland experience. Definitely worth going at least once."}
{"text":"Cleveland offers a fantastic Ethiopian restaurant experience despite being the only offering in town.  Truly an Oasis located in a desert, my son and I went on New Years Eve before going to see Jeff Dunham at the Wolstein Center and were Wow'ed...what a great place to take family, friends or a date.  They have a private gated parking lot with the main entrance in the back and going inside made me smile at the attention to detail to create an environment (native huts protuding from the walls and corners) bringing the cultural experience alive...and provide an interactive learning experience to learn more about this far away land.  Displays abound around the restaurant giving it a museum-type experience  After reading a couple of the reviews, I hustled down there expecting slower service and was surprised when we had our food and drinks all delivered within 10 minutes. Not a big New Years Eve destination...we were just one of three tables.  We got the vegetarian platter and the #19 beef dish and it all was very tasty.  The red lentils were the only real spice-laden dish on the vegetarian platter and pledged to get this dish the next time I go and the meat dish had a spice to it as well.  If you don't like spice...you might want them to ask to tame those two dishes down a notch though I thought it was a \"just right\" kick that brought smiles to me and my 14 year olds face.  I did get the Mango and Blackcurrant Vodka drink and found it extremely sweet.  Great to counter act the spicy dishes and just a little too sweet for my palate."}
{"text":"Solid option for something off the beaten track in the Cleve. Good choices for vegetarians and meat eaters. I happen to like the injerra, but this bread seems to be polarizing. Honey wine is very nice compliment to the meal. The owners are nice, although service can be very slow if you don't stay on top of them."}
{"text":"It was a excellent and impressed experience to have dinner here. The atmosphere is exotic and service is friendly. The beef and shrimp that we ordered were so amazing. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you haven't, you should! Such a great experience and the food was delicious and not dumbed down for the sake of boring palettes."}
{"text":"First time eating Ethiopian foods. It was a great experience! I can't really remember what the dishes were called, but what I can tell you is that we had a combination appetizer (the only combo appetizer on the menu) and we shared a meat and veggie combination meal that was more than enough for the two-and-a-half of us. The food was good, the service was good to great, and we will certainly return to try more. Notes:  Some would consider it to be in a \"bad\" area but the restaurant has a dedicated parking lot that was gated when we arrived and it was no problem whatsoever, (you sissies). Also, know that this food is eaten with your hands. Off of a shared platter. My family first thought it would be great to bring the whole tribe here when they visit. Then I started thinking about my mother in law. And what it would be like to share spit...the moral here is to teach you party how to eat, and not lick off the fingers with each bite..."}
{"text":"Excellent food and interesting decor! Will come again soon! I had a side salad and the Foole. Both delicious. My partner had the vegetable combo. I will be  getting  that next time."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not the place it once was.  Sure, the food is still great, but the service, the building and the bread are not as great as they used to be.  I love Ethiopian food, and this place really delivers. I don't know the official names for everything, but my favorites are the chicken in spicy sauce and the spicy ground beef stew.  The lentils are fantastic, too.  Everything has subtle and complex spices and a tender texture.  Spicy here means just enough spice to give it a bit of zing, but not hot .  Add to this the fun of eating with your hands and you have an enjoyable meal...  ...if and when you get it.  It took the waitress about 15 minutes to come over and offer us drinks, then about 20 minutes until someone actually got theirs.  A few of us ordered cocktails, but most of us ordered wine and bottled beer.  Then, after a while, the servers took our orders.  Most of us got the meat and veg combo plate.  That is the most enjoyable way to get a taste of everything.  About an hour later some of us got our food.  Another 15 minutes later, some more of us got our food, then another 10 minutes later the rest of us were served.  this might not be so bad if the chef was making the food on the spot, but Ethiopian food is stewed for a very long time.  It has to be prepared hours in advance.  Therefore it took over an hour to warm up some stews.  Sadly the bread (injera) was not freshly made.  The usually wonderfully spongy, stretchy, crepe like bread was really cold, as if it had been pulled from the refrigerator.  Not great for picking up bits of warm stew.  The portions of stew were also rather small.  When the place first opened, you would get your plate, taste a little of everything, then the waitress would bring you more of what dishes you liked best.  Now, you only get the small tasting.  The place itself, while still decorated with beautiful murals and traditional tables and canopies, is in dire need of some TLC.  There were holes in the wall and a really scary bathroom.  So perhaps you should get take out of a single dish.  The food is worth braving E61st street."}
{"text":"I've never had Ethiopian food before trying this place. The atmosphere is great and the food is better!"}
{"text":"Don't expect silverware at this gem of a restaurant.  It is Ethiopian true and true-from what I can tell. Great for vegans and vegetarians.  We asked for a basket table where everyone shares the food.  No silver ware just Injera(a flat bread)  that you use to pick up your food.  There were 6 of us and we began with the appetizer combo.We all loved it.  Everybody at the table ordered a different main course.  It came out on a giant tray covered in Injera the meal you ordered is to be placed in front of you.  Ooops ours wasn't but we were all sharing everything. (Good Friends-not sure I would do this if I did not know the people I was with).  We were going to order the coffee ceremony but watched it at another table.  We were smoked out with the incense and did not stay for it.  Otherwise a great experience, delicious food."}
{"text":"Yummy food and very good service .. this is the second time that I have been here and still love the food . Food heaven for vegetarians . We always take the vegetarian combo as i like to taste a little bit of all the veggie food available although the misir , tikil Gomen and Kik alicha  are my favorites. The foule was also very yummy with the  ambasha bread. We went there for Valentine's Day and the server gave me a rose and I found it to be a sweet gesture."}
{"text":"My brother and I planned going out to dinner for the last month. We finally got together and he recommended coming here. He said it is his favorite place to eat in Cleveland. He is a vegan and they have plenty of options for him. We arrived shortly after 5, right when they opened. The asked if we would like to sit in the authentic seat, which is low seats with a table that has a bowl in the center covered with cloth. The interior is pretty cool. There are a few huts that you can sit under. The bar table is actually a hut also. The lighting was dim and inviting. The server was beautiful and the service was excellent. They bring steaming, hot towels to wipe your hands with before you eat. The appetizers were delicious. They bring out a bunch of these pancake type things that you use to grab up the food with. They look like sea sponges smushed into flat cakes. The bean dip side was good. So were the greens. My brother got a bean dish entree and the server recommended I try the beef cubes. It was great food. The experience was fun. I am going to start coming here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious! We had vegetarian and meat eaters and there was lots of options for everyone!! I would strongly suggest the combination plates. Don't let the neighborhood scare you off. Will definitely come back!!  And we came back and we still love it!!!!!"}
{"text":"It's rare that Cleveland has quality restaurants that aren't European or Asian. I came here with a group of friends and we enjoyed the traditional seating in a little enclave. I ordered the segawat (beef cubes) and, will admit that the injera (a spongy sourdough bread you wrap the food in) was a little different at first, it was all delicious to the very end.  Make sure you bring friends and know about gursha!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time in college.  Yes the atmosphere is great, nice that it is the only Ethiopian restaurant in Cleveland. it's in a crappy neighborhood and I didn't feel well after eating there.  I'll definitely pass on it.   but if you want an great and different experience then it's a go"}
{"text":"Sop up some overcooked hamburger meat with white bread instead.  Seriously the only truly awful Ethiopian restaurant I have ever tried.  I love this cuisine and enjoy it in most major cities across this country and a few overseas, I didn't know bad Ethiopian restaurants existed until I came here.  The food was greasy, overcooked and flavorless - and the prices were three times what I ever paid before, anywhere!  I wish I could give negative stars. I'm not kidding, words can't adequately describe how revolting this experience was.  I chose to introduce my father to Ethiopian food here after years of extolling its virtues and was painfully embarrassed.  No wonder the restaurant was empty - apperantly this is the norm?   I am baffled by the good reviews. The only people that could like this slop are people that are unfamiliar with food!"}
{"text":"My first, and so far best, dining experience at an Ethiopian restaurant. This is the place where I first discovered my love for injera (Ethiopian bread), beef tibs (cubes of beef marinated in an Ethiopian blend of spices), and tej (Ehtiopian honey wine). The food was truly amazing. The above mentioned items are must tries.   If you can't consume alcohol and cannot compliment your meal with the tej wine, the mango juice should suffice as a good alternative.   The vegetable combination is also delicious. The common vegetables, prepared with specialty spices in a uniquely Ethiopian fashion, provide a good balance to the meal when eaten with the meat dishes.   Also, if time and budget permit, try the authentic Ethiopian coffee \"ceremony.\" It is a bit pricey but it is one of those things you must try at least once. You sit on little footstools while the server performs the ritual coffee roasting ceremony basking those partaking with the wonderful scent of fresh Ethiopian coffee. The server then adds a tiny bit of butter into the coffee (instead of milk or cream), which is apparently how it is served in their country.   If and when you do come, try to sit under the hut in the corner of the room on the little stools and eat from the large communal plate on top of the traditional basket table stand - this will make the experience more enjoyable.   This restaurant is the most authentic Ethiopian establishment I have eaten at thus far. The ambiance is more authentic than any of the Ethiopian/East African restaurants in my hometown of San Diego, despite the much larger population of immigrants from the Eastern (Horn of) Africa region.   In fact, I enjoyed Ethiopian cuisine so much that one of the first things I did after I moved back to San Diego after college, was look for Ethiopian restaurants and try the ones I found. My friends and I enjoyed Empress Taytu so much that we made the 1+ hour drive from Wooster, just to come to here, numerous times after discovering this restaurant.   Keep in mind, this restaurant is not located in the best area of Cleveland. Nonetheless, this place as a must try even though the outside of the restaurant and surrounding neighborhood is less than aesthetically pleasing, to say the least."}
