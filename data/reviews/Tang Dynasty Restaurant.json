{"text":"Very authentic northwest style Chinese food. Order the Chinese burger, wide noodle, and lamb soup"}
{"text":"Came here while in Calgary on business for dinner.  Food was great (spicy pork noodle soup), service was prompt.  Also had the hockey game on TV.  Open Sunday night, inexpensive good food, good portions, friendly staff."}
{"text":"Spicy and Sour Pork Noodles with vegetables in soup was delicious and highly flavourful. I loved the noodles that came with it. It was medium sized and perfectly cooked. $10.99

Oil splashed hand pulled noodle with vegetable but not too bad , regular spicy was not spicy at all. Two scoops of their chilli oil definitely made a difference. The hand pulled noodles were cooked evenly and throughly; good texture. $10.99

Stretched Noodle with Scrambled Egg and Tomato Sauce kind of reminded me of a light tomato pasta. Still delicious but not as flavourful as the spicy and sour pork noddles. $11.99  

I'll definitely be returning to try the other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"five of us dining in this authentic Xi'an restaurant. We came at 8pm on Monday . The door was locked n no customers yet...but the owner let us in. We ordered ???????????????????? ?????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Very authentic Xi'an cuisine with housemade noodles.  The dishes are not really my thing but my coworker said it's pretty decent (albeit the food is a bit salty).  I think if you like spicy dishes (I don't) you will really enjoy the food here.  Definitely great service!"}
{"text":"This is a great addition to the hood. I tried the lamb with homemade noodles. The portion is massive, enough for two hungry people. The noodles are soft and slippery, chewy, long and wide. The broth was nice and hot. The lamb was tender and not gamey tasting. Cilantro haters beware - Tang puts that s#%! on everything! 

The cumin lamb skewer was tasty. Gets busy and is a popular spot for a reason. The lamb leg was absolutely tender and delicious, spicy  too. The steamed pork buns were juicy and packed with flavour. All three dishes are winners. 

Nice owners too."}
{"text":"Great restaurant serving northern Chinese cuisine in Chinatown. I recommend any dish that involves the thick, housemade, hand-stretched noodles."}
{"text":"I was figuring out where to have my last meal when I stumbled upon New Tang Dynasty and found they specialize in northern Chinese food, specifically Xi'an cuisine. Yessssssss.

I can't think of any other places in Cowtown that do homemade, hand pulled noodles (RIP Auntie's Chinese Burger). 

The inside is typical Asian decor with a couple TV's (one playing an Asian drama, the other oddly had CNN on). Don't expect much with the service. One nice thing is that they accept credit cards!

The menu has all your typical northern Chinese dishes. Wish I was able to try more but it was just me.

- Cold steamed noodles ($5.99) - cold noodles were completely different than what I've had previously. Yes, that's a clump of peanut butter sauce plopped on top. I wasn't a big fan; the noodle texture had no satisfying \"bite\" to it if you know what I mean.
- Stretched noodles ($11.99) - the noodles were of the wide, flat variety but they were cut into squares; great chewy mouth feel and exactly what I wanted. Add some scoops of the spicy chili oil and you're golden. Delicious.

Solid spot in Chinatown to get your noodle fix in. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"My mom and I had just spent the last week traveling through Banff and Jasper, and had a few hours to kill before our flight back to New York. After eating nothing but burgers and fries for 6 days, I wanted comfort food and this place happened to be one of the few open at the time and looked clean enough inside, so we stopped in for a late lunch. The noodles hit the spot! The spicy and sour pork noodles did not disappoint - the noodles were hand pulled and the broth was a perfect combination of spicy and sour. My mom had a lamb noodle soup - these noodles were thicker but also hand pulled - and the broth was thick and savory. Both dishes were better and tasted more authentic than anything I've ever had in New York (I consider any dish with wood ear as an ingredient to be authentic). Service is what it is - staff was nice enough. It's a bit pricey for what I'd expect in Chinatown (not that I know enough about Calgary Chinatown to make any fair comparisons), but if I lived here, I'd definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"I'm guessing this new restaurant opened with the exact same English translation as the old restaurant, even though the Chinese name is not the same. I've never been to the old one but the new Tang Dynasty (?? is the new name now) serves cuisine from northwestern China, where wheat dishes are more common. I've only ever had noodles here, I'm not sure that they serve dim sum as previous reviews have stated. This place is very authentic, which is great if you want delicious Chinese food, but maybe not so good if you can't read Chinese. A lot of their menu is in Chinese only and I've noticed they've changed it a lot since they opened. This means that a good portion of their menu are hand written sheets with Chinese scrawled on and their specials are also only written in Chinese. I'm sure the lady would explain things to you if you asked but if you are too cowardly to ask don't despair! All the noodle dishes from the original menu remain and they have English translations. 

They have two different styles of noodles: a thinner uniform pulled noodle (called ??) and a fat cut up noodle of more varying thickness (called ???). I am partial to the thick cut up variety but the other one is equally delicious. The noodles either come in a broth (??) or dry with various toppings/oil.

Some good options if you're feeling adventurous with spice include: spicy sour pork noodles (hand pulled noodles in a spicy and sour broth with minced meat and veggies) and oil-splashed noodles (hand cut noodles in spicy chili oil).

Not spicy options I've heard are good: Lan Zhou beef noodles (hand pulled noodles in beef broth) and egg+tomato (hand cut noodles with sweet/savoury fried eggs and tomatoes).

I have also heard the pork burger is super good and it's definitely one of their most popular dishes.  

They accept credit card, which is a rarity in Chinatown, do you have no reason not to give try it out!"}
{"text":"Everything you ask for this place has it: delicious authentic food, fast service, friendly staff. Leaving satisfied and happy."}
{"text":"My husband loved loved loved the Lan Zhou beef noodle soup. Loved the flavor of the broth, the cilantro, the hearty wheat noodles. My spicy and sour pork noodles with vegetables was life-changing tbh. Hot and sour is my favorite flavor combo and it was a very complex broth underneath that lovely chili oil. The cumin lamb skewers are also just like you'd get at a street vendor, and that's a compliment. Really really good food and reasonable prices. Huge portions! One of our favorite meals during our whole Alberta trip."}
{"text":"Have to have the sour and sweet pork noodle soup. The hand-pulled noodles with lamb is amazing. I saw some caucasians order a Chinese fried rice to go and I laughed at them-ignorance."}
