{"text":"I am consistently surprised by how rapidly the towns of Aurora and Newmarket are changing from their former sleepy bedroom communities into vibrant and flourishing areas for unique restaurants and businesses.   Only about 3 weeks old at the time of this review, Casa Carbone is one of the latest editions to Auroras Bayview Avenue corridor (north of Wellington but south of St. John's Side-road) and it doesn't disappoint.   Bringing a mix of classic and northern Italian dishes together in a trendy yet casual dining environment suitable for urban centres, it is rapidly becoming \"that (not so) little Italian spot\" every community needs.   Upon entering you're immediately greeted with a small bar, 20+ foot ceilings, a giant mural of a bull, fire engine read metal seats and a giant frame set around the kitchen - seemingly putting the focus on the kitchen as a sort of show. And judging by the food that kitchen is producing it's a show you'll watch in anticipation while you await your meal.   This is Italian gourmet with a northern italian twist, so be advised that less/non-traditional ingredients like pepperoni have no place on the menu. One example of a non-traditional menu item for a typical Italian restaurant was their spaztle pasta which one might normally find at a German restaurant but due to the proximity to the German boarder that the head chef is originally from it's easy to understand the influence. The menu is easy to peruse with a smart number of appetizer, pasta, pizza and mains to choose from without making your decision too difficult.   Being my first visit and that there were no yelp reviews to base my choices on, I relied on my server to guide me to the menu items already becoming popular and that they were most proud of.   I went with their Octopus appetizer and the venison (deer meat) spaghetti bolognese.   I was told that everything, including their pasta is made fresh and in house. Additionally, the import all their seafood (and they'll be adding more shortly) weekly from the coast of Spain.   The octopus was the first to come out and right away it was visually impressive. Bright purple grilled tentacles served atop cooked cherry tomatoes and field greens topped with edible flowers on an equally vibrant plate. Fresh, is the only word I would use to describe this dish. The flavours of each part were as bright as they were visually pleasing. With the all star being the octopus. Never in my life (save for a seaside lunch in Santorini, Greece) have I had a more perfectly seasoned and cooked octopus dish. A hearty portion that has been marinated and cooked to perfection so that the texture doesn't have the slightest rubbery texture one might expect. Instead it almost resembled the mouth feel one might expect from a plump Italian sausage. Soft and moist and very juicy. Amazing.   Next to come out was the Venison bolognese made with fresh spaghetti. Now, when I mentioned less traditional ingredients and methods this dish speaks to that perfectly. First off, venison is almost never seen in Toronto/GTA italian cuisine with the most adventurous places using ground lamb or wild boar. The aversion stems from venison typically being branded as game-y and I share that aversion. However, much like the octopus the method by which the venison was prepared removed any hint of game you would be concerned with. Additionally, unlike traditional bolognese which are heavy on the sauce, their version is extremely light on the sauce, almost as if lightly brushed for colour and flavour, while allowing the medley of other ingredients stand out and share the stage.   Have you seen the Disney movie Ratatouille? If so you'll recall that scene where Anton Ego takes a first bite of the simple peasant dish and is immediately transported to his childhood. Growing up in a more northern italian family, There were certain cooking methods and flavours (specifically the use of carrots in tomato sauces) which were very unique and not very popular in most italian restaurants. Even our cooking styles changed and evolved over the years so these original methods faded from use. My first bite of their spaghetti dish hit me like an electric shock and immediately brought me back 25 years to how my mother once cooked her spaghetti and meat sauce. Light on sauce, heavy on the ground meat, and with traces of carrots throughout. It was uncanny and amazing and not unlike Anton Ego damn bear brought a nostalgic tear to my eye (no bullshit I swear).   After 6+ years on Yelp, I've toned down my more verbose reviews, so you reading this can be reassured that if I'm going into the detail that I am here that a trip to visit Casa Carbone in Aurora will be worth your uber/Lyft/cab ride (because you'll want to have wine ... obviously).   I look forward to returning - hungry.   Eatcrest Out."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been discussing to come for the longest time but we never had a chance to. So on a random night I was like, let's go check this place out. As we strolled into the restaurant, I felt a sense of ease. The interior was very homey and made me feel like I was home. Soft wooden accents on painted red walls and chairs. Everything was tastefully put together and complimented each other. As a first time goer, I didn't know what to expect so we decided to just order a few dishes. Honestly I can say the food was awesome and it tasted just right. The pizza was perfectly cooked, though slightly blacked on the crust (I assume it was the oven as I could rub off the black parts). The octopus was also a blast - there was so much flavour to it my tongue was having a party. It was cooked to perfection in my opinion as it was perfectly tender and chewy at the same time. We also ordered a pasta that was... Bomb. I don't remember the name of it now, but it was really delicious and I can taste it as I'm writing this now zomg. Before I finish this off, I just wanted to tell you.. The owner said, \"don't hesitate to use your hands.\" There I sat thinking wtf was just preached to me? I can use my hands eating here?! His response was, \"whenever we have bread, we always use our hands.. It's an Italian tradition, so don't hesitate to use your hands.\" I acknowledged and smile and devoured.. Lol Before I really finish this off, I have to say that you may require a snack after you finish as portions weren't very large. I'm totally ok with this bc I was here for the experience.. And I liked it!  This place has a solid 4.5 stars for exceptional service and awesome dishes! There 0.5 came off the portion sizes as I left the restaurant still a little hungry but that's just me..   Finally, before I really really finish this off...   Just kidding lolll"}
{"text":"I love when independent restaurants with nice ambience and amazing food join the Newmarket/Aurora scene. You can tell they are eager to please which I appreciated - the owner came over multiple times to make sure we were enjoying everything. He spent 10 years living in Italy with his grandfather and learning how to do everything in the authentic Italian way. The waiter was also Italian and took great care of us. We ordered from the specials - a manicotti dish and a seafood stew and both were excellent. The house baked bread was fantastic and just the perfect size so that you can try some without filling up before your meal comes. Luckily we saved room for dessert - the white chocolate dish was amazing as was the orange slices soaked in liquor (not something I would normally order but decided to give it a go at the suggestion of the waiter - no regrets). We look forward to returning many times and trying more of their delicious menu!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch about two weeks ago and had a wonderful experience. I had the sea scallops serves on purple potatoes. They were perfectly cooked and looked great on the plate. I met the owner who is a very nice guy. I am excited this place has opened and can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here twice now.  Each time the service was great and food was delicious!  The specials are great and there are a lot of options on their menu.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Casa Carbone is nestled in the heart of Aurora. The restaurant has a warm and inviting feel. Staff are knowledgeable, friendly and professional. The menu has a good variety to choose from. We were in the mood for a plate of authentic pasta. My husband loves gnocchi. It's a given when we go Italian. This time was no different, he was drawn to the gnocchi here as they were made with cornmeal, which gave an added twist. Cornmeal in Italian cuisine is used to make Polenta. I ordered The tagliatelle in a lamb sauce, which I really enjoyed. The portion was smaller then I'm use to for a main course. When the gnocchi came my husband was so disappointed. They did not look like gnocchi but two pieces of polenta with a little tomato sauce. He asked for extra sauce, but when it arrived he found it to be acidic and not cooked long enough. He was not impressed. Again portion was small. We ordered muscles in a white wine sauce to start but they were bland. We didn't want to complain as the staff were so nice. Our waiter offered us a sample taste of a pink Proseccoo which was very nice. I would give the restaurant a second chance as there were other items on the menu I would like to try."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  New authentic Italian restaurant opened down the street from where I live! After reading up on reviews and drooling over the photos posted on Yelp, I have decided to pay a visit with my date one evening.  The service was very welcoming and attentive. Our server was experienced and our meal went very smoothly. We started with a bottle of red wine with some assorted housemade bread. The breads were quite dense, so don't just fill up on bread because the best has yet to come: FRESHLY HOUSEMADE PASTA.  I ordered the Venison Spaghetti, and my date ordered their daily special, Seafood Spaghetti in tomato wine sauce. The pasta itself was made to perfection - it was light, and cooked al dente (firm and chewy) just the way I like it. The Seafood pasta was definitely the highlight of my night - it tasted heavenly with the delicious sauce and lots of seafood - I literally ate half of my date's dinner lol. My Venison meat had a very gamey taste - certainly not something everyone can handle, but I thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  We also shared the Coffee panna cotta and the Tiramisu. Both were delicious, and absolutely perfect for coffee lovers. The only thing was that the inside of the panna cotta felt a bit frozen; it had the crunchy ice crystals inside.  Another thing that I was not exactly pleased was the dish presentation of a couple dishes. If you compare my photos to the ones our CM Kris U. took, you would be able to spot the difference for the Venison Spaghetti and the Octopus appetizer.  Nonetheless, I would come back to try more items! I really enjoy Italian food, and I especially love pasta. There is still plenty of room to grow and make improvements - I understand that they are still new. Keep up the good work, Casa Carbone! #supportlocalbusiness"}
{"text":"Just like home.  Vince and his staff are awesome.  Sergio was the best waiter.  Food was awesome. Love this place."}
{"text":"Honestly , the food is incredible. Modern design . Caring service. I had a bit of a problem with the menu, because what I wanted wasn't there or the dish is sold - out (shrimps , seafood pasta, only one kind of fish ), so I ended up eating delicious lamb. $50 for the main for me is very expensive, but every bite was worth $. Definitely a must  for a gourmet lovers!"}
{"text":"Their menu recently changed. Meal tasted great but portions are super tiny and expensive. The octopus is no longer available as a appetizer. Instead it's a main course $45 for 1 tentacle. It was tender and smokey.  The gnocchi, probably my favourite was pillowy soft and delicious but only came with 14 pieces lined up with 2 jumbo shrimp. The margarita pizza was really nice, lightly charred and woodsy. The crust had a nice light crispy on the outside and a nice slight chew inside. Overall a fantastic meal but way too expensive and not filling."}
