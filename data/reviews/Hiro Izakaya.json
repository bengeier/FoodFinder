{"text":"This is by far, the worst restaurant I've ever been to. I don't know how dare them call themself an Izakaya. The salmon sushi we ordered have fish scale on it, and the waitress blamed it on the distrubutor \"they didnt clean it peoperly\". Wow, what kind of Japanese restaurant doesn't clean their fish? The Gyo Don was cold in the middle, Tamago was microwaved, hot on the side and cold in the middle..... Sushi rice wasn't even seasoned... Basically you are paying an Izakaya price and getting food worse than all you can eat... Wow, I wonder how long you guys can survive."}

{"text":"This restaurant is pretty new and I'm glad we gave it a try. We had the oysters, takowasa, chicken karaage, takoyaki, salmon sushi, and uni. All of which were quite good, and not overpriced either. The takowasa packed a lot of flavor especially. The waitress was really nice too. We went towards the end of their lunch service and they didn't mind at all. This restaurant is a great new addition to the neighborhood and I would go back again."}
