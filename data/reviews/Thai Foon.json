{"text":"I love Thai food. Havent had it since college and I have missed it terribly. I will definitely be coming back here. I came here for lunch and the place wasn't busy at all. The waitress was super friendly and refilled our drinks multiple times. And the food was wonderful. I ordered the Yellow Curry with chicken, and after the first bite, I was in love with it. Yum."}
{"text":"I understand the prices are low and there is a \"pay for what you get\" mentality. It is in a conventent location, and cheap...However, next time I am going somewhere that actually serves good food and offers a friendly service. I had to ask for chopsticks after my food came. You will absolutely not find authentic cuisine here or anything close to it. I will not be returning and recommend you go somewhere else, too."}
{"text":"Called and asked where I could find a menu online to place a take out order. Was told UrbanSpoon and facebook. Only urbanspoon had a menu and I asked saying it was from 2011 and was told that was right.  When I later called to place the order, the price was $14 more than what the menu on urbanspoon had. I hung up and redid the math and called again.  I was told if I was unhappy with their prices I could go elsewhere, no apology for an employee telling me to find an inaccurate menu online.  I was pretty surprised by the rude customer service."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. No matter how long the wait is at other places, do not break down and eat here! Party of 8 took an hour to get food, and 2 entrees were left out. After waiting 40 more min for the missing entrees, waitress offered to bring one as carry out... And then brought the wrong one. Yeah, we missed our movie, but I'll be burping up bad pad thai for at least a few more hours."}
{"text":"I had the non spicey pad thai and it was good but was somewhat lacking in taste.  I will have to try the spicy version next time.  Service was good and prompt.  I look forward to the next visit."}
{"text":"Always good food and hardly ever a wait. Service is \"deliberate\"... Nice place for a date or quick night out."}
{"text":"With Thai food being a cuisine of choice for me, I've tried numerous Thai food dishes at many restaurants. I have never had a more inauthentic experience as much as I did at Thai Foon. The Chicken Satay was fried in a strange batter and the peanut dipping sauce had a funky taste and consisted of pools of fatty oil. The Pad Thai tasted nothing like Pad Thai, dishes that were meant to be spicy with garlic tasted like sweet and sour from a Chinese restaurant. The decor and ambiance resembled that of an elementary school cafeteria. I would never go to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"The bubble tea is what brings me here often, and I always forget to check in on here when I just order the teas! I get the Green Tea Taro Milk bubble tea.  Food prices are a little high so I haven't tried that many dishes. The Honey Coated Walnut (a sweet dish) is probably my favorite. General Tso Chicken is also very good and the spicy basil was not something I would order again. The coconut and fried rice are very good with your dish but an upcharge.  I would say it's worth checking out, especially for the bubble tea ;)"}
{"text":"we tried the chicken pad thai and spicy basil noodles..not very good..doesn't taste as good as the chicken pad thai from Papaya and spicy basil noodles from Little Bangkok...the dishes at Thai Foon tasted 'americanized'.."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Great pad thai and spicy basil noodles. Waiter was very attentive, restaurant was extremely clean. Would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"The Thai noodle curry soup was far too skimpy on the vegetables (and who thought grape tomatoes in a hot soup was a good idea?), but the flavor of the soup itself was amazing!"}
{"text":"Guise. 

About Thai Foon not being an authentic, traditional Thai fine-dining restaurant.

IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE!

You only make yourself look ridiculous -- rather than \"in the know\" or \"like a sophisticated foodie\" -- if you complain about how some dish at Thai Foon is not made the authentic Thai way. Seriously.  

Dude. It's a place in a strip mall. Called THAI FOON. Painted orange inside. With no Thai people eating or working there. With a glossy menu and stuff like crab rangoons. Dude. How can you come here and expect traditional Thai fine dining? Are you the guy who calls the Top 40 station and requests Sigur Ros? Dude. No. 

It's Thai-inspired. And it's damn good. The noodle dishes are a bit like fried spaghetti. The soups are like Campbell with a kick. Nothing bland here, and if you just close your eyes and imagine we are now eating the cuisine of a country called Thaifoonia, you'll love it too. I promise.

Prices are reasonable. Service is typical for high school kids who have no financial stake in the business. Decor is like McDonalds turned up a notch.

Bask in it."}
{"text":"Great Dollar Menu at Thai Foon - A slice of lime and three strands of Cilantro - More important is the Owner's Attitude towards the Wait Staff.

I used to be a huge fan of Thai Foon until this incident occurred a few weeks ago.  I have ordered the Indonesian Fried Rice for years and it used to come with a lime and cilantro.  Then a few months ago, it did not come with it, so I asked the waitress and she said that some people don't like it so they stopped adding it automatically.  During the next four or five visits, I made sure to ask for the lime and cilantro and they obliged graciously.  

This time around, I noticed that they had added $2 for lime and cilantro for 2 orders of Indonesian Fried Rice.   When I asked the waitress, she said that she was just following orders and that she needed her job.  So I asked to speak to the Owner, who flat out told me that they have been charging for lime and cilantro for years.  When I said that was not what I had experienced, he asked me to point to the waitress who had been giving me free lime and cilantro and said, \"Show me the waitress and I will take it out of her paycheck.\". 

While I did not care about the charges at this point, I was dismayed with his attitude towards the very people who make his business work.  While I still love the Indonesian Fried Rice and don't mind the extra charge, I don't feel good about supporting such a businessman."}
{"text":"Good selection of dishes. I just wish there had Thai ice coffee. Great place to catch dinner and a movie. Noodle dishes are basically the typical expected."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here the other night and it was pretty good.  Aside from fish I don't eat animals, and I love how you can choose your meat, shrimp or tofu option for many of their dishes.  We split an order of the yellow curry (tofu) and General Tso's Tofu.  The yellow curry is a sweet coconut curry (I've had the red curry before and it is equally as sweet) and it's pretty good.  My husband polished off the General Tso's and practically licked the bowl clean.  

Our waitress was prompt and attentive.  Our food arrived quickly, but that was not surprising as we were the only diners.  The dining room has slick, modern décor.  There is a window which enables you to see and hear the cooks who were speaking Spanish.  Latino cooks in a Thai restaurant? Talk about diversity!  Ok, so it's definitely not the most authentic Thai food you will find in Pittsburgh, but it works in a pinch on a weeknight when you live on the other side of town from Nicky's Thai Kitchen.

It's BYOB, so you can pop over to the Winery at Wilcox next door and grab a bottle of wine to take with you."}
{"text":"Good food, no complaints, atmosphere isn't the greatest, not bad but doesn't encourage one to hang around after the meal is over. Their Pad Thai is a personal favorite."}
{"text":"Just arrived in Moon Township and came across this place while leisurely touring the area. First of all, as a meteorologist, I've gotta say this is the best named restaurant EVER!! I had to stop! I ordered the Pad See You (more commonly spelled Ew), which is a wide noodle, with bean sprouts, broccoli, scallions with your choice of meat. I ordered it with beef. Also ordered some jasmine rice. Although my bill set me back $12 (a bit pricey, especially nearly $3 for white rice), the order was large and delicious with a kick of spice. The rice was perfectly sticky. Service was excellent as my waiter came over at least a half dozen times. Will definitely come back, but given it was a Saturday I think the pricing needs to be a bit more competitive compared to all the other restaurants in the Giant Eagle district (about $1-$2 too high for most items). For those of you with dates, they have two \"date booths\" which look like futuristic Jetson-esque rooms built into the corners of the dining area. GREAT idea. They also have a large selection of Boba Tea and several Chinese options as well."}
{"text":"A small quirky almost Thai eatery. The reason why I say almost is because they have Chinese, Korean and Vietnamese items on their menu. Their food is not consistent, but when its good - it's really good. Funny thing - I haven't actually liked their Thai food. The best thing they have on the menu is their version of a Korean specialty, Jap-chae. They call it Jap-chap - I have no idea why. Its sweet potato (glass noodles) with eggs, veggies and your choice of meat. It's miles apart from real Jap-chae but it's got unique flavor of it's own. The soft glass noodles paired with crisp vegetables and egg are infused with a smoky well spiced garlic and soy based sauce. Any meat including tofu goes great with the dish.

Another item that scores high on \"yumm\" factor is their coconut rice.  Steven got the red curry and the coconut rice was a fabulous complement to it. 

This is definitely not the best Thai place in town but its got some goodies if your taste buds like exploring. Just don't expect fine dining! :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Thai food and eat it whenever we get the chance, so we were excited to try this little locally owned joint out in Robinson by the Market District.  The excitement soon faded. 

PROS
Quickly greeted and seated by the host.
Cost
The sauce that comes with the Thai Spring Rolls
Tofu is available for some entrees (although the menu doesn't say it)

CONS
-Parking lot is swamped @ 6PM on a Saturday night (not Thai foon's fault but still irritating and good to know ahead of time you may have to stalk for a parking space)

-Waitress never brought us water.

-Ordered \"hot tea.\" The first was a cup with a Lipton Black tea bag. The refill was a full pot of green tea.  

-The Thai Spring Rolls were flavorless. 

-The \"extra-spicy\" Pad Thai and Thai Curry Noodles were mild at best.

-The abundant red and green peppers in the pad thai (this is of course to the personal likes or dislikes of the consumer but as purists, non-traditional vegetables are irritating)

-We waited so long for the server to check in on us and refill the soda that my husband went to the drink fountain and served himself while two employees walked by him. Both looked at him but neither said anything to him.  

-The thai ice tea, while not ordered, comes pre-mixed with no clear line between the condensed milk and the thai tea. It was also an odd orange color unlike I've seen before. It just looked bad.

-The only time we got quick service was when payment was due. We were not asked if we wanted desert.


In conclusion, if you like Americanized-Asian food, this will do, but it isn't anything special worth going out of your way to try."}
{"text":"Really tasty thai food. We had to wait for 10-15 minutes to get the table. The place was bit cold , so I got to go out to my car to get a blanket for my kid. This is the only troublesome my visit.

The service was fine and the food came piping hot. All the items were delicious and rich in flavors. we had panang curry with chicken ,some other with shrimp, curry fried rice, fried Tofu.
All of them are good.I never saw a cucumber in thai style curry taste so good. We could finish half of them and enjoyed the left over the next day, still delicious."}
{"text":"This thai place is the best i had so far for thai food , their satay chicken and beef is a special starter with chicken or beef on the stick , lots of people enjoyed crab Rangoon there , pho is always good, Panang curry and massaman curry are my favorite two curries ,you could always add extra potato or string bean in it for $1 , or just simply switch the veggies in the curry to match your fav, Pad Thai is one of famous too, also I think mogonlian chicken is better than general chicken . I know lots of people like their Indonesian fried rice too :) you will love this place"}
{"text":"I love the shrimp jap chap. it is BYO so you can stop at Wilcox Winery next store and enjoy wine with your meal. The ambiance could be a little better but the food is yummy!"}
{"text":"When this place first opened, I really enjoyed it.

Visiting for the first time in a few years, I ordered my preferred curry: green, Thai hot. What came out was flavorful, good heat, etc, but it wasn't what I'd recognize as green curry. The sauce was brown and extremely sweet. I thought they honey-glazed my tofu! Overall it was tasty, it just wasn't what I expected when I ordered green curry."}
{"text":"This is quickly becoming a favorite restaurant of mine.  The food is delicious, the prices are great, and it ends up being a crowd pleaser in my family especially when there is quite a bit of indecision on what to eat.  

I've been here a few times and here's what I've had so far:

- Thai Toast - pretty good shrimp toast with a little more spicy kick than you would normally get at a Chinese restaurant.
- Thai Dumplings - OK considering they're probably frozen.
- Roast Duck Noodle Soup - rich broth that isn't as salty as I've had in other places - a great dish.
- Pad Thai - I've ordered it with chicken and tofu. There's a slight upcharge for the chicken and tofu. But, it's worth it! Chicken is very tender and flavorful. The tofu is firm and holds up even in leftovers the next day. I order it spicy and ask for Thai Peppers on the side for some additional kick."}
{"text":"Average at best. This is Thai fast food. Ordered Spicy Basil Rice noodles. The rice noodles were overlooked and there was not a lot of taste to the dish itself. The dish itself is titled \"spicy basil\" but it wasn't spicy at all. I expected the dish to be at least a little bit spicy. 

If you are hungry the place will at least satisfy your hunger since the portions are big."}
{"text":"My first visit was yesterday. Started with Tom Yum soup, which was excellent. Very spicy, but a little sweetness would have made it better. The Shrimp Pad Thai was very good. One reviewed said it tasted vinegary. It did not. Pad Thai sauce is made with tamarind, which is sour. The other dish was Massaman curry. Massaman is called the king of curries for a good reason. It is delicious. This restaurant's version is very good, full of tender beef and potatoes. I will be back often."}
{"text":"It's a shame that there is no other Thai option in Robinson. So by default we have ordered here way too often. Really need to stop. The food is really inconsistent. Sometimes it's really good. But most times it is mediocre. And by most times, I mean all but maybe twice. It really isn't good Thai food, at all. It's worth it to drive the extra 10-15 or so minutes and get real Thai in the city."}
{"text":"The food here is all delicious and fresh tasting. The flavors are authentic and the wait-staff is very friendly.

My only complain is the decor, although clean and simple, is kind of, well, boring. There is not much to look at, but the amazing food will keep me coming back! The curries are A+!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here four or five times now and I have to say, Thai Foon is actually a pretty neat little place. I enjoy the atmosphere, the people, and the prices. The food is good, it's not fantastic, but it's certainly above the average Asian restaurant. I usually get their noodles, they're pretty good, and the rice isn't bad either. Sadly nothing makes them truly exceptional. All in all, Thai Foon is good but nothing worth going out of the way for."}
{"text":"Really enjoy the red curry and pad thai. Bubble tea is really good here too. The staff is always friendly and accommodating to people (I've watched for this). The coconut rice is delicious! There are only 2 private seating areas. The other seating is mediocre at best, but the food is great"}
{"text":"First time here and it was very good. Large portions and great flavor. The service was tops as well, the young lady that waited on my wife and I could not have been nicer. There was problem with the computer so it took a min to get cashed out but things can happen anywhere. I will be back and will tell my friends about this place. BTW if your military they do give a discount, another +"}
{"text":"Love love their green curry. It would be nicer if the server serve the customer instead of texting on their phone and ignore us."}
{"text":"I love Thai Foon!  This place is a weekly lunch trip for me and my colleagues.  The lunch specials are inexpensive and I feel like the service sizes are bigger than that at other comparable thai restaurants.  While the Pho didn't knock my socks off, the curries are some of the most enjoyable I've had.

The restaurant can be little noisy when they are busy, and is more of a casual atmosphere.  No candle-lit dinners going on here.  You'll have to goto Bangkok Balcony for that.

Still, a solid place to go for some quick & affordable thai.  4 stars here."}
{"text":"A bit disappointing. The food was bland, not much to go on with....We ordered a couple of appetizers and entrées.  The restaurant is set up like a cafeteria with a couple of separated enclosed booths."}
{"text":"Visited today and was very disappointed. Service was extremely slow and the wait staff were very bad. One person in my party ordered a meal without onion. Food arrived and it was made with onion. Waitress asked him if he could pick them out. My food was overly spicy and salty. Heat and salt were the only flavors. Never going back"}
{"text":"Okay, very rarely give someone this bad of a review but when I do it is usually for bad service on top of mediocre to bad food. Their food is okay at best, not very authentic and not that tasty. 

The reason for the bad review is the poor service. I drove about 15 minutes to pick up takeout from this place. Got my take-out and drove 15 minutes back. Opened the food and realized that they screwed up the order big time. So I called and let them know and after being very confused about what to do got the manager on the phone who helped us out correctly. But not after trying to get me to drive back there again to pick up the correct order. But they said stop back and they will give us a gift card to compensate. However, when we returned the next day for the gift card they knew nothing of the sort. The owner was there and argued tooth and nail with us over the gift card, even called the manager who promised it at home to confirm. Then tried to give us a $10 gift card for a $30 dollar meal that they screwed up. Instead they end up giving us half of the cash in return.

I can't see why any business wouldn't want to keep a customer happy. I had gotten takeout from there several times because it was the closest Thai place to my house. I would rather travel to Thailand for takeout now rather than give this business my money. They lost me for good..."}
{"text":"Came at the height of lunch hour, without a reservation, but we still got a great seat. In one of the pods. We started with 3 orders of perfectly cooked and perfectly salted edamame. We then got 4 dishes for 5 people: the Pad Thai noodles, Indonesian fried rice, triple delight, and spicy basil chicken (dinner portion as recommended by our waiter). Two of the dishes came with rice and we chose brown rice.  I liked everything. The flavored of the Pad Thai noodles (slightly sweet) complimented the Indonesian rice (slightly salty). I liked the brown sauce with the triple delight which is a good dish for a crowd since it contains a lot of different things. The spicy dish was mildly spicy;. Both the triple Delight and the spicy basil chicken had broccoli and I liked how crunchy it was as well as the bite size pieces..
Service was attentive and he offered suggestions. Drinks were constantly refilled. We were offered chop sticks. 
I would come back here again."}
{"text":"I must order take out once a week. .I am addicted to the chicken pad thai!!  Some restaurants do not incorporate cilantro in the dish but so glad Thai foon does because I sure am a fan!  I usually get a spicy 4 which is so good. At the end of the dish - its so good and loving it .. oh us spicy food lovers - love the burn.  This dish is superb every single time. I cant get enough!  One of these days I will try another dish. We visited the restaurant and was so excited the circle cove booth seats were open!!  Its a fun dining experience .. quaint and private.  There are only two of them and you cant reserve them so it was fun!"}
{"text":"The food here is always good and comes to you hot. One of my favorite places in robinson."}
{"text":"The chicken wasn't cooked thoroughly. I had tummy pain followed by diarrhea. The flavors were good though."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go to lunch during work in the Robinson area. They have a pretty big menu selection of noodles, rice dishes, appetizers, etc. Some of them are more thai inspired items, but you definitely see your Chinese takeout variation of dishes as well. 

I have had their curry and found it to be less than stellar with carrots, peppers, and russet potatoes. I prefer sweet potatoes of sorts. I must admit their noodle dishes are pretty good though. I always go with pad Thai when I go to new Thai restaurants and thought it was pretty good. They give you a healthy portion of food for the price - so I think it's a good value for under $10. 

They have good service and are quick with getting people in and out. A lot of people come here for their lunch breaks because of it's central location in the Settlers Ridge plaza, so if you want to beat the lunch crowd try to get in before 12 or expect to wait a good 10-15 for a table."}
{"text":"This is a regular lunch spot when I'm in Pittsburgh.  The food is very good and the service is above average.  This is clearly targeting to the lunch crowd which is great for me, but I can see for dinner the setting may be too casual for some. Overall a great restaurant.  Red Curry YES!"}
{"text":"I love Thai Foon. I grab lunch here 1-2 times a month. I always get the spicy basil noodle. It's quite delicious. 
For the most part the service is great. On occasion it can be a bit slow depending on who the server of the day is. But I can almost always get in and out, and back to work in a lunch hour. Even on a Friday.
I've never ate there with someone who didn't enjoy what they ordered. Food seems fresh and I keep going back for more. 
I tried a few Thai places in San Francisco, and this place of course is Americanized. You're in Pittsburgh, what do you expect? It is worth a visit!"}
{"text":"The food was awesome the service was great and cute lil cubby hole inside. The only thing is the decor needs a lil updating on the inside. A lil paint goes a long way."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good for what it is: strip mall Thai food. I've been here a few times and sampled their Thai salad in addition to their pad Thai. The Thai Salad is bland and like something you could get from Panera, the pieces of chow mein noodles made it taste inauthentic to me. I've had authentic Thai salads many times before, and the balance of sour-spicy-sweet is just not present in this salad.
However, the pad Thai is a good gauge for a Thai restaurant, and the pad Thai here was pretty good and the spice level was definitely on point. Unlike some places, Thai Foon will bring the heat if you ask for it, and for that they get 4 stars."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a quick lunch here with my daughter on a cold, rainy Friday afternoon. Got the Thai dumplings and a bowl of Pho. Came to $17.60. Dumplings were steamed and very good. Six per order. The Pho with chicken was good, though I needed a little soy sauce in the broth. Even with my very little experience with Pho, I thought that a big component to Pho was adding different side items to change the taste, but no side items such as hot sauce, soy sauce or chili's were on the table. It was still good none the less."}
{"text":"We were traveling through Pittsburgh and were in the mood for Thai food, and after a search by Siri, we ended up here. 
The place is decent enough, just don't expect the food to be authentic otherwise you will  be disappointed. 

Our meal started out great with TOM KHA (with tofu). My hope was high because this soup tasted authentic to me.  

Our next dish, the BEEF SALAD, while was good (it's hard to mess up a basic salad) it was very confusing in taste: it didn't have an identity, a problem partly because of the choice of dressings offered. I guess I was expected a salad accented with Thai flavor and didn't get that. 

Next, we tried the SPICY SQUID, because I love spicy food. While it was spicy, loaded with jalapeños peppers, it was more of a Chinese dish than Thai, and for $15 I would have liked more than 8 pieces of squid. The rest of the dish was filled with green peppers, onions and jalapeño. The brown rice that came with this was undercooked and not edible. We had to switch it out for steamed white rice. 

Our server was decent as was the service."}
{"text":"pretty good Thai food for a high $ plaza like Settlers Ridge.  Soups are fantastic"}
{"text":"Thai toast and dumplings excellent 
Pad Thai
Green Curry also very good
Service excellent"}
{"text":"Disappointing. One of the worst) or strangest) interpretations of Drunken Noodles that I've ever tried. Tasted like they used a bottle of store bought sweet and sour sauce. They also used the thin pad Thai noodles instead of the thicker rice noodles that are typically used in this dish. Thee at quality was good, however. 
On the up side, it is a BYOB restaurant with a wine store next door.  The service and decor were also above average."}
{"text":"I really contemplated writing a new review for Thai Foon after my most recent visit. I have somewhat of a bias for Asian restaurants because I'm Asian myself and I want to see them succeed. But my most recent visit turned me off so much that I felt I had to let people know. 

So the food just didn't taste right. Spring rolls were ok. The Tom Kha soup was a disaster; it was coconut milk with a layer of chili oil on top. There wasn't anything in it except a few pieces of over cooked mushroom and onions. The Pad See Yew had no flavor whatsoever, which it should at least have a soy sauce taste. The Pad Thai had a burnt flavor but it didn't taste natural. My husband compared it to eating burnt plastic. 

Thai Foon never was my favorite Thai restaurant but after this disappointing visit, I can't bring myself to ever come back."}
{"text":"Situated at the very end of the sprawling Settlers Ridge shopping/dining complex, this is a decent option for Thai fare. The service is always fast and friendly even during the lunch rush. No bar but they are BYOB friendly. I'm a curry guy and usually get the Massaman with extra veggies and coconut rice. I like it a lot. GrapeWife has tried several dishes and liked them all. The high ceiling in the dining room creates a spacious yet comfortable atmosphere. The round enclosed booth offers some privacy I you're into that. Give them a try. I think you'll be pleased."}
{"text":"Drunken noodles is my favorite dish and this place completely disappointed me. The food was decent and the portions are more than reasonable, but I would say this is more of a fast food Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"My mom and I ordered 3 dishes to share and everything we got was delicious. We ordered the pad this with chicken and tofu the curly fries rice with chicken and shrimp and the honey walnut with chicken. My daughter got the lo mein with chicken and enjoyed it. I was also happy to see they have a changing table in the bathroom( an actual wooden one) great place will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Thai food bordering on Chinese take out than authentic Thai. One of the few options west of the city, the Pad Thai is above average. Upping the quality of spice and meats may take this to the next level. But adequate for take out."}
{"text":"Industrial decor trying to pull off Thai just looks awkward.

The food was ok.  I was going to spend more time on this review, but honestly it was so \"blah\" of an experience that the first sentence capped the entire time had."}
{"text":"Mom's night out! My sister-in-law and I stopped here for dinner after watching Pitch Perfect 3. I've only had Thai food twice in the past, and have been wanting to try this place. My SIL is not a big fan of Thai, but this place has a nice \"Asian Mix\" of things to choose from. I got the Chicken Pad Thai, and thought it was delicious. She got the Stir Fry Udon, and felt the same. We shared an order of Thai Toast, and both thought it was delicious. The portions were generous and the food was delicious. I agree with some of the other reviewers that this is \"fast food\" Thai, but I have zero complaints about the food or service!"}
{"text":"As a frequent visitor to PA I love it when I stay closer to the PIttsburgh as the dining choices are much better than some of the small towns. Recently I was staying in the Robinson township area - close to the airport and discovered Thai Foon. The shopping area in which Thai Foon is located, is very new with several restaurants, a movie theater and shopping. It was a nice surprise directly across from my hotel (Hampden Inn). I am not a huge fan of chain restaurants so am always on the lookout for something original. Thai Foon fit the bill on this trip. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai and it had very good flavor and was quite spicy, which I like. The chicken was tender and everything was fresh and delivered to my table hot. I also enjoyed the Thai Iced Tea. It wasn't as sickeningly sweet as some other version of Thai Iced Tea - it was still plenty sweet, but didn't taste like dessert. All in all, I really liked the variety of items on the menu and the choices that I made. I will definitely return on my next trip to PA and try some of the other specialties."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the worst Thai restaurants I have ever been in this country. Whenever I travel and visit new cities, I visit a Thai restaurant (I crave Thai food more when I travel!). I was visiting a friend near Pittsburg and we were looking for a place to eat near the airport. This looked cute and clean from outside, so we decided to go in. The menu looked ok (although there were many non Thai  items such as triple delight, which is a Chinese item). The appetizers (Thai toast and spring rolls) were ok..but the spring rolls were more Chinese-y than Thai. The toast was better , but not the beautiful shrimp and pork paste on toasts that you get from a really good Thai restaurant. Then came out main dishes-Lemongrass stirfry with you and Chile stirfry with chicken. They were not Thai at all! They were both like gooey Chinese buffet dishes. Thai stir fry dishes are never gooey or starchy, or too sweet without much definition of flavors. I could taste a bit of lemongrass, but there was so much sweet and strangely flavored sauce on that I could not enjoy it at all. Broccoli was cooked well, and the the chile stirfry was a bit better (closer to what it's supposed to be) , but I just couldn't believe how bad it was. Usually Thai food does not fail like this. Maybe I should have known that it was a \"fusion\" place. Service was good, food was prompt, and it's clean.. hence the 2 stars, not one."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch! Hot is hot so beware. Basil dish w jalapeños spicy, but flavors blend so well, you leave w happy mouth! All employees bustin' ass, even mgr bussing tables. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place for awhile and finally was able to. Honestly, this place is not that great. It's like fast food Thai. I noticed that everyone around me got their food super quick, as did I, which isn't a bad thing but you can just tell everything is very pre-made. 

I got the Tom Kha soup and the spicy Basil noodle with beef. I really love Tom Kha soup and there is only one place that constantly blows me out of the water with it so it's hard to change my mind. This Tom Kha soup was okay. It has good flavor but not the best. Lots of onion, though, which is good and there was a good amount of tofu. 

The spicy basil was pretty spicy and they leave whole jalapeños in it. The beef was not that good, though. Unfortunately, this dish gave me a stomach ache. I've had a lot better Thai basil dishes. 

The service was fine, though. Nice people who work there. I most likely will never come back to this place, though. I know a lot of other better Thai places and one that don't have dishes that upset my stomach."}
{"text":"Thai Foon is the best! This place is only a few minutes away from my house and it is wonderful to go to for a quick & delicious Thai meal. I've ordered multiple meals from here. For apps, the fried dumplings and crab rangoon are so good. The entrees I have also ordered chicken pad Thai but my absolute favorite is the pho with beef. I just can't get enough of their pho! The service is always quick if you are dining in or taking out. A great spot to check out if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Nom Nom Nom!  Thai Foon is one of my favorite stops in Robinson and they never disappoint.  Flavors are really great - my favorite dish is the garlic chili with chicken.  IT has just the right amount of kick and sweetness and the chicken is super tender.  I've tried replicating the dish on my own, but I can't get it so I guess I'll have to keep coming back for more!  Best pad thai I've had also and the spice basil is really good if you're looking for a punch of heat.  Prices are reasonable, although they've increased since they first opened.  I'd rather take out than eat in as the seating arrangements are really odd - you're about 6 inches from the table next to you unless you're in one of the two private booths.  Overall, great eats and flavors.  It'll make any trip up to the cinemark theater a goodie!"}
{"text":"I've tried many menu dishes and I keep going back to my beloved vegan Pad Thai. I've tried many noodle dishes in and around the city (including Noodle Head) and Thai Foon is still my top dawg. 

I order Pad Thai, prepared vegan, no tofu with extra broccoli. Service is always good and the food is always delish. I've taken numerous people here and we all agree - it's so, so good. Also, if you don't feel up to dining in, the takeout is always spot on."}
{"text":"To be honest, I only ever get one main dish here and it's chicken pad Thai! I may not be the most experienced in the Thai food area, however out of several places I have had it, they hands down are tied for the best. It always comes out hot, fresh, and tasty!! 

Service here is usually quick as almost every time I have come it hasn't been too busy. For whatever reason they have amazing unsweetened iced tea. Kinda weird, but it is really good! 

I have tried their creation rangoons and they are OK. Nothing that special. My friend always gets the chicken and string beans that she says are extra delicious! Seems like we both always stick to the same dish!! 

I will keep coming here while I'm in the area, and probably will always get my pad Thai!"}
{"text":"Good service, very attentive.  I had a mango rice dish; while it wasn't bad there was very little mango in it.  And that mango was so tiny you could barely see it.  Could have had more of the sauce and a little more seasoning to it.  Husband had General Tso without the breading.  He said w/o the breading it's not as good and it was a little soupy."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now, and both times I have gotten the Spicy Basil with white rice and tofu. It was amazing both times. The service is quick, and the food is wonderful. Other people that I have been with have gotten the Pad Sew You and the House Fried Rice. Both dishes also looked great. As an appetizer, I have only tried the Spring Rolls, but they were equally good. I'm very disappointed that I hadn't tried this restaurant sooner for the number of times that I've been to Settlers Ridge, and I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"I didn't order any Thai food at Thai Foon.  I ordered the udon noodle thingamabob.  I can't remember the name.  Normally I give Asian fusion restaurants a hard time as I find the cooking not to be particularly creative, but Thai Foon did a great job.  Also, what a clever name.  Thai Foon.  Typhoon.  Get it?  I did.

It didn't take long for me to get my meal.  The ingredients tasted/seemed fresh, and the meal was extremely delicious.  I wanted to order a second one immediately after scarfing it down like the animal I am.  The udon noodles blew me away.  Like a typhoon.

The staff were friendly.  The decor/atmosphere could use some improvement, but in general, Thai Foon is awesome for what it is."}
{"text":"Mediocre Thai food. I'd honestly probably get it again, if I was REALLY craving Thai and was in the area... but I definitely would avoid it if I could. The Pad See Yew was pretty bad."}
{"text":"I had the summer rolls and lettuce chicken wrap. The rolls where a little smaller then i am used to but the peanut sauce was really good. The lettuce chicken was plentiful and good. And the lady at the counter talked me into some fancy mango tea drink and was nice and refreshing on a hot day."}
{"text":"Thai Foon is close to were I work and one of my favorite places for lunch. Service has always been very good as well as the food. The green chicken curry is very good - good enough that I don't look at the menu anymore."}
{"text":"Ate here on a Monday just after 12PM. Place was full, but I was seated and waited on quickly. I still managed to get out in less than an hour. I Ordered Garlic Chili Chicken with Jasmine Rice and really enjoyed the flavor of the sauce. Great combination of sweet and spicy."}
{"text":"Can't understand the bad reviews on this place, but I am glad I ignored them and listened to my friends suggestion. We used to live in Northen Va where Thai restaurants abound, and in comparison to other Thai cuisine and Based on taste and quality of food alone, I have to give this place 5 stars. It is legit, authentic, delicious with enormous portions for great prices. Order off the back page of the menu and you can't go wrong. We had the green curry and garlic chili and both were phenomenal. Not reviewing on atmosphere or service ( both were fine) just taste."}
{"text":"Our Go to \"Tai\" restaurant.
 Ok it is as Asian as P.F.Chang i.e. not at all. 
But I still like it. 
I alway have to have them spice it up th o a 12"}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoy this place.  The curries are delicious and my 2 year old loves the coconut rice.  Good food and at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I dined here for the first time this past Saturday and I was very satisfied. I LOVED that it was BYOB, with only a $3 corkage fee! 

My bf and I split the lettuce wraps and pork dumplings. Both were amazing. I am a huge fan of these types of lettuce wraps, and Thai Foon's are now among my favorite. The pork dumplings also had a great flavor. 

My spicy basil noodles were outstanding. It was HUGE portion, that I was able to take home and have for 2 more meals. 

The place was very clean and waitstaff was very friendly. Overall a great thai place!"}
{"text":"Went there for the first time last weekend. We got pad Thai, dumplings, and pho. All was delicious and the presentation was nice. The left overs were just as delicious! Thought the wait was a little long, but totally worth it. Will be back."}
{"text":"The soups are really flavorful. The Indonesian fried rice with shrimp and chicken was well suited to my spice palette, although a bit greasy.

Service was excellent."}
{"text":"Great place for Thai food!! They also have Chinese and Vietnamese options. Love their vegan/vegetarian section. Prices are great and portions are huge! I ordered a spicy level 3 and it was hot hot hot! Would highly recommend. Also BYOB."}
{"text":"I wasn't a big fan of this place for a few years. The food is really good now. This is my 2nd time here, I just had it last weekend. I got jap chap with chicken and green curry with chicken and coconut rice, I couldn't decide which one I wanted. It didn't disappoint. Today I got the sautéed mango with shrimp and extra coconut rice. I am so glad this place turn itself around. I'll keep coming back as long as they keep it up."}
{"text":"Thai Foon is awesome! I've had the spicy basil noodle and the pad Thai. I love spicy foods and these two are very flavorful and definitely spicy (especially the spicy basil noodles). The portions are big. The spring rolls and summer rolls are good as well. The summer rolls come with a spicy peanut sauce that is wonderful. I have had 2 different flavors of their bubble teas and they are really refreshing and fun. The atmosphere is casual, kind of noisy, and and could accommodate a family, a couple, or a bunch of friends."}
{"text":"Our group all had different entree and loved the food. The waitress was also very awsome!"}
{"text":"Nice clean sitting area. Great for lunch and perhaps an informal date.  There are two round enclosed booths for a semi intimate setting because if the sitting area was fun then I imagine it would get pretty loud.  The food is fresh and cooks are hard working. It's an open kitchen so You can see the food being prepared.  The staff is professional and friendly. It's located in a modern outdoor mall near the airport.  Of course the food is fast and excellent."}
{"text":"Went here specifically looking for boba / bubble tea! Very pleasantly surprised. You can get it to go and there are lots of options!"}
{"text":"Why is it so hard to find good Thai food! Grrrrr. First timer and new to area. 

Had the tom yum soup which was just ok. Would not order again. 

For the meal, ordered the drunken noodle. The noodles where not the good fat noodles...but the thin ones. That stinks. Very mild flavor and spice. Try a different dish. 

I'm not sure if this restaurant just caters to the American palate but they need more flavor."}
{"text":"I really like the food here but the experience today was terrible. My friend ordered a noodle dish with tofu (she is a vegetarian). The server got it with chicken. I told her it was chicken but she insisted it was tofu, only when she took it back to the kitchen did she come back and say they got it wrong. I ordered a stir fry udon with chicken, she got me  stir fry chicken with a side of rice. I told her i ordered a noodle dish, she kept saying it was the correct order. Asked her to get the menu n she said \"ohh ok, its the same thing. Do you want me to get noodles?\" \"Its the same thing. Il get u noodles on the side\". I told her i ordered a noodle dish because i wanted noodles, and the dish is to be stir fried with noodles not served on the side. What followed were ugly and angry stares from the chef in the kitchen, the manager n all the servers before i got my dish.   Not once did she come back to ask if everything was ok. 
Please train ur servers Thai Foon!"}
{"text":"If you do a spice level of 10 - Get your milk ready.

I love Thai food.   I have been to this restaurant several times for lunch.   I recommend the Basil Chicken and Pad Thai - Both are pretty good.   What takes this place over the average Asian Cuisine (like previous review - a fusion of Thai) is the spice level.   

Thai Foon provides fresh spices and have a rating system (1-10).   I like a an extremely spicy dish.   7-10 are extremely spicy.    

If you are feeling daring - try it :-)"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is not completely authentic Thai food, but more fusion. I got the drunken noodles with chicken and tofu at a 4/5 spice level. It was made differently from the way I've seen the dish typically. For instance, it has skinny flat noodles, as opposed to the typical wide noodles, it had tomatoes in it, and 4/5 was not very hot. I wanted to order the Tom Kha, but it is pricey and does not include a protein for some reason, so I passed. The space is lofty feeling; has ample seating and parking. Not my first choice for Thai food, but I wouldn't completely rule it out in the future."}
{"text":"My mom and I were shopping in the area last week and thought we would stop in for some noodles. I haven't heard about this restaurant before so I thought we should give it a try. 

The set up inside is really cute with bright walls and they even had a few private little cozy booths towards the front. The service was prompt and accommodating. I went with the usual Chicken Pad Thai and my mom order hers with shrimp. I have dined at many Thai places and I can't say Thai Foon wowed me. My chicken was very dry and tough and it just ruined the entire dish for me. There was something off with the flavor as well. They did give you a rather large portion and I did see a lot of chicken in mine, but I am not a fan of dry chicken so I just ate the noodles. I can't say I would jump at the opportunity to come here again. It's not the worst, but it's not the best either."}
{"text":"The Thai dumplings are very good! Nice thin wrapping, and tasty filling. The pas Thai is nice, not super flavorful, which was a bit of a surprise. Still good though."}
{"text":"Although the cuisine is mediocre, the service is nearly impeccable.  Our lunchtime crew of 8 was well taken care of and received our orders fairly quickly for a busy Friday.  When I asked for my food to be \"as spicy as you can make it,\" they didn't skimp, and brought me some chili paste on to boot, without me even asking!  Much appreciated.

TOM YUM SOUP:  Pretty typical tasting for an Americanized Thai place--flavorful without being very lemongrassy or very soup.  In other words, very palatable, as well as full of mushrooms and tofu.

PHO with BEEF: Came with all the toppings (basil, sprouts, cilantro) already mixed in and lime wedges on the rim.  Flavor wasn't very deep or authentic, which didn't surprise me in the least--good broth is a time investment, not something a lunchtime rush-kind of a joint can just mimic easily--but it was fine as long as your expectations are appropriately tempered.

TL;DR: This place remains a Robinson fixture.  Come here for your Thai fix for a work lunch but don't expect to be wowwed by authenticity."}
{"text":"The food here is always very good, i usually get the spicy basil chicken.
However, that's the last good thing i can say about this place. 

The front line staff is incredibly unprofessional. We ordered take out tonight and i decided to use the restroom before we left. I accidentally walked down the aisle between the seating and the kitchen and one of the waitresses very rudely told me to not walk down through that section again (there are no markers indicating no customers) and she acted like I was being the rude one. 

Also, within the 5 minutes we were waiting for our food, one of the front staff members were bickering and swearing about a problem with one of the other members of their staff. Keep that stuff in the back or in the kitchen. I would be incredibly irritated if i had children and they hear the staff swearing like that.

Those are only examples of the terrible service we've received at this restaurant. IMO, if you want to eat food from this place, order take out and try to be in there for the least amount of time as possible. I didn't not feel welcome the entire time i was there."}
{"text":"I love the Hawaiian fried rice, I get 2 meals out of it too.  Service is great,  I just wish there was one in Washington !"}
{"text":"I had a yummy lunch with my lunch crowd the other day.  We went to a place called Thai Foon.  It's a thai place.  Clever huh?  I had the \"Shrimp Jap Chap\".  The last few times I've been there I ordered the Pad Thai, which was excellent, but I don't like sticking with the same thing too long. . . it's a character flaw.  So I'd never heard of Shrimp Jap Chap, but that made it intriguing.

The waitress asked me what I wanted and I told her, \"Shrimp Slap Chop\", but she didn't crack a smile and just wrote down \"Shrimp Jap Chap.\"

We waited at our table, which was a round, but somehow too small.  Everyone seemed too far away, and if one of us pulled it close enough the rest were way too far. 

A little asian man came over with our food.  He said, \"Shi-sha-sho?\"

\"What?\" I said, confused.

\"Shi-sha-sho?\" Just as quickly, just as unintelligibly.  I turned it over and over in my mind for what seemed like an uncomfortably long time, but for what was, in all actuality maybe a second at most. 

\"That's mine,\" I said.  I wasn't positive that it was, but I figured that's just how you said it, if you were from Thailand.  The rest of the table looked quizzically at me.  I looked up.  \"Shrimp Jap Chap. . . shi-sha-sho.\"  I gestured at the bowl of noodles with my fork.  They chuckled.

It was excellent.  We finished and stood to pay at the counter.  The woman there was NOT thai.  She asked me which meal ticket was mine.  I pointed and said, \"Shi-sha-sho!\"  I'd been practicing.  She had no idea what I was talking about.  \"Shrimp Jap Chap\", I sighed, disappointed.

Good lunch."}
{"text":"Service was good and prompt. Ordered Premium Jasmine Rice with Beef and was really disappointed. Sub par cooking."}
{"text":"Sstarted with chicken lettuce wraps. The chicken had crunchy casaba in the mix that made it so yummy. Ordered the green & yellow curry plates. Wow! The green was delicious. The yellow was just what I was in the mood for. A little different in that it included yams/sweet potato instead of carrots. Service was quick and attentive. Definitely will return."}
{"text":"I love Thai food.  It is probably my most favorite genre of cuisine.  This was just 'meh.'  I had a taste of the crab rangoon, pad see yew, and tom kha soup.  The crab rangoon was okay - probably the best of the three, but by no means something I'd come back for.  The only worse crab rangoon I've had was from Sushi Boat, 2 days ago.  ((It's been a bad weekend for me, if judging only by the quality of my crab rangoon.))  The wonton wrapper was crispy, so that's a plus...?   

I only had one bit of the pad see yew - it was my husbands - but both he and I didn't really enjoy it.  There was just no flavor.  I can't really elaborate on more, though, since I had only one bite.  

The tom kha.  It's by far my favorite soup.  I get it every chance I get.  But this had several drawbacks.  1) tomatoes? Since when are there tomatoes in tom kha?  2) tofu.  Okay, but I wish it had been chicken. I wasn't even asked.  3) there were little slivers of lemongrass that were un-chewable and kept getting stuck in my teeth.  Yuck.   The taste wasn't quite right - it was basically there, but I think it was missing creaminess - it seemed more a tomato/chicken broth base than a coconut milk/chicken broth base.  

An okay atmosphere, but I'm used to the quaint coziness of most thai places (e.g. bangkok balcony, thai cuisine, smiling banana)...this wasn't quite the same.  

I'm glad I tried it, but likely won't be returning."}
{"text":"The food is VERY bland and tasteless. After my food came out, the waitress asked if I wanted a side of sauce. I got the spicy sauce and thankfully that did add some flavor to it. One good thing I will say, is that it is very reasonably priced. It wasn't the worst food I've ever had, but I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Best Pad Thai I have ever had. Would come here for lunch at least once a week with coworkers. Have since moved out of state and try to pick up to-go whenever I'm in town! Love it! Don't forget to ask for it extra spicy with no beansprouts!"}
{"text":"Not impressed- I love thai food and am not a snob when it come the foods I love- because I love them! 

Anyway I came here with my lady. We got the pad kha soup which was honestly the best part of our meals- but at the time we did not know. I ordered the Crispy tofu which was pretty much dry, without flavor except for the salt. Not impressed. 

Then came the entree- Pad Thai, a staple at every thai restaurant in America. There was not much taste- the basic ingredients were there but it had no spice and was missing the exotic flavor associated with Thai cuisine- it just tasted like noodles eggs and meat- which was definitely disappointing. 

The location was clean but when you look at it in detail seemed a little tacky with wallpaper peeling off the walls. Service was par at best- very nice but not as attentive. 

Prices and portions are pretty good. 

I will not bring anybody back because this place is a let down. Maybe there are some redeeming entrees but I will not risk  bringing anybody else with me to test it out."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and had #29 Spicy Garlic Chili Sauce ($7). The food was very Americanized, but it was quite tasty. I liked all the vegetables provided, except the pea-pods, which is a rarity for me.  I ordered it very spicy, but the spice level received was about 5/10. The portion size should have been a tad larger. The waitress messed up my GF's order: chicken instead of tofu. She took it back and came back nearly 5 minutes later, which pretty much guaranteed to me that they just plucked out the chicken and stuck in the tofu. Some people are probably okay with that. We didn't get one water refill the whole meal.

{"text":"We checked this place out for a weekday lunch.  The menu was pretty big and they offered a lot of lunch specials.  I ordered green curry tofu and the husband got spicy basil tofu.  Neither were spicy (our server didn't inquire about our spice preference), and we asked for some hot sauce.  She brought us sriracha and chili paste, but it didn't hold a candle to Nicky's!  I like my Thai SPICY.

My favorite part of my meal was the coconut rice--it was delicious and totally worth the upcharge.  

Service was a little slow, but they were pretty packed.  Also, try to avoid sitting by the door--we were COLD!  People kept holding it open, and the restaurant wasn't heated well to begin with.

I don't think I would make a special trip back to eat here, but it's okay Thai if you're in the area.  I did notice it was very family friendly; there were lots of babies and children running about and playing with toys, so if that's something you consider while choosing a dining options this would be a great choice for you!"}
{"text":"I ate here for dinner this past Wednesday with 3 dining companions before we went to a movie next door.  The decor of the restaurant was clean and modern and we were seated in what I would describe as a circular room big enough for 4.  It was an odd place to sit and was probably inconvenient for the server but proved nice enough for us to have a conversation without many distractions.

For my dinner entree I decided to have the Red Curry with Beef, extra spicy.  Like most curries, it came out as two separate plates,  one for the curry and one for the jasmine rice with which it was served.  The presentation of it was nice with the red of the curry going well with the brown of the beef, green and red of the bell peppers and yellow of the pineapple.  In its taste, it was unlike most of the Thai curries that I have had before.  It had a sweetness to it and while being spicy was not exactly what I had been expecting.  Regardless of that it still tasted good and I was more than happy to eat all of it.  When discussing with another dining companion later in the night she also mentioned that her Pad Thai was not exactly what she was expecting either although still tasted good.  We then decided that it was almost like a food court type of Thai food where you know the dishes that they are making but they are not exactly like you are expecting them, yet still tasty.

The bottom line for me is that I enjoyed the food here and it was more than reasonably priced.  I do not know if I would make it a point to come back but it proved to be a quick, affordable and tasty place to eat before a movie."}

{"text":"Good service, Great Value! Had the Chicken Pad Thai and portion was big for 8.50 dinner. Will definitely go to again!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Thai Foon and can't get enough of the spicy basil noodle with a Thai iced tea. Service is pretty quick and atmosphere is better than can be expected for a strip mall location."}
{"text":"Service was slow and painful. (Slow meaning longer than 40 minutes in an empty restaurant to bring food). 

The food was mediocre. There were 6 of us visiting. My food (Pho) was piping hot, and everyone else's food was extremely cold. 


After tasting the other dishes, I concur. There was one thing missing! Flavor.  It was like there was a general lack of pride for this location. Sorry. I really wanted to like this place!"}
{"text":"The food is a little on the expensive side, but it's so delicious and you get so much for the price that I think it's worth it. I'm a big guy and I've got a big appetite and I always end up taking some home with me for later. I recommend the Thai Foon house fried rice or the Thai Foon Crispy Chicken. Both around $13-14, but worth every penny."}
{"text":"I most recently ate the Thai Foon special stir fry with chicken-zucchini,scallion,jalepeno,red onion, and shiitake mushrooms in chef's special stir fry sauce-and I assure you it was anything but special. Very flavorless.The portion size was large. Also shared the thai spring rolls and I have had much better at Thai Place. Service was friendly and quick."}
{"text":"Not bad at all.  Definitely passed the Pad Thai test.  Deep flavors and lime provided.  Much better than most Thai places in and around Pgh.  also, they are authentic with spiciness.  Order a level 7 and your lips will burn!


Price isn't bad either, but the location is a pain.  Granted, it is X-Mas, but parking was a pain."}
{"text":"This place was more like Chinese than Thai, with the exception of a few classic dishes, except they charged $1.50 for the hot tea; which comes as a tea bag and a cup of hot water. They don't serve alcohol but encourage you to buy wine from a store next door and then charge you $3.00 as a corking fee ( even though the wine store can open it for you). Ambiance is nonexistent, and with a 25 ft. open ceiling is incredibly noisy! I ordered the garlic eggplant off their \"specialties\" list and that's all out was, a huge plate of eggplant; they did offer a choice of rice, white or brown, bit not a choice of spice. I think this restaurant has missed the whole Thai concept..."}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time trying out Thai Foon. My server, Molli was very helpful in recommending a number of popular selections among guests. I ordered the Thai Dumplings as an appetizer and the Drunken Noodles with beef as my entree. The Drunken Noodles had the perfect mix of sweet and spicy. I will be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"THEY HAD ANTS  The last time I went in there. This was a few weeks ago. They were taking the food from the kitchen. I did like their pad Thai although there crispy tofu was absolutely gross. The service is nice but our server gave us the wrong bill"}
{"text":"Not a traditional Thai place, but I liked their menu offerings and the atmosphere. 

We arrived on a Saturday night around 8pm and the place had maybe only two other tables. I didn't mind because I didn't want to have a long wait and Robinson is notoriously busy during that time. The service was a bit stunted, as our server wasn't all that friendly, but it was also helpful because he wasn't interrupting our conversation every five minutes asking if we needed something. 

We started off with some Thai iced tea that was served in two huge glasses. We both enjoyed them thoroughly. We had summer rolls that didn't have nearly as much mint or vermicelli noodles as I would have liked, but the cucumber addition was a nice surprise. I had Tom Kha soup that was mega spicy and a nice balance between coconut-y and sour. 

For our entrees my partner had the Thai stir fry and I chose the massaman curry. The curry was mega good--rich sauce and juicy pieces of meat just how a curry should be. The veggies weren't too soggy or too crisp, and though they didn't ask us to specify a spice level, it had a nice kick to it. The stir fry was alright and tasted more like just about any stir fry you'd order at a Chinese restaurant, but we both agreed the curry was the better dish. 

All said, if I'm ever out this way and in the mood for some Thai food I'd consider coming back for sure."}
{"text":"The waitress was too rude and was showing a lot of attitude. Never did I see an hostess behaving that way with a customer. Would never go back again."}
{"text":"First time here. The ambiance isn't very Asian. But, very good service and the drunken noodles were amazing. I will be back."}
{"text":"It's more Asian Fusion than actual Thai, but it's still delicious. Phad Thai with beef is always a winner. For me, i ask for no cilantro on top, as it tastes like soap to me, but hey, to each their own. If you like to eat soap, have at it. I always get a 7 out of 10 on the heat scale, perfecto!! Washed down with delicious Thai Tea, which could easily be an addiction for me. Thai Foon, always consistent."}
{"text":"Bleh! Don't even bother coming here for the Thai food!!!! The green curry was basically just salt and the pad thai was dry, yet oily. I haven't tried anything else on the menu, nor will I ever because I wasn't pleased and I will not be back."}
{"text":"There are many, many flaws to my personality.  Flaw #1:  I am not at all forgiving and rarely give second chances (esp. w/ people that I once trusted).  In restaurants, for whatever reason, I can and will revisit an establishment hoping for better food, service or both.  Today I returned to Thai Foon and departed a happy man.

On this lunch trip, we were the second table to be seated - just after noon on Labor Day.  The Tom Ka soup was very good, but not outstanding.  General's chicken was average.  However, please try the Spicy Basil Noodle.  Good flavors and pleasantly satisfying.  Can you get better elsewhere?  Yes.  Is Thai Foon well above average and perfect for the shopping crowd near Settlers Ridge?  Absolutely."}
{"text":"I love the Indonesian fried rice. Spice dish with shrimp and chicken. I haven't tried anything else yet, but this is one of my favorite lunch spots."}
{"text":"My wife and I are big fans of thai-foon and stop by whenever we are up by them. We always start with the chicken lettuce wraps which I consider the best around, my wife loves the pad thai no spice and I've had several dishes but get the house crispy chicken most visits spicy #5, the sweet of the sauce and heat of the peppers work so well together for me. We have tried several different places for pad thai for my wife but she says none compare to thai-foon."}
{"text":"I always love Thai foon.  Food is always great.  My go-to is the spicy basil chicken. I tried the hot and sour soup for the first time and it was really good.

I wish the lunch position came with soup or an egg roll like the other Thai place in Robinson (Papaya)

Lastly, maybe it is just a busy time for them on a week-day lunch but service is slower. We really needed our checks fast since we were on our lunch break, but the waitress was really hard to flag down.  Other than that though, we will continue to come.  Can't wait to eat my leftovers."}
{"text":"Great soup especially if you have a cold. Good chicken, vegetable and rice dishes!"}
{"text":"Decent chicken Pad Thai and a friendly wait staff. Good place for inexpensive Thai food."}
{"text":"I got pad thai take-out here.

I was put-off when I walked in, looked around and saw that there were only 3 full tables. 2 servers looked my way, no one came to greet me. I stood there for about 5 minutes until someone came by to see if I had been helped. When I said no, the server told me to \"hang on\" and went in the back to grab someone else. There were no apologies.

Pad thai was not remarkable. It definitely could have used more seasoning/sauce. I'm not sure that I'll ever be back."}
{"text":"Service was outstanding and as usual the prices are still unbeatable. Spicy basil noodle is by far the best dish on their menu. The crab Rangoon is also a very nice way to start the meal off. For 2 people eating you can get an appetizer and 2 entrees all under 25 bucks. Can't beat that."}
{"text":"I like this place for their Aram Tofu Mushroom Soup - but even this time it was way too salty. The Tofu Pad Se Ew tasted like bad chinese hor fun take-out and was extremely salty and spicy (even though I ordered a spicy level of 2 of 5).  The Tofu Pad Se Ew also had a random piece of chicken in it, which was very weird. Had I been a vegetarian I would have been very upset. 

Every other Thai place I'd been too has waaaaay better Pad Se Ew. Stick to this place if you want salty basic/meh chinese type food."}
{"text":"First and last time I will eat here. I was excited to try this place with all the good reviews but my pad see you literally had zero flavor. I thought it was odd when I ordered that they didn't ask me a number for the heat. I also thought it was odd that their entrees didn't come with a spring roll or soup, as every other place I've had gives you a choice. I was able to eat the chicken and broccoli out of it by dipping it in soy sauce. I did get the wonton soup as well which was fine but nothing to rave about. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"First, I love Thai food. Second, anyone who is making the statement that Thai Foon either a. serves traditional Thai food or b. that they do NOT serve traditional Thai food is nuts. There's no such thing in the US.  Most people I know would run screaming out of the kitchen of most traditional restaurants in Bangkok. Trust me.  Then...cut me a break. Dude. lol

I've eaten Thai food from all over the world and this compares favorably with 80% of the Thai restaurants I've eaten in.  Their dishes have the \"kick\" they should. Their curries are sweet when they should be, sharp when they need to be.  Is their chef going to win awards?  No, but then again, most chefs would be satisfied if the majority of people in the restaurant love what they're eating.  Basil noodles are very good. Their soups are interesting and flavorful, but not over the top!  If you like Thai food, try it."}
{"text":"This is by far, THE WORST excuse for a Thai restaurant I have ever experienced...I ordered the Tom Ka coconut soup and I could not eat it...it tasted sour...then came the disaster! I ordered what looked very appealing on the menu Mango stir fry...I chose with chicken...what I got was the most discussing dish...mango were no where to be found, the chicken was lame and rubbery, abundance of green peppers almost raw...I asked our very snappy waitress and she called the manager who had no explanation for the missing mangoes and the quality of the food...long story short, about 17 minutes I had a case of diarrhea...
I will never go back to this place again and of course can not and will not recommend it..."}
{"text":"This is a cozy 3.5-star place with laid-back atmosphere. The Jap Chap (Korean yum noodles) is very delicious and is presumably healthy (at least they wrote on the menu that it is weight-loss). The Stir-Fry Udon is soft but it bounces in your mouth. The Fried Banana has a very funny (positive here) taste with the chocolate dipping sauce. Make sure you ask for Jeff because he is a really nice guy!"}
{"text":"Good, at least to me.

Thai Foon clicks with me. I like my Asian food simple and they don't get carried away trying to throw too much in each dish.

My favorite, which I pretty much stick with, is the spicy basil noodles.  I usually get a side of chili oil so I can adjust the heat.

I like many ethnic foods.  It doesn't have to be perfectly authentic, it just has to taste good to me.

It is a fast turn around at lunch.  It does a brisk business, but usually no wait.  Dinner it is usually much quieter.
  
It isn't a fancy place, the decor is spartan but modern. You could have a dinner party here, but it isn't really that kind of place.  It is more of a lunch or dinner for 1 to 4 people type place. 
 It would make a great quick dinner before walking a couple doors down to the theater, but don't forget you will probably order popcorn, so don't pig out.

Give it a try.  It is inexpensive, and I am sure you'll find something you like."}
{"text":"This is not the first time that we visited this place, but today's experience forced me to write this low rating review. 
First off the food at Thaifoon disappointed us. Our common go dishes Pad Thai, Fried rice, Curries always taste good. They might go overboard a little with oil and salt occasionally but let me tell you, when I was pregnant I had a very very bad heart burn and yet managed to eat at this place without any issues(this was just an example of how loyal we are towards this place). Yet, today's rude service and (unreasonable)billing led me to share my experience.
We were visiting this place after a long while to ge together with our good friends. We were a party of 4 adults and 3 kids of whom 2 were a year and year and a half old and the third one was 4 something. When out order of big soup bowl arrived my husband asked the  person serving us if he could divide the soup into 3 bowls and give us to which his answer was 'this is how we serve it' which I felt was rude. And at the end comes the biggest question that I have, we were given the check and it included 11% service charge top of our actual bill!!!!
I am not sure if the kids are counted too because on whole we were 7 in number. My baby is not even an year old how could they charge us the extra 11% service charge ?? And not definitely for the kind of rude service that we were provided.

Thumbs down for today's experience. Once again ppl the food is good but may be we had a bad experience today, but the service charge is ridiculous"}
{"text":"I had pad see you and it was very good! Not too spicy - which I loved. Pretty reasonable for the portion. I just wish it had a little more sauce"}
{"text":"I always enjoy dining at Thai Foon. It is one of the best Thai Restaurant i have been in Pittsburgh.

I recommend Garlic Chilli."}
{"text":"So i tried this place for the first time because it's close to where i work. I order dumplings which were very good. But the main dish was displeasing. I got \"spicy basil NOODLES\" and received a bowl full of everything BUT noodles. No noodles at all.Broccoli onion chicken you name it. Everything but the actual noodles. Last time i order from there"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken lettuce wrap with plenty of lettuce for all of the chicken. The Tom ka was some of the best I ever had. Not too creamy just the right amount of sour and spice. Normally I have it with chicken but this was with tofu and it was just as good. The pad thai was good however it could have used a little more sweetness to complement the sourness. Nothing a packet of sugar from the table could not resolve. Plenty of peanuts on the pad thai. The bobba milk tea was excellent and the tapioca balls were cooked just right. It would be nice if they had more private seating and booths instead of a cafeteria like atmosphere. Overall a restaurant food that I would highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place has gone downhill. Cheaper ingredients and cooking shortcuts. The chicken satay was fried prices of chicken with a sweet peanut sauce from a bottle. Wonton broth was watery and nearly flavorless. 

On the upside- service is good."}
{"text":"One of my 2 favorite Thai spots. The chicken pad Thai is to die for and the salt and pepper calamari is GREAT. Service is always awesome and speedy!"}
{"text":"It is tough for me to believe, well not really tough, to find any decent Thai food around the Pittsburgh area.  You would think that famous known spots like Nicky's Thai Kitchen or Smiling Banana Leaf or a place called Thai Cuisine could serve decent Pad Thai or Pad See Ew, curries, etc.  I have struck out everywhere I went of course except for Thai Foon.

Thai Foon is located in Robinson Township not too far from the airport.  Though on a couple of visits they had a few \"off days\", overall their dishes were flavorful and reasonably priced.  I typically like to order:

Crab Rangoons- light crunch and not too thick or oily

Drunken Noodles - I always ask them to substitute the thick rice noodle they ise for Pad Se Ew since that is the CORRECT noodle to use for this entree.  

Fried rice - most times good but a few times too much salt or soy sauce added

Panang or Red Curry - rich and great over rice.

Jap Chap - delicious glass noodles that really is a Korean favorite called Jap Chae.

Keep Thai Foon in mind for your Thai craving."}
{"text":"Not bad at all. Skip the Summer Rolls but make sure to get Chicken Jap Cha (not in picture). Great service too. The server noticed that I didn't care for the Summer Rolls and didn't charge me for it."}
{"text":"I consider myself a true novice when it comes to Thai food. Read: NO EXPERT. So please take this review with that caveat in mind.

Looking to eat anywhere without reservations at the Settler's Ridge complex on a Friday night can be very frustrating, from the parking issues to the just plain crazy wait times at certain places.

Thai Foon had a table available, and the 3 of us are all fans of (what we consider!) Thai food. 
Notes:
Seated immediately at 7PM.

BYOB; there is a retail shop for an area winery next door, if needed. I noticed that the restaurant had very nice wine glasses for those who brought a bottle.

Why are many Thai restaurant interiors painted in shades of pumpkin?

Menu was not exclusively Thai by any means.

Service was spotty; I noticed that other tables served by a different waitress got lemon wedges on their water glasses--we did not. Waitresses seem to do all of the busing, and our waitress seemed to not know this.  Our waitress was very obviously new to the restaurant and new to waitressing, so I'm giving her a break. (But she was pretty bad)

Kitchen was slow for our order, people seated after us were eating long before we did; also it was obvious that my H's curry noodle dish was ready well before my & daughter's pad thai. Both pad thai's were steaming hot, husband's was very much not.

Our order:
daughter loves Bangkok  Balcony's Thai Iced Tea. She did not like this version.
~Cold edamame-unscrew-upable
~Summer rolls-very fresh tasty, mint leaves inside were nice. Have to admit to never having had one before, but I thought the texture of the wrapper was gluier that I would have expected. Wanted a spoon for the peanut dipping sauce--super good, peanutty and spicy
~1 shrimp, 1 chicken Pad Thai-very nice. Noodles perfect texture, plenty of fresh cilantro (no stems!). Daughter loved the shrimp, I wish I'd gone meatless. Chicken pieces too large and kinda slimy.  High quality take home containers.
~H had curry vermicelli noodle dish with chicken (you can chose protein-chicken, shrimp, beef-for many of their entrees and soups). He enjoyed it all.

I would try the place again, and hope for a more experienced waitress/waiter. The food was plenty fine and very reasonable.

Our bill was in the $30 range!! Can't remember the last time we paid cash at a restaurant :))"}
{"text":"4 stars  Spicy Basil Noodles and the Pad Thai were winners, the bubble tea with pomegranate and star mango was not."}
{"text":"Thai Foon was only so-so. This restaurant definitely brings the phrase, \"you get what you pay for\" to mind. The reviews that were posted before had it right. The service wasn't that great. The food was just okay, but I wouldn't call it Thai food at all. They didn't even have peanut sauce. The Pad Thai was lacking flavor and didn't have any spice. The Crab Rangoon was only okay (my husband loved it, though, so that could be me). When the server brought my phone back after scanning the groupon, there was ink on it. I still can't get the ink off. I want to call, but this might make me a douche bag. I'm not sure...

If you are in the area, skip Thai Foon and head to P. F. Chang's instead."}
{"text":"We love it here!! The food is so delicious and the service is excellent. We love the variety in the menu! Their General Tso's chicken is to die for, and the coconut rice is the best I've ever tasted!"}
{"text":"Took the staff awhile to ask us what we wanted to drink. Took them longer to get us our drinks, and then take our order. The food took awhile. At first glance I knew I wasn't going to like it... The curry is very thick, the tofu is cut into many crazy shapes (i didn't believe it was tofu), and they went over board with the fish sauce. I didn't like it. My sister got the sweet and sour chicken and sent it back... won't be going here again."}
{"text":"Let me start with this is my first review on yelp because I am usually super happy anywhere I go. I usually love getting take out from here during the work week, usually always tasty and I have never had a problem until today.  Today I ordered my usual red curry shrimp with coconut rice and a side of wonton soup. 

I have ordered the wonton soup before and they were big noodles. Today it looks like small dumplings with some sort of watered down chicken broth on top of it and it tastes disgusting. 

I called the restaurant to make sure I picked up the right soup and they told me yes. I told them the inside of my \"dumplings\" looked raw and the broth didn't taste right. The girl I spoke with told me that the small order has different noodles in it and I told her it wasn't what I expected. After a lengthy conversation with the hostess I was then transferred to a manager. What a joy this man was. He did not introduce him self, answered the phone with \"Hi\" and I had to lead the conversation from there. He talked in circles about noodles and wasn't willing to consider what I had to say. I ended the conversation with telling him it didn't seem like we were getting anywhere and hung up. I wish someone would have offered to do something for me, even replace the soup with a different one or refund me the $5 for the gross one.

This is a busy location with a lot of loyal customers with me being one of them. The hostess was easier to talk to than the manager. I might have to go on strike from Thai Foon for a while. So long coconut rice."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best. I was hesitant to go in because they had no customers at a busy time of day, but my wife was in the mood for Thai and I didn't want to drive to the North Side. I also have two coworkers that go to this place at least once a month for dinner. By the time we left, my wife was saying she wished she would have wanted a burger or pizza. The wait staff look and act like they are a bunch of college kids hanging out. We had four different people come to our table. Since we were the only ones there, it was pretty easy to hear the original waitress say to her friend, \"Can you check on my table?\" It seems that she was too busy texting or playing a game on her phone.
Now to the food. I ordered Green Curry Chicken, but Green Curry Onions arrived. The sauce was good and I used it to flavor my rice. The waitress came by to see if I wanted my onions boxed up, clearly missing that the bowl was full of onions. My wife ordered vegetable lo mein. Her noodles were way overcooked and the sauce had way too much salt to be edible. We left this dish almost completely untouched after the first couple of bites. 
The waitress mentioned that we must not be familiar with authentic Asian food. However, my wife is from Hong Kong (Asian by most standards) and I have spent a enough time in Asia to become a Permanent Resident. If you are in the mood for good Thai food, make the effort to drive to the North Side, Lawrenceville or Highland Park."}
{"text":"This was super delicious food. I can't believe they had yam noodles, what a find. If I lived in the city I would go to this restaurant every week. Had great service as well!"}
{"text":"We really like this place and it doesn't disappoint.

We've been several times, lunch and dinner and really enjoy this place.

It's a BYOB and we've brought wine without a problem."}
{"text":"I really liked this place but it was a little pricier than it ought to be. Hubs got the yellow curry with tofu option and it was $14 with fried rice. I got the wonton noodle soup (which I had been craving and you can't get this everywhere) and that was $11. Portions were decent sized though and we had a little bit of leftovers so that was good. 
The taste of the curry was excellent and the fried rice was actually close to what my mom would make and tasted really good. The wonton noodle soup broth was a bit bland and unseasoned though. The noodle they used were the wrong type for traditional yuntun mein dish. They were fine on their own, being eggy and thick but in this particular dish, they should have been the Cantonese thin, yellow, egg noodle. Oh, well, apparently it's a tricky thing to get right. Green Mango couldn't do it either. It did come with 8 yummy wontons and plenty of bakchoy (qing cai). 4/5 overall. 

Our waiter Jeff was prompt and got everything pretty quickly. Great service! I hope I get to sit in the domed area next time as that looked cool."}
{"text":"It is a nice place, service was great but... we came there to eat pho and it was horrible. Beside that we ordered summer rolls which were pretty good."}
{"text":"Awesome. Better than expected. Wait staff helped us make great selections being our first time. Went for lunch. Yellow curry w/ coconut rice was great. Wife had spicy basil chicken (she doesn't do spicy) and said it was great. Thai steamed dumplings were awesome. Would have given 5 stars but time between app and entree was long. I think they gave our food to a different table as I saw other table get food that looked like ours and then they sent it back. We'll definately be back.....maybe tonight. 

I want to go to an event catered by these guys so I can eat like 50 of those dumplings!"}
{"text":"Good standard asian - kind of like your neighborhood chinese restaurant - but with broader selection of styles.    Spring Roll Appetizer - standard, a little greasy - I believe they were made in house, but could have been frozen.   Had Pho for the main dish, good, fresh tastes - good size portion.     Service was OK, decor nothing remarkable."}
{"text":"Have been a regular here since the place opened and finally stopped going.  The food quality has gone down while the prices have gone up and up.  Today I sat alone for 20 minutes with a menu and no one once asked me what I wanted and no waiters could be found anywhere.  So I got up and left leaving my silverware and menu at the hostess counter.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"Thai in the name, but it's more of a mix of Thai and Chinese with a dash of Americanization. Meaning it's a smorgasbord of things.

I liked that I could get vegetable pad thai, as I was craving a little more veggies in my meal, but still wanted a noodle dish. The portion is MASSIVE. You could split a meal between two people and still be full.

The Pad Thai was just okay though. The sauce wasn't the best. A little more flavor would have been better. Plus, it was a little runny and I wished there would have been a tad more veggies. 

The bubble tea was a nice perk though. I just went with the traditional black tea and tapioca. I'd definitely pop in to grab one of these, but coming back for dinner, probably not."}
{"text":"I have been here several times and always have liked the food ive had. Today our server was Danni and she was inexperienced and did not know the menu. I asked for a specific vegan dish i always get. We got our appetizers and they were good. The entrees came and mine was not what I ordered. She then said what i ordered was no longer available and she brought something called jap trap. And it was awful the noodles were like rubber and they reminded me of octopus tentacles it was repulsive. I could not eat it and there was no offer to replace it with something i may enjoy. I was still reaponsable for the price of the meal although i did not want or order what she brought. All she said was im sorry it wasnt what you expected. Theyll never get my patronage again!!"}
{"text":"Not the BEST Panang Curry I've ever had but delicious nonetheless. Great atmosphere and a cool spot for lunch while I'm visiting family in the area!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are big fans of Thai Food, and this place is close to where we live. The food isn't extraordinary, but definitely worth the price. Also, the portion sizes are not bad either. Due to our busy schedules, we have been going here a lot more often for takeout (2-3 times a week, not kidding). Both of us get shrimp pad Thai every single time with only noodle, shrimp, and egg. 

Last night, my boyfriend ordered it and I picked it up on my way home. When we went to eat, we saw that our entire order was messed up. This is the first time that this has ever happened, so we weren't too upset. However, noodles are difficult to eat whenever you have to pick through a bunch of extras that you don't like. My boyfriend called and told them the situation on the phone. The woman on the phone said that they would make new ones and to just bring the food back as it came. When we got there, they refused to give us new ones. A man who I believe was the manager yelled out something along the lines of \"I CAN'T DO IT\" out of frustration and walked away. The woman who he spoke to on the phone then proceeded to say that next time we should know what we are ordering. The thing is, there won't be a \"next time\"."}
{"text":"When Thai Food first opened, I thought they were the best restaurant around, then the food seemed to lose its flavor. Maybe the novelty wore off for me, but I am glad it pleases my palette again! The vegetables are fresh, and I particularly like the green curry. I wouldn't say it is authentic Thai, but it is flavorful and delicious nonetheless. The atmosphere is relaxing, especially at lunch when it is quieter. The dinner prices have raised significantly over the last few years, but the lunch menu is very reasonable."}
{"text":"Better than outstanding. I have a great Thai restaurant much closer to home, and I've spent considerable time in Thailand. Love the food. But this place had things new to me that ere simply outstanding: The Thai Toast was phenomenal. The Tom Yum hot and sour soup and Indonesian fried rice main course were beyond sublime.

It's a cold winter day and the warmth and flavors are going to carry me thru the afternoon. I'll be back soon.

Great service and reasonable prices make this place a treasure."}
