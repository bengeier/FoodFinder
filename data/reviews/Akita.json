{"text":"Very tasty, nice choice of shushi. My favorite sushi place in montreal with a great service. A must see !"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the excellent food and the hospitality of the chef. The menu is quite extensive. They offered varieties of Asian food such as Japanese sushi, Thai, and Chinese. Everything is delicious and great presentation. We paid 3 stars price for 5 stars quality. It's a must try restaurant. Great service and personable.

We bought a bottle of wine and the restaurant provided glasses."}
{"text":"If you're a sushi lover this place is a MUST try! We tried the sushi menu and the asian food menu both were delicious. The chef came to welcome us and offered us free plates of his latest creations! A delight. It is fresh, delicious and the plates are very nicely dressed. Also it's very low price compared to the 5 stars quality of the food and service. Very quality and customer oriented. There is also a japanese style garden  ideal for parties. Must try: fuji, jade and tanoshi."}
{"text":"The more I ate, the more it was the same. 
Blended fish meat mixed with tempura drowned in mayo sauce. This sums up what   I ate. In addition, the miso soup was not really what I call miso: very thin, and no substance."}
{"text":"Nous Somme venue ici 2 fois et à chaque fois c'était génial, le chef est venue nous saluer personnellement et le sushi goutait comme le ciel. C sûre que je vais y retourner avec des amis. Qualités prix exceptionnel"}
{"text":"The place is very quite, especially at 5.30 PM, when they open for dinner. The food is super good. We took the sushi for 2 and they were extremely delicious. Don't forget to take a bottle of wine with you."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the positive feedback. Maybe it's because I ordered. Sushi quality was bad, there were some rock solid things in them which I still don't know what they were. The avocados were half-blacked out. 

It wasn't fresh. If you try, don't order at least."}
{"text":"This new Japanese restaurant in the east end of Montreal is a 'must-try'.

The food is very fresh and beautifully prepared by the chef owner.  

The service is polite and personable; the owner offered 2 specialty maki rolls to apologize for a slow service a few weeks earlier.  He recognized us and came to greet us as soon as we sat down.  He graciously thanked us for returning to his establishment.

Also, it's BYOW!"}
{"text":"If it was not for the location in a so-so strip mall in the east end, I would have given it 5 stars."}
