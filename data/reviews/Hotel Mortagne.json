{"text":"While the hotel is gorgeous,  centrally located and boasts beautiful rooms,  the consistency in service is lacking. I stayed for 3 nights,  Friday through Monday. I was impressed by the luxurious room right away. Instead of a standard coffee pot,  there was a Keurig with a variety of K cups on the Bureau. I opened the drawer to see if there were more k cups and find 2 empty (thankfully) boxes of embarrassing items. I closed the drawer and figured housekeeping would get those items layer they failed to throw away yon turning the room. Next I searched for ice. The ice machine on my floor was broken the entire time with no posted signage. In search of ice, the next door down had their amenities room locked for 2 nights. Finally found working ice machine on the next for I tried. I used half the ice and the rest melted in the ice bucket overnight. While I enjoyed having a King size bed with clean sheets,  the 4 pillows were very thin and each morning I woke with a very sore neck and back. I have had more comfortable beds at a Comfort Suites. I ate breakfast Saturday morning at the lobby restaurant. The food was decent,  though overpriced add usual at hotels. I was disappointed no continental breakfast was served. Furthermore, the service was terrible! Through no fault of his own, the waiter worked very fast and hard, but there was only 1 person to serve as waiter, host and busser for the entire hour I was there. Returning to my room that evening,  housekeeping had been by. The bed was made,  the trash taken out and the room orderly-at first glance. However,  the questionable boxes remained in the drawer. So I finally threw them in the trash not wanting the next person to deal with it. The towels from my shower were replaced,  which was frustrating because I followed the posted instructions to hang up towels so they didn't get laundered thus helping the hotel to be \"green.\" And my ice bucket was moved back to its place with fresh glasses. I picked it up to get more ice and it was still half full of the melted water from the night before. On Sunday, upon return to my room after housekeeping' s visit,  I discovered only some of the bathroom amenities were replaced. Namely, I was missing the makeup removers I had used the previous days which were not replenished this time. And frustratingly enough, I now had the option of sea salt scrub for my shower which was bit present upon check in our the previous housekeeping visit. The inconsistency in cleaning and service really bothered me. When I'm paying these prices,  I expect more than a pretty place. I expect superb amenities and service and found those sorely lacking."}
{"text":"Chambres confortables, ventilation un peu bruyantes."}
{"text":"Fabulous place to stay if you are going to Boucherville. 
Hotel is been renovated (still some areas being worked on). Lots of money has been put into this hotel.  
Service at checkin/out was professional and efficient. 
Restaurant is nice but service is slow. 
Rooms are modern and clean.
Plenty of restaurants nearby - walking distance."}
{"text":"Loved this hotel. It was easy to find. Plenty of parking. Friendly service. Whoever does the room cleaning was incredible. The whole place is well kept."}
{"text":"A charming modern hotel with spacious rooms.  The staff is very friendly, and adjacent to many restaurants nearby.
The out door terrace is covered and intimate for small groups or a large party. 
Recommended."}
{"text":"It seems that this hotel hasn't been reviewed in a while, and it's time for an update. My family and I visited here last month, July 2017, and was bitterly disappointed to see major renovations occurring when we arrived at the hotel. This fact wasn't mentioned when we made our reservation. Otherwise, we would have stayed elsewhere. The place definitely needed updating: the halls are dark, the rooms are dark earth tones, the smoke alarm outside our room was hanging down rather than flush with the ceiling, the beds are not at all comfortable (no box springs) and are too low to the floor. There are substantial wrinkles in the carpeting in the hotel's hallways. And, did I mention it was dark? The staff is friendly, but their friendliness did not make up for men in hard hats everywhere, noise, and unsightly areas around the building. The breakfast buffet was OK, but it didn't seem well maintained. We stayed one night and left the next day with sore necks and backs. Perhaps this hotel will be \"gorgeous\" again once the renovations are completed; right now, though, it's a dump."}
