{"text":"Amazing crepes and delicious coffee! We were visiting from out of town and stopped in because of the great Yelp reviews I ordered the Spinach, Turkey and Cheese crepe and an iced white chocolate coffee. The coffee: definitely better than Starbucks! And the crepe was perfectly made, and topped with yummy cucumber, spinach and a savory chipotle sauce. The service was also excellent the staff was so friendly and helpful. I recommend this!"}
{"text":"Drove by this lil shop and wanted to stop in. We got a white chocolate iced coffee and a mocha frappuccino they were very good. We didn't have much time to sit and enjoy a crepe but we will b back again to try it. Real small place but don't overlook it real friendly staff great service and great drinks!"}

{"text":"The customer service is exceptional and the got chocolate is sooooo good. The sweet crepes and Nutella and strawberries are a hit! A nice, quiet and cozy place. They take their time making your order to perfection."}
{"text":"Where to begin? Overall the food and coffee the worst I've ever had, I honestly recommend the owner to make some research about crepes and coffee. I ordered a latte terrible taste the coffee was burnt and super old taste, the milk had no texture at all, I'm sure they don't even know how to use a espresso machine, if you're gonna sell something at least know what are you serving because I was so disappointed  about this place specially being Hispanic is a shame they serve that kind of food and drinks, as for the crepe? Same as coffee they mixed water and flour and that was it, I couldn't even taste the egg or at least some milk in the crepe. Never coming back ever again, Hopefully the owner can read this and buy a crepe and coffee book or at least a you tube videos how to make a crepe and a latte. Sad!"}
{"text":"Yummy crepes and coffee! The owners are super nice! My friends enjoyed our first visit!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this experience. I felt nauseous after eating their ham and cheese crepe. It was cold and took them over 30 minutes to give us our crepes on a very slow day. Our iced mochas tasted like burnt coffee with old store bought creamer. The restaurant also had a very strange and unpleasant smell. Will definitely not return."}
{"text":"We loved the crepes! I got a turkey ham, cheese, and spinach crepe. My boyfriend got the simple ham and cheese crepe. They were both delicious, so we decided to order the banana and strawberry with Nutella and ice cream as dessert! We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Found this place by looking up crepes near me and so happy I tried it out. I got the Nutella with strawberries crepe which was pretty good! Definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes crepes. The staff was friendly, the place was clean.
Only downfall that it can be easy to miss because it's surrounded by abandoned stores in a dead plaza."}
{"text":"I ordered a cheese and spinach crepe with a vanilla iced coffee. I'll be honest I came him to compare the crepes to Colados coffee & crepe. Colados is way better the crepes and the coffee %100!"}
{"text":"Best crepes I had in awhile!!! And it's in West Valley! Crepes are made from scratch unlike other restaurants who use premix batter. I will definitely pass the word about this gem in the west valley!"}
{"text":"BEST CREPE and amazing service! I've tried many crepes, some too thick, some with too much Nutella.. these crepes are by far the best. Just the right amount of Nutella and fresh fruit. I highly recommend this place. The lady working the counter was very helpful and explained each crepe. I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Great service. (4 stars) Ladies offered samples of the lechera (condensed milk) and the cajeta (caramel). You build our own sweet crepe. 

Our sweet crepe was with strawberries, fresh cream, delicious lechera and cajeta. This was lovely! (4 stars)

The ham, spinach and cheese crepe fell flat. They use the same sweet batter for the sweet and savory crepe. The sugar content in the batter overpowered the ham and cheese filling. We liked the heat in the spicy mayo and the crunch of the cucumber. (2 stars)

Because the convenience, location, and the hospitality, we will be back for more sweet crepes!"}
{"text":"I got an iced latte with Almond Milk... the coffee tasted very bitter, stale, and burnt. It left that weird, residual aftertaste in my mouth that is usually due to low quality coffee. I'm not sure what kind of beans they're using, but I will not be going back. 
The crepes were listed as $5.25 for one small crepe, so I skipped it since it didn't feel worth the cost."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. It is clean and smells so good like fresh coffee. The staff is very nice and gave good recommendations. We had the pepperoni crepe and the ham, cheese, and spinach crepe. We also got a pumpkin spice latte and chi tea latte. Everything  was delicious and beautiful. We will definitely be going back soon."}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this crepe place and were quite disappointed. We ordered four crepes, two sweet and two savory, and though there were only 4 other customers in the restaurant, it took 20 minutes to get one americano and 40 minutes to get all 4 crepes. There was one man running the register and one cook.

When we got our crepes, we realize the \"spinach and cheese\" crepe had ham in it. My friend is a vegetarian, so we asked to make a new one, and the cook said we needed to give the crepe back to have her remake one. Since we were really hungry and it took so long to get our crepes in the first place, she just decided to take the ham out, but were disappointed they weren't more eager to make her a new one. 

I ordered the berries and cream cheese crepe. It was cold and there was very little inside the actual crepe. There were fewer berries than I am used to seeing on sweet crepes, and I wished they had been inside, and I wish there had been more of everything - not just 6 strawberry slices, 6 blueberries, and 4 blackberries.

By the time we finished, the place was packed, and I can't imagine how long it took for them to get their crepes. 

On the bright side, the americano was great!

We will not be returning and would never recommend this place. There are far better breakfast/brunch/breakfast places in the west valley."}
{"text":"Amazing little place Anna and Carlos do it right .Crepes and coffee on the Westside how cool is that! Don't overlook this gem...."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a very nice family oriented business! The owners are professional. The woman is very sweet and the hazelnut coffee the guy made was perfect. The restaurant is clean as well. The guy who took our order is very patient. I've never had a more perfect crepe, the best I've ever had! The food actually looks and tastes like it shows in the picture lol! Amazing! Such a welcoming environment!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat that wasn't a chain, on the way home from the Balloon Classic. It's a small place and when we came in there was only one family there but as we ordered there was a steady progression of people coming in ordering in as well as for takeout. The service was excellent and everyone was friendly. The coffee was exceptional as were the crepes. I really liked the mugs and plates it seems kind of a weird thing to notice but they were nice."}
{"text":"Staff was nice, seating got a little cramped.
Food was delicious. 
Wouldn't recommend it due to the wait taking 45 minutes."}
{"text":"Nice little place in a strip mall with plenty of parking.

Super friendly service. Excellent coffee - fresh, aromatic and good sized cup & saucer for an old fashioned customer who drinks it straight up!

Crepes were hot and fresh. We tried one savory and one sweet. Very Tasty. My personal opinion is that less is best so next time I would ask for a little less sauce but definitely would eat here again!!"}
{"text":"Small local crepes place I found while visiting in Arizona. I can say they were so delicious 
I don't know when I'll be back but I can say will stop by here again!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time and loved it! The frapp and the crepe were delicious!  Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The crepe I had was outstanding!  So delicious...with ham,spinach, and the chipotle sauce made it perfection.  Such nice people too."}
{"text":"InCREPEable

This morning I woke up with a craving for crepes, which aren't so easy to find in the West Valley.  On the recommendation of fellow \"yelpers\" I headed to P.A.K Crepes and Coffee to satisfy my craving and I'm so glad I did.  

P.A.K Crepes and Coffee are made from scratch and are absolutely delicious. This small little eatery located in the West Valley is serving breakfast and lunch, with a selection of wallet-friendly sweet and savory crepes, for a mere $5.25.

P.A.K offers a variety of crepes to indulge your every craving. Theres Chicken,Turkey, Ham, Spinach, Cheese, Yogurt, and Fruit options. On this visit I had the Peach, Carmel, Pecan, and Cream crepe. I can honestly say that this is one of the best crepe I ever had. I can't wait to visit again and try the Nutella and chocolate sauce balanced with cream cheese and strawberries and bananas.

In addition to delicious crepes P A.K offers Hot & Iced coffee, Frappuccino, and smoothies. The Iced  White Chocolate Coffee was the perfect pairing for my crepe.

If you find yourself craving delicuous crepes and coffee head over to P.A.K Crepes and Coffee,  you won't be disappointed. The staff are friendly and inviting and the place has a nice casual vibe."}
{"text":"Customer service isn't the best, and that's why I wouldn't give them a full 5 stars. Crepes were AMAZING though! I decided to give this place a shot because I was looking for something relatively good for the price, and boy does this place hold up to that expectation. I was surprised by how good the crepes were and the iced vanilla coffee I had wasn't so bad either. Inside the atmosphere seemed a little stuffy and somewhat dim, so I chose to sit at the only table that was placed outside. Overall, great crepes, and good coffee for a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Place is simple, but does the job. Crepes and coffee. They have some savory/salty and dessert crepes. Their coffee is pretty good as well. Iced hot or blended. Even though it's a small shop I'd probably come back every once in a while."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good :-) it's cozy inside and the the staff are really nice. The menu is simple and food was good and fresh. Coffee, tea and hot chocolate are also available but I just had water.

I decided to create my own crepe and had a cream cheese filled crepe with strawberries, peaches and whip cream. I happily polished my plate and needless to say, I will definitely be back to try a different flavor combination or perhaps a savory one."}
{"text":"Great little family-owned coffee shop. Hubs and I stopped off here one morning when neither of us had to be anywhere in a hurry. The coffee and crepes were great and we'll definitely be back. This place is run by a lady and her husband, and all of the food and drinks were made on the spot. She was friendly and chatted a bit since we were the only ones in the restaurant. She mentioned that they can custom make any crepe or combination of crepes and that the ones on the menu are just suggestions. We look forward to coming back and trying something else."}
{"text":"The crepes were delicious the service was outstanding I went there with my grandma and my honey earlier this morning and I would definitely think about going and eating there again in the future."}
{"text":"Crepes are delicious, coffee is amazing. Service was fast. We sat on the patio and they brought eberything out to us."}
{"text":"Love this place!  3 of us decided to meet early morning for a bday celebration for my 15 year goddaughter.  Small mom and pop shop with great service plus popping good FOOD!  I got the Ham and cheese crepe, my first savory crepe in a long time.  It was very very good.  I was too full to try a dessert crepe.  NEXT TIME!"}
{"text":"Amazing crepes and service! Family owned and operated is always a good indication. I had a strawberry Nutella crepe and I loved it! Can't wait to try their other varieties!"}
{"text":"I had pretty big expectations based on other Yelp reviews... I was sadly disappointed. 

My husband and I were looking for an afternoon cup of coffee, so I saw this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We walked in and it was seemingly just the family/owners sitting in the cafe. The coffee menu was alright, but you can tell they don't specialize in their beverages. 

It had a weird smell in there and I went to go use the restroom twice and both times it was occupied. One of the employees said, \"oh wow that guys taking a long time huh?\" which just made me uncomfortable. 

The coffee was just not good. I couldn't even drink half of my iced coffee. 

Maybe it was a bad day, maybe the crepes are amazing. But I probably won't be back to try."}
{"text":"The peaches and Nutella crepe was great. The customer service was awesome. It's a little pricey but I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!! The coffee is so so so tasty. The variety of crepes you can pick from is so awesome! There is something for everyone! The fruit is so fresh. I would go there everyday if I could!"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. Crepes are really delicious and the coffee (white chocolate iced coffee) was really good. We will go back soon!"}
{"text":"Got the Nutella crepe and it is to die for!!! Strawberries, bananas and Nutella. Customer service is amazing... super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Great Coffee!!! Came in asked for a latte and it was delicious. Hope there were more places like this on this side of town, kudos to this place!"}
{"text":"What a nice little place for delicious, sweet crepes! The staff was attentive and friendly, the coffee good and a bonus for us: a happy, giggling baby visiting for a bit! They have savory crepes, too, but when you're looking at strawberries and peaches with caramel ... ! I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We were looking for a nice place to eat before heading home to CA. Found this place and I am glad we did. My latte was so good. Great flavor and they have choices of regular milk or almond milk which is a plus for me. The spinach and ham crepe was very satisfying with slivers of ham and the perfect amount of cheese. We topped our meal off with their desert crepe...so yummy! The owner told us she used fresh strawberries and she even makes her own crepe batter fresh too! We'll be back."}
{"text":"Small little hidden place in an area that I was iffy about ... however it proved me wrong amazing food, clean, freshly made, and incredible service !"}
{"text":"Great find in the west valley! After a few morning visits my co-worker and I decided to have a working brunch.  This place is one that I had been wanting to try, thanks to Yelp... 
Small, chill, and clean restaurant. Everything on the menu appeared mouth watering and the decision was tough to make. I ordered the spinach, cheese, tomato, cucumber, and turkey ham crepe. I must say, it was cooked to perfection and the cucumber was an ingredient I'd never think to add for this meal in particular...turned out to be a delightful combination of taste with the chipotle sauce. I also ordered a caramel iced coffee which was the best I've had!  Big win for me and my co-worker,  who was so excited to eat here. Both our appetites were well satisfied. We will definitely  go back to try the sweet crepes next time."}
{"text":"Three of us visited this small restaurant on a Sunday afternoon because I was really craving crepes and just moved into the area recently.  The environment was quaint and very clean. There aren't too many tables due to the size but we had no problem with seating. The menu is concise and cafe style (hand written on a blackboard).  At the register/order placing counter they offered us a visual companion to the menu.  All of the pictures were accurate to what you would receive.  The order process is a walk up counter with an open kitchen view.  After placing your order you then sit in the open seating area and they bring your food to you.  We ordered the ceviche, the berries and cream cheese crepe and the kids crepes which has nutella, strawberries and banana slices.  I've never been a fan of places that over stuff their crepes with sweets and this place had just the right amount of filling.  The crepes themselves were cooked to perfection and they were packed with flavour.  The ceviche was really good as well.  I personally have a low spice tolerance and I was able to enjoy it without being overwhelmed with spice.  They also offer coffee/tea and ice cream.  The Chai was a nice mild spice variety and the presentation was well done.  The plate size was great for the price tag.  With our three plates and my Chai Latte we spent right around 20 bucks and were happily full afterwards.  The staff is super pleasant and helpful.  The service was fast and they made us feel very welcome.

Overall this place is a wonderful hidden gem and I will absolutely be back in the very near future to explore more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Pros: The staff was friendly

Cons: While the staff was genuinely pleasant, they lacked a general sense of urgency.

It took a significant amount of time to get our food on a relatively slow day. 
Once food was brought to us it was cold. So this tells me it was sitting around. 

Crêpes were soggy, cold and left myself and guests feeling uneasy after consumption. I ordered berries and cream cheese, friend got ham and cheese crêpe and my son got Nutella and strawberries. 

I also ordered a medium iced mocha coffee and it was the worst coffee I ever had... I am no coffee connoisseur by any means.  I told the woman it tasted powdery and she claimed no powder was used to make it.

It did not smell good in there. 

I will not return."}
{"text":"The younger girl working the counter is super sweet and very attentive.  Amazing, deliciousness, fresh food! Coffee is good too. Good prices!"}
{"text":"Nice spot off the beaten path to relax with a cup of coffee and delicious crepes . Loved the ham and cheese with spinach and the Nutella with banana and strawberries."}
{"text":"These are the best crepes I've ever had! There are only 3 savory crepes the rest are all sweet. They are so good we drive 45 miles to come here! The coffee is excellent too."}
{"text":"The place was great it's a small family restaurant and the crepes are big and the flavors are to die for and as we sat there inside eating a guy was walking his 35 year old tortoise awesome experience would go back !"}
{"text":"The BEST crepes I've ever had - by far!   I had the berries with cream cheese inside, mdrizzled with Nutella and it melted in my mouth.   I was going to share with my sister, but I changed my mind.  The owner so nice, friendly and hospitable!   This place is worth the drive no matter where you live.  I'm going to try the ceviche the next time I'm here.  I'll report back soon."}
{"text":"Sweet crepes & Salty Crepes served.  Custom coffees,teas and lattes.  Cerviche also just added to the menu of this West Side gem.  We came here looking for coffee after my son's football practice,  glad we found this place.  The staff was super nice and the spot is welcoming."}
{"text":"Tried this place this morning for a quick business hook up based on other yelp reviews. Looks like a family owned and operated joint. Coffee and crepes were very good and the staff was very friendly. Only two tables inside and one outside. The crepe menu was just pictures. They need an actual menu with ingredients for each crepe. Little things to improve on but the food and coffee are good. I would recommend."}
{"text":"This place is cute and they cashier was very sweet. BUT we waited 45 minutes for 2 crepes and 2 cups of coffee. And they also forgot to put in the cream cheese. Althou it was good food the service/wait was awful!. We most likely would go back but we would know we will be waiting a very long time."}
{"text":"Super nice staff and the food was great will definitely come here more often ! The only reason i haven't heard of this place before was due to it being hidden but other then that all positive feedback on this location! I had the Nutella crape it was very good next time I'm curious to try the pizza crepe !"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a light breakfast or lunch. I like the visual pictures of what they serve. Full off of one crepe was. Was very good almost couldn't finish the whole crepe."}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Didn't know what to expect but could not be happier with our selection.  Also the people are incredibly friendly and make sure that everything is perfect.  I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Excellent little coffee shop, got a latte and the Nutella crepe. The family that works there is very courteous and delightful. Definitely would recommend if you enjoy coffee and crepes without being a complete snob"}
{"text":"Holy crêpe!

My buddy and I came here for a late lunch the other day and got a coffee and crepe each to share. My friend got the caramel coffee and a Nutella Crepe and I got a white chocolate coffee with almond milk and a Spinach Crepe. 

The crepes were absolutely delicious. The Nutella crepe had a nice thinness to it and I appreciate that they didn't go too crazy with Nutella. The bananas and strawberries are always a tasty accompaniment for Nutella. Now the spinach crepe... I absolutely enjoyed the heck out of my spinach crepe. It was stuffed with ham and cheese and topped with tomatoes, cucumbers, spinach, and drizzled with chipotle cream and crumbled cheese. It was a nice savory treat and the cucumbers made it refreshing. 

As for the drinks, the coffee was a bit on the watery and sweeter side. I don't think I would order the coffee again although it's worth noting that it still put a pep in my step!

It's a clean and cozy spot and the owners are super friendly. I'm totally smitten by the hospitality and excellent service. 3.5 stars but rounding up for the great service."}
