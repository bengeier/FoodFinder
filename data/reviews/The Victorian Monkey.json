{"text":"This new restaurant/ pub/bar has taken off and deservedly so. Situated in Cliffside, never known as a destination,  now has one.
This is a large room which can get noisy, but joyfully so.
The relatively small menu is an asset as the food is excellent, the staff intelligent and accommodating and the atmosphere of pine floors and bric-a-brac walls.
Pasta, tacos, burgers, steak frites, etc all thoughtfully put together and delicious.
Been several times as it is a local for me and yet to be disappointed. Guinness on tap !
The monkey has their own parking lot next door - a bonus"}
{"text":"Had a delicious dinner here with friends who swear by the place. I had the Thai chicken curry bowl (delicious! Deep curry flavour), friend had burger (homemade, fantastic), and other friend had fajitas (again, very good)  Lovely beer selection and neat pub vibe. A welcome addition to Kingston Rd and this area!"}
{"text":"Great service, fantastic staff and atmosphere. When we had a blackout a month ago they opened their doors, their taps, and their wallets to provide free pizza and beer to their cold neighbours.

The food is exceptional, especially for a place which is primarily a pub. Great Steak and Fries, and the holiday roast and English pudding tasted like it came out of a proper English pub.

Fantastic selection of beer on tap, and a decent range of scotch, too. 10/10, stay away. I don't want this place too crowded."}
{"text":"Great local spot to throw back a couple pints. Food and drinks are good and the service is very friendly. This is our new spot when we're out this way. This pic is of the free nachos and wings they gave us during the SuperBowl!"}
{"text":"I came here with a few friends around 10PM on a weekday and only late night menu available at that time. 

Food was OK - nachos for $18, decent size and taste wise was good for a late night snack. Wings were alright. Nothing really blowed us away. We also ordered some cocktails which were about $10/cocktail. Cocktails were quite yummy

What stands out about this place is the amazing atmosphere and service. We loved the decor of this place and the games they had. They have a shuffleboard, darts, and quite a few board games! 

Parking was not bad for us. Great service - our server came to check up on us a lot. Lots of beer on tap. Overall, a great place to catch up with friends, to grab a couple of drinks and to have fun!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and gamea to play while you wait. Good food and good portion sizes.
Veggie samosas were really good and not dry."}
{"text":"Went here on the recommendation of my sister. Had the Salisbury steak, as per her recommendation.  I feel that the cook may have been at a disadvantage, having never eaten real Salisbury steak. Obviously nether has my brother-in- law. It was a dry, grill patty with gravy on it. Nasty. The menu didn't really thrill me. A lot of stuff you know is going to be full of cilantro. Yuck.  With so many places out there I won't waste my calories on this place again."}
{"text":"I had read the Yelp reviews and had driven past the place several times before . On a late Saturday night, decided to visit the place for dessert. Man, this place was a nice surprise. It's very clean, has a beautiful decor and friendly staff. We tried the \"mile high\" chocolate cake that has five decadent layers of moist chocolate cake with whipped cream. It was amazing (and quite heavy!). Overall, this  place is easily one the best pubs in Scarborough area. It has a dedicated parking and there are a lot of games that you can play out there. All this make it a compelling reason to visit the place. Kudos to the owner for getting creative with the decor!"}
{"text":"first time visit last Saturday for Lunch , Great wait staff  , interesting menu

with Bands on weekends...live music !

and to top it off .....Monkey parking !"}
{"text":"Went here to try the wings on wing night (Tuesday) because I had recently read a good review on Blog TO.   Wings were outstanding! Big, meaty and delicious! Tried the garlic parmesan and they were very good. The atmosphere was great! Service was excellent. Had Scott as our waiter and he was very nice and attentive. The decor inside is very neat and also cozy. Would love to see more restaurants like this to turn up in the East end. Will definitely be coming back. Have also read the burgers are good here (homemade). They have burger Wednesdays... So will be back next week. Will be telling everyone to try this place!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 30 this past Saturday night and everyone loved this place. The staff, especially our waitress Jessie, was truly awesome. Really great service, good food and she kept up on all our drink needs. 
Fun atmosphere, shiny and new and very clean establishment. Loved all the interesting decor. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Had lunch here the other day. The place is super cute - very nicely decorated. I ordered the brie and bacon burger and had the fries. The serving size was substantial and I could only do half the burger. The toppings were also plentiful and the carmelized onions were tasty. The meat was a bit bland in terms of seasoning, but the quality was there. The fries were okay. I mean I didn't leave any behind which says something. The only down size is the service was slow! The one server working had a lot of tables to contend with, so she could only be so attentive. Having said that, I would return."}
