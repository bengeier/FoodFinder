{"text":"This place is great... Fun atmosphere,  great fast food and amazing shakes-more flavors then you can imagine."}
{"text":"Used to love this place...went here tonight and they are horribly understaffed. I know it's not the employees fault but it took about 10 min just to have someone come to the front to take our order. Out of 6 orders they messed up on 2. The employees were very friendly and apologetic,  but that doesn't make up for it. A lady at another table took her burger back up to the front because it was served raw. We have been here at least 5 times and unless things drastically change back to the way they used to be, we will not be returning. Buns were soggy...fries were over salty...and everything just seemed sloppy :("}
{"text":"I have a new second favorite corn dog!  (Hot Dog on a Stick is still my favorite, but with the closest location about 15 miles away, #2 will likely become my #1.)

The menu consists of burgers, hot dogs, corn dogs, fries, and ice cream goodness.  There are a few kinks to work out as my trip through the drive-through took about 10 minutes, and there were only 2 cars ahead of me, but overall the service was very friendly.

I thought this was an interesting location for Iceberg with a Sonic right across the parking lot, and the menus being so similar.  But I thought Iceberg was better than Sonic, so hopefully they'll do just fine here."}
{"text":"Ridiculously large \"mini\" milkshake! It was really good though! And their prices seem pretty reasonable as well!"}
{"text":"Hamburger was great.  Known for the awesome onion rings and ice cream. French fries were really good, came with fry dip. Kid meals come with an ice cream cone great value."}
{"text":"It's strange how your memory of a place comes into play.  I hadn't been to the Mesa location (long since closed) in over 8 years.  So I decided to stop in tonight in Gilbert.

Perhaps it was the lack of coordination being a new place, maybe my tastes have changed.  But I honestly enjoyed my daughter's Whopper Jr more than my entire $11 combo meal from Iceberg.  Yes, $11.  The 1/4 lb burger combo ($8.09) was $9.19 which included an up-charge of 30 cents for a regular sized (very large, 32oz or so) shake, plus an .80 up-charge for onion rings vs fries.

The (mostly) unseasoned burger patty was tender, and the bread was fresh, but it just didn't have any taste appeal whatsoever.  As someone else mentioned, the rings were very, very thick such that I received exactly 4 in my order, although they weighed in around 8 oz worth of onion.  And these definitely needed some salt and/or pepper.  I finally got smart and dunked them in the \"fry sauce\" basically a smooth thousand island dressing -- at least that somewhat approximated the direction of a bloomin' onion from Outback.  The extra order of fries ($1.89) were those corn starch dunked regular cut fries that never have appealed to me.  For those, I used the off-brand ketchup that they serve prepackaged in Solo condiment cups with lids.

Clearly, the best part was the shake.  Unfortunately for me, that came out within about 3 mins of placing my take-out order at the counter.  Then, after having inquired about my order, the grub finally came out 22 mins after ordering whilst the shake had melted.  I did ask if this was normal and was told, \"no, definitely not.\"  I was rewarded with a coupon for a free shake.

Will I use it?  Yes.  Will I order something different?  Probably not; but I might try the corn dog by itself.  

If you go, give it a month or two to stabilize.  But there are much better burger choices around."}
{"text":"Great food! We ordered a cheeseburger combo with a shake in place of drink, and a couple grilled cheese sandwiches for the kids. The food was great! Cheeseburger was very flavorful and the fries were perfect with fry sauce! We ordered a \"mini\" shake which was anything but! All four of us shared one shake. I highly recommend Iceberg. Great food and fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Service is so slow here. we waited 25 minutes for our food. there was a lady there that had already ordered before got there and she didn't get her food until 20 minutes after recieving ours. This is the second and last time coming here. The shakes are good though."}
{"text":"Like other commentators, the speed of service is horrid. If you see a long line already at the drive thru, I advise to keep on driving. The quality of the ice cream is very satisfactory, but it's hard enjoying it when poor customer service and speed of service are low. It was also disappointing to see them skimp on the amount of my ice cream despite having to wait an incredibly long time (not only because the huge Gilbert family in their Suburban in front of me took forever to order - which they did - but they argued at the drive thru attendant and spun out their tires as they left). For that, they only get two stars and my only visit back to them is if I'm the only person in the store."}
{"text":"New ownership hasn't helped this place at all. The employees are teenagers who have no idea what they are doing. That aside, the food is overpriced and nasty.  We had soggy fries and undercooked Chicken strips.  The shakes are huge but lack flavor for the price.  You are better off next door at Sonic if you want a decent burger and shake."}
{"text":"If you want a GIANT milkshare in a variety of flavors- this is the place to go. The food was cooked well and the staff was friendly. Next time I feel like cheating on my diet, this place is definitely an option."}
{"text":"Shake, Shake, Shake!  Amazing shakes!!! Cute place. good lunch specials and kids meals. The staff is very friendly!  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for soft serve chocolate ice cream on wafer cone.  The price was perfect. The ice cream was very good
Also I checked in and received free fries which my husband said were better than MacDinalds and Inn and Out Burger."}
{"text":"I tried the grilled chicken sandwich and have to say it didn't taste very good. The piece of chicken was not very hot, looked like a frozen piece of meat that was heated in a microwave or something really quick since it didn't have the fresh off the grill look that I expected. They put very little lettuce and some ranch style dressing in it that made the sandwich very wet and soggy if you don't eat it really fast.  It was something to try once just to say I've tried it."}
{"text":"The food is good (my son LOVES the fry sauce!), but the service is pretty bad...although generally entertaining. Our order is wrong pretty often. Once we pulled through the drive through and no one answered so we pulled around to the window, we could see like five people inside, but no one was wearing the headphones so they didn't know we were there. We waited a few minutes then gave up and went to Sonic. I get the feeling that a lot of stoners work there."}
{"text":"I go here a few times a year with family after sporting events. It's the same old same old. You do get a massive cup of ice cream for a fair price, which is nice. The flavor of the ice cream though, it's mediocre at best. It's very bland and none of them really have a strong taste. You can get much better tasting ice cream at a place like Dairy Queen, but obviously not as much. Their food is pretty good though. I have gotten burgers and chicken tenders from here usually. The chicken tenders are very good and I do love their fries. But all in all, it comes down to the ice cream. And that isn't worth much to me."}
{"text":"I really love this place! I used to go to Burger King or Inn 'n Out when I wanted to eat a good burger with fries and a shake, but ever since I've gone here, I seldom eat elsewhere for burgers. The service is great, the food is great, and the music is fantastic! Go here, you will not regret it."}
{"text":"I re-visited this place in honor of my sister's dance recital (she insisted- I tried in vain to stop her) and the service did a flip-flop on me. Last time the workers were rude and snobbish. This time the workers were very friendly but horribly understaffed and slow. I feel bad commenting on how messy the floors and bathrooms were, because you could tell they were trying to do their best. But it still took almost 15 minutes for us to get our shakes, and they completely forgot about one table. Poor guys were running around like chickens with their heads chopped off. I just haven't really been impressed with this place.. shakes could be better and the food is stuff my high school has served. 

If you do go here, don't get the cheesecake flavored one. It will make you wonder what strange flavor they gave you."}
{"text":"This place used to be so good.  Not so much anymore.  If your coming for ice cream that's great. But if your hungry eat somewhere else first.  After waiting 20 minutes for food, the burgers were cold and fries barely warm.  I won't be coming back again, which is too bad become I used to come every weekend."}
{"text":"The flavor of the food is good and the onion rings are absolutely massive. My only criticism is that the fish strips are very small and consists mostly  fish was the fried part. Good flavor though. Friendly servers. Not the fastest drive thru. They we're out of my son's drink of choice. We will most likely give the place another shot."}
{"text":"I will never  back to this place!  First of all there was a sign outside that said they had a $5 special with a burger, fries and a drink. When we tried to order that special, we were told it was a lunch only special. Service was the worst ever! We waited over 30 minutes to get our food and when it came the burger was soggy along with the bun. And there was no flavor whatsoever. Also the Philly Cheese Steak was burnt when it came out. We took that back to the counter and asked for a new one, that took another 20-25 minutes. There was other people that had been waiting for over 35 minutes for their food. They got their money back and left. Not good when you end up with stomach pains after eating. I will not be going back!"}
{"text":"Your strawberry shake is to die for. Great thick and delicious.  I have taken my grand kids to eat here and they love it.  BUT you had better share the shakes because they are huge in size, and I bought the smallest size.....  thanks a great place to eat and sit down and relax. thanks

Opps, I almost forgot to tell you about their onion rings. You have 1 whole onion in a serving !!1 They are the biggest onion rings that I have ever seen. Hummm good.

The place was clean, the help was great. We WILL be back again, but be hungry. Thanks. Wendy"}
{"text":"Good Ice Cream... HORRIBLE Ambiance... (yes ambiance is a snooty word, but you get what I mean.)

15 minutes of looking at the dirty windows, dirty floor, pretty much dirty everything in a dining room that was too arm while waiting for two ice cream treats.  Place wasn't busy."}
{"text":"I ordered a regular (yes, it's big) mint shake and then used the yelp check-in for free fries.

The interior was pretty clean, and the cashier and manager (needed for the coupon) were friendly.

The shake was thick and more of a DQ Blizzard in consistency.  Their mint syrup is VERY artificial tasting.  This sadly resulted in a medicinal aftertaste.  It was served with a spoon.  Their straws are very thin and cheap, so even when your shake melts it is difficult to drink with one.

The fries were edible.  Crispy and hot, but overcooked.

There's a giant banner outside advertising that the restaurant is under new ownership.

This seems to be a popular place for local families to go (all the other customers had groups of children), but the taste of their flavoring syrup is not for me."}
{"text":"Rudest staff of any fast food joint I've been to. Food also takes long and is no better than Sonic. I hate this place."}
{"text":"Good shakes and a great value for the money. They also have a yelp check in for free fries!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money. Ordered a shake and although it was huge, it was terrible. Had about eight bites and fterwards my tongue felt covered in slime. Will never return.

In response to the manager.
 Thank you but no thank you."}
{"text":"I haven't had a bed experience here! This is my go to place for ice cream comes for the kids and myself as it's actual soft serve not the gross type of ice cream you get from McDonalds. Their shakes are good but to me a shake can be drank with a straw and these aren't like that so I don't really go here when wanting a shake. 

The food has always been good and we love the corndogs, you have to wait a bit longer but it's so worth it as they are always fresh and hot! I also cannot get enough fry sauce with my food!"}
{"text":"This is a fantastic place for that summer night ice cream shake!  We love experimenting with the flavors to get a new experience every time, although there are certainly the fallback favorites.  It's handy to have a good food selection, too. If you're looking for fast-ish food that's a monster step up from sonic, with a dining room, this is a good choice."}
{"text":"Average. Onion rings are huge...kids meal is a good deal choice of chicken strips, cheeseburger, corn dog, or grilled cheese. Fries a drink and ice cream cone for less the $4. 
#1 single cheese burger was good not a ton of flavor. Price is average. They do not have small shakes...they are very large. Overall average."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Iceberg - it seemed like a fun idea and I was looking forward to some yummy shakes. 

Regrettably, it was just not very good.

The exterior is the corner of a small strip mall, the interior is elaborately 50s dineresque.

We visited at around 9:30 or 10:00 on a weekend evening for shakes. There were NO other guests in the dining room and two employees at the register. 

We ordered, the employee was a typical teenaged fastfood employee - took our order but she didn't really make any other impression other than being very casual in her speech. 

We ordered shakes - I got the smaller size, my husband got the larger option. They took a looong time - probably 10+ minutes, which I thought was strange since there weren't orders in front of us. 

The \"shakes\" looked really odd when they came out - the shake stood up above the top of the cups. Although we'd ordered different sizes, there seemed to be the same amount of shake for both - the cups were just slightly different: super weird! 

In my opinion, a defining characteristic of a shake is that it is drinkable, through a straw. These were not... they were simply soft serve icecream that seemed to have been slightly mixed and then put into the cups. I got a chocolate peanut butter shake, which was chocolate soft serve mixed with a bit of peanut butter (like, Jif or something along those lines) My husband got chocolate, so it was just chocolate soft serve. The icecream itself wasn't flavorful at all, and wasn't even satisfyingly creamy. 

It was altogether disappointing and I don't recommend it, unfortunately.

:("}
{"text":"Iceberg makes a great shake!! The \"Mini\" is huge and the \"Reg\" is gargantuan both are shareable sizes. For those of us who originate from Utah, they have fry sauce and it's yummy! I wasn't a fan of the onion rings (batter wasn't my favorite and the rings are to large to enjoy,) but their fries are good. They make a decent cheese burger as well if you are hungry. 

Recommendations: \"Mini\" Oreo & Cheesecake shake & Fries w/fry sauce"}
{"text":"This place is close to our house and that is the only reason we go there because their food is mediocre. burgers over cooked and have no flavor same with onion rings, custard is okay but what's with the shakes that are basically a giant cup of ice cream. Sundaes very basic and added toppings will cost you. Mostly kids working, nothing worth returning."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! Would eat here more often if it didn't throw me off my diet so badly lol. Not the healthiest treat. But delicious! Just had their summer shake flavor Cotton Candy. So delicious! The burgers are incredible. And my favorite fries you can get in fast food by far! So delicious. Fry sauce is a must! And it's truly a good bargain for the price. Some complain that it's pricey but you get the amount you pay for! I can rarely finish a meal! Great business wish them luck!"}
{"text":"I like how iceberg supports the community. Our school went there for a fundraiser and ice cream shakes are amazing."}
{"text":"Their \"shakes\" are more ice cream than a shake, but they are really good. They have a huge selection of flavors/combinations of flavors to choose from. Their mini size is huge & can easily be shared or saved to have later. The food overall is decent at best. The onion rings, fry sauce, and the zucchini sticks are good, but I wouldn't go there for lunch/dinner. My kids love to get a \"shake\" from there, and we live close, so we do go regularly, but be prepared to wait if you go through the drive through, also, whenever we've gone inside it's always messy (all dirty tables and we're the only ones in there) It is awkwardly quiet, no music playing, and the tv's on the walls are off, so you can hear every little thing going on in the kitchen. I'm hopeful that the new owners can turn it around :)"}
{"text":"2/17/13 Update:

I've changed my rating from 2 to 3 stars.

The reason: the milkshake. Pretty darn delicious. The wife tried the pistachio and I went with the rocky road. This place makes a killer shake! As per my previous review from last week, the drive thru was still slower than you'd expect from a fast food place. Would I return for the food? Nope. Would I come back o a shake? You betcha!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wasn't impressed with this place. 

I ordered a #1 (Hamburger) with onion rings. Nothing special. The burger with alright. Nothing I was like OMFG!!!! The onion rings I didn't care for and would never order again. They were extremely huge and thick (that's what she said) and were over battered. 

Another thing that I noticed was the drive thru service was slow. The kid gave me my food first, and then I had to wait close to a minute to get my drink. 

I didn't try the milk shake and am willing to go back and try it next time I'm in the mood for one."}
{"text":"I received an undercooked chicken sandwich from this location which even had blood in it, which seriously concerns me, as I was pregnant at the time and would rather not get sick with salmonella. 

I called the shift manager to explain the incident to him and he offered me a refund and to talk to the cook. I didn't take the refund because I was at home and was not prepared to drive the several miles back to the restaurant. 

Not only did I lose my dinner for the night, I lost my appetite altogether and peace of mind. 

The French fries were good, but I don't think I'll be able to come back after the undercooked chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"Guess this place is under new ownership and I'm no longer impressed.  Burger lacked flavor, seemed to be a frozen patty, and was undercooked.  Service was slow, very slow.  Especially since we were the only ones there.  Staff was friendly but confused.  Probably won't be back...which is sad cuz we used to love this place."}
{"text":"Always a great experience when we come in!! Logan the manager is great!! Got us our food and drinks quickly and friendly!! This is our go to shake spot!!!!"}
{"text":"Just got milkshakes, so review is only for them. Other than them being HUGE, there really isn't anything good to say about them. They are actually kind of bad. I got the grasshopper and my husband got the chocolate. I do not think we will be back (unless every other ice cream place in a 15-mile radius goes out of business).

You are better off heading elsewhere."}
{"text":"wow.I am so annoyed that I ended up here. wanted something quick, a double bacon cheese burger, or something. 

1. home made menu board? Only burger listed is single 1/4 pounder. there are pictures that presumable ended up there after owners kids made the menu. they show a burger with an onion ring, and one with pastrami. they are thumbtacked to the wall.

2. it appears that 100's of people have been smearing burger grease all over every piece of glass in the place, and then someone brings in a gaggle of dogs to smear their noses on the glass.

3. The tables were all dirty, it was 4 or 5 oclock on a tuesday. we were alone with the exception of a customer that arrived while we were eating. we had to carefully check the tops of each table till we found one without ketchup or fry sauce smeared over the table.

 4. the food is not good, I didnt get a bacon double cheese burger because there wasnt one on the menu. foot long coney dog...mustard and ketchup. I asked for onions and got onions cut in circles, for a burger.  I got the onion rings. meh..they are the super huge ones that are cool to look at but are crazy annoying to try to eat. they would have been better if they had been seasoned at all. by the time they hit the table, seasonings wouldnt stick (there is some deep fryer rule about this) grilled cheese....mmm this should be good, how do you screw this up. it was like toast with the cheapest, lowest grade cheese money can buy. I make them at home with generic cheese slices and they are delicious, so i didnt expect them to use kraft singles. corn dog. meh again. it was crispy on the outside and hot and chewy on inside, again, hot dog was super low grade. it didnt have any flavor. and what the hell is that weird after taste?

5. When I went to get mustard at the counter I noticed that there is a sign outlining the \"fry sauce\" costs and guidelines.....wtf? its fuckin ketchup and mayonnaise mixed together. the kid at the counter told me that. either way, if people like it enough to want more, give it out...thats what makes places like in and out and freddys succcessful, not being cheap assholes with ketchup and mayonnaise.  

6. the kid at the counter was an ALL STAR. he was far and away the only highlight. he was super friendly, and super helpful. 

7..I wanted to pull my own trigger when i left the parking lot and realized sonice was right next door. Seriously, i was so annoyed that i had eaten this sorry excuse for food from this wanna be burger/shake stand.  

Sonic isnt spectacular food on a normal food scale. but in comparison to ICEBERG it is delicions. I expected a lot more. I wont be back.

I suggest you hit freddys or in and out for a burger, sonic for all the other things this place makes badly.

If the owner is reading this, I genuinely hope you take this to heart and do a better job. You don't belong in the business if you think you are on par with the competition. Start with CLEANLINESS and then try to make fresh food that tastes good."}
{"text":"We arrived at 8pm with the drive thru light ON with 2 other people in line and didn't even get acknowledged. Not happy"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! 

They have every flavor you can think or and some you don't for shakes! They have a so called \"mini\" shake. It's so thick and big I have yet to finish even a quarter of one yet. Their burgers are awesome and the fry sauce it's so good. My kids love the grilled cheese sandwich meals. 

This place is my little indulgence."}
{"text":"Iceberg's ice cream is great. The texture is like custard and they give a great potion size. I would definitely go there again. On this, my first visit, I ordered the Carmel Pecan shake. It taste like butter pecan custard and was very yummy."}
{"text":"I wanted to give a five star review but I can't make myself do it due to the speed of service. We did the drive thru and it took almost 15 minutes to get two meals and two shakes out to the car. 

The 4 stars was definitely for the food and ice cream. My wife found this place and recommended we try them out. The burgers tasted fresh and the grilled onions were delicious. The big kicker was the shakes. These things will change your world. If you love Bilzzards, you will never go back to that other place. Order a small because it took me three sittings to finish all of mine! 

We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Best shakes in the world. For the same price as a DQ Blizzard, you get more than twice the ice cream and it's better. Great environment for kids, too."}
{"text":"They say according to all the store signage on the front doors and in the drive-through website and store voicemail that they are open until 10 PM on Sunday evening however the store was closed at just after 8 PM and all the lights on including the neon signs still saying that they were open. Should not be that hard to be open when you say you are!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place less stars I would. I wish I could say I ate here but I never got to...

My friend and I pulled up to the drive-thru a few months back to order some food. The person on the other side of the asked us what we would like, and we said give us a few moments please. We looked at the menu and talked about it, and during this time you could hear the person on the other side waiting for us to put in our order. We were finally ready and started ordering, when all of a sudden the girl taking the order chuckles and says with a laugh \"our oven is closed, we can't cook food.\" While saying this she increasingly starts laughing, as if it's funny that she let us sit there debating over what food we wanted so she could tell us we can't have it. We then said ok...and couldn't understand why some kept laughing...when we tried to order she just laughed at us...so we said \"ok never mind, bye\" and she replies with \"okay, byeeeeee\" while laughing. It was the rudest thing I've ever experienced. 

We later called the place to ask for their names so we could talk to the manager and advise them they were losing business. The guy that answered sounded extremely you (as did the girl in the drive-thru). When we asked him why they didn't have their oven in, he tried to make up an excuse of how they turn it off an hour early to clean it. This was total nonsense; why these kids working there think they are smart and can get away with such a lie is beyond me. I've worked fast food, and no one operates like that, they just wanted to leave earlier. Ultimately the guy kept stumbling over his words and lies that we just hung up. 

All I know is that the girl's name working the drive through was TRINITY. She needs to get fired and needs to learn how to do a job she's being paid for.   

-edit- they are now closed and a sodalicious is in its place. Good riddance."}
{"text":"Eat someplace else. Come here for ice cream and onion rings. The food was a 2 star at best. Not disgusting but not good enough to come back to eat. Loved the onion rings. Just wish they had good ranch to go with them."}
{"text":"We went through the drive thru for a shake & malt.... We both got a \"Mini\" is more like a jumbo.. Portions are HUGE. Chocolate Mal and cookies n cream shake were both amazing."}
{"text":"Been back several times and I will say they have some pretty legit shakes. They are huge! I like the chocolate chip one. The banana split is yummy, too. 

I had the food once and was not impressed. Will not be doing that again. This rating is solely for their desserts as that's what I go back for now."}
{"text":"Personally I like this place!! I'm glad they are around, especially with their awesome shakes!! Service is great too! :)"}
{"text":"What's with all the hatin' going on here? Good food, Mondo sized milkshakes and decent assortment of fried side dishes. I really like that fact that you can add a bevy of toppings on your hamburger.  (Kind of like that other place. You know - rhymes with \"Jive Ryes\" ? ) I like 'em real big and juicy - and Iceberg did not disappoint. That is after I realized that you can add hamburger patties as an option. I had no problem with the milkshakes and THE 47+ FLAVORS! (Geez, these things are so good even you can even find them at Golfland!) Good food, kid friendly, nice peeps. Check it out for yourself and don't be a \"sheeple\"."}
{"text":"Awesome milkshakes. Thick, cold and delicious. Iceberg could have earned five stars if the food didn't take so long to arrive at our table. We got our milkshakes and waited an additional 20 minutes for the food we ordered. Other than that, everything was great."}
{"text":"This is our guilty pleasure go to! Awesome fries, onion rings, shakes, burgers and enough variety to please everyone AND they have fry sauce!!! Service has been excellent every time."}
{"text":"I love this place!!!! The chicken fingers and ice cream are so delicious. 
You get a lot for your money. Nom Nom Nom."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Please don't waste a dime here.
As Jessica P. states below, I also had very high hopes for Iceberg since I am a shake and frappe lover.
The ice cream tasted fake and I took about 4 bites and was done.
I don't see this place lasting for too long here.  There are too many other places within a half mile radius with better tasting shakes."}
{"text":"Giant shakes and pretty good food!

Got the shake and onion ring combo. Onion rings nice and crispy. I wish they had chocolate available but the machine broke :("}
{"text":"Delicious food and always treated great!!! Love the chicken stripes and spicy fries with the fry sauce. And the mini shakes are ginormous!!! You can substitute your drink for a mini shake, highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The owner was working the counter, and explained the menu to us; what a nice guy.  Great burgers, awesome fry sauce, ONION RINGS that are colossal, and the best shakes you'll ever encounter!  The place was spotless and the service was lightning fast, too!"}
{"text":"Love their food and the service is even better! I was treated as if I was in a 5star restaurant with constant, \"how are you doing?\" and \"would you like anything else?\". My two favorite employees are Marcus and Luis who are always working hard and friendly when I visit for lunch. The chicken dinner is my all time favorite and I also love their fry sauce! Going to stay a weekly customer due to the food and customer service!! Not your regular fast food restaurant, beats in n out ANYDAY!!!"}
{"text":"BEST SHAKE PLACE!!! Yes the shakes are $5-$6 BUT they are HUGE!!!! We always split!! PLUS they have fry sauce. Yes fry sauce!!!!!!! Check in with Yelp while
Your there and get a large fry and fry sauce FREE!!! Have I told you how much I love YELP!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place took my kids there weekly for ice cream and hamburgers. I am moving and am really going to miss this place."}
{"text":"Have I mentioned I love this place!? Just stopped by for shakes and they were so friendly and cute I had to write another review. I wish both my 5 stars would count because they really do deserve it. 

Everyone is always extremely helpful, service is fast and the shakes are always awesome! I checked in after I ordered so I didn't see the check in free fries! Yay! They were getting busy so I didn't want to hold up the line for free fries so when the gal came out to get my card, I asked if they had some ready, great, if not, fine too. They were ready at the window along with my mountainously awesome, chocolate cookie dough shakes and we were out in like 5 minutes total. Was great! I haven't tried any other food and prob never will, but I'll definitely be back for shakes!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for the first time and was actually surprised that the food was decent and the ice cream is good. Hubby said burger reminded him of a old drive in. Cooked well and cheese was melted just right. 

I am only giving them three stars due to the lack of cleanliness around the restaurant.  The management needs to play closer attention to the details around the restaurant such as garbage cans, window sills, bathrooms and tops of tables. Understanding I am a Territory Facilities Manager so I tune into this type of details, but have a expectation when at a place eating good.  

Nothing was so impressive that will bring me back."}
{"text":"The food is just ok and sooooo over priced.  The shake is good but again way too expensive for what you get.  I don't think this place will be in business for long because they are just too pricey for what you get!"}
{"text":"We came here because of two personal referrals we received for it. This place is awesome! I can't speak for the food because we only had ice cream, but their shakes are huge and delicious! They have so many options to choose from and they are a way better deal than a dairy queen blizzard. The staff is very friendly and helpful and made our first experience a great one. We will definitely be back and pass on the good referral for them!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today. I love the decor but was very underwhelmed by the actual meal type food options.. This is more of a snack and shake place. The prices are very high and even with using coupons we got in the mail we spent $17 for 2 burgers, 1 soft drink 1 \"mini\" shake, 1 order of onion rings and 1 order of zucchini.

My husband used a $2 off combo coupon on his order and I used a free onion ring with any shake coupon

The Onion rings are enourmous..you get 4. They come with a tasty sauce which had I not had I would not have eaten the onion rings..The batter was bland and basically tasted like oil onions.. The zucchini was the same way. .. Fresh thick zucchini but bland batter.

The burgers were decent, husband did his pastrami style and really liked that. 

We shared a chocolate almond joy shake. . It was supposed to be a mini but apparently they over made it and dropped the smaller cup into a large cup and filled it the rest of the way. . Unless that's how they make their shakes (cup inside a cup).. it was weird to eat half and then find another cup.  Melted very fast for a \"thick\" shake. . In fact was pretty liquid when we got it.

Prob won't go back."}
{"text":"I agree with parts of other reviews about the teenage staff. In fact there's a lady asking for help right now and they are in the back horsing around. I ordered a double burger and they brought me a single.They begrudgingly asked me if I wanted a new one instead of just making one. Shakes are huge and good, the burger are small and nothing special."}
{"text":"This place is super dirty... So dirty that it smells. Staff (hate to say it) looked like they hadn't showered in at least a week. Plus, there was a GIANT cockroach on the ceiling. I was skeeved out. I couldn't wait to get out of there. My dirty diet coke is going straight to the trash."}
{"text":"I think this place is definitely better than people give it credit for. Some of the food items are hit and miss but its definitely better than a lot of other places. The portions are huge for the price and they are always having deals and coupons if that's your thing. My biggest complaint is the costumer service is always kind of odd here. The first time I went I used the drive through and had a pleasant social experience, but the couple of times after that has been inside and usually results in being a bit awkward customer service. The food is sometimes not as hot as it could be either."}
{"text":"So....this place is in no way terrible...but also in no way is it great.

The pluses:
* The \"mini\" sized milkshake is the size of a bucket. I was anticipating a DQ sized mini blizzard. Not so my fellow ice cream lovers. You will NEED to share this with someone. Or face the consequences of gaining 12 pounds instantly.
* Service was friendly.
* They offer sweet potato fries.

The minuses:
* No vegetarian option. C'mon...no veggie burger?? They offer a kids grilled cheese.
* The young man who took our order was...well, young and got distracted easily and confused about the menu items, which thoroughly confused me when ordering.
* The restaurant was not well kept. The dining area looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in a day. We ended up lightly cleaning our own table before sitting down.
* The bathrooms...well...not clean. Waste of washing my hands.

Probably won't be back personally, but if the cons were rectified, could be an ok place for the High School crowd."}
{"text":"I went there for the very first time and it was amazing. The service was GREAT!!!! We will continue to go there."}
{"text":"Stopped in for an early lunch! We had a burger combo and a chicken sandwich combo. Talked to manager and he said burger meat was fresh not frozen and it was tasty! Chicken sandwich was cooked to perfection and the fries were delicious! We've always loved Iceberg and this visit didn't disappoint! Plus we got enough icecream to feed an army! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Wasn't good! My Caramel Pecan shake with added malt just taste like vanilla ice cream"}
{"text":"This review is for ice cream/ French fries only.  
We decided to try this ice cream place over a nearby frozen custard restaurant.  In the mood for ice cream we ordered four different types and one order of fries to satisfy the salty taste buds.
Swirl cone: the good: good size cone.  The bad: it took about 7 min to arrive which seemed like a long wait for just a cone.  Once it arrived the ice cream was just tasteless.  Neither the vanilla or chocolate had any taste.  Also the ice cream had a weird after taste, almost like artificial sweetener.  About 1/4 of the cone was consumed by an avid ice cream eater.
Cherry chocolate chip shake mini size.  The good: this is only a mini in giant world.  It was the size of an extra large soda.  The bad: flavor was as above lacking and had a weird after taste.  I don't know how they accomplished in, but even the maraschino cherry pieces had no taste.  So now I was stuck with a truck load of inedible ice cream.  About 1/4 cup of the huge portion was consumed.
Chocolate dipped cone:  The good: this one was consumed 100%.  The bad:  came out pretty quick.  Coating was decent.  Came with the option to get chocolate ice cream but again it was flavorless.
Fries:  The good: hot, crispy and salty.  Fry sauce was a neat addition. The bad: they took about 15 minutes to come out.  I was already so disappointed in the ice cream that I tried these simply to avoid wasting more food.  
Verdict:  I will not return. Too many other choices for soft serve nearby and an hour later I can still taste the weird after taste.  Not the pleasant treat experience I wanted."}
{"text":"We love the shakes! Big selection of flavors. The food is good, too. My only complaint is ten minutes waiting at the drive through window, when I was the only car. My shakes came out right away, and melted in my car for the remaining nine minutes. I'd suggest making the shakes last. Since the shakes are large and the ice cream extends above the edge of the cup, I had a puddle on the carpet if my new car by the time I got home."}
{"text":"The service is a 1-2 star and the food is a 4-5. Like others before me have stated, it seems to be run by teenagers with little direction from an adult.  Also, the service is slow at times. 

The last time we were there, they charged us for one meal, and gave us another. We also didn't get the free fry with our shake.

Advice to the owner: retrain your staff and get rid of the ones that don't care about their job."}
{"text":"Sitting at the drive thru first time here! Had an offer for free fries on yelp so decided to try it out! I think the kid at the window might be new! Or really clueless but I can tell he is young and prolly his first job so I'm cutting some slack there ! It's been a couple minuets now. Think I confused the shit out of the people with the offer on yelp! Doesn't seem as if they knew about it. 
 The food is ok onion rings are huge and good fries decent 
Chicken sandwich is better then the single burgers! 
The burgers have a bit too much sauce dumped on them! 
Nothing spectacular just the onion rings worth going back for lol !"}
{"text":"WELL, I see all the below comments are ditto to mine.  1st time there and I can guarantee the last.  The food came cold and no taste whatsoever, the staff wasn't any different, that is if you can find them. \"We waited almost
4-5 minutes for someone to wait on us, and when they did rushed us like they had somewhere else to be\" (oh did I mention there was 1 other table there) soooo yes it wasn't busy AT ALL.

To bad in this busy location they won't last long either while their competition is.........across the street \"Burger King\" (not a much better example but a familiar name to all) ICEBERG even though it is a national chain \"what kind of rookie name is that\"...Oh yes did I mention Freddy's hamburgers only 1/4 of a mile (that's the one to beat) and no chance in that.

NOT IMPRESSED AT ALL...."}
{"text":"This place is delicious but the main reason why I gave it 3 stars was the fact we waited over 20 minutes until our shakes and onion rings came."}
{"text":"Drove by here this morning and saw that it is closed for good. It appears some kind of soda shop will be opening there."}
{"text":"Even though the swirl cone was pretty tasty, the bubble gum shake came out with 2 (yes, TWO) pieces of gum, when we asked about more pieces the window clerk said \"oh, we just ran out\" since our 4 year old was looking forward to the gum, we asked to speak with a manager, who went and got more gum to put on the shake? Why lie about something so silly? We will never be going back.  Especially since the onion rings were greasy and tasteless as were the French fries.  Out of the 4 items we ordered only one was worth eating!!"}
{"text":"Go here for a large (gigantic) shake and stay for the onion rings and special sauce. Service is okay, music on our last visit was quite loud."}
{"text":"I expected more.. 
Being that they specialize in ice cream & shakes, I was expecting a delicious afternoon treat. 
I ordered the regular size cookie dough shake. 
First off, their portions are HUGE. 
I could only finish the top portion and had to throw away a whole cup. It comes in what I could compare to a 32oz cup. So much ice cream....
Second, there was barely any cookie dough. A couple small chunks here and there. 
This place is not worth the money and I will not return. I'd rather go to Dairy Queen."}
{"text":"Ice cream was tasty, but the onion rings were tasteless and greasy.  I am a huge onion rings fan but this place didn't live up to the hype.  Sweet potato fries with marshmallow cream dipping sauce was just ok.  But the shakes...more like a blizzard type ice cream was fantastic!  We'll come back but just for the ice cream!"}
{"text":"Totally disappointed!! Ordered the fresh strawberry shake & they used strawberry syrup. When we asked about it they told us - \"oh sorry, we ran out\".  The banana split had 1/2 of a banana, vanilla soft serve, chocolate & butterscotch syrup. Oh yeah, they were out of strawberries. 

Portions are huge but if the order accuracy sucks - what's the use? 

Stay away until they eliminate the bait & switch!"}
{"text":"Horrible service messed up all three ice cream shakes that we got and we had wait 30 minutes for everything"}
{"text":"A decent \"backyard\" burger and some interesting options for sides make this place I could return to for my fast food fix.  The ordering is a little strange, since double burgers are not listed.  You have to order a regular burger and then add an extra patty. Regardless, the patties are generous and a double suited my man-sized appetite.  I also ordered the fries, (monster) onion rings, and spicy home-fry style potatoes.  The onion rings are pretty large and in-charge with a massive crunch.  Fry sauce that comes with the sides is tasty... similar to ketchup and mayo mixed.  Couldn't really detect any extra spices on the \"home fries\", but they were scarfable nonetheless.

I'll be back to try the shakes, as it seems like this is what Icebergs is known for.

And I'll probably pop in for another \"iceburger\" sometime. But, as we all know, this classic drive-in indulgence is best considered an \"occasional\" food, as not to completely decimate my girlish figure."}
{"text":"Slow slow slow slow service. Didn't end up getting anything because I was waiting in line for way too long. Seems like this place is disorganized. Serving shakes to people who already received them, even after the lady explained that they already got them. Seems like the place is ran by a bunch of teenagers. Which is okay, kids need jobs too however someone responsible needs to be in charge. Hopefully I will return and have a much better experience."}
{"text":"Great burgers, wonderful fries (with an amazing fry sauce) and the milkshakes are humongous.  The manager came to the drive thru window just to check on me while waiting.  Everyone that works there was very nice."}
{"text":"Don't go here 1 hr before closing because they close the grill down that's right they close the grill down 1 hr before closing. Have you heard of such a thing. Rediculous. Why stay open for that hour. If you plan on eating that yummy burger they advertise make sure you come an hr before closing because you won't get it. Dumbest thing ever."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Iceberg Drive Inn for the first time and I did not love it.  We both ordered milk shakes and Iceberg offers \"thick\" milkshakes.  I did not realize that \"thick\" meant ice cream in a cup.  I commented to my wife that, when you serve a milk shake without a straw there is a fundamental problem.

The \"regular\" milkshake that I ordered was gigantic and I would not have ordered one that large had I known it would not be a drink.  My wife ordered a \"mini\" and it came out the exact same size as my regular.  We clarified that they had given her a mini and they said that it was.  Her cup was red and mine was blue and her cup was about half-an-inch shorter than mine - but, like I said, her ice cream was as tall as mine so I felt like a chump for paying more.

My chocolate milkshake didn't have much flavor.  I love chocolate milk and when I ordered the shake I was really looking forward to a good chocolaty shake, but it was really just cold with a hint of chocolate.

Iceberg Drive Inn wasn't a bad experience, it just wasn't good enough for me to go back to."}
{"text":"Legit. It's not where you go for the \"best food ever\" and the burgers are just like In and Out basically but their shakes and especially their onion rings are why you come here...also because they serve some of the best fry sauce ever made and if you don't know what that is, it's worth it to come try! You won't overspend here and it's just solid, nothing more or less."}
{"text":"Ordered three kids meals and two #1's.   Took 25 minutes and when I said something they told me there were only 4 people working during the lunch hour.   Avoid this place.   Food was ok."}
{"text":"My kids love this place. The size small is more like 64oz. HUGE PORTIONS. Onion rings are Delish"}
{"text":"I'm updating my prior review from a while back. I have to give this business more stars and credit due to the fact that the people who run it pay attention to these reviews and really care about what the customers think. 
We have not had the food there so this review is about the customer service and the shakes. 
We were comped a few mini shakes and so I got the kids a couple of them. They were better this time around; they got cookie dough and lemon custard flavors. 
The shakes are still way too big and they need to be smaller, and lower the price. That way, a family of four can each get a flavor they want for the same price as two of the huge ones. A mini shake is the length of my forearm and I really don't know who can eat that much ice cream. It seems wasteful but I guess that is their gimmick. 
Good customer service though, and like I said, they care about what we think so I give them points for that."}
{"text":"This is a decent place. Ordered a mini shake and fries with fry sauce (use the yelp check-in offer for free fries!). The fry oil needed to be changed. The shake was delicious - the mini was very large (oh, the irony). Bathrooms weren't the cleanest, staff wasn't the friendliest. The shake was so yummy, though, that Iceberg gets four stars from me!"}
{"text":"Good burger ,The  place seems to be run by high school kids.

Very dirty floors and no one is cleaning the tables or drink area. 

Too bad I won't come back."}
{"text":"I am only giving this establishment 3 stars because although it is good, it isn't what I would call a shake.  They advertise super thick shakes but it is pretty much ice cream in a cup.  They don't even give you a straw, just a spoon.  It didn't even beging to melt after a while.  So, if you like actual milkshakes this isn't the place for you."}
{"text":"The kids love the milkshakes...but the onions rings look much better then they taste. If I could have returned them for my money back I would have the tasted like burnt oil. they prices are a little high too."}
