{"text":"Love this place. Braised beef noodle soup, crispy chicken with lemon sauce. Just shut up and take my money already!"}
{"text":"Slightly below average Chinese food fare.  Extensive choices but not quality you'd be able to brag about.

Sorry to bash but there's better food places around this area."}
{"text":"Talking about extensive choices!! Here at Aroma Delight Palace you can find everything Northern Chinese here and that includes quite a few Korean dishes!

But don't worry, not every single dishes here are spicy just watch for the little chili next to the item.

Lunch Specials that includes soup, pickles and steamed rice are priced at $5.99 and that includes taxes seems like a bargain! But only offers till 3 pm.. and I was out of luck since I having a late late lunch...

Hot and Sour Lamb Noodle Soup ($6.99) is so generous in portion. I can barely finished all the noodle. The lamb is surprisingly tender and just have a touch of cumin to lessen the gamey taste.

I definitely suggest the lunch specials that even includes Gamjatang (Pork Bone Soup)... I will be back!!"}
