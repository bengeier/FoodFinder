{"text":"Love the riverside classic burger! Tasty and juicy with nice beer. Nice staff. Great place!"}
{"text":"A great place to eat! We had the steak special and it was amazing. I would definitely recommend the cozy atmosphere and friendly staff.  We were recommended The Riverside from The Yellow Moose B&B and for sure we are impressed. The bacon wrapped pickles were great and the Caesar Salad was the best I've had in awhile and they know how to put enough bacon on it that's for sure.   5 Stars!"}
{"text":"Used to be \"ok\" now it's just meh. Looks like it could be good from the street - building is well maintained and clean but the food is just mediocre. The Ali's chip truck in coboconk is way better. Lol. And less expensive.   Had the crab cakes (which tasted frozen or canned) and charcuterie board."}
{"text":"Nice and fun stop on the drive home!  Huge portions!  Nothing that compares around.  Wd definitely come again.  Veal sandwich was good.  Maybe a little too dressed.  Curry, butter chicken...reminiscent of mr pataks.  But still great that someone else cooked it!  Chicken parm!  Huge!  Kids chicken fingers great!"}
{"text":"I went the with my family (wife, parents, brothers, cousins, etc) two days ago.  One of my brothers frequents the restaurant when he's at his wife's family cottage.  Such awesome food.  I had the pork schnitzel with mushroom gravy.  Mmmmm good food.  The mashed needed some more salt, but I'll get fries next time as I tasted a sample from my dad's meal and again I'm using the work awesome.  Great atmosphere, great service.  I will definately visit here again."}
{"text":"Well staffed, and professional staff. $15-20 entrees, excellent starter  included. Large portions.  Pizza has good quality cheese, nice and chewy."}
{"text":"Four of us dined at Riverside for a Birthday celebration. Excellent food as always. Riverside is a staple in the neighbourhood, consistent food quality and always willing to please if anything is \"not quite right\".  I would suggest/request that Coca-Cola products replace the \"cheaper\" Pepsi products. Don't know why Coke can't/won't compete with Pepsi at restaurant/bar establishments.  Second, sound levels in the newer dining area are too loud. They need some wall/ceiling treatments to muffle conversations being had."}
{"text":"Very good. The menu is overly vast, which is both good and bad. It's also best to get a reservation as it is so popular. The wine menu and beer selection was also very good. It is a nice addition to the Kawarthas."}
{"text":"Stopped in here a couple times and was pleasantly surprised on how good it was!  Obviously it is now being run by people who like food and offering unique and fresh specials along with standards.  Cozy, good service, good food with lots of ambiance, definately worth stopping in..give them a try!"}
{"text":"Great place to go with family or a date. It's casual and cozy with cottage decor. One of the nicer restaurants in the cottage area to go to with friendly service, hot food easy to drive to and find. Nothing much to see in area, other stores were closed.  Called to make a dinner reservation at 2pm on a random Tuesday, the mature lady sounded really stressed trying to \"squeeze in\" our reservation for 4 +high chair for baby  and asked us to arrive earlier, so we came early before 5. They apparently are always full every night, so you need to make reservations sooner than later. Wasn't a great first impression along with an odd looking website.   But when we arrived after a hard down pour we came to a third full restaurant inside at 4:30pm! It was mainly seniors and my family but it looked way better than their website and the waitresses were very sweet. All tables had reserved signs (so she wasn't kidding earlier) and service was fast at that time. Food came very fast, fresh and hot so my MIL had nothing to complain about!  Didn't have room to try dessert but after hearing coffee wasn't fresh ground drip but the syrup machine kind we grabbed the bill.  Menu is a bit all over the place, can't go wrong with their sandwiches burgers and fish & chips.  Would go back to chill on patio next time"}
{"text":"First time eating here and loved it.  The food was very good, but the decor and vibe was even better -- a very old school, woodsy feel.  I loved the tiny, two seat bar."}
{"text":"For a restaurant that's not a pizzeria, their pizza is excellent! Thick crusted and chewy with an obscene amount of cheese, it's just what I was craving on the long drive back from cottage country. It's quite filling, so one 12 inch pizza will easily feed two, if not three people."}
{"text":"I was hungry and alone. Bored and alone. I waited to sit at the bar and had the steak. Thin but juicy, tasty and cooked exactly like I asked. The fries were fresh cut, the broccoli al dente and the gravy on the side came in a mini steel pitcher. Everything was sizzling hot and my  server Carawas was friendly and totally en Pointe. The meal was very generously portioned and I took half home for lunch tomorrow. Cozy and homey."}
