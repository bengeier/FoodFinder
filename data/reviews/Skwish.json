{"text":"my butter chicken flatbread tasted like tiny chunks of cold chicken in ketchup on toast. my \"large green salad\" was about the size of a tennis ball. seriously I got a LARGE SIDE SALAD and they served it to me on a massive plate when the salad only took up about 1/20th of the space. hopefully nobody drags me to this poorly named restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"We love this place! Back for a second time last night in the past two weeks. Had a great first experience so we decided to go back. It's also nice to bump into friends from the neighborhood when we're there. The atmosphere is cozy and warm, dimmed lights and candles on the table. The staff is awesome, very attentive and friendly. We had the pleasure of having Kaela the rock star take care of us both nights :) We forgot to mention our pine nut allergy before ordering, and the staff made sure to let us know what our entrée contained, just to make sure. A few things we have had to eat was the Curry Chicken lollipops, Goat Cheese Flat bread and the Lardon Poutine. All were very yummy. Looking forward to going back and trying more of their amazing food. We have definitely found our new spot in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"In decline already: Really too bad, because we had high hopes for this new place. We have been four times since it first opened in the summer. The first two, great food and service: The third, the signs were there: appetizers cancelled because they took too long, blank stares from the waitress regarding our drink orders, almost complete staff turnover. The last time, just this week: no acknowledgement of our presence, even on a slow Sunday evening,: a bartender who supposedly doubled as the oyster shucker, but did neither for the time I watched him before cancelling the order: a bill that included a round of drinks we didn't order,  and the oysters we cancelled: and two days to sort out the billing errors. We'll give it some time to right the ship, as the food was very good. I would however give it a pass for a few months, and try it again....if it's still there."}
{"text":"Really great to finally have a good gastropub in the Beach! Terrific food and very reasonable prices. The ambiance and décor are just perfect. Although service was a tad slow due to the restaurant and staff being new (which is totally excusable), our server was very friendly.  The ONLY reason it's not 5 stars is because the \"Craft Beer\" list was disappointing. I think on the menu they meant to write \"draft beer\" since the first item under the words Craft Beer is Budweiser."}
{"text":"We loved it. We had really great service. Two of us had chicken Caesar salads and they were really good - I know it sounds simple but they grilled the lettuce and the seasoning was great on the chicken. I feel like restaurants often have it super bland and I was really happy. The salmon my dad had was great - loved the seasoning and my husband was very happy with his burger. We look forward to coming back and trying more on the menu.  Hope it continues to do well and we look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"Went to skwish on the way to a meeting with a friend, just picked a random spot in the area hoping for something good as we were starving. Well things were looking good quickly when the hostess/server (Stacey) advised us it was happy hour. The house chardonnay was really good and Stacey made my friend an amazing Ceasar. We both ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese and it was incredible! Ask for the amazing bread they make in house to go with it, so yummy. Finished off with a caramel apple cheesecake and thought we died and went to heaven. Great food and Stacey was fabulous...will be going back here for sure!"}
{"text":"Took an Uber all the way there around 10pm and they were closed. Yelp said they were open until 1am. The sign in their window said open until \"late\". Now I'm out $20 from the Uber there and back and eating shitty pizza at home on what was supposed to be date night. Thanks a lot."}
{"text":"I recently experienced an excellent birthday dinner at Skwish on Queen Street. This new restaurant on the Toronto scene is definitely going to go places. The prices are moderate but the food is first rate. I had the heirloom beets as an appetizer. They were amazing, sprinkled with candied walnuts and Gorgonzola cheese. I followed that with the catch of the day which was rainbow trout, decorated with a mixed seafood sauce that melted in the mouth. My companion enjoyed the Pad Thai. Because it was my birthday, they brought out a special dessert for us to share, the name of which I can't remember, but it involved chocolate and we both ate it up wishing for more. One feature I enjoyed about the menu was the wine and beer pairings that were suggested for the mains as well as some of the appetizers. I highly recommend this new restaurant both for a special occasion as well as an impromptu night out. It's worth the drive out to the east end of the Toronto Beaches and I'll be going frequently!"}
{"text":"My wife and I go here regularly since it opened and often bring friends.  We are always impressed by the inventive, fresh, and delicious food and the friendly service.  You can tell that great effort has gone into each component of this restaurant from menu to decor and all the little details that contribute to a great meal.  The draft beer selection is incredible.  I don't know the exact number but it's easily a couple dozen choices including many local craft beers.  The addition of rotating special menus also adds a lot to the variety.  Recommended!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place. I went in when they were having their soft opening because it was so busy and there was such hype surrounding it. I really wanted the Yorkshire pudding appetizer. I was told it was spoiled and they couldn't serve it so I ordered another appetizer. The waitress said she would comp me as the one I wanted wasn't available. She forgot. My dinner companion and I were not overly impressed with the meal. Small portions for a high price. I tried it again a couple more times and both meals were mediocre. The staff/service was very good but I have noticed a high turnover which usually means there is a management problem. I know that this is one of those places that withhold a percentage of tips to pay out the dishwasher, etc. I've never agreed with this. Wait staff don't necessarily make a lot of money so why would an owner take a cut of their tips. I really find this reprehensible. Just pay your staff more don't steal from them. I'll be glad when this is finally illegal, in this province. I have watched the crowds slowly shrink at Skwish. That speaks volumes."}
{"text":"My wife and In have been to skwish twice now and have been disappointed both times. The first time we went for lunch and we had to wait half and hour for our two sandwiches to arrive, and we were the only table in the restaurant.When the food came one of the sandwiches was not what we ordered but we ate it anyway because we had waited so long. The food was good but not worth that kind of wait.  We were back again today for brunch and were really disappointed. Our server was nice both of our teapots had cleaning chemical residue in them which then got into our tea. We order our food and had to wait a really long time for it to arrive and when it did my toast was cold and stale, my onset had the wrong ingredients in it and my wife's eggs benedict were also cold.   We decided to tell our server about the chemical tea and she was very apologetic and said that she would remove to from our bill. When the bill came (again after a long wait) the teas were still on the tab.  The prices are slightly higher than at other local breakfast places, which we wouldn't mind if the food/service was great but unfortunately it isn't."}
{"text":"Totally decent brunch. I had French toast with a side of sausage, hubby had traditional brekky. Both were good, as was the service. Prices were reasonable and they had a pretty large draft list."}
{"text":"Good food for a mid range restaurant with a lot of Korean twists on North American dishes.  Service was comparable to a high end restaurant. I live in the area and will be back. Good beer list."}
{"text":"Meal & wine were absolutely great.  Nan & I loved the food and the atmosphere.     Ask for Kaela great server with passion and knowledge.    Recommend afternoon drinks and snacks or a great meal such as the long rib.  OMG.  Amazing."}
{"text":"Love love love this place !!! Kayla, very  courteous, honest and funny. Atmosphere is great. Food is so good I was literally licking my fingers.   I am very happy this place opened in the beaches . They really care about the quality of food and service , and they really put emphasis on details.  I mean , pineapple and strawberry infused water, come on. And , they have hoegaarden, my favourite beer.  As we were eating , there was a couple looking at the menu, outside, and I literally went to them and told them to come in because food is really , really , really good.  Thank you for opening up great place.  Cristina"}
{"text":"Cozy little place with dollar osyters on Thursdays! Small and quaint. Great spot for a first date or to grab a bevy with a friend. Didn't order food but everything coming out looked great!"}
{"text":"Decided to have dinner here after seeing a movie at The Fox on a Sunday night just a few doors up the street and was not disappointed. The steak salad was excellent, steak perfectly cooked to medium rare and the serving size was perfect for me. My friend had the beef cheek tacos and they were also great. Nice selection of beer on tap and a nice wine (including wine on tap!) and cocktail list. The restaurant was a bit dark and the ambiance was more of a basic pub or chain restaurant) ie. wooden tables with craft paper, but the food made up for it. Prices were very reasonable. Would definitely recommend it and will go again."}
{"text":"The food is ok, not great.  The waitress brought my burger with fries when I had ordered a side salad.  They also gave me the wi-fi password which was incorrect and/or not responding.  I liked the outdoor patio, it was not packed and away from the car fumes."}
{"text":"They've changed their whole menu around so many times since I wrote this, so this may not be relevant anymore.  Overpriced and not that great. Menu says \"Bao BUNS\", plural, not BUN. Yet I paid $12 for one tiny bun and a bunch of sauces (like, FIVE sauces. Am I supposed to put all 5 sauces on my one tiny and already flavoured bun?). Ordered a salad with grilled meat on it and they put the hot grilled meat in the lettuce (not on top or on the side, but mixed in) and then they drenched it in dressing - FOR TAKEOUT. I basically had a warm lettuce stew when I got home (literally across the street). The other items ordered were not memorable or special - but were priced like they would be - and are no longer on the menu.  Really disappointed in what I paid to be underwhelmed and downright annoyed by the lies on the menu."}
{"text":"This was our first time at the newly-opened Skwish. From the moment we crossed the threshold, we were having a good time. All the staff, though new, were eager to please, bright, and engaging. They all tried SUPER hard to listen and to please. This was nice! Skwish has taken over a pub before it, so the furnishings are simple, but they have added some lovely accents in wall art, colour choices and candles. The menu is interesting and varied, with everything from a charcuterie board, mussels, baked brie and Bao buns (SO good) in the appetizer group, to salads, a burger, and a number of mains. We ordered mussels, the phyllo Brie, Bao buns and the charcuterie platter for appetizers, and then moved on to add the long bone short ribs, which were an entree. The food was all beautifully presented and VERY tasty. The chef is to be commended :) We had WAY more food than we needed. The prices are very reasonable for what one receives. To drink, there are wines on tap for $1 an ounce from 5:00-7:00, and we enjoyed several glasses of the red and the white. There was wine and beer, but I am unsure as to whether there is a full bar. We did not have dessert because there was an issue with the coffee machine. No big deal. We did have the pleasure of meeting the owner, Brad, who is very much hands-on. All in all, we really enjoyed our meal at Skwish, we will be back, and we highly recommend you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Pros: the food was good (steak was perfectly cooked), except for the salad, which was drenched in dressing.   Cons: overpriced for what it is, annoying plating (my steak was served on a cutting board--really?), three items we attempted to ordered were not available (we were a table of two), and the service was SLOW, although friendly.   My second try with this place and I really wanted to like it, but both times have been misses."}
{"text":"Based on the limited options on the soft opening menu I can't wait to see the full menu, this limited menu varied from Korean Bao, to steak&frites, with a couple interesting pasta options thrown in for good measure.  Split the burger and Caribbean tacos, the burger was very good, with just enough very real bacon, but it was superseded by the tacos, so nice to have fish/seafood tacos where the fish is not buried in a massive amount of batter, not a bit of batter to be found...  Will definitely be back..."}
{"text":"My mom and I had an early meal last night at Swish. It was my third visit, my mom's first. The first two visits the service was good but the food was just ok. I thought I'd give it one last shot.  We ordered three apps to share.  The grilled calamari that had more onion and olives than it did calamari, a caprese salad made from tomatoes that weren't ripe and mussels, which were in fact were excellent.  After being neglected by our servers the entire meal and having to get up twice and go to the bar to get someone's attention we were told that our one server had just been let go for being inebriated on the job.  We were the only table in there, aside from a few people at the bar. There were three staff plus the owner in sight so I'm not sure why someone else couldn't have picked up our table. We were offered an apology and 15% off our bill. Seriously? After an experience like that I'd expect more of a comp than that. Aside from the horrible service, which may have just been the result of that one very high server, the food stinks.  I was hoping third time was a charm but I'll never go back."}
{"text":"Our fave in the Beach! We've tried similar spots in the area and Skwish just feels like there is some love in their food. Always fresh and tasty, never a complaint about the preparation of their creative menu items. So far we've had the mussels, beef cheek tacos, burgers, stacked nachos with roasted chicken, lobster mac n cheese and blackened steak salad. Still exploring the menu items because I want to try everything! The happy hour is great, too. I don't have kids but I can say that it's very kid friendly. It is a tad on the pricier side, but for a couple of dollars less, I've had mediocre food along that strip, so you're paying for quality and freshness (some people are way too focused on portion size and will eat just about anything if the price is right).   My only complaint is that the dining room lacks a little atmosphere (like just moving the tables at the front of the room sideways would allow your dining companions to also enjoy the outside passing traffic if they choose to look out the window rather than the cavernous room). Too bad they don't have outdoor seating or windows that open for the summer months."}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice, and both meals were incredible, so tasty, it was great to actually get such a flavourful meal.   The first time I had the steak,  the second time the prix fix Christmas menu, which was filet mignon in pastry.   Yes, their prices are high, but if this is the quality you get, and you enjoy the meal as much as I did, then it is worth it."}
{"text":"OMG, awesome food! The prix fix was amazing! The service, top notch. Staff was very attentive and we never were without water at our table or cutlery.  Once again, amazing food and a superior establishment!  A definite gem in the beach! Wish them all the best!"}
{"text":"My first time at this restaurant, what a pleasant surprise. The atmosphere was causal , the bartender Tyler was a very charming person. The food was an absolute delight. I had grilled calamari, which was nice and tender and very savory. A very nice beginning to my meal. I then had the Korean short-rib dinner. The ribs were good, served with rice and peas and Bok choy and a kimchi. Overall a delicate balance of spice and sweet.  The selection of Craft beers makes it a perfect compliment for all the various flavors on the menu."}
{"text":"Visited Skwish on Friday Oct 30 with a party of 8.  The food was ok except for the grilled calamari which was amazing.  I ordered the mussels in a tomato and garlic sauce and there was no sauce at all. I mentioned to my husband that I was very disappointed in my dish and the server overheard me.  She came over and said that she would be disappointed in it too and that we should simply return the dish back.  Not sure why she served it to me in the first place if she felt that it was substandard but that another story. After a long wait which by then most of my party was done with their meal the dish came back.  It was ok and really not comparable to the mussels at The Auld Spot which are to die for!!  Overall experience was just ok and I can say that I will not revisit again!"}
{"text":"The food was OK the first time we went here and the service was nice enough, so decided to give it another shot. But now I think we're done. With all the options in the city, I wouldn't spend another evening here. There was one server working the entire restaurant and the bar. So, needless to say, food and drinks took forever to arrive, and by the time the food got to the table it was cold. But the worst thing was the surprise on the bill at the end -- when ordering we were told that we had a choice of side with each entree, but when the bill came it showed an extra charge of $4 for every side that wasn't fries. When asked why we were being charged the response was \"sorry about that\" ... it's too bad, since this would have been a convenient dinner spot. Oh, well..."}
{"text":"Definitely overpriced!  The restaurant has a personality complex.  Is it high end, a pub, or fast food?  Well, it's like a fast food quality with high end prices run out of an older pub."}
{"text":"Skwish, squish, squash, swish - good luck getting the name right - but you won't go wrong with the food here. We tried the special: double-fried plantain croquettes ($10) and they were awesome. Four crispy croquettes with dots of lime crema and bbq sauce, they we fried to an incredible crisp, with a soft inside and fragrant fresh herbs (tarragon, I think). Our server, a friendly bloke named Jordan, had it right when he gave us this recommendation. I haven't had fried plantains outside Cuba and I was pleasantly surprised. Personally I liked the crema as a sauce, but my date liked the bbq, so we both won. The beef cheek tacos were also delicious. Tender, fall-apart meat, lots of guac and toppings. The only thing is that I would have preferred is if they gave us 3 tacos with less filling in each, as half my taco fell out, and at $14, tossing an extra tortilla in would make it seem like a better value - and easier to eat. Great ambience and staff and a nice spot to grab a $5 point before 6pm. I'd definitely come back, as this place will Skwish the local competition."}
{"text":"Love the Wednesday night dueling pianos at 8pm! Hidden Gem. We had so much fun with my girlfriend. We will be back next week."}
{"text":"Visited Skwish for a date night with the husband. Ordered fish tacos to start, but was brought mixed tacos instead. We were okay with this and dug in. Turns out the fish tacos were our least favourite - the pork belly tacos stole the show, and I would definitely order them again next time. Our waitress noticed the taco mistake a bit later, apologized, and volunteered to adjust our bill (without us complaining). Her service throughout the evening was top notch.  We had steak frites and the braised short ribs for our mains, and both were very good. Both meats were tender and delicious, the sauces were rich with unexpected flavour, and the sides (especially the frites) were definitely not afterthoughts. We devoured everything.  Skwish is a great new date spot in the 'hood - give it a try!"}
{"text":"My friend and I won't be back. The hype was a bit overrated.....not a bad place at all, but here is why we feel this way: The prices were a tad high, not a lot of inexpensive choice on the menu. More diversity would have been good. The service was good however. Atmosphere too. The craft beer list was average and the overall menu depth was lacking. More info is required. Our salads were swimming in dressing. That's a no-no for us. My burger was a tad small, yet the bun was huge. Come on! My friend also felt that his portion of food was a bit on the measly side as well."}
{"text":"Loving this local resto more each time I visit. First suggestion: make a reservation for dinner, at least on Thursday through the weekend.  Met a girlfriend for a 5:30 dinner and we're lucky to get a table.  Being May 5th, Cinco de Mayo was being celebrated with a live band and special menu. Thursdays are also Buck a Shuck Oyster night plus $1 an ounce for house wines. In addition, Margaritas were $5 each.  In addition to oysters, which came beautifully presented with freshly-grated horseradish, pickled red onion and seafood sauce, I chose the warm spinach salad with mushrooms and Gorgonzola. Delectable and very filling. My girlfriend chose the eggplant dish with a side dish of lobster Mac n'Cheese.  Service was outstanding and overall price was more than reasonable.  No wonder this place is so popular! My one suggestion would be to consider adding info on the menu regarding spicy dishes. The Eggplant is apparently quite spicy, which would have been a problem for me had I ordered it."}
{"text":"Perfect in every way! We chose this spot to celebrate our nephew's graduation from WestJet as a brand new flight attendant.  Our party of 6 has been feasting on delicacies like the roasted Caesar Salad, mushroom risotto, beef ribs, steak frites. Everything has been amazing! We were even able to bring a special bottle if wine for a corkage fee of $10."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot! I had the gravlax benny and my boyfriend had the skwish benny, both were awesome! Delicious and not overly heavy... and they both came with salad and potatoes. Service and atmosphere were also great and fast! Not sure why this place isn't busier... You don't have to wait in line like the many other brunch spots in Leslieville, and I found this food to be better than the ones with the long wait! Try this place!"}
{"text":"You just can't go wrong with the Beach restaurant.  From food, to service, to atmosphere.  They get it all right!"}
{"text":"Second time here and it was busy! Came here for brunch but they were closed. Service is wonderful, but in busy times it can take a bit longer to get some attention. They have a wonderful selection of beer on tap. Many of the staff seems new, so don't be a beach nob. Patience and friendliness."}
{"text":"I finally tried skwish at dinner time Wednesday after having it on my list for at least a year. I wasn't disappointed. Space is large with bar seating and tables. Specials change daily with Wednesday focused on wine so I had a glass. Service was a bit slow but not overly. Food was great; Asian tuna tartar and Caesar salad. I would get both again! Perfect meal and filling. In the future I might try their risotto or mac and cheese or Taco special or oyster Thursdays. It is great to have Skwish in the beach. I will return for another meal sometime in the new year."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Skwish for brunch on a Sunday. We tried lunch at their original location by the beaches area.   We had their traditional breaky, and 3 eggs omelette with cheese. The tastes of both the dishes were ok, and the presentation was not inspiring. The service was alright.  If you're looking for brunch with similar price point, but with better tasting dishes and presentation. There are many more options in the area. Even the one next door is better in quality, taste and presentation."}
{"text":"The overly relaxed vibe has a pub sort of feel with a hint of wanting to be up scale, but fail. I arrived with two friends not sure whether to seat myself or wait as we waited to be greeted when it wasn't busy kinda left me wondering this place is new and should be upping their game and be ON! After a few  the pleasant waitress greeted us and asked us to sit anywhere. We chose to sit at the back so we can take it all in. She brought us cold water that was refreshing but tasted like frost bitten ice cubes that melted in the water. Ordered apparently the best burger in leslieville NOT don't be fooled especially if you like pickles the only pickle you'll be holding is your own or that of your boyfriends. And to be told the chef doesn't do pickles was basically saying your the customer yes but you can't have your burger but not  the way you want it. Instead pile on the Dill aioli that made my bun soggy . The bright side the fries were golden crispy and piping hot !  I personally think this place is over priced and trying too hard , $14 for two tacos ?? Really ?? Pub food overly priced wanting to be gourmet lacking the attentiveness and all the added little extras that make a good dining experience great. Im a leslieville resident and another dissapointing establishment in that space  . I'll go to Wendy's two blocks away where the burgers are square and they have pickles better yet I'll have extra pickles!"}
{"text":"Wandered in just hours after they opened and with only one server, they were apologetic from the get go and warned us it was a soft opening. We were very pleased!! The squid was so delicious and had such a different twist with the Olive sauce, my burger was the BOMB and the salad was lovely. Our server was just a Pistol of a gal, so charming. gave them our feedback. Made my way over a week later and HALLELUJAH, the place was HOPPING. We were very pleased yet again. I had the Arctic Char, grilled just perfect, ( the risotto a tad too salty but they welcomed the criticism) and the service and the ambiance was great. The joviality of the energy reminded me of The Nose in Leslieville. Finally, it looks like we're gonna get our own groovy Beach version of that kind of place. Once they iron out the bugs and maybe implement a live music or DJ feature on some nights it'll be a great new choice for Beachers to hit. Let's cross our fingers!"}
