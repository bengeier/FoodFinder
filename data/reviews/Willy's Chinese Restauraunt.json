{"text":"Good food overall. Spicy and unique tasting dishes like fried beef, hot and sour soup, chilly chicken, chow mein, singapore noodles, wings etc. Atmosphere  can be quiet... Food makes u mwant to go back. Find service good. Price can add up almost to cost at mandarin per person."}
{"text":"First, the place appears to be clean and the service is good.  English is well spoken. Good food for the most part.  Some of the dishes have too much sauce, like the Kung Po chicken, but you can ask for less sauce.  Loved the Chow Mein and the Chop Suey.  The food quality is average.   Overall a reasonable place, with a 10% discount if you pay cash."}
{"text":"Always running back, Manchurian fried rice, chilli chicken dry, chicken and shrimp pakora... The owner is a good man."}
{"text":"Yuck worst food ever. Every time I have ate food from here I have gotten sick. I get stomach aches and sometimes get nauseated by the food. The food is just filled with huge amount of sauce and so you can only taste the sauce and the meat is very chewy. Avoid this place if you don't cases of diarrhea and nausea. Also the food is not cheap for the quantity of food you get, so wondering why the quality of the food is so bad."}
{"text":"Great Food, kudos to Willy for always giving out consistent great food.. been a loyal customer for years."}
{"text":"My fav Chinese food in Richmond Hill. Service is excellent price reasonable. Only downfall no delivery."}
{"text":"Excellent food, owner is very attentive with the orders, they takes orders over the phone and  packs it nicely. CRISPY BEEF with house special fried rice the best, highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great service and the food is best Chinese since China town in Montreal I love their menu, great selection and very decent prices, the hot and sour soup is sooooo spicy but I love it. We will definitely be back for more"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for Chinese and I read the reviews on yelp it was close enough to where I live that I didn't mind going to try it for take out. The place is simple but clean. The gentleman spoke English very well and was super helpful. As I am vegetarian he made sure my food was so. I waited about 10 minutes maybe 15. The food was hot and the bag felt heavy so I knew they had good portions. I ordered the spicy green beans and the the Cantonese chowmein. Both were very well done. I will definitely go back again whenever I have a craving for Chinese."}
{"text":"the food here is sooo gross. the fried rice smells off. the chili chicken and sweet and sour chicken is full of fat, bone and cartilage. the sauce for both those dishes are goopy and gross. this place has potential but they really need to put quality into their recipes. i wont eat here again. last time i ate from this restaurant, i ended up throwing out what was on my plate about a few bites."}
{"text":"I've been here when it's empty and when it's packed and the service has always been great. This is one reason that kept me coming back. That and its conveniently located near Yonge & Elgin Mills which was like my second home for a while.  The restaurant is clean and there's ample seating for most days/nights. Sometimes it gets packed when there are big parties however for the most part its not bad. Both the dine in and take out service is good, and its worthwhile to note that a lot of orders from Willy's are in fact take out orders.  Willy's says Chinese however they in fact serve hakka cuisine. The food is decent, I've ordered take out from here so many times, and dined in about 8-10 times. However lately some of the food doesn't sit well with me and this may be due to some ingredient changes or perhaps it's just me. Now I can't eat Willy's crispy beef... WTF. That was my favourite dish. However other dishes that I like from Willy's are chilli chicken, beef with black bean sauce, veg chow mein, sweet and sour chicken balls, chicken corn soup (or hot and sour soup), and chicken/beef/shrimp fried rice (pretty much what I order at Frederick's or Tangerine).  Willy himself is a chill guy. If you have any issues, ask to speak to him. However I've seen him get a little annoyed with the non/low tippers."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the food at Willys! Very spicy authentic Hakka, something I truly miss and crave for in Montreal.  The owner has been working there for years but is a very genuine and lovely guy who puts in 100% effort into the quality of the food.  I always have a hard time deciding what to order as there is so much to choose from and everything sounds delicious! This time round I went for spicy beef chow mein which again was too good and the portion size was huge (enough for two definitely). It doesn't look like a great place from the outside and very simple interior but it has to be my favourite Hakka chinese in GTA! Highly highly recommend"}
{"text":"Had the individual special, chili chicken with rice, and spring roll for 7.95 (pretty decent!!!) but I asked for fried rice for an extra 2.50.  flavourful huge portion for a great price.   Thanks Willy!!"}
{"text":"For fast Chinese food it's pretty good! I called one day for take out asked them what should I order cause I wanted to try something different this time. The guy on the phone recommended ginger beef! When at first I was like GINGER!! I am not a ginger lover.  But I said yes anyways and man was it delicious sooooo delicious. He has some really good dishes the chicken balls coming from an Asian lol they are really tasty. Fried calamari on the greasy side but still flavourful Rice noodle dishes yum! Rice is ur typical Chinese take out counter fried rice. Chilli chicken dry they do an awesome job on!  They don't deliver which sucks but they do do take out! :)"}
{"text":"Good for takeout and the chicken pakoras is a must.  Indo-chinese place."}
{"text":"Typical Hakka cuisine. It's not bad but the quality of ingredients isn't the greatest. The chicken tends to be a little fatty, and all the dishes are slightly oily, which kind of makes you feel like you've eaten a cannonball. That being said, the food sure tastes good and there's quite a bit to choose from. The lunch specials are a pretty good deal, but mostly rice. Not a bad place to get some Hakka food if you don't feel like venturing out of the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Willy's is a hidden gem. Not too busy on a weekday for lunch, but the food has great value and taste.  The service is quite fast as well. I'd definitely recommend the lunch specials or take out. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Had the Chilli Chicken and Crispy Ginger Beef for lunch today and my friend had the general Tao chicken. Portions are large and everything was great. Will definitely be back to try different menu items. One of the better Hakka places I've visited in the area."}
{"text":"Picked up some take out for lunch at the office.  Got a rice, a noodle, chicken and beef..... more than enough food for 4 people.  The food was super fresh and delicious.  It was just the right amount of spicy.  Good enough to add flavor, but not hot enough to hurt.  I'd go back without any hesitation."}
