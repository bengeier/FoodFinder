{"text":"I have eaten pizza here twice. It's good restaurant with fun decor. 

The food last night was decent, but I do think I could have made it at home with Jamie Oliver's Italian cook book. It's not too expensive, however, so long as you moderate your alcohol, which justifies going there. It can also be fun, with the nod to the retro decor and interesting hipster patrons an staff. Our hostess was great and the waitress not so good (didn't ask how things were until the meal was almost done, didn't ask me if I wanted another drink, etc.). 

The rustic style pizzas do remind me more of true Italian pizza than one would normally expect of a North American pizza joint. The name Magpie, after the bird, is a very commonwealth reference, which may seem odd at first. It is, however, one of a number of restaurants with British references that have opened in the past year or so in Montreal: e.g. Sparrow, Lawrence, Brit & Chips, the Burgundy Lion, etc. 

All in all, I will go back, but with moderate expectations."}
{"text":"I was initially excited to come here and try something new. However the service was TERRIBLE and the food too other than the pizza. 
They messed up our order and we waited 40 minutes for oysters (.... They're raw), another 30-40 minutes for the salad, and then another 45 minutes for the pizza. 
The salad was miserable. I actually told my boyfriend that the chef should be ashamed of this creation. It had no flavor and the poached egg was overcooked and dry. 
The waitress offered us drinks to compensate for our wait. Which we initially took as a kind gesture. Only to find out that they charged us for the drinks at the end of the meal!!
There are so many more amazing places for pizza in Montreal... Please save yourself the disappointment and go somewhere else. (Pizzeria napoletana/Gepetto/Tomato/Prato/pizzaiolle)"}
{"text":"I used to love Magpie but the last two times I've been there it just hasn't been the same. The pizza is way too salty. Most of my party agreed but that wasn't the worst of it. The service was so bad, it really put a damper on the evening. Our waitress brought us our food and then we never saw her again. She never once came by to check on us. It took way too much time and effort to wave her over so we could order some dessert. Once again she brought the dessert and left us never to return. We finally had it, put on our coats and went to the cash to pay. This has happened to us twice now. Don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"It's often the simple things that are hardest to make. This place uses San Marzano tomatoes exclusively in their sauce - which produces a distinctive sweet flavor in their pies. Pizzeria Magpie has a slim menu, but the few things they do, they do very well. Enhancing the natural flavors of their products, the element of a wood-fired oven is thrown into the equation for bonus points."}
{"text":"Love the space, love the service, love the music. The wine list is short but all are offered by the glass. Pizzas are wonderfully full flavoured. I just wish they'd spread the garnishes more widely instead of concentrating them all in the centre. Divine brownie for dessert."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Montreal! And who can say no to a Pimms cup? One of my favorite cozy places to go."}
{"text":"J'ai commandé la fameuse Calzone à la viande. La saveur était excelente mais le centre et le fromage pas fondu. Dommage dans cela ça aurait été parfait."}
{"text":"How could a place that cooks such amazing pizza turn into such a sad state of affairs?? You go to a restaurant to hopefully feel the same or better than when you came in. Since they opened, I've consistently gotten some of Montreal's best pizza here. But the culture of the business is a best a bad joke. The front end staff are beyond unpleasant. A vending machine where you punch in your order would leave a more positive impression. But yet the front-end staff feel they can be mean, arrogant and frankly small town pretentious. Despite all this, the pizza is great enough that I'd struggle through these people to get what is coming out of the oven."}
{"text":"The meatballs were amazing and the daily special was trout tartar which was fantastic. Atmosphere was great and the waiter / bartender was wonderful. I really can't say enough good things..."}
{"text":"Going there for good times and told we're noisy and my Mexican friends are too drunk to be served, while they weren't is totally inappropriate. Bad and snobby service."}
{"text":"Maybe this is the best pizza in Montreal but not the best I ate in my life.
I was a bit disppointed with Montreal pizza scene, I tried Bottega and Napoletana and Magpie is much better but not superb!!!"}
{"text":"Everything from the decor, to the vibe, to the pizzas is top notch. The menu consists of several solid thin crust Neapolitan-style staples updated weekly by interesting specials that make coming back to this restaurant always fresh. Had a tex-mex pizza one time with spiced beef, coriander, confited tomatoes, and a balsamic reduction that was flavourfully sweet, spicy, and simply delicious. One of the first restaurants to serve oysters before it became trendy, they have a decent mix of mollusks from around North America. The charcuterie is solid but a tad unspectacular. My favourite item was bread sticks with a mildly spicy garlic aioli and roasted artichokes but alas it's no longer served because its popularity was eating up too much of the pizza dough. 
My only complaints would be that that the pizza quality declines slightly when the owner isn't slinging them; I find the cornicione too fat and the centres too soggy. Also, it's not the cheapest restaurant though my final bill reflects more my desire to eat everything on the menu rather than a lack of value for money. As far as pizza joints go in Montreal, Magpie is at or near the top."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Pizzeria in Montreal. Don't even hesitate let alone think of going elsewhere. The staff is absolutely awesome, The vibe is unique, and no other pizza comes anywhere close! Discovered this place just over two years ago, and we've been there more times than I can count. WARNING: This pizza is highly addictive! 
ps: Did I mention, the staff are ALL absolutely AWESOME !
pps: you need to reserve, cuz many many others agree!
;)"}
{"text":"Pizza for me is defined by the crust and the tomato sauce.  This place is terrific on both fronts. Add some chili oil to Magpie's standard Margarita pizza and the combination can possibly make a person do the happy food dance in their chair.  

The menu is straight forward, and Magpie has never failed to deliver tasty goodness in any of the dishes we have ordered (salads, daily specials, pizza etc.).  Their specialties are of course the wood burning oven cooked pizzas. From the basic Margarita (a go to favourite) to the fennel sausage with peppers and onions, they all hit the mark.  The pizza crust here is thin on the bottom and thick on the sides, but the thick part has a delightful thin crisp on the outside and pully dough effect in the middle that makes it wonderful in taste and texture.  So if you're a thick crust, deep-dish pizza lover, this may not be your favourite ... although Magpie might just swing you over to the thin crust dark side.

The atmosphere is lively and fun.  I would suggest making reservations if you want to eat prime time (6:30 - 9:00PM) Th-Sat and just in case, I'd make reservations if you want to eat in the same time period on other days, although you may get a seat just walking in.

Oh yeah and don't forget the chili oil - mmmm the chili oil."}
{"text":"Good thin crust traditional pizza is very hard to find in Montreal, everyone raves about Bottega but I've been a couple of times and was underwhelmed each time, and I've tried all the others.. Magpie opened last September and I've been twice now, in NYC or Boston this wouldn't make anyones top 30 list, but in Montreal it's probably the best I've had. They have a beautiful oven, the sauce is tasty.. my only peeve was one time I ordered a pepperoni mozzarella and there was way too much pepperoni on it, big long pieces like a Pendeli's pizza where they slather on toppings without a second thought. A good pizza shouldn't be overwhelmed by any one topping, if anyone at Magpie is reading this, cut back on the pepperoni, 4-5 small round pieces per slice would be a much better amount.. not 10 giant strips.."}
{"text":"I had dinner here last night with few friends. Wasn't impressed by my pizza (Bianca) since about a third of it was burnt. Plus, I'm not a big fan of dill which they put on the pizza, although my friends liked the addition.
The staff was very nice and the service was good.
Overall, it was an okay meal, but not my best pizza experience."}
{"text":"\"The short winter's day was drawing to a close. It seems to me sometimes that these are the only days I have ever known, and especially that most charming moment of all, just before night wipes them out.\"


first time trying magpie, ordered a margherita pizza for takeout,  entered the cozy confines and a waitress at the bar promptly noticed a patron looking dazed and confused so she greeted me and gave me a menu to gloss over. while propped up at the bar,  another waiter asked me if i wanted a glass of water while i waited for the dough to become pizza. standard things are often overlooked so i appreciated the attentiveness given for a mere take out order on a very busy saturday evening, i would fancy they're just as good in full sit-down mode. if you like bustling places/people packed in like sardines, you'll like it here, however if you're a little claustrophobic or prefer quieter quarters while having lunch/dinner, i'd recommend a weekday or afternoon.

on to the pizza - really loved the sauce and crust (though slightly thicker than i had hoped for), and you can taste the quality of the ingredients, but it felt like they were too generous with the olive oil and too frugal with the basil/bocconcini, all too often (like over 1/2  the time ), my bites consisted of just bread and tomato sauce. some of the time i was eating a great margherita pizza, a good deal of the time i was eating a marinara sauce pizza, which wasn't what i ordered. 

4 sprigs of basil attempting to be strategically placed around the center and bocconcini that needed two dollops per quadrant instead of one for a premium price  ($14.95 taxes in, cheapest on the menu) may get you capital punishment in some other countries. okay, maybe a  slightly less severe sentence, but i seek swift justice for all those 'just sauce' bites!"}
{"text":"Food 3 / 5 staff&service 4 / 5 decor 3 / 5 
I suggest reserving the place if you intend on going past 8pm on a Friday or Saturday. It gets packed quickly. 

1.Magpie Margarita pizza 13$
2.Pepperoni pizza 15$
3.Limonata Smash cocktail 8$
4.Magpie Caesar, Regular 9$ (add 3$ for an oyster)

Total bill with tip was about 55$. Since our waiter quickly came over to take our orders, we asked him for a bit more time, the 4 stars for service was because he came back a good 15 minutes later. Other than that our drinks and food came pretty quickly, despite the full house they had. We thought the tomatoe sauce was a bit bland, and the crust got soggy quickly. Also, my Caesar came warm so I had to wait a few minutes to cool in the ice after stiring it."}
{"text":"Very good the pizza, with Bottega and Arlequino is one of the best pizzeria in Mtl. Or at least one of the most similar to the real Italian pizza. The place is a bit small, better to reserve. 
Ps. The fifth star of the rating is also due to the Montenegro, one of the few places that have it!!!"}
{"text":"Super super super nous venons de Nice en France ( coller à l Italie ) et j peux vous dire que en Italie les pizza sont pas si bonne donc félicitation et la sérveuse une merveille merci à vous changer rien :)"}
{"text":"Food was nice- salad mediocre.  It was expensive as heck though so minus one star."}
{"text":"I had a méditerranéenne pizza which was great and lobster ravioli side dish which was incredible!"}
{"text":"The few times I've been here I've had excellent service, enjoyed the music and the atmosphere, and most of all the food.

The breadsticks are to die for, and come with a side of artichoke hearts in balsamic, as well as an awesome aoli-type sauce.

The pizzas are quite big for one person unless you're pretty hungry.

Ask about the pizza of the week -- it is likely going to be amazing too!

Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"Had a lovely, leisurely lunch at Magpie, and enjoyed great pizza and charcuterie.  Wine list is short but sweet.  Great respite from all the foie gras and duck I had over the weekend."}
{"text":"Came to Magpie with great expectations but no reservation.
Time was around 6 PM the restaurant was relatively empty, even so, we were sent to the bar. Several minutes later after I had received my thimble size glass of wine for $9.50, another couple came in who had no reservations--yet were seated at a table in the relatively open restaurant.  I removed 2 stars just for the ineffective table management (yes, I know it's always best to have a reservation)

Pizza -   was delivered fairly promptly with tasty sauce. There is nothing like a true Wood-fire oven for Pizza, and Magpie has one.   I chose the margarita pizza with added anchovies and a handful of rocket greens on top.  the pizza was good but the crust was not quite as good as what I found at Bottega - in little Italy.  The hipster setting of Mile End is what it is and the staff were nice. For me still, the best real- Italian pizza experience is at  Bottega. I find them to be the winner.  Value for Money was not there with Magpie.  Wine / cocktails were way over priced for what you get, however the mixed cocktails were well put together."}
{"text":"One of the many good restaurants in mile-end. Went there with colleagues after a team building activity. It has nice vibe and good good. I really enjoyed their ginger soda, especially soothing since I have a cold. Pizzas are good too. I shared with my colleague the margherita and pepperoni pizzas. Two very simple flavors yet surprisingly good. Delicious thin pizza dough with a crispy crust. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Loved this pizza! We did carry out and brought it back to eat.  Easy to order on the phone and the spoke English.  Great pizza."}
{"text":"Bof - le pizza average et les pâtes - plate du jour déprimée ..

Very average pizza - comparable to a frozen supermarket pizza and the special of the day pasta was very sad - entrée size and bland .

Never again"}
{"text":"Great, friendly service! The pizzas and the drinks are amazing. Cosy place and when there's a DJ the music is really good. Only negative thing is the price which can be a bit expensive. Happy hour on Thursdays is a must!"}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent and the lemon tart was amazing, but the service was a bit slow and unresponsive given how quiet the restaurant was."}
{"text":"Pizza is good but a little overrated. La pizza est bonne mais un peu sue-évaluée. Le vin au verre est cher. Wine by glass is expensive."}
{"text":"Nourriture fade, sans sel, sans poivre, sans herbes, sans épices, sans huile d'olive. Nous étions en groupe et ce fut l'opinion de la plupart d'entre nous. J'ai voyagé en Italie où l'on mange de la \"vraie\" nourriture italienne. Et ce n'est certainement pas ça. Le décor est agréable et le service courtois. Je ne pense pas y retourner."}
{"text":"Came to the Amherst location on a date on a Saturday evening at 7pm. We were super lucky to find parking on the next block. We can see the Jacques Cartier bridge pretty well from this area. No waiting in line, we just sat at any table. I like the decor of this place, it's one of those places where you look around since there is so much to take in. The crowd was stylish and casual, there were a few larger groups. This place has the wood burning oven so every pie that comes out is cooked to perfection. We each had a Margherita pizza, I had meat balls with Español sauce, he had 6 oysters from New Brunswick. The pizza is a size good portion, the dough is fluffy and airy. It's fhe kind of pizza you would find in Italy. There was tons of cheese and 4 cloves of basil, tomato sauce. I'm a huge fan of thinner crust pizzas so you can actually taste the doughs and all the flavors. Thicker dough just masks the ingredients. Prices are responsible and fair. Our waitress was attentive and polite. I'd definitely go back to try another pizza or two."}
{"text":"Oh my god, I' can't believe that I haven't written a review for Magpie already! Magpie has been in my regular restaurant rotation for years now and I love it! There is no better place in town for a thin crust wood oven cooked pizza. 

My go to is the Margarita pizza. Good pizza should be simple so that you can enjoy the great flavour of the buffalo mozzarella and the tomato sauce. Magpie's Margarita delivers on all counts. If you are in the mood for something more meaty and heavy I would recommend the Pepperoni pizza. The pepperoni itself is excellent quality, not the typical low quality stuff you normally find on pizza, and the amount that you will find on your pizza is very generous. 

I also highly recommend the Caesar salad and a selection of fresh oysters are always available. Oh, and don't forget to try their homemade ginger-ale!"}
{"text":"Short yet fantastic menu, Magpie knows what they are good at and make sure you get a slice of the goodness. They have a wood-burning oven that makes for the best pizza in town. Special mention to the caesar salad which is a must-have!

We had the smoked meat pizza with mustard seeds and dill, the meatball and mushroom pie, and the classic prosciutto and arugula pizza. They were all delicious in their own way: the brisket is braised and pulled which makes for a delicious and unique bite, the meatball is hearty and delicious, and the prosciutto pie is fresh and tomato-y all at once. 

Tip: This place gets pretty busy, so make sure you call ahead."}
{"text":"Must have meatball pizza next time or an extra serving of meat portion they are a bit light on that, at least for my manly taste buds. In general the pizza is exceptional and memorable."}
{"text":"Went here with two friends back in May. We all had pizzas, I had the one with prosciutto and arugula (one of my faves) which was delicious. I loved that the pizza dough was thin but with a nice crust at the end and the ingredients were very fresh.

We also ordered drinks which were below average. My friend's Aperol Spritz consisted mostly of ice and was served in a small tumbler and my drink wasn't what I was expecting (maybe I had heard wrong the full description of the ingredients in my drink?). Best to go with a glass of wine.

{"text":"Quick summary: 

Cocktails were great

Pizza was great, hard to go wrong with a wood stove oven! 

Dessert: had the brownie with ice cream and fruit, found the fruit sauce a little over powering but it was ok 

Service: service was friendly though a little slow and unsynchronized at times. Dessert and coffee was delivered over a 10 minute period and in no particular order amongst the 3 couples.

Overall: I would recommend this place for pizza and cocktails, skip the dessert and be proactive with your waiter"}
{"text":"I love Magpie. Great ambiance (cozy, romantic, vibrant), attentive and knowledgable staff and most importantly, amazing food. Not your \"the bigger the better\" type of place, magpie pays attention to taste first and foremost. The oysters are a must- the raw horseradish as garnish is genius! And the pizzas have just the right ratio of oil/cheese/toppings/dough. Recommended for dates or a place to bring your parents."}
{"text":"All we wanted was to spend some time with our significant other and enjoy cocktails, delish entrees and a few (actually 5!) good pizza ...indeed we did have the above, but dear God, such poor service!!! 

I'm not even joking, the waitress was high. Serious. So spaced out!!! As soon as we ordered...she would forget...we had to ask for our drinks all night long! 

Moreover (and especially that) patrons were rude and loud! Let's be honest kinda losers and poorly dressed. Who lets these people in anyway....some of the patrons seemed to be friends with the staff...perhaps there is the answer. 

The table besides ours these two j*rk were just shouting, trying to get attention or something, all night long. Dudes...stick with your ugly gf, will u. As if...

This is where the manager (or reasonable facsimile) must take charge, grow a pair and discipline not only the staff, but also j*rk patrons!

Sadly, the manger and staff last night (a Saturday night of all nights, with the place full) failed miserably!! 

The owners must share also this fiasco. 

They hired the staff...and if they were there (which they should, on a Saturday night, and obviously were not proactive) then they don't care for the place...so why would quality patrons care to go back????!!! Not going to happen!

Weren't for the food we would never go back....should we give this place a second chance, it's not going to be anytime soon!! 

Should the manager and staff been capable, we would have given this place 4 stars. 

Good food without quality execution and proper setting = disaster."}
{"text":"La pizzeria Magpie : un petit restaurant parfait où déguster une savoureuse pizza! 
J'y suis allée par un très froid vendredi soir cet hiver. Quel plaisir d'entrer dans un restaurant aussi chaleureux par une température aussi froide! 

Comme le nom le dit, il s'agit d'une pizzeria. En plus de quelques délicieuses entrées (huîtres, salades, raviolis...), on y offre évidemment un bon choix de pizzas variées, allant de la plus simple à la plus surprenante. Elles sont faites sur place avec des ingrédients hyper frais, miam! La mienne était excellente et cuite à la perfection. Chaque semaine, une nouvelle entrée, une nouvelle pizza et un nouveau dessert sont inscrits à l'ardoise, il est donc possible de faire des découvertes différentes selon la semaine. Quelques desserts très simples, mais efficaces et savoureux sont offerts. Une sélection de vins d'importations privées est également disponible. 

Le service est génial; tous les employés sont sympathiques et souriants. Les plats arrivent dans des délais plus que raisonnables, même si l'endroit est bondé de clients. Les prix sont très corrects aussi. 

J'y retournerai certainement bientôt!

***Prévoyez de l'argent comptant ou une carte de crédit, car le restaurant n'accepte pas les cartes de débit!"}
{"text":"Je suis allée à cette \" nouvelle \" succursale de Magpie de la rue Amherst à l'occasion de mon anniversaire cette année. J'avais quelques appréhensions vu les commentaires que j'avais lus ici (même si je me disais ben voyons, pourtant tout est correct à la succursale du Mile End), mais finalement, tout s'est bien passé!

La pizzeria de la rue Amherst est plus grande que l'autre et ça, c'est très bien. Fini l'impression de manger avec son voisin! Nous étions 14 personnes et avons eu droit à une belle grande table au fond du resto, qui était tranquille ce soir là, alors c'était parfait. Notre serveur était ADORABLE. Explications pour le menu, l'ardoise, les cocktails, etc. Il prenait plaisir à nous faire des recommandations et il était content d'être là. Super service! Il est vite venu prendre nos commandes de boissons, puis notre commande de nourriture. Tout a été prêt assez rapidement. Tout le monde était très satisfait de ce qu'il avait commandé.

Chez Magpie, vous pourrez choisir parmi les entrées et les plats du menu, mais aussi parmi ceux ajoutés à l'ardoise (en plus ces plats changent souvent... yahou!). Ils ont une assez bonne liste de vins à prix variés, mais aussi quelques cocktails sur le menu. Vu leur taille, les pizzas peuvent facilement être partagées par deux personne qui n'ont pas un grand appétit!"}
{"text":"Not a bad spot to grab a pizza if you're in the area. For some reason I decided to try a smoked meat, dill and mustard pizza they seem to have recently added to the menu. It was a bit of a mess flavor-wise, but I give them full marks for creativity. My wife tried the Magpie Margherita and it was excellent."}
{"text":"Magpie is a great little Pizzeria located on MaGuire just above fairmount

To begin their MagPie Bloody Caesar is amazing
I started with their meatballs and Caesar Salad, again both were really good

Their Pizzas are HUGE 1 is enough for 2 people, the ingredients are fresh and delicious, I had Prosciutto it was delicious

Prices are reasonable but space is limited so get there early or make reservations"}
{"text":"Came here with my friend on a busy Saturday night, they seated us by the bar and we were lucky to have the nicest server. He was so accommodating and helpful, recommended various options and answered all my questions. 

To start, we ordered half a dozen east coast oysters (from New Brunswick and PEI). They were really mild in taste and easy on their way down- just how I like it. For my pizza, I wasn't sure whether to order the prosciutto or sausage, but I ended up going with the prosciutto and loved it. My friend got the poutine pizza and found it a little too salty due to the gravy, but was satisfied with her choice overall. We shared a bottle of pinot noir and were pleased to hear that our server wanted to treat us to a digestif.

It was a wonderful evening and I'll definitely be back to try other items on the menu, everything looked great."}
{"text":"Une des 3 meilleures place de pizza a montréal! Réservation 4h a l'avance minimum. Toujours tres difficile d'avoir une place.

Serveurs tres sympatiques. Offrent les huitres aussi. Pas cher."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza in a cute neighborhood joint.  We ordered the endive salad, 6 of their daily special oysters and goat cheese, jamon pizza.  Don't forget the spicy oil!! It takes the pizza to a whole other level.  They have a small selection of beers.

The staff is extra accommodating with young kids.  So if you need a baby friendly place, you should definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great pies. This was my last food stop in Montreal while visiting and it was probably the best meal I had the entire time. I am a huge fan of pizza, though, so maybe I'm a little biased. At an rate, the wildfired thin crust pizzas and perfectly balanced with cheese sauce and toppings. It came with a little spicy oil which I loved.  I would return here in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"This joint is hoppin' between 6-8pm, even on weeknights, so think about reserving.

Atmosphere is family friendly (saw 2-3 toddlers) and busy.

PIzzas are more traditional style Italian, very thin crust, slightly burnt on the edges (this is a good sign) coming from a custom built pizza oven (doesn't smell wood fired).

Base ingredients (tomato, flour, oliver oil) as listed on site apparently all come from Italy.  The Antimo Caputo flour is extra fine ground, which perhaps helps the texture of the dough & crust 

I ordered the Saucisse au Fenouil, a tasty mix of fennel sausage, onions, bell peppers and the sausage quality was excellent.

A caramelized onion, black olive, cottage cheese, oregano pizza came with healthy smattering of onion and cottage cheese dollops in four sections.

The pizzas are typically quite moist when delivered and there's perhaps of a drizzle of olive oil behind the scenes before delivery.  The crust isn't crispy, neither underneath the toppings nor around the outer edge.  This is not a downgrade, just a note to give an idea of texture.  I prefer a slightly less chewy, lighter, more yeasty flavored dough, but this is just personal preference.

I'll definitely be back when I'm feeling the need for pizza."}
{"text":"La première fois que j'y suis allée, j'étais éblouie!! J'avais enfin trouvé LA place où l'on fait LA meilleure pizza! Donc depuis, j'y retourne fréquemment parce que je ressens le devoir de faire découvrir ma nouvelle place à pizz, à chacun de mes amis
. 
Après quelques visites par contre, mon enthousiasme du départ s'est un peu atténué. La dernière fois, j'ai choisi une pizza au fromage et artichauts qui j'avoue, m'a un peu laissé sur mon appétit. Puis, le Ceaser qui m'avait complètement séduite la fois d'avant était, cette fois-là, vraiment mal assaisonné. 

MAIS je dois absolument mentionner que la pizza méditerranéenne... WOW! Elle est incroyablement bonne. Les aliments sont frais et le mélange de saveur est parfait! Tomates cerises...herbes fraîches, mais surtout (quelque chose que je n'aurais jamais pensé mettre sur une pizza) des concombres marinés! Le tout donne un goût qui est vraiment intéressant!

Quant au service, il est très bien. Une fois, une erreur s'est produite dans notre commande ce qui a fait augmenter notre temps d'attente, mais pour nous dédommager notre serveur nous a offert 2 autres généreux verres de vin. Très bon truc je dois dire, je ne me souviens presque plus d'avoir attendu ;) !

Pour ce qui est des prix, ils sont très très raisonnables. 

Évidemment, je recommande ce restaurant. J'y retourne prochainement sans faute!"}
{"text":"5 pm for dinner but no line. I like this place alreay. The server is nice amd friendly and we ordered margarita pizza. Dought not crusty like typical NY pizza however the dough is tasty and subtle with lite sauce. The mozzarella chesse could be a little more tastier. Eat it while is hot. Not alot of space for family with kids"}
{"text":"Les Pizza sont excellente mais un peu chere tout de même. 
Un service impeccable. Le cadre est très agréable aussi"}
{"text":"So I've been to Magpie twice now. The second time was much better. I started off with a classy bloody ceasar, followed by a nice itslian wine. The pizza was lovely. Just the right thickness of dough and delicious toppings. Unless you're starving the pizza is big enough to satisfy a healthy appetite, unless there's an XXL tag in your shirt!

I will go back myself, and you should probably try it too. 

I did like the feel and look of the place. I would call it casually cool. This isn't a big restaurant so you should probably RSVP."}
{"text":"So perfect. The only restaurant in the city with good service. Also the food and drinks were perfect. We had a great time (6 of us) and the atmosphere is so chill! Love it!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Great pizza!
I live in Bologna, Italy for 3 years... And magpie makes by far the closest pizzas I used to eat. 
Margherita and a St. Ambroise while sitting at the bar is a must!
Also the bartenders/waiters know their cocktails very well...."}
{"text":"What a disaster!we decided my partner and I to try this new restaurant on Amherst well maybe we shouldn't have done so!It started on a bad note we waited 10 minutes to have a drink menu another 15 minutes for the waitress to come back!the choice of wine by the glass is very limited 2 choices that evening of which none was really good at 10$ for a little glass!
I had the oysters that came on a bed of water instead of ice and the sauces were meaningless in taste.
Then we waited about 45 minutes for our pizza because the waitress had forgotten to put the order and the restaurant was practically empty!
There was no coordination between the two servers who by the way were very charming but it's not enough to make you want to come back!
I am going back to my old pizza joint:good and inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Allo? Oui? 
C'est moi! 
C'était juste pour te dire que CETTE PIZZERIA EST FANTASTIQUE!

J'y suis allée deux fois en trois jours je pense, pendant les festivités de Fierté Montréal. Était-ce parce que la pizza est super bonne (j'en ai goûté 3, j'ai adoré les 3), parce que la personne qui nous servait était vraiment cute, parce que le décor est chouette aussi, parce que le rapport qualité/prix est chillos?

Sûrement toutes ces réponses.
Ah, aussi, faut savoir que les toilettes sont vraiment propres. 
Ça, des fois, ça aide. 
Et pour les impressionnables, OUI, on voit les gens spinner les pâtes à pizza derrière le comptoir de la cuisine. 

Je crois que c'est tout. 
Ah, aussi, j'ai cru comprendre qu'il y a un.e DJ certains soirs et ça ferme tard. C'EST SI HYPE!
Accourez-y!"}
{"text":"How do you fix a broken pizza? .......... ....................With Tomato Paste
Too Cheesy??? Never mind. Pizzeria Magpie..... Definitely the Best pizza I've had in Montreal. The wood fire goodyness makes these pizzas so awesome. Thin crust pizzas and slightly burnt at the edges. That's the way (aha, aha) I like it. We tried the Pizza Arrabiata (sausage, Monteray cheese , rapini, red onions, tomato sauce) and the Prosciutto  (Arugula, cherry tomato, bocconcini, tomato sauce). The Prosciutto was really good. Not too salty.The Arrabiata was great. Had a spicy touch to it. The tomato sauce for the pizza's is out of the world. All the ingredients are fresh. Add the spicy oil for extra flavor. They take credit cards, but no debit cards. And yes, Pls make reservations as the place tends to get really packed. 


Food -  Awesome 
Service - Friendly

Worth the money - Yes"}
{"text":"Je l'ai goûté hier en plein show au belmont du groupe pizzaunderground. Ils nous ont distribué de la pizza magpie. C'était pas mal du tout. Quoique pas assez chaude, ça m'a donné envie de la tester dans de bonnes conditions au restaurant"}
{"text":"I'm such a fan. The pizza is so great. I always try the special pizza and I'm always pleasantly surprised. Recently I had the Hawaii - pulled pork, pineapples, bbq sauce.... I mean it's amazing. Defiantly a place to try one of montreal's better pizza's."}
{"text":"I found this place to be overpriced and overrated. The pizza wasn't bad but it didn't blow my mind and make me glad I was going to pay almost $16 for a personal margarita pizza. I did enjoy the basil as big as my face though! As for the interior of the restaurant, it was completely uncomfortable. Even though most everyone there was trying to speak quietly among themselves I could not focus on who I was with because we were packed in so closely to everyone else. I didn't find the servers to be particularly friendly either.  I'm glad I tried this restaurant but wouldn't feel the need to return."}
{"text":"Magpie is so pretty and sweet tucked quietly just off St Laurent and kept cozy with the hearth of the wood burning pizza oven in the room. The service was a little spacey and unintentionally aggressive, but the waitress seemed new and the rest of the team seemed more efficient and hospitable so I'm sure she'll get there. The Bloody Caesar came spicy in a pint sized glass with olives stuff with garlic - I'll give you 4 stars for that right there on a parched day, and the pizza and appetizers I tried were all fresh and tasty as well. A nice option in the Plateau / Mile End fer sure, especially in the winter."}
{"text":"What a delicious unique restaurant!

Came here because of the awesome reviews on of course Yelp! The critiques were dead on. Not only do they have some tasty pizzas, they have oysters!! 

My boyfriend and I sat at the bar where we both ordered Bloody Caesars that were great. We ordered oysters to start- even better than we expected. Appetizer-meat balls, so tasty and perfect size for 2. Lastly, we ordered a prosciutto pizza to share- authentic and mouth watering!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Had the 'salad special' - yum. The pizza crust is the best - the hot oil turns it into a whole different experience. Definitely try Pizzeria Magpie!"}
{"text":"Want pizza? Magpie should be your only choice.

Every bite of Magpie pizza is a \"Wow!\" moment. The menu is small and simple and they've perfected their craft. You can taste the freshness of every ingredient, but just the tomato sauce itself is worth the trip. 

Simple steps for an awesome Magpie night: Dark and Stormy + Arugula pizza."}
{"text":"Le service quoique sympathique, est si lent, que le désespoir est visible dans l'expression des clients. J'ai vu une famille avec 3 jeunes enfants, attendre 90 minutes, avant que la serveuse leur apporte quelques bouts de pains et 30 minutes plus tard, toujours pas de pizza à leur table. Pendant ce temps, d'autres clients recevaient leurs plats très rapidement. Manque d'organisation flagrant."}
{"text":"If you like semi thin crust artisan pizza then this one of the best restaurants Montréal  has to offer.  I ordered the meatball 4 cheese pizza and I loved it.  The ambience is dim lit with a classic style that perfectly fits a hipster theme.  Their cocktails are amazing.  I ordered the lemonade and really enjoyed it.  I am really curious to try the rest of the drinks here as the descriptions of them sound delicious.  Our server was polite and honest and offered great suggestions.  She always had a smile on her face which was quite enjoyable as she seemed to live her job.  I can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"La pizza au four à bois maison est tout simplement incroyable. J'ai commandé la Bianca: sauce tomate, épices fraîches, bocconcini, capicollo épicé et tomates cerises. Avec l'huile d'olive épicée c'était tellement bon! Elle vaut très certainement son prix (17$) il y en avait beaucoup.
L'ambiance était chaleureuse, décontractée avec la lumière tamisée et les chandelles, la musique était mon seul bémol. Du disco et du gros beat fort, c'est pas trop mon genre, ça ne fitait pas avec le genre du resto. Mais bon, ça reste mon avis personnel. Sinon le service était rapide et le serveur attentionné. Cette pizerria vaut très certainement le détour. 
Prochaine fois je gouterai le cocktail Magpie Ceasar, il avait l'air délicieux."}
{"text":"Thank you YELP! Once again, you made me happy(not that you ever disappoint). Was searching for a pizzeria place I've never been before, and found this on Yelp, and it did not disappoint at all. There's not many options for pizza on the menu, but god they don't even have to have many options. With their pizzas everything is more then enough. 

The pizza is a thin crust, a lot of cheese, and delicious! You could also add extras if you'd like. I personally got the pepperoni and added extra black olives, and I don't think I've ever had a pizza with so much pepperoni! It was just great! And I also love the vibe, and the decoration a lot too! Will definitely go back here, take my friends, tell everyone about it, and just share this place with everyone!"}
{"text":"Great pizza's, no doubt, but what actually trumps everything is the Bloody Caesar. Trust me, it's the best one in Montréal , comes with an oyster! Love this place, super cosy, and great people."}
{"text":"Not the best experience. Too salty pizza, slow service. Inattentive server. Didn't get one of the items I ordered and it showed up on the bill when we went to cash out. Ordered the mussels. They were pretty bland. The Cesar salad was good. Ordered a beer. It was very flat had to send it back. Bad music (lol) probably won't ever go back. Nice space though."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza! Service was delightful as well. The dessert wasn't outta-this-woeld, but the place is definitely worth multiple visits."}
{"text":"It is definitely time to update my review for Magpie as it was written early in my Yelp career.

Magpie is a sweet little restaurant that produces one of the best pizza in Montreal. The menu is small and is updated periodically. There is always a special pizza announced on the black board above the kitchen and I'm still raving about the lobster pizza I had a year ago, whether it was the special or not. The same board has a short list of the oysters available for the day. 

The pizza crust is like home made, a little bit thicker for my taste, definitely delicious, you can't leave even a little piece on your plate, regardless how full you may be by the end of your meal. The magic in my view is in the little wood fired oven sitting proudly in one of the restaurant corners. 

Normally you'd rather have a reservation for Magpie. My last visit was sweet, we showed up without reservation, sat on the bar and got the best service, including tasty cocktails fixed in front of us for our pleasure. This unexpected visit wins Magpie five stars."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed. I ate the entree of cheese raviolis whereas my boyfriend had the mushroom pizza. Everything was so watery and sour (believe it or not). The tomato sauce was unenjoyable because it had such a bitter after taste. Every time you went to pick up a slice of pizza it would disintegrate and fall apart. I wouldn't go back. Honestly."}
{"text":"My Wife and I were walking around Montreal and we hit Yelp and noticed Pizzeria Magpie was close by and well reviewed.

We entered the smallish establishment and our waitress brought over a bourbon bottle full of water. I ordered and St. Ambroise Pale Ale to start off. It was delicious. We sat next to a couple with their kids going through some pizzas that looked wonderful. 

We were told that the seafood pizza was on special, so I thought, \"I like pizza. I like Seafood. This is going to work out.\" My wife ordered the margarita pizza with no cheese or oil.

We waited about 20 minutes waiting for our pizza while we noticed huge calzones, beautiful pizzas, glasses of wine go by us. We continued to talk and enjoy our wonderful Montreal day.

Out came our pizza, while I ordered another beer. The Neapolitan style pizza came out with huge clams on it, calamari, scallops and mussels. The cheese wasn't overwhelming, just enough. The red sauce was just spicy enough. The crust was perfect, not too doughy. There was a ton of seafood on this pizza. The only thing that sucks about seafood pizza is that it gets a little juicy.  Overall, one of the best pizzas I have ever had.

My wife thought it was also the best pizza she had ever had in her life.

Our waitress was super nice and refilled our waters when it got low. The atmosphere is welcoming and not too loud.

We loved this place."}
{"text":"Love this place. The decor is a mix of quaint, eclectic and retro. The place  is rather small; therefore limited seating. Get there before 7pm for dinner! The specials are written up on a board over the kitchen, so bring your glasses! The staff is SUPER friendly and knowledgeable about food and wine as well as accommodating. I've been here for lunch and dinner, several times, and the food is always amazing!!! The oysters are always fresh and delicious. The \"biancha\" pizza is fantastic...I avoid tomato sauce so this was a great substitute. I've had the plat charcuterie, the roquette & radicchio salad, as well as other items, and I've never been disappointed! Their wine selection focuses on Italian wines. They have a nice variety, which is by no means cheap, but once in a while, splurging is encouraged! A definite do if you're looking for good food minus the pretentious ambiance!"}
{"text":"Pizzeria Magpie makes pizza, only pizza and they do it well... very well. Does it stack up to Pizzeria Napoletana? No... but close. Pizzeria Magpie is on Maguire, corner of St-Laurent, but without that the pretentiousness of St-Laurent. The place is beautiful, earthy with a retro feel. It seats maybe 30 people. They offer a few pizzas each looks more delicious than the other, a few beers, some drinks and pop served in glass bottles. Even the water is served in vintage soda pop glass bottles from a bygone era.

The service was curt, polite but a little terse. But then I don't want to be overwhelmed by niceties either. 

The pizza is baked in a wood oven and you can taste the wood the char on the crust which adds a layer to pizza that you can't get from a regular oven. Although some kind of oil or garlic butter on the outer crust would have it taste a little less dry. You can go for the traditional margarita pizza move up to sausage and level up with meatball and 3 cheeses. Even the pepperoni pizza looked awesome because of the angle the cut the pepperoni at, which give you long ribbons of pepperoni and adds an extra meatiness to the pizza. The only thing missing on the pizza is that extra layer of flavor, like herb infused oils, maybe some seasoning. But as a whole you can't go wrong with fresh ingredients slapped on a pizza dough baked in a wood oven to a crispy delicious pie."}
{"text":"Good place for a pizza! All the pizzas we tried (around CAN$14-19) were excellent. They had an issue with their machine and lost our order, hence a slightly delayed pizza, and they offered us drinks (CAN$8-9) to apologize - they really didn't have to, that was really sweet. 

Only downside is that the tables are pretty close to each other, so you are eating with your SO but also a bit with your neighbors - I totally understand why, and that doesn't seem to deter customers, but let's say that it is not as intimate / date-ready it could have been."}
{"text":"J'ai voulu constater par moi-même le \" buzz \" autour de cette charmante pizzeria du Mile-End. D'entré de jeu, j'ai été séduit par le décor intimiste et original de l'endroit. J'adore l'ambiance feutré et les lumières tamisées qui offre une expérience unique pour une pizzeria. C'est un bon endroit pour un rendez-vous romantique. 

Le menu est relativement simple. Des entrées de salade, de potage ou d'huitre. Les plats principaux s'articulent autour d'une série de pizza italienne dont le prix à l'unité varie entre 12 et 20 $. Quelques déserts intéressant sont offert pour clore votre repas. Bien sûr, des café expresso sont aussi proposés. Comme dans bien des restos de Montréal, le prix des vins au verre sont un peu cher. 
 
Nous avions choisi de ne pas prendre d'entré et de commencer directement avec une pizza. Jusque là, tout allait bien. Les choses ont changé lorsque la serveuse, du genre prétentieuse, est venue prendre notre commande. Notre choix nous a valu un commentaire déplacé de sa part qui, de toute évidence, désirait une facture plus gonflé dans l'espoir d'un gros pourboire. 

Il serait bon de rappeler que Magpie se trouve sur le Mile-end/Platô. Ce genre de comportement désagréable venant de serveuses prétentieuses devient courant dans ce coin de Montréal. J'en ai assez de cette attitude hautaine. Loin de moi l'intention d'ouvrir un éditorial à ce sujet, mais ce genre de comportement doit cessez.

Vous comprendrez, l'attitude de la serveuse a quelque peu émoussé la note que j'offre à ce resto. Pourtant, les pizzas italiennes sont de très bonne qualité. Changez l'attitude générale du personnel et vous avez ici une pizzeria très correcte, sans être exceptionnelle."}
{"text":"Great pizza joint and oyster bar, place is cute and food very good, try it out. They have two locations."}
{"text":"Big mistake and that's why it's a two star!
I love this place, as everyone I was with do too...and besides, where do you eat descent food in the village.
We had rez for 9pm, we called that we'll be 15 minutes late. We get there and get greeted by a most handsome fellow and tell him we had  arrived. He tells us to grab a seat and we'll be seated shortly.
Well, another group of 4 who arrive after us, 10
minutes to be exact get seated before us! No reason why, the guy forgot we were seated and gave our table to that group! Wtf!!! Did he fuckin realize why he fuckin did, I had to go up to the assistant manager and tell her what happen!
Not fuckin cool. Thanks for the drink, thanks for the apology but that fucked up my night...it's the principal of the thing. You had guest sit down and then forget them... sorry I made a mistake is not enough!"}
{"text":"Good, but not amazing - maybe my expectations were too high (from all the other great reviews they have).

I had the special, which was a lobster pizza (a first!). It was a decent amount of lobster, but given it's Lobster Season here in Montreal I would've been disappointed if there wasn't.

The venue is nice, and it would make a great date location, but the bang-for-your-buck just wasn't there for me."}
{"text":"I drooped in to Magpie's after a tough workout with friends, we were looking for a quick easy dinner and pizza sounded good.  I was pleasantly surprised with Magpie's the ambiance was warm and inviting, even though the restaurant was full when we arrived it didn't feel too noisy or cramped. My friends and I were able to have a conversation without having to yell, the music volume was at an appropriate level.

The wait staff was very nice and efficient, we never felt like we were lacking anything and when something was missing it seemed to appear on the table just as we noticed it might be missing. The only thing we had to ask for was a bottle of spicy oil we had seen on the table next to ours when we first came in. and even that arrived at our table seconds after we asked.

We ordered two pizzas one Margarita and the pizza of the day which had spinach, anchovies and ricotta cheese. Both pizzas were excellent, I preferred the margarita pizza but that's because it had a little more spice to it. The wood burning oven definitely added to the flavour of the crust, giving it a nice smoky taste. Add some spicy oil to the mix and you have the making of a great pizza.

I think everyone should drop in and try this great little neighbourhood eatery, at least once, I know I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great starters, great service, mediocre pizza.  It was there in spirit, but the dough was dry.  Flavor was great, but will probably not come back here because we spent a lot of money (almost 100$ for two people) and left unsatisfied.   

Strange, really, cos it looked great but there was something fundamentally wrong with their pizza dough.  Server said it was because of the weather - the dough dries out and reacts strangely to Montreal's climate.  That may be so part, but have not noticed this problem at other pizza places I've frequented this year.   

 Service was excellent, the room at first looked crowded and small but once we settled in the ambience was pleasant.

EDIT - Have been back, pizza was mercifully better."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Montreal! The ingredients are fresh and top quality .
I had the pepperoni and cheese pizza . It was fantastic . The sauce , the bread, everything is just great.
Even my Caesar salad starter was amazing. Best croutons and pancetta . Warm and cozy atmosphere as well! Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Bonne Pizzeria de Montréal. Desfois je vais sur des blogs indépendants de montréal pour voir leur take sur la Pizza du siècle et j'ai vu Magpie dans la liste de nombreuses fois. J'avais faim, mon ami avait soif - de vin - et on s'est arrêté le temps de mangé une pizza et boire une bouteille de blanc. Les options du menu sont écrit sur le menu avec des choix du chefs/choix du jour offert par notre serveuse qui avait l'air excellente, mais j'avais envie de Pizza, c'était ma quête. 

La sauce est excellente, bonne touche d'acidité mais goûtant la tomate fraîche qui change des épaisses sauce hyper acidulité ou surépicé, la croûte une belle épaisseur, maison, croustillante et de bonne qualité. J'ai apprécié ma pizza malgré le prix un peu élevé. Je présume que cela va avoir le coin (c'est dans le Mile-End après tout). 

Bouteille de vin + Pizza ; 65$ Donc pas donner!"}
{"text":"I forgot we were in Montreal... This pizza literally tastes as if you've been transported to Brooklyn. Superb. Well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why people are not giving this place 4+ stars, sometimes Yelp reviewers can be so exasperating (and the creators of South Park tend to agree)! I would never compare the food here to frozen supermarket pizza. It's gourmet wood fire pizza made fresh, you can even see it being made from the kitchen! So I'm leaving a 5 star review - and this does not come easily, as I consider myself a bit of a food 'snob' and prefer to eat dishes made with fresh, locally sourced ingredients. I've been to the location in the Mile-End quite a few times and LOVE their pizza, but once I found out there was a location close to my boyfriend's house we decided to go check it out. Food is exactly on par with Mile-End location, there is also much more seating space than the Mile-End location, the decor is fantastic, it's clean and cute, the waiter was super friendly and attentive, we got our food fast, the servings were HUGE and everyone in my group enjoyed their food. My boyfriend had the pasta carbonara, his aunt had the pasta à la bolognese and I had the goat cheese pizza. Yes, it's a bit more pricey than your average pizza place, but you definitely get what you pay for in terms of quality and taste, which is definitely not average! Will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"This was my second time at this pizza place and it was just as good as I remembered. My girlfriends and I decided to go to Magpie after our plans to go to an art gallery event flopped. I was not disappointed. The Bloody Caesar was so good and had the right amount of spices in it. Now for the pizza I was debating between the sausage pizza (sausage mozzarella, blue cheese , red peppers, red onion and tomatoes sauce) or the goat cheese pizza (goat cheese, pancetta , arugula,  basil and tomato sauce) and the waitress said both were good but that the former was more American and the latter was more Italian. In the end she suggested I take the sausage pizza and I was very happy with my decision. The pizza was juicy and outright delicious. I was pleasantly surprised that the chili oil actually had a kick to it. We shared a bottle of pinot grigio and did a shot with the waitress. It was a good night. :) I like that they give lollipops when you pay rather than the usual mint or wrapped candy.... it's original."}
{"text":"What a beautiful restaurant, that's what I thought everytime I walked past this place. I finally went there a couple of weeks ago and wasn't disappointed with the atmosphere of the place. Food wise, I had the pepperoni pizza, which had an unbelievably generous amount of pepperoni and cheese. It was really quite a delicious treat. However, perhaps because of the enormous amount of pepperoni and cheese, that evening I felt really thirsty and had to drink gallons of water. But that's just me. The only thing that didn't sit right with me was that the otherwise lovely crust was a little too burnt to my liking. At the end of the meal, I ended up with black burnt stuff swimming in grease on my plate, which was not a pleasant sight."}
{"text":"I keep waiting and waiting, but, so far, the New Wave of Pizza that's been sweeping much of the rest of the continent for the last decade, has caused little more than a ripple along the banks of the mighty St. Lawrence. Magpie gets an \"A\" for ambition--it's a nice looking pizza joint, they've outfitted it with with an impressive-looking wood-burning oven, and they've put together a decent menu--but the pizzas have yet to come into their own. The combinations of toppings are fine--some are even inventive--but it's the crust that's lacking. Too much cornicione (in terms of area, not in terms of volume), too droopy in the center, light charring, not nearly enough character. Give 'em another chance? I've given them three since they opened last fall. At this point, I'm waiting until I hear of a marked improvement. Otherwise, I'm saving my shekels for my next trip to New York."}
{"text":"The food is not bad... that place is overrated.  If you are a big guy make sure to go there when the place is empty and bring your own chair coz the chairs are small and the table are even smaller and so close to each other. You will hear the conversation of your neighbors like you are sitting with them. If you order anything more than a pizza and drink there is no space on the table. I sat near where they cook the pizzas so half of my head was burning and was soo annoying. The pizza wasn't even that good...the outer part was a bit burned and half empty....and it was small and it wasn't cheap."}
{"text":"We were welcomed to our table by polite, friendly staff, before being promptly supplied with chilled table water (which was topped up throughout the meal). Three of the party went for the special, a mediterranean pizza (with lots of olives) and enjoyed it, whilst I went for the \"safer\" pepperoni option, something I instantly regretted - a typical pizza base topped with mountains of what I can only describe as spam... very sloppy, very fatty, and not very tasty. My advice, steer clear of the pepperoni pizza.
That said, the rest of my party were happy with their food and the other meals around the restaurant looked nice. The atmosphere was relaxed and a mostly young clientele, although table etiquette was raised - restaurant rules appeared to be in place (knives and forks, folks).

Overall, a not too bad lunch experience, and you get a lollipop with the bill! Its just such a shame that the menu was so misleading. I don't know on what planet that mystery meat is classed as Pepperoni..."}
{"text":"I like my pizza to have at least some crunch, so I wasn't expecting much when I came here, knowing that they serve soft wood oven pies. The char on the pizza provides a little burnt taste that replaces the much loved crunch. You are left with a delicious flat bread/pizza with awesome toppings. 
Special mention: fabulous tomato sauce, amazing caesar salad 
The place is always packed and cramped. The service and atmosphere are great. 
Bon appétit!!!!!"}
{"text":"Magpie est un restaurant que je connais bien   Depuis quelques années il y a aussi une succursale sur Amherst où je vais toujours maintenant. Ce soir nous avons décidé d'aller sur la rue Maguire. Ma note basse est spécifiquement adressé au service plus qu'inadéquat que nous avons reçu. D'abord l'accueil quasi inexistant ne nous a pas enchanté. On s'est fait aborder d'emblée en anglais alors que les serveuses étaient bilingue. Personnellement je trouve ça vraiment pas professionnel de ne pas s'informer de la langue de préférence des clients. Ensuite ça pris un temps fou avant qu'on vienne nous voir et serve de l'eau. L'eau a été à moitié servi sur mon napperon sans même que la serveuse nonchalante s'en rende compte. Elle m'a servi une pizza brûlée sans me demander si ça m'allait. Ne nous a jamais demandé si tout est à notre gout. Incapable de faire des recommandations sur sa carte des vins. Finalement nous fait payer en nous abandonnant avec la machine. Bref je ne remangerai jamais dans cette salle à manger. Take out ou Amherst ( où toujours eu des expériences très positives)"}
{"text":"I came here earlyish on a Saturday night and was able to get a table, which my friend said would absolutely not have happened at their original location.

The space itself is very charming. The service was good. But the pizza really did stand out. Sure, maybe it's because I've been living in Toronto and my pizza standards might have dropped since I left Brooklyn, but I was really quite pleased with the daily pizza special. Like eating way past the point of being full pleased. This place is a winner."}
{"text":"Petite sortie avec mes collègues. On était 10, on avait fait une réservation mais quand on est arrivé les serveurs nous ont placés sur deux tables différentes. Ce n'était pas normal, on a donc demandé à être ensemble et ils ont vite trouvés une solution ! Le restaurant est assez sombre et l'ambiance e est plutôt cosy. On est venu le jour d'un concert de Jazz, c'était vraiment Nice et appréciable. 
Mes coups de curs : La salade crémeuse avec pancetta croustillante et fines herbes, tellement bonne vraiment, pas trop grasse et ni trop crémeuse. Et les lardons croustillants relevaient vraiment la salade. Je risque de retourner juste pour elle. Et le mojito était vraiment pas mal, sucrée & mentholée comme il faut. 

J'ai été un peu déçu de ma pizza à la viande fumée avec ses piments forts (mais vraiment forts!). Elle était sans plus et la pâte s'était gorgée de sauce donc impossible de la prendre à la main ! 
Ensuite, mes huîtres, un régal, les assaisonnements aussi étaient vraiment bons.
J'ai goûté le cocktail Magpie Ceaser avec son huître, j'ai trouvé ça super original. Mais franchement c'était pas ma tasse de thé mais pourquoi pas pour les mordus de parloudes, huîtres, etc."}
{"text":"This was such a pleasant suprise! This is not a pizza please, this is a flavor orgasam! We are from America we have been here almost a week and eaten in a lot of restaurants... Thus is the best! The the staff is as nice as can be with the best personalities. The cook is a rock star. We got the mussels and were practically drinking the sauce and the cook saw how much we liked it and got us more bread to dunk it. That is top notch attention for the customer.  We got the Margarita pizza and it DESTROYS all other MARGARITAS! The smoked meat pizza tastes like nothing I have ever had. They are food alcamists. I hope to come here again on my next visit and eat the rest of the pizzas! Totally unrelated but the waitress, besides being super nice are possibly the most attractive girls in Montreal!

Update: Jacoba (besides being atttactive) is an absolute sweet heart and made an effort to find out where we are from, who we are, and asked about our experience. Give the girl a raise"}
{"text":"Heard great things. That one star is because I had to put it there by the way. I waited 45 minutes for oysters another 30 minutes for a kale salad with an overcooked poached egg - disgusting. The waitress decided to come up to us 30 minutes later saying that they forgot about our order and will be another 15 to 20 minutes for the pizza and that she will give us drinks on the house to compensate for the wait - got the pizza another 30 minutes or so later and it was good. I was ready to pay for my bill and the drinks were on the bill. I was disgusted with the service and the pizza wasn't even that great. Will never go back and neither should you. There are so many other pizza spots in the area."}
{"text":"Oh yum! Pour une vraie de vraie pizza italienne à la croûte mince et aux ingrédients simples mais frais et créatifs, Magpie est un bon endroit à considéré. Quand je suis allée, c'était en pleine saison du homard alors il y avait une pizza spéciale pour l'occasion. Je m'attendais à quelques morceaux seulement, mais au total, il y avait au moins l'équivalent d'une queue de homard et demie déposée en plein centre. J'ai aussi mangé la pizza aux artichauts qui était très bonne mais parois un peu trop salée à cause du type de fromage mais qui était tout de même très bonne. Le cocktail à la limonade est aussi super rafraîchissant et parfait à boire juste avant l'arrivée de la pizza. Au total, ça été une belle soirée avec de bon plats, mais pas au point de dire que c'était la meilleure pizza que j'ai eu en ville à date. J'étais contente de simplement essayer l'endroit qui fait parti de ma liste de commerces à essayer depuis plus de 2 ans!"}
{"text":"I love the pizza here as the crust is always done just right and their flavours are simple, yet perfect. Lots of vegetarian options and on the night that we were here, they had fresh gnocci on special and OMG was it ever tasty: cheese, great texture and cooked to perfection. The staff are all fun, the service was fast and we scored a seat by the window for some good people watching."}
{"text":"After a great experience at GEMA, I got another hankering for a pizza the following weekend. I got some friends together and planned to head back for a second try when I discovered that they were closed for summer vacation. Darn..... well we still had a desire for pizza, so where to go? Thinking about places nearby, I had a flash and remembered Pizzeria Magpie, located across the street from Chez Serge bar in Mile End. One of those places I have had on my never-ending list for a while but kept forgetting about. We drove up hoping they had room for 4 on a Saturday night and luckily for us, they did.

First thing I noticed walking in was the overall look and vibe. A small intimate space overall with the open window in the front to give a little terrasse feel, low lighting, a beautiful dark bar on the side, the blackboard menus and the ceramic-tiled pizza oven visible to all - Magpie gives off a relaxed cafe/bar feel but with enough intimacy to be a solid date place and enough \"edge\" to be a cool place to bring friends for a happy hour or late evening meal. Loved it completely - this place goes on the possible date locations list (whenever the heck that ever happens again... but that's a story for another day).

For starters, we grabbed some of their cocktails to get the evening started. My friends selected the Pimm's Cup and the Magpie Caesar. The Pimm's Cup, served with some mint and cucumber, had exactly the kind of citrus and spice flavours you look for. Very refreshing. As for the Caesar, it certainly looked impressive - especially with the steak spice used on the lip of the glass, however I hate Caesars so I didn't try it. My friend certainly enjoyed it though. In my case, I went for the Dark and Stormy - dark spiced rum mixed with the house made ginger soda. Very nice balance between the sweet rum and the ginger.

Before the pizzas came, I just had to order some oysters. On this evening, Magpie had 3 varieties - Conway Royals, Gooseberry Bay and Tresor and I asked for the mix of all three. Served with fresh horseradish, lemon and lime wedges, a mignonette and some hot sauce, the oysters were all of good size and shucked perfectly. Nice start to the meal.

But really, the key here is the pizza...Magpie is a pizzeria after all. There are 9 regular pizzas available as well as a special of the day. Since we were four people, we decided to order four different ones and share them in order to try as many as we could. Before we address the topping options, let's talk dough - the foundation of the whole thing. Magpie, using that beautiful wood oven over in the corner, do it pretty well. Had I not been to GEMA about a week prior, I may have said it was best in Montreal. After that experience, I would say it is very good but just a level below the best. The crust has a good levity and chewiness to it with a decent crispiness on the bottom, however to get the crunch, we end up having some burnt spots on the pizzas. I wouldn't have had an issue with it before but if we are going to compare the best pizza joints in Montreal, we are now at that point...

Anyway, the first one up was the special of the day - a gravlax pizza with onions, tomatoes and dill. A very creative option - the gravlax itself was delicious and quite plentiful on the pizza. The fresh dill, tomatoes and onions work well with gravlax normally so of course it would work on a pizza. Loved the overall quantity of topping as well. An excellent out-of-box option which in my opinion is worth keeping around as a regular option.

Next up was the goat cheese pizza with pancetta, arugula, basil and tomato sauce. Great combination of the creamy goat cheese with the salty rich pancetta to elevate this one past the traditional Margherita. Excellent pizza. 

The third one was the prosciutto pizza with arugula, cherry tomatoes, bocconcini and tomato sauce. Another solid pizza - any pizza with prosciutto is good by me - although personally I felt that there was way too much arugula over top of this pizza which kinda made it overly peppered.

The final pizza was the Bianca - with roasted garlic, spicy capicollo, cherry tomatoes, bocconcini and herbs. This is one spicy pizza - a little too much for my liking personally. I was quite surprised at just how much the capicollo overpowered everything else on this pizza. I also would have enjoyed a bit more cheese on this one. Good but my least favourite of the four easily.

Pizzeria Magpie is a solid entry in the Montreal pizza scene - and by far the best in Mile End in my eyes. The cocktail and oyster combo with the relaxed and intimate atmosphere make it a perfect place for a quick bite or drink before a larger meal - and that is without taking the pizzas into consideration. They also do weekend brunch now which intrigues me tremendously. Not my first choice for a pizza but close enough - both in quality and in location - for me to definitely be back in the near future.

{"text":"Delicious pizza! I got the margherita and the Mediterranean with a friend. The sauce is divine and everything tastes fresh! The cheese was so creamy and of very good quality! I had a great meal! Friendly staff! I highly recommend it! Can't wait to try more of their pizzas!


Update: officially my favourite pizza place of all time now!!! 

I usually get the margherita because it's just so good but also have ventured into trying their other pizzas and they never disappoint! The texture, taste, and ambiance makes me very happy every single time! I'd highly recommend the Bianca pizza! I get it without the meat and it is my favourite pizza! Unique and so flavorful! Tastes great with their spicy sauce too! Couldn't recommend this place more!"}
