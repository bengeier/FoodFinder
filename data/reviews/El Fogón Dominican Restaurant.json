{"text":"Tonight my husband and I decided to go out for a date night. We walked in and sat down to be greeted by a young waitress. Let me mention we were the second table that had sat down for dinner. Everything was fine till we ordered our food. My husband ordered a soup which unfortunately they did not have available so he changed his order to a different soup and I had ordered the beef stew that the waitress said was very good. After receiving our appetizer about 20 minutes later we waited about an hour or so to no food what so ever. I went up to the waitress to let her know that the 5 tables that came in after us had been served and about to leave. We still did not have our food at that point. About 30 minutes later my husbands food arrived and not to mention when I asked the waitress where our food was an hour in she assured us it would only be about 5 minutes because they had to warm up his soup. His soup was the only thing to arrive at the table. I had to wait about 10 minutes later till my beef stew came out. I will say that my meal was not worth an hour and 45 min wait. The meat was extremely dry and the sides of rice and beans were definitely precooked. Soon after I asked the waitress to bring me a box and then the owner finally came over. I told her what had happened and she let me know that our ticket went to the back of the line. Why? She said that she didn't know. I mentioned to her that this was unacceptable.  She had no interest in what I had to say because we received no apology. I also mentioned to her that the natts flying around are definitely bothersome and very annoying. Once she brought our check we still received no apology and just a reply of \"I went down the street to some up scale restaurant and they had bugs too.\" Okay? So what was I supposed to say to her? As if that wasn't a problem. That's probably why their health rating was only 91.5! I will never return to this establishment again. This was the worst experience we have ever had!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for authentic caribean food with that home made taste, then this the place to be. With a varied menu for every day of the week, and featuring those antojitos dominicanos that will transport you back home. The best sancocho and rice and beans and roasted pork. Yum thanks God the fog√≥n finally brought decent eating to Gastonia."}
{"text":"I agree with all the many other negative reviews, I was astounded at their high prices, unless they are family meals for four, their pricing is absurd. My wife is NewRican and she was dumb founded by their menu, half the menu was unavailable, we ended up telling them fry us pork chops, side of rice and one more item. We left absolutely dazed and confused. We've eaten at many Dominican/Puerto Rican places in New York, Chicago, Charlotte and this is the worst organization. It's almost like going to your Mom's house to eat and there's nothing in the fridge! It's been maybe two years since we went and I think they are still in business!?!? We might peek in to see if it's better since the early days. But honestly I'd rather drive to Punta Cana in Charlotte where we know everything is wonderful: food, staff, prices."}
{"text":"Finally a good Dominican spot! Food is good and the price is very reasonable!! I was tired of going to Dominican restaurants that didn't have good food but I had no other choice, unless I wanted to cook at home . So thank you to the owner for opening up this spot!"}
{"text":"I was excited to learn that this place offers authentic Dominican food, but my first time visiting this place was nothing but disappointing. This place is hidden from the main street. The interior looks far more promising than the exterior. It appears to be run by only one cook and one waitress, and they play upbeat Spanish music during your dining experience.

To begin, there was clearly a language barrier with the waitress. It also appeared that she had none (or very little) prior experience as a waitress. I originally wanted to try the Sancocho, which includes a medley of plantain, carrots, yucca, corn, and beef. However, as soon as I requested it, the waitress immediately left our table without a word. She later returned with the chef, who explained that the Sancocho ($10.95) was out of stock. Well, isn't that just fantastic.... I really wanted that one. Then, I asked about the Mondongo (Tripe Stew, $10.95), and the waitress struggled to describe what was in it, but the impression I received from her was that it was plain and not spectacular. Fine, next option - I'll have the Sopa de pollo (Chicken Soup, $8.95). That was a satisfactory order for the waitress. I enjoyed the soup, which consisted of thin spaghetti noodles (Spanish noodles), potatoes, carrots, a small chicken drumstick, and a side of rice. There was great flavor, and it was perfect for the overcast, slightly chilly day.

My boyfriend had a similar issue with ordering food. He originally requested the Carne de cerdo guisada (Pork Meat Stew, $10.95). Waitress said there was no pork. Alright, so he will accept chicken instead of the pork. Somehow, this ended up becoming another order of Chicken SOUP (Sopa de pollo) instead of Chicken STEW (Pollo guisado, $10.95). My boyfriend immediately recognized that it was not what he ordered as soon as he received the bowl of soup. 

I will say though, their Empanadas (pastelitos, $1.50 for 2 pieces) are absolutely delicious! They are large, golden, and perfectly flaky. We had pork that was juicy, tender, and a good portion size for the empanada. Oh and the sauce that it comes with, the one that looks like Thousand Island dressing - WOW! I usually don't care much for empanadas, but I could eat these for days!

The rest of the service could use some work (in addition to the issues that came up during ordering). The waitress did not refill our water unless requested, and I had to request this twice, despite being one of only two groups to serve in the restaurant. She also didn't have the check ready at the end of our meal, or even realize that it was time for the check after removing our dishes from the table at the end of our meal. At one point, the cook came out herself to help us, and at another time, she had to shout to the waitress to help us. 

Bottom line: Food is great, but don't assume your top picks are available. Just order the Empanadas and the Chicken Soup. Prices are on the high end, mostly $11-15 for main dishes. Service needs improvement."}
{"text":"Perfect food! Breakfast, lunch, & dinner. I enjoyed the ox tail stew with red beans, white rice, and a salad. They have a variety of juices and most of the meals are beef and pork featuring some seafood such as crawfish and codfish. Definitely worth trying- especially if you've never had Dominican food!"}
{"text":"El Fogon was delicious. The food was authentic and reasonably priced. The staff was friendly although a bit unorganized. You could tell this was a new operation by their level of service. We visited with a party of 6 and it took over two hours from start to finish to get through the experience. The big complaint is the length of time it took to order and receive our plates. Other than this it was a good meal and experience. Maybe we will just order ahead and do take out next time!"}
{"text":"Okay so I'm going to go into the loss of two stars. First of all , they were super slow. I was expecting maybe to take 45 minutes to get in and out. I was on my lunch break and it took my entire lunch break plus 30 minutes. That  is an hour and a half total. Way to long for lunch. 
 I also found a hair in my food and it was not my hair nor was it the person's I was with but I am a hairstylist so I picked it out and moved on. Not to say that you will do the same if you were to find a hair in your food but I was already hungry and running late so I did not say anything. There was no hairnet on the kitchen staff lady.  The rating from the health department wasn't great but I've eaten at worse.

That was really the only  things that I could say this negative but I know people love the negativity so I'll give it to you first.


What I did like about this place is it the food was excellent Dominican food we shared a plate of pork meat and oxtails the ark oxtails were fantastic you can really tell that these people know how to do it right in the kitchen the flavor profile was absolutely amazing on both Meats that we ordered there was rice and something else that I don't even know why it was on there but it was amazing it was potato salad which I didn't know Dominicans were famous for potato salad but the holy Bombshells wherever they buy it or however they make it it's really good we ordered the rice with black beans and I think I got like what was left in the pot which is never good but there was some like good parts in it so I was kind of disappointed that they gave me the scraps but the part that I did get that wasn't what was stuck to a pan it was really good and did I mention the potato salad was amazing."}
{"text":"My first time here and I was totally disappointed. The drinks were tasteless. The food bland with no flavor or taste. The grilled steak....unchewable . Service was horrendous and took forever. It wasn't worth the money. We ordered two drinks but one was served and it took another 10-/+ to get the other. After working many years in high end restaurants I know it's only polite to serve all parties at the same time. They will be out of business sooner rather than later. The only good thing that I can say about this place is that I loved the music."}
{"text":"We went today to try out this new place.  We sat down at 1:00, and ordered off the daily menu small plates that run around $8.  This place has most plates around the $15 and up mark, which tells me this hole in the wall will price themselves out of existence.

I ordered the Pernil and my wife a \"steak with sauce\" dish as the server said there were limited options on the menu.  We waited over 45 minutes for something that is usually prepared ahead of time and ready to serve.  Literally two other groups were sat, ordered, served, and left before we even had our food!  

They didn't have the usual side dishes to go with the meals ready yet (at 1:00?), so we asked for tostones instead.  I received my Pernil 10 minutes ahead of my wife, and it was cold along with the tostones.  Since it was now close to 2:00, I decided to just eat and get out of there.  My wife's food was just a milanesa thin cut steak with mojo, nothing like what was described by the server.

We asked for the check to leave, and after 15 minutes I decided to just hand over the credit card to get out the door.  The server came back, she charged us $14 a plate for the food when the menu clearly stated $8!!!  She disappeared into the back, I left in disgust, and will let my credit card company take care of the dispute.  Worst experience in a long time."}
{"text":"Really bad food too greasy and apart I got a hair on the napkin wrapping the spoons and some of the food was frozen terrible experience"}
