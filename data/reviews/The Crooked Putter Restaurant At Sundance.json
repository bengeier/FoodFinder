{"text":"if you  enjoy flies buzzing around and in ur food then this is the place for you!!!   always a problem so go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure to eat here.  Good friendly service.  Decent lunch menu, never crowded, plenty of parking."}
{"text":"We are here at least twice a month. You cannot get a better breakfast / brunch for the money anywhere! Service is always good even when busy. Everyone is friendly and helpful! Comfort food at its best! We still need to stop by for a hotdog and a beer some afternoon!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here on several occasions and have been happy every time. Kudos to our waitress Michelle last night, the place was packed and she and the rest of the gang did an excellent job."}
{"text":"We enjoy eating at the crooked putter in buckeye az. The food is always good never disappointed and have some healthy choices on the menu. We bring our out of town company here for breakfast as the atmosphere is pleasant with a great view of the golf coarse and mountains. Prices are reasonable and everyone has always been pleased with being there. Would recommend the crooked putter to anyone."}
{"text":"This place has improved tremendously!  We have had breakfast a few times recently and dinner once on a Friday when they gave a burger apecial. Really a great deal for the price and the burgers tasted great. A basket of fries is plenty for 2 people. The waitress are nice and fast...a far cry from a few years ago.  We will be going back often. Beautiful view too of the golf course and the White Tank Mountains."}
{"text":"Food is great & the waitstaff are all friendly and welcoming!   Zach, the bartender, is amazing & makes the best bloody mary I've ever had.  Breakfasts are huge, cheap & yummy! Pancakes, french toast & biscuits w gravy, all stellar.  Skip the breakfast burritos.  Their cheeseburger was the best I've tasted from a restaurant.  Fries were crispy, just like they should be."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food, great prices and excellant service!  Friday Fish Fry is the best and is our go to place from Victory Verrado.  Have been telling the neighbors and see their faces up there everytime we go.  Mom & Pop places are the best!"}
{"text":"We eat here all the time, have never been disappointed. On occasional weekends mornings get a little crowded but the wait is worth it. Everything on the menu is wonderful. I highly  recommend this out of the way golf club restaurant !!.   Best chef in the area, great staff, great food and great prices!!"}
{"text":"The food and service are horrid but the view is nice.  It's located by the rec center at Sundance adult community.  We had corned beef one night, it was so bad we didn't finish.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Each time we went, the wait staff did not het our orders correct"}
{"text":"Best place food I had in a long time. Best service ever! At times it's busy buy the server keeps up pretty well. Trish is the Best!"}
{"text":"I love their fish fry on Fridays. It is so convenient to call in an order and it be ready in 15 minutes. The pieces are nice in size, the coleslaw is good, and prices are good. Must try!"}
{"text":"First time visiting. Friday's \"\"Fish fry!\" Outstanding server! (Trish) Outstanding prices! Happy hour drink prices to die for! Ordered a gin and tonic... Wow! Not what we were expecting! Fish was cooked perfectly. The views, outstanding! Only concern.... bar can be a little loud at times. Put this stop on your \"Bucket list!\""}
{"text":"This restaurant does not even deserve one star! We walked in and were told to sit wherever we liked - we chose a corner table with a nice view - that was the only nice about our experience! We waited at least 20 minutes and no waitress even stopped by - a waitress who came to deliver food to the table next to us and checked on them once  and finally stopped by with a puzzled look on her face and said she would find out who our waitress was - there were only two servers that we could see!  After another table came in and sat down and was taken care of before us ... that was the last straw - stopped by the bar on the way out and explained the situation - he said what can I do for you and I said absolutely nothing - we were leaving and would never be back!!"}
{"text":"The Restaurant could use a tad bit of work. I would take a half a star off for the ambiance if I could but the food made up for it. The tables and chairs seemed a bit old, (but we had just been visiting some newer and more expensive golf communities prior) but wasn't too bad and the food was fantastic. I regret I did not take a photo of my special of the day hot dog. Yes, I said hot dog. There is a photo here of their chili. Well, imagine that smothering a 1/4 pound all beef hot dog with cheese and onions on top. it was so good! The chili just truly was the icing on the cake. The best Chili ever!!! Service was very good and prompt. I would return especially on Hot dog day! :) The only time at golf courses we did inside dining on our big, long AZ adventure. Still had nice views of the driving, putting range and mountains. This was my last meal before leaving. Maybe not the best choice for a plane ride :) BUT so worth it!"}
{"text":"Came here with a large group (about 20), service was a bit slow, and had to ask for some thing's more than once. I understood because it was happy hour and we were not the only large group. There were some mix up with our checks, but things were resolved, and I thought it was fine. Again a large group, checks are going to be mixed up. However things were apparently not fine on the restaurant's end, because someone who served us decided to complain to another group at the restaurant. A man from that group decided he needed to approach us and let us know we were \"harassing his waitress\". This man knew that we were teachers, and the only people that knew that were the people who worked at the restaurant, when we made the reservation. He demanded to know what school we worked at and what district we worked for. He would not relent even after we didn't answer him. He was loud and threatening. Not once did someone come over and say something to him. Let me be clear, our group had dwindled down to 4 who had paid their tab and were enjoying the last of their drinks. We left shortly after he left us alone and he proceeded to hoot and holler at us on the way out. Again nothing was said to him or to us by anyone at the restaurant. I was uncomfortable because of his behavior I had no idea if he'd follow us out to our vehicles and continue to yell at us. I don't know that I'd feel safe returning to this restaurant, which is sad because it is a nice place to go after work for happy hour. I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"I was driving to California early and the morning and we needed a good breakfast.  Instead of shopping at the nearby dennys.  We opted for the crooked putter.   Not only were the views of the mountains amazing, but the food was a good non-corporate all American breakfast.  Would go again."}
{"text":"We have it a try based on ratings and proximity and were very pleased! She had the low carb sampler and he had the Chipotle chx sandwich and they both were delicious! Our server Jennifer was friendly, helpful and told us about the weekend specials. We will definitely be back; maybe even tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict was perfection and the price could be beat even with a $.75 upgrade to tomatoes instead of potato , would highly recommend it the view is gorgeous and it beats Denny's and Cracker Barrel !   there is no comparison !   good home cooked food hot and yummytreat yourself to go for breakfast"}
{"text":"Hot, loud and fly infested. Waited 30 min before a server approached us. Fish was cold, asked the server twice for silverware. Finally had to up front and ask for it. Talked to a former employee that stated the owner is too tight in the wallet to hire more people and turn up the AC. Health inspector needs to come shut the place down due to the flies"}
{"text":"Great service, very friendly and good food! The chili was superb and the chicken wings were big and flavorful! Highly recommend coming here am when you want to golf or just hang out!"}
{"text":"The Crooked Putter never let's my wife and I down when it comes to a great meal. Tonight we had the wing baskets with there custom made hot wing sauces, great tasting, moist and size does matter with the size of these wings...BIG. way bigger than any of the nearby wing places and priced less as well. Service is excellent, a little slow sometimes due a constant large crowd but the wait is worth it.  I highly recommend this golf course restaurant for all of the food they serve . Very popular for breakfast as the chef makes his own biscuits and believe it or not scratch made Mexican Chorizo! You have to give it a try in there popular breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Very slow service, waited over 5mins just to put in an order for drinks. Just for them to forget one of kids' apple juice. Then it took another 5-8 mins to get it. Waitress would rather hang out behind the bar and chat then take care of her tables. We were surprised - the food was actually very good."}
{"text":"The food is good but the restaurant needs fresh clean paint and definitely new flooring."}
{"text":"Place needs a major over haul but the sandwiches are always good. Fish and chips are not to my liking...."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast this morning, and was pleasantly surprised! Excellent food, and plenty of it, too! I had the Putter omelette... delicious and the hash browns were awesome! My wife had they build your own breakfast and she loved it! The waitress was extremely friendly and very attentive! We will most definitely be returning here!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place for a few years now. Great wings and food was always good. Stoped in this week and found my favorite bartender was not there anymore. Would have given another star if Karen was still working."}
{"text":"Good food good prices highly recommend our food got to us fast and the staff was nice and looking at the golf course from the outside it's a great way to eat lunch"}
{"text":"I went here with my mom for lunch and we both had sandwiches. A bit greasy, but ok. The place looks like it's been around awhile and could use some updating on the carpets and such. I've heard the fish fry is good, but haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"This place is out of the way, but it is well worth it. The food was fantastic and two people can probably share one serving. The restaurant is located on a golf course but very casual. I would come back again if I was in the area."}
{"text":"The worst service ever. I heard food was great! I've been to the restaurant four times. Wings were ok.  Service and waitresses won't mention names.  The blonde behind bar is always bothered and my 12 year old grandson told me \"That lady looks like she doesn't like her job\".  My god she's rude every time I'm there.  I can't believe the owners haven't fired her yet?  I was there the day after thanksgiving and restaurant was very slow.  It was noon when I was there.  I'm sure this isn't a news flash lol.  I'll go to Boot's.  for better wings and service like I do weekly.  Crooked putter must not need or want my money.    We thought we would give it another try.  Sat in restaurant last Wednesday.  Was ignored again!  I asked if we were invisible to my husband.  We walked out with 2 other patrons treated the same way."}
{"text":"Fabulous Fish Fridays. The fried cod is better than the baked. Service at the bar is super fast. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Can't get enough of this place. The food is great, service is exceptional, and price is very reasonable. The views are also fantastic looking out towards the golf course with the white tanks in the background. However, for the life of me I do not understand why a restaurant in a retirement community would not open until 8. My family and I would be there every single weekend if you opened sooner like your sun city location does. I really do think you'd get a lot more business if you open at 7, at least on the weekends. We've gone to Cracker Barrel down the road the last two Sundays at 7:15 and wished both times we could have been at the crooked putter instead."}
{"text":"I've only been here once, so far, but once our house is built, this will become my go-to place. The food was amazingly good, and amazingly cheap. They have funny hours, so check that before you go, but it's definitely worth a try if you are in the area.   The views are fantastic as well.   Just a surprisingly good place that you might not know is there. I mean, how many people would think to go to a Golf Club for food if they aren't playing golf??? If it hadn't been for our Realtor, we would NEVER have gone there! Thanks, Mark!"}
{"text":"great food... yummy bacon. for a resturant located at a golf course , it is very good . Great musiic playing in the background. Wait staff is friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Usually good but noisy on Friday nights for all you can eat fish fry, tonight fish was cold and the waitress was allowed to bring us only one piece at a time after the initial 3-piece serving. Maybe they hope you will get tired of waiting.....Food is usually good and service is great and that's why I gave 4 stars. FYI Saturday burger special is not the same burger as they serve on the menu."}
{"text":"Our server, Jennifer, was awesome! Great food, great service, decent prices. When we're in the area again, We'll be back!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!! Super awesome people, amazing prices and they even have GLUTEN FREE OPTIONS! Simply amazing, not to mention the food here is AMAZING!! Eat anything, you will love it."}
