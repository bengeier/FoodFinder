{"text":"One of the best fast food place in Montreal.
The prices are unbeatable, the food is fresh and the service is excellent. All their meals are good and simple and their fries are home made with fresh potatoes, which is rare now a days with the frozen fries taking over. 

The portions are good and more than satisfying, the clients like the staff are all in a good mood with no stress or rush.

This place really feels like a cozy Deli from a movie, if you haven't tried it yet do it and you'll always end up going, I guarantee you."}
{"text":"Great place to eat at. Awesome breakfasts (well-priced) & awesome lunch/dinner meals (unbeatable prices). Everything is good here.
Would recommend to anyone in Montreal ."}
{"text":"My favorite fast food in Montreal.  Their poutine is great and so are the submarines.   Their yogurt sauce is bomb."}
{"text":"Food was ok for a late night stop. I had the club sandwich. The menu said that it comes with mayo, but it came on the side. A bit difficult to take a club sandwich apart with toothpicks and find a way to put mayo on. The sandwich then fell apart. As I said , it was ok for a late night stop. Don't think I would choose the restaurant in the middle of the day."}
{"text":"Okay. Shame on me. I have been to Montreal more than 20 times and have always resisted trying the local, famous poutine because I'm not much of a fan of potatoes, cheese or gravy. 

Finally decided it's time to try it for the first time with boyfriend. This little joint is within close proximity and we got the poutine with smoked meat and a club sandwich to go. It's actually quite delicious. The potato is fresh and soft, the gravy is mild and well seasoned, it tastes light and yummy. The club sandwich with 3 layers of bread, bacon, lettuce, tomato and light chicken is also quite delish.

This joint is pretty popular with the locals and serves everything from hamburger to hotdogs to omelets to kabobs. Great place for a brunch!"}
{"text":"Two kinds of olives in the veggie pout very appreciated. The prices are very fair. Good and voluminous cheeseburger even if the pattie is a little on the dry side but it is to be expected in sich a diner type place. I recommend!"}
