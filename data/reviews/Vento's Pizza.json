{"text":"Bleh. I've tried a lot of pizza places and this is so bad. The crust is not homemade, pretty sure. I saw them take it out of a plastic bag, and it sure tastes yuck. It wasn't very hot either. I am definitely going elsewhere next time."}
{"text":"Slow service and average pizza.  Convenient to home depot."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast but was disappointed that they didn't accept debit or credit cards.
Very inconvenient in a world where cash is pretty much on the way out.

They did however, refer me to an in store ATM, but they had a high service fee for using it.

They lost my breakfast business that day."}
{"text":"Horrible Food don't waste your money

This is the worse cardboard covered cheese & sauce so called pizza I've ever had, I haven't had this garbage since grade school cafeteria food, Most of the reviews on here rant about what a great place this is how much fun you'll have there. IDK where that place is cuz the one I wan in today in East Liberty by the Home Depot was getto beyond belief the food is bad & the people aren't nice & friendly.

Loudness is an issue there when the lottery area has a sign saying because of back round noise your number may be wrong. Not one person there had decent customer service skills I had to ask the girl 3 times to speak up and I have excellent hearing. I ordered a small pizza I got a medium that was greasy on top but the crust was stale. 

I looked forward to getting some great pizza man this place really disappointed me today."}
{"text":"What a wonderful hidden gem!
My boyfriend and I have been here twice and we have raved about it both times.  The service is wonderful - the employees are patient, kind and helpful.  The food isn't 5 star, but it IS really really good and, best of all, cheap as hell!
Sure the pizza may not be cut into \"pizza shape,\" but that doesn't make it any less wonderful at all.  Everything I have ever had here is wonderful and I will definitely be taking multiple 30 minute trips back here to support this independent business."}
{"text":"The best pizza . I may be impartial because I grew up on vento  pizza from the 70's 
Sal remembered me from when I was 7 years old
And I take my kids there they love it

Either way you have try the Sicilian it's the best for sure"}
{"text":"Great and authentic pizza.  I also love his Italian army sandwich. The staff is always friendly at the register, and the owner is a nice fellow."}
{"text":"Ventos is an East End tradition.   The Sicilian style pizza is the bomb!   It is more of a traditional working-class Pittsburgh style crust.  It comes square, and bread like.  Think of men coming home from the steel mill with their thick crusty slices of square sauce & cheese pizza, circa 1955.  

If you prefer the doughy (Dominos or similar) kind of pizza crust, sickeningly sweet sauce (Papa Johns) or brick oven 'designer' pizza you might not like Vento's pizza.  It's a workingclass style of pizza in a workingclass neighborhood.  Personally, I happen to love Vento's pizza-my dad worked in steel mills all of his working days, lol.  They also have subs, and other items like deep fried mushrooms.  This is a blue collar  establishment in a an urban working-class neighborhood,  Ventos is the real deal.   Everything I've had from here is hearty & good."}
{"text":"Home of the Italian Army.

I grew up on Vento's and have been coming since they were in their old location when Sears was still there before Home Depot was built.

Vento's is located in the East Liberty section of Pittsburgh right next to Home Depot. They have been in business forever! They are a pizza and hoagie shop. They are famous for their Italian Army hoagie. I have friends that as soon as they land in Pittsburgh they come straight to Vento's for the pizza! It is Sicilian style pizza and It is delicious! Everything is made fresh so sometimes you have to wait a little while for your food. It's best to call ahead if you're really hungry.

They have tables and booths for seating. You can even play the PA lottery there. 

No debit or credit cards. CASH ONLY!

(F.Y.I. There is a generic ATM that charges $1.75 to make a withdraw.)"}
{"text":"IF you love the Steelers, you gotta Love Ventos...I love the history and the atmosphere.. Albert Vento is in Myron copes book and is a STAPLE in da burgh...  He started \"Franco's Italian Army\" !!!!!! 

You have to try Vento's Italian Army Hoagies,, and AMAZING PIZZA... I love Literally ALL food Sean the chef Makes... The Secret Sauce is phenom on Calzones too.."}
{"text":"Best pie in East Liberty. It's the same guys cooking everytime I stop in, so you know you're getting good consistent Sicilian square pizza."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I have had in my entire 40 years of life. Tasted like sauce and cheese on toast. Frozen pizza is better than their pizza. I wouldn't eat this pizza if it was free."}
{"text":"Used to be the \"staple\" of the community years ago, before Home Depot. My mom, uncles, aunts and even grandparents would grab a bite here ever since I can remember. 
On a trip home, pregnant and all, I went to visit and was extremely disappointed. I ordered a chicken salad,  picked it up, drove 15 mins to my family home only to discover that there was NO chicken in my chicken salad!!! Wtf. When I called, the guy who answered was already anticipating my call,  I assume because before I could explain to him the error,  he stated \"yup!\" and pretty much ended the call. I debated for several moments whether or not to return, but my little one made the decision for me. When I returned,  I thought I'd at least be offered a pop for my troubles,  or even a heart felt apology for the inconvenience...nope. My chicken was placed on top of the salad and the young girl at the register offered me an additional ranch dressing, for my trouble.  \"Wow\" is all I could muster up. What happened to the Ventos that was once nestled between Fox's bar and the cleaners, in front of Sears...or the one on the corner,  across from that single apartment building? Now, like everything else in East Liberty, this once regarded community staple is quickly transitioning to the gentrified community of tomorrow,  all fluff and no substance. Out with the old (school), in with the new, literally.  I hate that ish..."}
{"text":"Oh I love this place. Their pizzas are square/rectangle! A single slice is a little pricey for the size, so if you're going to go, get a whole pie. It is in the strangest location (Home Depot's parking lot)!! The picture of the founder is adorable and hilarious. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Vento's is one of my favorite East Liberty restaurants because of their food consistency. Ever since I had Vento's as a younger guy I've always enjoyed it. The Vento family is a Pittsburgh institution who have done so much for the community. 

If there's one thing that I'll pick at is that it's a cash only restaurant. It's hard to believe in 2018 that cash only places like this are still around. 

If you don't like square cut pizza you won't like it here."}
{"text":"Looking for a quick pizza in E. liberty then you want to stop and check out this place. Great food and the owner is fantastic and friendly. First time we were here today and we will def. be back!!"}
{"text":"I had heard lots of good things about Vento's. Unfortunately I did not get to experience these things. The service was slow and lukewarm. The pizza was expensive and not the same price in the restaurant as advertised on the website http://www.ventospizza.com/. Also, no credit or debit cards here.  You're directed to the ATM in the restaurant that charges a fee of $1.75.   I ordered ahead and although I had to wait for my pizza when I got there I received it cold and it just was not that good.  I also ordered provolone sticks which also did not taste good."}
{"text":"My cousin works here and that's the only reason i know about this place. The crust they use for the bread is so light and airy and i absolutely love it. It makes the eating experience that much more enjoyable.

I always order a slice or two with sausage and mushrooms because I love the little crumbly sausage that they add to the pizza. Plus if you dip it in ranch (big fattie) it taste even better. 

I took the hubby there just this week and he agreed that it is very good. They have tons of specials and even more menu options. We ordered the medium pie and 12\" hoagie for only $13. Really good deal and the italian hoagie was not too bad. I do wish however that it was a little thicker. Maybe add some more lettuce and tomatoes for fullness. By the time we got it home it was like eating a lunch meat sandwich. Still delicious but I would have like a little more bite in my hoagie.

The interior is a little outdated but they have a bunch of steeler memorabilia hanging up. Also, if you like to play the lottery they have a small window for buying and playing the numbers. Waste of money if you ask me but to each his own. 

BTW, IT'S CASH ONLY HERE, but they do have an ATM."}
{"text":"I love the veggie sub.  The owner is the nicest guy...he makes it a point to remember faces and names.  I love going to pick up my food."}
{"text":"We were visiting from out of town and just spent 6 hours driving. Found this place, read reviews on Yelp which were OK, and decided to ordered two slices. Hum...sorry not slices. More like two squares of cheesy bread. When we said these aren't slices, the lady at the register looked confused as though pizzas always look like that. We obviously aren't locals by the way we were dressed so the lady (who talked terribly) should have notified us when we first ordered it! They also have pictures of real pizzas on the wall -_-
It also took a really long time to cook those little things because they weren't pizzas. Since I was so hungry, i ordered another square of unhappiness and it was handed to me in the cooking wrapper not a paper plate, ugh. Definitely never going there if we come to visit again!"}
