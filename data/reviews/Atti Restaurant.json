{"text":"Fantastic place...  Party of 9 and all of us (accept 1 - Summer - does not like Korean food) loved it...  As I am typing this, Quinn just said \"what an awesome dinner\"...  Service is good and you can push the \"service\" button as many times as you like :-) .. Service just gets better and better...   The chicken could be better though lots of bones.   All else was just awesome."}
{"text":"We went there with a group of 20, and they were very insistent on us bringing cash to ensure that it would be less time consuming when it comes to paying them. Sure, we all went in with $20 cash. After we ordered, we waited for more than half an hour for our actual food. So I wouldn't suggest you coming in during lunch time. The waiters were very impatient with our group, telling us that other people were waiting for their food as well. The side dishes didn't come until several minutes before our main course, so that was disappointing. 

The food there wasn't spectacular. I have had food that was better, but for the price it offers and the location it is in, it's definitely one of the most convenient places to go to when you have a Korean food craving. 

Definitely try out their Kimchi jiggae though. It didn't have a lot of meat in it, but the flavouring was awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent  food, filling quantity, low price, cheapest glass of wine in town. Service courteous but a little slow--got the feeling they're too polite to rush you. Have only eaten there at lunchtime, but recommend it enthusiastically and go there often. We like everything we've tried on the menu, which is most items. Try the bimibap or the Korean crêpes for your first visit. Spicy beef is good, too. You'll be wise to make a reservation, as they fill up quickly."}
{"text":"Really I'd give it a 3 1/2

I've been craving  bulgogi something fierce. I got the bulgogi over rice, it came with a delicious soup that was soothing for this Montreal weather. The portions are large! I barely put a dent in it! 

My boyfriend got the bulgogi with the vegetables, and boy did they offer a variety! Such a colorful and fresh looking meal. He had nothing negative to say about his plate. 

The place was partially under ground and very cozy once you got in. They were very good about making sure you always have water, but our waiter came off pushy... I think he just wanted to go home, because when we called to make a reservation he said no so we rushed over to get seats. Upon arrival, there was only a few taken tables. 
When I asked about the meals, he spoke very low and fast, so it was hard to follow. Aside from feeling like he did not want to serve us, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Entertaining and exciting when dining with a large group. The atmosphere is very modern and the pleasant staff round out the dining experience. The food was delicious and  is great to share in a large party. Fantastic!"}
{"text":"More like 4 1/2 stars. My husband is a huge fan of Korean food and as for me, not so much.  However, Atti did an amazing job! We were extremely happy with the various vegetarian (fish free) options Atti offered, which is not always easy to find at a Korean restaurant. Everything we order was delicious, and the staff was very friendly. My only complaint was that it took a while to get our food after ordering. Other than that, I was very pleased."}
{"text":"This is by far one of my favorite Korean restaurants in the area  their Galbi and miyeokguk are the best! The food are reasonably priced, although the banchan (side dishes) are not as extensive as many Korean restaurant in Asia. The service is good and quite fast even though it's during busy lunch hours. During our month-long stay, we've been here more times than we can count. Definitely going to come back here again whenever we find ourselves in Montreal!"}
{"text":"The food was OK and service was alright. I really like the ambiance and the interior decoration. I had the kimchi fried-rice and the portion was huge for a fair price."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! I wasn't expecting much based on the exterior, and I should have known better than to judge a book by its cover. The inside of the restaurant was surprisingly beautiful and very well decorated. We arrived when the restaurant opened and were promptly seated at a nice corner table. 

The food was prompt and delicious. It was my first time there, so I ordered the Bulgolgi Deopbap so I could compare it with the Bulgolgi I've had in other restaurants. It wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was definitely very, very good. If you like more flavour and spice, I do recommend asking for it to be made spicy. 

My one complaint is that they only accept cash and credit cards...no debit. I wasn't prepared for that, but luckily my friend had a credit card. 

I would highly recommend this place for those attending McGill or working nearby who are on a budget, searching for a nice atmosphere and good food without the expensive price. It's a great casual date night spot. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The decor is nice, the staff kind and attentive, but honestly the food leaves a lot to be desired. It's definitely below average for authentic Korean cuisine."}
{"text":"I got the kimchi beef soup, and I loved the flavor, but there were only a couple of small strips of beef in my entire soup. That aside, everything was very tasty (soup, side dishes, and my friend's japchae) and the service was friendly as well."}
{"text":"I ordered a beaf bibimbap, a kimchi pancake and the grilled chicken, and puked after going back home. No refill of water unless we call a waitress several times. Will NEVER come back to this restaurant ever again."}
{"text":"I had a nice experience here, and it's definitely my best Korean restaurant in Montreal. I ordered the Korean seafood pancake with green onion (Hamul pajeon) and it was a delicious. It was like a sea food omelette, absolutely great i recommend it. Served with rice, a light soup and few vegetables with spices.

The service was excellent it takes like 5-10 minutes to have our meal after we ordered.

And the price is very good it cost me 15$ + taxes. So for 20 $ (tips included) you can  eat in a nice Korean restaurant. I highly recommend it ! I come back to the restaurant and it was as good as it was before ; ) 2014-10-18

Très bonne expérience au restaurant Koréen Atti. J'ai commandé la crèpe Koréen au fruits de mer and c'était tout simplement délicieux. Il s'agit en fait d'une omelette de fruits de mer avec échaloppe absolument délectable ! Je recommande ce plat grandement. 

Tout les personnes avec moi ont adorés leurs repas ! Chaque repas est servis avec riz, une soupe légère et quelques légumes épicés.

Le service est de plus excellent, cela n'a  pris que 5-10 minutes avant de recevoir notre commande. Le prix est très abordable ça ne m'a coûté que 15$ + taxes pour mon repas. Je recommande ce restaurant grandement !

Je suis retourné au resto pour une 4 ème fois et le service et la nourriture est toujours aussi bon ; ) 2014-10-18"}
{"text":"Located close to campus with a great interior design, it's disheartening to see the food and service fall so flat. 

I've frequented Atti over the past year and it almost seems to grow worse and worse with each visit. The place is severely under-staffed. They fail to uphold any of my allergy requests or even check up from time to time.

The music downstairs is too loud to carry any conversations. Perhaps they hope the music will keep you distracted from the fact that your spicy rice cake is just ketchup and pepper paste. In short, if you want authentic Korean food, this is not the place."}
{"text":"When I first walked in, I questioned if I walked into the wrong place. It's gorgeous for a Korean restaurant. Its also dim, making it so romantic for couples. The food was also good...not spectacular though. I had pork bone soup and bbp. The downside was the cost. Its a little higher. But I guess if you prefer sitting in 360degree of  fanciness while devouring Korean food, then this is the place to go!


By the way, there isn't really a lineup."}
{"text":"I had such horrible experience from this restaurant and want to share my experience hoping to let others know. 

1. Customers not allowed get more side dishes after 2:05 even though the restaurant closes at 2:30.  

Moral of the story: Do Not Go after 2:05. You Will still Be Hungry After eating the Main dish. 

2. Waiters/waitresses are not friendly. 

Moral of the story: Be Prepared to get yelled at by the waiters/waitresses 

So, I wouldn't go to this restaurant if I were you."}
{"text":"Terrible service and mediocre food.  I will not step in there again.  Waited approximately 30min to get service.  At the end we left without even ordering."}
{"text":"The food's presentation and the ambiance are outstanding, but the food themselves are just plain and boring."}
{"text":"I've been to Atti a couple of times, but ONLY because of its location near McGill. Most of my visits were disappointing. First of all, not refills on the side dishes, which come in tiny tiny portions and are not even that good. The bibimbap comes with sauces that are too strong and too Americanized (eg. mayonnaise). The pajeon is nothing out of the ordinary. The prices are not the cheapest, but are not bad at least for the fancy decor that they have. The service is not bad either. Three stars because it's very clean, especially the bathrooms. And also because it is Korean food, which I have a bias for. I wouldn't avoid it necessarily at all cost, I'd tag along if my friends really want to go, but I'd never choose to go there if it was my decision."}
{"text":"I love trying Korean restaurants but this place was unpleasant. Firstly, the waiter gave us attitude for deciding to adding more seats and people to our table. Why he was so grumpy? I don't know. Secondly, i ordered a noodle soup dish that looked and tasted like instant ramen. Is that even normal? I like instant ramen but i'm not paying 10-12 bucks for something that tastes like that.  My experience was really, just...unpleasant. Would not go back."}
{"text":"Food was okay, but terrible service. Apparently, the kitchen is in lockdown and NOBODY cant enter to get side dishes after 210pm even though the restaurant closes at 230pm. I specifically ordered mild spicy kimchi chigae, which came out to be very spicy, therefore I had to pour a cup of water to not make it as spicy. Then, I was refused more side dishes, which I had finished because the soup was too spicy. Apparently, the waiters are \"just waiters\" and could not access the kitchen. Thankgoodness, I didnt ask for more rice. Anyways, we will not return. It is a shame the service is terrible, the restaurant is fancy but that does not make up for the food or service."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, very clean place. I ordered the chicken bibimbap with the home sauce and it was just a bit too creamy for my taste.

Overall, a great experience! Would definitely recommend for a date."}
{"text":"The food is a little bit pricey compared to other korean restaurants but people come here for the ambiance, dimmed lights. Clean place. Ive been there 2 times so far and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Heard about this Korean place and it's OK but I felt me and my friend were intruding in their space...

All was fine but the speed and classiness of the service is not that great. Again, I really felt we bothered them... 

So good food,  clean resto but nothing to cross town if you're closer to another Korean resto in your sector..."}
{"text":"i went to the restaurant at 940 pm because in yelp it said its open till 110pm. we get there and theres this asshole waiter saying the kitchen closed at 925. i wouldnt call him an asshole but he said it in such a nasty tone and attitude. i wud still go tomorrow cuz its got good rating but service is shit."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch today and the service is VERY slow. It took a good 5 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge that we arrived (in spite of standing in the entrance and watching 3 waiters passing repeatedly). It took another 15 minutes to order /get water and an additional 25-30 minutes to get food. Some people who arrived later even got their food before us. The food is quite decent so it somewhat made up for the wait but I definitely would not recommend people who have to go back to work to go there on their lunch time."}
{"text":"If the service had been great, I would have given a 5-star rating.  Unfortunately they don't have the best service and it's kind freezing cold inside.  Don't know why they don't turn down the A/C.  Perhaps they don't want the food to linger in the air.  Aside from at that, the food there is great.  But it's best to come for lunch instead of dinner since portion-wise it's the same but they charge you more for dinner.  So far, I like the bibimbap the best.  It's not in the traditional Korean stone bowl but I find it very tasty and refreshing.  The texture and flavors are amazing in each bite. The kimchi stew soup is quite good too. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Definitely recommend this restaurant - it's elegant and very reasonably priced.
I didn't go here with the boyfriend mentioned in previous posts because he's an idiot and I deserve better. Not that he wouldn't have loved Atti but homeboy took a hard pass on being in a relationship with me about four months ago so he can just continue to NOT go out to amazing restaurants with me for the rest of his life.
But I digress. There is no Korean food in Vermont so I always try to get some when I vacation in bigger cities. Atti did not disappoint. My friend and I each had a steaming bowl of jigae soup which totally hit the spot since it's snowing outside and we are still hungover from last night. I had the kimchi jigae and she had the soy-based one. It took quite a while for our food to come out but was definitely worth the wait.
Not very busy on Saturday night around 8pm.
Jigae was about $13 each and comes with purple rice and banchan. Korean shrimp pancake was $6 for a very small portion. 
If you're not in any rush you should go here! Slow service and super spicy/hot food makes for a very leisurely paced meal that you will definitely enjoy. Especially if you go with your best friend instead of a loser boyfriend."}
{"text":"A very good all around experience. I wish i could spell any of the amazing dishes that I have sampled there on a few occasions but it doesnt matter, it was all very good. A very cool interior and bar. Globeater highly recommends"}
{"text":"Atención rápida y amable, vi varios reclamos con la rapidez, pero en mi caso no me puedo quejar, además en las mesas hay botones de llamado al servicio. 
El Bibimbap es excelente."}
{"text":"Overall it was nice.  The restaurant area downstairs provided a nice, cozy and relatively quiet area to eat and talk.  the service was quick and the food decent.  i ate here for lunch, to the portion sizes for the price were good too."}
{"text":"I came here with a large group of people for lunch. We had already reserved a table beforehand. I got a vegetarian bibimbap. Along with the bibimbap, there were three banchan, which were kimchi, potatoes, and string beans, and also a soup. The potatoes were really good. They put fried strings of sweet potatoes in the bibimbap, which I've never seen before, but I enjoyed the addition. The bibimbap wasn't too special, the tofu was fried, with different vegetables and there was a gochujang sauce on top. But I think the price is quite expensive. But they do have a pretty nice interior and it's right in front of McGill."}
{"text":"After flying in from California on the red-eye and working a full, long, horrbile day, I wanted to just grab some quick food and collapse on my nice king-sized hotel bed.  Pleasantly, I found Atti, instead of settling for Tim Hortons or any of the other cafe's on the block.

I ordered the Bimbibap and , although it didn't come in a stone pot, it was magnificent.  The rice was crisp and the beef was satisfying.  The veggies were tasty and fresh, the side-dishes were very pleasing.  

Sure it may not have been the most 'authentic' korean bbq but I have to rate it based off of how much I enjoyed the meal, thus 4stars  (more like 3.5 but who's counting?)."}
{"text":"Je ne connaissais pas ce restaurant. Bien contente de l'avoir découvert! 

Nous étions deux amies et ma copine m'a suggéré de prendre un bol avec boeuf et légumes (bibimbap) à 13$ (raisonnable). J'ai beaucoup aimé!

Au sous-sol, il y a des tables basses, ce qui intéressant et différent.

Je reviendrai avec mon mari."}
{"text":"How can you not love this place? The food is great and very different from most korean restaurants here in MTL in terms of decor and atmosphere. Downside is that service is pretty slow most of the time. 

Highly recommend to try the samgyeopsol in you're in the upstairs dining area or the katsu if you're in the downstairs bar area."}
{"text":"I've been there a couple of time and it turns worse and worse, I love Korean food but just authentic."}
{"text":"The food is sometimes good sometimes not. And the service is worse and worse. The manager and the owner acted very impolitely. So I decided not to go there any more."}
{"text":"I really like this place ! the bibimbap is delicious and the prices are very affordable . There isn't a huge selection of items to choose from on the menu but what they do make is on point. The location is clean , the food is delicious and reasonably priced and the service is quick and efficient. This is a great resto for lunch or even a quick bite to eat ! I will definitely be back... and definitely more than once lol"}
{"text":"If you're in the McGill area then you should definitely check this place out especially if it's lunchtime as the prices here are cheaper then.   It can be crowded at lunch so it helps to have a reservation however you can also get it to go so that can be another option.   In my experience at dinner it tends to be less busy and they have a second section of the restaurant that they open up as well so for that time you generally don't need to reserve.

I usually get the beef japchae which is a sweet potato noodle dish.  It's pretty good but I wish it would be more on the spicy side when I ask for it like that.  They also serve a kind of fish soup with it and a side dish which consists of a sampling of three different sides.  They tend to change up the sides from time to time but kimchi is usually one of the options.  I'm not a fan of the fish soup but the sides generally are pretty good.  

For the price you can't go wrong with Atti.  In general main dishes are $10 around lunch time so it's only a tad more expensive than the food court factoring in tip and tax however it's far better quality-wise."}
{"text":"It's definitely one of the best Korean restaurant in montreal. I had the typical dish at this bibimbap recommended by my colleagues who had been there many times. I had the beef variant with atti sauce. The food was delicious. It is so fresh and the special atti sauce makes the difference. The food comes with soup, kimchi and salad. It was worth every penny. In the lunch hour don't miss out the drinks for $3. It's the only place where I find it so cheap. Cheap and \"the best\" Korean food."}
{"text":"Decent tasting food, but overall underwhelming portion sizes for the price. Great decor. Quick service."}
{"text":"This place proves that it's worth giving someone a second chance. The first time I went there for dinner, I ordered the oxtail soup, but it was so-so, and I dismissed Atti as just another fancy-looking Asian restaurant place downtown. Several months later, my colleagues found out that at lunchtime their menu is half price and they quickly started going there on a regular basis, after which they wouldn't stop gushing about how delicious the beef ribs were. That convinced me to go back, and since then I've been a fan! The beef ribs are indeed a winner. Sweet, tender and come in a generous portion! The complementary side dishes - there are usually three of them (kimchi, beansprouts and potatoes cooked in sweet sauce) are also very good.
Nowadays I don't think the lunch time menu is half the price of the dinner menu, but it's still a good value for what you pay for. If I could give just one constructive criticism... there's this guy who's always there, a bit of an all rounder (maybe the manager, maybe the owner?), he's efficient and all, but could definitely use a smile. I know it's not just me. My colleagues have also commented the same. If you're going there for lunch, best to make a reservation as it's often full-house."}
{"text":"Downtown location makes it a popular dining destination. Very nice ambiance and the food was quite good, a bit pricey but not overpriced. Tried their bibimbap and liked it, but not particularly amazed."}
{"text":"Went a couple days ago for Black Friday dinner! And, they had 20% off drinks. More like Blackout Friday :p Awesome that they had both soju and sake. Anyway, my family ordered a bunch of food, including the pork belly, kimchi stew, fried chicken bites, tons of spicy kimchi, and more that I can't think of at the moment. Everything was really good! Not the best Korean I've had, but still great. Our server was funny and personable, and gave good recommendations for drinks and such. 

Also, my family did research and we decided to eat BEFORE they closed! You know, because we don't think we're above anyone and think we deserve to be served when a restaurant closes. ;)"}
{"text":"It a nice place but not amazing. The food is good but pricey, you need to reserve in advance during lunch (mist of the time) and the staff made me feel they just want my money (eat and leave). The plus sides again good food and elegant place, maybe I would take a visitor here but the bottom line is that 9 out of 10 times I would go someplace else"}
{"text":"I hate writing bad reviews, and I really try not to write them unless it's really warranted.  Sadly, in this case, it is. The restaurant wasn't that crowded, yet we waited at our table (which by the way, hadn't been cleaned) for 25 mins before being served water. Then, the main dishes took a whole hour to come out. We were just a table for two, and it should not have been so long. My husband had to ask the waiter where our food was to motivate them to hurry it up. Not only that, they did not have hot stone pot bibimbap, only the cold kind. I can't hold them accountable for this; they simply do not offer it, to our disappointment. But, because of this, we both ordered the Japchae - me, vegetarian, my husband, with beef.

My dish was utterly flavorless, extremely oily, and had very few veggies. I left over half of it on the plate when we left. My husband liked his, though. The banchan (side dishes) were delicious - only wished they'd have come out sooner since we were waiting for so long. I'd rather have had a meal out of the banchan! The soup only came in a non-veg variety, so I can't comment on that. My husband liked it. They served me the soup even though I ordered a vegetarian entree, and when I asked about meat, they simply took it away with no explanation. Each Japchae was $15, pretty pricey for what it was.

Overall:
Service & Speed: 1/5
Price: 2/5
Food: 3/5
Ambiance: 5/5 (the decor was beautiful, especially compared to most Korean places)

All in all, a disappointment. I had to come home and eat more food because I left the restaurant hungry and grumpy."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: In my opinion, Atti is a more \"upscale\" restaurant and you'll notice this as soon as you walk in. The ambiance was rather calm and the decor was classy and modern. Everything is very clean as well.

FOOD: The food in itself was good, but not extraordinary. I ordered the bulgogi bibimbap. You can tell that the quality of the food is better than most restaurants and the portion size was decent. The nice thing about Atti is that they provide a soup and three little appetizers (kimchi, green beans and potatoes) along with your main meal. Overall, it was nothing that amazed me but it wasn't bad either.

PRICE: The menu was more on the expensive side, especially when you compare it to other Korean restaurants. Also, they don't offer too much variety so the price average is about 16$ for a meal which isn't TOO high but you can still find cheaper for better.

SERVICE: The service was good and very quick."}
{"text":"I've only had bad experiences at this restaurant - the manager yelled at us to fetch money from the bank two blocks away when their internet connection didn't allow for credit card transactions; a waiter tried to teach me tipping etiquette when I had tipped 10% after receiving horrible, horrible service; and lastly, they brought out the wrong dish after taking an hour for the food to be served and said it is either we eat the dish or wait half an hour for the right one. Not to mention how awefully not authentic this food tastes. Everything is overly sweet or oily. The only appeal to this restaurant is its looks, if that is something that you value more than the experience of having ethnic food itself. 

TL;DR: pricey, non-authentic, over-seasoned food & horrible service."}
{"text":"We went in for lunch on a friend's recommendation and were blown away by the ambiance, the service and the best bibimbap ever!  We can't wait to go  back for dinner."}
