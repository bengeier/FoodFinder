{"text":"Best wings I have ever had in my life!!  I will come back every time I am in town for the wings and Honey Toast...both are frikin amazing!"}
{"text":"We went here on a whim. I think it was their first night open. We went in and say down, even though we weren't \"dressed\" for the client they were evidently looking for. You could tell by the Bentley strategically parked front and center. We didn't let that bother us, its Scottsdale.   We ordered an appetizer which was very tasty. Then we ordered our meal. I ordered a dish with Sashimi, and when our food arrived, it was wrong. We cleared that up and finally got the correct meal. The waiter and chef obviously didn't know the menu as leading us to assume it was the first night open. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive, and the owner even came over and introduced herself.   Not sure this is the right location for this type of dining experience, but I guess time will tell."}
{"text":"AMAZING FOOD!! but other than the fine dining,  But unfortunately, needs new manager.. she seems to be very unprofessional. With my experience, she sits with customers (instead of standing) and talks about herself instead of the restaurant.. but when that's fixed with a new one, this place will be the newest hot spot! i love the concept and the layouts.. amazing!!!  LOVE the cuisines.   the hostesses greeted my wife and I with warming smiles.   the servers are always at your service, and are always bending over backwards for us, as well as the bartenders and bussers.   the owner Rachel is so generous and welcoming   On the other hand... The manager does not dress appropriately and is very rude. My wife and i also caught her yelling at her staff for doing the right thing, which we were ABSOLUTELY APPALLED by.  She clearly doesn't seem to have worked in this industry before. Her attire of stiletto heels and short dresses are not the attire for an elegant restaurant such as this. To say the least, the manager needs to work on respecting her customers and staff.  She needs to work on that if this restaurant wants to continue..   But all in all, GREAT FOOD AND STAFF!  will definitely recommend to my buddies & will be back toon to hopefully see a change!"}
{"text":"Zen Culinary had some very mixed reviews but my son and daughter-in-law decided to try it for ourselves.  At first the location put us off a little, BUT the music is phenomenal and these guys play every night from 5:30-7pm, take requests and come and chat with you on their break, was a fun vibe.  We enjoyed the outside seating and our food was excellent.  I had the Salmon, my son had the Pad Thai and daughter the Pineapple Fried rice with chicken - the presentation was exquisite!  We came away not having noticed the location, definitely tipping the musicians and fully satisfied!  Give them a chance, we thoroughly enjoyed our evening!"}
{"text":"Excellent innovative dishes although service can be slow at times. Their summer rolls with peanut sauce, noodle soups, and curries are quite good."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  The wait staff was so helpful and welcoming.  The food and happy hour drinks selection is awesome.  I ordered the Muay-Thai which was refreshing.  Also excellent full size appetizers.  We munched on the veggie spring rolls, chicken satay, crispy shrimp tempura (yum!), and the organic spinach dip (double yum!!).  Highly recommend this place.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for dinner a few nights ago.  The band was pretty good but too loud for us to sit on the patio which was what we wanted to do.  Otherwise the food is expensive and not that good.  I ordered a pork belly bao for $14.  It came with one very small sandwich and a plate full of tater tots which were room temperature.  But tater tots?  Really?  The sandwich bun was very tough and the meat had little flavor - just salty.  About half way through I was just picking out the meat.  My wife ordered a ramen soup and only ate one half.  The fried rice was really boring.  I will say the spring rolls weren't bad but nothing was worth going back for."}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch, the service was good however I ordered the lunch special which is supposed to come with a spicy tuna roll and a side of either salad or the soup of the day. I didn't like the soup option so I requested the house salad to go with my roll, and they were out of the house salad... at 1:00 in the afternoon... I still opted for the tuna roll which was only 5 pieces and was still charged the $7 for the whole lunch meal. My roll was good however I'm disappointed I was charged for a whole meal that I didn't even receive all the parts to. I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"This was my first time dining at Zen Culinary. Although the food was good, the serving staff attentive and the atmosphere nice, others at my table weren't as impressed.  Appetizers included crispy veggie rolls along with the spinach artichoke dip and salsa with chips. For my entree, I had the salmon with garlic mash potatoes and vegetables.  Would I go back? Probably not. But don't let me stop you. You may have a different experience."}
{"text":"This is our new favorite place to enjoy an amazing meal out.  We tried the chicken satay, Panko spicy tuna roll, tropical mango roll, pad Thai, yellow curry, and the fried banana.  Everything was INCREDIBLE!  The chef is truly talented so please go and try it!"}
{"text":"This place had the best Thai dishes I have ever eaten.  My family ordered the satay chicken appetizers, the Thom kha soup, traditional fries rice and the yellow curry.  Everything was delicious and good size portions.  We even had leftovers!  However, the prices were a little on the higher end. The service was very good.  Although it was quote for a Sunday night, it had a pleasant ambience."}
{"text":"Loved the food.  We went there for Mother's day dinner and sat on the patio near the fire pit.  Loved the d√©cor.  Service was prompt and food came out quickly.  The portions were huge, so didn't mind spending so much on a sushi roll that filled us up.  They had live music which wasn't too loud.  Staff was friendly and attentive.  Decor was classy and comfortable. I appreciated the Mother's Day rose at the end.  Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Open for 4 months and burned through 2 chefs already....?  Owner spent 4 million bucks on the build out and that is evident in the design, but that doesn't qualify her to \"run\" the kitchen.  Food quality has already slipped and the location is a bit deceiving and maybe not as good as it seems.  Plus I'm sure the monthly rent nut is not cheap.    Couple all of that with the fact that El Pollo Loco just built a location right on top of Zen (which makes it hard to see and makes parking tight in an already cramped space) and you have the perfect storm for yet another story about a beautiful restaurant that didn't have the food, service, or leadership to make it in north Scottsdale."}
{"text":"David H. said it perfectly, but after my first trip there, I'd just like to say it myself. I was stunned by the building as I saw it and walked in. Beautifully built and decorated to say the least, and I wasn't ready for that. From front to back, it's nothing but the best you can get. Even the outdoor patios are like no other. You get a feeling of beauty and relaxation with everything you see here. Now, the food. I've been making and eating Thai food for over twenty years, so I know what's out there and have tried it all just about everywhere. The best I've had in Arizona and rivals what you would get in a fine hotel dining room in the best restaurant in Thailand. I was so happy that somebody finally had a chef that could turn out such great Thai dishes. Our food was five stars. The owner, the servers, the place, etc. as well. This is a lesson on how to run a restaurant and make people feel welcome. Period. Easily five stars."}
{"text":"Should have known better when we walked in for lunch and the place was empty.  In short, dishes were not clean, sushi was of low quality, and the service was poor."}
{"text":"Zen is a wonderful night out- from a delightful staff, to excellent food, to the restaurant's inviting ambiance. An outside patio is the perfect setting now that our weather has cooled.   The dishes are spiced right, fresh, and portions are generous.  With so many delicious menu options, I look forward to future visits.  A special note of appreciation to the fine musicians who performed Saturday night. They made our evening exceptional."}
{"text":"Love this place! Has the best atmosphere, the food is Amazing and the staff/service is exceptional! Justin did a great job and the manager was very friendly..My boyfriend and I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here 4 times. The food is phenomenal but the service has been horrible every time."}
{"text":"Zen Culinary is unique: a fantastic pan-Asian restaurant with incredible drinks.  The atmosphere is sophisticated, airy, modern yet comfortable.  The staff is incredibly warm and welcoming.  My husband and I went in on their first night open and had such a good time.  There were sports on the bar screens, lively modern music, and plenty of quiet tables.  We tried a little of everything on the menu, and it was all very well done and plated beautifully.  The spring rolls are out of this world!  I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Probably the most disappointing first impression. A friend and I planned for a week and drove 20 minutes to go to the all-you-can eat sushi rolls on Monday night, we show up thinking there may be a wait, we look around and see plenty of open seats both inside and outside, but come to find out there's a 2 hour wait! The host then tells us the kitchen is backed up. The restaurant was half full yet the kitchen can't keep up? Weird. Especially when you've advertised for this night. Let's see if we give this place another try and they can actually accommodate guests."}
{"text":"So we stopped for a quick bite and a beverage for happy hour! Great selection of wine and the Satay was yummy! We will definitely ne back to try their full Menu. The live music was a nice touch too! RNRWay"}
{"text":"Ordered to go. Food was mediocre. Pho had literally only ten bean sprouts if that. Very oily and gross. Would not eat there again."}
{"text":"I looked forward to trying this new place in Scottsdale and last night called in an order for pick-up, ordering off the menu posted on their website.  I won't be returning. While the hostess was very nice, the meal was a disaster. Upon arriving at the restaurant to pick up my order, the check was $10 more than expected, and when I questioned the price of two entrees I was asked \"What price did you see?\" and then told that they'd raised their prices about a month ago, but the changes to the menus \"hadn't been updated everywhere\". On their own website. The hostess adjusted the check, but I still felt it was rather \"bait & switch\".    I then got home and discovered that the order was incorrect... I'd requested no nuts in the pineapple fried rice (tree nut allergy) and it had nuts. I'd ordered the spicy basil noodles.. but there were no noodles, but instead, rice. The servings were very small, really making the meal overpriced. After I called the restaurant, and spoke with the same hostess, I was told I could get a refund, as long as I drove back to the restaurant to return all the food! This, after being overcharged, and dishes being incorrect especially with a food allergy. I certainly was not happy. I did end up driving back the restaurant, with the food, because I decided my problem could be resolved (with a refund) far easier than the multitude of the restaurant's problems.   I will not recommend this restaurant and will not return in the future."}
{"text":"Great place for weekend dinning. Good setting. Live music. Great food. Love the drangen ball for starter. Dinner plate is big. I am a big guy but I can't finish all. Will come back try more."}
{"text":"Very good food with an excellent atmosphere.  Everything we ordered was delicious and they even have kid sushi for the kids."}
{"text":"The space is great. Nice to have live music. But you come to a restaurant for the food.  The basil chicken was waaaay to salty and the Pad Thai was bland except for the straight up heat from the pepper.  Very disappointed- was hoping for better."}
{"text":"Bad service. Bad sushi. We waited over 45 min to get our sushi and once we got it it was falling apart. Not worth the wait or the price."}
{"text":"I went during the opening few days and did not have a great experience. The food took way too long to come out - about 50 minutes to get 4 dishes. The food was average at best. I would give it a try since I'll give them the benefit of the doubt of being new. I will not be going back for a few months.  Very nice exterior decoration, not so great interior."}
{"text":"Fantastic boat noodles and Pad Thai, sure authentic, reminds me of Thailand hawker. Service and ambience is great, must try."}
{"text":"Zen has all of the necessary ingredients and potential but needs refinement to survive. The building is top notch but the ambience is killed by the office lights emanating from the glass wall from the kitchen. You can't really see the kitchen due to the etching so I'm not sure why the window is open in the first place. Beyond the mood killing florescents, it gives you a nice view of the \"what to do when choking poster\" stainless steel hoods and trash bags.  It looks like they might have live music at times but I was surprised to not have some music swanky fusion music playing in the background     Our seating was delayed for just a moment as we were told the kitchen was running behind. The staff were very nice and ultimately we were served by the bartender. We had the crispy shumai, papaya salad, mango sushi, and green curry. The shu mai were presented nicely but didn't have much flavor and the accompanying soy didn't add much. The papaya salad was a highlight although we needed to request additional spice to give it a kick. The mango sushi was presented beautifully and tasted great. The chef clearly composed the plate with attention to detail.   Despite the strong recommendation from our server, the green curry was uninspiring. An enormous plate with an overturned bowl of plain rice was all that accompanied the bowl of coconut green curry. The curry itself was very tame and sparsely mixed with three small pieces of eggplant, a few ounces of pork and maybe some bamboo shoots?  It was mostly a bowl of coconut curry milk and was way closer to a soup than it should be. For $18 I would've expected some thought towards presentation and plenty of veggies to make it worthwhile. Put another way, it didn't surpass an $8 dollar curry at most stripmall Thai restaurants.   I'm pulling for Zen and hope they put the pieces together."}
{"text":"The location is great and we wanted to love this place. But while the decor is cool and the owners had apparently spent a great deal of time and effort into making this restaurant hip, the food is just OK when we were there for lunch on a couple of occasions. However, it's still new, so we're hoping they'll iron out the kinks and improve. The noodle dishes I tried were somewhat bland and not very authentic in presentation or ingredients. I wish they'd take the time to research what each dish is supposed to be like, put their own twist on them but ensure that it's flavorful. Good luck, Zen! I will try you again soon."}
{"text":"I went here with a friend because we had heard it recently opened. First off, the menu is ridiculous, they are trying to be posh with their names and descriptors but they miss the mark terribly. For example Shumai: open faced dumpling. It was just regular dumpling or their Sashimi Bibimbap, last I checked in Korea it is called Heo Deo Bap. For anyone with any cultural food knowledge this menu is silly.  Anyway, the food was also subpar and definitely not worth the cost. My server kept bugging me the whole time which was annoying. I was there to eat not be asked if I am enjoying my food every 10 minutes. I get they want people to be happy, but know when to tone it down.  Would not eat here again."}
{"text":"The food is AWESOME but the staff and the manager needs to be replaced. BRUTAL service.."}
{"text":"Nice Asian fusion menu.  As a frequent traveler to Asia, the flavors are very authentic.  The lime and coconut is a great drink. Arrive early to get some great happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Beautiful facility and great location. The menu is short and a bit mixed. The ribs were just ok. The salad was unusual beautiful and great. Doubt we will come back sorry."}
{"text":"We popped in on New Year's Eve and wow, were we impressed! The decor was beautiful and the service top notch. The food was delicious and presentation beautiful; for instance the pineapple fried rice was served inside a real pineapple. The chef has some unusual dishes here and I'd highly recommend it. It wasn't very busy but I think that's because not very many people know they are finally open. They really need to get the word out! Plus, the name \"culinary\" is not very consumer friendly. Zen Asian Fusion would be much better."}
{"text":"We went to this shopping center initially to visit another restaurant. That restaurant was sold out for the evening to a convention group, so we decided to drive through the parking lot to see what else was there. What a wonderful serendipity to find Zen Culinary. My SO is a chef, so he's always looking for great places to eat. We felt like we hit a home run.   We often sit at the bar because my SO believes you really get a feel for the place from that vantage point. Our bartender A.J. didn't disappoint. He was charming, knowledgeable, a great server and fun to talk with. We had chosen this restaurant because we could see the baseball game was playing through the windows, and we liked the name. We will now return because we like the food, the staff, the atmosphere and the menu.  I had the poke salad. It was AMAZING. I'm a Hawaii girl so I'm picky about things like poke and ahi. I was a little concerned about where one might source ahi in the desert, but once I tried it I knew the owner/chef knows what she's doing. It was spot on. The salad complemented the ahi poke beautifully. I'm not a great fan of Ponzu dressing and would have liked one of my traditional Hawaiian dressings, but after a bit I decided I liked the way it all went together.  We are already planning a return visit to this restaurant. Definitely recommend it. Also, since I'm in the Hospitality industry as a speaker and trainer, I'm always looking for venues where one might hold a meeting. If you are a corporation looking for a place with large meeting rooms, a great menu and wonderful ambiance, check out Zen Culinary. I would definitely recommend this to my client companies."}
{"text":"Unfortunately this is my first (posted) bad review. Some places are bad, but not enough for me to say anything. Two co-workers and I went here for the first time on our lunch and ordered the sushi. We picked off their lunch menu and each got the Two Roll Combo. Both my co-works got a California Roll and Spicy Tuna Roll, I got a California Roll and Spicy Salmon Roll. I had also ordered the Veggie Spring Rolls to start off with... Let me start by saying this place looks very pleasing to the eye, even the food LOOKED good. We actually weren't that happy with the taste and felt it was pretty \"basic\". Well tragedy hit when we got back to the office because we all got sick! Lucky we did not eat it all so it wasn't as bad as we imagined it would have been if we ate it all. The spring rolls were nice and crunchy on the outside but mushy on the inside. It's safe to say we all agreed NOT to go back."}
{"text":"First time here, terrific ambiance, good music, very good food. We sat at the bar, it wasn't crowded and you'd think the bar tenders would be watching your drink when it was close to empty, to see if you wanted another, but that was not the case... I hope the service improves because this could easily become one of my favorites."}
{"text":"Great find for lunch at Zen Culinary. Once everyone finds out what great food they have for this new restaurant it will undoubtedly be packed for lunch. We tried the wings as an appetizer or and they were delightful with great flavor and a very crispy outside. The flavors and presentation of both the spicy basil noodle dish and the barbecue chicken were fantastic. Just for fun we ordered dessert and had the mango sticky rice. This dessert was surprisingly tasty and light.  I can't say that I have ever had anything quite like it and would definitely order again. Finally the wait staff was very friendly and the establishment had a great field so I look forward to going back some evening."}
{"text":"This is going to hurt, find your safe space and hide.  Initially, I had my concerns considering they didn't spell Bahn Mi correctly on the menu. What is Buhn Mi? It turns out Buhn Mi is Bahn Mi but with french fries and double the price tag. GOOD Bahn Mi costs $4 at Da Vangs. Not here, triple that. Apparently french fries cost $10. The meat was on point though... But that's where it ends. Who serves bahn mi with fries?? Lol.  Other random comments:  I was carelessly served \"water\" that looked like it came from the bottom of a lake.   Appetizers cost the same as meals (upwards of $10) and are undersized for the price.  The projectors over the bar look like a last minute effort to assist with the long wait for food. It was dead... Took 45 minutes to get 1 of 3 meals and another 5-10min for the 2nd and 3rd. Shouldn't you be a little more prepared for a grand opening? The projectors distract from an otherwise modern and sophisticated environment.  You can get better curry in the same parking lot for half the price.  Bottom line: If you don't care about paying for overpriced food, waiting forever to get the food, being disappointed about the food, and crying as you sign the receipt, then this place is for you. I'll pass."}
{"text":"We walked in only to find out - This place is opening Friday December 2nd !!!   They served us anyway !  We had the mango tropical roll - hot wings, Korean hummus and miso cracker jacks ! What a culinary experience this was !  The head sushi chef - Danial relocated from New York !  He is extremely talented !  Do yourself a favor and check this place out !"}
{"text":"Beautiful chique atmosphere.  Service was wonderful.  General Manager Christina and Phil were very hospitable and welcoming.  Highly recommend this place for your next North Scottsdale outing...Rachel the owner makes all the eclectic dishes herself.  Excellence..."}
{"text":"Gee, what a shocker! I can't believe this place is closed! The food tasted like shit, but the decorations were nice. This place needed Gordon Ramsay. This is just like the kind of place that you would have seen on kitchen nightmares. You know, the kind of place where the Owner / Chef is in denial about their food."}
{"text":"I stopped in here the other night, on my own, with a Groupon, and was treated well to some terrific food. Had the dragon balls (luscious) and the coconut curry custard--strange name and not your usual curry (it's whte), but simply delicious and a satisfying treat. Looking forward to a return visit with friends to try some other items, so the Groupon did its job."}
{"text":"While the place was nearly empty, it seemed like it took forever to get our food. My chicken Pad Thai was too spicy for me to eat so I ended up taking most of it in a to-go box to give to someone else. Lastly, my server was running around from table to table and we were never asked about how our food was, if we needed a refill on our water, or anything else that I would expect from a restaurant with similar prices."}
{"text":"It's a great addition to the shopping center. Weston was such a boss hosting us at the bar for a great time for me and my brother, with excellent drinks and food that didn't disappoint.   The space itself has a great vibe, with colors popping out of a largely black decor. At Sunday dinner, the crowd consisted of one other table. Don't let that scare you - Weston told us this was their second Sunday ever or something, so not a lot of people know, but  apparently their lunch was packed.  Luckily I slipped into the tail end of happy hour, so I could get a cheaper drink. The Tsu-namaste was a great fruity drink that brought me back to the coast - love the shochu and rum together. And my bro ordered the Protagonist - basically as close are you're gonna get to an Asian Sazerac. We also had samples of some really nice Asian whiskies, and we wish we could've stayed longer to try them all!  For apps we had shrimp tempura and honey toast based on recommendations, and Dragon Balls because Goku lol. Tempura was solid. The toast was super savory - don't expect the dessert tall puffy toast you'll see at some boba cafes. Between that and the balls they were a little greasy, but the ground meat mixture was noticeably there for the bite. They're not the most cost effective, so I might hold out on them for happy hour pricing.  I ordered the Spicy Basil Noodle with added shrimp, which was I was super happy with. Ordered it spicy, which it certainly was, and basically got a great savory Pad Thai without that extra sugar I'm always hesitant about. My friend ordered the Pork Belly Ramen, and surprisingly it was really good! The broth had a great depth of flavor, and sadly beat out a lot of the ramen-specialized joints in the area. We actually swapped halfway through the meal because we loved both and couldn't decide!  Prices might be a little scary for some, but from we had we were very satisfied. Definitely coming back for happy hour drinks, because cocktails are hard to find great in North Scottsdale, and hopefully will try out more of their menu too!"}
{"text":"Newer restaurant... Good looking building with beautiful interior and decor.  Service was fair, but was surprised we didn't get a little more attention since they weren't that busy.  Menu had a good selection and the food was great... Asian fusion.  Hope they make a go of it."}
{"text":"Service was poor and there were very few customers. Servers did not know about the ingredients. Pineapple rice had no flavor.    Curry dishes were mostly liquid/soup. Sushi rice was cold / not fresh.  Disappointed all around."}
{"text":"FABULOUS place for a happy hour, first date, etc.  The ambiance, particularly on the patio, is wonderful!  Service was very attentive and the food was amazing.  Try the BBQ Chicken Bao on the happy hour menu or the tuna tataki salad on the dinner menu."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Excellent food, amazing service and a gorgeous atmosphere! It's def a must visit!!!"}
{"text":"Really an overall great experience here from food, service, and ambiance.  In my opinion, it would be a mistake to go with sushi or intuitively go for the obvious asian dishes.  We heard to try the barbecue route and we were very lucky that we did!  The lemongrass chicken dish and the baby back ribs are absolutely delicious and I guarantee that if you go with both of those you won't be disappointed.  Our server was Zach and he was awesome, so hopefully you luck out with him as he was personable and made the dining experience as good as it gets.  Also, there is live music from \"the twins\" and they do a great job.  I'm pretty sure they were having as much fun playing as we were listening.  I really think this place deserves tons of business and sticks around because it was FAR better than the 3 1/2 stars it has on here."}
{"text":"Poor service! I was at the front patio and bar for 45 minutes and never got waited on. It was not overly busy either.  Disappointing! I will pass on Zen Culinary every time.  Christina, I sent an email to the email address on your website.  Your more than welcome to reply. Regardless I'm done with Zen Culinary."}
{"text":"This place was REALLY good!! i'm a big thai and asian food fanatic and it's hard to find good food sometimes! we had sashimi (very fresh!) and pad see ewe. Both were delicious and great service! i have to say it was a little over priced ($15 for simple fried rice?), and the atmosphere makes it hard to hear. everything echoes so i could hear conversations from the couple across the room. but we will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Best kept Scottsdale Secret:  Zen is my favorite new place.  They have one of the best Happy Hour menus in the city.  I can't wait to go back for dinner and lunch and another happy hour LOL.    It's a little out of the way but totally worth the drive. What I loved most was how welcoming they were to my husband and I.  You can just tell that they value every customer."}
{"text":"Presentation is ON POINT.  Food was great- quality, quantity. We were greeted and sat immediately and our server was awesome! The happy hour menu has some good items on there. Overall, good experience but the pricing is a little high."}
{"text":"Loved this place. Tuesday $1 drafts are awesome.  The service of the bartending staff could not have been better. Had 3 items off the happy hour menu. Highly recommend Pork Belly  Bao."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here for the first time and I will definitely go back. Great food, beautiful decor, not a single complaint. Try it out you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"My coworker and I came here for lunch today because Thai House (across the parking lot) was jam packed. We saw this place the last time we went to Thai House so we figured we would give it a try.  When we first walked in, there were only two other tables there. I think it was about 11:45 a.m. and we were told they opened earlier this month.   The menu could use some work. I was really hoping to see some more adventurous dishes but nope! I'm also not sure what is \"Asian Fusion\" on the menu because the dishes were Asian, but just different parts of Asia. We ordered the Panang Chicken and the Spicy Basil Noodles because that was what we were craving from Thai House. The only fusion I really noticed was the decor - a mixture of rustic hipster lighting with a mixologist bar, some Asian-inspired art and vintage European red velvet booths. There is also a grand piano inside... Attempt to look upscale?  The Panang Chicken was good but you could get it for half the price across the parking lot. I was expecting the Spicy Basil Noodles to be similar to Pad Se Ew - I was wrong. First off, it wasn't even spicy... Not sure if the chefs know this but you need to pull the noodles apart by hand to separate them before cooking them in the wok. Otherwise, you get broken up chunks of noodles that don't seem like noodles - more like stir fry... which is what we had. The taste was okay but it was a disappointment.   I'm going to assume that the kitchen is still learning because it took a while for us to get our food even though there were only 2 other tables. The wait staff was nice but they could use a little more training - I felt like they were a little stiff and unsure. Our dishes were never cleared away either.   Not sure if this place will last honestly. The area is better known for a lunch crowd but maybe after work happy hours will keep it alive. By the way, the lunch menu consists of three sushi options - needs more variety. In my personal opinion, there was nothing exciting or new about the menu. They are all items that can be found at other restaurants. Was there even dessert? We were never offered any and I didn't see it on the menu.  I will have to give it another try later on. Probably for happy hour drinks. Is there a happy hour? Alright, maybe just for drinks."}
{"text":"Zen has become my favorite new restaurant. This place also has Good Feng Shui and atmosphere. Great menu with exceptional sushi and Asian dishes. My favorite is the Thai Noodle Boat Beef Soup. The Shaomai are also outstanding. The staff is friendly and service is good and not too pricy."}
{"text":"This is our second time here. We first came a few weeks ago before their official grand opening.  The food was very good and so was the service.  We also were almost the only ones there.   This time being now officially open there were many more people.  The food was still very good. The service however not so much. Food coming out of the kitchen was at a snails pace. Several of the people around us were complaining about the  long ticket times.   This is a shame because everything else is great. The menu has many interesting things. The food is as I said very good and the decor is perfect.    I will come back at least one more time but I will wait a month or so to see if they can figure things out. I sure hope they do."}
{"text":"Very modern decor on the inside and nice front patio. Bartenders are another story. I was there with a large group and only 3 physical bartenders but in reality 1.5 bartenders. Took along time to get drinks and   they charged me full price for my wine vs the happy hour pricing. Note to managers....don't have new people training when you have a group of 60+ people in. I don't think I would go back on my own."}
{"text":"Awesome food and 1/2 off wine on sundays...yes please! The pad Thai is amazing and the sushi is really fresh"}
{"text":"This place is really REALLY good!!!  Sooo FRESH and flavorful/-- we HIGHLY recommend it!!!  Great atmosphere, service and food!!!!"}
{"text":"Zen Culinary is all style and no substance. My coworkers and I visited for lunch today as our favorite authentic Thai place had a wait out the door and we were pressed for time. The interior walks a fine line between between tacky and chic. The hostess was barely audible and managed a thin smile. Zen Culinary is in a highly developed and thriving business corridor. At noon the dining room was at 15-20% capacity. This should have told us everything we needed to know.   The waiter preformed at novice level. We mentioned we were on our lunch break after waiting five minutes to be greeted. Sodas and water soon followed. He spilled water all over the floor and my ankle whilst refilling our glasses.   Two of my companions ordered chicken sandwiches, one with miso soup and the other tots. My friend and I both had the yellow curry, one with pork and the other with chicken. The miso soup came out first with soup around the the saucer. It was extremely salty. The chicken sandwiches came next, bland and slathered with butter. Both of my dining companions had to wipe off the excess butter. A few minutes later our curries came out. A huge plate with a scoop of rice and a cereal bowl with curry. The portion looked so small! I asked for mine to be very spicy. It was close to flavorless. The pork was done well. There were about 6 small slices of vegetable and a few large potatoes. The curry was rather thick. I can look past bland food cooked well but cannot over look under cooked rice. It was extra crispy! One would think an Asian inspired eatery would master rice before attempting anything else.  If you're looking for authentic Thai cuisine--walk out the door and across the parking lot to the real Thai restaurant. You can't miss it--there's usually a line out the door!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, even pretty good, but I simply did not think that the quality matched the price.  I had some salmon sushi that was fresh and yummy - but not $16 yummy.  My wife had the Banh Mi sandwich, which she said was OK but no great shakes.  We have had better Banh Mi for like $5 instead of $12. Great atmosphere and a very friendly staff - we just did not think it was the right value considering the price."}
{"text":"When we entered, we were immediately greeted with smiles from the hosts and escorted to our table. Our waiter, Evan, was absolutely outstanding from the very beginning. He was very professional, polite, and super friendly! We ordered the Chicken Fried Rice, Chicken Pad Thai, and Pad See Eww and all were delicious. Big portions too! Throughout the night, there was live music which set a great mood in the restaurant. We were also greeted by the General Manager who was SO sweet! She gave us the Fried Banana with Ice Cream....so so good. Fun and hip restaurant with great service and great authentic food."}
{"text":"Overpriced food. My 2 year old nephew can cook a steak better. Crappy service. Not very attentive and the restaurant was empty."}
{"text":"What a lovely suprise! I probably had the best waiter in my entire restaurant going career! Great service with good food! I had chicken pad Thai - tasty! I will certainly be back here."}
{"text":"I'm not sure this place is going to make it. The service was terrible and the food is fair and expensive for what you get. The building and atmosphere are pretty and well done but it's going to have to step it up a notch if it's going to survive the summer."}
{"text":"I thought this place was great. The live music was a nice touch in a Monday. The patio was great with a pretty fire pit. We had the Yellow chicken curry, that was amazing. We also did the beef ramen and Korean ribs. The ramen was more like a pho but even better. I really enjoyed everything, and the server was great. Only down fall is if you are a champagne drinker I don't think they go through enough bottles to keep them still bubbly. My two glasses I got were very flat. The other mixed drinks were great. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Neat build out! Very nice interior.  But hey, that's not really what you want to know, is it?  Zen is a new Asian fusion spot in North Scottsdale.  Nice variety of menu options.  Want sushi?  No problem. Ramen?  Gotcha covered Thai curries?  Yup! Banh mi?  You betcha  We started with the Tuna Mango Poke and Shumai The Tuna Mango Poke portion was a bit small to share 5 ways - but that's not surprising for an appetizer, right?  The Shumai was tasty and easily shared (and our exchange student from Japan was excited to find it on the menu - a taste of home!)  Four of us ordered curries (3 panangs and 1 yellow).  The curries were all tasty! One ordered the Sashimi Bi Bim Bap - pretty good, but she decided she wished she had gone with Ramen.  One thing - the plating...maybe look at smaller plates/bowls.  The Bi Bim Bap was difficult to eat, being so far down in a deep and wide bowl.  The rice that went with the curries was served on huge square plates...no room on the table for big bowls and big rice plates.  We had a good time and everything was tasty...looking forward to going back and trying some other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"LOVE the food and the Thai coffee is AMAZING!!! Tasha was a pleasure to talk to... Warm and inviting! Cant wait to come back and enjoy all of the above! I expected the people to be cold and the prices to be expensive. Not the case! Thank you, Tasha for making this an awesome experience!"}
{"text":"Wow! Had the Pad Thai! It was amazing! Atmosphere is beautiful too, great place for happy hour or date night! Service was top notch! This place should be way busier! But I like the personal service. They even have big screen TVs! So you can eat great food and still see the game!"}
{"text":"Hidden Scottsdale Spot! Always a fun live band and great bar scene. Love their happy hour and brunch specials. If you are looking for a fun experience and good food - come here. Their salmon lover roll is so fresh and delicious. Always a repeat and happy customer"}
{"text":"Great food, good service. Been coming here since they opened and mostly get take outs. The best Tom Kha soup in the valley."}
{"text":"This place is so cool. I love the vibe. The food is actually affordable. I got a $7 lunch special with a salad. The staff is friendly. I was to sit outside with the wooden \"windows\" cracked opened. It was perfect! It's a new daily lunch spot for me."}
{"text":"Had the Pineapple Fried Rice. Beautiful presentation!! It was yummy with plenty of shrimp, cashews, bell peppers, and delicious chunks of pineapple!! Had the Lime Coconut drink with Vodka instead of Tequila.  Fun sounding the Gong as you leave!!"}
{"text":"Too many other establishments in this city for the \"common restaurant\". There was truly nothing positve or anything worth pointing out."}
{"text":"The food was very good the service was wonderful and manager Tasha was so sweet and so helpful and awesome."}
{"text":"The curry is life changing! The service is great, the manager super sweet and always greets us. The $5.00 noodle bowls on Sunday are so yummy. They just remodeled and the dining area has super cozy sofas. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Everything that we ordered was absolutely delicious. A standout out and definite must have is the pineapple fried rice. It comes served in an actual pineapple and is great to share with everyone at the table. The prime rib eye soft, succulent and HUGE. In fact I think the best way to eat here is for everyone at your table to order something different and then just share everything. That way you can sample a little bit of everything from their very long list and varieties of food. Cocktails were scrumptious too. I can't remember the name of the one that comes to share that has a fire in the middle, but def delicious and makes for a good photo op too. They had a live soft jazz band the day and from what I understand they usually always do. The space itself is very beautiful as well too and laid out to accommodate parties of any size. When my family comes into town, I am definitely bringing them here. Hope this review was helpful. Enjoy ^___^"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere  - live music performers that take requests.  Outdoor and indoor seating. Large portions, two meals for each order.    Only negative,  Not many beers on tap,  we ordered three times before we got a beer listed that they actually had on tap :("}
{"text":"Now, this is what I'm talking about! Great service, great food, and pretty much great everything else. This place is most def a hidden gem. The location is almost perfect. Right there on that corner next to El Pollo Loco, it doesn't really look like much, but once inside you'll see this place is very spacious, comfortable, classy, & beautiful. But all that pales in comparison to the hostess. And to be sincere, Tasha will be the first thing you'd actually notice. That lady is on point. She's welcoming, enthusiastic and kind. She has an smile from ear to ear, and handles herself as if she has a personal interest in making this one of the best spots in Phoenix. But I tell you this place does have that potential. It is a great spot for anything! They got comfort food  ( I mean, French fries and ribs... On a Thai place... C'mon!!). But they also got the classic Thai dishes. The portions & flavors just hit the spot. This place is great for groups, family, dating night. And if it's not enough they got live music. Piano night, ladies night. I love finding a comfy spot to just hang and eat good. I would love to keep it a secret, but Most def... Everyone should give it a try!! :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love Zen Culinary!!!!  What an awesome place. I have ate here several times and will continue to come back.   Let's start off with the decor. The inside is beautiful and the buildout of the restaurant was done with class all the way. I have sat at the bar and the booths and one thing I can appreciate is the comfort when enjoying my meal. In my opinion it is key to have good seating and they got it right. The 3 projection screens at the bar is very nice and I can watch it from afar as well. The piano and love music is a nice touch and must go see. Seriously thru go live music daily which is fantastic and fun for something different. The patio has been very nice and good for large groups or to just enjoy the cool weather.   Let's get up on the food. I have had the panang curry twice with a level 3 spicy which is there hottest and it is the perfect amount of heat. I have had sushi, the chicken satay with the cucumber chutney wow that stuff is awesome and they have a huge full bar with pretty much any drink you can imagine. When I go I always hear people talking about how great the food is and I need to start trying new things and I will. The prices during lunch and happy hour are more than reasonable. Dinner prices are great for dates or friends.   The owner and staff are very friendly. I've never experienced anything but great service here and that is another reason to return. I like new, fresh, and modern places and Zen got it. I will be back and trying new things."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere it has comfortable seating with a hip vibe. The music during happy hour was spirited but not overwhelming. The drinks were perfect and inexpensive and the service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Omg  I saw an ad in the Scottsdale magazine airpark today for zen it said it had a reverse happy hour  from 9 until 10 ... perfect i work until 9 I'll head there after work when I got there I found parking right out front I walked in the bar was packed .... good for them , bad for me , there were two young ladies at the front desk , I said do you guys have reversed happy hour going ??? They looked at each other very puzzled  I said do you have a happy hour from 9 until 10 ??? They still seemed very confused and were digging around under the desk I'm not quite sure what they were looking for, after another awkward 20 seconds I said never mind I was to tired  to deal with a packed bar and confused employs........... mngt please inform your youthful people what a reverse happy hour is"}
{"text":"Even a very enthusiastic wait staff can't make up for mediocre food and a discombobulated kitchen.  Zen tries to hard to specialize in too many different cuisines and excels at none of them.  Thai soups are bland, pad thai while plentiful lacks authentic taste.  Chicken wings ... wait -- what the hell are fried chicken wings doing in a Pan Asian craft cocktail bar.  Sushi was nothing special and definitely overpriced.  In fact, everything was very overpriced for what you get.  While Zen could appease multiple palates if no one in your party can agree on what to eat for dinner, the fact that nothing is overwhelmingly exceptional dominates over everything else.  If you want Thai, there are great Thai places in N. Scottsdale - one right across the parking lot from Zen.  If you want great sushi, there are plenty of options close by.  If you want steak and fish, the same holds true.  If you want chicken wings and burgers, there are several sports bars close by.  If Zen is going to survive in the very competitive restaurant market in N. Scottsdale, particularly at their price point, they will need to do a major menu overhaul and limit themselves to one or two genres which they really master.  If they don't, keep an eye out for a sale of restaurant furniture and fixtures in the place that Zen Culinary used to be."}
{"text":"The food was so bad. TWe ordered Satay chicken, pork bao, wonton noodle soup, spicy chicken ramen and thai spicy chicken noodle soup. Satay and the bao were ok, edible. The soups were just horrible. I did not know what the heck i ate. They did not taste like how they were supposed to taste. Not even close. And on the menu, it said the soup had bean sprouts, seaweed and stuff...nothing was in the soup, except noodles, soup and meat. Very disappointing.  The service was also super slow. I had a reservation at 1845. I didn't get seated until 1900. The food didn't come out closer to 2000. I guess they were understaffed. However, all the staff was very nice and they tried very hard to please everybody - the only plus point."}
{"text":"Can you say amazing!? Just tried this place for the first time and had an assortment of yumminess. Must try: vegan nine roll, honey toast, wings, and chicken satay. All of the sauces were phenomenal. The fish was fresh and tasty, and the staff was superb. Our server, \"Kevin without a 'k' \" (Evan) closed our service by calling us by name and saying that we are welcome to request him In the future and he would be happy to serve us  PLUS: They have live music every day after 5 AND reverse happy hour"}
{"text":"There are so many great places to eat in Scottsdale and this is not one of them.  The staff was awkward and the food was very bland.  Not what we were expecting from a place with \"culinary\" in the name."}
{"text":"Great food great flavor nice atmosphere live music nightly! A must try! The Thai dishes are gourmet as they are authentic full of fresh flavors."}
{"text":"I always like to try new places when they open so when I saw Zen I wanted to try it. Great addition to this shopping center since there isn't much else in here that is worth while. I got the curry pork and it was fabulous. The owner/manager was a very active part of this restaurant and helped the waitstaff which I love to see   Fair price point for lunch. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I went there today for their first ever $5 dollar noodle bowl Happy Hour! I will be honest, before walking in, I was expecting a very selective menu of noodle dishes but I was pleasantly surprised by their menu that offered 13 different types ( 2 vegetarian) of noodle bowls. I went with the Crispy Tofu vegetarian bowl, which was probably the most delicious vegetarian+noodley+soupy bowl dish I have ever had! I sat at the bar and the bartender, David was very nice and helpful with drink selections. They are going to do this $5 dollar noodle bowl every Sunday from 11:00am-7:00 pm along with their Happy hour. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"I note that this is a newly opened restaurant and might be still working things out. My review is only based on one lunch visit.  Zen is a beautiful new restaurant with Modern Classy decor that's also Asian. A baby grand piano  sits at the far end of the restaurant and an unusual modern waterfall flows down a window. Parts of the restaurant are open and airy.  The menu they gave me was mostly all Asian Dishes that seemed mostly but not all Thai and Japanese. They also offered a few salads and entrees that might be Modern American Fare, some with Asian Inspired Flavors that go up to $56.00 in price.  We shared the Sushi Lunch and Chicken Basil.  The Sushi Lunch came with a fresh tossed salad seasoned with Asian Vinaigrette. The salad was fresh and delicious. The sushi was 6 pieces and included a spicy tuna roll. All the fish was clean tasting but the sushi wasn't seasoned under the fish like better sushi places make it. The tuna roll was spicy but to us was heavy with mayo. I asked for fresh wasabi and the grated wasabi they gave me was VERY GOOD! (additional)  The Chicken Basil was Good! Slightly sweeter than some other places make it... with a caramel brown sugar kind of taste to it but good. I liked the good tasting heat in it. But the meal didn't come with the fried egg noted on the menu. At the time we felt cheated. We weren't checked on until we were finished with the dish to tell anyone. The manager told us that the meal was made correctly and the fried egg is only added at dinner time. The manager  GENEROUSLY took the meal off our bill. We felt better then but noticed the table behind us got different service with the waiter telling them how delicious and amazing the spring rolls are (we didn't get a menu with spring rolls) and they were given another menu page we didn't get and then sort of felt cheated again.   Well anyways-  Typos do happen but are very easy to fix. They have been open a week now. To prevent customers from feeling cheated they should FIX THE TYPO(S).  Solution #1 Simply cross off the Crispy Fried Egg on the menu.  Solution #2 Train the servers to tell the guest that the meal won't be coming with a fried egg.  This restaurant really has a lovely atmosphere and patio. The dinners on the menu sound great. They are opening with some growing pains. Your experience may differ."}
{"text":"This is the best Asian food in Scottsdale. I was out visiting from the Bay Area so my expectations were not high but I was pleasantly surprised.  The friend chicken wings with sweet and sour sauce were probably the best wings I've ever had in my life. We also had the spicy basil noodles with beef which were fantastic and the Pad Thai with shrimp was my favorite noodle dish.  The deserts are all worth the calories but if I had to choose one the chocolate cake would be it (definitely plan on sharing it!) I also tried the sweet beginnings cocktail with gin and coconut milk and the bad panda ale. The cocktail was a little sweet (as the name implied) for me but my girlfriend loved it.  I will definitely be bringing friends back here next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty new dishes, really friendly staff. Super cool design and flow, great atmosphere and menu! Will def be back, lots of authentic but new school asian dishes."}
{"text":"As many others have commented recently, do not go on Monday for all you can eat sushi as the service and experience is a complete disaster to say the least. I had gone several times previously on other nights when there were no specials and had a great time, but they either simply no longer care or do not know how to operate on evenings they run specials. I told myself I was not going to write a negative review and simply contact them to voice my concerns, but after reaching out to them 3 days ago and getting no response I find myself even more disappointed. I reached out voicing my concerns and simply looking for an apology but their lack of guest service and desire to keep business is concerning. So long for all the recommendations and referrals I have previously given them.   To sum up a horrible experience they quoted me an hour long wait when the restaurant was half full. I informed them I had made a reservation, which they then proceeded to seat us. After waiting a while for a server we got one and decided we were ready to order. We told him we were there for the all you can eat sushi and his immediate response was do not do it they are backed up and the wait will be over 40 minutes for each roll. He stated if we order an entree from the kitchen the wait would only be 5 minutes. I knew 5 minutes sounded fast, but I knew what he was getting at. We instead told him to give us a minute to discuss. I greatly appreciate his honesty and I know none of this was his fault, but that was disappointment that we came specifically for sushi and that was what was told to us.   Okay fine so we both order a regular entree and decide to put the rest behind us. Server stops by to let us know the food will be out shortly and things are really looking up. I ordered the pineapple rice bowl which I have come to love and my girlfriend ordered the seabass. After about 25 - 30 minutes a gentlemen (presumed to be a manager) comes out with only the pineapple rice. He states they had issues cooking the seabass and did not feel comfortable serving it. He immediately informed us that he would be taking care of comping the pineapple rice and whatever new option my girlfriend wanted as making a new seabass was not an option. My girlfriend had originally debated between the seabass and the duck so she immediately responded back that she would have the duck. The gentlemen responded back as to appear like he did not even know duck medallions was on the menu. He asked if she wanted something besides that as well or to see a menu. At this point we simply ordered the salmon. Okay so now I am faced with my entree while I wait for my girlfriends entree to come out. We attempt to share the pineapple rice and needless to say the quality was far from what I remembered it the last time I had it. To start with the dish was served room temperature at best as if it has been sitting around for a long time. The taste was definitely off as well. When the salmon finally came out I was surprised to notice the skin still on it. No big deal as I have seen places do that, but what was concerning was the salmon was burnt on the outside and extra rare on the inside. I am assuming because they were rushing to get it out to her, but we would have gladly waited longer for something that was edible.  Combined the two of us picked on whatever we could manage as we were hungry and that was it. Not sure if we would have vocalized out complaint on the salmon, but we never even got asked how the salmon was to really make such a decision.  Overall a horrible and expensive night on what should have been a wonderful night out. I understand mistakes happen and issues arise but there was no sympathy the evening we were there. After reaching out to them via email and phone call I have not heard anything back from them. Again a simply apology and desire to show you care and want the business would be appreciated. They definitely opened well, but since then just declined."}
{"text":"So let's start at the beginning- as soon as we walked in we were greeted with a warm Namaste, a big smile and the music of the very decent 2 piece band they had playing. We were seated right away and the restaurant is lovely. Beautifully decorated and a far cry from the Mexican restaurant that used to be there. Everyone from the server to the hostess were very friendly and efficient. I can't fault the effort. On to the food and beverages - we were given water but unfortunately there must be something wrong with the the dishwasher because the glasses were very spotty and had a film on the outside that felt slightly gritty ( something wrong with the rinse cycle). I couldn't drink out of it. I ordered the coconut lime cocktail and it tasted like a margarita with a float of coconut cream. It was yummy and I would order it again. That glass also could have been cleaner. Happy hour Panko roll.  4 pieces of a lightly Fried spicy tuna roll. Tasty but 4 pieces!? So the price is cheaper but you also only get 1/2 a roll. My husband and I shared green curry and pad Thai - the curry was served in a huge bowl to hold all the sauce, but the sauce was too thin and the chicken over cooked. The ratio of sauce to stuff was way out of wack. Flavor was ok, bland for Thai food but I do want to applaud the use of real Thai eggplant. That's a rare find.  Pad Thai - I wish I would have taken a picture. It was a tangled ball of noodles that had to be pulled apart in large clumps. My description sounds worse than it was but it's an accurate review. Again flavor was ok but bland by Thai standards. My opinion coincides with the majority here and I hope the management/kitchen takes note. The restaurant itself is very pretty and comfortable so it would be a shame if it didn't make it for the long haul"}
{"text":"Have been here numerous times and previously loved the curry. Went this past Thursday during lunch. Wasn't too busy, but that's where things went downhill. We were quickly seated and given drinks. After reviewing the menu we had to flag the waiter to get orders taken. Ordered the lunch specials with salads. We waited for at least 30 minutes after ordering on salads which never came.  Numerous tables were served as we continued to wait. Had to ask for an ice tea and water refill. After asking for food again we were told it's five more minutes. The bill was promptly placed on the table-with no compensation for wait. After more waiting we needed to leave for an appointment. We spoke to the waiter who said not to worry about the tea. As we left, we also explained our story to the person in charge. She asked if we had any thing to drink and then told us to pay for the ice tea. We explained that we didn't feel that we should after the service issues. She threatened to call the police on us! It doesn't seem that they have figured out the lunch service yet. Unfortunately, we will not be returning to a place that threatens us."}
{"text":"Great foods, great service, and nice presentation. I had the curry custard and it was very yummy. I was hoping to bring the coconut home but that didn't happen. Would b nice to keep my leftovers in the coconut (w a branded logo), what a great way to advertise their restaurant?"}
{"text":"Went for dinner, sat at the bar the drinks were soso...ordered food I asked for beef curry food arrived it was chicken curry.  If I go again it'll be just to give them a 2nd chance."}
{"text":"My expectations and experience were quite different. I had the happy hour pork sandwich. The pork was awesome! However, the bread was very difficult to work with and consume. The wings were unique in the sauce utilized but the sesame infused ranch dressing was a strange combination and did not compliment the sauce on the wings at all.   I want to state that is only my perception. Others may love this marriage of flavors. At some point soon I will bring  some friends with me and get their opinion. The setting is beautiful and the wines are priced right. The Happy Hour menu is creative and lends to many a palate.  It is located in a fun strip mall of off the 101 that has everything you could imagine. I reccomend that you try it for yourself and tabulate your own findings. #vino2ultimate #vino2 #vinosquared"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant and hope it is here to stay. It is a really classy joint. They put a ton of money into it and you can tell by the finishes. It feels like it would be better placed at Scottsdale Quarter or Kierland. It has that kind of feel.   Food is awesome.  I have been once for lunch and a second time for dinner. Took my wife when we went for dinner and she really liked it too. She is a Scottsdale princess and hard to please.  The fact she liked it is quite a testament.   I've had the pad Thai, spring rolls, chicken wings, pork belly ramen and pineapple fried rice. All exceptional. Great happy hour too. Go there. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place as it is so dang adorable from the exterior, so I recommended to a group of friends that we try it one day for lunch. Unfortunately, the adorable design of this place was where the charm ended. The waiter knew nothing about the menu that waiters should know (i.e. \"What's good here?\" Or \"How's the such-and-such?\"). He literally responded, \"I haven't tried much of the food here.\" Wow. I asked if it would be a possibility to add chicken to one of their salads. He looked at me blankly and said, \"I'm not sure.\" Did not offer to go ask the kitchen or anyone higher up, but just kept staring at me blankly. My friend chimed in and asked him if he could please go ask someone to find out the answer to this question, and so he did. I got my salad (chicken added), and while the taste of the salad was decent, there were far too many wilted pieces of lettuce in my salad to call it \"fresh\" or make it very appetizing :/ I had to keep pulling out the bad pieces to set them aside. My friend I was with had a hair in his food, y other friend said her sushi wasn't the freshest (I cannot attest as I am not a sushi fan), and no one was too impressed with their meal. Super bummer... Will not be back."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch at this relatively newcomer to the local eating scene.  The physical plant is beautiful. Well laid out and plenty of room.  The service was very friendly, courteous and prompt.  I tried the lunch special (the sashimi) and was delighted with the flavors. It's a combination of chopped up sashimi resting on a bed of sushi rice and greens and veggies. An innovative approach to sashimi. This also came with a house salad.  My only complaint is that the dish did not have enough sashimi. But then it was $12.  Overall a good experience and I plan to return for dinner."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. Its pretty new and the food is amazing. I was in there on Wednesday night with some friends and we decided to sit at the bar. The bartender was a pretty young girl named Rocky. She was very friendly and knowledgeable of the entire menu.  She recommended some sushi appetizer called Hako Zushi and it was absolutely amazing. We also ordered the shumai, and Dragon balls as apps. Both delish.  For dinner we ordered the pad tai and the curry. Both delicious.  Rocky is a great bartender. Our waters were never less than half full. She was super friendly and we will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"HOLY MOLY! I almost don't want to review this place just because I want it to be a secret. I rarely fight through the food coma to write reviews of experiences the day of- but Zen Culinary was so exceptional I just have to. I went tonight with a friend who shall be referred to here on out as BFF.  First impression: This place looks so awesome! The decor is sophisticated, fun, and cool. The cute patio seating is in the front of the restaurant with a nice fire pit. I definitely want to hang out there next time I'm in. There is a long bar down the right side of the restaurant that opens up into a larger dining area.   The drinks: Their happy hour menu is killer. Apparently I wanted to go hard on a Monday night happy hour because I ordered a Sazerac {Rye Whiskey | Cognac | Peychaud's bitters | Absinthe rinse}. My friend ordered a French 75 {Gin | lemon | cane sugar | orange bitters | brut} both for $9. My drink had a great smoky flavor that caught me by surprise at first- but I would definitely order again (definitely to see the fire!). The French 75 was light and refreshing. We also got a complimentary cocktail bowl thing (Red Scorpion, I think) that was delicious and beautiful! 151 set aflame with nutmeg!  The food: I hadn't eaten all day and thus was starving TO DEATH. So we just went straight for the entrees. I ordered the duck breast and BFF ordered the spicy basil noodle. Friends, this was the BEST duck I have ever had! It was beautifully presented alongside cauliflower risotto, ginger carrot puree, spinach, and snap peas. The apple cider gastrique added the most amazing flavor. The duck was cooked perfectly- deliciously crisp and fatty, just how it should be. I was literally scraping my plate to get everything. The spicy basil noodle was TDF as well.   The service: Awesome, fun, attentive, and friendly. All things you want in a dining experience. Everyone said hello to us when we walked by and checked in on our food and drinks to make sure we were happy.  This was one of the best dining experiences I have had in AZ in a while. I will be telling everyone to GO HERE!"}
{"text":"I came here 6 days after their grand opening to celebrate my work place achievement and we were very pleased with quality of food we had for lunch.  I was looking for some nice lunch place to take my team, and knew it had to be somewhere to satisfy foodie colleagues, I thought this newly opened place will be perfect.  Inside this restaurant is very gorgeous. I thought this place will be ideal for after work get together.   Since our server and actually everyone else is new, I would say server was still learning about their restaurant. He knew about the menu but not to the level I asked. I did end up talking to both chefs at the end and food served made sense. A main chef is from Thai and another is originally from Korea. Based on menu availability, that was my guess and we ordered accordingly. All the food we ordered was really tasty and well flavored.   Fried rice made by Korean chef tasted like real fried rice should taste, curry had authentic curry flavor, poke had good taste and fish was fresh. Curry came with small serving of rice, we ended up with extra curry sauce and was told later by the chef that I should have asked for more rice...   Portion size was rather small for the price you pay. In fact, everything was a tad pricey. If not for that special occasion, it won't be my regular lunch place. I guess we pay for the ambiance?   I really liked their food. Although server was slow but it was shortly after grand opening. I would wait just bit more before coming back to try some of their interesting menu options."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really nice and the interior design is tastefully done.   The quality of the food did not quite match up.  Fish on sushi was not fresh and had fishy taste and odor.  Appetizer was very good.   Our server was very sweet and tried very hard to keep our drinks filled and was attentive the entire time."}
{"text":"Decide to check this place out for lunch after church and it was nothing short of spectacular.  It is an Asian fusion restaurant and Elizabeth and I enjoy dishes from a couple different regions. The pad Thai chicken was really really good and then we had sushi which was exceptional. The roles were more interesting and  flavorful than anything I've experienced elsewhere."}
{"text":"This is a new place in a slightly odd location in the back of a strip mall.  The restaurant is gorgeous and it's obvious that the new owner put a lot of money into the building.  I was in for happy hour and sat at the bar.  The happy hour menu was a little hard to figure out.  The bartender said the beer prices weren't reduced for happy hour but when I got my check I was happy to see that my Dragoon IPA was 1/2 price and only $3.50.  I ordered the chicken satay and the California roll.  The satay came out first and was barely warm.  I'm not sure why that was the case since it did have grill marks on it.  The side dipping sauce that it came with was very good.  It took forever, like 20 minutes, to get my sushi.  I must say that it was delicious with lump dungeness crab placed on the top of the roll.  I'm not quite sure about this place.  Give them a try for yourself."}
{"text":"Third time here and this was by far the best.  I had the ramen with pork and it was amazing.  Weston the bartender was spectacular.  Highly recommended and ask for Weston or sit at the bar!!!    Great atmosphere with huge projection tvs.  Very extensive menu, i am very excited to come back and try more items.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"We (4 of us) were not impressed with the food. Two liked the decor but I didn't. Service was just okay. No one asked if we liked the food, which bothers me.  We won't be returning."}
{"text":"This Owner knows what she's doing! Filtered table water, all organic veggies and hormone free meats. Excellent flavors and wonderful service and atmosphere! Feel good about what you eat!!!! Happy Tummy status! Will return again that's for sure. Price is right! Green and yellow curry bowls are full of flavor and they give you a lot for what you pay."}
{"text":"Super nice people. Awesome menu. Great beer prices on Tuesday. What killed the experience for me was it literally taking over 73 minutes between the first dish being dropped and the last and add to that 3 dishes being ice cold. All this on a slow night. Manager has been awesome. Just a let down for the prices and what they're trying to be which is a culinary experience."}
{"text":"This is my first time here,  as I walked in the ambience was present every where I looked.     The staff is friendly,  diligently working at their assigned tasks.  Happy and ready to take your order and the food arrives in a most timely manner.    My favorite is the Noodle Soup with Chicken and extra vegetables,  I like to add red cabbage and Xtra spicy.   The broth is simply delicious.    Come and see for yourself and sample their cuisine."}
{"text":"Guy who waited on us talked up the pad Thai like it was the best in the world. It was pretty dry and smelled like fish. Dude talked so much they forgot part of the pad Thai entree....which they attempted to correct.   My ribs were good but not very warm as if they reheated them from yesterday. My grilled veggies, French fries, and restaurant  atmosphere were the highlights of the evening. Staff should not brag on the entrees - no need to. Let the food do the talking...."}
{"text":"I saw this when it was being built. Love the vibe, very nice patio and a great Happy Hour the food was excellent. We had the chicken satay, baos, zen chicken rice all were very tasty! Zach was very attentive and sweet guy! Sorry we left before the live music started."}
{"text":"We have not had great luck in food delivery from door dash. The restaurants are subpar. We were thrilled that Uber Eats added more restaurants to our area.  Tonight we tried Zen. I was reluctant because of the mix reviews but figured why not , maybe this chef is a good one. Since I read they have gone through four already in the very short time they have been opened.  Pleasantly surprised the food was wonderful & I ordered quite a bit to try a variety.  1. Shumai steamed = 10  2. Chic Satay = 9  3. Dragon Balls = 7 ( our least fav but still good !! )  4. Spring rolls = 9  5. Basil noodles w beef = 9 . They would be a 10 but I specifically asked no bell peppers & it was loaded. But hubby likes them.  6. Panang curry w shrimp = 9. The only thing lacking is rice. They do not give you rice which makes it like soup to eat unless you pour it on your noodles or make your own rice. I would think rice would be mandatory to come w the panang.  7. Tuna poke in avocado = 10+. This was my favorite 8. Baby back Ribs = 8. They were good but I asked.for lean & they were a little fatty. Baby backs shouid not be fatty. Plus no one wanted the fries. I wish they offered just an a la carte of just the ribs.  All in all we were very pleased & look forward to ordering from them again. I hope this chef stays !!"}
{"text":"I'm not even mad at you for replacing Los Olivos. Really fabulous build-out. The pineapple fried rice is delicious and beautifully presented. The green curry and Penang are on point with the flavors. A little bit skimpy on the beef and chicken. Also, I find the big dish small scoop of rice on the side serving awkward and confusing. Really enjoyed the crispy sushi appetizer. The service was excellent and the live music is brilliant and so much fun. I am so close to loving this place but I have a feeling you're putting MSG in your food. I was up all night sweating with a pounding headache and palpitations. If you are using MSG please warn people or better yet, STOP! I want to be a regular happy customer."}
{"text":"It was just so-so. I'll go somewhere else.  Cons: Yellow chicken curry was Olympic size pool broth in relation to the amount of chicken, veggies and the rest of the dish. It came with a cup of rice. The proportion was silly. It was watery and not creamy I thought.  Pad Thai chicken was bland bland bland. It came with a tiny lime. A few sprinkles of ground peanut. And they do not use PAD THAI NOODLES!!  - price was steep I thought -- $27 for an order of pineapple rice?! It's rice, not a dish of meat.   Pros: -Pork belly bao appetizer was really good! - coconut and lime cocktail - strong and perfect !"}
{"text":"Good service, food was ok. I agree with the reviewer below that my curry dish was also a giant bowl with a ton of sauce but very little meat and veggies. Also, it was a little over priced. The facility is very beautiful, brand new renovation."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. I try to go there at least once a week. Not only is the food amazing but the staff is so friendly and hard working. They have live music every single night and the guys are pretty good. I always sit at the bar when Rocky is pouring the drinks. She's not only good looking but she makes the best Manhattan I've ever had. When she's not there, the bar is in capable hands with Nick. You can't go wrong with anything you order there."}
{"text":"09/10/17 7:45pm-8: This review is for your server Amanda. She was fast, polite and accommodating and helped us with the menu since we've never been here before. Atmosphere and food were awesome. Our appetizers were the chicken satay and the super california roll. My boyfriend got the Thai curry chicken and the spicy chicken ramen and I got the beef noodle soup. We took a banana fried ice cream to go(which by the way is frigging delicious and Amanda put ice in the bag so our ice cream didn't melt which is so nice because I live all the way on the other side of town.) Our food came out really fast and Amanda always had our drinks filled and always came to check up on us. Menu was easy to read and the booth tables they had are super comfy! This place has a really interesting, cool atmosphere. I love it and we'll be back! I'll remember to call for a reservation next time which my clueless self didn't realize but they still took us in and accommodated us. I'll have to bring my grandparents next time so they can try this awesome place out!"}
{"text":"Wow!! Love it!! Great atmosphere everyone very accommodating. Ate chicken Pad Thai huge portion. Live music too..could not ask for a better Friday night!!"}
{"text":"Tried to go to his place for a All-you-can-eat sushi Monday that lasted between 5-9 PM every Monday. We showed up at 6:30. Walked into the building and half the tables were reserved, said it would be an hour long wait. We sat on the patio for about 20 minutes before the waiter came to inform us that they were no longer seating people.   Doesn't seem like they know what they are doing yet. Waste of time. Probably not worth it since there are others in the area that are good and will be available until they say they will close."}
{"text":"I saw an advertisement on Facebook for $20/person all you can eat sushi on Monday. Monday (8/14) was our wedding anniversary so we decided to go to Zen Culinary for the first time over Fleming's happy hour. I made sure to make a reservation because we got there at 5:30 and by 7pm, there was a wait time. The rules are you can order one roll at a time from a limited menu. We also ordered drinks. The drinks were excellent and the rolls were great. However, after receiving the second roll, our third and fourth rolls waiting time was close to 30 minutes. Due to the long waiting time for our rolls, our waitress Alyssa was kind enough to comp a dessert of our choice (one for me and one for my husband) and two free rolls. Overall, the sushi rolls were excellent. Drinks were great and our waitress was nice and courteous. We'd definitely come dine again, maybe not during sushi night but maybe another night. Their lunch menu looked amazing too! Thank you for a great first experience!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went on Monday after she saw a posting on FB about all you can eat sushi for $20 each.  We arrived at 5p.  First off let me say the sushi was good, but the service sucked balls with the exception of the bartender. When we arrived we were asked if we had a reservation.  We said no and referenced the FB post which did not mention reservations.  The hostess shook her head and said the wait would be at least 30 minutes.  We asked if the bar was open seating and she said we could try to find two seats together.  Luckily we did find two seats.  Not a good start. Nick our bartender was great.  He took care of us with drinks and getting our food order in.  The rolls take forever and a day to get out to you.  Glaciers move faster.  At 7pm, we ordered our third and final rolls.  At 7:35, our rolls finally showed.  When the server who brought our rolls out I asked, 'are these the rolls we have been waiting for over 30 minutes for?\", she snickered, and walked away.  I understand that kitchens get busy, but this place is ridiculous.  Stay away unless you don't care about waiting, and waiting, and waiting."}
{"text":"Food is so so. Not bad, just not amazing. Wasn't impressed with menu at all, $15 for fried rice means I'd have to order $45+ worth of food just to get  more than one option on my plate and that just seems ridiculous, they should offer mixed plates. Atmosphere is nice, a little forced feeling in my opinion. Service was mediocre which was disappointing as there was no reason for it other than laziness. There weren't many other people when we went, but there was a very loud and obnoxious couple at the bar who kept making calls on speakers phone and rather than the bartender noticing other patrons getting annoyed, she participated in encouraging the obnoxious couple and was getting loud right along with them. Husband seemed excited about some of their event nights, but I probably won't go back. Much better places available in Scottsdale to eat."}
{"text":"Checked this place out last night with my wife and son. They have been working on it forever so I had to check it out. The building and interiors are amazing. So nice. Great long bar that I'll have to come back to for happy hour. We were the only ones there as it was kind of late. The food was great. Had the tofu curry which the chef (Daniel) came out and made sure it was made per our vegan standards.also had vegan roll and spring rolls. All was great. My son had the chicken rice dish. We were all pretty impressed. The staff was super friendly. I think I met the owner on the way out who asked how everything was.  I'm going back for happy hour next week check it out. They have Sapporo on tap."}
{"text":"The entire menu except the spring rolls has fish sauce in it. Ok, no biggie. So we order the spring rolls. Worst. spring rolls. EVER. NOOOOOOO.....mushy, thick breading, and bland inside. Awful. I ate one and felt ill. We paid our bill and left.  If you want a bar and atmosphere a la Scottsdale, yes. If you want good food, no.  FYI--the information about the fish sauce came from the chef--no allergy or dietary information is listed on the the menu. NOT-vegetarian-friendly."}
{"text":"Good service from bartenders but food took forever and the place was dead. Food was horrible. Very bad location sadly. Don't see them being around for long. Too bad need new places"}
{"text":"Unimpressed. Overpriced and under flavored. Started with the poke that was bland and lacking in portion size with very little fish for the price. Then husband had the sashimi bi bim bap which was also very small in portion size and the fish was more poke style than sashimi and only a tiny scoopful at best, though it came in a deceivingly huge bowl. I got the cha shu ramen which had no cha shu at all and had bland boiled flavorless chicken instead. No idea if they have a dessert menu as we were not offered one before being handed our check. Won't be back."}
{"text":"I'm mostly giving this place a 4 star because of the stellar prices! I ordered the ribeye sandwich and it was only 9$ and it was really good. The service was great! Not the best drink menu, but good enough. I will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"The positive about this place is beautifully decor, bravo to the interior designer.  The negative part is almost everything but above. The food looked beautiful, but lack of flavors. The menu was not appealing and way over price. The service were disastrous (the staffs needed more training).  I ordered sashimi bi bim bup lunch special $12 and at the end they charged me for regular price $25, people be aware of this restaurant. My friend ordered chicken BBQ and it was no flavor at all, she ended up didn't eat it. I also had hot tea, but came out lukewarm, so I had to send it back.  I won't recommend this place to anyone until they fix all the mistakes.  I feel bad to write this bad review, but I don't want people to have the same bad experience like we did. Thank you."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. It was actually better than I thought it would be.  I don't care for the location.  They have some great weekly specials with all you can eat sushi on Monday's, $1 drafts on Tuesdays starting at 5pm and I was told by the bartender they have live music on Friday's and Saturday's.  Heard their pineapple fried rice is excellent and served in an actual fresh pineapple.   I'll be back to try the sushi and pineapple rice."}
{"text":"At first glance we were put off by the menu...$22 for Pineapple rice!  Our waiter convinced us to try a couple happy hour specials and we were hooked!  Apparently the regular menu portions are family style so we plan on coming back with a group to share the entrees. I am so glad we gave this place a chance, the food was really delicious and definitely unique in their presentation and flavors."}
{"text":"One of the best Asian restaurants in Scottsdale.  Came in with some friends and ordered the friend chicken wings, the spicy basil noodles with beef, pad thai, and  the fried rice. For dessert we had the chocolate cake and mango sticky rice.  Everything was amazing  Decoration if great and the dining area is huge.  Great bar area with a cool atmosphere. I will definitely come back and bring some friends with next time."}
{"text":"Came with the family for Saturday night dinner. We arrived around 630pm and it was not packed. We ordered a few dishes, some good, some not so much.   Zen Fried Rice - needs more flavor, shrimp was a good size & came with 6-7.  Tom Ka - very flavorful & not too creamy like most places. Pineapple Fried Rice - very tasty & great presentation. They served it in a pineapple boat.  Banh Mi Sandwich - it was ok, meat was tough.  Lemongrass Chicken - rather expensive but it came with 1/2 chicken. Flavor was there.   Service can be improved. Server didn't know the soup of the day. And they messed up one of the orders. I would give this place another shot."}
{"text":"I've been to Zen Culinary 3 times for lunch on Saturdays, and hope to go back many more. The yellow curry chicken and the Zen fried rice were especially delicious. I also liked the pad thai. The servers we had were helpful and attentive. The interior is very attractive. About half of the seating is high topped tables, but they also have some nice booths, and regular tables, too. The chairs at the regular tables are very comfortable, and my little group lingered after lunch and dessert as we were all very satisfied. They have many options on their menu that are new to me, that I look forward to trying. The server was very accommodating in offering any modifications that anyone wanted, i.e. omitting green pepper for one lady who requested it. Both servers mentioned their sushi chef used to work with Bruno Mars, and that he is very accomplished. We even enjoyed our desserts. I know there are other Thai and Asian restaurants nearby that are slightly less expensive, but this place has food that is so flavorful that I would choose this one every time. I really want this place to do well. Thai food is probably my favorite, and this is the best I have had."}
{"text":"Food was great and authentic!  We were there on a weeknight and the serving staff was unattentive.... no spoon or bowl with soup,  and all food came out at the same time and crammed on the table.  All attention was paid to another group (appeared to be known by the manager or something) and we were all but ignored.  Too bad because the food was GREAT...   Curry and soup AND the fresh sashimi!"}
{"text":"Food is something you will talk about tomorrow and the day after!  Small band is perfect for dinner"}
{"text":"Came in for dinner with a group of friends, and everything was so delicious! We started off with the spicy wings and they were amazing. The fried parts were light yet crunchy and the sauce was spicy and tangy - they were honestly some of the best wings I've ever had. We also had the spring rolls which were great, crunchy with delicious glass noodle/vegetable filling. We ordered the fried rice and curry, both of which were yummy as well. The fried rice really stood out; the rice was nice and chewy and the spices/garlic flavoring was unique. For dessert, we got the mango sticky rice. The mango was perfectly ripe and the rice was just the right chewiness and texture. The plate was empty within the minutes.  The interior was also great, with a huge, very well-decorated space and super cute outdoor patio in the front. I will definitely be back here again soon for my Asian fusion fix!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice now in the last month. Love the happy hour menu...great drink and appetizers and a great price. (appreciate that they offer on the weekends and not just the weekdays like most places).  The food is consistently good and fresh. Large portions can be expected and for the price, I would consider the value to most definitely be there. The entertainment is awesome...these guys are great and fun to engage with and play all types of music. Looking forward to sitting on the patio once the weather cools down.  Owner is very gracious as is the wait staff. It's a fun place to go to with friends.   I great new find in the valley...we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great new restaurant that opened a few months ago. I loved the live music, not too loud and relaxing tunes. We ordered the pork dumping and avocado with papaya and ahi tuni for an appetizer. Both great but I preferred the Ahi. For dinner we ordered a delicious bowl of pork Ramon soup, pad tai and sushi for the three of us. Everyone loved their meal. The ambiance and service was very relaxing, we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great new spot!  We have been here several times for lunch dinner and Happy Hour. The food is great and the staff is wonderful. And the atmosphere is gorgeous!  One of our new favorite places! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time visiting this Resturant.  Service was increable with Jaime. Very professional, friendly, and expert knowledge of the menu.  The food was outstanding....and we will be visiting this jewel on a regular schedule.....Go to this Resturant and you will be amazed.  Ask for Jamie - but I'm confident the staff are outstanding."}
{"text":"Just finished dinner and really enjoyed it. Great appetizers and we had the lemongrass chicken and Korean ribs and loved them both. Ended with a huge piece of fabulous chocolate cake. Our server was attentive and we loved the live music. Our friends urged us to come and we're happy we did."}
{"text":"The ambiance at Zen is amazing.  The design and build was spot on.   Food:  The ramen tasted no better than the box I used to make in my college dormitory.  The spring rolls lacked flavor.  45 minute wait for an order of spring rolls is also unacceptable.   Salmon sushi was actually excellent. I would love to see this place succeed however my recommendation is to close for a couple of weeks, retrain the inexperienced staff, rethink who & what they want to be, and decrease their ridiculous high prices. My prediction is, if they don't figure this out soon, they will not make it in this area.  Good luck and please accept this constructive criticism."}
{"text":"First time here, everything was on point...good service even when we came in close to closing, nice atmosphere and Thai boat noodle soup was very good!  Definitely would go back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"So their may be a little overlap here as my BFF just gave an excellent description of this trendy spot, but here I go anyway. The first thing that catches your eye is that the owners spared little expense on the decor. Right when you walk in you see beautiful black tables with lush red boothes. There are modern Asian accents throughout the restaurant that indicate their menu is heavily inspired, but not altogether traditional. Also, I loved seeing two party rooms sequestered in the back for privacy.   I ordered the Spicy Basil Noodles and the French 75, while BFF had the Duck and a Sazerac that was a little strong for her. The French 75 was perfect the Gin wasn't overpowering and it left a wonderful tart fizzy feeling. The egg noodles were on point. I could tell they were freshly made. There was great al dente veggies in the mix, and I like how the basil lightened the flavor. The fried egg was a nice touch. I have to deduct a star because they gave me pork instead of the shrimp I ordered, and the dish wasn't as spicy as I would like...but still a great dish. BFF's Duck literally melted in your mouth. Can't wait to go back for it.  The service really stood out servers, managers, and bartenders were all incredibly friendly. The bartender seemed very experienced, and was happy to throw in some quips during the meal. I also wasn't mad at our complimentary Red Scorpion tiki drink, be careful it stings after a half hour. I hope this place takes off!"}
{"text":"Pineapple fried rice. That's all you need to know. My life is forever changed. I live around the corner from this spot so this could be dangerous."}
{"text":"These reviews are definitely deceiving.   Went with 3 co-workers for lunch.. for starters it was a ghost town in there during lunch hour... we mentioned we were on our lunch break, and thankfully the server was aware we were on a time crunch but we finally saw him and mentioned this about 6-7 min after waiting for a server to get to our table.   Myself and 1 other person ordered the grilled chicken sandwich... absolutely zero flavor, sort of chewy chicken, wilted lettuce and extremely warm mayo. I honestly would have rather of had a chicken sandwich from McDonald's or Wendy's for a fraction of the price and better flavor. ¬Ø\_(?)_/¬Ø   Other two got yellow curry- brought out on a plate that took up basically half the table, the rice was crunchy and obviously under cooked.   I'll stop there but it's fair to say none of us are going back."}
{"text":"25th wedding anniversary today! Fourth time as in, would love this place. If you want a seriously good creative slightly different but amazing happy hour this is the place to go. And happy hour goes till seven! Great combination of Thai food and sushi. Happy hour is really the way to go you got to check it out. Monday through Friday live music that is amazing! Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Very nice interior design and ambiance.  I think the word \"culinary\" in their name is Add to appropriate.  The food was really very good.  Very well presented, and were proper portions - not overloaded, just right. I thought they had the best green curry dish I've ever had.  I thought the beer choices were quite good too.  I ordered a ginger-infused ale that was quite different and wonderful.  I'd go back for that, but I found out it was a seasonal selection. The lunch prices were reasonable for such a polished restaurant.  They have a piano situated at the east end of the dining room, very nice."}
{"text":"Fairly new. Felt badly they were so empty, though went during summer so definitely a rough time for a newer business if any business in AZ. Their food seemed fresh & good for the most part. The Panang curry was bland & didn't taste anything like it normally does in other Thai restaurants. The yellow curry is better & has more flavor. Their appetizers & noodle dishes were good & very fresh."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday night and was VERY pleased. Service was super friendly, food was delicious. My wife had a veggie curry which was subtle yet spicy and just very well balanced. Another person in our party had a steak sandwich which was really really good and I had the ribs which were super tender (and a very generous portion). Plus for my daughter (who is a very plain eater) they made a set of chicken satays that were also super delicious. Also their menu has something for any price range (from $12 steak sandwich (almost enough for 2 to share) to more expensive items. (Plus I understand they have a lunch menu too which I will have to come to try SOON). Bottom line, finally a great Asian fusion place in north east Scottsdale. Will be back soon."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday night Dec 2. Didn't realize it until I read other reviews that today was their grand opening.   Walking up to the Zen, the patio tables looking very enticing but cold outside. As you walk in the front door is a nice little waterfall. Nice touch. Anyways, they have a huge dining area. Bar area with lots of seating and a dining area. Very bright with red and orange. Very well decorated, wide open feeling with a somewhat touch of Asian. Bar area has three large tv's with large windows where you can see the kitchen. Anyways, we dined in the dining area with the booths.   We were greeted right away with our water cups. We started off with the Tuna Mango Poke. It had a whole avocado cut in half with Tuna Poke and Mango. Very well presented. It was good but lacked a little flavor.   I had the Pad Thai with beef. It had on the side, peanuts and dry peppers to spice it up. I thought it was pretty good. Not too sweet. For those of you that like your really spicy Thai food, probably wouldn't be spicy enough for you but I really liked it. Decent portion.   My wife had the Noodle soup with chicken. She really likes it and I was able to sneak a few bites and it was pretty good. The noodles were good and the soup was really good for a chilly night.   My son had the baby back ribs. He liked it. The sauce had a little Asian flare to it with crispy fries. He ate it all up so it must have been pretty good.   Service was pretty good. He was always checking on us and made sure our water cups were filled.   So Zen had pretty good food, good service, and a pretty unique ambiance about this place. I will tell you what, this place has Japanese, Vietnamese, Thai, and American food in a unique setting. Now if you want original Asian food then this place isn't for you. Keep an open mind and just enjoy. I know they have some kinks but I'm sure they will fix them.   I'm looking forward to coming back and trying other dishes on the menu. Enjoy. I sure did."}
{"text":"This is such an amazing place. It's my first time here, and the manager checked in and thanked us for coming in. The food was delicious and the drinks were out of this world. I had amazing service from the stunning Hannah. Can't wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, great twist on lots of classic Asian dishes. Love their take in chicken pad Thai. Check it out"}
{"text":"This place is awful. The chicken satay was like rubber. Literally like rubber, I couldn't bite through it. Then what I can only imagine was the manager or owner asked me if my food was good and I told him that and he asked me if I wanted another order. As if I would like another order of rubber chicken. Then he said let me go in back and see what's up. He never came back. The chicken wings were fatty, slightly less rubbery meat and not very good. The curry was bland. All around a crappy experience. There wasn't hardly anyone in there and now I know why. They have been open 8 months they said. Good luck lasting in North Scottsdale with garbage food. Oh an then the bartender ran my card for $67 when my bill was $35. I explained my conversation with the manager after he fixed my bill and he said let me go talk to him. He didn't bother to come out and the bartender offered me a 15% coupon. I said no thanks I won't be back. There are literally 5 better thai places with 7 minutes from this place. Don't waste your time, money and appetite on this place it is terrible."}
{"text":"Alright. I give the food 4 stars and the service as well. Except for once the bill came. We had the pineapple shrimp fried rice, the ribs, and a lot of appetizers. The flavors were great and the happy hour menu had a lot of options. When we sat down we were given the happy hour menu and ordered right off it. When the bill came it was way off. We were charged full price on everything.  I asked the waiter about it and he said \"oh, you wanted the happy hour pricing.\"  Duh. He took the check and gave me a $22 credit."}
{"text":"Zen Culinary is the new hot joint in my area. I have to say that I do love this place!  Despite this place is new, it seems like the owners have experience in the art of dining. For an appetizer we ordered the Dragon Balls, which I would recommend and will make sure to get next time I come here.   I had the chicken curry which was just delicious and very full of flavor. It was a huge bowl that came piping hot with veggies and big pieces of chicken. My boyfriend had the Zen Steak sandwich which was pretty big and full of flavor as well.   As for drinks, I'm not sure I had the best experience. I ordered an Aviation cocktail, which was about a buck or so above what I feel the drink should've been priced at. It was a very, very strong cocktail. Although not my favorite, my waiter asked me if I was sure I liked it and offered to replace it, but I kept it and drank the whole thing. I'm sure other cocktails here are great, so I will make sure to keep trying this place out.  The ambiance is very cool. Dark lit and upbeat music with interesting furniture. The outdoor patio look very zen.  Staff and waiters are friendly, waters topped off regularly.   Overall, Zen Culinary is off to a great start in my opinion, and i hope it sticks around as it's got great potential to become a neighborhood favorite!"}
{"text":"???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"All good.  Excellent menu, great food and presentation. The portions were extremely generous and spiced perfectly.  In addition the space is beautiful and comfortable. Go, you will be happy."}
{"text":"This restaurant is an absolutely amazing new addition to this side of town! We've been watching all the construction going on for months not quite sure what was going on, but soon after the grand opening my boyfriend took me here for dinner. We got fantastic drinks, the duck entre (absolutely amazing) and the best pad Thai I've ever had. The service was also very quick and professional. Our waitress was so sweet and everyone else that ran food and came to check on us was very nice too. I already have plans to come back for lunch tomorrow with friends. Don't miss out on this great new spot!!"}
{"text":"Meh. I would really like to say I liked my visit but unfortunately the food just wasn't very good. The waiters didn't seem to come back to offer refills. Fortunately the bartender Phillip made up for the service with friendly attitude and conversation with punctuated visits to our table. We went for lunch and tried the ramen and panang curry. The ramen was more similar to pho but not very great pho.  I selected pork for the meat in the ramen and it was not close to char siu but more of just boiled pork.  The panang was an OK dish but mostly just cream and coconut milk with not much meat."}
{"text":"I'm giving it 2 stars because the place looked very pretty and they had good live music.  My husband and I decided to stop by for dinner since we were in the area. First, the most awkward waiter brings us 2 glasses of water but says nothing, just kinda stares at us in a very weird way and then walks away. After that we had NO ONE come!! The place was not packed at all and waiters and hostess could totally see us sitting there and did nothing. Finally after 20 minutes or so we give up and leave. It's a shame because the location is great and the menu looked good. Although we also noticed this place does not offer any appetizers. I hope you guys have a different experience if you end up going."}
{"text":"Hit Zen last night (Friday) around 730, say at the bar.  Friendly bar tender, had some great Cabernet for only $11 a glass, I thought that was pretty reasonable in Scottsdale.  Had fresh summer roll appetizer, was very good and large portion.  Loved the live jazz piano drummer group they had in as well.  Very entertaining and interactive!  The manager was super energetic and fun to chat with.  Didn't have full dinner but the menu looked good, perhaps a bit on the pricey side, depending on what mood you're in.  Would certainly be back!"}
{"text":"Very attractive exterior and interior. Cool, hip and modern vibe. I visited on one of the first nights they were open so the service was a little unorganized but the management made up for it wonderfully. My guest and I never complained once but our server noticed herself every time something was wrong which I greatly appreciated. The food was delicious... we got the pineapple fried rice which is beautifully presented (that was actually the reason we decided to give the restaurant a try) and  everything else we tried, some of which we unfortunately/fortunately didn't order, was delicious. I will definitely be back to give Zen a second chance!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food & service (2 items forgotten by server-Justin-he didn't write down the order ). We ordered fried rice, Cali roll with crab, and Ramen plus beef and shrimp. The only winner was the Thai iced tea and the presentation of the fried rice in the pineapple & sushi was good in appearance. We will go back to Nori Sushi for sushi items, Hot Noodles, Cold Sake for Ramen, and Benihana for fried rice! 1 & done for us! It seemed more like emphasis was place on a sports bar atmosphere...maybe try the 3-6 pm happy hour, if you're a drinker. Good luck! It does have a cool vibe when you enter..."}
{"text":"Food is very fresh and well prepared.  We loved Panang curry!"}
{"text":"Showed up at 4pm on Wednesday durring PHX open week and it wasn't busy at that time .  Started off with 4 piece tuna nigiri style. Tuna was excellent prepared and just the right amount of rice. Jamie, our server, was awesome and personable. Gave my 12 year old free desert sushi...nigiri, rolls, etc made from fruit rolls, fruity pebbles, jelly worms, marshmallows, etc.. Really cool! My kiddo loved it."}
{"text":"Stopped by just for a drink this week and the service was phenomenal.  The bartender, Rocky, did a great job with the drinks she made and she was great to talk with.  The piano guy was pretty awesome as well.  Will definitely go back and check out the food."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!  I thought it was a hole in the wall until we walked in.   It has plenty of seating and even a banquet room for private parties.   They had unique bibimbop options which included a yummy kochujang sauce.   We had the ribs which are marinated in a combo kalbi and traditional BBQ sauce.   The avocado made the poke amazing.   We also had the shrimp shumai which was perfect.   The ambience is nice and the bar was huge.   The service was exceptional.   We will be returning.   So glad you're here and close."}
{"text":"Saw mixed reviews but wanted to try this place with the family since we love Asian food.  The decor/ambiance was really nice and the servers were great.  But, this could not not make up for sub-par and overpriced food.  We had early dinner (as usual since we have a six year old) and were happy to see a happy hour menu.   The chicken satay was great; my son ate two orders.  The happy hour sushi roll was tasty but certainly no deal - there were four thin slices for $7.  Seems that happy hour sushi means half an order for half the price - not happy.  We were told the soups and curries are very large and served family style - so we ordered the yellow curry with chicken and noodle soup with chicken.  Both dishes had little chicken and the chicken was flavorless and a strange consistency - found some of the chicken in the curry was not fully cooked - sent that back.   The soup was just a lot of noodles and broth with the chicken - not what I was expecting.  Both of those dishes were very bland - strange for place with 'culinary' in its name.   While they were in large dishes, there was little in the way of meat and vegetables for the price and \"family style\" description - maybe enough for one person.  Also, they were awkwardly served - without appropriate dishes and utensils for sharing - messy.  So, by this time, we really wanted to leave - but I hardly ate anything.  So, I called up Thai House across the parking lot and ordered a chicken curry to bring home - that was really good and knocked the socks off of this food.   Zen is probably a good place to go for drinks and a great bar atmosphere, but the food offerings fall short and and are overpriced - there are many other better options close by."}
{"text":"It was just OK!  The sushi looked as if the dish washer was recruited to make it, as I will post picture.   The appetizers and the meal all came out together.  Took forever to get soy sauce and small dish for dipping the sushi.  They brought desert to the table and expected us to push dirty dishes to the side rather than clearing the table and serving dessert and coffee."}
{"text":"Post-Scrumptious Family Lunch! Really enjoyed our time here at now our new favorite place to dine in North Scottsdale area! Bonus part is it is in our neighborhood! Thank you Diona Chiu Opena for bringing me here for my 50th Birthday Lunch Treat! Highly recommended & our foodie family approved it! #zenculinary #scottsdale #sonorandesertlifestyle  We love everything we ordered!"}
{"text":"My review is the opposite of everyone else's ~ the service was great but the food was blah. My pineapple fried rice's presentation was quite pretty (served in half a real pineapple) but bland. My husband and son split the ribs, which were measly, tough, sauceless and bland. They were served with mushy, inedible French fries. My daughter's chicken fried rice was just rice and onions and chicken with a couple of slices of tomato and cucumber on the side. Again, it was blaaaaand.  Still, the ambiance was hip and swanky. We came at lunch and it was mellow, but I bet it's hoppin' at night.   Our server (Jamie) was extremely attentive and earnest. We expressed interest in the grand piano so the hostess/piano player took an impressive turn at the keys.   Next time my husband and I will come for date night and sit at the bar. We're hoping the sushi and curry are more impressive"}
{"text":"WOW!! I have lived in Scottsdale 15 years and eat out 7 nights week! My go to slots are ocean club , elements, city hall, Dominicks, Henry, different point of view and ALL the sushi places from kona grill to nori to Ta to Roku Akor, sting ray etc! I have now eaten at zen culinary prob 10+ times and A+++ every time! Atmosphere and decor blows doors on competition! And place is Sooooo cool looking!! The food is awesome I have had a variety of sushi and soups and seafood all on point!!! Now let's get to what really matters most to me EXPERIENCE (as I can get good food many places) I will sum it up in a maya Angelo quote \"people will forgot the words that you said , people will forget the things that you did but people will never forget the way that you made them Feel\" when I eat at Zen Culinary they ALL make me Feel great! Christina and Matt the managers are awesome- over the top attentive and Friendly , Rachel the owner is incredible , Daniel the chef has come out from the kitchen 40% of my meals to see how I doing and Rocky the bartender is amazing! ( way cute gal named Raquel whose nickname is Rocky) is beyond darling and makes me laugh every time I come!! They also have a piano and slick patio where I think I will do a private company party fun!! I hope these guys kill it as I think they may have the magic to  Kill the local sushi chains!"}
{"text":"***NOT GOOD FOOD....NICE BUILDING.   I'm so disappointed the food here wasn't very good...bc the building is so nice! The bahn mi was pretty bad...too much bread, no sauce or cilantro/mint. There's nothing BAHN MI about this sandwich. It was just sliced pork tenderloin (not even marinated) and picked onion. Chicken sandwich was literally JUST chicken on a sesame seed bun. Might as well get fast food. Pork belly buns were decent...but for the most part...meh."}
{"text":"Zen Culinary   Let be preface this by saying \"Lo Fon\", some of you will understand.   Walked in to a confusing entrance that led us walking right in front of a Live Band of 2 playing some pretty good music.  The menu Entr√©es were Expensive, wow the steaks were around $48.  Large dining area than expected, Bar area with high tables, Back part has normal height dining tables.  Ordered the appetizer Shumai, Dinner Banh Mi Sandwich, Dinner Yellow Curry with Chicken and Dinner Zen Fried Rice with Chicken.  All entrees were of good portion as we shared among the three of us.  The Shumai arrived in a steamed basket with six in the order, not of quality we are used to from other dim sum places. The skin peel of the Shumai was on the hard side while the meat was not real tasty.  The Zen  Fried Rice was on a large dish and a good portion to share,  Although it was sparse with items in the rice and the flavor was okay, but not to what we are use to.  The Yellow Curry with Chicken was pretty good, like I prefer, base was on the watery side but good which came in a big round bowl and a bowl size amount of rice, if it was a little bit more thick would have been perfect.  The Banh Mi Sandwich was huge and came with a good portion of perfectly crisp tater tots. Although the sandwich was huge, the bread is not the fresh baked baugette that I would prefer.   Arrived on a Wednesday around 8:00 pm and there were almost just as many people performing in the band than customers in the restaurant.   We mainly went because we had a $50 gift card, if we did come back, not sure if it will be there."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a coworker. I ordered the pad thai with chicken, which was plated really nicely, but just average in terms of taste. You can find equally good or better pad thai cheaper at other restaurants in this area."}
