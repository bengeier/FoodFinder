{"text":"Delicious! Drove all the way from downtown Toronto to pick up take out as I was craving homemade Filipino food. Found the restaurant on Yelp and figured it was worth the drive. My husband said it was the best lechon he has ever tasted. Perfectly crisp and meaty.  We also had the BBQ pork and chicken Inasal. Equally delicious. For dessert we had the Sans Rival cake flavoured with cashews, delightful chewy layers and cream. If you are looking for quality homemade Filipino food this is the place."}
{"text":"Had the Pork BBQ and the Grilled Chicken, with a side of spring rolls. Everything was delicious and very reasonably priced.  Everyone working there was very nice, and the restaurant was very clean and well maintained.  I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"My wife is Filipino. Was searching for a place with good halo halo and the search has ended. Garlic rice was good along with other dishes."}
{"text":"mmmmmm Filipino style breakfast! We ordered the longsilog + tosilog (for an extra $1) and couldn't finish it all! Never stingy when it comes to portions and I can just taste the love put into the cooking of it.   A little salty sausage and some sweet I guess \"bacon\" with some rice and an egg on top? BAM  all that for $6.99 is a total deal imo. If you have never tried it you have to. Always friendly staff with delicious food. This place never disappoints! Of course I'm a regular here how can I not be? And I'm from Brampton!"}
{"text":"I had longsilog sausage with chiksilog fried chicken with rice. excellent crispy fried chicken with a delightful sweet n sour dip.sausage was very tasty and cooked perfectly to my liking. The food service and price here are unbeatable I will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is mom-and-pop Filipino joint and has potential. But, it has a long way to go. I ordered the lechon kawali (crispy pork) with garlic rice. The quality was inconsistent throughout. Some pieces had a great crispy skin and succulent meaty inside, but others were just rubbery and tough to chew. Personally, I would also like to have seen some vegetable side offered with the meal. Overall, I really hope they can improve and maybe then I'll give them another try."}
{"text":"I've recently been on a Filipino food binge so this place was definitely on my list to visit. I got the lechon kawali with garlic rice + longanisa. Overall it was a delicious and filling meal plus I had leftovers for a second meal! The owner was really nice too."}
{"text":"Food was ok .. had chicken inasal with garlic rice .. I liked the inasal was made to order but was just ok .. pork sinigang was a bit salty .. bro had lechon  kewali which was also made fresh .. I am new to area and this place is worth another visit"}
{"text":"Great filipino food! Their fried chicken is to die for.. The batchoy was very good as well. Their halo halo is one of the best I've tasted in the city.  Limited seating inside the restaurant, but overall a great place."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today for lunch (Friday). Ordered the Bangsilog ($6.99) and Fried Pork Lumpia (4 for $2.00). Oh so sarap! Fish was the perfect size for 1 person. I had my food to go but while I sat waiting for it, atmosphere is a cozy, family style. No line, didn't wait long for the food. Definitely will be back to try the other menu items and when I'm craving authentic Filipino food!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have always enjoyed the food.  Staff is very friendly and helpful.  It's my go-to-place to get my fix of Filipino food in West Toronto."}
{"text":"Came to taste their food upon the recommendation of a friend. The owner was there upon entering, but not one soul welcomed us or looked up from what they were doing (which should have clued me in on what was to come)  From suggestions we ordered: 1. lumpiang sariwa (fresh spring rolls - sauteed vegetables inside crepe wrapper) - the ingredients were all wrong and the sauce was too sweet (there was no peanuts or garlic in sight!) 2. Palabok (Philippines style noodles in prawn gravy) - the sauce was bland and tasted like it came from a package  We waited 20 minutes (standing at that!) before the owner decided to ask if we were ready to order. She was rude, inattentive and rushed us through our dinner.   Honestly, if I wasn't already hungry, I would have walked out. I highly doubt a second visit will happen, not when the owner is like that.  Tip: if you want authentic Filipino food, drive to Bathurst & Wilson area"}
{"text":"Very authentic Filipino food.   Ordered the Lechon with Garlic rice and was very impressed with how great everything tastes. I've been craving good Filipino food so this definitely fulfills my stomach.   The lumpia was fried perfectly as well.   Trust me. Get the garlic rice.   4 stars as service is a little slower but overall very happy with the food."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place but it was such a disappointment.. let it been known that the photos look a lot better than they taste.  We ordered fried lumpia, fresh lumpia, palabok, bangsilog, adobsilog, tapsiolg and longsilog..   Fried lumpia was decent at best.. the frozen ones taste better  Fresh lumpia was the ONLY good thing there.. some say the sauce is too sweet but I liked it  Palabok was not good.. a reviewer said it was the best palabok in town.. that person must not know what palabok should taste like.. it was bland.. no shrimp or chicharon.. just noodles, dry pork and ONE boiled egg  Bangsilog can't be reviewed because she didn't give it to me.. I paid for it, but never got it  Adobsilog was so disappointing that I couldn't eat it.. maybe I've just been spoiled by my mom's adobo, but this taste like all the ingredients were thrown into a pot a boiled.. not to mention half (literally half) of the meat was pure fat  Tapsilog was dry.. just really dry and tough   Longsilog was good because it was store bought   The ONLY reason I'll go back to try it again is cuz I want to try their lechon and fried chicken"}
{"text":"I pre-ordered party sized food here for a party, and made several calls to confirm the order. I was told to pick up the food when the place opened. When I came to pick up the food, the restaurant was still closed. I waited and still no one came. I left voice mail and still no one came. End of story: I never got my order for the party as the restaurant didn't even open that day. The restaurant screwed me over, without any warning the day of the party. So just be careful when ordering, they are not reliable."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. The food speaks for itself. I fancy myself as an expert on pork. I've been to latin lechoneras. I've even eaten the legenday luau pork in Hawaii. Lola's lechon is the best pork I've had in my life and it's probably safe to say will ever have. It's a must if you're ever visiting Toronto.... Now if only they could ship it to NYC. Haha! There pork buns are pretty damn spectacular as well."}
{"text":"The chrispy pata (Chrispy pork shank) was very tasty.  I will definitely try some other dishes."}
