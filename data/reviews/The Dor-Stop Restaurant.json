{"text":"While the Dor-Stop is a cute place on a nice tree lined street, I'm not sure what the big fuss is all about. The food was only fair and they don't even have real cream for your coffee. It's that nasty fake nondairy crap. It also gave me the heebeegeebees due to the \"Christianesgue\" motif."}
{"text":"We love this place! There's this guy in the kitchen who has a shaved head and a beard.  If you see him back there, my wife says he makes the best over easy eggs she's ever had.  The breakfast meats are awesome and so are the pancakes.  Prices aren't too bad either.  Staff is fun too - they'll start to know you after stopping in a few times, it's nice.  Check this place out!"}
{"text":"I grew up just South of Pittsburgh and had never visited the Dorstop restaurant until just this past weekend. I was looking for a place to meet friends for brunch and came across the Dorstop on Yelp. 

The restaurant is quite small and there were a lot of people eating there but service was fast and we did not have to wait long. I had the breakfast burrito and thought it was delicious! Everyone at my table really enjoyed their food from their omelets, to their fancy flavored homemade pancakes etc... I liked it so much that I went back a few days later with my Mom and Sister. They both really enjoyed their food as well! I would highly recommend this place for breakfast or brunch (as that was all I tried.) I will certainly come back any time I am visiting Pittsburgh. Great find!"}
{"text":"WOW!  Great staff and great food.  Got in quick and got out quick and cheap.  Did the regular breakfast with 2 pumpkin hot cakes on the side and they were out of this world.

I'm glad they were on YELP or I never would have none of my new favorite breakfast place.

{"text":"Recently visited the Dor-Stop for Sunday brunch and my experience was phenomenal.  It was busy but the turn around time is super fast so the wait isn't long at all.  Food was great.  I recommend the French toast (just the regs nothing fancy). And ps- the home fries are ridiculous, I don't know how they do it but if you try them and don't like them, you've got problems.  Another plus my coffee cup was always full.  Great experience and the staff is awesome and very attentive.  Thanks Dor-Stop!  I'll be back..."}
{"text":"This place has some seriously good breakfast.  They have many good things.  The pancakes looked awesome and I would get them next.  I had the Guy's version of the jumbot and it was delicious.  The cinnamon rolls are great too!  
It is a busy place for good reason."}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere and even better food! My husband's go to is the raspberry stuffed French toast but we've had many items from the menu and everything fabulous. There is almost always a wait on the weekend, but it goes by quick!"}
{"text":"Loved dining at the Dor-Stop.  I was visiting from New York and dragged a local along with me.  He had never been and is kicking himself for the years of lost happy tummy.  Cute place with good service and hearty food.  Everything was fresh and homemade.    They are open until 2pm on Sunday.  We got there around 1pm and it was a difficult decision - breakfast or lunch?  Breakfast or lunch?  We both chose lunch.

Delicious sandwiches - I had the pittsburgh turkey sandwich (turkey, swiss, french fries on grilled italian bread --- served with POTATO PANCAKES!), he had the Chic O' Philly Hoagie (chicken, onions, peppers, lettuce, tomato, and cheese on a split loaf with french fries).

German potato pancakes are delicious!
We spent about $20 and had a filling but not too ridiculous meal."}
{"text":"Airways interesting specials. Great potato pancakes!  Be prepared to wait at lunch and on weekends. Service is always good.  Cozy neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"The Dor-Stop is my new favorite place to have breakfast, narrowly beating out my own kitchen table. I love the eggs, the home fries, and the friendly but harried service. The Dor-Stop is almost always packed with customers, and for good reason. 

One small quibble: please, for the love of all that is holy, get rid of the fake-o Mrs. Butterworths and put out some real maple syrup for those tasty pancakes. Really, Dor-Stop, you're worth it. I believe in you."}
{"text":"I was expecting phenomenal but got good. I was pumped on the hype of Diners, drive ins and dives so maybe my expectations were too high for a breakfast dive. Service is a little on the slow side while you get pumped with coffee, nice staff, cramped noisy dining area, with a grumpy looking chef who can't smile. We had three different orders each was good, a bit over priced but thats because they have a line of people waiting to take your spot if your not willing to wait."}
{"text":"Love these hot cakes. A must do when you are in Pittsburgh. Get there early always a line. It's just that good! come with a big appetite these hot cakes are HUGE!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been living in the neighborhood for almost a year now and finally got to try out this place. It did not disappoint!  I've been asked why I have it only 3 stars with such a glowing review. Well, I don't prefer greasy spoon joints, but if it's your thing u will like it! 

What makes this greasy spoon joint different than others is the amazing variety of pancakes and french toasts- you will not get bored with your breakfast here! As a standard on the menu, they have many flavors to choose from: pumpkin, banana, blueberry, choco chip, raspberry, etc. I ordered the special of the day: chocolate cherry cheesecake pancakes. They were pretty good! I liked that there were actual cherry pieces in the filling- I appreciate real fruit being used in my breakfasts. If u like a pancake that holds up against the weight of toppings and syrup, while maintaining a soft spongey texture, you will like these. I hate when pancakes get immediately soggy- these do not! 

The boyfriend ordered Bob's specialty, as it is not a standard breakfast item either- eggs with German potato pancakes, applesauce, and sour cream- it did not disappoint! The potato pancakes were a tad on the sweet side, but I liked them. 

Another great thing here is the down-home feel of the place- everyone is very friendly. While we were waiting in line (which by the way, wasn't too long, they get people in and out pretty fast), they handed out small samples of coffee. This was much appreciated on such a cold day!"}
{"text":"Yelpers, once again you all came through!  Being fairly new to the city, the only real breakfast place I have found is Pamela's.  After reading Yelp this morning my friend and I went to Dor-Stop.  You guys rocked!  We had to wait 20 minutes but walked around the neighborhood (really should do a huge workout before AND after eating here!) then it was time for us to be seated.  The waitress was excellent!  They were packed so it took about 30 minutes to get our food but she kept our glasses of iced tea filled the whole time (and brought out a new glass of ice for each of us to refill).  I ordered the pancakes while my friend ordered a vegetarian omelet.  We ordered one order of potato pancakes to share.  

Both us really enjoyed our meals a lot!  Thanks again Yelpers, now I have a new favorite breakfast place!"}
{"text":"BEST pumpkin pancakes I have ever had in my entire life and I've had a lot. It was totally worth the 20 minute drive and the 20 minute wait. Moist and rich in the middle, just like my favorite pumpkin bread, and crispy on the edges. Didn't even need syrup.  There were a bunch of other delicious sounding pancake options that I wished I could have tried too, like apple cinnamon and banana oatmeal. 

Vicki's jumbot was really good too - everything savory and delicious scrambled together. The ham from bone in it was what made it special and I don't even usually like ham. Next time I might just get a side of ham to go with my pancakes :) 

Service was great too - real friendly, and everyone kept trying to refill my coffee as if their life depended on it. 

I'm not in Pittsburgh that often, but I will be coming back to Dor-Stop next time I visit!!"}
{"text":"Didn't even know this was a DDD place. We just searched Yelp for something decent in Pittsburgh. The Dor-Stop did not disappoint. The stuffed raspberry French toast was insane. The waitress warned me it was really sweet, but I felt that it was perfectly balanced.

Definitely check this place out, and don't be freaked out at the potential of long waits. We waited 20 mins at 10 am on a Saturday. You'll be fine."}
{"text":"Best pancakes in Pittsburgh besides DeLucas. Always delicious and the service is nice."}
{"text":"My first review was filtered for some reason. If you want a full picture of this place, be sure to read the filtered reviews as well. Many of them are not positive, and would lower the 4.5 star rating if fairly counted."}
{"text":"I really, really wanted to try Dor - Stop, but it wasn't open when I went! My wife and I woke up early just to go there, and the diner was closed for the next few days, EVEN THOUGH IT DIDNT SAY THAT ON THE WEBSITE! Such a waste of time. If you're going to go, make sure you call ahead, just so you don't get screwed over like we did."}
{"text":"Been to a lot of places in the burgh for breakfast. This place is the best. No questions asked. Pancakes are to die for and the Guy Fieri jumbot is insanely delicious. The place makes Pamela's and DeLuca's look like the McDonald's drive thru."}
{"text":"Been here twice. Hate to say it but nothing special. The usual breakfast items but nothing stands out either in preparation or presentation."}
{"text":"Very average place.  Waaaay over rated.  The food took forever to come out.  Then the home fries were lame. My toast didn't come as ordered. Eggs were good.  It's not bad, it's just not as great as everyone says it is.  They got on TV and now its like some Mecca.  Just average, don't expect more."}
{"text":"HOLY MOLEY that was some good breakfast at 2:00 in the afternoon!  I had the oatmeal pancakes and I have not stopped thinking about them since.  My wife had a vegetable breakfast burrito, and I stole some so I can say that was pretty awesome too.  
I'm now looking for an excuse to get back to this part of Pittsburgh so I can eat here again."}
{"text":"If you love a great home breakfast, this is your place. The pancakes made from scratch were incredible."}
{"text":"It's worth the drive over to Dormont. The owner realized I was a visitor, came over and chatted with me and asked me to sign the guest book. I had not seen the DDD episode, but read about it here and elsewhere. Bob, the owner, is delightful and the banana walnut hotcakes are amazing. I'm not sure it has been made clear but this is not banana flavoring, but hunks of banana. Wonderful!"}
{"text":"OMG!  Hands down the best pancakes I have ever put in my mouth. Sometimes I day dream about Dor Stop pancakes.  Too bad I live 6 hours away or I'd go there everyday.  

The service was just ok, but the place was packed and the food was well worth the wait."}
{"text":"The Dor-Stop restaurant has an enchanting, old fashioned look inside and out that effectively conveys its main appeal: good simple cooking at reasonable prices. The menu has typical diner favorites. I ordered the ham off the bone breakfast (with their special ham, potato pancakes, eggs, and toast) and true to form, it was very good (ham was still relatively moist despite having been on the griddle) and was reasonably priced at about $7.   

I went around lunch time on a weekday and the restaurant was about half full, so I didn't have to wait. Food came quickly and service was good (even though the young waitress oddly addressed me as \"honey\" every time).  As I was finishing up, an older gentleman, seemingly a \"regular,\" came in and was greeted warmly by the waitstaff. He took a seat at the counter and the staff told him what specials they could make for him. (He ended up getting a chicken salad sandwich on texas toast plus a bowl of soup.) And he chatted with the staff as he enjoyed his lunch. I'm guessing that this guy like many others are regulars here and know what a great place this is and keep coming back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, potato pancakes are fresh and served with applesauce or sour cream. Great lunch sandwiches and also a nice diner atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great little breakfast place! Portions were perfect, not too much, not too little.  We were there on a Tuesday morning and it was busy busy, I can on l  imagine what a weekend would bring. That being said I would wonder how the wait staff would handle the people because they were not very pleasant.  That took a little away from the experience but not a deal breaker.  We both had pancakes and they were amazing.  The wife had chocolate and banana, yummy! I had plain but still a great taste!!
For an great little breakfast stop I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I had no idea that this restaurant was \"legendary\" when I decided to eat there this morning with my family.  I was severely hungover and just needed some grease, and the concierge at my mother's hotel happened to recommend this place.

The restaurant is \"cozy\" (read: small) and situated in a really quaint neighborhood at the top of a massive (and somewhat scary) hill. The restaurant itself was buzzing and had a great neighborhood vibe. Despite it being *packed,* we were seated right away.

The menu wasn't too fussy but there were a lot of options. I ordered the dor-stop burger (burger with sauteed onions and green peppers, american cheese and two slices of texas toast) and fries. My husband got the mushroom swiss burger with onion rings and we split our meals. The food was simple enough but amazingly delicious. I think they battered the onion rings in crack. I also ordered an orange juice, which I could tell was fresh squeezed.

The portion sizes were reasonable too! Not gigantic, which I appreciate. I finished my meal feeling like a brand new woman. 

I think I'll look for reasons to come to Pittsburgh now that I know this restaurant exists. Yum."}
{"text":"My sister and I both got the banana and chocolate chip hot cakes, and we loved them! Huge servings and you can also get the hot cakes with bacon, sausage, and ham for a slightly higher price. This was my second time going actually and if I could go every day I would! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Went here after a wedding, the wait was long but worth it. I think we about ordered everything b/c we couldn't choose and it was all good from the eggs to the pancakes. I will be back."}
{"text":"Been here only once and it will be our last. Local neighborhood food hole with average food, coffee. Don't know what people find so special about it. I guess it does have an old, greasy spoon charm but that doesn't justify the trek halfway across town. There are definitely much better places in Pittsburgh.

 Waitress also weirdly loud and attitude-y, I'm sure she thought she was being very friendly and just kidding around and being friendly - but she walked a fine line between teasing and being self righteously indignant towards  my husband for not 'treating me right and paying attention to me' then went on to ask me why other Indian women wear black gowns that cover everything and eat through slits in their mouth holes and don't say a word. I felt more like she was on a crusade to save me and my brown skinned self from my 'ignorant' husband than serving us breakfast and leaving us in peace to enjoy the morning. 

May be great for other people, but not my kind of breakfast experience. Maybe I can't take a joke?

* 

Thought back on this experience a lot - I'm editing my review to local neighborhood food hole with racist undertones."}
{"text":"Before I start, this place has some solid breakfast dishes but nothing to rave about and not worth the 30 min wait. On a road trip I recently took with my family, it was literally the only breakfast place that disappointed us and did not live up to its hype.

Got the \"famous\" Ham from the Bone breakfast. Without a doubt, it was definitely good and a solid item to order, but it didn't blow me away. Wish I had tried Guy's version instead of the original...

My wife ordered two eggs over easy and they were undercooked, to the point of pretty much being raw. Gross. Breakfast places should know how to properly cook eggs.

We split Lori's Stuffed French Toast, which everybody loves. Again, definitely a delicious and solid item to order, but didn't leave me speechless or anything of that sort.

At the end of the day, you don't HAVE to go here. It's not a MUST. If you do go, you will get a more or less solid breakfast that is above average. Again, I don't think it's worth the wait or lives up to its hype, but I'm a foodie and know mind blowing food when I eat it."}
{"text":"My brother recently moved to Pittsburgh so my family and I were visiting him and looking for a place to go to breakfast. We settled on Dor-Stop. Walking in, it looks like your typical hole-in-the-wall diner, very small with not a ton of seating which is ok because they get people in and out fast. We put our name in and waited about 15 minutes then seated at our table. My mom ordered a egg white omelette, my brother ordered a sausage an cheese omelette, I ordered one banana chocolate chip pancake and a Western omelette, and my dad ordered some pancakes and eggs with some sausage. 

The pancakes were amazing. Very delicious, fluffy and large. . Everyone else was satisfied with their meal. If I were to get here again I would order just pancakes or some of their french toast. My omelette was good but nothing amazing. If you want good pancakes and french toast then I would go to Dor-Stop their eggs and other menu items weren't terrible by any means just nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"Never disappointed here.   You can come here and have a great consistent experience.  Breakfast is really good.  You will not be disappointed no matter what you eat.  

Would give 5 stars if the place was bigger.  You are practically sitting on top of people there it is very tight and the seating is not comfortable."}
{"text":"My husband and I had the most wonderful breakfast here! The food was dynamite and our only regret is that we do not live closer to Pittsburgh so that we could go there more often. I had the raspberry stuffed French toast, which was out of this world and my husband had the banana pancakes, which I believe was a special, and he rave about them. I would highly recommend this diner to anyone!"}
{"text":"First off, the food was good, but there was a LONG wait and two of our party had to sit on a window sill next to our table. We would go back again if we could get a better table. It was very similar in theme and everything else to Square Cafe in Regent Square. The joint had a larger seating area. Would hit up the Dor-Stop again though."}
{"text":"The Dor-Stop is a great small breakfast restaurant.  Once you enter the doors of pancake heaven you are greeted with friendly staff and the delicious smells of pancakes and meat on the griddle and other various breakfast aromas.  We came Sunday for breakfast and, boy does this place fill up!  

The Dor-Stop has gained fame from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, but that's not what I care about! I just want the food!  So, that's what I did, I ordered the food after ordering my coffee.  Their menu has all of the classics including their signature pancakes, omelets, french toast and eggs cooked to suit.

My coffee cup and water were kept full and while sipping on my caffeinated beverage, my meal came.  The Dor-Stop produced my order of two eggs over medium, and two large banana, chocolate chip pancakes.  I was speechless once I took a bite of that cakey, breakfast goodness (the pancakes not the eggs!).  The pancakes are really delicious. They have the perfect texture, the perfect taste, the perfect look, the perfect smell... need I go on?  The eggs were good too, I don't want to leave them out, but what egg is going to win again the battle of pancakes v eggs?

Breakfast Breakdown,

The Food: Delicious!
The Value: I believe my two egg combo was $7.99. Breakfast for four with coffee was close to $40. That's not too bad.
The Experience:  It's a small restaurant full of happy people! I happened to glance at the table next to us  and saw the breakfast burrito.  It's massive!
Would I return?: Why, yes. I wish I lived closer so I could eat them every Sunday.
5 stars?: I've been to a restaurant that claimed to have the best pancakes in the world.  They were wrong. The Dor-Stop has the best pancakes and for not claiming to have the best, they get 5 stars, because these pancakes were heaven sent!

Bonus game!: How many times were pancakes and breakfast mentioned in this review? Points to the winner!"}
{"text":"My dad and I do a yearly trip to a different city to see the NY Mets play.  Yeah I'm a Mets fan and live in California.  Anyway back in May of 2012, we made the trip to Pittsburgh.  

Based on Yelp and local recommendations, we drove out to the Dor-Stop.  In the four days we were in Pittsburgh we ended up going two times for breakfast.  

Just awesome pancakes.   First time, I got the banana pancakes and my dad got the oatmeal raisin.  I love banana pancakes and these were pretty good.  But the oatmeal raisin were fantastic.  Next time both of us got oatmeal pancakes.  I opted for no raisins.  

On a side note, we frequently hit restaurants covered on DDD but I no longer trust that show based on some of my experiences and the Yelp reviews I've read.   I now will look up the Yelp review and ask locals if the restaurant is featured on DDD before going."}
{"text":"Huge portions, quick service, fresh and delicious food!  Had the raspberry french toast--nice and crisp with fruity toppings, the Guy--hot and spicy as I like it--had to take half home, and pancakes with ham and cheese in them--again so much we had to take them home. Coffee cups stayed filled, the place was buzzing with a constant flow of people, glad we were able to get a table--we will be back!"}
{"text":"Went there with a friend. Had egg Benedict and did not like it. The turkey meat smells funny. And the waitress kept rushing us. Not sure why it's so crowded. Will not visit again."}
{"text":"I just love this place.  It's small, there's nothing fancy about the decor, and it's difficult to find a good parking space close by.  But I don't care.  The food is awesome.  Best breakfasts in Pittsburgh, hands down.   We don't get there as often as we'd like, but when we do go, we're always 100% satisfied."}
{"text":"We like it - great meeting place - maybe a little over rated on quality of food. Good but nothing to write yelp about. Pancakes didn't excel; eggs were just fine."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, for brunch, with some friends. 
My first time was confusing for my friend and I, because there was a line and we didn't know we had to sign in. After we were seated, we ordered food. The waitress was slow and unfriendly. She seemed irritated that we were there. The food was amazing, as our orders were small and uncomplicated, we just wanted to try the food. The second time was pretty much the same. The food was great and filling, but the servers were unfriendly and slow. Disheartening and not really worth dealing with for some pancakes. Try it out for the legend, like I did, but beyond the food, it's not much."}
{"text":"Loved it! Tasty food and friendly service!

Visiting there from out of town and decided to check it out. We went on a Saturday morning so we expected a long wait but it was only around 15 min. 

We had pancakes, stuffed French toast, bacon and eggs. All were yummy! Prices are reasonable and worth it for the good food and friendly service.

Would make the trip again to go there!"}
{"text":"A busy Sunday place at 12 noon. Clean and friendly employees. The food was fresh and good. I especially LOVED the potatoes lyonnaise! I ask for eggs over medium and got over easy. The bacon was good but a tad too salty for me. The pancakes where very tasty however thick and heavy. I like a thinner lighter pancake. 
I will return to try the stuffed French toast! Looked and smelled Devine!  
Definitely a great place to eat and socialize! Even the guests were friendly!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Pittsburgh. Hands down, no competition. My favorite meal is their breakfast sandwich with bacon. It's on Italian toast with lettuce, tomato, and mayo. In the fall I love the pumpkin pancakes! And if you're in the mood for something sweet you have to check out the raspberry stuffed French toast - just unreal. Not to mention that the servers are incredibly friendly. This place is family owned and has such a great vibe."}
{"text":"I have been here many times. This place lives up to the hype. You have to get the hot cakes. Try all of the flavors over several visits. I haven't has a bad pancake here yet . The flavors and consistencies are excellent. Easily the best pancakes on pittsburgh. They also have great French toast is pancakes just aren't your thing."}
{"text":"Excellent food, good prices, and speedy service. I've eaten here 4 times and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a down to earth casual dining spot."}
{"text":"Amazing, awesome breakfast restaurant.  The pancakes are to die for, no matter which variety you choose, and there are LOTS of varieties.  Make sure you show up hungry, or you may have a difficult time finishing your food.

Great staff and a good price.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"What's not to like about this place?  It's a friendly, bustling little diner. Very busy on weekends."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday morning, very busy! It was obvious why. Good vibe,  fantastic potato pancakes.  Great hotcakes and a perfect over-easy egg.  Will return."}
{"text":"This place is great to have down the street from me. It was featured on a food network show so it's very popular. There is ALWAYS a line. Do not expect to walk in and be seated immediately unless you're there first thing in the morning or 10 min before close. They are worth the wait though. Best to go with 2-4 people and if you bring more than that it will be very difficult to seat you. They have tiny booths and tables only. Once again...it's worth the struggle. Their French toast is to die for and I constantly order the West coast Benedict."}
{"text":"Do I really need to write a review of this place, you know it is good. I'm a breakfast guy and usually go with a simple egg and toast breakfast but today I went with the eggs Benedict that was really freaking Delicious and the portion was gigantic to me. For the $8 or so I spent it was a hell of a deal. 

My only recommendation to someone who hasn't been here before is to just not even come here on the weekends it is such a pain, because it is so busy. Come here during the week for a  more relaxing breakfast."}
{"text":"I love this place. Normally, it would have been 4.5 stars, but since they moved to a smoke free environment, it gets a 5 star rating. The staff is quick, friendly and very \"with it.\" This is a true family business and the food is fantastic. I love the jumbot! It's amazing and hearty. The coffee isn't the best, but the food makes up for it. The french toast and pancakes are lovely too. This is not the place to go if you are dieting as they are GENEROUS with the butter. I like this place way better than Pamelas, which, apart from the strawberry crepes, doesn't really do it for me. It was recently on the Food Network too so I'm not the only one that feels that way!"}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical when I heard that this was one of those \"TV\" places. I've been to Georgetown Cupcakes and Carlo's Bakery, and they both failed to live up to the hype created by their TV fame. The Dor-Stop remains unaffected by stardom, however, and that is a very good thing. We showed up on a Tuesday morning at around 9:30 and there were plenty of open tables. As noted by almost everyone else here, the service was top notch, the prices were reasonable and the food fantastic. I had the banana chocolate chip pancakes and they were out of this world! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I'd say a solid 3.5 stars. Been there only once, for brunch. Loved the German potato pancakes - worthy of 5 stars. But I'd give the Eggs Benedict only 2 stars. I'll be back to try more of the menu and get some more of those potato pancakes."}
{"text":"Went here for a co-workers bday, will be a lifer!

Had the raspberry french toast, it was the bomb.

Water was ice cold, service was quick, prices were cheap. And as i said earlier.

THE FRENCH TOAST IS THE BOMB. 

Pancakes looked really good too."}
{"text":"First time eaters-- we loved it! Not a good place if you are counting calories or fat grams but great diner breakfast. Kitchen is a tad slow so don't be in a rush. But the raspberry French toast and the pancakes were relish-- and wow, full plates, couldn't finish either!"}
{"text":"It's so good I get two meals ,, to hard to decide on 1 ... Got to get stuffed raspberry French toast ! It made national television :) get there early it gets busy fast"}
{"text":"The Jumbot is very good, you won't leave hungry that's for sure,staff is very friendly, the place was packed but they moved people in and out very quick, definitely worth the wait also the banana walnut pancakes rocked"}
{"text":"This restaurant was featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Network and was the basis of our visit. 

Located in the cute neighbourhood in the South part of Pittsburgh, Dormont, this little diner has a full breakfast and lunch menu. We got there just in an hour before they were closing for some lunch! 

I ordered the turkey Reuben with latkes as a side. It was delish! The sandwich had the right amount of sauerkraut. Their pancakes looked wonderful, will have to order them the next time I am in the area. 

Add this place to your list when you visit Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"Best pancakes I've ever had by far. Definitely worth the wait and the drive to get there."}
{"text":"A Dormont classic! You can't go wrong with Dor-Stop. Fresh, homemade meals made to order. This is one of my favorite breakfast places in the area, and I am not a big breakfast fan. The only downfall is the inside is extremely small. Watch going during weekend mornings because it gets very crowded. Due to its size, dor stop is not good for large groups. They serve both breakfast & lunch, and the waitstaff is incredibly friendly. I also love their coffee, whatever brand it may be! I recommend trying some homemade soup, not matter what meal you're going for... it's always fantastic!"}
{"text":"A little gem...great service and food. Raspberry French toast, crab Benny, Guy's omelet...and MORE!"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Made to order. Pancakes are to die for. There is usually a line on the weekends. Great nostalgia on the walls."}
{"text":"I do not get the hype behind this place. I have been here 3 times now and the only thing I would recommend are the pancakes. I should have just stuck with the pancakes on my last visit but I went with a meatloaf sandwich instead.  It was just average and didn't really have any taste. It came with mashed potatoes which were definitely from a package. I always wondered why this place didn't stay open later now I see why, everything that isn't a pancake is a failure. 

The worst part of this last visit was the service. We arrived and the place was half empty and we were seated at a table. The waitress was just kind of like what do you want, now I don't expect every place to be trader joe's type happy but don't act like we are bothering you for coming here. She took our order and that was last we saw of her. Someone else brought out the food and no one ever came back to check on us. I could see the waitress go over to her other table (she only had 2 tables) and check on them multiple times. We didn't get any refills on our drinks and every time I tried to motion to her she would turn her back and sit at the counter and talk with the other waitress. We never even received our check and had to go to the counter and ask for it our self. We were then told to wait because they needed to check someone else out first. After standing there for a couple minutes we were then given our check. No apologies or anything.  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Amazing place with super awesome breakfast! We had the veggie burrito for breakfast and it was simple amazing. Will definitely come back here when we can."}
{"text":"Stopped in one morning randomly, had heard good things and decided to give it a try.  Had no idea that the Christmas Parade was about to pass by, no wonder there were so many people standing around!  Our 4 year old hears the sirens and realizes Santa is coming, but we just placed our order.  Uh oh.  The staff puts our order on hold, and tells us to go outside to see Santa.  We watch the parade for a few minutes, and when we go back inside, our order hits the table the same time as us.  

I know there is a wait for tables most mornings, so it was especially nice of them to be so accommodating and child-friendly.  We have been back may times since, and the food is always amazing and the staff is just the best."}
{"text":"I had the Italian jombot here it was so good, and the service was awesome!!! I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pancakes I've ever had. I ordered the pumpkin hotcakes, and they were really nicely spiced-- slightly sweet, so full of cinnamon and nutmeg flavor that I didn't need syrup. They were dense AND fluffy, somehow. My companion got the german potato pancakes, which were deliciously oniony, and spicy sausage that was SO bursting with flavor and a satisfying snap when bitten,"}
{"text":"I used to live down the street and never made it here before.  What a shame.  Food was delicious, inexpensive and the service and atmosphere were great.   I will be back for brunch some weekend."}
{"text":"I have been here before, and it's just as I remembered it.  Came here with my husband, heavily pregnant and wanting pancakes.  To be clear,  I dislike pancakes.  My memories of them are the shake-in-the-container bisquik crap my mother used to make.  Hate pancakes.  But, wanted good ones, and was in the area.  Early weekday morning, so parking wasn't terrible, but still not easy.  Dormont is a cramped, busy area with an abundance of metered parking.  We were immediately seated, and asked by 3 different servers for our drink orders.  Hot coffee was immediately given, and never reached less than half of a cup, even after I said I was done. I ordered the apple cinnamon pancakes and my husband ordered a steak and cheese omelet with homefries.  This place boasts its appearance on \"Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives\", and there are articles sprinkling the diner.  It is usually always busy, and feels like a traditional diner: small space, bustling, and noisy.  There are a lot of locals, but we were not treated any less for not being familiar faces (we are from Pittsburgh, just not Dormont).  Food arrived hot, and my pancakes were coated with powdered sugar.  I avoid the syrup, as having lived in New England for a number of years, I will only use maple syrup on...anything.  I avoided the corn syrupy topping offered on the table, and am not sure if they offer maple syrup as a substitute (should never be a \"substitute\"!).  The cakes are great by themselves, and taste nothing like the buttermilk terrors of my childhood.  These are airy, cakey, and some would say, overly sweet--even without the powdered sugar.  The cinammon was lost in the breakfast, and the apples were, to the best of my knowledge, not canned. I could only eat about 1.5-2 of the 3 beasts, and snacked on my husband's homefries.  As others have commented, the homefries are not uniform diced or shredded potatoes.  They are soft, with the right amount of brown from the griddle, and slightly under-salted.  They are real potatoes that likely don't come from a freezer.  Wish there was a meal where I could maximize my carbs (pancakes, homefries, bacon--you get it).  All-in-all, this place is unique in that it can offer pancakes that I will eat, and is a well-known spot for a lot of Pittsburgh residents, certainly those in the South Hill.  Television appearance aside, it's still worth a try, but I recommend a weekday morning."}
{"text":"Stopped here recently for breakfast and it definitely does have that small town diner feel to it, but other than that, it's not really all that special. Most diners I've experienced tend to have regulars and the wait staff is extremely attentive. This was not really my experience here. My waitress seemed distracted and disinterested, and the service was quite slow, even though it was not a particularly crowded time.

My banana walnut pancakes were good and I liked the hot chocolate, which wasn't too sweet, nor too bitter. My bacon was not particularly crispy, but rather a bit too greasy for me. I would go here again, despite the little imperfections, though."}
{"text":"I had the farmers omelette, which was amazing. My friend had the breakfast burrito which he really liked, but it came with an inexplicable amount of shredded lettuce on the side for some reason. The restaurant was nice and clean, and it was busy for a Saturday but not unbearably so. I do wish that they had some breakfast meats for people who can't eat beef or pork, but that's a minor critique. We'll definitely be visiting again."}
{"text":"After remembering seeing the Dor-Stop on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, we stopped here for breakfast on a Sunday morning at around 10AM.  Beating the brunch rush was great.  We had a short wait but were seated quickly.  Service was friendly, if a bit rushed.  My omelette was tasty, as were the accompanying home fries.  Everything was fresh and well-prepared.  I would return, and it's the kind of local joint I'll look forward to bringing out-of-town guests to."}
{"text":"The food was OK, but the service was slow.  This restaurant is really small and crowded."}
{"text":"Their hot cakes are the best around! The best \"fall\" combo is the pumpkin chocolate chip hot cakes, I even get them in the summer, so tasty! If you live in Pittsburgh and have never been here, this should be your next breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Raspberry stuffed French toast.  A massive omlet with everything but the kitchen sink in it.  Home cooked flavor from open faced sandwiches to bacon and eggs.  This is why you go to The Dor-Stop.

As busy as this place gets, there's always a seat ready when you go to walk in.  It's like magic.  This is an essential Sunday breakfast spot in Pittsburgh up there with Pamela's.  More than affordable you will leave stuffed."}
{"text":"After watching Diner's Drive In's and Dives this restaurant caught our attention.  After finally making it to Pittsburgh it was the first place we tried! I had the Jumbot (the mix of potatoes, eggs, ham. peppers, onion and cheese etc) It was great and hit the spot perfect with a Pumpkin Pancake! The coffee was hot, the service was friendly and quick, and very attentive! Great start to our trip to Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"For what it's worth, dor-stop isn't good as people say it was. People are fanatical about this place and its food. Is their food really tasty or they're popular because the network show? From my perspective, I detest their service, the service is notoriously horrible and unacceptable. Also the food was unpalatable. I order pumpkin flavor pancakes and side order scramble eggs. I was too full and their portion is huge so I left two pieces of pancakes. The waitress don't even bother to ask me if I need a box to take it home or if everything is good. Although she did refilled my coffee once, I barely see her stop by and there wasn't too many people in the diner is isn't likely she is occupied by that amount of customers.I think the waitress was rude because she never say thank you during the entire breakfast even when I tipped her. I should have known, I just feel like they treated me differently that's all. This review is based on my dinning experience and the service. Seriously if they mean business they should improve. Especially waitress was lack of enthusiasm. Do I want to come back? Never ever."}
{"text":"We met friends there for breakfast yesterday (they were able to accommodate our group of five by having one of us sit on the windowsill, but he's thin; ha ha) and we LOVED the Dor-Stop!  It's not very large and it's *very* popular (we arrived at 9:00 a.m. [on a Sunday] and it was already very crowded, which we normally wouldn't want to bother with.  However; we knew about that situation in advance, and actually we didn't have to wait too terribly long for a table).

I ordered a vegetarian (three-egg) omelette with egg whites, which came with toast & hash browns - and my husband ordered a vegetarian burrito.  We both ordered coffee, too.  The food was *delicious* & portions were quite sufficient, and the coffee was pretty good (a little too weak, but better than at most diners [and also more expensive, at $1.89]).

Our server was *terrific*; she had a great sense of humor (we had a very amusing conversation with her) and she was also very attentive.  The people at the cash register (who also took names for tables) were friendly, too.  Afterwards, I complimented the wife half of the owner couple (who have owned the Dor-Stop for 26 years) and also their daughter & the (three) cooks.  All of them were very friendly and the cooks had a great sense of humor.

Our (two) meals cost $22.17 with tax (but before the tip).  The restroom was clean, too."}
{"text":"Just like the TV show claims, this place is no joke (diners drive-ins and dives).

So go with one friend, you'll get sat faster.  Then, order your pancake choice (chocolate chip just makes sense) and the scrambled up thing that I forget the name of.  Just them them you want the thing you're supposed to get that's not pancakes, they'll know.  And share it all.

Fantastic.  And it's so close.  I should brunch there weekly."}
{"text":"This hurts my heart to write this because I want to like this place soooooo bad. Small town diners are what I live for.  I went a week or so ago for the first time and will give it a second try and can hopefully give a high rating.

I read the rave review of the pancakes, and this guy LOVES pancakes. On the fence between oatmeal and pumpkin, I opted for pumpkin. The fact that I was able to get this in March made me a happy guy.

To my dismay, I should've picked up some powdered donuts and buttered them up. It would've been more moist. They tasted like sugar. I didn't get any cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin flavor I was so desperately hoping for. Just super sweetness. They were very dry as well. I love a nice moist pancake and was bummed it didn't happen.

Another lesson, don't order grits north of the Mason Dixon line. I keep forgetting everybody does instant or minute maid grits without seasoning or butter. My bad on that. I have to try the oatmeal pancakes and give this joint redemption. Service was very good and ambiance was perfect, hence 3 stars."}
{"text":"The best breakfast ever. Choc chip pancakes did not need syrup- bacon suitable crisp and flavorful."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and you can't go wrong with anything from their menu. When I heard they were under new management, I was sad, hoping that the quality of the food wouldn't change. But good news! The food is still amazing! My favorites are the eggs benedict, Lori's stuffed French toast and any of the hot cakes. But like I said, you can't go wrong with anything you order. Hands down, the best place for weekend brunch."}
{"text":"Crowded but serves a killer breakfast...highly recommended"}
{"text":"We've been here several times, and the food is always good. Nothing spectacular, or amazing, but always filling and tasty. Typical breakfast fare. I love anything benedict, but as a veggie, hate havint to pay for the ham, and order it w/o ham. So a waitress here taught me a little money saving trick, which I will always be grateful. Order texas toast, two eggs over easy and a side of hollandaise sauce. Then build your own eggs benedict. Saves a vegetarian about $2 on a main which is great!
    I would give it four stars if it weren't for the insane busy-ness of this place. It would be really great if they could expand. They also could really use chairs and benches outside for people who are waiting. I'm sure it's better during the week, but as a 40 hour a week working couple, weekends are the only time we can make it there."}
{"text":"My husband and I took my parents to The Dor-Stop to try a new place for Sunday brunch. The first thing that caught my eye was that this restaurant was visited by Guy Fieri on his Food Network TV Show \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives\"! Being a Food Network lover myself, I was pleasantly surprised. We arrived at 10:30am and had to make our way through the line of waiting people to put our name in for table. The line extended out of the door as we were told it would be about a half hour before we were seated which was reasonable considering the length of the line. We were seated within that time frame as the lined continued to grow. 

After we were seated we were instantly served by a waitress with water and any additional beverages that were requested. The menu had selections focused on breakfast and lunch, a variety that would satisfy anyone walking through the door. From eggs, hot cakes, and french toast, to burgers, and sandwiches, the options are there. I ordered the Banana Chocolate Chip Premium Hot Cakes as recommended by our waitress and they were outstanding! They were loaded with chocolate chips and bananas alike, with both items used as toppings as well. I could not have been more pleased with my selection. My mother ordered the Stuffed  Raspberry French Toast, the feature on Guy's TV Show, and it was exceptional. The portions were more than generous and the service was excellent. The waitresses worked together to make sure that all the customers needs were met especially as the waiting line continue to grow outside of the restaurant's walls.

The interior of the diner has a retro feel with a multi-colored tile floor, small booths and tables with limited walking space in between, a sit down food bar with old fashioned bar stools, and a color palette of greens and tans throughout. Numerous pictures of individuals were scattered on the walls and large windows with deep window sills allow customers to observe the streets of Dormont. There is free on-street parking throughout the area but if one chooses to go on a weekend, as we did, one may have to walk a few blocks to the restaurant. 

If you are willing to wait outside or in tight spaces for a half hour for diner food, this is a place you must try! Make sure to stop by before early afternoon breakfast, brunch, or lunch as they close by 3pm Mon-Sat, and 2pm on Sunday!"}
{"text":"This is a classic. 

If you like old diner throw-backs with quality food...you should get there early. With only a handful of tables the demand for seating and stuffed French toast is always at a high. 

They've been featured on DDD and deserve more credit than that. 

Great for couples, families, solo and for hangovers."}
{"text":"I typically enjoy my visits to the Dor-Stop.  The banana and chocolate-chip pancakes are probably the best pancakes that I've ever tried.  I appreciate that they have some vegetarian breakfast options.  The line at this place is always crazy, but if it's a nice day, it's no big deal.  We sometimes wander over to the small bookstore.  My husband loves the \"Guy's Version\" of Vicki's Jumbot ham.   i usually get an omelet, and they're ok.  Nothing out of this world.  I'm not a big fan of the potatoes of any version at Dor-Stop, and I think to me, that's the biggest disappointment.  Other than that, the pancakes alone are worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Don't believe the hype.  I will tell it to you straight.  Good oatmeal and good portion.  Coffee weak.  Fries are low quality, batter coated, tasteless, and very small portion.  Main complaint is the \"sausage wafers\" and \"bacon shavings\".   Since these are the most expensive items for the owner, he/she provides the customer with sausage thinner than a quarter and see-through bacon, with very small portions for both.  Did not try pancakes, but will assume they will be good since pancake batter leans more toward low-cost such as oatmeal, cereal, other such items.  Will not return.  Sausage was also greasy and very little spices to it, more like it was microwaved.  Forget your dreams of a thick, burger like fresh sausage patty filled with sage and other country spices that is about 4 ounces thick and substantial...what you will get instead at the Dor-Stop is a lukewarm, greasy, wafer-like sausage impersonation.  Forget about your dreams of thick, sizzling hot, applwood smoked bacon slices that are 6 inches long and quarter-inch thick.  What you will get instead at the Dor-Stop is lukewarm bacon pieces/shavings that are greasy and see-through.  This is all the truth."}
{"text":"Great pancake combinations (Oatmeal Raisin Pancakes) and Eggs Benedict styles. Friendly service, competitive prices, bustling Western PA diner atmosphere. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Just like any other diner. The food is good, but I don't understand why there's an hour wait every day. I know it was on television and all, but it really just tastes like any other breakfast food. Not worth the hour wait and the claustrophobia within the walls."}
{"text":"Best breakfast around Pittsburgh, love coming here when we get a chance.  Never disappointed and I'm sure you won't be either. AWESOME"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to come here for awhile and we finally had a free weekend to stop in. We came on a nice warm sunny Saturday around 1. We were seated immediately. 
We are huge fans of triple d so we like to visit all the places Guy has stopped . When we sat down, we weren't exactly ready to order, so our server said she would return. We looked through the menu and found what we wanted. Another woman came over to take our order not our waitress. She took our order and we just hung out. 
Our food came out about 20 minutes later. My boyfriend order Guy's Jumbot and I had the spicy omelette no cheese with grits and wheat toast. The food came out hot and ready for us to eat. My boyfriend loved his meal and said it was just enough food for him (he has a heart appetite). My omelette was a decent size but didn't have many jalapeños in it so that was disappointing. Overall, the meal was good but the service was not super great. The restaurant was pretty empty and we didn't order too much. We just needed water and we didn't get a refill which was frustrating. Not a huge deal but worth mentioning .
We will most likely return !"}
{"text":"Well, looks like I'm adding yet another 5-star review for Dor-Stop. But hey, they definitely deserve it! In fact Dor-Stop is so good that I came here two days in a row a couple weekends ago - once for a sit-down meal, and once to get a meal to-go just so I could try a second item on the menu.

I actually hadn't eaten at Dor-Stop in years until earlier this month - their hours and my schedule don't tend to mesh. But one afternoon I just happened to be using 1/2 a vacation day, so I came with a family member. Since it was the middle of the day on a Friday, the place was fairly empty, which I definitely didn't mind - this place is pretty cozy and so it gets cramped quickly during weekend dining rushes.

But on to the food, the important part of this review! My dining companion ordered a salad - complete with French fries, 'cause that's how we do salads in Pittsburgh - and I ordered their Feta Burger. Sure, their Raspberry stuffed french toast caught my eye...but Feta burger! How often do you see that on the menu? And I loved that burger, by the way - it was well cooked and the toppings blended perfectly (I snagged a few mushrooms from my companion's salad which made it even better), and definitely felt like good diner food. I left feeling super happy with my meal.

Buuuuut...the next day I still couldn't get that french toast of my mind. I just couldn't. So I called in an order for pick-up - good thing I did, too, because there was nowhere to sit when I came in! Saturdays are definitely jam-packed here, understandably so. Well, I got my food, brought it home, and proceeded to devour it. Just, YUM! Seriously - that french toast is a MUST!

If I was going to complain about anything it would be that the seating really isn't the most comfortable on the planet, buuuuut...I can't hold it against them. I just can't. Not after that french toast. See you next time, Dor-Stop!"}
{"text":"Great little local diner!! Must go if your in town.  Food was amazing and all made from scratch!!  Had the Pumkin Stuffed French Toast today!! Perfect size portions. Wait staff super friendly. Gets crowded, but never a long wait. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The Eggs Benedict was delicious.  The Dorstop does a good job with hollandaise sauce.  My husband got a ham omelet and his was very good as well.  The place was crowded this morning and I can understand why.  The food is delicious and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Though Pittsburgh is flooded with incredible B/L/D locations and is quickly becoming a foodie destination, Dor-Stop remains one of my favorite breakfast places (if you can get in!). 

The food has that home-cooked comfort food taste every pallet can appreciate. The \"greasy spoon\" vibe here is charming and extremely low-key, though their pride regarding appearing in Diners Drive-Ins and Dives is made very apparent (and rightfully so).

I variety of specialty pancakes is very enticing. We're not talking crepes here either. These things are a seriously thick, wide cake feast. I personally love the oatmeal pancakes the most, but enjoy every kind I try. The Raspberry filled French toast is now my favorite dish. It's not truly filled, but rather \"crowned\" with a creaming light raspberry filling. The toast is crusted in corn flakes, which doesn't sound as good as it actually is.

I have visited with friends and enjoyed the experience, but only recently did I bring my 4yr old and 3yr old nephew and niece--a dangerous proposition at many restaurants. We were greeted with a smile upon arrive and the children received special placemats and crayons to keep them occupied while we waited a short period of time for our breakfast. The children's selections were appropriately prices and portioned and at no point in time did I feel as though I had made a mistake bringing them to one of my favorite breakfast locations."}
{"text":"This place is only AMAZING!  They seated us as fast as possible despite the long line out the door!  The food was nothing less than amazing (definitely try the French Toast and the sausage gravy and biscuits!).  Their waitresses are also 100% efficient without losing that caring touch! Our waitress was extremely attentive which is not something you expect with a place that's this packed and has all the hustle and bustle. Definitely  coming back!"}
{"text":"Cute little diner spot, a little outside Pittsburgh. I enjoyed myself! Despite what appeared to be a waiting line, I got a spot at the counter right away. I had a clear view of watching the cooks flip up pancakes and scramble eggs- pretty fun. The food was good. I found out about this place from DDD. If you are in the Pittsburgh area and have time to stop, I would recommend it :) It's a little spot and has diner hours, so make sure you go when they're open. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Used to be... until Guy, Now it seems they rest on those Laurels. Well loved hotcakes now always raw and mushy in the middle. Potato pancakes? limp and soggy. This is based on more than one visit.
Last time service was dreadful. No water refills. Order was wrong, twice with no apology.  Charged for wrong order and for something not ordered at all."}
{"text":"Great Breakfasts!  Worth the wait to get a table since Diners,Drive ins and Dives had been there. Pancakes are very fluffy and waffles too!"}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST I'VE EVER HAD!!! I had the Guy's Version of the Jumblot. My girlfriend had the chocolate chip banana pancakes. These were the best pancakes I've ever eaten. They have a texture and gooeyness that I've never had in a pancake. The Guy's Version was eggs, potatoes, jalapeños, tomato, cheddar, and hot sausage. The hot sausage had the most amazing flavor. 

Everyone should definitely make a trip here once! Pancakes are to die for!!"}
{"text":"Went here thanks to numerous recommendations from other yelpers. We were glad we did. Definitely small, so a wait should be expected on busy weekend mornings. Luckily we went during the week so we were seated immediately.  Food was great though, and service was quick and friendly.

It's in a neat area too so come for breakfast/brunch then take a walk."}
{"text":"Had breakfast here while in Pittsburgh for a few days. The place will remind you of a mom & pop breakfast shop, it has that home cooked feel. I took the advice of fellow yelpers and went later in the day. I was a party of one and there was a small table available. I decided to try the chocolate chip & banana pancakes, they were very tasty, but got a bit mushy in the center, they weren't undercooked they were just loaded with bananas. I had a side of bacon to complete breakfast and freshly brewed iced tea to wash it all down. 
Service wasn't bad but could have been better, my server never stopped by after my food was served and i had to request my check from a different server. 
Good breakfast, I recommend giving them a try"}
{"text":"Great place. My first time there was today and we went for breakfast. I had one of the specials, a peanut butter banana bread French toast. I loved that it was something very original as compared to a standard breakfast item you can get anywhere. 

It was three good sized pieces of banana bread, with a good thickness to them, and definitely filled me up. The only thing that I would say is missing was a little more peanut butter taste, as I didn't get much of one. Other than that it was great. The side of bacon that came with it was also a good portion size.

The overall price of $32 for three people was fairly priced and they had a bunch of other things on the menu that I would have wanted to try as well. I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"The food here is amazing. I've never had something I didn't like and the serving sizes are enormous! The place is a little small, but service is fast. Well worth the wait if there is one."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Their pancakes are amazing! This is a go-to place in the South Hills. The service is always friendly and fast. Casual and laid back atmosphere, good coffee. A Pittsburgh staple. I took my family here for breakfast when they visited from New York and they loved it too."}
{"text":"To be honest, I really don't understand all the hype about Dor-Stop. Maybe it's the fact that it was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dive? Or it gives you that small town, homey diner feel? None the less, I have definitely experienced better.

We stopped in on a Saturday morning to meet my brother in law's family for breakfast. They arrived 10 mins earlier than us and were able to get seated right away. Because there were 9 of us, they had to accommodate accordingly in their small facility so things around our table were a bit cramped. No big deal though, it's understandable. 

Dor-Stop is known for their pancakes but because I am not fan, I opted for the Potato Pancake breakfast which came with 2 potato pancakes and 2 eggs, cooked to your liking. You are able to add a side of meat for $2. I added bacon with mine. Our food took quite some time to come out. There were 2 tables that came in after us that received their meals before us. Kind of irritating as we're all on the verge of getting hangry, but we assumed they're holding some plates behind so they could bring all of our meals out together. I really wasn't too impressed with my meal. The potato pancakes were good but they're very greasy as was the bacon. I had to use a napkin to soak up some of the excess grease. The eggs were good though. They're light and fluffy which is how I like my eggs to be when scrambled. 

The staff member who was refilling our coffee was very nice, our waitress though, was not. She was not very attentive and never had a smile on her face. She got an attitude when my husband asked for an orange juice to go and snatched our check off the table because she had to add another OJ to it. This could've been easily fixed if she were to ask if any of us needed anything else before bringing our checks out. He also asked for a to go box in which he never received it. My brother in law's mother had to go up to the counter to get her box because our waitress didn't bring hers either.. Maybe it was because she was too busy chatting in the corner with another staff member to even pay attention.

All in all, it wasn't a very pleasant experience and I was not impressed, which is quite upsetting since I've heard many great things about it."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, good food fun place, but they don't serve any butter, none in the restaurant at all.  If you don't like margarine you're out of luck, and they definitely don't care, either, they took quite an attitude about it when asked.  How hard is it to buy some single serves and keep them in the refrigerator for those who ask?"}
{"text":"Four stars for the food, three stars for the service. I was really disappointed by the fact that the waitress tried to charge us for bringing in Starbucks coffee. Granted that I later discovered the sign on the door that indicates no outside food or drinks; however, it's also the smallest sign on the door. Furthermore, I didn't appreciate the fact that this was brought up to us after we were seated. They clearly saw us come in with the coffee in hand, as we had to wait to be seated.

In my opinion, this could have been handled better. Most places would remind you of their policy and ask that you note it for the future. Instead, we were railroaded to pay for two outside coffees. Accordingly, we changed our order to go because of this.

With that said, I'm still giving this establishment four stars because I truly enjoyed the food. I just wish that they had better customer service, as I most likely will not return due to that distasteful encounter."}
{"text":"But If you want to beat Mark at Axis & Allies just tell him that he has to be a Russian sub and nothing else - he'll get all g"}
{"text":"Like many others before me I came to the Dor-Stop with high expectations and let me tell you, my expectations were exceeded.

My girlfriend and I have been looking for a new breakfast spot for a while and the Dor-Stop has always been high on my list to try.

The place is classic, still has a bar counter, kitschy items adorn the walls and the a feeling that you are dining in your grandmother's restaurant. The place is always packed but we were quickly seated and like many have stated before my coffee cup never fell below 3/4 full before it was refilled.

Now lets get to the nitty gritty: the food.

I got the pancake breakfast, usually a very simple and easy breakfast but when the breakfast came I was so impressed. The hotcakes are so different, some would even say magical. They are so fluffy and moist and complimented their super crispy bacon. I almost wanted to fold the entire breakfast up and eat a giant pancake eggarito. My mouth is watering thinking about it.

My girlfriend got the breakfast sandwich which was very well done. Their ham is so succulent and tender. They cut it off the bone at the Dor-Stop and is shows. The sandwich is a work of art and is the classiest breakfast sandwich I have ever seen. 

I recommend this place to anyone and will definitely come back to try some other types of pancakes. They are the best in the city.

Oh and try the potato pancakes, they will rock your world."}
{"text":"This is probably our favorite place in the area for breakfast. Be prepared for a wait before being seated. Most of the items on the menu are pretty good. Service has declined a little over the last few years. The wait staff is a little pushy and outspoken- especially the one with neck tattoos. They could use to leave sweeteners on the table. Those are the only two reasons that I didn't give this place 5 stars. Otherwise, we love going here and we would recommend it to anyone who lives close by!"}
{"text":"The specialty hot cakes (pancake) is very good. The recommended dishes are superb. I got the crab Benedict and two of my friends got the guy's version. All of them are very tasty."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews on Yelp and had to give this place a try. I came in for lunch around 2 PM, when the restaurant wasn't too crowded. 

I found the diner itself to have a lot of character. The decor is interesting, and it's in a real quaint, old neighborhood. I sat at a table right at the window and could watch the people and traffic go by on the street. 

The turkey sandwich I had was a solid choice and was fixed in Pittsburgh style with fries and cole slaw in it. The interesting part was the potato pancakes that came with the sandwich. I liked the way they were prepared, and they had some seasoning that gave them a nice taste. It's good to have something a little different than fries or chips with a sandwich. 

Service was real quick and friendly, and prices were reasonable. This place merits the high rating it has received."}
{"text":"Love the dor-stop! One of the best breakfast places in Pittsburgh! Wait staff are always super friendly and on top of things and food is always delicious!! The wait can definitely be long especially on the weekends, but it's worth it!!"}
{"text":"Quick stop for brunch before heading into Canada. Nice small local place with a great staff. Everyone from the hostess to the waitress was very pleasant. 

The food was good, it hit the spot. I had the Crab Benedict and it was a decent portion. Wish it was larger but it was a fair size. 

Over all experience was a 3 1/2 stars"}
{"text":"This little diner was packed on a Sunday morning. It was recommended by a local who hadn't actually been but read a review and said it was featured on restaurant show. So our expectations were pretty high. My friend and I ordered the banana chocolate chip oatmeal pancakes and potato pancakes to share (because I can never decide to go sweet or savory for breakfast!) The potato pancakes were unremarkable: small, soggy, on the sweet side. The ham we ordered with them though was delicious. The oatmeal pancakes were perfect though and you get three huge, thick pancakes! I loved the hearty texture and I could even skip the syrup. My kids got French toast and feta burger raved about both. I wish the server had pointed out the specials menu though because our neighboring table ordered that and it looked amazing."}
{"text":"2 stars only for the food.  The food is what makes me come back...The service is horrible, it's what's keeping me away."}
{"text":"My breakfast was absolutely phenomenal. I specifically ordered the ham and eggs because it included their famous potato pancakes. They did not disappoint I tried every trick in the book to get what they put in them but no luck. I even promised some things I should be ashamed of LOL I would definitely recommend that if you are anywhere within 50 miles you need to make a trip here!"}
{"text":"Great food with a local twist.  Service was amazing.  Raspberry tea is a must try.  Kids got grilled cheese-yum!  Try fries with gravy.  Pancakes are too good to be real!!  This place is worth all the hype.  A must try and super kid friendly."}
{"text":"Amazing pancakes!!!  Best place for breakfast in Pittsburgh.

Ever since they were featured on the food network channel, the Dor-Stop is always packed on the weekends so you better get there early or be prepared to wait for 40 minutes.  It's worth the wait!  I love their banana nut pancakes - they are so moist and delicious!  They give you three enormous pancakes and for an extra charge you can also get bacon or sausage.  I always have one pancake to take home to eat for later and it still tastes great reheated.  This is my favorite spot for Saturday breakfast."}
{"text":"My nephew had a hockey game in the area, so I wanted to grab something for lunch. This place was the closest with the best reviews.
We waited for about 5-10 minutes for a table, it was 12pm so it was busy.
No need to write a review because it was awesome, portions were huge.
Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Very tasty.  Small, homey little place that we drove out to based on the reviews.  Pancakes were great...nice chew and texture to them, with a little crunch almost.  A nice change from your standard boring pancake.  The ham was juicy and a nice side as well.  Service was friendly.  Would not hesitate to return."}
{"text":"great breakfast place...period. worth the wait. had the stuffed french toast, and the bob's special. french toast was crisp and cooked perfectly, although not really stuffed, just an extra slather of raspberry jam. Bob's special was very tasty, German potato pancakes were a little under cooked but great tasting.  Service was quick and brisk, waited about 25 minutes on a Sunday morning, which was not bad but it was raining this day."}
{"text":"We had a good breakfast here although I felt the portion was a tad light. Everything we had which was a combo breakfast was tasty and the coffee was really good. I had scrambled eggs with bacon and pancakes.  The construction in the area is a loud annoyance but so be it. 
The paid parking is ridiculous but seems to be happening everywhere now. Thanks Dormont"}
{"text":"All of their food looks so good it was hard to decide. Ended up getting the veggie burrito and all I have to say it OMG!!  It was SO good. I will definitely be getting that again."}
{"text":"I've been going to Dor-Stop for years (well before the DDD crowd arrived).  While I'm thrilled to see Bob and Vicky's crew thriving, I do have to say that I miss being able to actually walk-in on a Saturday or Sunday without a line around the block.

Irregardless, when you're looking for unique spins on traditional diner fare, this is your joint.

The pancakes are all fantastic.  I've had every combination on the menu and then plenty more (they'll usually grant a request if they have the ingredients and they usually run a weekend special).  I highly suggest the apple walnut, banana chocolate chip, the oatmeal raisin, and most importantly...  PUMPKIN (the best in town).

Lori's Raspberry French Toast is the obligatory first dine, just stay away from the other iterations that aren't first coated in corn flakes prior to landing on the griddle.

The jumbots, eggs benedict, and potato pancakes all also represent fantastic choices.  If you have a choice of meat, hands down get the \"ham off the bone\".

One other key note...  Bob, Vicky, and their daughter Lori go out of their way to make people happy.  They always bring samples out to those waiting for a seat and offer coffee to hold people over when it's cold out.

If you're running solo or with one in tow, I recommend you check to see if there are spots at the bar (first come first serve)."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food, 1 star for service. The atmosphere and location were great. Since there was a wait we decided to sit at the bar. Not sure if that was a bad choice or not, since we got waited on right away. Once our food arrived no one came back to wait on us, we both needed refills on our water/coffee and placed them on the edge of the bar to make the process easier. There we multiple people around us to assist in this but no one made direct eye contact and we didn't want to waive them down, as this is their job and how they get tips. We decided we were done eating and they immediately took our plates, once that happened a lady who seemed like a manager came over and asked us if we wanted more coffee, but at that point we were so disappointed that we were ready to leave. We never even received our check or saw our waitress. We had to go pay without a check and tell them what we had ordered. We'll probably go back since it is close and the food was great, just hoping the service improves."}
{"text":"Fantastic. Best hotcakes around and I've never had a bad meal here.  The staff is friendly and personable."}
{"text":"This is your hole-in the wall diner. It lives up to the expectations, and I will say this: get there early!

I ordered something akin to a breakfast sampler, eggs, bacon, tater pancakes.  My friend ordered the raspberry french toast. 

The coffee, as others have stated, was a bottomless cup. Quite tasty too, as compared with many restaurants that will serve you the dregs of Folgers that essentially serve as methadone to the caffeine connoisseur/addict such as myself.

The french toast stole the day, it was hearty and delicious, with a yogurt/syrup topping. Definitely an indulgence. I did not give this 5 total stars as my eggs were slightly bland, and I love eggs. I will return to this marvelous establishment that really serves as a gem in Pgh neighborhood eating."}
{"text":"I love everything about the Dor-Stop. This place is a neighborhood staple that always delivers. I've only eaten breakfast here. You can usually expect a bit of a wait, but it's totally worth it. The french toast is my favorite but really everything is good. I love the local, friendly diner ambiance. The servers are all great. If you're really lucky and they like you enough, you might even get to taste to specials before you order. Do yourself a favor and try the Dor-Stop. You'll be hooked!"}
{"text":"The only place so far that can make a fabulous potato pancake!  Crowded table set up but well worth the discomfort!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once (yesterday) for breakfast.  I noticed that this place opens really early (6am) on weekdays so I had thought it would be a nice idea to get down to the Dor-Stop on our way out of Pittsburgh.

I was able to find parking on the street and the meters don't take effect until after 8am.  We had arrived around 7:35 so I figured we'd have enough time before I had to feed the meter.

There was only 2 other customers at the bar when we arrived.  We had our choice of seating and we had chosen to sit near the window.  Coffee up and ordered and our server was back consistently to make sure our coffees were filled.  On the table we noticed they had non dairy creamer and since both my wife and I aren't fans of non dairy creamer we had asked if we could have a small serving of milk and our server brought that over right away.

Being our first time I had to go through the menu to see what I was wanting.  I didn't want to eat too much since I had to drive back home but I did find something of interest.  My wife usually gets steak and eggs but she didn't this time.  I had sort of wanted her to get that so I could have some steak but she went with the ham and eggs with German potato pancakes and white toast.  

I had gone with the all American which was 1/3lb burger, eggs, and lyonese potatoes which is basically homefries with onions with toast.  I also ordered a side of bacon.  I noticed the side of bacon was 3.10 which is kind of a lot but they gave me probably 6 slices or more.  I'm used to only getting 3 or 4 slices usually.  

We didn't order anything that they could impress us with I suppose.  It's not like we went with an item like hotcakes or a skillet or anything like that just a relatively conservative breakfast.  I did have some of my wife's potato pancakes and ham and they were both very good.  My breakfast was just as I expected nothing out of the ordinary but still very good."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and the pancakes are fantastic! A few downsides, though. There's no free parking (meters available and a lot around the corner isn't enforced on Sundays) and there's always a wait. The wait for two hasn't been too bad for us- usually 15-20 minutes. Service is pretty good overall and it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Another 5-star find in the Pittsburgh area. I kid you not. Guy Fieri hyped the right place.  It is hands down the best diner in the universe.  Actually, I don't know that for sure, but I dare you to find a better diner anywhere in the United States.

The food here is made with love and that's what makes it stand out out. You can taste the love in every single bite.  The staff of this family-owned restaurant run like a well-oiled machine, used to the crazy crowds that come here every day to blow their diets and binge.  This was all a girl could ask for on a cheat day.

I had Vicki's Italian Jumbot but with Guy Fieri's twist on it, making it a little more spicy. It was more than enough for Jim and I to share.  We also shared the fantastic pumpkin pancakes. They do not need syrup at all. So fluffy, so delicious and gut-busting.  Why do I have to live in D.C?  I would be here every weekend for brunch.  There is nothing like this place over here..wahhh!   This place is great for sharing so order different dishes and eat them family style. The portions are gigantic and unforgiving! 

Anyway, do not come to Dor-Stop thinking they have become over-commercialized because  of their appearance on the Food Network. They have not. They are the same family-owned established where you can get no nonsense  service and absolutely amazing food.  If you are in Pittsburgh, run don't walk to Dormont and grab a seat at Dor-Stop.  This is a glutton's dream come true."}
{"text":"I'm not ashamed to admit it - I was skeptical.  As a long-time lover of Pamela's, I just couldn't see this place making me happy when we discovered Pamela's in the Strip was closed on Memorial Day.  The wait was torturous at the Dor-Stop too...however, it was a holiday so I suppose i understand.  And when we did finally get seated, the AMAZING hot cakes, SUPERB hash browns, and perfectly cooked eggs really made my morning!

I prefer my hot cakes to be thin and flat, and when I saw the ones here, I was unsure again.  But the taste will BLOW YOUR MIND.  I got the apple cinnamon ones - they are crispy yet fluffy with apples that taste very fresh and just the right amount of cinnamon.  I even enjoyed the butter as a sweet additive to a decadent treat!  The potatoes were also amazing - true lyonnaise style with crispy outsides, warm insides, and plenty of onions.  Eggs were standard fair, but overeasy is often executed poorly... so props for getting it exactly right.  Several of my friends also ordered different flavors of hot cakes and suggested the oatmeal ones are really not to be missed as well.

Despite the long wait and weird waitress, we all LOVED our breakfast and I was full for hours after.  YUM!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The banana walnut pancakes were fluffy and flavorful! I almost didn't even reach for the syrup they were so yummy. Eggs made to perfection. There are several specialty pancakes on the menu...I'll definitely be returning to try more!"}
{"text":"Service was great. We were seated right away. We tried the apple and pumpkin pancakes. They were really thick but incredibly tasty. I loved the bacon. French toast and fried potatoes were good. Coffee was hot."}
{"text":"The Dor-Stop, we all have heard of this and have seen it on TV...each time I have tried to visit on the weekend the line has been quite lengthy.  But we went today (Friday) around 9am and was able to be seated right away.

The pancakes are what they are known for, so my arm was twisted and I had to try them.  I ordered up the Chocolate Chip Banana Pancakes with some bacon.  My early morning date went with Vicki's Italian Jumbot.  Both breakfast dishes were awesome.  The pancakes were light, fluffy and moist.  Ample amounts of bananas and chocolate chips.  I opted to forego the syrup and eat these up as is.  I was not disappointed.  It is like eating dessert for breakfast.   My date had the Italian Jumbot.  I have no idea what was going on with this dish, but wow it worked.  I stuck my fork into her dish numerous times to try it despite the 'angry scowls'.  There is a lot of potatoes, ham, eggs, onions, peppers, cheese and tomatoes in this hodgepodge.  

The service was friendly, fast and efficient.  They were always coming around offering up more coffee which I gladly accepted.  

The prices are well within reason.  They are equivalent to other diners but the food is WAY better than your standard diner.  

Hit this place up anytime you can...I wish I still lived in Mt. Lebanon so that I could roll into here each and every weekend."}

{"text":"Very cool place. 

I like:
- Lots on the menu. Big variety. 
- Food is great (details below).
- Friendly staff, from \"hello\" to \"come again.\"
- Prices are very reasonable for what you get. Nice. 

Dislike:
- Okay, there's not a lot of parking around. And Dormont does enforce (I watched a car get a ticket at an expired meter while
I dined...).

I got a traditional breakfast. The home fries are great - big chunks, browned and crunchy on one side, but soft on the other, with a good mix of each. 

My sausage patties were great, as was my Italian bread toast. Yes, they even have grits!  Thank you. 

Eggs may be eggs, but my scrambled ones were on the fluffy side and were served very hot. I asked to have cheddar added, which I highly recommend. 

For dessert (yes, breakfast can have a dessert), I split the cinnamon roll with my lovely wife. It's great, too - soft and warm and homemade, with a raspberry drizzle. 

I'll go back to try lunch stuff next."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast place! My husband had guy's jumpot and I had the stuffed french toast. They were both amazing, huge portion as well! The coffee was flowing freely and the service was great. We came at 8am on Saturday and didn't have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"Let's start with the conclusion - this place is the very best breakfast diner in Pittsburgh.  

Why?  In very large part, because *everything* on the menu is made fresh daily.  This includes the ham, which the restaurant roasts every morning, complete with their own glaze.  The ham is cut from the bone to order, absolutely succulent, with a hint of clove.  The ham alone is reason enough to visit this place, but that isn't even the best offering.

First are the pancakes, which includes specialty pancakes like apple and cinnamon and pumpkin - all of which (including buttermilk pancakes) are among the very best pancakes I've ever eaten.  The batter is prepared fresh every morning.  They have a slightly crispy exterior (plenty of butter and sugar in the batter) and fluffy center.  The apple and cinnamon pancakes are so good that I don't even eat them with syrup lest I mask the subtle flavors of cinnamon, cream, vanilla, and apples in the batter - a dusting of powdered sugar and a smear of half-melted butter is all that's needed to elicit an involuntary eyes-rolling-into-the-back-of-the-head expression of pleasure.  Seriously, these pancakes are DAMN good!

Second, all the egg entrees are fabulous!  Try the eggs benedict - that juicy ham, fresh cut from the bone, piled high atop two thick slabs of toasted Italian bread, topped with sunny-side-up eggs, and freshly prepared hollandaise.  Fantastic.  The omelets are great, and the \"jumbot\" - an \"everything in the prep table\" hash of stuff and scrambled eggs will satisfy the heartiest of diners.

The food here is really top-notch.  I realize that it's just a diner, but when I see and taste food this good, and this lovingly prepared, I want to see *everything* as perfect as most of the food.  With that in mind, I'd really like to see the restaurant offer real maple syrup - not the imitation \"table syrup\" stuff that I've seen them pour from a milk-carton-type paper container into the syrup bottles!  I'd gladly even pay a $1 premium to have real syrup with those delectable pancakes.  Also, I'd beg them to consider making their own biscuits, and possible serving them with a sausage (or sausage and herb?) gravy.  I'd *crawl* to the Dor-Stop from my home to eat there!

This place is PACKED on the weekends - be prepared to wait unless you get there very early.  The wait, however, will be worth it.  I eat here at least once nearly every weekend for breakfast."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best breakfast spots in Pittsburgh.  Okay, maybe the best.  I can't say the best for sure, though, because I haven't made my way through then entire list of breakfast places around the city.  But I'm working on it, though.  (I even have a spreadsheet.)

I've had everything from the pancakes to the eggs burrito to daily specials.  I always know it's going to be delicious, I'm going to struggle to finish the portions and I will leave happy both with my meal and the bill.  I'd like to be able to recommend one thing over another, but I really can't.  Everything I've eaten at The Dor-Stop has been a great and satisfying breakfast.  The pancakes are sweet, the bacon is always crisp and I can't find anything bad to say about an omlet special that includes bologna (aka jumbo).  

I guess my best recommendation has nothing to do with menu items: go on a weekday.  Weekends this place is hopping and there will likely be a wait.  Sure, it will be worth it, but if you can swing by early on a weekday you won't have to and the food will be just as good.  A friend of mine will call me now when she has to take her car to the dealership on West Liberty Avenue because she knows I will take her to the Dor-Stop.  It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy to share one of my happy places with a friend so it can be one of her happy places, too."}
{"text":"This place is a small, diner style restaurant that my husband and I stumbled upon while still dating.  What a find!  This is the best breakfast in Pittsburgh.  It's cheap, and delicious.  You won't need to eat lunch!  Unless you get there at the same time as the church crowd on a sunday, seating is usually not a problem.  I recommed the Bob's Breakfast and the Raspberry stuffed French Toast.  Their bacon is always done perfectly. They are a family run business, and if you go two times or more, they will remember you, and sometimes even your name..!  They have moved locations recently- (just across the street) to accommodate more customers, and they have become non-smoking!  Yeay!"}
{"text":"In general, one of my favorite breakfast places to go to in Pittsburgh. Setting of the restaurant is more like a diner than it is a restaurant, but that does nothing to detract from what it's best at serving: good old-fashioned breakfast food. The pancakes here are quite fantastic ... my favorite kind being the banana chocolate chip pancakes. Yeah, it's probably not light on calories, but to be honest, that's not really a thought if you opt to go for these. The chocolate chips are warm and well-melted into the actual pancake itself, making for one delicious yummy bite after the next. Their hot cakes are also a nice choice along with the stuffed raspberry French toast, which was oh so good. The raspberry sauce was actually not as tangy as I anticipated ... which is a good thing, considering that it would have been a sore spot (too sour) if it contrasted too much with the sweet consistency of the dish. In general this is a great breakfast spot to hit up ... oh and also a decent joint for sandwiches, my favorite being the Russian Reuben with the tender beef, great sauerkraut, along with the cheese & thousand island dressing combo that make for a delicious combination."}
{"text":"Great place! Long wait, but def worth it!"}
{"text":"Great food. Poor service.  The waitress seemed annoyed when we asked for sweet n low for our iced tea.   Served pancakes without butter. Asked for it but never received. Never offered to refill our drinks. Never asked how everything."}
{"text":"Best pancakes and breakfast in Pittsburgh.  I get the Egg Combo (2 eggs, bacon and pancakes) for $8.99 and it's amazing."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places for breakfast but the quality has diminished noticeably. Eggs over medium were runny and the pumpkin pancakes, that used to be my reason for going, lacked flavor...they were very bland and were a little raw on the inside. Maybe the food is better when they aren't so busy?"}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  Pancakes are super rich, good luck finishing them.  The jumpot could use more meat but overall fantastic. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast. Regular pancakes rocked. Staff was super and we were seated immediately on a Saturday. So lucky. My first 5 star rating on Yelp."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place as we were in Pittsburgh for the day. We went in for brunch and there was a long line of people waiting. We were told that the wait would be 20 minutes, so we put our names down and stepped outside to kill some time. When we came back 20 mins. later we were told that they had called our names 5 mins. ago but the hostess was nice enough to tell me that she would seat us next. 

I ordered the oatmeal walnut pancakes with a side of sausages. The pancakes were really good and I was pleasantly surprised since I didn't know what to expect.

The only reason why I am not giving this place 5 stars is that when we were done eating and ready to pay our waitress all of sudden brought me a pancake and said there was a shortage of pancakes so she was sorry. I thought it was a bit deceptive on her end for not mentioning this to me earlier when she served us our food.

Because when we received our food I thought it was strange that I only received two stacks of pancakes, but didn't question it thinking that since it was a \"specialty pancake\" I was suppose to only get two. It couldve been an honest mistake, but I still felt that she should have mention this to me earlier."}
{"text":"Ahh, Guy Fieri, you've led me astray. The food at The Dor-Stop Restaurant is solid but unimpressive. My vegetarian Jumbot came out with the cheese looking decidedly congealed (it was, I watched the dish sit under the warming station for 10 minutes.)  Spicy?
Not particularly.  The pumpkin pancakes had good flavor, but were doughy and undercooked.

Service can make up for a multitude of food sins. Unfortunately, here it didn't.  The service, at least on my visit, was obviously from the culture of \"No.\"

Me: Hi, can you serve the Jumbot as a burrito? (Same basic ingredients as the burrito).

Server:  No.

Me:  Ok, how about a side of pierogies?

Server:  No. That's only for the special.

Service efficiency was also lacking.  25 minutes to get an order of pancakes?

Good bye Dor-Stop. I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  We arrived on Saturday around 1PM and were seated immediately. The place was packed with all ages of people- toddlers to seniors.  The atmosphere was energetic and lively with friendly and quick service.  My husband ordered one of the specials- The Benny ( eggs benedict made with potato pancakes); I ordered  banana and chocolate chip pancakes.  Both were delicious- my husband loved the potato pancakes and the benedict sauce.  The pancakes were very good- had that natural banana flavor with large slices of bananas throughout.  We'll be going back to try other items."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places in the burgh! I have to admit, I am one of those food nerds that wants to go to every place that guy from drive ins dinners and dives has been. That is how I discovered this place and I am super glad I did! 

They are famous for their pancakes and it is clear why that is- their amazing. I've had their banana oatmeal, pumpkin and banana pancakes. All amazing and HUGE. Their Italian jumbot was also featured on the show- incredible and spicy which is what I really liked about it. Their hot chocolate is amazing- sooo chocolatey and just the best hot coco around. 

The service is that of a typical diner, so nothing amazing. It's small and not meant for people to stay and chat for hours. 

Overall, I adore the dor stop. Super cute and always delicious. A favorite for sure."}
{"text":"This place has NEVER disappointed when it comes to the food coming out of their kitchen. The lines occasionally go out the door but the wait is never very long. I have had many different items off the menu as it is a place my girlfriend and I frequent.

If you can ever get the Sausage Gravy and Biscuits, I would highly recommend, and this is coming from a very country boy who was raised on amazing pepper gravy and biscuits. I would be at Dor-Stop all the time if they had the sausage gravy on demand.

Note: This is not the norm and the waitress seemed to be having a bad day. The only problem I have ever really had was when one of the waitresses didn't put forth much effort. She never stopped by to fill our drinks. Asked for our order and that was it. Even though we were friendly and polite, we never received the same in return. I understand that people have bad days. The waitresses here are very nice, but they are human and have their off days. Like I said, this was only one time, and on a subsequent visit, she was much more cheery and friendly. Everyone is human.

I would recommend that anyone in the area give this place a try for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Fantastic! Not from around here and felt right at home!! Food is amazing, awesome hole in the wall local spot! It's a must try!!"}
{"text":"Ive heard nothing but great things about this place so today i met my bff there for brunch the food was good but the service was horrible our waitress never made eye contact with us people that came in after us got their food before us cause the strawberry blonde that waited on us nevercame back to our table and when she did still no personal contact she was pouring coffee for another table and had maybe 6 teaspons of coffee left in her pot she pour it right over my friends head and never came back with more when she took our order she still never made eye contact so when our bill came back she had the checks wrong there was 4 of us 3 on 1 check and me on mine no big deal we had to ask other servers for jelly or anything else we wanted .when we went outside we saw a board with the specials on it they looked awesome definitely would of ordered them if we only new next time i go back i will make sure she doesn't wait on me yes i will go back cause the food was good cant blame the owner for a rude server i have been a bartender for 40 years and im in shock that they would let someone like that work there"}
{"text":"I recently walked to the Dor-Stop from my new place in Dormont. I've heard good things, including (of course) that they were featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.

It was a weekday at around 11am, and the place was still packed. I sat at the counter after a brief wait, because it was the only available seat in the house. The gentleman next to me, as it turns out, is related to the restaurant owner. He gets a five-star review, but I swear I'm not even taking that into account with my official five-star Yelp rating.

The wait staff was very busy, but also attentive. Great mix of friendly and efficient. I couldn't decide what to order - everything sounded amazing. I ended up getting banana chocolate chip pancakes with bacon. The pancakes were probably the best I've ever tasted. A little crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. I used ZERO syrup. I prefer my bacon a little crispier, but it was still good.

I'll be back to sample a more lunch-y entree. In the mean time, though, five stars for sure!"}
{"text":"Been reading about this place on the Internet and was really looking forward to it. Went for breakfast on a Monday morning, and this is clearly the place to go to in the area plus it only got busier as the day went on. Opens at 6, but went at 8:30 and still plenty of seats. No guarantees on later around lunch time though haha. Definitely more of a diner feel as opposed to a restaurant, especially with the open kitchen and smaller seating area. 

Down to it: I ended up getting the Meat Lover's Omelette with Grits and Rye toast on the side. Toast you can't really go wrong with but they definitely butter it up less than some of your other counterpart breakfast places. The grits were misleading at first (confused them with the apple sauce for some reason) but definitely nice with some salt and pepper (butter too if you must). The omelette was great though. Good amount of meat inside and the eggs were cooked enough yet not dry or oily at all. 

Additionally ordered the Bob's potato pancakes which are essentially flattened hash browns. Not bad at all but had an unusual sweetness to them which was confusing with their oily nature. 

Service was better than average, our waitress was nice and conversed with us at length; she kept us in the loop with what was happening with our food which is always a plus.

My main concern is the pancakes. They do theirs thicker than some places and as such there's the risk that the batter won't be fully cooked. They informed us that they were cooking it a bit longer because it wasn't fully cooked but even after it was brought out there were some unevenly cooked parts. Still delicious though.

All in all hope I can come back and try other things! They have burgers and other more lunch ish items that looked appetizing!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect local spot to get breakfast and or a delicious lunch. The food is 99% of the time perfect. The staff ranges in age but everyone of them is nice and kind. Great place to take people you bring in from out of town. It's a laid back atmosphere. Best part you won't break the bank on food but maybe the button on your jeans."}
{"text":"Great food and great place for breakfast meal. Pancake is great!! Service is excellent too!"}
{"text":"Nice family-friendly environment for brunch; however, could be a bit too crowded on a weekend. The sauce for raspberry pancake was quite sweet and creamy to me, but could be totally delicious to others since I usually eat light."}
{"text":"I got to check out The Dor-Stop Restaurant on my first trip out to Pittsburg. My friends mentioned that this place was pretty popular and had been featured on Guy Fieri's \"Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives\" so there's typically a wait, but it's worth waiting. Upon walking in, the dining room is pretty small, which meant we had to wait outside. The decor looks like it was mostly untouched from the mid-80's, but that's the charm of an old school diner. The few recent additions to the decor include pictures and articles related to Guy Fieri's visit, it's pretty heavily publicized throughout the restaurant, including at least one dish on the menu featuring Guy's name in the title.

Diners are never the most attractive places, they succeed on their low prices, quick service and delicious food. The Dor-Stop Restaurant nailed all three of those factors perfectly. My breakfast was simple, I ordered a vegetable egg white omelette with home fries, wheat toast, and a side of spicy italian sausage. The food was delicious, though I received a regular omelette instead of an egg white omelette, but that's not the end of the world. I also got to taste the chocolate chip pancakes (they call them hotcakes) and some kind of strawberry french toast, both were absolutely amazing, definitely some of the best versions of those items that I've ever had."}

And for a much more eloquent description (one not done with a mouth full of food) Go back and read Isaac M's review."}
{"text":"I ate the Dor-Stop on Sunday, November 27th and my party included 7 people.  The staff was able to make a table for us in a timely fashion and the total ambience the restaurant was excellent. In addition the food, service and cost was outstanding.  Can't wait to return when I am back in town!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot about the For-Stop from our recently transplanted son, who is a big fan. The place didn't disappoint. Lots to choose from, decent prices - I'd come back just to try other stuff....."}
{"text":"Tonya our waitress was perfect! Her recommendations we all excellent! From Chicago attending a funeral. Checked triple-D, and glad I did! Oatmeal Raisin pancakes were unbelievable! I don't where they get their eggs but they were huge and fresh over easy for me! Must stop if ever in Pittsburgh!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were looking for a new place to try for brunch on Labor Day. Instead of going to our standby, the Original Pancake house, I suggested we try the Dor-Stop. We arrived at 12:30 and were soon joined by the 3rd person in our party. The hostess informed us that we were next on the list for a table and would be seated soon. I was surprised at how busy it was on a holiday. This small little diner was packed with people. Every table was full as well as every seat at the counter. About ten minutes later, a waitress came over and called two parties that arrived after us. My husband had to go talk to her and explain how we were waiting longer. She apologized for skipping us and was able to seat us right away. Once seated, I had a difficult time deciding what to order from the extensive menu. Wow! They have a huge selection. 

I finally decided on the special, Apple Harvest French toast with bacon. When I asked the waitress about the special, she had a difficult time describing it but I still wanted to give it a try. Once we ordered, it took well over 15 minutes for our food. I understand that they were very busy but that amount of time did seem a bit excessive for diner food. When my french toast arrived, it was not exactly what I was expecting per the description but, it was very tasty. The french toast had a nice crisp on it and the cream cheese sauce had a lot of flavor. However, for being APPLE harvest french toast, it was certainly lacking apples or apple flavoring. This french toast would have been perfect with slices of cooked apples on top instead of the small apple pieces that were mixed in with the cream cheese. The bacon also lacked a nice crispiness. 

I also had the opportunity to try my husband's banana chocolate chip pancakes. Although they looked delicious with the bananas and chocolate chips baked into the pancakes, they tasted rather salty. My husband agreed with my assessment. It seemed like the cook was a little heavy handed when adding salt to the batter. Overall, I wasn't overly impressed though, I would give the Dor Stop a second chance based on their huge selection to choose from."}
{"text":"I called on Memorial Day and said \"I was just checking if you're open today.\" \"No,\" she snapped, \"we're closed, ya jest woke me up!\" Well, with customer service like that, I knew this had to be a real diner.

And boy oh boy was I right. Hotcakes thick and soft as fresh cookies, something called \"jumbot\" (which seems to be Pittsburghese for \"whatever we scraped off the grill\", but boy is it good), and good luck finding the bottom of a cup of coffee, because they'll never let you get low enough to see it.

Maybe these aren't the hugest pancakes in town (that honor goes to the MANcakes at Eggs-R-Us in Crafton), but they sure are delicious. Well worth a few minutes' wait for a table."}
{"text":"I couldn't choose between pumpkin or banana pancakes so the genius waitress suggested pumpkin banana pancakes and she was right. Great service and really great breakfasts."}
{"text":"The Dor-Stop had perfectly fine diner food, but definitely not a frontrunner for breakfast food or diner food in the Pittsburgh area.

The diner was packed on a Saturday morning and we had about a 15 minute wait. The staff was great at expediting the process of greeting customers when they came in and getting them on the waitlist/calling names. The dining area is definitely cramped, but tables/booths were very clean.

Our table ordered cinnamon rolls, the jumbot eggs (basically a hash), eggs, bacon, sausage, and several different kinds of pancakes. None of the pancakes were great--they have a very dry and tough exterior and a soft center. The dryness/toughness of the cooked exterior, however, basically demands that you drown them in pancake syrup, but they're already pretty sweet to start with, so it just gets gross. The child at our table did not eat more than two forkfuls of the chocolate-chip pancakes.  The fruit-filled pancakes (apple and banana) had great flavor, but again, they pancake itself just wasn't good. The hash was very dry and didn't have much flavor, in spite of advertising itself as having both hot sausage and jalapenos. Eggs, bacon, and sausage were fine, but definitely nothing special.

The cinnamon roll was delicious--soft and tender even at the edges, gooey, and with strong cinnamon flavor.

The coffee was absolutely terrible, which, well, I mean. We're ok with that. Diner coffee is diner coffee. Always disappointed to see the little individual containers of half-and-half, though.

Our server was nice and efficient, but definitely not attentive (offered our only water refill while delivering the check for example). The place was very crowded, so she was definitely busy. 

It was fun to visit a new breakfast place and check this one off of our list, but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Best diner in town.  Everything from scratch.  I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't have their own chickens in the back yard - that is how fresh everything is! Great!"}
{"text":"Dor-Stop is the place to go in Pittsburgh if you want great breakfast. Having been featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, it has become a well known place to enjoy the mornings and afternoons of the weekend. Located on a quaint street in Dormont, Dor-Stop is always full to the brim with awaiting customers. 

I ordered a plate full of gooey chocolate pancakes with a side of sausage patties and lyonnaise potatoes. The pancakes were so, so delicious. They were thick and dense, but weren't too thick that they were difficult to eat. The sausage patties were cooked just right. They were juicy, and greasy, and simply amazing. The lyonnaise potatoes were a nice addition. They are my favorite type of potato. My boyfriend got Guy's version of the jumbot. It was loaded with hot sausage, potatoes, eggs and peppers. He loved it, and so did I! 

The atmosphere of Dor-Stop is that of a typical diner. Various memorabilia and other types of old-time posters adorn the walls, which makes for a very comfortable feel. The service was great for being so busy, and we only had to wait a short amount of time for our food. 

I definitely plan on coming back here as soon as possible to try the other great options on the menu. The raspberry stuffed French toast looked amazing!"}
{"text":"Here's another pile-on review- the Dor Stop was awesome."}
{"text":"Great food and diner atmosphere. Well worth the wait if you come in on the weekend. Everything is fresh and made from scratch. We will be becoming a regular at this place for sure"}
{"text":"I am always up for trying out one of those places featured on food network. The wait to get into this place was long and goes out the door. Its a very small restaurant with about 15 tables at best. Its one of the divey places where the staff clearly knows what they're doing and does it right. when we finally did sit and order service was fast. I had a meat omelet with hashbrowns. Im not much of a breakfast person so I wasnt overly impressed with it. Large portions though. I would come back here to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  I've been wanting to try this place for years and finally made it.  Ever since I saw it featured on the Food Network I've been wanting to go.

We went for breakfast and I ordered the stuffed raspberry french toast.  I ended up getting the cherry though...  I took a bite and while it was good I really wanted the raspberry.  I let them know and they quickly replaced my order with what I wanted and took it totally off the bill because they felt bad I had to wait longer for my food.  That was really unexpected and really nice!

Once I tried the raspberry stuffed french toast I loved it, really really good.  There are so many other things on the menu that I would love to try as well such as the banana chocolate chip pancakes, the breakfast burrito, ect.

I would certainly go back to this place and hope that I do the next time I am in the Pittsburgh area.  So so good."}
{"text":"I took a group of 7 people here for a lunch meeting and as usual, the service and the menu was spot on. I ordered my favorite item, the oatmeal pancakes, which are nutty, fluffy and have a hint of sweetness. Like other reviewers, I just love those pancakes so much I can't seem to order anything else! The bottomless and pretty good drip coffee is a perfect touch that fits in the diner ambiance. 

Others in the group ordered the veggie omelet, banana chocolate chip pancakes, eggs Benedict, the German potato pancakes, and a variety of other pancakes. The potato pancakes are delicious, with a hint of sweetness, touch of salt, and the requisite apple sauce/sour cream as an accent. I \"helped\" a friend eat these- they were very, very tasty. Good as those were, the regular pancakes are still the star of the meal. Everyone left full and satisfied, even on a very busy Friday at lunch. Challenging parking was a common gripe- make sure you bring change for the meters or else plan to walk quite a few blocks.

I'll be back, and you can bet I'm ordering the pancakes again!"}
{"text":"Thx Guy Fierri for putting the spotlight on this place- just as good as expected! Jumbot guy style - yumm!! Italian bread on the side- yumm.. Coffee- really good! Table had meat omelet and pumpkin French toast w bacon- all thumbs up!! And don't forget to go to the bakery down the way!!"}
{"text":"Had high expectations but was disappointed. The hot cakes were very dense, seemed like not fully cooked in the middle. Definitely not light and fluffy. The western omelette was ok. They mix everything in and cook it all in with the egg so the cheese was dried out, not melty like I prefer. Home fries were very good. Maybe we just got the wrong things off the menu."}
{"text":"Dor-Stop is your pretty stereotypical diner. From the food to the decor to the atmosphere it's diner all the way. Their breakfast is always good but nothing to write home about. 
My favorite are the pumpkin pancakes! So thick and full of flavor, some of the best I've had. Also the home fries are made fresh not frozen. You can really tell the difference. And the food portions are huge! 
If you go to Dor-Stop on the weekend it's really hard to get a seat without having to wait a while. 
I would definitely recommend trying Dor-Stop..they are quite popular around here with the locals."}
{"text":"What an amazing place. I loved the location and the ride to get there from downtown Pittsburgh was so pretty! So we walked in and were greeted right away and we were served just as fast and they were packed. We each got the famous chocolate chips hot cakes and we were both in love!! They were so moist, delicious and flavorful. I also got eggs and bacon and everything was top notch!

I can understand why this place has such great reviews because it was a homey place with delicious food so it deserves all the rage. I am so happy I got to visit while in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"I've only had breakfast here once, so hopefully my review can be updated in the future. 
I thought it was good, but I wasn't overwhelmed with culinary joy. The atmosphere is friendly and bustling. The menu seems nicely edited, and apparently they make lots of their ingredients from scratch. I had 2 eggs over medium, their in-house ham from the bone, Texas toast and potato pancakes which came with my choice of applesauce or sour cream (I got sour cream). The eggs were cooked perfectly, and the ham was nice-- just salty enough. The potato pancakes were different than what I expected. I thought they would be like fried hashbrown cakes, but they were shredded potatoes mixed with a pancake-like batter. They weren't crispy or hot, and just kind of underwhelming. I'll be back though since they have grits :)"}
{"text":"Had a great breakfast, price was not bad.  It was very busy and the service was good.  I would definitely go again. They offer the standard breakfast, plus a few things a little different than the eggs, bacon & biscuits.  I had the summer special eggs benedict over crab.  It was delicious!"}
{"text":"You guys! Go here! It's super yummy. It's totally a dive, everything is old and it's cramped but the food is delicious and the service is great. The raspberry French toast and apple cinnamon pancakes are probably the best we've ever had. Anytime we're back on Pittsburgh we'll be Dor-Stopping it!"}
{"text":"3.5 really.   This place has been on my to-do list for quite some time and I finally got a chance to give it a try.   We waited a while to get in the door, but it was nice enough outside, so I didn't mind.  Once inside, it definitely has an old diner feel.  The staff were friendly and attentive, though our order did get mixed up and came out in three separate chunks.  

As far as food, my banana chocolate chip pancakes were perhaps a little doughy, but I did enjoy them.   The highlight though was the potato pancake - tons of flavor and a nice texture.   Be forewarned though that it comes with very tiny little thimbles of sour cream and applesauce.  Definitely ask for extra if you are going to order that.  

All in all, it's a good version of a community diner.  The menu is pretty big and it is very popular.  I am not sure I'd wait regularly though."}
{"text":"A little biased since I live so close, but I love the Dor-Stop. Great, typical, greasy spoon diner. Always give the special a shot."}
{"text":"The Dor-Stop restaurant in Pittsburgh, PA brought breakfast to a new level for this Jersey boy. 

I ordered the \"Ham on the Bone\" breakfast which gives you three long strips of fresh ham, two eggs, well done breakfast potatoes, and some toasted Italian bread with butter.

The entire breakfast tasted farm fresh. The breakfast potatoes had a crispy outer skin that brought the whole plate together. 

What's wrong with it? Well, not much. I ordered my eggs over easy and they came a bit undercooked. Easily forgivable for a meal that filled me up until way passed lunch.

If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again, you know I'll be back, jack!"}
{"text":"Surely you've read enough reviews to know you HAVE to go to the Dor Stop. Have to. No matter where you are or how far of a drive it is, do it. Oh sure, you're a Pamela's fan or DeLuca's and swear there can't be anything better around. Oh, my friend, don't be deceived. I too am a fan of those places. Love them. BUT, get your butt to the Dor Stop!!! You will open a new frontier in breakfast possibilities that will have your taste buds shouting hallelujah!

Oh my! The banana chocolate chip pancakes are to die for. And the oatmeal raisin ones? You won't believe something that is that \"good\" for you tastes like that!! And the raspberry French toast? Amazing - but only if you can afford the calories! But do it at least once! And their egg scrambles with your choice of ingredients? This is breakfast nirvana. None better in the city. None."}
{"text":"We traveled to PA for a weekend and stopped at this restaurant. I had the hotcakes with scrambled eggs and the pancakes were so delicious and thick! Just how pancakes should be! Their sausages were really good too! Hubby had the pumpkin hotcakes and he really enjoyed them. I'd definitely come back again the next time we are in town! The only thing I would say needs improvement is the wait time of receiving your order. Other than that, score!!"}
{"text":"Crazy Busy!

I followed some of the fellow yelper reviews and ordered the Eggs Benedict.    My friend ordered the Meatloaf Sandwich.

All items were made from scratch.    My eggs benedict was very good.   The meal came with ham and layered over toast.   It was quite messy but I enjoyed it.

My friend enjoyed her Meatloaf Sandwich and Mash Potatoes.

Food - Very good - I cannot wait to go back and try some pancakes!
Service - Good - The waitress was crazy busy.   I did have a longer wait than desired (just be aware when you want your check).
Price - everything is between $5-10 on average per meal. 

I will be back.   (I recommned going around 2pm since they close at 3pm for easier seating)."}
{"text":"Featured on Triple D or not the inside of my pancakes were raw and that sucks. My husbands egg scramble was good though. I ended up guilting him into letting me eat some of his so I wasn't starving."}
{"text":"Used to love this place, but paid $15 for 2 eggs, bacon, coffee & hot tea... (no option anymore to do ala carte items) just seemed crazy to my wife and I. 
Looking for a new breakfast joint in Dormont"}
{"text":"Go here for breakfast / brunch. Pretty good diner food: eggs, pancakes, etc. Nothing super special, I wasn't amazed by their famous pancakes. But everything was still great and worth the price.

Worth a stop to try, for sure."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for brunch this morning. We aren't usually in the area but had heard great things. 

We were able to get seated right away. The inside was cute - my husband and I love diners. There were lots of cool old photos and interesting things to look at. 

Their menu is pretty typical for a diner. I ordered the veggie breakfast burrito and my husband ordered a club sandwich (it was technically \"lunch\" time). 

Both our portions were huge. My burrito was awesome. The potatoes inside were very good. It also had a really good red sauce on top (some sort of salsa maybe). 

The service was also very good, and you can't beat the prices. I can't wait to come back to try other options on the menu."}
{"text":"The chocolate chip banana pancakes are to DIE for. Plus the environment is fun and kinda retro. Other people in my party had the veggie burrito, and the oatmeal banana pancakes. Everyone was satisfied. Our wait was only about 7 minutes, but I understand sometimes it can be a bit long. So give yourself some extra time to wait, but it's well worth it. If you're in Pittsburgh be sure to stop by."}
{"text":"It's been almost 3 years since I moved to Dormont but this was my only first visit to Dor Stop. I've heard about this place even before I moved here and I was pretty sure we'd be coming here at least few times a month. But nevertheless, I could never bring myself to stop by especially when the line to get in usually starts a block away from the restaurant. 

However, this past Sunday was a different story - perhaps because we came in later than the normal breakfast hour. There wasn't much of a line and the wait wasn't too long either. Although the place itself was pretty full.

The servers were friendly and attentive in handling our group of 6. The coffee along with the refill came in time - so did our food. I got the All American Breakfast with a beef patty, rye toast, 2 eggs and the Lyonaise potatoes with onions. Loved every bit of it. My S.O. got the spicy omelete which was needless to say quite \"spicy\" which came with a toast and potatoes (without onions). I was a bit confused since the menu said that it came with fries which I assumed was french fries. Regardless, it was delicious and quite filling.

The price is reasonable and the portion is just about right."}
{"text":"I hate to be the one to say it, but this place is super over-hyped.

First, despite having an open kitchen, the restaurant was freezing last weekend.  Sure, it was only ten degrees out.  But everyone in the restaurant was wearing their jackets, which is uncomfortable when you are trying to eat.  Second, the service was pretty bad.  Our waitress never came over to refill coffee or check on the meal.  She took our orders and dropped the food off with an attitude.  That was it.

So how was the food?  Despite being featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, which they point out on the menu, the food was just standard diner food.  I split the Egg Burrito ($8.59) and the Apple Cinnamon Hot Cakes ($6.59).  The hot cakes were the very large winner with a  unique and dense batter.  I enjoyed the apples throughout the batter very much.  The egg burrito, unfortunately, was really lackluster.  It was a flour tortilla filled with sausage, potatoes, scrambled eggs, and cheddar cheese and then smothered in salsa.  While it looked good in appearance, it was mostly a bunch of potatoes.  I saw one piece of sausage in the whole thing.  It lacked any flavor and would have really benefited from some hot sauce.

I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, and if I was back in the neighborhood, I would rather Tom's Diner across the street.  The Dor-Stop is A-OK but nothing special."}
{"text":"Went this this morning and I am wondering why the hell it tool me so long to go here. Awesome food, fresh and the staff was even better. Won't eat anywhere else for breakfast in the burg! Gotta get here"}
{"text":"Best best best! The pancakes are good thick American pancakes. Not crepe like ones you'll get elsewhere. My sister loves the raspberry French toast. Beware of the church rush on Sunday mornings. You'll be waiting a while; it's a small place and not a lot of counter space. For a weekday breakfast stop it cannot be beat! Seating is close together so large parties are hard here but they will gladly accommodate you, you'll just end up with a long weekend wait."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic! My boyfriend took me for breakfast and OH MY GOD! He had the Guy Fieri version of the Italian Jumbot and I had the Apple Cinnamon pancakes. Neither of us have ever eaten such a delicious breakfast! Go hungry but make sure you bring everyone with you when you put your name in."}
{"text":"This is one of our go to stops for breakfast. Never had a bad meal. One of my favorites are the banana chocolate chip pancakes. Yum!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome for breakfast.  It was featured on an episode of Diners, Drive In's, and Dives with Guy Fiery.  Located on the the outskirts of Pittsburgh, no major issues with traffic in this area.  The restaurant setting as a whole is nothing really special, typical diner setup, tables pretty tight, and a few spots to sit at bar seating up by the cash register.  Service is about average, expect to wait a little bit due to the restaurants popularity.  We waited about 25-30 minutes for a table, but considering we got there 10:00am on the Sunday following St Patrick's Day, felt this was not bad.  It did seem to get a lot busier around 10:30-11:00 though.

The food was really great.  My daughter got the chocolate chip pancakes.  If you are into light and fluffy, these might not be up your alley, they are extremely dense, and I thought that they were crazy good.  Whatever my daughter couldn't eat, I was glad to finish for her, just really different and really good!  I had a the Spicy Omelette which had pepper jack cheese, onions, peppers and sausage and was really delicious.  Home fries were also good.  Also got a side order of the potato pancakes, and weren't bad.  My son had the raspberry French toast which are served with a raspberry cream cheese and raspberry drizzle and very good as well.  This seemed to be one of there more popular specialties.  My wife and one of the daily specials which was an Irish Hash, which she also liked.

Overall very good, and next time we are in the Pittsburgh area will make it a point to come back!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, my french toast was great and bacon was crisp and delicious!  My wife's pancakes with bananas and chocolate chips was 'the best she's ever had'!  I was disappointed with the service, the waitress wasn't attentive and rushed our order and  when i paid she barely acknowledged me.    the dinning experience was also rather cramped, I kept getting my elbows bumped lol
Great food but rushed, apathetic service."}
{"text":"This place is so good, just smelling its food gave Guy Fieri a hernia. Seriously though, Dor-Stop was featured on Food Network's \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.\" Don't quote me for certain on the hernia part, it was probably just a food-boner. 

Anyways, The Dor-Stop Restaurant is a quaint, classic breakfast and lunch diner. Positive reviews cover the walls, and local businesses advertise on the restaurant's tables and placemats. It is clear how important the restaurant is to the community. While waits can be long, the surrounding streets and stores are very nice to walk through and pass the time.
 
Being a New Jersey (the diner state) native, I'm very critical of my diner experiences. To date, the chocolate chip banana hotcakes may be the best pancakes/hotcakes I've ever had. Not to mention the bacon is deliciously thick and crispy. This is one of the best breakfasts in Pittsburgh. The cheesesteak omelet is phenomenal as well."}
{"text":"Breakfast here is to die for. I always get the West coast egg Benedict, it's my absolute favorite. The French toast is what they're known for and it's also a must try when you go here. Very friendly staff and the food always comes out very fast no matter how packed it is."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast place I have found so far in the Mt. Lebanon area!  There's a wait so be prepared!  The wait is worth it though.  I had the crab Benedict and it was fantastic!  My family ordered the Irish Benedict (probably my favorite) and the banana chocolate chip hot cakes.  We all left happy and full!  Service was friendly and timely too."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is awesome! You get to choose what type of pancakes you want, so I chose banana chocolate chip and they were delicious and huge. You get three pancakes and I had to take two home to finish later. My friend got the stuffed French toast with bacon and again, delicious.

The food came fast but the waitress wasn't all that attentive. She was pleasant enough but we received no coffee or water refills. That's pretty much the only complaint. If you're in the area, definitely stop and check this out."}
{"text":"This place is just fantastic. I had the eggs benedict, which were absolutely delicious. It was likely the best eggs benedict I have ever had. We were a group of 7, so I got to taste a bunch of other dishes, including the raspberry French toast and the guy's jumbot, both of which were stunning! 

I'm definitely coming back here."}
{"text":"Every. Single. Time.  Every single time I've ever been in the Dor-Stop, I have been nothing but impressed.  On my most recent visit, I ordered the Guy's Version Jumbot, and my friend ordered The eggs benedict.  

I received an absolutely ridiculous amount of food, which was the best breakfast scambler-esque item I've ever eaten, and my friend was met with a bit of an unconvential eggs benedict, served on a large piece of italian toast, with basted eggs, instead of the traditional poached.

The service was standard for a restaurant like this, the server had large sections (two servers splitting the entire floor.)  but they were surprisingly on top of us, and when your bill is roughly 15 dollars for two people, how can you lose?"}
{"text":"Best pancakes I've ever had. Literally they're amazing, super good. However, they only take cash. No cards. So just come prepared"}
{"text":"The best diner around period.  Breakfast is amazing, lunch is great.  If you go on a weekend don't let the line around the block scare you.  Seriously, worth the wait and it didn't take that long."}
{"text":"LOVED this place! It seemed pretty busy late morning on a Saturday, but it seemed like we just beat the rush, we sat down right away. The service was great and the food came out fast. I wanted the egg burrito, but I felt like I should try the pancakes too! So I got the burrito, and the pancakes to share with my husband. The burrito was fantastic! The pancakes were so thick and had a cakey consistency. They were very filling. This place has been on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, my husband got the same dish that Guy had and he liked it very much. We left stuffed and happy, and for a very good price. If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again, I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We love this place!! My daughter and I stop her every now and again and they have an AMAZING breakfast spread. We both got our usuals today...kids chocolate chip pancakes and bacon for her and the egg breakfast for me. The most perfectly done eggs EVER with tasty sausage patties, rye toast and to die for homefries. My daughters pancakes tasted like heavenly chocolate  chip cookies, yummo!! The staff here is SO friendly!! They make you feel very at home!! I would definitely recommend stopping for a bite :)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what I can say about the Dor-Stop that hasn't already been said. Simply put, for my money, this is the best breakfast spot in Pittsburgh. This place oozes consistency. For the numerous times that I've been here, the fact that I've NEVER had a bad experience is somewhat of an anomaly. I've had breakfast all across the city, and the Dor-Stop is the only place worth crossing a river or driving through a tunnel to dine at. I wouldn't recommend coming here on the weekends unless you don't mind waiting 20-45 minutes for a seat, but if you're dead set on some top notch breakfast, it's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"I visited the Dor Stop for brunch this past Sat. with CM.  Given that we were headed out to South Park for a hike, and we wanted to get brunch beforehand, I suggested we take the opportunity to try the Dor Stop, since Dormont was on the way and I'd heard great things about their brunch (not to mention that they were on DDD!).  In hopes of beating the late-rising rush, we arrived at around 10:30, and it worked out perfectly, since we only had to wait about 15 min. to be seated.

Once we were seated, we were promptly greeted and given menus by one of the waitstaff.  Having checked out the reviews ahead of time, I knew I wanted to try the raspberry French toast.  I mentioned the other items that had been featured on DDD--and that people enjoy, based on the reviews--to CM, and he decided to go with the famous pumpkin pancakes (yeah, that's what I call them, rather than hot cakes--so sue me!).  Our order was taken promptly, and was delivered to our table about 10 min. after ordering.  My French toast looked exactly like I expected, based on the pictures--it consisted of four toast points covered with raspberry sauce, and drizzled with raspberry jam.  The toast was perfectly crispy, and the sauce was delicious and flavorful--it was everything I could want in a sweet brunch item!  However, I did find the name of this dish a bit misleading, since the toast itself wasn't actually stuffed, unlike other versions I've tried before.

I tried a bite of CM's pumpkin pancakes, and they were also delectable--unlike most pancakes I've had, they were quite moist even without any syrup, and definitely included real pumpkin, rather than just pumpkin pie spice, like many pumpkin items I've tried.  The butter added some welcome savoriness to the sweetness of the pancakes, and a bit of syrup added some additional moistness.  Since both of our dishes came with a breakfast meat, we ordered bacon (duh!), which provided us with a supply of umami flavor when we wanted a break from the sweetness of our entrees.

Overall, CM and I were very pleased with our experience at the Dor Stop.  Our total check, which included a glass of milk for me in addition to our entrees, came to around $20, which we felt was quite reasonable in light of the quality of the dishes.  Service was friendly and efficient, and the ambiance was cheerful and light-filled--exactly what I'd expect in a diner.  Even though we both felt a tad out of place among the clientele, which was almost completely white families with young children (very different than your typical East End eating establishment, which is what we're both accustomed to), we felt welcome.  Without a doubt, the Dor-Stop offers one of the best breakfasts in PGH, and doesn't disappoint for down home diner goodness!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, the breakfast was amazing, me and my wife go to different restaurants in Pittsburgh, to try out different food or just to see what the place is like, and this morning on 11/30/16 we were up for some breakfast. The two dishes me and my wife had were Guys Version and The eggs combo with two regular pancakes.(picture also uploaded11/30/16) The Guys Version dish is very filling, its spicy but not overwhelming spicy, My wife's meal the Egg Combo was Perfect as well, the pancakes are to die for. The service was also pleasant and friendly, go visit, if this review helps please like it. Thank you and hope you go and enjoy your meal."}
{"text":"My dad owned the Chinese restaurant right next door to them before they moved across the street. Definitely comfort dinner food. The staff is great. The food is always delicious! Everything is homemade and scrupulous!! I leave in a food coma each time"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE SERVICE BY THE SHORT OLDER WOMAN (40-50) WITH RED HAIR WAITRESS!!! 

This was my second visit to the restaurant. My first time I had an enjoyable experience however on this visit if I could've rated zero I would have instead of the one star. 

When my mother and I went into the restaurant we were not acknowledged  and had to ask to be seated. Then we were then signaled to take our seats in a booth. 

The waitress avoided all eye contact with us while we placed our orders. She had another waitress deliver our food which took an hour.  The waitress neglected to check up on us or ask if we would like a refill on our drinks. When she did finally come over was to simply give us the check, which was not asked for at that time and then she walked away. 

We paid our check and even provided the waitress with a tip which she took from my hand and walked away without a thank you. 

The waitress was pleasant with everyone else just didn't know why my mother and I received such horrible service."}
{"text":"Found the place to be average at best. Pancakes were not very good. They tasted like they were made from a mix, mushy in the middle, and they came with powdered sugar which I don't like (wish the server told me beforehand). Average wait time to be seated and for food to arrive. OJ was pretty bad as well- like the cheap stuff you get from the grocery store. I like the fact the place is not a chain, and I'd be up for trying other food there, but from my experience the pancakes do not live up to the hype."}
{"text":"Dor Stop is a good coffee shop in Dormont but be forwarded if you try getting in on a Sunday.  To start street parking is a bear, then you need to make sure everyone in your party is present before the put you on the list and it's tight quarters.  

Once seated, the food is very good and the shop has been featured on Guy's DDD. 

Overall, it's a pretty decent coffee shop in a cool neighborhood of Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"A favorite brunch spot. There's always a wait but please don't let that scare you away because it's absolutely worth it. They have great options whether you're looking for something sweet or savory, although honestly I usually end up with something of each. The prices are more than reasonable, so my over-ordering is easy to justify!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Pennsylvania, visiting from CA and I can't recall a breakfast spot back home that tops it. The omelette was phenomenal and the pancakes were fully loaded and amazing, Italian toast was excellent as were the potatoes. Great food and great service!"}
{"text":"The Dor-Stop restaurant has got to be my favorite brunch spot in the city. We came here over a weekend right after Christmas, and expected a fairly long wait, but we were seated in just about 15 minutes.

My partner and I really wanted to get both the rasberry french toast and the guy version's jumbot, so we decided to share our portions in half. Since we don't eat meat, the waitress offered to replace the meat on the side with potatoes. My oh my, the rasberry french toast was out of the world! The jam was so delicious and tasty, and the toasts were made to perfection. The jumbot was very good too, with the eggs perfectly done and had a perfect blend of potatoes, peppers, jalapenos and more. We even liked their brewed coffee a lot. 

The service was very warm and attentive, and not displeasing like some other \"famous\" brunch spots around the city. I am already planning my next brunch here."}
{"text":"Been wanting to come here for a while now! Came towards the end of Brunch so getting in only took about 10 minutes for a table. Food is fresh and quick! Service is attentive and thank for understanding my gluten free issues! 

Will be back again to see what else I can gluten free. Of course the boyfriend can eat anything so good for the guy(s) in your life!

Also they have an early bird special during the week. And open at 6am! 

Definitely another good diner that is needed!"}
{"text":"Decided to go today and it was the best decision of the day!   Hadn't been in years but will definitely not be that long before we visit again.    It's truly a hometown feel with super friendly wait staff and very clean.    I had the philly steak omelette with the potatoes.   The omelette was perfect!!!!!!   Hubs had the potato pancake breakfast and added sausage and bacon.   The pancakes were totally delicious and the sausage was so good!    If you're looking for a scrumptious brunch place , this is the one!!!!!"}
{"text":"I don't know if we caught this place on a bad morning, or what, but after years on my \"must visit\" list of pancake obsessions I managed to get in for a stack of what are supposed to be fantastic hot cakes. What we got were heavy, strangely orange-colored (in honor of the new president), heavily dense to the point of chewy and oversweet strangeness. I've never had anything like them, and hesitate to criticize because I'm not sure this is not the way they are supposed to be. Or if the cook was just off. See the huge benefit of the doubt I'm giving here--if I'd stopped in off the street I would have savaged the quality of the food, but this place is supposed to be legendary. I don't get it. It took me 4 cups of coffee and two glasses of water before I finally gave in, and I have NEVER left even a bite of pancake on a plate before in all 50 of my years. Now, the more time passes the worse those pancakes get in my memory. Too bad.

All that said, the morning waitress was charming, attentive, and very easy on the eyes, the shop was fastidiously clean, and the coffee was strong and tasty. The sausage was delicious, the bacon average. Normally I'd write a place like this off, but the service was so great, the other reviews so good and, frankly, the pictures of the sandwiches and other items so good looking that I'll probably give it another go."}
{"text":"Well I've finally had a chance to visit the now famous Dor-Stop.  I went on a weekday morning so that I could actually get a seat and have the food at it's prime--not cooked in a hurry to see how the food really was.  Well, that was also the only time I had, as well.

I was greeted quickly and seated and given a nice cup of coffee.  They did an exceptional job of keeping the coffee mugs full (another reason  to go on a weekday) and it was good coffee.  

I had to try the hot cakes, but didn't want to OD on carbohydrates so I got the Egg Combo with the speciality hotcakes.  The waitress recommended the banana oatmeal or the apple cinnamon.  I went with the banana oatmeal.  Two over easy eggs and bacon, though they offer sausage patties or links in both regular (sage) and hot.

My food came quickly and I was disappointed to find the eggs sharing the plate with the hotcakes.  I like my food separated and dippy eggs leave a residue that sometimes can't be mopped up with bacon.  I guess I would have preferred a plate with the eggs/bacon and a plate with the hotcakes.  

The eggs were cooked perfectly as was the bacon.  Crispy yet chewy.  I have to eat my eggs and bacon before I can eat my hotcakes, because, again, I don't like my food touching--especially something sweet and savory.  

Let's talk about the hotcakes.  They were served with a big dollop of whipped butter which I loved.  Whipped butter spreads pretty easy.  I like that.  I'm picky.  Especially with breakfast.  There were slices of banana cooked in which I also liked.  They tasted like a diabetics worst/best nightmare.  They were sweet and fork tender like a nice pancake should be.  They would have been fine without syrup.  When I added syrup it felt like I was eating a slightly sweeter version of banana bread.  I wanted to stop at one.  I really did.  I really really did.  I was getting full.  I can stop eating food that isn't good without much of a problem.  I had a problem with that second hotcake

My other \"complaint\" is that is is rather expensive for a small diner.  I paid a little over $10 for my breakfast.  For $10, I would have preferred a more generous portion of bacon, at least.  My idea of pricing is a bit off, I guess, mainly because I live in an area outside of Pittsburgh that is a lot less expensive.  

So, I will go back, for sure.  The breakfast is GOOD and I think most places that attempt to serve breakfast should be GOOD."}
{"text":"My first time here way today! I absolutely loved the place! The staff was nice and down to earth. The food coming out of the kitchen looked phenomenal no matter what the was! I ended up getting the eggs Benedict  which was some of the best I ever had! It came on a big piece of Italian bread with some of the tastiest slow roasted ham covered with two eggs and luscious hollandaise sauce draped over. Plus it came with a side of home fries which were delicious as well! 

My friend then ordered a spin off of Eggs Benedict called the West Cost Benedict. It came with sliced turkey, spinach, and fresh chopped tomatoes. He thoroughly enjoyed it! 

Our food came out promptly too which I was surprised since everything is home made but I think we just caught the tail end of the lunch crowd. I highly reckoned this place and I will be eating there again!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best pancakes I've ever had. The staff is funny and great, and the food and coffee were nice and hot. Good place to get some good breakfast!"}
{"text":"Very good, fast friendly service. Just an FYI to other patrons. .. it is NOT ok and very rudw for you to  watch YouTube videos in the middle of a restaurant. I WISH someone other than myself would  have asked them to stop.  Also $30+ for breakfast is a bit steep, but I would come back since it was so tasty."}
{"text":"Ahhh Dor-Stop. A nice little brunch spot. I ordered the egg combo this time around. The eggs were average, and the bacon was pretty skimpy, but the pancakes. Ohhhhhhh the pancakes! If it wasn't for these scrumptious staples of breakfast I would never know why it was worth waiting 30 minutes for a table. I ordered the pumpkin pancakes. These this are filling! I could only eat 1 1/2 before being stuffed like the Thanksgiving turkey. Mmmm stuff a turkey with pumpkin pancake .............. anyway. I usually need syrup to add flavor to this sweet treat, but I didn't need any here! I also tried Darren's chocolate chip pancakes. The had so many semisweet chips in them I thought they were stuffed pancakes at first! Soooooo good but even one round cake would make me feel a bit sick from sugar overload. The staff seems able to keep up with the tidal wave of a crowd and get everyone in and out rather quickly. I like that! If you're looking for a place to relax and take your time, this ain't it. if you want some quality pancakes or French toast (poor man's egg sandwich as the Britts call it) and a show watching the cooks do their thang, come here and and be amazed!"}
{"text":"I was excited to check this restaurant because of the reviews and my love for carbs. I also saw that it was on Triple D, though usually those pursuits end up being disappointing. 

My friend and I split the Raspberry-stuffed French Toast and the Spinach, Tomato and Feta Omelette. We got sides of Bacon, Home Fries and Toast. I thought the Omelette was great- ingredients were fresh, and it wasn't as greasy as I thought it would be. The Home Fries were my favorite since they were more like smashed potatoes, and it was different from your typical diner home fry. The Raspberry-stuffed French Toast was a disappointment. It wasn't stuffed at all- it was thickly breaded (maybe crushed corn flakes?) and drenched in raspberry sauce. The dish overall was OK, but not worth the hike from home. My friend also got the tomato juice- couldn't really tell if it was freshly juiced or not.

Though I am curious about their pancakes, this visit wasn't worth it for me to make the 20-25 minute drive out here. The service was fast and efficient, not particularly friendly, which is fine with me. The meal was very affordable."}
{"text":"Best. Banana Chocolate Chip Pancakes. Ever.

EVER!

I cannot recall any other pancakes I have ever eaten that were as good as the ones I had yesterday at the Dor-Stop.  They were very banana bread like in taste, yet were a little crispy on the edges and really the perfect density and thickness.  No syrup or butter needed, these are fantastic.  I wish I lived closer so I could hit this place up for Saturday or Sunday breakfast rather than the occasional breakfast-for-lunch at work.

I wish I had those pancakes now."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. Great breakfast place for decent prices. Portions were huge. Got the eggs benedict and banana chocolate chip pancakes. Pancakes were a little too sweet and was sickening after a while but benedict was delicious. The ham was extremely large and juicy. The eggs perfect sunny side up (I love it when you stab the yolk and it runs all over the food). I liked that they used some kind of toast instead of regular English muffins. The hollandaise sauce was rich and buttery, maybe a little bit too rich."}
{"text":"The place was crowded and the service wasn't superb, but the food was absolutely delicious. More than made up for it!"}
{"text":"Now I understand why food network made a pit stop here! Awesome breakfast - I highly recommend their pumpkin chocolate chip pancakes and German potato pancakes. It can be a wait but quite worth it!"}
{"text":"The Dor Stop is exactly why I love Pittsburgh and it's precious collection of hidden gem diners and eateries. The Dor Stop is just that...tucked away on Potomac in Dormont (duh) serving the most magical plates of breakfast and lunch you can imagine. Each dish is fresh and homemade so I promise you won't be disappointed. Heck, I don't even like pancakes and French toast but I'll happily order either because I know it'll be fabulous. Today I had the West Coast eggs Benedict and just wow. The combo of turkey, spinach, tomatoes and the Benedict sauce with a running egg was just amazing. Their potatoes are perfectly cooked; soft but a little crispy as well. Make sure you add this place to your breakfast rotation, stat!"}
{"text":"When visiting my former hometown, I usually hit all the  Pittsburgh traditional food spots. Dor-Stop, is now added to that list, as I REALLY enjoyed my breakfast there, even though we never really went there as kids. Street parking was readily available. Very friendly staff greeted us upon walking in and sat us at a clean table right away. I'm sure had this been a weekend we would have been waiting. The coffee bar up front is a nice option for diners/caffeine seekers on the go. The food is to die for. I had French toast with bacon and potato pancakes, all of which were top notch. The potato pancakes were better than any diner in NJ I've been to, and that's saying alot. The French toast was dipped in cinnamon sugar before cooking which gave it an extra sweet crisp crunch. My wife really enjoyed the scrambled eggs and home fries. My coffee was never empty, and for under 30 bucks we had one of the best meals of our trip so far. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Shut The Front Dor-Stop what you're doing, and try this diner!!! Guy Fieri got it right on this one, it's a Total GEM! We got Guy's version of the Italian Jumbot and the Apple Cinnamon Oatmeal pancakes and we wouldn't have changed anything about our servers, the food, the atmosphere. We loved it from the moment we stepped in to when we left. We got there around 1:30 and got a table immediately. Moments later it went to a 15 minute wait. If there was free parking we didn't find it."}
{"text":"My in-laws saw the Dor-Stop on DDD and wanted to try it out. When I found out they were famous for their pancakes, I hopped right on board. We went on a Sunday morning and was told the wait would be 20 minutes. After about 10, four seats opened up at the counter so we snagged them. We got to know the staff as we perused the menu. We were right next to the cash register and the (I'm assuming) owner was a gentle drill sergeant doling out orders. 

I had the banana chocolate chip pancakes with a side of sausage. The three generously-sized pancakes were sweet with a crispy edge and were loaded with fruit and chocolate. Ohmygod. Some of the best pancakes I've ever had. I stuffed myself silly knowing I wouldn't be able to come back next weekend and do it all again. The sausage patties were really tasty and not greasy at all. I had to fend off T who kept getting samples. :) I also tried T's apple cinnamon pancakes which had dollops of apple pie filling and just the right amount of cinnamon. My father-in-law had the strawberry-stuffed French toast and my mother-in-law had the walnut French toast. I didn't try either but they looked amazing. 

I would DEFINITELY come back here if I lived in the area. Pay no mind to the wait time. Bring a book, bring someone you love to chat with. It's worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot in the heart of Dormont. Guy Fieri has visited here, and even made his own dish \"Guys Jumbot\". That is what I opted for during my visit. It was excellent! They have a killer list of creative pancakes that I have not seen anywhere else! This place fills up quick on weekends; but definitely worth the visit"}
{"text":"I return to Dor-Stop again and again.

The service is attentive but brief as it should be for a diner.  Also, the humor and casual nature of the dialogue with the staff is refreshing.

I enjoy the burgers most at Dor-Stop, and it is what I will come back for again.  The perfect doneness, the juicy result of good quality meat, and the rye bread that I get it on all make it great.  I am not overly impressed with the breakfast although my parents do like the simplicty of the omlets and pancakes here.

The price is right, the service is great, and the food is wonderful."}
{"text":"40 minute wait was worth it. Expect to wait on the weekends. The much hyped raspberry French toast was incredible! Pumpkin pancakes also noteworthy. Great prices and service."}
{"text":"Ladies and Gentleman, welcome to pancake heaven. It was several years ago that I first came upon The Dor-Stop, and since then my breakfast lifestyle has been forever changed.

I know this will sound like blasphemy coming from a Dor-Stop convert, but I hate pancakes. I just don't understand them, they are odd and moist, and nowhere near as delicious as waffles. I came into The Dor-Stop the first time with this mindset, and am now forever changed. 

The Dor-Stop's hotcakes are delicious and almost cake-like. They aren't thin crepes, or undercooked globs of batter, but instead sweet, fluffy treats that come in a plethora of flavors. I personally endorse oatmeal walnut, but others love the banana or pumpkin (when in season). I recommend ordering the \"Egg Combo\": 2 hot cakes, eggs, and bacon/sausage. Go all out, you deserve it. 

On a recent visit, I also discovered the french toast menu, which has caused me to forsake my hot cake habit. The french toast is almost deep fried and covered in this raspberry yogurt. It is a can't miss item on the menu, rivaling that of the hot cake. When pumpkin french toast is a special on the menu, I suggest you run to The Dor-Stop and taste a little of heaven. 

I've also sampled various items from the lunch menu with no complaints. The Rachel and Ruben are especially tasty if you feel like bypassing the breakfast menu. 

This place is truly heaven in Dor-Stop. Make sure you arrive early on a weekend morning to avoid the crowd! Or wake up at dawn on a weekday and partake (as I have been known to do from time to time!)"}
{"text":"For my group of friends, this is the ultimate post-5K run reward!

Here are the rules (they are my rules, but you should adopt them for Dor-Stop success):
1. Go only with 2-4 people (otherwise you are one of THOSE parties that will hold everything up and screw up the seating)
2. Be prepared to wait.  If you do not wait, consider yourself the luckiest person alive.
3. Order something savory (may I recommend the Breakfast Burrito or the Eggs Benedict?  Everything has a twist and a funny name, so you're going to spend some time actually reading the menu.  Get something special, don't just go with scrambled eggs and bacon - although I'm sure that's delicious too).
4. Order specialty pancakes \"for the table\" (to share).  We haven't been able to get away from the drawing power of the pumpkin pancakes yet.  They are so thick, yet so fluffy at the same time!

The surprising news: they take credit cards (it gives off a \"cash only\" vibe).

The opportunity area: syrup that does not come in an old-fashioned squeeze bottle!  It takes me about 15 minutes to get the disgusting amount of syrup I want atop my fluffy pancakes."}
{"text":"Located up Potomac from the hotel my girlfriend and I were staying at, and just past the train stop into downtown, Dor-Stop was an easy choice for breakfast when doing my pre-trip food research. Getting its name from the bedroom community it's located in, Dormont, it benefits from a charming mini-downtown area immediately around it, as well as lots of brick houses, although some have seenbetter days. 

Dor-Stop is diner chic through and through, serving the breakfast and lunch crowds only. Nic nacs and local sports teams' placards adorn the walls, as well as a proudly displayed signed poster from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives after that show's stop here. A mix of booths, tables and a few counter seats could cram several dozen people in.

You don't have to do any research about what's popular here, just take a look at a good chunk of the menu or what the person next to you is eating: the hotcakes. With a dozen options, there's a lot of choice and they're all tempting. I settled on the apple walnut hot cakes with sausage on the side. We didn't have to wait long but it felt like a while hungrily watching all the delicious looking food come out of the open kitchen or sitting in the window.

Once in front of me, I was staring at three thick hot cakes with apples chunks and walnuts cooked into them and topped with icing sugar, along with two sausage rounds. The hot cakes were utterly fantastic, with a pleasing denseness but with just enough air in them to keep them from being chewy, The apples were cooked perfectly, soft but not mushy, and along with the walnuts added some texture. I was initially disappointed that the sausage came in round form instead of links as they tend to be drier, but these were nicely browned and still juicy, albeit a bit too greasy. 

My girlfriend went for the lunch time food, getting the Chick 'O' Philly hoagie  which came with sliced chicken breast, sauteed mushrooms, onions and green peppers, tomato lettuce and Swiss cheese. It was a winning combination of ingredients and the thick bun made for a even heftier sandwich, and as a good sandwich should be it was greater than the sum of its parts. The fries it came with were a solid entry - lightly browned, thick cut but still nice and crispy. 

On a return trip, I went with the plain hot cakes and they were just as good as the apple walnut ones, a sign of great fundamentals when you're doing something as seemingly basic as a hot cake. Kudos. 

Service was friendly and attentive, with a ton of coffee top ups. You'll be challenged to get past half empty in your cup at any point in the meal.

Dor-Stop seemed like just a convenient spot to fuel up for a day of tourism but turned out to be a damned good spot with memories of its own: the best pancakes I've ever had."}
{"text":"Everything a breakfast place should be (if only it were bigger and/or less crowded). Their eggs benedict could feed a family. The service is friendly and fast. Everything is fresh and made to order."}
{"text":"Eggs Benedict and Raspberry French toast was outstanding.  Would definitely recommend.  Parking is not the greatest, but that's expected."}
{"text":"Very nice place.  Crowded.  People were waiting outside.  Service was great and I was impressed with the food."}
{"text":"After scouring the Internet for the best breakfast joint in Pittsburgh, I landed on Dor-Stop. Why is it that I always believe that if a place is featured on DDD, it must be incredible?

I ordered Guy's version of the breakfast jumbot, as I was in the mood for something on the spicy side. My waitress confirmed the order verbally. I received the regular jumbot instead, but didn't say anything because I was on a tight schedule with a plane to catch.

I was disappointed with the lack of flavor/seasoning in my meal. It consisted of scrambled eggs, ham, bell peppers, and some type of cheese (tasted artificial and powder-based). The eggs were wetter than I prefer when I order them scrambled. Maybe they added water? Several pieces of ham I ate were very gristly and inedible. I ate less than half of the meal and left. I wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"Huge portions, delicious food.

Came for brunch and found the location very homey serving up some truly delicious breakfast. We ordered a variety of items from hot cakes to french toast to omelettes.

The hot cakes are sooo fluffay! Each plate comes with 3 very good sized pancakes. Mom tried the banana coconut and I tries the oatmeal apple cinnamon. Mine were a tad on the sweet side, but mom's were just excellent! I really liked the addition of fresh fruits. You could see the apples and bananas cooked right in.

Dad had the french toast. It's 3 texas toasts cut in half. Pretty good, but also fairly standard fare. Lastly, Brother opted for the south of the border omelette. He said it was really good, but that the home fries weren't crispy enough. 

It was definitely more than enough food to hold us over until almost dinner time...but then again, we aren't really accustomed to eating plates this big in my hometown!"}
{"text":"Excellent banana walnut pancakes and waffles. Get there early to avoid a wait. Good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I stopped in here on Sunday for brunch with my wife and her family who was in from out of town.  We arrived around 10:30 A.M. and it was PACKED!  The half hour wait was very reasonable granted that the line to get a table was out the door and would stay this way for the next hour and a half that we were there.  It was easy to see why they are this popular;  The servers are quick and friendly and the food is reasonable and delicious!  

This old style diner reminds me of Pamela's and instead of focusing on excellent Crepes the Dor-Stop has found their niche with pancakes and home fries!  The pancakes are wonderfully light and fluffy.  I tried some of the banana chocolate chip ones and they were incredible! For myself I ordered the All America which included a tasty burger, scrambled eggs, and home fries.  Would highly recommend the pancakes, but next time I'm here I would like to try an omelet or jumbot.  

Be prepared to wait for a table here on weekends for brunch... but it's well worth the wait!  Don't be afraid to try the daily specials as I heard several people around me commenting on how excellent they were.  If you want to avoid going to the strip district for a wonderful brunch, this is the place to get it!  I wish the north hills of Pittsburgh had something as good as this around!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in Pittsburgh!  Yummy good food!  Worth a visit.  Always been able to find a spot to park. Prices are good and the service is great."}
{"text":"Pancakes are my absolute favorite and these are the best I've ever had. Anytime I'm back in Pittsburgh I HAVE to go here."}
{"text":"We used to live right around the corner from this delicious Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives spot, and I'm so sad to now live 30 minutes away. The pancakes are definitely the best item at this dive - the chocolate chip and pumpkin are to die for! Service is also pretty quick for a location that has such a cramped dining room and tiny kitchen space. Plan to wait a bit (maybe 30 minutes or so) for a table on Saturday mornings!"}
{"text":"Ok, so I know this place is somewhat of an institution now because of their Food Network exposure, but I'm going to have to go against the grain here and say that I did not enjoy my Dor-Stop experience.

We came here many months ago after hearing all of the hype. I'd never been to Dormont before and we were eager to check out this place and the neighborhood in general (side bar: Dormont is adorable! If it were a bit more convenient to where we work and like to play, I would totally live there). 

Anyhow, so we get there on a Saturday morning, and the place is packed. No biggie, most good breakfast spots usually have a wait on a weekend morning. I think we waited about 30 mins, which wasn't bad. We're seated, we order, everything is just peachy. Then things started to go sour.

It had been about 40 minutes since we were seated and we still hadn't received our food. Other diners who were seated after us had received their food and were finishing up. Our waitress hadn't stopped by our table in a long time. I had started to wonder if maybe our ticket was lost (ordinarily I wouldn't think anything of it, but the fact that people seated after us had gotten their food made me think something might have been wrong). Anyway, so the next time we see our waitress walk by, we flag her down and ask her if she knew when our food would be out. We asked politely. We weren't snarky, we weren't mean, we didn't roll our eyes or snap our fingers. It was a simple question, one that I think many would probably ask. And the waitress replied, \"Are you really hungry or just really impatient?\" No hint of a smile on her face. No twinkle in her eyes. It was clear that she wasn't joking (not that it would have been funny anyway). 

Hmm. Are we really hungry or really impatient? Well, neither...we just wanted to make sure our ticket hadn't gotten lost. We sat in stunned silence, unsure of how we should respond to such a flat-out rude remark. The waitress left, and finally brought our food out about 10 minutes later (and then we never saw her again except for when she dropped off the check). By that point, our appetites were pretty much gone, and we just wanted to leave. So we scarfed down our food and got the heck out of dodge.

I dunno. Maybe the waitress was having a bad day. Maybe she gets asked that question a lot (by actual impatient people) and is sick of hearing it. But we were very polite to her and didn't deserve to be treated like that. I don't care how good your food is (and for the record, the food was okay, but certainly not mind blowing for the all the hype), if you have lousy customer service, I can't support you. And it's a shame, because I really, really wanted to like this place (it looks like such a cute mom and pop place). With so many other great breakfast spots in the Burgh, I'd rather go somewhere that cares about giving their customers a good (or at least not a blatantly bad) experience."}
{"text":"We stopped by for brunch on a Friday at Dor-Stop Restaurant and were not disappointed!  They have brunches here every day, it seems, even on weekdays.  
Even on a weekday at 11am, expect to find this place quite crowded!  We waited about 15 minutes for our table.

Pittsburgh was our last pit stop (no pun intended) on our roadtrip to the Midwest in mid-October and we decided to eat at the best restaurant we could find for lunch.

I ordered the steak n cheese hoagie and loved it.  It came with thin slices of steak, swiss cheese, sautéed onions, green peppers, diced tomatoes, and shredded lettuce.  It was served with fries.  I really appreciated how much steak was in my sandwich - they sure were generous!  

They have a number of breakfast-type foods on the menu as well, if you're so inclined.  The French toast looked quite appetizing, and something I would definitely get if I visited again in the future.

Service was really friendly and homey at this restaurant too.

The only issue is the parking situation - it's pretty much a \"find-a-spot-if-you're-lucky\" street parking type place.  But if you are driving through Pittsburgh and you do find parking in the vicinity, definitely check Dor-Stop out!"}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I have heard that this place has great potato pancakes but I couldn't care less. Why? Because I eat the same thing every single time I eat there. I have no time to be bothered by some silly pancake when there is serious business, in the form of eggs benedict, that needs taken care of. The eggs benedict at The Dor-Stop is just the way I like it. I feel like so many breakfast spots serve benedicts of all sorts that are usually quite small, have very little hollandaise and are served with a salad. Maybe I am the odd one out in all of this but I cringe when I see a salad served with breakfast foods. I go out to breakfast to eat unhealthy, artery clogging deliciousness. If I wanted to concern myself with veggies I would stay at home and save my money and eat at home. Anyways, their eggs benedict consists of the diner's ham off the bone, two eggs, mancini's bread and a pool of delicious hollandaise. There is no stinginess when it comes to this meal. Everything is heavy handed. In addition to the huge eggs benedict, there is a beautiful mountain of potatoes that comes with it. Everything about this dish is how it should be. Total perfection.b"}
{"text":"Writing the review for this place is pretty cool! I've wanted to go here for a long time.  I'm from New York and visit Pittsburgh frequently because my gf current is here! I've seen this place featured on Diners Drive In's and Dives and love all the food places I've been to in Pitt! I've tried a majority of the Pittsburgh staples for breakfast but the Dor Stop by far is the best breakfast I've had in the Pitt! The Orders were Vickie's Jumbot and their famous pancakes (apple walnut) the Jumbot features a mix of eggs veggies home-fries ham topped with Italian toast! Was very good ! The pancakes were amazing filled with hot apples and crushed walnuts them to were amazing... The only thing I was upset about was that they wouldn't allow substitutions and were gonna try and charge me a ridiculous amount to sub turkey for ham at like $5.99, didn't think that was fair, other then that the service was great, people were friendly and it was very enjoyable to go here!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, friendly and timely service, reasonable prices, big portions. This is THE PLACE to eat breakfast! The pancakes were great but the Guy's Jumbot was phenomenal!"}
{"text":"If you ever need an explanation of what a bottomless cup of coffee truly signifies, check out the Dor-Stop.

In addition to that lesson, the you will experience the following:
-Hotcakes so good you don't need to add syrup (mine were oatmeal raisin, like eating the amazing hybrid of a cookie and pancake)
-Potato pancakes so good that you'll wish you had multiple orders
-Slabs of ham. So good.

Add in the great service, ease to find parking, and decent prices and this place is truly a gem. Don't let the wait scare you unless you have a large group - people flow out of there pretty quickly, and for 2 people on a Sunday we only had to wait 10 minutes (and they gave us free samples while we waited). And it is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Jammed on a Sunday morning but they were able to get our party of 10 in with just a 15 minute wait.   And Pumpkin pancakes awesome!!!  Not seasonal- all year around.   Nice place to bring a crowd or a cozy group."}
{"text":"We stopped here with on a rainy Saturday morning with great anticipation given the reviews and I agree with Lawrence W. and Krissy D. that I dont really get the hype.  The place is small and loud so there was a wait which was fine, but the wait staff was not particularly friendly and very distracted.  They were much more interested in turning tables. We had a variety of food and it was all just OK and none of it great.  Some of the portions were huge to their credit, but very average.  Even though its more \"corporate\", Pamela's was a much better diner experience than Dor-Stop.  I doubt I would wait again."}
{"text":"A breakfast favorite. Always good. Try the banana chocolate chip pancakes! Beware that it is small and you often sit elbow to elbow with folks at the next table. It's also very busy on the weekends. Totally worth it."}
{"text":"I stopped by for lunch and had the steak salad.  It was pretty yummy but the steak had too much fat on it. The reason why I am giving it only 4 stars is because my steak was not done the way I requested and our waitress had zero personality.  I recommend going here for breakfast and not for lunch."}
{"text":"The Dor-Stop is amazing. I recommend it to everyone who wants a good breakfast. They have the best pancakes I have ever had. You usually don't even need syrup. The service is good -- the servers are attentive and professional, but there's a mom-and-pop feel about it too. I travel from an hour away to visit about once a month or so. It's that worth it. Reasonably priced.

The only drawback is they don't have real maple syrup. (Only Cracker Barrel seems to in the US, but that's just the Canadian in me.)  There are usually pretty long lines waiting for tables; but miraculously the wait is so short -- even on holidays.

Other than that: favorite. breakfast. restaurant."}
{"text":"The Dor-Stop is a must visit while I am in Pittsburgh. I visited here again on my recent trip.  The food is still fantastic.  The omelette special is great and the potato pancakes are some of the best I have ever had.  It gets really busy on the weekends, so I suggest getting there earlier."}
{"text":"Food, awesome. Servers, friendly and attentive. Always a wait on the weekends, so make sure you are ready for that. However, the turn around is quite fast, so the wait is never very long."}
{"text":"Still craving their pancakes. It's been weeks. 

The price is decent for a diner, maybe a little pricier, but I'm pretty sure I'd name my first born after this place. The service is quick and friendly and you get seated pretty fast so no worries! 

I tried their sandwiches and they were pretty killer, but the pancakes. The pancakes. I dream about the doughy, melt to the top of your mouth, sugary meal.  It is food deserving of the gods. 

Then again, I'm partial to breakfast."}
{"text":"best breakfast in the burg. i got the raspberry french toast which lives up to its expectations, but could have used more egg. i also got the egg benedict which was really good and a nice portion. he chocolate milk is decent. the fresh squeezed lemonade was very good. 

negatives- 25 min wait (although it was sunday morning) and small tables/crowded"}
{"text":"I saw this restaurant on Diners Drive-ins and Dives and knew that when I was in Pittsburgh I just had to check it out. Let me tell you I was not disappointed it was exactly what I expected. I had the pumpkin spiced hot cakes which were truly one of a kind. Hands-down some of the best hot cakes I've ever had. If you're close to Pittsburgh this place is a must !!!!"}
{"text":"Without a doubt, this is my favorite place for heavy, hard-core, carb-loaded, mouthwatering pancakes. The pumpkin and banana walnut bring a smile to my face just thinking about them. If somehow pancakes aren't your thing, the jumbot and eggs Benedict are amazing. I don't know what they do to their ham, but it's worth just ordering it as a side. I'm too fixated on the breakfast items to branch out into their other menu items but I'm sure they are also amazing."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Pittsburgh. Every time I come here I'm never failed.  On my most recent adventure I took my Mom and Step dad, who were in for a visit.  There was a special on sausage biscuits with gravy. OH. MY. GOD.   It was so delicious, it was ALMOST was good as my grandma's.  I savored every bite, and my only issue was that there wasn't more.  :(
As always the restaurant was packed and loud. I love that about the Dor-Stop b/c it's so Pittsburgh.  Did I mention how much I love this place?!?!"}
{"text":"Boston has Cheers.  Dormont has the Dor-Stop.  

When I moved to Dormont a few years ago, I was told about this amazing breakfast place that was featured on the Food Networks show, \"Diners Drive-Ins, & Dives\".  I now know why this place is a Pittsburgh staple - Delicious food, Friendly service, and a Cozy atmosphere.

If you go on the weekend, you'll typically see a line.  Don't let it turn you away!  It usually moves quick and its worth the wait.  It's a small diner atmosphere, so i wouldn't recommend it for parties larger than 4.  Once you get inside, I assure you that you'll be hooked, too.

I've tried several things on their menu - The breakfast burrito - HUGE and delicious with eggs, potatoes, sausage... The pancakes - dense and hearty!  The French toast - who would have thought cornflakes applied to this would make it even yummier?  And my FAVORITE - Vicki's Jumpot - Everything you could ever want in a breakfast!  Eggs, potatoes, ham, cheese, peppers, onions... and though it comes with Italian toast, I swap it for some of the best marble rye in the area.  Incredibly filling, big portions but little prices and always tasty.

Yes, it's got to the point where the hostess knows my name when we enter - \"Ashley, party of 2?\"  That's me!  I look forward to any Sunday I get to dine at the Dor-Stop.  Sometimes you've gotta go where everybody knows your name..."}
{"text":"Pancakes, pancakes, pancakes.  Everybody told me I HAD to try and their pancakes.
Well, the short stack they served me were lousy pancakes."}
{"text":"WOW. When you read \"best pancakes ever\", believe it. 

My boyfriend and I were on our way from Milwaukee, WI to Easton, PA and figured we should find some good food along the way, and The Dor-Stop fit the bill - we'd be arriving near Pittsburgh at just the right time for breakfast. 

This place was bustling - we got there at about 8:30am on a Saturday, but we only had to wait a few minutes. 

Our waitress was sweet and courteous and she told us about the popular items on the menu because we'd told her it was our first time there. 

He and I both got the Eggs Combo - two eggs, choice of meat (bacon, sausage or ham off the bone). He got banana pancakes and bacon and I got pumpkin pancakes with the ham. 

The ham was wonderful - albeit a little salty (but all ham tastes salty to me), but by the time I finished my perfect over-medium eggs and one of my pancakes I was pretty full, so I wasn't able to finish the ham. That didn't stop me from sneaking a couple of bites of my boyfriend's banana pancakes though! 

If I ever find myself driving east again, I will be sure to take the detour out to the Dor-Stop. I will be dreaming about the pumpkin pancakes until I can manage to somehow make something half as good. 

Absolutely amazing! Best. Pancakes. Ever."}
{"text":"I just met up with a few friends here today. First timer!!! The meal was classic eggs toast bacon and hash browns... And it was fantastic! Diner coffee can always be hit or miss, but this was on point. The service was quite friendly and always there for a refill of a drink or to see if we needed anything at all. I enjoyed the cute small town diner atmosphere. It's definitely cozy, so if you're not a fan of being seated near others I would recommend somewhere else. But the coziness gives it a lot of wholesome character, and I will most definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I'd say something bad about the restaurant, if there was something bad to say. We are big fans of DDD; which led us to seek out the Dor-Stop. We were good with being told it would take 25/30 minutes to get a table for four. Ten minutes later we were being seated. The restaurant offers a large menu; everyone should be able to find something to their liking. Everyone ordered something different at our table. It came quickly, was hot and most importantly, tasty. I had the Crab Benedict. Real Crab folks! The Hollandaise sauce was prepared nicely and the fried potatoes were excellent. My wife had the stuffed strawberry French toast. She said it was great. Coffee refills were timely and the overall cost was pretty reasonable. If I lived in the area, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"I have been to The Dor-Stop numerous times and never been disappointed. They are known for their pancakes as featured on The Food Network's \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.\" 

I always get pancakes when I go and my favorites are banana walnut and pumpkin. These pancakes are thick and fluffy and so filling! I always end up taking at least one home. My husband has also tried their french toast which he highly recommends. 

They get busy during the peak breakfast/brunch hours so a wait is sometimes necessary but they move fast with service without rushing you and you get out quick.  It has your basic diner feel. It is clean and service has always been warm and friendly. Prices are very reasonable in my opinion as my husband and I both eat for under $20. 

I love the Dor-stop and highly recommend it to others!"}
{"text":"I assume lots of folks have seen this place featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins, Dives. This place is exactly as it is on the show, really tasty breakfast foods all made from scratch. Great family atmosphere with friendly staff.

I had the apple cinnamon hotcakes and the cheese steak hoagie sandwich. 

The hotcakes were just awesome. They came as a stack of three hotcakes with a lump of butter and a squeeze bottle of syrup.

The hoagie was just average, kind of small with lettuce tomato, green pepper seasoned with salad dressing and mayo. Kind of weird.

Coffee wasn't very tasty either, or rather seemed to be on the mild side.

Note their hours are 6a - 3p. Metered street parking and a metered public lot down the block."}
{"text":"Great food! They were able to accommodate a large group on a very busy Saturday morning with hardly any wait!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! Best breakfast I've ever had. I had the raspberry stuffed pancakes and bacon. The bacon was perfectly crisp and tasty - just a bit too salty. The French toast was absolutely incredible. They must dip the bread in some sort of crispy breading because it's delightfully crisp. There was raspberry sauce and raspberry drizzle and if it wouldn't have freaked out the other customers and my husband, I would have licked the plate. I HIGHLY recommend. It's small so you might have a short wait but it's worth it."}
{"text":"What an awesome spot for brunch. Though we don't live too far away the traffic was horrendous and all we could think about was some yummy food to shovel into our mouths. Even though the place was packed we were luckily seated right away and presented with menu eery person wants to see on a Saturday morning. we all ordered what we wanted and didn't have to wait too long! Best part is, everything is made from scratch and you can def tell. 

We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at a decent price and we will for sure be back."}
{"text":"Tasty! I hear it gets busy on weekends, but we went on a Monday and got seated and served very quickly. I very rarely can't finish my meal, but it was so much food. Omelet was great, I'll have to go back and try the pancakes. Coffee was perfect diner coffee."}
{"text":"After a lazy Saturday morning visiting my in-laws, we decided to stop here for brunch before catching a movie at the cinema up the road. First, good luck finding parking in the area! My finance and I parked about 5 minutes away which wasn't a huge deal, but not being from the area it was a massive headache. But thats the worst we dealt with.

The restaurant itself is pretty small but cozy. We had a party of 6 and they sat us right away. (It was around 1pm on a Saturday.) I ordered the vegetarian omelette and home fries and I can say it was one of the best omelettes I've had! Huge portions and everything tasted great! Fiancé opted for the meatloaf sandwich and he said it was also delicious. Father-in-law got their signature stuffed french toast which came with a generous serving of bacon and toast.

Loved the hometown feel of the place and it was a nice stop before we headed to the movie. You defiantly won't leave hungry here!"}
{"text":"Don't go for healthy, go for tasty comfort food. Great pancakes. Expect a long wait on weekends!"}
{"text":"All I can say \"bombass\" pancakes!  Minus a star for the stares! I forget sometimes where I am. Traditional old school greasy breakfast. Everything homemade!  The cook & our waitress was cool. I guess they started chatting with us b/c the regulars couldn't stop glaring.  I guess it' worth the 2 to 4 hr on the weekends. Luckily, I came in on a weekday. Maybe that's why all the stares?  I don't care. Just give me my pancakes, sausages & hash browns  that Guy raves about. Everyone who works there was really good & portions were fit for steel workers."}
{"text":"This place has a great reputation.  It probably makes it more popular than it otherwise should be.  I really tried to sample what they are known for as I do many places I visit for the first time.  Turns out they know what they are doing.  

This is your quintessential diner.  Friendly, sassy staff that make you feel like you are at home.   Wait for a table (because there will be a wait) or try to snag a seat at the counter either way you are getting big portions served to you quickly.  

I got the jumbot (basically an egg scramble with various meats and veg) with the hot sausage and a side of German potato pancakes.   The hot sausage made what would have been a relatively pedestrian dish quite good. I probably could have ate just a bowl of that. The second best thing I tried there was the potato pancake.  Really nice flavor and they give you the option of sour cream or applesauce as a condiment.  I tried both and the sour cream was the clear winner there.  I tried my wife's chocolate chip banana pancake and it was also quite good.  

Nice diner doing a good job serving the community.  The food is probably somewhere between 3.5 and 4 stars but because of the intangibles it gets rounded up."}
{"text":"This place takes the (pan!)cake for cozy morning breakfast.

Growing up in the South Hills, this is where you tried to go every Saturday morning.  Note I definitely said TRIED, as if you arrive after 11, you better be very patient.  This place is small and people love to relax and stay a while.  However, this is one of the few spots I will leave the house for before noon on the weekend.

You might have seen the spot on the Food Network.  If not, look it up.  The owner and her daughter are crazy endearing.  The focus here, of course, is on the pancakes.  This is the only place I know of that serves pumpkin pancakes year round, and it is for a reason.  These are dense and sweet, enough that even I don't syrup them.  A little whipped butter in a paper souffle cup and a dash of salt (hey, don't knock it 'til you try it), I can clear three or so in a few minutes.

They also have staple breakfast items, along with the jumbot. At least one of the guys in my party always goes for the ham on the bone/jumbot.  If you can fit this thing in your body, go for it.  The only other unique item to try would be the stuffed french toast.  Personally, between syrupy fruit filling (compote is too kind a word for this ice cream topping inside) and then topped with more fruit syrup, it tastes more like a heavy dessert for me, but I know those who swear by this as their weekend treat.

If you find yourself on the other side of the Liberty Tubes on an early morning, you need to go get pumpkin pancakes.  You can even call ahead for it to be ready for take out and avoid the mess of hungry Dormont-ers along the Potomac sidewalk, but then you'd miss making new friends with your slightly brash waitress and the infamous specials on the tiny chalkboard.  Either way, depending on your timing, this diner will hit the very top on your breakfast list."}
{"text":"WOW! I really don't know what else to say. Hands down, the best breakfast I've ever had from a restaurant.

We were looking for a good breakfast place on Saturday and I found this one on Yelp. The reviews were great and the pictures looked so good that we had to give it a try. Thank you yelpers for helping me find this gem!

I had the Jumbot \"Guy style\". It was so good I HAD to eat the whole thing. Which was no easy feat considering how big of a plate it was. A heaping plate of everything but the kitchen sink. Eggs, hash browns, pepper jack cheese, onions, peppers, hot sausage, and more! On top if that, my boyfriend and I had to try a specialty pancake as well. Luckily you can get just one. We had the apple cinnamon cake and it was absolutely heavenly. Crispy on the outside with a doughy, yet done, center. It melted in your mouth!

He had the regular breakfast with the potato pancakes which The Dor-stop is apparently known for. I didn't get a chance to try them since he demolished it in mere minutes. I'm assuming they were delicious. 

It was reasonably priced and very cute. We were fortunate enough to get a table right away but I've heard there can be a pretty long wait. Sometimes out the door which makes perfect sense after tasting this delicious food."}
{"text":"Dor-Stop Diner is a gem!  Make sure you come hungry.  The apple oatmeal pancakes were delicious and perfectly prepared.  My friend had the raspberry French toast.  Both were excellent choices.  The waitress was super nice and prices were very reasonable.  Great spot and a fun new find!  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood diner! The food is always consistently good, especially breakfast. Personally I recommend their pancakes, soo so delicious! It gets packed on the weekends, but the street is cute with some interesting shops so NBD."}
{"text":"I just love this place.  My grandma lives just a few minutes away, so it is has recently become one of our stops when we come visit her. 

The environment of the place is perfect: friendly, happy, and serving great food.  I even found the coffee here delicious.  

I got the special for the day, which was the Irish Jumbot.  My grandma explained to me this morning that jumbot, when referring to food, mean just a plate full of different kinds of things.  That is exactly what it was.  The reason this was an \"Irish\" jumbot was because it had corned beef in it.  Oh my it was delicious.

In the past my mother has ordered the flavored french toast with the blueberries.  I still remember it being one of the most different and delicious breakfast plates I have ever had.  

I will defiantly be back to the Dor-Stop soon.  It is honestly one of the best breakfast places I have been to in the area."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite breakfast spot in the city.  Yes, Pamela's hot cakes are amazing, but this place has the best all-around breakfast for sure.
Best thing to do is get there right when they open.  Don't be surprised if there isn't already a crowd standing outside.  If you do have to wait for a table, be patient, it's totally worth it.  Try the hotcakes.  My favorite is the pumpkin flavor they have end of summer/fall.  They're SO fluffy and delicious."}
{"text":"DorStop is my favorite breakfast spot but on this visit I was extremely disappointed.  I stopped in on a whim alone and sat at the counter.  While I was eating my delicious breakfast a dishwasher stood in front of me and spit  in the garbage can on the other side of the counter literally a foot away from me.  I immediately wanted to throw up.  I did not finish my meal and got up and paid and left.  They were too busy too mention something and they never asked how everything was or I would have said something.  I am not sure if I will go back which is really a shame.  I love that place."}
{"text":"I stopped in here after seeing the place on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. I had a late breakfast with my boss, as we were both in town from Miami to do some research for the travel section in the magazine I edit.
Unfortunately, this was the first DDD meal that didn't leave me wanting more. The marquee dish on the show was the Jumbot. I had it and it didn't do very much for me. That said, it wasn't bad either.
On the bright side, my boss said that Dor-Stop's was one of the best eggs benedicts he'd ever had. He's very critical of restaurants, so I take that praise pretty seriously.
Service was as friendly and informal as yo"}
{"text":"Delicious food. Friendly and prompt service. Only complaint is there is no pork alternative (I.e. Turkey bacon, turkey sausage, etc) the staff makes sure you feel comfortable and always keeps your coffee cup full! Definitely would like to return!"}
{"text":"What more can be said about this place? You need to try the hot cakes!!

At first I wasn't sure three of these would be enough. Sure enough, when they came out, I thought \"okay this is a decent amount\"... and then I proceeded to take my first bite.

These are the fluffiest, most incredibly good and filling hot cakes that I've ever had! I don't know how they do it! I made it through 2 1/2 of them before I hung my head in defeat. But it didn't matter, because I was in my happy place. These cakes are absolute heaven, and if you haven't tried them yet, you are missing out!

I never thought I could get emotional about food, but this is one of those times. I recall my mom once craving crabs from a crab shack in Ft Lauderdale for over 10 years after having them once. I feel like Dor-Stop pancakes will be the equivalent for me. My God, will I miss this place and those hot cakes."}
{"text":"Good, standard diner breakfast fare.  The potato pancakes tasted a little sweet, which was odd.  The pecan French toast was spot-on delicious."}
{"text":"1 star service, 3-4 star food.  And the only reason service gets a 1 instead of zero is because a 2nd waitress covered for the rude inattentive first one.  Look back through these reviews and you'll see other people with the same complaint.  Wife and I stopped at 7AM on a Saturday.  There were 2 waitresses and the place was about 2/3 empty.  Our waitress was uncomfortably unfriendly to us, but to people she recognized that came in she was pleasant and chatty.  We heard the specials when she was at the table next to ours but she didn't tell us.  After the first coffee refill she never came back and the other waitress stopped twice at our table instead.  When she did stop at our table and we'd say thanks for the refill or for bringing our breakfast, she completely ignored us, no you're welcome, nothing.  The food is decent but not good enough to ever come back there if we have to take a chance on getting stuck with that waitress again."}
{"text":"This place is the BOMB I had the best omelette ever the Jumbot  it came with potato style hash browns and some bomb toast  I also got to share a philly omelette and some banana pancakes. Everything was 5 star even the service."}
{"text":"This is what a diner should be.  Yummy, fresh(ish) food with staple american bites like burgers and meatloaf sandwiches.  Cramped, with experienced servers that leave the check on the table with the food.

My soup was the meal's highlight- obviously made from scratch in the kitchen.  Reuben burger- pretty good.  Side of fries- okay.  came from the freezer, but were served hot.

I would dine again.  if i am ever awake during their hours of operation."}
{"text":"Had the steak n' eggs when we went there.  I prefer the same thing from the diner around the corner.  Apparently this place is known for their pancakes.  Maybe I'll try that next time. A consisteny line of yinzers around the block can't be wrong."}
{"text":"Another DDD spot to cross off my list. First one in the East Coast!

I was intrigued with their pumpkin pancakes and raspberry stuffed french toast when I watched the segment on DDD. Finally had the opportunity when I visited by brother for his graduation at Carnegie Mellon. The wait time is killer, so be sure to bring something to entertain yourself for the time being. I think we waited for half an hour, but we weren't terribly hungry, so it was fine. Finally sat down and looked at the menu deciding what to order. Both the pumpkin pancakes and raspberry french toast looked so good, but I didn't want to be a pig and eat both of them (well, I could if I wanted to). My mother suggested that we can order both items and split it from there. Brilliant! Get to taste the both worlds. :)

Pumpkin pancakes were delish! A bit on the dense side, yet still fluffy. Spices were so fragrant, like it was Thanksgiving! Not terribly sweet, but at the perfect amount where you don't need the syrup. Huge servings; your serotonin levels will rise. :) The raspberry stuffed french toast would probably have to be my favorite. The crusty/crunchy exterior of the french toast slices stole the stage. The whole dish was sweet enough that syrup was also not necessary.

Their peach cobbler french toast special looked tempting, but sadly they ran out right when we were seated. Sad. :("}
{"text":"Why we pay $9 for an omelette with a couple ingredients, boring home fries, and 2 slices of \"off the shelf\" basic bread, I don't know, but I just did. How these inexpensive breakfast foods have risen to the price of a decent meal I don't know. Save your money and get the same breakfast for less than $5 at the local Eat n Park chain. Or go somewhere where they have some creative breakfast menu items like Pamela's."}
{"text":"The best part about the Dor Stop was that they didn't make me pay for the half cook unacceptable potato pancakes.
We did not accept a free meal but we had the potato pancakes removed after the waitress agreed they looked disgusting and were inedible. 

I love DDD so this was at the top of my list.

Parking is difficult and hard to come by. It's Potomac Avenue. 
On my way in someone said \"don't order the pancakes they were terrible and half cooked\" when I asked how everything was inside. Yikes - he wasn't kidding. 
My pancakes were undercooked and not good. 

We haven't returned. It was definitely a disappointment."}
{"text":"After an appointment with my new doctor in Brookline, Dad decided to take me out to brunch. 

\"Hey, what's that place that Guy went to?\"

\"Which guy?\"

\"Guy Tieri. That goofy kid on that food channel.\"

\"Guy Fieri, you mean. What? Dor-Stop?\"

\"Yeah, yeah, that place.\"

\"Ok, we can go again.\" 

\"Oh I know that sound. You already been there. Well, tough. I'm buyin'\"

Dad's getting up there in digits. How guilty would I feel if he met his maker without having gone to The Dor-Stop?

Dad went with a safe sausage-n-eggs-n-home fries breakfast that he enjoyed the bejeezus out of. I became demented and ordered something from the specials on the chalkboard: The Chili Cheeseburger Bowl. 

I'm thinking D-S's recent rise to fame may have had an influence on the creation of this psychotronic horror film in a bowl. Bizarre, gaudy, and obscenely edible, a hamburger patty is placed atop some biscuits, anointed with cheddar that is melted into a crisp dome of sorts, doused with chili, and garnished with diced onions in the raw. The heavy biscuits took in the red, meaty, yet mild juices of the chuck-n-bean laden chili, which was complimented by the hardened cheddar and fresh, sweet onions. Savory, crunchy, doughy, beefy chords were all struck by a meal that if it were a song, would have been recorded by Slayer...

And if darkness hadn't been already enthroned triumphant, for dessert I had a fiendishly fudgy wedge of a chocolate cake so debauchedly bulky, it would make angels choke...

Only a glass of milk blessed by a cleric could wash it down. 

Diner Demons lurk in Dormont...

As do Darren and his Daffy Dad. 

\"I think you take this ^&%$ too seriously,\" he sez."}
{"text":"Yes... Dorstop was on the Food Network but I believe that the show has brought too much business to the local breakfast/lunch restaurant. Most of the time the servers are cranky and rushing so they forget items or customer needs and the food isn't as good as it used to be. Either they need to expand their staff and restaurant or many others will see what I have."}
{"text":"Have been to the Dor-Stop a couple of times recently.  Able to get a table almost immediately.  One time I had the pancakes.  The pancakes are really good and actually more than I could eat; probably one of the better items on the menu.  Another time I had a eggs benedict special that was pretty good but the Hollandaise sauce is not that good just OK, probably not real fresh or comes out of a can. 
Both times are service was pretty good.  Our waitress was on top of it and friendly."}
{"text":"Definitely a must-try diner in Pittsburgh, and a great place to take out-of-town guests for a unique breakfast.  
My plate of choice has got to be the Apple Cinnamon Pancakes.  If you are going for the first time, make sure somebody in your group orders pancakes.  They are a must try.  The raspberry french toast is delicious and very filling too.  The omelets are good as well."}
{"text":"A nice surprise as I'm not a diner person. We stopped by on recommendation of a friend after a hockey game. The pumpkin pancakes were delicious, as were the west coast eggs Benedict. Beware, though - the eggs Benedict are not served in typical fashion. It is the size of the plate and served with potatoes. The toppings were placed on top of several slices of (good) Italian bread. 

Some reviewers mention the servers. Yes - a bit short, however, expected with as busy as they are. Our waitress was short, but extremely nice, attentive and we had great customer service. I think they just want to turn tables since there are so many people waiting in such a small space. 

Expect a wait - put your name on the list & expect a minimum wait of 30 minutes. We took our hockey team and they were very accommodating in separating and seating us at several tables when they were available."}
{"text":"We experienced great service!! The apple cinnamon and pumpkin pancakes were amazing!! Very dense and filling with perfect flavor! The home fries are more like giant chunks of potatoes smashed a little bit, not crispy. The eggs were great but the bacon sucked (definitely recommend sausage instead). Definitely would return to have more pancakes."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday morning. There was already a bunch of people waiting outside. Wait was about ten mins which wasn't bad. 

The servers were efficient and ran like a well oiled machine.  

We ordered the special pumpkin French toast and the guy's version jumbot. The French toast was delicious. It was covered in the pumpkin spread which I worried would be too sweet but it was just right. It came with a few strips of crispy bacon. 

The guys jumbot was a melting pot of delicious ingredients including eggs,  potatoes,  jalapeños, hot Italian sausage and cheese. At first,  we thought it would be spicy on the account of the sausage and jalapeño but it wasn't,  instead it brought the dish to life. The Italian toast really brought this powerhouse of flavors home. Becareful the portion is large and can fill you up quickly.  

Will definitely return for another delicious breakfast one of these mornings."}
{"text":"I didn't realize this place was featured on Diners, Drive Ins and Dives. The place itself is small and has that diner vibe. Despite being small and busy we were seated right away. Our waitress was great! She was around many times to refill our coffees and was very attentive. I tried the Guy's mix (I honestly forget the name). It was delicious. If you're in the area you should check it out."}
{"text":"A little further than most brunch places, but hoped it would be worth it. It was hard to decide what to order here because people have raved about half the items on their menu. Decided to get the stuffed raspberry French toast (which looked really good in photos so I knew I had to get it), sausage patties (you get one meat option with the French toast), and German potato pancakes. To be honest, I didn't think the food was amazing. I did enjoy the raspberry French toast, but like most people have already mentioned, it wasn't exactly stuffed. Sausage patties are a staple brunch meat for me, but these tasted microwaved and like they've been sitting out for a while. The potato pancakes I was pretty excited for, but they didn't taste like the potato pancakes I've had at German restaurants, so it wasn't what I thought it'd be. The French toast alone I would give 4 stars out of 5, but the sides I got bring my taste rating for Dor-Stop down. Although I would consider coming back, I'd definitely order different sides.

{"text":"Best breakfast around. 

The pancakes are indescribably delicious. I mean, every time I eat them I'm in disbelief by how amazing they are. The banana pancakes are one of my favorite foods in this world. The bacon is also very good and crispy. 

They have good lunch options, too. They made a good burger and the Rueben is very good. 

Friendly staff and welcoming atmosphere. 

They get very busy on the weekends, so expect to wait for a table. Trust me though, it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Folks this is very overrated.. they had Guy's Diners Drivein and Dives there only because Guy's parents knew owner. This is very avg food at best. Its nothing special.I wont go back.. Very small and uncomfortable. They have a large sign in window to play on Guy's visit a number of years ago. Dont fall for it."}
{"text":"I went to this location on a Saturday morning at about 10 a.m. It was just me and my boyfriend. The wait was about 10 to 20 minutes at the most. The seating is kind of cramped however I get it because it's a small dinner. I was anxious to go because it had been featured on the Food Network. I can say that I was not disappointed with my omelette nor was I disappointed with my boyfriend's raisin bread french toast lol. He also got Circle sausage partties. He said the eggs were superb! I ordered the South of the Border omelet. Being a Southern girl I wanted to make sure that the Omelette would stand up to its name. The omelette was large in size and came with some homemade potatoes. The omelette was tasty it was wrapped with sausage and different vegetables which was good with cheese and salsa on top. Yummy to say the least however I would have preferred some sour cream with it as well. (I was so hungry i didn't bother to ask) I gave this place four stars for the good, quick, friendly, tasty, service I received. It was IHOP prices with the home feel."}
{"text":"I was kinda disappointed. I came here for brunch with my boyfriend on his birthday. We got seated right away, but waited 10 minutes for anyone to come up to us. I understand that they were busy, but 2 people after us got seated and served before we did. We finally got served and the waitress wasn't all that nice. No apology for not being waited on for 10 minutes. Needless to say....their food was amazing. I had guys version of the jumbot and I can't stop thinking about it. If I had a little better service then would totally be a 5 star, but service is something that makes people come back. Hopefully it was just a. Very busy and off day for them, because everything else was awesome!"}
{"text":"Came on a Saturday morning and there was a 10 minute wait. Been here several times and always get the pancakes. This time ordered the pumpkin pancakes which was perfect for fall. The pancakes are moist, dense, and filling. I didn't even need syrup! The bacon was also cooked perfectly and a nice change from the sweetness of the pancakes. My friend ordered the veggie and cheese omelette and was pleased. Always a great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"This was a wonderful place to stop in for brunch. Delicious Exquisite food, and fantastic service.  I would stop in here again any time when I'm in town."}
{"text":"This was my second time at the Dor-Stop and it was just as great as the first. First time, we got there around 10am on a weekend day, and there was a wait outside. Second time, we got smarter and still went on the weekend, but earlier- 8am. Yes, rolling out of bed early on the weekend is a pain, but well worth it. 

The first time I ordered the Eggs Benedict and from my memory it was a must-try, I would order again. Today, I got the Banana Walnut Hotcakes and they were perfect! The bananas were fresh and visible, and there were just enough chopped walnuts so it wasn't underwhelming or overwhelming. 

The service is great. Our waitress was very attentive, and always around for drink refills, but not the annoying \"always stopping by\". She also made sure to grab the box that I almost forgot as we were leaving because the portions are huge. Overall, outstanding traditional diner in the South Hills."}
{"text":"I dream about this place and how yummy it is, you should expect a wait on the weekends, because I'm not the only one who feels that way.   Right now I'm on a potato pancake kick, I seriously can't walk out of there without having them.  They are also quite famous for their regular pancakes white are deliciously dense, I don't think we've ever had anyone at our table finish their pancakes, but they heat up well the next day to prolong the decadence!"}
{"text":"Wow!!  My wife and I had breakfast at the Dor-Stop this morning and it was outstanding!!  We had about a 20 minute wait to get in but it was worth it.  The service was fast and the food was great.  We will surely return......"}
{"text":"I've heard of this place quite a few times, but haven't found myself in the area to try it out. I was pleased to find they were open on the 4th of July (relax, people. We tip well.) so we stopped in.

There was a LONG line waiting to get in to the small, diner style setting. I went in to put our name on the list and there were two breakfast bar seats available! Score!

Even though they were out of this world busy, the staff was friendly and chatted us up when they would pour some more coffee for us. 

I thought I wanted breakfast (I mean, I did, but the menu has so many good choices!) but I went with the Rachel Reuben. It was great! Also served with two of the best potato pancakes I've ever had. Applesauce AND sour cream, please. :)

The hub had a philly cheese steak (and half of my Rachel) with fries. There were no leftovers to be had.

All in all we are glad we stopped in and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First of all, this place is packed for a reason, but if you are alone or with a friend stools at the bar are first come, first serve.  We got in quickly that way, and enjoyed a couple of American breakfasts (eggs, potatoes, hot rope aka hot sausage, toast).  

The service was prompt and friendly and the food delicious.  Also cheap as hell.  We always try to stop here when in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"My second trip here.  The first was on a weekend.  Never again.  Too crowded and I had to squeeeeeeeeeeeze onto a counter stool between two strangers.

Today I went on a Friday morning  Was lovely and got a booth to myself.

Both time the food and service were 5 stars.  Really good breakfast staples.  I had eggs, bacon and home fries today.  Also a side order of potato pancakes, because why stop with just one starchy dish?  

These pancakes are not your bubby's potato pancakes, though they do come with apple sauce or sour cream (or both if you ask nicely). These are, I guess, German style.  They have some chopped up vegetable (broccoli?).  They also have the dreaded (for me) ingredient of garlic.  I cannot eat garlic.  It makes me feel illllllllllllllllllll.  Plus i taste it for daaaaaaaaays.  So, one bite in I realized I had ordered something I couldn't eat.  But I couldn't send it back -- it was perfectly prepared, fresh, etc.  So I decided to say nothing.  

But the waitress walked by and noticed I wasn't eating the potato pancakes and asked me what was wrong.  When I explained the garlic thing, she immediately offered to take them off the bill.  Without my asking.  Instead I welcomed a second order of bacon (moo moo, that's me).  Next time I will remember to try the ham from the bone because that looked terrific!"}
{"text":"Upbeat atmosphere and very good breakfast! The home fries and banana oatmeal pancakes were sooo delicious!"}
{"text":"I went in intending to get the much ballyhooed Rasberry Pancakes, but as I browsed the menu the server, Laura, highly recommended the Oatmeal Banana Pancakes. So, I changed my order. Although I did this immediately, and apologized sincerely, this really ticked Laura off, though she said it was okay. I also asked for a box (saving her an extra trip), since I only eat 1 pancake.

The big pancakes arrived so piping hot, I had to let them cool almost 5 minutes. No box, though. They tasted very good, pretty balanced flavors. They were \"heavy\",  hearty, I guess.  Laura insisted I try it without syrup first. Okay. It was so tasty, I ate almost the whole pancake before using syrup. I took the other two home, but had to ask for a box. Again.

The coffee was typical diner coffee. I hunted Laura down, previously just standing at the counter, who was wiping the last table in the back, asking for a refill.
Two minutes later, she brought coffee, took my plate and all my silverware. She didn't bring more cream (I was out). I didn't see her on the floor (hardly at all during my visit), and told the two servers chatting behind the counter, that I didn't have cream, or a spoon, and needed to go, so I didn't even drink my second cup. They became huffy, and said I should've asked for more cream and a spoon (I was in the ladies room). They didn't offer me a cup to go, either. So, I left, but with a slightly bad taste, because of the service."}
{"text":"They have one of the best breakfasts in Pittsburgh. I have never had anything bad here. Great meat products, just don't get the sausage patties. They are not of high quality, but everything else is. French Toast is excellent. Pancakes are good, but are really sweet like a donut. You have to be in the mood for them. Like I said they are very sweet. Only negative of this place is the restaurant is small and crammed, it is always packed, and there is always a wait."}
{"text":"Warning: you will not be seated until your entire party is there and parking sucks!  This place is jamming busy and very noisy.  Beware if you have a hangover.  The banana pancakes are good and rest of what was ordered smelled yummy, too.  This is an experience, but perhaps not a repeat for me."}
{"text":"I have had this place on my bucket list for some time now. Today my girlfriend and I decided to go for brunch. We had a very difficult time parking but managed to secure a spot on the street. After \"feeding the meter\" we went to the diner and learned that today and tomorrow they had free street parking due to July 4th holiday.

We laughed it off and were seated fairly promptly. The place is small and very crowded. Food is all homemade from scratch. My girlfriend opted for breakfast so she settled for a veggie omelet with toast and I chose a turkey Rachel. The sandwich came on marble bread and was filled with sauerkraut an cheese. It also came with potato pancakes. Portion sizes were generous and the food was very good.

They are noted for their pancakes which we will try on another visit. We got our meals rather quickly and our waitress was very attentive to our needs. There is an $8.00 minimum charge for credit cards and there is a sign telling you that you must tell them when you order whether or not to split your check.

The tables are topped with various advertisers and they have interesting things to observe while you wait for your meal.

My suggestion would be to come during off hours or non-holiday especially if you want to have a nice breakfast or lunch. They are only open until 3 in the afternoon. We had a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"This is the second review of The Dor- Stop, I gave it another star this time.

Canadian Friend of Joe (CFoJ) was getting ready to catch the 4:45 flight to Philly, and wanted to share one more meal before leaving the Burgh. He was hungry for breakfast, after all it was only noon and he was still in bed. So he calls me and says meet in Dormont for some serious diner food.

He's already at a table when I walk in, sitting there eating a huge cinnamon roll, split in half, grilled and looking soooo delicious. So he points to the wall and says \"Guy from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives was here\". Spitting pieces of Cinnamon roll at me in his excitement, who knew Canada got the food network?

I ordered the oatmeal pancakes, knowing full well there are eggs in the batter (somethings are just worth having as a vegan) but at least I was smart enough to have the butter on the side so I could discard it later.

He ordered the raspberry french toast, over hard eggs (Canadian for broken yokes) and bacon, a large OJ, coffee, and the cinnamon bun he was noshing when i entered. The man can eat, and he's so thin, I really hate him and his metabolism.

My oatmeal cakes were HUGE, and three to an order, I got the first one down without any problem, they were moist, chewy, flavorful with real oatmeal and cinnamon, and the syrup was almost not needed as they have a natural sweetness to them.

He devoured his french toast, eggs, bacon, saying it was one of the best breakfasts places he's ever been to.

It's a shame we take restaurants for granted, here's a guy from Vancouver, over 3000 miles away wishing the Dor-Stop was in his home town."}
{"text":"As avid DDD devotees when we visit any town, we had to try one in Pittsburgh and Dor-Stop was (kind of) on our way. Parking is tough around here so my husband dropped me off so I could put our names in.

We were worried about the wait but only ended up waiting about 15 minutes and got 2 seats at the bar. We ordered the signature raspberry stuffed French toast and Guy's version of the Italian Jumbot. 

The French toast was super yummy and the Jumbot was also tasty. However, though still good, the Jumbot was not as impressive as we had hoped for an signature dish. It was kind of an omelette with potatoes and a bunch of random ingredients. Also just to note, the French toast is not \"stuffed\" but rather the raspberry sauce is drizzled generously on top. 

Our bill was under $20 so it was a quality meal for a very very low price. No complaints on our end, Dor-Stop is well worth a visit if you're ever in the Pittsburgh area!"}
{"text":"Fellow Yelper Lori has this...thing...for Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. It's not about Guy Fieri, it's about the mom & pop spots, where people do their food up with a lot of love and plenty of grease (elbow and otherwise). The Dor-Stop has been featured on DDD, and so, we needed to eat here.

Like many places in the Pittsburgh area, I've been lost in this neighborhood before, but never noticed this cute little place. NOTE: it's small, it's crowded, come with only your best friends, be prepared to make friends while you wait for a table to open up. If you're lucky, the front counter folks will bring out pancake samples while you're waiting - they're a cross between Deluca's and Pamela's - kind of crispy on the outside but fluffy on the inside? I dunno.

ANYWAY. Service, efficient and friendly. Menu - all the good stuff, with potato pancakes and other little bits, along with the DDD featured items. I got the Guy's Way, which was a nice mix of savory breakfasty things. Tasty without the need for hot sauce.

We were in and out pretty quick, but didn't feel rushed. Classic diner - will be back if'n I'm over this way again."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday morning at about 10am and only had to wait about 10min for a table (party of 2). Service was quick and polite, food was delicious, and prices reasonable. I got the chocolate chip banana pancakes and my husband got the west coast eggs Benedict. It was definitely worth the trip to Dormont from the north hills. Recommend getting here before 10 because the wait seemed to be quite a bit longer when we left a little before 11."}
{"text":"Loved the pirogies but it ended there. Three cheese Mac n cheese was average. My breakfast was warm by the time it got to the table and cold within five minutes on a cold day because the restaurant was so cold. Wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"We finally made our way to Dor-Stop after always hearing people raving about how it's the best in the city. We went around 10:30 on Sunday and had to wait about 45 minutes for a table for four to open. The atmosphere is exactly what you would want and expect from a diner, right down to the greasy food and cramped dining area. My in laws got oatmeal walnut pancakes, which they liked, and a side of home fries. They have been here before and that's what they always get. Why mess with what works?
 
I ordered the farmers omelet, which to be honest didn't really have much flavor. There are so many ingredients in it that I couldn't single anything out. The bright side is that they were quick with the coffee refills, and more importantly they poached my wife's eggs perfectly. Which isn't easy to do. 

The meal was pretty cheap for four people, and the atmosphere was cool, so we will probably give it another shot. I would just stick to a more simple omelet."}
{"text":"I went to the Dor-Stop last weekend for breakfast.  My friend explained to me that this was a long time staple to the neighborhood, it was a diner, but it was GOOD!  I am usually skeptical of diner food, but when he told me that it had been featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives I figured it must be pretty good!

I don't usually order sweets for breakfast, but I decided to switch it up and get the Raspberry Stuffed French Toast.  Whoa - holy sweet, rich, and delish!  The bread had an odd texture for french toast, it almost tasted deep fried.  The raspberry compote was really good but I was only able to eat half of my dish, so we switched plates half way through the meal.  He had the Guy's Jumbot, which was a large scrambler with spicy Italian sausage, jalapeno, onions, peppers, egg and cheese.  It had a great kick to it without being over powering.  Even though my french toast was really good, I was kind of regretting not ordering a savory dish.  We also had a short stake of pancakes to share because he told me that the Dor-Stop was known for their hot cakes (secret recipe).  I am not a huge pancake person, but I could tell that there was definitely something a little bit different about these.  They were flavorful and had a hint of a spice I can't put my finger on.

The service was quick and everyone was friendly.  The servers were constantly walking around re-filling water and coffee.  When we were leaving there was a huge crowd near the door waiting to be seated.  I suggest going early if you don't want to wait for a table."}
{"text":"They have great bacon!!! I ordered a simple meal just the bacon and pancakes. Their pancakes are good but very very dense. Lol. They are not your typical pancakes. I don't even think I could eat a whole one before I was full. 

I cannot remember any issues with them. Which was nice. Food was good,  service was good as well."}
{"text":"It will be a while before I step foot in here again, if at all.  Ordered the All-American Breakfast, burger well done and eggs over medium.  The burger was rare and not cooked.  Ridiculously pink in the middle of burger.  The eggs were snotty, not even cooked enough for sunny side up eggs, let alone over medium.  How freaking hard is it to cook a burger?  Or eggs?  I'm sorry I'm one of those people that cannot eat ground meat not completely cooked.  I would rather have it burnt than not cooked at all.  Turned my stomach and couldn't take another bite.  2 stars for the lyonnaise potatoes or it was gonna be one star.  And in this place, it's basically you bought it, you eat it!  Or don't eat it! But don't expect it to be rectified."}
{"text":"Cute little place in dormont. Unique and delicious breakfast items. Delicious egg dishes and their pancakes are also made perfectly. This little gem might be my new favorite breakfast spot in the Burg!"}
{"text":"Always busy but worth the wait. It was even featured a Diners, Dives and Drives. I get the Guy's version for breakfast. Chorizo sausage, eggs, potatoes,  onions, peppers, tomatoes, cheese and jalapenos. My wife loves their raspberry stuffed french toast or banana chocolate chip pancakes."}
{"text":"I wish this place was closer to where I live now. This was my go to for breakfast when I lived in Brookline. 

Totally worth the wait."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The hot cakes are my favorite. Chocolate chip or apple cinnamon, can't go wrong with either. Always very good service when ordering for pickup as well. Looking forward to the next breakfast I can grab here already."}
{"text":"You know how JImmy Buffet has Cheeseburger in Paradise? Mine is more like Pancake in Paradise and this place is it! 

While Pamela's serves up the amazing thin crepe-like pancakes, The Dor-Stop serves up the fluffy equivalent. The list of different combos goes on and on. And if you're with a really good friend, you can order two different ones and split them! Genius!

I split the banana chocolate chip pancakes and the pumpkin pancakes. While the pumpkin was incredible, I think I slightly more enjoyed the banana chocolate chip just because the combo is such a winning one! But come fall, I may be all over the pumpkin ones again. Although, I'd probably be cheating myself because I have to work my way down the list of them all!

The only thing that would pull me away would be the french toast. It almost seems cruel I have to choose between the two! And it's so dirt cheap too! I think for three people it was around $25 bucks. With coffee and some sides! 

I think there's some other stuff on the menu, but who knows if I'll ever even experience them... how can I with those pancakes!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service (a waitress not even ours double-checked my coffee-refilling needs).

For the money, the portion sizes are large enough to either _really_ fill ya up or provide leftovers.

Nice atmosphere, good location, and such and such. Just do it ... .  :P"}
{"text":"Sister was driving through the area and heard pretty good things about this place, so we decided to try it out. We had to order take out since my sister needed to get back on the road. She got the Farmer's Omelette and I got the Meat Lover's Omelette. They were both pretty tasty; the home fries were delicious; and the toast was good. However, it wasn't anything spectacular or out of the ordinary. It was good diner food though; I liked it."}
{"text":"An experience worth having when visiting the area. The pancakes are above and beyond what you'd expect. The service is less than stellar, slow and orders incomplete. In spite of that, it is worth a visit. An extra kudos for a clean restroom."}
{"text":"For all the hype of this South Hills breakfast spot...meh. Just stay in the city for breakfast/brunch. World famous hot cakes? If you're into dense + chewy...perhaps. There are plenty of omelettes and other savory selections, but they just aren't that special except for the jumbot and the melt in your mouth Italian toast. The coffee is average and the service is anything but friendly -- not a good impression for a first timer."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast - get there early, because it was packed. It had a real mom and pop diner feel, with local advertisements all over the top of the table. I got their (apparently) well known Jumbot - a dish with everything thrown in - eggs, potatoes, peppers, onions. I got the Guy version, which had hot peppers and hot sauce. Honestly, if not for the peppers, I really don't think that I would have cared for it too much - it would have been quite bland, and I still used a lot of ketchup on it. Having said that, it was still filling and tasted pretty good. My friend had their french toast - filled with raspberries. We both liked that very much - light, not too sweet, and tasty."}
{"text":"J and I came here for breakfast. Potomac Ave was under construction, however people were still flocking to this spot which said something to us. Our wait time was 20 minutes, so we decided to take a walk as it was nice outside. The diner was a nice place with a diverse clientele, from couples to families, to college students, which was important for us. All of the waitresses were great and worked well together. I ordered the Farmer's omelette consisting of turkey, mushrooms, spinach, tomato, and cheddar cheese. It also came with onions, but I don't like them. With my omelette, I ordered a bagel and potatoes. J ordered 3 pancakes with a side of breakfast ham and coffee. Everything we are was so delicious! The food was tasty and not too heavy. Everything was around $25, which made J happy. Definitely a place we will be returning to."}
{"text":"Let's be honest, there are some core diner foods out there that rarely vary from location to location.  For example, scrambled eggs.  I have yet to see someone toss out something like, \"Wow, the eggs were simply divine - fluffy, yellow and...and....fluffy and yellow.\"  Generally speaking, your homemade scrambled eggs probably taste pretty similar to your diner eggs.  Now, let's talk pancakes.  Pancakes are a different beast.  You see, you could add buttermilk, regular milk, water, ice cream, eggs, various flours, and a plethora of additives to create your perfect pancake.  At The Dor-Stop, I received my generics and quite honestly, the pancakes scared me a little.  Why?  Well, because when I put my butter on them, the outer crust made a sound.  Yes, I said crust....on a pancake.  Not pizza....p-a-n-c-a-k-e.  I figured if nothing else, I now had a frisbee to take on my way down to Orlando.  So, I began to slice in to my crusty cake and I noticed a squishiness as I penetrated the outer shell.  How perplexing, I thought!  This felt like a job for Sherlock Holmes!  Since he's not real, I moved on.  I took a bite and I must tell you, these pancakes were flipping awesome.  Yes, that was a flapjack reference.  The crunchy on the outside coupled with the chewy middle were a serious but welcomed surprise.  I had no idea pancakes could have this dichotomy!  I polished off my stack and finished my generics with delight.  If these pancakes did not floor me, I would say this diner is still a slight step above many others of its kind, but these pancakes do give it a leg up.  As far as the environment, it is a diner.  So, it looks and feels like a diner.  The neighborhood is cool, though.  When I went there was some construction but everyone on the streets were friendly and for some reason, \"Come and play...everything's A-OK..\" kept going through my head as I walked down the alleyway.  Now, was there a little green monster peering at me from the lid of a garbage can....?  I guess you'll need to check it out yourself."}
{"text":"The Dor-Stop was the best diner food I have had in Pittsburgh in quite some time. The atmosphere and staff are exceptional. I ordered the eggs Benedict and they used real thick-cut delicious ham. I would recommend that Pittsburgh natives and visitors give this place a shot."}
{"text":"If I could give this less than 1 star, I would. My fiance were visiting Pittsburgh and tried Dor-Stop because of the great reviews....we were UNIMPRESSED.  It was super crowded, there was nothing special about the menu ( except some slop combination eggs, potatoes and cheese that I can make at home), and the pancakes were a little undercooked for my taste.  I asked the waitress to take the pancakes off the bill, and she told me that they have to charge me for 1 pancake since I let my fiance taste it. SMH. I gave them another chance and ordered a sandwich to-go so that I had a snack for our drive home, and I threw it out because it was DISGUSTING. Don't bother going."}
{"text":"When I saw that this place was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, I was immediately sold!

The decor felt like grandma's house. Little knickknacks everywhere and the signs are hilarious! The staff constantly bussed tables at an impressive speed. We sat at the window seat, awesome for people watching! 

Food was excellent! Certainly one of the best brunches I've ever had. I ordered a veggie omelette and my boyfriend got an Italian jumbot. My omelette was packed with delicious veggies and his jumbot had these perfect crispy little homefries. 

Dor-Stop only gets 4 versus 5 stars due to lackluster service. Our waitress did her job properly. However, we did not get her name, no smile, no friendliness that you would expect at such a cozy establishment. 

I left feeling empty in my heart, but not my stomach!"}
{"text":"We went for breakfast after seeing this place on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  SO amazing, I had the stuffed raspberry French toast.  Everything tasted so fresh and delicious , worth the wait if you go!  My kids tried the Hot Cakes, so much better than pancakes!"}
{"text":"This place is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. Went to Pittsburgh for the weekend, ended up going twice in 2 days for breakfast. The staff are very nice and welcoming, and were very helpful in choosing what to get. The pumpkin pancakes are the best I've ever had. Ever. They are an absolute MUST. The banana chocolate chips pancakes were amazing. I ordered the jumbot with no meat and it was amazing. Their coffee is great too. What more could I want in a breakfast place? Will definitely come back if I'm in Pittsburgh again, I just wish they had one in NJ. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Pumpkin Pancakes are to die for. Actually all their pancakes are to die for. This is a place featured on the Food Network's show \"Dinners Drive-in and Dives\" that did not disappoint. 

A local place run by a local family of friendly people. Affordable prices, delicious pancakes makes for a gem in the downtown area of Dormont, PA."}
{"text":"Perfect diner food!  We really enjoyed our brunch here over the weekend.  Definitely will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"I went to the Dor-Stop for a quick bite for lunch. This is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review. I ordered the eggs Benedict. It was the most delicious eggs Benedict I have ever had. It was a new take on a classic. The staff was so nice and welcoming. I will absolutely be returning!"}
{"text":"Shortly after moving to Dormont, while browsing the shops on Potomac, I came across the this gem of a diner. It was a Sunday after church and the line was wrapped around the block; as a diner enthusiast this was a fantastic sign. 

A few days later I brought a friend there for lunch the feta burger I had was amazing. The next time I went ,with my sister and nephew,  I got the burger again and an order of their famous pancakes. The flavor options were long, but I choose banana walnut. These where hands down the best pancakes I have ever consumed. 

The atmosphere is wholesome. The waitstaff is not friendly but accommodating. Honestly they don't have time to be overly friendly they are too busy. However they do a fine job serving you. 

All in all this place is an A-. The only downside for me was not having The cast from cheers welcome me by name. But the food is remarkable."}
{"text":"So with all the hype I was expecting fireworks.  Maybe I am tainted.  When you come from California where the food is very fresh, you are sometimes disappointed, this was one of those times.

My son watches, triple d, was so excited to be here, but at best was ok.  No fireworks.

I had the veggie burrito, my one son the egg burrito, and other son had the egg breakfast.  I ordered a side of bacon also.

My waitress brought out three scoops of sour cream, in little white contains, soggy to say the least.

My burrito, good; kids food was ok, eggs terrible bacon, Terrible.  I love bacon love it, this bacon was cheap tasting and tasted like the girdle.  Gross...

Sorry Dor-stop.  

If your every in Folsom Cali try Mary's gold miner cafe.  The bomb!"}
