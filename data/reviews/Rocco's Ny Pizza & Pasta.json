{"text":"When the delivery is cold and the mangers answer is \"you should pick it up\".......Not a place to continue to order from.  Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"The pizza is always great here much better than anything else in the area! the calzone lol? not so great , chicken fingers are big and flavorful when in full heat mode and the fries are always perfect and never greasy, great neighborhood place to get your quality pizza fix. Mondays are $9.99 one topping large nyc style pizza's. I always come here."}
{"text":"I've never been to NY and had authentic NY Pizza, and must admit, it's not my favorite style. I came here on a recommendation from a buddy that grew up in Brooklyn and said this place got it right. Well, my boy was correct, this place is damn tasty! They sell Boylans soda which had me from the start. Their pizza by the slice was pretty awesome and they had several options including a lasagna pizza. I had a slice of combo, a cucumber and tomato salad and a Boylans Black Cherry. It hit the spot! Meet some friends for lunch, hung out comfortably for about an hour, then partook of the complementary baked goods that they had before we left. I think they're called zeppoli, but don't quote me or my spelling. They had authentic Italian goods to purchase and it was all reasonably priced. Great staff, very attentive and courteous, proud of their product and it's quality, which speaks volumes.  Like I said before, NY style isn't my favorite, but I'll definitely be back here to get some more. Happy eating!!"}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza I've ever had!! So yummy! I got the lasagna pizza and Caprese salad.. Packed full of flavor!! Friendly staff also.. Definitely the new spot! Love love love!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick lunch. Great service and good food. Very convenient location with lots of parking."}
{"text":"I truly wish I could give this place 0 stars. Im from New York, I know my pizza AND I know how customer service should be. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT make an order for delivery. You will seriously be waiting HOURS for your food to come, IF IT COMES AT ALL. Oh i forgot, 9 times out of 10 it will be the wrong order ANYWAY.

 HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"My daughter and I just recently went to New York and when we came back to Vegas, we were craving New York Style pizza. We came to Rocco's and we were not disappointed! The pizza was crIspy and perfect. We ordered the student combo which wad 2 slices of cheese pizza and a drink for $4.99. We also ordered  garlic knots and a cannoli, which also were amazing. Honestly hits pretty close to home. The staff was also very friendly and it's a nice clean place that just reminds you of eating at an actual New York Pizzeria! Definitely going to come back again!"}
{"text":"We received a flyer for roccos we tried it what a mistake first of all for a LG supreme pie and antipasto salad it was 38.00 and change I asked why so much they say tax and delivery the. delivery fast but pie cold didn't matter pie was they worse we have ever had my husband who eats everything would not eat it try pizza my dear better food better quality"}
{"text":"In town visiting from Phoenix (originally from the Bronx) and asked the front desk at the hotel for a recommendation for good pizza.  We checked out Rocco's and am so happy we did.  The pizza is incredible,  just as good as NY!  We liked it so much that we called to order for dinner.  The lovely girl who answered the phone informed us that the delivery wait would be 45 min to an hour.   But if we wanted to pick it up,  it could be ready in 20 min.   I appreciated that so much.   We opted to pick up.   We had chicken francese, penne alla vodka and an antipasto salad.  Everything was delish!!  Looking forward to our next trip to Vegas so that we can try some other menu items!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I live in the neighborhood  shouldve came here alot sooner. Forgot to take a pic of my food. But for the retard who gave 2 stars because of a to go order with a paper plate, knucklehead. The food rocks. Authentic NY style Pizza. Almost wish I hadn't found it because I'm probably going to be eating here ALL the time and I'm gonna get fat."}
{"text":"I've been here before and the pizza is great. What bothers me is their delivery times are horrible. I called to order one large pepperoni pizza and was quoted a time of 45 minutes. I thought it was a little long for one pizza but whatever, I've had it before and it's good pizza.

An hour later I call back and she said that delivery driver had to come back and pick up my pizza and then go out again. I asked how long that would take because i don't want my food sitting under heat lamps for a long time. I heard the lady on the phone whispering to someone else and she told this girl that she told me 45 to an hour. If I was going to have wait that long I would have called someplace else.  She said it would take an extra 15-25 minutes for it to arrive. So now my original quote time has doubled and the lady on the phone just seemed inconvenienced. 

When my pizza finally arrived, about an hour and a half later, it was cold and cost me $20 bucks. I don't think I'll be coming back again after this shitty experience."}
{"text":"Great NY style thin crust pizza .... I will getting pizza here from now on. I really love the sausage and pepperoni pies. Just as good as pizza back east in Brooklyn. The prices are reasonable just wish the pizza were s little larger"}
{"text":"I tried Rocco's for the first time last week on the recommendation of a neighbor. I bought pizza by the slice-very convenient!  The crust was thin and delicious-reminded me of NYC! Looking forward to ordering a whole pizza with house made ricotta and house made sausage next time I'm in town. This place is bound to be a new favorite. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is that I'm reserving judgement until I try a few more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Recently ordered pizza and wings at Rocco's second time trying it and was just as delicious as the first ...The owner Dennis has crazy great customer service and I recommend this pizza to anyone best pizza by far on this side of town ....great job Roccos"}
{"text":"Terrible service. I Ordered delivery. The driver was too lazy to complete his delivery. He called me when he got in front of my building (actually it was the back of my building) so that I come all the way to his car to pick up my order from him. My pizza was cold, no napkins or paper plates with the order either. Of course, delivery charge was included in my bill, and shame on me I tipped out the driver on my credit card in advance."}
{"text":"Born and raised in Little Italy of the Bronx for 30 years and there is nothing in town that comes close to Rocco's. I tried it for the first time and got a Large Pie, Sausage and Pepper Stromboli, Eggplant Stromboli, Cheese Calzone and some of the specialty items they sell from a brand I haven't seen since I left NYC.

Everything was as good as it gets. Every Vegas Pizzaria can finally learn what a Stromboli is now!

I hope every neighborhood fortunate enough to have a Rocco's shows up to support this place because it would be a true shame if it fell off due to lack of business. You won't find a better pie west of the Mississippi, let alone Clark County. The Cheese Calzone is another item that displays what a true Cheese Calzone is and how it should taste. This place is not \"Good as far as Vegas Pizzaria's go\" this place holds it's own with anyone anywhere. All these fake Napoli, award winning casino pizza nonsense is put to shame because this IS the best in town and for the same prices as every other local pizza joint.

If I were you I would stop what I'm doing and run out to Rocco's right now and get a Pie, or a Calzone or whatever!"}
{"text":"SO SO SO GOOD! Everything is made from scratch. Big portions for the right price. I was starving and ordered the chicken fettuccine alfredo! Service was excellent and everyone was super welcoming and nice"}
{"text":"When you are born and raised in New York, pizza is something you grew up eating. When my husband who is originally from Brooklyn, moved to the west coast, he said it was hard to find good pizza that was like back home. My stepfather who is originally from Boston stumbled across this spot and of course, brought my husband here. Low and behold, New York pizza like it should be made! My husband was so thrilled to finally find a spot that he can come to when we are in Vegas to enjoy a nice big slice of pizza. In my husband's words, \"Pizza should be big enough to fold in half,\" and their pizza does just that! Our family are practically regulars here! Great food and great customer service!!"}
{"text":"I called at 2 o'clock to order a pizza and cannolis.  I let them know I didn't need it delivered until 3:30 since that is our lunch break at work. It was 3:40 and still no pizza so I called to check on the status. The cashier apologized and said he just left and that they were running late because they made fresh cannoli cream.  Our pizza finally showed up till 3:50, so almost two hours after I ordered it. It was warm like it had just been sitting there and the cannoli cream was liquid. Two hours later for a late delivery, Luke warm pizza, and liquid cannolis... that'll be the last time I order from Rocco's."}
{"text":"Just got my first pizza from Rocco's and it was completely cold. Waiting for my oven to heat up to heat up the pizza. Forgot the ranch sides we ordered as well. Very disappointed since we were excited to try it. Not sure if we will try it again. Hopefully they read this review and invest in more drivers and heat bags."}
{"text":"Great service. The man who takes the orders was very well mannered and let me know off all the deals. We ordered a simple cheese pizza, some garlic knots, stuffed shells and the dessert that is powder sugar and dough. Cost about 40 bucks with delivery. Pizza was nice and hot and the kids love the cheese and crust. We got the large pizza and with the big slices it was more then enough for all six of our kids. My husband is a long time fan and always goes for the pasta. We got our order quicker then expected and it was neatly packaged. With our big family it's hard to please everyone but Rocco's knocked it out of the park. We have found a new place for pizza night."}
{"text":"If you want some great NY Italian food this is the place to stop in as they have quite a great selection of all kinds of pizzas whole or by the slice, pastas, wings, chicken or veal entrees , oh & that bocconcini and tomato salad is my favorite!!!! They just opened another one on the strip(las Vegas Blvd) so if you haven't had a chance to check Rocco's out then it's a must cuz you definitely won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This place is awful. This place is one mile down from the Luxor and to this date still waiting for my pizza. 
How hard is it in the pizza delivery business to deliver to a big pyramid one mile down the street?
I waited and called three times. Each time told me it was on its way and meet them at the valet station. As mentioned still waiting.
DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!!! Keep you $45 and go to the food court for a snack."}
{"text":"I organized a staff luncheon with 20+ co workers all ordering separately off the menu..and we had to have it by 11:15 am..not only was all the food delicious, the delivery was fresh, hot and on time. Pizzas are excellent, chicken fingers and Strombolis are delicious.. They also sponsored a fund raiser for our school where they donated back 30% of sales for the day. Love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is overrated to say the least. Charge 3.25 per slice to add pepperoni is just a bit ridiculous. Won't be back!"}
{"text":"The food was really good, pizza was amazing, salad was great! And the service was great! We come here pretty often, my three year old loves the pizza here. My fiancé loved the garlic knots. Pizza slices are huge!!!"}
{"text":"Reliable and consistent.
Personally, I like this place for slices to-go. Walk in, pick a bunch of stuff and I'm on my way. No calling, no waiting. Instant pizza.

The White Pizza: very good.

They do good volume here, the foods are always fresh and the staff is not only kind, but they keep it very clean...which is major hard in an open pizza kitchen."}
{"text":"Not a fan of this pizza. It is very thin and hardly any sauce. The chicken fingers and fries were good. My main issue was with the ranch. I love pizza shop ranch dressing, and dip everything in it. I ordered 3 sides of ranch and they gave me 3 sides of packaged ranch, like you would get at subway. 
So disappointed. The delivery time was fairly quick though."}
{"text":"This restaurant is open for 2 weeks now and it is at a new location that is a convenient walk across from Mandalay Bay. The interior design of the restaurant portrays a montage of New York's historical photos of people, the busy city, and its brilliant landscape. It is a cozy space and the aroma of freshly baked pizza makes the place so warm and inviting. 

They serve big slice of New York Style pizza. You can choose from their Specialty Pizza Menu or you can Build Your Own Pizza. Their menu include appetizers like Fried Ravioli, Garlic Knots, Jumbo Chicken Wings, and they make Stromboli fresh daily, as well as pasta like Lasagna, Baked Ziti and Fettuccine Alfredo. Also they offer chicken and veal entrees, Eggplant Parmigiana, hot and cold sandwich, salad, and dessert like Cheesecake, Homemade Cannoli, Tiramisu, Italian Cookies, and Italian Ice.

I went for the Eggplant, Roasted Peppers, Smoked Mozzarella Stromboli ($8.99). Egg wash is applied on the dough and after it has bake, the Stromboli comes out nice and golden. I really like how they make the Stromboli taste so crispy, and the filling is full of delicious flavor. There are layers of eggplant cooked with egg, the roasted peppers are soft, the smoked mozzarella taste yummy, and I like dipping a piece of the Stromboli in marinara sauce. Since the food taste this good, I will most likely be a regular. And if you are a local, they do offer local discounts."}
{"text":"I love this place! I always feel like family when i come in. The pizza is perfectly crisp, snaps when you bite it but not burnt. They make their own mozzarella and ricotta daily. You gotta get a cannoli... it's better than sex!!"}
{"text":"First time here.  We came in right before they were closing, but they didn't give us any resistance and made us feel welcome to order and stay in and eat.  Very accommodating and really great pizza. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"If I could describe my experience in one word, it would be unfortunate.  The Pizza was bland.  There's no other word for it.  It tasted fresh, but but not very good.  Aside from that, staff is not very warm or friendly.  I was there on a Monday when they have a special, a large cheese pizza for $9.99.  For whatever reason, if you add toppings to it they charge you the regular price plus the cost of the toppings.  That really doesn't make sense to me and left me feeling like I overpaid.  I wasn't going to make a deal out of $3 but I got it out and everyone can decide for themselves if that's fair or not.  Unfortunately, the pizza just isn't good enough to justify a repeat visit anyway."}
{"text":"Great pizza and fresh and it's right off the strip with a free parking lot so extremely convenient! GO here, and this is coming from a chicagoan who's city have amazing pizza as well so definitely give it a try! And they have beautiful customer service."}
{"text":"Rocco's ny pizza on Las Vegas boulevard across from Mandalay Bay next to McDonald's has some amazing food! The pizza crust is amazing perfect crisp and warm and flavorful pizza! I tried the lasagna  tomato cucumber onion Salad  and they fresh made me some Zeppolis and brought them to my table just to try hot! Oh ya they have Coca Cola and CRUSHED ICE!!!! A must try"}
{"text":"OMG!!!  Best pizza ever!!!  I absolutely love this place and so does the  New York Family!!  Toasty pizza folded in half ..  Delicious!!!  A Sicilian to literally die for!!  The staff  was also awesome in tending to the needs of one very overly tired two year old!  Great place!  Great people!!  Awesome cannolis!!"}
{"text":"Gave these guys a shot and was not disappointed! I have to say the spaghetti and meatballs was so tasty and delicious.  I'm from Cali and compared to frantones pizza, Its close enough in taste.  If your in town give it a shot you won't be disappointed. Also don't forget to order the cannoli!"}
{"text":"I have only ordered for pickup  from here , so I have no idea how the delivery service is.  But as for pickup service this place could easily go up to 5 stars. 1- when I walked in the place i noticed it was clean, bright and put together well, they seem to take pride in the place and it shows. 2- Friendly service and nice attentive staff. 3- Great food from what I ordered so far, the sandwiches are some of the best I have had in town and the pizza was pretty good too, i will have to try more pizza as I only had the pizza by the slice so far. Everything had high quality fresh ingredients, no cheap stuff here.  I have had the meatball sub, the manhattan Toast , philly steak, eggplant parm sandwich and pepperoni pizza by the slice, all were perfect. I will update when I have had a few more visits.  But it seems to be a top notch pizza joint to me so far."}
{"text":"Okay Rocco's I see you !!! First time ordering here it was really good pizza  tasted great. Got big bag of Zeppoles nice and fresh  will order again!!"}
{"text":"Real good pizza! I will definitely come back. Real mozzarella cheese, crispy crust yo ... epic for outside NY."}
{"text":"I'm from Philly and I have lived in Las Vegas for 2 years. In that time I have never found a good NY slice, until now. 
Rocco's is a classic NY slice parlor.
HUGE slices, stromboli and calzone.
Italian classics are also on order like caprese salad and for your sweet tooth they make their own cannolis and tiramisu.
Rocco is the best and treats all his customers like family."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Roccos
Tonite. And it won't be my  last. My friend told me about this place and I had to try it. The pizza gets A plus
Probably the best pizza around. And its always good to support a local vendor. You can't go wrong here. So give it a try."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place! You can tell they use top quality ingredients. From pasta to pizza they got all things pizzeria. Check them out you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza Ive had in Las Vegas. The calzone was also off the charts.  Thought I had died and gone to New York!"}
{"text":"Average pizza and garlic knots, but really friendly wait staff. The rice ball did look very good though."}
{"text":"When you have people working in your home, I keep them happy.  How do you do that? Buy them lunch.  

Pizza is generally loved by everyone and shared easily.  We asked for suggestions and Rocco's was immediately mentioned.  It was a new place for me so I was 100% on board.  

NY style translated means huge slices you fold in half.  Rumor is they fly in their water from NY to make their dough.  I'm not sure if it makes a huge difference but their crust is definitely flavorful, crisp and perfect.  The toppings are abundant and fresh.  I love the white pizza ricotta.  I immediately found a favorite.  

Of course I have to mention the garlic knots. Buttery, tasty and more dense than other knots I've tried. Their pizza sauce is unique and nicely compliments the bread as well as any pizza.  

My only gripe would be service.  I don't expect pizza places to be held to a specific time.  I just hate to see my pizza being made and put in the oven when I arrive 40 minutes after placing the call.  The pizza is so good that I'm overlooking the flaw and will make my way back for more!"}
{"text":"I like the driver discount & the east  Coast style sausage. They even got Wise Brad chips like back home"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Las Vegas has been for the last 20 years. The RealDeal!! Delivery Dine In Take Out and Catering. Check out our newest location right across from Mandalay Bay."}
{"text":"This is officially my favorite pizza spot! If you Yelp pizza restaurants and another pizza shop that is located down the street that starts with a V pops up....don't fall for it.  Choose this place!"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for a while now and just getting around to my review.  First, let me say that I know that this place is not your super high end pizza joint, you can quite possibly find better pizza elsewhere; however for the price and quality of the food I don't think there are many better options.  The pizza slice deals are really good.  They also have several daily specials on different pastas and other items throughout the week.  I have tried 5-6 different pasta dishes, ALL of which were fantastic.  I've tried some of the deserts which I enjoyed tremendously as well.  With every desert and pasta dish that I have ordered, the portions were very large and well worth the price.  Hands down the #1 reason I would recommend this place, and the main reason I keep returning is the customer service.  So many places you go nowadays, nobody talks to you, nobody really cares; however I feel welcomed here by many members of the staff.  The young ladies who often take my order at the counter know me by name, and are very friendly.  The guy who I think is the owner/manager is awesome, always asks me how I am doing and strikes up a quick conversation.  It's not necessary that they do this, but brings a level of customer service to this place that I don't see in others.  Just recently he asked me how my new years went, and talked to me about how he relaxed with his family and whatnot.  It's friendly here which makes me feel like a valued customer.  One last thing...They usually have samples of their deserts called Zeppoles out on the counter; try them, they are delicious.  I've never had them before coming here, and I love them and have since ordered them with my lunch several times."}
{"text":"Never heard of this place, but it's pretty great. I usually stick to the small family owned pizza joints, but I had to try some as soon as I walked in. 

The staff is extremely friendly and ready to give you the best customer service possible. 

I tried the white pizza with tomato, onion and spinach and I can honestly say that this is one of my new favorite pizza places.

Love the food, the service, and the atmosphere. You have to try it!"}
{"text":"I love good pizza and this place serves good pizza. The pasta is good too. Service was good and friendly. Open till late. This place is in the same premises with Panda Express and Subway. More parking spaces in the back."}
{"text":"I'm from Bensonhurst Brooklyn. 
This pizza is as close as it gets. Looking forward to trying the rest of their menu.
 
I tried some of the other items on the menu and had to subtract two stars.
Veal Parm-I think it was veal? Reminded me of the processed meat we would get in school when we were kids. Definitely not one piece in the veal cutlet,won't order it again.
 
Eggplant Stromboli-HORRIBLE! Two bites and in the trash. Rubbery & tasteless eggplant which was way over powered by the peppers & the smoked mozzarella was not good either. The sauce that came with the Stromboli was like tomato water,not the same sauce as the pizza.

How they get the pizza right and the others so wrong is beyond me. I'll still enjoy the pizza but will stay away from the rest of the menu which is kinda depressing because I had high hopes for this place after trying the pizza the first time."}
{"text":"We had an antipasto salad and they made us a pepperoni Stromboli. Both were 5 stars. Angie was great waitress. Great choice!"}
{"text":"Sitting here now.  Ok pizza,  girl in the front was unnecessarily a b**** though.  We're the only customers in here too.  Too many other places to go to bother coming back."}
{"text":"My roommates got me hooked on this pizza. Yes it's more expensive then other chains but it's way worth the extra dollars for this good quality. I love just the simple pepperoni. Yum"}
{"text":"Came here after a concert at Mandalay it's right across the street from the casino. I was starving and ordered homemade fettuccine chicken Alfredo pasta it tasted so delicious everything was made from scratch. Service is excellent and everyone is super nice!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. We had the works pizza and the crust was perfect. We prefer thin crust and it was thin with the perfect crunch. Sauce and toppings were wonderful. Friendly service. We will be back"}
{"text":"Review is about service. I'm from NY. I walked into this place thinking \"great a somewhat normal pizza spot.\"  Maybe it is, except the woman, Raina, behind the counter is the rudest worker I have ever encountered. I've never been in an establishment that doesn't tell you where to order or who asks if you want to add a topping to a calzone. Vegas, a calzone is a cheese filled pastry. We don't add toppings to it. We dip it in sauce. We don't push people out of the way while they wait for their order. Get a clue. No matter how good or bad this product is I would never return due to this woman.  

Edit:
My calzone and white slice were put in two separate brown paper bags making them impossible to carry along with two sodas. They also tasted like warm cheesey cardboard. No."}
{"text":"Best strombolis in town! There pizza is the best New York pizza you can get in town. Super friendly staff and has plenty of seating . They also do pizza by the slice which really speeds up the process of you're just stopping for lunch."}
{"text":"My new go to spot for NY style pizza!  

I used to work in a pizzeria in NY when I was in college so I can appreciate a solid cheese pie and these guys cut it close...  Better than most in vegas.  The white slice is definitely next on my list.

Zeppoles were great and they definitely didn't hold back on the portions or powdered sugar. 

Wife got the spaghetti and meatballs...  Sauce was clearly homemade :)

Love love the Italian cookies, pizzelles and black & white cookies...  Don't see these too often

Service is consistently good. Only reason I didn't give them a 5 star is their calzones are little off. Such a staple in any pizzeria.  It's slightly prepared different from what I'm used to (almost too much dough and folded different) and when I asked for sausage they added such a sparingly amount.  

Other than that hiccup I'm still coming back for my next pizza fix and maybe try out the garlic knots!"}
{"text":"Staff was very nice and friendly! Pizza came out fast and was delicious!! It was fun to watch them flipping the pizza dough in the air as they made it!"}
{"text":"Went here last night with 5 adults and 10 kids. The staff was so helpful and kind. The food was amazing. And so inexpensive!  We will definitely be back.  OFTEN!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza. Reminds me of true New York Pizza straight from the streets. It's also very affordable with a large carry-out at only $9.99. Fed 3 of us for that. I will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite pizza! Been searching for the right pizza in the area and this is it. Boyfriend likes Joe's NY pizza but something in the crust or sauce always tasted funny to me. I think Rocco's sauce and crust are the perfect combo. Our usual is a cheese pizza and sometimes will splurge on calories for Zeppoles. So good! Wings could be better. Prices are good and pizza maintains freshness for a couple days so you don't have to throw leftovers away."}
{"text":"Echo most of the other reviews that this is the best NYC pizza in town.
It has a sweet, light sauce and great cheese.  The crust has the perfect combination of crispy and chewy.

I ordered a large pie and we ate half of it there, and brought half of it home.  Re-heated was even better, which is the standard of good NY pizza.

The staff was very polite and helpful.  Highly recommend and will return."}
{"text":"Update: I truly am addicted to this place now.... the service is impeccable and the girl, Reyna, at the front is literally here 7 days a week. She's so awesome I can't even begin to tell you!! She makes my day every time.... whoever is the boss needs to give her a RAISE!!! She's amazing. I rarely have to wait for my food ever. Everything has improved 300%... don't know why but I LOVE this little place."}
{"text":"Had two pizzas and a bag of zeppoles delivered poolside.  Pizza was awesome - served up hot with a good crunch.  Zeppoles added a nice sweet touch to the pizza. Delivery was nearly half the time they said it would take, and the driver was very friendly.  We'll order from this place again next trip!"}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp and really were impressed with the taste of the food! The service we received was exceptional. The employees were very friendly and attentive ! The prices were excellent! The portions were more than generous! We will definitely be back! I will tell everyone at home about this restaurant! MMMMMMMM!"}
{"text":"Big fan of Rocco's whether it's for Pizza, Pasta, or a little Spumoni. 

I'm not an Italian food aficionado. I dig a Mama Celeste frozen pizza almost as much as a bowl of Fettuccine Alfredo from the dearly missed Don Antonio's. So, don't quote me on authenticity, I like what tastes good, and sometimes it's flash frozen mozzarella cheese.

I've enjoyed everything I've ever eaten at Rocco's. I'd say that hands down, my favorite item on the menu is the Vodka pasta with rigatoni. Mama mia it's so freaking good. The sauce is creamy, but not too thick. You get a massively generous portion size - probably enough for 2 hungry people to split. They always give you a really good hunk of italian bread, which is critical for dipping purposes. 

They also offer pizza by the slice all the time. Pretty rare outside of a food court Sbarro at the mall (do they even have those anymore?). Pizza is thin, toppings are typically generous. Really good pizza.

If you have a little bit of a sweet tooth they have a slew of gelato options, including one of my fav's Spumoni. Not the easiest flavor to find, and it's only good once in a blue moon, but I really liked it when I had it here. I'm not sure if this is something Rocco's does themselves or if they use another company. Nonetheless, it was good. They also had several traditional flavors. 

Rocco's is pretty close to my house, and when I'm in the mood for a pasta dish it's always the first place I think of. I always call in my order and it's ready when I get there, so I'm in and out inside 2 minutes. Super convenient and the staff is always super friendly."}
{"text":"Ordered Chicken & Broccoli Fettuccine and the spaghetti & meatballs! Great food for a great price! Definitely will be back"}
{"text":"Just like being a kid again growing up in NJ.  The setup and style of pizza is one of the most authentic I have found in Las Vegas.  The tomato and mozzarella salad is on point with the perfect amount of basil.  As with most classic pizza joints, they have a selection of pizza by the slice with a few more unique options.  As with the other locations this is worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza joint in town!!!  I'm in love, honestly can't order pizza from any other place.  I tried both styles of pizza and they are both amazing, can't go wrong either way!  Ordered penne alla vodka vegetarian style and you can taste the freshly made sauce. Wow! BTW make sure to order the zeppoles, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Paid for a 24inch pizza (a pizza that I've been buying from them for a while now) but was only given a 20inch pizza that was put into a box for a 24inch pizza. Rip off"}
{"text":"Best pizza we had in Vegas, our neighbor ordered clams and he was ranting and raving about them !!!!
Service was good"}
{"text":"I had a spaghetti and meatball craving!  Decided to check out this place.  It's right down the toad from my place.  I always see it and say I should try that place!  

Drove up and parked.  Not at all what I thought!! I was thinking your typical mom and pop place.  A small restaurant with a couple of chairs no big deal.  This place was pretty nice.  

In the window I see Every Tuesday pasta's are $10 and some change!  The cashier said except for seafood.  Ok cool!!!! 

My spaghetti was so delicious!  The meatballs was soooooooo yum!!!! It was the perfect amount of seasoning!   The size was perfect!  There were a few meatballs in there.  The portion was very generous.  

I think I found my Tuesday dinner spot!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in this area. Workers are friendly and will answer any questions. 

Must try the spaghetti and meatball pizza. Sounds wierd but it's the best pizza.

A must try pizza joint"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had since moving to Vegas. I'm originally from back east and this is as close as you can get to good New York pizza. Very good garlic bread as well."}
{"text":"Come here often for pizza, they are quick and pizza's are good! they have a wide range from pizza's to pastas and their many italian desserts! Ask what their specials when you order. Staff are very friendly, ambiance is good and cleanness is great too! One of my go to places for pizza!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was very good and had a great doe. I ordered the Hawaiian pizza and a custom pizza that I was very happy with! The Hawaiian is what i recommend. Delivery was earlier than expected."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing! They're all very friendly and peronsonable. It is a bit pricey for some items, but it's worth it and understandable considering the location."}
{"text":"Oh man, this place is so good. The pizza here is top quality. The delivery is what we ordered and I got da veggie. I also ordered an eggplant parmesan. They were even nice enough to pitch in some pasta.

 I ordered delivery since it was on a Friday and it is chaotic here due to the high volume of locals and Californians for their weekly vacation. So the orders came in an hour later.

 The man that delivered the pizza got confused because I said veer on the phone but he thought he had to go to vdara, lol. The delayed wait was like a minute so it didn't really matter. Overall, he was a champ and was nice about it as was I.

 In the end, the food was extremely well made and the pizza was delicious. I won't say the best because I had better but definitely one to look out for. The prices are cheap and no hassle at all. If you hunger pizza for affordable prices, Rocco's is really good."}
{"text":"Wow! Excellent food & excellent service!
First time trying this place. I am very impressed with the customer service & quality of food. 
We tried:
Cheese pizza - it was perfect! NY thin slice just the way I like it. 

Spaghetti & meatballs- it was excellent! The meatballs were cooked to perfection, it had a lot of flavor. The sauce was perfect and the pasta was perfectly cooked. 

Staten Island cold sandwich- was ok says my husband. He gives it a 6 out of ten."}
{"text":"We stopped here on a whim and were so happy with the yummy food we got. We tried a pizza, garlic knots, and hot wings. 
Being that it was our first time, the sweet girl behind the register helped us out with every question we had about the menu. She was great! 
The pizza here had such an amazing taste, we have no leftovers! Ate it all! Hot wings were decent. Maybe would've asked for them well done for that extra bit of crisp. But we did enjoy them. Not too hot, not too mild. Garlic knots were really good! We would definitely order them again. Found out they deliver too. Looks like we'll be calling in the near future for some pizza delivery."}
{"text":"In my opinion this is the best Pizza joint in Vegas... don't get me wrong, I know nothing about \"authentic\" NY pizza, but I can tell you what I do know... this place has the best lasagne pizza I've ever put in my mouth.  I've had about 10 of their items and it's all been delicious but the lasagna pizza by the slice is by far the best.  

More importantly, the staff is always super cool.   They recognize me when I come in and they know what I want (whether that's an indication that I eat too much pizza or not, I don't care haha)"}
{"text":"I have to say I was disappointed in their fettuccine Alfredo. I had tried this same dish at the Rocco's in summerlin and absolutely loved it so when this place opened by my work I was super excited to get it. First off the sauce was so bland to the point where I couldn't even taste any salt and keep in mind Im salt sensitive when it comes to food. Then here comes the chicken that came with the dish. This chicken looked like chicken tenders that got fried then dumped into my dish with no taste either ! They definitely either have to fix this recipe or get some pointers from the summerlin location! The only plus is that the portion is big but it doesn't help when the food doesn't taste good. Hope they figure this out."}
{"text":"If i could give this place a zero, I  would. It was terrible. Honestly, 7-11 makes better pizza and wings. I cannot understand how they have such high ratings. They owe me $30!
Hard crust, tasteless sauce, dry wings...truly disgusting food."}
{"text":"I suggested this place to co-workers and they were skeptical until they took the first bite. I am not usually a fan of thin crusts but Rocco's made me a.   Most of us got a couple of different slices and a couple of people got Strombolis. The pizza was nice and light and very crunchy.  

Service was great and very friendly. The only bad part is that it was such a homerun that my coworkers will expect me to select the restaurants we go to all of the time"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! I had the White Pizza slice and I wanted more. I even added more garlic by sprinkling their garlic powder on it. My daughter had the pepperoni slice and she devoured it. Then we split and took home 12 garlic knots that were cooked to perfection and smothered in garlic pieces and and butter! If you like garlic, it's worth getting. And you could taste the freshness of the marinara sauce! Yummy"}
{"text":"Love this pizza! Super nice staff, good prices, yummy home made food!! Ill will for sure come back when Im in town!! Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Ordered chicken finger and a salad for take out. I guess they ran out of buffalo sauce or were too lazy to coat all the chicken. The cashier won't tell you your total till after you tell them if your paying cash or card. What's the difference?? Whether cash or card, the total should still be the same. The only thing I can think of as a reason is that the business is too cheap to pay for their own merchant CC fees. Food was okay, service needs work."}
{"text":"It was a let down not great super greasy the crust was not good . We got it by the slice and we got the garlic knots and they r not good either no flavor at all."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time, was skeptical but ordered an everything large pizza and cheese steak sub and meatball sub to sample. Was actually satisfied with the quality and flavor. Pizza did remind me of NYC. Would go again."}
{"text":"This place served the beeeeest pizza. I ordered a slice with mozz and sausage and had mushrooms added. Oscar was so nice about accommodating my order and was so friendly. I definitely will be recommending this place to all my local friends."}
{"text":"Back to try other items. Every time we come here the girl at the counter is so very nice!!  What I love about this restaurant is you can get pizza by the slice and they usually have at least 5 different types of pizza to choose from. I love their white pizza and we drive a distance to get it! We tried the breaded chicken cutlet sub (that includes lettuce, tomato and mayo). The bread was excellent but there wasn't enough ingredients in the sandwich so you basically tasted the bread! They sell different flavor Italian ices that are really good. The spaghetti and meatball dinner was delicious and a very good size, I wish they included a dinner salad or cup of soup with it though. The sausage, pepper and onion sub was delicious!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza...I think the best in Las Vegas if you like New York Style....The owner does such an amazing job and the manager is outstanding. I would highly recommend you give these guys a try and you will not regret it. Very friendly and great place to eat."}
{"text":"My husband and I are ALWAYS searching for great pizza. We live in California but went on vacation in Las Vegas and decided to try it out here. It was amazing and a very generous amount for a great price. You walk in and your mouth just starts to water because it smells amazing. We waited a little while and dug into our pizza. The sauce is very mild but delicious and there was a good amount of cheese. It was thin crust but that's how I like pizza! If we ever vacation here again were coming back to Rocco's!"}
{"text":"Just got here ...
Basing the 5 stars on smell alone 
I'm super excited for this pizza 
it reminds me of home in here 
Cookies are amazing staff is fun 
Amazing zeppolies
Awesome pizza
My new place"}
{"text":"Eggplant parmigiana is not an easy dish to make right. It takes time and it is easy to mess up. Italian restaurant chains in Las Vegas - who insult my heritage with the food they serve, routinely embarrass themselves when they attempt an eggplant dish. This is not the case with Rocco's and I am very happy to announce that if you are of Italian heritage and come from the New York/North Jersey area - you will want to eat here. 

The Rocco's staff challenged me by claiming their cannoli was the best. My reaction was: the best cannoli I have eaten is found in Little Italy - Bronx, NY at Gino's. They make the shells using the traditional method of wood pins - and their filling is the best.  It's been 14 years since I have been to Gino's and I will say this to Rocco's - you guys did a really great job and I will be back.

My family did try several other dishes - the fettuccine, the penne vodka, and a meatball sandwich and everyone was very, very happy. Rocco's came recommended to me from two different people. I ordered for pickup and next time I will dine in.  The place has an east coast pizza place feel that I grew up and worked in as a young guy - except they did it right and have a nice big space for the dining room. 

The last thing I need to mention is the tomato sauce, because as an Italian/American it would be a mistake not to talk about it.  Every Italian has their preference and it is usually their grandmother's. I like my sauce very salty and thin. However, Rocco's was really good, not too sweet - which drives me crazy and my family enjoyed it very much. 

Thanks Rocco's - I saved some of my eggplant for tomorrow and look forward to seeing you again."}
{"text":"My son just started singing, he wants to be the next Michal Jackson even though I told him there's only one Michal Jackson and no one can get it quite like him!!  Lets just say I'm just happy that he's singing and not getting into trouble and why not AIM HIGH?!  That's what we all should be doing, right??  Well,  now that he's singing however I have to feed the young men who are taking him under their wings and helping him fine tune his vocal instrument. Enter Rocco's Pizza, I ordered a large Hawaiian and a large sausage and mushroom and within 5 minutes, both pizzas were GONE!  $34 isn't bad for two pizzas but it looks like next time I'll need 3!! I asked if there were any deals and learned that Monday nights you can get a large cheese pizza for $9.99. If my daughter didn't have dance lessons on Monday, I would definitely consider moving the singing lessons just to get three @ $30!!  Anyhow, the crust here is nice and thin, the sauce is good, the ingredients taste fresh and I really like the type of sausage they use, it's longish like the size and shape of your thumb but not the same thickness as your thumb - that would just be gross. A solid pizza joint with a friendly girl to take your order, ring you up, answer your questions and laugh at my family's quirkiness. We all get squirrelly after work and school and when we're hungry!  Bottom line: delicious pizza and conveniently close to home!"}
{"text":"We were excited to have Rocco's move to our neighborhood but keep getting disappointed time after time. The food is awesome but unfortunately their service is so inconsistent. My first experience was awesome here as we dined in with a server. We have had numerous problems with over cooked pizza and other food. The manager did compensate us on a order when we got tired of numerous delivery orders being bad. This is going to be my last visit here. Us, as a party of four came to dine in and were sitting at the table waiting for service from a waitress since we noticed a girl delivering a pizza to the table. Um, after sitting here for 15 minutes and no one even noticing our existence I finally went up to the counter to find out you place your own order?! But, they deliver the food to your table and it's pretty bad when you do receive your food I guess they expect you to eat straight from the pizza pan because I HAD to ask for plates. They really need to get their shit together with the service here!!!"}
{"text":"!Great service and wonderful food!!! My favorite Pizza in Las Vegas! Very much like the Pizza I grew up with in New York. There Monday special is an added bonus!"}
{"text":"Had a hankering for pasta, but not pizza a couple nights ago. My wife had been to Rocco's and said it was pretty good do I figured I'd give it a shot. I asked the cashier for some descriptions and recommendations and decided to try the rotelli bolignese with the homemade garlic knots. I was blown away! It was so good that I went online to check out their full menu. Being a veal fan, I was pleased to see that they have 9 veal dishes, including veal piccata, which is my favorite. I had to make a return trip to try that and I was not disappointed. It was excellent. The entire staff is bright, cheerful and they made me feel right at home. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Quick delivery to South Point. Still hot. Great pizza. Very satisfying. Best cannoli I've ever had. Very buttery garlic knots."}
{"text":"Don't call them if it's close to closing.. They won't make your order!! 

Too bad won't see you guys again"}
{"text":"As close to good old fashioned New York pizza as you'll get out here. Everything on the menu is great! Nice selection of Italian cookies."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place in Vegas. Great meatballs and Stromboli and Pizza. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Been to this specific Rocco's a few times . Only have gotten carry out . Seems legit . Food is above average . Service above average . Have gotten calzones mostly and enjoyed them l.Will
Be back ."}
{"text":"Called in an order for pick up... got a large pie and some wings I like my wings naked, extra crispy and sauce on the side and put in a pizza box so they don't sweat... they were very accommodating, but what sealed the deal for me was that they called me back to let me know that they were taking the wings out of the fryer to ensure crispness... I go and grab a slice from time to time. So, I already know the pizza is delicious!"}
{"text":"I lived in Sumerlin for a long time and never visited that location. Now I live in Henderson and this Windmill location is close. Been there twice. Loved it both times.

The first time we went with a custom pizza. White pizza with a few added elements. Also ordered a large salad to go. Second time was a thick crust meat pizza.

Will become a regular for sure!"}
{"text":"Since we were from out of town we ate there in their dining room. After reading many of the past reviews we came here hoping to have a decent meal at a good price. It is located in a strip mall. So, I wasn't expecting too much. The food was pretty good. A little pricey considering the decor of the place. They didn't have enough tables and chairs. There were no spoons which made eating the pasta and sharing the pasta really difficult. The parking outside is a bit limited because the shopping center is so busy. I came with my family and we ordered several dishes to share. The calmari was great. The garlic knots had WAY too much oil. I might have enjoyed the pasta dishes we had a bit more if there were a way to eat the dishes better. Initially, they gave us really thin paper plates which soaked all the way through with our pasta sauce. Did I mention, they don't have any spoons? This place was super busy due to take out. So, perhaps they don't have enough staff to take care of the dining area. But, given the price of their items and the location I would hope to have a place with a couple more tables, a few more chairs and... Oh yeah, spoons."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  We pick the large pepperoni pizza at least once a week. Great selection and never disappointed"}
{"text":"I got the lobster ravioli and WOW was it SALTY. The pizza was okay to me, it doesn't beat pizza rock though. If you want killer NY style pizza, go to pizza rock, it's just down the street. Omg and BEWARE on their slices!!! I originally wanted a slice but quickly changed my mind after I seen there was a fly landing on the slices! SICK!!!! They really need to cover there slices up. At least for the safety of their customers."}
{"text":"Tried this pizza for the first time tonight!  For \"New York pizza,\" it left a lot to be desired!  It was \"runny,\" undercooked and had very little flavor.  I can name several other places in this area (Windmill and Bermuda) that serves better quality pizza than Rocco's.  Won't be going back!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice now because my doctor's office is right there. I am from the east coast and this is the closest I've gotten to a good old New York tomato pie in Vegas. The service is prompt and the entire staff is friendly. Overall my go-to spot for a decent pie and the mozzarella salad isn't so bad either!  Thanks for making me feel more at home!"}
{"text":"Best pizza choice when you're craving authentic style pizza! Don't forget the zeppoli!!"}
{"text":"Really great pizza with perfect grease!! Nice lunch spot! Ordered 4 slices & drinks & price was reasonable!"}
{"text":"The best pizza in Las Vegas, period.
If you like NY style pizza
They have 3 locations, my husband is a New Yorker, and he absolutely LOVES this pizza, you must go, my favorite location is on West Charleston, by Red Rock casino, but the one is equally as good"}
{"text":"NY PIZZA FOR SURE!!!

I miss NY after living there for a while (in Queens). Everytime I went into the city, I got a slice of pizza. After eating here, my memories of NY pizza came running back to me.

Hands down best NY pizza I've eaten outside of NY so far. I loved the lasagna pizza they just came out with. Had sausage, cottage cheese and red peppers on it. The red peppers was new on the pizza and it makes such a difference. It is sooo good. I think the proportion of cheese, sauce and toppings is what made the pizza taste excellent. I also got a combo pizza, but wasn't as good as the lasagna pizza.

The price is a litle bit more than something you'd eat in NY, but it was delicious. Highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"If your staying at Mandalay Bay and are sick of their prices (as I am) walk across the street. The place doesn't look like much, but the people are very friendly, the food is great and it is reasonably priced. Be sure and ask for a recommendation from the staff, they know what they are talking about!"}
{"text":"Our first order.  We are only down the street on Windmill. Pizza arrived cold."}
{"text":"Right across the street from the Mandalay Bay. Great pizza, great prices. A nice break from hotel prices.  You can get it by the slice - exactly like New York City."}
{"text":"Ordered a couple of Stromboli for my son and I.  It was terrible.  It was mostly a large stack of sliced ham thickly folded inside and very little of anything else.  Worst Stromboli I have ever had and I have had many.  We both threw them away.  Completely disgusting.  I post few reviews but this was so bad it compelled me to say something."}
{"text":"Chris was a super nice guy.  The pizza guy Marcos super cool.  Pizza was good Place was clean.   Several slices to choose from.  Glad this place opened"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing pies and staff. I work across the street in the Bell Dept. at Mandalay Bay and we come here all time for lunch! The guys at Rocco's even brought a couple of pizzas and some zepolis over to us for free, outta the goodness of their hearts. They did that just to say, 'Thank you' to us for patronizing them and welcoming them to this side of the strip. It was one of the nicest gestures I've seen in a long time and it reminded me that the concept of great food and great service isn't dead. 

The cold sandwiches, the hot sandwiches, the wings, the fingers, the desserts, the salads; ALL top notch. I dunno if they ship the water in from New York for the dough for the pizzas and the sandwiches, but it's amazing how these taste of the foods and the look of the place itself, reminds me of New York. And that's a great thing."}
{"text":"Wish there was something less than 1 star. Horrible customer service. I get that business might be good and I don't mind a reasonable wait, but 1 hour and 10 minutes??? That's a little extreme. 

Not only did I wait soooooo long, but the pizza was colder than Marylyn Manson's soul. Wrong toppings, wrong dinner choice. Delivery guy was cool. I tipped him well, but the fact that I had to throw the pie in the oven really blows. I love supporting small businesses but when they are ran poorly, it makes me say F it and just go the corporate way and order Pizza Hut. 

To top it off after I heat my pizza via 400° oven, 20 minutes later, I get to the cheesecake. Much to my dismay, it's frozen solid. Almost 2 hours after placing my order, I force a metal fork into a frozen piece of cheesecake. I really love cheesecake. 

I'd like to make readers aware that I am not an avid 'yelper' and truly am not writing a horrible review just because... this place actually deserves it. I called to talk to a manager, and was answered by a woman, who responded to my situation without apologizing. She blatantly told me  that all the cheesecake is delivered frozen to all customers. 

I work in a restaurant and understand that some foods need to be frozen, so they don't turn. But come on now. Thaw it a little.  All I'm saying is if you want success as a small business owner, then run it right. Also, packaged ranch for wings???? GTFOH. 

You have a good product. LEARN how to sell it. 

Happy holidays."}
{"text":"Wow! First time customer! Authentic. Hot. Fresh. Garlic Knots are fresh and yummy... Strombolis are soooo good! The fresh cucumber, tomato salad was delicious. And the cannolis ... don't miss them! What a treat! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I personally love this place I was going there before they expanded, so I've been going for a while this place is awesome from their pies to pasta as well as they're home made desserts. I'm a sucker for their lasagna plate - garlic knots or spaghetti meatball plate - house salad with dressing with a bag of cinnamon zapolies on the sideAs a father of two 3yr twins whose wife works nights this place saves- for 40.00 I can feed family for two nights easy. And I have yet to have one word to say about quality it's fresh and hot and always delicious. Thanks Rocco's"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I are obsessed with this place! Everything we try, we love! But last night we ordered the oyster linguini with red sauce was LIFE CHANGING! For the price you get a lot of pasta, I can always save enough for one or two more meals. 

Everyone should try this place! Their delivery service is always prompt and the food is always hot! We'll probably order again tonight"}
{"text":"My house is on the border of Green Valley. Every once in a while, I would visit the Costco in Summerlin. Many years ago, I decided to try Rocco's in the same shopping area. I was so blown away, that I would drive all the way from Green Valley to Summerlin just for a slice!
This is authentic NY pizza. They must import the water! They offer samples of the zeppoles, because they know how to hook you! 
The slices are HUGE, using quality ingredients. In fact, they have a shelf of imported from Italy retail items for sale. 
My favorite is pepperoni, not too spicy, loaded with perfectly melted mozzarella and fold in half into your mouth deliciousness. 
I'm so excited they have grown and expanded and now have a location near me. But, it would still be worth the 40 mile round trip drive."}
{"text":"Greatest slice in town! Friendly and fast, a taste of back home for sure. Priced fair too. We will come back."}
{"text":"The food is yummy and the owner is super friendly. Love coming here on my lunch break."}
{"text":"Horrible pizza, and we were sick after eating just 1 slice each. Ordered a large pizza and threw it away after a slice and a half were eaten, enough said."}
{"text":"Good pizza from a secluded location on windmill.
Nice selection by the slice, prices are good and you can get beer and wine. Good find for the pizza lover."}
{"text":"Hubby and I ordered 2 large cheesesteaks, not knowing they could feed a family of 4! The steak sandwich was very good. However....after living in the Philadelphia area for over 25 years, my only complaint is the beef should be shaved thinner! It makes the sandwich moister and easier to chew. We also had their hot wings. I wasn't thrilled with them, they had that slimy feeling about them. I like them crispy. We will go back, not soon, since were eating the other halves for dinner tomorrow night! Oh, and zeppoli? Meh. Go for yourselves and decide!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches are the best here but if ordering online make sure to specify everything you want on them.  There is no standard lettuce tomato and onion unless you ask."}
{"text":"Good staff, really good pies, 90 minute delivery time for 2 miles away completely unacceptable however."}
{"text":"The service at this counter-service location puts some sit-down restaurants to shame. The staff was super-friendly and super-helpful. We were surprised that two of the staff were not owners. They treated us like they owned the restaurant. On the second occasion, they comped zeppoles and garlic twists. 

The first day, we had sandwiches, pasta and pizza. I had \"Da Bronx\" which was ham, salami, capicola, provolone, lettuce, tomatoes, oil and vinegar for $8.99.  The sandwich was listed as seven inches, but it seemed longer. Generous amounts of meat (though ham predominated) on an above-average roll.  By ingredients, I wished I had the Staten Island, which had prosciutto, ham, salami, capicola, mozzarella and toppings. Very filling, you might want to share to eat a larger variety of food.

The pizza is sold by the slice, as well as by the pie.  On the first day, I pointed to a very good slice, but I cannot tell you which one it was. On the second day, I had \"Da White,\" olive oil, ricotta & mozzarella with no red sauce. That was excellent. The thin, thin crust was very crunchy, and the pizza was top-rate, if not up to New York City standards. 

The zeppoles were good hot, and there were cold free samples as well.  I had a few bites of tiramisu which was good too. 

The fountain drinks had Coke products and crushed ice. Typical quality for a non-chain fountain machine. 

Definitely recommended.  Very close to five stars."}
{"text":"Found this pizza parlor right across from the Four Seasons, and Mandalay Bay Resort. It's a short little walk, but so worth it!  I ordered the salami, pepperoni Stromboli and it was amazing.  Freshly made, staff was engaging and friendly.  Like I said, a nice little find."}
{"text":"They really deserve a single star and believe me, I'm not a hard guy to please. But this was so disappointing and because I couldn't call them after closing, I have to write. 

 This isn't the first time I've visited this particular Rocco's. This is in fact my second visit. The first time shortly after they opened and this time, tonight. Tonight, I asked for a thin crust pizza with mushrooms, sausage and green peppers. What I got completely lacked sausage, there was very little cheese and most of all, hardly any flavor.  (I wish I could upload some images) This isn't New York pizza. I have no idea what this is.  I used to live in Jersey and crossed into NY often and had pizza. This thing not only did not have sausage, it even lacked cheese. There was no spice to speak of or anything that qualifies this as pizza. I could grab a box from the frozen section at Vons and got better flavor. I won't be going back for a third attempt at making a pizza. I'll stick with Pizza My Dear, Angelino's and Dominos from here on out. NY pizza is a far richer experience than what I got from here."}
{"text":"Have been here several times and normally enjoy the food but not on this visit.  I ordered two slices and a Stromboli to go as I was hungry and needed some food on the go that was quick and easy.

I got my order and left.  When I got to where I was going, literally 5 minutes down the road, I opened the pizza box only to find my two slices over cooked, cheese brown and hard the crust like cardboard...

Two slices in the trash as they were not edible at all.

The Stromboli was also over cooked but not as bad as the dead pizza slices.  The Stromboli was edible but burnt in some spots.  

This place has always been hit and miss with the quality of service but the food was always normally pretty good.  Not sure what happened on this visit and most likely will not be back for another try.  To many NY style places in town to choose from, prefer one that takes pride in quality & service every time.  The employees should have noticed it was over cooked and taken responsibility to fix it."}
{"text":"Decent pizza and decent price especially for being on the strip. They also sell sandwiches and wings. I got pizza and some wings. 

Went with the classic pepperoni pizza and ordered regular wings. Pretty decent but nothing too special.

I like the value and friendliness of the staff!"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. All the pizzas they had out looked delicious! My boyfriend got 2 meat pizza slices and I got a veal parmigiana sandwich. The veal was good just needed more cheese and sauce . Next visit we take a whole pie to go!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick cheaper dinner tonight and was not disappointed! Pizza was excellent, ziti with meat sauce was great( only complaint on the ziti is, that it wasn't ziti it was penne but still cooked perfectly) sauce was good, bread was good, fried raviolis were excellent! I'm a Jersey girl and Italian so I know good food! Sevice was great! These guys were movin and groovin! Will be returning on our next trip to Vegas! Bellissimo!"}
{"text":"My wife is from New York and just looked at the pictures of the cheese pizza look like home so we had to go and try it. The cheese and crust was just like from New York she was very happy with it. And recommend it to anyone else that's in Las Vegas to try it."}
{"text":"Series of events that lead up to a 1 star rating:

1st - Watched the cashier handle money and then grab a slice of pizza with her hands to give to a cook. Health Department requires that you wash your hands before handling Ready To Eat Foods.

2nd - Watched a server run a slice of pizza to 3 different tables, take it back to the kitchen, then gives it to the cook who then gives it back to the cashier, who then points at me indicating that is my slice of pizza.

3rd - Noticed the cooks apron covered in hands prints of flour. He is supposed to be washing his hands in stead of wiping it on his apron.

4th - Watched a fly land on the pizza that is out in the open (with no covering or heat lamps) and told the cashier about it. She grabs the pizza looking for the critter as it zip's toward her face causing her to jump back. She puts the pizza down takes a step away and returns to pick up the pizza and asked a cook what should she do with the pizza. 

5th - Noticed all of this waiting 35 minutes for my order.

6th- The EGGplant Parmesan tasted like eggs. After further inspection of it, the egg batter is a lot thicker then the eggplant itself. The side of pasta that came with it had very little amount of sauce on it, not enough to mix into the pasta. The Chicken Parmesan and Spaghetti & Meatballs were bland at best.

Don't think I'll be eating here again!"}
{"text":"Poor quality...Cold food when it finally came.. pizza was on the smaller side and the price was outrageous for what i ordered.. the cashier doesn't tell you the price because they dont ring it up right away... just weird. Too much pizza to compete with.."}
{"text":"When Frankie's isn't open on Sunday's this is my go to spot! Delicious, gooey cheese on their supreme pizza and excellent fried ravioli! Made all 3 of my dicks hard!

Just wish they had a UNLV student special for $6 which would include 2 supreme slices and a drink! THINK ABOUT IT!"}
{"text":"If your not eating here, your missing out. I  get this pizza every Monday at work on their 9.99 large deal. The pizza quality is top notch. I am from the east coast, and this is what you would get there. Other places have the lame west coast style. Give me a piece big enough to cover my face, and I am good. Start going here. NOW!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"By all means, I am not a yelper. But this has to have been the worst dinner EVER!!! Now, the garlic knots were still amazing as always (5-stars for those) and I definitely give 5-stars for their sampling of their Zeppoles, but seriously, worse chicken piccata ever! Waaay too lemony, it definitely overpowered the flavoring! Then we ask for pasta and we get a side of penne with some tomato sauce. Smh. Just stick to you pizza making and leave the pasta to other places! Pizza I'll give you a 5 stars. But not your pasta dinners. Sorry"}
{"text":"Great little place, great location at the south end of the Strip, great food and decent prices. We had Chicken Piccata and Chicken Marsala. Both meals were really good. The meals came with a side of ziti and bread. Looks like everything is fresh made. We loved the service and atmosphere.  

The downside is no alcohol, but they are next door to a liquor store and they probably wouldn't mind if you did a byob. It's small with 8 tables. Supposedly my NY friend that ate with us said this is an authentic style NY pizza joint. 

The wife is already saying she wants to come back before we leave Vegas."}
{"text":"Well..first time here since ownership change.
Stopped for the lunch pizza special. The fine print on the door this is a student special.
Not 499 but 675 what a rip off!!
So I asked the waitress if I can substitute a salad for a slice she said absolutely not but I can give you 2 inches of salad in a cup for $4..
Well I ate the pizza-- just okay..
Next time I will drive 3 extra blocks and go to Verrazano Pizza on Windmill and Maryland Parkway
2 slice special ..slice and salad .. Or sandwiches.. more reasonable prices and the food has never disappointed me!!
SOrry ROCCOS...WILL NOT BE BACK !"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall place, very homey and food was delicious. My husband had chicken marsala and he loved it, I was simply in had a slice of pizza and salad also very good. We will definitely visit when we are in Vegas again."}
{"text":"2 slices of cheese pizza and a soda for $5? Hell yes! They also have garlic knots that are pretty good, but I wouldn't necessarily come back for them. Ranch is extra and isn't made in house which was a little bit of a bummer, but what can you do? Thin, crispy, perfectly cheesy pizza is the reason to stop by!"}
{"text":"I love this place! We usually call for delivery & the employees are always friendly!

Several times we ate at the restaurant & loved it even more! I picked up a couple of items for the house. Italian cookies and pasta.

The pizza & meatballs always a favorite ! Seasoned just perfect !"}
{"text":"worlds worst pizza

omg worlds worst

i want my money back

daily  special is only super, super thin cheese & it looks like its been on the counter a week & by the way its burnt to a crisp i bet its  been reheated a dozen times

yuck ewwwwwwwww"}
{"text":"Great Bronx style pizza nice atmosphere friendly people. I came here for lunch and God two slices and a soda for 6 bucks. Really big nice foldable New York style pizza. They had a stuffed spaghetti and meatballs Pizza that I was tempted to try but looked to be three times what I would be able to eat. Next time I go I will be sure to have room for whatever specialty pizza they have available."}
{"text":"The pizza is tremendous! One could argue that it is the best in Vegas.  Their other food entrees have been average.  Stick with the Pizza!"}
{"text":"NOT NY style pizza at all!  Crust paper thin and stale, cheese not stringy and didnt taste fresh, nothing tasted fresh just a stale piece of generic cheese pizza :("}
{"text":"Best by the slice pizza joint in Vegas, hands down.  There are many that serve the same types of pizza but none are as good as Rocco's.  We come out here a handful of times a year for business and this is one of my first stops after we get off the plane.  They serve pizza by the slice, whole pies, calzones, and numerous other items.  Give them a try!"}
{"text":"We love this NY style pizza! We're East Coast transplants and since moving here 4 years ago we've been looking for a place that can fill the pizza shaped hole in our hearts and stomachs. Rocco's fits the bill. Family owned with great service and perfectly crispy crust it is every East Coaster's dream. We've tried several kinds of pie, the Garlic knots and the desserts and haven't regretted a single bite yet."}
{"text":"Delicious!! Just like NYC! We will definitely be back. My boyfriend usually likes a thicker crust but he loved this pizza!"}
{"text":"BLUE CHEESE...PLEASE! I BEG YOU! On the strip near Mandalay Bay. Great spot for authentic NY chow. First time, I ordered a large pizza with sausage, peppers and pepperoni, a side of cucumbers, onion and tomatoes in oil and vinegar, a hot chicken cutlet sandwich and an order of wings.

Yea, I know, a lot. But that's what I do when I check out a new place. Makes for good variety and great leftovers. 

Pizza was on point. Foldable and flavorful. Cucumber mix perfect. Cutlet sandwich was instant happiness. The wings were great and I'm from where they began so I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur. In Buffalo, they are served with carrots and celery AND BLUE CHEESE. I was offered ranch. Ranch. What are we in Oklahoma? For the love of God and all things holy please...it's blue cheese. It's always been blue cheese. 

You wouldn't eat a peanut butter and mayonnaise sandwich would you? That's because it's peanut butter and jelly. 

It's wings with blue cheese.

Now if some weirdo's want ranch, let them have ranch or mayo or whatever. But for those of us who know how wings are to be served, please I beg you.

I met the owner Dennis, cousin of Rocco. Solid guy and a good sport. He patiently heard me out about my blue cheese groanings. He remained unmovable even though clearly I haven't been the only one begging. 

He's a good sport. I like him. A lot. But I'm bringing my own blue cheese next time!! Blue cheese exasperation aside, 5 stars all the way. And say hi to Kim. She's from Buffalo. She also knows it's supposed to be blue cheese!"}
{"text":"Worth the hype. Great pizza and you can order by the slice. Very fresh and hot. The prices are affordable. Recommend it."}
{"text":"Love the Brooklyn & Staten Island subs, lots of meat & cheese, great bread!  Chicken champagne is great too. My wife is crazy for the chocolate cannolis!   So happy to finally have one on this side of town!"}
{"text":"So glad that a real NY pizza shop has finally opened in my neighborhood. After a revolving door of losers came and went at this location we got Rocco's!

The pizza is perfect, thin, chewy and cheesy. Their meatball and chicken parm sandwiches are the most legit East coast sandwiches in all of Vegas. And they have killer Italian water ice as well."}
{"text":"Rocco's was the best pizza we had in Vegas and possibly ever. The crust was great to go along with fabulous toppings and a great sauce. We had the cannoli's and zeppoles for dessert and they were a great addition to the pizza. We will definitely visit Rocco's again on our next trip. The staff is great too."}
{"text":"Amazing New York style pizza.  Friendly employees and service.  If you like the pizza,  try the pasta!  Excellent taste and huge portions.  A real east coast type of place that you just don't usually see here in vegas. Oh, and they have pasta, olive oil,  and crushed red peppers  (Pastene) for sale, again, East coast stuff in the desert."}
{"text":"Hands down best NY style pizza in Vegas. If that's your kind of pizza, this place can't be beat!  I moved from the east coast about 5 years ago (first to WA, now in NV) and it took forever to find a pizza shop that reminded me of home. The slices and pies are generous portions, the prices are good, and they have Italian deli products that take me back to grandma's kitchen. Also, they aren't lying when they say they have the best cannoli in town!"}
{"text":"Right across the street from Mandalay Bay/Four Seasons.  Pizza by the slice...2 pieces of cheese pizza and a drink for under $8?  What a deal!  We stopped in for pizza, spaghetti, and baked ziti but the menu has so much more.  Delicious!  The guys working were all so kind and got our food out to us quickly.  If you're looking for fantastic NY style pizza then check out Rocco's."}
{"text":"I pass by Rocco's all the time because they are close by my favorite coffee shop. I finally decided to check them out. They have a stacked menu full of pizzas, pastas, sandwiches & desserts which is nice. I had a craving for deep fried ravioli, it was good but i felt it couldve been better with a thicker sauce. I also tried a slice of the pizza (sausage & ricotta), it tasted like a day old pizza from the fridge that was warmed up by an oven. I can only suspect that it may taste better if i ordered a whole pie but the variance of quality is too big. 

Not sure if ill be back but they do have other things on the menu."}
{"text":"If you're  closed, turn off your open sign. And what pizza place closes at 11:00pm in Las Vegas?!"}
{"text":"Great new location on the southwest side of town! 

My wife and I are constantly on the hunt for the best New York style pizza in the valley and Rocco's has become one of our new favorites! 

They have a wide variety of pizza, pasta, salads and, deserts. They use imported tomato sauces and pasta - you can taste the quality! If you just want a slice or a whole pie, make sure you check out this new Rocco's location! You won't regret it"}
{"text":"As a transplanted New Yorker, I can tell you that this place is the real deal. I'm pretty much a regular customer and everything I've tried on the menu has been just like home. The veal parm dinner.... chicken parm sandwich (fantastic bread!).... garlic knots.... pizza.... cannoli.... zeppoli.... all of it has been delicious!"}
{"text":"This is the third installment of Rocco's in Las Vegas, and is by far the best of the three. Seriously. I live a block away from the location on Aliante parkway, and I wait till I'm on the strip just to hit this new location. I drive Uber on the weekends and my stomach starts growling every time I get close to Mandalay Bay (Located across the street by the McDonalds). There open until 2am and the pizza is great!! Two slices of cheese with a medium soda runs about $8.00 and change and the slices are pretty damn big. The owner (I think he's the owner...he always there) is very cool. If you dine in, they bring the food out to you, hot and tasty. They have a good selection of pizza and you can get it by the slice or a whole pie. They have other items on the menu (Stromboli, Calzones, Salads, and several dessert choices. There's more on the menu, but I can't remember it all now)."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service!! Fresh ingredients and super fun people! Had garlic knots, pizza and chicken fettuccine Alfredo. Love the pizza crust!! Thanks for the Zapelle's (sp) those were a perfect cap to the meal. Doesn't have a gluten free option, so gotta go with only 4 stars here. I will be back for more!!"}
{"text":"What a huge disappointment, today.  I ordered a pizza, for my friend, and I, asked for it to be cooked extra crispy, with 2 bottles of water.  It was $16.21.  I happily gave the young lady at the counter a $20, and told her to keep the change.

What I got was a soggy pizza, excuses, and attitude.  First the girl said it was because of the rush, they were busy, and the cook had so many tickets.  I wasn't rushing them.  If I want fast, I'll go elsewhere. Then I was told the pizza was crispy, like I ordered, even though it was limp like Hugh Hefner without his Viagra.  Then I'm told in the future, I should order it well done, but ask them to cook it longer when it doesn't arrive as ordered.  I said extra crispy, she said the ticket said crispy,   Then she returned to tell me my pizza was crispy, although it looked exactly like the pizza at the next table.  Not crispy. Either someone here doesn't understand English, or how to listen effectively.  Anyone can make a mistake, but just admit it was wrong, and apologize.  My friend finally had to tell the girl who delivered the pizza to just go away.  They didn't get the order right, yet she tells me I'm wrong?  No thank you.

I've been patronizing Rocco's for years at the West Charleston location.  This store is obviously too big for their britches, makes too much money, and doesn't care about doing the right thing by their customers. 

Sorry neighbors.  You've lost my trust, and my business.  I'll go to Blaze where the understand what the words \"extra crispy.\"  Rocco's can keep their doughy pizza, bad attitude, and bad service."}
{"text":"The staff at Rocco's is way too nice. It really takes away from the \"NY Pizza Experience.\" The pizza is an excellent representation of the classic NY pizza. The customer service is over-the-top exceptional--a totally inaccruate representation of the classic NY pizza restaurant.

Oh, by the way, at the Mandalay Bay for vacation or a conference? Get off your arse and walk across the street to eat here instead of dropping over $8 for a slice of meh at the Mandalay Bay food court served by people who don't care if you come back. Rocco's is better, cheaper, and they care about your business.

Garlic knots...2 garlicky thumbs up."}
{"text":"For the last few years, we've been ordering pizza from Rocco's and always really enjoyed it. Pasta dishes are tasty, but overpriced. Garlic knots are a little oily, but good. In the last year or so, my hubby and I have become vegan and they do not offer vegan cheese, so we now order elsewhere for our pizza, which is a bummer. Rocco's was our fave for pie ;) Time to jump on that bandwagon and offer vegan cheese??"}
{"text":"Rocco's doesn't serve the best pizza in Vegas, but it's without question the Vegas valley's most authentic recreation of what you can get in New York and New Jersey. Thin, floppy, foldable slices from which golden-tinted grease drips onto your plate while the heel of the crust flakes and cracks just a little when you bite into it. Like I said, legit.

Lunch special is two slices of plain and a drink for $5.50.

Mondays you can take out a large pie for $9.99.

It's a regular part of my rotation."}
{"text":"We are usually buying Extra Large Pizza here, and today the 24\" inches Pizza is like Large and we have to go back there for nothing because their explanation is they are selling 20\" only in the 24\" boxes. Wow!"}
{"text":"This is great ny style pizza. I love the chewy crust and cheese. Just a great slice. The sides aren't bad too. Makes for great takeout and fills us all up. I will come back again and again for sure. I love gluten and this hits the spot...pizza as it should be made..."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure about trying the pizza here because I'm more of a Chicago style than New York, and as a vegetarian I'm pretty picky about my toppings. All we got was a large cheese pizza. And it blew. Me. Away!!!  It was sooooooo rich and cheesy and I was extremely impressed. I have also had the eggplant Parmesan sub, which was so full of flavors I ate the entire thing (and it's a large portion). Definitely a great spot!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered ahead of time.  My daughter ordered Sicilian Pizza. I ordered Afredo with chicken and Brockley with a side order of chicken wings.  The Afredo sauce was clumpy, it was to thick with corn starch, did not taste like afredo at all,  the brockley was hard, the only good thing was the chicken. It was tender.  When we got there and discovered my daughter had ordered the wrong pizza, we were told they could compliment us 2 free slices of pizza, but we had to pay for the pizza we did not want.  The chicken wings was dry, and over cooked.  No one in the restaurant was anyway remotely Italian.  The pizza was horrible and definitely not new York pizza.  I will never eat here again. $50.00 down the drain, I should have went to olive garden."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! Amazing customer service 
This is one of the best Pizza places I've been too
Thanks for being too Good. Amen"}
{"text":"\"Many shops claim the title, \"New York Pizza.\" But you can't fool New Yorkers when it comes to pizza. I tried em all and was disappointed every time until I found the real deal ---- Rocco's New York! 

The second I opened the door, my nose recognized that so familiar scent and when I got to the counter and saw the color, I instantly knew my search was over.

The color was exactly as I remembered, a very light red with the melted cheese surfacing lightly like spots on a Dalmatian so to speak. The sauce, not over bearing with the correct sweetness and finally the crust, the perfect texture and crispness on the rim. For the crust, it must be New York City water. Who knows there may still be miles of aqua ducts built from oak planks which makes the crust so unique. Everything about this place shouts Manhattan! One last comment -- even Yogi would agree!\" ---- Fast Eddie Turgeon"}
{"text":"Never again. They been across the street for me now for a couple of years it's always been a decent place to go and get pizza but after tonight I will never go back. I called 5 o'clock they said it would be ready by 530 at 5:50 they finally handed me my pie. By the time I drove home which is across the street the pizza was ice cold. It tasted like one they had sitting around all day. Sorry can't ever come back"}
{"text":"This Roccos is owned by the original Rocco. He also owns the one on Charleston. Gotta say these have been the best pizza places to go to in Vegas, especially if you're craving food like it's from New York"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in town. Always great ingredients and the staff is awesome"}
{"text":"This pizza is the best and the service is super duper awesome!

The gal at the front explained what some of the foods were because we weren't familiar with Canolli's for example. She gave us her honest opinion and gave us some recommendations. Every staff member that walked by smiled and checked in with us. Loved the experience, the fresh pizza, the fresh sauce, I can't say enough. I'll be back every time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Now, normally I love Rocco's! They've been consistent all of the years, I used to go to the original location on Buffalo (I believe that was the first one) their pasta dishes are quick to go meals and a generous portion. Also their pizza is pretty good as well, I normally opt for pasta. Sandwiches are good, especially the grilled one on garlic bread I think it's the Manhattan. Their baked ziti is a close second to my moms. But, after our recent takeout order it left me second guessing my favorite to go Italian restaurant. I ordered a chicken cutlet sandwich and there was no lettuce or tomato and only half of the sandwich had mayo. The chicken was extremely dry and seemed like it had probably been sitting for hours or from the previous day and was microwaved, though the chicken was like warm, totally bummed me out. A sandwich with dry breaded chicken and half mayo, come on now.. that's not a sandwich you want to eat. I barely ate any. My fiancé got a chicken parm sandwich which is normally quite good, and again the chicken was dry and chewy. Very disappointing trip to Rocco's and will have me second guessing a return next time. Though let me state this is the only bad experience I've had at this location but it was very disappointing, a waste of a 20 dollar bill. If you try this place out, try the pastas it's always been great. I may update my review in the future but 3 stars for now, because I can't believe they messed up a simple sandwich."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why I waited to write this review, but we have been waiting for a Rocco's to open I this side of town for years. Rocco's partner Dennis is a great guy and treats us like family every time go go in.  I love the pizza 
and the rice balls and they have the best calzone I've had since I moved here from New York 16-years ago!! Monday night is pizza night in our house since a large pie is only 9.99!!  We have been eating here twice a week and are so happy to be art of the Rocco's family!!"}
{"text":"We randomly stopped here on our way home from Vegas. It was our cheat meal and we love pizza. This place did not disappoint! The slices were huge, I loved the white pie with ricotta and we also got their cannolis which are homemade as soooooo delicious!!!! Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This place is hidden and crazy good.  The sit down area is entertaining and perfect for families."}
{"text":"UBER HAPPY! I was pleasantly surprised and very happy with the Service and Taste of my pizza, not to mention a Discount for mentioning I am an Uber Driver! 
Thank you Rocco's!!"}
{"text":"Holy crackamoly. 
My go to pizza in Vegas is Secret Pizza. I absolutely LOVE their crust and the thickness of their crust.

I happened to be in the area waiting on my dance class, and did a quick stop by for dinner. I was soooo skeptical of pizza here and had one slice, which BLEW ME AWAY. I went back and got another slice. Yeah, it was THAT good.

The crust is delicious! I give this place a solid 9.5/10 for pizza ranking. The dough is good. Awesome service, too!

I did not like the lasagne pizza at all in comparison to the pepperoni/sausage. It's a must try!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome pizza; super close to real NY pizza! Tried the pizza here and was not disappointed.  From the moment we walked through the door we were pleased. The girl in the front was very friendly, the pizza came out delicious!  They have puzza specials on Monday and Tuesday.  I can't wait to go try their chicken francese since i haven't had it since leaving NY!"}
{"text":"Horrible pizza. So thin I felt like I was eating a cracker. Dry as a bone. Hardly any sauce or cheese. Asked for some extra sauce and a ranch to dip the pizza in cause it was so dry and was charged an extra $2.76 for it. Ordered medium chicken wings and they came our drenched in hot sauce. Will never go back to this location again."}
{"text":"Amazing NY style pizza.  Really just like back home.  We are so excited to find this place and this is our official go-to pizza joint from now on.  

We've been here a few times and have tried multiple items on the menu:  Zeppoles are great.  Wings are ok.  I didn't really care too much for my Calzone - I thought the ricotta was under-seasoned and their was too much extra bread on the ends, but I'm pretty particular about my calzones.  The garlic knots are good but a little too large and bready for my taste.

They also have 2 options for subs, 7\" and 15\".  I ordered a 15\" steak sandwich and when I picked it up, I saw it was in 2 separate packages.  Ok, I thought they'd cut it in half and that was just how they packaged it.  To my surprise, they had actually just made 2 separate 7\" subs.  I don't know if they were out of the 15\" sub bread or what, but I thought that was a little ridiculous.  The sub itself was ok.

Once in a while when I've called to place an order a younger male answers the phone and he's always pretty rude - just has no manners at all and can't wait to get you off the phone.  I'm used to pizza guys being short and rushed on the phone because they're busy or doing other things, but this kid for some reason always manages to be rude (ESPECIALLY when they're not busy)."}
{"text":"Is this place under new ownership?  Or they just got super cheap?  Ugh.  I don't know.  This place used to be my east coast Haven.  It reminded me of the days I spent folding my pizza and wiping grease off of my face.  

But.... The taste was never the problem.. And still isn't the problem

It was the service..... I paid for the 5 for two slices and drink deal the first time and my son loved it so much that I had to get another two slices(which he didn't finish dammit) and when I asked for the second drink he pointed at the cup I already had and said that I already had one.  

Then I asked for marinara sauce for the pizza and he said it was 85 cents... Which is fine but I just got four slices of pizza.  Throw a bitch a bone.  Damn.  

And then when it came time to leave I asked for a box and he gave me a bag and a plate. 

Unfortunately.  I still want pizza.... So I'll end up going back but not as much as I used to."}
