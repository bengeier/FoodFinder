{"text":"In Scottsdale for Spring Training and happened upon The Goodwood Tavern. Super friendly staff and really excellent food. Highly recommend this great place."}
{"text":"It's a friendly place with a good Happy Hour.  We stopped by on 7/3 and were pleasantly surprised by the number of people there.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed a few beers.  The appetizers we tried were both good and my wife had their fish dinner.  While it wasn't great, it was okay for the price.    The bar staff were hospitable and we enjoyed watching the hourglass drain as Happy Hour waned.  The music was there but not overwhelming.  Conversation was possible.  It's a nice alternative to other bars in the area."}
{"text":"This place is great.  A big difference from the Old Town Scene.  Place is run by real people and full of real people.  They even have one of my favorite bourbons, WELLER!!  Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"I came here to watch the Cardinals game. We sat at a booth and no one greeted us or came over to take our order. I had to walk up to the bar to find out we needed to order there. It was a pain to get up and stand at the bar to get food and drinks. The mac & cheese was pretty bad especially for the amount they served for the price, so I had it returned and they did take it off the bill.  This establishment needs to improve there serving system. Overall however the atmosphere was nice and draws a younger college crowd."}
{"text":"Completely ridiculous and unprofessional bar, to the max. We had a large group of people, more than 7 in total. Couldn't get a single drink except to wait 5+ minutes at the bar, usually more than 10 minutes throughout the night. To be clear, the place was NOT crowded. The bartenders ended up losing the card I opened a tab with by giving it to someone else. I have the cc  statement and lack of my signature on the receipt to prove it. Instead of being apologetic and attempting to help, the bartender wrote down a phone number on a sticky note and told me to call him in the morning when I remember where my cars is.   Are you kidding me???? I know where my card ISN'T, and that's my wallet, because they gave it to someone else. If they would just have owned up to it, I wouldn't be so upset. Now I'm pissed. The service was terrible in the first place, and this just takes the cake."}
{"text":"This place doesn't have air conditioning and has awful service. Just go somewhere else. You'll be sweaty and sober because you won't be able to get a drink... even without a crowd."}
{"text":"Went in Friday for drinks and some food. Had Mules with a grilled chicken sandwich and fried pickles. The food was outstanding and I was pleasantly surprised with the service. Ixchel served us and she was awesome. We didn't have to wait for anything which is more than I can say about some other places nearby! I will definitely be coming back in the future."}
{"text":"What a great corner bar. Good selection of liquor, great bar food. Had the burger and buffalo chicken dumplings. The bartenders RB and Josh were awesome. If you want to avoid the BS of old town this is the place!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The service isn't the best nor consistent, but I still like coming here for the darts, pool, basketball etc... Best part about this place is their food! Seriously have some of the best bar food in Old Town... And the nachos?? Probably the best I've ever had...as well as some friends that I took here to try.. They say the same thing.. I make it a point to try nachos everywhere I go and these are on another level. You will not be disappointed.. Great chill bar.... Love the outdoor seating option. Women's bathroom does have a pretty nasty odor in it but... It's not a deal breaker for me  4 stars is for the lack of consistent good service... The service really does need some work... Being a server in old town myself, it is lacking.. Even on slow nights.."}
{"text":"Not a worthy replacement for its predecessor. Poor service. No originality, atmosphere or personality. Very run of the mill drink offerings."}
{"text":"I came here a couple weeks ago and really enjoyed the games they offer to play but the service is just horrible. The first time I came I was excited that they had pool, a basketball game and just a fun vibe so we came back to eat. I am really not one to complain but I just sat there for 10 min while the server smiled at us and ignored us. As much as we wanted to call out and ask for service I don't think that is my job when she clearly saw us. If you are not in a hurry, want to play games and wait to drink come here."}
{"text":"One of the bartenders who was also our server was not very friendly. We had purchased a groupon for this location and she was very rude about applying it and did not even apply it for the correct amount. When we asked another server to help us with applying it correctly our original server ( I think her name was Olivia) came back and very Rudely said to us that she had already told us how it worked and that she had applied it correctly. However, the other waitress was so sweet and the food was decent."}
{"text":"At first glance this place seems charming, but that's where the charm stops. Inside you'll find an inattentive wait staff, and rude management. If you are in this area you have multiple bars to choose from, and going to this abysmal establishment would be a very poor decision. For a fun night out be sure to avoid this business at all costs. Cheers."}
{"text":"Great place. Relaxed. Fun. Great staff. Great drinks. Food looks awesome too. Bravo!!"}
{"text":"We wandered in here during happy hour and had some snacks and drinks. The service was good and the food and drinks were great as well. The decor is beautiful.  It looked like the place was more happening later in the evening."}
{"text":"The dark haired bartender had the personality of a doorknob tonight. It appeared as if I was bothering her by ordering a Bud Light and her having to put her precious hands in a cooler to get it for me. She never offered a smile, a menu or anything other than robotic yes or no answers.    Also, they had all the heaters blasting outside on a 60 degree night. This bar has just given up - they are not in touch with anything, still have the same lame menu and staff that is from the \"Night of the Living Dead\""}
{"text":"Fun place, great entertainment and environment.  Loved our bartender. Enjoyed the variety of music."}
{"text":"I love their BLT sandwich. It's filling and really good bacon! Comes with fries. Very filling meal!"}
{"text":"Let's just put it out there: Scottsdale is bougie. They're not Bel-Air bougie, but they have a certain class to them that everyone knows about. Therefore, it's difficult to find a spot that's low key and you can just chill out at. Luckily, my friend and I found Goodwood thanks to a friendly security guard at another bar.  The weather was beautiful so my friend and I were able to grab a table out on the patio and enjoy drinks for the night. The bartenders aren't really that attentive, and I could definitely see what all these reviews are talking about in regards to curtness. They're not the friendliest bunch, but I got my drinks and didn't really have to spend time up at the bar so I didn't care.  The bar itself is really neat. It's a calmer, more casual vibe compared to its surrounding bars and lounges. I felt comfortable in my leggings and top combo. There was a nice mix of young professionals hanging out, as well as a few dressier folks because of a bachelor party. My friend and I enjoyed being able to sit and talk and enjoy our time without being bothered or concerned for the other people in the area.  Goodwood had exactly what I needed, but I think that if I needed more care or desired more interaction this wouldn't be the place for me. Considering all there is to do in Scottsdale, I don't foresee myself ever visiting again, but it got the job done."}
{"text":"Wandered in here on a Friday evening. So glad I did! They had the basketball game on so my guy was happy. The crowd was good and it wasn't too loud.  They have a set of darts in the corner that is only 50 cents for 2 to play to 501!"}
{"text":"I honestly have so much to say about this place. We've been there twice.   First, we went here before the Joe Nichols concert last month not expecting much. The service was slow, but the bartenders were friendly, the drinks were great, and the food was delish.  Then on NYE we were chasing some friends around the club district and had had QUITE enough, when I realized I left my ID back at the hotel. We jumped on a cart and on the way back saw the Goodwood when we remembered how good the food and drinks were. We walked in, cash ready, when the bouncers gave us a friendly smiled and ushered us in. The tables were covered in NYE hats, noise makers, and fun stuff. Everyone was dancing and smiling. People were running around with cowbells. It was like a scene out of a movie. I went to sit in the booth, but my bf said \"no way that isn't reserved.\" I bet him $5 and sat down. Sure enough another couple came in and pointed to the booth across the way. The friendly bartender I recognized from our prior visit smiled and ushered the couple to the booth letting them know they could sit wherever, order food from the bar and have a great time.   We proceeded to order drinks, dance, and have an AMAZING time until the ball drop. They passed out champagne to everyone, people ran around cheersing and hugging like they had been friends for years. We ordered half the menu and ate like our lives depended on it, and left as the bar closed.   We will definitely start frequenting this place and are so grateful we found a friendly, welcoming and downright AMAZING place to ring in the new year."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's better to embrace how shitty your staff and menu is. Also, when your TVs are down, I wouldn't recommend talking down to your customers because it \"isn't your problem\". How embarrassing to sit there and watch."}
{"text":"Where do I even start, I love Goodwood!!! This isn't your typical old town bar and I'm glad to see it doing so well. There is a pool table, darts and a few other games to play while enjoying good music, sports games on tv and a damn good drink. While most bars are known for the drinks and atmosphere they lack good food, this is not the case for The Goodwood. The food here is crazy good, the staff will help you make the best choices based on what you like to eat and I promise you will enjoy it.   Everything is awesome at Goodwood but the best part about this place is their ownership and staff. You will see a lot of familiar faces from the old Lodge staff and that should say it all, they are ye best in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Saturday visit with a large group of friends to watch a few games.  Good crowd but not overcrowded however the two bartenders were struggling to keeps up with orders, either someone didn't show up or they underestimated the weekend crowd.  Despite that both bartenders were friendly and taking care of the patrons as best they could.  Once the lunch bell rang the kitchen was pouring out food at a good pace, we ordered the chicken nachos which featured seasoned chicken with what I would guess to be taco seasoning which added a nice twist, a second order was placed as the first one was devoured quickly (party of 8).  Looking forward to next weekend."}
{"text":"Went in last night (Saturday) around 12:45, sat at the bar for 15 minutes with no service. Watched as the bartender's went in circles, looking at me and my friend, making eye contact, and ignoring us. Just wanted one drink after work, that's it. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I have never been to such an unprofessional establishment.  My wife and I were visiting and wanted to check out the local bar scene.  The bartenders ignored us while we waited at the bar.  It seemed as if they were only interested in chugging the drinks they had made for themselves behind the bar.  Then after waiting for 5 minutes for them to finish drinking behind the bar they skipped over us and went to the only gentleman who was flashing cash.  I am sorry Goodwood Tavern, I only use debit card.  Do not waster your time going here, unless you want your bartender to be drunker then you are."}
{"text":"Great Art Deco inspired bar in Old Town Scottsdale to grab a drink and sit on the patio.  We enjoyed an order of pretzels too and really enjoyed them.  Friendly bartenders and love that the patio is pet friendly too - bonus!"}
{"text":"Oxidized guacamole on the nachos, however, the cook came out to check on satisfaction: great job kitchen. Fantastic presentation too."}
{"text":"I have to admit, I was a little tipsy while taking pictures of this joint! Please forgive my blurry pics!  Nonetheless, hopefully the description that I am about to give you will take you on our Saturday night adventure!  The bar was filled with fun outgoing people getting their dance on!  It's great to see the crowd joining in the 90's party theme with sideways sports caps worn and overalls!  Ahhh,  the memories.  The music helps bring me back to my high school years!  Oops!  Did I just date myself?!! The bar is centered in place and the lines to get drinks weren't too bad.  By this point, I was feeling a bit to wavy and decided on a soda as my hubby tried to convince me to take another shot!"}
{"text":"Angry spicy chicken sandwich, I ate halfway through chicken after realizing I'm chewing pure moosh. I take a look at it to realize the entire middle of the chicken is uncooked and raw. I called and the gentleman offered to take care of my drinks the next time. Wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Sunday fun day as we were walking.......YES!!!!  A bar that doesn't play hip hop or techno!!   We came in and hung out with the bartender as he was opening for the day. The sunday bartender kicked ass!!  We also had the BEST nacho's I've ever eaten in my life....some gourmet nachos.  Staff gets a perfect 10, super friendly and fun!   I'd come back again!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with this place. Servers were rude and the vibe was so so. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and that was good. It came with sweet potato fried and they were really good. They came with this weird cinnamon sauce on the side. I ordered ranch instead it was a good move. We just came here for dinner and left, so I wouldn't really recommend. There are tons of other good places to eat in the area."}
{"text":"This is such a step up from Shotgun Betty's. Came in to grab a beer after work. It feels like a completely different place. I was really excited to see such a nice change."}
{"text":"There was Coolio on the juke which was pretty fitting since GoodWood is a gamesters paradise. They've got pool, darts, buck hunter and of course the best bar game ever created, Pop-a-shot. We probably put more money in that thing than we scored points, but damn it was a good time.   Service was really nice and the crowd pretty lively. Only negative is that second hand smoke pretty intensely blows in the bar from the patio, but besides that this is a fun bar to drink at while enjoying a little friendly competition."}
{"text":"Great place to start before or if need a break from the entertainment district. Food is excellent, drinks are good and reasonable, and the bartender Echelle is the best. Good place to smoke a cigar, shoot some pool or baskets, or watch a game."}
{"text":"Not sure what the bug up everyone's butt is. I've only been here once, but there was great service, no line to get in and the bartenders were a lot of fun. I didn't eat or use the bathroom, but I definitely didn't have to wait around for a drink..and boy howdy did they poor a good few! I will come back for sure. Also liked that they had games instead of just music you can't hear yourself think over. I've been here several times now and always been pleased with the cleanliness and attentiveness of the associates."}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick beer and a bite. 2pm and the cook us not in...okay? I will walk 2 doors down. 2nd biggest football day of the year and the cook is not in, hmmm."}
{"text":"Based purely on the couple cocktails I've tried and couple of their small bites ... I will be back.  I have been back... A few times! Wow ... The James Woods is my fave drink here.  Its just so tasty.  And the pretzels... my friends rave about those pretzels! There's usually a good crowd here, without being too many people... Music is good, bartenders know what they're doing.  Price is moderate, but comparable to any decent bar making a quality cocktail.  There are tvs, and there's a dart board if you're into keeping your hands busy while drinking.  ;-)"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in here on a Saturday night with friends. Love the remodel!! We decided to order some food and ordered the mac & cheese and a side of tots. Mac and cheese was awesome and the tots....cooked perfectly!!! The bartenders were so friendly and great service! We will certainly be back again and to try more food!!!"}
{"text":"Rude is the only word I have for this place. It was a Wednesday night around 11, so it was not busy at all. The bartender was blatantly and purposely inattentive. It took almost 10 minutes to get a drink. I wasn't alone in my sentiments about the service. Two other customers started arguing with the bartender and had to be escorted out. I presume this place will close just like Shotgun Betty's which was previously in this space. The only thing worth going here for is the pop a shot and some video games. I recommend going elsewhere. This place is very low class."}
{"text":"Pub I liked and would be cool when more people are there. 3.5 stars.  Highlights:  - Bourbon mule: using Tin Cup bourbon it was delicious (and I'm picky about my mules). 4 stars - Bartender: super honest saying they have a drink list but probably don't have everything they need to make them. When he poured the last of a bottle he charged me less which was nice. - Cheese curds: we never get these in California so had to order them. Solid version with slightly sweet breaking. A great late night snack. 4 stars - Some outdoor bar seating  Lowlights: - Bit dead when we were there--it was later on a Sunday night but before the big game.  I'd come back for more curds and drinks."}
{"text":"Chill spot with good drinks and staff in the heart of Old Town. Has a vibe like The Lodge a few years back."}
{"text":"After a day long adventure to the Grand Canyon and back, my boyfriend and I NEEDED a drink so we stopped at Social Tap. They graciously served us a drink before closing (thank you Garret and Joe) and directed us to another location where we might enjoy the rest of our evening: GoodWood. They highly recommended Marcus and we were not disappointed! Our evening was marvelous with great drinks and fun, offbeat conversation with lovely repartee! We look forward to visiting the next time we are in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I just got their food from uber eats! It was so good! The sauce with the sweet potato fries was amazing!  Definitely going to order it again"}
{"text":"A few of us came over after work because a good burger was needed! We didn't stop with burgers! We made our way through some buffalo chicken dumplings, tater tots, french fries and fried pickles! We knew the food would be good and Goodwood did not disappoint. Can't wait to get back to try more! Friendly service, great atmosphere and great food! We love that it is right around the corner from our office. Great work!"}
{"text":"Had a great time and a great meal tonight. Wings were awesome, chicken sandwich was delicious. Cool atmosphere! We will be back."}
{"text":"Love good wood. It's the best spot for happy hour. Grab a glass of wine with a co worker or friends. They also have great appetizers! This place is a staple for old town!"}
{"text":"Mac n cheese was good a bit salty though. The spicy chicken wrap and fries were delicious!!"}
{"text":"Came here for Happy Hour and a good bye party. My manager paid for everything. :D   Shots all around. Fireball!   Yelpers give this place some lovin. They need to biz. When we went the place was not even full."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour on Friday around 530/6 PM. The bartender was super nice & let me sample 2 of the beers. We got the nachos for $7 (+ $3 for added chicken) so $10 for nachos at happy hour.. I don't think this is a very good deal. & they were no where nearly as big as nachos elsewhere..But the chicken on it was pretty good. For a comparison: When I go to Zipps for happy hour nachos are $5. Also the place had a weird smell to it.. Like spilled/old alcohol from the night before. I probably would not come back here. Also, its very tiny, but is in a great location."}
{"text":"The worst bar I have ever been to in my life. Drinks were subpar and overpriced and so was the food. What really tanked the experience though: the staff and owner. They were extremely rude. Not only is this bar disorganized, but they blame the disorganization on the patrons. There are tons of bars in Old Town, and all of those bars deserve your business more than Goodwood. Seriously, don't waste time or money."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday during a pub crawl. It was my first time being here since it was called \"Shotgun Betty's\". Wasn't greeted when I walked in the door. Sat down at a table along the wall and quickly realized that there was just 1 bartender and no one else, so I had to walk up to the bar and grab a couple drinks. Nothing special about this place, bland atmosphere and no customer service that really goes above and beyond.   Just O.K."}
{"text":"Pretty empty when we went. Dark and a bit unfriendly. I think they were setting up for later in the day. But we should still get some attention. So we had a beer and vamoosed. My friend says the pretzels are good. Maybe I will try again and order something...."}
{"text":"Nice that it's a little different from most of the places in old town , and doesn't tend to get as crowded or loud, but I won't be returning. The service has sucked a few times we went (super slow or nonexistent). One time we left because I waited so long and didn't even get a drink. I've had issues with the manager as well as some of the staff being unfriendly and rude. There's places that are much busier and still maintain friendlier staff and better service in the same area."}
{"text":"In town for the weekend and stopped here for a bite to eat... great burgers and fries! Would definitely recommend this place to friends! Loud atmosphere and great drinks!"}
{"text":"My crew stumbled into the Goodwood Tavern to get food and some drinks. We went around midnight and the bar was decently filled. The bartenders seemed frustrated and had quite an attitude when trying to get their attention. The female blonde bartender was definitely more attentive than her coworker. The gentleman was talking to a customer he knew for quite awhile while numerous people wanted to order.  When we ordered we got Jameson Ginger, Captain & Coke, A Western BBQ Burger + Fries, The Buffalo Chicken Dumplings, Two Shots, and Two Bud Lights and our tab was $50. Super affordable here, especially when comparing to Los Angeles.   The burger stole the entire show! Burger was tender, melted cheese that was phenomenal, and the onion ring was freshly fried and had a light crust. The bacon was dripping in phenomenal seasoning and bbq sauce! The buns were also quality and was held together. Highly recommend their Western BBQ Burger! 5/5 for sure.  The buffalo chicken dumplings were a spicy treat! The only complaint I can make is that it is dripping and soaked in ranch dressing, so it made the dumplings a bit soggy, but the flavor and chicken was delicious 3/5.  Overall, a good tavern/pub, has $1 pool table/game, two dart stations, and a basketball ball shooting game. The drinks are perfectly poured where it isn't too overpowered by alcohol or too underpoured. The burger stole the show! Definitely would be down to come back!"}
{"text":"This here is your solid \"everyman's\" bar. It's not dive-y or clubby. It's got a nice pool table, darts, the fried pickles are bomb AF.  But most importantly, they're a VIKINGS BAR.  Every fall, I go here to watch my favorite sports ball team break my heart year after year.   The team is great, very attentive behind the bar.  Good selection of bar food and any drink you could hope for."}
{"text":"Great place for late night food and drinks.  Feels like a down-home place with a local vibe!  I would recommend this place to escape the party scene in the local area.  I believe the bartenders name was josh,  very knowledgable and informative on where to go and what to do!  Thanks see you guys again"}
{"text":"Goodbye Shotgun's, hello Goodwood! The pork belly sandwich was a celebration of Korean infusion and absolutely delicious! I'm looking forward to seeing the patio transformation since it's still reminiscent of Shotguns. The bartender Katie was fabulous and I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Will not be coming back to this place. The bartender must be drunk or delusional. I paid my tab and started to leave. Then I was approached two minutes after paying my tab by the same bartender. She said I needed to pay my tab, I replied by saying I just paid two minutes ago. She didn't remember swiping my card and me tipping her, there wasn't a lot of people in there so I don't know how she could get confused. She instantly blew up and started cursing me out. It turned into a scene. I offered to pay again just to keep everything calm but she would do nothing but curse at me. I work in the industry also, I know that's not how you should treat someone and I always remember my guests."}
{"text":"Please note that the address listed on Yelp is incorrect! The correct address  is 7330 E Stetson in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Bran new to the old town area. Came for a beer after work. Service was fast and friendly. Got to try the buffalo dumplings that were some of the dopest dope I've ever smoked. Looking forward to trying some of the other HH specials."}
{"text":"Best service, best crowd, best food, most original drinks!   Atmosphere can't be beat. Check this place out and you won't be disappointed.   Go Giants!"}
{"text":"Music was good. Was greeted and got a drink but the drink tasted as if there was only margarita mix in it and the bartender never came to check on me or ask if I wanted another drink and it was not busy."}
{"text":"It's really the Lodge and everybody knows it, better then Shotgun Crappys that was there before."}
{"text":"Great service even though it was packed. Great drinks. Had the nachos which were great. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"New place....food is awesome! Service was excellent and the quality and food value is outstanding. Snyder and Katie I want to especially call out! Go there for Friday night fish! Menus is simple but quality! !!!!! Good vibe!   Try it!"}
{"text":"Great plave for beer, sports and a good starter or half time place, if pulling an all dayer."}
{"text":"Cool place to chill for a night out or weekend day! It's way more relaxed vibe than all the other bars in old town. The bartenders are pretty fast and they know how to keep you entertained! I recommend going here before your night out or after your dinner date! Make sure to try a pine mind!"}
{"text":"I don't know why more bars don't understand this. You can be terrible at all the things (music, service, making drinks, being hospitable), but if you put a Pop-A-Shot in a corner, my idiot friends and I will stay there all night and probably spend at least $100 trying to top each others' scores.  Luckily for Goodwood (strong name, by the way), they don't suck at all the things. They kept the drinks flowing, there was plenty of 90s hip hop on the juke, and there was even a Sikh bachelor party in the house that was trying to get wild, which was a first for me. I doubt that's a regular occurrence though, so don't get your hopes up.  They've also got a pool table, darts, Buck Hunter and a few other ways to pass the time if a bunch of clowns are monopolizing the Pop-A-Shot.  But seriously, Pop-A-Shot."}
{"text":"Came here last night because it was the only place open. Security was rude and they need some kind of uniform so that people actually know they're security. Instead he grabbed my friend and made some snide comment about us because he didn't look in uniform and frankly didn't look like security in the first place. Instantly put a bad taste in our mouth the second we got there. Definitely have an interesting crowd that comes in, mostly older, very touchy, incredibly creepy. Bartenders were fine, besides making a toilet water tasting margarita and trying to charge us extra for all of our drinks, it was nothing special. Definitely did not like the fact that the bartenders were drinking behind the bar just for the fun of it. Music was bland and way too loud. Overall I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Not a great range of drinks but service was fine and place was mostly clean. A bit out the way but was fine for somewhere a bit quieter."}
