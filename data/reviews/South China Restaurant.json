{"text":"This is owned by the old original cook/owner of Tang Dynasty in Lincoln Square Mall. If you ever wonder what happened to the food there, it was this: the cook sold it and left. He's now opened a new place and the food's just as good as I remembered it. 

Had the dry-fried string beans, some stir-fried beef and mixed veg dish, the mix platter appetizer and some beef noodle soup. All were quite flavorful and tasty, and not too oily (something that happens often in this town with Chinese food, sadly). Could not stop eating the green beans, even my four year old liked them. For those who use this metric for their Chinese restaurants: every other patron there was native Chinese, both students and older folk. Parking is free, easy and plentiful. 

As others have said, the interior is the exact same (they even still have the beanbag toss game out on the patio and the 'lucky' rock in the lobby from when it was Rock's) just with a bunch of tables thrown in but I'm sure that'll change as it gets established.
The serving staff was efficient (might have to point at the menu item you're ordering) and quick with the food, which was piping hot and obviously freshly made, and quite friendly with my son when he practiced his Chinese on them. 

All in all a nice time, excellent authentic food, easy parking close to campus and convenient hours. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in town now. Very authentic Chinese food. Way better than Golden Harbor which is getting horrible now. Their live fish dishes are well prepared, fresh, and very much worth the money. It'd be great if the owners can remodel the restaurant, which used to be a bar."}
{"text":"I don't see why all these reviews are negative. We just ordered delivery and it was quick. Our food is fresh and hot! Really good Chinese place."}
{"text":"I have never been inside, having ordered online or by phone.  My orders have always been delivered in the time frame given and the food is consistently good.  The delivery drivers are friendly, especially a young man named Mike, who always has a smile and provides excellent service.  The food is arrives hot, and one of my favorite meals is the shrimp with cashews.  It is loaded with fresh vegetables, shrimp, and cashews.  You also get a lot of food for a good price.  I have never had a bad experience or been treated poorly.  This is my favorite Chinese restaurant and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I placed a order for delivery online and after 50 minutes called to check on my order. A lady answered the phone and said my order was on the way. After waiting 20 more minutes I call back in and they finally placed someone who spoke English on the phone and then told me that they never received my order and that they could cook it now. I declined and I will never go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and ingredient seems fresh. We order beef with noodles, fry dumpling, and happy family. They taste as good as Golden Harbor but the portion is probably only at most 2/3 of size as from golden harbor. Their price is about the same as Golden Harbor. So Golden Harbor is probably a better deal. South China Restaurant also seems to have more MSG in their dishes than Golden Harbor. I came to South China Restaurant because Golden Harbor closed on Monday."}
{"text":"I like this place, though is is an odd atmosphere and though the seating can be uncomfortable. They are not really aiming at middle-American tastes, but the cooking is good. Our second favorite Chinese place in town."}
{"text":"Great food, I can't say I've ever had the dine in experience but this place is my go to for Chinese food, fair pricing and big portions not to mention the crab rangoons are out of this world."}
{"text":"We were 3 at lunch and order the Sichuan Beef, Hong Shao Fish Fillet and Shrimp Fried Rice sets which were all good. The Hot and Sour soup that accompany the meal was nice and the Shrimp Fried Rice had a great Wok Hei. An enjoyable meal - we will be back."}
{"text":"Meh, it's okay I guess. They should really do something about the woman who took our order over the phone.. Little tip, don't tell the customer \" *sigh* call us back later when you know what you want\". When they are just deciding which soup to go with. 

PS: the Egg Drop soup was pretty good"}
{"text":"The stars are only for the food. The food was good and coming out fast. However, there was only one server during night time, no smile and no service at all, and charge tips directly."}
{"text":"They have the worst service I have ever seen! The waitress (I guess she is the daughter of the boss), always has a terrible face and rude tone. She looks like an uneducated person! So terrible!!!!!"}
{"text":"Very authentic Chinese food!!! Best choose for you find Chinese restaurant. I found those photos from facebook.

{"text":"I'm on a mission to find a good Chinese restaurant that is reasonably priced in Chambana, and I was happy with South China Restaurant.

The Good:
-The Steamed Dumplings were delicious. The whole reason I came to South China was to satisfy my immense craving for dumplings. 
-The Moo Goo Gai Pan was also very good, I would definitely order it again as the dish has always been one of my favorites.
-My SO ordered the shrimp lo mein and I stole a bite of the shrimp, and it had very good flavor, and he said that he enjoyed it.
-The portion size was exactly what I was hoping for. We both left full and with enough leftovers for another meal (which we ate the next night). 

The Bad:
-The service wasn't fantastic. Sometimes a bit slow, but there was one waitress for the entire dining room of 10-15 tables, so it was completely understandable. 

Overall:
I would definitely return, the food was very good, though I wish they delivered!"}
{"text":"A lot of the Chinese students here said this was a good place and more authentic than the other Chinese places in town. I was recommended to try the stir-fried fish with chili and and the steamed fish with chili sauce. Both were excellent and both dishes were big enough for two people to share. We also had a good dish that was thinly sliced potatoes and peppers. We also had a plate with various kinds of mushrooms. Very tasty! They have some American Chinese dishes too, but I didn't see the point in getting them, since I like trying new things and their menu is huge!

They do not have a full bar like it says under the description, though.  But we inquired if we could do BYOB and they said it would be fine."}
{"text":"Top 2 Chinese in Champaign!  The only downside is sometimes it gets slow for the ordered dish to come!"}
{"text":"Some food are good, however some food are out of the ordinary understanding of Chinese food. The picture shows ???? we ordered. It becomes deep fried intestine not ??. It is very crunchy."}
{"text":"This is clearly by far the best Chinese restaurant in Chambana. I live in this town over forty years and have visited most large cities in the US.  South China is as good as most Chinese restaurants that I have visited.

The food is excellent; the ambient is conducive; and parkings are amble."}
{"text":"Another Chinese restaurant in town with a BIG menu (opened like yesterday). This place was previously the Boneyard Bar & BBQ and you can tell that because there is a bar area in the middle. They have fresh lobster and tilapia in the tank so thats a good thing. They are newly open so the menu is still kinda unofficial and it can sure use some remodeling and decoration to make it more like a Chinese restaurant but overall its not a bad place to dine.
Based on their menu, they can cook some big dishes like dongpo pork hock but we tried something basic. Food is nicely cooked and relatively authentic (they have american chinese food too). Price is medium ($$).
4 stars for the food
2.5 stars for the environment but things may turn better with running"}
{"text":"I'm sitting here waiting for my food.  I ordered at 5:36 and she said 10 minutes. As I sat down to wait, I began to read these reviews. Boxes in the corner? Yup. So maybe they are not so worried about ambience? I was getting a to-go order, so ehh it's fine for them to be efficient and have them close by. Right? But then I heard the woman on the phone and her frustration grow with the customer on the other end of the phone. She may have said something about \"speak English\" and handed the phone over there the guy annoyed. So I guess I could see calling in an order going not so well. Sitting here writing this review. I pray that my meal turns out good. I'll fill you in when I know!"}
{"text":"Went there with my family. Traditional Chinese restaurant,traditional Chinese foods. Not the one for western people,little bit spicy. But we like it.
A little bit pricy,but we like the taste. Recommend it."}
{"text":"Some items reminded me of grandma's cooking and some were not what I expected but they turned out to be surprisingly good. They could be heavy on salt but I love that they could cook to order and stuff off the menu are always nice."}
{"text":"The food is good and reasonably priced but the service is just horrible. We used to frequent this place earlier and now we stopped after repeated bad service. Basically they are under staffed and there is just one waitress who handles most of the guests and she neither understands what we say and always has a tired look. We have to typically wait for a long time to place the order and if you need anything in between you need to get it yourself."}
{"text":"Went here last night--food was great and, as far as I could tell (not being Chinese myself), one of the more authentic Chinese restaurants in Champaign-Urbana.  Run by the former owner of T'ang Dynasty and possibly as good as Golden Harbor.  We had eggplant with ground pork, cold noodles (spicy with ginger and chile), cold salty Nanking duck, and fried spring rolls.  All was delicious, especially the eggplant and the duck.  And there's plenty more on the menu to explore.

This place has been open in the old Fireside/Rocks/Boneyard BBQ building across from Mas Amigos since late December, so, yes, the interior is pretty much just the bare bones of a bar and grill right now, but much less spartan than Golden Harbor's lunchroom ambience, if that kind of thing is important to you.  Go give them some business!"}
{"text":"This place is a teeny bit closer to home than some of the other Chinese places in town, so we gave it a shot based on reviews here saying the guy who used to own Tang Dynasty (which means it should be the same guy who also owned Yen Ching many many years ago) owns this place.

The lunch special is an entree, egg drop or hot and sour soup, and crab rangoon or eggroll.  The price is pretty decent for all of that - except I didn't get any soup, which I didn't discover until I got home and unpacked my to-go order, so... I have no idea if it's good or not.
The entrees advertised as spicy were bland, definitely no heat or spice.
The best part of any of our entrees was the crab rangoon - super creamy, sweet, flavorful.  But unfortunately I'm not going to suffer through mediocre food for excellent crab rangoon.  There are far better Chinese places in town than this.  Maybe it was just extra disappointing because I went into this thinking I was going to experience food like Yen Ching used to offer - but either way, I simply won't be going back."}
{"text":"This place is actually a welcome addition to the Chinese restaurant scene in Chambana.  They have a live fish tank in the front lobby, a big rock (to rub for luck...leftover from when the restaurant was \"The Rock\"), a bar and a huge dining area.   Their menu is very extensive with seafood, pork, poultry, beef, vegetables, etc.  I walked in around 11am and the restaurant was empty.  It was VERY cold so I wound up keeping my jacket on.  I ordered from their lunch menu ($6.95!) and wound up getting the Hong Shiao Fish fillets.  It comes with a choice of soup (hot sour or egg drop) or salad, an egg roll or crab rangoon, and white or fried rice.   I chose hot and sour, egg roll and white rice.  Everything came out FAST.  The egg roll had lots of pork in it with cabbage, the hot sour soup was hot and yummy.  And the entree was wonderful!!! They do have the American lunches (moo gai pan, kung pao chicken, etc) but I tried to get something that I never had before.  There were lots of bell peppers, snap peas, onions, mushrooms and flaky white fish.  The sauce wasn't typical... it was a welcome flavor of sweet and savory!!!   Anyway, I enjoyed it for being a fast Chinese lunch... and the price and service were great!   I'll definitely return!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome food fast delivery would reorder from here anytime fabulous food friendly service enjoyed every minute of my meal"}
{"text":"If I could give them -100 stars, I would do so. This place is absolute crap with an absolute rude, disorganized, and unruly staff. Feb 03, 2014, we ordered boneless spare ribs, house fried rice, crab rangoon, shrimp egg roll, and steamed dumplings. The rice was crunchy, the crab rangoon and steamed dumplings were soggy and doughy. We tried to put the soggy stuff in the oven - no good. We called to complain and were unable to understand or communicate with anyone we spoke to. We ordered the food online to be delivered because we do not have a care. They insisted we come there to get new food. We insisted either they bring us new food, or they refund our money. They sent someone to our house to pick up the nasty food, then CHARGED US AGAIN instead of refunding us, so we had to sit online with the CC company to dispute the charge. Never Never Never Never again. It is my recommendation that you STAY AWAY from South China Restaurant."}
{"text":"Just randomly felt like Chinese while in town, and chose to come here based on Yelp. They have pretty decent portions for lunch specials, and everything was very good! Definitely try the hot/sour soup and the seseme chicken!"}
{"text":"They really need to take a look at who is answering their phone.  There is no way that you can understand what the lady is saying on the phone.  She is rude and really do not need to be working in a public place with people.  You call and place a order and then ask if they deliver and she just say click and hangs up the phone.  Then when you call back she is screaming at you in regards about what you order..   They should be shut down or replace the associates that work there.  If there service is bad then there food is bad as well.   Call somebody else they would be willing to help people or build your customer reputations"}
{"text":"The food is average (compared to other Chinese restaurants in Champaign-Urbana area and they all have very good quality). During busy time, service is slow."}
{"text":"Really excellent food and service--if you're in the area, come and support this establishment! You won't be sorry. We ordered three apps: spicy beef tendon (a little salty but still delicious); fried dumplings; and steamed dumplings--all were mouth watering. We also had 3 entrées: pork short ribs and noodle soup; seafood hotpot; and lamb slices with cumin. Each was a home run, the spice level was very manageable and everything was fresh and flavorful. We will be back often."}
{"text":"The ambience is good, it's big and with large family or friends the dining will be pleasant.

Food is fine but the waitress is the worst, she won't even smile at us. She will give the look as if \"why did you even come here?\". The fortune cookies that they have in the front have been expired for years I guess. We tried tasting it and it was so hard."}
{"text":"The food is good. I'd recommend ordering for delivery or carryout rather than dining in as the place is not very nice inside. 
We have ordered by phone and via online order. The problem with phone orders is the person taking the orders and payment information has a hard time understanding you. The problem with online ordering is sometimes there is trouble processing payments. Last time we were double charged but they corrected it right away."}
{"text":"Sweet and simple.
The food is decent and it provides for a nicer environment than some other places you might go to.
But ultimately, for the price we paid and the quality of the food we got, there are better options.

Entrees were around $15"}
{"text":"I tried out this place recently with a few friends, and was pleasantly surprised.  We ordered three dishes (one appetizer) and all were well seasoned and pretty authentically Chinese.  My favorite was the Water Boiled Beef (???)--spicy and numbing from the peppercorns, with yummy veggies at the bottom.  We were fishing around at the end for every last morsel! The appetizer we ordered (????) was a good mix of beef + tendon + offal, rather than being heavy on one vs the others.  

The interior is interesting, harkening a bit back to the bar setup from the sports bar that used to inhabit the space.  In general, the food was solid and the service helpful.  Check them out if you're interested in a more authentic Chinese place."}
{"text":"Place is a dump, empty boxes stacked chest high in the dimly light dinning area, service is very lacking. I don't think they have the a/c on or it's broke.
Overall place looks very dirty, cook was going to town in the back but not sure for who.
Need to find some good Chinese food somewhere around town! HELP!"}
{"text":"The owner is arrogant, the service is horrible and the food does not taste good. For the price, I'd rather visit Golden Harbor."}
{"text":"Service was horrible, it was my boyfriends graduation and we celebrated with 20 people, we all waited for a while to finally put our orders in or to get drinks. Then we had to wait over 30 min to finally have our food come. Other tables came way after us with bigger groups as well but they received all of their food and we always had to keep asking the waitresses when our food was coming or for simple refills of drinks and rice. Food is great but service sucked, they should have better management on their staff since they were understaffed and the waitresses kept forgetting to give us our utensils and such and we always had to repeatedly remind them to serve us things properly. Restaurant wasn't even that crowded but other Chinese people were served with lots of food and great service except for us. (We had a group of american, and vietnamese people) I don't recommend coming here unless you have a lot of patience for food to come over 30 min and that you're Chinese."}
{"text":"After a long trip I stopped in a hotel nearby to get some rest and food. Ordered from here without checking the reviews. The delivery was quick. The food left much to be desired. The crab Rangoon had hardly any filling. The wonton egg drop soup was extremely salty, to the point of being inedible. The beef  with broccoli was okay, but I wasn't thrilled. It wasn't the worst Chinese food I've had, but I wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"The waitress is suck.
And the dishes tastes not so good 
Bad restaurant forever.
Maybe u guys can choose Golden Harbor to eat the Chinese restaurant
Do not come to this bad restaurant
You will be regret for your choice"}
{"text":"How could I have lived here for almost 2 years and never know of this place? We came here almost by accident after 3 other Indian/Chinese places were closed Christmas day.

The crab rangoon was a teeny bit well done, but oh so creamy and sweet! The mushu chicken came without pancakes but I didn't feel I was missing anything. The rice was super sticky. 

Nice decor. Friendly staff. Decent prices. 

I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"South China Restaurant is a new Chinese restaurant in Champaign in an old barbecue place (I believe the name was Boneyard BBQ).  Many of the fixtures, etc. from the old establishment remain, which gives it a slightly strange vibe, but the food cannot be beat.  While they do serve some Americanized dishes, we asked the waitress to recommend some more authentic dishes.

We ordered:
-Stir fried green beans  - very salty but delicious
-Tofu hot pot - very spicy and VERY tasty
-Stir fried chicken - reminded me of dry spicy Chicken, but better. This is an incredible dish

The dishes were a bit pricey, but unlike some other places in town the interior is very clean and it is not counter service.  I look forward to coming back and trying more."}
{"text":"Don't plan on coming here for any events where you'd want to have a reservation! Came here for my best friend's graduation dinner, after she had placed a reservation with a list of dishes ordered over a month in advance, and even called the morning of the dinner to confirm everything would be ready upon arrival. They had assured us that everything was in order, however when we arrived none of the food was ready, and their excuse was that they thought our order was for take-out, which it was not. Even if it was for take-out, the food should have been ready by the agreed reservation time! It took at least 45 minutes to get the dishes out, making it an extremely late dinner. 

I added a star for the food since it was decent and doesn't deserve to be penalized due to the establishment's practices. However, some of the dishes were a little too salty for my friends' tastes. 

At the end of the whole ordeal, the manager had the audacity to verbally request that we leave a tip since she has to pay her workers.. It's not up to the patron to make sure your workers are compensated fairly, especially if they barely provided any customer service (a member of OUR party had to go up to the kitchen to grab orders since we were tired of waiting for our food). Terrible business practices. If anything the dinner should have been discounted due to their careless mistakes and lack of internal communication. Way to ruin a family dinner for a new grad!"}
{"text":"Ehhh... it's at the edge of campus town and right next to a adult store.  I thought it might be good because I saw the high reviews on Yelp.

They have a huge menu but anybody who thinks this is even close to Golden Harbor needs to get their taste buds checked.

First.. the waitress didn't speak any English which is fine because I speak Mandarin.  Second.. there was no host service at all.  We ordered a few things...
- Stir fried green beans:  It was okay... a bit oily
- Dry Szechwan Chicken:  Way too breaded... they use these crappy chicken pieces because it's cheaper.
- Kungpao Chicken:  My lunch mate got this.. same comment... use of crappy chicken pieces because it's cheaper.  And who puts cauliflower in their Kungpao chicken?!

I only saw recommendation for the tendon dish.. perhaps they need to reduce their menu to focus on making a few things good instead of nothing at all."}
{"text":"We actually enjoyed this place the first few times we visited.  Granted, it is a short walk from our house and that in its own was a major perk but the service was fast, the food was pretty tasty and we enjoyed it.  We liked the crab rangoons the best and split the pu pu platter.  The general tsos chicken is also good.  We did, however, have  an experience recently where we received rawish (pork) meat.  When I poured it from the to go container I could actually smell it.  Not good.... check the food before you leave, if you can."}
{"text":"We've always had great service, fast delivery and food that is consistently good."}
{"text":"Not the best Chinese food in the area (golden harbor) but not the worst. The main problem I had was that most dishes were overly greasy, especially the shrimp and noodles. Noodles had a slightly offputting taste, like reused oil or lard. The eggplant with garlic sauce was delicious but not spicy like the menu said. The best thing we had was definitely the Szechuan fish and tofu. The tofu was so fresh and the fish was perfectly cooked. The sauce had that nice slow burn you get from a good Szechuan dish. I would maybe stick to the Szechuan as this place is supposedly known for spicy food. Not opposed to coming back but I would ask to watch the grease and highly recommend the Szechuan fish."}
{"text":"It has to be 5 stars this time since the owner bribed us with a complimentary medium dish of celery and pork dumplings. The dough covering was not thin but with firm and chewy texture. The filling came to your bite with some surprisingly pleasant fragrance. Okay, i am not from the northern part of China where people make this type of dumplings from scratch at home in a daily basis or so. But after 4 years living in Beijing, to the dumpling and the owner, i say, Bravo.

And there comes some serious culinary work. We had?
Appetizers:
Chengdu Clear Noodles??????
Scallion Pancakes??????

Main courses:
Braised Duck with Scallion??????
Fire Pot with Pork Intestine and Hot Sauce??????
Steam Fish with Pickled Peppers in Hunan Style (?????
Celery Fried with Dry Tofu and Peppers (????????

The Braised Duck with Scallion?????? and the Steam Fish with Pickled Peppers in Hunan Style (????? were really the highlights. The duck was tender with a source surprises you mouth full. The fish was just so gentle cooked that you feel it softened your teeth and tongue.

Our Russian American friends have been exposed to some fine Chinese cuisines both in Chicago and China (mainland and HK) as well as fine cuisines everywhere so I will say gourmet tourists. They enjoyed the two dishes very much as us Chinese did.
  
Okay, in a nutshell, write down my list in Chinese or English, one way or another. This is the \"You have to know what to order\" list. Try it out there and you will never regret."}
{"text":"My daughters love sesame chicken. I called here to place an order for them and I had one question. What's the difference between the chef specialty sesame chicken and the combination sesame chicken. It's on their menu but it doesn't say what the different about them. She told me \"I don't know. Come in a look at the menu.\" I was looking at the menu. I am already coming to pick up the order. I want it ready when I get there. I called a competitor and receive much better service. We used to love ordering from here but it's definitely gone downhill over the years. We've always come back even though they've never gotten the order perfect. It's time to say enough mistakes and take our business elsewhere."}
{"text":"It suprises me how there are so many good Chinese places in such a small area of Central Illinois and South China Restaurant adds to this list. For me, South China is in the middle of the pack -- not as fancy as Rainbow Garden or as tasty as Golden Harbor, but somewhere inbetween. The big plus of this restaurant is the spacious interior and decent size parking lot but the dishes are a little on the expensive side and the service could be quicker. Food is inconsistent with some dishes being excellently prepared while others are bland and forgetful.  In particular, I liked the Deep Fried Fish Fillet with Pine Nuts & Sweet & Sour Sauce, Sauteed Asparagus & Shredded Pork, Braised Pork, Mao's Family Style, and Stewed Meatball With Brown Sauce in Hot Pot."}
