{"text":"Absolutely delicious food; great vibe and fantastic service. Totally don't get the poor reviews. Heard the menu is expanding next week. Will be coming back here lots for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here for drinks on a lazy Saturday. The owner served us and made *amazing* cocktails. Margarita with muddled pineapple is heaven. Service was excellent.  We will be back for food!"}
{"text":"Very dissatisfied, food wasn't very good at all. I honestly don't think I'd pay $5 for that chicken dish I had. I'd rather have a bagel at Tim Hortons.   The staff wasn't bad, but the food was so sad. There's an extreme hot weather alert today and the air conditioner doesn't work very well and the back door was open most of the time, I was literally sliding off the bench seat.   We started with the chips with salsa and guacamole, guacamole was good. The chips were bland, Tostitos are better. Also the salsa was chopped tomato, there were a couple other things sticking to the tomato, likely cilantro and maybe some lime juice in there. Really it just tasted like diced tomato with something acidic. Re fried beans were runny and cold. I think rice with tomato sauce was served under the chicken and the rice was severely under cooked.   Anyways our bill was over $100 after the tip and I would never pay more than $30 for it, maybe not even more than $20, honesty I really wouldn't. I'd spend $30 on pizza before I ever ate there again.   It's not going to last. Go a little south of Eglinton to Mariachis for some Mexican in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"No mexican good! They chips and salsa are from the supermarket. I do not  understand why they call themselves a mexican food restaurant. It is dishonest. Margaritas are bad too, and too expensive. I do not recommend it."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for a friday night on open table and were turned away even though they had tables reserved for other people who had not shown up yet. They prioritized other reservations over the people who actually showed up on time for theirs. They were busy an uninterested in trying to solve this problem. Instead we were just turned away"}
{"text":"Had walked by a few times and was finally drawn in by some recent renovations (the new Dia de los Muertos-inspired mural is fantastic). Great atmosphere, friendly service (the owner stopped by our table to see how we were doing), and the shrimp were delicious. Will definitely be popping in again to try out some of their other offerings."}
{"text":"Finally an amazing Mexican restaurant in the Yonge and Eglinton area. Starting with some queso fundido and root chips is a must for me and the tacos are just too good. Very pleasant and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I just finished pork belly tacos...haven't finished my meal...had to tell the world.  If you're somewhere right now and you're eating something other than tio's pork belly tacos you need to re-evaluate your priorities in life.  Unless you're a vegan, in which case you still need to re-evaluate your priorities in life, but for different reasons."}
{"text":"i believe Tio's is average Mexican fare which provides a good variety of options. I orders the Soup and the Shrimp Tacos. My friend ordered the chips and the fish tacos. I felt my soup was a bit too thick, almost like a tomato puree/porridge rather than being a bit more \"soupy\" for a lack of a better word. The flavours were good. The chips were great  and I liked the variety that was offered (nachos, kasava chips etc). The tacos were decent but I felt that the flavors could have been much better, authentic. This leads to my overall comment of the restaurant where I feel the flavors are modified to suit a western palette rather than offering the true essence of Mexico. It defeats the purpose of having an ethnic restaurant especially when the \"real\" flavors are much more fascinating, complex and provides a memorable and wholesome experience. I can get similar flavors at a Moxie's or Milestones and would have come out much more satisfied than here, as I am not expecting authenticity of flavors at such restaurants. Hence Tio's should strive to provide a more authentic experience regardless of it's location.   Side note is the hostess could be a bit more easy going, friendly and relaxed in her service."}
{"text":"I think for a new joint the place is good. The portion sizes are nice and the fish tacos are tasty. I like it that they come constructed so I'm not left throwing together my meal (battered fish only). The hint of mango in the taco is a nice surprise and adds a little \"sumthin\" to the overall flavour. The root chips are quite delectable and can happily be an appetizer for 2. I would go back for another meal sometime."}
{"text":"An unassuming place to get really great, fresh food with attentive service.   The good: the food. I've been looking for vegetarian tacos that feel like a meal unto themselves, rather than what was left over from my husband's meat tacos. The flavours were great. Satisfying. Fresh. Not overly greasy. Just. Great. Taco portion wasn't huge, but I left satisfied (and I can eat like 5 pregnant ladies put together).   Even my toddler loved the chicken (from my husband) and the veg (from me). They also had high chairs, colouring stuff and were patient as my daughter was squirmy. She also loved the strawberry lemonade (pretty sweet, but not excessively so).  The service was attentive and efficient. The owner and chef stopped by our table (as they were walking by) and asked about our meal.  The so so: my husband had some undercooked black beans in his burrito, but still loved it."}
{"text":"Very nice place. Tacos are flavorful, enchiladas are *very* tasty (love the sauce), the alambre and pollo asado are excelllent. What else?.. ah yes.. the guac is righteous and the churros are really good too. Can't go wrong. Only thing is that along with half price sangria on Wed, it's also half the size. Good though."}
{"text":"I love Mexico, but I can't always go there so Tio's makes me feel like I'm in Mexico. The food, the music, the service, and especially the decorations. The food is great just expand the menu a bit more because if I already had everything then I don't know what to do. But, they made up for this with their MASSIVE burritos. Literally I've had 2 and I only finished it once. Great place."}
{"text":"Well... a FIVE if I had had a margarita to go with it (we were there shortly after opening and before they had their liquor license). Delicious tacos and friendly service.  We had the chicken skin appetizer, fried crispy and delicious. Forget about potato skins! And we had the salsa and guac appetizer.  Yummy guacamole and very fresh.    Family friendly and a fun vibe."}
{"text":"Excellent food, vibe and service.  Was highly recommended by a friend and it did not disappoint. Awesome fish tacos and churros.  Good for families.  Haven't tried the weekend brunch yet but that will be my next stop!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the this little gem!  We ordered a tinga (braised chicken) taco and chorizo burrito and neither one disappointed us!  Thank goodness the guy was pretty chill about telling me about all the sides that came along with the tacos (salsa verda vs salsa roja), and while I made a mess of myself, I had a ton of fun putting my taco together and indulging in it! As for the guac and chips on the side for the burrito, it was delish!!! Lastly, we ordered churros for dessert and it was pretty yummy (and hot!) with the creme fraiche and berries on the side. Will definitely try to come back again! :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken fajitas.  It came with several small tortillas, chicken, rice and grilled peppers with onions.  The presentation was attractive and the grilled peppers and rice were superb.  But the chicken was much too salty.  It felt like someone accidentally spilled a salt shaker on the chicken, covered it with something green (watercress?) and hoped we wouldn't notice.  As long as the tortillas are loaded with everything, the abundance of salt isn't so obvious.  But don't try to eat a piece of chicken on its own!  Maybe all that salt explains the giant water jar on our table.  The decor follows the Mexican theme with colourful murals, sombreros, a pinata and other Mexican knick-knacks.  The garage door entrance is unique.  It was open to let in fresh air.  There's enough street parking in the area to even satisfy a suburbanite."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday was a very underwhelming and disappointing experience. My margarita was basically a glass of ice and syrup with a sugar rim. The tacos were equally unimpressive. I ordered 2 pescado, 1 chorizo, and 1 chicken. The only semi-decent one was was the chicken. The others were incredibly dry, which led me to order a side of salsa (there are no sauces/sides on the tacos). They brought me a tiny dish of pico de gallo, which was also mediocre. I discovered this tiny dish of chopped onion and tomato cost me $5 when I got my bill. I hope the regular dishes here are better than what I ordered tonight. Regardless, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Food is mediocre at best, service might win an award for worst in the city.  Unwilling and not friendly at all... Cold to the touch.  With so many Mexican places in the yonge and eglinton area it won't survive, decent building if you have the money, lots of potential. It's unfortunate."}
{"text":"The owner is so absolutely precious that i would like le to give high marks because he's adorable but the food is average, prices are high and portions are small. A single margarita for $15 is very over priced.  Menu is also very limited and not very creative.  If you want excellent Mexican in the Yonge and Eglinton at reasonable prices go to Miriachi which is just south of Yonge.  If you are good with average food, high prices but good atmosphere and adorable staff, this is your place!"}
{"text":"Food: Really, really good! We had the tacos de pescado and pork belly tacos. Both were equally tasty. However, they were not very filling despite the fact that there is normally enough tacos to get full.  We also had churros for dessert. Word of advice: if it's just two people, do not attempt to finish it all! You will be extremely full, especially with the cajeta crema sauce.   Service: Could have been better. It took a while for us to have our orders taken and for our bill to come. The bartender kinda made things up for being good conversation."}
{"text":"Sitting in Tio's right now. For sure some of the better Mexican food in the city.   Cute little casual restaurant. Great music. Great service. Excellent food.   Owner Ramsey was helping his staff work, they were all super attentive and nice.    Highly Recommend!"}
{"text":"Nice decor although the music is too loud. It's not a great place for conversation. The service is very good and attentive without being smothering. Sadly the food is lacklustre. The burritos are bulky but mostly lettuce and flavourless. The chips are soft and oily and also lacking in any flavour or texture. They taste like bread. The guacamole is good and so is the salsa, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Came here Thursday Night with my friend.  Tio's seemed to be our choice of place.  Inside the ambiance is cozy and warm with lots of Mexican inspired decor.  With plenty of seating arrangements that were full, we decided to sit by the bar which had a great selection of drinks.  In addition there are various daily specials, and coming here on Thursday's Wine was half off.  Our server Aries was pretty cool in providing us some food and drink recommendations so we decided to take up the offer.   Me with my tempranillo wine and my buddy with a bottle of Modelo Especial we were set. For food I tried their Beef burrito, served with a side of nacho chips and in-house salsa.  Huge and plenty of flavors, the spicy salsa does help to enhance the flavor of the burrito.   The overall experience was great! I'll be sure to come back."}
{"text":"Went here for Sunday brunch. Great atmosphere and excellent service. The steak and eggs were delicious and the Jarrito was nice and cold. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Uncle Betty's next door had a long wait so we decided to try Tio's for brunch on a Saturday morning. Service was slow and the place wasn't very full. I ordered Eggs Benedict which lacked flavor and was pretty bland. It was served on cornbread which was way too sweet.   My friends ordered fried chicken and waffles and they seemed to enjoy their meal.   Don't think I'll be returning!"}
{"text":"Awesome Mexican food, great service and cozy ambiance. Not very noisy. Decorated in great Mexican theme including skulls and piñata. My beef deconstructed tacos were great. Very fresh cilantro and other toppings, beef was plentiful, tender and juicy. Great place!"}
{"text":"There's an absolute dearth of Mexican joints in the Yonge and Eglinton area, so I was understandably very excited when I noticed that Tio's Urban Mexican was opening a few doors down from Uncle Bettys. I attempted to check it out on a Saturday night but the line was out the door, so I returned a few days later and grabbed some tacos to go.  As per the menu: \"All tacos will be served deconstructed style with totillas, onions, cilantro, crema, salsa verde, salsa roja, radishes and limes. Your choice of protein.\"  I opted for the tinga (braised chicken) and took a seat at one of the tables. The place is evidently not air conditioned because it was hotter than hell in there, which I think the server realized because he offered me a glass of water.  The food arrived and I took it home, and I was pleasantly surprised to note that the chicken was actually still pretty hot by the time I opened the box. (The benefit of presenting the food \"deconstructed,\" I suppose.) I tried a little of the chicken by itself and it was really, really good. And after assembling it into a taco, it was even better. The combination of the various toppings and the very tasty corn tortillas was just about perfect. I have to single out those sauces, though, because they're pretty amazing and so, so flavorful. (I'll have to inquire if they sell the salsa roja by the bottle, it's just that good.)  I'm definitely excited to try more of their offerings, especially their burritos. A solid addition to the neighborhood, to be sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I popped into this place tonight after noticing it the previous night on a walk and knowing my love for Mexican food (I am originally from California).  We had the salsa and guac with root chips to start and it was awesome!  Both salsa and guac were very fresh and the chips were a nice change from the traditional tortilla chips.  For the meals, we had the deconstructed tacos with the braised beef and the burrito with the braised chicken.  My wife loved the tacos and the meat was perfectly cooked.  The burrito was huge and quality through and through - reminiscent of my time back in California with an upscale factor to it.  We were not planning on dessert, but when the waitress said churros, my pregnant wife and my belly couldn't resist. This is not your typical churro, as it's almost like churro minis and it comes with a strawberry mousse to dip.  You get all the flavor of a traditional churro with a unique twist!  They don't yet have a liquor license so if you are looking for drinks, it will be a little longer, but it's worth trying now just for the food!"}
{"text":"Service was less than personable. Not a welcoming atmosphere. Food was meh.... at least it matches the service."}
{"text":"Good times, with food, and vibes ---my new spot to eat n drink and I love the prices  What I really enjoy is how the owner is very personable greeting everyone and really making the atmosphere a much better place  Location of the bar is also good spot"}
{"text":"Do not recommend. Very bland food and over priced! Price does not reflect their portion size or flavour!"}
{"text":"Felt like Mexican food and Tio's popped up, so we decided to give it a try. The food is absolutely amazing, atmosphere is cozy and service is great. We had fish tacos, cheese fondue and chicken burrito. Cheese fondue was very unique and delicious, very highly recommend. Burrito was more or less standard and fish tacos outstanding! It's a great place, we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum! You have to come here. Delicious food and amazing service. Had Suadero (braised beef) Tacos and Guajillo Shrimp. We will be coming back very soon for more!"}
{"text":"This place served the best Mexican food I've tasted in Toronto. I came in on a Wednesday evening and the vibe was pleasantly laid back and welcoming. We started off with some guac, salsa, and tortilla & yuca chips: the guac was fresh and what you'd expect of a classic guacamole and it did not disappoint. The salsa is tasty but nothing special. My friend ordered the bone marrow soup (which is so beautifully presented) and even though I'm not a fan of bone marrow, this dish was surprisingly delicious and my friends, who love bone marrow, were over the moon. Next we tried the queso fundido - basically a Mexican cheese fondue- served with warm tortillas (side note: the tortillas are amazing and I found out they're made fresh daily!!) I don't know how else to describe a plate of melted cheese but seriously it's a must try and it's lick-the-plate delicious. We also had the camarones - jumbo grilled shrimp in a chipotle sauce. They were perfectly grilled, the flavor was smoky and a little sweet, and the portion is generous. We had the steak and grilled fish tacos as our main to share between the three of us (each plate comes with 4 tacos). The steak was tender, and the fish was nicely spiced and cooked perfectly. I love the deconstructed style of the tacos and they provide you with a plate of toppings so you get to choose what you want to put on top. We finished off the meal with churros - which are not visually the typical churro you'd expect, but they're delicious! Overall, I was very impressed with the diverse selection on the menu. Most Mexican restaurants in the city have similar menus that mainly feature tacos. Definitely adding this place to my going out for dinner rotation."}
{"text":"The food here is so good! We started with the guacamole (home made chips, the root vegetable chips were a nice touch:) The tacos were yummy, especially the pescado, and pork! Next time I'm trying the squid! Great portion sizes, flavours and service! Keanu was helpful and friendly! Definitely going back on Wednesday's when sangrias are 1/2 price!! $5:) The dessert: churros were more dense like a biscotti, whatever creamy dipping sauce came with them is soooo dangerous!:) Clean and good ambiance too!"}
{"text":"Not a great experience, do not recommend  We came here for our friends' birthday last thursday evening. it was the 4 of us and we quickly got a table. Our server didn't explain any of the specials they had going on (thursday is 1/2 price wine), so we ordered a round of cocktails. Our server told us that our bartender was gone but would be back, he ran out of something (red flag #1). When our drinks did arrive they were OK. We ordered the queso app. When it arrived the waitress explained it usually came served in a hot skillet, which ours did not... it was served in a regular bowl (red flag #2). It tasted OK, not too much flavour to be honest and not similar to any queso I have personally had before. When we were about to order mains, she heard us talking about ordering dessert. She quickly told us that there was a new chef, who messed up the churros batter, so there was no dessert (red flag #3).   We ended up ordering mains. I found that the # of items that came in portions very odd and no options to change it. We had the beef and the fish. Both had very little flavour. The fish ones had a huge piece of lettuce on it and were very battered, but yet, little flavour. I was extremely disappointed. Also, for the cost, the portions are very small.   Overall, the experience was not ideal. Since it was our friends birthday and there was no dessert option, I would have at the least expected an apology. We didn't receive that. Overall, I found the food quite different than typical Mexican joints, most expensive and just not flavourful.  I wouldn't return but rather go another Mexican joint in the area."}
{"text":"I ordered just the chips guacamole to go.  Guacamole was good and fresh. Nothing spectacular but good. The order came with salsa too, which I didn't expect. It had too much cilantro in it for me. There were a few different kinds of chips. They were ok.  Friendly service!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this restaurant but sadly it was disappointing.  The staff were very pleasant and attentive but the food was the worst Mexican I've ever had.  The nachos were greasy sitting all day, guacamole and salsa were very bland. What would it take to quickly fry up chips to order. The elote was good.  The octopus taco were like eating rubber bands.  No flavour and tough.  It was deep fried, not slowly boiled and finished off on the grill.  On the plus side, portion was generous.  The pork belly taco was way too sweet.  It needed more acid and heat.  Perhaps I've been spoiled by the many great Mexican restaurants in the city (Playa Cabana, Grand Electric, Carbon....  I had hoped I found a good Mexican in mid-town.  So sad."}
{"text":"Perfectly executed, great friendly service, good value and appropriate ambiance. Will definitely return and definitely earned the #1 rating it achieved for a general restaurant search in the area. We will be back."}
{"text":"Came here on the weekend for a much needed daytime date with the hubby. This place did not disappoint.  We did the bottomless mimosa/caesar and got the Huevos Rancheros and Fried Chicken. Everything was BOMB. Server and owner made us feel like family. Love this spot!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great atmosphere! Very friendly and helpful staff. The portions are really big!  Bit of a wait but well worth it!"}
