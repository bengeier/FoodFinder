{"text":"This place has the best thin crust pizza in the city!!! Mmmmmmmm!!!! I have been going to Marcello's for years and have never been dissapointed.  The place itself isn't pretentious, very simple d√©cor, almost industrial, but I like that.. The focus is definitely pizza ( with the wood burning oven) but they also do decent pasta.  To be honest, I rarely sit down to eat as it can get crowded, I just call ahead, order, and take it away.  This way I can eat the pizza I love and never have the possibility of receiving dissapointing  service :-) you should go!  That's amore!"}
{"text":"Marcello's is excellent. A true neighbourhood Italian. Terrific pizza (mix of white and whole wheat flour, super thing crust) that is cooked in a wood burning oven imported from Rome. Really friendly staff, good specials, terrific salads. Have been going for 11 years and it is a staple."}
{"text":"If you go, get the pizza.  Amazing.  Most underrated in the city.  I've been with the wife +/- 7 times, and everytime have left feeling satisfied.  Good food, good value and personable staff.  What more could you want?"}
{"text":"Marcello's exceeded my expectations.  I'd heard it was a place to get inexpensive, decent Italian food.  My wife and I were lucky enough to arrive just in time to get a table for two.  The restaurant was packed with everything from young couples to extended Italian families, and it looked like the wait time could really grow as they do not take reservations.   I had a special from the grill: sausage, beef, and chicken.  The sausage and chicken were excellent, but I wish they had have given me the option of getting the steak something other than well done; I suppose I should have spoken up when she didn't ask so I must take some responsibility I suppose :)  My wife's pasta was handled quite well, and the portions for both meals was excellent.  The wine list is small but I had a nice chianti which was reasonably priced by the glass, and my wife had a decent white.  Service was excellent, prompt and professional without being chatty.  There was some wait for wine at first, as the place was packed, but once they realized we would want a refill or two, they were attentive and quick.  The bill was the biggest surprise.  We ate and drank our fill for less than a hundred bucks, including tax and a healthy tip."}
{"text":"I just can't give this place any kind of rating! I used to come here with my father for dinner.. It was \"our\" special place. HOWEVER.. after waiting 45 mins.. When the host said it would be a 20 min wait.. We finally sat down. Our group of 4 ordered ceaser salad.. And pasta dishes.. The calamari was so hard.. Had to spit it out.. And the pasta was impossible to eat due to the taste of Garlic Dishwasher. Server did take most of our dishes off our bill... But did not say one word to us after we sent our food back. The person who was tending the bar also cuts the dessert cake for every table... Was not about to order dessert after seeing him pile cake into his mouth. And watched it drop all over his counter like he hasn't eaten in years.  Needless to say... We won't be back again."}
{"text":"Love this place... we have taken many friends here. Have never been disappointed, love everything we have ever tried. I almost always  get a pizza, just because I love their thin crust. Each time we go I try a new flavor. Service has always been friendly and good.  There is a bit of a wait sometimes depending on the time but generally it moves quickly. Go a bit later or earlier and there is usually not a line up."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. It's light so you don't get that heavy, food-coma feeling that makes you feel bloated, but it's still filling and delicious. Had the tiramisu for dessert and it was mind-blowing. It was light and fresh and I wanted more."}
{"text":"Usually one of our favourites and most reliable Italian spots in the city, however the last couple of times have been disappointing, especially our most recent visit. Service is always great and has stayed that way, but some of pasta dishes and pizza are not what they were. We ordered the pasta special, risotto with seafood. Hardly a risotto, more like rice with some saffron added. Tasteless, cold and a total send back, which we did. Our companion Margherita Pizza with olives and basil just as tasteless and if I didn't know better, I'd say the pizza was pre-made, with toppings added when ordered. Tasted like cardboard. We opted for the bolognese pasta instead and it was fine, not great but better than the other two dishes. Hope they make a return to the level Marcello's was and soon."}
{"text":"The experience was pleasant from the momemt I walked in. Service is friendly and attentive. The food is fast and fresh. The pizza is light and crisp and flavourful. Just perfect. The fettuccine with grilled chicken in a roasted garlic cream sauce was out of this world and the gnocchi was delicious. Definitely worth coming here."}
{"text":"The pizza, and pastas are excellent.  The antipasto was impressive and was portioned well, the way you'd expect in Italy.  We expected a typical Toronto small portion but were glad to be incorrect.  The wine is also more reasonably priced compared to most decent restaurants in Toronto (or Ontario generally, thanks to our archaic system dictated by the L Control-Board O). The decor is also very pleasant and rustic at Marcello's.  Service was also decent.  Great spot."}
{"text":"Came in on Saturday evening. Ordered the caprese salad, tomatoes I found to be really overipe. Ordered the Quattro pizza. Was not impressed at all. Not very appetizing. The food was just awful. Don't recommend it"}
{"text":"This restaurant is one of my favourite places on St. Clair.  On a Friday night it could get very busy, so I normally come on a week day instead.  The food is very tasty and the prices are very fair."}
{"text":"Went here with my family from out of town!  Really impressed with the food, service and ambiance.  Good value for the quality of food and portions.  Roasted mixed mushroom soup was Devine, with steak and seafood linguine.  Napoleon pizza from fire burning oven was done to perfection!!  Salmon and fish dishes look amazing.    Will definately  be back in this neighbourhood  spot"}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch. I got the pizza Diavola. It's blew my mind. So good. I actually mourned the loss of two slices that I couldn't finish eating (or carry home because I had a lot of walking to do after). Also happy to see Brio in their soda pop list. The atmosphere was really nice too."}
{"text":"It's somewhat of a Sunday tradition to stop by Marcello's! The staff always welcomes with open arms and the waitresses have great insight into the menu.  I often find my self going with the mussels in white wine and tomato sauce to start, a bolognese with a either penne or spaghetti pasta (depending on how white the shirt is that day) and a tiramisu with espresso for dessert!  During the day, it's pretty easy to get a seat - but get their before 6 on the weekends as they tend to fill up pretty fast!  TIP: check out the photos in the basement of what the St. Clair and Dufferin area used to look like! Also, there's usually free street parking a block east of the restaurant!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Pizza.  I tend to stay away from the pasta since their sauce isn't the best in my opinion but whenever I crave some 'za, this is where you'll find me."}
{"text":"Having had to wait in a long line to get a table at Marcello's on previous visits, we decided on an early dinner and met at the restaurant at 6pm on Friday (which is early for us).  We got one of the last available tables.  Soon after we placed our order, there was a line at the door.    This restaurant gets super busy, but it took very little time to receive our appetizers, followed by main courses.  The pastas here are good (penne alla vodka, fettucine alfonza) and the pasta properly al dente, but we think the star is their pizzas.  The thin crust and generous toppings (and flexibility in substituting toppings) made the pizza cheesy, full of flavour yet not too filling.  Prices are reasonable here (including their wine list), and service is prompt and professional.  Tables turn over fairly quickly, but there seems to be a constant line-up once dinner hour begins, so plan accordingly!  However, as this is a family friendly restaurant, there are often strollers parked near the door obstructing those waiting for a table and those leaving after their meals."}
{"text":"This place is terrific. The whole menu is great and the bar is always fully stocked with European drinks as well as the Canadian fare. The pizzas are worth the trip over to st Clair. However the pastas are divine. The meats and fish are presented magazine quality. Great place to visit with the family and friends as well as on that special date."}
{"text":"I am definitely a fan of this place, which in my opinion, has the best pizza in the city. They have a wood-fired oven in their kitchen...this place is the real deal.  On my last visit I had the Pizza Campagniola, which is topped with tomato sauce, mozzarella, spicy Italian sausage, roasted red peppers and grilled eggplant. It was so delicious and savory accompanied with a bottle of Peroni, their house Italian beer. The only time I can eat an entire pizza is at Marcello's because it tastes so darn good.  The atmosphere is sometimes boisterous, but that seems to be because they are more family oriented at certain times of the evening. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Let them talk you into a slice of their amazing tiramisu. You'll fall in love."}
{"text":"Went to the Vaughan location .....The pizza is good!!  It's full of flavour with a thin crust!  The antipasto appetizer is huge and a meal in itself .... definitely delicious for 2 to share!  The place gets packed and the wait time is kinda long, but well worth it!  We enjoyed our meal very much.    The service was decent but could use some improvement.  The entrance gets swamped and is a bit disorganized, being so popular...they definitely need more staff to deal with the overwhelming crowd!  Overall it was good!"}
{"text":"Tiny little place with GREAT FOOD... I recommend the Fiorellini Fanstasia which is a big portion and they don't chince on the meat...   Pizza is really really good as well... take your pick, they're all good..."}
{"text":"First of all, I have to give it up to the waitress that served us. She was amazing! I do not recall getting her name, but she had really short hair and was positively the nicest person in a restaurant I have ever met. It felt like I was coming over to my family's for dinner. So relaxed!  Now, to the food. I ordered the bruschetta pizza to start with the friends, and of course a glass of wine, and then I ordered fettuccine al salmone, and lastly a latte. The pizza was alright, I've had better bruschetta on some flat bread. The salmon fettuccine though, wow. It is with smoked salmon, goat cheese, leeks in a vodka tomato cream sauce. Amazing. One of the best pasta dishes I have ever had.  Lastly, the music stopped playing in the restaurant and they go full out for your birthday. The music changes to happy birthday music and embarrass you in front of the whole restaurant. Great place for birthdays I guess?  I enjoyed my slice of red velvet cake (courtesy of la rocca) with a nice latte. Again, amazing."}
{"text":"Marcello's is a great neighbourhood restaurant. It is always busy, and I've never been when there isn't a line. It is worth the wait. The staff are friendly, but can be stern. Like if you question how long the wait is, or if you are blocking the exit while standing in their skinny waiting area. It can get pretty loud with all of the people, but that is sort of their atmosphere.   The specials are written on a black board at the back, so if your server doesn't tell you them, you are left straining to read them.   Every pizza and pasta I have had is good. The calamari is lightly battered - crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Everything is very fresh tasting.  I've never had dessert, but it doesn't look like there is anything homemade. There is a case at the back with desserts that are brought in (cheesecake, mousse ect).  Overall this is a safe bet. It is a good place to bring people because the food is good and they seem to have something for everyone. The service is fast, but they don't rush you (even when they have a line out the door!)"}
{"text":"pizza, veal sandwich, seafood platter all are hard to beat, great selection, prices reasonable"}
{"text":"The food is downright peasant italian, and this is a place that italians go to eat, so it's gotta be good...  they had stewed rabbit on one of my visit's that my partner had and loved it  - meat fell off the bone and the sauce was flavourful and hearty.  Others had pizza, always a fave, and someone else had tagliatelle.   All the portions were well worth the price."}
{"text":"I've lived in this area for a year now but usually opt for eating at home due to the fact that I'm on a budget and can be pretty picky (I'm slowly branching out and trying new foods!) but my boyfriend and I decide to treat ourselves every once in a while.  We've only been to Marcello's once, but I can say with confidence that it won't be our only visit! Great food and service. Huge portions. We shared a delicious pizza (can't remember which one, but it had goat cheese, spinach and sun dried tomatoes on it) and Caesar salad. I'm often hesitant to order salads when I go out because they sometimes lack flavour, the lettuce is usually wilted, etc. But this salad was AMAZING! Perfect amount of dressing, flavour, etc. I've never had a better one from a restaurant. The desserts looked amazing, but we were so full as it was, we could barely make it home (which is just up the street).  We ended up taking most of the pizza to go. If you live in the area, you've likely seen pedestrians carrying a Marcello's take-out box. The place is packed every night of the week. We went on a Friday night and the food came out a lot quicker than expected judging by the business of the restaurant. The only thing that was a bit of a wait was getting the bill, but anyone who complains about that (or waiting in line to be seated) in a packed eatery (on a weekend night, no less) should stay home.  The people seated beside us had children with them. The server was really great with them - she took the time to acknowledge them and cater to their needs, which is often overlooked in a fine dining restaurant, especially during a time of utter chaos.  Prices are more than reasonable, given both quality and quantity. Again, if you're complaining about that, stay home. I've worked in the industry and am a firm believer that if you can't afford to eat out (AND TIP WELL!), you should hit up the McDonald's value menu or fend for yourself. Or maybe choose an appetizer and water over a three-course meal with wine.  Boyfriend suggested dinner out somewhere on St. Clair tomorrow night. I'm in the process of researching places because I'd like to try somewhere new, but I doubt I'll enjoy it as much as Marcello's."}
{"text":"The pizza is good, wood oven pizza is like nothing else.   However the service is lacklustre. Each of the servers is an Italian character, loud and in your face. I just want to walk in and buy a pizza, I don't want trite conversation or to be accused of smelling like drugs, why because I am coloured?! This is presumptuous.   But in the end the pizza is worth it all"}
{"text":"Went back for pasta.   My DC ordered off menu and asked for a cabonara-- not a problem. And it was delicious.  I ordered the spaghetti with cherry tomatoes, sausage, rapini, and spicy tomato sauce.  Hugely generous portions, great service this time, not busy on a week night, and each dish was ~13$. Outstanding!"}
{"text":"Nice Italian food with good prices and generous portions. Whats not to like?"}
{"text":"Love this place! Family or date night, it's our go to when we want good food but don't want to drive far from home. Fried calamari and mussels are a must try. Price is very reasonable for the amount and quality of food you get, we are never disappointed. Thanks Marcello's for being so tasty."}
{"text":"We love Marcello's as a dependable local spot. I wouldn't travel across town for it, but for neighbourhood families it's great. Pizzas are amazing, thin crispy crusts - I love the speck and arugula, kids love the margarita.  No, it's not pizza Libretto but there's usually nary a hipster to be found, just good food served quickly without much ceremony. They also offer smaller-portions of pasta for the kiddies; the gnocchi is a favourite of ours."}
{"text":"I liked the place... it is a little noisy and tables are close to each other... but the food is fantastic, Cesar salad, pasta bologna, pizza eggplant and goat cheese , pasta chiken and pesto were excellent... ... it is crowded even in the middle of week"}
{"text":"Amazing, amazing, amazing!! The food itself was phenomenal and the service was great! Being a vegetarian and eating out with a meat-eater, I was worried that sharing a pizza would be a hassle but they were so willing to make any adjustments to make my experience more comfortable. I'm an avid pizza eater and this is the best pizza I've had to date. Cute location on St. Clair with a charming patio to people watch. I definitely recommend it. Prices are reasonable and the pizzas are great for sharing! Yum!"}
{"text":"We had a pizza alla Campagnola and a seafood pasta. Both are very delicious, especially the pizza. It blows my mind. I think it's one of the best in Toronto. It's not exactly the trendy Neapolitan style, still the crust is very thin and chewy. The toppings just perfectly match with the crust. The cappuccino we had after dinner was one of the best I've had in Toronto. The dishes were served fast and the service was friendly.  I'll come back for sure if I'm in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Too bad one of the brothers that owns the place is one of the most deplorable human beings on the planet. Simply because of his personality and the way he treats people including his staff  I have boycotted this place for 10 years."}
{"text":"Tasty pizza and pleasant service. Marcello's is unassuming and though there are other places in Toronto that make better pizza than Marcello's but there's all kinds of attitude, and sometimes a wait of several hours that go with it.  Probably worth a try."}
{"text":"Visited Marcello's after noticing consistently busy throughout the week. We were warmly greeted upon arrival and seated after a short wait.  - The atmosphere is exceptionally friendly and positive; staff are quick to the table and very attentive. - Our server was very knowledgeable, and great with recommendations - Food was exceptional; easily some of the best wood-fired pizza in the city, and for very reasonable prices  Cannot recommend this place enough if you are in the St. Clair West area and are looking for awesome wood-fired pizza in a vibrant setting.  4 people; Dinner, Drinks and Dessert ~$120 + tip; worth every penny.  I look forward to dining at Marcello's again"}
{"text":"I was told this was the best pizzas in Toronto and it certainly lived up to the hype. Prices are reasonable considering the quality, the only suggestion I have is the place needs to be bigger!"}
{"text":"Marcello offers a good menu selection and great service. Food quality is very steady, some items like the fried calamari are always on my food items craving list. The pizza is enjoyable. Overall a safe bet."}
{"text":"After reading the other reviews I can see Marcello's has been consistent. We shared the mussels which came with a tasty rich Marinara sauce. The bread with that sauce,  with some olive oil along with the red wine made it so we barely had an appetite when the entree was served. Unless you skip one of the courses, there is little chance of an appetite for the desserts, which would have made the experience better - the desserts looked very good. We wanted to have big portions of hearty Italian food, and Marcello's delivered. The service was fine since it was easy to get the servers attention in the one room restaurant with tightly spaced tables. There was a wait standing at the doorway for a table on the Friday. Nothing seemed overpriced and we will go again except maybe order pizza instead of pasta."}
{"text":"I guess it's four stars if you consider what neighbourhood you're in?  I'm not sure.  It was very standard food, standard service and I'd even venture to say less than standard ambience....so I'm a bit dumbfounded by the reviews.  Food:  grilled calamari appetizer and caprese salad.  Serving sizes were correct.  The sauce on both was identical.  A bit strange.  Under salted/seasoned as well.  Mains were linguini with shrimp, and pizza w proscutto and arugala.  Points for offering parmesan cheese.  The mains were very average, no complexity of flavours, the pasta (like, the actual linguini) had the same flavours as something I'd make out of a box at home.   When the server opened our bottle of wine, she filled both our glasses to the top right off the bat--no swirling, no sniffing.  Just here ya go.  If your'e going with your family, and you live in the neighbourhood, I guess this is a good option.  Since I don't have a family, and I live far away - I won't be going back."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise!    We were walking the St. Clair strip on Labour Day and found most things closed.   Heads hung low, we were about to give up when Marcellos came into our view.  It was like the universe read our minds and produced exactly the kind of restaurant we were looking for.  Marcellos is laid back, warm and hopping.  We were seated quickly, and the service continued all evening to be just right - attentive but not over eager and fast.  I started with the grilled calamari, which was cooked perfectly - not a rubbery tentacle in sight.  Just slightly charred, tender flesh on a bed of greens with a nice balsamic reduction to complement.  For our mains, we had the primavera pizza and the penne arrabiatta.  The pizza had luscious whole sun-dried tomatoes that were quite sweet, unlike the salty bits you sometimes find on pizza.  The salty green olives were a great combo.  Pizza crust was thin and chewy - really great.  Pasta was a little less interesting.  The sauce was quite spicy, but pretty one-note.  No depth of flavour or roundness that a little butter might offer.  The pasta was also a bit over-cooked and clearly of the dried, rather than home-made, variety.  But we didn't care.  Marcellos doesn't pretend to be fine dining, it's a family restaurant and an excellent one at that.    We will definitely be coming back often.  Vegetarian Score: 7.5/10.  Some interesting options and lots to choose from.  Vegans will have less (as usual) but veggies have good variety."}
{"text":"The pizza lived up to the yelp hype.  I had one with tomato sauce, mozzarella, mushrooms, green peppers and pepperoni, my fianc√© tried a \"white pizza\" with asiago, prosciutto and arugula.  It was so delicious I couldn't stop eating.   Only downside to this place is it's crowded , noisy and a bit too family friendly-- not the best place to bring a date"}
{"text":"Wow. Wow. Wow!! This place is the best. Service is crazy good. Fast. Attentive. Wonderful staff. Feels like a good ol' family restaurant with great food, great portions, that's reasonably priced. One of Toronto's best!"}
{"text":"After all the amazing reviews, I'm a mite disappointed.  First of all, service is fantastic. Everything came very quickly and the servers are friendly, attentive and pleasant.  The food was fine. The deep fried calimari was very good. The Hubster ordered a grilled chicken salad which he liked enough, and I ordered my standard: penne all'arrabiata. The pasta itself was not as al dente as I prefer (and usually experience in other spots) and the sauce was just okay. It wasn't very spicy and I had to add salt, which I nearly never do when I'm out. The portion was great, though.   The prices are absolutely fantastic for the area, but if I'm on a night out, I'm okay with paying a few dollars more for something a little better.  We got there before 6pm and were seated right away. Anyone who came after had to wait in an increasingly growing line."}
{"text":"Landed at Marcello's on a Thursday night because my kid wanted pasta... we got there at 6:30 and to our surprise we got a table right away!!! It started to fill up by 7 pm onwards. We tried the pasta special spicy sausage rigatoni with grilled vegetable in a roasted garlic/olive oil toss and goat cheese on top of that!!!!! Fabulous  penne ala vodka ... so tasty.... caeser salad and pizza diavolo.... everything was great again!!! Also had room for 1 bite of tiramasu.... mmmmm homemade goodness!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best Italian restaurants in Toronto + Kids Friendly."}
{"text":"Absolutely great. Shortest review you have read. Be happy eat and bathe in hot oil. Very busy here and rightly so.  Good value very well serviced. They know what they're doing here and it shows.  This Is one of those restaurants that you can tell everyone it's working very hard but it is run with passion and diligence"}
{"text":"Marcello's has tasty Italian food and great value.  The calamari is a bit greasy, but very tasted.  The pizza tastes like it is home made and has a nice crust. The pasta is very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch today with our two preschoolers.  Fantastic thincrust pizzas, delicious aranchini, and lovely service were highlights of our visit. We'll be back soon. This is a real find for us."}
{"text":"I've been here twice already and every time I think about the food my mouth waters for more!  My latest visit was the best one overall. The spaghetti al pesto was delicious! It was full of flavor and the presentation was just awesome. The service was good and it wasn't that busy at the time but I did come in around 430. Great prices for the portion sizes you get and a definite yes to coming back to this place! Maybe next time I'll give the pizza's a go!"}
{"text":"This is quite the lovely Italian pizzeria! I can tell that there are a lot of regulars that come here as well. The food is great, I had a shrimp linguini dish and shared an appetizer of fried calamari which both tasted very fresh and flavourful. Our server was very nice and we weren't waiting too long for our food. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Our local favorite Italian place! It's always busy on the weekends but worth the wait. Try the mussels or the veal chop, my two staples that I rotate through. See if you can sit in Darcy's section, he'll keep you laughing the whole time....definitely try the homemade tiramisu as well!"}
{"text":"Excellent choice if you are looking for a pizza style like Europe.   All of the pizzas are made fresh in a stone oven. It's about $16 including tax for a pizza and generally more than enough for 1 person   I have only had the pizza and calamari. I should try more but I know this is amazing so I get it every time."}
{"text":"Great neighbourhood spot for Pizza or Pasta.  Family friendly in the early dinner hour.  They have a wood burning oven for the pizza.  Their pizza is really good thin crust.  The wine list is very limited.  No reservations, so the waits on Friday nights can be a little long."}
{"text":"Casual, good value, neighborhood Italian.   Pastas are decent. Not the best. Not the most authentic I've had. But overall good flavors and well prepared.  Linguini de mare (seafood) was extremely fresh. The penne alla vodka was heavier and the leeks barely showed up.   Homemade Tirimasu was a great finish."}
{"text":"Customer service was out of this world. The servers were appropriately attentive, full of charisma, charm and of course, very resourceful. I would consider going back just for the great service we had.  Unfortunately, I don't really see myself going back anytime soon. I don't think too highly of paying over $15 for under-cooked chewy meat AND pasta topped with an underwhelming bland tomato sauce (mine was Tortellone alla piemontese, his was the Fettucine de farro http://bit.ly/1JHFmfL). I suspected that the pasta wasn't housemade and the server confirmed it (and I appreciate such honesty which is why I added an extra star). By the rubbery and lumpy texture of the chicken I'm guessing some of the meat is cooked from a frozen state. After being so spoiled at Nino D'aversa & Panino Cappuccino, it was literally hard to digest this unauthentic & completely lackluster Italian pasta (I had to bag it \"to go\" along with the disappointing mish-mash of a soup which barely resembled the so-called minestrone I ordered). Sadly, the wine was no better and could not save the meal (I don't recommend the Italian Merlot off the limited wine list nor the California Cabernet Sauvignon which was the selected wine of the day).  To end on a plus, we enjoyed the desserts we shared - the lemon sorbet and chocolate tartuffe. Also, their thin crust pizzas and tiramisu dessert look very promising - perhaps I should have gone for that instead. Of course, the upscale and romantic decor, the intimate terrasse and the overall familial atmosphere made the dining experience a tiny bit more pleasurable. I just wish the food was on par.  I hope the family business and the three brothers in charge of management decide to bring back house-made pasta. They could at least consider doing it for dinner service on the weekend or by request....I just don't agree with the excuse that they're skimping out on food quality because they're \"too busy\".  FYI: Reservations not accepted. Went on a Sunday around 4:30pm. Wasn't busy at all - only about 3-4 tables in use at the time."}
{"text":"Went to Marcello, their pizza is one of the best pizza i ever had. Thin crust made in wood fire over with goat cheese and spinach.   Their pasta was fresh, olive oil delicious.   Only one complaint is waiters were not very welcoming. I'll look past that and will definitely go back."}
{"text":"We were in Toronto visiting our daughter who lives close by this restaurant and looking for something for dinner. The pizza is so good. We all ordered different pizzas and every one of them was good.   The restaurant is very busy but with good reason the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Very popular in the area. We went on a weeknight and there was a line-up out the door. We were seated within 15 minutes and although the restaurant was packed you didn't need to raise your voice to have a conversation with the people you were sitting with and didn't feel like you were eavesdropping into everyone else's conversation.  There is a stone oven in the back so all three of us ordered pizza. We were all very satisfied with the quality of the pizza. One of us ordered soup as an appetizer and received a good size, hardy bowl with tons of vegetables. Prices are average at about $10/entr√©e and the pizza was a size that I felt full but not overly when we left.  If you are looking for good, everyday Italian food, this place fits the bill."}
{"text":"Ate here again tonight. They aim to please. It's not fancy nor is it pretentious. Just solid good food and service. When you come here you know what to expect. It's not high brow but always decent and good value. We've been coming here for ten years and never had a bad experience. Service welcoming and food comes quickly. They do a great Caesar salad and periods are very decent"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out while I was out in Toronto for work. I really had no idea where to go and I didn't have smartphone/internet so I ended up here. It was a good choice considering the fact that I was in the mood for pasta and they had pasta any where from 10 to 20 dollars. They also had several specials on the blackboard at the back of the restaurant.  After narrowing down my choice of pasta to 3, I had to ask the waitress for some help. She suggested the secchi and I went for it. It definitely came out as I expected and the taste was up to par as well. It is a little bit more on the heavier side since it is stuffed pasta.  The service here was excellent as well. I was well taken care of and the service was prompt and friendly. The atmosphere was lively as well. Definitely recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"We tried Marcello's for the first time last week and are very impressed!  We had grilled calamari, Caesar salad and two pizzas (\"Diavola\" and \"Positano\").  Service was very friendly.  We arrived at 5:00 pm on a Friday evening and by 5:30 pm, the place had filled up.  There was a short line at the door by the time we left around 6:30 pm.  Family friendly and it seems there are many regular customers.  I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza! I'm not a fan of muscles but my parents say that they also have the best muscles (all about the sauce with ingredients that my mom still can't figure out). It's very reasonably priced, and super cheap considering how good the food is, but the lineup is proof enough! They don't take reservations so you have to either be lucky or wait 15-20 minutes for a table."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for years and have always enjoyed their delicious homemade pasta. Spaghetti alla Pugliese, Penne Arrabiatta, Grilled Calamari, assorted pizzas & fresh made Tiramisu."}
{"text":"I've been to both locations now and both are fairly busy - depending on what time you visit, of course!  On a Sunday afternoon, late lunch, the St. Clair W location was quite packed.  A young male waiter with long hair and glasses spotted us and recognised that we wanted something quiet, so we were sat right next to the kitchen.  At first, I thought it was weird, but he was right, it's actually the quietest table in the restaurant!  Feels kinda separate from the busyness upfront...until you hafta scoot around people to head downstairs to the washrooms.  ;)  Ordered the grilled calamari, quite good.  (I would've preferred the breaded version, but I was *trying* to be healthy.)  And for main, the Primavera pizza ($14) was shared.  Due to the toppings like sundried tomatoes & olives, the pizza was on the saltier side, but still didn't feel too heavy because of the thin crust.  Aside from the really thin crust, what sets their pizza apart is also their CHEESE!  They use really good, chewy quality mozz, yum!!!  Service was very pleasant, mainly due to the waiter who seated us.  His personality was very upbeat and understood my needs which added to the experience."}
{"text":"although an Italian food lover, I wasn't overly excited over the Bruschetta which, I found a little bland and like Kraft dinner in this Italian restaurant. The bread however, was a little dated and the Balsamic Vinegar tasted like cola. I ordered a Fazoletto filled with cheese; Goat and Ricotta; Very heavy and yet again, slightly bland due to minimal tomato paste. On the other hand, service was very good and prices; Reasonable.."}
{"text":"it's come to my attention that torontonians wouldn't know quality italian food if it kicked them between the eyes. a growing line out the door & rave reviews by fellow yelpers was enough to persuade my wife & i into checking this place out on a saturday night...& we instantly regretted the 80 bucks we dropped. calamari was tough & rubbery, poorly breaded, & bland as all hell. my wife's linguine con gamberi included inedible, overcooked shrimp, a foul-tasting sauce, & undercooked pasta. my gnocchi had an affable tomato sauce, but the actual dumplings were a chore to chew through. even the wine tasted like a cheap bottle you'd buy off the $4.99 rack at a corner store. i'd bump my rating up to 2 stars if the servers didn't bring our food to the wrong table & award us with the distinction of being the only patrons without water. maybe we should have tried the pizza?"}
{"text":"Dropped in for lunch as we were in the area.  Spaghetti Bolognese was quite good.  Pasta properly al dente.  Wine prices are very decent.  Service was very good.  My nephew was well treated.  A fine little neighbourhood spot."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with my friends on a Friday night so it was a busy night. We waited about 20 minutes for a table so it was not too bad but service was kinda slow and rude. We were still waiting for some other friends to arrive to order but the servers seemed annoyed so we felt pressured to order our appetizers right away.   The pizza was only okay. Nothing compared to pizza libretto. This place is kinda small as well and all tables were very close together."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great price. This is our default Italian eatery in this neighborhood. Been to a couple other places on St. Clair but the quality of the food for the price is incomparable to Marcello's. Big, heaping portions, fresh ingredients, and friendly service is what you can expect. Their calamari with side ceasar salad is amazing, along with their pastas and pizzas. Anything with rapini is my favorite."}
{"text":"Maybe they changed the chefs here, they refused to cook my usual order of seafood pasta with garlic cream sauce, so I opted for mussels and calamari instead. The calamari was a bit on the bland side, and the mussels were sandy and quite a few did not taste fresh. I think I'll stick to the pizza next time."}
{"text":"Considering all the excellent reviews, I must have had a one off bad experience. We went on a Friday night, and had to wait for some time for a table.  The service: Don't know if they were short-staffed or what, but the staff was not at all friendly, and almost had the attitude of doing us a favor by giving us their opinion on the 1-2 dishes we asked about.  The food: I don't think I have ever eaten heavier or greasier Italian food than this. My partner and I both ordered pasta dishes, and I now wish we had ordered pizza instead. His dish (linguine with chicken, spinach and tomato sauce) was tasty, but quite greasy. My dish (linguine with shrimps and tomato cream sauce) took greasy to a whole new level. After a few bites I started feeling uncomfortable and belching. Then I noticed grease floating all around my  linguine, and drained 9-10 tablespoons. Since I was full with only a few bites, most of the dish went untouched. Taste was decent.  The wine was good on flavor and price (White Zinfandel since we wanted something light).  Total bill for 1/2 liter wine and 2 pasta dishes - $51  All in all - the food would have been good if it wasn't so greasy, and the wait staff could sure use a lesson in smiling and better service. Wouldn't go out of my way for this place."}
{"text":"Service was terrible and it is unfortunate because the food is actually quite good. My understanding is that this staff have been there a very long time so it seems as though they don't care about customer service anymore. Will never go back to this place because of how we were treated."}
{"text":"A friend once told me a pizza stone is the secret behind great pizza bread. im going to bet they use a stone here. Bread tasted flawless and i came in on a full stomach. ok i've only tried this one pizza here called Terra (Roasted potatoes,sweet pancetta, red onions, mozzarrella, with spinach) but im going ahead and say that this place is in my top 3 pizza joints in Toronto. great value pizza and friendly service, usually lots of parking on the street. only thing i should point out is its shallow wine list. i think a solid pizza place should have a deep wine selection"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times already and, except for the last time, the service has always been great and super friendly. The pastas are amazing, the tortellone with prosciutto and cream sauce is mouth-watering and the seafood linguine was delicious as well. The serving sizes are always great and you can always order extra bread to dip in the sauce, yummmm! i've never ordered their pizza, but really want to try it next time. It is the best Italian restaurant in town within its price range. Oh, desserts like their tiramisu are excellent. No wonder it's always packed on any given day."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a friendly, casual, and affordable neighborhood italian spot, then look no further.  Pasta is decent, but doesn't seem home made. Pizza is a better option. Service is great and they are very accommodating with children. Desert has always been Tiramisu, but we assume the rest are fine too. No surprises, no letdowns. Generally great every time."}
{"text":"Went here for a friends birthday. The place was busy (as usual). We were standing in line waiting for a table. A couple walked in and a waitress immediately seated them. Having been waiting for minutes we were quite upset. The waitresses then avoided us. The food is pretty good. But service is awful. Do not come here if you are looking for family feel Italian."}
{"text":"Food mediocre. I suggest going across the street to The Big Slice... pizzas were burned. and the salad was a joke...$8.50 for argula & lettuce and TWO slices of tomatoes?!  Horrible service; waitresses non-attentive, had to call them several times to get attention. Wasn't given bread or oils like everyone else in the restaurant, had to ask for the bread and ask another table if I could take their oils (since they were leaving). When asked horrible waitress to box our leftover pizzas, she included the crusts and other pieces of food we were throwing out in the box.   I highly do not recommend wasting your money at this joke of a place."}
{"text":"Favourite restaurant in the city, bar none.  The food is fantastic: definitely not \"factory food\". Pizzas and salads are great; fav is Caesar salad, then pizza primavera.  Only downside is the lineups and the fact that they don't take reservations."}
