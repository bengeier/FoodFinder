{"text":"This a fun experience for all skill levels.  I've had many golf lessons over the past 20 years but Thom, a PGA Master Teaching Pro, is amazing.  He makes it easy to understand and works with you on an individual basis and doesn't try to change everything.  Best golf instructor!  The facilities are super clean and the caf√© is a great place to relax after a round or lesson."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go the guys who work there are awesome and the course is really fun to play and it's a grate price I would give it 6 stars if I can"}
{"text":"Outstanding experience. Excellent service as the others stated. Thom, the Master teaching pro makes the difference. He is an expert in diagnosing technique problems and gives precise instruction and drills that are easy to understand. See Thom if you want to improve your game."}
{"text":"I wasn't going to write this review until I spoke with the lady working here, she listened to me about the rude group behind me then said she wouldn't give me a deal on a second round or a bucket of balls. ( mean while the guys behind me are sneaking in a second round ) this experience was pretty bad. The middle of the fairway was flooded like a swamp on 3 holes. The greens keeper just threw all the tee boxes to cut the grass but on one hole they were completely missing. This is disappointing since this course is waking distance away. I hope they change their attitude.  the staff, players, course and the range are all below par"}
{"text":"Excellent course. Everyone is friendly and the pro shop is well stocked. Great value for your dollar. I recommend this course for anyone. Glen Lakes is the place to be."}
{"text":"Tom, the manager, has put a lot of time and effort into this course.  I have played here over 20 years and it is in the best condition ever!! The staff are friendly and helpful.  Tess even loaned me her clubs one time when I drove off without mine.  The biggest improvement is the the condition of the greens.   Tom also gives lessons and when he offered a special deal, my friend and I took one.  He is an excellent teacher and really helped me improve my game.   If you are looking to spend a couple of hours playing golf please consider this course. I just wish regulars would get some discounts on green fees and carts, like a punch card."}
{"text":"Played this course with my daughter and I   was mortified at the condition of this course...it was like an abandoned course that someone was collecting fees for!!  The range is in such disrepair it made me sick!  Had I NOT promised my daughter we would go out and play....I would have never stayed....btw did I mention this fiasco of a course cost $40 for a 10yr old and myself.  GROSSLY disappointed!!!!"}
{"text":"I just wish they would cut the grass and pick up the leaves. Other than that, it would prove to be a nice round. There should not be three inches of grass right off the green. And where they do cut, they should pick up the clippings. Expect to lose a lot of well hit balls"}
{"text":"For the price (18 for 9 holes and half a cart it wasn't bad). Make sure you bring your own alcohol because they don't use the bar anymore. They seemed to be fine with us bringing our own. Super awesome employees. Course was a little ghetto as well as the neighborhood but it was ok. Carts didn't work great but again for the price it wasn't bad."}
{"text":"I adore Glen Lakes. I have been just playing golf for a little over a year and love meeting up with my father here for a fun nine holes. The price for nine holes is a bargain! (Winter or Summer - it's always a steal) Dave the golf pro is fantastic, I took several private lessons with him and he has helped me improve greatly. He also organizes a monthly scrabble, which is always fun to participate in. Overall, this is my go to executive course for price and fun. This place really is a gem."}
{"text":"I went and checked out Glen Lakes Driving Range and Golf Course this past week, and plan to go again once they finish their overseeding.   Importantly, this review is exclusively related to the driving range giving I have yet to play the course.   With that being said, the customer service here is awesome. Upon walking in the pro shop, the man behind the counter (I believe he was the Head Pro and/or Manager), was noticeably nice. He was personal, asked questions, knowledgeable and through and through seemed like a very nice guy. I was pleased to be greeted in such a kind way.   In regards to the facility, my perspective may be skewed giving I was there just a few days before they overseeded. However, the prices per bucket are relatively cheap, and the range is standard. It is a mat only range that also has several makeshift greens placed throughout the range that makes for nice target practice. Also, there is an overhead yawning that keeps this sun off the golfers on the range.   My only critique is that the mats are old and worn out. It is difficult and abnormal to hit off a mat that is nearly the mailability of wood. If they bring in new mats and do a good job with the overseeding, this place would receive a 5-Star review.   Nonetheless, if you're in the area, Glen Lakes makes for a great practice session or quick 9!"}
{"text":"Great greens and never have to wait. Got new golf carts with a usb plug in which is awesome. Friendly staff no complaints and I've been here the past 5 Saturday's in a row."}
{"text":"After a year or more playing here they have decided to no longer accept credit cards. This I feel is unacceptable in this day in age which almost all places accept card. When told they only take cash I asked if this was send via their almost daily email that I receive. The response I got was \"oh you get those?\" Some sort of announcement would have made for less of a shock. The course is ok considering it's 19 bucks however they did increase a dollar and they don't accept cards."}
{"text":"All of the reviews of Glen Lakes are right on the money.  It really depends on how good of a golfer you are and what you're trying to experience.  This is quaint little course, it's actually gotten better the last couple of years.  The place is old but shows a ton of pride of ownership.  The price is right, the management is great and without the ego that other courses offer.  If you go in the morning, look for Mel.  94 years old and out there five days a week, gentleman's gentleman and he hits it straight down the fairway."}
{"text":"Awesome club centrally located in West valley - nice staff, fun events glow golf was fun. Took a bunch of 1st timers here, everyone had fun and staff was great."}
{"text":"Well it's been almost a year since I have played a round, after a year hiatus. I'm back!!! This is my first course in Arizona, a friend and I decided to play after work. Place is not bad, especially the price. I have played much better muni courses in Cali! But after a year, I was still happy! Great place for kids to start, and all beginners. It's basically a flat course with some water. Greens are a little hard, and well a lot of divots. Fairways are in bad shape, but this is what you get at a muni course. Overall I had a lot of fun, and probably play here more after work."}
{"text":"3 1/2* Glen Lakes GC Nice 9 holes golf course Recommend taking a cart Friendly staff Well-cared for greens 3 sets of tees A little water"}
{"text":"Course is poorly maintained and they over charge. Should close course and just try and take care of their driving range which is the only thing people go for."}
{"text":"The staff here is outstanding. The course plays well year round, and the instructor taught me how to hot my long irons in 30 seconds, while in the middle of another lesson. Great multi-tasking."}
{"text":"Glens mistake's is a hackers paradise so don't go here if your shooting scratch golf dude. Other than that it's a very nice course to play, my only cons are that the trees flake off a lot of debris, and there is a lot of mud thought the year. Fun to play while drinking with friends, and a solid 9. Check it out if your a beginner to average player or just want to have a good time."}
{"text":"Glen Lakes is a nice hometown golf course you might want to try out!  Golfers love the layout of this course that has (6) par fours.  It is a challenging course and allows you to use more clubs. The 9-hole golf course is also good for beginners. .. If you have been thinking that this would be a good time to introduce your kids, grandkids, or the neighbor's kid to the game of golf, Glen Lakes has a deal for you. Kids 16 and under play for free when accompanied by a paying adult.  This deal is offered Monday - Friday all day or Saturday and Sunday after 12 pm.  Call  623-930-1111"}
{"text":"Not bad for a quick 9 holes. Perfect for practice or just a mid week game with the boys."}
{"text":"Honestly I passed this place for years and never even knew it existed. I've wanted to start hitting some golf balls for years and wondered why there weren't any ranges nearby me to do so. Little did i know there was one tucked away 3 miles from me on Northern. Wanna practice your putting? Come on down. Wanna hit some balls really far? Come on down. Wanna play a round of golf? Come on down. The clubs they let you rent seem a little old, but they get the job done. You can rent a ton of balls for just a few dollars and take out some frustration, which is exactly what I do.  This place is great."}
{"text":"The holes are longer and more challenging than most 9 hole courses. They have no shortage of par 4s. The pro shop gentlemen (probably the owner) was extremely friendly and made me feel very welcome. I don't really expect that considering most will look down their noses at you. I booked online and got a good rate, they gave me a good deal on the replay as well. I'm surprised I hadn't found this place sooner. I'll definitely be coming back. Although there seem to be no shortage  people who drive in circles around the course honking at you during your backswing."}
{"text":"A nice beginners course. The carts are gas powered which crack me up cuz it's like I'm sitting on top of a lawn mower. What I love is the price, the course layout, and the cheap food!"}
