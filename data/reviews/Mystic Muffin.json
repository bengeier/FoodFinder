{"text":"Boasting great chicken potato wraps for only five dollars, and an extremely good lentil soup, Mystic Muffin is one of my Toronto staples, partly because of Elias, who's a really nice guy. This all together creates a fantastic atmosphere and great place. But the APPLE CAKE IS AMAZING! It's actually so good it's unbelievable. So mystic muffin gets a five out of five."}
{"text":"I have seen the stellar reviews of this place many times here and on other review sites, so I finally decided to check it out.  Simply put: I don't get it.  This place has so-so food (the falafel was pretty good, the salads were meh, the apple cake was decent, and nowhere near as healthy as some people think it is), and the owner is over the top--in a bad way--and even publicly berated his poor staff in front of me.  I normally don't write negative reviews, however because I saw so many positive reviews with almost nothing negative, I really felt I had to provide some counter-balance.  Will not return."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It is difficult to find as friendly and memorable service anywhere else in downtown.  For example the wraps and the cakes are just delicious! No wonder this place has so many fans and they run out of food sometimes. The mystic muffin man is wonderful and makes you feel really really welcome, really. I should actually go there more often!!"}
{"text":"Best. Falafel. Ever! Amazing service - amazing apple cake and I can't wait to go back and try everything else..... Amazing !!!"}
{"text":"Came at around 10 am- think Elias just opened because it was empty when we came in and he made us feel his freshly baked loaves haha.  It's a quaint and comfortable place with nothing extra; perfect for the busy hustle that will happen later during the day. I read about this place on yelp before I went, so I knew I had to try the apple cake- nice crisp on top and bottom, with moist cake and nice apple chunks. It was good :)  I appreciate the effort Elias puts into talking with the customers, and after sitting there for 10 minutes and more people coming in, you already know who his regular customers are.  Glad he has such a love for the food he makes and for his customers! Will be back to try his $5 sandwiches"}
{"text":"super friendly.  fresh.  simple.  great value.  this is one of my favorite places to eat.  the food is not fancy.  it's simple middle eastern food that is made well.  it is always fresh and the prices are very reasonable.  the owner obviously takes care to ensure quality is consistent.  the place is a bit out of the way.  think that's one reason why not more people know about it.  it's a bit far from the financial core.  there is no parking directly on the corner where it is located.  it sort of is in the downtown core but not really in the core.  but trust me this is a hidden gem.  the owner, Elias, is awesome.  he's friendly and knows most of his customers by name or at least knows that they want.  i barely have to tell him and he knows what i will order.  decor is fun.  old school retro tables and chairs.  bright window seating.  the place is always super clean.  the owner obviously takes care of it.  this place has been around for 20 years which is pretty amazing.  i love supporting this place.  there are fancier places around but this place never disappoints me."}
{"text":"This unassuming little restaurant was a fabulous find during my short visit to Toronto from California. The very friendly owner was quick to greet me and start up a lovely conversation before recommending an egg pita sandwich for the 11 o'clock brunch I was seeking. The sandwich, loaded with egg, potato, hummus and veggies was absolutely phenomenal and was only matched by the delicious apple cake that I got to accompany it. I highly recommend this place for anyone looking for delicious, reasonable food and a very welcoming environment fostered by a man who really seems to love what he does and is eager to share it with others."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp couple months ago. Best apple cake ever. Service is great. Got a free slice of cake when we went. The chicken potato sandwich is good but I prefer the falafel sandwich. Such a unique place. Promised myself I'd drive from Mississauga just to eat the food again."}
{"text":"Amazingly friendly guy.  Coming from the states I didn't have cash (card only) but he insisted I take the food anyway and could pay next time.  Falafel sandwich and apple cake was great.  Awesome service !  If only more restaurants would treat their customers as houseguests."}
{"text":"The falafel sandwich is the best on the menu and totally a treat to watch make. The owner and his wife and so generous, very chatty and often give out free desserts!! They're just kind souls. Definitely get the spicy powder on your sandwich."}
{"text":"apple cake did not disappoint it was delicious i will be back for sure"}
{"text":"At first, when I heard people working about going to Mystic Muffin, I thought it was perhaps inappropraite to be discussing \"mystic muffins\" at work. lol  But soon I went to try out this little place, and was blown away. They have a lot of healthy options (try the Lentils and Rice, only available two days of the week, tuna, the eggplant or potato wraps! )All the prices are SUPER cheap. The owner is a chirpy dude, contantly talking to his customers, making them feel welcome, asking about their days, recognizing the regulars. He even has a \"recession plan\" for regular customers, If you lose your job, you can eat one meal a day at mystic muffin until you find another job! I dont know the fine details, but c'mon! I've never heard of such an offer before.   Mystic muffin, is the go-to place for end of the month broke lunches, or just healthy lunch. This is a great little independent place with a BIG shot of personality!"}
{"text":"I always prefer to have meals at small classic family  owned restaurants.  Their lentil soup relieved my uncomfortable feeling caused by stomach flu.  The owners are very friendly."}
{"text":"We went to Toronto for the weekend to celebrate our 1 year anniversary and saw the Museum, St Lawrence, and the Islands.  All great.  Right up there with them is Mystic Muffin.    I originally thought we'd share a piece of apple cake (as we were going to the market afterwords).  It was so good that I got another.  The falafel was excellent too; possibly the best I've had.    Better than both was Elias - he was warm, engaging, and down-to-earth.  As first time customers, we got the first piece of apple cake for free (!!!).  The food quality alone is 5 stars.  The freebie takes up another level.  But his genuineness was the best.  Thanks Elias; we'll be back for more next time we come."}
{"text":"Do not go to this place unless you want to be mugged. It is in a run down area next to a Salvation Army homeless shelter. I constantly had homeless guys coming up to me asking for money. There is also a black male who is always there asking for change and when the traffic has stopped on the road adjacent going up to people in cars. Not worth risking for apple cake. To be avoided. There are more better places to eat at in Toronto in better neighbourhoods."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great price and most importantly, made with love. You need to order the apple cake."}
{"text":"A wonderful place. Charming man behind the counter sparked up a conversation...it's nice to know there's people who have a heart in the service industry still. Chicken wrap hit the spot. Prices can't be beat!"}
{"text":"Very unique place and funny and kind staff! I do highly recommend the apple cake! The best ive ever ate!!! The prices are fair aswell! When you go there try the banana bread too :)"}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in Toronto, hands down. This is not just a restaurant but an experience in how great capitalism, when done right, can be. Elias and Juanita have so much soul and humour. I come there for lunch whenever i can, although i work 20 minutes away. Great falafels and soups and cakes etc etc. Strongly recommend this place. cannot recommend it enough!"}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough! Great prices, generous portions and awesome lunch packs served with love. A true sense of warmth when you walk in to this family run business."}
{"text":"Elias, the owner, is a genuine and personable. His apple cake really is legendary. The prices are very reasonable. This place is a real gem in a city ridden with starbucks and other chains at every street corner."}
{"text":"The apple cake was really the best I've ever had. The falafel on the other hand wasn't in the same league. Dry and bland maybe I was just unlucky."}
{"text":"Walked into this fantastic little shop with no cash, was told to pay next time and got a chicken and potato pita with complementary apple cake. The food was great and got to read his story written on the wall. Amazed and humbled thanks Elias!!"}
{"text":"Incredible atmosphere and owner!  A truly unique spot.  Ordered egg on a bagel.  Solid."}
{"text":"This is my first review that I am giving for any website !!  Thanks yelp for making my stays amazing !! I know I can totally depend on you to find the most amazing restaurants anywhere i go !!   Elias is amazing !! He is  a marketing genius atleast in his profession !! and yes ,the free apple cake is true and it tastes gr8 !! I picked up a salad platter which was really good !! and pretty cheap at 7 (tax incl) but more than the food,it is the experience which will make you come back !! atleast i know,i will !! Its even close to my office"}
{"text":"Elias is a fantastic salesman and my new best friend. He remembered that I bought a banana loaf from him a year ago. So I bought another one. Along with a deliciously hearty soup and a pretty good tuna pita, all for $14"}
{"text":"How do you like them apples?  I can tell you that I certainly like them in Elias' famous Apple Cake!  Moist, apple-icious cake baked with a perfect crumble topping is a temptation that is hard for anyone to resist.  And yes the rumours are true - first timer's are handed a very generous complimentary piece.  Mystic Muffin is a breakfast-lunch joint with personality... Elias and Wonita's personality.  The duo will make sure that any stranger who walks through their doors is no longer a stranger when they walk out.       As for the other menu items - because I have been spoiled with the availiability of fantastic Middle Eastern cuisine in Ottawa, I can't honestly say that the rest of the menu would keep me coming back.    ...but for some delicious apple cake that is so good that it must be forbidden?   Definitely."}
{"text":"The blueberry banana bread was so moist and fluffy on the inside and had a nice crisp exterior. The contrast was perfect. The smell was devine and this both beats and reminds me of the banana bread my mom bakes at home. I can't say the blueberry taste was that strong, which was fine by me since I like regular banana bread.   The Apple cake was moist and crunchy exterior. It was a bit sweet for my liking and could have used a bit more cinnamon. It's like the Apple version of the banana bread but softer.   Coffee is weak and a bit tasteless but I wasn't expecting amazing coffee anyways. There's always Fahrenheit coffee across the street for that."}
{"text":"No, the name of this place doesn't refer to Jennifer Love Hewitt's vajazzled vajayjay. I'm not sure how it got its name but that's just one of the many questions I have about this kooky little deli/falafel shop, like: - How can everything be so cheap here? - How do they pay the rent? - Why does the chalkboard menu look like Russell Crowe's conspiracy diagram from A Beautiful Mind? - Does our trash really get sent to Michigan?  This place is inconveniently located for me and the food alone wouldn't be a draw but it's the owner, Elias, who I'd travel to see. This guy is a real character. He'll chat you up like you're long-lost friends and tell jokes that'll make even the most PMS-ey Eastern European with jacked-up Brit chompers sport a big toothy grin.  Then there's all the writing on the walls. When asked about the \"Super Wonita\" on the menu, we're told, \"Wonita asked for a raise and I said to her: You want a raise or a sandwich named after you? She chose the sandwich.\"  Other little zany gems I found: \"Extra toppings cost more unless you bring it from home.\" \"WASTE: Michigan Bound\" on the trash bin. \"It's a pita we're leaving -- we really falafel.\" (Huh?)[1] \"All above items includes GST - Stories free - Advice - Worth a camel\"  If you go, get a falafel and throw in some homemade hummus and smushy lentils. It's a massive sandwich that is tasty and filling--but reconsider if you have to sit through a long meeting in the afternoon since the contents are highly legumous. I should also warn you that the optional spice is really spicy. I tried to find out what it was and Elias told me it's LOVE. So, I guess sometimes love hurts.   But you really can't get any cheaper than this: a falafel + egg & cheese on a bagel + a bottle of juice came out to $9.50. Since Kat F. brought me as her friend, I was entitled to a free hug but Elias gave us each hugs AND a free slice of apple cake!   BOTTOM LINE: You can get some ridiculously cheap eats here but you're really going in order to experience a wack-a-doodle Toronto institution. Elias is a role model for business owners. We could all do with More Quirk and Less Jerk around the city. ==================================== [1] O.M.G. I just got this!"}
{"text":"My husband raved about their apple cake so I decided to check it out.  I went during lunch with a colleague to grab a quick bite and decided to get 1/2 an apple cake for an afternoon meeting.  The lunch was very filling and the soup was tasty.  The cake was out of this world.  It went pretty quickly at the meeting and everyone was asking about it.  I'm not sure if I'd walk the 15 mins to get lunch but I would definately walk it to get the apple cake.    Friendly service and genuine hospitality was refreshing  as I think is often hard to find in this city.  If you're in the hood definately stop by.. and please don't forget the apple cake."}
{"text":"Came in for the first time today to try the popular veggie platter and apple cake! They both lived up to and exceeded my expectations. The serving is huge for what you pay (was able to eat it for two meals) and has so much variety- fresh salad, rice, pasta, chickpeas and more! Like the other reviews said, I got a free slice of apple cake too since it was my first visit, which was just as divine as I was hoping. I now know where to come when I'm craving dessert (the apple cake is sold by half and full sheets too).  Elias seems funny too and really well acquainted with the guests, which is refreshing to see in this city! Will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"I can only echo what so many have said here - this place was great.  Food: had falafel sandwich, cabbage salad and FREE apple cake because it was my first time (I'm from the States). It was incredibly delicious, on par with the best I've had. Cabbage salad was nicely spiced, a good helping but not too much. Apple Cake was WOW - never had anything like it before.  Service: just like they say, \"Friendly\" was the key word. Elias obviously cares a lot about his clients, and seeing a whole bunch of regulars come in showed that.  I only have 3 more days left in T.O., I may just eat here each day."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the apple cake! It tastes homemade. Reading all the reviews below, I have to try the food as well! Can't wait for my next trip. The owner, Elias is an amazing person to meet. Very friendly, even to a total stranger. I don't think I've ever met someone quite so trusting."}
{"text":"The owner is worth the price of admission by himself, but the food is a nice little bonus. We came in for breakfast and had a good bagel and egg sandwich and some coffee. What set the place apart was the fantastic hummus and the banana and apple breads.  A+ all the way. Go check it out and enjoy your visit. Reminds me of a Seinfeld type place, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I finally gave this place a try after several years of walking by it - thanks to the Yelpers to assuaging my skepticism. The name and look of the outside reminds me of some shop in Amsterdam.  I got a combo for 7 bucks including tax - lentil soup, falafel, and apple cake (upgraded from a cookie for free since it was my first time).  Apple cake - lives up to the hype. Sweet, soft, substantial but not heavy...mmm...5 stars  Lentil soup - fresh, delicious, mmmm...4 stars  Falafel - balls heated in microwave; toppings were dry...OK sandwich...2.5-3 stars  Had a nice chat with Elias throughout my meal - adding a star for the niceness and the prices...  I don't want to overstate my experience, but for a very cheap, good, no frills, friendly lunch...don't hesitate to go here"}
{"text":"What more can be said?  DO: Get the potato chicken on a pita  DONT: Get there late because they run out of food."}
{"text":"Amazing place!  Great food, great prices...but its the story of a man, his hard work, amazing attitude and continuous work ethic that makes it a place like no other in Toronto.   He asked my name...and remembered it 2 weeks later when I went back.  My hat goes off, and he is a true inspiration. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This little shop is so cute and quaint. I walked in and was immediately made to feel welcome. With all the combos available, I got slightly confused so I finally told the owner to 'surprise me with what you have'. He went on to compose what he calls 'his best sandwich' - chicken potato with eggplant and a million other toppings. I got the soup combo and a free apple cake (yay!). I proceeded to take a seat in-house and sample the fare. FYI, the diner is smallish yet cozy - I could totally spend my time in here reading a paper and sipping a tea.  Boy, was I surprised at how GOOD this sandwich was. I did not expect the explosion of flavors or the smoothness of how everything melted together. The spiciness of the potatoes was just perfect! I wanted to tear it apart to see exactly what he threw in there but was afraid of not being able to wrap it back together. Everything was soooo FRESH as well ... as for the apple cake and soup - they were great too. But after eating the sandwich, I just couldn't take my mind off how perfect it was. I must return. And soon.   No pics. Sorry. It is really the inside of the wrap that counts anyhow. And you can't see the inside. You will just have to come to Mystic Muffin yourself to experience it first hand."}
{"text":"I have lunch here everyday it's the best!   Falafel wrap, chicken or Tuna wrap delicious!  Beef patty or bagel with... Everything you can imagine and just $5!  This place it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"Delicious, great food (I got a simple toasted bagel with cheddar and tomato, don't know how it was SO DELICIOUS), fair prices, great service. I would go back every day but this is on the other side of the city for me! 5 stars."}
{"text":"The owner is so nice, and the cookies are great, not too sweet. Highly recommend for a snack or a light lunch."}
{"text":"More than just muffins!  There isn't much more I can add to the existing reviews.  They've really said it all! I went in last week for the very first time and they were so nice and so cheap.  When I got home, I immediately indulged in my delicious falafel!  I've been back a few times since and the service and quality has been consistent."}
{"text":"I felt obligated to try mystic muffin as it is near my neighborhood and I've heard good things. I went to have bagel, which was just ok. I also ordered two pieces of the apple pie which did not disappoint. I will definitely be going back to try their other baked goods"}
{"text":"I really wanted to know what made this muffin so mystic, so one day I walked into this low-key storefront. Immediately I felt a wave of good vibes envelop me as Elias greeted me and my partner. He offered us a piece of Apple Cake, and we immediately downed it and bought another. It was probably the best thing I've ever tasted....right now I'm craving another slice (or loaf!) We spent a bit of time giggling at all the cute puns and funny messages written all over his menu while Elias chatted with us.  Since that day, whenever I'm in the area I stop by and say hi. Elias is always a total darling, and his witty sense of humour is really a delight. He remembers everyone that comes in, and greets them with a warm welcome. I've seen him turn customer's grumpy faces into big smiles with his positive energy and silly jokes.  The falafels are amazing, as is the lentil soup, the baked goods, and probably everything else. Food cooked with love and good intentions always tastes better, and this is one place where you can really tell that the chef is putting his heart into each plate.   Elias' Mystic Muffin is a much needed ray of sunshine in this seedy area. This man is truly an inspiration, and that apple cake is iconic."}
{"text":"I've eaten enough Mystic Muffin to give an honest review. I use Elias for alot of catering at work and I've sampled alot of the food he has on the menu.   It's true about the apple cake. It is unreal. I've eaten it countless times and it always tastes amazing.   The falalfel is great and the sandwiches are excellent. If possible, try the potato and egg plant wrap. Sounds weird but its an amazing vegetarian dish.   On a final note, the owner Elias is a hard working and amazing individual. He always has orders on time, and is such a nice person. He is passionate, jokes around and is always in good spirits.   Great price, fresh food and an amazing owner. Mystic Muffin is worth the visit."}
{"text":"Mystic Muffin is not a restaurant or brunch place.  Seating is very limited and there are no tables. Had a chance to go there numerous times to grab a quick bagel before work or a tuna wrap during lunch time. These are good quality but you will get fed up very soon - the menu is extremely limited. I had the tuna wrap & falafel over and over, and in the end I just felt fed up and dying for something new.  The owners are friendly when they see that you are first time customer - they are chatty and will offer you a piece of \"famous, must be legal eating age\" apple pie for free, (which is nothing special by the way), however if you keep coming back, once they remember you they will start  to harass you to buy a slice of pie every time - I got the impression that it's not really a big seller, but on the contrary they are trying to get rid of it by all means, especially if it's a holiday season. They will ask you \"if your wife is making an apple pie and that you should by all means buy theirs instead\". Don't get me wrong - the owner's \"humor\" is well intended - however it's over the top, trying in vain to be funny by all means, which is not really my cup of tea. The only good original joke is the \"Michigan bound\" on the trash bin.  Oh, and did I mention the location of the place is shady, and avoid the park around it that some of the reviewers mentioned, since you will be harassed to give a change every five seconds or so...."}
{"text":"This place is more than a restaurant or business. This place is the owner's very heart, soul and passion. That is reflected the moment you walk in the door. People talk about the apple cake.... yeah it's THAT good. We bought half an apple cake for $10 (what a deal)... and it was still warm out of the oven when we bought it... amAzing. The chocolate chip banana bread... also THAT good. We have enjoyed many places so far while visiting Toronto... but this place is a special place and we will make it a POINT to visit more than once before we leave back to the States. The owner cares very much about each and every customer that walks through the door. That is a rare thing in this world now!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious and so reasonably priced! I had the veggie combo with a slice of Apple Cake. Everything was fresh, tasty and delicious. The apple cake was amazing! They have a nice variety of items on the menu and the owners are very friendly and helpful, not to mention their sweet daughter Stella who joined us for lunch! Love supporting local businesses that take pride in what they do and want to make sure you have a positive experience!"}
{"text":"Good food at a very reasonable price. You can get a healthy and yummy platter for 8 bucks."}
{"text":"Very nice and friendly owners, best place to get a delicious breakfast bagel, apple cake and coffee anytime of day."}
{"text":"Falafels to die for. And an owner who trusts you just as much you trust him, which is a lot.  Bring cash. Though you won't need much of it."}
{"text":"omg!!!! 5 Stars cannot do justice to this place. The owner gives this place its uniqueness and beauty. Right in front of me he forgave a customer who did not have money to pay for his meal. Not only the owner a great human being the food he prepares is awesome. My wife and I had chicken salad, chili, falafel and apple cake. Everything just hit the spot and it was honestly The best apple cake I've ever had in my life. It was -39 Celsius in Toronto but the warmth of the owner and the food made me forget the chills of the outdoors. I'd recommend this place to anyone any day"}
{"text":"Went for lunch with my wife and ordered a chicken salad sandwich (pita), Veggie plate with soup, blueberry banana bread and apple cake with a peach snapple. Total was $20.  Pita was tasty and the falafel in the Veggie plate was excellent.  Some of the best in the city. Veggies on the plate were just OK.  Came with garden salad, coleslaw, potatoes, chick peas, and  hummus.   Owner asked if it was my first time and chatted us up a bit. He told his wife to give us the apple cake for free. Super nice guy.   The apple cake...Omg. So good. Nice crunchy crust, moist cake and not too sweet.   I'd go back just for the falafel and apple cake!"}
{"text":"the falafals are good.  The chicken salad sandwich is really good value.  The customer service is great.  Overall, great value for the food"}
{"text":"Went for an early breakfast on a weekday.  Saw some positive reviews here and it was also a seven minute walk from our hotel.  The place does look a little dive-ish, but it looked clean.  We ordered take out and ate in the park near the store.    I ordered the toasted bagel with cheese and tomato and my friend ordered the apple cake.  I only took one bite of the apple cake, and it was pretty good.  The top was nice and crunchy and the inside was soft.  The bagel tasted fresh and the toppings were good."}
{"text":"as fresh and cheap deli can get in downtown Toronto. This place is great!"}
{"text":"This review is JUST for the apple cake.  It was friggin' great!  Half apple pie and half coffee cake, warmed until the sugary top gets a little crunchy and the gooey middle gets a little melty.  I know it's not a word but you know what I mean.  You MUST eat this warm.  I'm in Toronto on business from NYC.  Wasn't overly impressed with the hummus or falafel but they were serviceable (3 stars).  My wife did not enjoy the garden salad with chick peas and cabbage.  Oh well.  The Elias guy does seem like a character but none of that matters.  All that matters is the apple cake.  So good.  Go get some."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to check out Mystic Muffin yesterday for the first time, and like most- I was impressed.  I got the full Elias treatment which was wonderful- he made sure to ask my name, where I worked, and told me about the restaurant, including pictures on the walls and child cooking classes.    I picked up a hummus to go, and it was very, very good.  The free first-timer apple cake is everything you've heard and then some- moist and amazing. What a great place that lives up to the hype- good food and lovely people."}
{"text":"After trying to come here twice and finding them closed, we finally got to try mystic muffin this weekend! The guy is just super friendly and quirky, and the menu was overwhelming, but I went with what I saw the most often on yelp -- the veggie combo. They don't make rice and potato on the weekend, so my plate came without, but it was a huge serving so I was okay with it. My partner got the tuna salad sandwich on pita (combo). The guy was very friendly and gave us 2 slices of apple cake instead of a cookie for one of he combos since it was our first time there (and he did it to another new customer too), which made us very happy since that's what they're known for! AND who doesn't like free food.  Now onto the review of the food. I started off eating the salad, and for about 5 minutes, it was just a salad-- not bad, nothing special. Then I had a bite of the falafel. What in the world?? It was SO delicately crunchy. The texture of the crust is a mixture of flaky (but not big chunky flaky.. tiny, delicate flaky) crispiness that is indescribable.. It was SO good, and I don't even usually like falafels! And the hummus! My food experience seriously went from meh for the first few minutes to oh my god (that escalated quickly). The wrap was just okay, and so was the cookie. The apple cake was pretty good -- i don't usually like cooked apples, but the cake part was moist and flavourful.   I just found the place endearing overall. The story on the wall gives his story as an immigrant, and the other wall is covered with photos of his family. It's a true, old, neighbourhood business that you don't find much anymore nowadays (oh and not in a 'hipster' sense). I hope they're able to stick around for a long time."}
{"text":"I f@%&in love this place. It's so kitsch but the food is great, the owners are amazing and the apple cake is to die for.    I have lived so close by for years and it's a shame I only discovered it last year.  The veggie falafel plate is so good. I love a meal with a ton of options.  The lentil soup is amazing, the wraps are great. I love everything about this shop."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews about the infamous apple cake, I had to try it out for myself and I'm glad I did! Atmosphere: It has an old school diner type of feel that's clean and inviting.  Service: the owner, Elias, is genuinely a nice guy and just wants to take care of his customers. Take a seat and let him tell you a story or two. Food: The pumpernickel bagel was delicious; crispy on the outside, chewy and warm on the inside. The apple cake was amazing; fluffy texture with a crunchy and chewy top - definitely a must try! A guy came in while we were eating and bought a while tray for his sister cause she loves it so much.  Tips: Elias talked us into buying a whole loaf of his blueberry banana bread saying that we will not regret it. He was right. I am currently sitting here writing this review while having a toasted slice of the banana bread with my tea (what Elias suggested)."}
{"text":"This place is completely alright, but not amazing - in fact I would rely on lentil stew which they don;t have every day so it's just another 'meh' place I rarely go. The famous cake is fine but again, don't understand the hype. I'm glad other people like it and it does well. We need more and better home-made fast food in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a good falafel place near Ryerson and thanks to recommendations here, tried this place out. I've been here thrice in just as many days. I am addicted! The falafels are so flavourful. The pita with falafels + eggplant with all the fix-ins (don't forget the spice) tops any cafe or takeout place around. I've been trying different sides, too. The spicy potatoes aren't anything special. Pretty dry, although I ordered them when they were closing, perhaps they're better earlier in the day. The minestrone soup is OK but the portion is really small for the price. It's watery yet filling because of the veggies and pasta. I'm a vegetarian so this place is great for me.  Also...the apple pie. Fantastic."}
{"text":"How mystic are your muffins?  I haven't seen anyone here eat a muffin, but that famous apple cake sure is magical!  As a first time customer, they give you a giant slice of warm apple cake.  Not too sweet, moist, and pure yumminess!  For lunch, I had the combo of the day.  It was $6.99 for a hell of a lot of food.  Cabbage salad, green salad, lentils, falafel and hummus...and a cookie!  The lentils were delicious and all the veggies were crisp and fresh. The falafel was tasty, not the best I've had but still pretty darn good.  Elias is one cool cat.  Super engaging and friendly with each customer, it's not a surprise that this place is so popular and people keep coming back!  ~Elias Quote of the Day~ \"The food is hot, like me!\"  One of the best cheap eats places in the city, guaranteed! =)"}
{"text":"I travel to Toronto on a regular basis. I found this place on the net, and just had to try it on my visit July 2010. Worth the trip, and not too far off Yonge. We both ordered pitas, and walk to the park just a block away, to enjoy the weather. The pitas were great, and the apple cake was the best apple cake ever...EVER! We almost stayed an extra day so we could bring back a couple full size apple cakes. The place is closed on Sundays, and closes early on Saturday, with a limited menu on Saturday. If you can, I would try to visit this place during the week for more options. This was the least expensive meal we had during our stay, but the one I enjoyed the most. Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"The owner is super nice! He was so nice to the homeless man: give them food at a good deal or free.  From the set up of the shop, i guess he also involved in a lot of community activities with his store. Cute!  He gave you a great deal as you are the first time customer. Remembers your name so fast, very smart business man! Very funny as well, make jokes all the time, engaging the customer 100%  Chicken potato sandwich was great! Lentil soup was good too! Apple pie was amazing~  I was stuffed after spending $7  Will definitely go back and try muffins!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite spots in Toronto. Elias is amazing. He is the owner and the face you will see when you walk in. He will remember you after your second visit. He is friendly, talkative, and the last thing he would want to do is rip you off. Extremely hard working guy who is just trying to make money for his family.   Do not mistake the outside of this place for the inside. It may look like a dive (sorry Elias!) but it's anything but. It's unique.  The best way I can describe this place is small town in a big city.   The Good  1. Elias. Like I said above, he is exceptional.  2. Food. Delicious food baked by Elias daily. There are even discounts for older goods.  3. Coffee. It's just drip coffee, but seriously it's amazing. Some of my favourite in the city. 4. Price. Everything is a great price. You will feel like you should pay him more (Toronto mentality).   The Bad   1. Hours. Because he is the only one working, the hours are not the greatest.  Recommendation: biggest coffee he has with a piece of apple cake."}
{"text":"Mystic Muffin is one of my favourite cheap eat restaurants in the city! I love their breakfast bagel deals (the $5 ham, egg and cheese fills me up right to lunchtime) and the owner is a super nice guy. I come here on a regular basis on my way to work and have never been disappointed.  In terms of lunch dishes, there are a couple of sandwich options (falafel, chicken salad) and either chilli or a soup option. There is also a salad bar and the prices are again pretty reasonable. Everything is tasty but basic, so don't expect it to knock your socks off.  There is plenty of seating inside and the owner's $5 banana loaf is perfect to bring back to work and share with your colleagues. Definitely not the best lunch you'll ever have, but the prices are very reasonable and the service is so good you'll keep coming back!  Make sure you let the owner know if it's your first visit, he will offer you a free slice of apple cake to take with you!"}
{"text":"Family run joint...I like these Mom and Pop places. I finally had to try after walking by so many times and reading all the funny signs on the outside walls. Good vegan options. I tried the vegan plate which came with small portion of three dishes, pretty good. Nothing stood out as amazing...have yet to return. Although, I think the desserts are what people come for. The owner did try and sell me a loaf of bread and some apple cake, but I don't eat sugar so it was a no sell."}
{"text":"Because my friends and I were too hungry (and impatient) to scope out the gigantic and extensive menu, we all had the falafel sandwiches, and one of us had the minestrone soup.  We didn't see hide nor hair of the owner, so that was a bit of a letdown.  The falafels were average - we all had had much better elsewhere (see \"Sarah's Shawarma & Falafel\", \"Falafel World\").  Even thought the falafel balls were \"nuked\", they still weren't hot.  The minestrone soup was lukewarm and mediocre.  It was the first visit for all of us, so we did receive the free apple cake, and it was very good and much appreciated.  Definitely a nice touch, but the disappointing food, and absence of the owner, kept this review at three stars.  I may be back to sample other menu items."}
{"text":"Great food for low prices !!! Good wraps, falafels, lentil soup.....Their Apple Cake is incredible!!! Owner is very friendly and this place is truly one of its kind !!!"}
{"text":"Truly a gem of Toronto! Almost a whole in the wall, very unassuming, but this is a great place to be. If not for the delicious veggie platter and fresh flavours, then for the great people who own the place. Elias is a lovable character who remembers all of his regulars and greets first comers with free apple cake (delicious)! He is such a genuine kind and entertaining man, not to mention efficient at getting through the lunch rush! Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this, very simple setting but atmosphere is great.  As they advertise, you can feel the love and caring they have for everyone. Had a fantastic lentil soup, best I have ever had and very spicy, nice fresh bagel to go with it.  My partner had a chicken salad wrap which he really enjoyed, and a slice of their famous apple cake which he was very happy with.  While we were there, we listened to the nice man behind the counter and his interaction with everyone was pleasant and caring.  Some good daily specials.  While I was there some other guests told me about their apple cake, which actually seems to be their most famous and delicious meal. Others recommended the beef paltry and the chocolate cookies with their original coffee. Very simple place, great simple food, go in when you are a little down and you will come out happy!"}
{"text":"Go there.  Healthy, tasty, generous, and owned/operated by a sweet and welcoming family. What else do I need to say?!  We stopped by as tourists and it was a relief to have a regular healthy meal not unlike what we'd prepare at home. I'm sure local business people appreciate being able to stop by here for lunch."}
{"text":"FatCat just eating banana cake and thinking \"this banana cake sooo good\" when he remember where he get this banana cake - Mystic Muffin. So FatCat come to Yelp to write this review.  FatCat remember having long and interesting conversation with Elias (owner of Mystic Muffin) about his olive trees in Lebanon, his love of making hummus, and how much satisfaction Elias getting from simple things in life, like having loving wife, and raising child. Then FatCat go home with two falafels and chocolate chip banana cake. Elias even throw in some free apple cake for FatCat's friend who not make it to store because of broken leg.   FatCat and friend very happy.  SIDE STORY: FatCat hear on CNN this morning that world facing global shortage of very rare commodity.. something called compassion.  FatCat thinking to himself \"Hey FatCat.. You smartest cat I know.. Why you not solve this problem yet??\"  Then,... answer hit FatCat like Mack truck...  Very easy to solve this problem..  So today, FatCat start helping people in need. Give some change to homeless man, help old lady crossing street, make funny faces at crying baby on subway, make sure FatCat nice to people having bad day. FatCat thinking \"doing this every day should solve problem in few weeks... tops\"  You thinking \"Hey FatCat.. how I can help you with this??\"   Easy... Just do like FatCat"}
{"text":"Good bagels for breakfast for about 4$. The guy working there runs the place by himself, impressive!"}
{"text":"This is a small independent place, food and service are great.   Lots to choose from, nice family style place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"This place in incredible!!! I love the atmosphere here, the owner is full of life and just makes you laugh. The food is incredible. I got the chicken and potato sandwich and pasta salad and chick peas and it was all awesome. Healthy, fresh and awesome prices. And they're banana bread is to die for. It may not be in the best area but it's definitely worth stopping by!!!"}
{"text":"Great local business. Get the apple cake, it's worth it. Trust me, I walk from Bloor down Jarvis to Mystic Muffin just to get this apple cake during my lunch hour - that's how much this apple cake is worth it."}
{"text":"Very fresh, warm out of the oven. Didn't have Canadian he gave me a slice for free. Thank you sir and it looks like your reviews are well deserved!!"}
{"text":"Based on Yelp's Review and the convenient location. I thought i would just drop by and give it a try. When i got there the place felt very cozy, clean and really friendly! The owners had a smile on their face when I asked about the Apple Cake. So i decided to grab a slice and the Apple Cake was so good! Tasted very fresh, warm and good amount of apples in my slice! I'm definitely coming back here and trying more things! I LOVE YOU MYSTIC MUFFIN!"}
{"text":"I came here during the lunch hour on a Friday, and the place seemed relatively busy with regulars. The restaurant had a quaint bakery/deli vibe, and the owner made an effort to be friendly with all of his customers.  I ordered the veggie platter, which included 4 salads, hummus, two falfels, rice, potatoes and an option of a pita or cookie ($9.50). The food tasted fresh and had good flavour.  The restaurant also carries muffins, sandwiches, salads, wraps and soups, among other items. There's also a small seating area for customers to eat.  On the way out, I ordered a sausage roll ($2.50) as a snack for later in the day. The pastry was flaky but a little oily after warming it in the microwave - I should have toasted it instead.  Overall, good food at good prices. Another plus: listed prices included tax, which made it easier when paying.   Cash or debit ($0.25 added charge, however)"}
{"text":"Wow what a little gem of a shop in downtown Toronto. Went here because of a tip from a local who said their apple cake is a must try. Walked into this old time bakery with the nice man who likes to talk! Told me there was some apple cake that he needed someone to take off his hands. I told him that was exactly what I was in there for and he served me a huge piece for only $2.50. The cake was so moist and had a great balance of cinnamon, bread, and apple flavoring. Amazing little snack that is a must try if you're in the area. Be prepared for a conversation with the man behind the counter!"}
{"text":"The service here is fantastic. I have never left this place without a smile on my face.   I've only had the apple cake here but it is great. Nice crispy layer at the top and really moist and fluffy on the inside. Plus perfect ratio of apples and 'not too sweetness' that I really like.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Wonderful place, and Elias the owner is a really warm character. If you are looking for chi-chi then stay away. But if good food, great apple cake, a good cup of coffee and pleasant experience then this is a place you have to visit."}
{"text":"This place is a definite downtown gem, owner is super friendly and when me and my bf went the first time he gave us free apple cake which was the best I've had in TO and always fresh and warm. Prices are amazing very cheap and great quality. The deals  are great. The food is so amazing and service is always welcoming. Always worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Do not mistake the sub par exterior as an indicator of the inside, this is one of the best spots in Toronto for breakfast/brunch/lunch. They do an incredible veggie plate and all the combos are delicious.  The owner is an anomaly, outrageously friendly and remembers a face very well. However, the best review I can give is for you to just try it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place today due to all the great yelp reviews...   My first impression when I walked in was that the place was tiny, but I didn't let that change my option on the food. The staff were friendly and we're very inviting. But after looking at the menu board, I quickly came to the realization that nothing on the menu really appealed to me.   I ended up making a custom sandwich with potatoes, rice, tomatoes, lettuce, cabbage, some sauce and spices and got a spicy beef patty as well. Unfortunately there was no sliced meat (chicken, beef, etc.) to put into my sandwich, so I essentially ate a vegetable wrap. It was not bad, but not for me.   If your vegetation or like vegetation food, I would recommend checking out this place as the prices are cheap and the quantity is good. But if you are like me and want some meat in your sandwiches, I suggest looking elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've gone to school in the area for 2 years and have only just now tried out new places to eat in the area, this place was my first choice , although I was looking for shawarma this place satisfied my need for food, the chicken pita is great. The best part of this place is the amazing staff , they are awesome and very personable and professional. Will definitely recommend and come back"}
{"text":"SOOOO good!  Small, family run, modest, and freaking delicious.  Very affordable and the menu is packed full of good stuff.  Being vegetarian, this place hit the spot!    I'd definitely recommend getting a variety of stuff to try and I'd also recommend chatting up the owner if he's not too busy.  He has a great personality!"}
{"text":"Very nice owner, and great prices for a very unique middle eastern menu. The wraps are great, and I'd recommend everyone who goes there tries one, but the real reason I'm reviewing this place is the baked goods. Specifically, the apple cake. If you've never tried this, it's hard to explain, but imagine a brown sugar, cinnamon coffee cake mixed with an apple fritter. If that doesn't attract you, they have many other baked goods, but I've never tried them because there's only one dessert in my eyes. But based off the one I've tried, I'd trust that their baking ability extends outside the apple cake."}
{"text":"Best customer service, hilarious, fun loving attitude and the food is great! A fun one off experience or a daily one"}
{"text":"I visited for the first time on a Saturday.  It wasn't very busy and the owner seemed nice enough and chatted a little with my husband and I.  I ordered the veggie platter to go and was told that they didn't make rice or potatoes on Saturday so he would give me an extra falafel and extra cabbage chickpea salad instead to make up for it.  A little disappointed but that was fine.  What I didn't necessarily like was that he bagged a slice of apple cake and put it with my order and then asked me if I wanted it and that he would give me the special price of $1 for the slice.  I had read other reviews that he usually gave his first time customers (and he knew we were) a free slice.  Don't get me wrong I didn't ask for it nor was I expecting to get anything for free but I think it's a bit presumptuous to bag something and put it with a customers order and then tell them \"hey I can give you a great price for this\". In any case it was a bit awkward and I did pay for the slice.  Also, the whole time we were there he was pushing us to buy his last loaf of banana bread which I didn't like.  The actual food itself was okay.  The hummus which he makes from scratch is pretty good.  The apple cake was just okay.  Yes, it was moist but I've had better.  Not sure what all the fuss is about.  Anyway, I was a bit surprised at my experience at Mystic Muffin as there are so many rave reviews.  Maybe I just caught him on an off day.  Either way, I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto from San Francisco and heard about this place from a friend and had to try it out. Straight up healthy and delicious food. When you're traveling, you're stuck eating all kinds of things that aren't good for you, and this was a real godsend. Clearly, everything here is made simply and with plenty of love. The owner is full of goodwill and will make a friend out of the quietest loner. There's no way you will go away from his place unsatisfied. He (of course) offered me free apple cake, but I don't like sweets and declined. He insisted I take some free falafel and pita instead. I'm so glad I did. Seriously some of the most flavorful and tender falafel I've had in a long time. And the cabbage salad is pretty damn good, too. I'm going back before I leave Toronto so I can try everything else they offer. It's that good."}
{"text":"The owner is amazing. So casual, friendly and kind! Unfortunately, they don't accept debit but he was nice enough and told me to come back later and gave me my breakfast!   Building customer relations based on trust! I guess there's pros and cons to that. He was so nice that I immediately went to withdraw money and pay him. And mind you, he doesn't even know me. I'm not a regular. He does this with my coworkers all the time too!   The chocolate banana loaves are soooooo good! They bake them in house and he serves them fresh out the oven.   I highly recommend this place. The service brightens up my day and is a really positive start to my mornings. This place is a true gem."}
{"text":"Been wanting to check this place out for a while because of all the great things I've heard about it. I'm happy to say that everything I've heard is true! A small, cozy space not meant for a long stay, but great for grabbing a bite en route. I ordered the salad/falafel combo while the bf ordered the falafel sandwich with water and a slice of apple cake for dessert. The owner is super friendly and invited us to take a seat while he chopped some romaine for my salad. From the first bite you can tell the food is fresh and healthy! The salad dressing was light and flavourful while the falafel balls are the perfect combination of a crunchy exterior with a moist, soft inside. The chili powder has just the right amount of heat to give the falafel a kick. The apple cake... A slice of heaven that was gone within seconds. A filling and healthy lunch to kick off our Saturday for a little over $13 (the cake was complimentary since it's out first visit). Can't wait to come back! Planning on having a picnic lunch in the nearby picturesque St. James park sometime soon with food courtesy of the one and only Mystic Muffin!"}
{"text":"Decent food and good service in a very home-sy diner environment. As all of the other reviews suggest, Elias seems to be a fairly friendly and nice guy. However, my experience was only just standard. I would say I had an a-okay time but nothing was exceptionally outstanding.  The highly acclaimed applecake was definitely good but not the best that I've had. Then again, that might be because I am an avid foodie for baked goods."}
{"text":"Walking into Mystic Muffin is like walking into a comedy show. Elias and Wonita are quite possibly the funniest restaurant personalities in Toronto. Basically Elias does ALL the talking, and Wonita is the straight \"man.\"  I used to work just around the corner and my coworkers and I would go to Mystic Muffin for lunch almost every day. Elias made a point of remembering all of our names (even though he purposely called me something else--I can't remember what, but it was funny). We'd often order the falafel and hummus pita, but the main event was the lentils! They are a must have!  The other item of note (you really can't go wrong with anything, though), is the apple cake. Elias claims that it is the best in the world, and he's right. It truly is the best apple cake I've ever tasted. During the Christmas season, Elias often sets a goal for the number of cakes sold. A couple years ago he said that if they reached their goal, Wonita would get a bonus so she could buy a new living room set from The Brick. HA. I know I bought several--that I usually ate all by myself. I hope she ended up getting that new furniture.  When the recession hit, Elias offered his customers free meals if they'd lost their jobs--I continue to have TONS of respect for him because of that.  I highly recommend a stop by Mystic Muffin for anyone looking for top-notch Lebanese food, amazing prices (did I mention it's dirt cheap?) and a HIGH-lariously good time."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely a gem. Located just a few blocks north of the st Lawrence market. This is the best place to get an home made apple pie cake. The atmosphere is not pretentious and the people working there are really nice. It is cash only so don't forget to go to the ATM first. The first time I went there I didn't have any cash and the guy told me \"just take it and pay me later\" I was like what?! You might never see me again it was my first time, but the friend who was with me gave me some cash so I could pay without having to go out feeling like I just robbed the joint. They have chocolate chip cookies that are really good as well and also their coffee is not bad. You can try it and I assure you won't definitely be disappointed. Also you can get the cheapest bananas I have ever purchased."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I had to try this \"legendary\" apple cake.   The owner is friendly as people say, we started chatting about random things and he's nothing if not friendly.  Served room temp (he didn't have a warm batch in the oven), I was pretty excited to try this, as apple desserts (pie, crumble, cake, you name it) are a favorite of mine.   The cake was moist, tasty and had a great texture. I'd love if the top were a tad crisper on top (like a dutch apple cake/pie is), but overall it was a good cake.   I wouldn't tag it \"legendary\" as other seems to have, but it's quite good. I'd love to come in the morning to try one warm and fresh out of the oven.  A slice is $2.50, half a cake (6 slices) is $8.99."}
{"text":"My best friend and I got to Mystic Muffin right as the owner was closing. Thankfully, he still had some Apple Cake for sale. We had intended to purchase two slices...one for the each of us, but the owner convinced us otherwise. We ended up buying a whole sheet of the cake!!! We were worried that it would spoil before we would be able to eat it all, but the owner promised us that the cake would stay good for about a week as long as we wrapped it back up.   WE FINISHED IT IN ONE DAY.  Yes, it was THAT good, and yes, we are fatties."}
{"text":"Ive never tried a better apple cake and i couldnt imagine one, i would really recommend the apple cake as perfect (IN EVERY CASE). As it is the most famous food for this place i only rate it. The banana bread also deserves a clear 5/5. The muffins are delicious but to dry (3/5). I didnt try the sandwiches yet but as it is not housmade bread (kind of a shawarma bread, supermarket) i dont think they are special. Very nice people, you really get the feeling that when you like their food its more important than the money for them.  A BIT for the apple cake.  BIT = Best Imaginable Taste"}
{"text":"I feel like I can officially call myself a Yelp Elite now that I've been to Mystic Muffin.  I just started school nearby at George Brown College, so I tried this place out my first week there.  As promised, Elias is quite a character.  It wasn't busy on the Tuesday when I arrived around 1, so he chatted with me, asking what my story was.  I ordered a falafel, and was given a free piece of apple cake since it was my first visit.    As I was eating, Elias asked me if I eat lentils.  When I responded that I don't, he found that unacceptable and fixed me a plate for free.  So for under $5, I got a falafel pita, an apple cake, and a place of lentils (that were actually quite tasty, especially considering I didn't think I liked lentils).    The food was good, the owners are great, the location is convenient...but it's also sketchy.  It's right next door to a homeless shelter, and there was a woman who kept coming in and stealing V8 when I was there.  It was a bit of an uncomfortable situation for me, especially when she sat down across from me to eat my leftovers.  I don't know if that's a normal experience or if it's more of an exception.  Hopefully the latter.  All in all, I'll be back for the friendly service and affordable tasty lunch, but I'll probably get it to go next time."}
{"text":"I can count on one had the number of small businesses where the owners care more about their customer's than their business model. Mystic Muffin is one of those businesses. Without going into detail, this business owner treated their long time customer's and their first time customers like family.  While visiting on Holiday, we decided to stop by Mystic Muffin because it was near the hotel and because of the Yelp reviews. We're very glad we did. Some amazing food ... and even better customer experience. I hope this place is around for a long time."}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a banana loaf and some of their famous apple cake. At about 1:30 when I went there were only a few baked good left. Apparently this place is very popular! The cake was fresh out of the oven and was tasty - definitely the homemade-goodness I was hoping for.   The owner was very welcoming and friendly and the prices were very fair. Only two tables inside but there is a park next door where you can enjoy your baked goods."}
{"text":"Mystic Muffin is an office worker's oasis downtown. Independently run and maintained with lots of love, this quirky take out joint serves up falafels, wraps, soups, salads and baked goods all at amazing down to earth prices. Walk in and you'll be astounded by the chalkboard menu, it is literally crammed with items, prices and little phrases such as 'trust me, it's good' or 'recycle!'.   The wraps are delicious and cheap here and they also have a special 'better life' combo which is stacked with all the good stuff: lentils, cabbage, falafel balls and salad. Service is friendly and efficient, if you are a newcomer you'll be entitled to a free slice of their famous apple cake. Which is scrumptious. Goodbye Subway....hello mystic muffin."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after driving and walking by it since the 90's.  After reading the reviews about how good the apple cake was I decided to make the effort to try it this morning--I am so glad I did. The apple cake was everything other reviewers have said it is a delicious coffee cake apple combo.  I was tempted to get a side order of the cabbage salad to go--it looked freshly prepared.  But I will try it on my next visit--I definitely will return to try other items."}
{"text":"Oddly enough, I haven't had a muffin from this place, but here's my story.  I was starting a new job in the area and popped by Mystic Muffin around approximately 3:30pm, knowing full well a good chunk of the muffins could be gone, I didn't expect there to be NO MUFFINS AT ALL. According to the friendly counter-staff, a large corporate order swept up all the muffins around noon. I KNOW the apple pie is supposed to be phenomenal, but I was really craving a muffin.  Noting my hesitation to order anything else, I walked away with a free sample of the blueberry banana bread which was moist and sweet but not overly so, and nom nom nomed my way back to the office, satiated, but hopefully I'll be able to actually get a MUFFIN next time!   This place feels like time has stopped in an era before Starbucks and Second Cup, with real diner style tables and locals who love the hell out f this place and I think I'm a convert too."}
{"text":"I haven't tried their food food but you've GOT TO TRY their apple cake! It's a combination of bread, cake and deliciousness! You can't just stop at one piece so I usually get the whole cake for $18. Amazing deal!"}
{"text":"This place DOES live up to the hype.   On the corner of Richmond and Jarvis, the store front is a place you've always known and passed by, but you never bothered to stop in. I love this hidden gem!  I walked in, and immediately Elias asked me if I wanted lunch.  The whole experience gets 1 bonus star for him being super friendly and make you feel welcome.   I got my delicious falafel with all the fixings. It was $4 including taxes. Crunchy, yummy, and super filling.   As a first time customer I got the free slice of apple cake. And he gave me a HUGE chunk too! Yum.   He told me about the wall of fame. Buy a t-shirt, proceeds going to the cooking camp he runs every year, take a photo in any place in outside of Ontario, and he'll put it on the wall. For each photo, you'll get a free apple cake, I assume it's a whole one!  Or you can just buy this delicious cake - half for $7.99 (more than enough)or whole for $14.99 He also sells moist and yummy banana loafs (blueberry, walnut or chocolate) but he only makes 10 a day (in the morning) or 30 on fridays.  But I'm sure you can tell him when you'd pick it up, and he'll make it for you.   I actually ended up coming back in the evening to pick up a falafel for my boyfriend because  he was drooling hearing about my experience.  I got a t-shirt and half a apple cake, and he threw in a banana loaf slice too.   Elias makes all the difference with his passion and friendliness, and you get people who want to come back!   P.S. they do have muffins"}
{"text":"I live down the street from this funky bakery, but it took me about two years to finally venture inside and I tell you it was worth it! Yes, it's called Mystic Muffin, but muffins are definitely an after-thought; apple cake is the confection of choice. Be sure to converse with the friendly, quirky owner, Elias, and let him know it's your first time here. You'll score a free slice of apple cake that is sure not to disappoint!  This is a great lunch spot since it has a wide selection of sandwiches, salads and soups. The falafel is the most delicious, filling lunch you'll get for under $5. I've also ventured here close to closing time and scored some discounted, baked loaves that are great with butter and/or jam for breakfast. I have yet to try the muffins...  My only complaint is the hours - the place is closed after 5pm on weekdays, after 3pm on Sat and completely closed Sun. I kinda wish it was open later on weekdays so that I could stop by after work. What say you, Elias? Will you fulfill my apple cake fantasy?!"}
{"text":"Ahhh maaa gaaad! I'm in love...like the real thing this time. Oh ya, I got it bad for this Mystic Muffin! (Hmm...questionable phrase)  I'll keep it short since the 5 stars says it all: 1) APPLEE CAAAAAKE! 2) Don't even read the menu, just let Elias take care of you - and that he shall!  3) Sandwich, soup/salad/whatever, dessert, drink under $10 (CASH)  Healthy, unique flavours, and service to boot!"}
{"text":"Amazing little gem in downtown Toronto. Very welcoming owner, we arrived late so some of the items were finished, but no worries there's a lot of stuff to choose from!  Falafel and tuna pita sandwiches are amazing, fresh soup. Everything is made in house, nothing is processed. Fresh apple cake, that dessert everyone is raving about on here is as good as it claims to be. Lots of love here!"}
{"text":"Best Pita Wrap ive ever had. The apple pie is incredible as well. The owner is a gem, great service, served with love."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews and articles, I had envisioned Elias and I having a grand conversation, but he only asked if I wanted onion on my chicken salad pita.  He did ask twice since he forgot my answer the first time.  Maybe he didn't get enough sleep with the new baby.  There was a baby girl behind the counter and a beautiful woman (whom I'm going to assume is his wife) feeding her.  My first time here and I didn't a free slice of apple cake.  I had to buy my own but it was well worth the $2.50.  It was dense, cinnamony, moist, not too sweet, with chucks of apples and very delicious.    I came around lunch time and there was 1 person ahead of me in line.  After that, there was a constant stream of customers coming in, most sounded like regulars.  My $5 chicken salad pita was good (came with lettuce, tomato, onion and spices).  Quick, easy and fresh.  I was eyeing the samosa and beef roll, but wasn't sure if they would be good for a late afternoon snack.  There were plenty of room to sit and I ate my lunch at the counter overlooking Jarvis Street.  Update: My 2nd visit, I've made progress with Elias in terms of conversation.  I asked him about his favorite pita and he said he likes to make a chicken with eggplant but no onion.  I never had a falafel pita before, so I ordered one here.  AMAZING!  Very tasty and I highly recommend.  CASH ONLY"}
{"text":"In a seedier part of Toronto, but this little operation is worth the trip, not only for the entertainment value of both the personally hand decorated place and it's gregarious owner, Elias, but for the perfectly done Falafel smooshed in a pita with generous helping of hummus smeared on it. Feel down? The Apple cake fresh from the oven will cheer you up. In fact, while I was eating, a sad looking man stopped in and Elias said, \"Here, have some apple cake, this will chear you up.\" \"No charge\". I don't know if it cheared him up, but unsolicited acts of generosity always leave me with a smile.  If you're in Toronto, support this man, it tastes good to be nice!"}
{"text":"Well honestly I can't add anything that hasn't been already said. I'm just happy to give them another rave review. The amount that you get for that price is something that will have me going back. And the flavours will keep my taste buds very grateful for that decision.  I'm not usually a big fan of Mediterranean food but of course, with the excellent ratings on numerous review sites, I knew I had to give this place a try. It was one of those unassuming places I would have never gone to unless I knew about it. But am I glad I found out about its existence. I got the Better Life Combo, and upon finding out that it was my first time there, Elias offered me a piece of that crazy famous Apple Cake (instead of the cookie/pita that usually comes with the combo). Yes, listen to everything that's been said before. This cake is very delicious. That little caramelized crust from the top of the cake. I can eat that all day every day. My takeout box was PILED with food and it was so very very good. $8 and I was completely stuffed. What a great lunch idea.   Definitely coming back. Definitely going to try and convince my coworkers to go with me. Another satisfied customer for the Mystic Muffin."}
{"text":"Fantastic service.  Wonderful, delicious food and great tea!  I love this place.  It is my go to place when I am in the neighbourhood.  The owner and his wife are a hoot.  Their toddler gives the place panache.  5 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is a place where you feel at home. Elias and Wannita care about the people of Toronto and have the biggest hearts in the city. Plus they never forget a face, try the Falafel  with spice, always get the spice!!! day old muffins and banana bread are practically a steal and I couldnt recommend a better place to have lunch in the city."}
{"text":"This place had good vibes, great energy, and the owner is a fantastic person. The food was fresh, tasty, and hit the spot. This is a nice little gem in Toronto! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Small little food shop.  I had a chicken salad wrap, decent sized, pretty filling, and delicious.  Nothing over the top at this place but very simple on the go tasty food. I'd def go back and try other things."}
{"text":"Get the blueberry cake... Anyway, I give these guys a 5 star review based on how he treat customers.... They will not turn you away even when you don't have money. I went one day and forgot my wallet... I tell the counter person I will be back and she is like take the food, no one leaves hungry.... Considering this place is in an area where there is a high homeless population, to have a policy like that is amazing.... Bad thing tho it's right around the corner from my office and the muffins have given me a muffin top!"}
{"text":"This review is going to be short and sweet, just like my stay in Toronto and my visit to Mystic Muffin.  I never got the owner's name, although we did have a nice chat this past Monday morning.  I was lucky enough to be there on a slow enough morning where I could enjoy some conversation while checking out some banana bread, apple cake, and a number 5 ham and cheese with lettuce and tomato on a bagel.    The draw of this food, for me, is how simple and fresh it is.  The baked goods are made every day.  The day not-so-fresh day olds are sold at a deep discount.  My ham and cheese sandwich on a sesame seed bagel left me wondering why I don't eat more ham and cheese sandwiches on sesame seed bagels.  I wish I could have stuck around for lunch.  The super nice owner was frying potatoes, prepping hummus, and getting the falafels ready for the lunch crowd as I was wrapping it up.  Best of luck to this guy...with 23 years in business and over 4.6 billion served (according to the sign on the side of the building) I am sure he is doing fine."}
{"text":"What a great neighborhood spot! My first time here and I didn't know it's cash only. The owner made me a fresh pita (eggplant, humus, potatoes, parsley and a lot of love), gave me a piece of their famous apple cake, and told me I can just come back and pay for it later! Small town warmness in this big busy city. I am so impressed and will definitely make this my regular coffee/breakfast spot."}
{"text":"I had a Sausage Roll and a Ham and Cheese \"sandwich\" they are more like pitas though. The gentleman behind the bar was incredibly talented at his job keeping conversation with my whole group of friends that came. Prices we're great for what you got and we came close to the end of the day around 16:40 and he gave us some free slices of his Apple Cake, that cake is honestly so delicious you SHOULD try it at least once and it is worth the $3.00 for a slice. So glad we got it for free because we probably wouldn't have tried it otherwise. Coming back for sure when I'm in the area again"}
{"text":"This is a rare time that I am reviewing something that is already commonly rated 4-5 stars :D  This was the second spot on my food landmark map while exploring downtown Toronto. My sister and I joked that Canadians are always so much more polite than we Americans, but in this instance it was delightfully true!  The owner was in a \"bad mood\", but he was practically complimenting my mirth in response to him. He would grumble gently, then turn to me and apologize and say he was feeling off, but with a smile on his face. If this were New York, the owner would be shouting into the kitchen while asking me if I've made up my mind, haha.   Anyway, the muffin was delicious. Not much more to say about it.. What I liked more was how incredibly pleasant the atmosphere was, even if the owner was having a bad day ;p"}
{"text":"Mystic muffin has lots of choices of food- and cheap!  Sandwiches, soups, bagels and coffee, you can get a whole set for $5. There are baked goods too.  I went there for their famous apple cake. $2.50 a piece, I tried it along with a oatmeal raisin cookie. The staff is friendly, they are a busy place!  The cake was okay in my opinion, it has all the flavours it needs: cinnamon, apple chunks, soft texture and was good, but it feels sugary and commercial (even though they make it) and not hearty- i'm not sure if that makes sense. The top part is the best, crunchy like a cookie.  The oatmeal cookie was too crunchy and sweet for my liking.  had their wraps before, and they are pretty decent!"}
{"text":"I thought I would add my two cents to all the other posts about Mystic Muffin...Elias is awesome and extremely generous.   As soon as we walked in,  he offered us a sample of the apple cake.  He then proceeded to shower us with a take-home container full of cabbage and pasta salads as well as coleslaw.  All on the house!!  What a salesman.   We ended up grabbing an apple cake and a blueberry banana loaf.  The Apple Cake is worth the 5 stars, but the blueberry banana didn't have enough banana flavour for my wife and I.    I'll definitely go back to hang-out with Elias and try the rest of his menu."}
{"text":"This place served me possibly the best pita wrap I have ever had. I had their chicken and potato pita, the flavours of their house dressing, perfectly seasoned cooked potatoes and mouth watering chicken was simply amazing. The medley that happens on your tastebuds must be experienced first hand. The owner is extremely friendly and welcoming.  Their business has been ongoing for a whopping 24 years and yet has only just begun offering debit transactions. This is now my go to spot for lunch or dinner whenever I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"MM's apple cake is worth the trip- moist, sweet and fruity. Bought half a cake (half of 9x11) for my coworkers and everyone agreed that it was the best apple cake anyone had ever had. I will definitely be heading back to sample their banana cakes."}
{"text":"Finally made it here after more than a dozen attempts to work it in to my schedule when I happen to be working downtown. The day hours have made that hard.   The first thing I said to him was I finally made it here,  and he said I've been waiting to take your money lol  Came in between lunch and dinner while waiting for a friend to finish work so couldn't have any sandwiches but definitely settled on a green tea... As I was checking out the awesome guy who runs the store recommended the chocolate banana bread at a discount... @_@ he just said 2 of my favorite words.   Even though I've been off sugar I said yessss Lol  Sat and enjoyed my snacks while listening to the banter and fun neighborhood chatter going on around me.   Love it!  Made my whole day in toronto better. Too bad i didn't take advantage of it when I lived dt. 22 years anniversary this month!   Bought the apple cake for take out ;) guess my friend gets a treat!"}
{"text":"I really want someone to make a documentary about Mystic Muffin. This place is a true Toronto landmark. If you've never been there (which is highly likely because the exterior appears super sketchy - but I assure you it's all part of the charm!) then you NEED to check it out.   The owner Elias is HILARIOUS. He is the reason why Mystic Muffin is not only a place to grab food, but an experience. Elias is always behind the counter taking orders and making food, so you're guaranteed to interact with him when you're there. He will most likely tell you some amazing jokes and try really hard to sell you a famous banana loaf or apple cake (both of which are DELICIOUS.) But seriously, he's a really good salesman - it's hard to say no because you'll just love him so much.   Once Elias told me he was getting ready to celebrate Mystic Muffin's 20th anniversary. I asked him what he was doing to celebrate and he responded with \"We're throwing a huge party. Bill Gates is coming.\" Enough said lol.   One more thing: If you're lucky, on a cold day, you might catch Elias wearing his sweater vest."}
{"text":"The shop is really cozy and welcoming. I've passed by this store so many times but never walked in. I'm glad that I tried it today. The food is amazing. I only brought a credit card with me and they don't accept credit card payment. The owner is really nice and told me it's ok. I can pay it tomorrow. They gave me a free slice of their apple cake as well for the first time customer."}
{"text":"One of the best places to grab lunch, and some of the best staff ever! The proprietors were super nice. Although the restaurant is tiny, the overall ambiance is very welcoming. There are tons of choices to choose from and the food tasted wholesome and delicious! The apple cake definitely lives up to its hype - it was the most delicious apple cake I've ever had! The only thing that kind of sucks is that it's cash only - however, the owners are super cool if you don't have cash and you can always pay after eating (there's an ATM machine in the convenience store across from the restaurant). Mystic Muffins is a must go - budget friendly, delicious food, friendly staff. Awesome place overall!"}
{"text":"I don't understand how the sign can say, over 143 BILLION served when they DON'T carry blueberry muffins. The variety is limited; no more than 6 different muffins... 144 Billion they say... the earths population is 5 billion.  Someone please do the math.  Everything looked dry, I had to walk the fudge out."}
{"text":"For years, we used to make fun of this place because of the name, the sign(s), and the location. We'd drive past and say, \"Hey wanna go?\" and chuckle as we drove past.  And then one day, several years later, I went in.   Oh my. For a guy whose favourite joke is \"This falafel is making me feel awful,\" these are the best god damn falafels I've ever eaten in my entire falafel-eating life. The guy that owns the place is hilarious and awesome, and so is his hummus, and so is his damn apple cake that everyone rants about.  Last time, I bought a half of an entire cake, a dozen falafels, and probably a quarter litre of hummus, and I don't even have any shame. Guess what it was? AWESOME.  And you know what? I'm going back right now. Can't stop salivating.   Don't be like me and wait years to walk in. The value you get at this place is rare to come by."}
{"text":"nothing to look at outside, but inside is the most magical food.  not a sit down and have a romantic dinner place, but a place were you can go as you are and get a lot of food for a little $ and be full and happy!  apple cake and falafel are a must."}
{"text":"Found on Yelp, had to go and check this place out. The first look is quite \"scary\" it's a little corner deli, looks old and run down from the outside, certainly very local.  Inside you meet the owner, a Lebanese national that moved to Canada when young, and built his life and business in Toronto from scratch.  Well the interior is well kept, there are a lot of things to \"read\" and see, the owner talks with everyone and is very friendly. I have tried the \"famous apple cake\", it was nice, other people had burritos and salads which looked extremely delicious.  All in all it's a great, cheap place that offers an uncommon experience and a very personable service."}
{"text":"We had literally just ate right before we stumbled on Mystic Muffin.  We wanted to stop in to check it out. We met the owner who said he had been there 22 years. He was very friendly.  We went to leave and he stopped us and gave us a free slice of banana loaf. \"In case we got hungry while walking \" It was delicious by the way. What a great guy, I would wholeheartedly recommend this place if you're in Toronto!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and what a treat! :) I brought my friend who just came back from Europe for a visit.   \"You only have moments to make a friend and enjoy your time with them.\" Ah, Elias and his infinite wisdom.  My friend was duly impressed by how easily Elias made a connection. Plus, the free apple cake didn't hurt either. Ahah, I had to tolerate being berated by her when Elias revealed his Mystic Muffin promotion (t-shirt!!!).  Thought I'd try a muffin this time around.   Elias: \"You can't find this (Lemon Coconut) combination anywhere else in the city. Just like our apple cake. So, what'll it be?\"   Oh, Elias, you had me sold with that first sentence and the price was killer ($1), :D."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of Toronto's hidden gems. The food is fresh, delicious, and very affordable - I started frequenting the place as a summer intern working in Toronto, and it was definitely within my budget.  I will echo what others commenters have said and confirm that I too received a free slice of apple cake my first visit there! Now that's knowing how to draw in a customer!  What's more is that you'll never see a more enthusiastic and friendly salesperson than the owner. He's even got a precious little protege in his young daughter who makes it her mission to sit with the customers whenever she can.  Just remember - cash only!"}
{"text":"Like everyone else, we got a slice of apple cake too! It was super moist and delicious. A cheap, quick bite from a friendly owner? Yes, please!   The food is great and fresh, but nothing special about it, meaning it is not worth to make a special trip just to eat here. If you feel like grabbing something more homemade and made to order than fast food joints around this area, come here! They've got a few tables where you can eat also."}
{"text":"mmmmm apple cake.. I ended up getting half a cake for $9 and it didn't disappoint. Was very fresh and tasty.  I'd would go out of my way to try their apple cake. sooo good"}
{"text":"I was encouraged by the staff across the street at Fahrenheit to grab lunch at Mystic Muffin, and they seemed overly enthusiastic about the food here, especially the falafel.   From the the outside, Mystic Muffin doesn't exactly cause a lot of stimulation, but once you step through the door, there is immediately a great sense of character and homeliness in the decor. On the left of the entrance, you'll see Mystic Muffin t-shirts and mugs for sale, along with a bunch of yummy baked goods at the front of the store. Along the far wall, many, many pictures of patrons wearing the t-shirt at locations around the world are posted up. In addition to this simple, yet entertaining decor, are articles about the store owner, Elias.   Elias himself is something else. He's calm, hilarious, and very practical. If you can keep up with all of the words he spits out, you'll enjoy his quick wit and sense of humour.   Now the food! I ordered the falafel wrap, with lentil soup and I also grabbed a piece of his famous apple pie. I honestly can't decide which I liked the most. The lentil soup was amazing, without too much salt, and full of taste and healthiness! Falafel wrap was also delicious, crunchy and well balanced. The apple cake, which I was skeptical about, was moist, and so tasty.   I would highly recommend this place again. It's got great food, great showmanship from Elias, and most importantly, you can honk the horn at the back of the store, and give customers a little surprise!  Just a note, it's cash only :)"}
{"text":"Just before leaving Toronto, I dropped by again at 7:26am. On saturdays, the store opens at 7:30. We waited and it was bitterly cold. Elias saw us huddling in the wind and opened the door and let us in. Sadly, he was not ready to have customers. Tomorrow, he is hosting a cooking camp for 60 children! What fun! Unfortunately, that meant that he was busy mixing and prepping. We couldn't wait and so told him that we had to catch our train.   Surprise, he felt bad about making us wait and gave us three free slices of banana bread. I like that. It is always the thought that counts."}
{"text":"This place is unique. The interesting phrases add to the character of this place. The owner is similarly unique and nice.  I only tried the $2 CAD Apple Cake. For two dollars (or a Twooie, as I'm told they're called) I think you'll be hard pressed to find a better Apple Cake.  If I ever find myself in Toronto on Jarivis between the hours of 6:30am to 5pm, I'll be sure to try some other stuff."}
{"text":"Flavourful and filling food served with warm smiles at reasonable prices. Not a fancy frou frou place but they've been around for 24 years so that tells you something.   RECOMMENDATIONS: - Apple cake - moist cake flavoured with aromatic spices filled with chunks of sweet apple and topped with a scrumptious crumble topping. - Chicken salad sandwich (served on bread or pita)  - Chicken and Potato sandwich  - Lentil soup - made with 11 different kinds of veggies. It's chunky, thick, savoury and filling. - Hummus - smooth, a little plain but went really well with their falafel. - Falafel - delicious, lightly crisp on the outside. - Cookies (1 chocolate chip and 1 oatmeal raisin) are soft with a nice chew and not too sweet."}
{"text":"This is a great place to check out if you're in the mood for something healthy, light and fresh. The prices will keep your wallet feeling chirpy and full along with the spring in your step as you leave Elias and his fabulous restaurant.   The service was above and beyond average, and this is a business that is pretty much run on personality and hospitality. There is no Mystic Muffin without that hilarious man behind the counter, nor should there be.   I didn't expect the Apple cake to taste so darn great, but it did. Did I mention *everything* here is as fresh as it gets? I will agree with Matthew, in that it's not the best falafel I've had, but freshness, character, and a little je ne sais quoi definitely put Mystic Muffin up there with the best.   Cash only. Taxes included."}
{"text":"I would give this place five stars for the comedic and entertainment value of Elias (the owner) alone.  But it also happens to serve tasty sandwiches and meals, and of course, the legendary apple cake.  I have on occasion had their veggie plate, which is pretty filling, but I quite enjoyed the egg salad sandwich (be sure to ask for extra egg to make sure the proportions of the sandwich are just right).  If this is your first time, do yourself a favor and engage the owner in a conversation (he's a riot) and try the apple cake."}
{"text":"\"My best friend and I got to Mystic Muffin right as the owner was closing for the evening. Thankfully, he still had some Apple Cake for sale. We had intended to purchase 2 slices...one for each of us, but the owner convinced us otherwise. We ended up buying a whole sheet of the cake. We were worried that it would spoil before we would be able to eat it all. He promised us that the cake would stay good for about a week as long as we wrapped it back up. WE FINISHED IT IN ONE DAY. Yes, it was THAT good.\" Stella Lai wrote.  That's what my best friend wrote. Now time for mine. I don't remember the price, but I would pay about 20-30 dollars for this apple cake again. It is a hole in the all, but damn, worth every effort to walk here, wait (if there were a line) and pay 25 dollars for a cake. When you chomp on this, there is a crunchy consistency for the top layer, bits-o-apples in every bite, and it just melts in your mouth. Not sweet at all like an apple pie or a lattice pie. It is moist but doesn't fall apart. I will finish this by saying this: the next time I fly into Toledo, OH I would drive 4-5 hours to Toronto, Canada, just to get me some apple cake."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that makes me like TORONTO more...  I immediately liked the shop, setup, staff/family.  Must jump on the band wagon; apple cake is AMAZING.  I would eat it every week if I lived closer!  I also got the vibe (helped out someone down on their luck w a 'free'? slice..)."}
{"text":"I scoped out all the cool places in Toronto to try while I came back from a mini trip and it just seems like there was something so amazing about Mystic muffin -... and then I read it:  A.P.P.L.E... C.A.K.E!  My eyes lit up. Done deal....Coincidentally,  I was a block away from it on Monday afternoon so i wandered the streets until I found this little corner store with a sign with giant bubble letters, something that would not appeal to me at ALL....  walking in, most of the tables were filled, and I saw the lady  (in the photo)  greet me. Politley, she asked me what I wanted and I excitedly told her I was here for the apple cake....  Not sure who mentioned that first timers get it for free because I certainly paid my $2.00 and thanked her but none the less, it is the best $2.00 you ever spent on a piece of apple cake.  The cake was still warm, soft and LOADED... no joke here... LOADED with butter. It seemed like there was some brown sugar crumble on top that was oh so sweet and I could not get enough of.  If that platter was in front of me, it would be gone in about 30 minutes and that platter was mighty big."}
{"text":"This is my getaway from the hamster wheel and Elias is always welcoming. I always order the chicken sandwich with pasta salad and the apple cake. My entire team is now a fan of the apple cake. Highly recommended for the love, cheerful service and the random talk on the street but if you are looking for a high flying magical sit down place, you might be disappointed."}
{"text":"Their Apple-Cinnamon muffin is the best! It's a nice semi-healthy carb filler to have after going to the gym....or not."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favorite place in town!! The apple cake and banana chocolate cake are mostly recommended!!   I came there in Friday morning for breakfast. Elias is so friendly and humorous, when I told him many people recommended him online he seemed to be very happy.  I ordered a chickpea salad(with flavored herb) , chili soup( rich and delicious), and two pieces of heaven cakes!! Just for 8$...Actually, Elias didn't charged me for the apple cake~~ He was so kind!!  Banana chocolate cake was freshly baked and still warmed....So nice!! And the best apple cake in town is so soft and moist!! Most importantly, both of them are not too sweet. It was soooooo good! I love it so much!  Elias and his food reaally make my day! I would definitely go back and take my friends to try the cakes!!!"}
{"text":"I checked out this place purely based on the reviews on the apple cake. The cake is amazing as everyone says and their food was pretty good too.   I had a Eggplant wrap. The owner said, \"oh we're kinda low on eggplant. Tell you what, well throw some potatoes in there, oh and some cabbage,  you like cabbage? It'll be great, trust me.\"  The owner was really friendly and I will definitely return for that cake."}
{"text":"Great tasting Falafel. But it's the Apple Cake that makes me going back again and again. Super friendly Owner working behind the counter. Reminder, if you are driving, don't try parking across the gas station staffs inside had a keen eye. I usually parked across on Lombard Street. REMEMBER TO TRY THEIR APPLE CAKE."}
{"text":"The food is great, the apple cake is amazing, and the owner is unbelievable! He is so kind and funny and worth stopping into see even if you aren't hungry!"}
{"text":"It's worth all the hype; down to every last ounce of it. The apple cake is THAT GOOD! Fluffy, pillowy, oozing with melt-in-your-mouth apples. They are not shy with the cinnamon either. I love the bits of caramelized brown sugar that form the crust (crispy with the slightest chew!). This stuff is an incredible aromatic and textual experience!  I work 5 minutes away from this place and I can't believe I have never visited. This is dangerously close to me and I am hesitantly looking forward to many, many more visits.  I had an exceedingly great experience with the owner as well. He went above and beyond for me on my very first visit. I wasn't aware they ONLY ACCEPT CASH and he happily offered me a piece of cake on the house. I went back later that day to pay him and told him he can expect to see a lot of me from here on.  This is truly a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"What a good deal! It's just a couple minutes walk from the financial district but the food is so much better and cheaper. I had the fallafel wrap and it was superb. As a new customer, I also got a slice of the apple pie - yum. It would've been better if it was warm though. Would also like more seating area because I went with a friend and it got busy pretty fast."}
{"text":"I remember when I lived down the street I thought this place looked a bit sketchy from the outside.  But this is a perfect example of why you shouldn't judge books by their cover.    It's one of those hidden gem places that over a wide variety of home cooked food for cheap prices!    This place would get a 5 starts for the apple cake alone!"}
{"text":"The owner (Elias-I think that was his name) is awesome, extremely welcoming and generous! The food itself is fresh and has a home made taste. Window seats is great for people watching."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, for the authentic food, atmosphere, and especially Elias!  I moved away from Toronto, and had not been in for over 3 years, and Elias remembered me! He never forgets a face, and he will remember your story, and pick up right where you left off!  I used to work down the street, and yes, it is a seedy area, but the authentic Lebanese food is fresh and delicious and fairly priced.  You will see a wide range of clientele, who are there because Elias makes everyone feel special, and the apple cake is phenomenal! Your first slice is free!"}
{"text":"Mystic Muffins are five stars for two reasons: The food and the service.  Look, the famed apple cake is great. It's soft. Easy to take apart and tastes like an apple pillow in your mouth. A friend thought it was even better. I still have a chicken samosa and banana bread to eat too. I'm sure it won't disappoint.  But the beauty of this place is the owner. He's a gem.   When I first came in on about to get busy morning, I ordered the apple cake before realizing it was cash only. I was in Toronto on business. I didn't have singles of American dollars, let alone loonies.   He told me to just take it and go. I'll be back, he told me. He was right. I returned in an hour to pay off my debt. He simply why I was back so soon.  I then paid for the cake, bought two more things and sat down to eat. A few minutes later I heard him yelling \"Johnny, Johnny.\" He meant me. I turned around and he flung a piece of banana bread at me. On the house.  \"Johnny is what I call somebody if I don't know their name,\" he said.  I never caught Johnny's name but I can thank him here and urge you to check out the place. It's really good."}
{"text":"\"So, how is your day so far,\" says Elias. \"Not bad,\" I say. \"So what's your name Jimmy,\" he smiles. \"Andre\" \"Well Andre, Jaunita who's as hot as my apple cake is going to give you a free slice since I know its your first time in here.\" And so, I was hooked.  I didn't buy any of the bandanda, tshirts (green for St. Paddy's Day) or coffee mugs (free coffee with every mug) but I did smile at the couple who came in with their infant in a Mystic Muffin tshirt...and I smiled at the couple buying a mug to take back to the US (by the way, the owner Elias says the mugs next year on Ebay will be worth $1000).   Seriously, the food is fresh and yummy. Sandwiches as far as the eye can see, fresh salads (all kinds) and yumm apple cake. A lunch time paradise. Sit in the window and relax. Say hi to Elias. Bring a friend, get a hug. Bring two, get a soup, bring three and get an apple cake slice.  If Elias were here he'd never let me review this without saying \"we cater for corporations...I just brought 100 sandwiches and salads to everyone at Scotiabank's trading floor.\" Go see Elias, for the food, the smile and if you are lucky a hug or a slice of apple cake.  Peace!"}
{"text":"Great falafel, great apple cake! The service is friendly, the prices are cheap, and the food is great. I've only come for lunch, and it was decently busy but not bad."}
{"text":"If there's one age-old lesson this place taught me, it's not to judge a book by its cover. I've driven by this place many times, thinking it was nothing more than an average dive. Boy, was I wrong. This spot may look like a shop you'd find on the 8 Mile (okay, that's an exaggeration, but the exterior is pretty dated), but the food and experience deserves all 5 stars.  I dropped by on a Wednesday afternoon at noon for lunch, and was taken aback by how warmly the owner greeted me. Service was so warm, genuine, friendly - you don't find owners like this too often in a big city. I ordered the Vegetarian Platter, which comes with rice, potatoes, 4 types of salad, a pita, and two falafel, topped with a generous dollop of hummus, and spices. I thought the potatoes and rice were just okay, but everything else in my overflowing container was delicious - the hummus and falafel were definitely the highlights for me. That hummus is magic.   Elias also discovered that it was my first time visiting, and offered me, ever so famously, a piece of apple cake. So moist, soft, delicious, not overly sweet, and paired perfectly with the coffee I grabbed after my meal.   For all that food, plus a piece of apple cake on the house, I paid $9.00. Cash only. Great value, especially taking into account the portion size. If it wasn't such a trek from work, I'd be here more often. But nevertheless, I'll definitely be back. Thanks to fellow Yelpers for helping me find this gem!"}
{"text":"Yes, everything they say is true. The apple cake is delicious. Elias is so friendly and quite the salesman. If I lived around this cafe I would be eating there often. I would say this is mostly a to-go type place, but if you stay to eat there is some nice bar seating by the window and there is tons of cute/witty stuff on the walls to look at."}
{"text":"It is not easy finding good authentic falafel sandwiches near downtown Toronto.  Thank God for Mystic Muffin.  The sandwich is prepared with the right ingredients, not just a random plethora of ingredients and sauces so many other places seem to use.  I enjoy the lentil soup as well.  There are a lot of breakfast options as well and baked goods that I enjoy.  I am not someone who is into sweets, so I usually go for the falafel/soup, but if you do like baked goods, go for it.  Elias is as described by many others here.  He's efficient in taking and filling orders, but also enjoys talking to his customers and talking in general, so if you're willing to talk or interested in talking, you'll get to know him.  He's also pretty funny, so if you sit in and eat, you'll probably hear some jokes."}
{"text":"I love this place. My go-to is the Egg & Potato on pita, but I also love their falafel and veg platter dinners. Great chickpea salad. Amazing apple cake. Owner is quite a character - really nice guy. You gotta eat here!"}
{"text":"Love the veggie combo, apple cake and the humorous signs in the store! Will definitely come back to try something else."}
{"text":"Mystic Muffin is a little island of joy amidst a sea of concrete and cars.   I stopped bringing in my lunch to work because the falafel is SO DELICIOUS. Get it in a sandwich or get it as part of a special. And I know salads have a reputation for being boring, but I dream about their regular chickpea, cabbage and lettuce salad. It's just PERFECT.  The world famous apple cake is great, but I'm really thankful for the rice krispy squares. Sometimes a grown woman has got to have a rice krispy square. The oatmeal raisin cookies are also good. Haven't tried the eponymous muffins yet.  Actually, I haven't tried much of anything yet, beyond the items listed above. The falafel is just too good not to order. Although, thanks to these Yelp reviews, I think I might try the chicken and potato salad with eggplant.   The icing on the (apple) cake is obviously Elias and Wonita, who are fantastic. Elias always asks about my day while preparing my falafel. It's never very interesting, so mostly he just tries to sell me Mystic Muffin t-shirts. FACT: if you take a picture of yourself wearing a Mystic Muffin t-shirt anywhere outside of Ontario, Elias will give you a free whole slab of apple cake, which actually costs more than the shirt; the deal never expires!  Hmmm. Maybe I've been going there too often. I've memorized the sales pitch."}
{"text":"It's always a show when you go to this place, this owner is a character ! He's extremely friendly and will take care of you if it's your first time !   There are a LOT of lunch combo options so sometimes it can take forever to choose !! Be prepared ! I took the veggie combo (falafels, hummus, salad, rice, beans and I must forget something and it comes with pitta or cookies). It's a big plate so here also be prepared to struggle to finish the plate ahaha.  It was good, nothing amazing but for a cheap lunch with a great portion, you get what you paid and I was more than satisfied !   I also tasted (yes still some place for the dessert) their apple pie, it was delicious, soft inside and crunchy on top ! Try it !"}
{"text":"We hit up an estate sale at an old and very cool refurbished barn in Cabbagetown and this place caught our eye. Mesmerized by its mysticism and strange quotes adorning the facade we went in.  Thrown off by the name -- this one man joint dishes out Lebanese food deli-style and prides itself on their notorious apple cake... Not magical, mystical muffins;) Ahhhh that's where the mystical part comes into focus.  We each had the falafel pita--traditional, simple and tasty, it hit the spot.  We didn't buy the apple cake, although the owner had some great persuasion tactics, he ended up giving us a taste-- it was good, it's just something I wouldn't generally buy.   Good for a quick bite and pretty cheap too, I think the falafel pitas were $4 each... But if you're not interested in the apple cake you're going to have to be firm, the owners' sales skills are top notch;)"}
{"text":"I'm eating the infamous apple cake (or crumble depending on who you ask) right now and my taste buds are happy. Wow. It's darn good.   I didn't get to meet Elias but this little cheap food joint is a 10 minute walk from my work. I'll be back for more apple cake, maybe a falafel, that's for certain."}
{"text":"This place is legend. Elias is a local personality who makes wraps, awesome apple cake, falafel, and you laugh when you order.  More of a takeout place, but they do have some seating. Muffins are good too."}
{"text":"I don't come here nearly as often as I should, just because I don't usually walk around in this exact area of town (lame excuse I know).  But, would it make up for it if I just DREAM about the apple cakes quite often??  ... No? Ok fine, so that is why I finally brought a MM virgin here for the first time today.  Walked in intending to purchase one slice each and maybe a few more for family/friends, but was so shocked to see there were only 2 more slices on display!  Then Elias being always prepared, told us he just finished baking a fresh warm batch and showed it to us.  He asked if we wanted the whole thing... my wallet, and summer body (yet to work on) said 'no', but my mind and current body screamed, 'hell yeaaahhh'.  When it comes to food, I am the biggest sucker!  As I was lost in my own world of Apple Cake Heaven, something managed to catch my attention.  It was Richard.  I have never met or seen Richard before, but apparently he is a homeless, but harmless dude that is known to Elias.  He got a free coffee and left.  Then another girl (probably homeless too) politely asked Elias if she could get a drink with the wee money she had, and of course, he insisted she goes over to the fridge and helped herself to a drink.  This is not the first time he's done this.  I recall the last time I was in here, he gave a homeless man (which he also knew by name, but not Richard) free apple cake!  Lucky guy!  I took the time to enjoy my moist cake encrusted with crunchy sweet crack while I read his menu board, and looked at the pictures on the wall.  I noticed he was hosting his (annual?) Kids' Cooking Camp tomorrow and for free... right there at MM!!  There are pictures from previous years of the event.  I am amazed how Elias gives back to the community!  From the outside, it kind of looks like a sketchy convenience store, and I've actually never had anything else here other than a cup of joe and apple cake.  This is more of a grab n go or a simple catering place.  I really wish there were comfortable seating, music, and maybe some AC.  I would be there all the time reading and never getting that summer body.   *** He mentioned to us yesterday marked his 19 years of Mystic Muffin.  I just want to say, congratulations Elias!!  \"Make apple cake, not war!\"- sign holding by a baby in one of the pictures.  (By the way, I gave my share of the fresh apple cake slab to share between a few MM virgins, and they all gave thumbs up!)"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 8 years so a review is long overdue.  The place provides amazing home cooked food, one of my go-to places for lunch.  Elias is basically a friend at this point - always totally amusing and welcoming.  Always fresh and delicious food, and the veggie combo (or does he call it the Lover's combo? Feel good combo? I think it goes by many names) is the most unassuming feed you can get for lunch: tastes fantastic, fills me up perfectly for lunch (my hungry meal of the day) and it was only years later I realized it's vegan. This coming from a total carnivore - somehow it just works. Ironically I rarely eat the muffins even though they are great.  The apple cake is fantastic."}
{"text":"Over the past couple of years, I've come to Mystic Muffin so many times. It's such a go to place for me. On my birthday I treated myself the huge combo platter, warmed up with a bowl of lentil soup when I wasn't feeling well or brought my friend a slab of apple cake during hard times. Even the simple wraps and sandwiches are a great quick lunch when you're heading out of the city. Elias is such a character and is the reason why his place is so great."}
{"text":"The good: Honestly, I remember always coming by this place but I avoided it because it sounded like a place where people would get high (mystic muffin come on). But wow, did Yelp bring me into a great place. Ok, onto the food. Their apple cake is as they say they are, amazing!!! Their falafel is not too bad itself, but wow that apple cake is something I would definitely go back for! The price is as good as it gets. Not to mention the owners are happy of what they do and have a very cheerful/fun personality.  The bad: spacing is super limited so it's either takeout or wait for a seat.  The ugly: I didn't notice anything bad that would prevent me from coming back again.  Neutral: their combos are a good item to choose. It fills you up. Great takeout food. Don't leave without the Apple cake."}
{"text":"Everything you've read about Elias is true. What a wonderful person. The generosity  he showed and humor he shared with me and the other customers will not be forgotten. I stumbled in on a Saturday and was immediately baffled by the massive menu and overwhelmed by all the interesting items and positive, inspiring, and often silly phrases he has written all over the place.   One thing to note is he has a limited menu on Saturday so half the stuff on the board wasn't offered. Still not enough narrowing for me, as it all sounded good. Sensing my predicament, Elias made a suggestion of a hummus sandwich and lentil soup that hit the spot. I did not try the famous apple cake, but he sent me home with a bonus banana bread that I just finished this evening. It was moist and flavorful 10 hours after it left the store.  The food did not blow me away, but Elias sure did. It's clear that he loves his customers and his work more than his pocketbook. It's a good way to live, and I bought the t-shirt to remind me of that."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of this place. Heard the hype for years, then finally got a chance to go yesterday.  We tried the apple cake and the sausage rolls. Both were really really good. The apple cakes were just as good as people said. I also make a real good apple cake but mine is bundt cake style loaded with soft apples. This one is sheet cake style with sprinkling of apples here and there but the standout is really the crispy caramel crust. Mm I want more!!! Totally had to fight my husband for the last piece and even then I didn't win   I wish they had more selection in the store. By the time I got there around 4 pm, they really didn't have much left besides apple cake, beef patty, rolls... Going to check it out earlier next time to discover more goodies!"}
{"text":"It's easy to walk by this place without noticing or paying much attention to it. But definitely drop in and give it a try! Homemade soups, falafels, wraps, salads, fresh baked goods, and a free slice of apple cake (delicious!) on your first visit. Great prices for something quick, easy, and some healthy options on the run. Also, Elias is very personable and will make you laugh. Very community-minded and a big heart - an annual kids cooking camp, a b'day party for his daughter open to his customers, kindness to homeless in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for a weekday lunch, and ordered a falafel pita with a side of spicy potatoes and a piece of apple cake.  The pita was just alright.  However, the side dish of spicy potatoes was great, as was the moist delicious apple cake.  Despite my lack of love for the pita, I have to admit that lunch was a good value at $8.50.  If I lived or worked in the area I would probably become a regular, but it is not something I would go out of my way for."}
{"text":"The taste of mystic muffin is still in my mouth as i write this, super nice folks that have a somewhat suspect sign outside proclaiming their apple cake to be the best in town and specifically requiring you to be of legal eating age to partake. While this worries me for the police state that is Canada, i hope everyone is legal age, because that shit is amazing. I didn't even notice if they had muffins, but the falafel sandwich and samosa was great, as was the apple cake, obv."}
{"text":"Compare with the price, the food is really super. Especially Apple pie, many customs take it to go, It is worth to try."}
{"text":"Wonderful little lunch stop, with excellent service. The veggie platter was delicious and freshly made. Make sure you try the apple cake!! Would definitely stop by again next time!!"}
{"text":"This take-out place has been around forever, but I somehow never ventured in. To be honest, it does not look like much from the outside. But I finally gave it a try for lunch, thanks to fellow yelper Janna S.!   What sets Mystic Muffin apart is the friendly service. It's a family-run business, and baby Stella is adorable!! There seem to be a ton of regulars and the owner treats customers like old friends.   The lunch combo is a steal for $8 and includes a wrap + soup/salad + a cookie. It's a lot of food! I went for the falafel wrap which was fresh and flavourful, and a salad of mixed greens with chick peas on top. Since it was my first visit, I got a free slice of their famous apple cake, which was moist and delicious with a hint of cinnamon.   There are a few tables to eat inside, or you could take your food across the street and eat in the park.   It took me a long time to finally eat here, but now that I've discovered how great it is, I will definitely be back. Their banana bread and breakfast sandwich offerings look really tempting! This is the kind of small, independent business that one really likes to see succeed."}
{"text":"The falafels are amazing. Seriously.   The muffins are too. Screw Tim Horton's and Richtree, you need a peach muffin from Mystic. The place looks like a dive but the muffins are truly gourmet.  The apple cake is really unique and fantastic. It's a soft, fluffy, spiced slab cake with a topping of apple slices and crunchy melted brown sugar. For years as a student in Toronto heading out of town for long weekends on the Coach Canada bus, I rode past this place and saw the signs for the World's Best Apple Cake. Now I work down the street from Mystic and I believe it.  I'm not sure why it's marked as wheelchair accessible. There's a step up through a narrow door to get in."}
{"text":"Yum... As I take my last few bites of the vegetarian platter. So good! Like other Yelpers, I was skeptical about this place. What the heck is Mystic Muffin? Always saw this place when I walked to work but didn't have any interest going until I happen to check my Yelp app and was blown away by how many great reviews they had.   I had a day off from work so I decided to come here for lunch. When I walked in a nice lady greeted me. I believe the owner was in the back but he kindly came out to greet me as well. I asked what she recommended but I knew I would probably end up ordering the veg platter. Luckily she suggested that as well and I went on my merry way. It came up to $9 and you can have a pita or cookie with the platter.   When I got home and took a bite, their hummus is delicious! That was probably my favourite part along with the falafel. The salads were great as well. I agree with some reviews that the rice and potatoes aren't anything special. It's not, but it's still good and paired well with everything else.   Also being a first timer, got to try a piece of their yummy apple cake. It was so nice and moist and just so good.   Thanks Mystic Muffin for a great first experience!"}
{"text":"Mystic Muffin is everything you look for in a place to eat. Great friendly people doing their best to run a successful business, while feeding a busy Toronto lunch crowd with tasty, filling and reasonably priced food.  If you are down with chickpeas, or falafel, or salads, or baked goods. You've come to the right place. If not, I believe they have tuna on the menu. I got the veggie combo platter ($8 including tax). It includes 2 falafel, hummus, pasta salad, rice and peas, spicy potatoes, cabbage salad, garden salad, chickpea salad, and a choice between pita or cookie. It is a filling yet healthy plate of food. It's the kind of food you won't feel bad after eating a lot of.  I've had the apple cake before at work, and it's moist and delicious. And it's not cheap on the apple chunks either. Totally recommended.  There's a place in Vancouver called Nuba that sells similar food, but the difference with this place is the food is way tastier, and way cheaper. Do yourself a favour and try this place out for lunch. Your tummy and your wallet will thank you."}
{"text":"This place is definitely among the most unique and memorable places you can visit downtown!  Elias (the owner) will butter you up faster than anything you can order to go (although he did tell me that I was boring for living in North York).  He has a smile, a hug, and a story for every customer, and the food is excellent - especially the cake!  I wish I lived closer to this place because I'd go more often. Toronto needs more friendly places like this one."}
{"text":"Very friendly environment and the owner from Lebonan is amazing! We had egg salad bagel and falafels and it was delicious and fresh! The price is also very affordable! Recommend it if you're in downtown area and want to have a quality affordable meal!"}
{"text":"Loved this charming place. The owners run the simple resto. The food is good and inexpensive. I enjoyed the vege platter that everyone raves about. I suggest trying that with a piece of apple cake. Filled with personality  in the décor and the owner."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Mystic Muffin.   An institution in Toronto, Elias is so well loved because of his low key love for people and the city. People in need can come here for a free meal. Don't have cash? Elias will spot you if you promise to give it to the next homeless person you see. But peel away the philanthropic element of the owner and his family, and you get really moist and well baked fresh goods that is reminiscent of mums.    For me, a visit to my doctors is incomplete without saying hello to Mystic Muffin and rewarding my colleagues with their deliciousness.    Spread the love."}
{"text":"A four star middle-eastern inspired lunch place elevated to five stars by great atmosphere, amazing apple cake, and the coolest owner ever.  Mystic Muffin has your typical falafel joint options plus things like egg salad and tuna sandwiches. True to the name they also have a small selection of baked goods: muffins, cookies, and the world's best apple cake. Apart from the apple cake, which is an easy 5 stars, this is four star food; very good but not the best. I had the falafel plate for $6.99 and it was a ton of delicious food.  What makes Mystic Muffin is the experience. This is a real neighbourhood joint and the guy that runs it seems to know everyone and he is the most fun, friendly, and zany dude ever. He prepares each dish or sandwich to order in front of you and he chats and jokes the whole time. He immediately asked me my name and where I worked and he, and his helper Wonita, referred to me by name for the rest of my visit.  Because it was my first visit he hooked me up with a free slice of his famous apple cake. The whole experience just left me so much more happy than when I came in and that alone is worth 5 stars."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! SO CHEAP! From the wraps to the baked goods. It really doesn't get any better than this.   Go for the falafel wrap, with everything and extra sauce. Have it with soup and enjoy it while it's hot! I tried the apple cake and the chocolate banana bread. They're both to die for!"}
{"text":"VIBE  This is a place that's in the middle of nowhere but really in the middle of everywhere because it services all of those working in nearby office buildings disguised as lofts. I've only been once but you only need to go once to know Elias's name. Oh, and he'll remember yours too. Dude has the memory of an elephant, so I'm told. He'll chat up a storm with you.   I ATE I think I was cash strapped that day but I was in luck because I got the fameux Apple Cake. It was tasty. What a nice surprise! That said, there's lots on the menu but nothing really screaming out at me. Very reasonable prices.   OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK  There's definitely something mystic here. I just don't know if it's the muffin."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Elias who owns this place.. He is such a nice, jolly guy that he drives your cares away! The first time I went there, Elias told me about how he'd serve my mother when she was pregnant with me! So untrue, but so funny!  For its small size, Mystic Muffin does quite a few things at once: sell coffee, baked goods, salads, felafels and patties! Mystic Muffin will satiate your stomach with some decent cheap eats. I've have the lunch combo: a smattering of salads and felafels for just 6 bucks!   The food is pretty ok, the apple cakes are over-par and Elias is just smashing! The place is clean, no frills but invites some sketchy characters given the hood it is in. If you're in the hood, don't not miss a chance to go."}
{"text":"Very friendly atmosphere and owner.  Love the lentil soup and apple cake!"}
{"text":"Been here twice in a week and this place is just great. Veggie platter was tasty! I am such a carnivore but I reallt enjoyed the platter.  The apple cake is so famous I do not need to say more. I am yet to try a piece thats hot though.  Also I admire the owners effort to help the homeless people in this area. They are just nice people and I would come here for lunch as often as I could, it is a 30 mins walk to and from my work but totally worth it. Plus, the food is cheap."}
{"text":"After 10 years of living up the street and passing numerous times, I finally went in for a sandwich.  I had been missing out.  Fantastic food and the Apple Cake lives up to it's reputation.  The owner Elias is super friendly and quite a character.  It's no wonder he has quite a following."}
{"text":"I went to Mystic Muffin for the first time about a month ago.  I ordered a falafel, which turned out to be very good.  The apple cake dessert was incredible, and free since it was my and my roommate's first visit.  The most memorable part, though, was definitely the owner, Elias, and his almost stand-up comic routine throughout our meal.  He told us, for example, that he now \"does weddings\" (catering) for \"only $7-a-plate!\"  He said to tell all my friends about this incredible deal.  After explaining at-length all his ideas for this new service, he deadpans, \"I do divorces too!  Even funerals!\"  (I believe he said there would be a discount for buying the wedding and divorce packages together.)  Mystic Muffin is one of those rare places that offers good, inexpensive food with incredible (and entertaining) customer service.  Hope to go back soon."}
{"text":"On a trip to Toronto and it was a hidden gem we're glad we found . Food was real good, inexpensive and owner was interesting to chat with.   We had the sandwich wraps in pita bread with egg salad and tuna salad, and lentil soup before heading back home on a 6 hour drive.   Your place made me smile looking back at how well the trip turned out, and glad it was wrapped up spontaneously coming in for lunch at the Mystic Muffin :)  I'm coming in here again next time I'm in town!!!"}
{"text":"The chirpy call of quirky Mystic Muffin owner and falafel maker extraordinaire can catch unsuspecting walk-ins off guard. However, once you're introduced (\"Oh, you can call me honey\"), you'll no doubt warm up to him in a flash.    While hugs and banter are free flowing in this casual eatery, some would argue that the first and foremost reason to visit is for the amazing food.   Right off the bat, even before we even cast our eyes on the vast chalkboard menus, we were given a mysterious creamy dip with pita on the house and asked to guess what it was made of. While we had no clue what the pureed deliciousness was, we knew that we liked it. In the end, we were almost relieved when it was revealed to be made of zucchini and not another addictive illegal substance. Keep your eyes peeled for this being added to the menu soon!  The fresh falafels that come wrapped up snuggly with your favourite fresh veggies or plopped atop of a big green salad are some of the best I have had in Toronto - delicately crisp and crunchy on the outside while light and fluffy on the inside. The salads: green lettuce, pasta, shredded cabbage, or a melange of all three are again fresh and flavourful.    Since it was our first visit to Mystic Muffin, we knew that we were entitled to free slices of apple cake - it says so on the chalk board! However, to our pleasant surprise, we didn't have to show any proof. We didn't even have to ask for it! Two glorious slices of moist, old fashioned coffee cake with visible apple chunks topped with crumbly goodness were brought right to our table.  Freebies or not, I know that I'll be able to count on friendly service and great food on my second visit and everyone from here on after and that's more than enough to have me coming back for more."}
{"text":"** Mystic Muffin now accepts Interac with a 25 cent surcharge, otherwise bring cash, no credit cards accepted, it's too costly for a tiny place like this.**  It's been... 4 years since my last review (sung to the tune of BNL's One Week)...  ... and if I could update my review to give Mystic Muffin 10 stars I totally would.  Elias, the owner, heart and soul of Mystic Muffin is what makes this tiny shop so great.  And now he is a proud papa of a little girl and baby boy with his lovely wife Annie.  I think the place should be renamed Mystic Apple Cake because it is mystifyingly amazing!  Then there is the huge list of menu choices, I have yet to bring a friend that didn't enjoy a Mystic Muffin pita wrap: Tuna, Chicken salad, Egg salad and Falafel, and then there are the veggie combos, so tasty AND healthy!    Everyone ends up finding their favourite - my hubs loves the chicken salad on a pita with cabbage and potatoes, an Elias secret menu special!     It can get busy at peak lunch hours, especially on Fridays, but please be patient, your tastebuds will be rewarded!  I can't count the number of times I have brought a Mystic Muffin apple cake to a birthday or pot luck type event and everyone assumed I baked it, because it looks and tastes homemade, but I always fess up and tell the truth because I want everyone to visit Mystic Muffin and experience the hilarious and heartwarming service you get from Elias, who works hard, crazy long hours to support his family.    And still, after decades in business Best. Apple. Cake. EVER!  (Must be legal eating age for a slice!*)   *TM:  Mysic Muffin wall advertising you can see as you drive along Richmond east of Jarvis."}
{"text":"i went here because i needed a quick lunch, and mystic muffin did not disappoint.   first, the problems: it's a little disorganized, not clear where you line up and the choices are kind of overwhelming. the people seated at the tables didn't look like the happiest bunch. i was a bit skeptical prior to ordering.  but, if you just get into line, order today's combo (or simply talk to the very nice man doing the food) you will not be disappointed. just listening to the  amusing banter between the people behind the counter, and the regular customers, is amusing.   i had the combo, which is a mishmash of stuff. the falafel was excellent, as was the hummus. the salad and pasta salad were great too. the lentils were pretty boring, and i'm not sure what their definition of spicy is, but it was not spicy at all.   when i got to the counter to pay, they asked if i had ever been before, and i told them i was new to town. they served me a wonderful slice of apple cake for free, which my pregnant sister scarfed down as if there was no tomorrow. she was very impressed.   i like this place. i could see going again to, for example, try the magic muffins."}
{"text":"Mystic Muffin has been on many top Toronto best cheap eats list as far as I can remember.  You always read the words of \"plentiful, healthy, and awesome flavours\" that goes on each list.  What some list fail to capture is the amazing and incredibly charismatic gentleman behind the counter.  He will make you smile if not laugh the entire time you're there.  Mystic Muffin names doesn't convey the true nature of this place ... don't expect a bakery.  You get to experience the most honest and fun conversation with a complete stranger (unless you're a regular) while enjoying some of the best and most affordable Mediterranean food in Toronto.     The lady in front of us was getting the full treatment of learning what Mediterranean hospitality is all about and how she's got to bring one of the banana bread loafs (only $5 for the entire thing and freshly made! That's his hustle) to her friends cottage if she ever wants a return invite.  He definitely knows how to work everyone into the conversation so even if there's a line, you never feel it once.  As for me, I wanted a piece of the famed apple cake and for $3, I got a good sized helping to bring back.  I could have eaten it there and then as there is a few tables available but his super clean but fairly spartan place is meant more as a take out spot.  Apple Cake - I get why there's much love for this.  It's like the best homestyle baked good you can find  in Toronto.  Tight crumbed and yet will quite light and moist, the cake is just the right sweetness that still gives the tender apple chunks the starring role.  I loved how the sugar created a light crisp top that shatters and crumbles while you take a bite.  It's very simple and homey but sometimes simple is the best.  4/5  The cake is a solid 4 star rave but the gentleman is a star in itself so 5 star from me.  Next time, I'm here for lunch!"}
{"text":"I got here almost 15 minutes before closing. Bad timing. All the reviews about the owners being upbeat and stuff did not apply. I got a cold pasta salad, and 2 cookies for a dollar (closing sale) as well they threw in a free blueberry banana bread.   The banana bread was really dry on the outside, and did not have a strong banana flavour at all.   The cookies were.... well, I was skeptical to even buying them at first, but since it was so cheap I was like why not. Even at that price, I would not recommend wasting a dollar.   As for the pasta salad, it consisted of green onions, olive oil and mint I think. Too oily for me and it had this sour taste to it.  Overall, everything was below average. Thumbs down. Sorry, guys."}
{"text":"We FINALLY made it here today, after several failed attempts.  What everyone says is TRUE! This place is the bomb. I can't get over the owner, Elias. Dude is a CHARACTER! He was so chatty that it took awhile to place an order. This guy could do stand up!  Note that Saturday is not the best day to go here - Elias told us flat out that it's quiet  on Saturdays so he doesn't have everything prepared off the regular menu. Go Monday-Friday.  Come prepared with a story - he gives free apple cake to people with good stories. If your story sucks, then you only get a cookie.  I had a falafel pita for $4 bucks. Falafel was really fresh as was the hummus. The rumours are true; we got free apple cake. (Elias ensured us a special \"Jenny Craig\" chip was baked into the cake to prevent weight gain).  I really wish this place was close to my home or work, because I'd definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"This small bakery just east of Toronto's busy Financial District makes a really tasty Apple Cake!  After trying a slice in-store, the Apple Cake earned a featured appearance at my family's Canadian Thanksgiving celebration.  Must thank my buddy Bahi K. for introducing me to this low profile neighbourhood gem.  I didn't get a chance to try the rest of the menu which includes nutritious meals, especially helpful for a bite on the run.  Oddly, despite the small space with limited seating, Mystic Muffin creates its own personality that's well reflected in the jovial servers that make you glad you visited.  The wall is covered with photos of people all over the world in front of famous landmarks wearing Mystic Muffin T-shirts.  I wonder if I snag a picture wearing such a shirt, if I too can join the wall of fame?    All said, a great distraction with delicious treats, well worth trying while strolling through this rapidly up and coming yuppie part of town."}
{"text":"Everyone once and blue moon, you have an experience that forever leaves an impression on you. Mystic Muffin was one of those experiences, and the story of the place is amazing.  Knowing nothing about this place, I walk in and get a falafel sandwich with a side of chickpeas. Upon going to pay for my meal, they said they only take cash, which I didn't have on me. They said I could stop by the next day and pay them or even later that week.. I stood there dumbfounded... I politely refused this very generous offer and went up the street to an ATM to pay them.  After finally digging into my very tasty falafel sandwich, I noticed a few homeless people coming to eat free of charge. It was then clear that place was special and deserving of the praise that it gets on Yelp.  After my meal, I was given a piece of apple cake as a parting gift since it was my first time there. It was absolutely delicious to say the very least. I would even go as far as to say it's one of the best things I've ever tasted in my life.  This is truly a unique place and I applaud the owners for their sincere effort to help those in the community. The fact that they serve delicious food is only a plus!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  Love it's quirkiness, the staff, and of course, the food.  The chocolate chip muffins, fresh banana bread and apple cake are incredible.  So so so good.  Seriously good.  Dangerously good!  Elias and Wonita are awesome, and I really love all they do for the community."}
{"text":"Apple cake was absolutely delicious; warm, fluffy, with a hint of salt and not overly sweet. Definitely worth the $18 if you're looking to share it with friends/family! Hope to try their combos soon!"}
{"text":"easily the best restaurant in toronto. if not, then it's certainly the one that just gave me a free piece of cake."}
{"text":"We stopped by here on a saturday morning after a trip to the St Lawrence Market. Ive been DYING to try this palce out forever it seems. My husband always thinks its some sort of homeless shelter or somethign because of the area and people he sees lingering around but from what ive heard...the owner is a cool guy and he actually feeds alot of homeless people. We ran in quickly and i was focused on one thing only:the applie cake. The owner was so funny and personable, it was also busy with construction guys comign in for their coffee. We ordered 2 apple cakes (1 was free!) and ended up beign upsold on the banana chocolate chip loaf. the entire loaf was like 5.00 and the apple cake was a dollar something. the owner was really entertaining and cracked jokes, usually i hate feeling pressured to buy extra stuff but we were happy to do it in this case - we considered it an \"Entertainment fee\" and the banana cake was really good too! :)"}
{"text":"I specifically made a trip here on Thursday on my way to work to try the infamous apple crumble.  However when I arrived shortly before 7:00 am they were not open.  I had checked their hours the day before to see when they open in the morning.  The sign on the door says 6:30 am.  The lights were on but no one was home!"}
{"text":"Sometimes when you are in a so so mood... and you hate when people asking you too many personal questions.. especially if it is someone you never met before about where do you live? what you do for a living? (I feel like saying live in yelp world, yelping full time for a living) I guess I am in one of my bitchy mood?!  Dropped by Mystic Muffin during my Indie Coffee Passport Run, just a sense of \"been here! ate that!\".   Toasted Pumpernickel Bagel with Butter and Med Coffee ($2.49) - Great price!  - The bagel itself was lightly toasted.. crispy outside and nice chewy inside.. and how I like it was not overloaded with butter...   Services was nice and quick. I would have order more but it was a 3 pm post lunch snack... :)  I know it is not fair to rate Mystic Muffin based on one visit...but sometimes it is the first impression that counts?   Maybe I should come back when I am in a better mood, maybe I will enjoy the jokes and humor better!"}
{"text":"This place is an excellent example of when the owners live and breathe their business. You will never be disappointed as the food is delicious and the service is quick and very, very friendly!"}
{"text":"I had to try this place because of the crazy rave Yelp reviews. Came here for lunch with a friend, and the place was pretty empty, but we saw a good number of people come in and out during our time here, most of whom seemed like regulars. The menu is kind of hard read/follow and is a little overwhelming because it seems like there is a lot of stuff on it, but overall ordering is not too hard. I got the veggie lunch platter and it came with SO MUCH food... falafel, rice, potatoes, three or four types of salad... and everything was really delicious and filled with Middle Eastern flavours. Recommend. A lot of reviews mention Elias, the owner, who seems like a cool and quirky guy. When we told him we were in the area because our client was nearby, he immediately guessed that we were auditors, and joked around with us a bit, although he wasn't as chatty as I expected... perhaps put off by the fact that we were auditors? (I know we are not the most likeable bunch of people.) He was still really nice though and gave us each a slice of their famous apple cake (normally you just get a choice between a pita and a cookie) because it was our first time visiting. And the cake actually was really really good! It was crunchy on the outside, but really moist on the inside with lots of apple chunks. Their hours make it kind of hard to come here if I'm not working around the area, since they close at like 5 every day, and it does look a bit dodgy from the outside, but looks are deceiving! If you are in the area, definitely worth checking out! Also forgot to mention that my lunch was only $8 AFTER TAX, it doesn't get any better than that!"}
{"text":"Great apple cake.  Falafel was good and the combo too but the potatoes were a little cold and hard.  Staff and owner are really friendly, I might go back tomorrow.."}
{"text":"The mystic muffin is the best! The owner is so nice, his banana bread and apple cake is so delicious!  One time I went in and wasn't sure what kind of wrap I wanted so I asked him to make me his favourite and it was so delicious!! Only $5 for a sandwhich! It's perfect if you need to grab something and run, this place is busiest during morning rush hour, lunch, and evening rush hour, for obvious reasons.  I would 100% recommend going there!"}
{"text":"Elias is friendly and makes great food for an excellent price."}
{"text":"Probably the quirkiest and most unique lunch spot in Toronto, from the perplexing exterior signage (\"world's best apple cake: must be legal eating age and never convicted for a slice\"**) to the zany witticisms inscribed on the walls for your while-you-wait enjoyment, to the hometown-friendly owner who has a zest for life that borders on Poppy in Happy-Go-Lucky proportions (note: don't watch that movie - it's crap).  I've been ogling Mystic Muffin*** from the outside for years but since it's primarily a lunchtime haven and I was always traipsing by in the wee hours (remind me again why I was in this neighbourhood alone, late at night??), I never had the chance to go inside. After a particularly unsatisfying attempt at a St. Lawrence Market lunch (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/mustachio-toronto#hrid:JRRt9zASX9-uy6Vow7REhg), I was beyond famished and would probably have eaten a baby duckling had someone presented one to me at that moment. I went into Mystic Muffin, was greeted with fanfare fit for British royalty, and prepared a lovely meal of egg salad, potatoes, tomatoes, falafel and cheese stuffed into a pita. First time customers get a large, complimentary slice of the famed \"world's best\" apple crumble. All of this for $4 including tax, and I was stuffed fatter than that one dude on Jerry Springer that had to be buried inside a concert grand piano. I nearly wept with joy at this deal.  Lentil aficionados will love this place. Lentils are served every day of the week except Wednesday. On Monday & Thursday, there's a vegetarian lentil soup made with eleven vegetables, garlic, onions and Lebanese hash. On Tuesday & Friday, it's lentils and rice. The cake was unreal. [Twenty minutes later I don't know how to expound on this fact. Just get it.]  I'm begging you: look through the photos and read the writing on the wall. Who is this guy?? \"Bring in one new customer, get a hug. Bring in two, get a slice of cake. Bring in three, get a free sandwich.\" I'm IN!  ** it's actually the world's best *** I saw no muffins"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but coming in after work for their special is not worth it at all. Everything was premade and they were just about to close. Everything tastes like it was about to go bad and to be frank it looked that way. Their once proud apple cake was disgusting as the apples had a very bad taste in my mouth. Overly disappointing!"}
{"text":"Upon walking in Elias immediately makes you feel welcome. Of course you have all read about his most amazing apple cake. Aside from that Elias makes the best falafel sandwich. As a middle eastern gal myself his is the most authentic in the city. So fresh and delicious!  Stop in once and you feel like family forever!"}
{"text":"Don't let the dated/\"run down\" exterior scare you, this place is AMAZING!  The prices are incredible and the quality cannot be beat. The apple cake is addictive! Best of all the owner is very caring and incredibly friendly. Despite a gritty exterior, the inside of the cafe is kept spotless.   Truly, a lunchtime (or anytime) gem located only a few blocks from the core of the Financial Distict."}
{"text":"I did it! I'm a such a yelper! I went to, and am about to review \"Mystic Muffin.\"   We went in around 2, and they were low on most things, I gather from how awesome they are they are really busy at lunchtime.   We had the falafel plate, a bagel sandwich, beef roll and the infamous apple cake. It was all cheap and delicious. The apple cake was free because it was our first time -- not an urban legend, they actually love giving first-timers free cake.   My dining companion thought the food was good, but not as amazing as everyone said. HOWEVER, he said they were the nicest people in the world so he understands the perfect reviews.  While we were in there they gave away free coffee and cake to homeless people and knew them by name. Really swell people, really nice lunch, really close to moss park for a picnic."}
{"text":"I had the beef sausage rolls $2.5 and the apple cake $3, both really tasty.  This place is cozy and people working there are really polite."}
{"text":"Our Airbnb gets the credit for introducing us to Mystic Muffin. Our downtown apartment was right next to it. Otherwise, we would have NEVER found it. It's a corner bakery with no-thrills. The inside is very quirky decorated with the most random trinkets. However, their muffins are good and cheap! Try the chocolate chip muffin if you have a sweet tooth. Skip their coffee if you want anything better than basic black coffee."}
{"text":"Great find,the banana blueberry bread was to die for. Don't leave the place without trying the apple cake. Owner is very friendly and quite a character, made us feel at home in a strange city"}
{"text":"I love the owner because he's just so friendly, hysterical and truly a kind person.  Every time I'm in Toronto I come and get his apple cake and I can not help to miss it a lot every time I crave for it. When I was there I notice a lot of people knew the owner and he's always talkative.  His baby girl is a cutie too doesn't cry and just giggles in her little baby carriage.  The babies not always there though :)  Awesome little place owned by a family and I totally support them!  Try it if you're in the area."}
