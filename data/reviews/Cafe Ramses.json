{"text":"One of the best bar-lounges-smoke spot in the city! Best days are wednesdays and fridays, where both barmaids, Andre-anne and a Andre-anne are simply entertaining! To relax, smoke up, drink and have a great experience! 5 star service no matter what time of day!!"}
{"text":"Nous sommes passé un mercredi soir et nous avons bien été servi. L'hôtesse nous a offert une banquette et quelques minutes plus tard elle est venu prendre notre commande. La shisha été bonne et le thé a la menthe aussi. Quelqu'un est venu nous voir a plusieurs reprises pour nous changer le charbon. Wow quel service. Nous sommes déjà allait a d'autres café shisha et celui-ci est très bien. C'est sûre on reviendra. En plus, nous avons aimé la musique : Du bon hip hop. Il y a aussi plusieurs écrans avec des événements sportifs. Le décor c'est dans un style égyptien avec banquettes, cousins et serpent. On pouvait s'y attendre par le nom du café. Au niveau du paiement ce ne fût pas compliqué. Pour le menu beaucoup de choix. Rien de très gastronomique mais c'est ok pour ce type d'endroit : frites, nachos et d'autres choix dans ce style."}
{"text":"This place has a lot of potential, but poor customer service takes away from the ambience and the quality of venue. Don't be expected to be greeted at the door, if you're lucky you may chase down a server to seat you-but the wait is not worth it. Better drive the extra 30 mins downtown and hit up exemplifying sheesha cafes like Gitana."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever !! I was looking forward to have shisha for a while already and so while I arrived in the early evening I wanted to be seated somewhere comfortable, the lady with blond hair seated me, along with my boyfriend in the most narrow and uncomfortable spot next to a wall and squished between a table next to us. Meanwhile the spacious and entire other side where ones could be seated also, was totally vacant ! And she, along with the other staff members basically were mocking us while I was asking them politely if I could possibly be seated there. After 5 prolonged minutes of speaking to them while remaining kind, they still refused to seat us elsewhere. The way they responded was totally disrespectful and making a client feel unworthy and they have most importantly lost a customer ! I'm going to let everyone know how they treat their clientele with a selfish demeanour."}
{"text":"I visited this place recently with my husband who likes a good sheesha once in a while. We both had a great time and even though I do not smoke, I loved the atmosphere, the decor and the super delicious waffle and mint tea!! Would definitely visit again"}
{"text":"The shisha is really good, but the decor is really bad with no theme.... Everyone has to order a drink in order to smoke. And if you want to drink alcohol you have to order food. Your friend cannot order to eat and you drink the alcohol, if you drink you have to eat. They only accept cash, there is a machine to take out money who doesn't work well and takes time. The service really sucks!!!!"}
{"text":"While on Vacation, i stumbled in this Gem of a lounge. The decor is awesome, brick/rock floor then nice sleek bar with beautiful bartenders and awesome hookah bar or \"chichas\" as they call them there. Prices are good, drinks are good, two types of hookahs, regular and premium. i guess the premium has more flavor?... they have appetizers that smelled good but i didn't get to try them. lots of beautiful people walk into this place, music is american top 40's. cigar bar and tables especially made to insert the hookah inside a whole. will definitely go back, next time im in Montreal"}
{"text":"Gorgeous sheesha lounge ! Tea coffee food and the sheesha all is amazing ! You must try their fries very very crispy ! Tea sheesha and all the food on their menu can easily be prepared at home but the vibe the atmosphere the decor cant be equaled anywhere !'"}
{"text":"Terrible service I am Egyptian I expected more arabic food then nachos! No grape leaves filled with rice the guy look at us as if we were aliens when we asked! The seating is ridiculous a table of 6 they palace u there if you are 4 they place 2 others with 10 seats not used right at your table what?? Food was ok too pricey for what they offer plus if you order alcohol you have to order food for 2 people Shisha included plus 1 plate of food 1 drink 1 coffee you pay close to 55$ plus ripe and tax!!! Ramses has changed so much over the years plus hearing drake and Kanye music all night not very fitting...:("}
