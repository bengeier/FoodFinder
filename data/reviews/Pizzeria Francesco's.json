{"text":"Ever since dining at Francesco's while on vacation in Vegas, I salivate just thinking of the Veal Parmigiana.  My boyfriend and I shared the Veal that was served just like a Pizza (almost bigger then a small pizza and flattened out encrusted in Parmesan).  It melted in your mouth and had the perfect flavor.  For our entree, we also split a nightly pasta special (seafood cavitelle) which was also incredibly good.  For startes we had the grilled calamari, goat cheese salad, and bruschetta to start with.  The calamari was our fave of the 3 apps.  The ambiance was very warm and charming yet upscale.  It's like you are in an Italian Villa.  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Every time I visit the lovely Las Vegas strip, lunch is always here. Cool staff: always friendly and cracking up jokes. Some type of deal always going on, usually 2 slices and a draft beer for $10. Bottom line they have great pizza for decent price. Tip: If you're with a big group of peeps just put all your $ together and get a large pizza ;)"}
{"text":"For some reason I wanted to eat pizza in Vegas, and since I was staying in Treasure Island I had to try this place out. I ordered a Medium Pepperoni Pizza ($23 total with tax) because by looking at the individual slices it was huge. The medium pizza took about 20 mins and it was kinda small....The six of us of course had one small slice each and was not too happy. The pizza was good but not great. The good thing was the pizza is fresh out of the oven and the cheese is melted perfectly. Overall, the food there was good and I probably won't go back. Make sure to ask someone about the whole pan size before ordering.   Food: 7 Service: 7 Price: 9 Clean: 8"}
{"text":"Not great not bad if you are in a hurry and need a bite then stop in if you are looking for a great pizza then keep looking."}
{"text":"Little pizzeria in Treasure Island Hotel & Casino.  Walked by this pizzeria many times while visiting TI but never stopped by until last weekend when I was in town.  I regret not stopping in before. I had a slice of their pepperoni pizza.  The crust was nice a thin, with the right amount of sauce and cheese and pepperonis.  The Pizza is a little pricey but it was worth it because it was that good.    I really don't get the bad reviews but to each his own.  I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before trying this place because they might have kept me from stopping by.    I loved it, so there.   And I do plan on stopping by for a slice or two every time I'm in town....  Yeah I was that pleased with their pizza!"}
{"text":"For starters they want you to get in line exactly opposite of what their signs say. Second chef was rude as can be, Tip for him, the pizza cooks faster when your not opening the door every five seconds to look at it. Also during your rush maybe have a couple pies going so there would be less wait time. The whole reason I'm writing this is that a girl had a slice of cheese to go that got cold. She went up to chef and asked for him to warm it up or replace it. He took he cold piece and put it back on the pizza bar to be reserved and grabbed her a fresher one. I would have left right then but figured i had a whole pizza coming so i wouldn't have any of those scraps. The whole thing was greasy and nasty. Stay away from this place, they have plenty of good places right across the strip. Worst 25 min wait for what i was severed ."}
{"text":"If I could give it no stars, I would. I don't think I have ever had worse service, and the pizza was so bad that I threw it away. Totally awful pizza and people. Try secret pizza or Five50 instead."}
{"text":"Overpriced at $5 per one-topping slice, but the quality is pretty good.  Not bad for a late-night snack.  Service was slow."}
{"text":"I rather eat Eillo's, this pizza sucked. If I were to go to church and steal about 100 of those tasteless wafers they give you and go to the market and buy a jar of prego and some nasty 0% skim milk cheese and tossed that delightfully tasty work of art in the microwave for about 50 seconds, this is what you would get. Did I mention I am a New Yorker"}
{"text":"I haven't had good pizza in a long time but this was excellent. I came back for seconds the next day. I loved the New York Style. It's hot, fresh, greasy and tasty. Just how we like it in the Northeast.  If you have any knowledge of how New York style pizza is supposed to be, you will enjoy these hardy slices. Skip the Domino's, Papa Johns and Pizza Hut and get a slice of New York. I suspect that the less than average reviews come from people who have no idea what New York pizza is all about. Kudos to this pizzeria for knowing what \"New York Style\" means.  LOVED  IT..."}
{"text":"If you are craving pizza, have a headache and staying at TI, this place will suffice.  Otherwise I would suggest finding something else. The dough was stiff like cardboard. Similar to what you find with frozen pizzas but a little worse.  The garlic bread was a bit better but not your typical garlic bread or even garlic roll. It was a twisted bread with unmelted shredded cheese sprinkled over the top. I wouldn't dine here again."}
{"text":"Oily greecy cheap pizza yet Over price ,slice of fir 6.50$ ,Sorry to say I hated your pizza because it s****s"}
{"text":"Good place to go if you want something quick after the pool or before a show.  Nothing special although they have big slices and they do deliver to your room if you have those late night binges."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick bite before we checked in to our room. The pizza tasted ok - wasn't the best I have had but wasn't the worst. THe garlic bread was very lacking in flavor. It was a little spendy but no worse than anywhere else in Vegas. My one complaint is that it was way too hot. We ate in a hurry so we could get back to the cooler air in the casino."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza and wings to grab while on the go or need a break. Fast service, overall a good experience every time I go."}
{"text":"i dont know why, but the cheese pizza here was one of the best tasting slices i have ever had...anywhere.  its 4 bucks a slice and they are large slices...a decent value.  the cheese to me seemed to be a blend of parmesan and mozzarela and the crust had just the right amount of floury-crisp to crack and break when folded for eating on the go but still stay intact.  i thought it was excellent"}
{"text":"Ate here today, walked in and stood by the sign that says \"order here\" and got glared at by the Asian pizza chef guy   (not sure what you call a pizza maker so I'll go with pizza chef)   doesn't say anything to us at all and eventually asked us what we want he was just being a dick about it.   Got the pizza eventually it was like wet, saturated in like grease I assume but it looked like water so off the get go it looked gross. Go and pick the slice up and the pizza falls apart in half (uploaded a photo)   The pizza itself tasted pretty alright even being wet and in half at this point but all of these events that happened in my 8 minute stay here had to be documented but you'll be too drunk to care because this is Vegas haha.   Don't be a dick Asian guy"}
{"text":"On the first night in Vegas, most of our group didn't want to go too far for dinner. We'd have to get ready to hit up the club in a few hours, so we walked around the lobby and found this place. Pizza seemed like a quick fix, so we ordered a large combo. As huge as it was, the crust was extremely thin and the toppings slid off as soon as you took the first bite. Luckily I grabbed a couple of forks, because that's what I ended up using to finish my slice. Some of my friends ended up folding it to try to keep everything from spilling out. It was good taste wise and we killed the rest the next morning, but overall it was a-okay."}
{"text":"Waiting for my show, Cirque du soleil, and this place is right across from the show.  It was quick and not too bad.  2 slices and a beer for $10.  Pizza was not too bad.  middle of the road really.  thin crust.  would eat here again, if the situation presented itself in the same manner. would not go out of my way to eat here, but would not say no, if I were nearby and hungry."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious pizza, fantastic service even though they were crazy busy. Obviously a popular spot!"}
{"text":"Hooray for the $4 slice!  For nyc-style standards, these can't be considered large slices.  They're medium at best.    You have to be skeptical of most \"pizzerias\" on the strip, especially if they're located inside a casino that was erected in the mid-90s.  Now I'm not saying that the place is old, I'm just saying not to put too much stock in a place found in a casino that's Caribbean-themed.  For what it's worth, the pizza has a decent flavor.  But it's short on size and long on price.  Authentic NYC-style should not be on your to-do list while in Vegas; drinking until you forget should be.  The irony is that I obviously didn't drink enough to forget about this place.  Maybe next time..."}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing!  My boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place while on our way to Cirque Du Soleil, Mystere, inside treasure island.  We waited till the last minute to eat before the show without having reservations anywhere.  At first, we had decided on Social House, but upon approaching the hostesses and asking to see the menu we decided not to eat here based on their rude behavior.  They stood there and stared at us like we were speaking a different language.  Thank God we choose not to eat there or else I never would have had the chance to dine at Francesco's   We walked right in and the service was amazing, and I love great service.  Our waiter was great and even brought out wines for us to sample when we were unable to decide on a bottle off of their extensive wine menu.  The food was amazing, I loved the linguine and clams.  It was to die for!  It has been about 2 months since we ate here and I still think of how bad I want to go back to have the same dish.  The restaurant itself is also very romantic with dim lighting and candles, perfect for couples."}
{"text":"2 slices of pizza and a soda cost $12! More expensive than New York.  As you see it sitting out on the counter, you had a feeling it wasn't that great. As you order, they warm it up in the oven and serve it to you.  When a pizza got low on the display, they simply stuck a pre-made pizza in the oven. There was a whole rack (probably 8-10 pizzas) already pre-made waiting to be placed in the oven. No telling how long it has been sitting on the kitchen counter but I'm guessing it doesn't help the freshness.  If you have a choice, go elsewhere. Heck, take the tram to Mirage as the TI buffet is also bad."}
{"text":"Waiting to watch Mystere and stopped by for a quick snack. Pizza had a thin crust and wasn't very fresh. I did see other people chowing down on the chicken wings. It might've been sitting for a bit because he retoasted it in the oven. Cant complain too much, I didnt have high expectations but it was expensive. About $6 for a regular size slice."}
{"text":"The tomato sauce on the pizza seemed old and flavorless. The cheese was sparse and the crust was dull.I understand it's Vegas and the price of pizza is going to be bloated but it's hard to screw up pizza so at least give people a break price wise. At five dollars a slice for cheese pizza you'd expect better. Advertising hand tossed delights is deceptive because you'd expect a certain manner of attention toward the making of the pizza.  If you're in a rush or need to just eat something relatively cheap compared to all the mediocre overly priced food around Vegas, have a couple of slices."}
{"text":"4 stars? really???  I thought this place was HORRIBLE.  We ended up eating at Pizzaria Francesco because we had to meet up with some people at Treasure Island.  Francesco was the first restaurant we saw when we walked into the hotel and it looked like a nice restaurant so we decided to try it out.  We ordered 2 pizzas between 4 people because we didn't want to over eat before we started drinking.  We ordered a peperoni and sausage pizza http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/M_n2pMFM8fqUtgACIBeIZg/l and gawd I don't even remember what the other pizza was because I didn't even bother to take a picture...  SUPER greasy and too strong on the tomato flavor... After eating one piece, eating another one was work. We didn't even finish the pizzas. I also got the house red wine and wow... it tasted like the wine was sitting there open for a while :(  The ambiance was pretty nice, the service was ok... but the food was terrible and it was definitely OVERPRICED.  I rather eat a pizza hut pizza.  NONE of us like the pizzas here.  This was a TOTAL dinner FAIL!"}
{"text":"Stopped by with my wife after a night of gambling. Ordered 3 slices of pepperoni to split.  Service was friendly and quick. The pizza was pretty good and hit the spot. It gets a little busy when the shows let out, but we managed to bypass that and we're in and out in 15 minutes. Crunchy crust and not too greasy. I would recommend them for a quick inexpensive slice of pizza."}
{"text":"Before going out on Saturday night, we wanted to grab a quick bite. Since we were staying in TI, figured it would be a good idea. But, it was not.  Ordered 2 larges - one supreme & cheese+tomatoes as well as an italian salad. The pizzas ALONE came out to be $75. While it was 8 large slices, they just didn't taste very good. The cheese was lacking...salt maybe? Then the supreme was a thicker crust (which I liked better) but there was just TOO much topping on it.   The salad was wilty and disappointing as well.  However, the garlic bread (that look liked garlic knots) looked really good. Maybe that's the only thing worth trying/eating there.  If you can...skip!"}
{"text":"I didn't have extremely high hopes for this small pizza shop in T.I. but it was convenient for a late night bite since we were staying at the casino. It managed to curb my hunger but didn't leave me wanting more.   I ordered a slice of cheese and a garlic bread with sauce. The pizza was barely warm and would have been much better had it been fully heated. I think the worker only reheated the garlic bread in the oven and the pizza was taken directly from the display, which has heat lamps but definitely was not keeping the pizza super hot. I was surprised to find that my favorite part of the meal was the dipping sauce with the garlic bread. It seemed creamier than usual marinara and had a great flavor. I couldn't get enough and even dipped my pizza in the sauce."}
{"text":"Stood in line for over 30min for 2 slices! Only one guy was working both making pizzas, reheating slices, and serving people.  He was completely inefficient, spending the majority of the time checking and rechecking if a pizza had finished baking.  Meanwhile there are 3 fresh pizzas on display and a line of 20 people are just staring at him waiting to be served.  But even worse there were three guys at the register just staring at the one guy working and goofing off.  We almost missed our show and it was a complete waste of time. I would never recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Considering this is Vegas where all foods are overpriced, it is a 3, but elsewhere, this would rank a 2. That's because the food is mediocre and the service is... well, they want to trick you and give you the facade of being all \"high-class\" and stuff, but it fails. The waiter forgot to bring our wine and I had to ask another waiter because ours disappeared. Pasta with clams is VERY salty, but very generous with clam content. Also, the carpet is fugly... so, don't look down if you want to enjoy the faux expensive ambience. Lol."}
{"text":"I have never had a meal in Vegas that was so amazing that I actually got a to-go box because I didn't want to waste it.  As if we had a microwave in our room.  We had an offer for this restaurant so we decided to give it a try.  I ordered the lobster risotto special of the night.  I have never had anything so delicious in my life.  The risotto was served in a rich cream sauce that was just infused with lobster flavor.  There were lobster chunks throughout.  It was amazing.  Normally I would have just tried to eat the lobster meat and leave the risotto, but there was so much of it.  I forgot what my husband had because I was just so into my own dish.  That night, I put my to-go box on ice.  The next day, I ran hot hot water in the sink and tried to warm up the container the best I could.  Yes, it was totally worth the effort.  Every time we walk through Treasure Island and pass this restaurant, I check their menu and specials board to see if they have this dish.  Unfortunately, I haven't seen it again on my visits."}
{"text":"I'm sorry; I am such a pizza fanatic; was born in New York; from Chicago and in fact have been traveling to Italy since a child (so I enjoy a good authentic Sicilian pizza). This pizza is pre cooked; and then re-heated; so first and foremost just notate that.  There is a Japanese man making the pizza; who's somewhat grumpy and awfully hard of hearing.   My first and ONLY visit to this location (as I am a local to Vegas) I ordered 4 slices of Pepperoni. There were 4 available at that time. I went to the counter; paid, and waited. Soon thereafter since it was just a reheated slice; only 1 slice came out. I asked if the other remaining slices were on the way; and he immediately got defensive and told me that I had only ordered 1 slice. I showed him my receipt which validated that I ordered 4 slices; however at this point now; there were only 2 slices left. The other slices were being re heated for guests who had ordered and not yet paid behind me. I let the Manager know that because I not only asked specifically for the pepperoni, but also paid for it; that the remaining slices should be coming to me. She apologized and said that wasn't the way it worked; but that I was welcome to pick another slice instead. I let her know I wanted what I paid for and nothing more; to which she replied \"sorry\". I told her at that point to just give me a cheese; which was less expensive that the pepperoni. No refund was given for the difference in price.  I figured that this pizza had better be some damn good stuff for me to have had to put up with mediocre customer service; and $5 slices. It was AWFUL! Tasted as if it was reheated (which obviously it was)................sauce was nasty; almost Ragu tasting as funny as that sounds; and the cheese they use is either old or its just very cheap. This pizza was gross. Gross Gross Gross. I threw the remaining slices out, as not even the other Manager I work with wanted to eat anymore and felt the same.   If you want GOOD AUTHENTIC PIZZA go to Sicili's on Twain Ave (Just behind the Venetian; passed Paradise. Its CHEAP, and its SO GOOD you'll crave it weekly (I'm not kidding you). $9 for a Large. And they slow churn their ranch every morning for the wings. (Owned by a small family)......................................  Stay far away from this joke of what they call themselves a pizzeria. I'll be the first to clap when they close"}
{"text":"Expensive but it was delicious and the people working here were really nice. One of the cheaper options at Treasure Island. Do recommend, but there isn't much seating because it's all bar stool style."}
{"text":"I made one mistake and that was coming here during the day when I was sober and not drunk.  The night before Adam and I walked by here and thought they had a pretty good deal so when we woke up hungover and ready to get something into our systems we thought this would be a good option since it was quick for us. Well the special was only at night and wasn't going on during the day but we were already here.   We both got a slice of pepperoni and a garlic bread as well as 2 fountain drinks. There was only a few other people in the restaurant so we were helped immediately and it took next to no time to get our food warmed up.  There are some tables you can sit at and there is also a bar top where you can sit and eat too. We got a couple of seats at the bar top and were able to enjoy in peace.   The pizza was okay. It was nothing amazing. There were no great spices or flavors that stood out to us. It was just some pizza. The garlic bread was the same. It was a little tough and there really was no garlic flavor. I actually had to use the dipping sauce it came with to get it down and I hate putting my bread in sauce.   I felt it was all very over prices as we were paying over $5 for a slice of pizza which is crazy. If you are going to charge that much then you should at least make sure the pizza is good.   The deal my husband saw the night before was for pizza, wings, and a beer for $12 and that would be a great deal but they didn't have it out when we were there. I am sure if I was drunk I would have really enjoyed my meal.   Overall, ehhh. I won't come back even if I was drunk because I know there is better elsewhere but if you are drunk and it is late and you are looking for something to eat in TI then I would suggest coming here otherwise save your money."}
{"text":"Waiting 20 minutes for a meatball sub.  No problem charging me for it.  I go up and ask for my order.  Claims I never ordered it......it was the only thing I ordered from them.  No sorry for the wait.  No oops i forgot  (I would've understood).  Just got, \"I'll make it for you now.\"  Not doing me any favor since i paid 25 minutes ago for it.  One less place to go in Vegas for food options.  Too bad to.  It was good and I come to Vegas from New York about 5 times a year."}
{"text":"This pizza with give you penis aids, barely any sauce and cheese the chicken wings were old and soggy..hard to screw up a pizza and still get 45 dollars..."}
{"text":"The minute we walked into this place, I looked at the pizza and knew I'd taste terrible compared to the pizza I'm used to.  Just looked super greasy and gross so I opted for the Calzone which turned out to be not too great.  I got some cole slaw on the side which was basically the run of the mill prepackaged type. Slim pickings for dinner while inside TI.  Needed to conveniently get something to eat after our nap... which leads me to believe good quick food is relatively low supply in most of Vegas.   I could maybe muster up 2.5 stars for this place to be fair, but I won't be back to eat pizza here for sure.  Luckily I didn't get sick like some of the other sad yelpers before me. The place is clean and they guy who worked here seemed friendly.  Maybe it's just the prices that you pay for this type of food in Vegas that really annoys everyone."}
{"text":"More like 2.5, but I'll give them the benefit.   This is painfully average pizza that benefits from being fast and open \"late\". We were hungry and were hoping for some good za before heading up to the room and settled for this.   Kind of expensive with a bland crust. Meh."}
{"text":"I tried vegetarian pizza and it was good! It had nice thin crust and the tomato sauce was not too heavy!"}
{"text":"Best casino pizza (is that a thing?) I have ever had. Just greasy enough and the slices were humongous. Super thin crust and just crunchy enough. Delicious pizza, friendly service and quick!"}
{"text":"I guess I can't really expect much from a quick italian food pick-up joint in Las Vegas! I expected it to be decent, but it was so bland and just horrible for my palate.   I got the special, the sausage and wild mushroom calzone - needless to say the calzone looked like a baby rock and not even cooked on the exterior. I think the sausage and wild mushrooms have a good flavor, but the dough is what turned me off. There was about an inch and half of eatable calzone. The people working behind the counter were not too friendly, and I just wanted to get out of there as soon as I could.  Overall, I will definitley not be coming back here!"}
{"text":"After being traumatized at Kahunaville the night before, we decided to give this place a go for a quick pre-game bite on the way to Tryst.   Our slices were HUGE, although it looks like it could be hit or miss, with  no exact science behind the pizza wheel. They were definitely a step up from mall pizza slices, and another step up from the big name delivery guys, but not as good as CPK or the like.    Greasy, but in a good way - if that's possible - ingredients seem legit, and the selection is average for a cafeteria style pizza joint.   It's a little on the pricey side for what it is, but it's very convenient if you're already at T.I. and a bargain compared to what your other in house options are. As stated by others, probably not something I'd go out of the way for, but beats the other fast food options in the immediate area."}
{"text":"Tried this place because they had a slice of pizza w/beer for $7.95.   Service - Nice employees here.  Seating - Plenty of room and like the bar style seating.  Taste & Size - The pizza was kinda small and flat, and the taste wasn't as great.  Wouldn't come back again or recommend it."}
{"text":"Wow this is by far the absolute worst slice of pizza I've had in Vegas! The taste was horrible. Not just because I've lived in NY all my life and am accustomed to a good slice from most places. I can appreciate a good pizza no matter where it's made but just pure taste of this pizza was worse than a frozen pizza. Stay away! Save your money."}
{"text":"Our first night in Vegas we happened upon this place because we had just lost all the money we were willing to part with at the Treasure Island black jack tables. (This is false advertising in my mind, for there was no treasure on this island.) We went in and asked for a table for two and even though there were clearly many open tables the hostess informed us we needed a reservation so we said we'd take the next available, which happened to be about 30 minutes later. Annoying, but I'm sure it's not the hostess' fault these crappy rules exits.  Once we were seated everything else was fairly enjoyable about the evening. Our waiter was awesome and the food was better than decent. We shared Crispy Risotto Fritters, which may have been my very favorite part of the meal, salad and a white sauce pizza. While, it was definitely casual dining and pricey for that, it was less expensive and the quality was higher than I expected considering we were in Vegas."}
{"text":"So we cheaped out and got the pizza.  I just couldn't stomach paying $27 for chicken tortellini!  Word to the wise:  The pizzas are seriously HUGE!!!!  Please do not order one pizza per person!  That's what we did, thinking we would get meal sized individual pizzas.  Why the server didn't say something is beyond me!  Maybe he thought we really ate that much or something?  We wound up taking almost a whole pizza in a to-go box.  I really enjoyed the bread basket and the olive tray.  It was definitely a nice touch.   I'd come back, but would probably order something else next time."}
{"text":"Just the other night the wife and I were waiting to see Mystere and wanted to grab a bite.  I have been here for 8 out of the last 11 days and I was getting tired of high priced everything.  We had some time to kill and decided to find a place to eat.  I am so glad that we stumbled across Pizzeria Francesco's.  I must warn everyone, you wait in line, and there is very little seating, but if you want a nice sit down joint go to Spago and pay 30 for a pizza!.    They had awesome specials and I had a slice of pizza, which was huge and tasty, 5 wings and a beer for 12 dollars.  Some might say wow this is a little high, but for Vegas it was the deal of the day.  We also ordered a salad that was awesome.  Looking around I saw some Calzones and they also looked good.  If you want a cheap meal that will fill you up, I recommend that you stop in here."}
{"text":"This is the most horrible pizza I have ever had. The place knows customers will walk in due to the heavy foot traffic around and therefore don't give a shit about the quality of food. Their toppings seemed frozen...not fresh for sure. The crust was melted plastic at best. The only average thing was that the beer was cold."}
{"text":"If you are drunk hammered I'm sure the pizza hits the spot. If you haven't had much to drink. Skip this place and order dominoes.  Crust was raw. Supreme slice had 3 pieces of pepperoni and one piece of sausage.   Seriously I've had better   Digiornio pizza."}
{"text":"Have to disagree with previous reviews...had ahi tuna tartar and roast clams for starters; these were the best part of the meal... entrees...rigatoni with sausage etc and papparadelle artichokes etc(they forgot to mention it was dressed with thick creamy sauce   filling, yes tasteful no...decor is Disneyland cheezy and proximity to slots created a din that was annoying...only reason we went was convenience while staying at ti before going to KA... definitely not my favorite Italian restaurant"}
{"text":"Okay so after having dinner at Isla's the night before we didn't want to eat at TI anymore. We went to the belligo buffet but line was to long so we came back to TI (where we were staying). We decided on this place and I'm glad we did.   I had the alfredo and added chicken, my friend had a ceaser salad and my other friend had the calamari. All our dishes were good. The only bad part was that my dish was 26 dollars!! wth! I was so hungry I didn't really look at the prices but now that I look back, the pasta its self was probably 20 and to add the chicken it was 6. DAMN! But its coo, it made my tummy really happy! My friends dishes were also gud ( i had a taste lol)   Will def go back!"}
{"text":"With their new addition of a 10\" gluten-free pizza for $12 it is the perfect option for two people to share a bite. Have also tried the calzones and salad which we have also enjoyed. Keep in mind you may wait for the gluten-free. And make sure you keep an eye on it so they actually make it. We are still waiting for ours 30 minutes later.  But at least it's freshly made and the management is very professional and aware when there are glitches. Four stars because of the lack of prep-time awareness which is unusual as we have had great experiences in the past. We are staying here at TI and will be back. YES, the gluten-free is that good. Big thank you to supervisor and management for your consideration."}
{"text":"If only I had readthe reviews prior to eating here.  The night before Id eaten at a pizza place in the ny ny, in my quest to find that level of deliciousness once again I stopped by this place.  While eating it I noticed it didn't taste quite right.  Well, two hours later my body was making every attempt to rid it's self of this bacterial hayday.  I was throwing up for honestly 2 hours and after 5 hours the diarehia tapered off.  Unfortunately, I spent my entire last day in Las Vegas holed up in my room, never more than a few feet from a bathroom.  I will never return to this establishment and would recommend others steer clear unless you want to utilize their unadvertised weight loss program ."}
{"text":"Pretty average pizza, and the wait time for a slice was ridiculous, but hey, the price was fair for it being on the Vegas strip. Generous slices too that hit the spot after a day of seeing the sites.   If you're near Treasure Island and you want some okay pizza that'll fill you up, this is your place."}
{"text":"if you find yourself UNABLE to escape the inevitable fate of coming here, DEFINITELY get a pizza. we had the mushroom + caramelized onions white pizza and it was pretty good.   also, the mints at the hostess desk are pretty good.  here is where the goodness ends.  NOT GOOD: $60 for average pasta and chicken parmigiana   NOT GOOD: trying to PUSH extra random stuff under the guise that it was complimentary. i understand the need for waiters to SELL the menu with logical pairings but O RLY??  NOT GOOD: hostess sitting us by the door and ALLEGING that it was the only seat available despite the OBVIOUS lack of other similarly numbered parties and empty tables in the premises. we assumed it was because they were waiting for other 4-people parties with reservations but NO ONE CAME IN. our table by the door allowed us to verify our suspicious. IRONY... you taste like mediocre Italian cuisine.  NOT GOOD: perhaps i have been spoiled by the excesses of i dunno, REALITY but i thought it was rather sneaky that they charged one of us $5.00 for a soda. then i realized it was because they charged us for the refill. note that the glasses were those artsy oblong glasses filled to the brim with ice.  TWO STARS for the pizza. that is all."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. The crust was thin and crisp in a pleasant way. One of my top pizzas. Definitely recommend coming here and having a slice."}
{"text":"Hey, we're in a recession folks...so while I would have loved to have eaten at a different celebrity restaurant each night of my Vegas stay, I decided to be a bit more frugal.  My friend was craving pizza, so the nice lady at the front desk recommended Francesco's.  There was no wait, our server was efficient, and the food was good.  I started with the caesar salad.  The lettuce was crisp, and the croutons were crunchy and buttery (although there were only about 3 of them).  The dressing was creamy and tastey, although it lacked that bite that anchovy paste would have lent it.  I also was not offered fresh cracked pepper until I was halfway done with my salad.  We ordered a margerita pizza to share.  The crust was undercooked and floppy, for lack of a better description.  The sauce was WAY too salty, although it did have a nice garlic flavor.  There was a nice helping of torn basil leaves sprinkled over top.    The bread was probably the best part of the meal; they give you a chunky tomato tapenade to spread over it, or a combination of olive oil and balsamic venegar to dip it in.  They also provide a little cup of olives.  This is a nice place to stop in for a low-key meal.  The three of us spent $20 each, including tip.  I wouldn't come here though unless you're staying at TI and it's convenient; it's not a destination."}
{"text":"This place had the worst damn wings I've ever tried in my life. It tasted old and soggy. Also, a large pizza with 9 of these sorry excuses for chicken wings amounted to almost $50. Avoid this place, you're better off finding a pizza place of the strip."}
{"text":"We were on our way to RA Sushi, but noticed this pizza joint on the way. Glad we stopped. Pizza crust was crispy, just the way I like it. Pepperoni and spinach."}
{"text":"Abstract: Mediocre, forgettable pizza at a premium price served at a snail's pace. Go elsewhere if you can.   I had entirely forgot about this place (and maybe for good reason). We ate here while staying at TI after coming in from show at another property. A better idea would have to eat wherever we were for the show, or ANYWHERE else en route to TI.   It must have been a Friday or Saturday night. The queue was so long it left the restaurant and encroached on walkway that separate it from Mystere's theatre. To make it worse, the service is so goddamn slow here, sometime during your interminable wait the thought that they are purposefully slow to artificially create a club-like queue to attract more patrons starts creeping into your psyche.   The pizza sucks. Honestly, the only reason I recalled eating it was that the RJ (valley newspaper) was proclaiming in an article about Cosmo's 'Secret Pizza' (go there instead if you have the time) that this place was the start of great pizza on the strip. Immediately I thought \"WTF!\"; are these people writing this shit major shareholders of this business or something? That pizza sucks. Thanks to Yelp I can now voice my experience in a proper forum. - E"}
{"text":"Great pizza! It was perfect! Naturally I had to dab some grease off but it's the perfect amount of doh with a slight crisp and it was really yummy! They have chicken wings too but they're like curry flavor, just sayin' don't get me wrong tho they were delicious! They have a couple beers on tap and it was a great place to stop for a bite to eat and a bit to drink before we entered cirque se solei next door! We liked it! The service was good as well."}
{"text":"Pizza was sub par. Cheese pizza isn't hard to screw up but they did. Being honest. I have ate here a few times before and it was always good."}
{"text":"The pizza isn't very good, I'm afraid, and the oil tasted burned. As far as it being a New York style pie, as they claim, that's an insult to both New York and pizza. The best thing in the place is the poster advertising Parmesan cheese."}
{"text":"I heard some people talking about this pizza place and they said the pizza was amazing. So I decided to go try a slice...... I was not impressed.   They had numerous pizzas cooked and just sitting there waiting to be eaten. However, they all need reheating.   I ordered my piece then waited for them to reheat it in the oven.   Not only did the slice look not so good..... It really didn't taste good. It's definitely nothing to brag about or write home about.   It served its purpose for a midnight snack. That's about it. I had it twice as a snack. I guess its convenient the hotel has a place for the midnight munches."}
{"text":"I don't know if there's 2 Pizzeria Francesco's in TI but the one I went to looks nothing like the photo here.  It's a small walk through cafeteria style fast pizza joint located right beside the poker room...so they get my business when the tournament is on break :-)   Pricey slices that are loosely based on NY style pizza.  Greasy, tasty, fairly big slices...I wouldn't go out of my way for this place but fits the bill when I'm playing poker at TI"}
{"text":"Okay so we went to this place 4 times while in Vegas, honestly the pizza is amazing and everything on the menu was delicious. Their ranch is very creamy and made for pizza! The garlic bread was awesome and not over seasoned or oily. And the wings are fried with a spicy batter which is so much better than tossing in a sauce. The slice and beer deal is great and I will definitely be back here on another vegas adventure!"}
{"text":"Honestly this place was perfect for a late night snack while I was out and about the casino floor. The food was tasty and the price point was decent for a hotel snack shop. The man running the register was also very friendly and helpful. I only ordered a salad so I can't judge the pizza but I would go back."}
{"text":"Lucked out as the cheese pizza that I ordered was fresh out of the oven. I thought the sauce was flavorful but a little salty. For a reference point, think Sbarro's."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved their cheese pizza, the sauce tasted like fresh homegrown tomatoes and there was lots of fresh stringy mozzarella cheese. Definitely the best pizza I've had"}
{"text":"7-11 has better pizza and at a better price too. The sauce and cheese isn't too bad but the crust was like cardboard. Go eat at Johnie Rockets instead"}
{"text":"Super thin crunchy pizza which normally I love but this place is nothing but grease and tastes like cardboard. Way over priced would have much rather crossed the street and gotten food at the mall."}
{"text":"Pizza is delicous here but my freakin large combo came out to be $45 with a soda.  Kinda rediculous yeah?"}
{"text":"Nothing exciting about this pizza place except for the big slices and the high prices. My friends and I decide to order a large extreme pizza and it was expensive. The pizza was good though, but a little on the greasy side. It fed about six girls and there were left overs. This place is like a little joint near the mystere theater. There were stools for you to sit at and not really regular tables like in the photos here. I wouldn't go here again plus I'm not really a huge fan of pizza."}
{"text":"Horrible service! Stood there waiting by the order here sign being ignored by the girl working there, another guy walks up behind me and she takes his order instead so I decide it's not worth the hassle and leave"}
{"text":"I saw some of the reviews here before I came downstairs to eat here and figured that maybe some of the reviews were being unfair. The pizza is definitely pretty greasy but sometimes that's what you're looking for. For the price, ($5.50) a slice for one topping, it wasn't bad. The pizza was good and it filled me up late at night. I was lucky enough to show up when there was nobody in line so I probably lucked out when it came to the wait. There are better places in Vegas but I wouldn't hesitate to come back if I was in the area and was craving a slice."}
{"text":"Went here looking for something to eat that was fast.  Turns out the only thing that was fast were my bowels after I ate here.  I got mild food poisoning along with a friend that ate here the same night.    Now if the food was really really good I could maybe maybe deal with it and take my chances but it was mediocore at BEST.  Nothing really tasty or unique about their pizza.  Also, the service was slow considering the amount of customers they had.  I'm done!"}
{"text":"With all of the good food in Vegas do not bother to come here!!! Greasy BLAND pizza that literally tastes like grease and nothing. I got a slice of pepperoni pizza (how do you mess that up) and a garlic roll. Both were incredibly bland and had no flavor. I was in a hurry to get to the airport and that's the only reason I popped into this place. I wish I would have saved my money for the Burger King inside the airport sadly."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were in line for Mystére buzzed and we needed a quick fix. Pizzeria Francesco's was just in front of the will-call desk.   They had a long line but we had no choice. The line was only moving slowly because the pizzas are half baked. You order your slice and it goes back in the oven to get fully baked. We had a slice of Pepperoni with Sausage and the Deluxe. While waiting for \"the chef\" to take orders, I noticed the manager come from the back room and didn't bother asking one of her employees to help get rid of the line as there was 4 more employees standing around.  The Pepperoni with Sausage was okay, adding a little bit more meat would've made it a little bit better. The Deluxe had green peppers, onions, mushroom, italian sausage, pepperoni and black olives. Two big slices of greasy pizza cost me $11.89.   The texture of the pizza made me give Pizzeria Francesco 4STARS."}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here to grab a quick bite just to hold us over until our Cirque show was finished.  Hubs got a piece of pepperoni pizza and I got a fruit salad.  The fruit salad was good, very fresh with yummy pineapple, strawberries, blueberries, etc.  My hubby's pizza was a greasy mess!  It looked so nasty, I can't believe he ate it.  He did use several napkins to blot the grease, but that didn't seem to help.  The crust was also burned to a crisp so he almost chipped a tooth on that!  All in all, if you don't really care what you're eating, go for it.  If you want a solid piece of pizza, look elsewhere."}
{"text":"The pizza was so greasy and oily the cheese literally slid off the dough . Not worth my $12 for two slices would not be going back here I expected New York style pizza ."}
{"text":"Solid little pizza spot located in tressure Island. I had the supreme. It was a large slice and hit the spot. Best part was there was no waiting it was ready and just heated. So perfect for late nights and those super hungry moments. Casual dining place. I wouldnt get dressed up to come here. I would eat here again."}
{"text":"We were waiting in line to see the 9:30pm of Mystere and didn't want to wait in the long line, so we decided to grab a slice of pizza, since we had such a late lunch.  We both got the sausage,since it was the freshest.  It was very cheesy, greasy, and the crust was just mediocre.  I had to use 10-15 napkins to sop up all the grease.  We ate it, and it served it's purpose, but for pizza standards, it wasn't all that.  Last case scenario, or be very very drunk!"}
{"text":"Easy quick snack for drunken late night. Good greasy pizza l, friendly staff only complaint not 24 hr closes at 12"}
{"text":"Both the bf and I were hungry upon arriving to the hotel after waiting in line to check in for I would say an hour!  We didn't really want anything too big as we were going out to dinner with friends later that night!  So, decided to try this place out! Reasonable price and big portion and flavor wise, it was good!  Can't beat it, convenient!"}
{"text":"Okay, first of all, I LOVE PIZZA.  I think pizza is the perfect food.  So, it shouldn't be too difficult for a pizzeria to get great marks from me.    My girlfriend and I came here for dinner after a night of partying.  I just woke up and was like....OOOH PIZZA!!   So we both ordered our own pizza (where one pizza could easily feed 2 or 3 people), so needless to say, we had leftovers, which was fine cause her man was passed out in the hotel room.  haha!  Anywhoo, i got the margerita pizza and added mushrooms to it.  It was scrumptious and hit the spot.  Although I didn't finish the pizza that night, it was done by the morning.  It easily became something for me to nosh on through the evening and in the morning!!"}
{"text":"Okay to start of I'm not a pizza fan. The pizza taste fine but for $4.50 per slice we're going overboard here. That's about $10 for pizza. And I know someone said that buffet is $14 for lunch? And I know they have pizza there. Well someone do the math here."}
{"text":"It's a solid choice for a slice if you're at the north end of the strip.  Thin, crispy crust, the veggies and onion are pre roasted and caramelized on the supreme, yum and about $6 per slice.  Cheaper for less toppings.  Also, fried wings for around $5.    Sustenance, greese, the basic necessities.  Your stomach will thank you afterwards.  Decent pizza, nicely priced for being on the strip."}
{"text":"Came here late at night after a show to take some food back to my room. We ended up just ordering a whole pie, but they have it by the slice. It seemed really chaotic in here, but the service was good and the pizza was pretty decent. No complaints at all."}
{"text":"Okay.  First off my disclaimer: I did not eat this right away.  We picked it up and ate it at our hotel in Paris (prob 20 minutes from picking up).  However, I am keeping this in mind when I do this review.  Medium supreme pizza:  $22.  dafuq?  Must be as good or better than pizza in New York.  Nope.  The crust was thin.  But because we didn't eat it fresh it wasn't crispy.  Even assuming it was crispy, here is the main problem.  They oversalt this pie like a mofo!  The tomato was good and it wasn't like oversauced... but Nothing really blew me away (except for the extra handful of salt they used).  $22.  That's too much for a medium pizza which as probably 12\" or maybe 14\".  Better than Pizza Hut?  Yes, but worth 3-4x the price?  Na."}
{"text":"horrible service.  period.  we were told by the cashier to order where the pizzas were sitting.  he then stood there and watched us as no one came to take our order.  he then goes and tries to find another person to take our orders.  he confused 9 customers in the process of all fo this.  below-par salty pizza garlic bread was ok, but the marinara that comes with it was like a red salt sauce.  don't come here even if you're desparate and on a time crunch since the wait time seems to be pretty variable for a grab-and-go style pizza place..."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have had in Vegas. Extra crispy thin NY style slices for 5 bucks so worth it! Will definitely be a regular. Veggie is great and so is the ham and pineapple. Only thing is that the guy taking your orders is totally busy and completely ignores people for a long time making people really confused as to where to order."}
{"text":"Rude cashier!! Unprofessional! Has a attitude when I asked him if we can add pepperoni to the pizza boy did he get crazy!!  He must hate his job poor little guy. Btw he was the foreign guy"}
