{"text":"I took my kids there for a no fuss Friday evening dinner. And no fuss is what I got. They were silent until every last flavorful bight of hamburger, chicken bacon sandwich, and hot dog were eaten. Skip the mediocre fries. The fried pickles is where its at. The mac and cheese side is out of this world homemade. And I can't say enough about the hot chocolate sundae with homemade brownie. Park Road Soda Shoppe is an affordable dining option for families."}
{"text":"Do not expect good service, especially when a regular customer walks in.   Regular customer that knew the waitress got drinks and ordered before we were greeted, even though we sat 7 minutes before them.  There was an older couple that was standing there like they were being ignored,  even though waitress were passing them by.     Now to the consumables. Shake WAS GOOD.  HAMBURGER WAS AWESOME!  Refills for tea and water never happened.   Waitress was too concerned of taking care of her child than serving the customer.  Other waitress had to pick up the slack,  but still never got Refills.   No one came by after food was delivered.   Needless to say, the tip reflected the service that was provided.   DROP in,  get your shake and go,  that way you are not expecting continuing service."}
{"text":"Great little 50's inspired diner. The difference between most themed places and this one is that Park Road Soda Shoppe actually has good food. The burger was excellent. It looked like a picture perfect menu item when it came out. The fries were freshly cooked with a little crunch, but not overdone. The staff kept up with what I needed, but did not stop by the table too much, which was nice because I was reading a book. Great place and great prices. Two orders of fries, a bacon cheeseburger and a cherry coke was $10.60."}
{"text":"I frequently visit this shopping center and was anxious to try this restaurant. I tried to get in a few times but it was too crowded so we went elsewhere.   Finally went last week on our way home from the mountains. First let me say, we were all hungry..2 adults and a couple of kids. Food usually tastes better when you are hungry. Spoiler alert...not this time. Second, we were happy to finally get a table at this popular spot. Now the bad news....  First the drinks...We ordered milkshakes and a root beer float. We excepted them to be delivered in cute old fashioned cups. Nope! We got styrofoam cups with lids. No whip cream and no cherry on top. Not cool. Immediately wished we had brought our business to Midnight Diner. Shakes were good but presentation was lacking.   Next the food. Our cheeseburgers were huge and bland. Think Cracker Barrel and you can imagine the burger. Next the chicken strips my kid got...bland and about the quality of a Denny's. The fries and onion rings were solid.   My advice is to go elsewhere for your burger fix. If you are in the mood for fries and a shake, stop in but be sure to make a special request if you want a cherry and whip cream! Three stars for friendly and fast service but it was hard to give any more for this lackluster food."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day after it was highly recommended from a coworker of mine. He used to come here all the time when he worked closer to the area. The burgers were recommended but I really wanted a hot dog that day. So I ordered a hot dog with pimento cheese and fried pickles.   Let me start with my fries pickles. The breeding to pickle ratio was perfect and the seasoning was yummy. The only thing was that they were extra greasy. But then again I ordered a fried item so greasiness means goodness. My hot dog on the other hand was disappointing... it tasted like they threw it in some boiling water to cook it and it was luke warm. I was thinking it was going to be cooked on a skillet or something, but it wasn't. So I would not recommend the hot dog at all. The people I was with said the burger was really good but they wished they had more because they left still feeling hungry. But you can get cheesy tots!! Didn't try them but sounds really good!!   Prices were reasonable. About $6-$8 dollar meal. This is in the park road shopping center so parking is always packed. Very few seats (but a cozy diner feel) so if you definitely want a seat don't come at peak times!"}
{"text":"*Dessert Review Only*  I came in just for a some ice cream after dinner. The menu is simple and nostalgic...burgers, hot dogs, fries and milk shakes and ice cream sundaes.   I ordered a hot fudge sundae. It really hit the spot. Not to mention it comes topped with whipped cream and a cherry. I left a happy girl!   The service was good and the prices were reasonable!"}
{"text":"Yes!  Fun little place to take the kids or the grandparents or both!  Hotdogs and fries were served piping hot, service was friendly and relatively inexpensive.  Will come back to try a burger!"}
{"text":"If you like your milkshakes served up with a heaping side of Jesus, this is your place.  Jesus signs and quotes everywhere.  I drank my chocolate milkshake and got the H out of there."}
{"text":"I met my boyfriend here for a lunch - one where he specifically wanted a milkshake.  Park Road Soda Shoppe is a small diner tucked away in a small shop in Park Road Shopping Center.  You seat yourself and look at the menus that are kept on the table.    When I went - it was actually quite happening at 2pm on a Friday.  I sat down and the waitress was right over.  I decided that I was going to get a float - but they didn't have Dr Pepper, so I settled for a Root Beer float.  For a soda shoppe, I expected a larger selection of sodas.    I didn't eat here, but perused the menu and it looked like your typical American cafe, well priced."}
{"text":"A nice throwback soda shop that resonates with the entire Park Road shopping center makeover.  Large counter area with swiveling stools decked out in vibrant reds and chrome add a perfect touch to this quaint location.  Their menu is pretty basic with the usual suspects,  and pricing is modest but not cheap (neither is their rent,  I'm sure).  I'm usually there when I pick my granddaughter up from school so it's chicken fingers and hot dogs.  Kids get a scoop of ice cream for only $.95 when ordering a meal.  Nice.  A couple of dings are for Styrofoam cups and plates along with plastic silverware.  Not a fan.  Give me the ol' mid-60's heavy stuff and I'm a happier person.  Secondly, for the price, I think they could try a little harder.   Of the entrees I've sampled, they seem frozen and reheated.   I would ratchet up the quality and raise my prices to merit the effort.  Why appeal to I-can-get-it-anywhere food while calling it family dining?  This area will pay for quality (it's Myers Park for heavens sake).  I'm also OK with the owners expressing their faith with a few discreet plaques.  Or not.  Who am I to judge?"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast after getting my car worked on and the guys in the shop recommending it. Simple, small interior, but warm hospitality, good food and fair prices. My omelette was huge!!! And delicious. The staff knew the \"regulars,\" which I always appreciate."}
{"text":"Today my son suggested trying the Park Road Soda Shoppe today as it is near his home. We had a wonderful meal and great service in a place that evokes memories of a soda shop from back in the day. My son and mother both had the Pimento Grilled Cheese on White Bread one with Crinkle Fries and one with Onion Rings. They both really enjoyed their meals. I had the Bologna Grilled Cheese on Rye with Onion Rings. It was fantastic! All 3 orders were cooked perfectly and neither the Fries nor Onion Rings were greasy. I will absolutely go again anytime. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I bring the wife here because from time to time she doesn't want to cook. Lately she's been pulling the \"I don't wanna cook, let's go to the soda shoppe\" card. I gotta fix that squeaky wheel, but that's another story for another day. Where was I....oh yeah the soda shoppe. So I'm reading the reviews...how in the blue h3ll are these idiots giving this place anything less than 4 stars. WTF. Some broad is complaining about a hot dog....if u don't like the hot dog order something else. But no...she had to get on Yelp to complain about a hot dog, kids are starving in Africa somewhere, but this chick is complaining about a $3 hot dog. Anyway. The wife likes the fried pickles, I enjoy the cheeseburger. This place also has the best Vanilla Coke of all times. The vegetables are awesome too. The okra cuts right thru me though. Nonetheless, this place is a definite must try....unlike these other over rated burger joints around here, I.e. Shake Shack (gross) SmackBurger (yuck) & McCatsNDogs. Hope u enjoyed this review."}
{"text":"I'm glad more people don't know about this place. But get the footlong hot dog all the way. Good Christian place. Family run and family friendly. Never had a bad experience. Fried okra and fried squash is great too. Good food and good people, simple enough."}
{"text":"Breakfast is inexpensive and awesome. Best value for the money! Very retro but newly remodeled. Highly recommend! Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"MIght be ok if you are a regular Got there about 11:30, was meeting someone later at the shopping center, was told I could sit at the table by the window or at the counter, sat at the table, it is very small.  Waitress came pretty quickly, ordered a hamburger, asked about the onion rings, she said they were good, got my tea.  Took a long time for the food, restaurant got crowded, and people seemed upset that I was sitting there, sorry they don't have more seating, finally got my food, it was alright, never got a refill or asked if I needed anything else, was thirsty, but no offers of refills, my bill was brought with the food, so if I was wanting something else I don't know how I would have gotten it.  Ate, waited for a few minutes to see if I could get more tea, no one checked on me at all, the food was ok, not spectacular or anything, paid at the counter the same person who had waited on me was at the register, never asked was everything ok, or do you need anything.  The regular customers seemed to be getting refills and being checked on.  I guess it is so small they don't need new customers....Picked this out of all the restaurants at this shopping center, maybe should have made another choice, it was too cold to sit outside and there were only two tables there."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have classic American diner food and it's perfect for a quick bite to eat. The staff it always very friendly."}
{"text":"$3 for a small bowl of chicken noodle soup  (from can and water down) yuck... Sandwich was simple.. with one piece of lettuce  and one piece of tomato.."}
{"text":"Great throw back spot.  The burgers are great as are the hot dogs and BBQ.  Also try the pimento.  Don't skip dessert.  Unreal ice cream and apple pie.   The breakfast is fantastic as well.  Great friendly staff.  Favorite place to eat by myself or with the wife and 3 kids."}
{"text":"The service was fantastic and the hot dog was very good. We appreciate the friendly staff, the swift food delivery and the refills!  We look forward to returning."}
{"text":"This place is very tiny and cute.  It definitely has an old soda shop feel....that black & white flooring..the soda shop bar...and booths. I came in one evening, only for dessert and there were a few customers around, but no wait.  The menu had an array of sandwiches, hotdogs, fries, and onion rings.  There are sundaes and milkshakes and various combinations of those items.  I chose the hot fudge sundae and really enjoyed it.  Plenty of hot fudge and whipped cream.  The service was good.  The waitress was fast and seemed to be an ideal multi-tasker.  I was pleased with my visit."}
{"text":"A Charlotte establishment my family and I love to go to. Really wish we didn't have to flag our server down, most visits, when we want more to drink or dessert, though."}
{"text":"Love, love, love!  The footlong hotdog might be the best classic hotdog I have had in Charlotte.  I got it with everything but chili.  The fries were solid, and I was able to have some room for an ice cream cone.  It feels like you are in an old school diner.  The only problem I had with the place is that it was created in 1999.  The way it looks and feels, my friend and I thought it might have been around since the 50s.  We were let down to know it opened 18 years ago.  But we will get over it, since the hotdogs are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Cute little shop but don't let looks fool you; this place is disappointing (to say the least) and waaay over priced. Hotdog was marginal at best, onion rings were literally dripping with grease (that old, disgusting need-to-be-changed-oil taste) and fast food places serve tastier ice cream. Two stars only because the place offers visual appeal. Will not be back."}
{"text":"I love this place, especially for families.  It's so easy to grab a booth, order some quick homemade sandwiches for lunch or dinner, and end with a yummy dessert.  The service is always warm, friendly, and welcoming.  The staff quickly makes you feel like family and more so if you come as often as we do.  I love that the original owners sold to their long-time, faithful employee, who has slightly updated the place while keeping all of the original charm intact.  We appreciate it and so does the neighborhood as the soda shoppe is always busy."}
{"text":"Best place to go for a simple hotdog or burger. An oldie but a goodie. The place to hit for a craving."}
{"text":"Park Road Soda Shoppe brought me back to when I was a kid in New York, at the old diner (on a much smaller scale). I recently was in the area and was looking for a hot dog, being National Hot Dog Day, and remembered this spot.  I arrived shortly before 12 and was greeted by a sweet server, so friendly. I looked over the menu and decided to go with the foot long, all the way, but on the side. Having never been I didn't know how their chili, Cole slaw was. So, until I I know I like to order on the side and add accordingly. The hot dog was good, but it was steamed and I prefer grilled. The chili however, on point. And, the crinkle fries were heaven. Fresh, steaming hot and salted just right. Park Road Soda Shoppe is a great place to enjoy an old school burger, hot dog, etc. and top the meal off with a milkshake."}
{"text":"Some may complain because there are a few Jesus quotes around but I personally as a more spiritual than religious person would rather see that than go to H. E. double hockey sticks signs everywhere. Additionally, they have such friendly service and AMAZING chicken salad sandwiches! Give this place a try and you will fall in love. One of my favorite restaurants in park road! Also, the remodel looks fantastic.    If you are there eating consider giving the fried squash a try!"}
