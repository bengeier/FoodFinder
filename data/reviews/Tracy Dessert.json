{"text":"One of the better Asian dessert places for when you're around the area. Good selection and their water is boiled with dried dates I believe which makes it interesting in a good way."}
{"text":"Tracy Dessert is a little caf√© that serves up Traditional Chinese desserts such as the typical red bean soup or mango pudding and popular spoon-able desserts that include fruits in them! (my favorite is the sea coconut ice with fresh fruits! very tasty and refreshing!). They also serve other dessert soup classics like sweet potato soup, green bean sweet porridge, water chestnut sweet porridge and an assortment of herbal teas. I remember once ordering the Herbal Jelly which is reported to be good for you but warning, it is VERY bitter! I love coming here, as it  has a variety of different, nutritious and healing desserts!"}
{"text":"Awww....heaven....  Got the following: - mixed fruits with grass jelly, superb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! - mixed fruits with mango pudding, pudding tastes a bit old, overall, good - mixed fruits with sago, coconut milk, YUM  Every time we visit Toronto, this place is a must to hit!"}
{"text":"Came here for dessert after a dinner at Inatei recently.   I ordered the herbal jelly while my friend had the stewed papaya with rock sugar. I found the herbal jelly to be pretty darn tasty. It helps (a lot) to cut the bitterness of it with the little cup of sugar they give to you but I really liked it. It helped to think that what I was eating was relatively healthy and good for you. I didn't get to try what my friend got but he liked it so take that however you will.  Very interesting selection of healthy desserts and soups along with fruit-centric desserts and a small selection of clay pot cooked food as well. The table next to us had ordered one and it smelled delicious. We were pretty intrigued by the idea of coming back here sometime just to try the food (especially considering it's 11-12 bucks for something that purportedly feeds two)."}
{"text":"We came on a Friday and the store said that they would open at 2pm however they did not open till 2:15pm  We get in and the waitress was rude. We sat ourselves. And when we went to order I went to order a Tofu dessert with fresh fruit and ice cream. However the lady informs me that they do not have tofu till 5pm at night.   So then I go to order a Sea coconut ice mix, and apparently they don't do mixed desserts before 5pm  Now someone tell me what is the point of opening at 2pm if nothing is available. It takes over 20mins for them to bring any food out.   The dessert is ok here but nothing special that I can't get somewhere else. I would suggest that they retrain the staff and maybe state on the menu that nothing is available before 5pm  Won't come back here again."}
{"text":"This is my new favourite chinese dessert place! I came here based on yelp reviews and it did not disappoint. We got a table for 4 pretty quickly for a Sat night judging from the previous yelp reviews. I had the steamed milk with papaya, and also had bites of my boyfriend's green tea shaved ice (super delish) and my friend's deep friend milk. Everything was very yummy and well priced.  I'm looking forward to coming back and trying the other things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Very bad customer service. The cashier girl had a very bad attitude, didn't want to answer question and always try to correct me when I placed order. The dessert especially the fruit drinks were terrible.  Not fresh and not fruity enough.  We order total of 50 something dollars of dessert and we were not satisfied at all. Will not come back again."}
{"text":"Great Asian desserts! Mango ice, black sesame soup, walnut soup. They have little bites too - only had the Hk style steamed rice roll with peanut & hot sauce which was very yummy.  It has your traditional wood Asian stools and tables. Small place, first come first served.   Come here every time I come back to Toronto!"}
{"text":"This place is not the chain like it was in Hong Kong but seems to be good enough for what is around the area.  I find it funny how the company's plaque they have is the same as the one in HK but looking at the menu, it definitely isn't.   Anyways, the chicken wings is pretty good.  Tried a tasting of their desserts option such as Mango and Shaved Snow, was pretty good."}
{"text":"Nothing special and unique about Tracy's Dessert. Typical desserts found in many Chinese dessert locations. Terrible customer service. We had to order our bill 4 times before it actually came and the waitress seemed to be ignoring us when we wanted to order. The calamari and shaved ice was decent, while the grass jelly tasted off."}
{"text":"Good food (steamed rice noodle roll especially). Good prices. Really bad service - waitress is always unfriendly and playing with her phone."}
{"text":"Not the first time coming here but tonight I Came by to get two large hot 24 herbs drink to go, and later discovered it was so diluted that I could see the bottom of the cup when the cup was still half full. Really disappointed with this. They charge $6.50 a cup, they should be ashamed of themselves."}
{"text":"Maybe I ordered the wrong things but I was thoroughly unimpressed by this place.  Tucked in a little corner in First Markham Place is this little Chinese dessert place.  They also have some snack items and rice bowls on the menu but I'd say the majority of the customers are here for desserts.   Upon being seating we were given some tea. I noted that the tables had dried \"swirl\" marks from being wiped down with dirty towels and were still sticky. Ick. The seating is not very comfortable - short Chinese-style stools. I guess they don't want you to be too comfy and stay too long.   I ordered the taro and tapioca sweet soup with coconut milk and it was ridiculously sweet and very watery. If I wanted sugar water with baby tapioca in it I could have gone somewhere and ordered a bubble tea! My friends ordered mango pudding (unimpressive, but at least they use fresh fruit) and the steamed milk and egg white custard. The milk & egg white custard was a bit watery as well. Be aware that if the menu states that something will take 20 mins to prepare, it really does so don't get annoyed at the waitresses.   There is are washrooms on site (which also double as their utility closet and staff locker rooms) and they accept cash only.  If I want Chinese dessert, I'll stick with Sugar in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Great place to go for late night dessert and to hang out with friends. They're apparently well known for their hk milk tea shaved ice with fruit which is what we ordered. It was amazing! We got one with watermelon, honeydew and mango which was an awesome combination! We were told to try their deep fried milk cubes which is being saved for next time. Overall a great \"hk dessert\" place atmosphere and will definitely come back after catching a movie on Tuesday."}
{"text":"Cramped with limited seating and right next to the swinging door exposing the occasional chill, I only hoped my new experience with my parents would be redeemed since the last memory I had at Tracy was \"enhanced\" and under the influence.  The green pea/seaweed and black sesame desserts were noticeably watered down. I've tasted quality chinese desserts so that really spoiled my expectations. I had the papaya nourishment drink, which they place a papaya in a bowl and they cut a small hole no bigger than the size of a loonie. It was the most difficult spoon and opening to drink out of. Like they hollowed the fruit and filled it with water... not as innovative as I thought. Sucks for me trying something new."}
{"text":"Great place for traditional Chinese dessert. They do have Taiwanese shaved iced desserts but the selection is not very big as well grass jelly and tapioca are not options. For the price for they charge for Taiwanese desserts, the portions are very small. And remember it's cash only. It's not mentioned anywhere and no signage on doors either."}
{"text":"Small quiet place to enjoy various types of traditional chinese snacks and desserts. I got to this restaurant at around 3 pm on a weekday and many of the tables were still empty. Only one person was working in the front. Perhaps they weren't expecting so many people to arrive all at once(I had around 10 people with me). We sat ourselves and after around 10 minutes, the woman behind the counter approached us with glasses of water. Another 10 minutes passed before she returned to take our order. It would be another 20-30 min before we got our food.   I ordered the Mango and pomelo with tapioca cream. The mango flavored liquid was not too sweet and tasted just right. The pieces of mango were also very fresh and ripe. I definitely enjoyed my little dessert. One of my friends had a scoop of vanilla ice cream in hers and she felt that it made the mango dessert taste even better.   Great place with yummy desserts. Wait time could have been shorter, but it was worth the wait!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem around highway 7. The restaurant is super small but the desserts there are good and something different from what you'll usually find in Toronto.  I got the avocado  shaved ice and it was perfect,  wasn't too sweet. I would go back here."}
{"text":"Must Try: Mango Sago with Pommels, Shaved Ice with Fruit, Steamed Egg, Black Sesame with Glutinous balls   ||  Rating: (8/10) Food, (8/10) Service, (8/10) Value, (8/10) Ambience, (8/10) Presentation, (9/10) Cleanliness  My Experience:    Great HK style dessert house, that shares the same name (but different franchise) with the famous Hong Kong spot known for their mango dishes.   Although they serve clay pot rice and other late night meals, I've always been a fan of desserts here. The shaved ice is a great blend with fresh fruit (really legitimately fresh!). Their steamed desserts are great as well, along with the traditional HK desserts, such as black sesame and almond.   If you're feeling for HK desserts, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"It really can't compare with the original one in HK : ( Perhaps I just had high expectations and was a little too excited to come here and eat Asian desserts because I haven't had grass jelly/coconut jelly in four years (having lived in Asia for seven years before that) but the coconut milk+red bean+ grass jelly drink really was mediocre at best. The coconut milk tasted like nothing and made the overall quality of my drink plummet bc it was supposed to sweeten the drink!! The ???was also too sour for my taste. ALSO, it would've been nice if it had coconut jelly in it like it does in HK!!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for HK style dessert. Most of the stuff here is pretty good. I had the mango pomelo sago and had some of the mango grass jelly. The mango was so sweet. The hot dessert soups are really good here too.  There is usually a line up on weekend evenings. The service is quick and efficient."}
{"text":"Pretty decent HK style dessert spot in Markham. There are so many and I have only tried Tracy's Dessert and it was enough to satisfy me with their mango pomelo. The mangoes in Canada are surprisingly sweet and juicy."}
{"text":"Good place to go when the other dessert places are busy.   Food: 4/5 Traditional Chinese dessert Service: 3/5 Efficient and leaves you alone. Environment: 3/5 Old with hard chairs. Washrooms: 2/5 Small. Worth it?: 3/5 Okay. Only go when invited.  Cash only.   Ended up going here because the dessert place we planned to go to was very busy. We seated ourselves and the server came with tea. They have a decent selection of desserts but nothing stands out. The sweet tofu pudding was sized pretty big. I had the steamed rice noodle roll ($5.25) which was okay.   Food seems to be assembled rather than thoughtfully prepared. The nice thing is the service doesn't bother you so you have time to chat and hang out. Down side if you have to ask for everything pretty much.   I would come back but only if invited by someone. Nothing stood out as there specialty so nothing really to bring me back."}
{"text":"If you like Hong Kong desserts, this is the place to be. Ordered the mango ice mix and it was great!!! Not too sweet (which is a plus), and not too filling. My girlfriend ordered the sea coconut ice mix with fresh fruit and sea coconut jelly. Not too bad, but love the sea coconut jelly."}
{"text":"Service was extremely slow and the food wasn't really my type. I couldn't even drink their bubble tea because it tasted out of the ordinary. The only thing that was decent was the steam rice noodle roll with oyster sauce and sesame sauce. I probably won't even come by here again"}
{"text":"I like this place, It is small and cozy and reminds me of Hong Kong. But that is about it.  Anyone that been to HK know the real Hui Lau Shan blows this place out the water.  The tables are Always Sticky for some reason - I been there around 10 times and it pisses me off.    To the dessert and food itself.  I love the Street-Style Rice Rolls as well as the mango pudding made with real mangos.  The double boil egg is good as well but you have to wait at least 15 mins for it. Another one of my fave is the Sago which was okay here. I also ordered the hotpot rice but you will have to wait at least 30 mins for it, so I suggest you order that first and take your time with your desserts.  I will def be back again shortly"}
{"text":"This place offers a great selection of desserts drinks and other items. Most mango desserts come with half a mango sliced up. Other desserts include traditional Chinese thick dessert soups ( walnut, black sesame, etc.).  Must tries is their steamed egg whites and milk, steamed egg dessert, deep fried milk custard, HK street style rice rolls.   Overall the food and service is ok but if it's just me but I had the bad luck of the draw. Upon getting our bill, me and my group of friends noticed a cockroach crawling on the wall behind my friends (pretty near the food preparation area).   I would rate this a 4 star place but have to take away the 2 stars due to the cockroach incident and the cleanliness of the restaurant."}
{"text":"I think this is a cool little hang out place for a bunch of friends. The actual desserts itself were very \"meh,\" but I think it's 'cause my standards are now ultra high after my previous visit to Hong Kong. I think if anyone were just suddenly craving a chinese style dessert, this place would be a decent destination. Only grief was that the tables seemed kind of dirty though =/  I think this is a place I would like to go back to, but not really frequent. Good in small doses! My goal on my next visit would be to try the savoury foods 'cause those look interesting =)  Overall, I think this place is a good hangout for teens or \"young adults.\" They have a cozy setting, fast service (but not nagging you to leave), and some pretty good music =) Generally a decent place, but just nothing extraordinary."}
{"text":"I really do love their chicken hot rice pot  and the fried custard milk, and some of the desserts. Should come here to grab some late dessert or a snack! They do get packed on weekend nights though!   oh... and every single time  I go the waitresses does not  look very happy and is somewhat rude.  I really wished they would be more polite otherwise i would give them a 4 star!"}
{"text":"First time here in a few years, and interesting to see that nothing has changed. 2 stars are pretty much for the desserts, as service was kinda crap...  Considering the rather expensive price for things, it was pretty good food. Took 20 min for a steamed egg custard, but well worth the wait. Very flavourful and smooth! Get almond paste soup was not too sweet, and had a good consistency. Milk tea shaved ice with fruit was definitely worth trying, as you don't see that flavour often. Not my cup of tea personally, but my family did enjoy that.   Service was such a let down. Water got to our table rather quickly, but took forever for us to order as people came in and paid for take out. Server didn't care at all, and didn't know her products when asked about the herbal benefits of a certain drink. We asked for extra spoons, and she walked away to grab her phone... At least get me my spoons first!"}
{"text":"This place is really delicious, it gets busy and packed on Friday and Saturday nights, a mix of young and middle aged groups visit it for late night desserts and snacks.  I usually come here also at night to catch up with a few friends, etc.  My friends and I usually order a few of their snack plates, deep fried milk, chicken cartilage, or the signature rice roll with sauce.  Of course you can't miss their desserts, I love their mango homemade grass jelly! I always crave it when I pass by, if you are willing to shell out a few dollars more try their fresh fruits mix with grass jelly, great mix of fruits including strawberries, kiwi, cantaloupe, lychee jelly, and grass jelly."}
{"text":"Service- Horrible. We sat there for 10 minutes literally trying to flag someone down because they were too busy on their phones.   Food- Dessert was alright, but like other reviewers have noted, a bit pricey for the portion you get. We ordered the black sesame, taro sago, fried milk custard and walnut dessert. Taro sago was definitely the best out of the four.  In conclusion, nothing special and I probably wouldn't come again."}
{"text":"A dessert establishment which focuses predominantly on traditional Chinese deserts; black sesame soup, grass jelly, you name it. But not to worry, the menue ranges into modern choices like shaved ice, fruit smoothies, and mango pudding. The milk tea shaved ice had a nice fragrant flavour that went well with the fruit (you get to choose three fresh fruits). It was shaved into nice thin layers and came in a sizeable portion with lots of fresh fruit! At the time, there was a promotion for 50% off fresh fruit juices. I was glad to see lots of fresh fruit being used in choices like watermelon, kiwi, and mango. If you're willing to look past the other flashy establishments near First Markham Place and go for a more humble establishment, this is the place to go for dessert!"}
{"text":"We came an hour before closing time, around 10:50pm. When we got there we looked at the menu but since none of is have had chinese desserts we needed a lot of time to think.  Around 11pm the guy comes over to take our order. I asked my friends if they were ready to order and they said no, so i told the waiter we needed one more minute. And then he looked at me really angrily and annoyed and said you need to hurry and then walked away. About 2 minutes later he comes back and one of my friends wasn't ready yet but we didn't want to be a nuisance and just order and she just randomly chose something. But then what she ordered was out so he just said \"its out\". So my friend had to randomly order another dessert cuz the guy just stood there waiting. He was very impatient and never had a smile on his face. The dessert itself was not bad, would give it 3.5-4 stars for taste and aesthetics. But we will never be back because the service was terrible."}
{"text":"Mango pudding, mango puree with fresh mango cubes, mango puree with fresh mango cubes and pomelo shreds, herbal jellies, sea coconut jelly --- YUM, refreshing Hong Kong style desserts.   I am guessing this is a branch of, or a licensed franchise of the famous Hong Kong chain of Hui Lau Shan. They use the same logo and the Chinese name.   The menu has some resemblance to the real deal HK Hui Lau Shan, but not as many mango dishes and the mangos aren't as fresh or ripe (no surprise, Toronto is waaay further from Philippines than HK is). But good enough a place for a HLS fix."}
{"text":"While it bears the same Chinese name ??? as the well known Hong Kong dessert chain, and sells some of the same items, it's clearly not part of the chain.    They do have a nice selection of traditional Cantonese style dessert, steaming hot sweet soup made with ground sesame, almond, taro, red bean, tapioca, etc. My favorite is the steamed milk custard, it's so smooth and tender, the chef totally mastered the art of making it (and which I cannot aspire to achieve at home).  More exotic choices include papaya, pear, snow fungus, hasma and other things double steamed with sugar and herbs for their health benefits.    For summer days they have cold dessert, mostly heavy with fruits, like mango pudding, mixed fruit with pudding, tapioca, jellies or shaved snow.  They don't necessarily have the best shaved snow in Toronto, but it's ok.   If you prefer something savory, they do offer a few snacks, such as fried chicken and fried calamari.  In the winter time, an order of clay pot rice really hit the spot. It is rice cooked in clay pot with various toppings on it, such as chicken, Chinese sausage and ribs.  Overall, not the best place to eat but the food is more than decent, and it has an extensive menu."}
{"text":"I would have never known! Judging by the name, I thought they only served desserts. To my surprise, they also specialize in \"rice pots\" stuffed with yumminess!!  Good to have foodie friends who know.   Came here to meet a group of friends late Saturday night around 10:45pm. I arrived late, and already they had finished one rice pot. We ordered 2 more of the rice pots and some side dishes. It was way too much food for 7 people! My favourite rice pot was the one with pork spare ribs.  Finally got to satisfy my craving for this rice pot dish. Typically, you'd have to wait about 25-30 hr for this dish, so I'm glad I was with company who didn't mind the wait.  The girls in the group each ordered the mango sago dessert. It was really yum!!!  So good, I ate it before remembering to take a picture of it....Next time."}
{"text":"Service is slow, the place is very busy.  Tables and chairs have a cute chinese culture decor but cleanliness isn't very top notch as me and a friend came in, was told to wait a few minutes for her to finally clear off the remaining table for us to sit. Service isn't prompt so if you need something, getting their attention and asking for it is a must. ie. napkins, water, tea, utensils etc.  Desserts were good with a wide variety of choices, we also ordered the chicken and rice meal since we were also hungry. It was mediocre but good enough to fill our tummy before dessert. The prices are not bad, I'd come again for desserts only though!   The only thing i did not like were the stools in the restaurant as dining chairs, my friend is big tall and big, so he needed two stools heh."}
{"text":"Came on a friday night after 9pm.  It was pretty packed and had to wait 15 mins for a table.  I had their sweet walnut soup and a fruit juice.  The flavor of the soup wasn't what I expected.  I've tasted better with a more fresh and organic walnut flavor elsewhere.  However, the portion was big.  They had too much water in the fruit juice.   Wouldn't come again."}
{"text":"4.5 stars for food 2 stars for service   Don't let the name fool you. Tracy dessert doesn't just serve up desserts. They have casserole pot rice for $20 and variety of snacks. My favorite is the street style cheung fun and the salt and pepper chicken knuckle.   It's best to come with 3-4 people, order one pot rice and a few side dishes. And when you are done and your butt doesn't hurt from the tiny little backless wooden chair you are sitting on, then you can order one of their many desserts. Put down $20 and you will be stuffed!!!!!!   Service is not the best. There is one lady (may be the owner) , she is extremely rude. When we ask her a question, she doesn't even answer us. When we asked again, she gave us a half ass answer with attitude.   Come early on weekends. The place gets full by 7pm. But turnover is fast. Nobody can really sit on those hard wooden chairs and deal with rude waitress for that long"}
{"text":"The only decent dessert option in this mall. I came with my husband and my friend, both grew up in Hong Kong.  It was a walk down memory lane for them.  Apparently they sell items they haven't seen for a really really long time.  Like the fried milk curds and this steam egg white- milk dish.  I though both were interesting and like the fact that they were not too sweet.  I'd come back for the milk curds.    Service was quite pleasant too. We came around 8 so a not early for dessert and didn't have to wait but by 9, all the tables were taken."}
{"text":"sick of waffles and crepes? well, i love coming here to get their mango coconut sago drink, hk street noodles, or any dessert under the \"fruit\" section of their menu. i can't say i've had any of their traditional chinese desserts but many guests seem to enjoy it. a couple of down sides to this place is that it is quite small so if you are going during peak hours, expect to wait. also, their seating isn't the greatest, but i guess it adds to the atmosphere and perhaps doesn't encourage people to stay too long? but they basically have stools and a couple of hooks on the walls for your coat. during the months when you don't need a coat it's not too bad of an issue but when you're there in your giant parka and have no where to put it other than on your lap and hugging it, it's not ideal. so i just basically avoid peak hours and all is good."}
{"text":"Had higher expectations of this place. I got the grass jelly with coconut milk and mango but the mango was sour and grass jelly tasted like store bought even though the menu stated it was homemade. Overall, below average and would not come back."}
{"text":"Tracy Dessert was a few steps away from Chef Wong's which is where my boyfriend, family, and I had dinner on our first night at Markham. My boyfriend, a few of our family members, and I have been here twice during our stay at Markham because it was that good!  The first time we did take-out so we can bring the desserts back to the hotel to enjoy. It took a little while for our orders to be ready, but it so worth it! I ordered the Homemade Grass Jelly, Milk, and Sea Coconut with Fresh Fruit and my boyfriend ordered the Mango Tapioca mixed.  I liked that they separated the fruits in a separate container and the grass jelly with milk in a separate container. The fruits were fresh and cut just right. I really liked my dessert and the grass jelly tasted 10x better than the one in New York and tastes a lot fresher! Too bad I couldn't finish the entire dessert cause it was so huge and filling. The mango tapioca mixed tasted pretty good and fresh as well!  During our second visit, we actually sat down and enjoyed the air conditioning and ambiance. It's a nice setting and great for afternoon or late night snacks, desserts, and tea.   I ordered the Homemade Grass Jelly with Mixed Fruits and ice cream and my boyfriend ordered the Mango tapioca with ice cream. The dessert I ordered the second time is similar to the one I ordered the night before, but much more fresher, bigger, and better. Once again, the grass jelly tasted really fresh and yummy.Absolutely fruit heaven! The Mango tapioca with ice cream was rich, syrupy, and sweet!  I really enjoyed the food at Tracy Dessert and the quality of the desserts tastes a lot better than the ones in New York to be honest. I look forward to coming back here again and try other desserts!"}
{"text":"What is up with First Markham Place stealing the names of well-established restaurants? First Din Tai Fung, now Hui Lau Shan?  Tracy Dessert should not even be allowed SAY the words \"Hui Lau Shan,\" because they are FAR from being the dessert wonderland that is the real Hui Lau Shan in Hong Kong.  We tried the Mango Pomelo Pudding, Black Sesame Tong Yuan, Green Bean Soup, Walnut Soup, Almond Soup, Black Sesame Soup, Tong Yuan in Ginger Soup, and Matcha Green Tea Shaved Ice.   You would think that out of all the things we tried, at least one would be great-- but all were subpar. The dessert soups tasted like they were made from a powder, and on top of that the Black Sesame Soup was burnt! No thanks! Someone get me back to Hong Kong!"}
{"text":"I have never been a huge fan of Chinese desserts, don't get me wrong I like egg tarts as much as the next guy but Chinese desserts in general are not sweet enough for my taste. However Tracy Dessert may have changed my mind about authentic Chinese desserts.   I went here with some yelpers after an elite event. This is a small place with a few tables, the menu is mostly in Chinese and the waitress' don't speak much English, lucky for us our fellow yelpers spoke the language and knew exactly what to order. A few of us decided to share a couple dishes. The real stars of the show on this evening were the green tea shaved ice and mango pudding. The shaved ice was very good, had a mild green tea flavour (without being overwhelming) and was served with some fruit and some sort of jelly. This dish was so refreshing and would definitely be great on a hot summer's day. The mango pudding was also quite good, had a natural mango flavour, a nice consistency and had some tapioca in it which gave it a good texture. This dish was also quite light and refreshing.    My least favourite dish was the black sesame soup, the flavour was ok but it had a weird consistency that put me off, furthermore this dish was not very sweet. I also managed to snag some glutinous rice balls which did not have much flavour but had an interesting texture; the peanuts these were garnished with saved the dish. This place also has some savoury dishes but we were here strictly for dessert.    Overall if you are a fan of Chinese dessert this place is quite good. The best part about Chinese desserts is that they are usually quite light and not too sweet so you won't necessarily feel guilty from indulging in some dessert. I will likely be back for some delicious shaved ice!"}
{"text":"Strong 3.5 stars.  This is a very standard HK style dessert shop. What impressed me the most was the large selection of items on the menu. Ordered the mango pudding, mango and pomelo x2, fish curry balls, beef curry, and balls, tapioca + coconut milk and taro. Call me a pig but 2 individuals devoured these items in record time!   Wait time was longer than expected but the nom definitely made up for it. Standout items? It's a tie between the mango/pomelo and tapioca. I can seriously have eat those everyday for the rest of my life."}
{"text":"This place is a classic. It may not blow your mind with amazing new creations but the classic chinese deserts that you are used to back in asia, it does correctly. This place has been around for a very long time, and one of its key to its success, has always been that this desert restaurant has great food, and a simple pedigree.   i've been to this place a few times in the past, but its been a while since I've come here. and i have to say that it is overall a very decent desert place. i would highly recommend mango based deserts, as they do a decent job, and also the classics such as black sesame or grass jelly based desert. It is a great place to go with a few friends like 4-6, as thought this place is not very big, you can easily get a spot, and relax, the interior is very much old school Chinese interior. and those in the neighborhood have probably heard of this place.   I would recommend it to anyone in the area looking for some classics. and it is pretty good considered this is located in an area where there is tons of desert places. it still stacks up pretty well"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and the food here is very good.  The place is not the cleanest but is every Chinese restaurant going to be clean? The service is not bad consider young girl that are not experience. This is a desert place not to fancy restaurant."}
{"text":"One of the few surviving old school Chinese dessert houses in Markham. It's a a great alternative to the \"let's go out tonight? Where should we go? Bubbletea? Ugh. Again? Okay fine.\" They offer healthier options, such as desserts with the words \"herbal\" in them (what.) and steamed papaya with milk. (Is it wierd that I am really excited to try this?)  What we ordered:  - deep fried milk custards: you can't help but order these things when you see the waitress dole them out. The best way I can describe them would be little white plump balls of \"OMG. So fluffy I'm gonna die!\" covered a light golden deep fried batter. Definitely an unique dessert item worth sharing amongst friends. I say sharing, because they're so cute that I almost feel bad for eating too many of them - purple potato with dumplings in ginger soup: Not too bad, but can be easily made at home with frozen dumplings  Would definitely come back again to try out more things on the menu."}
{"text":"Take a trip to Hong Kong without leaving the strip mall in Markham.  The lacquer tables and tiny stools with carved Asian motifs were fun. The laminated menu on the table top was eye-popping for even this veteran Asian food connoisseur. The first item I saw was frog ovaries. This is considered a medicinal dessert so my guide who's from Hong Kong informed us. I politely passed on that one.   For those less intrepid stick with S.S's suggestion of the mango pudding which was so refreshing. They also have great ice cream with red bean and the watermelon ice was a really neat nod to shaved ice with fresh fruit. If you're feeling adventurous my guide informed us that the black sesame soup was delish."}
{"text":"I think this HK style dessert shop does desserts right! they have been around for a pretty long time, especially since other shops beside them on the same strip, has been switching owners a lot.  I think they do a good job with the clay pot rices, the rice is nice and soft and there is a good amount of toppings. (It's a 30 min wait, but it's worth it) I've tried all the different flavors already, and there isn't one I did not like.  The desserts are delicious, I have been here many many times and tried almost everything, I especially like the shaved ice, the fried milk, and any tofu fa, grass jelly or sago dessert which has LOTS of fruits. and the herbal jelly is authentic.  I like the hot foods also, the portions are good and it's flavorful. Like the street style rice rolls, and tea eggs,"}
{"text":"I have been here for dessert from time to time but it wasn't until a friend told me to order their Pigeon on Rice in Ceramic Hotpot that I found it actually was good for food as well as their Mango or Tapioca desserts.  I was there before my friend as I drove pass him while he was stuck behind someone driving slower.  When I got there he called me to order the Ceramic Hotpot item right away as it takes anywhere up to 20-30 minutes to be ready.  The three of us shared a good meal and the price was very reasonable as well.  Too BAD there were 3 of us!  I might not be able to finish it on my own but I would be happy to make that attempt.  There's always NEXT TIME.  Usually I like to order some snacks at these Chinese dessert places such as Street-Style Rice Rolls (Cheong Fun) with hot sauce/sesame paste/hoisin sauce or Fried Fresh Milk (Direct translation).  Obviously if you're not that into having Pigeon, than other choices are available.  You can take me there so I can take the pigeon and you can the rice, WIN-WIN situation.   :-)"}
{"text":"My most favourite place ever for Chinese desserts! Not only are the prices SUPER reasonable, but the food is DELICIOUS! The staff and service is excellent too! And their tea is really good. I particularly love the design of the store. It is very traditional and not too modern; it reminds us of the Chinese culture and history. It's a perfect place to hang out with family and friends.  The black sesame soup, steamed egg, fried milk, steamed noodle rolls, rice pots, are only a few of my beloved dishes here.   I will no doubt be returning! :)"}
{"text":"Tracy dessert had a big name in Hong Kong and the one in First Markham place has been here for many years now!   Came in for some Chinese dessert, and I must say their selection has increased tremendously over the years. I might as well add that the price has also increased tremendously as well. The waitress gave us tea, which I could taste had red date in it. Fancy!  A simple taro with coconut with tapioca pearls was like $5.25 or something. Basically all the desserts were more than $5. That's crazy! I can literally just make this dessert at home and for a bowl, it would probably cost like $0.50. A few years ago, I think I can still get it for like $3-$4, which is more reasonable, but wow, more than $5 is a little over the top for this dessert. Though I must say, it is Tracy Dessert, and they are a little more on the expensive side.   I also saw other items on the menu like fish balls, chicken wings, shaved ice. My friend got a mango drink with fresh mango in it!   I'm also surprised how many people come to Tracy Dessert after work. We came on a Sunday and the tables were always filled. I think the amount of tables they had were just perfect because no one really waited for seats for a long time, but the tables kept filling up once a table was finished."}
{"text":"This place has awful service. My family and I were extremely disappointed. The food was decent but will not go back as the girl that served us was super rude and impolite. She was impatient and basically threw our dishes across our table.  I'd give them 2 stars for the quality of their food but none for service."}
{"text":"Desserts are pretty expensive, but there's a huge selection and you'll be able to find things here that you'll have a hard time finding elsewhere. They also do snacks which is super neat because rice rolls and dessert?! Late night?! WILD.  The desserts are also made fresh to order and they serve you a herbal tea instead of water/your average tea! I think it has red dates/longan in it? It might not be for everyone but I really enjoyed it!   I had the Herbal Jelly which comes with a simple syrup (it's kind of like Wong Lo Kat if you've ever had it before, with a bitter after taste) and a Grass Jelly w/ milk and mango. The Herbal Jelly was really good but it does taste very herbal and much more bitter than grass jelly.   Grass jelly was on point, especially with the milk. Tastes a lot better than what you're getting at bubble tea shops and it instantly reminded me of China, LOL. Cannot go wrong with grass jelly! Desserts are overall expensive for what it is and it won't necessarily blow your mind, but it's pretty good in general.  They don't serve any tofu desserts until after 7 p.m. which is a bummer because I literally came just for that, BUT I will be back again because it must be good and I love rice rolls with asian desserts especially at night!!!"}
{"text":"Just went there about two hours ago. Lots of choices but the food is really just fruit and cream (which, why would you mix those two together) and lots of late night eating. I guess it's a thing people do, but not my kind of food.  I got #32, the jelly with red bean and coconut milk- cold. I didn't taste any coconut milk, very watered down and the chunks of jelly were inconsistent and way too big for that tiny spoon in the cup. I guess this quality is standard for this kind of food, but i'm not impressed. oh yes, and they forgot my order. I was waiting 15-20mins, before i had to follow up on the order. The waitress didn't seem too bothered or bubbly.  I really wanted to not tip at all because i was disappointed, but since the bill was not split, and my friends wanted to tip 15%, i paid $8 for that drink which i absolutely did not find it worth it. overall, not impressed with service or quality, and personally, i'm not coming back."}
{"text":"We have to wait for 30 minutes to get a table it was 11:00 pm, I guess people in Markham likes to go out late for dessert. We ordered three desserts, they are all really tasty. I think there is only one in Toronto area, the store is really small hence the wait time. If I go back to Markham, I will visit it again."}
{"text":"I can understand the difference in reviews on yelp cause to be honest there's definitely an inconsistency in service and food here. At times it is the best place to be and others it is just not even close. I usually order the hot pot rice which is pretty amazing but there was one or two days that the chicken was just not as fresh as I remembered and depending on what you order the desert can be lacklustre. My favourite is the pomelo fruit with mango sago, it is just Heaven!  Can't understand why there's such a huge difference some days but I definitely will come back and hope that the kitchen is having a good day."}
{"text":"Nothing particularly special about Tracy Dessert. I found their dessert average and what you would expect at any Chinese dessert shop in the Markham/Richmond Hill area. I do, however, find that their portions are a bit smaller for the price that they are charging. This place isn't on the expensive side, but isn't on the cheap side either. You'll be looking at spending $6 - $7 per dessert, which typically isn't big enough to share effectively.   Food (3/5):  Nothing special. I think you would be able to find a better Chinese dessert place for the price, but I wouldn't mind going back if there isn't anything else opened around the area. To be fair, I have only had their mixed fruit sago and mixed fruit mango pudding, so I cannot speak for the entire menu. I did notice that their drinks were priced at a rather high price ($5 for a small red bean ice, $6 - $7 for a large one). It was a bit unusual, and I never got around to trying it.   Service (4.5/5):  The service was great. When we went in, there was only a table near the door, and you would feel a breeze every time someone were to open the door. Although we sat down since this was the only open table left, the waiter asked if we would like to move after a table had just become available. The waiter was also quick to do her tasks, and never needed us to ask twice. This was during one of the busier times at night.   Types of Payments (2.5/5):  You'll only be able to pay cash here, which not a lot of people carry around anymore. You have been warned.  ------  Overall (3/5)"}
{"text":"I do enjoy coming here every so often for my traditional Chinese desserts - you have your tofu pudding, fresh fruits with sago, assorted herbal drinks, tea eggs, turtle shell?!  This Tracy desserts has been here for as long as I can remember. Seating is plentiful and the waitresses accommodated our large group by pushing two tables together. They have the traditional wooden tables and chairs (ya, the ones that make your ass hurt if you sit too long). There are hooks on the wall for your coats.  We ordered the stall-style rice noodles which come with peanut, hoisin, and sriraicha sauces for dipping - one of my absolute faves! It can easily feed 5 people. Also ordered by my group were the mango sagos, fresh fruit drinks (honeydew, watermelon), tofu puddings and grass jellies, along with a steamed milk which took 15 minutes but came in about ten. If you like fresh fruit, I'd recommend the Grass Jelly with assorted fruits (b jai lerng fun)  They are cash only and wifi is somewhat spotty. Their complimentary drink is hot tea with red dates (jujube)- for those who don't know, it's supposed to nourish you and replenish blood   Cash only."}
{"text":"None of us could even finish our desserts, they were so awful. Maybe we should have gotten the mango pomelo tapioca seeing the other reviews...but I'm never going back. I was hesitant at first because I am not a fan of the ??? in NYC. But since the menu was different, I thought I could give it a try. Ugh much regret  If you do come here, don't get the black sesame or walnut dessert soups. They tasted so sweet and artificial I actually spit out my first spoonful.   I guess I'll rate it more of a 1.5 because my sister really liked #59, even though I thought the tofu tasted off.   Cash only!"}
{"text":"Nice small dessert place at First Markham Place. They have a decent selection of desserts here and very traditional Chinese desserts. We ordered the Fried Milk and Mango Sago with Pommel. Both were good choices of desserts. The prices were reasonable with desserts costing between $4-$8. Service is good and it's a nice cozy atmosphere inside so it does get busy during the evenings at a busy mall such as FMP."}
{"text":"This Chinese dessert place always brings back old memories! It's been around for many years and it's still very popular in the area. They make really good black sesame soup - not too sweet and rich with flavour. The fried milk is also delish - not too oily or heavy.   They have a pretty comprehensive list of all the Hk dessert favourites as well as savory items such as the street style rice rolls and claypot rice. Good spot for some late night snacking."}
{"text":"Tracy dessert has hands down one of the best clay pot rice in the GTA. Their portions are huge (enough to serve 3) for the modest price of $15. Their rice is extremely crispy at the bottom and well flavored with toppings.   They also have a huge selection of traditional Chinese desserts and their mango desserts are the BOMB. They do sweeten their watermelon juices so make sure you request no sugar if you don't your fruit juices sweetened."}
{"text":"First thing first, this restaurant is an imposter. It's not the same as the big chain in Hong Kong with the same Chinese name.  Similar menu, but the quality is not even close.  Service is simply terrible, if there's any service at all. It was a typical busy Sunday morning. Not overwhelmingly busy. The girl at the front just didn't feel like to answer your questions when you ask her. You can clearly tell she thinks you're stupid asking questions and she is very annoyed. The way she talks back to us just make us feel like she just wanted us out of there.   We order some hot food along with some dessert and smoothies to go. It would take them 15 minutes to get the hot food ready. So we would like to get our smoothies first. Makes sense.  However, she insist we need to get all the food, hot and frozen, all together at once because she said it is \"one order\".  It would've taken them less than 5 minutes to make 2 identical smoothies. It feels like she was doing it deliberately because we asked too many questions. And they didn't wait until the hot food was ready or almost ready to make our drinks. That means, by the time all the food was ready after 15 minutes, our smoothies were already melted half way.   The hot food and dessert didn't impress us.  It was ok at best. The mango smoothie was just terrible. It was already melted half way when we got them. And totally melted to a liquid after another 10 minutes on that hot day. It also taste like rotten mango especially once the ice melted. So bad we just threw them away. I just had a mango smoothie a day earlier in another place and it tasted very fresh. Not like this.   The service fails me big time. The food is not good. Why go back?"}
{"text":"Curry fish ball and meat ball taste good. Great for late night desert, tons of parking. If you are kind of full and just want something to chew, this is a good place. Service is okay, not the fastest, that's why it's good to chat with your friends and have a nice talk."}
{"text":"A busy dessert place, but service is always quick! This small dessert place gets packed most of the time, so be prepared to wait. As I am from the west end, I come here every so often to satisfy my Chinese dessert craving. I ordered the walnut \"sweet soup\" with sesame filled dumplings and my friend ordered the steamed egg white milk with papaya. We also shared this popular HK snack- steamed rice noodles with soya sauce, hoisin and peanut sauce. The items came out pretty quickly. I did not like my sweet soup as the flavours were not there, and I felt like it watered down. The sesame dumpling was a little hard as the skin was super thick and the filling wasn't runny. Our snack was pretty satisfying, you can never go wrong with this one! My friend finished the steamed milk dessert pretty quickly although I was a little surprised that the milk/egg was not steamed inside of a papaya- especially for the price of this particular dessert. Although my dessert was disappointing, I still enjoy this place as it reminds me of Hong Kong and it is really a convenient spot. Next time I'll stick with the fresh fruit desserts:)"}
{"text":"I ordered the mango sago and was kind of disappointed with the portion and the price ($6 in all including tips for a tiny bowl)! It wasn't satisfying enough but it was really delicious. But I think I'd go somewhere a little cheaper.  The other items on the menu seemed a little pricey imo. I even saw two girls walk in, sit and look at the menu and walked right out!   I guess they only thing worth coming for may be the really traditional deserts like the herbal ones. The desserts are definitely better tasting than other places though"}
{"text":"Thank you JC for introducing this place to me!  This is a traditional place serving up some traditional Chinese and Hong Kong inspired desserts.  if the food doesn't feel traditional enough, the decor makes up for it; wood carved stools, traditional pictures and choice of colors this place displays.  For dessertS....yes that's more than one, we both decided to order the following items:  **Deep fried milk (3/5): Served warm, with sugar sprinkled ontop, I found this unique since it was my first time. Not too oily.  **Mango with pomelo and tapioca (4.5/5); this was an enjoyable one, served cold, with an ambundance of sweetness, the pomelo adds a nice a twist to the dish complimenting the tapioca and sweet mango....i'd recommend one....two=too much sugar.  **Sesame ball soup (4/5); first time having this, one bite and you'll taste the sweet black bean, great soup dish that smells 'comfort food'  **Steamed rice noodle mixed with hoisin and soya sauce (5/5)  Supposedly they used to serve this dish with hot sauce mixed in, but they excluded it.  The dish is served with mixed hoisin and soya sauce, truly comforting with every bite into this soft rice noodles.  The sauce makes up for this as rice noodles is bland.  Overally Great place, I'll be sure to visit again."}
{"text":"I have heard many things of this place and it definitely did not live up to its hype.  Ordered the hot grass jelly and black sesame dessert. The jelly was delicious, but this quality can be found at other locations (ie. Sugar marmalade)  - tea is lacking in flavor   Food was not savory. The black sesame was way too Thin. Considering staples of Chinese desserts was not up to par, I would not recommend"}
{"text":"Really nice HK style dessert place! We had the mango pomelo with tapioca cream, black sesame soup and deep fried milk. We started with the two first desserts and finished with the fried milk. The black sesame soup came really fast and it was hot. My boyfriend loved it! It was full of flavours. Even next to him, I could smell the sesame! You should definitely try it! As for the mango dessert, I liked it! I used to see it often in HK series and was always curious about it. Now that I know how it tastes like, I can die in peace LOL. But it didn't wow me. I expected so much more. However, it's still a nice mango tapioca cream! I would take it again next time. And add a mango pudding!  The deep fried milk disappointed me at the end. It was just so-so. It has sugar sprinkled on top and it tastes a little like the Chinese donut until you bite into the milk part. It wasn't too sweet so that's a plus! I wouldn't take it again"}
{"text":"This dessert shop has been around for a long time. It is a solid place for Chinese desserts. They have a wide range of snacks and desserts. It is a great place to get desserts with your friends. They use furniture that is very traditional and it matches the shop very well.  The item I usually get is the boiled egg dessert with added ginger. This is one of my favorite Chinese desserts. They make it quite nice here. The texture is smooth and it comes out really hot. At other Chinese dessert shops, I feel like the texture is a hit or miss. But at Tracy Dessert, they make this hot dessert really well. It's a great dessert especially in the winter, but I enjoy it both in the winter and in the summer. Other items I like are the sago items.   Service is fast and adequate.   I recommend visiting if you want Chinese desserts in this area."}
{"text":"The pictures looked great and promising so I tried out this place.   Wasn't really good at all... Got the pomelo mango sago thing, can say that you could get this anywhere else and it'd be better than this place. Mango was sour, the sago was kinda hard, and it was kinda warm... So yeah.   Verdict: can try this place if you don't believe me but I think that any other dessert place will probably be better than here, plus it's pretty expensive too.  So, nah.   That's all."}
{"text":"This was just one of the many places we went to for dessert during our time in Toronto. And just another place in which I had cold herbal jelly in Toronto. I think I've ordered that at every dessert place we went to there and I'm serious haha. A good herbal jelly should taste bitter but not too overprocessed, like Jello. The honey or syrup you pour into it should be sweet enough to counteract the bitterness. The herbal jelly here was pretty good. Either that or I've had so much in the days before that my tastebuds can't tell the difference anymore. Nevertheless, it tastes better than any of the stuff back home (well, actually, I've never really come across herbal jelly when I am home; then again, I wasn't really looking). I know it definitely tastes better than the crap you can buy in little plastic cups at the supermarket though.  Oh yeah, the thing that got me super excited here was the fact that they have deep fried spicy salty chicken knee. I became obsessed in trying to find a place that serves this here so I can taste what this was all about after a friend asked if I had tried this in HK while I was there and I hadn't so I became super disappointed. And now, I FINALLY get to try it. Yayyyyy! And I wasn't super disappointed with how it tastes either. It was good. Basically, you know the part of the chicken bone that is white and around the joint area? If you eat chicken like I do and finish off every single bit and piece that you are able to chew on, like this white soft bony part, then you know exactly what I am talking about. Well, pretty much, they take this piece off separately and coat with the same breading they use for spicy salty calamari (I KNOW you've had that) and voila! You get spicy, salty chicken knee (or soft bone). And it tastes delicious! Mmm nom nom nom!  Only minus about this place is that we went after dinner, at night, so it was packed and we had to wait for a table. And there wasn't that many inside to begin with. How dare they make me wait to satisfy my craving for spicy salty chicken knee! Minus 1-star for that!"}
{"text":"This place have been opened for so long inside First Markham Place and one I visit once in awhile. It's a very small place which doesn't fit a lot of people, if you want to grab a seat on weekends, better come early or else either you wait for a long time for a table or you have to take-out.  They offer a lot of traditional Chinese desserts, most of which on their menu you can customize, like adding on toppings, fruits, onto your choice of dessert. They also offer desserts which are not only the pleasure to the taste buds but as well considered healthy for the body. They also offer healthy herbal drinks  and snacks as well.   This is a great place to go if you're looking for something sweet, a snack, a place to catch up and talk, a dessert place after dinner.  On the down side, I would think that the prices are TOTALLY NOT SO WORTH it. For a bowl of simple sesame dessert or mango sago dessert, it's at least $6 and it's a small bowl where you can finish in few bits.   The quality of the food is decent but for the price of what you're paying, NOT SO WORTH it.  Did I mention service is poor, during times where they are not busy, like afternoons, there's only 1 employee working, serving customers, punching in orders, doing take out orders, as cashier. And during busier times, servers are just running with endless tasks in limited time.  I wouldn't come to this place unless I'm close to the plaza and craving for Chinese desserts, but there's also other choices around."}
{"text":"My calling Pension Babe's dessert mushroom soup \"offensive\" did not seem to scare her off from trying another HK style dessert cafe with me.   Pension Babe: How are you for deep fried milk?  Me: In my culture we have a saying \"if it's not fried it's not good\".   Oh man. After sharing a 40 piece sushi platter at Osaka Sushi, Pension Babe still seemed pretty hungry. I let her order at these kinds of places. \"Surprise me.\" She ordered 5 dessert items. Where do these women put it? Seriously.   Verdicts:  Deep fried milk: One of the best things I've had since Krispie Kreme. A nice sugary batter, sweet solid milk cubes. Add more sugar to taste.   Some shaved ice dessert: At first I thought this was a Chinese interpretation of Korean patbingsoo but then I noticed the ice seemed more like a shaved milk ice. Watermelon balls were nice. The milky ice was nice. I think I still like patbingsoo better. No red beans. Yeah. I can't believe I'm saying that. \"A cold dessert with out red bean goop? Why even bother?\"  Mango tapioca pudding: You can't really go wrong with mango anything. Unless you're letting me slice open an actual mango. I get frustrated when holding a knife. Very frustrated. There's a poor outcome, usually.   Mango Egg Something: \"What's this called?\" \"You know we don't really have a lot of different names for these things.\" Huh. Sweet baked egg whites with mango hunks? Different. Good.   Rolled Rice Cakes Something: \"This was my favorite breakfast in Hong Kong. I would buy it from a stand on the way to the subway.\" It bore visual similarity to Korean ddeokbokki but a sweet sesame brown sauce as opposed to a sweet/spicy red sauce. Warm, sweet, nourishing carbs. I can see how this is a morning comfort food.  Seating: Ouch. No conducive to long philosophical chats. Low squat stools. (Erm. I'll leave that one alone.)   Service: Great!  Pro tips: This place fills up quickly on weekends. Before 9 pm forgetaboutit."}
{"text":"The dessert was good but the service was not so great. They only came to take your order, give your food and that's it. They don't come by after to give you tea or any other sort of service. I don't think the service here is that great and I don't think its worth tipping if you go here. The service is so bare minimum and mediocre. I would not come back here again due to the not so good service. The servers don't care about the guests coming in or out."}
{"text":"I'm from HK and always have craving for food at home.  This shop is known for dessert but this time I'm here for some solid food.  Must try the deep fried squid, best I've tried in GTA but on the salty side.  Steamed rice roll with all sauce is awesome and brings back memory.  The highlight was the steamed flos cordyorps & pork tenderloin with rice in hot pot.  30 mins wait but totally worth it, best on a cold day!"}
{"text":"It's a nice after dinner location to grab some Chinese desserts. Seating is limited and will get pretty crowded at night. Service can be a bit slow- however, once you order the food comes out as per their ready (ie. tofu flower will come out before the baked desserts).  I still really enjoy coming here because of the location - very accessible.   Note: Cash only"}
{"text":"This was one of the few places we could find to get some dessert late at night.  It's not the best service in the world, they were very nice but not very attentive.  The dessert was good bang for the buck.  The Iced Red Bean Milk w/ Ice cream was bad, wasn't sweet at all Iced Grass Jelly Milk was good Mango MIlk Shake was really good :) Original Milk Flavored Snowflake Ice (HK Style) was pretty good as was the Milk Flavored Snowflake Ice (HK Style)"}
{"text":"This is very traditional dessert place located in FMP. As you walk in, u will get the feel that you are somewhere in China for dessert due to their furnitures(table, seats, wall decor and so on) nothing fancy but if ur craving for Chinese dessert then this would be one of the many places.   Chinese dessert aren't cheap, don't come here if you don't have CASH, otherwise ur pretty much screwed.   I ordered myself a mango pudding while some of my friend order other desserts so I'll just review mine only and give you a peak of the other desserts.  The mangy pudding have lots of pieces of mango inside the pudding and on top of the mango pudding. They add a layer of evaporated milk the make it smoother. Overall, I enjoyed it, the price was between 4-7$ which I don't remember exact, portion was acceptable.... I guess prices will increased due to wage increasing lol... Be ready for overpriced dessert or smaller portion in the future.   I prefer western dessert over Chinese dessert in general, there's not much newness, however they did well on the presentation wise.   My recommendation is, if you really really craving for steam egg. Fry custard, sesame/almond paste or any of those traditional Chinese dessert then sure go for it, otherwise, I would say there's better options out there, specially in that same plaza."}
{"text":"No idea why this place has such low reviews. This is one of the main dessert places we go to everytime we go to Toronto! The service here are sometimes abysmal, but the desserts and food more than make up for it. I highly recommed the Glutinous Rice Balls topped with Peanut and Sugar and Rice Cake with Oyster Sauce and Peanut Butter. There's also plenty of parking, so no worries about that!"}
{"text":"Not sure if this is the same ??? dessert chain from China, but this place also serves traditional Chinese desserts along some some more modern, fruity items. They also have casserole hot pot rice available, but you'd have to wait 20 minutes.  I ordered the milk tea flavored shaved ice, which came with 3 toppings of my choice, so I picked mango, strawberries, and red beans. The food kinda took a while to arrive, roughly 15 minutes, and to be honest, it wasn't quite worth the wait. The shaved ice wasn't too flavourful, could barely taste the bubble tea flavour, and it was just too crunchy. The texture would be so much better if it was creamier. The toppings were alright, I think both the mango and strawberries were fresh (not canned/from frozen) but the red beans were a little under-cooked.  I quite like their tea which was brew with dates, which made it slightly sweet.  I may come back again to try their traditional Chinese desserts, but for desserts with more of a modern take, the Sugar Marmalade next door is a better choice.  Btw it's cash only."}
{"text":"Tracy dessert has a variety of staple desserts with an emphasis on mangoes and pomelo -a delicious combination in itself. The mango sago pudding is thick and fresh and the herbal jelly was so flavourful. The only thing that'll bar me from going back is that I found the desserts to be a bit too sweet, especially the syrups that're paired with the jelly or sesame dumplings"}
{"text":"We came as a group for a late night desert.  We are lucky to get the seat of 10 since the place is very small.  Just because the place is small, it doesn't mean the desert is not good.  In fact their desert is very good.  We ordered a mango coconut jelly desert,  hk style traditional rice cake roll, hot pot rice and water melon drinks.  I have to say they have the best mango in town.  A lot of other desert place use mango powder, however Tracey Desert use real mango.  We saw lots of them on the rack and ready to be use for desert.  The hk style rice cake roll is also good with the soya sauce , sweet sauce and hot sauce.  This is my go to place for hk style rice cake roll.  I tried a few other places and they are no match to Tracey Desert.  The hot pot rice was ordered from my friends.  Although I didn't eat any, but they fully recommended it.  The price is very reasonable but make sure to come early otherwise be prepared to line up to get a seat."}
{"text":"It was a hot day so I wanted some cold dessert. When we stepped inside all we can feel is the humidity. The AC was down but we decided to stay even with the extreme heat.   Mango and pomels with tapioca cream $4.65 - it was a light dessert and mangos were pretty fresh but not very sweet. I also thought it could have used more mangos. I liked that there was grapefruit to change the taste and texture a bit.  Taro and tapioca $5.95 - not much taro but tasted good  Sesame paste rice dumplings $4.15 - I thought it was the dry kinds where crushed peanuts and sugar are sprinkled on top but it was the ones served in sweet soup. The dumplings themselves were super small but tasted good.  Everything tasted good and service was good but when compared to others like Health Herb Harmony its not even close."}
{"text":"First time having Hot Pot Rice there, and is excellent.  Shave ice is delicious and deep fried chicken wing is very good as well.  Will definitely come here again for dinner."}
{"text":"I wish they had something here in Vancouver!  The dessert is just amazing!  I was over in Toronto to do some sight seeing plus visit some family.  A friend of a friend of mine recommended a dessert place that is similar to Pearl Castle.  He took us over to Markam and my friend and I didn't know what to expect.  We went in and the decor is just like an old fashion Chinese restaurant with all the Chinese furniture.  They are famous for their mango pudding so everyone ordered a mango pudding except for me because I am allergic to mangoes. I ordered a dessert with fruit and grass jelly.  My friend said she loved the mango pudding.  It had the perfect amount of sweetness and it wasn't sour at all.   My grass jelly dessert was very good.  I would go back and order orther desserts off the menu!  I can't wait to go back for another visit!"}
{"text":"The squid balls were AMAZING. Crispy exterior with a good amount of filling and real squid pieces with yummy flavoured salt. The fruit desserts on the other hand are pretty simple and not worth it imo. The mango diced jelly drink was nothing special and has no jelly. I havent tried the other herbal teas or soups but not sure I would come back to try those."}
{"text":"*Cash only.   Tracy Dessert is a tiny place and it can get very crowded at night. The place is very clean looking and I actually enjoy their decor. Other than dessert, the store also sells assortments of savoury dishes, and most of the items are under $10.   -Mango Tapioca Mixed - $4.45:  it is basically a bowl of sweet, creamy mango that has been blended, then mixed with tiny pearls of tapioca, and topped with chunks of mango. The mango puree isn't soupy, nor does it have the texture of a smoothie. The tapioca helped to thicken the mango puree and luckily the mango chunks were a bit tart, which makes it a perfect blend of sweetness and tanginess :).  -Homemade Grass Jelly with Mango and Milk - $6.25: In my opinion this dish was a bit sweeter than others due to the condensed milk, but nonetheless it was still good. Also, don't order this if you don't like grass jelly. I understand it's a love it or hate it ingredient. If I have to describe it, it basically has no taste and is a bit bitter, it needs a lot of help with something sweet.  -Mango Pudding with Sea Coconut Jelly & Mixed Fruit - $4.95: the mango pudding wasn't too sweet and honestly, it didn't have much mango flavor... I don't know if they mixed up my order but I definitely think this wasn't a mango pudding, unless I'm doing something wrong here and I am not supposed to taste the mango? lol. Anyways, I still enjoyed it and the kiwi added some tartness and balanced the entire dish. Again, the sea coconut jelly is probably another love it or hate it ingredients. The consistency is very .. unique as these were a bit harder than normal jellies, and they add a touch of sweetness to the dish. I also like adding it to dessert as it provides a refreshing aftertaste."}
{"text":"Located in the FMP plaza, Tracy dessert is a typical Chinese dessert spot. Nothing too fancy, you get what you came for.  They have your typical Chinese sago and coconut milk desserts and your grass jelly drinks too.  I would say this place is mainly filled with Asians because let's face it we have bomb desserts.  They also have snacks and pretty big sized clay pot rice bowls if you're looking for something savoury to eat.  All in all, tracy is a good spot if you're craving that Asian sweets but don't expect great service or outstanding food."}
{"text":"The fried milk is all right.   Pretty underwhelmed with the other desserts I tried."}
{"text":"If you enjoy soft desserts and enjoy ginger, I HIGHLY recommend the Double Boiled Egg with Ginger juice. There's a 20 minute prep time, but I come here often just to get that. I've been to numerous other Chinese dessert places in the GTA and I can confidently say that Tracy Desserts has the best one re: texture and flavour. Texture and fragility of this dessert is perfection.   Their mango/pomelo dessert is so good. I can echo other people's concerns about pricing.. it's $6.75 for that dessert :( but the consistency and mango/pomelo ratio is perfect. Their fruit is also fresh and ripe. Would totally order again. I need to try more of their desserts!   I've also had their rice hot pots that are recommended for two people. I also encourage people to try these as well if they're looking for a more than just dessert. There are six different toppings that you can get and the rice that's on the surface of the bowl gets crispy too (if you're into that). I think the price is around $13 for a bowl, but it's so worth and it's a great sharing dish.   What's even better is that Tracy Desserts is open late. 12am on most days, and 2am on Fridays and Weekends. I see some people complaining about \"cash only\". Yes, it's true, but almost every traditional Chinese dessert place is cash only. The tea that they serve off the bat is also superb. It's a special red date tea that you'd normally have to specially order (and pay for) if you go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Tracy Dessert is a small little restaurant that features a lot of authentic Asian style desserts and snacks. The restaurant is open late on Saturdays (till 2 am) and has fairly steady business through the night.   We came in at about 11 in the evening and it was a full house at that point. The service was a little slow, we didn't get water until 10 minutes later.  The Matcha Milk Snowflake Ice was pretty good, it contains three fruits of your choice along with the matcha ice and was very tasty. Not too sweet.  We also got a Hot dessert soup which had small little tapioca and taro in coconut milk. There was a bit too much tapioca in my opinion but still nonetheless a pretty good dessert.  Recommended but don't stay too long, the hard wooden chairs get pretty uncomfortable to sit on!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Tracy Dessert ??? is small cozy Chinese dessert house located in the plaza of First Markham Place. One of my go-to dessert house of all times in the Markham area. With the quick service and consistent food quality, I always recommend it to my friends.   ??? has been here for more than a decade. It has the same name as the large dessert chain in Hong Kong, but I doubt they are the same/related. While the original ones in Hong Kong have much better quality, Tracy Dessert is really as close as you can get.  I was here last night after a dinner date. I felt a bit adventurous and ordered the Sweet Walnut Soup -something I would not order unless I know it is good - and to my surprise, it did not disappoint me! Hot, smooth, and seemingly fresh :)  I would also recommend the lightly battered, deep fried milk custard, it is definitely one of my fave items on the menu. I have also tried a lot of their non-dessert items - they are all great for sharing, and quality is consistently up to par.  The only con I have is their dessert items with fresh mangoes. Never seem to be in season (very sour!) and they always offer so little. The original ones in Hong Kong always have in season sweet mangoes, maybe because they are close to the tropics. Anyways, I'll let you be the judge."}
{"text":"The after-after-party caravan (of a Yelp event) made it's way to Tracy Dessert. It was a sweet denouement to a very foodie evening: started off with French goodies and ended with Asian goodies.  The only thing white about Tracy Dessert is it's English signage at the entrance, everything inside is full-on homage to everything oriental. Thanks to the guiding and goading presence of Jen K, we ended up ordering a whole bunch of healthy desserts: sesame porridge, mango slices in mango pudding and tapioca and green tea ice shavings. It's a lot, but according to Jen K eating all that is the equivalent of doing two hours of Bikram Yoga! Eating healthy desserts is how Jen K maintains her svelte figure. Appeased by this nugget of information, we calmly went through all the goodies.  The mango slices with tapioca were very fresh and very juicy: great job sourcing good mango in early fall! The green tea shaved ice was a standout: it wasn't too cold, and the flavoring was subtle and accompanied with other sweeter things like jelly beans and red beans. I've never had this before and was very happy to try it out! I wasn't too too fond of the sesame porridge but it looked and tasted very healthy! I really appreciated that none of the things we ordered were overtly sweet.  All, in all I really enjoyed my time here. Tracy Dessert is as authentic and as delicious a Chinese dessert place you can find in the GTA, but then I am a gweilo so what do I know?"}
{"text":"I had the tofu pudding dessert and my friends had the mango pudding. mmmmm....so good! Wish I had tried more on the dessert."}
{"text":"CASH ONLY, they really need more of these signs around the restaurant to warn customers   I'm not sure what they expect you to do if you're here alone and cashless, no ATMs or banks around so I guess you can always offer to wash the dishes ?  Dessert, snacks, and clay pot rice are among my favourite in the city.  - tofu dessert is freshly made and very yummy, not available earlier in the day though - fruits are always plump and fresh - snacks are not greasy and nicely portioned, (the curried balls are not the best) - stone pot rice takes 25 minutes to make so order ahead, but it's so worth it! God I love their stone pot rice.. - even the date infused water they serve is pretty tasty  This is a place I always gravitate towards when I have a craving for Asian desserts and snacks, and I live in downtown Toronto, the trip is worth it just for their food. So check them out if you're still hesitating, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"In a convenient location and has a huge menu selection, which might be slightly overwhelming and hard to choose if you haven't been here before (because you just wanna try everything).   They also offer casserole rice, which takes a while to come out so if you're ordering that for some reason at a dessert place, do that first thing.   Parking is close by, but everyone tries to park in that area since it's close to all the restaurants in that corner. This place is usually packed on weekends, I'd say about 9 or 10 at night, since they do close later.   I'm not a fan of sharing my table with strangers... so I usually just wait for a whole seat. It's a common thing at this place so if you don't like sharing tables either, prepare to wait in the space-limited waiting area right by the door (good luck in the winter).  Seems like mangoes were a thing here; their menu is practically half of mango stuff and they even have a mango shelf off to the side. While the mango pomelo is a popular Asian dessert, you wouldn't get the 'best' one here. It's a bit sour for my liking, and the pomelo is almost bitter the last 2 times I had it... even when the fruits are in season. For the price they charge, it's also not that good of deal either.  Prices are a bit off... so if you want a good deal for a good meal, go to the one in the Midland and Finch plaza. I prefer this place if I was closer to the area, but for Markham, this place is decent."}
{"text":"I have visited here a few times for dessert and each time, I had a great experience.   For the decor, it's this traditional Chinese themed, with stools as chairs. They aren't comfy but they still seat you.   Let's get to the food. I don't know about you, but I love their water. The water that they serve is actually with red dates, and it tastes amazing. For dessert, I've ordered from the shaved ice to the herbal jelly to the walnut paste. For savoury food, I've tried their steamed chicken rice in a clay pot  and the rice noodle roll. All I can say is I haven't been disappointed with the desserts, but it doesn't blow your mind, it's what you expect with your usual Chinese dessert.  And the service is okay...nothing impressive but nothing great either.   What's worth trying? Definitely their savoury foods - surprisingly you see a lot of people order food here and it's pretty good.  Tips: if you plan to order the steamed chicken rice in a clay pot, be prepared to wait for 20 mins!   I have returned multiple times so I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Great Mango pudding. Not only do they put real mangoes into the mango pudding, but they also cut up fresh mango to lay on top of your mango pudding dish.  Costs $4.50 for mango pudding, for a tasty one, I consider this to be reasonably priced."}
{"text":"small little place, doesn't seat too many but still a nice place. i usually come for the steamed rice rolls with sesame sauce after watching a movie.  lots to choose from in traditional chinese desserts. \"tong yuen\", grass jelly, sago, mango, papaya, all that goodness. pretty sure there are some herbal stuff too but i never try those ones.  lookin at under $10 a person usually."}
{"text":"Giving this place a 5 stars for not the desserts, but their hot rice pot (Chinese BiBimBap) :) omg it's yummy, good priced and freshly made.  Don't get their specialty herbal soup ... Not so good. Dessert is so so, kinda pricy for he good stuff (i.e. Papaya)  Highlight of the visit: Rice Pots!  Food (Taste): 4/5 Food (Presentation):43/5 Kitchen (Delivery Speed): 4/5 - 30 mins for rice hot pot. Not bad Service: 1.5/5 - most time a bit of an attitude Ambiance: 3/5 Fun Factor: na/5"}
{"text":"I came in one afternoon when it was slow hoping for some decent \"Sweet Water\" (Cantonese sweet dessert).  Man, I was totally let down.  Old School types like myself prefer high quality ingredients, which often require substantial \"prep work\".  For me to give a thumbs up, the prep work must show thru.  Aroma, consistency, subtle flavoring, and freshness via small batches are all paramount.  To me, this is a very generic bubble tea type of quick fixing very common in a typical Asian mall."}
{"text":"I am so glad I come to Tracy Dessert when I have a craving for Chinese dessert one evening.  The fresh fruit with grass and sea jello I ordered really comes with fresh fruits! No Del Monte canned fruit at all.. Thanks so much! I was so happy. The only complain is the grass jello though home made not from can is a little too soft without too much texture and bite.  I for sure will be back again and again to try out their other desserts!!  It is so interesting that they put down the reason why they prepare certain food on the menu and what it is good for and who should not be eating that and why!  BTW, I wish they have better hours... they don't open till 2 pm till weekdays.. if not I can drop by for my lunch time desert.. (maybe not, I might get fat..........if I do that too often!)  They accepts CASH only!"}
{"text":"Sweet almond thick soup. Sweet black sesame thick soup. sweet potato soup w sweet rice dumpling  sweet sticky rice w coconut milk  are all 4.65  cad hot and yummy~~~ Seaame and almond are my favorite"}
{"text":"This place is a great alternative for desserts when Sugar Marmalade is packed. I love coming here for their HK style steamed rice noodle rolls - it's the most legit I've had in Toronto! If anything, I would recommend people come here for this."}
{"text":"Small little dessert place in fmp, but has a hot pot rice and fried chicken wings that are really good. I'd say that the fried chicken is a must try. The rice is really good and is meant for 2 people. The tea they serve is pretty unique. Got the tofu dessert and it was pretty standard, nothing exceptional but good.  The price is average, reasonable for the quality of food."}
{"text":"Small, old-fashioned, and very traditionally decorated Chinese dessert place near one of the entrances into First Markham Place.  We were looking for snow ice dessert and was specifically referred here as they offered it.  Their dessert menu is expansive and comprehensive, plenty of options; they also serve foods.  We went on an early afternoon so the place was nearly empty, and one person took care of orders and serving.  Tracy Dessert calls the ice dessert we wanted \"Snowflake ice.\"  This is a pre-flavored block of ice that shaves out snow-like.  We ordered the original base topped with red bean, coconut jelly, and diced mango, and the matcha base topped with kiwi and ringed with watermelon and cantaloupe balls.  Took a while to make, we were nearly done with one while the other was being made, but that was fine.  Both desserts were very good, nice texture, tasty with fresh toppings.  Matcha was the flavor winner in our group.  A bit expensive at nearly $8, but a good size portion, well-made, and worth having once in a while."}
{"text":"First off, the two stars is for their food which is pretty alright considering the price which is very reasonable and affordable. I mostly come here for their shaved ice which is the best I've come across so far. Other than that, there's not much keeping me satisfied.   Second and foremost, their service is terrible. I've honestly never come across a place with service that's as bad as this place. I've gone here a lot in the past and I'm no stranger to their menu but the last time I came here was my last time entirely.   I remember ordering a dish that I asked if it had nuts as I can't have it due to allergies and the waitress said no (rather bluntly and rudely mind you). When another waiter delivered the dish to our table, there was peanut sauce dribbled all over the food. Naturally I asked them to replace it with a nut-free saucing and they told me I had to pay for the one served to me. Keep in mind I had asked them PRIOR to ordering it. The waiter and the waitress eventually blamed it on me for not letting them know early in advance. Seriously??   Worst of all, when their manager came out to resolve the issue, he blamed it on me too. A place that blames their own customers for a mistake that belongs to their workers is God awful. Not only was I appalled by my friend was too. The manager begrudgingly took off the peanut dish from our bill in the end and by this time I was already so angry and disappointed that I didn't bother leaving a tip. And guess what, the waitress literally stopped me from taking my change because she wanted a tip. Are you kidding me?  Never again. Which is a shame because I love their shaved ice. Oh well."}
{"text":"Good place to come for late night dessert and snacks. The restaurant is pretty small so at times it can get crammed. The menu size is nice and the food is really good. I love it."}
{"text":"So I speak Cantonese.. I can speak it fluently. But I have an accent and I wouldn't understand well if someone speaks to me too fast.  The place was packed so we couldn't sit down, but it want busy because everybody already has their orders. So when we ordered (takeout), she was rushing me, rude to me, had me repeat things as if I was speaking French. I ended up speaking English and didn't smile.  Dessert was okay though :) +1 star"}
