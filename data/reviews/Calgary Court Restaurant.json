{"text":"Have great hk style milk tea and good food.  It gets quite busy at times, so be prepared to wait for tables if heading there for lunch or dinner.  Servers are friendly but very busy so might not be attentive at times."}
{"text":"Really fan of this restaurant? wonton noodle and Hainanese Chicken are fabulous? ????????? ???????????????????"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my friend once and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food. The restaurant was pretty full as it was a weekday and those who worked downtown were all out for lunch. We got seated relatively quickly and after looking at the menu, I decided to try their Shanghai fried noodles while my friend got the curry brisket with rice. After taking my first bite of noodles, I knew I had found a great cook. Most people who aren't Asian won't know about this distinct flavour that can be found in their food known as \"wok-hei.\" Only a super hot wok plus the techniques of a skilled cook can create this added flavour. I can't describe what it tastes like but I definitely know when I'm eating it. Needless to say, I devoured almost the entire plate of noodles by myself.  The only downside is that since it's located in Chinatown, parking can be tough and pricey. I definitely want to come back to try more dishes and hopefully be pleasantly surprised again."}
{"text":"Generally I go to Chinatown for bubble tea and snacks, but this is a place that I've become to really like and visit more. My family and I went for a walk on the Bow River pathways and spontaneously chose Calgary Court after deciding we were all, honestly, very hungry.   The food is great, I enjoyed the Hainan rice and hot pot. Not really a fan of the \"Chinese soup\", but there are lots of other nice broth-y, soupy things to try.   The service is okay, I guess. For a crowded chinatown restaurant, the servers do try their best to make sure they meet (most) of your needs. Plates come out, tea is poured.   If you can get past the lack of service, give this place a try."}
{"text":"I am so happy to find this place. Excellent Cantonese food and Hong Kong cafe style food. I had the Pineapple Pork Bun with Pork Chop, Pig Jelly congee and a Hong Kong style coffee for lunch. They were all delicious."}
{"text":"This has become my favorite HK style cafe in Calgary. The food is really good, the portions are huge and its inexpensive. I come here often for lunch and the service is pretty quick. That being said you have to flag down the waitresses if you want something and it can be tough to get their attention when it's busy. My go to items are the baked Portuguese chicken rice and beef flank noodle soup.  I love the breakfast menu here as well. The egg & spam sandwich is really good; the egg is creamy and fluffy, the bread is soft and the spam is flavorful. When I want something healthier I will get the ham sandwich instead of spam. The other breakfast combos are tasty as well."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm usually the only \"whitey\" in here but this place is both delicious and very affordable! Service is quick and efficient. We like to visit during their \"High Tea\" special times on the weekends (late afternoon). I don't think I've ever been disappointed by one of their specials. I'd recommend giving this place a shot if you're in China town looking for a bite to eat."}
{"text":"Food: our go-to place for late night grub...substantial portions, NOT Western style Chinese.  Our favorites are the beef ho fan noodles, and the beef and Chinese greens soup.  The dinner specials are also a good deal (changing every night of the week: includes salad, soup, toast, tea and main course for about $10-11). BUT, make sure to get the delicious mushroom soup rather than the Chinese soup (a dreadful watery cross between Scotch broth and plain boiled gourds).  Service: hit and miss.  Dishes come out  as each is ready. Tea is usually refilled quickly. Go to the counter to pay, because they are unlikely to bring your bill within the calendar year."}
{"text":"We had 4 different dishes and all were not not very good.  Tankatau pork cutlet was dry but huge portion.  Strip steak tasted good but French fries was a very poor pairing. These two also included frozen vegetables, broccoli, cauliflower and carrots.  Very strange.  Tamato soups and cream of mushroom were also very strange when we asked for hot and sour...  Seshshwan chicken was undercooked and quiet bland.  Curry pork was a sliced pork chop with gravy spiced with yellow curry.  All and all we were very disappointed with the food.  The server was very nice and saved the meal from a disaster.  If you're looking for good Chinese in Calgary, keep looking."}
{"text":"It was a pleasant surprise to have some decent and authentic HK-style cafe food in Calgary after 6 days road trip eating fast food. All the dishes were flavourful and the dinner specials came with the choice of soup, which we chose the chinese daily soup. The baked portuguese chicken with rice was my favourite and was very tasty. The HK style milk tea was very smooth and silky and pretty legit. I would definitely recommend coming here for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"SERVICE - Worst I have ever experienced in Calgary, if not in Canada.  There were three silly Chinese girls behind the counter, making fun of everyone in the restaurant in loud voices.  I ordered in English and I'm pretty sure they were not aware that I also speak fluent Cantonese.  Anyway, there were two rather overweight Caucasian ladies in a booth two down from us, and the servers nicknamed them the \"White elephants\". HOW DISRESPECTFUL!!    Food - not on par with other places in Chinatown.  We had the basic chow mein and chow fun.  2 / 5, bland, chow mein noodles were soft, not crispy.  Never again for me or my friends.  Skip this dirty, disgusting place and go to Silver Dragon, Ho Won, or the noodle shop across the street."}
{"text":"Tried their beef tendon noodle soup, nothing that particularly sticks out about the meal other than that it is a good example of a HK style meal.   I found the fact that they accepted credit card was very odd, but much appreciated and that alone would pull me away from other HK cafes."}
{"text":"This is a great Hong Kong style café that offers a quick meal at a reasonable price.  If you have no idea how a Hong Kong style café  might be like, picture an Asian Denny's.  It's a loud and bustling venue with a lot of in and out traffic.  If you like variety, here is where you will find an extensive menu of over 300 menu items.  They have specials on a daily basis which consists of an entree, soup, rice or spaghetti, garlic toast and a drink. All this for no more than $15, tax and tip included.  The service is fast and the food is worth every penny.  When people ask for a good Chinese restaurant recommendation, I often reply with four questions \"How traditional?\", \"How adventurous?\" , \"Who are you going with?\" and \"How much are you looking to spend?\"  This isn't the place to take your first date, but it offers good food that comes out quick and it is easy on the wallet.  It's not hard to find a dish that is captivating for each person in the party.  There is a wide range of selection from Sweet & Sour Pork with Rice to Deep Fried Pig's Intestine, if neither sounds appealing maybe just settle for a Ham & Egg Sandwich.  Give this place a try, you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"Stopped by recently mid evening, not particularly busy, perhaps 70%. First visit in years.  The place was never anything special, but it has gone downhill from my past visits.  When we finally got a server over, she said it would take at least 20 minutes to get anything fried. Okay, we can work around that.  They were featuring Hainan chicken on a menu, we both ordered it.  I'm not a stranger to this dish. I've never pushed it away before. We both did this time, and we were hungry.  The chicken was clammy and tasteless.  The rice was dry and tasteless.  There was no ginger sauce. There was a watery chile sauce.  The sweet soy sauce tasted like molasses.  They couldn't even come up with the standard sliced cucumber garnish."}
{"text":"Friday off today and I went to Calgary Court for brekkie! HK style breakfast has a lot of option and this place has a lot of option and mostly all under $7. Usually we go to Sun Bbq for HK style breakfast but it was not open for some reason. However, I do know Calgary Court and Sun BBQ are under the same manager and another restaurant in the north (correct if i am wrong Yelpers). Today, i ordered their special congee (peanuts & dry scallop), with soy sauce fried noodle, and hot milk tea. Food came out hot and satisfying. Service today was pretty good as it was not too busy.   Their soup noodles are good as well!  For a quick and cheap breakfast and you are by Chinatown, I recommend Calgary Court!"}
{"text":"Great Hong Kong style restaurant. Great food. The food has big portion. Service is typical service you would receive from a Chinese restaurant. It's a busy place during lunch hour. It's recommended to come before 12 to avoid line up."}
{"text":"????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"They need to use less MSG - the dishes are not consider healthy in any way."}
{"text":"The chef's special prawns with ground pork came with a delicious soup. This was a hearty combo and together with the tea really made for an amazing lunch.  I'll definitely return. Choosing an item from the five menus was a delightful challenge because there is so much variety!"}
{"text":"Lots of yelpers rate about this restaurant either hit or miss; to be honest as an \"Asian\" customer I consider as a hit. Compare with other Asian restaurant, the food quality was fresh and taste delicious. Always busy and lots of turn overs from breakfast until late dinner. A huge variety of Asian (Hong Kong style) menu options except dim sum. Services as deeper thought for Caucasian customer it could be a miss, because some of the wait staff as their English language proficiency standards are low, but they are hardworking staff trying their best to refill your hot teas or water. A survivor tips into this restaurant as Caucasian guest; 1) be patients with them while ordering food or drinks, the menus are well translated with some pictures provide. 2) If you need something from wait staff even bill or refilling waters, BE AGGRESSIVE either wave or politely call out any wait staff. Because they don't sign wait staff into section or particular tables, they work as a team, the whole wait team will take care of you. Hopefully my tips will helps. Good Luck!"}
{"text":"Love the breakfast lunch and dinner here. This restaurant seem like never sleep. They start at 8 am in the morning till late night. We were here lunch and breakfast. The breakfast is Hong Kong Style morning call.   We actually selected the Southeast Asia cuisine in the lunch time. We have the charsiew (BBQ) pork rice, hainanese chicken and the Traditional Hong Kong Style Spicy Noodle Soup. The rice dice come with soup of your choice and dessert. Not bad at all. The bbq was good marinate. It is juicy and great taste. The hainanese chicken may need some more work. However, the star is the traditional noodle. It has fish ball, pork skin, squids, Chinese sausage, turnip, and pig jelly. Yummy. This cannot be found in Tampa Florida.   The lunch is certainly a big meal. The service is good. We love the food here."}
{"text":"I'm from VA and we have NOTHING as good as this place. We don't even have Asian restaurant that sells hong Kong style coffee or the milk tea that they sell. so when I first heard about this from my brother in law I had to come try it out for myself. A group of 4 and we ordered almost 7 items and destoryed all the food.   I have to say that the red rice pots are the best thing to order there and their ice milk tea.  also the service was decent here. its not a full service all around but they do their best. also if you speak Cantonese it helps since all the waitress speaks that language."}
{"text":"This is a more Hong Kong style cafe.  You need to raise your hand for service which is always quick. The food is always good here, the portions are smaller than some other restaurants. But if you want the more authentic chinese dining experience this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Listen to me, if you want authentic Hong Kong Style Cafe food, you have to try this restaurant.  And when it comes to Hong Kong Style Cafe, you have to try the MIKE TEA (hot/cold).    To be honest, I think just because this is not one of the cleanest restaurants actually makes this restaurant more like the Hong Kong Style cafe in Hong Kong.  Yes I know it might sound a bit un-appetizing, but if you can get over the cleanliness, the food is actually quite delicious.  They do have quite a selection on their menu (breakfast, lunch, snack and dinner).  I love to order their daily special combo even though I can never finish it.  It usually comes with a drink of your choice, soup, one slice of garlic toast and your main dish.  Yup, that's how we HK people eat! hehe   I am not gonna rate their service because it will only bring the 4 stars to maybe a 2 stars.  I never really quite enjoy their service.....but if you can also get pass their lack of service,  I do recommend to give this restaurant a try.    3/30"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favourite spots for Chinese food in Calgary! My girlfriend and I had the hainanese chicken dish along with the chicken and fish baked dish with portgegeus sauce and cream sauce.   The food came fairly quick and it was quite enjoyable. I'll definitely return for some more whenever I'm in the calgary area!"}
{"text":"#114 It's 10:45pm on a Friday night.  You're hungry.  You don't want a burger or pub food or any fast food (sorry Denny's, McDonald's, Tim Hortons, Wendy's but I just played volleyball for 2 hours and I need sustenance without sickness).  Options.. options... telephones.. telephones.. why do hotels always hide their telephones (in my best Bugs Bunny voice, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transylvania_6-5000_%281963_film%29 for a description of where this quote comes from and why)?  See, this is what happens when you are hungry after a long workout!  Anyway, my friend suggested a trip to Calgary's Chinatown.  Those who know me know I am very picky when it comes to Chinese food since one of my Vancouver friends (when I visit) takes me to Richmond to the best Chinese places outside of China.  As we parked, we walked 2 blocks to the Calgary Court Restaurant (which apparently open to midnight on Friday and Saturday nights).  Court is now in session with the honourable judge James at your service.  We were acknowledged immediately and got to choose our own table and we got one a few feet from the window but in view of an either 26\", 27\", or 32\" TV (hard to tell but I can see the Chinese program that is apparently Vancouver-based as all the commercials were for Vancouver and I recognized some of the businesses) across the restaurant. I think the TV should be replaced with a 42\" personally.  The waitress seem sort of timid or maybe nervous but she was courteous and prompt to bring hot tea (which normally I do not drink but it was -26°C which is -15°F (for my American friends and relatives) so a hot drink was just what the doctor ordered). She made a few menu recommendations as apparently they have a regular menu available all day and a 1 page front/back of specials that time of day dependent.  I almost got the spicy Szechuan chicken (on the 1 page front/back menu) as a group of people 3 tables had that and it looked good but it was comfort food weather so I got the House Special Fried Rice for $11.95. I expected not so fresh vegetables, rice, etc. However, I was proven wrong and then some. It was what looked like an average size plate but by the halfway point, I was almost full. The rice tasted so good (though I would like to have a spicier blend but I am willing to bet that on my next trip, I can ask for that), the vegetables included peas, carrots, and some kind of green shoots (all which tasted good and enhanced the flavour of the rice), and tiny shrimp and I believe either beef or sausage as well. By the way, I put some of the creme soup (mentioned in the next paragraph) on the House Special Fried Rice (yet another good idea by yours truly).  My friend got a dish (I don't remember the name but I just remember the portion was huge and tasty) for $17.95 that had a bowl of rice (separate) with pork chops, beef, chicken, Chinese sausage, french fries (which I thought was odd but they were good), and a bowl of some type of creme soup (which I sampled and it was delicious!!!!). He also got an iced tea (and him being Canadian/Calgarian-born Chinese and me being American, you'd thought I would have gotten the iced tea since Americans more often than not get drinks with ice in them).  From what other reviews have stated, this place was affected by the flood so I do not know what it looked like before but now the interior is very clean, ample table space, well-lit, and can have lots of people with their own conversations without intruding on the one at your table.  I did notice there were very few white people (two to be exact) in the restaurant. As a white person, if I see very few Asians in an Asian restaurant, I will not eat in said restaurant because this tells me it's not very authentic or very good.  Again, reading other reviews regarding the service, my personal experience was very positive so much so that I will be heading back again this week.  The Court has adjourned and the judge has left the building.  Note: if you are a Shaw wifi subscriber and have entered the MAC address of your device, the wifi is free."}
{"text":"I like this place because it opens so early and closes so late. This is always a good place for breakfast if you get up early and want to eat outside. There are so many choices. I prefer Gongzai noodle for breakfast to warm up my empty stomach and cold body. The price for breakfast is very cheap(average 6.50 dollars). Highly Recommended Cantonese restaurant."}
{"text":"Pretty big portions of the Pork Chop baked rice! Pork chops fried fresh and lightly, not too greasy. The only complaints I have:  - The rice under the baked sauce and pork chop was luke-warm, like it sat there. Didn't bother heating it back up unfortunately. I know this stuff is prepped in advance but yea...   - Really slow service, although they weren't rude or anything at least.  Overall, good value, good authentic HK chinese style of food - Can't complain!"}
{"text":"I've eaten in most of the Chinatowns in Canada, in San Francisco, CA, and while living in Taiwan, also in HK and Philippines. As most foodies know good from bad, and average, I can only give this restaurant an average rating. It won't hold up in Taipei, nor in most chinatowns I've been in as a top-notch 'must return' restaurant. Why such a low rating? None of the 5 items ordered were unusually good or exceptional. All were only okay. I've had simply delicious wonton (wondun) in Taipei, and this is a bland offering. The chopped greens were average and mild-flavoured. The spicy beef was average, boring and the sauce just not at all there. We ordered 2 other dishes, but I forget what they were. Just not worth mentioning! Even the rice was nothing special. Lukewarm tea in tall plastic glasses says it all. If you want much better Chinese, go to The Silver Dragon around the corner on the next block, and get into great dim sum, especially on weekend mornings. Or go along a few doors and try Bon-ga Korean Restaurant, another fine main-dish restaurant. Calgary Court? Would I return?  Not very quickly. Just a notch above pleasant peasant Chinese food, but the price is quite popular, and hence is busy with mostly Chinese, a few Filipinos, and a scattering of caucasians."}
{"text":"HK style tea (milk tea), as many reviewed, is a must try as it is as authentic and represents the best of HK.  I have breakfast, lunch and dinner there all the time for many years and it's food quality is consistently excellent."}
{"text":"One of the best HK Style Cafe restaurants in CGY.   They are open late night so when you are hungry after the club or late munchies. Come here...    My friend introduced me  to this place.  These are this dishes that we usually order ...   so mnay diff foods.. so many choices... good price service is OK.. not the best..  the servers are a bit snobby and do stare lol   I like:    Dumpling & Noodle Soup  $6 bucks  S&S Prawns - fresh, hot, crispy and yummy S&S sauce  #99  Seafood Fried Noodles in Cream Sauce  #130 Special Fried Rice  Seriously I haven't had everything on the menu.. but all I hear is great stuff"}
{"text":"I prefer Calgary Court over U & Me. The food is consistently fresher, even at night. The lunch specials ($10.00) aren't their signature super size portions, which I think is a good thing. You leave full, not stuffed.   To date, I enjoyed their how fun noodles with shrimp, BBQ pork and egg on rice, and spicy beef on rice. I haven't tried the baked Portuguese pork chop on rice, which I hear is delicious.  I also want to try Calgary Court's version of Hot and Sour, Tea Duck and Cumin Ribs.   As for service, when its packed, service is fast and efficient. Get out of their way when you see them coming over, they are on a mission. However, all the servers have been pleasant enough. No complaints with service."}
{"text":"Really good authentic Hong Kong style food. My kids love it! Will go back for sure! We have been eating American food almost every day. Have been craving for Chinese food on this trip. So happy that we could find this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Calgary Court restaurant serves authentic Hong Kong style café food!   Cart noodles, Hainenese chicken rice, wonton noodles, etc. are their signature dishes!"}
{"text":"I love it here. Though, I've only tried a select few items, it's enough to make me want to come back. Their baked rice/noodle menu is the absolute BEST. I usually take out food from here, but I dined in a couple nights ago and the service was good, and the place was clean. If you're not sure what you're in the mood for, Calgary court will suffice. I usually order: baked chicken with cream corn sauce and rice. Their milk tea is good too!"}
{"text":"It's a obvious Hong Kong style restaurant. Everything here looks pretty good to gain my appetite. I've been here once for breakfast, I think it would the cheapest and more nutrition breakfast ever I seen in the Chinatown. I order a combo with beef rice noodle and hoklok?( I don't know how to spell.)  it's delicious. I hope to be here next time"}
{"text":"On a stampede parade day, after the parade, friends decided to go to this place for lunch. All tables were full when we reached this place. Waited a bit to grab a table and ordered from Ala Carte menu and few of my friends order the lunch specials.  Ah, it was little hard to find the right dish for me as I have restrictions with beef and pork. Finally ordered two main courses after talking to the waitress and she was about to burst out on me for my questions on the dish. Not sure if it is how they deal with the customers , could have been more patient understanding my restrictions and preferences. They serve free hot/cold tea with the food which infact was a feel good factor. Place was clean but busy.  Finally my order was on my table and was very quick. I had chicken, egg fried rice and Shanghai style hand made noodles with chicken and vegetables. And also shared some soup and roasted bread with friends which tasted so right.  Overall the service was quick during such a busy time. Food Portions were ample to fill stomach along with tea."}
{"text":"I was surprised how clean and new looking it was inside- definitely not the feeling I usually get from hong kong style cafes. I had a beef and vegetable fried noodle dish and the hainan chicken. Both dishes were up to par and tasted great. The hainan yellow rice however was not as good as Mui Garden in Vancouver. I liked how the lemon ice tea wasn't too sweet. I'd definitely come back and try more dishes! ^_^"}
{"text":"My uncle that lives in Calgary loves coming to this place.  I arrived at this place at about 8 pm on a Friday night to meet up with him.  It wasn't too busy and we were seated right away.  We both ordered their house special Hainan curry beef rice that came with soup and a drink.  Of course I had to order my favourite drink - ice cold milk tea/coffee mix and Borscht soup.  Both of these items were quite tasty.  The curry beef also was tasty (not spicy) and came with the flavorful oily rice.  The portion size was small though and there wasn't enough curry sauce to finish up my rice with. Overall,  a tasty $12 dish but small portion."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 2008. They have a huge menu selection! I highly recommend the congee. My favorite is the chef's special congee, but if you can't stomach the tripe there's tamer options. Check out the back of the menu for the daily special. It's a set meal. Don't order the lamb hot pot. Most of the noodle dishes are really good."}
{"text":"Yes it may not be pretty or clean, but if you want a HK cafe experience there's really no other place (except for the other CC in Harvest hill and Pebble street).  Food is good, service is expected, experience is authentic. Bookmarked."}
{"text":"I love this HK style cafe.  It's one of the few places in Calgary that serve HK style breakfasts in the morning and it's great value.  I bring my kids here often and it's very kid-friendly with lots of high chairs and friendly staff.    I love the fried rice and fried noodle dishes.  I always order take out often and it's always been fresh and fast.  Parking is a bit of a pain as it's only street parking around and spots are always taken!"}
{"text":"I came here one day for breakfast by accident because I didn't realize at the time that Great Taste didn't open until later. I am happy that it happened because now I have a favourite conger place! If you go before 11am, they serve a daily special conger with your choice of fried Chinese doughnut or radish cake along with tea; all for a decent price! Hands down solid Chinese breakfast food."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years! Decent priced authentic HK style diner food. Food is pretty on point, not the best, but pretty good for Calgary. My favorite dishes are on their special menus - the casserole combo dinners. Whenever I'm asked to recommend a good Chinese restaurant for lunch or dinner, I recommend Calgary Court for its price and food quality. The place is relatively busy at peak hours. Decor and ambience is nothing special but I do enjoy the hustle and bustle of the place at peak hours, because it reminds me of home. Service is alright for a Chinese restaurant too. Tea always gets topped up and most of the servers can speak enough English to take orders if you're not able to speak Chinese. Food usually comes out pretty quickly, too. Overall, I would recommend."}
{"text":"We are big fans of Calgary Court. Having lived in Calgary a long time ago, I'm sure I'd been here a handful of times (or maybe the restaurant before this), but had always taken for granted the convenience and the value of having a good HK-style cafe in Chinatown. Living in Ottawa now, I realize that we don't even have something like this that compares.  What we like: - decent HK-style dishes at great value (especially tea time offerings!) - good portions, at least of the chef's special (which comes with soup, toast and drink for 12$!) - some reviews say spotty service, but our food came really fast even if the restaurant was 3/4 full at 2PM - strong HK-style milk tea - lots of seating / generous amt of space - open long hours / late  During our quick late lunch there, we personally don't have any complaints. Parking is a little expensive in the area, but that's downtown for you. Very satisfying mid-meal for 20$ (for two people)! Love it!"}
{"text":"I've only gone to Calgary Court for late night eats/cravings so I can't comment on how it is during normal hours. It's always packed on weekends as it's only one of a few places that stay open late (1:00am Friday and Saturday). I didn't realize it was part of the Taste of Asia group until we were given a takeout bag (they own T.Pot and several other Asian restaurants in town).  They've got multiple menus to choose from but you can only order from some of them depending on what time it is. My advice is stick with the HK and Chinese options. We saw several tables ordering HK cafe food (such as the baked rice/spaghetti dishes).  - Vietnamese lemon grass beef fried clear noodles (#38i) ($12.99) - not good. I'm not even sure how this is a Vietnamese dish. Noodles did not have a good chew and taste was mundane. A sad, sad dish. Don't make our mistake, get something else. - Singapore style fried vermicelli (spicy) (#25i) ($13.50) - we've ordered this multiple times and it's been solid every time (except once when they put way too much spice powder). Most recent trip was back to normal. Comes with onions, sliced carrots, bean sprouts and shrimp. - Stir-fried gai lan with garlic (#16h) ($12.95) - really garlicky and the gai lan is perfectly cooked. Perfect if you're craving some vegetables.  It's decent."}
{"text":"What a great find!!  Authentic casual Chinese food for reasonable price!  My family have been on a road trip and really craved some good Chinese food and this totally hit the spot!  We got Beef Chow Fun, Singaporean Noodles, and black pepper fried homemade noodle w beef.  They were all excellent but the Singaporean Noodle were outstanding!  They were better than the ones I usually get from Sam Woo in LA!  There were lines out the door when we left at 6:30.  We had checked out a few other restaurants in the China Town area and none had as many people in the restaurant as this one; I think that says something!"}
{"text":"Great service and great food . Stumbled upon this place looking for dinner so we decided to stop in . Traveling with our two year old so we were looking for something that was just a little kid friendly . The staff was extremely accommodating to start off our dinner . The restaurant was very well kept and neat . The food was fresh and really tasty . Reasonably priced and a really good selection of food ."}
{"text":"Breakfast is very reasonable. It used to be a secret; it's now packed by 9:30am on the weekends.  The fried noodles, dumping soup and wonton soup are always my favourite.  The baked rice with pork chops and tomato sauce is also very tasty."}
{"text":"New tables?  New decor?  New washrooms?  The new Calgary Court is like a girl from high school that you haven't seen for awhile. Back in the day, you kinda liked her, but it wasn't anything too special.    Fast forward one year later, you bump into her at the mall, and she's strutting a new outfit, new hairstyle, new makeup and you are suddenly mesmerized.  That, my friends, is the new Calgary Court.  As James C mentioned, if it is a late night and you aren't digging the bar food scene, Calgary Court is a pretty solid bet. Service is still pretty bad, but the food is decent."}
{"text":"I remember my many late nights years ago when I used to come here after work (midnight). No matter what time of the day it is... I come back here time and time again.The food quality here is one of the better places for hk style menu options; its my go to restaurant for such no matter what. Service here is hit or miss as other reviewers have mentioned. This place will bombard you with menu choices right off the bat. I typically go for one of their set menu items that are on special as I find that comes out the quickest and is the best value.   My guilty pleasure here of course is their \"mixed grill\" It comes with meats from all the main food groups... pork, beef, chicken, fries, bacon... you get my drift *nudgenudge* all drowned under a thick black pepper sauce. mmmmmmm."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good HK style western food in the heart of Calgary. Late hours, and good food were the highlights.  The portuguese chicken rice and the tomato sauce pork chop on rice were both very good. The tomato sauce was thick and creamy and mixed well with the cheese and rice. The portion sizes were large and we took some home for another meal. It took some time for the food to come out, but it's understandable since these were all baked dishes (and they told us in advance too). There's lots of street parking nearby, but it might be hard depending on how busy it is.  They were very busy, even at midnight. They gave us a bunch of menus, including ones that didn't apply for the time that we showed up at (why bother giving it to us at all!?).   Overall, we enjoyed eating here, and found it pretty good even by Toronto standards."}
{"text":"They've renovated and reopened now after the flood. New decor! Come check it out while its still sparkling and shiny :) phew! Thank goodness the basement was reno'd too! Was toooo scary down there before.   So.... Food seems to be the same. Service is still the same shotty service (haha - disgruntled staff who seem to always be in a rush and never at your table.... And now mandarin speaking staff makes it difficult for me to order  in my broken Cantonese :P lol!!  But....still opened late.   Baked pork chop rice is popular."}
{"text":"This place is a gem and we've loved everything we've tried here, especially the baked spaghetti with boneless satay chicken and the Indonesian fried rice, but I have to also extol two things. One is the beverages. Yesterday I got the one called Korean style grapefruit tea (iced- you can get it hot too) and partner got the lychee tea (also iced) and both were just incredible- the lychee had a TON of fruit at the bottom; the grapefruit a ton of lightly candied grapefruit peel. Just delicious. We also had a side of gai lan in oyster sauce. Perfectly cooked and not heavy-handed on the oyster sauce- I've never had better. Last time we had the (seasonal) water spinach with preserved tofu sauce, which just blew us away but which wasn't available yesterday. Anyway, you might not expect that a place that does just huge portions of stick-to-your-ribs comfort food would also treat veggies this well, but it does, so try them too."}
{"text":"I like Calgary Court Restaurant. Best Milk Tea in town (HK style).  But the food are not as good as before (before renovation). Plus the portion is smaller and charge more.   Service is okay, but yesterday(Sunday) was really good even it was super busy. They apologized for the long line up (waiting for a table) and always talked to us how they would arrange us. And tried to understand what I would like to order and gave recommendation!   I wanna tip more, but people always say the tips do not go to the staffs. So I asked the manager (i guess she's the manager), she said the tips go to them and does not understand why customers keep saying the opposite, haha ......"}
{"text":"Came here for noodles and some chinese donuts! Noodles were very wells seasoned and tasty. The Singapore noodles were a little too spicy for my taste, but were good nonetheless (I actually found them tastier the next day!) The Gai Lan was very fresh and the garlic sauce was on point. Will come back!"}
{"text":"Great noodle place especially when hungry late at night."}
{"text":"Revisited Calgary Court after 5 years...thought I'd give it a try.  Service has certainly improved and the wait staff can speak English, so that's good!  Food wise: not too bad, Fish Slices Congee was cooked from scratch and it arrived nice and hot.  Not too salty.  just nice.  Also ordered the Beef Rice Noodle dish - quite good.  HK Milk Tea complimented my meal.  Bathrooms are downstairs in the basement - at least, they are clean."}
{"text":"My aunt and I originally wanted to go to the restaurant next door but they were closed between lunch and dinner. We came during afternoon tea (starting at 2:30 pm) and ordered from that menu. We were seated quickly but it seems as though the wait staff forgot about since since it was kinda busy. We flagged down a waitress for menus and drinks.   The food came fairly quick. It's like we just ordered and next thing we knew the noodles and fish balls arrived. It came in a large bowl but a good amount of noddles. It would've been better if there were a couple more fish balls.  My pork chop in a pineapple bun arrived a bit after the noodles. The poor bun was squished so bad in order to cut it in half. You could see the finger indents. It looked like a hamburger with a pineapple bun instead of a regular bun complete with lettuce and tomato; not what I was expecting. In terms of taste, the pork chop tasted good. The sweetness of the pineapple bun paired with the saltiness of the pork was a bit strange for me.   Overall, it was a good in between meal at an okay price point."}
