{"text":"Dirty restaurant with horrible food.  The pizza crusts they use are frozen and the ingredients are sub par.  Tons of employees standing around but not one clean table.  Would never go back or recommend."}
{"text":"I have trouble even giving this place 1 star, but since I'm usually a very easy to please diner, I will tell you to just do yourself a favor and Eat Elsewhere. 
Tried them for the first time tonight.  Worst hummus I've ever had, just like chickpeas put into a blender with no seasoning and no oil. Tasteless and bland. Pizza was a disappointment, crust hearkened back to the Domino's of the 1980s, just like cardboard with some tomato sauce and cheese. Staff was disinterested and seemed more eager to close up than to please me. I mentioned that tea was out and they made no move to get me any or to make more, and it was a good 2 hours before closing time. Even the gelato had freezer burn and tasted like old ice cubes. Yuck. Just eat at one of the many other choices in this center, like Panda Express next door,  Chipotle,  Subway,  or even Menchies yogurt.  You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! I ordered the gyro, the meat was  frozen strips of who knows what! I took one bite and  had to spit it out. The owner took my order and said 10 minutes but it was more like 30. The owner and his wife appeared to be having a heated argument while he was cooking. I wish I could say something positive about the place, but there really isn't anything."}
{"text":"Went here w/ a Groupon on a weeknight. Groupon was good for 2 lg pizzas & a lg salad. The 4 of us ordered @ the counter & our salad came out quickly. The Italian salad was fresh, tasty, & had just the right amount of dressing - not too drippy like most places. Our first pizza came out in about the time expected. The meat combo we'd ordered was delicious, plenty of toppings, piping hot. We waited...and waited...and waited for the lg hawaiian we'd also ordered & finally asked about it @ the counter. Yep, they'd forgotten it. In the meantime, our drinks needed refilling (it's a DIY drink station, which is fine) so I went up to the machine, only to find that at least 2 of the drink options were Out Of Order. When the Hawaiian pizza finally came to our table, it too, was hot, fresh & delicious. The wood fire they use puts just the perfect amount of char on the crust to make it both crispy & chewy! It makes the whole meal. However...be prepared for the Picnic Exprience if you opt to eat in. Paper cups, plates, & plastic sporks. Yes, sporks. Even for the salad. Made eating the salad somewhat challenging. Fer cryin' out loud, a case of plastic forks @ Costco can't be THAT expensive!!! I haven't eaten w/ a spork since Sloppy Joe Day in Jr. High, & I'm OLD. Great food but next time, I'll be packin'...my own fork"}
{"text":"This restaurant was previously a Red Brick Pizza location that converted to the new name while keeping the same owners.

That very fact almost kept me away, but I'm glad I gave them a shot.  I had only been to a Red Brick once about 6 yrs ago and was not impressed with the pizza and sandwich I ordered.  But this new place had advertised a particular brand of gyro meat, and I'm a real sucker for gyros.  Plus, the advertisement had come via a Hometown Buyz groupon-like deal.  So off I went.

Since it previously was a Red Brick, I wasn't at all surprised that it still looks like one.  The setup seemed the same down to the menu boards with the addition of some things like gyros.  It was late afternoon, so the place was expectedly quiet.  I was greeted promptly and courteously at the counter.  That day they were running a small pizza special as well, so I ordered the gyro and a small pepperoni pizza to go.  I was generously offered a drink while I waited.  I opted for water from the soda machine.

My order was prepared right in front of me, and I could look into the brick pizza oven and watch the pizza bake.  After just a few minutes, it was boxed and bagged to go.  I got into my car, and it just smelled so good that I couldn't wait.  Warning!  The pizza is very, very hot!  It was delicious, as the pepperoni was quite nicely spiced and the cheese (whole milk mozzarella blend?) had a great flavor.  The crust was light, chewy, and crisp.  It well surpassed my memories of the original Red Brick.

The gyro was even better.  The meat was the best gyro meat I've ever had.  It was lean, warm, piled on, and had a great flavor.  The overall gyro had a very nice proportion of meat to lettuce/tomato/onion/tzatziki to pita.  Very nice indeed.

Is it a destination kind of place to spend an evening out?  No.  But it is a high quality quick service concept that fit me well that day.

I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"The place smells weird and the pizza was burnt.  Salad was swimming in dressing and the girls behind the counter are snacking on the gelato while we look at the menu."}
{"text":"servers more intent on closing up and going home.

swept floor as we ate.
lifted mats

pizza was good
worst salad ever"}
{"text":"We love this place! The pizza is great and so are the salads, but most of all, we love that Frank treats us like family."}
{"text":"Horrible and Overpriced!!!!!!

The only reason I found myself in this establishment was the enticing advertisement featuring the scrumptious bursting at the seams Gyro for only $5.99 and they were the only eatery in the area without an obsene line.

On top of a puny little excuse for a Gyro that looked and tasted worse something from a fast food dollar menu I also received lackluster \"how dare you bother me\" service from a disinterested staff of four that didn't greet, bid farewell and barely acknowledged their customers 

Definately will not find myself back in this establishment again.  I do have to say that there were a couple families in there waiting for pizza's.   Maybe I should have ordered a pizza and stayed away from the Gyro?? 

CavEAT Emptor --  Let the buyer beware"}
{"text":"Very reasonable priced service was nice and friendly family oriented.  WiFi is free go on in and set up you can enjoy a meal and get work done at the same time."}
{"text":"For a simple Pizza joint this place is better than most.  The Old Fashioned Brick Oven is what brought us in to try it out.  The pizza was very good with plenty of options and the family run style restaurant made it feel very neighborly.  For families they have small flat screens at several of the booths and had cartoon movies playing while we we there.  Very family friendly.  We had the Itialian Sausage and Pepper large and speciffically asked for our pizza to be a bit more crispy than normal.  We got a great pie and the crispy was perfect.
We'll certianly be back again and looking forward to trying some Calzones."}
{"text":"We are here almost every week eating in or picking up.  They have great deals on facebook and online for their great pizza.  Have had our sons birthday party here for the last two years also.  The owner Frank is great and so personable.   Love how they have tvs also for the kids to watch if we want, or if we don't want them watching tv we can sit on the other side.  Was so glad when they took over Red Brick Pizza years ago.  Better sauce and cheese.  Come here often with other moms and kids as we know it is a win/win for all ages."}
{"text":"YAY for delicious and customized GLUTEN FREE (and casein free cheese options) pizza!!!! They have such wonderful selections of pizzas that can all be made GLUTEN FREE. Also, unlike the other places that offer GF pizza's, this place allows you to order a variety of sizes!!! Great coupons available on FB as well. I highly recommend them :) Just a hint for some GF people: we often have yeast allergies too (and may not know it), so be aware the crust contains yeast I believe. Overall: friendly staff, quick service and really tasty pizzas with a ton of options!!!!"}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst pizzas I have eaten.  We had a Groupon to try it out and pre-ordered 2 different pizzas online.  The pizza was ready when I got there but when I got home, which is only 10 minutes away,  it was already stone cold and the cheese was already solidified so that tells me the pizza was made way too soon and it was not kept warm.  We had to nuke it to re-heat it so it was like eating left overs.  They are very, very skimpy with the ingredients considering it is $2 extra for each ingredient and they added the mushrooms to the wrong pizza.  The crust was very chewy and tasteless as was the rest of the pizza.  The Groupon came with 2 vouchers and I wish I did not have a second one to use as I really do not want to go there again."}
{"text":"Not worth it $$$$ !!!

A sign posted on the walkway stating \"Best Gyro In Town\" led me into this establishment. First red flag was the young man behind the counter who took our order. Lose the attitude and at least try to act like you want to be there. It was like he was doing us a favor waiting on us. After ordering it took almost 30 minutes to get our food...and the place wasn't even 1/4 full with customers yet. Aside from the cashier, there was an older gentleman, I assume was doing all the prep and cooking and a young lady who worked the floor. She came by our table twice, with the same pizza asking, \"Did you order this?? \" I wonder if they ever found out? Our gyro sandwiches finally came.  Real gyros are cut fresh from a roasting spit. The meat looked like pre-fab frozen strips, heated up in a pan or maybe even microwaved. Terrible.

I hope they put more care into their pizza....though I 'm sure we won't be back to try.

I recommend loosing the 20+ television sets, hire some more help....good help and train them on basic \"common courtesy\" customer service. These places are a dime a dozen and if you can't get the basics down, word spreads and you're done. I give this place till the end of the year. Just my opinion....Good Luck."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice before... the pizza is not typical to what most are used to. It's thin and it's crustier than the thick fluffy crust of other pizza places. I assume this is to imitate \"real\" italian pizzas (which I have had the pleasure of having in Roma!)
However, the flavor is just \"meh\" and it's not very filling. The smaller than average serving size (and more than average pricing) could be forgiven if the food was flavorful, but it's just not there yet."}
{"text":"Great friendly service,  but it didn't make up for the tasteless food.  I got the hummus appetizer plate and a Margherita pizza. 
The hummus had no taste even though it had  pickles,  red onion and I think a slivers of red bell pepper.  The pita bread seemed very dried out..  I'm not sure if it was left out for a while,  but you'd get a better tasting pita bread from Costco. 
The pizza was utterly disappointing...  Yeah,  it's fired up in a brick oven yet the dough tasted bland.  They don't use fresh mozzarella cheese which ruined it.  They do sprinkle fresh basil and sliced tomatoes on top.  This has to be the worst Margherita pizza I've ever had. I only had one slice,  since that's all I could tolerate. 
I gave the place two stars since the service was friendly and the place had a good vibe to it,  but I'm not going back. ..   :("}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a try based on a GroupOn promotion. I ordered several pizzas, bread sticks, salads, gyros, subs, and calzones.  The pizzas were small in size (for a large and considering the price) and we ordered them loaded with different toppings and it seemed like they only put one of each topping on the pizzas. The crust was bland and tasteless (except for a burnt charcoal taste). I have to admit I have had better pizzas in cafeterias and from the grocery store than this. The salads were good and surprising the calzones tasted good as well. When I asked my wife how her Gyro tasted she replied \"it doesn't taste Greek\". If you are in the mood for great pizza then this is not the place to go."}
{"text":"We tried Francisco's last night for dinner. The Greek salad was AMAZING! Before we went, I about cried when I saw they have gluten free pizza and dairy free cheese! I was shocked when I found out they offer gluten free pizza in size small, medium or large. My boys and I are all gluten sensitive and my oldest is sensitive to whey. My oldest loved his pizza so much he said \"I want to take my children to this place!\" (he's 8 - LOL!). We'll definitely go back, can't wait for next time!"}
{"text":"My daughter had suggested we stop in here for dinner one night after her friends had told her it was \"good pizza\".  We ordered a pizza and some mozzarella sticks at the counter and had a seat.  After waiting a bit, we watched our mozzarella sticks get delivered to another table.  They quickly acknowledged their mistake but didn't bother to apologize.  Brought us another order fairly quickly... maybe too quickly as they weren't cooked all the way and were soggy and gross.  The pizza didn't fair much better.  I'm pretty sure everything is frozen not fresh. We left after only a few bites.  Not at all impressed and we won't be back."}
{"text":"The pizza it self is awesome curst and bread great flavor what's disappointing is that you 15 for a pizza id expect a little more ingredients it's like the workers there are moving in slow motion. Also I don't care but talking about your friends getting drunk in front of customers shouldn't be a convo you bring up when customers are standing 5 feet from you. Foods decent needs work and more pride in making it look presentable"}
{"text":"Had a groupon, gave it a try.  We are eating gluten-free, and on the plus side, they have all sizes of pizza in GF crust.  Unfortunately, the crust is very done around the edges, but doughy in the center.  Maybe their normal crust is more evenly cooked.  They are very stingy with toppings and sauce.  The tomato sauce was spread so thin we could hardly tell that it was on the pie and the pepperoni was near non-existent.  Our other selection was hamburger and onion and again, you had to look hard to even see the hamburger.

All in all, not impressed, and won't be back.  Domino's will do until we can find another \"local\" joint."}
{"text":"Crust was great! We tried the garlic chicken and ceasar salad. Got a great deal on groupon, $20 ea for 2 visits for $18! We'll come back even if we didn't have the 2nd visit. Love the crust! Salad, I can pass. Only had croutons, Parmesan and light dressing. 
Customer service was good and friendly, especially on a Sunday 7pm!"}
{"text":"Horrible pizza! How can they justify the high price they charge for less than mediocre food?  Pizza was bland, wet, and soggy. Service was not good either. I had a coupon which i forgot to mention when ordering but mentioned to them no more than 2 min after. They would not honor it. Now that's excellent customer service.   Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Apparently this place has closed. I went to go eat here and found that the place has closed. It was not my favorite place but it was an okay to place to eat and catch up with friends. Owner and staff were super friendly."}
{"text":"We ordered medium pizza , Italian sandwich and calzone and I was very disappointed . The pizza was very soggi and no taste and the Italian sandwich was pizza dough filled with lettuce tomatoes and meats do folded in half!?! I don't want to say it was bad but is was definitely not worse my money."}
{"text":"Had the 10\" pepperoni. Crust was perfectly crunchy and chewy at the same time and the sauce was flavorful and was overall one of the better pizzas I've had. Would've given five stars except that I'm not full; the pizzas are pretty thin and oily."}
{"text":"Had the beef pita, super good! I will definitly be having another gamer meeting here. Cant wait to try the pizza!"}
{"text":"Nice and clean place with an open kitchen and a nice flame brick oven.  I like the menu and decided to go for the Prosciutto Italiano Sandwich which was served with a house-made almost pita like bread that had a wonderful crisp to it. The flavor was very good and I would certainly order it again.  Unfortunately the sandwich was light on the main ingredient which was the Prosciutto.  If they had gone a little heavier on it I would have been sold but perhaps they need to raise the price a bit to work with such an expensive ingredient.  

The staff (possibly owner) was very friendly and reminded me of the folks back east who own family joints.  I will look to try the pizza next which cook quick in the hot oven and look quite good.  If they have good pizza I am happy to bump them up a star."}
{"text":"Found a new local spot! Its nestled next to a Starbucks and a Panda Express in the Gilbert Town Center south of the 202 on Gilbert road. I hope someone sees this review and ends up trying this place as a result because I found this place by accident. Glad that happened because now I make every effort I can to stop here on purpose. Its locally owned, and you can often see the owner interacting with the customers. This, I find, is a rare site in most places nowadays, where you are just a number to the business, or just another order to take. Not the case here.

When you walk up to the counter, you can see their claim to fame-the brick oven-in addition to the employees making the food right in front of you. I'm sure there are some of you that have seen \"Kitchen Nightmares\" and how unclean some food preparation areas are, but you would never see that here-with mostly everything in full view-and how clean the establishment is struck me as impressive and way above average. Its designed well with comfortable booth seating around the exterior, and there are plenty of tables in the middle. This is a great place to stop for a quick bite with a group of people on short notice with no reservation needed.

I really enjoy their pizza, especially their margarita style, and they have over 18 kinds, with their own unique flavors like, \"Pizza Rustica\" and \"Prosciutto, Mushrooms, and Arugula\". That last one might sound like it would hurt your wallet, but the prices are very fair here, and you can get a great value for spending a little over 7 bucks.

I had the pita today-since I was trying to eat healthier-and it was just as good as their pizza. They have fresh salad and sandwiches too, so there is plenty to keep you coming back for more. 

In summary, this place has great service, value, a varied menu, and a brick oven that churns out some pretty awesome pizzas. If you are out shopping in the east valley, or find yourself hungry on the 202, I'd strongly recommend you stop here. :)"}
{"text":"I'm late posting this...but at least I didn't forget! :) we got a groupon for this place and were pleasantly surprised by how good this was for the slammin deal groupon gave us! The owner/manager was awesome ! I recommend !"}
{"text":"Overall: Food is processed and tasteless. Veggies: over or under ripe. Pizza is expensive for size. The worst meal I've had in a very long time.

This place feels like a chain (though I'm not sure if it is) where they get bags of food off of a truck and then have it assembled and/or cooked by folks who don't know anything about cooking (no offense to the employees... as they just follow directions). I did not see any gyro rotisserie going and I didn't see any pizza dough be tossed... Only preformed crusts pulled from a pile... IDK, maybe somebody made them in the back, but they are not good either way. I'm not even sure if the oven is made of real bricks. It looks to have brick veneer on the outside. The whole place feels fake. Given that I had several different things from this place, I can't imagine it could ever taste good to anyone at anytime. I had no issue with any of the employees. They all seemed nice and hard working.

- Pizza: Small and light on ingredients for the $. Terrible all around. I'd rather eat a Totino's pizza from the freezer for $1.25. If you want good brick oven pizza, try Grimaldi's.
- Gyro: preformed/processed meat and old veggies. Pita bread was ok.
- Hummus: tasteless - the absolute worst I've ever had. Taste like just ground chickpeas.
- Greek Salad: brown lettuce, tomatoes not ripe, tasteless ham. Feta was ok"}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing and the customer service can't be beat! We work close to this place and it is truly the place of choice. Push over Subway, Chipotle and the rest, this place can't be beat, the food is absolutely delicious and the brick oven pizzas are amazing. Your like family when you come here hands down. Highly recommended. The food will leave you craving more"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our visits to this restaurant. I am very sad to see it has closed. Wishing the owners well in their future endeavors. Thanks for being so friendly and warm to customers!"}
{"text":"We ordered a pepperoni pizza and a chicken gyro. The gyro was pretty tasty, but the pizza crust had a consistency similar to plastic. I'm hoping I just had a bad batch because I can't imagine that others could actually like it. The owner was extremely nice and welcoming. I find it odd though that each booth has a personal tv. I would try a salad or another gyro, but I just can't forget about the horrible pizza."}
{"text":"Great chicken Bbq pizza.  Onion was sweet, bbq sauce was not overpowering, chicken was juicy and tender, cheese was really good. Had the chopped garden salad it was good but to many croutons for me. If come back and bring the grand kids. It's a good family restaurant, nice people, very friendly."}
{"text":"Groupon Now brought us in at 7:38. While it was before the 8 PM deadline, Groupon Now had ended. Instead of walking out, the owner said he would still give us the deal. Didn't happen. I realize that is a Groupon Now problem but knowing that is what brought us in you would think they would make something happen. Their menu and prices are higher in store then their own website. Good bait and switch. Dingy inside...lightbulbs out everywhere including right over booths, extension cords used to light signs. Multiple flavors on fountain out.

Positive note; salad and pizza were great except our particular pizza advertised fresh basil for which it didn't have. The bait and switch, alone, with higher in-store prices then their own website leaves a bad taste however and is enough for me not to go back. It's just a cheap money grab."}
{"text":"We had the best service, the best brick oven pizza and it was fast. I would recommend to anyone. The only concerns I had were the seats area was a little screwy. With low booths and high top tables it found my self staring at someone's backside. Also the TV menu board on the outside had horrible resolution and you could not read."}
{"text":"Wouldn't recommend. For a pizza lover like me, it's tough to go wrong with pizza. This pizza was horrible quality and the meat tasted like I was going to be sick if I consumed it. Unfortunate because this used to be a delicious place, but new management and suddenly it's in shambles. When I arrived multiple customers were complaining. I'd go somewhere else if I were you"}
{"text":"Great hummus and even better pita bread! i have been here several times and will keep coming back for 2 reasons- the food AND the customer service. Although I can only comment on the hummus since that is all I ever order. It's fresh and you get a lot of it.  It's obvious they make the hummus and pita right there. The owner has been there everytime I have been there (he must work everyday), and he has always provided excellent customer service.

I didn't go into this restaurant at first because I never liked Red Brick Pizza (which was what was there before), and I didn't realize it had changed it's menu sincee it looks pretty much the same. However, it's not a chain restaurant being run by teenagers!"}
{"text":"We recently returned after not having been here for some time. The owner was there and, as always, was so cheerful and charming.  

We ordered cheese bread for an appetizer, which was very tasty.  We also had two small pizzas with light sauce - one cheese and one with extra pepperoni which was truly extra, so  maybe the last time was just a fluke?  Both pizzas had the light sauce we requested, good crust and flavorful toppings.  We left with plenty of leftovers for another meal.

They have pretty good specials, like a small pizza with drink for $6.99 which is a great deal."}
{"text":"The Hawaiian pizza was good! The crust was perfectly crispy. The pineapple was good but it was too juicy so by the end of the pizza the crust was soggy. The Hawaiian pizza has cashews on top. I wasn't so sure about this but it worked overall! We order a small order of cheese sticks I don't recommend them at all... They were soggy and weren't hot. They were served with cold marinara sauce which made them even worse. Who wants a cold cheese sticks with a cold marinara sauce? The service was great! The pizza took a while so the owner came over, apologized and gave us an extra order of cheese sticks for free."}
{"text":"We used to eat here when it was a red brick pizza and thought it was good. We tried it today for the first time since they left the RB franchise and to my surprise, it was really grest! We had the Italian salad which was really yummy and fresh, and the pizza blanco, delish!! Also, the owner is super friendly and his workers give great customer service. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Clean, fast and helpful service, best pizza around. Enjoy I do. I eat there at lunch, but my kids want me to bring some home.

The owner waited on me and went above the level of service, you can tell he enjoys his job."}
{"text":"Omg the worst pizza and cannoli ever hard as a rock and no flavor never again. I don't understand how ppl like the hard cardboard pizza here."}
{"text":"Great pizza,  ordered the mozzarella sticks for my son and they were ok. Overall great meal and affordable."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good which is why I gave them more than one star. I placed my order online through Eat24. This order included 3 (three) bottles of IBC root beer. When the delivery girl showed up, she handed me three bottles of Coca-Cola and said they were out of root beer. I understand running out of an item. Poor planning happens to any business. What I don't understand is automatically assuming you know what's best and substituting whatever you feel like or have the most of. You had my contact details from the order. Use them. I don't drink coke (which is why i didn't buy it), so I gave one coke to the delivery girl, one to my coworker, and threw the other in the trash. Live and learn."}
{"text":"Great food! Great prices! And fabulous customer service! We will be back, for sure! They even have TV'S at each booth to keep kids entertained. Gelato looks amazing as well. The hubby says it's the freshest pizza in town, can't believe we waited so long to try."}
{"text":"Great place to take kids for pizza. They have individual tv screens at each booth to keep little ones entertained. I usually get four cheese or margarita pizza. Both are really good and remind me of New York pizza places. They also have Mediterranean salad and chicken shawarma which are great if you are not into pizza that much. Mediterranean salad has lots of fresh cut fruits and is always very crunchy. Great for low calories but very tasteful dish. Would definitely recommend it. Look out for deals on groupon for this place!!!"}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I stopped in on a Friday night and we will return.  Service was so friendly and fast.  We placed our order and sat in a booth.  We ordered a medium chopped Italian salad to start with.  It was good.  Big enough for 3-4 people to share.  We tried two small pizzas (Margarita & Roasted Garlic Chicken) and both were very good.  We like a nicely finished crust and the brick oven cooks this think crust just right.  The toppings were flavorful but not overpowering (there are a number of ingredients on the chicken pizza but my boyfriend said they were very complimentary to one another.  We signed up for their frequent diner club (can't remember what it's called) and we are well on our way to earning freebies.  

The only detracting item from our dining experience was the TV built into the booths.  I wish I had chosen to sit on the opposite side of the building (or even outside).  The table behind me had the volume on the cartoon/movie up so loud, it drowned out everything including my boyfriends conversation.  I'm not sure if the parents and two children at that table were hard of hearing but it was very distracting."}
{"text":"Really love the meat works pizza. Everything is fresh and usually good service. Definitely recommend this place if you are craving pizza."}
{"text":"Yummy! It was great, the pepperoni was delicious, owner was there super friendly and you can also get gelato there!"}
{"text":"This is the same store front as Red Brick Oven Pizza.  They didn't seem to change much.  We had a coupon so thought we would give them a try.

First, the decor.  For some reason they have TVs in every booth.  You can't change the channel, and the volume is at zero, but they're there.  No idea why (since you can't hear any dialogue).  Another large screen TV was set to a sports channel.  Again, no volume.  What one DID hear was random music (ranging from Elvis to Johnny Cash, etc).  Odd choice for music in a pizza place.

On to the pizza.  We ordered two (per the coupon).  One was a typical sausage, mushroom, pepperoni pizza.  It was good.  The crust seemed thin, but dense.  I'm sorta surprised it didn't rise to create a thicker, more airy crust.  But it didn't.  Very dense.  Flavor was good, though.

The other pizza was a prosciutto pizza (with arugula and something else).  It also was thin and dense but flavorful.

The pizza was fine.  But I can't really see coming back here when there's another pizza place closer to my house that is better.  Much better.  In fact, that other place has become my favorite of all the places in Chandler/Gilbert.  So Francisco's, while not bad, can't really compete with the other place.  Yes, even if I were shopping in this center I would get in my car and drive to San Tan Village to get the other pizza if I wanted pizza.  

You could do worse than Francisco's, but just a few miles east you can do much better."}
{"text":"Not sure the negative reviews on the Gyros mine was huge and fresh!  The pizza was tasty and had a good sauce to it and the hummus was made fresh in house."}
{"text":"They have really great gluten free pizza and delish salads. My husband isn't gluten free and ordered the shawarma and though it was good too. The TV's at the table allows is nice for the kiddos. I would have given it five stars if they served beer and wine. I think we will be regulars here. Oh, and I love how the owner is there to greet you. You don't see that very often these days."}
{"text":"Worst Pizza!  Frozen pizza actually tastes better.  The booths were torn and uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and it wasn't a good experience. The restaurant was nice and atmosphere was good but the food... not so great. Food was cold, even the marinara was cold, and there were toothpicks inside my calzone! One of them stuck me in the roof of my mouth! I complained to the guy in charge (Jesus?) and he just said \"that's how we hold the calzone together.\" Might want to warn people about that. I have eaten lots of calzones as an Italian growing up in New Jersey, never have I had toothpicks in a calzone or had it served with cold marinara sauce. Jesus didn't seem to care that I wasn't a happy customer. He just said sorry. Nothing more.

Follow up 12/18: Called the owner after we posted this review and he apologized for our bad experience and said he would call us back and take care of us. Never heard from him again."}
{"text":"They have TVs by every booth, but it was stuck on Disney Channel when we got there. The food wasn't spectacular. Our Greek Salad was like greens and canned olives, sprinkled with cheap cheese and that's it. Service was okay. (1 star) Place was clean (another star)."}
{"text":"Great pizzas. The owner is wonderful too. 

They used to have a bunch of middle Eastern/ Mediterranean snacks and pastries, but sadly, no more. They were great, too!

Yummmmmmmmmmmmmm!"}
{"text":"I have been here 2 X. Both were very good... Pizza tasted super and service was good as well. 
Very nice and casual environment... I would go back!!"}
{"text":"I would give the owner and the employees 4 stars for great attitudes and good customer service. However, the pizza is what the review is all about and I can only give 2 stars for the pizza's performance. One of the two pizza's wasn't correct but the owner took care of it immediately. Got us the right pizza pretty quickly & asked us to keep the incorrect pizza. Initially, he had also discounted the pizzas for us which was very exceptional as well. The only thing I didn't like about the pizza, all of them, was that the bottom was so burnt. Just not my bag. Maybe I will try them again another time but for now I will still be keeping my eyes out for a better pie"}
{"text":"Food seems to be decent when owner is there supervising, but when he's not there, things go down hill quickly.  Had pizza there recently and it was burned.  I wouldn't eat it and returned it and was told because it's \"brick oven\", it's supposed to be burnt.  Really?!  I don't think so.  They made me another one and it was so under-done that it was just mush with the topping on top being raw.  Won't be back and can't imagine this place staying in business much longer."}
{"text":"I have been a regular for over a year now and am well behind in leaving a proper, well earned positive review. Frank is as good as they get in the business. He is always welcoming, remembers me by name and greets me every time I walk in the door, not to mention a friendly goodbye looking forward to my next visit in. I love the wood fire pizza. The lunch special is just the right size for an individual serving. I am a plain meat and potatoes kind of guy, so pepperoni is my 'go-to' at each visit. Toss in a nice side garden salad with fountain soda, and life is good on that 1 hour reprieve from the daily grind. Thank you Frank for helping me getting my pizza fix when the craving calls!"}
{"text":"Service was fine-  place was fine but the pizza was okay. It's good pizza. It's just not the best we've ever had. I would expect more from a brick oven pizza place and the price that they charge."}
{"text":"Ordered the gluten-free Pizza Rustica. Toppings were bland, crust tasted like cardboard, and staff was unpleasant."}
{"text":"Tired this place for the first time and got delivery.  Was told it would be here within 35-45 minutes.  After an hour I decided to call, was told the delivery boy should be here any minute, then got a call from the driver saying he was lost?!? WTF, you have my address and would hope you have a GPS or would know where to go!  Come to find out the girl who took the order, wrote my address down wrong after asking me it twice! Called back and the manager said, just don't worry about it we will take care of you next time, I got you.  Told him I would like hot food tonight not this cold pizza that I have, okay then I will cancel your order and hung up ? This place has awful customer service, mind you that was the owner!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for lunch today to try this place out! We are huge pizza lovers!! My husband is from New York & is very picky about his pizza but to our surprise this place was incredible!! Definitely our new local place!!  Highly recommend trying it!!!"}
{"text":"We had dinner here tonight hoping for some good brick oven pizza .... Well, the pizza was ok but if you have ever had brick oven pizza then you know that's not what you are being served . The pizza wasn't even hot - if 2 kiddos can pick up and eat their pizza as soon as it arrives , that should tell you it arrived room temperature at best . The saving grace tonight was the hummus . That was so fresh, tasty and dirt cheap!! ($5 for a medium) we tried a total of 4 pizzas 
Pepperoni, BBQ chicken, buffalo chicken & garlic chicken .quality wise I would compare it to Peter piper pizza .  You serve yourself , there is no table service.. And you bus your own table"}
{"text":"I have been to Francisco's twice now. Once when they first opened quite awhile ago and again tonight. The first time I ate here I was on my way to class over at CGCC and needed a quick meal on the go. I had one of their ham and cheese flatbread sandwich type of thing. It was good, it stood out in mind enough to come back many months later.

Tonight my fiancé and I tried one of their pizza's. There was no one in the restaurant at 5:30pm which was a little concerning. The young man who took our order behind the counter was very nice and gave us a few suggestions off of the menu. I asked if we could create our own combo since it wasn't on the menu and he was very accommodating. We ended up with a pepperoni and jalapeno medium pizza. It came out about 15 minutes later. The crust is on the thinner side, the sauce has a good flavor. The crust was a little burned on one side but not burned on the other. The medium is not very filling between two people, I would suggest the large. The prices are a little high for what you get. We paid $17 for a medium pizza and two drinks. This is a no frills pizza shop, the parmesan and red pepper comes in little packets even if you are dining in which is fine but just know that is what you are going to get.

Overall this pizza shop is just okay. If I am craving pizza and I am in the area I might consider going here again. The sandwich/ flatbreads are pretty good as well. Might be back."}
{"text":"I had a great small pizza for lunch. Love the crust. The person I was with got a sub and thought it was excellent. Met the owner a very nice hard working man. Not the cheapest food but good quality and flavor. I will be back."}
{"text":"They have a varied menu including gyros, cheese steak sandwiches, salads, hero sandwiches, and of course pizza.  They messed up our order a little bit (forgot our salad until after the pizza was served.) However they gave us free calzones to make up for it.  Calzones were very good!"}
{"text":"Seating for a family at this restaurant is less than ideal. The booths only comfortably seat 2 and the addition of a third person, even a child, makes for cramped quarters. While the restaurant is clean, well kept and in a great location; the food is about what you would expect for the price but it's defiantly not a family dining location."}
{"text":"This place was just fine, on the closer edge of 'pretty good'. I'm giving it four stars, mostly because all of the one-two star ratings were written by idiots who should never have learned to use a keyboard in the first place. Seriously, anyone who calls this place 'overpriced' needs to reevaluate their financial decisions in life. I'm sorry, but someone who works at McDonalds really shouldn't have equal access to a culinary opinion as someone like me, who regularly eats diamonds just to make his dookie twinkle. 

I ordered some delivery from here last night and it was promptly delivered by an upstanding gentleman. The pizza was good. It wasn't anything special, and I won't inundate you with adjectives, but the veggies were fresh, the meats tasty, the sauce satisfied and the dough was delicious. The babghanoush was acceptable, though I like mine a line chunkier (they puree it... which is fine, but not my favorite way of preparing it).

People talk a LOT about the gyros here. Most of the people who talk a lot about the gyros should talk less, because... they're idiots. The gyros are fine. The meat is fine. It's a step up from mall-quality gyros, but it's a far cry from freshly-broiled lamb meat roasted to order. But honestly what are you expecting??? If you just want a tasty gyro delivered to your casa, then you could do a LOT worse than this place. If you're expecting gourmet free-ranged beer-rubbed grass-fed mountain-bred salad-tossed hipster lamb, then why the fuck are you ordering delivery food in the first place, you self-important douchepickle?

SO there you have it. Now raise up off me, I have better things to do than listen to your whining."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Great lunch special for pizza and a drink for $5.  Go there all the time and the owner is extremely pleasant."}
{"text":"We're new to the area and looking for a late lunch and came across Francisco's and thought we'd give it a try.   We each had the $6.99 special which is a small 1 item pizza and drink and we shared a chopped garden salad and I'd have to say it's awesome!   Very impressed with the brick pizza.  We'll definitely be back and try something new like the made to order calzones.   Nice service too!"}
{"text":"Love the chicken hummus plate! The owner/head chef(?) is super friendly as well and makes a regular appearance at the register. Also you can substitute the pita bread with vegetables for no extra cost which is awesome. The pizza isn't quite as good as Mod's in Gilbert but its decent."}
{"text":"Had dinner with the hubby here tonight and it was a decent place for pizza .... Not so fabulous with the customer service/ambiance. We ordered salads and pepperoni pizza. Nothing hard and both pretty good however it's important to note that you order at the counter, bus your own tables and eat with plastic and paper table settings. There were two staff members behind the counter and they were very uninterested in being there in my opinion. Not rude but obviously wishing to be anywhere else other then where they were lol. We ate quickly and left with full tummies but just underwhelmed with the while experience. Doubt we will be back for dining in however might be good for takeout."}
{"text":"First time eating here. Nice mom & pop place and very affordable. Hubby & I had the calzones. Meatball for me and meat works for him. His was actually better. Crust was good, good size portions. Felt full after we left. A good neighborhood pizza parlor. Staff is friendly and fast."}
{"text":"I like the food and the service. Have been at Francisco's twice and have had a wonderful salad and pizza. The itallian chop salad is very good and so is the roasted garlic chicken pizza.
The owner is friendly and makes you feel welcome and appreciated.
I will be back"}
{"text":"Hummas plate is pretty good, tried a small pizza wasn't impressed, but I would try it out again."}
{"text":"I tried this place as it replaced the old Red Brick Pizza that was there. The inside is pretty much the same as it was as Red Brick. The owner was nice and greeted us and said goodbye at the end. The televisions had a Ratatouille Disney DVD playing and when that finished they put on the old Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Didn't care for the shows but I wasn't there to watch television anyway. They were out of drink cup covers so I asked for some and the kid brings them out and takes his bare hands and grabs out two of them. I would have rather he have gloves and place them in the holder so I can grab my own without his touching them or at least would dig down into the center to avoid the ones he did touch.

However, the pizza wasn't good. As much as I like cheese on my Four Cheese pizza, there was too much cheese, soggy crust, and burnt edges. Could barely get a slice apart and when I did manage to cut it apart and picked up a slice, the cheese just slide right off into the pan. I ended up with a pile of cheese and the pizza wasn't tasty at all. My friend got a barbecue chicken pizza and it didn't taste like it as she used to get that at Red Brick just like I always got my Four Cheese. The Red Brick pizza was awesome and the cheese at least stayed on the slices. As much as I wanted to like this place since I hoped it was like the old Red Brick, this pizza wasn't any good. We won't be going back there."}
{"text":"This is a great little pizza place. Groupon brought us in and we were immediately greeted by the owner and very friendly staff. We ordered the pepperoni pizza, pizza bianco and Italian salad. All really good. Francisco's is more of a casual, quick, order-at-the-counter type of place but with enough room to bring your family for dinner. Great pizza, fast service and close to home. I am happy we found this place and we will definitely be going back. Next time we will try the gyros!"}
{"text":"just.... wow. okay. so this place is ridiculously delicious. the pizza is absolutely mouth watering. I have used this place once or twice for delivery as it is really close to my work. Normally, I get superior service and excellent food. Today, however, was totally different. 
So my co-worker calls up Francisco's to order a pizza for delivery. He was abruptly told \"we don't deliver\" and got hung up on. I called them back, and told the very rude chick on the phone that I wanted to place an order for delivery. she scoffed and before she could say anything further, I stated \"I got a pizza delivered from you to my store last week.\" she sighed, very annoyed, and put me on hold. When she got back on the line, she said, \"okay, fine. what do you want?\" I was half tempted to tell her nevermind, but as the order was for my coworker, I told her his order. She then said \"yeah okay,\" and hung up on me before even telling me how much the order was. 
....seriously? this is one of the absolute WORST customer service experiences I have ever had. Thanks to whomever I spoke with, Francisco's got knocked down a few pegs."}
