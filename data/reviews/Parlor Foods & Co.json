{"text":"Went for pre dinner drinks and appetizer and was greatly disappointed. The cheese board and champagne we ordered was undersized and overpriced. Our order of wine was also forgotten to be delivered. We did NOT stay for dinner."}
{"text":"Really liked everything about this restaurant. Good atmosphere, food was yum, easy to get to, good groups. When I booked my reservation someone called me back to ask if it was my birthday (it was!) and if I wanted free dessert (I did!). Heads up though the portion on the short ribs was a bit small and ice cream sandwich uses hard cookies not soft ones."}
{"text":"We went to Parlor Foods on a Thursday night, were there for dinner and theatre.  The restaurant ambiance is warm, a bit dark but cosy and expertly chic (take note of the coffee bags on the ceiling).  We shared the charcuterie platter with extra in house fresh baked bread with tapenade...so good.  I had the pork chop,overdone to my tastes and my friend had the fois gras and blood sausage... outstanding!  Will return again when the construction dies down in Toronto.  Fairly new on the King St. scene, but definitely a keeper. Would recommend this restaurant to others."}
{"text":"The food was fabulous!  Went for Easter Sunday brunch - had the \"Better than Advil\" Scrapple hash with house made bacon, sumac aioli (YUM!!) potato rosti and onion tots. Best brunch ever! Oh and a little chocolate pot au creme with orange cream and raspberry coulis. You know, just to fill in the last little corner.  Very comfy, homey ambience, friendly, efficient service and refreshingly eclectic music selections.  Definitely will be back to try out the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Amazing service!! Our server, Emma, was the best! She took time to explain the menu and made great recommendations for us. The cocktails are great here, and food did not fall short of expectations. The charcuterie plate was delicious, as were the fries& special dipping sauce! There was a very large group right behind our table, so a little loud that particular day, but I was told that it wasn't normally THAT loud. Regardless, friends and I had an amazing time with Emma constantly checking up on us. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful anniversary dinner. The waiter was incredibly nice, and the food was wonderful (I had the Po Boy and my wife had the burger). Dessert was also fantastic. I highly recommended Parlor."}
{"text":"We went here before Second City- great service and the food was amazing. We had the winter greens, beef short rib, and pickerel. Great Canadian wine selection as well."}
{"text":"Came in for a coffee to wait for a show to start. Environment is certainly very nice, wood themed and smells like wood smoke.  We ordered a \"selection of Canadian cheeses\" which is meant to come with a \"smoked maple syrup\"  and bannock. Sounds good right? Unfortunately, the cheeses were not Canadian. First one described was a \"Danish blue\". These were a selection alright - of run of the mill grocery store brand cheeses with grocery store \"bannock\"and the tiniest drip of what I presume was smoked maple syrup but there wasn't enough to really get a taste. Coffee was bad. Didn't eat a main so I can't comment but if it's anything like their  cheese plate I'm sure you've seen it all already in aisle 3, for a lot less $."}
{"text":"April 2015. After a film at the Hotdocs, we wanted to have a nice casual dinner. We found Parlor Foods on our mobile app. Nice overall, would love to come back to spend more time with drinks and more food. 

Venue: Very interesting entrance. Interior nice and comfortable with some interesting pieces of furniture. 8/10

Food: Frites and Sauce -- portion was generous. The homemade sauce was good. To me, it's like mayo and mustard together but I really don't know what exactly the sauce was made of. Regardless, it was good. For mains, I had the Seafood Linguini. Presentation was very nice. Taste was light. The seafood (fried oyster, fried smelts, octopus) gave good flavours. Portion was suitable (not too small but not big). I tried a bit of my partner's pork. I loved it as I found the meat was cooked perfectly and the sauce was not strong. It worked very well for me. My partner found it bland. Different taste preference? 8/10

Service: Very friendly staff especially the gentleman who greeted us and brought us to the table. It's wonderful to feel welcome when you step into a restaurant. Our server was also very nice. She took time to answer our questions (e.g. the name and concept of the restaurant) and told us the special of the evening. 9/10

Overall: I would love to go back and try more dishes. After reading others' reviews, I want to try the Charcuterie board and some fancy cocktails."}
{"text":"Charged us for tap water!

They encourage sharing meals among people but then serve tiny portions for a high price. Our server indicated a calamari dish was for 2 and certainly carried the price of a multi-portion dish, but was only half of a plate. The food was great and the place is very pretty inside, but not worth the price. Charging for tap water is a petty trick."}
{"text":"Good food, service a little on the slow side. The food was fresh and tasty.
Nice creativity on the presentation side. Excellent wine list."}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant on a strip of so-so restaurants. had the Shishto Poppers to start - Jalepeno poppers for adults, damn good, with a bit of an Indian infused kick. followed this by the Po-Boy  - Catch of the day (Seabream) with house salsa, spiced avocado aioli, crispy herbs, pickled onions, all between two in-house buttermilk buns everything was very good and very unique! 

A++++"}
{"text":"I don't understand these positive reviews. The decor was cute, but the service and food were very sub par, especially in light of the prices. We waited a very long time just to get a menu. The scallops were almost $30 and were a small portion and unexceptional in every way. I saw people around us complaining about their food and sending dishes back. I can't believe how much money I just spent at this place."}
{"text":"The short rib here is unbelievable. Great atmosphere and delicious food, a nice place to go out for some casual fine dining"}
{"text":"We came here for dinner as part of a bachelorette party. We chose this restaurant mostly for its proximity to the entertainment district. It's pretty conveniently located and highly accessible by public transit.

We were pretty worried as the restaurant didn't seem busy for a Saturday night. We were able to change our reservations last minute from 7pm to 8pm for a party of 7. The restaurant was maybe half full that night and it's a pretty small space.

The website looked kinda crappy but the restaurant was a lot nicer than I had expected. I really liked the ambiance - very cozy, but modern. Like a fancy lodge.

We ordered a bunch of cocktails and they were all really strong - we had to get some ice to water it down. We're a bunch of lightweights, but it's good to know we were getting our money's worth of booze!

We were feeling unadventurous that night and ordered several orders of frites and shishito poppers to share. They were pretty good, but you would have to try really hard to make something deep fried not delicious! I ordered the special of the day - sea bream with a side of roasted root vegetables. It was very simply prepared. I personally prefer food with sauce or a variety of flavours (read: I like my food pretty with a side of pretension) so I didn't love it, but I can see how others would have enjoyed my plate. The other girls in the party ordered scallops, the parlor fritto, and the horse and bones and they seemed to really enjoy their food.

We ended the meal with the moose knuckle to share - which was essentially a beaver tail. Nothing too exciting, we could have gone without it - probably my least favourite thing that evening.

Service was fantastic. Our server was super friendly and helpful, offered to help us take pictures throughout the night, and was readily available to provide whatever it was we needed. 

Was pretty content with the food and experience and would likely return."}
{"text":"Dropped in to Parlor as Montecito was hosting an event. Couldn't be happier! The entrance is my favourite and really sets the tone well. 

It's cozy and Canadiana without being too kitschy. Finally a place proud of being Canadian. Torontos been definitely missing a place like this. 

I love their beer and wine selection which is proudly local and some tasty picks. The all local selections makes me so so happy, especially the wine!!!! 

I came for lunch but will have to come back for dinner and for sure for brunch. 

They are specials daily and I can't wait to bring some friends here. Fries were delish and had their daily egg special which hit the spot perfectly. 

I can't wait to go back for more."}
{"text":"Don't eat here! The service was terrible, the waitress mixed up our drinks, forgot to put in an order of appetizers, then when she was reminded, put in the wrong quantity so we were out one appetizer, then she mixed up our tea order and forgot to have them put a candle in my friend's birthday dessert. When they finally remembered, the hostess came to the table and asked out loud whose birthday it was and they proceeded to give us the exact same dessert we had just ordered and then lit the candle in front of us. So awkward for my friend as she is watching them do this. The waitress never once apologized or offered to comp anything, it's a shame because the food is actually decent but I would never come back here."}
{"text":"Made a last minute reservation for dinner on a Saturday night after watching a movie nearby. 

Environment of the restaurant was warm and inviting, when you first walk in, you notice a musky, wood burning smell. 

I ordered the Burger with frites, cooked medium well. The burger was average but the parlor sauce that the fries came with was unique. 

My friend ordered Horses & Bones and we all agreed that the potato crisps that came with the marrow was too oily and salty, which took away from the bone marrow itself. 

My other friend wanted a poutine but didn't see it on the menu, after asking the server, we were able to get the poutine. The server explained that poutine is on their late night menu and as long as the kitchen had the ingredients to make it, we would still be able to order it. The poutine however was a bit too salty for our liking.

Overall, I would recommend this place to those who want to try something new and adventurous. The menu has several items that are made for sharing so this may be a good place to try with a small group."}
{"text":"This is a great addition to king west. Interior is a great design with logs and candles. Also when you enter you have a wonderful aroma of pine. Food was delicious, drinks a little pricey but typical of king west pricing. 4 dollar whiskey shots on special every night which is a great deal and almost unheard of at most locales on king w. Waitress we had was very fun and conversational. Winterlicious menue they are doing is a good deal for portion size you get."}
{"text":"This place rules!! Went with a big party of 7 and everything was perfect! Our waitress killed it, the cocktails are superb, the food delicious...all fresh and made in-house, not canned/frozen! Jason and Mari the owners were super great hosts and welcomed us warmly. We had a lot of food and it was ALL good with no exceptions: sweatbreads, horse tartare, house made panzerotti, market fish, charcuterie board, street meat, flank steak, beef short rib Etc! The Canadiana decor is worth the look alone. Great bar area and overall a much nicer spot than most of the rest on restaurant row...feels more like Ossington than King west. Highly recommended and we will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Pretty forgettable food, but my friend and I didn't order the popular choices (Horse & Bones, Street Meat or the Burger). The service is enthusiastic and the setting is nice and relaxed considering it's in this \"out to impress\" area. It would be a fine option, particularly in the wintertime, for a cozy chat and drink. Decent music playing in the background."}
{"text":"Like, like, like this spot. Friendly bar, good cozy patio. The wings are awesome. Not the norm with  a chicken, duck and turkey combo. The hot sauce is HOT, try a hit of hot with the honey garlic to tone it down. Oyster special is average and the wine on tap is a good house option. Also a good last call option on the way home."}
{"text":"I'm trying not to hand out 5's too freely lately, but the excellent customer service really pushed it over the top.
My wife and I had less than a half hour to eat before catching a show, and we asked if it was possible. Our host showed us which items should come out quickly, and rather than making empty promises - our server and then the kitchen ensured we ordered and had our food in less than 15 minutes.
We were thinking appies anyway. The poppers were a unique take with a tempura batter, but it really worked. The cumin/curry dip may not have been my first choice however. The turkey wings with a mustard/maple sauce were delicious. In case it isn't obvious, turkey wings are massive as an FYI. The blue cheese dip they came with was INCREDIBLE. Genuine blue cheese base and the only mistake was not asking for more of it. We also had the frites which were pretty good and a massive portion.
A pretty limited taste of the menu so far, but as it stands: the food is somewhere between a 4-5 and our service was an easy 5. Will be back."}
{"text":"Holy samolians. Stop reading this and just go to Parlor now. 

We wandered in off the street because they had a charcuterie board and that's what we were craving. According to our (very knowledgeable, helpful and attentive) waitress, the meats on the board were made in house! This place focuses on local, house-made food, which is something I can definitely get behind. 

We ordered the Garden Fresh Salad, the Charcuterie Board, bread and tapenade and the Street Meat. 

The salad was fresh and delicious, with a yummy spicy mayo and lime and cider vinaigrette. It was the perfect start to our meal.

Next came the Charcuterie. This is where things got really interesting. The bread is baked in-house (the baker also makes the desserts and ice cream). It was potato focaccia, and toasted to perfection. Every piece of cured meat on the board was delectable, but the duck stood out to me the most. Honey and spicy mustard complimented the meats.

The tapenade... okay I don't even like tapenade but when we ran out of bread I ended up eating this off of my fork. It's garlicy and olivey and creamy and extraordinary.

The only thing I was wary about was the street meat. It sounded amazing, the buns being made in house, as well as the sausage. But $18 for 2 sausages? Yeah. 10/10 would pay for again. The spring slaw, pickles and jalapeno perfectly complimented the richness of the sausage and the buttermilk bun totally held up. Yum! 

We also ordered a cask beer, and any bar/resto that has cask beer is a winner in my eyes. 

I can't wait to try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Got the fries, oysters, calamari, street meat and beet salad to share. Beet salad was good but calamari and street meat kind sucks. The meat was really dry."}
{"text":"Had the summerlicious lunch menu here (and shared halvsies with a friend, so got to try two of each course!)

This is what we tried:

Appetizer
- Salad: Had a really nice dressing, and the cherry tomatoes were super tasty
- Plowmen's Platter: four slices of salami, pickled veggies, tapenade, and three slices of toast. Everything was really good, especially the tapenade (it wasn't too salty - yay!)

Main
Fish and chips: delightful. The fish was done just right, and the fries were yummy (skinny fries!). Highlight was the orange coloured dip. Tartar sauce was ok.
Smoked chicken sandwich: i was expecting a sandwich-looking dish based on the name. But it looks more like a burger. This was SO GOOD. It really hit the spot. Bread wasn't too bready or dense. Smoked chicken and peameal bacon were so tender. Everything came together really well in this sandwich.

Dessert
Cookies: the choc chip one was good, the other one had too many choc chips
Strawberry sorbet: was pretty meh
Some friends ordered dif ice cream flavours. Whiskey one was strong (could def taste the whiskey in there). Toasted marshmallow was good but didn't really taste like toasted marshallow to me.

All in all, great atmosphere and great food. Summerlicious was also a great deal ($23 for three courses)"}
{"text":"Parlor Foods offered the best hamburger I've ever had in my life-- and I've had a lot of great hamburgers. Juicy but not greasy, seasoned but not over salted, perfectly medium-rare, and all-around delicious."}
{"text":"Have to say it was a big surpise coming here. It was a last min decision and im glad we came. The food was great and the servers were nice. The dishes were different yet as you would expected it. The horse tartar was just amazing! Well come back and try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Pleasant waitress, but not enough to compensate for   spending $19.21 on runny scrambled eggs, streaky bacon, diced potatoes, toast and coffee. This would be the equivalent to a Denny's Grand Slam Breakfast, in the States. The coup de grace was being the first to sit in an empty restaurant, then seeing the next three customers receive their burger orders, while waiting 20 minutes for mine."}
{"text":"From the food, to the wine, to the service... Absolutely incredible! Brad and Emma ensured we felt as comfortable in the restaurant as we could at home. The flavours and textures were undeniably fantastic. Thank you @ParlorFoods for an amazing anniversary meal! Thank you and we will be back soon!"}
{"text":"The food is subpar and over priced - terrible portion and the menu doesn't accurately represent the food that arises. The ambience is ok, but nothing special compared to other places in Toronto."}
{"text":"The oysters here were delicious. For main meals I got the short ribs and my hubby got bacon/sausage panzerotti. The short ribs were tender but could have used a bit more flavour. Also, the white chocolate sauce on the bottom was a bit too sweet. The panzerotti was very tasty.

All in all I would go back since the ambience and service was excellent, and I do want to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"I ordered The Burger and it was pretty good. The fries were good too. They have a small selection of local beers. The staff is friendly and patient.
My friend ordered a salad which seemed too expensive for what it was, but looked yummy nonetheless."}
{"text":"This place was a bit of a disappointment - both the food and the customer service. We made a reservation and arrived on time. We were ignored by 4 staff who all noted our arrival but didn't greet nor help us but continued rushing by. Our table wasn't ready so we waited a few minutes to have it set up. We weren't that bothered because it was late on a Saturday night so a busy restaurant was expected. It took quite a while before we were given any water or for our orders to be taken but eventually we ordered. We got fries to start (delicious!) but waited 45 minutes for them to arrive (and only after we asked about the wait on them, I think our server forgot about us :( ). Our server was really apologetic and got our meals rushed so we didn't wait long to get our mains. I got the winter salad - the sashimi salmon on it was great but the greens were slathered in dressing and I didn't really care for the sourness of the dressing. My date got the beer can chicken - it was really moist but the flavour of it wasn't great. Wouldn't come back here!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times in the last month :) 

Looking through my bookmarks on yelp for a place to take my best friend's parents for a nice dinner I picked Parlor Foods because I wanted to try the horse and bones. My dining guests love food as much as I do so I really wanted to pick something special for them. 

I made reservations, although it wasn't necessary for 8pm on a Friday night for 4 of us. Upon arriving first among my party, the hostess asked to take my jacket which was nice. The menu is on paper tied with a piece of yarn and also written in chalk on the walls. I loved the long communal table in the middle of the back room with more bar seating in the front. The wood/log theme through out the restaurant created a nice atmosphere. They had a charging station ^_^ 

The service was great, they went through  the menu with us and we ordered different menu items through out the 3 hour meal and the servers were great with that. 

We tried the shishito poppers, they weren't spicy for me but the flavors of sweet and cheesy worked well. The charcuterie board was so delicious, the meats were all prepared in house and our server explained each one to us. Hands down the duck proscuitto wins... we would have all fought over the last piece if I didn't take one for the team and picked it up :)
The oysters were fresh, but they only had one variety. The cheeseboard was pretty okay but the meat board definitely takes the cake on this one. The bread was basic, I probably wouldn't get it again. The salad was a great size and lots of different elements to it that worked well.

NOW to the real story!!!

Horse and Bones (Horse tartare and Bone Marrow) We were all apprehensive about trying it, but being the standout item on the menu we decided to jump in. It was delicious, I'm personally a marrow lover and it really hit the spot. Everyone else was also surprised by the taste and within 5 minutes those crispy potato chips were dips and devoured. 

Their ice cream cookie sandwich hit the spot nicely for a sweet finish.

On another visit for my best friend's Bachlorette, Jason called me ahead of time to confirm and after finding out it was a Bachlorette mentioned they always do something special for the bride to be. True to their word at the end of our amazing meal a large delicious dessert was brought out with Congratulations in beautiful chocolate writing :)

Tried the beer can chicken this time and it was delicious! Moist and the flavor packed a punch!

Saved the best for last... their maple smoked manhattan!!!! The glass is still warm when i pick it up for my first sip. The smokey flavor stays on the tip of my tongue for seconds after! I love watching them smoke it behind the bar.

Overall I'd come back (and I have several times) and wouldn't think twice of holding a special event here! Parking is a little bit difficult as is all of downtown, just go west of Spadina and then walk backwards!"}
{"text":"Love trying new restaurants that feature seasonal ingredients and local favourites so this seemed like a good choice for a casual Friday evening. 

A relatively new addition to the king west restaurant scene, I was able to book a same day reservation which could be hard to come by in the downtown core these days.

- Big wings ($16): and they mean BIG. These are giant turkey wings and you will get 2 with your order. We got the maple rye and mustard sauce which was quite tasty and I enjoyed. But something a bit off to me to eat wings the size of your face.. Definitely something different though.

- Charcuterie ($19): their in house cured meats. The prosciutto was really delicious - Perfect saltiness and fatty layer that melts in your mouth.  The crunchy toasted warm bread and the homemade mustard was a winning combo. 

- White bean & root vegetable ragout ($19): perhaps my least favourite of the night. Sounded very hearty and appealing but the white beans weren't cooked well enough so they were quite hard and the tomato and onion ragout was a bit too sweet. 

- Braised short ribs ($26): Just okay.. The ribs were tender but not the melt in your mouth and it lacked memorable flavours. 

Overall the staff was really welcoming and attentive throughout our meal and was really helpful with the menu. Maybe we just didn't order the best items on the menu but I left feeling like my palate could be more inspired."}
{"text":"The food here is spot on, and the atmosphere is great. Very friendly staff without any of the somewhat pretentious King West attitude that you can encounter in similar places. 

The real gem here is the mixologist named Alana. 

She is one of the best cocktail producers in the city and is excellent at explaining her creations to people like me who are less experienced in the cocktail world. 

I would have given it six stars, but five was the most available."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night. Initially we only wanted a light dinner but got enticed to do the Summerlicious dinner menu. The waitress explained that the restaurant serves Canadian inspired dishes, where most of the menu is made in-house (the meats are cured in the restaurant and the ice cream is also made by the chef). 

Appetizer - We both went for the Charcuterie board (couldn't resist after she explained the meats are cured in-house!) The board had a nice Canadian touch, with drops of maple syrup on the side of the board. All the cured meats were great, although the bread as slightly hard.

Entree - I got the Market Fresh Fish entree, which was served with fried crab cakes and calamari. I was not a big fan of the crab cakes and calamari, I felt that the heavy fried sides took away from the fresh fish flavours. Overall the presentation of the entree was beautiful. 

Dessert - After boasting that the ice cream was made in-house, we had to try it. I got the Whiskey flavoured ice cream, which had such a strong whiskey flavour that I felt like I was drinking whiskey with milk! The ice cream even had an after taste of whiskey. My friend ordered the Toasted Marshmellow ice cream, which seemed to taste like chocolate. Overall, I enjoyed the fact that the ice cream was prepared in house. 

For a weekend night, I was also surprised that the restaurant was relatively empty. As a tip, the patio is very small and tightly packed, so if you prefer more space I would recommend inside seating. I would definitely try Parlor again for their local flavours!"}
{"text":"Wandering around on King St W one day me and a fellow Yelper wanted to find a place where we could find a bite to eat before the game (Blue Jays game).  We came across this place - neither of us had been here before and it didn't look too busy so we decided to try it out.  I'm glad we took the chance b/c I was pleasantly surprised.

It has the rustic at home, kinda a local bar with hints of a trendy restaurant vibe.  We ordered the calamari, the bone marrow and horse tartare with garlic chips and the oysters (it was 1/2 price that day for oysters).

The calamari was breaded and in whole pieces - not pre-cut up like some restaurants do.  It was slightly soggy but I think b/c it was sitting in the plate with the sauce on it.  But it had a nice bit to it - not too chewy and not too heavily breaded.

Now, the main star - the marrow and horse tartare - oh my - this is a dish of pure deliciousness.  The chips are used to scoop up the tartare and marrow and just provides a lovely and fresh morsel.  We literally wanted to scoop out every last piece.  I'd definitely order this again.  

The oysters were nice - not the supreme freshest tasting but I didn't think they would be.  For about $1.50 an oyster I am not going to complain.

Service was on point from when we entered to throughout the entire meal - pleasant, checking in on us and providing the bill in a timely manner.  

I'm curious to try some other items on their menu as it seems to be more unique than the typical downtown fare.  A little pricey but fits right in with the King W crowd."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service, couldn't eat there even though I wanted to and tried to go!

I called two weeks ago to make a lunch reservation. The lady on the phone had to double check if they do lunch, but confirmed that yes they do, so took the reservation. 

Called again a week ago to move the reservation earlier, but the guy on the phone couldn't find the reservation I've made. He apologized, then took my reservation again with the help of some other staff (he didn't know how to operate the reservation system, it seems).

Then today, my friend and I went at the reservation time (11:45), and they were not open! Someone (I think it's Brett? From pics on the website) came out to say they only did lunch during summerlicious, and was surprised to find that I was able to make reservations with their staff on the phone. Apparently they only open at 5pm now. 

Seriously, how unorganized do you have to be for your staff to 1) not know when you are open, 2) confirm a wrong opening time, and 3) can't make reservations properly??? Twice too!!
At least you could've called me earlier to clarify, so I don't need to find out when I've already made my way to the restaurant. 
And please update your hours both on your walls and on the website, I highly doubt you only open at 11:30pm on weekdays. 

Really not happy with how things went down. I had been wanting to try their food, but this basically ruined it for me. Will not try again."}
{"text":"Good location and friendly staff. The oysters are really simple and delicious. The Hot and Honey Turkey Wings were meaty and flavorful!"}
{"text":"The service and food were both excellent. I liked the casual and homey vibe of the decor. 

We were visiting from NYC and wanted a late brunch on a Sunday after a late night. The burger and Fish & Chips were both really perfect. I also enjoyed the pickle plate.

The Bloody Caesar was probably the best Bloody cocktail I've ever encountered. Perfection!"}
{"text":"They have a nice patio outfront. I ate inside and it has a cute Canadian hipster feel to it. I got the vegetable composition (white bean, chick pea & wild rice fritter, sauteed spring vegetables, wild leek pesto, taro root crisps) and some fries. The vegetable composition was pretty filling. I really liked the taro root crisps, tasted kind of like eating chips."}
{"text":"What a great find in the heart of downtown pretentiousness! Sophisticated food in a certain comfort level. Chef Buddah and his staff cure their own meats, so duck procuttio with a maple syrup dip along with an entire of horse bone marrow followed by whiskey I've cream gives me the impression that a restaurant downtown is finally giving me what I want that's both delicious and comforting, rather than telling me what I should like. Love it, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Restaurant had a warm ambiance, very rustic with a musky, wood burning smell. Service was quite attentive as well! 

-Charcuterie Board (selection of in house cured meats) - $19
I don't recall the exact items on the board, but I believe there were duck prosciutto, N'Djua, prosciutto, Cotechino (?) and salami. The duck prosciutto stood out to me the most. I didn't like the cotechino (?) as it was quite bland and the texture was a bit too soft for my liking. 

-Big Wings - $16
These turkey wings were.. well, BIG! The meat was tender and the maple & mustard sauce were amazing. The sweetness from the maple wasn't too overpowering and there was just enough mustard to bring out the heat. I didn't care for the blue cheese dip but I liked how the blue cheese was really subtle."}
{"text":"overpriced, don't see what the hype is here, but the food is just extremely mediocre for what you get.  any bar or restaurant taste just about the same as this.  was also 30% full on a friday night, albeit, it's winter.  would not return."}
{"text":"We had supper this evening at Parlor Foods. They have been open for about ten weeks.

I ordered the Burger (without cheese or lettuce).  It was a good burger as were the fries.  I'd get it again.

Gord ordered Street Meat (without the jalapeno).  He said there were very good but needed a side dish (fries, salad, etc.).  I shared my fries with him.

Our server was Emma.  She was friendly and enthusiastic and took good care of us."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. The flat iron steak was divine, and the smoked butternut squash is a must!"}
{"text":"There must be a plethora of good restaurants in the area because Parlour was totally empty when we arrived around 5:30 and on had a handful of tables occupied when we left just after 7:00.

Very cool reclaimed barn plank entrance that makes you feel like you are walking into a club that may sport secret handshake;) More wood boarding on the interior and a ceiling tiles with used flour bags.

While the portions are quite small they were all very good to excellent. Perfectly fresh slices of focaccia with dip and another app called Onion Tots were just what we needed as starters.

Our mains of winter sausage, fish of the day and the house burger were all so good we didn't want to leave. And we didn't thank god because the butter Tart desserts may have been the highlight of a great meal.

You should go."}
{"text":"Canadian inspired cooking and cocktails. Everything is sourced locally (as much as possible). Everything made in house, including all the breads and all the cured meats. Food, cocktails and staff are all awesome. Give it a try you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Charcuterie is a must. Came here twice, any dish is fantastic but perhaps the highlight belongs to the alcohol. Easily top tier cocktails. Please order the cocktails."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food. Unique menu and staff very helpful to recommend dishes. Focus on local ingredients"}
{"text":"Came here for drinks one night with a buddy from out of town and have to say some of their cocktails were pretty good. I would definitely go back here again. Great service, Great drinks."}
{"text":"Ben ask me recently what's Canadian cuisine really? Same as American? We were trying to think of dishes that's originated from Canada and trust me, our list was rather short... So I remember the recently opened Parlor Foods & Co. (@parlorfoods). Seeing the menu, I guess Canadian cuisine is more about the ingredients than the dish itself... what you think?

Love the entryway of wood logs, I was already expecting to be transported to a rustic Muskoka cabin and indeed... love the high barn board tables and the coffee burlap sacks covering the ceiling

They do not have a menu online since it changes daily depending on the ingredients of the day.

Heard that their cocktails are amazing, so I just had to try but I had to say good job on the all local wine list.

 .
Smoke the Sky $15.00
~ Tequila Tromba Reposado, Luxardo Maraschino, Sage Shrub, Chili
~ Being the Tequila fan that I am, it's obvious that I will ordered the only tequila cocktail on the menu and I am always a sucker for smokey flavor.
~ Didn't really taste the chili but love the smokey flavor, what they did was smoked the glass on top of a wood plank right before pouring in the concoction.

Mulled Wine $10
~ made with sweet Vermouth, Benedictine and Christmas spices

Breads $4
~ Sumac, Thyme, Garlic Focaccia, Sourdough, Daily Tapenade
~ Just like everything on their menu, the bread is made in house as well.
~ There was way to much focaccia which is extremely dense and filling and really not a great accompaniment to other dishes, so we can barely finish half of it, wished there was more of the sourdough instead.
~ The eggplant tapenade was slight sweet and refreshing which was delicious.
~ Also wanted to try their pickles but for $8, we found it a bit steep compare to the price of most of their other appetizers at the same price.

Charcuterie $18
~ Lardo, N'Djua, Cotechino, Salami, Duck Procciutto, Potted Foie Gras
~ Was totally disappointed that they were out of the potted foie gras but since they cured their meant in house, I still wanted to try it but without a paté or terrine though the platter was missing something although I love everything here.

 Horse & Bones $24
~ Roasted Bone Marrow, Horse Tartare, Esabiche, Garlic Toast, Salt
~ This was way bigger portion that I have expected, huge bone that actually have a lot of bone marrow in it (not sure about you but I have my share of fairly empty ones).
~ Never could have imagine horse tartare would go so well with the fattiness of the bone marrow.

East Coast Seafood Boil $26
~ Mussels, Clams, Lobster, Spot Prawns, Lemon, Hawt Sauce, Drawn Butter, Celery
 ~ This was fresh and perfectly cooked, all that's needed for a seafood boil. I personally love the fried prawns head which was crispy and filled with yummy goodness.

Parlor Ice Cream Sandwich $10
~ Chocolate Fudge Cookies + House made Whisky Ice Cream
~ Thought everything was very reasonably price until this, although it was extremely delicious with the chewy warm cookies... it was definitely a bit tiny for $10 and they didn't event try with the presentation.

Sumac & Corn House made Ice Cream $5
~ This was surprisingly good, the waitress said that it reminded her of Captain Crunch Cereal.
~ Love the sweet creamy corn flavor with the slightly tart sumar berries.
~ So good!!!

Verdict:
~ Couldn't ask for better service and all the dishes were amazing
~ Will definitely be back to try more of the other dishes
~ It's 3mins away from Ben's workplace, so perfect to meet up for dinner when he have to work late."}
{"text":"This is a 5 star worthy establishment. So it's nothing short of astonishing that they employ the worst server on the planet. I'm still slightly befuddled by this fact and am having difficulty coming to terms with it. 
Ambiance and decor are 10/10. From the second you step into the sauna like foyer, the vibe is quality. LOVE the woodsy exposed log. 
Food is consistently above average. The calamari, shishito poppers and flat iron steak should be ordered.
The beer battered chicken and burger could can use a little upgrading but are nonetheless appetizing.
On my first visit we had a delightful, pleasant and knowledgeable waitress who represented Parlor beautifully.  She was one of the reasons I was eager to return and she spoke so highly of other items on the menu. 
The second time around, we encountered a waitress who is a complete liability to the restaurant. This woman is capable of sabotaging the entire operation. She deserves Olympic gold in subpar customer service. You say thank you, she glares, you order something, she glares, you would hope that at least the glares would be consistent, but no, she then drops the hammer and never returns to your table again. NEVER AGAIN.  Straight up disappears into the ether. You're forced to believe that such a disappearance is a blessing but the fact of the matter is-your curious about dessert and ultimately require the bill. No one to be found. 3/5 stars due to this outrageously unfortunate service."}
{"text":"Another Restaurant Row dud. Kind of like having \"insert fast food chain here\" and it reminds you why you don't eat at said fast food chain, this reminded us of why we don't go to Restaurant Row.

Everything was ok, but frankly nothing to write home about.

I had a caesar, it was flat and unimaginative compared to the description. \"Big wings\" were meh. Flat iron steak was ok, but you'd have a better steak for the money at the Keg. My wife had the vegetable and bean ragout, fine, nothing to return over. Just bland and uncoordinated flavours.

Service was good and attentive on the plus side. 

This place occupies the space that Paese used to, which has since moved, and Parlor doesn't match the food they put out. In our minds Paese was the one saving grace on Restaurant Row.

As a bar to grab a pint I'm sure it's fine. We just won't consider heading here for dinner in the future. There are plenty of places to go for a better meal in the city."}
{"text":"On 2016-01-08, my wife and I went to this restaurant for dinner (it was our first time at this restaurant). We chose it because we thought that the menu was unique and reasonably priced for sharing dishes. It was advertised as \"great local Canadian food\". We were not disappointed and surprised on a few points.

The décor was wood-themed, using wood for tables and wood logs for the walls. They also use a wood burning stove. They are trying to use the Canadian theme of log cabins.

The service was amazing. We had a male server. We thought the dishes would be small but when we ordered 5 dishes, our server suggested that it was a lot of food so we cut it back to 4. He asked if we would like the dishes brought out one at a time and we agreed. Wow! The dishes are large (extremely good value for the price!). Then we noticed the two men in the table beside us only order 2 dishes and a small dessert. We were definitely overstuffed with 4 dishes for the two of us!

We ordered the following:

(1) Calamari. $15.
Fried calamari, sweet & spicy red pepper sauce, crispy capers, cherry tomatoes, olive oil & chervil.

(2) Po-Boy. $17.
Fried Daily Catch (today is Oyster). Garnished with an Apple & Caramelized onion relish, carrot & caraway puree, Crispy Leeks strings, in-house buttermilk buns.

(3) Street Meat. $18.
Savoury summer sausages (with foie gras) on buttermilk buns, fresh slaw, pickles, pickled jalapeno, ball park mustard.

(4) Flat Iron Steak. $29.
Marinated & seared flat iron steak (cooked medium), candy striped beets, wilted baby spinach, potato croquette, finished with a savoury red wine veal jus.

All dishes tasted great!

The customer service was amazing. Our server kept filling our water glasses and changed our plates and cutlery after each dish. One time I dropped my napkin from my lap, leaned down to pick it up and a lady server picked it up for me!  When we were eating the \"Street Meat\" with our hands (can get messy), a lady server brought extra napkins for us just in case!  The servers really paid attention and attended to us before we even thought of it. I also liked that it wasn't just our own server who helped us - I hope they share their tips.

Additional info:
(1) They have free WiFi.
(2) It wasn't noisy.
(3) Look at the photos I posted with this review.
(4) It may be a little dark to read the menu,. Luckily most (not all) menu items are also listed on several blackboards which were lit up with a lamp.
(5) Remember the dishes are large. Even though they are sharing plates, it is best to order 1 dish per person in your party."}
