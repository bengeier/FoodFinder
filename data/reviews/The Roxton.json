{"text":"This is the kind of place you want to call your local. Yummy food that tastes homemade and fresh, delicious mixed drinks, and board games! What else could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Good little local joint
Service, food and atmosphere all great"}
{"text":"I don't know what's happened to the food at the Roxton!!  It used to be SO good. We went for a much-anticipated dinner on Saturday night, and it was extremely disappointing.  The risotto was undercooked, rice was a bit too \"al dente\", and it seemed like rice and other ingredients were cooked separately then put together. And the gnocchi, usually incredibly good, was a disaster. It was like little lumps of solid dough (Normally the gnocchi at the Roxton melts in your mouth). When I mentioned this to our server, instead of apologizing, she told me that's what gnocchi are meant to be like, etc. I have eaten gnocchi many times before, and this was actually inedible.   The roasted vegetable salad was okay. The salmon was a bit overcooked but okay. The dessert homemade doughnut, usually very good, was bitter with too much cinnamon, and tasted like it had been fried in old oil.
I'm upset because the food there used to be really great! Can anyone explain this? It looked like there was a different cook behind the counter, so maybe that's what has happened."}
{"text":"A fun place, sort of out one of those places that you wouldn't know to go to unless you knew it was there.  
The burger is delicious as is the sweet potato and bean wrap.
The only annoying thing is that I seem to want to go there when they aren't serving food."}
{"text":"Went there last night and the vibe was great. It was small, it seemed open-concept, and friendly, and just really like how a neighbourhood eatery should be. Our servers were great and both the menu and the drink menu were stellar; I do enjoy when products like, say, a KLB beer are served at a Toronto restaurant instead of, say, Budweiser. Makes everything feel a bit more local. 

The food was good, but perhaps not as good as the prices would suggest it would be. My burger (with cheese and bacon) was tasty, but nothing earth shattering. The salad and soup (parsnip pur√©e) were quite good, however. 

So yeah -- charming, cozy, nice. Just maybe a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Great beer, chilled vibe, delicious food and board games! It's a local favourite for me and my wife. Nice and off the beaten path from the college patio scene."}
{"text":"The east end of Harbord street is packed with charming dinner and date spots, jammed between Brunswick and U of T. The west end has the Roxton. 

It's a cozy local with reasonable cocktails and a short, but adequate, beer list. As most of the reviews here mention, the food is better than it seems like it should be, and the burgers are delicious and unpretentious. It's also a great place to get appetizers and hang out - the charcuterie platter changes seasonally and usually has a least one stellar cheese, the preserves are tasty and you should probably order the house-made doughnuts. Last time I was in, they gave us the option of donuts or timbits, topped with cinnamon or chocolate sugar accompanied by a white chocolate ganache and a sand cherry garnish. I love that they care about adding details (and also sand cherries).  

As a bonus, the Roxton has a collection of vintage board games, most notably the defunct Canadian trivia game \"Mindtrap.\" My best theory about this game is that it is composed of questions rejected from Trivial Pursuit. A sample: 

\"There was a shipwreck at sea and Buck, Lance, and Jack were washed ashore on a small island. Upon reaching shore they promptly fell asleep from exhaustion. A short time later, Buck awoke and saw that a box of bananas had been washed ashore. Buck ate one third of the bananas and went back to sleep. Lance soon awoke and upon seeing the box of bananas, ate on third of what was left and then fell asleep. Jack woke next and assumed that the other two hadn't eaten any bananas, so he ate one third of what remained. When Jack finished, there were 8 bananas left over. How many bananas were in the box originally?\""}
{"text":"This is our third disappointing experience at the Roxton, so I'm finally writing a review:

The service was slow, slow, slow:  It took 40 minutes for our food to arrive after ordering.

I ordered the \"homemade gnocchi\".  The gnocchi themselves were fairly tender, but they came in a plain-Jane tomato sauce that delivered the kind of one-note acidity found only in an unaltered 80 cent can of Hunt's.  In the sauce was a weird, afterthought handful of whole cashews.  Why?

N ordered the $16 reuben.  It was decent, but not $16 decent.  If the added expense of making their brisket in-house is what makes the reuben $16, it's not worth it.  I want to join other reviewers who have said the prices are a good 25% higher than they ought to be--or in the case of my dish, 80%.

All of this was served by a trio of miserable-looking people, none of whom stopped by the table after we were served to ask us if the food was okay, or even edible."}
{"text":"The food really is surprisingly good for a pub-style place. It exceeds expectations. At the same time, its a cozy atmosphere we like to drop into regularly. A neighbourhood mainstay."}
{"text":"We`ve had good experiences here - great ambiance for a local restaurant, very good food, excellent service, beer is local.  The menu tends to be meat focused ... the apps & salads are very good, haven`t tried desserts yet.  The menu does change regularly & isn`t large, but it works."}
{"text":"Great food, great vibe. Certainly recommend it. They also have a great selection of board games if you feel like a substantial food and stuff drinks with your Snakes and Lattes."}
{"text":"Me and my wife popped in here for drinks the other night. It was a great little spot with excellent service and a non intrusive attitude  lingered amongst the room. We overheard a table talking about how incredible their food was every time and inquired as to when the kitchen was closed. 

We were informed that it was closed already and mentioned we would love to try it another time. Moments later, the owner introduced himself and brought some freshly made donuts and cream to our table on the house and suggested dinner another time. What an incredible night out in a safe, service oriented,  professional environment."}
{"text":"I love The Roxton. The service and the food never disappoint.

We recently had a birthday at The Roxton with 16 guests. Everyone had a great time. The wine list suited our needs and everyone ordered different meals. The burgers were a hit, as well as my favourite, the seafood risotto. 

I recommend this place whole heartedly."}
{"text":"This is a cozy little candlelit joint that's mellow enough to enjoy a beer and sandwich with if you're on your own, but would also be an excellent place for a date. Pretty small, with a patio that just about doubles the indoor seating. I didn't actually enter the establishment this time, but from where I was sitting it looked welcoming enough.

The service was above average. Friendly, attentive, and prompt. Nothing stands out as am-az-ing, but I have no complaints (and I so often do). 

All the draft beer is all local, which earns lots of points with me. Not quite as many points as they'd earn if they steered farther from the 'safe' locals (most of it is Mill Street or Steamwhistle, neither exciting, nor particularly 'micro'), but points all the same. I settled on a Wellington Special Pale, which didn't disappoint. 

I went in knowing that I wanted to eat the hell out of a satisfying sandwich, and the chicken (organic or free range or something good like that), red pepper, and brie didn't disappoint. The housemade potato chips were also excellent. 

I'll go back."}
{"text":"I've really, really wanted to like this place, but by the third visit I'm out of hope.

I'll keep it brief and simply echo what others have said here; the food is ok, not stellar.  The prices are indeed about 25% higher than is reasonable for what you get and the service is just someone who brings your food, slowly.

The last time was the last time because the round of desserts we ordered were inedible (gray, flavourless chocolate cake & a chocolate 'risotto' that was a huge bowl of soupy rice with cocoa powder in it??) and the server didn't react at all when we told her about it.  No discount, no apology.  Just the bill.

As the Yelp rating states... \"Meh.  I've experienced better.\""}
{"text":"Avoid this place. 
We were lured by the nice local neighborhood patio, and in the end it turned out to be the only good thing of the whole experience.
Burger was dry, like a chunk of dry meatloaf packed in between a mass of a dry bun. The toppings were super dull, goat cheese was horrendous, old, and thankfully we had the roasted pepper to give that little bit of juice. No side comes with a burger (15$ with added topping)
The fish (20$) was just regular (you can always get the same quality if you throw it on a barbecue in your back-yard) and if you ask me, the sauce should always go on the side. No potatoes, no nothing to accompany. Only the weird mash of tomatoes/mushrooms and corn that didn't belong there.
The servers were smoking a cigarette every 10 minutes and the food took forever to arrive. They never offered to bring another round of drinks, and when they were asked to do so, they forgot the order. They never forgot to go to their smoking pause though. And of course the bill arrived super fast and was pricey.
You will not get the quality for your money here."}
{"text":"This is my favourite date spot. It's especially great for a first date, but hopefully we don't have too many of those in our lives.

Intimate, great food, optional board games and a great location away from the busy main streets.

The Roxton is decadent, let's you focus on the other, and have a great time.

The time I spent there was perfect and I highly recommend it to others."}
{"text":"This place is great for being hidden and off the radar of busy college street. Super great date spot.

My only hate on the place is the new owners and new menu.
It's not as good, and I think they killed the pulled pork sandwich ...."}
{"text":"So I came here with a number of friends and what started fine ended poorly.

We came here before a concert to get some dinner and drinks.  We ordered the pork carpaccio to start and followed it up some gnocchi, a veggie burger and fish & chips.

The pork carpaccio was minimal and covered by bits of not so fresh arugula.  The gnocchi was average and the fish & chips were satisfying.  To accompany the meal we had ordered the house beer, the Roxton Red.  The Roxton Red is an amber beer that seems watered down and was not subsequently ordered after that.

Finally at the end of the meal is when everything went south.  My friends and I split the bill, with some paying by card and me with cash (incl. a calculated tip of just under 20%).  The first of my friends went to pay and the server asked her if we had a friend at the table that was good at math.  She replied yes and paid her portion.  I find it quite odd to ask the first person that question, as it assumes that we were going to stiff them.  A better question to ask would be 'was everything alright tonight?', and perhaps to ask that question after the last person had paid.  He ended up stopping a couple of my friends on the way out to ensure we had paid enough.

I would've considered going back but not after that experience with the bill.  It is really poor form on behalf of our server."}
{"text":"As a member of the older generation, I find that although I want to keep up with current musical trends, I am at a loss to be in loud publichouses.  No such problem at the Roxton, where the music is perfect, the food quite good, and the ale flowing in wonderfully iced glasses.  Well done!"}
{"text":"Came to the Roxton on a Sunday night with a party of 6. They had Sunday drink specials which were your choice of a bar rail well, Roxton Red on draft or their house red or white wine for $5. We ordered the draft and red wine - both were great.

Everyone at the table ordered the burger - delicious. Maybe one of the best in the city. It was cooked medium and you can choose your toppings. Might I suggest you dress it with grilled onions and blue cheese like I did - yum. Tastes very similar to the famous burger at the Spotted Pig in NYC. Their relish is also fantastic. More cool cucumber than vinegary - really great. The burger is served with home made chips and your choice of salad or soup - the soup that day was french onion and it was NOT good."}
{"text":"Definitely got a great location and some ambiance - but for the quality of food being served, their prices are about 25% too high.

{"text":"GENERAL NOTES
I lived across the street from this tiny, hole-in-the-wall and was thankful I did many times. Not only is the food excellent, but the vibe is always positive and although this place is often packed, it's too small to ever get crowded.

MENU RECOMMENDATIONS
I seem to recall the menu changing with some regularity. It's usually a pretty small menu, with 4-6 apps and about as many entrees. Honestly, everything there is great. Slightly upscale but not pretentious (though it comes close). 

SERVICE NOTES
The staff are very friendly and attentive. You won't have a problem trying to get their attention for another drink and you won't very long for your food. 

LOCATION NOTES
Located on the south side of Harbord at Roxton, there's no sign but you can't miss it, there's nothing else around. There are probably 4-5 booths in a small raised seating area as well as 2 or 4 small tables on the floor and a 8-10 foot bar. Next to no standing room. It's very small. Classic Toronto bathrooms. A great soundtrack to your evening every night, courtesy of someone's iPod. 

HUMOUROUS STORY
For my 24th or 25th birthday I hosted a raucous Avril Lavigne themed house party and then stumbled here late night with a few friends. I guess I was stumbling a bit too much after my 3rd pint because as I went to order another the server, who definitely knew me from my many trips there, suggested that maybe, just maybe it would be better if he bought me a glass of water instead. At the time it sounded like the nicest way he could have cut me off and I wanted to thank him. \"Heeyyy mannn, I...I, just want to....I just wannasay. Umm, listen, I...I just wannasay I'm...wait, wait, what....I was gonnasay I'm gonna, yeah...I dunno waaat I was gonnasay. Wait, I think...\". Probably the most frustrating 5 minutes of that guy's life."}
{"text":"Cozy pub type atmosphere with great food and very personable service. They make almost everything from scratch and nothing anyone had disappointed.  The homemade gnocchi, the beet salad, the ribs and the flank steak were amazing. Desert is a must with us splitting the homemade donuts and the s'mores.  The only thing that would have been nicer with the amazing donuts would be a dollop of ice cream.  They also have some classic board games available to use while you enjoy a drink from their ample and reasonably priced beer/wine/cocktail list. This is a great neighbourhood gem and well worth the trip from anywhere. I'll be back to try the great looking burger and the make your own risotto!"}
{"text":"The Roxton has been our go-to place in the neighborhood for the past few years. Great place for a Friday night meal with friends. The menu is not huge, but tried most items over the last while, and all satisfied. Huge fan of their ribs. I sometimes worry if we'll be able to get a table, as it's not a huge space, but don't think we've ever had to wait more than five minutes. Good service generally."}
{"text":"This place used to have some of the best burgers in town. No more. Mine was dry as dust, largely flavourless, with dull toppings. \"Chips\" included with the burger? Ha. Yes, they make them in house, but five or six potato chips does not a serving make. Oh, and the snack-size order of house-made potato and parsnips chips consists of a little mound of fried parsnip shavings, another little mound of maybe a dozen blue-potato chips, and a bit of ketchup. Quite the mark-up for $4. I bet one parsnip lasts them all night. I think the Roxton has changed ownership since I last ate there, which come to think of it was quite some time ago. Too bad. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Roxton, but you do have to be prepared for \"laid back\" atmosphere/service (aka \"slow\").

But the beer is good, the food was not awesome but was solid.  We went early on a Saturday evening and it was quiet."}
{"text":"Went there for dinner a couple of weeks ago. They claimed the modem wasn't working for the card machine and took a carbon copy of my father's credit card. The following week, there were several fraudulent purchases on his card. Either the Roxton is up to something, or doesn't know how to properly dispose of sensitive data.

Food was OK, but nothing special."}
{"text":"I went to this place last night after a visit to the Comedy Bar on Bloor. I liked the decor and the atmosphere, although the music was a touch too loud if you're looking for a place to converse with friends. They had a small bookshelf with board games, which is cool.

It wasn't too busy at the time, there were a few groups of people both inside and out. The waitress was a bit odd, I asked to see a menu and she sort of looked at me funny before she gave it to me.  I looked it over and it was a bit fancy for pub food but it looked like there were a few options. 

I ordered the chicken sandwich with roasted red peppers and brie, hold the onions and mayo, and upgraded to jerk chicken. My friend ordered the beef taco special, no sour cream. The meals came in a reasonable amount of time. My sandwich was missing the brie, but the jerk chicken had a nice flavour. The beef tacos came with mayo on them. That wasn't described at all in the special. Who puts mayo on tacos? My friend cancelled the order and the waitress sort of got in our face about it. 

In the end we shared my sandwich and the nice part was they didn't charge us for the tacos, I've been to other places that have when that sort of thing has happened.

I won't go back there to eat."}
{"text":"Love the Roxton. Solid service, lovely owners, great vibe. The burger with spicy aioli is awesome, they bring you water with a slice of lemon as soon as you sit down, and they're cool with you hanging out and playing scrabble indefinitely."}
{"text":"A very cost ambience. A local hangout. Very unique looking. The service was wonderful. The owner was very attentive and all the staff said hi. The beef burger was excellent! Thick & juicy, and filling. We had this sinful, tasty homemade donut for dessert (no picture), paired with melted sugar. It's a good venue for catching up with friends. The background music ranged from classic rock to soul and rnb."}
{"text":"Full disclosure - Since early 2010 the Roxton has been owned by a dear childhood friend of mine and her husband. That said, I am a total foodie (must have been something in the water on our street growing up), and would neither have gone back more than once, nor bothered to write a Yelp review if this place wasn't fantastic.

I live in Vancouver, but I spent the summer of 2011 in Toronto, and the Roxton quickly became my go-to dinner out destination. In fact, it's fair to say I may have missed out on some of the other culinary delights of TO because I always opted to eat at the Roxton if I could. Everyone I brought to the place agreed - the food was scrumptious, the patio delightful, and the prices not to be beat.

The menu changes frequently, so many of my fave items aren't currently available, but I'll recommend anyway, in case they come back. The parsnip and chocolate soup was divine. I enjoyed every one of the house-made gnocchi concoctions I tried. Two different friends ordered and enjoyed the beet and arugula salad, which was light and flavourful. My absolute favourite, though, were the mussels with leeks, cream and pernod. I had them a few times, and was never disappointed. There's a veggie lasagna that's been on the menu since the fall, and I hope it's still there when I next come for a visit!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place!  It's one of those places where a deep down and very centered love of food itself seems to be the guiding principle.  We stepped in on a blustery night recently and it was a very cosy oasis. We started with the red rocket flat bread, which was exceptional. I'm not usually wowed by something as simple as a dressed up bread, but the flavours really went together in a way that made the whole so much greater than the sum of its parts - my first sign that this place had genuine food lovers at the helm.  The next sign was the canning jars. These folks seem to do everything from scratch - including making their own preserves. 

I tried the ribs which came with beans and parsnip crisps. The ribs were pretty good, but the beans were spectacular. I also got a taste of their veggie burger - which I strongly recommend. It was the best I ever had by quite a margin. 

I also really liked the room itself.  We were there for several hours and I didn't get restless or tired of the music, etc. It was extremely comfortable.

If I lived nearby I would certainly be a regular."}
{"text":"My experience at the Roxton was a bit forced, the current yelp reviews leave a lot to be desired and if I wasn't attending the birthday of one of my favourite friends, I'd probably have skipped the fete and joined them for post-dinner drinks elsewhere.

That being said, service was...interesting. Our server seemed a bit on the slow side, nice guy, but not particularly interested in helping us out with drink orders, not knowing a lot of the drinks himself, or the food selection. 

I ended up splitting a charcuterie platter and calamari with my boyfriend, and they were tasty enough, but for the price of them. I felt like the prices they were charging were not reflective of the quality (which was fine, just not to that...level) or the service.

Drink selection was alright, the house beer was actually pretty decent, but I'd only recommend this as a 3 star for a nice chill place (which it was, the atomosphere was right) but for DRINKS ONLY. Unless you enjoy overpaying for mediocrity.

(So for those keeping count, this is a 2 if you're considering it for food.)"}
{"text":"Perhaps it's the tiny space that justifies only having one server on staff. However, the length of time it took to get our food wasn't acceptable - maybe said server was also in the back, cooking the food..
The white sangria was delish. However, the lack of description of the menu made me unaware I'd be ordering gnocchi with a mint sauce (interesting choice and not the good kind of interesting)
I'd consider returning for a drink on the tiny patio but food will be consumed elsewhere."}
{"text":"The Roxton is the perfect cozy little neighbourhood pub. It gives you good food, friendly service, live music, and a charming atmosphere. What more could you want?? I've eaten here a few times and have always been satisfied with my meal. Their daily specials are far more creative than your usual pub fare and are highly encouraged. Last time I went, they were also sampling three different desserts for between $5-7 (my apologies -- can't quite recall!). Whatever it was, it was well worth the cost! The portions were large and the flavour robust. Definitely deeeelicious. I'm also a big fan of the service at this place. The bartender is a very charming, good-natured guy who is happy to make recommendations. 

Added bonus: they have a few board games in house for you to play. Come in and stay a while. I'm sure you'll be back if you do :)"}
{"text":"Went last night and had the chicken and pancake special.  OMG so good!  Hopefully they had to the menu permanently!  Great value.  My friend had to send back her braised short ribs cause they were a little too braised."}
{"text":"Nice patio, friendly staff, food just OK. The burger in particular was rather disappointing. I asked for it medium-rare and it came out well done. In addition, the meat did not have an ounce of flavour to it - it may as well have been a veggie burger with fancy toppings. If a place can't cook meat to order, you can bet it's not fresh. 

Toronto needs better burgers! I hope the Roxton considers improving theirs."}
{"text":"The Roxton is the kind of local which isn't content to just be a local, flocked to because nothing else is nearby. It's a place which understands that evolution and creativity is necessary to impress clientele, which shines through. It's smart, accommodating, and exactly the kind of place Toronto should be proud to have. For the value, one of the best wine and liquor lists in the city, and the idea that local breweries should be supported above all others is a great touch. A great patio, comfortable dining room, and well thought out menu place Roxton above most.

It is currently four stars because I've yet to actually dine; if the menu has even basic execution, I predict five in the near future. DIY risotto, I mean, honestly.

A casually very exciting place."}
{"text":"High on style, low on substance. On the plus side, the things we ordered were attractive and plated well. Unfortunately, that's where the positives ended. 

I ordered the burger - the meat was unbearably dry, and cooked to well-done (I prefer my burgers on the medium-medium rare side, slightly pink). If the meat weren't so dry, I would have loved it; there was an interesting, Mediterranean-esque spice to the burger that I couldn't place. . Unfortunately, the \"crisp\" bacon I added on was not crisp. That's 0 for 2 on good burgers on my trip to Canada so far. Sigh. If I don't get a good burger soon, I'm going to cry.

My husband ordered the halibut, which was really overcooked, to the point where it was rubbery, and tasted very fishy. My husband's the kind of guy that can eat anything, and he stopped after three bites. On an up note, the potatoes that accompanied the fish were really good, though they were lukewarm.

Total bill for our two entrees plus a half liter of wine came out to $67, which seemed really pricey given the disappointing quality of our meal. Of the two washrooms, one toilet was broken and the other had a door that didn't close all the way. The staff was nice about it, though -- and, really, despite the bad food the service was good. The ambiance is really cute, and I had such high hopes. I'll try this place again; perhaps we just came in on an off-night."}
{"text":"I love this little place and am so happy that it's just around the corner from my house :)  Their house beer is really great and I love the make-your-own risotto!!! The service is always really great and I love the atmosphere in the back booth area."}
{"text":"Popped in on a Thursday late night. We loved the warm and non intrusive ambiance, we really appreciated the music. We only had the late night food menu but the off menu cheese and charcuterie platter was great! 
We had a great time playing words with friends."}
{"text":"This is a small spot that's clean, modern and homey.  It's one of the few bars on Harbord, especially in the area near Ossington.  I know plenty of people who enjoy this place for food, and my one food experience there was a good one, but I really consider this more of a place for an evening drink, than a dinner spot.

Harbord St itself is a unique spot in the city; you really feel like you're in the downtown strip of a small town because there's nothing over 3 stories anywhere.  It makes sitting by the window (pretty much every seat inside is by the window) and even sitting outside on the patio a worthwhile experience in itself.  It feels a bit like getting out of the city, without actually getting out of the city."}
{"text":"This tidy little candlelit romantic/funspot has been a favourite of mine for years. It's on Harbord, just east of Ossington. Menu changes are frequent (and tasty) and the wine list is very reasonable. 

This place is great for a warm winter hangout as its very cosy. In summer the patio is lovely and the menu always reflects the season.

They also pour a perfect pint of Guiness."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place numerous times. Finally figured out that it was called The Roxton. Here are my points:

1. I never expected this to be Scaramouche, so I came here for drinks and not for dinner. Read other reviews to learn about the food.
2. The bartender (and subsequent service) was super gracious and kind. I never had to ask for water or water refills. 
3. For the money, the cocktails were amazing. The beer was cold as well.
4. The vibe here is relaxed. It is not a hipster mob scene or a snobby place. It is quite enjoyable.
5. This is a great place to have a drink and a conversation. I thoroughly enjoyed hanging out here."}
{"text":"Went with wife for dinner on a recent Friday and had a great time.  The restaurant was busy so we ended up sitting at the bar for a drink (good beer selection) until a table was ready but got comfy and decided to stay for dinner.  We both had a salad to start which were great but my main course was the best part - fall off the bone ribs.  Amazing vibe and great service, chatted with the owner as she helped us pick out a wine which was also excellent.  We live a couple blocks away and plan on making the Roxton one of our regulars!!"}
{"text":"A fun small place along harbord close to ossington. We both had the DIY risotto which was really good. The staff, ambiance and service were all good. The place is very inexpensive too.

The only weird things was the lights seemed to be dimmed and raised every 10 minutes. 

I would recommend trying it out especially if you live in the area"}
{"text":"I give it 5 stars to boost this underrated bar... at my own peril...

The wait staff really helps push this place to another level. The beet salad was not the kind of beet salad I was after. Although it was a rough introduction, we soon became good friends."}
{"text":"Sub-par but not awful enough to give it less than three stars. This place seemed a bit confused to me -- it was swanky and calm, but they also have board games (which is amazing but just seemed out of place). The food is yummy but not outstanding and I found it overpriced. The staff was nice enough but the vibe in itself was extremely off. You had an middle-aged couple having a quiet, romantic dinner, a group of rowdy 20-something guys drinking, and a mom with two kids playing board games all within a small vicinity of each other. It's an alright spot.. If you go, definitely get the fresh donut!"}
{"text":"Oooohhh it's so romantic. Yes, this place is totally a great place for cozy Friday nights with friends, or, you know, to propose to your girlfriend. The candles do it. Tiny tealights at every table, not to mention the dark wood bar, classy decor and mellow atmosphere...

Anyway, enough about the romance. The Roxton is adorable. Their food is delicious -- they stick to a simple menu full of seasonal ingredients that make it feel like home. Servings are generous and staff are friendly. The place is so small it feels like it could be someone's dining room, but you still have enough room to enjoy your company without eavesdropping on other people's conversations. I went against ordering a burger but when I saw the table next to us with their huge, juicy burgers, I wished I had just gave in. Next time, burgers.

Also, I'd recommend arriving early if you want a seat. When we got there, almost every table was set aside for reservations, but since we were a group of two, there was one table as well as bar seating available for us. If you're more than two, or you want to eat after 6pm, I'd suggest reservations. They had to turn people away at the door throughout our meal.

As for alcohol, they've got quite a few beers on tap, and if you're solo or going to be wanting frequent refills, I'd say you should sit at the bar to ensure your glass is always full. Their wine list looked decent as well (up on the wall, on a chalkboard).

The Roxton is definitely a cute neighbourhood joint worth checking out. There's no sign outside -- just walk east on Harbord at Ossington, on the south side, and it's in the building with the glowing blue diamonds."}
{"text":"I had no idea what to expect before I arrived. All I knew is that one of my best friends told me about this great place a block from his home at Ossington and Bloor.  Let me tell everyone the plain truth - This place is one of the best places I have EVER been in the city.  The people are great, food is spectacular, and the energy of the place makes you feel at home instantly.  I turned 31 at the Roxton - and the memory will live on.  ENJOY:)  Your special someone will think the world of you!"}
