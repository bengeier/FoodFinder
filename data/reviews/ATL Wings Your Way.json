{"text":"This is a little place behind the Filibertos, but it's BIG on flavor! All the wings are great, but I think my favorite are the ranch! Really crispy and fall off the bone tender. Don't leave without trying the honey biscuits!! Yum!"}
{"text":"The service was good. The food was hot but the wing sauce (traditional hot) was not what I hoped for. I will try another flavor and see how it goes."}
{"text":"Can't believe I never wrote a review for this place!  As you can tell this joint is all about chicken wings. Freshly made, coming in several different flavors. We tried the Hot, Ranch, Teriyaki & Honey BBQ...All equally delicious! The owners are great people who create a welcoming feeling to the place.  Considering the great wings I've tried over the years this by far tops them all."}
{"text":"Okay, so I'm a bit of a wing nut, and this place takes the cake. The parmesan garlic wings are hands down the best I've ever had. They always come out piping hot and never fail to please the taste buds."}
{"text":"Love their garlic Parmesan wings the wings are really good and very friendly staff check them out new restaurant in the area all wings yummy!!!"}
{"text":"The wings here are incredible.   I'm not sure how they do it, but the wings are so perfectly cooked, so crispy on the outside and succulent on the inside, that it puts other wing places to shame.    Try the \"Ranch\" wings for a non-spicy but unbelievably flavorable treat.  Other flavors are also really, really good.   On weekends, they do ribs, which quite literally pull right off the bone.  Try those cajun style for a little kick.  We've gotten take-out from here a few times, and it's always been really good.  The kids love their chicken tenders, and their honey biscuit desserts.  Good stuff."}
{"text":"So I occasionally will venture into a new spot and in the West Valley this happens more because the options are slim unless you love the usual suburb destinations.  There is a good bar next door, Augies, that I frequent but today I noticed a new place that had exactly what I wanted, hot wings!   The staff (all two of them) were very polite and introduced their menu which consisted of mainly wings and a few other items like fries and Fried Okra.  I ordered a few different types of seasonings and off I went home and devoured these awesome wings.    I would recommend you order take out since the options are very limited to wings and the location isn't necessarily anything you want to write home about. Pricing is pretty consistent to wings at the usual pizza shop so yes it can be a bit pricey.  I hope it can survive this bad shopping center, looking forward to coming back."}
{"text":"I went again to see Tony and ATL Wings your way, and as usual Tony was there greeting everyone with a smile and a hand shake. I ordered the 6 piece buffalo wings plus fries and coke combo for $6.99. I ordered hot wings and they told me there was an x tra hot option which I took. A few minutes later they came out very hot and spicy. Wings were crispy and plenty if sauce on there. The fries were very crispy as well and you also get celery and ranch sauce as well. As usual the wings were cooked perfectly. I savored every spicy bite and when I left Tony ( the owner)  thanked me for coming into his restaurant and wished me merry Christmas. I KNOW I'll be back. For the price, service and wings this beats his neighbor Buffalo Wild Wings Anyday."}
{"text":"Nothing too special. The smallest amount of wings is 15 which is fine, but only giving one small container of ranch isn't enough. Make sure you ask for 2-3.   The French fries are not good. They were very oily and seemed old. The chicken tenders are like ones from the frozen section at the grocery store.   Will give them another try for a different flavor of wings. I got the honey hot which is my usual wing flavor but they weren't anything special here.   You can dine in or order to go. There was no one eating in when we went to pick up our order.   I wasn't very impressed with the upkeep of the parking area. I know it isn't solely ATL Wings duty but maybe they need to notify someone of all the garage in their parking lot."}
{"text":"Blown away with the customer service provided by Tony (owner). Just went yesterday for the first time. Was greeted and called by my first name after Tony asked for it. I places my order and went to sit while my order was cooking. I forgot to tell him that the order I placed was to go so I got up and went to the back of the line so that I can tell him I wanted it to go, he looks at me and calls me by first name and asked me if I had a question, Mind blown! Besides that the wings were awesome, had 10 seasoned Wings which I was told it's their signature and they were bomb! When I first found out of the place I told myself, Are they crazy or what? Opening next to a Buffalo Wild Wings? Well after having ATL wings yesterday now know they are not crazy at all i\"m fact they're geniuses!"}
{"text":"I normally don't bother writing reviews but unlike the previous review that gave a poor rating that ate fish, I ordered WINGS!  Afterall it is a wings joint. The wings were awesome to say the least. I like wings with a crunch which is how they serve them. There's a whole variety of flavors, we got: garlic pepper, ranch, Cajun BBQ & traditional Buffalo mild. Between the three of us that ate, we couldn't even pick a favorite cuz they were all so good. Celery sticks were fresh and the service was consistently pleasant & cheerful to every new customer that showed up. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Great wings, amazing honey biscuits! A great local wing place that ya gotta check out! Dine in or order it to go. The staff is friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Being a person from Chicago, I am familiar with the adage that the best food sometimes comes from those places off the beaten path.  ATL Wings Your Way falls under that umbrella.  My wife and I stopped in yesterday based on the recommendation from a friend of ours and we were far from disappointed.  The first thing I tried was the Broccoli Bites.  These fried nuggets of cheese and broccoli were quite tasty and had us wondering if we were given enough for the $2.99.  The next thing we tried was the catfish platter.  The catfish was tender and succulent.  The breading was perfectly seasoned and reminded me of a few places back home (e.g. Sharks).  This is not a place that is going to fake a cornmeal breading on the catfish like many of the places I have had down here.  However, this is not a place like Sharks or J&J that cuts the fish up into steaks and tails but they do give you a decent portion.   The third thing was the wings.  Like the catfish, they did not disappoint.  We had the Sweet & Tangy, Spicy, and two different garlic wings.  Many places who make garlic wings tend to sometimes make the garlic overpowering.  This place did not.  The quality of the meat was first rate on all flavors.   The only gripe I had was with the soda dispenser.  Both times that I got Fanta Orange and Strawberry, I tasted more carbonated water than syrup.  I did notify Patricia about that and they promised to take care of it.    All in All, I enjoyed my first visit to ATL Wings Your Way and will return."}
{"text":"Wings are personal. Most of us like em, but we like em a certain way. Me? I like boneless. Way back, Pizza Hut had a sauce that ROCKED-their Cajun sauce. Granted, their wings weren't filled with awesomeness, but that sauce was the boss. ATL has a Cajun BBQ that is kind of a mix between that Cajun and TGI's Jack Daniels stuff-it's awesome. And their boneless wings are crispy, tender, and juicy. Mmmmmmmmm!!!! WELL done, folks!  And the honey biscuits must have crack or something in them cz I could NOT stop eating them.   Highly recommended!"}
