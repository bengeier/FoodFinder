{"text":"One of the most underrated restaurants in Toronto.  The ingredients are fresh unlike other Thai restaurants in the area .  I love the basil and lemongrass chicken... Authentic like actually being in Thailand.  Excellent value considering you are only paying 10 to 12 dollars per dish.  Hence the high rating."}
{"text":"I ordered shrimp rolls as an appetizer and green curry with chicken as my main. Both dishes were delicious, fresh, and presented elegantly. I also thought the service was wonderful and attentive - I never had to worry about running out of water, which is especially important to me when I am eating something spicy. The decor is also very charming and seems warm and \"authentic\". I consider this place to be a gem and plan to come back."}
{"text":"3/5! Recommend the spicy shrimp and green curry chicken. The soups, noodles and teas are not that great. However, close to eglinton stop so good locations!"}
{"text":"The best Thai curry that I've ever had was in Burlington, Vermont.  Ever since, I've been on a search for a restaurant that offered the same or similar tasting Panang curry.  I think I have found it at Mai Thai.  We ordered: - Classic Thai appetizer  - Panang nuer (dry curry) - Red beef curry  One of the challenges of looking for this Panang curry is that it is not served by every restaurant - most only serve the common green and red curry.  So, once I saw this curry on the menu, it was a no brainer decision.  The panang curry has a deeper dimension of flavour that makes the green and red curry bland in comparison.  If you find yourself at Mai Thai and can handle some spice, I highly recommend the Panang curry!"}
{"text":"Tried the lemongrass chicken - fantastic heat, with great sweet Thai basil flavour. Only downside was they were out of Singha beer."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic Thai food in mid town Toronto, it's scarce and hard to come by but Mai Thai Restaurant is here to save the day. Now, I can't say 100% authentic, but at least 90% there which is as close as I've come in this neighbourhood.   There are daily lunch specials for only $6.99 or $8.99 but the best way to order is definetely a la carte. The red beef curry is my favourite spicy dish and the cashew nut chicken dish is also great. The only thing on the menu I would call a bit over priced is the soup but they do offer a great selection.  If it's pad thai you seek, it's pretty good but not the best I've ever had. Unlike all other items on the menu, if you want it spicy, you have to make a special request and let them know you really do want it SPICY!!!  The only item that doesn't taste totally authentic to me, is the satay chicken. Rather than fulfilling the flavour that instantly comes to mind when I think of satay chicken, Mai Thai's satay tastes more like well cooked curry chicken.  Overall I would recommend the food at Mai Thai but if you only crave pad thai or satay chicken, be warned, they're not the best items on the menu and by that I mean they do taste good but not super authentic.  The restaurant is very nice on the inside, not quite fine dining  but almost, however it is not accessible you have to walk up a small flight of stairs to get in, strollers do not fit through the door well and once you're inside, the bathroom is up another flight of stairs. The service is also a little slow."}
{"text":"Had dinner here the other evening.  None of our party were impressed.  It wasn't horrible, it was edible for sure, but good?  No. I had the Squid Salad (Yum Pla Muk) and it had a really strange flavour, and the calamari (squid) was very very rubbery.  I also had the Coconut Chicken Soup and it was very watery and a very thin consistency (although the flavour was ok). Really wouldn't go here again - too many other dining options at Yonge & Eg, and if I want Thai, I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Not very impressed at lunch today. Who dresses a salad with sugar water?"}
{"text":"I went for lunch during work week. I appreciate how it took only a few minutes of waiting. But then again, I was the only person that ordered at the time.   The place is clean and cozy. The service was good.   My pad thai order was a bit more on the tangy and salty side, which is fine with me. It's a good portion for one person and it came with a spring roll.   I will go back here again."}
{"text":"3.2**  This is a cozy place with a potentially more intimate atmosphere to escape the chaos of Yonge. Come here if your seeking a quieter dinner away from the bars.  They serve up good tasting Thai dishes at reasonable price. The portions are a bit small if your planning on sharing a couple dishes and aren't a huge rice eater. Everything was tasty though and not overbearing. The pad Thai was not the typical orange colour but was more brown but it was quite good nonetheless. I liked the subtle coconut flavour to the curry chicken dish. The service was good and I found the lady serving us (possibly the owner) to be very friendly."}
{"text":"Meh. For Thai food. Just meh. I've had better. I had one of their lunch specials, the Vegetable Curry Pad Thai. It was alright. It wasn't all that spicy, at least for me. But it was a little sweet for my taste. The portions were quite large, my friend couldn't really finish his meal haha. But the pad thai, I feel they could've used peanuts and perhaps a bit of tamarind or something just for a little bit of that sour kick. The tofu, kinda tasted stale, or maybe that's just me. The spring roll included was pretty good tho. Not anything special, but not too shabby. Service was pretty fast, and the food came by within like 10 mins.  Our hostess was kinda funny. She was a tad racist, but it worked in my favor haha. I had a tough time deciding what I wanted, between the regular vegetable pad thai and the curry pad thai. She was like, the curry one kinda tastes like Indian curry and it's spicier, and you might like it. I went with her recommendation and it wasn't too bad. But after we placed our order, my friend and I had a good chuckle about the comment. It wasn't too big of a deal.  The decor of the restaurant wasn't too bad. What you'd find in a typical Thai restaurant. Kinda looks family run. The lunch crowd was pretty decent, not overly crowded. Seems like the demographic is the workers at Yonge and Eglinton just chillin', havin' lunch. I don't think I'd come here again, unless I really have to sate my Thai cravings."}
{"text":"I can't comment on the meat dishes, but this place has some solid veg options.  The have your standard Thai options and they do them well. Quick delivery as well."}
{"text":"So I'm happy to give good Thai its props when due. Tall order in these parts.  Mai Thai is pretty decent for delivery Thai but don't assume it will knock your socks off. It won't.   Here's why and what I ordered:  So who gets Thai without some spring rolls. I don't anyway.  Wish I hadn't. These tasted like the frozen variety... They might be. 3/10  The Pineapple chicken red curry looked plain but was tastier than expected. Lots of chicken and pineapple and lots of sauce too. I'm a big fan... of the generosity! 7/10  Chicken satay- pass. Really nothing to write yelp about. I mean total waste of taste potential. Meh. 2/5  As for the Steamed rice, it was steamed rice... good, large portion, but wholly dependent on everything else going on. 4/5  So... What does that give us kids... 16/30. Sounds like a very decent experience if you stay away from the culprits.   One last note... It is with sadness that I earn you, the peanut sauce is all around sad.  Not to mention inauthentic.   I RECOMMEND- the red curries. Beef or chicken, they seem to go down well with customers   EXTRA TIP- just-eat available, $25 min"}
{"text":"We stumbled into this classic diner yesterday evening.  We ordered the pad Thai and cashew nut chicken with the appetizer platter.   The platter was very affordable and was mostly good aside from the unfurled shrimp wrapped in thin stuff.  Otherwise good. While The cashew nut chicken could have had more sauce, it was still bursting with flavour, lots of vegetables, perfect rice hehheh. Very nice dins, good size portion. The pad Thai, while very very good, was a little small portion wise, and seemed to lack lime, peanuts, or extra sauce.  Despite these issues it was still quite fine to the taste. Overall I would definately give this place the time of day. Nice atmosphere, reliable food, and amazing prices.  Most dishes are $10!"}
{"text":"This has to be the worst thai food I've ever tasted (we ordered delivery). I am the type of person who will eat anything on my plate even if I am far too full, however I could not eat this.  My boyfriend got a piece of chicken with a weird grey fuzzy thing on it. The mango from the mango chicken has skin on it still. The noodles were plain and in a brick, while the rice came wrapped in plastic.  Not to mention it took over an hour to come. Very dissappointed.   DO NOT EAT HERE!!"}
