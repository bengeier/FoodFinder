{"text":"Had a bit doubt when I heard it the first time. Just have checked it out last weekend and guess what, I LOVE IT! THE MUSIC IS BEYOND AWSOME!!! I used to have the thought of open a bar like this. Since there aren't any premium or high-class club here at CU. Shame it's still a thought to me but someone else make it real. This is my first comment, usually I'm too lazy to leave any but not this one! I'm telling u I'll seek for job there, maybe u will see me working there next time you go to A plus! At least I could be part of this club? l don't know lol"}
{"text":"They get one star since the rooms look amazing and the sound system is killer. Every other aspect of this business is a joke. 15% gratuity added not only to our room rental but to every single drink order made. Liquor was clearly watered down, the room was uncomfortably hot, I ordered a drink with a lime - bartender served it without, I asked a second time - he sighed and got a lime out of the cooler, washed it and cut it. Beer selection was almost nonexistent. They had about a half dozen Coronas and some luke warm Heinekens - out of everything else. We stayed for almost 4 hours and at the end of the night they rounded up and charged us an extra half hour (rather than pro-rate us). Despicable business model - I'll never go back."}
{"text":"The best KTV I've in Urbana-Champaign. The system is updated so I can find most popular songs in China. Location is convenient to student since it's close to bus stop. Staff is nice and there's available room always as you go there in weekdays."}

Three out of the four mentioned that the drink prices have been lowered. 
Three out of the four mentioned the \"hot\" dancers/ waitresses.
Two out of the four mentioned the nice \"decorations\" (WTF?)

If you think those 5-star reviews are genuine, I have some ocean-front property in Nebraska that I'd like to talk with you about."}
{"text":"Good place for karaoke. A little pricey ($45/hr small room). 15% gratuity added to everything. Heard beer is very expensive, but I went to sing so I didn't care about alcohol. Large song selection including mandarin, Cantonese, English, Japanese, and Korean songs."}
{"text":"Well, I should say FINALLY THERE'S A TRUE NIGHTCLUB!!! Fantastic decoration, stunning sound system, hot waitress (which I think very important!!!) And of course all kinds of drinks. Price used to be a bit high(but worth it personally speaking), but I've just heard that they adjusted the price(AWWWSOME!!) I definitely need to go check the wine list myself! Maybe you should, too. One more thing to say, I have read other comments below and here's my thoughts: Walking into VIP zone or fled with unpayed bill, that's not the club's fault I guess? Let you stay the VIP zone is just been nice and charge before serve is just being cautious as far as I can tell. Anyway, check it out urself and prove whether I'm right or wrong!"}
{"text":"This is the best lounge I've ever been too. Staffs are nice and most importantly the owner is great. Definitely the best place to hang around over the weekend."}
{"text":"Lol,Being there twice a Month. BEST nightclub in ILLINOIS. I really like their fruit plate and chicken tender. Strongly Recommended."}
{"text":"Walking into this place, I had high hopes for what I'd find inside.  It's got a nice sound system, lighting is nice and the decor is beyond what I had expected. The issue with this place is that it's clearly owned by people who have not spent much time in a nightclub.  First, if you're going to buy bottles, there should be no cover charge.  Second, if you're asking about bottles at the door, there should be at least 2 hosts (and the owner if it's as slow as it was that night) greeting you and asking how they can help.  The drinks are under poured, the cups and under sized and I was less than impressed with the clientele.  If you want people to spend lots of money in your club, then you need to dress the part.  Sadly, this place isn't going to survive . . ."}
{"text":"This place has been completely revamped. What a great experience! Give this place a try for a great evening out. Private karaoke rooms and great staff. Who knew this was in Urbana?"}
{"text":"Best place on campus for karaoke hands down; I have no idea how the bar is. They have a digital song select system with HK, English, Mandarin, Japanese, and Korean systems. Service is beyond exemplary. 10/10 would sing again"}
{"text":"i believe this is the best bar in this area, and when I walk in this place it give a new feel about the bar, modern, and rock! The food is good and the price is fair.Drink is so delicious?and I went to there lots of times, not only for fun but also for the service. The dancers are so hot and the Dj is really professional.  I didn't get point for who give the so low rate for this place."}
{"text":"@ Evan B and Ben B.  Does it surprise you that all 4 first time reviewers appear to be Chinese and the joint appears to be owned by a Chinese?"}
{"text":"This place is honestly not bad, if you make a reservation first. Their sound systems are awesome, I'd say the biggest room is the best. They have cool lights, nice mics, and a really good variety or English, Korean and Chinese songs all on deck. It's a good place to hang with a bunch of people.

Ordering bottles from them is cool, you can get champagne with a sparkler or other high quality alcohol. I'd say my friends and I go here about once a month. A lot of the staff is super cool, they'll sing with you and help you fix the sound system. 

My main qualm with this place is the really bad bar service. It took the bartender a good 20 minutes to make me a long island. They they didn't have some ingredient for another drink and took forever to find it, and I think my friend's drink just got served without it to be honest. I wouldn't order straight from the bar, I'd just get bottles."}
{"text":"It seems there's a lot of drama in the reviews of A Plus VIP Lounge, but my honest experience wasn't bad, nor was it outstanding, either.

I've seen the place walking by and heard rumor it was an upscale, perhaps expensive, club-like atmosphere. We decided to come at around midnight on a Saturday to give it a shot.

We were pleasantly surprised to find there was no cover charge, but quickly found out perhaps why that was.... there was hardly anyone in the place, practically empty!

We scoped the place out before ordering and I was actually impressed with the ambiance and d√©cor, it really has the look and feel of a city nightclub or lounge. It was extremely clean and well-kept which is a nice change of pace from the notoriously scummy campus bars. 

I asked for a menu to look at the cocktail list, I ordered a \"Taurus\" and my roommate got an \"Innocent Eyes\". I very much enjoyed mine, I thought it was a really tasty cocktail. He thought his may have been a little on the weak side. These were $8 each, a little expensive, but in all fairness it was a great cocktail I would order over and over. My only reservation about the price was because I could have sworn I seen the bartender(s) use the well liquor in my drink, and I would at least expect something a little better than wells for an $8 drink.  A cranberry vodka I had later was ~$5. Other friend was a little disappointed they didn't know how to make a \"Singapore Sling\", which perhaps might have been more likely at a nicer place like this, oh well, not a big deal. He did like the Mai Tai they mixed up though. The place uses the goofy iPad/tablet for when you close a tab or buy a drink with a card, which is a pet peeve of mine, especially when our intoxicated group can't figure out how to work the damn thing.

They had a DJ that night and the music was typical mixed top 40 stuff, not necessarily my style, but I have heard worse and the volume was not entirely unbearable. The ~10 other people in there had taken spots up from closer to the DJ while our crew hung out towards the back and more or less watched. This girl, bless her heart, approached us and asked what it would take to get us up front dancing in terms of a song. Drunken me blurts out \"Stayin' Alive\" by the Bee Gees since the group kind of hesitated. It was the first thing that came to mind and it's a dancing classic for anyone who appreciates music of that style and vintage. She looked a little confused and didn't seem to know the song, but alas went up and requested the DJ play it, which after a quick dirty look he reluctantly did. We had our couple minutes of fame, embarrassed ourselves, and returned to our table and resumed observing everyone else.

I really think this place has some potential to be awesome. Unfortunately, the location isn't on campus and I'd expect most students don't necessarily know about A Plus VIP Lounge. I would definitely say there is a customer base for this type of establishment at UIUC, students just don't seem to be aware of it and consequently draws more local people. They should do some campus advertising, maybe even have a one time (or more often) discounted Friday or Saturday drink special to get the ball rolling.

Maybe we came on a bad night, it was a little rainy/drizzly so that could be a factor.

I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The other reviews do not help when you're deciding whether or not to come here. We avoided this place for a long time because the only genuine reviews here were so negative and we didn't want to accidentally walk into an upscale version of Hooters. We ultimately decided to try it on an impulse while walking by to buy tickets for an upcoming event. Our experience was surprisingly average! Despite the odd claims that the waitresses  are \"super hot\" I was happy to find them to be very average and down to earth. Most importantly, I was happy to see that there were no stripper poles, blacked out windows,  or scantily clad bartenders. We decided that this place would be great to rent or reserve for a celebration or to come for karaoke. Let's be honest, it's Urbana. This place is never going to be a hopping dance club but I could see this place being a super fun karaoke place. They've got a big stage that's just perfect for it.

There are definitely a few things to be desired. They're trying really hard to appear high end but the menu consists of low end bar food. The music doesn't fit the ambiance at all. They were playing a mix of classic rock and top 40 when the vibe is more suitable for r&b or jazz. There was also a lingering odor of deep fryer.

In the end, we were happy this place wasn't as trashy as it sounded and will probably be back to check on updates and look into reservations for an upcoming special occasion.

1/30/15 UPDATE 
I came here for the magic show and I was chewed out by the owner and security for 'blocking the view' of a man. I guess it was more important that the lazy guy behind me have a completely unincumbered view in his comfortable seat than it was for me, a petite girl and devoted yelper to enjoy the show. After the show was over, I guess the owner didn't want all the pesky customers to hang around and enjoy another drink while they talk about the magic show. It was probably a better idea to go back to blasting techno at full volume and to initiate a fully overstimulating light show for an empty room. I am being generous by maintaining 2 stars instead of dropping them down to one. They are so lucky this magic show was in their establishment. It was so entertaining, its the only reason I'd be caught dead at A Plus VIP Lounge."}
