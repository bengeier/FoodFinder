{"text":"One of my favourite Asian grocery store to visit! It has got fresh produce(fruits and veggies and some meat) and a great variety of noodles, Korean snacks, etc. It's a pretty small place so they do not have a lot of stuff compared to other Korean grocery store I have been to but they definitely have the best selection of Frozen stuff like ice cream, buns, etc. Many selection of ice cream that I have never seen! They also have a mini restaurant at the top of the store."}
{"text":"Love this place! I always go there to pick up my fruits and veggies as the loblaws can be a bit far sometimes and the whole foods nearby is too expensive! It's a but cramped In there especially if you are carrying a basket but it's because there's a lot of stuff. I usually always grab some Korean treats to try so that's fun!"}
{"text":"I love this Korean supermarket! First of all, nothing can beat the convenience. It's right on the subway line next to the Sheppard center, you really can't miss it. Albeit the shop is a bit small, it has a good selection of fresh meat and vegetables, decently priced, definitely less expensive then Galleria. They also have a decent selection of cooked food which I can just grab for dinner if I'm off late from work. 2nd floor sells mainly cooked food and bread and pastries. While their white sandwich bread is a bit pricey at $2.50, they are soft and fluffy. All in all, I love this place. M2M has all the essentials, and has definitely became my go-to grocery store."}
{"text":"Walked by and wanted to see what's the difference between this Korean Supermarket and H Mart..  I like M2M more, the staff is very friend, and the food items seems more fresh. They have a food court on the 2nd level which I didn't get to try, but will definitely go back to try. I purchased their kimbap for $3.5 which is pretty cheap compared to H Mart and Galleria. I will go back for sure. !"}
{"text":"Good standard place for simple grocery and snack needs with good working hours. Nothing special about it though to make me go wow."}
{"text":"Love this supermarket down the street from me! For its small size, the selection is awesome and prices are quite reasonable for the location :) highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food court here on the second floor is still solid and staff is usually hardworking and friendly. However I am lowering my rating due to the produce downstairs. The freshness of their produce leaves a lot to be desired. Considering the relatively high price I am definitely not happy to see rotten vegetables (specifically carrots) on the shelves and I have purchased grapes and other fruit that were not as sweet as at Loblaws or went bad pretty quick.  I recommend getting their prepackaged food here, not produce since the quality really disappoints.  A note: last time I was with a friend at the food court, my friend happened to need the bathroom so he went up and asked the cashier; however the cashier advised there was no bathroom available. I guess they don't open their bathroom to the customers anymore like Jennifer K mentioned."}
{"text":"I always go to their upper level K2GO they have awesome meals that come with soup kimchi salad noodles and rice for $7.90 i always get there beef bulgogi which is really good.. they are super friendly and fast and preparing the food"}
{"text":"I don't go there often because the groceries are definitely not cheap compared to a Chinese grocery store at Yonge and Steeles. But we go there to buy fruits at times. Today my fiance and i went there, we got bananas, a package of kiwi and some peaches. We put peaches in a bag. We went to the checkout, but I wanted to check out some of the food outside the check out desk beside the front door, so we put the fruits down at a desk beside the check out desk just in case they thought we walked out without paying. I got some food and went back to the desk to get all other stuff, but the cashier already put everything in a bag and scanned, I said oh we are not done yet, guess what she rolled her eyes and it was so obvious to see her attitude. What was the big deal to tell her we were not done shopping yet?! Seriously don't roll your eyes next time."}
{"text":"I've been here about 3-4 times here for the restaurant on the 2nd floor and have mixed opinions. I would still say it's worth a try.  Food: 3/5, the first time I was here, I got the bibimbop and it wasn't good. They give it to you in a wide styrofoam container do it's almost impossible to mix it to really enjoy it. I had to eat the parts separately.  The chicken cutlets however were super tasty and I'd recommend this dish.  When you do come later in the evening, they don't give you the glass noodles as a sidedish and you get something else so I wish they warned me of that.  Service: 3/5, the ladies are nice but mostly self serve after the food arrives.  Ambience: 2/5, the seating is quite terrible but I think it's more meant as take out.  There are stools but almost the same height as the bar tables so you have to bend over a lot to eat so I recommend you get one of the bendable chairs instead.  Price: 4/5, $8 for a solid meal"}

{"text":"A local store I found very close to my home. Has most things I need, which is basic groceries with occasional craving for quality extras. Polite staff, restaurant upstairs (which I didn't check out yet). I wish it had more fruits, dairy, and berries, but otherwise it is what I need for my day to day fresh food."}
{"text":"Easy Korean little groceteria that I popped into after my lunch next door at sushi moto. It's a smaller old school corner Grocery store filled with loads of awesome Korean and Asian foods. Lots of fresh food also amazing prepared Korean snacks. I picked up some gimbap for my long drive down the 401 and I was blown away with the freshness and quality. They even had gimbap with processed cheese slice. Some people may think this is a true insult to Korean food. However for someone who is borderline problematic with cheese slices this is a decadent delish. It was fresh and flavourful. If I lived nearby it would be a weekly hit up. Great selection and prices. Korean food! Yes."}
{"text":"Nice cheap food and snacks! Produce items look really fresh too"}
{"text":"This is a cute little Supermarket/convenience store crammed with lots of things! As others have mentioned, it is not as extensive as Galleria, but the location is good if you don't have a car (close to subway). You'll find produce, instant noodles, mochi, salty snacks, frozen dumplings, and grab'n'go type dishes on the cheap here. Prices are much better compared to PAT in Koreatown (Bloor/Christie). You can also find a small selection of Korean beauty products, like those sheet face masks that are so fun to use! I haven't tried their takeout cooked food yet, but they look yummy!"}
{"text":"So I came here because I was looking for sushi grade salmon and thinly sliced sirloin for bulgogi. I got everything I needed including the seaweed salad and miso soup. They have a wide variety of Asian products considering the size of the store. There's a second floor here where you can sit down and order food which is convenient. I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"I love this little store! They have almost everything I want for my daily cooking, fresh and inexpensive!"}
{"text":"Went to the upstairs restaurant/take out place.  It was so much more than I expected.  100% authentic, Seoul-style street food and more.  Had the ojingo-bokkum (spicy squid) and rice and it was amazing.  The right amount of heat and the gochuchang was perfect!  There are ladies making kimchi and different kinds of panchan, just like in Korea.  The hand-made mandu (shrimp, meat or kimchi mandu) are luscious, thin, melt in your mouth wrappers filled with goodness.  $7.99 for ojingo bokkum and it comes with miso and a small (microscopic) order of mat kimchi.  Will be back.  What an amazing surprise!  Tae dan hi kamsah hamnidah, M2M!!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this little place! Tons of Asian groceries that you don't find in the typical loblaws/metro. It's not a huge place but they sure make good use of it.  Be sure to check out their cooked foods section as well. I especially like their slices pork knuckle (hock), which goes great with noodles.  For people who have the H-mart loyalty card, they are part of that program. Make sure to pay cash or debit for maximum point accumulation (5 points per dollar spent)"}
{"text":"M2M = Morning to Midnight  A brand new Korean \"convenience\" store where you can pick up some grocery and some made to order or pre made food.  Location is so convenient, located just North of Sheppard Subway Station. Selection might not be as big as H-mart or Galleria but good for pick up some necessarities (instant/frozen noodle or fresh veggie or milk) and you can also order from the food counters on the 2nd level for some rolls, pork bone soup or a sandwich if you need a quick bite.  M2M is operated under H-Mart as their convenience stores, the first one in Canada with 2 others in Manhattan.  There are also individual Melona ice cream bars and ice for sale! If you love Korean treats, it is a great pit stop to pick up something on the road here! They even have a washroom for customer too!"}
{"text":"this place is friggin great!  super cheap sushi! If you go later i know you can get a tray of 8 spicy crab rolls for $3.99, etc. And of course big trays of kimbop for the same price (or cheaper!) Love the baked goods (there's an upstairs with a cafeteria and bakery section, I suggest checking it out.) A decent selection of other Korean snacks. They've had a really good deal on Natto for some time now, ($1.99 for a 3-pack) frankly, I hope it never ends.  im so glad this place is just down the street from Sheppard station"}
{"text":"They are a little pricy comparing with other supermarket , but it s very convenience open until midnight"}
