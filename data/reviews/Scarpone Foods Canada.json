{"text":"Scarpone has some items I can't find elsewhere, and it is an ok place to shop, but I still love Lina's better than most other Italian markets. 

I find Scarpone's can be a bit messy and disorganized, and it's not in a convenient location.
We bought a large jar of their name brand olives and they were awful! Makes me hesitate to buy their other products.

The dining area lacks 'atmosphere' and I've never been tempted to eat there."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian market in the city.  Good prices and nice people working and shopping there."}
{"text":"Okay, okay: don't get me wrong. I love the centrally located Italian markets for their quaint charm, but as they get more popular their prices rise. The sheer number of little old Italian grandmas shopping at Scarpone's should indicate something, and that is that for both prices and often selection, Scarpone's can't be beat. 

The major issue of course, is that it is a massive hassle to both find and get to. You have to work to get the delicious Italian staple foods (or to visit the tiny deli). But man, when you do find it, it is wonderful. Dinner ideas basically flow into my head. Try the olive oil, the pastas, the cheeses.... The staff are pretty nice, and are happy to answer food related questions. Scarpone's is family owned, which is just one more reason to actually do the leg work of hunting it down. It is always worth it."}
