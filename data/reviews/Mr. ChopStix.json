{"text":"This place is awesome, food are really good, especially pork ribs and vegetable noodle, which is my favorites! Food not greasy and salty at all. It tasty like really Chinese food much better than any other Chinese restaurants we visited before! We come this place a lot! My two year old girl who love to go this place too! I used to order BBQ fried rice and chicken chowmein for my company potluck. They get my food ready on time ! No delay ! my coworker like my food so much, they become two of most welcomed food at that night!"}
{"text":"The food is greasy but it's sooo good. I've ordered delivery and sat and dined in. The location was nicely decorated but only thing was that there was a really OFF putting odor throughout the whole restaurant. Not sure what it was but it definitely was not appetizing. Definitely order the spicy wonton and beef and onion pancake. Very flavorful. You won't be disappointed. This place would be perfect if they cut down on the oil and took care of that mysterious odor."}
{"text":"There should be a Hell yes button when replying to the questions asked, this place is amazing! Great price, excellent food, super clean! My families new favorite place!"}
{"text":"This place is an absolute joke. If I had the option to choose negative stars, this place would get NEGATIVE 5 stars.   My hubby and I were excited that a new Chinese establishment had just opened nearby and have been eager to try it out  We went in around 2 pm on a Monday. It was completely empty, not one table was filled. We were quickly seated and given the menus. Without really explaining anything on the menu or giving us much time to look over the menu, the server who barely knew any English seemed to rush us to order our food. We ordered pork & cabbage steamed dumplings as an appetizer, and 2 noodle dishes as our main.   We were surprised to see that the noodle dishes came as quickly as they did, before the appetizer. Thinking it can happen maybe due to the dumplings being handmade to order, we waited for them. And waited. And waited some more.   We waited more than 15 minutes after our noodle dishes were brought out, we were nearly close to finishing our main noodle dishes. The server brought us what we thought were the dumplings we ordered, only to see that they were potstickers. Either the server put in the wrong order or the cook messed it up. She apologized and took it back to where the owner and her friend was sitting. They end up eating the potstickers, while we waited for the cook to make our dumplings that we waited more than 15 minutes for. By this time, we were all done with the main dishes. We waited. And waited. And waited some more.   We waited another 10 minutes before getting impatient. I flagged down the server and asked where our dumplings were. She said that the cook forgot about our order and that we would have to wait 7 more minutes for them. What the fuck??   They had ONE table, ONE order, ONE job, and they fucked it up. Even now I'm boiling up trying to relive our horrible experience. I can understand things like this can happen have they been busy, but we were the ONLY ones in the restaurant besides the owner, her friend, the server, and the cook.   What made it even worse was that there were no apologies, no nothing. The owner showed no empathy whatsoever. What she did do was bring her food out to the table right behind us so they can eat their lunch. Are you fucking serious?  Walking out of that restaurant was the most awkward situation I have ever encountered. There was no bye, no thank you, no sorry, no nothing. It was all silence.   Again, we were the ONLY customers in the restaurant, they messed up on the most simple order, and the owner doesn't have the decency to come and apologize? For a restaurant that has only been open for a month, I'm not sure what makes her think she has any potential for success.   Please do yourself a favor and just avoid this place."}
{"text":"GReat food and good service.The portion size was appropriate. Egg drop soup was fresh and delicious. All our food was tasty and very fresh. can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"They just opened and We drove by one day and decide to try a new restaurant! The food is authentic Chinese food!! Very good!! The price is reasonable!"}
{"text":"Food was great,service is awesome ,nice place for friends and family .you don't have to drive to  Strip Or Chinatown anymore."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food quality. Very satisfied. Lamb skewer is my favorite. Gotta try it out when you go."}
{"text":"Very good food and service!  Great authentic for, the wontons are good!  The Boba tea and other flavored teas are also great.   My wife and I really enjoyed.   It is also close to our house,  we'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. My son is very picky with Chinese food because that is his favorite.  We have eaten at many places and they make the best Orange Chicken.  It's soft, savory, and full of flavor. This is a must go to place for parents who have kids that are picky eaters.  They will definitely be saying \"Yummy for my tummy!\""}
{"text":"We tried dandan noodles, shaved ice and Brased pork egg rice, they are so yummy and the place is nice. They have a good service too."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in town, offers a variety of authentic Chinese foods in a reasonable price, my favorites are the lamb, \"Rou jia mo\" and chicken wings"}
{"text":"The pricing is very reasonable. The interior is very sleek, clean, and cozy. I love love love open kitchens, and watching my food being prepared."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. We will never eat here again. They got several things wrong on our order. The dumplings were steamed, we ordered pan fried. No Sauce. The pork pancake was limp, greasy and old. No sauce. The shrimp were so overcooked the shells were like leather and stuck to the shrimp meat. The shrimp were not even edible. The Mapo Tofu was mild and bland. A McDonald's spicy chicken is twice as spicy as their \"Spicy Szechuan\" Mapo Tofu. The Chicken cold noodles tasted just OK. Again, not spicy at all! We ordered a beef, a chicken and a lamb skewer, we got a chicken skewer and 2 lamb skewers and they were mostly fat. The skewers were incredibly small maybe 2 ounces. Much less than any of the pictures. So don't waste your money. Cheap, no spice, wrong orders, old food, food that went in the garbage because you couldn't eat it."}
{"text":"Inexpensive, great service, heathy, and great food.  Have been looking for a neighborhood Chinese restaurant and now I have finally found it!"}
{"text":"The prices are too high, the portions are small, and there is way too much MSG in their food.  The service is okay.  I have eaten here quite a few times but after my last experience I won't be coming back.  We ordered a noodle dish for take out and they gave us a completely different sauce than the last time.  It tasted lousy and the portion was very small and laden with salt and MSG."}
{"text":"Food was excellent!! A new favorite Chinese place that I know I will frequent. The staff was very friendly and accommodating!"}
{"text":"I ordered both their orange chicken and Kung Pao. I'd have to pass on the Kung Pao, rubbery chicken and zero spice.  The orange chicken was phenomenal though!  The wait staff was slow but pleasant."}
{"text":"The food here was great.  We ordered the milk tea and the mango ice tea both of which were very good.  My kids had the combination noodles and rice and they ate it all!  I had the spicy beef noodle soup which was excellent.  We finished the meal with mango-flavored shaved ice and my 4 year old had 3 bowls. The prices were quite reasonable so we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing?This is our second home. Best food ever . If you want some real Chinese food, you should give it a try."}
{"text":"Went there with my dad.  Friendly service.  Our server was very attentive and checked on us often.  The cold noodles were great, not salty, and just the right amount of spiciness.  The potstickers and pork pancakes were great.  Not too oily, perfectly cooked crispiness.  The skewers were good.  The beef was again, spiced just right.  Our server asked us if spicy was ok, and it certainly we.  I also had a shrimp skewer.  The flavor on the shell was delicious, but once you peel the shell, the flavor was pretty much gone.  I also ordered a milk tea boba. The taste was perfect.  They make it to order, unlike many other milk tea places that pre-make it and store it in a pitcher.  Boba as fresh too.  I would have like the drink to be a little colder.  It was cold, but since the temp outside was about 105 at 7pm, a few ice cubes would have made the drink perfect.  The price was very acceptable.  Will definitely be coming back the next time I visit my dad."}
{"text":"It is a nice and clean restaurant.  We ordered 4 dishes (sweet and sour chicken, eggplant tofu, chicken cold noodle, chicken mushroom) plus combo fried rice.  All the dishes were pretty up to par, although chicken mushroom was a bit on the salty side.  We especially enjoyed the chicken cold noodle.  Combo fried rice was not any special and probably would order a regular one next time.  Overall, it's a place worth stopping by if you're craving for some Taiwanese food when you're in the area."}
{"text":"Found this place on Groupon and referred by a gentleman I met waiting at a dentist lobby lol!!! Great quality of food and the customer service was amazing!!! Loved it!!! The gentleman serving us was absolutely fantastic, one of the best since I've been in Vegas."}
{"text":"Excellent food and services. I love the spicy chill oil beef and beef noodle soup. Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon for this place $12for $20 worth of food. I had to try their beef stew noodle soup, it is supposed to be their signature dish. I consider myself a beef stew noodle soup fanatic and I would have to place this dish somewhere on top of my list of noodle soups. The broth is dark and very very flavorful. Unlike other broths that I am used to which is more transparent. The flavor is deep and has that borderline sweetness to it. The beef was very tender (a bit fatty but I like fat ) and also soaked up the flavor of the broth. It's a bit spicy at the end when you finally eat the small pepper morsel but it is not too hot, just right. The bokchoy is a great addition. Green onions and I would assume some ginger and garlic tops this soup nicely. The noodles are thin and a bit flat in shape. Not sure if these are egg noodles but I stopped caring after I tasted the broth. I also ordered beef and broccoli rice fish and it was a solid performer. With some sweet pickled cabbage it tasted very good.   This restaurant is nicely decorated. Modern with dark/reddish wood overtones. The place is very clean an the service was spot on. They have a bar/counter area seating that overlooks the kitchen. Pretty cool design. The glasses they use for beverages are shaped like mini pitchers. Ultra cool.   If you are contemplating on trying this place. Have no fear and go ahead. Make sure you try the beef stew noodle soup. Get a Groupon and it will be worth it."}
{"text":"The menu is quite varied there are a lot of choice. The food is good and the price is reasonable too."}
{"text":"Ordered pancake, ground pork shrimp noodle soup, and spicy beef stew CM. Love it! Especially spicy beef stew CM, very tasty! Also had some ice tea and milk tea."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Resteraunt . Food is great , people are awesome . Very nice stuff . We come here a lot times ;)  really enjoy the Food , and always have a good time ."}
{"text":"I haven't found another restaurant like this one so clean and special. Food is tasty and creative. Service is great too.  2nd visit: not only the taste but also the looks of the food have improved. I ordered some black fungus salad, dumpling, and popcorn chicken, skewered lamb. They are all very tasty!"}
{"text":"Love the spicy wonton and stir fried string bean noodles. Beef soup noodle is good too. The only thing that isn't as authentic enough is the Taiwanese styled minced pork rice. Service was good too."}
{"text":"My girlfriend loved it, but lemme tell you the whole truth and nothing but the truth.   Worth the read!  Operations review: First, the female chef/cook came out of the back several times talking on her iPhone and touching her personal phone. (Any fellow biology major, health food professional, or parent knows precisely how dirty that is) her hands went straight from her phone to wrapping and making some type of egg roll. Never washing her hands. This for me was a red flag.   The kitchen is shielded only by glass, & so I purposely made eye contact with her as she put her phone down on the counter aka the food prep line. She just looked down, but continued to use her iPhone in the kitchen throughout the service.   The waiter was a young boy that seemed inexperienced as a waiter. Very sweet young man, but clearly not a server. Hence, the service was slow, had to flag him down every time, water was left empty, had to ask for everything including to-go box and check. I should mention that he was on his own as far as front of house. He was the host, waiter, and busser. Unfair to him as an employee and myself as a patron. We sat ourselves and grabbed our own menus.   Unfortunately, the cute little glass pitchers they serve tea in and tiny little Asian inspired decor on the table aren't enough to win me over after service like that and the food wasn't great either...  OH! ALSO, IT TOOK FOREVER FOR FOOD TO COME OUT AND PLATES COME OUT AT TOTALLY SEPARATE TIMES.  What we ordered: Beef & onion Pancakes  Chicken & steak skewers Chicken chow mein Orange chicken with white rice   Bill total: $36 and change   Food review:  Pancakes were a bit soggy. I saw a video review on Yelp draining them, but I figured it was because it was beef and onions and they're bound to cause liquid. Nope. The plate was totally wet under them. Fine, okay. However, the flavor was in consistent. We had two cakes cut in halves. My gf ate one half and was going on and on, but I was having a hard time getting it down. Something terribly strong and overpowering everything else was in mine. Then we noticed she grabbed hers from opposite end. She tasted mine and couldn't eat it either. Weird.   Chicken and steak skewers were cooked fine, and others may enjoy them but the seasoning was over the top for me. You could visibly see that they were covered in seasoning.   Chicken chow mein was delicious my gf said. It looked good.   Orange chicken was crispy, but ultimately tasted like they buy the same bottle of \"Orange chicken glaze\" that I do at the supermarket when I make it at home. That was disappointing.   Service 3/10 Food 5/10 Price point 9/10 Cleanliness 3/10  Likely to return? Probably not."}
{"text":"This was terrible service, the language barrier was bad but I understood since it was a Chinese restaurant. Happen to get the wrong food when ordered. Also gave them another chance after waiting 35 minutes for forgotten food. To top it off they forgot my to go food that my son had ordered which led us to paying and leaving. \"NEVER GO BACK\" !!!!bad service!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The milk tea was great and the service was good, cucumber salad is a must. Recommend beer and broccoli combo"}
{"text":"I was immensely excited when I saw the opening soon sign for Mr. Chopsticks, driving by the neighborhood one day.  We tried it for dinner, and were elated with how fresh everything tasted.  The seasoning was just the perfect amount for the beef/onion steamed dumplings, pork chop rice dish (came w/ my favorite Chinese braised egg), Black fungus \"wood ear,\" and shredded chicken cold noodle. I want to take my parents there soon. And the staff members were amicable and warm."}
{"text":"The scallion pancakes are outstanding.  They're crispy, light and tasty.  We also had steamed buns, signature beef noodles, chicken and mushroom noodles, and beef roll.  Everything was very tasty.  The place looked clean and service was very friendly.  The food takes a little longer to come out but it's probably because everything is made to order."}
{"text":"First time here and me and my wife loves it.  The food taste great the portions are good size and the people are friendly.  People should really try this place out because I thought it was going to be a regular Asian place, but it turned out fantastic I would come back again and tell others about this place no doubt. I don't have pictures of my food which I wish I did, but i inhaled it before I could, lol that's how good the food is"}
{"text":"Not a fan. It was way Too Greasy and heavy for me. I ordered the Mongolian beef, wonton soup, onion pancakes, combination fried rice, Lychee green tea with boba and some other pork dish. I requested to use a less salt. It was still too salty.  All the dishes were oily. I received my green tea with literally 10-12 boba balls. Looks like they put one teaspoon of boba. I was charged $3.49 + $.50 for the drink.  Never coming back here."}
{"text":"If you're looking for some good \"quick\" Chinese food that's not the American take out version you will certainly find it here. Spicy wontons are amazing! As well as the tiny pots of goodness.   It really hits home, but of course not as good as mama's  but it's good enough!!  If I was a local I probably would have tried everything off their menu by now.   I'm really craving some Chinese food now!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for good Chinese food near my place and drove by this restaurant. The service was great! Friendly staff and food was delish! Definitely recommend! The beef was tender and the dumpling is so good! I can't wait to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"We ordered eggplant tofu and pepper steak. We got fried rice instead of white rice. Taste really good! Service and setting is good too.  Jasmin green tea was super tasty.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing food!! Staff are very nice, fast service and they deliver now! Their Asian pancakes are delicious, you must try it!"}
{"text":"Great food! Service sucks! Water comes first then menu and table setting, which we need to ask for . ....They definitely need to get that down ....need to work on training their waitress. Maybe it's grand opening ...but will be back to try other goodies and see if service improve."}
{"text":"How do you not provide rice with an entree?? Did take out got home no rice. I called they said it is not included lol. Food is ok last time I go to that place."}
{"text":"So far, I would say that Mr. Chopstix is probably one of the most solidly consistent Chinese restaurants in Vegas, and probably the best one on the southwest.  On the outside of the restaurant, it doesn't seem like much, it just seems like a regular takeout joint. But once you walk inside, the interior is really well done. I think it previously was a café or something. What I also liked was the open kitchen, where you can see everything being made.  After sitting down, the server was there to take the order. I actually came here a couple times so I was able to check out a decent amount of the menu. They do a good mix of traditional styles of food, and food that appeals to a wide variety of people. I'm a sucker for honey walnut shrimp, and I like the one that they made there. I'm not too sure if the batter is traditional or not, but whatevs. I think where they really shine are their more traditional items. The skewers are really good, particularly the lamb and beef ones. I also liked the traditional Beijing noodles, spicy chili wontons, braised pork and eggs, and their Beef pancake appetizer.  This is a really solid restaurant. They might be somewhat tricky to find, but once you get there, I think you'll like it. I believe the prices are fair value and the quality is pretty good."}
{"text":"I came here with my sister once and we end up loving this restaurant. It is near my house and the food and service is very good.  We love spicy food so I ordered everything spicy.  I am here again to get some food for my family. I'm sure they will like it too."}
{"text":"This place was a last minute choice last Christmas Day and was open so we ordered take out it was really all delicious we decided to eat in 3 months after. As soon as we sat down the girl asked if we'd been there before,we said not as far as dinning in, she immediately said if we yelp them we'd get a free appetizer so of course we said ok sure (Free). Food was bland and clams fishy nasty  never again sometimes free isn't good and neither was Mr. Chopstick"}
{"text":"It started with a quizzical name that olfactory disorder that was permeating the air. I conceded victory to my luncheon companion when she bullseyed it with \"dirty mop\" and soon we found each other staring at the other with that silent, yet unmistakable half rolling bug eyed glare that suggested we could be embarking on a potential dining apocalypse. But I was determined to stay put, I had a Groupon and a mad hankering for onion pancakes.   Prior to ordering, I showed our server the Groupon only to be told they no longer accept them and they have canceled their contract with them. Some muttering about 20% now 40% and heavy sighs and you don't knows. Yeah, okay and I don't really need to know, life is full of ambiguity and I'm already there and I still want onion pancakes.   Our server was soon joined by another server or cook or passerby (as I mentioned, I had full on embraced ambiguity and was reluctant to deviate from that stance) to aid in the onion pancake ordering. There was picture pointing, asking how many pancakes came in an order, how big were they, there was this same process over and over and over again. Brain surgery should be this complicated, not onion pancake ordering.   Then, for ambiguous reasons, we got another server and with that came renewed hope and we went on to order the rest of our meal. It felt like a new dawn, so I asked her about the Groupon, oh yes, they honor them. Then my friend also had a surge of optimism to ask for a new plate, since our previous server ran his fingers all around hers to demonstrate pancake size during the pancake ordering.  We enthusiastically pointed to the rest of our order under the impression that we were understood.   Pointing worked in China, I figured it would work at Mr Chopstix, I figured wrong.    Our different fathers, same mother ice green teas arrived; different colors, but similar in taste. Then came the soup we never ordered and sent back, followed by the lunch specials we didn't order, but decided to keep and eat because it was all too difficult and exasperating at this point to do otherwise.   Then came the great debate when our server asked how the food was and my friend nonchalantly told her it was fine, but not what she ordered. Then came the menu back at our table and the server pointing at the wrong meal and my friend flipping a few pages forward to show her the right meal; the culmination of the ultimate not on the same page moment.   In fairness, the server tried to get us to reorder our meals, but we were fine with what we had, which I think might have been chicken and broccoli and orange chicken, all a bit too greasy, but ok, the onion pancakes, though not stellar were good enough to rate a solid 7.   Whose meal is this anyway concluded with a greatly discounted final bill that was a gesture not requested, but unambiguously appreciated."}
{"text":"It was my first time here after looking at the newspaper advertisement. Ordered kung pao chicken rice, beef noodle soup, and beef with onion gyozas and all were pretty decent. Its like a normal Chinese restaurant with different fusion. This restaurant vibe is clean and edgy and the server were friendly. I would come here again. But I have to say their beverage glass is so cute."}
{"text":"Came in here because of a horrible customer service experience @ JJanga across the parking lot. (took Jjanga over 25 minutes for them to come to get our order so we left since we only had a 60 minute lunch break.)  Apparently the lunch Gods were not looking down on us this day. As the service was horribly slow here as well as we had to flag her down to order when there was only 1 other person in the venue. I asked for separate checks when we sat down & ordered our drinks. Most Chinese places are fairly fast on getting your food out. Had to ask if there were lunch specials. Waitress said it was the Special Rice pages on the menu that were supposed to come with the soup of the day, some kind of pickle & something else. As I write this I realize we never got the soup of the day or the other stuff that was supposed to come with the lunch special. $9 for a lunch special isn't really that great of a deal IMHO when there are so many other places that have fast service, good food for less than that price. Service was slow. Each plate came out by itself. The food was not that warm at least mine was not. When check came it was all on 1 bill. I mentioned to the waitress that we asked for separate checks when we started ordering. She gave me kind of a peeved look when I mentioned this but she did separate them for us. None of us had cash on us so we all needed to pay with a card.The place worked since we had bailed in Jjanga because of service & it was in the same parking lot. Unfortunately not a repeatable venue."}
{"text":"I have been in China for 17 years. I really love Chinese cuisine. Almost every day i ate Chinese food in restaurants in Beijing to Hong Kong, in China. I recently returned to the States in January.  I discovered \"Mr. Chopstix today. It's comforting to see Chinese families eating in a Chinese restaurant like Mr. Chopstix. It means there is a reason. The kitchen was open and clean. The decorations were comfortable and inviting. The best part was the food. It's rare to find good, genuine Chinese food in America. And what put it over the top was the quality of the food. Reasonable prices, cheaper than most restaurants in Chinatown.  I enjoyed the pulled pork and chive (in special sauce) on homemade toasted muffins. The lamb sticks were superior to China because the meat is a higher quality. The Beijing noodles with bean and meat sauce was great too. This was authentic Chinese and you can find the same dish in Beijing. The staff watched and served the table well and had a cheerful character.                  we will come back!  Gong xi fa cai!!!"}
{"text":"I was denied ordering a lunch special on Monday, February 19th, Presidents Day.  No where on their menu does it state lunch specials are not applicable on a week day holiday.    The male server did not handle the situation well at all.  I am a loyal customer, but left in disgust!"}
{"text":"Great place to have Chinese food in SW Las Vegas.   If you live in SW and dont want to drive to Spring Mtn.  This is the place to go."}
{"text":"AC was broke so it was toasty inside. Brought us to a table and then changed their mind and moved to another. Didn't ask if we wanted drinks(water would be nice with no air) waited 10 minutes to take order, still didn't ask if we wanted drinks. Had to stop waitress from walking away to get water and ice tea. While waiting for food listened to EDC music pounding through the speakers for that authentic Chinese feel. Then food for me and my wife came out 5 minutes apart, so mine was cold before I could start. Food was excellent, thus 2 stars. But while eating waitress watch us like an ax murderer from behind the kitchen glass. We were finished eating and watched as out waitress walked around the restaurant jabbering on her cell phone....she finally picked an empty table to sit at which was dirty. The family that came in was brought to that particular table, so the cell phone conversation was interrupted. Instead of hanging up she just moved to another empty table which was clean, and continued phone call. So somebody else cleaned the dirty table. WHY NOT TAKE THEM TO THE CLEAN ONE!??? It seamed they had lots of employees doing nothing. No management. P.S. The booth benches are about 2 feet from the table, so sit at the edge of your seat to eat...good luck"}
{"text":"They refuse to do delivery if you don't call basically when they first open.  They close at 930, which is unusual. We called one time for delivery at 9, and they said no it was too late. Then we tried to call tonight at 745, and they said no again that it was closing in hour and 45 minutes. Really?!?@? I can see calling right before close, but almost 2 hours before? Tons more places more hospitable. Order from them!"}
{"text":"The pancake hype is real! Mr. Chopstix may have a silly name but they are super serious about their pancakes. Sit at the bar to watch your order get made fresh in their open kitchen. The pork and chive is my choice but the beef/onion version gets a lot of raves too. Feel your anticipation build as you watch the chef stretch and form the dough, scoop and stuff the filling, shape your pancake, and slap it on the grill. Then wait what seems like forever, because these juicy babies take awhile. But they are worth the wait: piping hot, savory pockets best enjoyed with a heap of chili oil. I recommend getting your own order because it will be hard to share. Better yet, just make this your entire order. Add on a couple of lamb skewers if you want, but really the pancakes are what you came here for. And the cute drink cups.   TIP: There's a back seating area with more privacy, if you didn't come here to stare down the cooking staff and inhale your food."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I randomly popped in here a few weeks ago. I live right around the corner from here, and I never really noticed this place was here, but it was poppin'. I'm pretty picky with Chinese food, but I thought the food was really good, especially the spam and pineapple fried rice. The menu has a good variety of options, including sweet pancakes and milk tea with boba. The owner helps out his wait staff, and the customer service is excellent - the waitress/host was very attentive, and the staff even went out of the way to provide us with the wifi password. I love the look/design of the place, and the fact that you can see right into the kitchen while they are making your food. The bathroom was super clean. The look/vibe of the whole place is really nice, and it's definitely affordable. This place is a new favorite of mine."}
{"text":"5 stars. Although the food comes pretty quickly, it's NOT fast food. Very fresh and handmade to order in the glassed in kitchen. Watch it being made. Very authentic Chinese food. $8.49 for the braised pork and egg and it was delicious! Potstickers were rolled and fried right in front of me, fresh. Big portions and excellent service. I'll be working my way through this menu. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"wait so long time?Security is very bad?After dinner out of my car in front of a crack in the windshield was smashed?never come back? and shave ice is not good? ?never come back again. I was so disappointed"}
{"text":"I gave 5 star rating because the place was very clean,  the waitress was friendly and the food was excellent. My wife and friends agree with my comments."}
{"text":"My go to place for our weekend family lunch ! The green bean dishes , beef noodle soup,and pots stickers are our favorites. It's great not having to go to Chinatown for some good Chinese food :) the dishes are homemade and fresh !!"}
{"text":"I always pass by this restaurant and I finally decided to give this place a try. Food was good! I got the signature beef noodle soup and it was delicious. The broth was good, the beef was cooked right, and super filling. My boyfriend and I got steamed pork dumplings. It was ok. Nothing to rave about.  We also got beef and onion pancakes but it didn't come out until after we were done with our soup so we just had it to go.  Customer service was ok. There was only one server and it was pretty busy too. He forgot to add boba to my milk tea drink too. Speaking of boba, the boba tasted weird. I think they might of cooked it too long and the texture felt weird after biting into it.  Definitely will be coming back since it's nearby. Hopefully customer service will be better then."}
{"text":"Really nice ambience. Seems clean and i liked the open kitchen! Ordered the spicy beef soup and it was sooo good! Should totally try that. Though, the pancakes were hard to eat with either chopsticks or fork... had to use my hands"}
{"text":"This review is for service, or lack thereof. I'm perplexed why this place is even open at lunchtime, it felt deserted and the service backed that up. I took two friends here who aren't Asian and felt thoroughly embarrassed by the blatant priority placed on Asian patrons who walked in after us and served before us. I hate to see this happen and felt that it was true when two other non Asian patrons who came in after us had to physically look for a waiter to take their order and then get up again to ask for an ETA on their food and a third time to cancel their order due to the long wait. Seriously disgusted by the obvious disregard for their customers who aren't Asian. Our table was served but only I received my food while my guests had to wait and finally insist that I go ahead and eat while they had to cancel their orders which from our vantage point looking into the empty kitchen, was evidently not being prepared. I took mine to go and left with my friends."}
{"text":"The most annoying waitress ever. It's frustrating that it seems like we don't understand the menu when she's the one barely speaking or understanding English. I'm not condemning someone learning the language just understand the frustration here. She also served us only 2 servings of water when we're 3 people. She unwrapped our straws too!! How sweet but don't u think I'd like to do it myself and I don't want people touching the tip of the straw where I'm going to put my mouth? I ordered one skewer of lamb and one skewer of beef and she looked annoyed and asked \" just one?\". Yes just one of each coz that's all I can eat for my diet or I'll have allergies where u won't be able to help me if I break out! Btw FYI that's not just what we ordered. Then my son wanted just a side of boba and lychees jelly but she refused to sell us the sides unless you buy the drink. Meh! But to order other sides like wanton it's ok? Ok but understand that there's only milk tea and tea drinks in the menu that's not good for kids so according to her I should still order a tea just so I can have the .50c boba for my son? Smh. There's not even a normal slush or I would have gotten my son one just so we can have the boba balls and lychees jelly. The environment is cool and modern looking but for the service we won't be back. I'll review my food when I get it lol, but I don't think it will raise any star either way. I'll just stick to my old boba place for boba drinks and Asian food. My family is done eating their food and I still yet have to receive my skewers, while my rice that was served prior is cold already! She never came to ask how was everything. Funny coz she screwed up the order near our table too! She kept saying \"u ordered chicken right ?\"to the customer while the woman kept saying\"noodle soup!\", while just like me the customer still yet have to receive the order, lol. Then another server came and asked if it was to go and it wasn't rofl. That made me laugh at least although in the mean time I'm annoyed and starving since my food is not on the table yet and my family is all done and can't wait to go home. Giving this place a star....asked a to go box for my food that finally arrived after 40 and since my family is done, I'm leaving. Told the other guy server, to whom I've asked the to go box about the food that came late, my rice cold and that I didn't even have a cup of water and still even from  him I didn't get offered or brought one cup!  Then she came to refill the two cups of water and still didn't realized we're 3 people and only two cups are on the table!!! Woman were leaving and u pretend to give a good service with refilling our cups before we leave ?!? Unbelievable!! Not even a discount btw!!wtf!  --later at home .....the to go skewers were fatty and super spicy full of pepper flakes which in the menu didn't say it was. I ordered 1 lamb and one beef and I got 2 lamb skewers instead."}
{"text":"Pot stickers, Green bean chicken and orange chicken. Everything is delicious.  Good service.   We've been here a number of times and ordered take out. Food is always great.  Best Chinese in the Southwest.  Check them out!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service and not over-priced..  Ordered orange chicken, pork potstickers and chicken chowmein.. (Big portions) Not greasy, not your typical Chinese food.. Tastes much healthier.."}
{"text":"Mr. Chopsticks is in good restaurant with pretty good food. It is definitely not a culinary Cuisine, but it's a good place to take your family on a budget and still have good food. The service is pretty good, they do try hard."}
{"text":"I have not once set foot in this restaurant, but the food I've tried from delivery orders has been enough for me to confidently give it 5 stars.   The food compared to other nearby Chinese restaurants that provide delivery service is exceptional. The same goes for the variety. The range goes from your usual delivery items (orange chicken, walnut shrimp, fried rice) that have so far all been well prepared to an extensive selection of noodle soups and beautifully braised dishes.   Oh and they have the beef rolls. I can stay at home on the couch looking like a walking sweat pants-clad disaster and can have a crisp, clean, and delicious beef roll brought to me. No leaving the house. No trekking out to China Town. All 99% Asian of me is thrilled (shout out to 23andme).   It can be difficult to enjoy the noodle soups packed in to-go containers, but I cling to my laziness, hunker down at the coffee table, and make due. It's delivery night people. I'm watching TV while this is going down. The spicy beef noodle soup is my favorite, so far. The beef is fall apart tender. The broth is actually spicy (not \"spicy\"), but has great, complex flavor. And everything comes together with chewy noodles, pickled greens, and salty, roasted peanuts.   Delivery is amazingly prompt. Even early.   I'm looking forward to enjoying dining in soon."}
{"text":"The beef roll is excellent?the beef noodle is also very delicious?nice place? nice food?"}
{"text":"2nd time this week! Yummers! Have the chow mein its awsome! Not salty, not oily im so happy its close to our house!"}
{"text":"Our first time getting food from here and we're disgusted! Greasy, oily Chinese pancakes. See the video for yourself. They charge $1.99 for skewers so I ordered 2 chicken gizzard skewers, which actually ended up looking like only 2 gizzards cut up! What the heck?! See the pic for yourself. That's what I paid for? Really??! I guess we won't be eating  here again and I'll be sure to let our many friends know as well. I posted the pic and video, just look under my name."}
{"text":"Found this place, enjoying food & drink; will come back again for sure!  Excellent service and nice staff, I ordered Eggplant with chicken with rice & soup.  I like what I ordered."}
{"text":"Not very good Chinese food.   Did not like the flavors in the food that I ordered.  Started with the spicy wantons with pork.   They were decent, wouldn't order them again.   The quality of the meat in the lamb skewers were okay but I didn't enjoy the seasoning and deep down it's hardly any meat.   For an entrée I had the Mongolian beef.    You can get the entree version for $9.99 (it doesn't even come with rice, WTF) or get the rice one for $8.50, which does come with rice but the portion is half the size.    I would definitely never come back to this place, but almost everyone else seems like to like it.  Maybe my tastebuds are broken.   But feel free to try it for yourself.     About to eat the leftovers now but I don't even want them.   My face is very sad about this."}
{"text":"Just walked out of this place. My husband and I walked in at 1:30om no one greeted us we stood there for about 7mins there was two people standing by the register a larger built lady playing in her phone watching some sort of videos. We continued to look around every single table was dirty. There was not one cleaned table in here. It also smelled like sewer so my husband and I looked at each other and said Let's get outta here! If they can't even bus tables how would I trust what's going on in that kitchen?! We are on our way to Noodle Man!"}
{"text":"Everyone should try this place! If you like orientation Chinese food, definitely should come over here. Everything is good! Can't make any mistakes. Everything is made out sketch. Recommend to all my friends for sure!"}
{"text":"We been here on Wednesday, me and my girlfriend order chicken skewers, noodles and some appetizers. The food is good, you can taste different variety of Chinese food. Be honestly, it is hard to find this kind of cuisine in Las Vegas, it is the cuisine from South of China."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Excellent service! We had the pork and chive dumplings, beef and onion pancakes, the seaweed salad, spicy beef stew and lamb skewers. Every item was so flavorful and delicious. The fresh dumplings which are made to order literally burst in your mouth. You also have the option to sit at the bar to watch the chef prepare your dishes. They have a lot of traditional Asian street food and they cook them to perfection. The customer service was top notch. They answered all of our questions and made sure everything was up to par. By far one of the most delicious places to dine in las vegas. Thanks guys"}
{"text":"the food is awesome,I like the ambience of the place too.I like their beef stew pot.their beverage cup is cool too"}
{"text":"Very authentic, they make their own noodles and dumplings to boot! Don't be fooled by the simple name.  Not as authentic as having insects on the menu but they have some dishes that are must haves; Taiwanese chicken curry (potatoes are so good), sparerib green bean rice plate, eggplant chicken chow mein, skewers, there's lots of goodies on there.  If you are adventurous there is some ground for you to cover too...chicken gizzard entree is gooood (if you like that sort of thing).  And if you're not adventurous there's plenty of Western stuff on the menu too. -a friend had walnut shrimp which was the best I've ever had. Another had Kung pao which wasn't great, but I'm not really into the Western dishes, too sweet for my tastes.  You can tell the ingredients are all top notch and the different components to a dish (bell peppers, onions, green veg and protein) are all cooked perfectly, every time; it's quite difficult as they cook fast, at high temperatures and each component has a much different cooking time.   I've eaten here many times and ordered delivery, every time it's spot on.    Fantastic food, friendly service, consistent, amazing meals."}
{"text":"Really good authentic Chinese food. The place is clean. I like how you can see them making the food. Everyone is wearing hats and gloves as they should be. Even the guy on the wok is wearing gloves and he doesn't technically need them.   I ordered the pot stickers and fried rice, both were excellent! They make their own dumpling dough fresh and you can watch them make the dumplings. The fresh dough as opposed to the frozen kind that most places use makes a huge difference. The dough is fluffy, flavorful, and moist. The fried rice was made to order so it was fresh and had lots of eggs which I loved. Most Chinese places make the fried rice in large batches so it sits under a heat lamp drying out. The fried rice isn't covered in soy sauce either. It's white not brown.   Service is overly friendly, multiple people greeted me to make sure I was taken care of.  This is not a fast food Chinese place, it's a sit down restaurant where you can expect good, fresh food, made to order, made in a clean environment unlike the places in Chinatown which are full of roaches .    There are a few misspellings on the menu, but that's how you know it's real Chinese food, made by real Chinese people."}
{"text":"Tried many dishes here and liked all of them. My favourites are the pan fried pork buns and lamb skewers.  My kids loved the minced pork rice. Service was good, will definitely be back to try more dishes."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing.  This is my 6th visit and have been very satisfied with the quality, quantity and price.    With that said half of my visits have had really terrible service.   Waitresses were inattentive and had to ask several times for a napkin and refills.  We will continue to try it out in hopes the service improves."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, among the best we have had anywhere. You must visit Mr.  Chopstix! Large portions prepared nicely.  They have some new regulars!"}
{"text":"I came here on a Saturday to use my Groupon. I like the location since it's not a super crowded parking lot. The inside has really nice decor and the tables are not spaced too close together.  We sat in a quiet corner because we had our baby. There was lots of room around us in case we needed to get up and rock him.  Anyway, the food was good! I love salt and pepper pork chops and they did not disappoint. I got the fried rice that had salted fish in it. It was my fault for ordering this cause it really was very salty. Overall, the rice was good, just wouldn't order it again. Potstickers were just okay.  Sodas are served at $1.79 per can! Eek!  The snow ice had a hefty price of $11.99! It was a large portion, but sheeesh. We got mango and strawberry; we liked them both equally. The mangoes tasted fresher than the strawberries though.  I'd go here again, especially for the salt and pepper pork chops! Plus, super friendly service!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Loved the food. Staff is super nice as well! They have great authentic Chinese food. The ambiance is super nice as well. They are close to where I love. A real wonderful neighborhood Chinese food spot."}
{"text":"very dissapointed. it took 15 minutes for anyone to acknowledge me sitting in the dining room only to tell me that 2 large tables meant getting a 2 item order would take 45 minutes. really? sad"}
{"text":"Im really picky on Chinese food sometimes its too greasy other times too salty, but this is was great! The beef chow mein was perfectly seasoned, try the lamb and chicken skewers to good! And not to mention their dumplings, we had the pork with shrimp it great too best Chinese restaurant in the area!"}
{"text":"First time trying out this place for lunch. Staff were very friendly and ambiance gives you the feel of culture.   Items ordered: pork and chives steam dumplings Zhajiang Noodles Dan Dan noodles  All were great dishes! Well presented, had lots of flavor! Would definitely come back here next time to try the other dished on the menu."}
{"text":"Great place to eat at. Amazing customer service. 20/10 recommend. You will not regret coming here!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Chinese food. Great prices, great portion sizes, great service. My husband and I split: pork and cabbage pancakes, shrimp and chicken skewers, cold noodles, and the chicken with mushrooms off the specials menu. Everything was well seasoned and taste. The dishes come out add they are tau so it arives to your table hot. They do have a take out menu but we live close enough we will just be back soon! Great new local find."}
{"text":"Got a Groupon for Mr. Chopstix so my friend and I went to check it out last night.  To start off we ordered water and I got a Thai Tea. Nothing over the top with it, not too sweet, but tastes as expected.  For the meal I ordered the Braised Pork and Egg and my friend got the Lamb Stir Fry with Green Onions and Szechuan Pork. The entrees came with white rice. The Braised Pork and Egg has amazing rich flavor a lot of it coming from the fat on the pork. The meat was tender and the fat just melted in your mouth. The same goes with the Lamb Stir Fry minus the fat.The Szechuan Pork was primarily a stir fry of vegetables with some pork. It seemed like there wasn't enough pork after working through all the vegetables.   The service here was substandard. The waiters did not really check with us throughout our meal. We had to flag down our waiters to get refills on waters. It may have been because there was an hour before closing so maybe I can't be too strict on them.  The pricing is a little pricey, but I think the taste justifies it. I'd probably come back to try their other food and compare their orange chicken to other Chinese places."}
{"text":"Every time I try a new place I always have low expectations of food,drinks and etc.  So it turn out better then I expected, YAY!!!  It's very nice and clean, a bonus that you can watch them make the food.  The price is very reasonable for the portion.  My whole family really like the noodle , especially the  w beef shank.. very spicy(gave me  burns) and so much flavor.. they add  so if you're allergic tell them not to add it.  Next time I would like for them to not make it too salty other then that it's by far the BEST  beef noodle in Vegas..   Surprisingly the orange chicken was super crunchy and not over powering w vinegar.  The kids and hubby love  it!    Mongolian beef 3/5... beef was not very  tender(some pieces were very chewy)   Pork and scallion pancakes 3/5 were just OK!    Mango green tea 5/5. Very strong, light and refreshing!  Definitely coming back SOON!   They also have Groupon special so don't forget.."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place because the reviews all looked good. We ordered a few things so I will just go down my list. First off the soup that I ordered wasn't closed properly and spilled all in the bag and my car. Annoying just from the start!   Egg drop soup- besides it spilling it lacked flavor! Actually NO  Flavor at all! Took one taste, and it was in the garbage! Never had egg drop soup that tasted so bad.  Pork and cabbage pancakes: SOOOO OILY!! They must of taken them out of the fryer and threw them into the box because I had to soak them in paper towels myself. Wasn't anything special. Needed more flavor!  Wonton & chicken soup: this was extremely bland, just like the egg drop! The broth tasted really funny. I threw it away. Asked for no seaweed, guess they most of forgot.   Chicken Skewers: I totally didn't even think they were chicken, looked like sausage. Small pieces with no skewers. Totally tasted like package taco seasoning. Weird I know! Lol   Pot stickers: Just ok nothing special.  Orange chicken: Just ok nothing special, over cooked but not nasty.  Sweet and sour chicken: This was over fried and still a bit oily! But I opted for fried rice instead of white, totally the wrong move! The rice was white, they clearly decided not to add soy sauce! Zero flavor! I can make better fried rice and I'm Italian!   This post isn't to be mean, or talk crap, the food was just not good!! I wouldn't eat here again! I was the most disappointed in the soups, because I know Asian soups are so delicious! Won't be back ever! I rather have Pei Wei!"}
{"text":"Ordered food for pick up. Get here 30 minutes after ordering. My food is ready except for the one item that takes 25 minutes to make. And guess what. They haven't even started it. So now while my food gets cold I have to sit and wait for the last item. And I can't cancel it because it was done online with a credit card.   So I finally got the food home. The pancake with the beef and onion basically tasted like an Asian hamburger wrapped in potsticker dough wasn't bad but wasn't amazing. Definitely not worth 45 minutes to an hour. Then I got to the braised pork noodles. Holy cow. It was a starred dish on their menu so I had high hopes. I bit into the first piece of \"pork\" and it was all fat. I looked through all of the pieces and they were all the same. Absolutely no meat, just fat. I love pork belly but this wasn't even close to that, it was braised pork fat. I wanted to through up with the first bite. Luckily the Mongolian beef was decent, I pulled out all of the pork from the noodles and added the beef. That made a pretty good dish. All in all I will give this place another chance. The flavors were there the execution just sucked. No way will I order that braised pork again though."}
{"text":"The best fried rice in the area! So much flavor. And the chili oil is great. (Not too spicy but I used it sparingly) this was my first time trying this place it was pretty empty but the food is delicious. What a hidden treasure."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty. Service was good. We like the spare ribs and green bean chow mein, also enjoyed their green onion pancake, the beef noodle stew, spicy cucumber and spicy dumplings. All the portions were large."}
{"text":"Finally - the crispy, spicy tofu I've searched all of Las Vegas for!   After reading some very convincing reviews from some trusted Yelpers and seeing the great looking photos posted, my husband and I had dinner here. We definitely over-ordered because we were so excited to try everything. All the leftovers we had were still great the next day! Their crispy tofu was just the right amount of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and the spices and garlic they used made each bite full of flavor. The green onion pancake was a very generous portion and made fresh. The Chinese sausage fried rice, with also had corn and bean sprouts, was one of the standout dishes. The rice was still very fluffy and all the different flavors went well together. I don't even like bean sprouts (especially in Vietnamese or Japanese cuisine), but it worked well here. I also had the sweet and sour chicken, which was not too greasy and reheated well the next day. My husband was raving about the honey walnut prawns and how the mayo flavor was really well fused into the batter.   The service was very attentive and I was happily surprised at the modern decor inside. This restaurant is definitely a step above the China One-esque establishments in the valley, both in food offering and ambiance. Everyone we dealt with was friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. My husband ran out to get my jacket because I was feeling a bit cold, but an employee noticed him hand me the jacket and promptly turned down the fan. Everything, including the kitchen you can see into, was very clean and our leftovers were packed up for us.   It looks like there is something for everyone to enjoy on the menu and I hope this place continues to thrive!"}
{"text":"Our friends highly recommended this small restaurant, and we were not disappointed. We ordered two main dishes: Beef noodle soup (???,$8.50) and Szechuan DanDan Noodle (?????,$8.55). Both were Mouthwatering. Pancake (?? $5.50) was absolutely delicious; Salt & Pepper Chicken (???, $6) extraordinary; Spicy Wonton (????, $7.50), very tasty and Black Fungus (???, $6), yummy.  We enjoyed it very much. The service was very responsive and cordial. The setting and decoration of the restaurant were stylish."}
{"text":"I order a spice beef noodle and pork chive pancake are very well tasted. But I call for delivery and I order twice which first time have chapstick and napkins but the second time they forgot to put it which I decided to give four stars."}
{"text":"This is the best beef noodle soup that I've had in Vegas. I've been to Shang's. I've been to Noodle Man. Been to various pho places, various ramen places. Enjoyed them all. This is king for now. The broth impressed me most. Usually beef broths are a bit meh to me. This one was full of flavor with well-made noodles (they make em in-house) and a good portion of tasty beef. It's not super spicy but the flavor was so good I didn't feel like adding any extra.   The lamb skewers remind me of the toothpick lamb at Chengdu Taste. Really good. $2/skewer. Not necessarily cheap, but definitely worth trying to know if you'd like an entrée size quantity (Trying to spilt that with someone next time). This place also has a more expansive menu than most places known for having good Chinese noodle soup to the point where it's more like a Chinese restaurant that happens to have good noodle soup.   Also the pork and chive pancakes with some chili oil are as good as everybody says. Heard good things about the salt and pepper wings but haven't tried them myself.  I don't usually give fives and I'm afraid this place will get too popular, but based of the food I've eaten and the lack of a wait. This gets that five outta five, baby"}
{"text":"Sigh*  It's rare that I'll take the time to write something negative about a place.  Mother taught me,  \"if you don't have nothing nice to say; don't say anything at all.\" BUT this has to be known...  Let's start with the miniature pitchers they offer as glasses.  Ultimately very cute and original however, why are they serving Boba straws with my glass of water.  If I was a coke head I'd love these straws, you know what I mean... jk.    The layout of the entire restaurant seemed like a giant waste of space. I understand you're highlighting your visible kitchen with a bar, very hipster-ish, however I feel maybe higher table tops would've been a better idea than the 9 inches people are being forced to eat on.  My roommate and I sat at a booth that was lower than the counter top so the kitchen view was pretty much useless. Oh and I saw a review where they said authentic Chinese cooks.... I guess they were all off today.  The service was mediocre at best.  First time, so I asked for recommendations.  Waiter instead asked what I liked and pointed it out on the menu.  Not what I was going for but hey, at least it's something.  He was able to name a dish in a picture we showed him from yelp. Kudos to him for that.  I was a little disappointed on how long we would have to wait for our food since there was only one additional family eating in the restaurant who already had their food.  I was warned though it was going to be at least 20 minutes for the pancakes. So I guess I can't be too upset about it."}
{"text":"Don't bother. Americanized Chinese food has a pizza joint look and feel. The waitress is super cute and bubbly though.  I ordered the signature beef pot it tasted more Irish than Chinese."}
{"text":"Service is good. Food is great, not salty. Broth is not salty nor bland, just the right taste.  Price is right! Desert. Shave ice mango is the bomb."}
{"text":"The first time we were here was the day after opening. The service was a bit chaotic but the was food amazing.   The entire room is situated around a glass enclosed kitchen. There you can see amazing dishes being created by genuine Chinese staff, and my goodness they know what they're doing. The best dumplings I have had in Vegas are served freshly made and piping hot. Our favorite are the pork and cabbage dumplings. Our Chinese friends say that the casings are just a bit too think, but for us they were spot on.   A bit off-putting to be sure. Our first visit was during the day right after they opened. Food was great; very traditional Chinese fare.   Then the second visit.   They really got their stuff together. The food was even better, the staff was on the ball, the drinks served in the most wonderful small pitchers, and the dumplings even better. I have eaten in most of the high end Asian restaurants in Las Vegas, and no one comes close this place. It really is like being in a small traditional Chinese restaurant. In China. So I'm told.   Give it a try. Enjoy the place And the people. Then thank me after you've had a few dozen dumplings. So so so so very very good."}
{"text":"Very good Chinese food and excellent customer service makes the food taste better. I do recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"Stopped in pretty much on a whim, ordered orange chicken and Mongolian beef. Both were excellent. The host whipped up some spicy wonton for us to try at no charge. That was also fantastic. The service was very good. We were there just before 5 o'clock so it was before the dinner rush. With the food above ordered and only two of us to eat, we took on plenty of leftovers. I live on the far side of town from this restaurant, but if I ever get over on that side I'll be stopping by again. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken eggplant and braised pork with taro both dishes were delicious. This is our second time here and both times the employees were friendly."}
{"text":"Probably the worst take out food I have ever had.  Got my order home and had no rice...what?? The food had no flavor and the chicken was very tough. Still looking for  great Chinese  food"}
{"text":"We finally tried this place after driving by a million times..and we are so glad we did! The have a great variety of dishes. We had the Spicy Pork Wontons and the Pork and Chive potstickers, both were absolutely delicious! They tasted fresh with great flavor, these will definitely be our go-to from now on. Being able to watch them being prepared through the window was an added bonus! We also tried the Kung Pao Beef, Moo Shu Pork and the Bacon Mushroom Fried Rice.. LOL yes we had way too much food, but all made for yummy left overs! All the food was fresh, had great flavor and did not disappoint. Thanks for a great lunch!"}
{"text":"I went to Mr chopsticks yesterday and ordered 5 items and I got 4 items. When I called to see why I wasn't given my fried rice I got passed around to everyone who works at the restaurant and never once was told they were sorry for not giving me an item I paid for. The food is okay, just go to panda express. They scoop it all and you'll get what you actually order."}
{"text":"The only complaint I have about this place is the inconsistent service, but other than that, Mr. Chopstix is the best spot in Vegas for Northern Chinese cuisine. They serve, IMO, the best beef noodle soup in town, and my buddy and fellow yelper John O. (Nkwachukwu) can attest to that. The broth is packed with flavor and spice, and the noodles are hand-made and have the perfect texture. The dumplings here are also on point, whether you get them steamed or pan-fried. I usually get the pork and chives. The lamb skewers are also really tasty (priced at $2 per skewer), but I gotta say that Chengdu does it best with their toothpick lamb. The fried rice is a little bit on the wetter side but also really good. In fact, I'm craving Mr. ChopStix as I'm writing this right now...f*ck me.   I also want to mention that I brought my dad here a couple of weeks ago, and then he went back three more times in the same week haha."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend for dinner since we love trying new Chinese places. This place both has good and bad sides.  This place is located on Fort Apache Road not too far from 215 so it won't be too hard to get there, and the restaurant does offer quite a lot of parking spaces so it shouldn't be hard to park. The restaurant itself isn't so large, but it doesn't get too busy so no problem getting a table.  We decided to try the Orange Chicken and the Honey Walnut Shrimp. The Honey Walnut shrimp was pretty good and the Orange Chicken was ok, even though it really felt like chicken nuggets freshly taken out of the freezer and dipped in an orange sauce... The main problem is that for $8.99 and $11.99, you don't even get some rice or noodles with your main entree, which means that we were both still hungry when we left the restaurant.  One good thing about this place is definitely service. Our waitress was omnipresent and did her best to make our time there as good as possible.  In conclusion, I would say that this place is average but you could still check it out if you're in the area and are craving some Chinese-American food. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant. Mongolian beef was delicious. Great customer service. We will go back."}
{"text":"Service as very slow, waited 20 min for the water we ordered, when we finally got or soup we got no bowls or spoons, we had to ask for napkins that were kit on table, for having six cooks in kitchen was very slow service, maybe for just opening they have some improving"}
{"text":"In love with this restaurant! Good Chinese restaurant, Food is delicious and fresh! Service is excellent and friendly. Come and try here, you won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"We have ordered take out from here twice and eaten at the restaurant once.  This is not your typical Chinese restaurant.  Part of the kitchen is open and visible from most of the restaurant, and you can see how freshly everything is made.  The atmosphere is clean, modern, no clutter.  Really a nice place to be.  We have ordered some \"standard\" Chinese dishes, like the hot and sour soup, and the taste is fabulous.  I think it's the fresh ingredients.  It tastes much better than what you get at 90% of the Chinese restaurants, and at a reasonable price.  We watched them make our green onion pancakes today, and last time I saw my soup being made.  Service is nice too.  They gave me water while waiting for my take out to be finished.  So nice!"}
{"text":"The food is so good! I really like the shake and beef stick. Very warm environment and nice service. I will definitely come back often"}
{"text":"My mom and I decided to grab dinner here after shopping at IKEA nearby. The decor is very modern and clean, and the restaurant a decent size. The food was fairly authentic and served in a more hip setting.  My mom and I both really enjoyed our food, and the menu is fairly extensive. Service was average. Prices fair.   I think is is a nice option if you want this kind of cuisine and you are in the Southwest without having to venture to Chinatown/Spring Mountain Rd."}
{"text":"I have to congratulate for their service and food.  They tried very hard to make me shrimp dumplings when I told them I liked them.  Will go back for more food!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been there twice, the food is great. So far everything we tried was very good and we will definately go back, it 's all very fresh and not salty, a great place to eat when you want to eat out but not blow your healthy eating plan."}
{"text":"This is more of an Americanized Chinese food place. Everything is tasty. The spicy beef for appetizer is tasty. The service is ok. A little slow for the food to come out. Value is not good because the portion is small. I would come again for American Chinese food but not if I want good authentic Chinese food."}
{"text":"This place has gotten better since my first experience...the food is pretty good but their service is bad...first time the service was super slow even though it wasn't busy...2nd time we did go when it was dinner rush I suppose but I didn't get a glass of water till I was half way done with my meal...3rd time which was today we order our meal first and the couple that sat next to us who ordered about 20 mins after we have gotten and eaten their food before we even gotten our one appetizer dish...what sucks is they make stupid excuses as to why the order of the food got mixed up and well I don't know if there will be a 4th...I always like to give a place 3 tries before I give up but here I have given them enough tried to get better in regards to their service"}
{"text":"This has to be the best restaurant I've been to in a long time. The staff are so friendly and so welcoming. The food is AMAZING. The cooks know how to work their magic. I love the fact that the kitchen is open and we get the privilege to see how they cook things. Everything is fresh and tasty. This restaurant needs 6 stars!  We'll definitely be coming here more often."}
{"text":"I literally order their chow mein like every week which I need to stop because it can be a bit greasy but it's my guilty pleasure and sooo good, noodles are made fresh and all the ingredients taste so well put together, I do miss when you guys added the black fungus to it as well but it's still my #1 place in Vegas for chow mein 5 stars guys!!!"}
{"text":"Menu is a bit confusing if you don't read Chinese but is quite varied. Food was tasty and fresh. The food isn't heavily seasoned but the table condiments of hot sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, salt & black pepper let you customize the flavor. We got the onion pancakes, mixed vegetable stir fry with fried tofu, and chicken chow mein.  Another reviewer noted the restaurant has a strange smell like cleaning products when you enter, and it does. They should figure that out because it is a little off-putting. That's the reason for 4-star instead of 5-star."}
{"text":"When I go I like to get their spicy wonton noodle soup....its hard to eat because its slippery, but then again I'm not mr miyagi haha. These guys are great! Ben the owner is also the chef. Great guy making great food!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and it never disappoints.  Tonight got the Seafood Noodle Bowl and Chongqin Spicy Noodle Bowl. We asked for no pork in the Chongqin Bowl and they were able to accommodate without an issue.  Super fresh ingredients and fantastic flavors in both bowls.  The spicy bowl is definitely spicy and will make you cry and/or not feel your lips.  But it's fantastic.  I fully recommend at least giving it a try."}
{"text":"I had a really nice time here the other night! The service here is very friendly, quick, and helpful, and the entrees are really delicious and authentic. Their warm and comforting dishes are perfect on a cold night. My gf and I got the signature beef noodles with the Mapo Tofu. The noodles are to die for- the soup is super flavorful, the noodles were cooked really well, and the beef is very tender and melts in your mouth. The Mapo tofu was just as flavorful. My only complaint would be that I would like more rice with my tofu, but other than that, I highly recommend this place and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Good food , Clean place. Very reasonable prices great portions. Everything was great except pancakes. They get too greasy. But they are ok. MapoTofu great dish. Will come back."}
{"text":"After taking the time to read the menu and figure out what we wanted for dinner, I was unable to place an order anywhere online,  nor was I able to call as no one answered multiple times. Great business!"}
{"text":"Very good authentic Chinese food at a reasonable price. I would not have tried this place because the name kinda implies fast food, Westernized Chinese but this is definitely not the case."}
{"text":"so very good food?i very like chinese pancake&shaved lce&?Boba milk tea!"}
{"text":"Great menu why choices, great service prompt and friendly. The prices were great! Will most definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Food was seasoned well and the taste was very good but the greasiness was really too much.  I ordered the potsticker, pancake and the eggplant tofu chowmein and it all was delicious except that the oil was taking over the dish. At first I was enjoying the flavors but after I was done eating it felt like I gain 20pounds from the oil and it made my stomach ache.  When ordering ask for light oil.! Food was fresh which I liked and the service was good not great but good considering Asian service and I'm Asian so no racist comment here but the truth."}
{"text":"Great pricing , higher quality than I expected, the name led me to believe it was just another fast food Chinese spot . Great tasting food , open kitchen , nice staff. I will return for sure"}
{"text":"Service was great for a Chinese establishment. The menu is Taiwanese influenced. Food is authentic. The kids and I ordered Signature Beef Noodle Soup (meat was a bit fatty but flavor was on point), Tomato Beef Pot was really good too. My favorite had to be the Green Onion Pancake. Came out piping hot & served fresh off the griddle. Texture was crispy and not too thick or thin. One of BEST I've ever had - and I was born in Taiwan! Lol will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"It's really good Sichuan food at the neighborhood. The zhajiang noodle is amazing and the popcorn chicken."}
{"text":"Ever since China Ginger was shut down, my husband and I have been looking for a Chinese restaurant that is of at least some quality. One day we took a risk and decided to try Mr. chopstix. We ordered the special rice plate with orange chicken and it also came with \"pickle salad\" and hot and sour soup. We decided to share being that we were scared due to the other experiences we've had with places around the area of wasting our money on horrible food. Let me tell you! The orange chicken and hot and sour soup were on point! It was so good we ordered the same exact thing the next day! Feeling more confident with this restaurant, we also ordered the special rice plate with Mongolian beef also. The order came to about $18 - totally worth it! We will be eating there until the sun doesn't shine anymore! I highly recommend anyone to try it! I would personally recommend ordering off of the special rice section being that it is the best value. You get a nice portion of steamed white rice, the entrée/meat you ordered, a cup of soup, and the pickled cabbage and carrots (also very good). The service is absolutely amazing they are kind in quick every time! #LifetimeCustomers"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the neighborhood. Don't let the sign fool you, I know it's put a lot of my friends off. The food is amazing, staff is so friendly, the vibe is perfect and you can't beat the price. Try the beef dumplings, cucumber salad, beef noodle soup and honey iced tea!"}
{"text":"authentic and tasty. had the pan fried pork and cabbage and pork and chives dumplings. pork and chives had more flavor than pork and cabbage. the pancakes were delicious as well, not oily. these items takes about 15 min as they are fresh and made to order. was also recommended a mixed noodle with braised pork and black fungus - usually comes with chicken but I asked for pork... that's was quite delicious. service is friendly and attentive and was asked if there's anything they can improve on. will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Our favorite local Chinese restaurant.  Nice, family atmosphere with attentive service and great food."}
{"text":"I recently moved around the area and decided to give this place a try.   The appetizers looked more interesting so we got salt and pepper shrimp, spicy wontons, and minced pork pockets. I really wanted to try the pork fried buns, but they were out for the day.  Salt and pepper shrimp: this is probably one of my favorite things to get at a Chinese restaurant. It lacked flavor and could have used more breading on it. Also the peppers I feel like should have been placed on top. It was hard to finish.   Spicy wontons: probably the one thing I enjoyed. It had good flavor, I would get it again.   Minced pork pockets: left an unsavory amount of oil in the container it came in. Lacked some flavor. It was promising but not as good as I expected.   The service was okay. I felt like they were way more attentive to the family next to us. We very obviously were done with plates because we left it at the edge of the table but I guess they felt like ignoring it.   We left still hungry but didn't feel like We wanted to spend more money here."}
{"text":"Very good food and very clean which is hard to find in an Asian restaurant located in Las Vegas.  I had the potstickers and the Generals Chicken.  Both were very good and my ice tea was refreshing.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has really good food it's just that sometimes in the evenings especially on the west facing wall it gets really really hot in there so I can only say turn up the damn AC mr. Chopsticks please"}
{"text":"Mr. ChopStix is an OK place. I stopped here for a late lunch/early dinner and ordered too much as it turned out.    For an appetizer, I ordered the Chinese pancake with pork and cabbage stuffing.  I ordered noodles dan dan and a mango iced tea.  The meal was brought in reverse.  Since it took longer for the pancakes to be made than the noodles, I got the noodle dish first and as I was eating that, the pancakes were brought. Sometime in between the noodles and the pancake, I asked about the iced tea which had not yet been delivered.  She went to the drink bar area and retrieved an iced tea for me.  When I ordered the noodles, the server checked to make sure I knew they were spicy.  Yes, I knew, but they weren't.  On the tables are condiments common to noodle and rice shops.  Take the red jar of spicy chili pepper and oil and spoon heaping amounts on the noodles if you want your noodles spicy.  The noodles were brought out so quickly they weren't sufficiently heated tasting just a bit over room temperature.  I didn't boiling hot noodles but they should have bene heated more.  The pancakes are definitely a dish to share when there is more than one person but I made the sacrifice and finished both pancakes and the noodle dish.  Except for the drink, service was good and the young woman came by several times to check.  There are plenty of noodle shops in this city that are better and will get my future business.  Mr. ChopStix is OK--just ok."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and the decor is modern and beautiful!  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My kids love their dumplings and potstickers. The first time we ordered take out at the restaurant. They have a glassed in exhibition kitchen. We watched them make dumplings and buns by the dozen. This is not Americanized Chinese food. Everytime we get take out, we try a new item in addition to the tried and true. Last night we tried the beef roll - think steak sandwich with scallions in a flaky crust. Yum. Dine in at least once, get take out/delivery when your soul is weary and craving dumplings."}
{"text":"I would like to say something about their food quality but I never even got to that part! I was planning on ordering for pick up, but upon asking a question that could not be answered by the first person I spoke to, then transferred to another person, I get hung up on! Very poor etiquette !!!! Never coming back."}
{"text":"Great service (for a Chinese restaurant) and very authentic Chinese food. Yelp is saying that this review too short to post (which is silly) so I will quote Neil Peat in his Rock and Roll HOF acceptance speech: blah blah, blah blah, blah blah blah"}
{"text":"I had been to this place for many times, we always ordered the spicy wonton, the best dish in town.  We had tried many different dishes since and never get disappointed.  But one thing we always order when we come is the signature beef noodle soup the best of the best, so rich in flavors and so tender the beef is.  Also mention about the pancake and the hand made potstickers, very fresh and delicious.  My family love this place and we don't have to go to Chinatown any more because it is so close to our home.  I would give 6 stars if possible.  Oh, by the way, try the flavor ice tea too it task so good.  Definitely keep coming back and strongly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Great flavors - loved the lamb skewers. Everything we tried had totally different flavors. The noodles are fresh and each dish we had, had a different kind of noodle. Service was excellent and friendly (which is rare for a Chinese restaurant) - the place is new and super clean (also rare for a Chinese restaurant). We will definitely come back here!!!! ...oh, and try the different teas.  Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place. This is my go to order out Chinese restaurant...good food, big portions at a good price. I really enjoy the Mongolian Beef and Hot & Sour soup."}
{"text":"We live up the street. This is our favorite go to on a Friday night. We love all their food, it's delicious. The service is great. They are really consistent with quality as well!"}
{"text":"Wow surprising last minute option! Delicious! Not ur average Chinese place. Cute decor! Hot and Spicy Pot, pork and cabbage pancake, dan dan noodles! Service was on point too for a Chinese restaurant!"}
{"text":"Only good thing out of chow mein, orange chicken, pork pancakes, spicy beef noodle soup and spicy wontons was the chow mein. Nothing was spicy like it said, the beef soup was just a lite beef broth that had an odd flavor, the wontons tasted like pure Ginger and the orange chicken was nothing special either. Not to mention it left my whole family with an upset stomach! Definitely will not be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"Nice ! My favorite Chinese food , this sea food Toufu is so yummy. Also enjoy the rest food that my friends ordered. Should be go back soon."}
{"text":"Omg! So good. They're so nice and the chicken and shrimp fried rice is the bomb!  We tried it on a Monday and came back twice within the week. I'm very picky about fried rice, but loved it here. It's got the right amount of toastiness, bean sprouts and even comes with a few pieces of broccoli.   M"}
{"text":"So glad I found this place.  You can come for a great lunch special at work, or a nice lunch or dinner.  Excellent noodle soups with generous portions.  Friendly staff and excellent atmosphere.  I'll definitely be a regular here."}
{"text":"We were introduced by a friend recently and I must say we LOVE this place! Great menu, fun ambience, getting to watch the chefs is definitely a highlight. And the food is absolutely amazing made to order right in front of you and shockingly large portions we always leave full and happy."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.   Mr. Chopstix is fairly close by so when I saw that it was opening I was pretty thrilled. The first time we went, they had just opened and service was a bit slow. The owner came from another noodle place which I frequented often as well and he recognized my husband. Service after that has been slightly better, but when we ordered online through Yelp there was a snafu with that so I wouldn't exactly recommend that.   Now I've tried the potstickers, boba tea, beef noodle soup and the braised pork noodles. Overall, the braised pork noodles are my favorite. The potsticker quality has been slowly going down to the point where my last order of potstickers I didn't finish. The potstickers had a funny flavor and it was just meh. The braised noodles have never disappointed though. One time they added spice so it was a bit spicy for this wimp. There is a good ratio of pork and noodle though so well worth it. Boba milk tea was overly sweet with hard boba. Yuck. I would definitely say come for the noodles and hopefully the potstickers was just an off day.   Service still has a ways to go. We ordered to go yesterday and the lady kept telling us that there was no pork noodles only shrimp, beef or chicken. So when we said we wanted the braised pork noodles she said that there was braised pork...lol?! There may be a language barrier but I guess that's how you know that its authentic!"}
{"text":"I'm in full agreement with my friend, Stefany V. This is one of life's surprises.   By the name, and the silly looking logo, one's first impression is a \"knock off\" of Panda Express, and just another Chinese Junk Food place. Oh no!  This place is a real find.   The atmosphere is very pleasing, and the open kitchen, surrounded by glass, is just another plus that adds to this place.   Food is very good, and the price is very affordable. What's more is they are very accomodating. Yes, there's the ususal American Favorites on the menu, but it's more authentic Szechuan Cuisine that makes this place a rare find. I usually ask for suggestions, and the servers reccomend entrees that are not listed on the menu, but are ordered up special by Chinese customers.   I have never been disappointed. Even my \"know it all\" son, who is critical of any Asian eatery not located in Asia, really likes this place.  For good food, and a great value, Mr. ChopStix, even with the silly name, has my full endorcement.  Ok, smart allec Jack; Why not five stars? Like most Asian places, they don't have a fountain drink machine, so you don't get free refills of soft drinks. Otherwise, it's become a go to place at least once a week."}
{"text":"We've had food delivered to our home and dined in the restaurant. We've noticed that we get more food when they deliver which is usually the opposite for delivery/takeout at other places.  DELIVERIES: Have always been accurate (knocking on wood that I didn't just jinx us!!) and the driver is always nice and friendly. Food is mostly hot by the time the food gets to us. We don't live too far but there was one dish that came cold that hubs wasn't too happy aboot.  DINING IN: The service has always been pretty bad. Anytime that I ask \"Can I please have a refill on my water?\" they're waking past us several times to serve other tables but leaves me without anything to drink. We'll order things and they'll forget to put in the order. They've never been busy when we dine in yet the servers seem so flustered as if it was busy which makes me think they do not have much experience in the front of the house.   FOOD: Always consistent and always good."}
{"text":"Purchased a groupon so decided to give this place another chance. Glad I did. They seemed to have revamped their menu and hired new staff (much more polite than the staff working the first time I had come when they were in their grand opening phase).   The spicy chili oil beef appetizer is amazing, it's thin sliced and served cold, perfect for a hot day. The clay pot pork was so yummy and spicy beef noodle soup was terrific (get it with white noodles though). I'll be back!"}
{"text":"1st visit. Bride is Taiwanese and a super chef herself. Bottom line is she was very happy and would return (that alone speaks volumes). Note, we live in North end of the valley."}
{"text":"Great service and really good food! We recommend the spicy pork wontons and the orange chicken!"}
{"text":"Nice vibe! Service was ok! We ordered Pork and Chives DUMPLING, Beef Brisket noodle SOUP, Gizzard Skewer and Honey Lemon Tea!  A bit on the slow side though for the food to come :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my 5 yr old son thinking it was going to be more of an order at the counter type place. When I seen it was sit down I almost left because I was looking for something quick but I'm glad I stayed. We had chicken chow mein & orange chicken, It was really fresh and good. The noodles were amazing. The atmosphere is warm and modern. Definitely worth stopping in and trying."}
{"text":"Really good and authentic Chinese food away from the Chinatown area of Vegas. A welcome addition to Summerlin. We ordered a lot of different things here. Even the orange chicken my White relative ordered looked really good.  I got Dan Dan noodles which were good and my dad got beef noodle soup. We got fried dumplings and dumpling soup and all were good.  It's super authentic Chinese food but they still have typical lunch combo items. Large menu and inexpensive. Open kitchen viewing area.   The logo and signage are cheesy but the food is worth stopping by for."}
{"text":"Best Chinese I've ever had in my life let alone Vegas. Amazing hidden gem. Dumplings are magical"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were very surprised with this place.   I was VERY hesitant because of a few pictures people posted, but everything was very delicious and well prepared. Portions are big, I would recommend the braised pork chow mein and try the black fungus appetizer,  amazing!"}
{"text":"Got food to go there yesterday.  I had the combination fried rice.  Well worth the 10.99, excellent service, only waited a few minutes, and was fresh tasting and delicious.  I will definitely be ordering from there again soon."}
{"text":"From the outside it looks like a fast food place. On the inside its a nice little restaurant. The man that took my order was prompt and pleasant and gave me a glass of ice water while I waited. I ordered the kung pao shrimp lunch special to go.  The lunch special came with an egg roll and cup of soup for about $9.  The wait was short and the food delicious. I will definitely be back for more.     Update-I've been here 3 times in the last week! I'm addicted."}
{"text":"They used to have very good food. But tonight I am so disappointed. The meat of the spareribs soup has gone bad, and the three cup chicken wings we ordered turned into chicken legs. Do we think they changed the chef?"}
{"text":"Pretty good Chinese/Szechuan noodles and dishes.  The pork and chives pancakes and the \"spicy\" wonton dish.  It's actually not spicy but I'm sure you can request and adjust accordingly. Great service too!"}
{"text":"I always wanted to try this place cause i always drive by it and  i tried this place cause of the good reviews I really dont know how this place has so many good reviews I had order togo and walked in this place no one greeted us when we walked in There was a lady just standing there on her phone right in the middle of the aisle she looked at us and went right back to her phone ( please say that wasn't an employee ) i had to literally go back and forth and then was greeted by a girl she was nice but  this  place is not the greatest  The chicken was tender  but it was so bland with absolutely no flavor what so ever It literally tasted like chicken and water with vegetables  The beef was ok just cause it had the char grilled taste to it which you dont get to many chinese places  And portion are not the biggest but i wouldn't of cared if the food was good The  white  rice they gave was super small It was like a little bigger then a handful per entree  Cmon rice is super cheap No wonder there was no one in there ? Definitely will not be returning"}
{"text":"foods good u should check in this. The most greatest food for my is beef pancake although the other flavor is good. I would like to choose beef instead. They also have skewer like lamb, beef , chicken and wings. The most taste fired rice in this place is the bacon marshroom fired rice. I can't believe becon and marshroom can mix together like that good. And it was good for a person if u just spend ur boring afternoon time. Also that wasn't expensive for me. Cuz I live near by Starbucks. I don't wanna drive 20-25mins to Chinatown and wait for the server call me to order my food. By the way, the young boy server was very nice."}
{"text":"This best thing about this place is the cozy atmosphere including a bar tucked in the back. It's very nice for a solo lunch. I ordered shrimp with veggies which was healthy but on the bland side with no soy sauce or chili sauce included with my take out order. Also yelp menu said $7.49 but menu at restaurant says $8.49 which was what I was charged even though I brought up the discrepancy. I may give this place another shot, but I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Very good food! Their soup like stews are a must have! The fried rice was good as well. Try some skewer specials as appitizers! Very nice homie atmosphere."}
{"text":"Very delicious food. Tried their handmade dumplings, pork chop with rice, and lamb & beef skewer. Liked them all!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice now the food is great it feels like you're in Shanghai the chow mein is amazing and the beef stew is amazing...  ??????? ???????????"}
{"text":"Nice clean establishment upon first time walking in. Ambience and decor has a really nice rustic look but also bringing in Chinese culture to mix it up. This place has an open view kitchen which gives it a unique experience. I wanted to get a light meal before work. Ordered lamb skewers, which was pretty damn good. I love my lamb medium and they cooked it to well done. But it was still really tender and flavorful. I also ordered some pork and cabbage potstickers. Those were great as well. Flavor wasn't overpowering at all. Some places over season the pork and cabbage mixture. But they executed this very well. And lastly, salty pepper wings. These are def my favorite dish at any Chinese restaurant. And these were pretty damn good. Really crispy and fresh when they brought it out. I would say it's lacking some fried garlic, but it could be that I love garlic a bit too much lol. Service was great overall. Really attentive and even threw out suggestions and seemed to know the menu very well"}
{"text":"Been here twice already. Delicious authentic Noodles and Dumplings. If you're looking for legit Taiwanese / Chinese / Szechuan fare...definitely worth swinging by...its amazing!!! Great addition to my neighborhood! Get the Spicy Wontons and Beijing Noodles!"}
{"text":"Clean and beautiful. Food was very traditional Chinese home cooking. We order 3 different noodle dishes, lamb skewers and different ice teas. The employees are very nice and friendly. We will go back and try other items soon."}
{"text":"food was excellent! i would come back again of course. i had the mangolian beef and it was excellent. over all their food tasted and looked good!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place has a 4 star average, but I was not impressed. Love the name, the decor and design of the restaurant. Very friendly and good variety of choices. However, the most important part, the food, lacking. Had both teriyaki chicken and beef n broccoli. The meat is very low quality. The price for lunch was $9 a plate for 2 scoops of white rice (not sticky), 4 pieces of broccoli and a few pieces of oddly colored beef on one plate and 8 slices of dark meat chicken on the other. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The hospitality and food are amazing at Mr.ChopStix. The green tea is fresh. Ordered the curry chicken fried rice, salted fish and chicken fried rice, seaweed salad, salt and pepper chicken wings, beef and onion dumplings...everything was tasty."}
{"text":"This place has been amazing not only in the taste of food but also in service. The people who work here puts on a smile for what ever they do. I surly will come back to here again. Mr. ChopStix's food taste amazing, it will give you joy and excitement. And their price is very fair. The owner is nice and welcoming. This place is the best place I ever been to. This place is more than amazing than Magic Noodle. I went to there and no body welcomed me but this place is different. They also have time and also serves you friendly with a big smile. I will always come back to here."}
{"text":"Went for curry with chicken. There was no curry, or spice. The food was definitely Lack luster.  I won't be going back there for anything.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a couple of times. It's a direct competitor of The Noodle Man on Rainbow Blvd based on the menu similarities. I think the noodle dishes are excellent and authentic, and the quality is even a little bit better than The Noodle Man. Some of the food dishes are quite likable too. Service is polite and prompt. The major downside is that the wait time for food is longer than average. Overall a very decent place for authentic Chinese noodles."}
{"text":"A high school friend took us to this restaurant for lunch. It is a Northern Chinese food and they are GOOD! The dumplings, noodles, etc were just Mom's cooking; and it is virtually felt like you were in China. Service was very good and food arrived quickly. Atmosphere is good, and you can watch the cooks work inside glass enclosed kitchen. The owner checked on us periodically at the right pace. Would definitely go back next time in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best food I've had. It is just exquisite! Must get the iced tea and the cucumber salad.  People are nice and very helpful with the menu."}
{"text":"Greetings was good, the food is good but our server takes forever but then again he is alone .. we all did 3 diff checks and he wrote our order down but then he did gave us an extra plate that we all didn't order thats kinda weird .. mango black tea was really sweet, I didn't like cucumber salad .. its weird with soysauce.. the fried rice with beef was awesome but I ordered the lamb and gizzard skewer its good but then it has the same seasoning hmm .."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were really excited to try this place out and we came with a big appetite . When we first walked in we were rushed to sit down by , I'm guessing, the host/ manager/ server/ customer (eating food with her family during service) .  It was extremely chaotic and very unorganized . I ordered a simple Kung pao chicken while my boyfriend wanted to order Chow Fun ( which we have ordered previously). After explaining 3 times AND showing pictures to the server and Manager they finally said they had Chow fun . We waited for 40 min for our takeout , then when we asked how much longer,  the server asked \" did you already put your order in?\". When she knew we've been sitting there for a to go for that amount of time .  When they came out with our order they gave me my kung pao but gave my boyfriend BEEF FRIED RICE. Then the manager argued with us saying the FRIED RICE was Chow Fun ( which is noodles ).  Then after a random person comes up and explains Chow Fun to the manager she , then, tells us they don't have it after we just paid for our meals. We got a refund and refused to take the rest of the order .  Very disappointed with such crappy customer service . Not recommending this place to anyone and will never come back ."}
{"text":"Very affordable and decent price for chinese food.. New establishment with very nice upscale decor. Not the typical looking asian resto!  Staff was very friendly and accommodating for my friends large party of 15!  We practically shut down this place!! Lol  We will be back!! Must try!!"}
{"text":"Excellent staff and service. The manager/owner it might have been was the 1st person to tend to us and he forgot about our drinks, which is very excusable because it's grand opening day and he was taking care of everyone. The restaurant is nicely decorated and kept cool and calm (they even have a sign that says \"relax\" lol). But they do have it on a modern top 40s radio station from iheart, I just heard Taylor Swift and now I'm bumping to fifty's in da club, yeah! I like the menu, beause its made simple with the popular chinese dishes and then a lil extra on top of that. The flavored teas are good too, presented nicely with mini pithers. May GOD bless you guys with a prosperous business, especially since it's so close to home :)...now, when will Filipina grill next door ever open?...maybe it's so authentic that they're still boating from the Philippines :0"}
{"text":"Some items on the menu are not usually found outside of Chinatown in Vegas.  It's always a nice surprise to see simple authentic dishes such as Scallion pancake showing up in a restaurant that I assumed was American style Chinese food menu.  And their version is very delicious. Some items may be too authentic, beef onion pocket can be too greasy for dinners not used to the style.  The meat and onion are cooked inside a closed dough pocket, which makes the juice that some see as fat.  Pam fried pocket stuffed with chives, egg and rice noodles are new to me, and it's delicious! Made to order like everything here.  Their version of beef roll in scallion pancake is one of the best I've had, the wrap is thick and crispy and chewy, seasoned sliced beef inside, plus a green scallion in the middle to add a kick. ( if scallion stem is not your thing, just pull it out )  Today we ordered the Beef Noodle Soup - I have had many Beef Noodle Soup in my life, this is the supreme Beef Noodle Soup !  Flavor of the Soup is wonderful, Beef is full flavor and stewed to perfect. Have I mentioned the dumplings are excellent. Skin is handmade, of the thicker dough variety."}
{"text":"If I lived on the west side, I'd probably frequent this Chinese/Taiwanese joint more often. This place has a winning combination of good food, service, pricing and ambience.   Items tried: Spicy pork wontons Braised pork noodle soup Chicken and eggplant  Mr. Chopstix makes a good version of spicy pork wontons. There's a lot of flavor going on and enough heat to tingle your tongue. I have not been to one of the newer places in town to offer this dish (Shang), but my husband has. He prefers the way Mr. Chopstix makes theirs compared to Shang, Noodle Pot II, and Noodle man.   The soup was really good and of course the tender and tasty pork was the star of the dish.   The chicken and eggplant was our favorite dish here. Adding tofu is optional. The flavor was great and much more refined than a typical eggplant/tofu dish at a Chinese take out place. I like the way they cut the eggplant into thin strips to get some crunch and texture on the outside, rather than large, soggy eggplant pieces that other places serve.   I think for Asian places that serve entrees like the chicken and eggplant, white rice should be included. When our dishes were served to us there was no rice. We assumed it was automatically part of the meal. Apparently, white rice is an extra charge. A slight annoyance, since we couldn't eat right away and had to pay extra.  They offer boba drinks here. I tried to order a green milk tea, but for some reason they couldn't make it. Our server said they could only do the flavored iced teas. Not sure if it was an ingredient issue or lack of trained staff to make the drink.   The interior was done nicely and I like the open kitchen concept. Service was very polite and attentive. Usually, unheard of in Chinese restaurants.   *****Yelp 2016 100 Challenge***** 56/100"}
{"text":"In between, worse than PF changs, better than Panda express.  American fusion chinese or a boba cafe type place. The dishes I ordered were 3 entrees, eggplant tofu, kungpao beef, and combination chow mein.  Very generic menu and limited selection, nothing unique or special at all.  They didn't give a lot of food for the higher price.   Its just Ok.  I would stay away from the entrees.  Seems like more people liked the specialty beef noodles and dumplings gave it higher ratings.  Probably would try ordering that instead if I had to go there again."}
{"text":"First I want to say this review is based on my second visit. My first visit last year we waited 1 hr to get served and was served all our dishes wrong. Tonight we gave this place a second chance, you know sometimes it was just a bad day. So we entered and again waited 10 mins to order, than finally placed our order and seriously waited over 20 minutes and still nothing. I get if it was busy but there was only four tables being served.  Sorry but I will not recommend this place for service, food is good but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely fantastic! The lady was so sweet. The food was delicious as well. Best Chinese food I've had in a while."}
{"text":"Upon entering I was greeted by someone, we had a language barrier and she immediately sent someone else over. Now, If you google make sure it's this location- different me is and there is a place with a similar name. I ordered three items and all were fresh and quite pleasing on the taste buds! My favorite the beef dumplings and pork dumplings! Dipped this into the chili sauce! You can sit around the outside of the kitchen. The kitchen is clean and all the employees wear gloves:)  I took a picture and a video;)"}
{"text":"ZERO STARS. The most disgusting Chinese food I've ever had. The seaweed salad was the most horrific  thing I've ever placed in my mouth. I spit it out immediately. It tasted as if I licked an old dead fish laying on the oceans algae ridden shores.  The Mongolian beef was so fatty, tough & greasy it was literally inedible. Just SICK!  JUST SAY NO!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered them from Uber eats, a simple orange chicken and fried rice. They took over a hour to prepare the food, I then called three times each twice the phone went to voicemail and the third time a lady answered the phone \"hello\" then hung up on me. For such a small basic Chinese restaurant you'd think it would be quicker. Save yourself a lot of time and go to Panda Express for the same food and a fraction of the wait."}
{"text":"I dined in once and have ordered for pick up numerous times and everything I've ordered so far has been delicious!! I can't get enough of their food! It's too good!"}
{"text":"I've drove by this place a couple times before but thought nothing of it because of its weird looking logo. Would have never gone until finding it here on yelp. The cool miniature pitchers they use for their drinks tantalized me into visiting and it was just as cute in real life.   I ordered the Signature Beef Noodle Soup. It was perfect for soothing my cold and tasted pretty authentic. I don't really ever get Chinese food but it was quite enjoyable. I had my meal with a peach iced tea which was well balanced - not too sweet, not too much peach flavor, just right.   I would definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is a great Chinese restaurant. Good lamb skewers and they make the best chow mein. Try the roasted pork Chowmein. They really do a great job on that. Beef noodle soup is also very good."}
{"text":"Nice place to go , love the food there and service. If you love real Chinese food go there !"}
{"text":"Mr. Chopstix may sound like a joint that Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson would order delivery from in a bad 90's rom-com flick, but behind the colorful outside sign and questionable name choice is a husband and wife team that's serving up some of the tastiest, authentic Chinese food off Spring Mountain in a surprisingly nice setting.  \"Braised Pork and Egg\" provides me with a deliciously nostalgic Taiwanese taste of home and the signature \"brown eggs\" accompanied with meaty, fatty pork belly are almost exactly like the ones my mom makes.  I know that flavor well as I've eaten a million of them give or take.  I don't recall any other spot in Las Vegas doing their \"Scallion pancake\" made to order from scratch, and this one is absolutely stellar.  The only con is the wait, since this is typically a starter dish, but even though this isn't brought as soon as I would like it to be, I forget all about those 15 minutes upon my first bite.   In fact, all of their starchy goodness is made that way and forgoing at least one order of these from their extensive (for the burbs) array of dumplings and pancakes would be a mistake.  A couple of notable favorites are the classic pork and chive dumplings and the \"can't believe there's no meat in the\" vegetable and egg pancake. They're really big compared to other versions around.   The spicy beef noodle soup, which is better than the signature bowl, is something I'd still be down with in sweltering Vegas heat.  Their mapo tofu is outstanding as well.  Easily the best Far East food.....in Far West Vegas."}
{"text":"Great selection..clean..great service..tasty close to original taste ..which is difficult to find in Henderson Las Vegas area.."}
{"text":"I have been here three times  The food is delicious but the service is soooo painfully slow over 2 hour lunch"}
{"text":"I know it's new and just opened but come on it took forever just to get water and was extremely hot inside the restaurant, to the point were I was so uncomfortable I couldn't even finish my food!!! I don't know if I'm coming back wait was long, and food was alright."}
{"text":"Their spicy shrimp wontons, signature beef noodle soup, and combo fried rice was amazing! Definitely a must try & I love how the noodles are hand pulled."}
{"text":"Service: 5/5 Greetings: 5/5 Attentiveness: 5/5 Cleanliness of the staff: 5/5 Cleanliness: 3.25/5 Foyer: 4/5 Bathroom: 4/5 Table cleanness: 2.5/5 (Condiments on the table weren't clean. Slightly sticky)  Menu: 3/5  Food: 3/5  Beef soup 3/5  Soup base is 4/5 Probably the best flavor beef noodle soup base in town so far.  However, not the best I have ever tasted.   The beef 2/5 This cut of beef is cheap for a reason.  Before the tendon being cooked throughly, the meat is almost over cooked.  There tricks to overcome this issue, but I'm not about to teach here. So, my rating is low on this part. I don't enjoy the meet melting and have to spit out the chewing tendon.   It's just not a proper beef noodle shop would do.   Pork Chop with Fried rice 1/5 Fried rice wasn't cooked evenly. There are parts over cooked and parts lumpy.  The pork chop was too sweet.    Didn't like this dish at all   Pancake: 3/5 Pork and cabbage 3/5 It's still a bit undercooked.  Flavor is good  The dough is cooked in evenly  Beef and onion. 3/5 The dough is a bit chewy.   Dumplings 4/5 Pork and Chive  The dough is a bit mixed unevenly. A bit lumpy taste in the dumpling skins."}
{"text":"Already came in a few times this week. The place is AMAZING! Everything on the menu tastes great. Perfect texture and flavour!!"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday night around 8pm with my kids, the place was pretty slow but that didn't deter us. For our meals my boys ordered a chicken chow mein, curry flank steak which included a side of rice, orange chicken which also had rice included and being a vegetarian I ordered the eggplant tofu chow mein. It was labeled as spicy but I didn't find it so. I also ordered steamed beef/onion dumplings for them which they all said was good. Two of them ordered Sprites which they brought out in cans and with a cup of ice to pour it in as well. Our server was friendly and attentive and our food was all served in generous portions, so much so that we had enough to take home for lunch the next day. The food was good and for the portion sizes very reasonably priced. I'd recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is magnificent. The food is really good, prices are very reasonable and the portions are huge!!! It seem to be served family style with a big spoon so you can share food with others. The service was excellent the young man working was on top of things.   Inside is beautifully decorated. I cannot wait to come back."}
{"text":"You can sit and watch all the food made from scratch - which if you like food tv - you will Love.  And the food is great !"}
{"text":"First time calling in an order and they called me back right away telling me they ran out of that particular food. Food was good. A bit expensive."}
{"text":"Second time I've been here. First time was for lunch by myself, loved the Mongolian beef so much had to bring the wife.   We had the spicy beef bowl, braised pork and the chicken skewers(6 total half spicy half not).   I enjoy spicy food quite a lot and thought that would just add to everything here, sadly I was horribly wrong. They seem to just chuck spice on top of what they would have already made to make it \"spicy\". The end result is a layer of uncooked overly spicy crust to destroy your tongue with every bite.  Worst thing is the food is actually really good, but when your first bite burns your tongue out you might as well be eating rice pudding.  In summary, delicious food just run away from anything spicy... They don't know how to do spicy right."}
{"text":"Very good place close to home and very healthy for being Chinese (just being honest). So cute all the decor and the food quality is health and delicious!"}
{"text":"This is my sister and I's go-to place. We're making it a thing to try something new each time amidst our usual consistent orders of chili oil beef, beef roll, & the chili oil ear. Yum, pig ears.   Service has never been an issue for us. We always order so much food for us 2 that at one point our waitress was worried we didn't like the food cause we still had a decent amount of leftovers.   There are some items I can't say I will get again, since they fall a little bit short, like the spicy chicken gizzard, but my sister actually liked the dish instead. To each your own!  We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"This place is super authentic, I had the popcorn chicken and the pork/tofu stew, tastes exactly like what my mom used to make at home! Definitely The best Chinese restaurant in town, and the price is very reasonable too!"}
{"text":"Just ok. They are nice, but slow. I walked in and ordered take out. I ordered the terriyaki chicken rice lunch plate and milk tea with boba. Its just ok. Its not terrible, but its not spectacular. I should have drove a few more miles to Panda Express."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and was pleased to get the food fairly quickly. Orange chicken, Honey Walnut Shrimp, potstickers, dumplings and spicy wontons. Kind of a generic order to feel the place out. When the food came it was hot and everything was really good, especially the Honey Walnut Shrimp and the potstickers. I also was pleased with the price which was a little less than the place that I usually order. I gave 4 stars because we didn't receive very much sauce and I don't know why but I was expecting rice with the entrees  ( probably because the other place that I order from has rice with the entrees and fortune cookies ). I will make the necessary adjustments before I order next time."}
{"text":"It's amazing. They don't mind making things less spicy if you just ask. As Always, very friendly and accommodating and Everything I've had is exceptional. Our favorite place to eat."}
{"text":"We always order take out and have not been disappointed. Everything is delicious.  The pancakes and buns take extra time to cook so be prepared."}
{"text":"I just had Kung Pao chicken lunch plate. It was on point and delicious! I ate the whole thing"}
{"text":"I agree with Kristine B. about the language barrier, but I have had worse. The food was great. The restaurant was pleasant if not a little warm due to the sun coming in the front windows. They had portable fans to help with that. No free refills on drinks. We had a meat and a shrimp skewer, which were excellent. We also had the beef fried rice, which was average. The hot sauce on the table redefined pain, so avoid unless you like that kind of thing.   The reason I'm giving a three-star review is the Chinese Pancake. We had the beef version. The meat was not cooked through and it was basically grease upon grease. The grease spurt out on every bite. I believe the greasiness made me sick hours later.   I did like the drinks in little pitchers and the bill coming in a little bucket, but being sick after a meal is never a good thing."}
{"text":"As a Chinese food aficionado I do not give 5 stars lightly. This restaurant was far better than most I have tried to date here in Las Vegas, even in Chinatown. The \"potstickers\" (I really wish that restaurants in Nevada would start to know the difference between a potsticker and a a dumpling and at least here they seem to)were delicious. The Hunan Beef left something to be desired though-while utterly delicious, it did not have nearly enough beef in it. The pork chow mein (lo mein) was delicious, I do not get restaurants that do not use barbecue pork but rather steamed or boiled pork, here they knew better. The portions were perfect, heavy portion on the dumpling I might add-enough for a family of 4 to chow down on. This definitely will not be my last time ordering from them, though I will be sure to ask for extra beef if I get the Hunan Beef."}
{"text":"I thought I'd try someplace out new. I ordered delivery. I ordered orange chicken which was not very good at all. It was extra extra crispy with a strange stringy chicken texture to it. The portion size was big so that was a positive, I just wish it tasted better. I also ordered chicken chow mein which seemed to have hardly any chicken in it but the chicken in it seemed to be freshly cooked chunks, which tasted good. The prices were reasonable. It might have been a fluke what happened but I am going to try someplace else."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place I love their food and friendly customer service. If I could only give ten stars I would give another 5 stars for wendy our server."}
{"text":"Is Mr. Chopstix single?! I'm in love.   I'm addicted to this place. The veggie & egg pancakes and the cucumber salad are straight legit. Spicy pork dumplings?! Oh hellz yes. I basically order the same thing, but the other items I have had were equally delicious. The chili oil is from heaven.   Cute restaurant inside and windows to watch them prepare your food. Ben is very nice and hospitable."}
