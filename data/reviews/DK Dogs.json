{"text":"Truly not a negative thing to say about this place. The food is delicious and affordable and the owner (and his son) are incredibly courteous. 
Have had the DK dog and the Viking. Highly recommend both! Will come again (soon!)"}
{"text":"The hot dog special sauce was tasty. The Viking dog was good because the texture was amazing. The crunchy onion and squishy jalape√±o was excellent. The fries were merely meh, kinda cold and soggy, so I can't give them all five stars. I'd go back though."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved it! I've been following DK Dogs on social media for awhile - I just hadn't had the opportunity to be in the same place as the mobile cart. Finally made the trek to his storefront. I haven't been to Denmark but I have a feeling that he's recreated a typical Danish quick serve restaurant.  I had the Danish dog and my friend had the Nordic and we shared the mac and cheese.  Everything was outstanding! Yes, there is room in Phoenix for another hot dog choice. We enjoyed our conversation with the owner ... and I'm super excited that soon they'll be cooking up aebleskivers!"}
{"text":"We decided to check out DK Dogs cause we're always looking for a great hot dog.  This place came on the radar for us recently.  
Nice, modern, clean little place in a little strip mall that's getting a complete makeover, at 12th St and Highland.
We were warmly greeted, our few questions were answered and we both decided on the Danish Dog.  Onions, Remoulade sauce, thin sliced pickled cucumbers,  fried onion pieces, nice fresh bun....  it was delicious!  The pickled cucumbers really add a nice little sweetness to the dog.  
This will definitely be our local go-to dog house and I can't wait to try the DK Dog,  stuffed in a hollowed out French baguette with a special sauce."}
{"text":"Great place, nice people, good prices.  Traditional dogs are just that and the Danish dog is great without putting too much of a spin on it that you wouldn't recognize it not being a dog."}
{"text":"Great tasty dogs here!! To my knowledge the only true Danish dog experience in town. Owner is from Denmark. Great prices and amazing flavors. I loved the Nordic dog which was havarti cheese, fried onions, red cabbage and secret sauce. Can't wait to try the pastrami dog next. Great neighborhood place. Can load up with tons of flavor for a great value!! Excellent neighborhood hot dog joint!!!"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and snag the DK dog. Yeah it's more expensive, but to be honest, it's all you'll ever need. Such a shame I live in Tucson and can't drop by more often 
I also tried the pastrami dog and that was tasty, but seriously, just get the DK dog. Why are you still reading this? Third times a charm? DK DOG!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The great folks who own the food truck have finally opened up a brick and mortar.  We popped in tonight for their soft opening and it didn't disappoint!

My husband had the DK Dog and I had the Nordic Dog.  Both were very good.  I couldn't wait to devour mine so I ate mine before remembering to take a picture.  

The DK dog is fully wrapped in a soft baguette bun, was perfectly cooked and came with their delicious secret sauce.  

The Nordic Dog came with fried crispy onions and their secret sauce.  

At the end of our meal the owner came by and gave us and our family some Mac and cheese to go.  

I was expecting a few kinks and was surprised to see everything was pretty buttoned up!  My gut says they will likely need a bigger space in the long term."}
{"text":"These are the best hotdogs I've eaten in a very long time, high quality and delicious. 

You want a a treat you won't soon forget, visit DK Dogs!"}
{"text":"Amazing hot dogs.  I had the Danish Style dog and it was one of the best hot dogs I have ever had."}
{"text":"But some great hot dogs little different with the toppings on it had the Danish and then norak both are equally as good would definitely be back very soon"}
{"text":"Great place, my Hot Dog was Great ,freah large  bun w/ over laped beef plump and juicy weiner
Can't wait to visit again"}
{"text":"Wow! I just had the Nordic dog! You owe it to yourself to stop by here and try one of these crazy Danish hot dogs! Very different, unique and refreshing toppings. They tell me it's just like you would get in Denmark. (I'm running a little short on time or I would run over to Denmark) lol But it's right here in Phoenix Arizona hooray! My Nordic dog had Havarti cheese and red pickled cabbage that was a little sweet but not too sweet. (reminded me of mild not so sweet red raspberry jelly) Fried onions added a little saltiness and crunchiness.  the secret sauce which is like a sweet mayonnaise/mustard mixed with mild spices very very good. I love this place! I love hotdogs anyway! But this place puts a new twist on an old favorite. :-) l'm told that when you're in Denmark they use pork hotdogs or Franks. But the owner told me that the Americans love their beef! The staff and owner were very patient explained everything to me. Not to mention the quaint little location underneath some stairs at Highland and 12th St. Slide by this place and tell your hot dog loving friends about it too if you want!"}
{"text":"Great hot dogs served by friendly people.  A great addition to this area.  The pretzel buns are chewy and amazing."}
{"text":"So good!! A different selection than you find at other places! My only regret is not getting the XL"}
{"text":"Omg these hot dogs are da bomb!! Their sauce is so delicious. Crispy onions and red  pickled cabbage. Yum!  Lil place nice . The owner is very friendly and informative helped us choose. They cater with 2 carts too. Nice lil lunch spot or dinner."}
{"text":"They sell hot dogs. Not particularly exciting. They are good hot dogs, and I love the pickles, but you can get a bunch of wieners and pretzel buns from Schrieners and do a better job yourself for less money. 

They have the most uncomfortable selection of chairs from IKEA known to man, too. 

Worth a trip once, but no real reason to go back unless you need a snack after staring at titties next door."}
{"text":"We walked in and they were super nice and answered any questions we had because I think it was pretty obvious we were newbies. Place is nice and clean, we ordered and they are super fast. I had the danish dog, never had a hot dog with fried onions on it but it was delish, husband had the chili cheese dog and he didn't even let me have a bite . Glad this place is close to my house, look forward to trying the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"A little late to post this as we came on Father's Day, about 3 minutes before closing. The doors were already locked! I almost cried because we were going to have to wait 2 months until our trip back home to Denmark for hot dogs. Glen (the awesome owner) opens the door and I for sure thought he was going to shoo us away... my boyfriend starts speaking rapid fire Danish with him and the next thing you know he's literally getting everything out to make us our DK dogs. I was so moved by his kind gesture and the delicious ingredients soooo hard to get outside of Denmark (unless you want the IKEA alternative). I can't wait to go back for more to try them all!! I would love to hire him for catering too!!"}
{"text":"Great dog, love the taste, the quality is top notch. The owners run the place, and they are so friendly. I have eaten here 3 times, the location is a bit odd, crappy neighborhood, but this place stands out as a cool contemporary place to grab a hot dog and hang out with friends. The prices are a little high for a hot dog and fries. Service was quick! It is a must try!"}
{"text":"So happy to have a hot dog place back in the neighborhood. I tried three different types of dogs and the Danish was by far my favorite. I could eat a pile of their fresh dill pickles. The restaurant is basically just the cart menu plus a few more items. I hope they have the chance to expand in the future as there is potential for a great spot"}
{"text":"I work up the block from here and have visited on several occasions.  High quality lunch at a reasonable price!  Local feel from the staff (owners?).  Casual atmosphere, and comfortable sitting areas in and out.  I'm still unsure as to the link between Denmark and the Hot Dog, but I'm also not in the habit of arguing with greatness!  These guys are hard to find, but worth the hunt.  Don't miss this place when looking for something different."}
{"text":"The DK hotdog was absolutely delicious. the bread was a little crustier than I'd prefer, but I went close to closing, so I can't complain. All the components were delicious and amazing together. I'm excited to go back and try the pretzel dog."}
{"text":"Fantastic hot dog,  love the remoulade sauce on the Danish dog, the weiner itself snaps and is very tasty.  Best of luck to this new spot, had them several times at shows like Goodguys, I'm sure they'll do great!"}
{"text":"First timer at DK today and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised!!! Great little hidden location not busy or overcrowded. The service was excellent and help with ordering that right dog was exact!!! Not a huge menu but enough selection to make you go back to try another!!! We will definitely be back and surely recommend!! Danish Dogs!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time today. Small place but very clean. Got a plain dog with mustard and a chili dog. The hotdogs were really good and the service was great. Definitely check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"Great traditional (or as close as you can really get to it) Danish Style Hot Dogs - in the desert. Super flavorful and delicious! Try something out of your typical comfort zone - do not expect a \"Chicago style hot dog\" when you got to a \"Danish style hot dog\" place. Expect something better. 
Owner was beyond friendly as we showed up 2 min prior to closing, he gladly reopened for us. We would definitely come back here. Decor was also great."}
{"text":"Every once in a while I want a good hotdog but don't actively seek them out. Happen to see this place was open. Got the danish dog, should've gotten two. Good stuff."}
{"text":"Stopped in here just before they closed.  Excellent dogs!  The photography of the menu both online and in the shop is terrible (hire a pro...or a good pro).  The dogs are absolutely delicious. I am obsessed with hot dogs and need this place to stay and prosper here on 12th st.  Definitely stop in or order away on Postmates.  The shop is impecabbly clean located in the newer \"strip\" center."}
{"text":"Not bad. Place is just barebones as far as seating but that's ok. It's clean. 
Hot dogs were good as far as options and they had a regular size or a large which is a nice option. Tried the Viking which was quite delicious and the one with pastrami which was just ok, not a lot of pastrami on it or flavor. They both could have been much hotter (temperature of the hot dog is what I mean) 
Also tried their version of Frito Pie, it was good. 
We ordered a soda and asked for ice and they didn't have any. Which was very odd to me. We also asked for a couple of knives to cut food and they said they could only give us one. 
It's not the type of place I would go a lot but once in a while."}
{"text":"Delish. No frill atmosphere, they put all the effort into the food. Spot on Chicago Dog!"}
{"text":"Really awesome hotdog I went in on Wednesday for their five dollar dog fries and drink meal. i believe i got the viking and it is phenomenal. you got a new regular here :)"}
{"text":"Delicious. Had the Danish Dog and the DK style. The Danish was definitely better but both were great. Staff was welcoming. Definitely go back."}
{"text":"Central phoenix has a lot of good food and a lot of cheap food, but not a whole lot of very good, very cheap food. DK Dogs is a welcome addition to the small number of restaurants that fit this category (I'm looking at you Pho Thanh!) Two specialty hot dogs, fries, and a drink for $10? Not a bad combo deal at all. The fries aren't anything to write home about (though I have not yet tried them with toppings), but the Danish dog's tasty remoulade, crispy onion bits, and lightly-brined pickles will have you texting friends and family. The restaurant owner alone merits a star, as he took a lot of time to go through the different menu options and clearly cares about his business. Our first time to DK Dogs will definitely not be our last!"}
{"text":"Tried for first time ordered the chili dog very good.  The place is very clean big plus!!! Like the concept and the writings on the wall.  Will be back in future!!"}
{"text":"Satisfied my hot dog craving! Lots of interesting ingredients. Delicious and very friendly staff. Enjoyed the Danish atmosphere!"}
{"text":"First impression, very clean and easy to order food. Definitely a great place to get a quick bite to eat but not a first date place. Would recommend to others."}
{"text":"Great to find this place. I am Danish and wanted to try this place out. Worth the wait."}
{"text":"OMG !!!! The viking is amazing!!!!!!  Second time trying them out and they are by far the best hot dog and topping combinations by far!!!!!!!!!  Thank you!!!  Please visit Direct Energy again soon!!"}
{"text":"Finally went after seeing this place online a few times...i know some people see 3 stars as a 'bad' review, but in this case i use it because its neutral. this is an affordable, no-frills place w a couple good specialty dogs. nothing amazing, but also not bad. the people working were friendly and fast, and i saw them being pretty helpful to another few people that were in there who didnt know the menu. definitely worth a quick stop for a few bucks that will get you in and out fast"}
{"text":"Good dogs, cool friendly people, close to work! AWESOME... Would have got 5 stars except for the ketchup SNAFU... I will be back!"}
{"text":"Best Dk Dog in the world! Fast service!  Great customer service! Owner Glen is really nice and styling to talk to you about these amazing dogs! The Viking is our favorite! Don't forget your jar of Danish pickled cucumbers!"}
{"text":"First place within walking distance of where I work, and I'm impressed. Friendly staff and great atmosphere. I ordered the Danish Dog. My only regret is not getting one size larger!"}
{"text":"Great place! I did not know they were here. Closest hot dog I knew of was JP's which is good but only open late night. These guys operate a very cool, clean and bright little storefront with indoor and outdoor seating. The 2 dog combo is what I had with the Danish and the Chili Dog. Coke and n the van is fine by me. The serving of fries is enormous. Could not finish them. The Danish Dog has the stores signature Danish Pickles on it. Unusual yes, very very good! They also sell the pickles by the jar!! The Chili Dog reminded me of the hotdogs if my childhood in the south. Great service, and bright shiny faces cap off a wonderful first experience at DK Dogs. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Quick and fast.  Easy to just \"stop in\" real fast.  This is the first \"Danish dog\" I've had and it was Awesome!  They have \"normal\" hot dog configurations as well, but I recommend trying something outside your comfort zone."}
{"text":"Delicious on every level.  Finally had a chance to come here and it was so worth it for a quick lunch bite.  

Loved everything about it.   As soon I walked in I was greeted by the cashier and the Guy making the dogs (maybe the owner).  Very friendly and eager to answer questions.   He gave me a breakdown of the different Dogs and off I went like a kid in a candy store. 

Decided on the Nordic Dog. And wow.  I'm a fan!!!! Get it and thank me later.   

Can't wait to be back."}
{"text":"Absolutely DELICIOUS food!!! The service was great, the restaurant was adorable and clean, and the food is out of this world! We did the Pick two combo for $10 and added an order of the polsemix. We got the Nordic Dog and the Danish Dog with our combo deal. Both had sooooo much flavor and the polsemix fries were AMAZING! We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"Having frequented Denmark on a regular basis over the last 10 years, and having become an unrepentant addict when it comes to the traditional Danish style hot dogs, you can imagine my reaction when I first found out about this place. I simply had to check it out, even if it was a rather lengthy drive and, from my perspective anyway, across town. 

First and foremost, the parking situation isn't the best, but it's not too bad. I actually missed this place the first time I went past. Not really their fault, given the layout of the suites there, but still worth noting that it doesn't exactly jump out at you, especially if you're not familiar with the area. Once you find a place to park, there's a rather nice, shaded walkway that takes you to their entrance. Might be a bit industrial for some, but I thought it was pretty cool. It also shelters you a bit from the passing traffic, including the noise, so that's an added bonus. 

Inside, the place is pretty much what you'd expect if you've ever been to Denmark. Places that sell hot dogs usually don't even have a place for you to sit down and, on the rare occasion that they do, you can be sure it isn't anything fancy. Such is the case here, true to form and in the most basic sense just what you'd expect a Danish hot dog place to be set up as. Definitely give the owner props for keeping it minimalist and thereby authentic. 

As for the food itself, my wife and I tried both the Danish dogs and the DK, which I suppose in Denmark would be called a Fransk (Danish word for 'French'). Yes, that's right, in Denmark the Danes actually call these French hot dogs, seeing as how they dog is tucked into a French baguette. You'd think that wouldn't require explaining to most people, but you'd be wrong. O.o

The Danish dogs were first on our plates, and were quickly devoured. They were excellent. Everything you'd want for in a hot dog, and complete with authentic fried onion bits and remoulade. To say that remoulade is ubiquitous in Danish street food would be something of an understatement, because it literally as common as ketchup, so it was definitely nice to see that available here. The dogs themselves, while not entirely capable of tasting authentic (since they don't sell the same kind here as they use in Denmark) was adequately close for me. 

The DK / Fransk, while very much looking and feeling the part, were not quite as authentic as the Danish dogs. Part of that comes down to the baguette, which is somewhat bulkier and thicker than what you'd get at a typical Danish street vendor, while the other part is the hot dog itself. As I mentioned earlier, you simply cannot buy the exact right kind of sausage for this in the states, so one has to make due, and I understand that. Nevertheless, it didn't quite have the same snap to the casing and the same taste that you would find in Denmark. I also think the sausage itself was markedly thicker than the traditional Danish street dog, but again, there's not really a domestic substitute (that I'm aware of) that fits the bill. All that having been said, I'd still eat one again, because it was still a good hot dog, tucked into a warm, toasted baguette. Good luck finding that anywhere else. 

On the whole, I really like this place, and I definitely hope it succeeds. I certainly that they're able to expand the menu and perhaps include some other staples of the Danish hot dog vendors (for example, the red sausages, or maybe roasted sausages with mustard and remoulade on the side the way it's offered in Denmark). Given that this place is extremely new, at least the brick and mortar incarnation, I can't really hold any of the above against them. Consider it's their first week in operation, we didn't really have any problems and the food was as authentic as can reasonably be expected. I highly encourage anyone wanting to experience authentic Danish street food, or at least as close as it gets in the states, to try them out."}
{"text":"Best hotdog in town!!  Must try the Nordic! 
Had 4 different ones... each better than the next!!!"}
{"text":"First time here, but the hot dogs are delicious! Was very happy with the outcome, specially because this was my first time here. Very clean place and great customer service. I was greeted right away and cashier was very friendly and polite. Would recommend this place for lunch."}
{"text":"Upon arrival the owner greeted my boyfriend and I and gave us a detailed description of each hot dog item. I got the cheesy mac and weenie and pretzel dog. Can you say love at first bite? The hot dogs are no doubt ballpark quality if not better. On the pretzel dog the bun was soft and delightful. I would probably get another topping instead of hot mustard. It tasted like horseradish (ick) but nevertheless it was still delicious. 

The restaurant itself is minimal. I personally like the Danish flags and decor. 

I'm definitely glad they glad they have UberEat, GrubHub, and Postmates for delivery. No doubt I'll be a regular customer from now on.

The only negative I can say is the parking lot is a little small."}
{"text":"Small menu. Good dogs, fast service. Prices are ok. Honestly, I like the brown bag at Schreiners more for a simple dog (cheaper, a better wiener and they have RC Cola) or Short Leash because of their more creative combinations. 

Still, DK is worth visiting and they do have some unique Danish flavors I've not had before. Try it, you might like it! You'll definitely feel welcome and enjoy the clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. Great dogs! Reasonably priced. Close to home. Super friendly staff. Danish and Viking are my favorite. DK dog is a monster in a baguette. All that, and a bag of chips! Don't forget your drink. Or and ice cream or float to keep you cool"}
{"text":"I'd rather drive 30 mins to Portillo's than eat here again. My husband was so eager to try this place because he is in dire need for a close hotdog place. He grew up in Chicago, so he has had his fair share of hot dogs. 

I ordered a Chili Cheese Hot Dog without mustard or onions and it was awful! I expect steaming hot chili and gooey melted cheese that requires one to eat with a knife and fork. I got the exact opposite... lukewarm chili that tastes like it came from a can, cold cheese that never melted and clean hands that didn't require a plasticware. :0/

My hubby got two hot dogs with just mustard and ketchup. He wasn't thrilled with the flavor of the hot dogs and was underwhelmed with the buns. The buns should be warmed up, steamed, toasted or something. The buns are half the battle. 

I also felt like their place needed some more color, a plant or something. If felt very cold in there and needed some inviting touches.

*Updated to 1 star after the snarky tip from the owner. My review was based off the food, I could care less about the design. I don't go to a restaurant for the design of a restaurant... I don't think anyone does."}
{"text":"The best hot dog in town. The owners and staff are so friendly (and don't judge me at all for how often I come in). The Danish style dog is my go-to, but you can't go wrong with whatever you order. The prices can't be beat either!"}
{"text":"Love!! So excited DK dogs finally opened. Super friendly staff and amazing hotdogs. The environment is open and fun!"}
{"text":"So glad we found this place. Great hot dogs and the owner was so so nice. 

It's been almost 20 years since I've had a French hot dog and I've thought about it every single time I have a one. FINALLY I've found a place that serves a baguette hotdog. No need to travel to Paris (besides it being Paris). 

Great price point, clean atmosphere, yummy food."}
{"text":"*fast 
*friendly service
*affordable snacking 
*clean bathrooms
*delicious dogs
*can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We came for an advertised Wednesday special...chili dogs, fries and soda for $6.
Service was fast and friendly. The space is crisp and clean. They have really good pickles. Love the crinkle cut fries and the dog stuffed into a hollowed out baguette! One of their sauces is unique. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Delicious hot dogs. Stopped in with my husband and got the Danish and Viking dogs. Both were excellent!"}
