{"text":"The Span ish was one of the most amazing things I have ever tasted. The patty add egg was also next level deliciousness. This place is a pure gem!"}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are amazing!!! They use amazing and unusual ingredients.  The vegetarian sandwiches are great!!! I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Chicken skin on a sandwich is a beautiful thing.  Their chicken sandwich is the best sandwich I have eaten in Las Vegas.

The location is great- right downtown and super convenient.  Stop by and drink at Dino's while you wait for your grub.  No where to site at the Goodwhich so Dino's is the ace to sit.

The hipster owners are pretty cool too!"}
{"text":"I am not even sure this qualifies as a hole in the wall.  With that said their food is the bomb.  Try the confeit or pork belly. One of the best sandwiches I have ever had."}
{"text":"This  is a do not miss place for foodies in Las Vegas. Chef  made food in the parking lot of the Oldest Neighborhood Bar in the city! 
The smart play here is to order at the truck (add the Crispy Skin) and chow down with one of the best bartending staffs in the city. *Guess the right suit and drink PBR for free!"}
{"text":"CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!!! Located at the former Viva Las Arepas stand.

These guys really know their stuff. Friendly and knowledgeable who support local businesses/products (bon breads/artisanal foods). Their foie&....omg, definitely a must try. Rich, creamy, and indulgent. Date added extra crispy chicken skin and don't be afraid to try the same. They sometimes run out of it so get it when you can.

The fluff&nutt monte cristo style on white caters to anyone who loves sweets. Definitely another must try especially if you're wanting some dessert. Can't go wrong with the falafel or reuben-ish either. As for the le pig, I can't seem to remember much about it so it doesn't strike me as something memorable. 

Open til 1A Fri/Sat. Stop by if you happen to karaoke at Dino's, decide to check out some people in their birthday suits at OG, or are coming from bars downtown.

Tip: text their number ahead of time with your order to have it ready by the time you arrive.

Definitely a place I recommend."}
{"text":"GET HERE. NOW. STUFF YOUR FACE WITH A DELICIOUS SANDWICH. 

This place rocks. The party melt, the Reuben, the fried egg sandwich. All top notch. Quick service, friendly and attentive staff. 

A great place for sandwiches!"}
{"text":"I love little stands like these that are on the grind. Been wanting to try this spot for a while and finally decided to give it a shot. The menu has had some recent changes bc I wanted to have the foie sandwich which is all over previous yelp reviews. If I were them I would always have a small stock and keep it limited for regulars or people fiending that sandwich. No where I have ever seen has a sandwich with foie gras.

Anyways I had the Cuban esque today and it's exactly what I wanted. I love that they use classic thick slices of square bread. It really gives a true homestyle feel and deli type feeling to it to. If your a fan of Cuban sandwiches then surrender bc this sandwich is the truth. Menu has is priced from 3,5,7,9 Sammies and that doesn't include chips, drinks, or add one. Josh the owner is the man very honest guy and super chill to talk to. If you're a sandwich head like I am then head down here bc Vegas doesn't have many classic delis or sandwich spot staples like other cities do.."}
{"text":"I don't prefer sandwitch usually, but the sandwitch of this place was awesome! And I really liked coffee of this place."}
{"text":"HYPED UP. My family and I were there oct 15th and got a to go order of the egg salad sandwich which i was told is amazzziiing. We also got the Cobb salad and pig of the week (don't remember the exact name). First of all, my egg salad was way too runny! It was literally falling out of my sandwich any time I held it up. I ended up splitting it and eating it like regular toast. It was supposed to have chorizo on top but it was sprinkled ever so lightly that it seemed they completely missed that step. Not only that but the actual amount of food in the sandwich was like they ran out and scraped the bottom of the bowl The Cobb salad had 5 pieces of tofu. FIVE. Otherwise it was okay--for some reason the nuts had actual sugar, it was too much. The POTW was salty but had the best flavor. 

We were also so excited to get the pickles. WHICH WASNT PUT IN MY BAG. Wow, wasted even more money than we had to. And let me say this, it was dead in there. We were the only ones ordering and there was another two people just using the WiFi. To me, it's unacceptable to miss the little stuff! We tried the chocolate cookie as well. It was okay, a little hard--don't recommend. 

Overall, would not recommend. Everything was $34 which felt like a waste of money for what we actually got (and didn't get). However, cashier was super friendly."}
{"text":"Best BLT I've ever had. That's because Josh slow roasts and smokes his own bacon, then puts all the drippings from the bacon makin into the grilled sandwich. If I lived in Vegas, I'd be here everyday for two weeks working my way through his fabulous, inexpensive list of high-end sandwiches."}
{"text":"Found Goodwich on yelp and they DEFINITELY live up to the hype. Passing through for work and I can say that I would eat the Reuben everyday if I lived here. Staff is friendly, service was great and the food was bomb. I'll be stopping here anytime I'm in town. Stoked to try all their sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Litterally THE best sandwich I've EVER had in my entire life. I got the Ruben-ish. The bread perfectly crisp, long roasted and flavorful meat, not too much kraut, delicious home made sauce. Like I said, I'm in LOVE!!!!!! I'm coming back here litterally every day I'm in Vegas!!!!!! I'd give it 10 stars if I could, and I'm reallllllllllllllly picky. Best find in Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing samich spot!!  I had the Reuben and my wife had the patty, both were amazing. Definitely coming back to this place. AAAAA++++++ for us. 
Thanks guys."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich an service. I was very impressed. Small little place that's big on great food and great customer service. Awesome!! 

Only outdoor seating"}
{"text":"When I saw a sandwich spot seemed to be the best reviewed restaurant near, I wasn't super impressed. I'm not normally a huge sandwich person. But the menu sounded interesting and it was a few minute drives from the North Outlet Mall.

First, make sure you type in the address on Waze because the restaurant moved and Waze might take you to a spot a ways down Las Vegas Blvd.

The only problem we had was figuring out what to order. Everything sounded amazing. The beef patty thing - really good, but my girlfriend got the fish sandwich and thought it was one of the best sandwiches of her life. I thought the same about the egg salad sandwich. (Yes, we got three sandwiches for two people because I was feeling greedy).

The sandwiches take a little while to prepare (likely because everything is made fresh), but it's so worth it. Great staff, great food."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon The Goodwich looking for lunch while in old Vegas. I brought my family that was here from Mexico. The sandwiches were delicious, but the customer service was exceptional. The young lady at the counter, was really patient and helpful while ordering."}
{"text":"My family stopped here for a quick lunch on our way through Vegas. So glad we did. These are some of the BEST sandwiches I have ever had. The Reuben was easily one of the top 5 sandwiches of my life. This place is a little off the beaten path in the seedy part of Vegas, but well worth the trip. Will is the man, and takes obvious pride in preparing and serving up this amazing food."}
{"text":"I love this place! Service is very friendly and knowledgable. 

The sandwiches came out in a good time. All so delicious every time I goi am not disappointed. And I love the fact that their menu changes every so often so I can try something new without getting bored with the menu. 

The Le Pig is my favorite! I get it on wheat, and oh my gosh flavor explosion! Housemade pickled veggies with pulled pork! Amazing!"}
{"text":"As far as sandwiches go, this is an excellent, inspired, and sinfully delicious place!  What a wonderful surprise!  Highly recommended :-)"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches that are pleasing to the taste buds. Beyond friendly service makes coming here a real treat."}
{"text":"Not your typical sandwiches!  it's a goodwich!  I had three goodwiches!  I could not believe that the first one was that good.  By the third, I was not hungry, but was still wanting to put it down because they were Yummy!  Wanna try their entire menu!"}
{"text":"Love this lil spot! Ordered the falafel sandwich and was blown away at how yummy it was. I'm a vegetarian so I was happy to see there were at least a few options on the menu. Super friendly, great location and open late on weekends! This will definitely be the new go-to:)"}
{"text":"Absolutely an AMAZING place to eat! Everything on the menu is so deliciously good, the staff is friendly, this is vegetarian friendly as well! We go here every time we go to Vegas!"}
{"text":"Quick service with the text app. Text your order, get a reply and drive over and your food will be ready. I was a bit hesitant to use the service but was impressed with how it worked. The staff was friendly and food good though the avocado on the sandwich was a bit hard. The pork was good but could have used more seasoning. The veggies were the sandwich were grilled just right and had an excellent flavor."}
{"text":"Awesome little sandwich shop. A must visit in Las Vegas.

I picked up a corn beef, dijon, garlic mayo, provolone, on toasted white. Best corned beef I have ever had. 

Do not pass up this awesome combo. Ask for the Rizzo."}
{"text":"I went to The Goodwich based on a recommendation by a friend. They suggested the Patty melt, so that's what I ordered. So delicious, especially the marble bread choice! I so wish it wasn't a 15 mile drive for me to get there so I have only ordered the Patty each time I do go (because I know I'm going to love it). I was a customer when they were in their little shack and now finally made it to the brick and mortar. I am ready to try something different now. Awesome staff and the owners are always upbeat. Love the positive atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome little sandwich \"shop\" with great service and delicious food.  It's really easy to just text them your order and have it ready for you in 10-15min.  Have had the falafel which is great, but my favorite is street corn + fried egg."}
{"text":"I've been here countless times and may I say that I have never been disappointed. 
All the sandwiches that I have tried are super delicious!

One of the sandwiches that I have tried was the Reuben-ish Sandwhich which I really enjoyed. Generally I don't like corned beef hash, but theirs is delicious, not too salty, with a nice sour kraut that complements it really well.

I've also tried their Chicken club sandwich, and I LOVED the Pesto that they had on there with crispy chicken skins! OMG! SO GOOD!

Their BLTG is also AMAZING! Nice thick cuts of bacon with really delicious heirloom tomatoes and cheesy grits! And explosion of yummy goodness!

I will most definately be back to try some more of their new sandwiches."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying we love their sandwiches. They are delicious if not healthy. When they were in a stand on the BLVD they were great, efficient, affordable, and fast. Now that they have a proper restaurant with 5 people cooking, two people checking you out, an expo and the owner running around, good luck getting your sandwich. i went in, ordered quickly and was given a number. There were only a couple customers before noon, so I expected the same speedy service. Instead, I waited 30 mins for two sandwiches, one of which was vegetarian. I went up to check on my food, was told \"they were checking on it,\" waited another 5 minutes only to be handed a bag that had been sitting there for 30 mins. When the owner himself handed me the bag and I told him that this bag *with my name on it* had been sitting there for 30 mins and I had checked on my order a couple times, he said, \"sorry, we didn't have your number.\" He made no effort to actually make the customer service experience better by offering me anything, a drink, a refund, a voucher, anything but a shoulder shrug. Let me also say that I'm a very visibly 8 months pregnant, which makes letting me stand there for 30 mins and responding rudely if not at all that much more egregious in my mind. It's a shame that such a great place has gone down hill due to ignoring the people coming in and supporting the business right in front of them. It seems like their focus is on customers who call or order online, which is, again, a shame."}
{"text":"You can tell the owner takes pride in the ingredients and quality of food and service. Small place but big on customer service and quality. Will come back. Easy to miss so make sure you are looking for it!"}
{"text":"This little sandwich shack is really outstanding. Get any sandwich monte-cristo style and they even have foie-gras!"}
{"text":"Right on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd. and Wyoming is this hidden gem that makes the best sandwiches ever.  Locals know about it and tourists need to try it.  Everything is hand made and so so fresh.  Lastly, the owners are so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"OMG! You have to try the avo-mato sandwich, it is the perfect combination of flavors! The roasted tomatoes, avocado, and sriracha stood out so pleasantly. Ironically, this was my first time trying something with sriracha in it and I really enjoyed it. Not too spicy and deliciously sweet. Whoever came up with this sandwich is a pure genius! I will be back just for the avo-mato. I also had the fluff n nut but I wasn't blown away like I thought I would. It was definitely good, but I guess I was let down as it wasn't super delicious. On the other hand, the avo-mato certainly surpassed my expectations. You have to try Goodwich, if I lived downtown I would certainly be a regular. I'd like to try every sandwich on the menu now. Mmmmm!"}
{"text":"I had the Reuben today - my first visit to the Goodwich.  I liked the ambiance, though it is still too dang hot to eat lunch outside.  The shop looked clean and the employees took their job seriously.  One of them popped out of the hut and talked to me about the menu and make suggestions.  I told him that my goto is a Reuben.  He said it is his favorite item on the menu.  So I ordered it.  

The Reuben was good.  But it wasn't the best I've ever had.  It was a little salty.  In fact, I ate it 3 hours ago and im still thirsty.

I'll be back.  next time I'll order the chicken sandwich."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal!  The sandwiches are so good and everyone who works there is super friendly!  I love the Cold Brown, and I ALWAYS get a cookie when I order, they are amazing!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot about this place and finally got a chance to visit and taste the food. Supporting my new healthy-eating habits I chose the Cobb-ish salad and added some smoked withers. The dish was delicious with just the right combination of protein, fats, carbs and veggies according my Zen 8 diet plan. I'm just keeping a little bit to show on the picture. Great place. I'm happy that they are thinking to open a 2nd location."}
{"text":"We had the Goodwhich cater our event. They went above and beyond and provided exceptional service. The food was fabulous too. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Goodwiches and Good-location!

The wifie and I decided to check out the Goodwich after hearing so many good things about this place. We ordered the Foie and the Le Pig. Both were excellent sandwiches and were well thought out. 

Let's start with the Le Pig. This had a great balance of both flavor and texture. The lime ginger radish\slaw went well with the rich pork and the crunchy texture of the chicharones made it all come together. It somewhat reminded me of a torta (Mexican sandwich) without the beans. 

The Foie was a little bit more interesting. The Foie pate was paired with somewhat of a cabbage jam which made it a little sweet and chicken skin which again added the crispy texture. In my opinion I would have added a few more extra pieces of chicken skin as it got masked by the strong flavor of the foie. I would recommend getting either their house pickles or their pickled beets along with this sandwich to cut through the richness of the sandwich.
 
I want to come back and try a few of their other sandwiches, maybe even create my own (fried egg with lots of chicken skin and bacon) mmmm I can feel my heart slowing down.
 
If you're looking for a late night spot to go after a few drinks downtown this would be the perfect place to satisfy your cravings."}
{"text":"Been wanting to try this place and here we are. We had the bacon, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich and blue berry muffin. 

Food was good.  It's not made till you order, so it is fresh. Sandwich was plenty filling. 

We were able to sit outside with our puppy. They played Rat Pack music. Very light and relaxing on a Saturday morning. 

Since we arrived shortly after they opened at 8, we were able to find parking right across the street. 

We will definitely return to try again"}
{"text":"All i can say is that its simply amazing!!!!  My husband told me this place was life changing...it was!  :)"}
{"text":"Word of mouth inspired us to make the trip for lunch and it was beyond worth it. I personally tried the \"chicken\" and I have to say it was undoubtedly one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The seating is limited, but I will gladly stand to enjoy another sandwich."}
{"text":"Wow. I had the best sandwich ever yesterday! I can't wait to go back. So fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"I just can't say enough good things about this spot.  For some reason I was looking for a storefront type of place but it's in a little metal cube in the parking lot.  Kind of like a food truck without wheels.
I've been a number of times.  Service is great and food is fantastic.  It's very convenient for me because it's on the way home from work.  If I don't feel like cooking this is the first place I think of.  
We've worked our way through the menu and everything is very tasty down to the pickles.  They mentioned that the menu was changing on Tuesday so I got the heirloom tomato.  A thing to note is that every ingredient is well seasoned.  This makes a huge difference in the final product."}
{"text":"Still as good as ever. Although I'm not sure the texting your order before you go thing works out very well. Sometimes they don't get your texts. It's ok since it doesn't take too long to get your order anyway. We've eaten our way through the menu and haven't come across anything we don't like. If available, I recommend trying the pickled vegetables and ask to see if they have any specials that day. Once they had a rabbit sandwich and it was divine! Also, the rye is hands down the best bread they have. It pairs nicely with everything (except maybe the Fluff n Nut). 

We normally just eat in the car and hop next door to Art of Flavors for a sweet treat."}
{"text":"I've taken 3 or 4 people here for a sandwich after drinks and they have all ended up going back. I'll usually grab a Chicken or Ham& with every intention of stopping there. It never works. The Fluff & Nutt or PBB&J is always close behind. The owners are solid guys that are really into what they do."}
{"text":"The taste is there. There is no doubt about that. I just wish their wrapping was more convenient. They don't have tables so you have to eat in your car or on their side chairs. It would be a lot more convenient if they wrapped it as if you were going to eat in your car like in n out."}
{"text":"Hubby says, \"That might have been the best sandwich I've had since moving to Vegas.\" He had the ham. I had chicken which was equally phenomenal.  I have a feeling I would have been happy with any of the dozen or so selections. The co-owners, Jake and Joshua, are as nice as can be all the while raising the bar for sandwiches in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Best sandwich joint in town hands down! The chicken, Le Pig, Patty, Foie...all amazing!"}
{"text":"We were originally going to eat at the Stratosphere but the menu wasn't what we were looking for and it seemed overpriced. We found the Goodwich on yelp and walked a few blocks down to it. We were NOT disappointed. Two sandwiches and two waters for about $20. We got the patty, which had tender juicy meat, gooey cheese, and a delicious flavor. We also got the chive turkey, which was unlike anything I have ever eaten--moist turkey breast, chicken skin (sounds gross but was amazing), housemade cheese spread, cranberries, and arugula. Served quick and hot. I was really sad when my sandwich was gone. Wish I lived closer so I could go more often!!!!"}
{"text":"Goodwich - ordered the Egg Salad again! Never disappoints. Sandwich fans what are you waiting for?!"}
{"text":"Had the ANTIHERO and my wife had the ART HEART DIP today and it was f****** phenomenal . Fellas we're super chill, Sam , Jun , and Alex hooked it up !!!! Thanx guys!!!!!! I'll see you again soon !"}
{"text":"YUUUUMMM!!! The PBBJ sandwich is delish!!!  A must stop and try!!  Josh and Jake are great hosts with an intricate menu of the classic sandwiches!"}
{"text":"What more do you need to say,  fantastic filling simple friendly food!  The patty, pate & the classic Grilled cheese are a must this place is a home run and can simply be put as a must visit often"}
{"text":"El Pig with bacon. Pork lovers dream. Avocado and tangy chile slaw. Toasted rye bread. This ia without a doubt the best sandwich downtown has to offer."}
{"text":"I've tried quite a few sandwiches from here and I have never been disappointed! Once we ordered delivery and it came a bit later than estimated, it still didn't take long, just longer than they said it would, they gave us a partial discount and a couple really good ginger cookies. The new location has really great decor, bright and open. You can see the whole kitchen. Everyone has been friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"It's great to be able to text in an order, also greatly appreciate the menu spanning the $3-$9 dollar range. Food was good, but not spectacular,- tried egg, grilled cheese, chicken, ham & roasted carrot."}
{"text":"Really love the vibe of this sandwich shop! Plus the food is good! Great takes on traditional sandwiches and great chips. Ambience is fun and they have outdoor seating. Dogs welcome!!"}
{"text":"The food is very good but the wait just to get a sandwich is over 30 min. I've ordered here several times because it's close to work but each time it takes forever! Staff is friendly. Very limited seating area. If it weren't for the long wait id give a higher rating."}
{"text":"A new place that just opened today...another GREAT addition to all the fun, cool places to eat downtown!! 

Owned and operated by 2 guys who say they've been in the fine dining world of F&B here in Vegas for awhile...decided to take everything they learned, and open up a unique twist on making sandwiches.

Everything is done \"monte cristo\" style(or not)...dipped in egg batter and fried. Menu items go from $3 up to $9. I really loved the sandwich with foie and crisp chicken skin! My GF thought her spanish sandwich was delicious, with just the right amount of heat! Then we split the nutella and marshmallow sandwich as dessert. 

Since both the guys were there making and serving food, the service was top notch! They said they plan on one of them being there all the time. Open lunch and dinner, including late night. Both are really interesting to talk to...whether it's about the restaurant business here in Vegas...or the about how the downtown is improving(both of them live in the neighborhood).

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"}
{"text":"The Goodwich should be named the Greatwich. Operating out of the stand that used to house Viva Las Arepas in the parking lot of Dino's this little stand makes excellent sandwiches. Their menu consists of four different prices $3,5,7 or $9. We shared the Le Pig and Foie&. Both were excellent. The Le Pig had bacon belly and butt, ginger, aioli, and some sort of pickled tapanade - it was rich but also had a lot of spring flavors which were refreshing and fulfilling.  I had it on rye bread, the rye wasn't a great match and was a little overpowering so I think if I were to get it again I would have it on white or wheat. The Foie& was well rich, as to be expected with a foie pate, and hot with the foie melting out of the sandwich - it would have gone well with a glass of wine. It was recommended that the Foie come on white bread, which makes sense considered it is common to serve foie with white toast points. The crispy chicken skin added a nice texture contrast.  Both sandwiches were $9 each but well worth it. The person taking our order was very friendly and came and checked on us while we sat in our car and ate our sandwiches. Also ordered the $2 house made pickles, they were sweet pickles and I really liked them but it is a small portion size for $2 and they come sliced. If I were to guess maybe a 2 oz portion so I don't think I would order those again. I would suggest that they move their menu up higher as it sits on the ground right now and I couldn't read it until I was up front as customers in line kept blocking the menu and I don't think I will be frequenting this spot, unless I get it to go, in the summer considering the heat. Also, note I attempted to walk over to the Art of Flavor after wards to top off my lunch but they are closed on Mondays.

Also, I just read Rod U.' s review, I agree this is not in the same category as Katz's or Carnegie but I think they are doing very well for a little shack that just opened in a town that isn't known for sandwiches. Also, I think it is foie - I have had a lot of foie and foie pate in my life (don't tell PETA) and it tasted like foie and not chicken liver to me. Also, I have had plenty of foie which have a mineral flavor to it, the iron as in any liver will tend to lend a mineral quality, if you do not soak the foie long enough while preparing a pate then a mineral flavor will remain so I do not agree that alone is indicative of it not being foie gras pate."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The Rueben was superb! Our party also tried the chicken and the ham, not much conservation once food arrived other than the smiles between bites.
We opted to eat in Dino's lounge as there is no outside seating. Ordered a $3 pint, and lounged. The sandwiches were delivered to us in Dino's, where we we were heartily welcomed by other Goodwich diners and a cast of colourful locals
Only caveat is the sandwiches are not for the overly calorie conscious as pretty rich. If you are going to splurge on calories however, Goodwich is the place. 
Prices very reasonable and the guy who delivered the sandwiches came back to Dino's before we left to ask if we enjoyed our meal."}
{"text":"This place was awesome!   It's a questionable being a small shack in a parking lot but the food was incredible. I had the patty.   The caramelized onions melted into the beef and pepper jack cheese mixture.  It was a perfect combination of flavors."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about The Goodwich they used to be a tiny little place and now have moved to a large new location modern and clean same great fresh food with lots of healthy choices they have even added salads to the menu sandwiches are so simple but absolutely delicious a must try"}
{"text":"We visited the new location in the Soho Lofts building tonight. The expanded menu is fabulous.  The egg salad with chorizo sandwich on marbled rye was delicious. My friend had the BLT. Highly recommend stopping by a getting a great sandwich. The staff and owners were very attentive as usual."}
{"text":"Holy wow! If you are staying in downtown vegas or on the strip this place is a hop skip and jump away. If you're looking for a cheap lunch or a bit of a late night snack this is an easy choice. Tiny \"food cart\" style eatery with a few stools and a couple tables, but the lack of ambiance is overcome by the simple tasty sandwich these guys are serving up hot. 

I just came back from a quick weekend trip with my son to attend his US Karate Alliance National Tournament. We went here for dinner on Friday, then lunch on Saturday and he wanted to go back again for dinner. his fluff and nut was tasty and certainly finds that kid in all of us. I had a more adult choice for our first stop and went with the Falafel and was very pleased, second round I went with a basic grilled cheese, considering you pay only $3 I'd say it was one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches ever, nothing to really wow you but it's $3!! 

Seating in the Vegas summer would be rough, they are surrounded by asphalt and you'd certainly want to be sure you grabbed one of the few tables so you could secure a spot in the shade that the cart casts on the north side...bottom line though...GO TRY A GOOWICH!"}
{"text":"One of my fav lunches spots downtown.. the patty is my fav and go to sandwich every time. The sandwich is so hearty and filling. I def recommend this place for a quick bite to eat."}
{"text":"So great!!!  The chicken was awesome!   Had bites of the patty and the pig as well.  Phenomenal sandwiches!"}
{"text":"The place is small but posh and cozy. 30 minutes free parking right in the heart of down town is a huge plus. We ordered Rueben and Pork Schnitzel; both tasted extraordinary. I almost ordered another Rueben to go, it was super sweet and juicy. Owner took some time to talk to us and staffs greeted us with smile. Exceptional customer service, we truly felt welcomed. We don't come to downtown often, but we don't mind driving 20 minutes just to re-experience goodwich!"}
{"text":"As soon as we walked in the guys were all super friendly! They explained the whole shenanigans to us! We ordered The Patty and The BLTG sandwiches which were out of this world amazing by far the best blt I've had and the best patty melt in the world (my opinion of course) we also ordered the house made sweet corn and jalapeño-sour cream chips both OUT OF THIS WORLD as well! I will for sure be  back to try the rest of there awesome sounding sandwiches! You have to check this place out SERIOSULY!"}
{"text":"Summary: Way tasty! 

The menu is great and eclectic. That alone is enough to get me coming back. I had a hard time picking because everything sounded so good! I tried out the Span-ish and it was delicious. A nice solid balance of flavors. Totally hit the spot. 

Happy to have another great place to eat downtown. Excited to go back and eat more tasty bits."}
{"text":"Ordered the classic and cold brown. They were good but for the time we waited, I'd expect a HOT sandwich (for the classic), it was barely even warm."}
{"text":"One of the best sandwiches in town!  The Ruben is my favorite and perfect!  Hawkeye was also delicious (puctured) also great options for salads!  Ingredients always fresh!  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I tried the pulled squash sandwich, it was okay but had too many different flavors. It's a cool place though!"}
{"text":"I discovered The Goodwich after frequenting this food stand, which used to house viva las arepas. After the oft-frequented Venezuelan spot moved to a standalone location, I was pretty curious as to who had filled the space! As it turns out, the new tenant exceeded expectations with their gourmet take on common sandwich combinations. Most of their fare is pretty recognizable, with the odd flair and twist added to old classics. As I grew to learn, The Goodwich is the perfect next-day spot after a night of heavy drinking, or if you just want a really, really good sandwich."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches ever!   They also rotate the menu based on the season and what fresh ingredients are seasonally available."}
{"text":"Ordered ham sandwich add egg, bacon, and made monte cristo.  I was quite impressed to say the least."}
{"text":"Picture this: a 50's style sandwich stand on the corner of Las Vegas blvd and Wyoming across the street from a strip joint. In the same plaza, there's a bar. What goes better than beers and sandwiches? Clever, clever marketing.

It's lunchtime and I've heard great things about this place from yelp. I had a feeling this place wouldn't disappoint.

My boyfriend and I ordered the falafel and the chicken club sandwiches, then split to share. Ranging from $3-$9, this is a perfect affordable lunch spot. 

There is some seating available, but I think there's only one table and a few other chairs. Great place to grab something on-the-go! 

You have a choice of white, wheat, or rye bread. There's also add-ons like fried egg ($1), chip bits ($0.50), cheese ($1), crisp chicken skin ($2), bacon ($2), and foie gras mousse ($4). I should have added chip bits to mine!

Falafel: kale slaw, cucumber, and chickpea puree between two slices of bread.
Kale slaw wasn't bitter, perfectly wilted, and worked well with the cucumber for that crispy crunch. The chickpea puree in it tied it all together. Slightly chunky and dripping with just the right amount of dill sauce (I think), it was an explosion of flavor and quite filling. Delicious.

Chicken Club: Soft chicken bits mixed with wilted veggies, provolone, bacon, tomato, and ginger. Amazing. So tasty that I'd want my boyfriend to propose to me on the spot in the backdrop of Goodwich with me cramming this sandwich into my mouth. Greasy sandwich but oh so worth it. The flavor combination was incredible. Savory, muted sweetness from the cheese, and the fresh veggies balance it out. Also filling. The ginger wasn't overpowering and complemented the other ingredients well. 

It didn't feel like there was needless ingredient in the sandwiches. All of it \"made sense.\" Even their assortment of some unique sodas and chips that you wouldn't find at the grocery store was a cool touch.

The owner actually took our order. He was funny, entertaining, and incredibly patient in answering all of our questions about the menu. Listening to him talk about old Las Vegas and his Vegas-native roots was cool. While we were waiting for our sandwiches, he kept thanking us for our patience and letting us know the status of our order when it wasn't even a long wait at all! We got a sense that he truly appreciated our business and us being there. Love his '50s old-Vegas style he's got going on. 

Everything from the ingredients; the carefully wrapped wax paper with the Goodwich sticker stamped on it; and the white paper bag with the logo was well-thought out. They really put so much effort into the stand's theme. It made me feel this place is one-of-a-kind, memorable. 

The whole concept of Goodwich is something real, uncorporatized, and individual. A refreshing change from Downtown Project's approach (Container Park is just trying way too hard). It's just one block away from other amazing eats like Viva Las Arepas and Art of Flavors. (We hopped to Art of Flavors afterwards for a sweet contrast!)

I'd love to come back and pack a few sandwiches and hit the park with picnic blankets and a book. Love this sandwich shop and all that it stands for."}
{"text":"This food cart has one of the greatest Reuben's I have ever had!!  Absolutely great service, amazing menu and some of the freshest ingredients!  Such an amazing find!  If you get a chance to stop by this cart (in the Dino's Bar parking lot across from OG's on Las Vegas Blvd) it is worth it!!"}
{"text":"The Goodwich serves up some of the best sandwiches that I have ever tasted, and do so at very reasonable prices.  What really sets this place apart is excellent execution: sandwiches are cooked \"perfectly.\"

With a sandwich like their Le Pig, a lot can go wrong: too much grease, too little grease, overly acidic pickled radishes, boring bread with the wrong texture, and so on. However, the Goodwich expertly combines various ingredients to create the perfectly balanced, yet flavorful sandwich.  It's hard to describe, but kind of like a well aged, 20-25 year old Ramon Allones Specially Selected or Partagas Lonsdale cigar, where a complex variety of rich, intense flavors complement one another in perfect harmony.  

The food is good, the prices are reasonable, and the proprietors not only know what they're doing, but are friendly and hospitable.  Will definitely be back.  Ultimately considering the price point and the number of overpriced tourist traps in Las Vegas, the Goodwich may very well be one of the best restaurants in town."}
{"text":"1st time I've been to the new location.  The patty is still fantastic, good service, clean shop.  Need to make it down there more often"}
{"text":"Been a few times. Tried the Le Pig, BLT & G and the Reuben. I really enjoy the Reuben (not pictured). The other two were tasty, but not enough to sway me to order again and again. The Reuben, though, will most definitely bring me back. They use a heavy hand on condiments so be warned. I've learned to get easy dressing."}
{"text":"This is a long overdue, 5+ star Yelp review!

These are the same sandwiches that your Grandma, Mom, or Dad used to make for you! But these sandwiches have some added culinary creativity, and lots of time, thought, and care that go into them!

The staff has always been accommodating, patient, and work with a positive attitude every single time I've been there (I'd estimate 12-15 times now). That says a lot about the business leadership and dedication. 

There is something on their menu for everyone, great variety of sandwiches to choose from.

Keep up the great work Goodwich! Slowly you'll become a Sin City lunch landmark.

If all else fails, change locations closer to the Strip, and change your name from The Goodwich to The Godwich or The Sinwich. Then have/hire half naked naughty dressed devil women and half naked naughty female angels to serve the goodwiches. Boom, Your welcome. Make sure I eat for free for life is my only request. 

Stop reading my review and go get a Goodwich!"}
{"text":"Great Vegas original place!   Unique menu and great service.   Gluten free items available too. 

You won't be disappointed.  

Ps I think I read that they are opening a second location in the Southwest too in case you aren't close to downtown"}
{"text":"Too good! I loved Reuben sandwiches and this one was one of the best I have ever tried!
Also, the crunch bar... Amazing!
The guys are very nice, great service. 
I will come back to try the Foie with chicken skin!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the best sandwiches we have ever had. We had to go two days in a row because we were craving this food that much. We have tried four different sandwiches, and they have all been amazing. I first ordered the ham and cheese, which doesn't seem very adventurous, but it was by far the best ham and cheese ever. We also tried their Reubenish as well.  My husband doesn't even like Reubens but this blew him away. The next day, we ordered the patty and bltg. Seriously...the flavors were unbeatable.  The sandwiches are plenty big and don't sit heavy.  This is the type of food you see on tv and crave but don't think it actually exists in real life.  Even if the service was terrible I would go back just for the food, but luckily that isn't the case. The guys who work there are extremely nice and helpful and give more than five star service. By far, our new favorite place in town."}
{"text":"Excellent sandwich!  Had the Cuban and satires every bit.  My friends have recommended this place for a long time and I am so sad I didn't visit sooner."}
{"text":"Awesome food by an awesome group of guys!

We came by about 930pm (after reading great reviews about them) and it just so happened that they had just closed for the night at 9pm.

However after a short conversation with Josh, tired as he was....this owner gladly fired up the grill and went ahead and made us a couple delicious sandwiches!!!

The Fluff and Nut Sandwich was epic: Grilled buttered wheat toast with nutella, roasted marshmallows, and Nestle Crunch!! Mmmmmmmmm.....

I wish Goodwich the best, only been three weeks and already talking about more locations? That is AWESOME!!

6 Stars!!!!"}
{"text":"Fun little place. The falafel sandwich was great. A lot of effort goes into making the sandwiches here."}
{"text":"We had the Patty on marble rye bread and Reuben-ish on wheat. It was so good. Prices are reasonable. Menu is seasonal ..I think thats a great thing, no one wants bitter heirloom tomatoes! You can text in your order as well. Teo and Josh (who I think are owners) were friendly and made us feel welcome! Gotta try this place sandwich lovers!!!!

Thnx to Janelle for hippin a brotha to this spot!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches of my life! Friendly staff, too. I get bored easily with sandwiches, but the Goodwich sandwiches are inspirational. The patty is so rich and flavorful without being greasy or overwhelming. The pork of the day last week was incredible, such a work of art! Many of their sandwiches are twists on classic ones that make you wonder how people lived so long with just the normal, boring version. Wish I could eat here every day!

Love love love!"}
{"text":"It's damn hard for me to give five stars to a restaurant without any seating.  So I won't.  But I almost did it anyway.

We ordered a pate sandwich and a Le Pig Vert and retreated to Dino's for a beer.  The sandwiches arrived at Dino's after a short wait and they were outstanding.  The pate was a bit much, though.  I had a lot of trouble getting through 1/2 a sandwich, and I'm a fat guy.  The pig sandwich was also fantastic and a bit easier to digest.  Think I'll try something different on my next visit.

The employees at the Goodwich were friendly and helpful.

Don't be afraid to go into Dino's...it's a dive bar and all, but I've been there several times just to drink and everyone is very nice.  And domestic beers are only $2.50.  So there's that.

I've got to believe the owners will move to a better location soon.  This isn't the greatest area and it's too damn hot to eat a sandwich outside."}
{"text":"I'm going to go so far as to call The Goodwhich a near-complete failure. Maybe I ordered poorly . . . maybe they had a bad day . . . or maybe they just make a mediocre sandwich. I ordered the Cold Brown, which really sounds amazing (most of their sandwiches do sound great). But lets break this down from menu to reality: Pulled turkey = sliced turkey lunch meat; there was nothing \"pulled\" about this, except maybe from the bag. There was indeed bacon, though it was no different than what I'd get at Smith's, so I'm not sure what the big deal is. I asked for no tomato, but instead my sandwich came with a total of FOURTEEN slices of tomato. There was no guryere, but there was some random flat-leaf parsley and a rather gloppy mayo-like sauce, neither of which were listed as items. I would have asked for those to be left off too, but it probably wouldn't have made a difference. I also ordered some \"jalapeno\" chips . . . quotes used because I tasted nothing but salt. And lets not forget to mention just how absurdly greasy the sandwich was. Other folks in my group really liked their orders, and clearly The Goodwich has a following and history of rave reviews. Personally, I was thoroughly disappointed. At least it was a reasonably sandwich, so I'm not out a big chunk of change for mediocre food."}
{"text":"This is the place for tasty sandwiches. Been coming back for more since they had a truck next to OGs"}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time and was impressed. I got the Patty.  Good flavor and moist bread."}
{"text":"Awesome! Food was great and the staff there were extremely friendly. I will definitely go back when I am back in town."}
{"text":"The Patty is so delicious! My first time time being out here in LV and it was amazing.. I will definitely be coming back here (:"}
{"text":"good...... try GLORIOUS!!  Such an array of choices- it's hard to decide! Went with the Pate sandwich with a side of pickles.  Cheers to Will outside- he's super knowledgeable and helpful!  YUM!!"}
{"text":"Went here on a Thursday night around 9pm.  Spoke with Will and he completely described each sandwich with incredible detail and accuracy not only telling us what was on the sandwich but how, for example, the corn beef was brined, the special sauces were made, etc.   the sandwiches were some of the best we've ever had. We will certainly be back and bring our friends!"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food! I've eaten here several times over several years/locations. Obsessed with their Reuben sandwich!"}
{"text":"One of the best sandwich shops I've been to in Vegas. The shop itself embodies the downtown Las Vegas vibe. Their whole menu is unique and they offer a bunch of locally brewed beers as well as other craft bottled beers that I priced in their mini fridge. Along with the unique sandwiches they have unique flavors of chips to go with your sandwich. Chips and any sides are an extra charge though but your sandwich probably won't need anything to go with, it's that good."}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. Simple but amazing menu, and it's seasonal for the freshest ingredients, and you can text in your order! I will definitely be here a couple times a week for lunch!"}
{"text":"The BLT with grits was one of the most delicious and surprisingly inventive sandwiches I've had in a long time!  I look forward to making The Goodwich a regular stop when I'm in town!"}
{"text":"We were on our way through Vegas and wanted to stop for lunch. Goodwich was well worth the ~$9 a sandwich - great, unique tastes. Really excellent service, and friendly management. I'll definitely be stopping in there on my next time going through Vegas!"}
{"text":"In town for business and found this place on Yelp! All I can say is OMG!!! Seriously one of the BEST sandwiches I've ever had. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The best sandwiches in the city? It might be too early to give them the title since I've only been once. But, if their other items are as good as the Le Pig ($9) it's only a matter of time before they're on top. I was worried if one sandwich would fill me up but it was packed with savory pork, fontina cheese, rocket (which is similar to arugula), and chip bites for added texture and crunch. This business was created by guys who used to work on the Strip at places like Aureole and Prime. They use the kitchen in Dino's next door to do most of the prep work and create just about everything from scratch except the bread and some cheeses. They even make their own peanut butter! Other items are prepped and sandwiches sold from a small stand/kiosk several feet away from Dino's on the corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Wyoming street. This is the same kiosk that was previously occupied by a taco shop and Viva Las Arepas. You'll be hard pressed to find another spot more unique offering up quality ingredients executed to perfection at these cheap prices. It's only a matter of time before they outgrow their kiosk and end up in their own brick and mortar spot just like Viva Las Arepas."}
{"text":"Delicious Sandwich stand off of Las Vegas Blvd and Oakey (?) Next to Dinos. Had this several times and enjoyed the Patty Melt, Ham egg and cheese and my new fav grilled cheese and bacon. The people that work there are good to talk to as well. First found them at the LV Brew Festival. They cater as well! Talked to the owner who was really humble and informative. Top notch small business and highly recommended for a delicious bite."}
{"text":"Sooooo good! The patty melt, the cauliflower, the Ruben & the falafel sandwiches were all delicious!!!  Along with all of the sides and don't miss the fluff n nut!"}
{"text":"This place is always excellent.  I love the egg salad sandwich.  Everything I have tried has been excellent.  I recently tried the sandwich with house pickled beets and it was great!  Customer service is always great."}
{"text":"I had the turkey sandwich. Pretty awesome.  Very high ceilings which was a bit odd for a sandwich shop. Lots of hipsters. Chairs were a bit uncomfortable. Staff as extremely friendly. I will go back."}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmm. Fried egg with melted fontina cheese on marbled rye bread w/ mayo. This is one of my favorite new pitstops, right next to Dino's - the gateway to downtown, baby!"}
{"text":"The Goodwish is the culinary experience you have to do in Downtown Las Vegas! From the entrees to the desserts, I love this place. Staff is friendly and helpful. The place is clean and ideal for a lunch."}
{"text":"If you love sandwiches you'll this place!
Service is great and incredibly friendly staff. The Dill chips are awesome and the Reuben-ish is better than I've had at New York City Delis.
Get off the strip and have some honest good food!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sandwiches I've had anywhere.  We have been trying to get to the Goodwich on a Vegas Trip for a long time and now that they have moved into the new restaurant we finally MADE IT!  The reviews did not lie.  That Reubin...  It should be illegal to have a sandwich that good.  Just go eat here.  Do it...  Yeah... It's Hipster...  but suck it up and get a sandwich..."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here yet you need to go you don't know what you're missing one of the better things in life and I definitely recommend it their food is to die for their customer service OnPoint I have to say this is arguably one of the best sandwiches places in town by far if not the best sandwich place in town you almost don't want to call it a sandwich place or a burger joint because it's right in between if you haven't checked this place out yet like I said I definitely recommend it try the patty melt they call it the Patty it's amazing not your normal patty melt it melts in your mouth I can honestly say I've never had a patty melt better than this I've tried a few other of there  sandwiches and they're all gourmet check it you wont be disappointed I promise this!"}
{"text":"Fire fly fire flame. The Cuban and patty are amazing. My girl had the fluff n nut and loved it. Can't wait to come back and try the other sandwiches."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches! My boyfriend and I stopped here for lunch before heading home from Vegas. 

We ordered the Patty and Capo's chicken sandwiches to share. The Patty was beyond delicious! The Capo's was really good too. If you're looking for a lighter sandwich the Capo's the way to go. 

The cashier was super helpful with suggestions, everything looked great and it was difficult to make a decision. 

Their picked beets were super yummy too! 

I definitely recommend this place! We will be back the next time we come to Vegas."}
{"text":"I love this place! Incredible sandwiches, rotating menu, great location, awesome app for easy take out orders, and very very nice people working here. The space looks great too. Soooo many good sandwiches. The only thing I had here that I didn't care for was the huge buns used on the breaded fish sandwiches. The breads normally used are substantial... anything larger makes it hard to eat and hard to taste the good stuff. 

I order the Falafel or the Fish. Rye or sourdough bread. AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Ive been reading about this place for so long that im so glad i got to try it. Its in a high rise building with street parking out front. I went after 6 because parking is free dwtn after that time and placed my order in advance online. It was such a simple grab and go transaction that i should have done it a long time ago. 

I ordered the Patty, thinking it was a Patty but its actually ground beef chunks as the ingredients state. After getting over that surprise it was a fantastic treat. Since it was ground beef it coated the mouth with a lot of flavor more so than if it was a burger patty. That aside it was creamy, buttery and really good. I wish they served pickles on the side to cut through all of that butter and cheese but they sell them on the side for $2.50. Perhaps for next time. 

Cant wait to go back and try the pork sandwiches and the elote style sandwich. Also, they arent near Dinos anymore but a few blocks north on LV blvd and Hoover street. They should really change that picture reference."}
{"text":"Good stuff - fun atmosphere. Old school.  Opens at 10:30.  Get some... downtown.  Brought my wife."}
{"text":"Excellent burger.

Took a while for my order, but so worth it!

YUMMMMMY!

Get that? YUMMMMMMY!"}
{"text":"I've had the LePig and Corned Hash sandwiches. Both were bomb. I wish they were opened later because it would be great to eat these after consuming some beverages."}
{"text":"When you bite into a sandwich and immediately say \"holy sh$&\". And I didn't even get a popular one. I got the egg salad. Was delicious. They even crunch in potato chips. Service was great too :)"}
{"text":"My favorite gourmet sandwich shop and now that I've met the owner who started it (Josh) love it even more!! He's do down to earth and so passionate about his trade. And his staff speaks so highly of him. The vibe is good, the sandwiches are awesome and the menu changes every couple of months to keep it fresh y'all! You got to check this place out. Me, I like to place my order and then head over to Dino's for a shot and a beer while I wait. You can wait in your car and they'll bring it out to you if you prefer but my way is way cooler."}
{"text":"I'm love simple sandwiches, and this place has the best. And sandwiches for $3?! Yes please!! I tried the Grilled Cheese, the Fried Egg and the Fluff & Nutt, all monte cristo style ($1 extra). YUMMY!! My favorite was the grilled cheese and my son loved the fluff & nutt. I will definitely be coming back to this place whenever I'm here. Oh yea... They have curbside pick up too!!"}
{"text":"The sandwich is so delicious! The bread is crispy outside, the meat is so tender inside, and it has so many flavour in one bite. The meat, herbs, veggie, sauce, crispy meat skin all work together so well"}
{"text":"Goodwich is one of those places where you could have someone else blindly order for you and end up with a new favorite sandwich. Every time I go here I try to get a different sandwich and every single time I have to reconsider which one is my favorite. I try to only eat at locals spots and this one always tops the list. It's a Vegas locals secret so try not to let too many out of towners know (although words already out)."}
{"text":"Fast and super friendly service. The Patty is my absolute favorite. Order from these guys at least once a week!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Was looking for an easy and healthy sounding place on our way out of town- this nailed it! I had the Beet it and a side of pickles, my husband had the El Capo and a side of curry vinegar chips. The clerk was helpful and ensured that my husband liked cheese before his order was placed. I was worried about the messiness of a beet sandwich- to my delight they were golden beets, no red beet juice to worry about! Friendly people, tasty food, unique flavors, I wish we had one in Salt Lake!"}
{"text":"Patty melt with fried egg and bacon. So good. I postmates from here a couple times a month and it's always super fast and well made. Chips are crunchy and amazing. Coffee is great. And price is just right!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely spectacular! If you're looking for some unique flavors, buckle up! I'm a vegetarian, and was so excited by all the different veggie options! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"There are only 2 other places in town that I've enjoyed sandwiches from, but this place tops them all!!  

There is just something about someone else making you a sandwich that makes it taste better! Goodwich however, makes you want to make everyday a sandwich day!  

On this trip, the husband and I shared the Fluff and Nut which consisted of crunchy Nutella, and Marshmallow and we had it Monte Cristo style on wheat, which tasted almost like a smores sandwich.  We also tried the egg, cheddar, and bacon sandwich on white which was perfectly cooked.  Last we tried their famous Foie, which had crispy chicken skin, cabbage, almonds, onion jam, Foie Gras Mousse.   All were delicious but the winner so far is the Foie!!!! Lucky to have had the last one of the day!! 

From what the owners shared, they have plans of opening up a shop and though I can't wait for them to expand I hope they keep this cute and convenient stand too! Now back to daydreaming about their sandwiches!!!"}
{"text":"Break away from your old sandwich routine and give this cool joint a try. Interesting combos to be found on the changing menu and each is prepared with care (takes a touch longer as a result, but worth the wait). And a tip of the hat to the owner, who is a fellow Hawkeye."}
{"text":"Egg salad, chicken, and patty melt are delicious!  All the pickles, beets, plums are fabulous. They will be catering our next corporate event. Great food guys!"}
{"text":"Came here to grab a quick lunch. Items include Le Pig and Chicken - were both great in quality. I'll probably try sweet item next time."}
{"text":"Came into the restaurant post lunch to order one sandwich and it is taking 30 minutes to make one sandwich, very slow service"}
{"text":"Creative and tasty sandwich.  Delicious desserts and coffee.  Super cool owners and employees.  If you're in Vegas and want a sandwich...or pie, cookie or coffee, then hit this joint up."}
{"text":"Had this place 3 years ago when they were a food stand right off the strip. Now it's a cozy little shop in the food district. I've been thinking about the food non stop for three years and raved about it and it did not disappoint. I got the rubenish, my boyfriend for the el pollo cuerdo and my mom got the fish-o side of chips, pickles, pickled beets and goat cheese. Amazing everything was fresh, prepared with care and delicious. Can't believe I missed this place the last three years. can't wait to return."}
{"text":"I work nearby and wanted something different. Thought the menu sounded interesting but wasn't overwhelmed. Well, let me tell you that these sandwiches are some of the best I've ever tasted! We ordered the chix fix (crispy & tasty), the daily special \"Spanish\" with mortadella, chorizo & olive tapenade (super different and full of flavor, the crispy bread made it) and the egg salad (truly the best I've ever tasted, the bacon & chip bits put it over the top). Definitely will be back for more. Very good!"}
{"text":"Sandwiches pretty much consist of half of my diet these days because they're so easy and convenient. Plus you can fit so much flavor and many combinations in a handheld form.

With that being said, I'm always looking for unique sandwich places and I found it! The Goodwich was kind of hard to find as my GPS was taking me around and around the block, but that's okay because when I finally did find it, I had worked up a pretty good appetite.

The shop was very clean and had sleek and modern lines. It definitely gives the surrounding area a needed facelift. We were greeted right away and the cashier was enthusiastic to go over the menu with us since it was our first time. 

The thing I like most about the Goodwich and what sets it apart are the various options. Many other sandwich shops have a menu that never ever changes, but the Goodwich changes their menu seasonally. Plus they have their base menu which offers a different taste from other shops. On top of that, there are additional topping options that you can add to most of the base sandwiches. 

We ordered the Patty, the Tomato, and the street corn sandwiches. My sandwich was the tomato, but I added pulled turkey to make it a little more meaty. The sandwich was juicy and was just the kind of different I was looking for after having 163637382 Italian sandwiches. Haha. I also had a side of potato salad, which the shop dressed up street corn style. I'm assuming that changes with the season as well. The potato salad was good and had a good crunch that set it even further apart from a traditional potato salad.

I also really like that the shop has a rewards program that automatically links to your payment card as opposed to having to keep track of a stamp card.

I really liked the Goodwich and they made an excellent first impression. I will be back."}
{"text":"You gotta head on over to the Goodwich! It's the newest place which has taken over the kiosk that used to sell arepas. Yes that little shack right in front of Dino's Lounge. \"The Foie\" with foie gras mousse was absolutely divine! I'm still drooling over it! 
 
They sell a variety of sandwiches all made from scratch, quality ingredients, from good ol comfort food grilled cheese, corned beef made in house to gourmet ones with Foie gras.  The menu consists of 3 different sandwiches in each of the prices points of $3,5,7 & 9 dollars. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-goodwich-las-vegas?select=mErnsRlLQ-9ayHB7-iUMvA#mErnsRlLQ-9ayHB7-iUMvA  For THREE DOLLARS you  get your choice of a grilled cheese, fried egg or a nutella sandwich. THREE DOLLARS!!!  You can also add a fried egg, bacon, crispy chicken skin, foie gras and make it your own style for a nominal charge. It's a regular sized sammie as well. So it's pretty filling. 
 
Love the textures and nice flavors going on with \"The Foie\" It had a whipped Foie Gras mousse spread, almonds. There subtle sweetness to it...I think raisins or some kind of fig jam?...  It was also layered with crispy chicken skin and cabbage. Toasted Rye bread was my choice for this gourmet sandwich. Like I said it was so good. Worth the nine bucks to me.
 
The guys who own and run the place are cool. We met Jake. He took our orders. Cool that he already is recognizing his returning customers. Shout out to the guy who made the sandwiches. They are delicious!  Oh also if you have the foie gras sandwich, it goes great with the Rose gelato over at Art of Flavors!

Heads up: they take both cards and cash. They're open late (1am!!!) on some nights now. It's a food stand so no dining area except for the few stylish white chairs and stools for seating. So it's basically take and go kinda spot. There is parking available since they share the same parking lot with Dino's. They mention on the menu you can call or text your order in advance.  Im so doing that  just to make sure I get the Foie, because I know that's going to be one of the hottest sandwiches and it's  gonna fly out that window!"}
{"text":"It feels like I've been waiting ages for Goodwich to move into their new location! Don't get thrown off by the address, it's in the ground floor of Soho Lofts, but you have to turn on Hoover to find it. Try to snag street parking.

PBB&J: peanut butter + pepper jam + bacon. A bit too sweet for me but I really like the red pepper jelly. Definitely needs a glass of milk to go down.
BLTG: bacon + greens + good tomato + grits. Subbing greens for lettuce made this more mushy and less fresh than standard BLTs, but in a good way. The bacon cheddar grits really take this to the next level. 
FALAFEL: green pea falafel + chickpea puree + kale slaw + cucumber. One of the closest things to a vegan option, but I think the slaw has feta? Super tasty, super fresh, easily my go-to order. 
SIDES: Not their forte. The quinoa was okay, but the cauliflower \"tabbouli\" was just hard textures and not much flavor. I am not a chip fan, but they remained uneaten on the tables around me. 

Portions are large, service is friendly, but food took a little longer to come out than expected. Seemed like wait time was longer than at their previous, smaller location. That said, I like the open kitchen and will be back. They have a daily HH, brew Mothership coffees, and offer desserts. Breakfast, beer, and wine are coming soon!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place!  I was in town and looking for a good spot to eat at. I decided to try out \"The Goodwich\".  Everything was great from the start. The atmosphere which was rocking some 90's hip hop music and the NCAA Hoops games on the tv made for a great time. The  staff was very friendly from the start.  At first glance, I noticed their stellar choice of beers.  Oskar Blues is one of my favorite!!!!  I enjoyed talking to the manager who educated me on local beers that they recently got on tap.  After getting the recommendations from the staff, I decided to go with the Reuben and the curry/vinegar chips.  The sandwich was very rich in flavor and the chips were very interesting in flavor and surprisingly good.  I will definitely come back here next time I'm in the area. Strong Work to \"The Goodwich\"!!!!"}
{"text":"If you are in the area and in need of a brunch spot I would most definitely recommend this spot. Everyones food came out delicious! I can't wait to get an excuse to go back with some clients, friends, and family!"}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in the universe. I know - they're just sandwiches, and like, how stoked can you get on sandwiches. But these things are unreal. I recommend The Ruben as a starter. So. Good."}
{"text":"They have the best PB and J you should it Monte Carlo style it's the bomb  and the rest is great.   Great service"}
{"text":"I have to say that when I first tried Goodwich I went 4 times in one week. I brought my husband, I went on my own, we drove far (verrrry far) to get there, and did anything we could to get more of those sandwiches. The next week, we came a couple times and if I could get my hubby who is not a sandwich fan to come back, I guess that means it's pretty good. 

My favorites are the ham (good as monte cristo), patty (oh so guilty after eating it but oh so good! appears to be creamed cheese mixed with hamburger meat, wow bad but tastes so good), and the reuben. The hubby loves the chicharon and keeps finding a way to sneak it on the sandwiches. Tsk tsk. 

The reuben is really outstanding. The mixture of flavors is perfect. I love the kraut they use and the bread is really top notch. I hate rye bread and this bread is out of this world. 

Both the hubby and I were not Le Pig fans, even though we both like pork belly. 

I also love homemade pickles, but for $2 I got 3 slices of a pickle (not 3 pickles, 3 slices) that is way overpriced. 

The wait for your food is long, and has been each time I come. I understand why though since there is just one cook, so I am not knocking them for it. Just expect a wait.

The location is very \"interesting.\" Great place to people watch, see strippers and valet and all kinds of people from OG cross the street (legally and illegally, almost getting run over at times), homeless people, walk by customers that once they see the price they walk the other way, freaks, and more. 

There are only a couple chairs, so be ready to take it home, eat in your car, or stand in eat. Those seats were only occupied once out of the many times I have been here. I wish there was a little table next to every chair. My chair I sat at had no table and it made it difficult to eat, put your drink down,purse, etc. It would be nice to provide a small table to each set of chairs. You can also text your order ahead of time so you don't have to wait. Love that option!

What I don't like is the extra charge to use a credit card. I understand under $5 charge to use the card is pretty typical but not when you are spending way above that on a couple sandwiches. I am hoping they can find a way to not charge customers to use their card. I believe using a credit card vs. paying cash is pretty common. So beware-bring cash or you will be charged for using your card. 

What has stopped me from coming back is the greasiness/butter/sauce used. I feel so guilty eating here.

 Although if you want to indulge in tasty, unique, flavorful sandwiches this is the place to go. The owner is amazing by the way and really cool! I will def. be back on my next craving."}
{"text":"It is hard to be a vegetarian in Vegas.  We were there for our daughter's volleyball tournament which happened to be right down the street from this gem!  My husband found it on yelp and we decided to try it.

The falafel sandwich was fabulous!  It wasn't mealy balls of falafel but a patty flattened on the grill on perfectly toasted bread with humus and kale etc.  MMMMMMM.  My husband tried the pig which he said was great!  This is a gourmet take on the sandwich.  The owner was a hip local who was so proud of his creations.  Great energy and you can tell he loves what he does.  

We loved the food so much that we came back the next day too.  This time my husband went for the corned beef.  Again, fantastic.  

Well worth heading over to this side of town to stop by here."}
{"text":"Tried this place with the hubby today.  He ordered the Rueben and I got the BLT.  I can't remember the exact name of my sandwich but BLT was basically the gist of it.  

The rueben was amazing!!  Very tasty and a very balanced sandwich!  I wish I got his sandwich!  My sandwich was just alright.  Everything was too crunchy.  It ruined the top of my mouth.  I wish the bread was thinner.  

The price of the sandwiches were a bit much however.  $9 for a sandwich out of a stand is unacceptable in my book.  I would say it was a $5 sandwich at most."}
{"text":"Had the BLTG toasted on white. The bacon cheddar Grits made this the best sandwich I've ever had in my humble opinion. My desert island sandwich. A+. Betty friendly service. Cool atmosphere inside. Wish I could try more sandwiches before I leave Vegas. Come here, people. You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch. Knew it was a \"stand\" from reviews so didn't mind eating in my car. Needed to east something in between meetings and this was perfect. Quick and delicious. Man taking order super nice and friendly. Taking credit cards was awesome. Had the Rubenish- yum. Not too much sauce on it. Bread was crunchy and portion was great. I ended up eating the whole sandwich but probably could have been full off just half. Really recommend this stop. The area is old vegas so just be aware someone may be asking you for some change but I felt completely safe at lunch."}
{"text":"Very good place to eat if you're in Vegas. Lots of varieties of different sandwich things to eat. It was our first time there and the owner gave us free plantains. They were very tasty as was our sandwiches. And make sure to put the green sauce that is on the table on your sandwich it does the trick."}
{"text":"Went back for more.  This time I tried the egg salad.  I was a little nervous that the chorizo was going to overwhelm the sandwich as I'm not a huge chorizo fan, because it tends to do that. This was the best sandwich I've ever had! I was blown away, the chorizo only added great flavor and complimented the curry, and the Chip bits  gave it just the right amount of crunch. This is now my new favorite sandwich."}
{"text":"Bummed seeing I wanted a year and a half to go here. So out of the 3 sandwiches, I ordered 1 was not good. The other was OK and the third was really good but it was 10 dollars for a sandwich... I would consider coming back when I know there is something I would enjoy."}
{"text":"Nice yummy place away from strip. Had the mac & cheese and patty sandwich. Very favorable food. Not from Vegas but will come back to visit when in town. My son ordered the  R U chicken sandwich and it looks like a hamburger. The slaw is not cold slaw and has pepperchinis. Wow just plain great food!!!"}
{"text":"A small sandwich shop a bit hidden away but man oh man what a great place.

I first tried this sandwich shop when a coworker took me to eat for lunch. The service was fast and attentive. The food was large and delicious. I really enjoyed it but I had forgotten about the location or the name of the place after the lunch.

My wife then saw on yelp that there was a great sandwich shop just off downtown that we needed to try. I was (very pleasantly) surprised to find it was the same sandwich shop. Twice in a row I got amazing service and a great meal for a good price.

Since then I've been here a few more times and everytime is just as great and delicious. I recommend this place to my friends and it is an easy go to for work when we need a place to eat for lunch."}
{"text":"I love love love this place.

Sandwiches are huge but that's not the best part.

It's in the details.

These guys have put together the most delicious food due to a little bit of this and that of ingredients and spices and it's spectacular.

It's super clean, friendly staff, and fresh baked sweets.

I eat here at least once a week but I could easily eat here daily."}
{"text":"Excellent meal!! I had the Party, one of my favorites, and my mom had the RU Chicken.  The staff was AMAZING! My mother didn't care for the sauce on her sandwich and they graciously remade it for her, no questions asked. Really classy!!  Will definitely be back again!!"}
{"text":"What a find! Great place for lunch; sandwiches are fantastic! I had the Rueben (best ever). I will make sure I get back here whenever I am in town!"}
{"text":"I found out about this place from a server at one of the restaurants who said it was his favorite sandwich place. It is off strip. I had the Rueben whilst my friend had the pork. The Rueben was delicious. The pork was good but not as good as the Rueben. If I were in the area again, I would come back."}
{"text":"Amazing tomato and aoli sandwiches! The owner greeted us with a huge smile and attitude that was contagious! You could see it in all the customers!  Ended up staying and chatting with the owners and got the story of how they started as a small sandwich stand. Great food and great service are the perfect combination with some awesome sandwiches!!"}
{"text":"Wow - what a great restaurant.  The food was so delicious and reasonably priced.  Very friendly service - will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Really good Reuben and the grits on the BLT & G were awesome. Makes me want to try them all. Have to make a special trip for lunch but it's worth it. Hoping there is one closer to the Summerlin soon."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwich shop. For Vegas, it was a cheap lunch. Amazing pickles and super friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"I've loved sandwiches my entire life. I'd rather have a good sandwich than a steak. This place is legit. How can you go wrong with homemade potato chips?!"}
{"text":"Best Sandwich I have ever eaten in my life!!! Try and you will see what people are raving about."}
{"text":"Ate there several times & never get enough!

This small, clean place is the house of delicious, fresh & healty sandwiches!
Ideal for lunch. Filling portions. Will definitely go there again."}
{"text":"Best sandwhiches in town. I was worried about the portions at first but i always leave full. I always look forward to working in this area."}
{"text":"I will be back to Goodwich soon, hopefully to give it 5 stars. 

I am a fan of Goodwich and admire them for being a Las Vegas hit as a food truck and now making their way to be a brick and mortar restaurant, carrying their fans with them. 

I was excited to enter. I like the simple setting. It's cozy enough but still plenty of room. The kitchen is decent size. After working in a food truck for so long, you don't need much room and can make it work anywhere else. There is a TV so you can watch the game. The floor is the shiny concrete style, which I like. 

I didn't know what to order- like usually at places. He said they added things to their menu since the food truck, which is nice. The guy was very helpful with my indecisiveness. I asked if there was anything besides beef or pork. He gave me two options, both vegetarian- the Falafel and the Tomato. I wasn't raving in my head about either but I ordered the Falafel with a side of pickled beets on the side. 

I ate half of my sandwich because it was filling but at the same time not something I was scarfing down my face. I realized that there was a fish option on the menu- Sea Smoke. That totally fit my request of something not beef or pork. And then I saw the Chix Fix with chicken. I wish he told me those options because I would've definitely ordered the Sea Smoke, but I couldn't get mad because I didn't look at the menu thoroughly. 

I noticed they forgot my side of beets with my sandwich. Luckily I didn't take my to-go order right out the door. They made it up to me and gave me a free dessert bar. That was nice of them. The beets had an interesting taste, but I probably wouldn't order it again because the portion size is really small. 

The Goodwich is perfect to stop by if you're already downtown. Easy parking in front."}
{"text":"One thing I love about Goodwich is they change their menu with the foods of the season. 

Their summer vegetable based sandwich is the Street Corn Sandwich.  If you were to put two of the best foods ever conceived together (that is Mexican street corn and grilled cheese) to make a new food, it would explode brains (and tastebuds) as Goodwich has done with their Street Corn Sandwich.  Goodwich has created the most delicious food marriage here.  The corn is cut fresh off the cob and adds an amazingly sweet bite and is paired with a delicious blend of some sort of yellow melty cheese with goat ricotta for amazing creaminess. Then, there's the bread. One thing that makes Goodwich so great is how they prepare their bread... They grill it till crispy!  As with all of their sandwiches you have a choice, and for me the Marbled Rye is the go to.  The rye gives the bread a delicious touch of sour while also adding a ton of health benefits.  The Street Corn Sandwich comes with summer squash, goat cheese ricotta, ancho chile, and lime.  I highly recommend this to my fellow vegetarians. 

In the past I've ordered the Crispy Capo, which includes eggplant caponata that's breaded and fried till crispy, crispy fried cheese, arugula, and roasted perfectly ripe tomato.  It is soooo good and honestly, I recommend this one to just anyone who likes food.

The owner recommended the Reuben-ish on Marbled rye to my husband about 6 months ago, and now is the only sandwich he orders. He claims it's the best sandwich he's ever had.

The owner and team members are always extremely nice and welcoming and genuinely interested in how we're liking their food. They have a true passion for what they do.  In all our time coming here they have never been less than excellent in their customer service, which is so unexpected when walking into a sandwich shop. From the food, to the experience, to the design all is next level for this sandwich shop."}
{"text":"I wanted something quick and convenient for lunch and I figured I would give the Goodwich a shot since it wasn't too far from where I worked. I ordered the Patty. Which has ground beef, smoked cream cheese, onion and pepperjack. The sandwich was packaged nice and tight and toasted to perfection. The beef was flavorful and the portion was just right. Definitely worth trying if you want quality sandwiches for a relatively inexpensive price!"}
{"text":"If you like pork, two words. EL PIG! And if you don't like pork try it anyways! The workers are super cool."}
{"text":"I can't deny that I've become a regular at this joint and I didn't think that I would become one! It took me a few months to finally try one of their gourmet sandwiches and it makes me a little sad to know that I got to miss out on the sandwiches they had during their first 10 months, BUT I look forward to seeing what new sandwiches will be whipped up just around the corner.

So far I've had the Pulled Squash, the Radish, Fluff & Nut (Monte Cristo Style), & the Fried Egg (all on rye, minus the Fluff & Nut). The Pulled Squash has been removed from the menu since they change a few sandwiches out every two-three months and it has been replaced with the Radish. Even though I loved the Pulled Squash, the Radish has also become a regular veggie favorite of mine. Sometimes the butter can become a little overwhelming and taste a bit too salty, so proceed with caution if you don't enjoy a little too much salty taste!

Fluff & Nut monte cristo style on white has become one of my favorite go-to desserts and I always catch myself craving it again and again. Nutella, homemade marshmallow fluff, and crunchy bites? I need to figure out how to make it myself since I'm going to go broke from always buying it! But yes, get it monte cristo style. Trust.

From what I remember, the fried egg wasn't anything too spectacular for me. It's been a few weeks since I tried it out, but I remember telling myself that I probably wouldn't get again since there are other sandwiches that are really unique and packed with their own flavor.

To make things more efficient, I suggest texting their number listed on the page to get your order in ahead of time. Sandwiches usually have a prep time of 8-15 minutes depending on what you get, but it's definitely worth the wait! I don't usually eat at the location since it's a little corner spot with limited amount of seating, so I always get mine to go. Every order is put in a bag, so you don't have to ask to get it to go! Also, there's a $0.25 fee for using a credit card."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here randomly and we were immediately greeted by a friendly staff. We didn't know what to order and the server was very patient with us and explained their dishes. I ordered the Reuben and she ordered the patty melt(I think that's what it's called). Amazing sandwiches!!!!!! Everything is made from scratch. We also tried their curry chips and they were really good as well. Parking can be tricky, but this is definitely a must try if you're in the area."}
{"text":"This was such a unique place and the food tasted great. The prices were great and for once, we didn't have to wait an hour to eat in Vegas. The owner was very friendly & helpful. I will go by this little place again."}
{"text":"Excellent. Best sandwich so far in Vegas. I got the ham.  Excellent.  Better than I have ever had.  Also got the cold lentil salad. Also excellent and probably the best I have ever had.  This place is worth any hype it has."}
{"text":"Oh Boy!!

I haven't had a good sandwich in a while, so it was time and boy was it good!!  

The Reuben-ish on Marble Rye

The perfect temperature - nice and hot.
The perfect amount of cheesy goodness - nice and creamy.
The perfect crispness of marble rye - very toasty.
The perfect amount of pastrami - nice and tender smoked corned beef.
The perfect amount of flavor - very nicely seasoned.

Get yourself a Goodwich sandwich.  It will be from the best sandwich shop in town!"}
{"text":"I honestly tell all my friends about this place and I can't help it because it's delicious. It's honestly the best sandwich I've ever had! It's even better cause they change their menu every season so there is always something new to try. I am always the person that sticks to what I know but here I'm willing to try everything!! I also LOVE that they have a rewards system but its linked to your card. So it's kinda rough to earn points cause my husband will pay sometimes and I'll pay with my card so they aren't linked together. It's a little pricey and the wait for the food is longer so I wouldn't assume this place to be like a fast food restaurant because the quality is worth the wait. A must try is the PB & J. You think you cant get more basic then that but this place will surprise you. Other then that try everything! The staff is so informative. And the pickles omg don't get me started!! Worth the extra price."}
{"text":"A good friend highly recommended this place for lunch and I'm glad we had a chance to try it out. They had awesome sandwiches and everything we ordered was super tasty. We got the Egg Salad and Cold Brown sandwich. Both were delicious. The Cold Brown was perfectly balanced and tasted very fresh. Each component of the sandwich complimented each other. The Egg Salad was just as tasty. The sandwich had a hint of curry in it which elevated the sandwich to a whole new level and it added more complexity to the overall flavor profile. I'm a sucker for a good egg salad sandwich and this place has one of the tastiest I've ever had. Service was friendly and casual. There is a public parking lot across the street but you will have to pay for parking."}
{"text":"Located at the old Viva Las Arepas on Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming Avenue, this is a great place for quick lunch/dinner.  This is an outdoor stall, almost like a food truck, so seating is very limited.  TIP: Enjoy a Goodwich inside Dino's Lounge while having a cold brew.  Too bad they're only open till 1am on weekends as it'd be dope to have one or two of their sandwiches after a long night of drinking.

FOIE& (foie gras pâté, crispy chicken skin, caramelized onions, purple cabbage, almond)  One of my favorites that keeps me coming back to this place!!  Eat it on white bread and add extra crispy chicken skin for more crunch.  One of the guys actually mentioned how they let the chicken skin render in the oven instead of deep frying them.  How can a small shack outside of a dive bar afford to serve fois gras sandwiches for less than $10 bucks?!  Jake gets a great bargain from Artisanal Foods to create the pâté--two parts duck liver and one part chicken liver.  TIP: Eat this sandwich on the spot or have them put the chicken skin on the side if you plan on eating elsewhere to avoid soggy chicken skin.

REUBEN-ISH (corned beef, fennel kraut, switss, 1000 island dressing)  Definitely one of the best in the valley!!  Awesome idea for using fennel instead of cabbage since the anise flavor greatly compliments the meat as well as the marble rye bread.  Corned beef is also tender and quite tasty.  

LE PIG (pork belly, pickled radish, chicharon, vinaigrette)  This sandwich was alright.  Thought it was a little bland and needed more seasoning.  Textures were great though-moist pork belly (homemade at Dino's kitchen) with that crunchy chicharon.  Isn't as greasy as the other sandwiches on the menu.

FLUFF & NUTT (nutella, toasted marshmallow, crunch)  One of the few items on the menu that's good Monte Cristo style.  Tasted like a French toast stuffed with nutella and marshmallow.  Great for late breakfast or dessert.  Thought this was a little too sweet for my liking though.

Overall, the Goodwich is one of the best sandwich joints in Las Vegas.  Amazing food, and superb customer service.  I definitely recommend this place over any other places in town."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. I've been hearing about this place for quite a bit, and then today I finally had the opportunity to check it out. I had the 'duck-a-dilla' which is probably the most original and the best sandwich I've ever had. Now I want to come back and try each item on their menu. Hidden gem downtown in the arts district. Guys, please open another location in the South!!! Very good job."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches I have ever had! We came from Orange County and when we got here ordered 7 different sandwiches. Couldn't find one that we didn't LOVE! Patty was probably my number one and you must finish any of them with a fluff and nutt. You would never expect such great food from the base of a sign in Vegas but the chefs are excellent at what they do. We will be back before the end of our trip!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place makes amazing sandwiches. 

I stopped by here and had the patty and ham sandwich. BOTH WERE GOOD AF. 

The patty sandwich was my fave because every bite I took, the cheese would just stretch and fall perfectly away from my mouth. The bread was also toasted so perfect that the crunch felt like it was almost deep fried with butter. *eye roll*

The chips were also a must!! I tried the jalapeño chedder and curry one. I recommend both at the same time and switch it off each bite. 

The only downside is that long wait for sandwiches be made but you know that's when it's worth it!"}
{"text":"All the sandwiches were great! The only thing I will say is, some of the sandwiches should come with more meat, like the Ruben sandwich should have way more beef."}
{"text":"Awesome hole-in-the-wall type sandwich stand. Literally, a sandwich stand. Haha. Don't get me wrong, the quality of their sandwiches is top notch, like something that came from Whole Foods. Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Love their sandwiches!  This place is a must-stop for Vegas visitors before their way out.  What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but the memories of my indulgence here sure doesn't, which is exactly why I make it a goal to come here at least once on every visit before my trip is over!  I have a usual here - patty melt with egg and the Fluff 'N Nut (both are AWESOME!), but I've tried others and they're all delicious.  If you're a sandwich enthusiast, you'll thoroughly enjoy the sandwiches here at The Goodwich because each are unique and extra savory!  Try them, NOW!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wow. By far the best sandwich place I've ever been to. Had the Chick-ful-huh and the falafel. The falafel sandwich is different from any other - it comes in a patty form rather than balls. 
The fried chicken comes with delicious awesome sauce. They experimented and made a cannoli pie with chocolate and pistachios - very good."}
{"text":"Mmm The Goodwich! I'm late to the party always. I have not been since they re opened in this location. The food is still amazing. They have other things besides sammys now and beer!

The building it's self is very inviting. nice little patio outside. great tabels inside to accomdate downtowners. 90% have bags and a laptop. nice to not have to have them drag on the floor. Art inside is fun. The art in the lobby of shared facilities is very pretty to.

We had a sandwich of the day. lot of pork and tomatoes it was so good! Also went for a party melt on rye. perfect! Loved the craft beer selection. Was very diffrent then the rest of the neighborhood. Tried Archer Goose. It is like a berry sour. Was suprised to find I really liked it. Bill was a little steep. $35 for sandwiches and beer. typical of the neighborhood though. I look  forward to another vist!!!"}
{"text":"So take it for what it is, a sandwich place in a dive bar parking lot. This ain't Guy Savoy. That having been said, it's a freaking great sandwich place. I've been here 3-4 times and while I like some things better than the other (the asparagus and the egg being my favs) I appreciate that everything is hand made with great care and the service is great. You certainly could do much, much, much, much worse."}
{"text":"The Goodwich.  It's awesome.  The end.

But no, really, it is.  I never had a chance to try their old spot, and it seemed like forever until they opened up at their new location but I am so glad it's there for so many reasons.

1) I finally got to eat at this amazing restaurant!  Every single thing I've tried here is so good that it makes it hard to try other options.  Lucky for me, I have friends who share.  ;)

2) It delivers to the Millennium Fandom Bar in the same building! So not only can you get your nerd on, you can do so with a delicious sandwich.

3) Their suggestions are on point. I like to experiment with my sandwiches and I go back and forth with the helpful, friendly staff on what combos of bread go good with what types of sandwiches and add-ons and chips. Egg curry salad on rye with fresh onions and curry chips is my jam, by the way.

Just go down, start with a grilled cheese and start getting weird with it. Or order something off the menu. Either way, you win."}
{"text":"I had the Patty and I would have posted a pic but it was so good i already gobbled it down. Will definitely be back.. Yum Yum!!"}
{"text":"I don't even like sandwiches and this is still a spot I would come to every time I'm in Vegas. My fiancé likes to head out to Vegas every other month or so and we always do the strip. This time, we wanted to experience more of a locals vibe, so I asked some friends living there their favorite spots and made sure to hit those up. This was one of them and I could see why. The June Bug and the Fluff - n - Nutt have converted me to a sandwich lover! EVERYONE should go!"}
{"text":"The Skinny: gourmet sandwich stand  - classic sandwich combinations with a new twist (4) Service: it's counter service, there's no restrooms and there's no tables. Oh and they charge $0.35 to use a credit card (3) Value: the reuben could have used a little more meat but other than that it's not cost:quality ratio is reasonable (4).

We stopped by the Goodwich after going on a bit of food sampling at a few places.

I opted for the Reuben-ish and the Hubs ordered the Foie&. Both sammy's were $9 and there was a $0.35 service charge for using a credit card.

Let me get this straight - you need to eat these sandwiches immediately.Even though the hubs wanted to leave due to the obvious lack of facilities (there's no tables, restrooms - it's essentially a food stall), I put my foot down on this one. A grilled hot sandwich needs to be eaten while the bread is still crunchy/warm off the grill and the cheese is still in its semi-molten state.

The foie gras was good. A nice thick layer of foie gras mousse deliciousness, the chicken skin, cabbage, and almond created a interesting blend of flavours that really worked well together. My only criticism is that this sandwich is really rich - you'll need at least 2 people to finish this delight. The hubs wished that the mousse was a little more warm because it was a little odd to have a cold layer in this otherwise toasty sandwich. However, I disagreed - mostly because if you heat up a liver mousse it would leave an odd potential curdled texture. The only way that would work is if you used a solid piece of foie and sear it. We agreed to disagree on that point.

The Reuben was great. Loved the fennel with the mild anise flavor in lieu of straight up cabbage - this marries well with beef in general. The 1000 island dressing had a nice tang with the perfect amount in there. The melty swiss min combination with the perfectly toasted bread made this a very interesting textural dish. That being said, the only criticism I have of this sandwich was the it was a little light on the corned beef. It definitely needs a little more meat in there to make a total kick ass Reuben. Considering the amount of meat in there, $9 seemed a bit pricey to the hubs.

The bread they use is great - it's Bon Bread white, whole wheat or marble rye. The only thing that would make this list of options better is if they offered Bon Bread's amazing brioche. Why? because brioche rocks my world. And there's nothing quite like the lightly sweet egg-ish bread going with foie gras. But hey! that's just me. (I also know that a loaf of the brioche is pricey too.)

For their delicious innovative take on classic sandwiches, this joint gets a 4 starred review."}
{"text":"This was one of the best sandwiches we have ever eaten.  My daughter is still raving about her Cuban sandwich and my squash sandwich was also amazing.  They were out of the Foie gras but was willing to make it for me for the next day.  However, we were leaving early but I will call ahead next time.  The prices were so reasonable and the owner was so helpful and nice."}
{"text":"Underestimated this place for sure. First bite was freaking delicious. I thought it was going to be an ordinary sandwich I could make at home. But I was wrong. The CHIX FIX Is super flavorful. You must add avocado and a fried egg. Cannot go wrong. The chicken itself was so juicy. Not dry at all. The BLTG my boyfriend described was as he stated a taste of heaven, inside this masterpiece was constructed with a couple stripes of hickory smoked bacón as well as bacon grits spread on the bottom of the two breads, the addition of the egg made the sandwich even more blissful. After taking to Will the manager this sandwich shop is one of a kind. Come to The Goodwich and say hi to Will, an awesome guy with great service! The Goodwich is a must if you come downtown!"}
{"text":"what can i say that hasn't already been said over 100 times now.
goodwich is *the* sandwich place to go in las vegas.
situated in a little shack that used to house viva las arepas, now directly across the street and still directly across from og's.
it's hard to miss.

i'm not even a sandwich person but anytime someone mentions goodwich, i immediately get excited and can't wait to sink my teeth into that nicely grilled bon breads bread.
i've tried quite a few items on their menu but my current favorite is the pulled squash sandwich - spaghetti squash, mushrooms, gruyere, greens and pepitas.
from the flavors to the textures, everything about this sandwich is divine.
what i appreciate most about their sandwiches is that they add a little crunchy texture to each one from pepitas to chicken skins.
you'll never get a mushy sandwich from these guys.

it took me awhile to get here but i'm certainly glad i did.
i'm such a fan!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's a little sandwich shop right on the corner. I love the ambiance and the food is fresh and amazing. Can't beat the price either!"}
{"text":"Super rich tasting sandwiches!

I saw the rave on yelp it was getting & always wondered where it was located. Drove past the small random parking lot it was located in & realized that was the goodwich! So I decided to have my lunch there. 

I ordered the patty. Very yummy. A bit messy. Tip: don't order this sandwich if you're wearing a tight highwaisted skirt because it all won't fit lol. I was only able to finish half & it was very filling. The only thing I didn't like was the bread. The toast was a little too well done for me. Other than that, it was pretty amazing. 

The staff was also super friendly and helpful. The cashier brought our food to our car even though he had a line waiting. Nice for me, not so much for the people waiting in line."}
{"text":"The Goodwich is one of the best places for a sandie in Vegas. Even the $3 ham and cheese is excellent, especially on marbled rye."}
{"text":"February 5 is World Nutella Day and I was toootally freaking out (1) because the day was nearly over and I hadn't consumed any chocolate or hazelnuts. I remembered that it was also opening day at The Goodwich, the newest business to occupy that little kiosk in front of Dino's made famous by Viva Las Arepas, and how ROAR-some (2) it would be if I could make it there after work. Arriving a few minutes before 1am, I was just in time to place the last order of the night. Hot dog! (3)

I ordered the Fluff & Nutt on white bread, Monte Cristo style. My total was $3.78 including a $0.50 charge for the Monte Cristo preparation. I had a chance to chat with Jake, one of the owners, while the cook worked on my order. Jake and his business partner Josh are seasoned chefs who have worked in the kitchens of Michael Mina, Charlie Palmer, and Bradley Ogden, to name a few. Nearly every sandwich ingredient, from corned beef to foie gras mousse, is made fresh at The Goodwich. White, wheat, and rye sandwich breads are sourced from local artisan bakery Bon Breads.

The Fluff & Nutt includes Nutella, toasted marshmallows, and crunch (something coconutty.) Monte Cristo was a good choice, as the result was like Nutella french toast mixed with campfire s'mores. The savory options are perfect if you'll be crossing the street to Art of Flavors for gelato after (or before!) For serving a quality product at a grrr-iffic price meow meow (4), and keeping late hours to accommodate those of us who don't end our work day before midnight, I twinkle think (5) The Goodwich deserves five stars and five references to my daughter's favorite cartoons.

{"text":"Surprisingly good place! Check the specials menu often for something a little more creative. Service is always friendly, generating a welcome atmosphere. Pricey but tasty. Recommend overall."}
{"text":"Talk about gourmet sandwiches taken too another level! The Goodwich not only takes it too another level but always looking too improve there menu (hence change the foie up little bit) and add on new things. Just shows me the passion Jack and Josh have for food. Their background in fine dining really shows because there not single sandwich that ordinary by ANY means. Look no further then star attraction the Foie who would think make sandwich with Foie. Creative side adding mouse and crispy chicken skin. The menu goes on and on. Talk about affordable and simple straight forward menu sandwich 3,5,7,9. Then if want too go off the grid add on chicken skin, fried egg, foie, cheese, or bacon for extra cost. Sp you can literally create different master sandwich every visit. No chain sandwich that can say that or compete with these guys. 

I really really wanted get the Foie but unfortunately they were out. You can text in your order so if really want the Foie might be good idea. It the rave sandwich and seems like they run out earlier then later. Hopefully next time I go they have it or need too beat Shirley B too it. Lol!! I was also eyeing the Le Pig either way psyched too finally get my Goodwich sandwich on. The Le Pig was unbelievable awesome! I love my FRIED EGG think beautiful condiment or compliment on any sandwich. The Le Pig right on mark again. The belly, fontina, rocket, truffle vinagrette, chip bits and then bring all together with fried egg. Every bite was heavenly. The bread..........Sandwich not only the filling but starts with the bread. You have couple options (white, wheat, rye) I went with the standard white. Why the bread awesome! It not thin slice nor is it over thick but just right amount that gets perfect golden crust on flat top and still moist with every bite. Nom. NOM. I got bag of chips wanted the pickle chips but unfortunately they were out. The jalapeno bag of chips just as good with my sandwich. 

Talk about personality coming full circle not only with the food. The fact that basically taco stand so no places too sit down. Couple tables but when its packed basically eating wherever find place too grub. I love that fact! Plus talk about greatest free entertainment. I brought friend visiting from out of town. Between seeing couple gentlemen club dancers getting off work from OG across the street, or two shady/homeless swearing profanity and acting crazy. Made it ever more of one of kind experience only in Vegas. If save room for dessert AOF literally right across the parking lot. HUGE fan and guarantee be coming back more often. Foie will get in my belly............."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Las Vegas. I first stopped at the Goodwich about 2 years ago with my friend on our way up to Fremont street. We just happened to stop and try this little metal sandwich shack on the side of the road and it was the best decision ever. TheIr Cuban was the best I had ever had. We liked it so much that we went back again the next day. Two years later I had returned to Las Vegas with my wife and the Goodwich was my first stop after leaving the airport. They have changed location and grown in size, and rightfully so. Their sandwiches are great. I recommend the Goodwich to anybody I know going to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Great little sandwich spot in the middle of a parking lot. They are delicious and done right!"}
{"text":"This is a true hidden gem of las vegas! Whenever I'm in the area or passing by while they are open i will always grab a sandwich. This has to be hands down one of the neatest and tastiest little spots i've ever had. I really wish we had more little spots like this in town but sadly we do not. I rarely give out five star ratings but this one has it easy. THEY EVEN CARRY FAYGO ROOTBEER!!!"}
{"text":"Finally got the chance to try this place last Friday and went with the HAM which is always a safe choice. The guy that took my order was patient when he realized it was my first time and informed me about their upcoming change in hours since they will no longer be on summer hours in September. The ordering process went smoothly aside from waiting in the 100 degree heat for my order!

The sandwich was hot and fresh when I sat down in my car to eat it. I was expecting just ham and cheddar cheese but was pleasantly surprised to find the nice crunch of spring mix veggies and what appeared to be grilled diced apples. The sandwich was delicious and full of flavor and only 5 bucks!  The chips were meh and not worth the 2 bucks to me. Will be back for more sammies!"}
{"text":"So after taking my wife's grandmother downtown to gamble at Main Street Station and the California Hotel, we weren't in the mood for \"hotel food\" from the Cal, although I know it has oxtail and other \"local\" favorites, so my wife suggested we look on Yelp and when I typed in \"Reuben\", which I was craving, The Goodwich popped up.  

Located on the ground floor of the Soho Lofts in the Art District of Las Vegas (disclosure, I am NOT a Vegas person), The Goodwich recently moved to its first brick-and-mortar shop from a small kiosk in a parking lot somewhere else in town.  Very industrial-chic with exposed ac ducts and and lots of concrete.

We were there about 2:00 p.m. so it wasn't too busy (apparently they are quite a lunch destination).  The server, Will (?) was very helpful in asking us if we had any questions and explaining what some of their favorites were.  We ordered two Reben-ish, which includes house-made and cured corned beef, and one Cauliflower Goodwich, which has roasted cauliflower, sweet onion fondue, crispy rice, and curry powder.  Both were made to order and delivered cut on the diagonal and oooooooozing (let me repeat.....oooooozzzzzzzing) with cheesy goodness.  I'm surprised Instagram hasn't blown up with photos and crazy hashtags on Goodwiches.

We also ordered some house-made pickles, which were very good, plus some soda's (from a fancy Coke machine that allows you to add flavors to basic soda's like cherry, orange, lemon, etc.).

Although you order at the the counter (it's not full service), Will came by several times to check on us.  He explained they also serve breakfast and will be starting their Happy Hour offerings soon.  Plus, while it is currently BYOB, they have received their liquor license and will soon be having beers on tap.

If I was still in Vegas, I would go get a Goodwich for lunch today!"}
{"text":"I am a  Ruben   connoisseur  and the Reubenish at goodwhich is Devine ! This is a great place downtown about a 15 min walk from the courthouse. Sometimes during rush hour lunch time it there is a wait to get your food but hey it's worth it! 

I tried the side servings of the pickles and potatoe salad and I will say I was a tad disappointed in how small the portion size was (it's like a little salad dressing size container )and I wasn't really feeling it. If I were you I'd just stick to the sandwiches they will leave you dreaming about them!

I have nothing but great things to say about their staff and sandwiches. Everyone I have encountered there is friendly ! I will definitely be back to order my new favorite Ruben sammich and try some of their incredible looking pies, cookies and brownies! 

Also they have the soda machine in the back with the touchy screen that people are really into so make sure to check that out too if you're a soda fan."}
{"text":"Food was excellent but our order took 25 min when there weren't many people there!!!  Easily would have been five if not for that"}
{"text":"I'm not really a sandwich person but after trying the Cuban-esque sandwich at The Goodwich, I have semi-converted to liking sandwiches a lot more. The Cuban was their 'pig of the week' and it was delicious! The combination of the pork, mustard, with the buttery bread was so good. It was the perfect size and I got the right amount of full after eating it. I also tried Patty, which had ground beef, smoked cream cheese, onion and pepperjack. Someone in my party got the patty and added egg, which got positive reviews. We also tried their dark sugar chocolate chip cookies (!!!!) so so good. It reminded of Tates cookies which are also thin and it was a great ending to the meal. 

Seriously, if you are in the area, this is a must try. I haven't stopped talking about how good the meal was here and I am already looking forward to coming back. I hope they expand to the East!"}
{"text":"Hey hoooo... Will be back. Reuben was pure goodness. Not too much. Not too little. Not too messy. Fresh. Fast. Just how it should be. Homemade pickles are a plus. Good location. Not at all pricey. Friendly. Comfortable. A couple other sandwiches I want to try so I'll have to come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Probably one of our best good food experiences off and on the strip during a recent trip to LV for a bball tourney.  We love Reubens and their Reubenish is one of the best we've had.  Also had the Lamburglar: delicious.  Housemade ingredients make the  difference ...sauerkraut, even homemade pies and cookies made my owner's Mom...worth the trip off the strip!"}
{"text":"My boss bought me a sandwich from here on like a Wednesday, I think I got the ham sandwich with an egg. And that sandwich was delicious. The way that they toast up that bread and just pile everything on it was delish. Its not like your any other sandwich like subway or capriottis or jimmy johns. This is legit like sandwich bread.

That Friday I had to come back for more, and so I tried the 'le pig' and must I say I was literally in heaven. Pork belly with some chicharon oh man!! What can possibly go wrong?! hahaa. And the bread is sooo good like the toppings don't make it soggy or anything. 

Location is right on the corner across from the OG. hahah good location right. But it is right in front of Dinos Lounge where you can wait and eat your sandwich in. There is a little place you can eat where they make the sandwich but since its been soo hot in Vegas nobody wants to eat outside. They also do text to order and you can pick up your order within the next 20 mins. Never tried it before but the guys told me about it. You can also actually see them make your sandwich as well which is pretty awesome.

I didn't know that they've only been there for 6 months, and that's their only location. Which is not bad since its literally down the street from my work so I cant complain. I haven't tried any other sandwich yet, but I am looking to try everything on the menu. Ill let you know how that adventure goes."}
{"text":"I don't have a negative thing to say about The Goodwich. The food is amazing, the service is always genuine and nice, and its family and local owned! I love supporting a business I know cares about our community! On this stop I had the Rubenish sandwich and dill pickle chips and it was a great lunch!!!!"}
{"text":"My husband has been dying to try these sandwiches but was only impressed with the Monte Cristo. He's been talking about the Pate one for forever and I warned him that other reviewers said it wasn't even real pate but that didn't stop him from having to try it. Sorry to say that he didn't like it, but won't admit it. However, being that he didn't even finish half of it I know he doesn't like it, lol. The grilled chicken skin sandwich was okay but chicken skin on a sandwich is not my thing. And I feel that these sandwiches are overpriced."}
{"text":"As a preface, I don't have a ton of friends, so most of my dinners are had alone, but if any internet strangers want to go eat, just send me a message! (Half-Kidding). Trying to now be consistent about reviews, I'll break them down by: Cost, Service, Ambience, Food/Drink, Random Thoughts.

Cost: $10-$20

Service: Somewhat slow, but that's because they are individually making each sandwich, so I'll give them some leeway with that, but definitely don't come here if you're in a super rush to grab some grub. 

Ambience: None? It's a shack on a corner...BUT, unlike the Arepas place that used to use this spot, Goodwich seems to have a great relationship with Dino's (the bar they share the parking lot with). So, while you wait/eat you can go grab a seat in Dino's and buy a beer (do this!). 

Food: Also all of the sandwiches I had were fantastic. The best was probably the Turkey with Boursin cheese and crispy skin. Some great juicy turkey, fresh cheese, with hot grilled Rye bread! Can't beat it. Also great was the Cauliflower and the Peanut Butter. The Cauliflower was a tad messy (lots of sauce) but the crush of the crispy rice was a nice counterpoint to the veggie itself. I was slightly disappointed by the BLTG which, while good, was less exciting flavor wise than the others. 

Random: Add crispy chicken skin to everything!"}
{"text":"Check if it's open first because the hours vary. Unless the weather is good be ready to eat in the car or take home. I'm a big fan so I've been several times. I probably would have tried more if I didn't keep getting the ruben. Here's what I've had:

Ruben- This is the best sandwich here. I prefer rye bread. Expect savory corned beef with swiss and kraut oozing inbetween. You should feel guilty eating this. And don't eat this with another sandwich. Get two rubens if you have to.

PB&J- I don't think they have this anymore, but it's a simple sandwich I think about a lot. It had spicy jelly, peanut butter, and bacon. So good.

Chicken- Good sandwich, but don't eat it side by side with the ruben. It will make you think it's not that good even though it's messy and yummy. I mean it has chicken skin in it.

BLT&G- thick bacon and grits patty. Also good if you don't eat it side by side with the ruben. 

Fried Egg- I was disappointed with this one, kinda dry. To make it better get other stuff in it.

Cold Brew Coffee- Wasn't that strong, in fact it was watery and only bitter notes came through.

I suggest calling in your order or coming when the weather is nice. Make sure you have plenty of napkins. I'm usually full from one sandwich, no side. Also the men that run this shack are easy to talk to."}
{"text":"Yikes the Yelp community let me down on this one, the sandwiches were super salty & super greasy. Really nice staff but that's the only good thing I have to say.  Also overpriced."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in downtown las vegas!  Very good food. Nice and clean. Outside or inside seating available.  Great for breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Very impressed! Smoked fish sandwich was bomb and filled me up for the entire rest of the day. (VERY hard to do)

I added avocado and it is well worth it. Next time I'm going to order it dry and ask for the spreads on the side. Super tasty but I felt like the mayo/spread kinda negated the healthy fish.  Can't wait to eat it again!"}
{"text":"Let me first say this is my first review ever....

I love this Goodwich place! I found out about this place 9 days ago, and have eaten dinner at Goodwhich 4 of 9 days since. I have only purchased The Patty sand which and chips. I love that sandwich!!! It's the best ever. The staff is always great. Great hospitality. Good furniture decor. Overall the best place! My girlfriend and I love it. 

The Black couple."}
{"text":"Yum! Tried the Patty and Cuban-esque and both had lots of flavor. I'd try their other sandwiches if I get another chance. By the way, its a small place located at the corner, across a bar."}
{"text":"Best Reuben ever. 
It's like all the flavors I expected but they were a few years older, more experienced and hotter now. The ingredient treatment was superb, balance far beyond the normal reverence for a sandwich. 
Beer sandwich with goat cheese was also great, ratios of ingredients on point. 
Curry chips a nice step away from the norm and boldly seasoned. 
Clean facility and really friendly staff, it's worth a trip from anywhere in Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious! Incredibly fresh ingredients and wonderfully attentive and friendly staff."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here a few months ago. The service was okay. The guy who took our order did a great job walking us through the menu and we quickly got our food. I thought the food was okay. After all they're just grilled sandwiches. However my girlfriend who's favorite food is a grilled cheese sandwich loved their food. Now for the main reason why I'm giving it 1 star Is because since then we've gone to it 3 times and all 3 times they've been CLOSED. Even though online it said open. We tried calling/texting in our order but no answer or they text back the following day. So we still go thinking they're just busy... Last time we went they were closed because of their sign. Still no excuse! From now on I'm calling ahead of time and if they don't answer I'm not even going to bother and I suggest you guys do too or you'll be wasting gas and time just like I did. Hopefully once they stick to their real business hours I'll update this review and give them something better."}
{"text":"Great little sandwich shop.  Their Patty sandwich is amazing and reasonably priced.  The service was great too, during our meal different staff members checked on us three time, a level of service unheard in your average sandwich shop."}
{"text":"Want one of the best sandwiches in Las Vegas? Look no further. Located right outside of Dino's bar. I'm not usually one for a patty melt, but this is the best if ever had. The Foie gras is my favorite & I hope the bring it back soon. Also if your in the mood for a snack or desset afterwords the fluff & nut is delicious."}
{"text":"Goodwich!..Great!...Grilled!...Gourmet!...Grinders!...well not really grinders, grilled sandwiches, but the fingers were set on typing \"G\" words for this strong 4-star establishment.

the Goodwich is located on Las Vegas Boulevard and Wyoming, a small free standing food shack in the Dino's parking lot.  They are billed as \"STACKED-RITE SANDWICHES\" and I agree!

I had the pleasure of trying the \"Le Pig\" and the Foie.  These are both wonderful options.   the Le Pig (or le The Porc if you prefer) is full of flavor!  It is pork belly with a truffled vinaigrette, crunchified chip pieces, and fontina. The Foie was rich for sure with some fine foie gras mousse, cabbage, carmalized (balsamic?) onions and pieces of almond for taste,and texture.

I saw a grilled cheese with a fried egg that looked inciting.  They also will do any sandwich monte cristo style for $.50.  There are lots of elevated foodie options going on here!  I hope this place does well...Dino's a great dive bar, but I'm not sure if the patrons will appreciate the more sophisticated option at the Goodwich.  I also wonder how grilled sandwiches will go over during the heat of the day as the weather warms...maybe check them out at night.  Either way, come down here and don't hesitate to try anything on the menu that sounds good to you.

You can also text 702-910-8681 for curbside pickup or Dino's delivery."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and stopped in for lunch during the week.  The place is clean and the staff is attentive.  The food was excellent and served quickly.  Ordering could be sped up - but thigh business was brisk it wasn't packed and this want an issue (but seems like it might be at peak traffic times).

Great sandwiches, service, and atmosphere.

A+ lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Awesome. A great downtown find. The grilled cheese is worth a sixth star. Rf"}
{"text":"Sandwiches out of this world!!! Never tried anything like this, different bread  and different ingredients, stupendous employees!! Made us feel very welcome!!! Will have to start ordering 2 sandwiches though every time I come in JUST because I'm dying to try all of them! But one got me REAL full. LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"I love the goodwich. The sandwiches are always perfect, the patty melt is my favorite. Unlike anything I've ever tasted, ground meat and cheese combined with other ingredients. So unbelievably delicious. I've never gone with anyone and they don't become huge fans themselves. Great food, great service."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for lunch.  Piping hot Reuben-ish to go!  Homemade 1000 sauce.  You can taste it.  I will be back.....Tender Corn Beef.  My goodness."}
{"text":"I used uber eats for this place- but I had to call first to see what's good for lil vegans. I ordered the falafel sandwich, took off the kale slaw, and added avocado and tomato. They informed me that they use butter on their toasted bread, but they can keep it vegan if I just asked. The sandwich was huge and i inhaled it. who would have thought to put hummus and falafel on toasted rye bread? My friend had a ruben I think... he enjoyed it too. The pricing is cheap for Vegas, with large portions, and fresh ingredients. Would recommend for lunch!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Service and Food. Was very happy with my sandwiches and flavor. Service is always friendly, generating a welcome atmosphere. This is a must try. Will return."}
{"text":"You want a sandwich in Vegas? You anywhere near downtown? You should be at Goodwich.  Love the patty melt, love most all the soups (made fresh daily), the pig of the week (can be amazing). Best sandwich shop downtown, actually possibly best in Vegas. No pics to post but these aren't average sandwiches they are great sandwiches."}
{"text":"WELCOME TO GOODWICH, HOME OF THE GOODWICH, MAY I TAKE YOUR ORDER?
YES PLEASE!

I just want to thank my homie Al, who took me to have a BEAUTIFULLY MADE SANDWICH for lunch.  He's told me over and over again that the small, covered booth stood across the street from the little area Viva Las Arepas was, and again and again I failed to process that in my mind, so he finally said \"Let's meet up by the arepas place, and I will take you to Goodwich.\" I couldn't pass that up, because I had seen his Foie sandwich on IG! Lol!

Have I mentioned how much I love Foie?! It's pretty much a GUILTY PLEASURE!

So I met my friend for sandwiches on the WINDIEST DAY EVER RECORDED, but that didn't stop us! As we approached the sandwich shop, I looked at the menu and knew exactly what I wanted, FOIE! I love Foie! The dear sir that took our order recommended the Foie on white bread, and thank goodness it him, just a great recommendation!

Besides Foie, the sandwich had crispy chicken skin (gotta get extra next time) and cabbage. It was absolutely unique and one of the best sandwiches I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. I got to snag a piece of my friend's Reuben also, and that was pretty great too!

GO TO GOODWICH! Maybe I'll run into you, because seems like a place I won't get tired of. Going tomorrow! =) Lol."}
{"text":"Stopped by this trendy lil spot after a long ass day at work! 11hr shift ugh! Any who walked in and was greeted right away. 1st time here wasn't sure what to get but the menu isn't a huge selection so it was pretty easy. FYI dont let the small menu fool you though lol...I ordered the classic for myself, grilled cheese w/bacon for the kiddos, and the cold brown for the hubster....lets just say am currently in a minor food coma and happy! The sandwich was fresh, hot and delish! I loved the thick cut bacon and toasted bread...will def return again for a 2nd round soon. Quick bite and their coffee looked delish I will def try it next visit! The guy at the register even brought our food to our table (we ordered to go) and held the door open for us! Great customer service I loved the hospitality."}
{"text":"I was VERY suspicious. Looking at the menu I found myself wondering how all these random additions to a sandwich would actually make it better and hot damn do they know what they're doing. I got the Ham& with a fried egg and let out an \"mmmm\" at my desk at work. stacked high, full of flavor and fills you up - just wish there was a location closer to me in Henderson!"}
{"text":"A nice grind. Ordered the Patty sandwich, and it was very satisfying, and makes for a great, quick bite. 

It is this critics opinion, that the quality of sandwiches at Goodwich might even be better at the other sandwich place he frequented, Earl of Sandwich. This is true given the fact that Goodwich was more generous with their portions.

The only thing that truly bugged me was the fact that there was a $2.00 upcharge for pickles. The pickles were not DELI WHOLE KOSHER pickles, but rather sliced, semi-sweet sandwich pickles that you can probably get at the 99 cents store or your local supermarket. These should be given for free, or no more than a fifty cent surcharge."}
{"text":"Delicious!! It's everything you want a sandwich to be. I had the egg sandwich with bacon and pepper jack cheese. The bread was grilled to perfection, bacon was nice and crispy, and there was a ton of cheese. Definitely making this a regular stop whenever we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"I was visiting from Los Angeles, and really just wanted a good sandwich...so my friends and I came on yelp and found The Goodwich. We loved it"}
{"text":"Awesome spot if you want to try a twist on sandwiches. Original, many options and flavors. Would highly recommend to try this place if you're near downtown LV. 100% would go back."}
{"text":"So delicious. Greatest combos of sammiches. Such nice guys and you can grab a fresh tasty snack to have when you go into Dino's. YUM"}
{"text":"Hot Vegas day, hanging out on a street corner. 

No, I'm not a hooker! I'm just waiting ever so patiently for my 3 sammies to be cooked up in the tiny one-man-little-shack on the street corner. The menu is short, sweet and cheap. We actually came here for the \"Foie&\" madness, but unfortunately the Vegas summer heat had been way too harsh (the foie mousse was quickly melting inside of the quaint little shack), so they had to take it off the menu and replace it with Pate&. 

One thing can be equally said about all of the sammies - the white bread that was used had delicious buttery flavor. Here's what we tried:

- Pate& ($9) Pâté de campagne, radish, rocket, piccalilli. Thick slices of soft pâté with lots of refreshing, crunchy radish and rocket greens. Interesting, sophisticated and playful flavors. It's not a bad choice, it just wasn't our flavor favorite. Flavor rating: 3/5

- Fried Egg ($3) Broke yolk, sea salt, & butter. It's as simple as it sounds - a fried egg sammy! It was too simple and nothing exciting. More on the disappointing side. I would recommend this one for a picky eater or a young'n! Flavor rating: 2/5

- Roasted Carrot ($5) let me first state, I'm an avid meat eater/lover but this veggie sammy was incredible! Roasted sweet carrots with homemade house ricotta, sweet honey gastrique, crunchy pepita - so amazing! The creamy house made ricotta really tied everything together and the subtle sweetness of the honey gastrique added the extra special touch. The carrots are roasted to perfection and have a slight bite to them. The nuts added exciting texture. Not to mention it's such a vibrant and colorful sammy! Beautiful! I would order this again and again. Flavor rating: 5/5

The shack is truly charming and I adore the newly painted robot mural - super cutesy and nerdy! The perfect pop of art and color that brightens up Vegas! 

They don't really have much going on for patio seating or comfortable seating, for that matter. They are partnered up with Dino's Lounge right next door and you are encouraged to grab your sammies and head over to the bar to escape from the hot sun, the sweltering heat, grab a table, and a seat, and enjoy your Goodwich. Just make sure you don't have kids with you, it's a 21+ bar."}
{"text":"Only been here twice so far but OMG it is so good.  I've tried the Ham &,  Rueben-ish, Grill Cheese and Fluff & Nutt, all monte cristo style and all were amazing.  The first time I took the sandwiches home.  Rookie mistake.  They got a little soggy but still tasted great.   They guys who run this place are super friendly and easy on the eyes so that doesn't hurt either.  I can't wait to come back and work my way through the menu."}
{"text":"Staff was really friendly and helpful, food was fine. My boyfriend and I both were both okay with what we ordered, but agreed that there wasn't a ton of flavor profile."}
{"text":"Fluff n nutter at new location was delicious. House made marshmallow fluff with toasted coconut, rice crispy and graham cracker = Yumm! Great dessert Sammy when you nearby."}
{"text":"So happy to find this place! My boyfriend and I stumbled upon it when searching for good delis and sandwiches in Las Vegas. I tried the chix fix and he tried the cuban-esque. Both were amazingly fresh, tasty, and absolutely delectable :) must try!!!!"}
{"text":"This place serves phenomenal sandwiches. The Reuben is delish! And fries are homemade"}
{"text":"These are hands down the best sandwiches you'll ever have! Being that I work down the street, I've had the privilege of eating here at few times and I've never been disappointed! When you read the description for each sandwich, you might second guess the flavor combinations, but they're mad scientists in the kitchen because they make it work! 

The only downside are the prices. Since opening a restaurant, they've had to raise their prices. I don't feel the prices for the sides are worth the size amount. Regardless, if you stick to just a sandwich you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Really good sandwich place and the employees are really friendly. The food can be a little slow at times but it's all freshly made and worth it. Just tried the nitro ice tea and it's a cool and unique concept, never seen it before but it tasted really good and it somehow sugar free but also does not use artificial sweeteners according to them."}
{"text":"I got the ham& and it was delicious. Service was excellent as well. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Gourmet sandwiches at beer prices. 
Heirloom tomato sandwich is what hooked me the first time, but I just had their Ruben. Friendliest staff ever!Another location is opening in the Soho lofts mid January 2016."}
{"text":"I think this place is SCRUMPTIOUS! You can text them in advance for the sandwich you like and they will have it ready for you. I thought the Foie was delicious, albeit a little rich. I wish they had a Turkey selection. They did have a Tuna Melt as a special to which I hope they make it part of their menu..."}
{"text":"Where to start! All of these sandwiches are absolutely amazing!!!! I've hade the chive turkey that comes with a crispy piece of chicken skin I've never had anywhere before, it was amazing! The salmon thunder hands down has to be there best sandwich there all the ingredient in the sandwich are absolutely amazing! I recently tried the ham sandwich which come with a sweet jelly inside and it's delicious! And their customer service is always amazing they are very catering !"}
{"text":"This is my first Yelp review!! Goodwich is undoubtedly the best sandwich spot in Las Vegas. I have pretty high standards for sandwiches having been spoiled by Ike's in San Francisco for several years, Fricano's in Austin, and Naked City Sandwich Shop while it existed in Vegas. This place is on point!! My boyfriend decided to pull one of those \"I'm not hungry but I'll go with you\" moments, and being the bread and cheese aficionado that I am, I didn't care. Pulled up the menu on my phone and saw that first off, all sandwiches are either $3, $5, $7, or $9 (so amazing), and that I could text to order (so convenient). I decided to go with the Patty with a side of house pickles and I was NOT disappointed. We drove over to Dino's (Goodwich is inside), and got our order curbside right on time (15 minutes was the sandwich eta). I NEVER ever everrrr eat in my car but I truly could not wait another moment-- and this sandwich was unbelievable. Bread perfectly grilled, high quality ingredients, amazingly friendly sandwich man, delish side of pickles and beets-- it took all of 30 seconds before my boyfriend realized I probably wasn't going to share, and put in his order for a Falafel sandwich. Again-- superb. The location, service, and quality are top notch, and I will definitely be back!! There are delicious options for both meat lovers and vegetarian folks :)"}
{"text":"They were out of the Foie and so I decided to get the Le Pig. I had very high expectations because I had seen many of my friends check-in here. 
I would say that the bread was so much thicker than the filling I have seen many of the photos that seemed to have more product in the sandwich. The Le pig had a bland flavor it seemed that it needed more seasoning such as salt and pepper. 
For a 9$ sandwich, they could of put more product into the sandwich. 
The service was good and they were very accommodating. I would like to give them a higher rating but I will definitely give them another shot one day. I hope that they have the Foie the next time I visit!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical when I first pulled up to this little stand. Yet, there was a line and the few outdoor tables were full. I considered that to be a good sign.  I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak inspired sandwich. It was around $9  with a drink.

The sandwich was amazing. Well worth the 10-15 minutes wait. It was the perfect balance of a toasted sandwich with the bread still somewhat soft. Fresh ingredients were valued. 

I would recommend going at any time of the day for a great sandwich!"}
{"text":"Awesome.  Simply awesome.  My friend and I ordered the El Pig and the Rueben and shared them, half and half.  Sandwich nirvana!  Fresh ingredients, well prepared.  Friendly, engaging staff.  Don't miss this!"}
{"text":"I just had an excellent sandwich at the Goodwich at 900 S las vegas blvd the staff treats their customers very good too I highly recommend this place to all visitors and people who live here in Las Vegas/ BODACIOUS"}
{"text":"Ok, so maybe my expectations were a bit high before I ate here. Honestly, I was just not blown away. I thought it was a decent sandwich, but for about 13 bucks, if I can get full just off of taste alone, then I would go to 4 stars at least.

What I got was the Foie on wheat Monte Cristo style. As soon as I paid 12.86 (that's 9 bucks for the sandwich with 15 percent tip, tax, and another 99 cent to make it Monte Cristo), I thought to myself, damn that better be a good sandwich for 13 bucks. So after my first bite, I thought it was decent. I wasn't blown away or anything. It just seemed like just another peanut butter and jelly sandwich which later on I was told is what it kind of tastes like. Although the nice flavor of the crispy chicken skin was good, my stomach was not satisfied. I would of gotten another sandwich but then paying 20 bucks for two sandwiches just to get satisfied is not worth it.

The service was nice. The guy who took my order explained everything to me and answered all my questions. Of course you have to wait for a bit for your order because everything is made to order. I think next time I will text my order so I don't have to wait so long especially if I have time constraints.

As for their location, they are on a the corner of S Las Vegas Blvd and W Wyoming Ave across the street from OG (Olympic Gardens, a 24 hour Strip Club). They are in a small shack type of stand where Viva Las Arepas used to be. 

In closing, maybe the Foie is not for me. Maybe I need to try some of the other sandwiches. Like I said, I don't see the justification in paying 10 bucks for a sandwich that wont fill me up. I will come back for sure and try the Le Pig and/or the Reuben-ish. If I am blown away or at least impressed a bit more than the Foie, then maybe I can bump it up to a 4. I could of easily given these guys 2 stars but I had to convince myself to come back so 3 it is for now.

{"text":"Interesting albeit with a limited selection but what they do have is Well executed. I particularly enjoyed the  Reuben.  The staff is courteous, professional and friendly. Since I am a regular visitor to the area Goodwich will be a regular lunch stop."}
{"text":"The food here is outstanding. Our bartender Dunn was very friendly and knowledgeable! We will definitely be back before we leave!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect place to grab lunch! I had a Cesar salad and it just blew my mind! Absolutely loved it! And coffee was amazing! When ever I'm in Vegas again this place will be my go to for lunch!"}
{"text":"I had the Reuben-ish... here's how amazing this place is; I don't like Swiss or Rye bread, both of which were on this sandwich, and it was the most amazing 'wich I've eaten. This place is a must for any food lover."}
{"text":"On this trip to Vegas I ate here for the 2nd time and it was even tastier than the first. The sandwiches are delicious. I had a pulled chicken sandwich and a salad. Everything is super fresh and flavorful. I took a veggie friend and she commented throughout the meal how good everything was. Definitely adding this to the list of places I hit every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall that's for sure but its a great little local spot for some different taste and delicious food. i adored this place"}
{"text":"If I could do half stars, this place would receive 3 1/2 stars. I didn't love it, but I liked it. I would go again to try something else if the opportunity presented itself, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. 

The staff member who helped me out was exceptionally friendly. I told him it was my first time visiting, and he helped me pick between a couple choices. I ended up going with the Patty. It was tasty, but I little bland in my opinion. Had to go back and add some jalapeños on to add some more flavor. 

Also, I felt like the price was a bit steep for the size of the sandwich. Would have rather paid $5 than $7 for such a small portion."}
{"text":"We walked from our apartment over to the restaurant, it is a little hidden, but let me tell you something, these guys know their food and know it well.  We had the cauliflower sandwich with the egg (much better if you do the egg not as fried) and the turkey sandwich too... they were amazing.  the pickles were fantastic, my wife could not get enough of them.  this was a great meal and we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Parking across the street is very accessible which for downtown is hard to come by. Once inside we were greeted with a friendly and resourceful guy who was full of recommendations for the meat lover, vegetarian and kid-friendly. I've been wanting to come here for years and finally pleased to make my way through some of the menu - we ordered lemon chicken rice and chickpea soup, crispy chicken (light tempura batter and addictive seasoning), cheese bomb sandwich modified for the kiddo, curry chicken sandwich and the reuben-ish for the hubby (all were filling and flavorful). These sandwiches are elevated in texture and levels of intense flavor, if you are bored with the standard, take an easy risk for a big reward here!"}
{"text":"Goodwich rocks. 
Had the cuban-esque. Was the bomb. 
Texted my order in was ready when I arrived. Looking forward to trying more."}
{"text":"The Goodwich is a small outside sandwich stand located by Dino's and OG (Olympic Garden).

Sandwiches range in price from $3.00, $5.00, $7.00, and $9.00. They have the standards, (Grilled Cheese or Fried Egg ) to the more adventurous (Pulled Squash or Cuban-Esque). These are chef created sandwiches from scratch made ingredients. When I went for lunch I believe there were 12 different sandwiches to choose from. 

Since the sandwiches are cut in half, my suggestion would be to order a few and share. That was you can sample more then one."}
{"text":"The sandwiches here are pretty amazing, first time I tried it, and it was amazing, my friends also loved it as well . . And the service is great, very friendly and makes conversation 5/5"}
{"text":"I haven't been at their new location since they've moved out of their original location, but the service and quality of food I received still leaves quite the impression. What really stood out to me was the personalized service from one of the owners, his name escapes me now. After ordering our two sandwiches (Egg for me and Patty Melt for my husband) and enjoying them outside, while laughing at how we were eating delicious food while sitting down facing the outside of a strip club and Las Vegas Blvd, the owner came and checked in on us. We had brought our own water bottle to share, but since it was a hot day, he handed us a cold water bottle from the back and told us a little bit about himself and the shop's story. I told him before having the Goodwich, I thought there were no great sandwich places in Vegas because I was used to all the good ones in the Bay Area, while Vegas seemed to just has Jimmy John's (he laughed - he said he still loved Jimmy John's since he grew up with it). He let us know their plans to expand and I'm glad to see that plan has come into fruition. I really need to make it out here again and see the new digs! Just looking at the Yelp photos is giving me hunger pangs!"}
{"text":"Welcome the neighborhood, the Goodwich!  https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Goodwich/1375892382662303
This is a fun concept, in a historic location, with unique offerings.  It is run by locals with a pedigree [check out http://dtlv.com/2014/01/29/get-ready-to-meet-and-eat-the-goodwich/] and it is definitely a destination worth checking out.
I had the \"deconstructed\" falafel sandwich.  You heard me right:  falafel SANDWICH, not pita pocket.  With a falafel paddy, not falafel balls, and kale slaw on marbled RYE bread.
Definitely not your mother's take on falafel.
The cons:  even though the sandwich was made to order, it was cold when it arrived and the kale slaw was runnier than I otherwise would have liked.
The pros: Locally owned and managed, quality ingredients, intriguing location full of local history and quintessential Las Vegas neighbors such as Olympic Gardens, Dino, Clay Arts Vegas, and the Arepas restaurants that made its reputation in the same kiosk.  And this restaurant team really cares and live in the downtown Las Vegas neighborhood.
Whatever cons I experienced easily could be attributed to the fact that the restaurant is still sorting things out. It has not even opened yet officially.
And given the ingredients and unique offerings, the prices of $3-$9 for the sandwich, is a steal!!
I even talked with Josh about doing a community fundraiser in June, http://www.utwnow.org/host-utw-day-party/  ..  more on that later :)
I am definitely a fan and I definitely will go back often!"}
{"text":"As promised.  These guys pulled it off and got themselves in quite a posh location.  The staff is mostly still there but an assembly line has developed.  Reminiscent of In&out styled prep and cook areas that are open and you can really watch the rite-stacking now.  Breakfast will begin in May.  Many favorites have been faithfully brought back on the menu with a few surprising new flavors.

Expect to see the Cuban-esque have lasting fame as well as the Ham'&, but also welcome new tastes such as the Hawkeye which is a giganté crisp pork cutlet served with a tangy specialty ketchup & mustard on a bun rather than the goodwich ol' toast.  The Pate seems to be making its way back in the form of a slider.  

I haven't even had a chance to try the new loc choices much yet, but they don't seem to have lost any of the flavor regardless of the off time fixing up the shiny new place.  Which the new sit in location is very forward thought out and extremely functional as well as handsome.  They have brought themselves a bit closer to the downtown district which is also very suiting.  Hoover and Las Vegas blvd bottom floor of one of the lots.

Being one of our local favs we couldn't congratulate them on the new enterprise enough.  The place seems to be popping off too!  5 stars easy."}
{"text":"GET YOUR FACE IN THIS PLACE!!! Best damn sandwich you've ever had!!!!! Try the *insert any sandwich they make here* it's DELICIOUS!!! This is the best sandwich place I have ever had. I know this is a little over the top but it's truthful and I do not know anyone that works here or owns this establishment."}
{"text":"Diners, Drive in, and Dives can do an entire episode within a stone throw of this business, because the unique collection of eatery within this city block.   Luv-It frozen Custard has the biggest name in the immediate area because of their long history in the city, Then Arts of Flavors's gelato  and Viva Las Arepas empanada are beyond impressive, and having all of them in the neighborhood is like having LA Dodger's battling line up, because you can't pitch away from the meat of the order.   Too me, The Goodwich is like having Carl Crawford in the line up, because they put out a wicked twist on sandwiches.   

Located in a little white station at the corner of Las Vegas blvd and Wyoming ave, it's kind of easy to miss them, but if you're stopped at the intersection, it's not a problem to find them.

After reading a few review of this place, it was easy bookmark. and I planned a visit after work from the northwest side of the valley.  I have to say, it was a very pleasant experience coming to this stand.

My first visit was 10:00 on a Saturday night, and the Goodwich was pretty busy with customers.  I wasn't sure where the line started, but the process was pretty easy because the guy who was taking the orders was on it, and kept track who got there first.   I had an idea what to order because of the raves of others, and ordered some breakfast styled sandwich and the fluff and nut, which both got Monte Cristo styled.   The entire order took only about seven minutes, then I went to work on these bad boys.

The Breakfast sandwich was good, but the fluff and nut was OUT OF THIS WORLD!   It was something about the perfect combination of nutella, marshmallow, homemade graham crackers, and the right thickness of the Monte Cristo toast that made my mouth smile.   This was the perfect snack in a area, where you might find the best hidden treasures on the Las Vegas strip."}
{"text":"Delicious and affordable. The staff was very friendly even though we came in 15 minutes before closing!  Highly recommend the \"Ham&\" sandwich. Great ingredients and toasted is the only way to go!"}
{"text":"Best Patty I have ever had! Never a let down and always satisfied with my order! I'm happy to see they've been able to grow!"}
{"text":"The \"goodest\" of the good. Yup, I made that word up just for this review. 

The Goodwich brings it back to basics in a perfect way; bread, meat, and smiles. This permanent food cart in the parking lot of one of Vegas' oldest karaoke bars makes some of the best classic lunches in the Valley. 

The menu has about twelve different sandwich options with about seven different add-ons; a fried egg, cheese, jalapeños, chicharones, chip bits, bacon, and crispy chicken skin. All these tasty tidbits can be put on a Reuben, Patty Melt, or even a PBB&J - which is house peanut butter, bacon, pepper jam. Hungry?

My third time here I ordered the Cuban-Esque, which has butt & belly, ham, Swiss cheese, and pickled mustard. I added chicharones to this to get that hard crunch. Talk about a sandwich... this was like a gourmet stoner's wet dream. The pork mixed with the pickled mustard cut the salt flavor just a tad and the marble rye bread was super soft and fresh. The chicharones brought me back to the days of putting potato chips on my schoolyard sammie, very filling and addictive. 

I recommend washing this down with a Classic Coke or Squirt made with Mexican sugar, which this snack stand offers in spades. They don't sell booze, but If you're looking for a beer or cocktail, head over to Dino's which is just 15 feet away. The good people at The Goodwich will deliver your food directly to you while you enjoy the latest version of, \"Don't Stop Believing\" belted out by a local karaoke king. 

The Goodwhich. Don't Stop Believing the hype!"}
{"text":"First time there and I was amazed. Had the Ruben, bread was perfectly crisp, tender meat and good amount of topping. Friend had the chicken club, ended up eating half of theirs after trying of one taste. Consternation service was A+, now going to be my sandwich spot downtown"}
{"text":"YES!!! This place is the real deal! Upon arrival you are greeted with sparse, industrial design, that removes the noise of design and makes it easy for you to focus on food.  And the food is good!  Fun and playful, full of flavor, and affordable.  And this is what you should have (in no particular order); Patty, Sea Smoke, BLTG, Egg Salad, Hawkeye, and PBB&J.  Well, at least those are my favorites so far.You can add on things like bacon or cheese, but you should be more adventurous and add chicken skin or chicharrones.  The beverage menu needs some work, to better reflect the quality of the food (instead of just soda and water), but I'm sure they will get there.  This place is so good that when I think about lunch in Vegas, The Goodwich is usually the first or second place that comes to mind.  Go, and go now!"}
{"text":"The sandwich place we wanted to try was closed when we got there so we tried this place since it was nearby and highly rated. We are so glad we came across this place because all of the sandwiches we tried were so savory and delicious! You know it's yummy when your 13 year old says she wants to try one of every sandwich on the menu. Don't hesitate to give this place a try! We will definitely come back on our next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"For a quick stop shop, this place really nails the sandwich and salad. Their goodwich is toasted with olive oil rather than butter (at the customers request) and might be one of the most genius methods of preparing a toasted sandwich. I had the Falafel and my god it was superb. A very healthy eat too! And I bought market salad which was able to stand on its own as a solo option for those who eat salads regularly. Organic, fresh ingredients make this option more than just an addition to a main dish, it IS the main dish. Great staff who were very helpful. This was my first time and will be coming here very often now that I work 2 blocks away at the Newport lofts!"}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite Las Vegas eatery. Goodwich is a humble sandwich stand so successful it has grown effortlessly into its downtown restaurant location beneath the iconic Soho Lofts. I highly recommend this spot for any downtowner looking to grab a quick lunch or a casual dinner before a night out. And for all of you suburbanites looking for a local experience unique to the Arts District's flavor this is your sandwich shop. The food simply can not be beat, the vibe is chill and artistic, and unlike so many pop-up downtown businesses it is remarkably well branded. Thank you, Goodwich, for making this neighborhood proud!

* If you happen to be one of the few to grumble about price or speed please consider the following. These sandwiches are hand crafted from raw ingredients and whole foods. This is not a fast food atrocity with factory style production managed around hunks of overly-processed slabs of meat, all for the purpose of making an hourly quota. You can't beat freshly roasted meats, tenderly sliding off the bone, pilled high on locally baked slices of bread (from Bon Breads) and seasoned with handmade dressings and crisp, fresh herbs. These sandwiches are worth the wait and every penny. You'll be liking your fingers and greedily picking up every crumb."}
{"text":"as a local in the downtown community, we frequent the goodwich for a yummy meal. but today's sandwiches are what brought me to an actual yelp review. the pig of the week, BLTG, was so flavorful and fresh tasting; which I was surprised by because of the grits. on the sandwich . but the RU chicken sandwich..... drooling as I think about it. best chicken sandwich in vegas. hands down. ever. this NEED to be a staple on the menu. and i can't forget to mention the kale slaw, with that feta-so good! and my favorites are always the dill chips. top off the meal with a cold brew; love this place. the vibe, the staff, the foods- A++!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sandwiches in town. Ranging from $3-$9. The Patty is phenom!   Yet my personal favorites are the Chicken and Ruebenish.  Throw in some pickles or fried chicken skin!"}
{"text":"I have \"dined\" here several times, eating the PBBBJ, Egg, Ham and Ruebenish...No way I can say anything but I am coming back for more. Each time I find something new to want, something new to try and the only complaint I can seem to muster is....why does the menu have to change?  

This gang is a bunch of maestros of their craft.  They make sandwiches that are surprisingly simple, completely delicious and exactly what you want to eat.  

Get there."}
{"text":"Great food, great selection, and welcoming service. This was a hidden gem as we passed by through Las Vegas. Would definitely eat there again!"}
{"text":"Good times at the Goodwich! Simple concept here. Just three dudes making 'wiches out of a shack. 'Nuff said. 

My order:
Reuben... Well done! The perfect amount of all ingredients and a crunchy marble rye is always appreciated. Only problems being the meat was a bit fatty and the bread is just soaaaked with butter/grease. Wipe your hands after every bite type grease. No bueno. 

Falafel.... another good, not great 'wich. I liked the patty style delivery of the falafel and the light cucumber and kale slaw were excellent accompaniments.  Again, this was extremely greasy. 

The grease paired with a 17min wait for a pair of sammies drops the ol' 'wich to 4-stars in my book. Still delicious and still worth a visit though. Prob one of the top 5 sandwich joints in vegas, though def not coming close to any of the top 5 from NY, SF or Philly (especially Philly)."}
{"text":"Hands-down the best sandwiches in town!!! Josh is one cool dude and sandwiches are even cooler. You have to try the PBJ and ham and cheese! ( you're welcome) come check out this new spot! Highly recommend using the Internet to order your food rather than calling it in!"}
{"text":"Wow... It's a good Sandwich:: living up to the name.. For starts, I was like ok.. Location is whoa.. And stand is old.. But hey! BRING BACK THE RETRO! Got it!
Up to date with iPads and iPods for registers! Boom! Sold on that:: service was in my face! yes! Yes! YES! Love that! 
Made aware of the menu:: had the reubinish! Because I love CornBeef and Good stuff:: 
I WAS IN HEAVEN! Eating it:: like I died and could roll over and over in my sandwich goodness! 
Will be back:: need to get Jalepeneies! next time! Man! Will be back maybe tonight! Lol:: starting to go down the whole menu! Mmmmm! Yes and thank you!"}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches!!!!!  We got the brown turkey, classic, falafel and beet sandwiches. All were so yummy."}
{"text":"I am sure the area prostitutes don't mind the lack of gloves, but I sure do.

I have only gone once in March, but was not impressed beyond the fact that they make their own pickles and it only cost a dollar. I did not feel the need to give it another try because the sandwiches were not outstanding, just kind of forgettable. 

The seating area does not make me feel secure, as there are quite a few questionable characters roaming from corner to corner and looking a little unstable and hungry. I am not willing to fight a methie for dollar pickles. 

Most disturbing was the person taking the order and processing the payment also helped to make our order, sans protection and/or hand washing. Unless, when he disappeared behind the eatery to head back into the sandwich prep area, he used sanitizer... and in that case, I am still uncomfortable with the amount of germs that can be sandwiched into my food.

No Thanks."}
{"text":"Hands down best sandwiches I've ever had. I literally go here at least once a week. The owner is so friendly too. You might think just a sandwich will leave you hungry, but I promise you these are so filling. Especially if you get it Monte Cristo'd. I suggest getting the chicken skin on the salt and egg sandwich. Actually on anything."}
{"text":"Went here for a quick lunch on the recommendation of friends. Sandwiches is the name of the game at this location. Just a food stand with outside chairs, eat in your car (or tailgate) or get it to go. Let me tell you that I was told Rubens or Patty Melts were the specialties. I got the Ruben....after the first half, I was already planning when to return. Best Ruben (I had it on Rye bread) I've ever had!!!!  You have to go here. Just delicious. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Our favorite sandwiches in Vegas! Cant go wrong with the entire menu! One of the owners,Theo, is one of the nicest people you'll meet in the Restaurant business out here and truly takes pride in every sandwich and shows respect to every costumer."}
{"text":"The Goodwich has a good thing going. A great concept that's pretty basic yet easy to screw up. Their sandwiches have just the right amount of filling, lots of flavor and most importantly they're not too greasy. I really liked the falafel but wasn't crazy about the street corn. Would eat there again if I was a local."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with the wife and it was absolutely delicious. Sandwiches were ooey gooey just as you would want a sandwich to be. Had the patty melt and it was a melt in your mouth delight. Wife had the eggplant sandwich and also loved it! Tried a few of the sides as well and they were also very tasty. Highly recommend the spot if you're in the area"}
{"text":"Tried Goodwich for lunch today, and the ham sandwich is the best darn ham sandwich $5 can buy for it taste and it's a fairly good-sized sandwich. Owner Jake can tell you what else is on the sandwich but I can tell you that the ham is one good ham -- flavorful and sliced nicely. 

Typically, I'd like to have some crunchy chips with my sandwich, but I saw the crispy chicken skins as an add-on for the other sandwiches on the menu that I had ordered skins on the side. I was so glad I did. The ham sandwich with the crispy chicken skins made a good pairing for me. I'll soon return to try the Monte Cristo."}
{"text":"Such good food!!! Reasonably priced as well.
The crispy fish was super crispy and flaky, the kale salad was the bomb and the Rueben sandwich was the BEST I've ever had! 
Also, the \"rocketproof coffee\" is super special and delicious!!"}
{"text":"Great casual place to get some of the best sandwiches. The food is exceptional. The ingredients are fresh and prepared daily, so they may run out of some items as the day progresses. Breakfast items are served until 11 (12 on weekends). We went on a Saturday just after 12. They were flexible enough to make me an excellent sandwich with a smoked whitefish cake and fried egg. It was great. My wife had their variation of the patty melt. She really liked it. The Goodwich also has some intriguing side dishes. Most appear to be natural and organic. The corn dish had 3 or so different types of kernels and was fresh and tasty. The portion size for that side was small for the price. The sandwiches though were large and a value for the price (especially in downtown Vegas). The restaurant is in a very modern, comfortable space with high ceilings. Ample seating for about 20 inside and a similar number outside. Good availability of free and low-cost parking. The staff was extremely friendly, personable, and helpful. The Goodwich will definitely be on our go-to list whenever we come to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I do not normally like patty melts, but this one is the best in town.  You have to try it."}
{"text":"Super fun menu. Like that I can text my order in and get quick clarification on how I want sandwhich made. Drive up and pick up quickly. Good service and I'm treated like they're happy to see me and appreciate my business. Have made office orders too with no issues."}
{"text":"This place is addicting! Love their food . Rubenish is my favorite - way better than Jason deli 1000%, and egg salad sandwich , best in its class . I can't believe I took so long to try their food and it will be my go to sandwich shop forever!  Seriously what are you waiting for; order or pick up a sandwich that will change how you look at a sandwich, you'll never look at one quite the same. And do yourself a huge favor order the sandwich ,R U chicken it is the best chicken sandwich ever way better than Chick fila and it's huge!! Love it 
Was recommended this sandwich  today  Cookies are fabulous as well. Happy happy customer forever a fan and customer!"}
{"text":"Heard about this place, but no chance to get until today. Repeat visits will be made!! The \"Patty\" was awesome! Can't wait to work my way down the menu."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time 2 years ago when it was only a stand on Las Vegas BLVD & Oakey. It was annoying to eat outside without a table in 110 degree weather, so I'm really happy they were successful enough to open up an actual store. 

For the price, I'd expect a little more \"filling\" inside the sandwich, but the flavors are amazing. The front counter was really helpful in breaking down the menu, and helping me and my indecisiveness. I hate when guests don't know what they want or order and just stand there glaring at the menu, but this wasn't a problem here. A little bit of a wait from the lunch rush, but it was worth it! Glad it's close to my house and that there are a lot of parking options without having to pay."}
{"text":"This was DELICIOUS! I can't wait to go back and try another sandwich. I can't wait to take a friend and have them try this!

PROS: The Foie
            The Patty
            Great menu
            Friendly owners
            Eating outdoors

CONS: Limited seating (outdoors)

I wish them luck and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Best sandwich in Vegas!

I cam here for lunch and really had to use a map to find the Goodwich shack.  It's basically a brick and mortar shop the size of a food truck on the corner on the way to downtown from the north strip.  

I had a chicken sandwich with some kind of outstanding spread and a side of fresh pickles.  Man was it delicious.  Sauce was perfect and the pickles hit the spot (though they did cost $2.00 extra)  The prices for the sandwich were fair for lunch.  Only problem was it did take 10-15 minutes for the order to be made.  Pro tip: order online and come pick up the order.

We heard that the best two sellers were the patty and the reuben-ish so I am definitely gonna need to come back to try those options.  A must for a Vegas off the strip lunch."}
{"text":"For me to say there are not enough stars to give says A LOT.  I highly enjoyed everything about The Goodwich from start to finish.  

To be honest, I was on my way to a diff. restaurant when I just so happen to drive passed here.  I remembered bookmarking this place so decided to grab a bite here.  

Upon walking up to the stand, I engaged in conversation with the guy who took my order.   He was really helpful in helping choose what to get... not to mention, extremely nice guy!  I couldn't make up my mind so I got 3 (don't judge me). I got the Reuben-ish, The Patty and The Fluff and Nut. There are NO WORDS to describe how amazing each sandwich was!!! My fave has to be the patty w fried egg and the fluff and nut! The Patty literally melted in my mouth (ground beef, smoked cream cheese and pepperjack) and their fluff and nut? Nutella w/ marshmallow and crunch... heaven sent! its so good, I was sad to have my last bite! 

its a little stand on the side of the road, so you cant miss it.  They have chairs to sit right outside of their window.  Sandwiches range from $3-$9 so definitely affordable for what you get.

You will definitely find me back here!"}
{"text":"a little worried when we pulled up as we had kids with us and the sign was on the same header as a bar we soon realized it was a small separate place. No bigger than 20x20 inside. There is no seating so plan on taking it to go. We ordered 6 different sandwiches and the entire family agreed it was the best sandwich they had ever had. Very creative sandwiches but they also provide the basics for the kids."}
{"text":"Had the foie gras, and am very happy. Probably won't eat it too often because of the animal rights things behind it, but the fact I live in California means I won't have access to it anyway. Love that the people here really care about their customers' opinions on the sandwich. Will definitely stop by again when  I'm in town."}
{"text":"5 stars is not enough for that glorious sandwich that just entered my belly. 

I had the cuban-esque on rye. I went with my GF who has been there before and she said it was the best sandwich she's had there. More like best sandwich I've had, Period. 

The Cuban-esque came with some pork belly and butt covered in some delicious sauces, and you'll even find the sandwich stuffed with some chips for an added crunch. 

There were other options for bread, but the rye was a great choice in my opinion. It was toasted to perfection!  

The goodwich is a small shack off of Las Vegas blvd on the north end, so try not to miss it!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great very unique sandwiches. Killer Rocketproof coffee. The ultimate stop for a great sandwich- salmon and veggie options as well."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best new sandwich spots in Vegas. Reminds me of the California Street food stops without the long lines. I am officially the 2nd customer, a guy named boogie was the 1st. . Greeted by Jake to take your order. A small menu with some really great choices from a 3 dollar Sandwich all the way up to a 9 dollar sandwich. These are definitely gourmet sandwiches you can tell by the ingredients they use. I have not had a bad sandwich.  There is something for all palettes and you can get any sandwich Montecristo style for a 99 cents more. My favorites  are the ham sandwich and the pork loin sandwich, egg sandwich with cheese and bacon or the hazelnut with melted marshmallow. Early till 10 they serve breakfast.

A must have it after you have it!

 Get there early summer hours they open early and close early."}
{"text":"Some may hesitate to give five stars to an eatery without a dining area. I will not. Most impressive to me is the quality of chow you find here. Many \"foodie\" hot spots featuring creative interpretations of classic dishes are too obsessed with creativity and forget that the quality of ingredients is paramount. The Goodwich keeps a fresh, simple menu that always offers unique sandwiches and the best ingredients you will find for this kind of money.

My first visit i had the joy of meeting Jake and got to chat about his businesses. Not only is he a personable gent but he detailed a lot of his ingredient sourcing which is awesome. Bonn Bakery bread, Niman ranch meat, greens fresh from Trader Joe's and unless my taste buds fool me the bread is lubed with butter.

Criticisms? House made mayo would be epic, it is such a rare thing to find. Hopefully the restauranteurs read that request!

If you are visiting downtown or the North Strip make this a stop, for the price of a hand of black jack you will have a true Vegas experience. Don't forget  a side of pickles!"}
{"text":"This place is great! I'm on a low/no carb diet. They can take any sandwich on their menu and turn it into a delicious salad. The staff is very attentive and friendly. I had the steak sandwich/Salad and added avocado. Perf ft combination. Good value."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I LOVED this place. 

My boyfriend insists that this is the best sandwich shop ever. While we didn't get a taste of everything on their menu, we feel that everything will be just as good. Definitely try the Nutella sandwich dessert they have! 

The kitchen is open and in full view for everyone to see. The staff are all very friendly, and the atmosphere feels a lot like Cali. 

We will definitely come back when we are in the area and try the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"This place has the best sandwiches in all of Las Vegas. I had the Patty and my fiance had the Ham& - both so good that he wanted to order another one: the Reuben. I had the salt & pepper chips with mine and I love that they make everything themselves. For dessert we had a slice of the black plum pie, which we were told was made by the owner's mother. The owner himself is so nice and personable. We were excited to hear that a location will be opening up in our area (Southwest). Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad we ventured off the strip to find this place! I have had really bad morning/all day sickness/nausea and it is hard for me to finish anything. Their Rueben-ish was the first thing I was able to finish in nearly 2 months. So delicious, it was filled with melty cheese, creamy sauce and savory corned beef. I would go back to Las Vegas just to have the sandwich again.

Tip - it is now on the first floor of a building and not a stand alone shop like the google maps picture. We made that mistake and drove around the block a few times."}
{"text":"We absolutely loved this place!  The sandwiches are outstanding and the service matched the joy of the food.  Our son had the PBBJ and he gobbled it up.  Hubby and mom had the Rueben and I had the Patty Melt.  The texture and flavor were spot on and absolutely delicious.  How I wish they had one in L.A.  The sides were tasty too - pickles were yummy!  And we had a Rocketproof coffee to keep us awake on the long drive home - it was fantastic.  This is a must-see place if you enjoy great food!  Run don't walk kind of place.  We will come back for sure!"}
{"text":"I found this place on Instagram and thought I would give it a try...I ordered the \"patty melt\" which was really tasty!! I also ordered a side of the street corn which I wasn't really a huge fan of because the portion was very small for $3!  Overall, the food was good and the staff were friendly!"}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to order from the GOODwich while sharing libations at Hop Nuts three weeks ago  6/17. I ordered the Cobbish and kale slaw...instant fan!!! The flavors of the salad were amazing,and I added the kale slaw as an extra bonus...yum! Tried it again the next evening to be sure it was not a fluke...yes i'm a fan. I had the uber salad and tried the smoke fish sandwich, both were awesomely delicious.  I have now found a new location to enjoy for a quick and enjoyable meal located in my own backyard. The price and portions are right on. You guys have a hit and I encourage everyone to try it at least twice.:)"}
{"text":"What a nice little gem this place proved to be. Will, one of the employees was very knowledgeable and was very personable while I waited for my sandwich. I chose to go with \"The Patty\". It had ground beef and a wonderful slice of melted cheese which went together amazingly well. I can't wait to return to try one of the other great sounding sandwiches. My only complaint is that I wish it wasn't so expensive so I could have bought another one. They are moving to a traditional brick and mortar facility in a few months and I'm sure that will allow them to make sandwiches faster and have more seating room. This is a must stop spot on my list now every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"AMAZING! Went to Vegas this past week and ate there not once but three times! Tried something new each time but I have to admit the Fluff w/ Nutella...yummmmm! Don't be fooled by the location. It's just a little sandwich shop but well worth eating in your car, on the street, heck across the street!"}
{"text":"I decided to come here off the recommendation of another yelper.  I'm always on the look out for a good authentic sandwich.  I'm normally not on this side of town but I happened to be in this area so I went on Yelp and got directions. Even with seeing photos of the place on Yelp I drove right by the place still.  

After I regained my composure I found it.  Upon walking up to the window the main guy steps out to take my order.  The menu is pretty self explanatory so I ordered 2 Reuben's  and a Patty.  The total came out to be around 27 dollars.  It took about 10 minutes to make and he walked the order out to me.  Classy service.  The owner is down to earth and definitely friendly.  

The Patty is probably the best Patty I've had in my life.  It's the ingredients! Definitely give this Patty a try.

The Reuben was definitely the bomb as well.  Fresh corn beef not that store bought imitation stuff.  I'll definitely be going back in the future.  They have plans to move to a brick and mortar place that I assume you will be able to eat inside.  I just hope as they expand they don't lose the quality in the food that makes them different from everybody else."}
{"text":"SO DELICIOUS! The Reuben-ish was better than any reuben I have ever had. It practically melts in your mouth. And it's big enough to keep you full for a while! Well worth the $10. I will definitely be going back here whenever I am in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I like a good meat-based sandwich as much as the next person, but to really \"get\" the Goodwich, there is no better place to start than their vegetarian options. Every time they update their already amazing menu, there is an absurdly creative, veggie heavy masterpiece available, if only you're willing to forgo the meat.

When I first walked into the brick and mortar location, I had the chance to try their beet sandwich - everything delicious about a roasted beet salad placed between two slices of toasty bread. I literally came back within a couple days to get the same thing. When the season changed and the beets were retired, an intriguing option called the Street Corn took its place. The Street Corn was the very best parts of amazing elote (roasted corn, chili-lime mayo, salty cheese), with the wonderful edition of grilled zucchini. I can't count the number of times I came back for that one.

But now the seasons have changed again, and with it, the appearance of the Pulled Squash. I ordered it today, and I literally opened this review after finishing the first half. Who thinks to put spaghetti squash on a sandwich? Who adds braised greens to that squash, then layers in some roasted mushrooms? Who realizes that gruyere is a wonderfully complex, but woefully underrepresented cheese, perfect for grilling? And who, in layering all of this complexity together, thinks to themselves, I think spiced pepitas would really round this out? And who, upon adding that final masterstroke, would be completely correct? 

The Goodwich. And seriously, it's that good."}
{"text":"I haven't found a better sandwich in Vegas than this tiny spot on the north end of the strip. It's across from the O.G. (i know, i know... you have NO idea what/where that is guys! *wink*,*wink*) and this spot is basically a food truck, sans the wheels. 

I have only been once, so i haven't got much of a chance to experience the menu - but the patty melt (+ an egg) which i got was delicious. You can chose your bread - opted for the rye, which was a great combo... What can i say - good tasting quality beef, melted cheeziness which didn't overpower the sandwich, and topped off with a fried egg. It was fantastic. 

Look forward to trying out more on the menu, although it will be hard to stray from getting what I already know to be great, but i guess that's a good problem to have."}
{"text":"After all the YT drama about this place, and all the hype, I was so happy to finally come here. It didn't disappoint. I really enjoyed it.
It's this little box on the corner. Is it a food truck? Is it a tiny building? I dont know and I dont care.
I got the falafel and it was soooo delicious. I really enjoyed the kale slaw on the sammich. Can you say yum? I also got a side of the pickled beets. They were good, but not amazing.
I tried the fluffernutter and that was so delicious, however, I couldn't and wouldn't eat that alone. It's nice to have a few bites after you've finished your sandwich.
They have crazy late hours, til 1 am, so showing up at 10:30 wasn't a problem. They make the sandwich fresh and quick. We had 5 sandwiches and 2 fluffernutter sandwich and it didn't take too long. You can watch them make the sandwiches too.
My favorite part, the location. Lots of crazies in this area, so 10:30 on a Friday night, it was RIPE for that! Man screaming he's chasing me and a man walking very slowly following him. Turns out first dude stole from 7-11 and it was a 7-11 dude \"chasing\" him. Dont you have to move fast to chase? Anyway, I will definitely come back. Preferably, late at night!"}
{"text":"I was at the Millennium Fandom Bar and I saw someone there eating a delicious looking sandwich. I asked where she got it, and she said The Goodwich is just right next door and if you order online, they deliver to the bar for free. How cool is that?

I ended up going to pick up my order though because I wanted to check out the place. I had a Classic Sandwich on white bread with bacon and cheddar cheese, it hit the spot. They have so many other delicious looking sandwiches, I'll need to try them. The prices are really reasonable, too."}
{"text":"The best sandwiches in the city? It might be too early to give them the title since I've only been once. But, if their other items are as good as the Le Pig ($9) it's only a matter of time before they're on top. I was worried if one sandwich would fill me up but it was packed with savory pork, fontina cheese, rocket (which is similar to arugula), and chip bites for added texture and crunch.

As others have mentioned, this business was created by guys who used to work on the Strip at places like Aureole and Prime. They use the kitchen in Dino's next door to do most of the prep work and create just about everything from scratch except the bread and some cheeses. They even make their own peanut butter! Quality eats at cheap prices. I'm sure its only a matter of time before the get too big for their kiosk and end up in their own brick and mortar spot just like Viva Las Arepas."}
{"text":"In Las Vegas you have a lot of food choices.  Anything from Asian to European to Hawaiian to Latin and everything in between. Among all of these places in Vegas there is a little gem that I happened to stumble upon one day, The Goodwich. I have always been a fan of sandwiches and never mind paying top dollar for something that is good. I saw their prices and assumed a cheaply thrown together sandwich that I'd more than likely be disappointed with. Boy was I suprised. The sandwich I received (the ham sandwich) ended up being one of the most delicious things I've tasted since moving here. It is a perfectly stacked tower of deliciousness. They aren't little either. It is a good sized sandwich for a killer price. Personally of they raised their prices I would still come and indulge on a regular basis. I patronize this establishment at least a couple of times a week and will continue to do so regularly.  I have been trying other sandwiches and have come to the conclusion that these guys have that thing vegas has been missing. The Goodwich is a must while in Vegas for visitors and should be your regular spot as a local. I promise you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a healthy lunch after a soccer tournament and couldn't have chosen better. All of the sandwiches were excellent. The Cobb salad was great as well. Enough variety in the menu but small enough to do everything with perfection. Will be back next tournament!"}
{"text":"I tried a few of their homemade potato chips.  They were very tasty.  I had the patty melt and added bacon and an au poirve sauce.  I had the sandwich on marble rye   Bread because you have your options of bread.  The bread was nice and grilled so it was crispy.  The patty melt had a lot of different flavors and was very tasty.  Putting the au poirve sauce on actually made the sandwich very messy so I won't put it on a patty melt in the future.  I did see several other sandwiches that would go very well with the sauce. The employees were very congenial and answered any questions we had.  I will be back"}
{"text":"Small little place off the strip but their sandwiches are pack with lots of flavor. Place has no AC, but heard they will move to a new location soon with indoor seating. Got  the Le Pig & BTLG. Le Pig was delicious with just the perfect amount of flavor. BTLG was good but I felt  it lack  a little sweetness."}
{"text":"So I tried it and over all was very good! I tried the Ham&  special !  The ham is very good and thy way they prepare it makes for a wonderful grilled sandwich.  Must admit was not a huge fan of the mayo as it was a bit sweet, but none the less it brought the sandwich together. Overall a tasty sandwich that I would have again.    Service on the other hand was great.  Guy came around and too my order and even offered to bring it to my car simon didn't have to stand and wait which made it for me at least that much better. I look forward to returning to try some of the other items."}
{"text":"Earl and I finally got to try the Goodwich, and it didn't disappoint!  

Earl and I shared Le Pig and Foie Gras sandwich, with the picked beets, a can of Faygo Root Beer and a bottle of Squirt.  This was cheat day for us!

The Le Pig was super flavorful.  I liked the chicharone for the crunch.  The tanginess of the lime and pickled radish balances the richness of the pork.

The Foie was good, but next time, we may have to add extra crispy chicken in this sandwich because it is somewhat lost because the Foie gras pate overpowered it.  Because this was our first time eating here, we just ordered it as-is.

I finished my half of the Le Pig and over half of the Foie and I was stuffed.  Earl was excited to finish the rest.  My favorite was Le Pig, and Earl was Foie.  We didn't have room to try Fluff & Nutt, but we will definitely come back for more!

There were about 6 chairs and two stools there.  The owners were super friendly and nice.  Cheat meal well spent."}
{"text":"Sandwich places are not always my go to joints as the thought of processed meats and thick possibly stale bread doesn't necessarily draw me in. But when you're with a crowd, you may have no choice. Well, who would have thunk that two Las Vegas chefs would want to draw a bead on the humble sandwich and turn them into works of art!?! You can get a three course meal and dessert in the delicious selections they have. Wow!!"}
{"text":"Came during happy hour 4-6pm, $2 off all sandwiches. The bread is unique, crisp, and every sandwich has a slight twist. The Rueben-ish has great flavor, phenomenal sauce. Also tried the fish-o, and that was also good. Portion size is reasonable."}

Last time I had Goodwich, it was still a tiny stall in a parking lot, cranking out some of the best sandwiches I have ever had. Two year later, it's now a full sit down restaurant with a much larger menu, but the same deliciousness and friendly service.

While memories of the original Reuben (still around), Le Pig, and the Foie Gras sandwiches still dancing through my head, the new menu had plenty of great options. One of those choices is the Pig of the Week, the 808 sandwich, paying homage to Hawaii. Mission accomplished!

The 808 is one of the tastiest sandwiches I have ever experienced. It starts with that great thick cut white bread toasted to perfection. Then, once the flavors hits your mouth, you will immediately sense the hint of heat from the shishito peppers and the sweetness from the eel sauce.  As you chew, the richness and tenderness of the pork shines through, along with that fluffy omelette. Oh how I wish Goodwich was in NYC AND NOT las Vegas.

I also had a Tomato Soup with Green Coconut Curry. It was absolutely outstanding. Creamy and zesty, combined with the earthy sweetness from the curry, made this soup an excellent complement to my sandwich. Unfortunately, my stomach could not do more, as they offer many more mouth watering selections. Btw, one of their coolest feature is the ability to add many different accompaniments (example: egg, chicharron, chicken skin, avocado, etc.) to any sandwich. Talk about overkill. Lol.

Las Vegas has grown so much over the years, and the quality of food is no exception. This restaurant is certainly a welcome addition to the ever changing cuisine landscape of this fun city. Until next time, I will have to live with trying to duplicate the 808 in my own kitchen."}
{"text":"I went to the Goodwich yesterday with a friend followed by gelato across the street. The sandwich was so good I came back today to expose my wife to the Goodness! The owner comes out to greet each customer and explains anything you may have a question about. Very friendly we talked for until the food was ready about anything and everything. As for the wichS' I had the following and with each one you have the choice of bread and can't make it monticristo style.

 Falafel( on wheat)-chickpea purée with cucumber and a kale slaw. The chickpea purée was nice and moist. Unlike some Greek places that deep fry them and dry them out. The kale slaw was creamy and the cucumbers added a crispness to the sandwich. 

 Reuben-ish(rye) - corned beef, Swiss cheese, fennel kraut and 1000 island dressing. Another success! Perfectly grilled and plenty of corned beef. Just the right amount of kraut and dressing to balance everything.

Fluff & Nutt ( white monticristo style) Nutella, toasted marshmallow and crunch. This is definitely food porn material. The bread had a French toast consistency, super moist. Them the innards, the Nutella sells itself. You can't go wrong with Nutella! Marshmallow and crunch, oh hell ya. Is it captain crunch? You'll have to go get one and find out. 

Another successful eatery in this little stand. They have the food and service to be very successful and I will definitely be a regular!"}
{"text":"Holy cow!! Had a late lunch on a bit of a whim today and I was so pleased. We took the cashiers suggestions for the \"reuben-ish\"  and the \"patty\"  and they were so good. Their unique twists on old favorites are definitely worth a try. I will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Place had a great vibe, sandwich was delicious but lacking in size even with the extra meat. Their pie was amazing."}
{"text":"One of the latest joints getting major Yelp buzz is The Goodwich. Not just any ordinary sandwich shop, but a DAMN GOOD sandwich shop! Jake and Josh know their s@#t
when it comes to food and it shows that they worked with the best. I like the fact that they use the simplest ingredients, prepare it the best way possible and stack them up right to give you a tasty BOMBASTIC bite!

Ranging from $3-$9, these sandwiches are totally worth it, and since you should be able to read the menu items and descriptions while looking at the pictures and other reviews, I'll just go over what we killed:

Egg-a great, comforting breakfast sandwich with crispy bacon and gooey cheddar...can't go wrong there!

Foie-anything foie IMO is bomb, and the combo of onion jam, cabbage, almonds, and CRISPY CHICKEN SKIN slathered with unctuous foie mousse will make any foie lover's opu(stomach) cry with tears of joy like a bee-otch!!!

Fluff-Nutt-S'mores who??? yeah, just what I thought...step aside, you've just been dethroned....

Great addition to the area with Art of Flavors just a few feet away. Nothing but continued success for Team Goodwich, and I'll keep my fingers crossed for the day they'll be able to move into that Donut shop right next to OG....ALOHA!!!

{"text":"Been here a few times. Every time I come in The people greet me and make me feel welcomed. Will is awesome. This place is great and the food is dope too. Highly recommend The Patty sammich. Super good."}
{"text":"Boy do I love me a good sammich! 
If your a sandwich lover you must try Goodwich!
This place definitely delivers at their craft, I try to treat myself to the 'Reubenish' when I really want to indulge. The menu is very different but definitely has something for everyone. My only knock is the sides for the sandwiches, tried the corn and was not very pleased and pickles were decent. However, I'll go back for that Reuben no doubt! Best in town. 
Parking can be a hassle due to it being downtown but worth the trip."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff, who were very informative and eager to help. I only gave it 4 stars because I really like more sides with my sandwiches, and sauces, I also am veg so would prefer more veggie options. With that said, the falafel sandwich was AMAZING! Probably one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I had the Sloppy Tom and it was delicious.  The serving size looked small, but it definitely filled me up. It was easy to park, which is hard to say for DTLV and the staff was awesome."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from wife so we popped in since we were in the area. Loved the industrial atmosphere of the place and how you can see everything that's going on in the kitchen. The staff was very friendly and the food was superb. They have a good selection on the menu with add-ons so you can customize your order. If you are ever near downtown, you should definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Great unique sandwich shoppe.  Had the Street Corn sandwich with fried cheese chicken.  Nice amount of mild spice.   Also had some bread and butter pickles which also had a good amount of spice.  And if you like food, you know spice is different than heat!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"First off, let me say that the service here is great cuz you talk directly to the owners (chefs) of Goodwich and they like to get compliments and/or dislikes into factor for their food. 

Foie sandwich - supa dupa rich.. I normally love foie (love it warm and buttery) but, I think it's a mind (fvck) thing here because the Foie is a patty/paste. Once I keep thinking about the texture, I couldn't stomach any more of it. 

Chicken skin - roomies absolutely loved it! It's chicken skin; what's not to love! I, on the other hand, couldn't eat more than 2 as it seemed too fattie for me. 

Le pig - It was too salty for my liking. 

Overall, my experience was good but, I think I just need to order something(s) else. Maybe something NOT salty."}
{"text":"All kinds of good stuff here from soups, salads, sandwiches. Innovative menu, nice people."}
{"text":"My man and I craving a good sandwich after a night of casino hoping. Yelped this really good find. We both had the turkey with chips and added the tomato soup. The restaurant was really cute and cozy. Felt like we were on a date lol. I think all together the total was around $30. Not bad because its not your average deli type sandwich, its super gourmet. The chefs were so nice and friendly. We are definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I first heard of the Goodwich at a beer tasting downtown.  They had a booth set up that was serving an awesome turkey and cream cheese sandwich with buffalo sauce.  I found their booth in the lot outside Dinos and was disappointed to find that sandwich wasn't on their regular menu. I went for a late dinner last night and this was my first visit to the new location inside Soho lofts on the ground floor.  Parking on the street was no problem but I can imagine it being at a premium on weekdays.  The open high ceiling and open kitchen give it a welcoming and spacious feel even though there are only 4 or 5 tables inside.  

I ordered the bratty, made with awesome bratwurst made by local Polish food artisan Jerry from Kings Sausage (another local spot you must check out) and it was amazing.  The bread was perfectly toasted, the cheese and meat in the sandwich melted together perfectly to create an awesome texture and flavor.

My friend ordered the Patty, which is a flavorful take on a patty melt.  Pepper jack cheese and ground beef.  I had a bite and it was just as good as my bratty.  She is a big fan of beets.  As a result of course we had to try the pickled beets which were amazing as well.  They had just a bit of tanginess but not as strong as some of the store bought jars of beets.  We also tried the bread and butter pickles which were pretty tasty as well.

Overall I think this place is going to be a fairly regular stop for me.  I would love it even more if they added their special buffalo turkey and cream cheese sandwich to the regular menu, but the rest of the menu is quite good."}
{"text":"All you need to know about Goodwich is their sandwiches are DELICIOUS. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. They definitely have something for everyone, the meat eaters and the veggies too. Looking to satisfy your sweet tooth? They have that too! Their ingredients are top notch, the chefs take super special care making each and every sandwich, the bread is perfectly toasted. You may think one little sandwich won't be filling but it is. Surprisingly so!  My favorite sandwich changes each time I go. First I loved the Le Pig, but then I had the Falafal, then I tried the Chicken Club and wasn't going to stray, but then I tried the delicious Patty. Who knows what my favorite will be on my next visit? 

Jake and Josh have created something unique and yummy for downtown. Plus, they are good guys who want to engage with their customers. We have always had an enjoyable experience.

And did I mention...YUM?"}
{"text":"The Goodwich is not to be missed by the traveling foodie or local. A hidden gem of tastiness tucked into a trailer next to Dino's bar on the edge of the Arts District. The egg sandwich cannot be beat for value, and a much better start to the day than any other breakfast option around (well, except Tiffany's Cafe). The Ham and Cheese is a sweet and savory experience that keeps me coming back. HFCF free sweet-tooth options with Izze's and Mexi-Cokes. 
Top notch, know my name,  personalized service from a dedicated crew of sandwich craftsmen on every visit."}
{"text":"Soo good it's a must try. We ordered 4 sandwiches and they were all divine and unique. You will be addicted trust me try this place."}
{"text":"Stopped here with a friend to see if it warranted all the love. It does. In spades. 

i wonder if the people who found the location to be scary or less than desirable ever leave their houses. It's not a resort location, but neither is it dangerous. If you feel like you're going to be accosted here, check your meds. We can get you a nice cheese sandwich and the latest issue of Oprah magazine to read poolside at the Wynn. More Goodwich for me. 

     That being said, the Sea Smoke was, simply put, one of the best sandwiches I've ever jammed into my gaping maw. The texture, between the crunch of the texas toasted/grilled  rye and crackle of the crumbled chips and the ever so satisfying yield  of the mildly intoxicating smoked white fish, was THE most perfect balance of texture I've ever experienced in a sandwich. And that's just the freakin' texture! 
      
     I'm, admittedly, a smoked fish freak. If you put your Winston Light out in a can of Chicken Of The Sea, I'd probably pay you to eat the remains. Yeah, I know, gross. But there's your perspective. 

     If I had to fathom a guess, I'd say they were smoking their own here. It was fairly mild, as far as smoked fish goes, but fit in magnificently with the acid of the  \"ES Soss\" and greens and saltiness of the chips. It just went so GD well together. 
      The service was fine. The people who worked there were friendly and accommodating and seemed genuinely interested in our satisfaction with the place. 
   The ambiance was....well, shit.......we ate in the parking lot. But you know that going in, so whatever.   No complaints here. There's a couple chairs around the little sandwich hut, which suited me fine. 
     All in all, what they lack in amenities they make up for X10 in product. If you like food and you're not a weenie, check it out."}
{"text":"So tasty! And their new location is the raddest! I especially admire the hand-painted mural of vintage Vegas neon inside. The openness of the kitchen & prep areas was also pretty neat. I loved watching them assemble my Hawkeye sandwich, which turned out absolutely perfect. They've expanded their menu a bit, but the classics are still just as yummy. If you haven't already tried the Goodwich, I highly recommend you take a walk downtown & try it!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of corned beef and started to say no, but this was actually a quite good lunch sandwich. I split my lunch as I don't eat that much and it is nice to not see a HUGE sandwich that most of it is just wasted. 

It may be just a very basic sandwich but it was done right and all of the simple things were done correctly."}
{"text":"Well, I thoroughly enjoyed this place.  It's a little snack shack in the Dino's parking lot.  It's where Viva Arepas used to be before they moved into a shop down the street.  Your scenery is the OG across the street and the black asphalt of the parking lot, but sitting on the corner of LV Blvd and Wyoming at no thang when you're grubbing on delicious sandwiches.  You might also witness an almost-car accident like we did, which was exciting.

First off, the guy who is running things at this place is super handsome and charming and friendly.  He chatted with my husband and I as we waited for our food and told us the story of how he and his friend came up with this idea and how they make everything in the kitchen behind Dinos.  He is so nice and earnest, that I just want to hug him.

Fortunately, the food speaks for itself and is a testament to their vision.  My husand got the Patty ($7), and it was a delightfully greasy, gooey, slightly spicy treat.  I got the Ham &.... which had mostarda on it to make it slightly sweet along with a cheddar cheese (I think it was cheddar...doesn't matter what it was, it was good).  It was grilled and flavorful.  And it was only $5.  Yup, $5.

We wanted to try the pickles, but they were sold out after a successful and busy Saturday.  They're new, so still trying to work out their supply and demand, so hopefully I can try those the next time I go.  Which I will.  Multiple times.  Because I want to try the Falafel and the PBBJ and the Le Pig and everything else on there."}
{"text":"Sandwiches simply don't get better than this. If you're in the mood for a hot, homemade-style sandwich, and you're tired of Capriotti's, come down to this little stand off of Main. It's in the parking lot of Dino's, which is great if you want some drinks with local flavor and get hungry afterwards.

The sandwiches are made on excellent bread, and are layered with meats and cheeses and thrown on the griddle. I don't know what kind of sorcery happens inside that little shack, but out comes these perfect sandwiches made of pure magic. I'll post a pic of the patty melt; my descriptions can't do it justice.

When friends and family come out to visit, we take them here for an excellent example of local foodie culture. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I never write reviews on Yelp, but this place was so good that I had to write a review. We were looking for an open Port of Subs at 9pm on a Sunday. With no luck, we ran into this place and were not at all disappointed. We got a Reuban-ish and The Patty and split them. Best accidental date ever. Best Reuban I've ever tasted and the Patty had smoked cream cheese on it. Pretty decent prices and friendly, helpful staff too. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with some classmates.  I got the Ham& sandwhich and a slice of blueberry peach pie.  The sandwhich and pie was great, but I felt it was a little pricy. My classmates got the Ruebenish and the Patty. They said the food was good and we all agreed we would come back again."}
{"text":"Sorry people, this place is ok but that's about it. Service was really nice.It's almost like a cult following, when the food isn't all that great!

We came one morning to get breakfast only to be told that the Foie Gras sandwich and the nutella sandwich are both no longer on the menu, which was really disappointing. So we just ordered 2 other breakfast sandwiches on the menu. It was really hot even at 9am and of course you sit outside and just sweating in the heat, super uncomfortable. The food came out pretty fast, but they just didn't taste all that great. They are very greasy which is ok, but all the grease just made me felt horrible and drowsy the entire day. The bread they use is just normal grocery store bread and the sandwiches tastes like something I have made at home, so really nothing impressive. 

The staff were really nice, and the prices are very good, but I don't think I'll be returning as this place seems like a total hype!"}
{"text":"Just looking for something off the strip and stumbled onto a gold mine!  Don't pass this place up.  Full tummy!"}
{"text":"soooo ...I've revisited the goodwich i figured that after having a bad customer service maybe the management learns from the experience ..... because customers are the most important aspect of your operation...no customers.... no goodwich...no jobs for those employed by goodwich!!!! it was late on a friday night i live close and the egg sandwiches are pretty dam good.... my stomach wins in my struggle to revisit this shop downtown...same night manager same crappy service.... i order and pay for my sandwiches and the guy says \" i shouldn't have taken your order unless you extract your yelp review\".....he also comes at me with this \" what you think the owners were gonna back you up \" ... the eeeffing nerve of this dude so i ask for my refund and pledge to neverrrrrr step foot in this place again!!!!! im gonna say this because i feel its true at this point .....i feel the night manager is a racist I'm a mexican american guy and its either he's not very patient with people or he just doesn't like my kind!!!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome!! My husband who is a chef finally took me here and it was absolutely amazing! I strongly recommend this place if you are in the downtown area and looking for a creative take on sandwiches!"}
{"text":"The Goodwich where have you been all these years?! When I decided to visit this place with my sister, a fellow Yelper. We decided on The Goodwich based on tons of awesome reviews and word of mouth. From the moment we walked in to the very end of our lunch was simply amazing. The staff here is very friendly and worked great as a team. I do like the open kitchen with a semi-industrial look and the use of space works well for Goodwich. The option of an open patio for al fresco dinning is a plus especially whenever we have nice weather like yesterday.

On to the food, I ordered the Patty with a fried egg. From the first bite of my sandwich to end was satisfying. Each ingredient was well balanced and the ground beef was cook just right with a good amount of spices. The white bread was a perfect consistency without being dried out, too soft or soggy. My sister got the Chive Turkey and was really pleased with her order. She like the consistency and the turkey was not dried out like most places. 

We got a chance to try their Fluff 'N Nut dessert sandwich. This particular item was really good and it was on point in capturing our palate. It was like a classic take on a grownup S'more with an European flair because of the Nutella. I highly recommend everyone to try this dessert out.

Awesome customer service and delicious food in the Arts district of Downtown. This will be on my favorite spot to drop by whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"BOMB City!! Simple explanation.. If you haven't gone, you must go! Chef genius! Love the falafel sandwich!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend this place. The sandwiches are AMAZING! The service and prices are great! You will not be disappointed when you eat here."}
{"text":"As always downright amazing sandwiches.  

Having owned sandwich places before and my love for the creativity in their menu and ingredients without being so over the top that it takes away from actual true heart of the sandwich 

Cheers guys and thank you"}
{"text":"My first visit to The Goodwich in years, as well as their trendy new location a bit north of where they first made a name for themselves.

Nice to know certain things in Vegas never change:

The odds are always against you, the hookers always wear dresses at least 1-2 sizes too small, and The Goodwich makes the most ridiculously good sandwiches in the city.

Oh, how I've missed The Goodwich.

I've always ordered one sandwich for now and one for later because I cannot decide on just one of their menu items.

Today it was their crispy chicken sandwich and the PBB&J with chip bits.

Every bite of each was magnificent.

Anyone else think this is the most perfectly prepared sandwich too? Right down to the tight wax paper wrapped around it and The Goodwich tape/sticker to keep it that way?

Thanks to Paul for the conversation and the recommendations. I still claim dibs on franchise co-ownership in Tampa...let's make it happen, guys."}
{"text":"Great selections. Full of flavor. Ordered the falafel topped with carrots, kale, dressing on wheat and slightly toasted. Finally someone has nailed a specialty concept... Meaning, if you only sell a particular item please perfect and test. Learn from the goodwhich."}
{"text":"I am a regular.  As regular of a regular as one can actually be.  These guys make the best sandwiches in town.  The product is fine dining quality in sandwich form.  For foodies like myself, this is the ultimate sandwich experience and I am loyal to the Goodwich!!!"}
{"text":"It pains me to give a business such as this 4 stars, but in all honestly I think it's what they deserve. I really wanted to give them the red treatment but their sandwiches are a solid 4 stars. 4 stars is not bad, but I usually like to give 5 stars when the food is absolutely mind blowing. I've been here a total of 3 times so far, and I've gotten the chicken twice and le pig once. For some reason the first time I try something that is good with a unique twist such as their chicken sandwich it was practically mind blowing, but today when I had it, it was good just not amazeballs status. The chicken sandwich consist of chicken, greens, and pesto. For some reason the chicken today was a bit greaser than usual, trust me I am not one to complain about a little extra grease because it does add extra flavor with a side of guilt however today there was a little puddle of grease on the paper that holds the sandwich together. But I must give them credit for the bread they use, I am not really a ran of rye bread but theirs is really good and I love the marble effect on it(refer to my picture). I've also tried Le pig and thought it was a bit fatty for my liking. I had a bite of my friend's ham and that was really good from what I can remember and it's on the $5 menu. I also like the fact they are near the intersection of Oakey and Las Vegas Blvd., although the area is sketchy it certainly does have character to it, which I think matches urbanized vibe they are going for. Trust me although I didn't get them 5 stars, I certainly will be back for the ham and encourage others to try them out. Who knows, maybe my next experience I'll be so impressed to bump them up a star."}
{"text":"There aren't too many reasons to wander north of the Stratosphere. Thus far I've only found a couple: Viva Las Arepas and Art of Flavors. You can now add The Goodwich to that small list. Like many of the businesses in this area, The Goodwich is a hole-in-the-wall. It is literally a small sandwich stand and nothing else. But, damn, they do sandwiches good! The menu features 12 different sandwiches grouped into triplets by price ($3, $5, $7, or $9). 

I liked the variety of sandwich types. The most popular on the list were the patty and the reuben-ish. I'm always a sucker for grilled cheese sandwiches, but I ended up ordering the patty on rye bread. The patty was somewhat reminiscent of a cheesesteak sandwich, but even better. The bread was perfectly buttered and toasted and even after half an hour, the sandwich stayed toasted and hot. The ground beef with smoked cream cheese was heavenly. It seemed so basic, but all the flavors were on point. After eating here, I can't bring myself to eating sandwiches anywhere else in town. I can't wait to return to try some of the other offerings including the el pig and chicken."}
{"text":"So freaking good. Will was a great help and explained the menu when we walked up. Our crew ordered sandwiches then went over to Dino's to pick up some cold beers to go with our sandwiches. Will brought us our food and it was divine. Definitely worth checking this spot out."}
{"text":"Authentic urban dining experience! Stellar. Fast, friendly service and good conversation if you can catch 'em when they're not too busy. Menu changes regularly to showcase their talents but the chicken and the falafel are must-trys. Don't let the location fool you. These guys are talented and professional."}
{"text":"Located in downtown Las Vegas, The Goodwich was a perfect end to my time in Las Vegas. Normally, I am not much of a sandwich person, but Goodwich had a bunch of interesting combinations that I wanted to try. The Summa Cheese, served warm, was excellent and surprisingly light with prosciutto, burrata cheese, fresh mint and fruit chutney. Overall, it had really good flavor and was a bit sweet due to the chutney; I would definitely get it again. The service was friendly and accommodating although a bit slow to serve.

The toasted marble Rye was thick and soft in the middle, just as it should be. The fresh curry chips were really good too."}
{"text":"Had kind of a weird experience at the Goodwich.  I was really excited to return to town to try this, so I made it a point to stop by.  Walked up and asked the guy working for a recommendation.  He asked what I liked, and I said everything.  He works there, he should be able to recommend a sandwich.  Apparently that was tough for him, as he said \"they're all good.\"  I believe it, but I believe when a customer asks for a recommendation, you can list your 1 or 2 favorites.

I mentioned some sandwiches Yelp users mentioned, and he asked with a smirk if I was looking at Yelp.  I told him I was.  He said those sandwiches are from the old menu and it's a different menu now.  Fair enough, but not sure why the guy has ill feelings towards Yelp when that's what brought me in in the first place!

All that said, I finally ended up getting the Pulled Squash.  Very out of the ordinary for me, and I was happy to try something unique.  It was amazingly good, and if I didn't know any better I would have said there was meat on this sandwich.  I'd love to go back and try other sandwiches, but I was kind of rubbed the wrong way by the guy working.

Oh, and I'm pretty sure the guy was the owner. :/"}
{"text":"Awesome little whole in the wall place off the strip. Drove by it twice and didn't see it!  I'm sure when there's people eating outside you'll find it easier. 

We had the Patty on Rye and Cob-bish salad. Both are unique and very pleasing to the taste.  Very good combo of ingredients to make the unique taste.

Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a unique flavor to an ordinary food."}
{"text":"I've been hearing good things about The Goodwich so I didn't know what to expect. The yelp reviews and pics seemed pretty standard (ie: like mine) but still had a certain appeal of \"not just another sandwich.\" I decided to just wing it and pick something out when I got there. First thing I noticed was the soup special written in chalk \"smoked cauliflower brisket stew.\" Sold. Now I gotta pick a sandwich, and the \"Patty\" was suggested. 

Remember when u were growing up and made random sandwiches with whatever ingredients u had in the fridge and there was like 3 out of 100 of those sandwiches that were just magical but u could never figure out how to replicate that magic no matter how hard u tried... well that's the Patty. Ground beef, smoked cream cheese, onion, & pepperjack (I chose white bread, basically cuz I hate bread but I gotta choose one). The beef is seasoned perfectly, and with the mix of the melted cheeses and onion, every bite is better than the last. 

The only thing that could've made the soup better would be a scoop of rice, but I'm not complaining because it was ultra satisfying, hearty but not too thick. Nice chunks of brisket and a good dose of cauliflower to balance the texture.

This is my new go-to spot for the good eats!"}

I find myself unnecessarily distraught with the fact that I have not yet comprehensively eaten my way through the Goodwich's menu.

Every sandwich. Many, multiple times. 

If you don't at least try the Goodwich, with their superb service, and creative menu; then, there may be something wrong with you. Do you even yelp, bro?

Yes, it is a shack. 
Yes, it is downtown. 
Yes you might be a gigantic pusillanimous yuppie if you find it dangerous here.

If you have a particular problem with eating what might be the best sandwiches from a shack downtown, then I am sure there is a Subway somewhere within driving distance you can go to. There are probably several in Summerlin or Anthem, where you belong. Adios ....

{"text":"Just tried the Reuben-ish sandwich and liked it even more than the Le Pig. Although the Le Pig is also a great sandwich. So good this place! Love how great food places like this one are revitalizing this area."}
{"text":"Very good &  good for you options. Of course, I went with the \" Cold Brown\" which is sliced turkey breast with bacon gruyere;  they recommended I have it on the marble rye. Toasted superbly,; not greasy too moist. Turkey with chopped sun-driedq tomatoes was a nice combo. Clean industrial decor delivered in a no frills manner. I would definitely recommend and I hope they franchise this site. Gold mine waiting to be discovered."}
{"text":"SOOOO GOOD! 
I went here last night looking for a place to eat downtown that wasn't closed. After going to two different places that were closed, we found this gem on Yelp. It was 30 mins to close so it was pretty empty, but not cause the food wasn't poppin'. I got the Rueben-Ish, which was around $10, second most expensive. The most expensive sandwich here is $11 and the rest are about $7-8. They do offer combos or separate sides like the pickles. They were super welcoming and asked if we needed anything. Everyone working was super friendly and had great customer service. They even brought our food to the table! Awesome customer service and great food, i'll definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Wow wow wee wow. This place is fire. The heat of the desert pales in comparison to what I just put in my mouth. We just made sweet sweet love to a sexy sandwich and I don't even know what to say besides come here spend your money get laid and dance cuz that's the kind of place this sandwich shop is"}

{"text":"After seeing the good reviews for Goodwich and having friends recommend it, I had to stop by and I made plans to do so on Wednesday.

It was a little after noon but there was little wait.  My order was taken and I had a seat in the shade of the front of the stand while waiting.  During that time, it was interesting to see tourists and locals walk by on the Boulevard.  Quite a cross section of humanity going by.

The sandwich came and it was packed nicely in a bag.  It was wrapped in paper and sealed with one of their logo stickers.  The sandwich, the foie, was very good.  It was filled with ingredients.  There's no scrimping here.  The crispy chicken skin and the almond were a nice touch for texture.  I had the sandwich Monte Cristo style and it was nicely grilled.  I also had a diet soda to go with the sandwich.

This is a good place to stop but I'm not a fan of sitting nearly on the sidewalk or in my car.  Hopefully, the guys will be able to get a real shop (if that's their goal).  In that case, I would be more likely to make follow up visits.  This isn't close to my house nor am I in this area that often unless planned.  I'm not sure I'd make the effort to try another sandwich here."}
{"text":"Splendid food. And great service.  I am so happy I found this downtown gem. 
I can't tell you how happy I am about the PBB&J (peanut butter, jam, and bacon). I had this all the time at a dive restaurant in town but it was so smokey I hated going there. So I'm thrilled that they serve it and it's even better. Loved every thing I've tried there. Even the coffee."}
{"text":"The menu and pricing was very straightforward. The boys are definitely proud and hopeful for their lil hut of sandwich joy. Personally had le pig on rye and a mexican coke. Their passion for what they do is clear, taking care to pay attention to their product and quality. Personally speaking the portion was just right, grilled up tastily and satisfied my taste buds without going overboard. I got the sandwich texture and flavours I craved in a homemade high quality sort of way. Will I return? Heck yes, why should I bother with fastfood when I have fabulous options such as this?"}
{"text":"On our way home from camping, we stopped here to eat. It was a lazy Sunday in there. But boy, our sandwiches were full of life...in my mouth! So good! And the guys were so nice there.

{"text":"Best sandwich in Vegas! We went here after the neon Sign Museum down the street and couldn't have been more happy with this random awesomeness sandwich shop. I got the ruebin'ish and yum yum yum. Super friendly service as well. Highly recommended for anyone who likes good food.

Also! Bonus points for having good coffee! I'm a coffee snob, was low on caffeination, and this hit the spot!"}

{"text":"Loved it. The location is seedy enough to be cool, but not so remote that it's dangerous to walk around. If the weather is nice, you can sit on a couple of chairs and stools placed around the parking lot to enjoy the view of cops, the Olympic Garden patrons, and bums.

We tried the Reuben and the ham sandwich.  Both were delicious and only five dollars each. The kids had the Nutella sandwich, which was basically dessert, but definitely delicious.

Service was super friendly, and it took less than 10 minutes for our order to come out.

I'll definitely be back to the Goodwich for lunch or a late night snack"}
{"text":"The Goodwich is another one of those popular Yelp stops that gets a ton of 5 Star Reviews.  Let me try to debunk that.  Foie, Le Pig, and Crispy Chicken Skin???  Honestly, none of this really appeals to me.  Thus, the reason why it took me so long to eat here.  I'm in the area frequently. No, not for OG's, but for AOF.  So, it was just a matter of time that I would finally get a chance at the Goodwich.  

You see the review rating.  So, that means that I'm no different than the previous Yelpers that reviewed this place.  The Goodwich is \"as good as it gets!\" when it comes to their sandwiches.  I got their Reuben-ish on wheat, which consist of corned beef, swiss, kraut, and 1000 Island type dressing.  Not quite sure what made this sandwich one of the best I've had in a while.  Not sure if it was because their bread was perfectly grilled, the corned beef & swiss smashed to a flavorful goodness, or the mix of toppings complimented my sandwich just right.  Regardless of what made my sandwich at the Goodwich a greatwich, they have convinced me that I've been missing out this whole time.  Whatever it was, it was good and I can't wait for another cheat meal here.  

PS:  Prior to eating here, I thought I'd be one of the few Yelpers that gave the Goodwich less than 5 stars.  Boy, was I wrong.  The Goodwich delivers in service, price, and in food.  5 Stars!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my office and I'm mad at myself for not trying them sooner.  I got the Patty and it was awesome...melts in your mouth. Looking forward to trying other items on the menu."}
{"text":"The only problem is that seating is outside. Unless you want to go inside Dinos bar and eat in there. Other than that heat for take out. Yet to have a bad meal at this place!"}
{"text":"The Wich is back... and thankfully because i was getting cranky waiting. 

The new location is a huge upgrade from being across the street from Olympic Garden which was not only sketchy but just not inviting in the slightest. The new spot is clean, modern, and full of tasty goodness. 

Its hard to get away from the classics like the Patty, the BLTG, and that yummy Ham sandwich. But i recently tried the Falafel and the Tomato which were good but ill be looking for something new the next time around. The Falafel was refreshing and healthy-like but the flavor would get old quick for me if i had too much of it. And the Tomato is a good \"light\" sandwich and to be expected, but am i wrong to desire something a little more in it? When i eat the Patty i feel sad to take the last bite, and that's how i know its a winner with me. Next time ill venture into a Chix-Fix or  Reuben-ish in hopes of finding another heavy weight contender. 

Who doesn't like food stuffed between two pieces of bread?! Goodwich and their combinations and fresh ingredients have always been a winner since the beginning for me. Now in a nice, clean location, an expended menu (breakfast), and even some coffee options you are now gonna get tired of seeing me way too often. 

A few things to note... 
- Im not sure why your address isn't updated on Yelp yet, but you may want to do that for people using the Yelp app and aren't aware of the new location. 
- For the love of god bring back the Corn Sandwich when the season comes around please. 
- I would cry tears of joy if you would get the bread pudding from Slo-Boy here to make my dining experience complete in once place."}
{"text":"Four and a half stars-

Pros: Avoiding the strip! Delicious sandwiches! The price is right! 

Cons: none?

We stopped here on our way out of town and were very happy with the brisk service, fresh ingredients, and  informal vibe. The place is nothing remarkable- a small counter service lunch spot with metal tables. They have their own ice tea and offer some interesting options in the way of alcoholic popsicles and \"rocket coffee\" (with butter a la Nepal?) but the real star of the show is, you guessed it, the sandwiches. 

We had their Reuben-ish and the Mrs. Prosciutto, both very delicious. The Reuben was perfectly portioned with just the right amount of finger licking gooeyness but no more. The Prosciutto (the special) was cold, crispy, with rich fig jam and brie. 

If you're in the area and need a tasty 'wich you found the place!"}
{"text":"The sandwich was a gastronomic explosion in my mouth!  

I had the le pig vert, on toasted rye, for $9, and the wife had the patty, on wheat, for $7.  The pickled carrots gave my sandwich the perfect tart taste and the smoky cream cheese perfectly complemented my wife's.   

One of the co-owners is a former five star chef at one of the strip casinos and this attention to the little details goes into every sandwich.  I was told they are constantly inventing new combinations.  

I would have given five stars, except for the location.  It isn't the best, it's a food shack in Dino's \"The last Las Vegas neighborhood bar\" parking lot.  You can eat your food inside the bar with a couple brews to get out of the Vegas heat.  Sandwiches of this magnitude deserve an actual brick and mortar building!

Be sure to get there before 2 pm because they close promptly.  When I go back I'm going to try the Pate."}
{"text":"(UPDATE 5/3/16: The Sea Smoke is fantastic. The curry-vinegar chips are fantastic. I think I died and went to sandwich heaven.)

(UPDATE 5/11/16: The Chix Fix might be the best chicken sandwich ever.)

I've waited months to say these words: the Goodwich is back!

Today was their official opening at the Soho Lofts, and their new place is indeed lofty. Their entrance actually faces Hoover Ave, which explains why I haven't noticed much when driving by on Las Vegas Blvd. Seating is indoor and limited, but still vastly preferable to the inside of your car or an open-air chair at the old shack.

Their old lot outside Dino's was always easy to park in, so parking at their new brick-and-mortar was one of my more immediate concerns. I was fortunate to find street parking (free 3+ hours most spots on the nearest segment of Hoover) at the end of their lunch rush because the next closest option is a $1/hour paid lot. The street was almost empty by the end of my meal though, and Josh is trying to work with the city to allow customers validated parking. Stay tuned.

The new menu (available on their web site) has expanded in breadth and depth. In addition to sandwiches, they offer vegetarian salads (protein additional charge), several sides, and even desserts (although only the blondie and fluff 'n nut sandwich were available today). They've also added fountain drinks (and cups for water, hooray). drip coffee with beans from Henderson favorite Mothership Coffee Roasters, and \"rocket\"proof coffee (bulletproof but presumably better). They'll also implement a pretty big breakfast menu and morning hours soon (targeted for early May).

That said, sandwiches have always been my main focus, so I keyed in on two of their new options. The Hawkeye ($8.50) comes on potato bread and includes a not-too-thin slab of crispy pork as well as several condiments. I loved the bread and condiments but found the pork to be a little dry and plain. My second choice was the Cold Brown ($8.00), a temperature-twisted take on a hot brown. While I haven't ever had the latter, I really enjoyed this rendition. It has large chunks of turkey (this ain't no deli sliced meat) and thick smoky bacon but is served cold, making it delicious fresh or as a to-go option. The Cold Brown is definitely a new favorite of mine.

The inevitable price hike was definitely overdue, so I wasn't too surprised that most of their sandwiches now cost at least $1 more. But their mainstays including the Reuben-ish, Patty, and Ham& are back, as are crowd favorites such as the Falafel and BLTG. They also have a rotating \"pig o'the week\" menu slot (Cuban-esque to start). Personally, I'm looking forward to the Sea Smoke, a slightly adjusted version of my favorite from the final menu of the shack. Josh assured me that I'll love it. Oh, and their happy hour menu (daily at 3-6pm) also looks really enticing, especially with the Pate Sliders.

By the way, did I mention that they're a real restaurant now? They've kept their ubiquitous to-go bags and wrapped sandwiches, but they have circular metal trays now for dine-in customers! More importantly, the trays still come with awesome food on top of them.

The Goodwich is definitely back and here to stay. This is the start of bigger and better things for a really awesome shop that's always had excellent sandwiches and now has even more to offer. They're likely to find even more steady clientele in their new, nicer neighborhood, but it's their consistent quality and constant innovation that will keep customers coming back."}
{"text":"The best Rueben I've had in years. This was my 1st visit but I'll definitely be back. It shares the  parking lot with Dino's on the corner of LV blvd and Wyoming. If you blink you'll miss it. Don't blink. It's worth a stop"}

{"text":"I just had the RU Chicken sandwich and the Nitro tea for lunch, and it was off the chain!! I'm going to have to bring my girls down here-they will love it! The staff is super friendly too!"}
{"text":"Have ordered and delivered to the office and had eaten sandwiches here in the past but actually checked in this time. I had the PBB&J on white. Which is a Peanut Butter Bacon and seasonal pepper jam. It really tasted great but ANYTHING IS BETTER WITH BACON !!!"}
{"text":"Fun Sandwich place. I love the falafel sandwich 
Knowledgeable, friendly staff

{"text":"Awsome sandwiches! Great way to start the day and can't wait to see these guys at the Downtown Beer Festival!"}
{"text":"This little food cart is all my fat ass needs. Ever. Allow me to explain:

IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF DINO'S. An old style, super dark, super divey bar perfectly situated in that strip of awesomeness between the Stratosphere (the north end of LV Blvd) and Downtown. It is just my business, thank you very much. I love it, and they even have Goodwich menus inside... if you're lucky enough to be able to see them.

LE PIG VERT. Just the right amount of porky goodness, not too greasy, worked perfectly with the chile verde sauce, marbled rye bread, and chicharron. Oh yeah, did I mention chicharron? Come on now.

BLT&G. Thick, crispy bacon. Deliciously supportive wheat bread. Fresh heirloom tomatoes. And what's the G stand for? Oh yeah, freaking cheddar cheese grits. Every ingredient working together in solid harmony. So awesome.

CRUNCH BAR. Holy shiznit. How come this isn't that sweet? It's absolute, delectable perfection. It's a Rice Krispy bar made with some sort of homemade marshmallow cream (because there is NO WAY the flavor comes out that well with store bought crap), topped with melted chocolate, toasted coconut, and bottomed out with a buttery homemade graham cracker crust. WOW. Worth every penny!

And the ultimate to my five-star Goodwich love? THE OUTSIDE GUY. I'm madly in love with him. Yes, of course, he totally fits my typical love of my life profile, but I really do mean it this time. Are you single, guy? I will totally come back to Vegas right now if I stand any chance with you. LOL.

He takes it to your car! He's super patient and helpful! A true gentleman, and even if you aren't into that sort of thing, at the very least he peddles amazing, unique eats :) Get thee to Goodwich!!!"}
{"text":"They now have happy hour 4-6 with 2 dollars off sandwiches! I got the El pollo cuerdo which had interesting spices. The rye bread was delicious. I also got to try the crispy capo which is kinda like eggplant parmesan."}
{"text":"This shop is great!! Small item menu but that is perfect. I went w/ some friends and was thoroughly impressed w/ the food and its presentation and taste overall. Well worth the visit if your in the area. I had the Le Pig, a pork sandwich it was delicious. Im definitely going back again."}
{"text":"Now that's what I call a yummy sandwich!! This extremely unassuming little corner spot (its literally a permanent, non-mobile food truck) packs flavor and creativity into there sammies. I ordered the Ham & which was stacked with deliciously savory thick cut ham, melted aged cheddar cheese, arugula and a mostarda spread on beautifully toasted fresh sliced white bread. Ahh, maah, gawd!! I want one right now. 

Not only was the sandwich awesome, but so were the fellas that were working during my visit. They were super friendly and helpful in explaining menu items and giving suggestions. In addition to savory sammies they also have a few sweet options as well. I'm looking forward to visiting again to try the Fluff & Nut. 

Although there isn't a whole lot of space to sit down and enjoy their delicious food, there are several alternatives that make up for it. If you are into dive bars you are welcome to visit Dino's right behind Goodwich to enjoy a beer and eat your meal. The Goodwich staff will even drop off your order at the bar when its ready. They also have the option to text in your order for an easy pick up and go option. If your in the area or not (I traveled from Henderson specifically to try them out) you've gotta stop by and see what all the rave reviews are about!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Now there's a sit-down indoor place, they have curry salt and vinegar chips which were delicious, and I was super bummed out initially that they had discontinued the pork sandwich.

They let me know that it was their first day they were selling their new version-- el Escobar. 

I read the description. Apples, yucca chips, and pork and sat there and wondered whether I was making the right choice. 

Bejeeeeeesus. This sandwich is OFF THE HOOOOOOOOOK. The bread is toasted to perfection, and the apple was not the raw stuff I was envisioning...its poached or cooked or whatever they did to it, it's the soft kind they put in apple pies. I'm not a huge fan of yucca, but all the flavors complemented each other perfectly. 

I needed some serious caffeine and wanted iced coffee, and they offered a cold brew (which is not on the menu). It's a hefty $5, and I was a bit shocked, but, in desperate times I wasn't gonna back out and cheap it. 

I was blown away by the party in my mouth when I was done. Super stuffed, too. I can't wait to go back and get me more of that el Escobar. Am I butchering the name already? I sawwwyyyyyy."}
{"text":"Adorable sandwich shop! Cool artistic vibe on the decor! Service stellar! The food is scratch made fresh perfection! O...M...G! 
My favorite so far is their version of the Reuben and their house made pickles and chips! They \"get it!\"  It really doesn't get any better. Yummm!"}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich place in Vegas!

The gentleman who took my order was extremely friendly and helped me and my friend choose sandwiches. Since there is no seating he recommended that we grab a beer from the bar across the parking lot. He even brought the sandwiches to us over in the bar!

I had the Le Pig sandwich, it was pork belly. It was fantastic. Small chunks of pork with cheese on butter grilled wheat, with some condiments and some fancy veggies (, I didn't pay much attention to the ingredients). All I know is that it was fantastic. Spent 11 bucks for a sandwich and chips."}
{"text":"Superior ingredients, great sandwich choices on excellent breads, friendly service, reasonable prices, cash or credit or debit and terrific pickles.  

What more can one ask for?"}
{"text":"good sammich: $9 I thought was pricey, but the ingredients match up just fine.  I ordered the Reuben with mayostard instead of 1000isl (food allergy), mexican Cola and water - $12 for dinner.   
 Short prep time, savory flavors abounded. 
 Finished with Art Of Flavors Gelato.  good evening for less than $20."}
{"text":"Hold on while I wipe my drool real quick. That's just my body's natural response when I think about Goodwich. Good is an understatement. They're really AMAZINGwich. Jk.

Thank you to my local friends, Ellen H. and Hugo M., for introducing me to this spot in Las Vegas. As a tourist, you would never think about venturing off anywhere away from the strip for food. Trust me, it's worth it. Even with a Lyft, it was around $6 from the strip to here.

Originally, I heard that the Goodwich was a little shack. By the looks of the current location, they must have done really well. There's a nice open kitchen, plenty of inside and out seating, and one of those cool freestyle coke machines.

Now, for the good stuff. The sandwiches. My ultimate favorite is the Reuben-ish on marbled rye. Packed with corn beef, sauerkraut, and thousand island grilled to perfection. They recently started a seasonal menu as well. No matter what sandwich you choose, it's a win!

For locals, you can get it delivered to your home via grubhub, but nothing beats eating the sandwich ASAP when it comes off the grill.

I recommend this place to everyone who visits LV, and I try my best to eat here once or twice while I'm here as well. Best. Sandwich. Ever."}
{"text":"First, let me preface this by saying the food is great and I generally enjoy eating here. But the wait time lately has been ridiculous. The last couple of times I have placed to go orders, it has taken over 30-45 minutes. Even with 6 guys working. Today I actually stopped in to place my to go order and sat there waiting for 43 minutes. This is unacceptable. And not once was I apologized to or offered a drink or a even a discount/coupon for the insane delay. In addition to my sandwich, I was grabbing one for a busy attorney in my office. He got so tired of waiting on me to bring it back that he actually went to get something else for lunch.  Come on guys. They're sandwiches and they're great, but it shouldn't take that long to make them."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the hype is or if I'm just spoiled by sandwich places in other places I have lived, but I don't think this place is anything special. Of course it's better than Subway and chains like that, but it wasn't an other-worldly sandwich experience either. Just kinda the basic sandwich stuff. Everything was tasty don't get me wrong, I'm just not ready to join the Goodwich cult yet I guess."}
{"text":"We all enjoyed our sandwiches, but as a fat guy, they could have been much bigger.  I had the patty, which was like having fantastic homemade beef stroganoff put into a sandwich.  It was so tasty, but was the perfect size for a small Guatemalan girl.  It would have been fine, if it had come with a side such as potato salad, or some fries or something, but I felt that we paid too much for just a small sandwich.

There were seven of us in the group, and we all felt the same way.  The sandwiches were amazing, the people were really nice, the environment was great, but the portions were far too small for the price."}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been coming here for a while! Willy is the best ! He tells me about the sandwiches and I get to try a new one that I end up loving . Much love to this sandwich joint !"}
{"text":"Every bite you take has an exploding amount of chicken juice that comes with it. Then you got the crunch and sweetness from the slaw mix. OMG I ate the slaw by itself cause it was so good. I was worried at first that the chicken would be deep fried, but it really was more of a tempura coating. Not exactly, but very similar.  

The R.U. Chicken Sandwich costs $10.00 and it has MOIST crispy chicken breast, yellow buffalo, sweet pepper slaw, and pepper jack. Although the price of this was not expensive, considering the size of the sandwich. I did not enjoy the price for their desserts. Like most places, I feel like they overcharge on their drink cup and their dessert. The desserts are not made in house, which can by why I feel like its overpriced.
 
They no longer offer delivery through their company. If you need a sandwich delivered to you then you now need to go through postmates. I wouldn't recommend it though. I ate half my sandwich during lunch and ate the rest later. The second half of my sandwich got really soggy. So if you order through a delivery service, then you may not get the full goodness level of the their sandwiches."}
{"text":"It was ok. The ham and cheese sandwich was good.  The pig of the day was also good, a little greasy but good.

I wanted to love the pickles and potato salad, but they fell a bit short and we're over priced for what you got."}
{"text":"The Goodwich is really a fantastic joint. They have fresh food with great ingredients at reasonable prices. I loved their old location however they are not far from their old downtown shack and I can see why this restaurant had to expand to a larger facility. I love their seasonal menu changes and their blending of great flavors is very on point. They never disappoint. If you have not yet tried pickled grapes...do it. At a budget friendly place like this, you have no excuse not to try them."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for something new. I pass this place almost every day. Well Friday I decided to stop and check this place out to see what all the hype was. 4-1/2 stars from Yelp it's got to be good. 
 I had the egg salad and there tomato sandwiches on wheat. I never in my life have had such a good egg salad sandwich. I was out if this world good. There was this crunchy something in it and the flavor was even better. Perfectly gridded. The tomato sandwich was good, light perfectly toasted really good also. Did I mention that both sandwiches were only 8 bucks. That brings to that point. Very well priced as well. I can't wait to continue to try more of there sandwiches. Next time 2 egg salad. Delicious period."}
{"text":"This little sandwich stop is amazing!  Their menu is basic, but simple and gourmet.  My boyfriend and I stopped here to get lunch before making the drive home to SoCal...we both ordered the chicken clubs and we both loved them!  

Next time I'm in the area, I'm going to try the one with foie gras mousse!"}
{"text":"I'm white. And if white people have 'a food', it is the humble sandwich. I can safely say, as a white person and an enjoy-er of sandwiches (I've eaten them all over the globe and even worked in a deli for a few years)  that the Goodwich does one of the best jobs creating original sandwiches that are expertly crafted.  This is a great lunch spot. 
The location...well, I miss living in a real city and as you wait on the corner of the busy intersection while your sammich is assembled, it feels like Vegas is one of those authentic places. I hope this place is around for a while."}
{"text":"Very greasy sandwiches.  A lot of olive oil in everything.  I guess I just have never found something really interesting to eat there."}
{"text":"Wow. Who would think a small sandwich stand could be so good. Falafel sandwich was excellent. A little gem."}
{"text":"Great food, super friendly service, just stay away from the dump called Dino's next door."}
{"text":"FOIE GRAS...F-orget O-ther I-nsignificant E-xperiences G-et R-eady (for an) A-mazing S-andwich at Goodwich.
That is what possessed me to drive from Henderson to Downtown with a growling stomach looking for a unique lunch and not settle for everyday boring because my usual lunch date has stomach issues.
I get to this little shack around 12pm with normal looking people standing in line...not a weird downtown crowd at all. I didn't know what everyone meant by \"OG\"...until I looked across the street and saw OG Topless Bar (good landmark)...maybe where the bad witch lives lol.
I walked up to order looking at the simple menu (with descriptions of ingredients, yay) knowing I was going to try the much talked about \"Foie\" even though I had a lot of apprehension from never having eaten foie gras in my life. I was bewitched by all the positive descriptions everyone posted about this sandwich that I had to have it...good, bad or otherwise I was going to try foie gras today. The gentleman who took my order was very reassuring that it would be a treat for me and that at $9, it was a great way for me to try it and not break the bank. I found an empty chair to eat that made me feel like I was a young student at school having my favorite sandwich at lunch.
As you can already tell, I LOVED it! Such a strange combination to put together but it all works. Foie gras mousse/terrine that had a creamy texture with light earthy, almost truffle-like hints (not at all gamey), this very crispy thick chicken skin (like when you hit the crispy skin jackpot on a perfectly roasted chicken), chopped almonds, and pickled purple cabbage that made sense as a necessity to cut the richness of the foie gras, all inside a grilled crunchy white bread that scrapes the inside of your mouth a little. Creamy, crunchy, savory...I couldn't believe this taste explosion that I enjoyed with each bite to the last. Oh yes. I finished the whole thing! I was really blown away how
 much I enjoyed this sandwich. It was life changing lol. It would be wonderful to see Goodwich occupy a space in the upcoming Galaxy Market in the Arts District...a space for artisanal foods, craft brews and aspiring restauranteurs."}
{"text":"This place was fabulous. Although I didn't have the pig of the week as an option which was sad I was not disappointed. The guy that helped me told me that the Ruben was what made him love the place. I ordered that and I was not disappointed. I also tried the vinegar curry chips. It's not something that I would normally order and I was pleasantly surprised. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Fantastic place in every way. Fast delivery, pleasant employees, incredible food.  Try the patty and #3 coffee. We could eat here everyday."}
{"text":"I'm giving the Goodwich an \"A-OK\", which is odd because I didn't particularly enjoy my sandwich, but I think part of the reason behind this fell squarely on me not bothering to read the menu fully.

I ordered the Ruban-esque, which in essence sounded like a pretty safe choice. I don't normally order rubans, but I thought I should go outside my comfort zone. I should have noted the word \"FENNEL\" in the description, as the sandwich comes with fennel-kraut -- and *shudder* I cannot stand fennel. It is the devil seed. Fennel aside I still felt as though the sandwich lacked - it was really, really greasy, and the meat was chopped really finely, I would have preferred some chunkier portions.

Wait time is a little on the long-side. I stopped by for lunch, and there were two patrons ahead of me, but I think I waited about 10-12 minutes for the sandwich to arrive. Just be aware of the wait time (and take note you'll be standing outside while waiting.)

Also, pricing is a bit steep. I paid $9 bucks for sandwich and that does not include chips or a drink, if you want those, it will be more. 

The place has its perks, and its down-falls. For me, I probably won't be returning as I would prefer to get my sandwich eating on in an actual building with walls and chairs and tables."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious, super clean and the staff is always so positive. I come regularly for lunch and I'm always happy to eat there. Needless to say I will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"This is a Las Vegas gem.  Although like crack and Game of a Thrones, the second you take a bite out of the Patty sandwich, you'll be addicted. The variation of sandwiches and the novel mixture of ingredients make coming here and event more than just a delicious lunch. The service is personal and friendly and you go away feeling it was money well spent. The prices are fair and even very good when you consider the value you are getting.  The Goodwich is the best sandwich place in Las Vegas for now. Treat yourself to a special lunch, then you'll be back for dinner, then lunch then next day..next thing you know you'll be selling your mothers TV for a Ham&."}
{"text":"I ordered and the waitress got my order wrong and I realized AFTER i had swiped my credit card. But then she told me that the transaction never went through so she put my correct order in and I paid AGAIN. I looked at my credit card statement and I was charged TWICE for the incorrect order and the correct order, I can't rectify this because I've left Las Vegas. Very disappointed because when she told me the transaction didn't go through I was a little skeptical but she ASSURED me it failed...should've gone with my gut."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times now...... Really good sandwiches....
First, they are closed on Mondays! Made that mistake once....
Second, its a stand... just a stand... only one or two plastic tables outside in the parking lot....just, wish I could sit inside and eat my wonderful sandwich!!!
Now the food is great!
I have had the Reuben-ish... really good..... I Love the Chicken.... Love the Grilled Cheese (I added tomato)
Not a fan of the radish.... the butter was just too much for my taste... they put a lot of butter.... the radish and sprouts were great!
I plan on going through the whole menu.... one sandwich at a time!"}
{"text":"This sandwich shop is very unique. The menu is a bit different from traditional shops. I had a Ruben and it was a lot different from a traditional Ruben. It was nice and crisp, lightly buttered, sauerkraut wasn't overpowering of the other flavors and was tender yet crisp, the corned beef was very tender and palatable. The staff was extremely friendly and I even had a conversation about sandwiches with one of the cooks. Atmosphere is very pleasant and inviting. I plan to return many times and explore a few of the other interesting items on the menu."}
{"text":"Hubby found this place searching for a good lunch place near the downtown area.  The service was very personable, reminded us of the movie Chef because it felt like a yummy food truck.  My daughter and I had the grilled cheese on white, I added bacon and chicken to mine.  It was tasty but not super cheesy.  My son had the ham sandwich and he liked it.  My husband picked the most popular sandwich that has ground beef, yummy onions and cheese. We all shared and his was TDF!!!! Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of enjoying The Goodwich a few times now and I have loved everything I've tasted! Other reviewers have gone over their location so I want to focus on how fantastic their food and service really is. First off you can call and order and they will bring it to your car. Jake has been there each time I've gone and you can see how busy he is yet he's still very personable!  I love seeing the effort he puts in! Having great service adds to any dining experience so they've already won half the battle. Now the food, I've tried Le Pig, the Spanish, the Foie, and fluff and nut. 

Le Pig- my favorite sandwich! It has beautiful chunks of tender pork belly, arugula dressed in a truffled vinegarette, and fontina cheese. This sandwich is fan-freaking-tastic!!! The flavors of the rich pork belly cut by the dressed arugula makes a symphony in my mouth. 
 
Foie&- foie gras mousse, crispy chicken skin, caramelized cabbage, and almonds. This sandwich has flavors that I would have never thought would work, but WOW the smooth mousse with the crunchy almond are great together. 

Fluff & Nut- this sandwich put a huge smile on my face as soon as I unwrapped it. Gooey marshmallow oozing out of the monte Cristo style white bread. I am still perplexed as to what the crunch is because it was crunchy till the last bite. I ate my Le Pig first and it was still crunchy!!!! 

On my last visit I had the luck of trying their house err stand?  Made pickles and they were fresh,  sweet,  spicy,  and crisp. I've never had such a clean flavorful pickle before. They make it even better by adding some haricot vert. Jake said they're also trying out beets so look for those in the near future! 

All in all I am very impressed by this stand. I tell any and all of my foodie buddies that they NEED to try The Goodwich. Honestly by the looks of it they are doing better then I could have imagined, I'm so happy they're so busy. Good luck Goodwich it looks like you'll be around a while, thank goodness."}
{"text":"It's located on the ground floor of what appears the be an apartment building that caters to hipsters. There's no bathroom in the premise, so you have to go outside, back into the apartment bldg lobby, and use a code to get into the \"1 PER CUSTOMER\" bathroom. Emphasis on \"1 PER CUSTOMER\".....I entered the code and barged in on somebody sitting down.....to make matters worse, it looks like he was a worker at said restaurant, so now I am avoiding eye contact.....awkward turdburgling is awkward. On the bright side, I could hear him washing his hands, so that's a plus. 

Now, onto the food. I had the falafel sammich....it was a bit different. Instead of crunchy balls, the falafel came out in a party, which facilitated a tidier sammich. It had some kale on it (gasp!), but it actually tasted really good. Overall, it was a solid sammich experience, despite the bathroom incident. I'll be back if I'm in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Stopped through on a road trip from LA to Moab, UT and wanted something better than fast food. The Goodwich definitely delivered, plus they were super friendly and helpful. Got the reuben-ish. Perfect amount of mustard and the cheese/meat/bread ratio was ideal. I chatted with one of the owners for a bit while my order was being prepared, and he was genuinely a nice guy - best of luck to these guys! There are a couple tables behind the building if you need to hide from the hot sun."}
{"text":"sandwiches are really good different than the run of the mill sandwich place. I ordered the fish sandwich. Fish sandwich was nice a light not over breaded slaw was really good. Chips and pickles were also good. Looking forward to trying some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Is this place called the Goodwich or the Greatwich? The quality of sandwiches here would lead me to believe that it was called the Greatwich, but alas, it is just the Goodwich!

I love pork, so I went with the Chicharon falafel sandwich and it is heavenly! Every single bite has so much flavour to it.

It's located downtown, so finding parking is a little bit hard but if you can get past that hurdle, then I would definitely recommend coming to the Goodwich for an extremely good sandwich!!!"}
{"text":"It was totally amazing !! I ordered a Uber tuber salad plus an fried egg on top. It was the best salad I ever had! Extremely friendly staff makes everything perfect!
Yummy tummy yummy!"}
{"text":"Being a bit of a sandwich connoisseur, it is unacceptable that it took me a year of living in Las Vegas to try this semi-famous sandwich shop.  Alas, today was the day.  

What earns this shop a 5 star rating above and beyond the food, was the service.  The shop owner, Theo, greeted me warmly upon entering and walked me through the menu, made suggestions, and even shared his favorite menu item.  What a great guy!  No wonder you guys have been so successful.  Overall, great experience and I'll most definitely be back.

-  Wait time was reasonable.
-  Atmosphere was urban and fun
-  food was very good.  The Cold Brown and Chicken BU were both excellent and I'd easily order both again.  The chicken sandwich had a unique batter on it that was very different from your shake shacks, and chic fill a's of the world.
- The house chips were simple, but tasty (jalapeño and salt & pepper were both great)

There's not much I can say negative about this place, but in the spirit of objectivity and balance, if I were to advise them on anything, I might suggest a slightly larger chip portion size, which felt a little skimpy.  

Otherwise, delicious and well done!"}
{"text":"Superb. All salads great. All sammies good too. Unique crunchy bacon PBJ. Rubén excellent and falafel excellent. I would LIKE TO SEE A SOUP with your excellence. Very good job. Clean, perfect and the best quality in the city by far."}
{"text":"The Goodwich is officially one of my cheat places. I yelped and said \"why not?\"
I didn't 'get' the location at first but after my time in SF, you get used to 'interesting' locations. Both times I visited during the lunch- ish hours and parking was not an issue. 

I ordered the ground beef AND the nutella-fluff one. The ground beef is chopped fine and flavored as if momma made it (delicious) The dessert-like nutella combo was decadent and reminded me of something I would make after drinking all day. That is a compliment ;) Reserving this one for when the sugar cravings are out of control.

Once I texted my order ahead, they were responsive, order was ready when promised and pick-up was very smooth. A must if you don't want to wait on the corner."}
{"text":"Great Reuben sandwich. Coming from the east cost it's hard to match....I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way my hotel and picked up one of the best turkey sandwiches I have ever had. It was around 5 pm but the place was surprisingly empty. I placed my order online (through yelp) and the had it hot and ready right on time."}
{"text":"This place had good reviews.  A lot of them.  I was hungover because Vegas. I knew what I wanted and Goodwich did the trick. The Patty with bacon melted in my mouth and took me to a land of sugar plum fairies. The service was great. Good explanations and very patient. Thanks!"}
{"text":"Wanted to try it since Yelp recommended it. I was not disappointed the classic 7 is a very tasty sandwich. Would recommend...."}
{"text":"The food was amazing had the falafel sandwich they made it vegan for me and the sides also. Fun friendly people. A must for sandwich lovers and healthy eating people"}
{"text":"Check the specials menu often for something a little more creative. Service is always friendly, generating a welcome atmosphere."}
{"text":"Really delicious sandwich packed with FLAVOR. 
Friendly service by a cute man from Seattle.
$9 for the Reuben'ish but it was worth it. 
I would like a real table opposed to a bar stool for a table to sit at but I annihilated my sandwich in record time so there was no need for a bigger \"table\"."}
{"text":"I remember first going to The Goodwich when it was just a shack next to Dino's, which makes this review long overdue.

Part of me feels bad when ordering a sandwich anywhere because I hate paying for food I feel like I could make myself. However, I'm certain that I couldn't make the sandwiches this place offers. These are delicious and creative sandwiches that I will gladly pay for. Yes, it costs more than Jimmy John's or Capriotti's, but that's comparing apples to oranges. Sometimes I want Jimmy John's because it's quick and cheaper. Sometimes I want The Goodwich because it's a gourmet sandwich that I'm willing to pay more for. As an example, the Cold Brown is made with roast turkey, bacon, tomato, gruyere fondue, and parsley. If it has gruyere fondue, then it's safe to say that it's beyond my sandwich making skills."}
{"text":"Great little hipster-esque sandwich shop. I got a Reuben while I killed some time waiting on a movie. It was pretty great, but the real treat was the side of broccoli I got which came with nuts and fruits and was simply amazing. I've been trying to recreate it since, and can't wait to try what else this place has to offer"}
{"text":"This takeout restaurant is located in a kiosk on the fringe of Dino's Lounge's parking lot that was formerly occupied by Viva Arepas.  We reviewed the small menu and decided to share a reuben-ish (house cured corned beef, Swiss cheese, fennel sauerkraut, and 1,000 Islands dressing) plus a bottle of coke.  There are no tables, but a few chairs are available abutting the kiosk.  The temperature was on the cool side so we opted to dine in the comfort of our car.  There were several people in front of us, but the wait was worth it because the sandwich was delicious.  While waiting the owner thanked me for our business and said they would be relocating in January to more spacious quarters in the Soho Lofts at 900 LV Blvd."}
{"text":"So so good. The chef was nice enough to make me a BLTG for breakfast even though it's on the lunch menu. Everything is made to order, so be patient, it's worth it. My husband had the 3 lil birds and loved it. Anyway, the BLTG was the best BLT I've ever had, theres melted cheesy grits on it and it just really pulls it together. I wish I could relive the moment I spent eating it."}
{"text":"10/10 every time me and my dad go there every other week to try their pig of the week. The customer service is truly amazing and they always make sure you are happy. The food matches the service truly amazing. Glad to see we have such a rad place in Las Vegas like no other!"}
{"text":"OMG, what is this wich-craft and wizardry?! I've had samplings of The Goodwich at events, but this was my first official visit (I KNOW, I'm so behind) and of course, the only thing I can think is: Why did it take me so damn long to get here??? FACEPALM.

Sandwiches are available on white, wheat, or marbled rye. RYE ALL DAY, EVERY DAY. I love rye so much. I ordered rye on two of the three sandwiches and the other was white bread. Delicious, beautiful white bread.

Fun Guy ($5): Roasted mushroom, sweet garlic fondue, and fried onion. Whoa, this sandwich has got it going on with so few ingredients. I like mushrooms, but I don't love mushrooms; especially when the dish is an ode to mushrooms. This sandwich has a beautiful and subtle mushroom essence with a really flavorful cheese element.

Falafel ($7): Green pea falafel, chickpea puree, cucumber, and kale slaw. This is an amazing vegetarian option with punches of flavor. It was my least favorite of the bunch, but still really solid. The falafel was delicious and I loved the crunch of cucumbers and kale slaw. 

Chicken ($7): Root veg confit, salsa verde, provolone, and crispy skin. I had to save the best for last. I want to marry this sandwich (sorry, Ruben). The flavors are INSANE. All of it. The whole sandwich was pure magic. When I did manage to speak between the muffled bites of pure bliss, all I could say was, \"OHMYGOD!\" BTW, get this sandwich on rye.

In case you don't know the drill, you can text 702-910-8681 to place an order prior to your arrival with 1) Your name, 2) The sandwich, and 3) Bread choice. They've also introduced online ordering on their website recently! You'll receive a response to confirm your order and give you an estimated time of when your order will be ready."}
{"text":"As I said in my tip, probably one of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  I was used to frequenting Greens & Proteins but after hearing good reviews we walked over here one night.  I had the Patty.  It was phenomenal.  My wife has tried numerous chicken sandwiches here and really enjoyed them.  I started getting the Patty with bacon now and it's great.  The customer service has always been amazing, everything is fresh and local and it was our go-to.  

That is until the hours changed.  I'm really perplexed why you'd go from being open on Sundays and until 11:00pm during the week to closed on Sunday's and now closing at 6:00pm on weekdays.  With being in the Ogden and knowing that people walk over from Juhl, Newport, etc it doesn't make sense.  It closes too early now to go here anymore.  

I hope you guys adjust your hours again at least until around 7-8 so people working normal hours can stop by after work.  

Great food, though!"}
{"text":"After 3 tries at this place, twice for lunch, and once after a late night first Friday, each time getting 5 star service and 5 star sandwiches, I finally decided to add a review. I tried the foie & the first time and it is by far my favorite even though I'm not a fan of foie as much as my wife. It is the only one that comes with the chicken skin included. My next stop here I tried the chorizo and added the chicken skin extra. It's like a muffaletta with chorizo. Today I had the Reuben with once again the chicken skin. Great version of the Reuben. My son says the ham which he has had twice is the best sandwich he's ever had. He wishes they opened a branch near where we live so we could eat here more often. I also tried the fluff and nut, which makes for a great dessert sandwich to split after you've eaten one of the other sandwiches. The staff are friendly and the owner remembers almost everyone that's eaten there when they return to eat. They have the better tasting hecho en Mexico soda made with cane sugar. I can't believe the amount of tourists walking by not knowing they are walking past one of the best places to eat in Vegas. And it's affordable too for what you get."}
{"text":"You ever eat something so good you almost start chuckling while eating it?  That's how I felt eating here.  

I've only had one sandwich here, but I can tell you this is the best sandwich place in Las Vegas.  I wanted to order four, but I probably would have gone into to some kind of food coma.  

Next time I need to go with some friends so we can order a bunch of stuff and try a little of each.  

I had a BLTG: Bacon, Greens(Lettuce), Tomato, Cheesy Grits and Aioli.  It was just unbelievable and I hate raw tomato.  I decided to not ask for it without tomato because this feels like the type of place where you shouldn't mess with their recipes and I'm glad I didn't.  

The bread was grilled to golden buttery perfection and despite all the ingredients, it was not too messy.  They really put the right amount of ingredients in.  

I also had the curry vinegar chips which were just outstanding!

Next on my list: The Chix Fix, Hawkeye and Egg Salad."}
{"text":"SPECTACULAR! I've been eating here since the Dino's walk up location. I'm SO happy to see them in this beautiful bright and airy establishment. 

I can't sit here babbling on every sandwich that I've eaten here but if you haven't experienced a Goodwich before, GO TRY ONE!"}
{"text":"Fairly good. Sandwiches were delicious. The pickles were WAY overpriced for such a small cup of them as a side."}
{"text":"Beyond amazing! 

Visited this placed 2 days out of my 4 day vacation. Got the Ham sandwich first day. Got the chicken sandwich (complete with chicken skin bits) on the second day.  On both days I got the Fluff and Nut, and oh my goodness it was sandwich dessert heaven. The nutella, fluff and little rice krispies make the perfect combination in texture and taste. Yum. My mouth is starting to water thinking about it."}
{"text":"Clean and nice and off of the strip.  Sandwiches run 10 dollars and are made/cooked right in front of you.

They have vegan and vegetarian options as well as standard fare.  You can add avocado or a fried egg if you chose!"}
{"text":"This place is super neato! This was my second visit and I'm still impressed, but not mind blown. I had the Cold Brown and a Fluff n Nut the first visit which were both yummy. The Fluff n Nut is why I came back today... I ordered the BLTG, jalapeño-sour cream chips, and another Fluff n Nut. Definitely enjoyed the BLTG (no tomatoes for me) far better than the Cold Brown! The chips, bacon, pickled stuff, etc is made in house which is awesome! I wanted to try a couple other items, but it's a little too pricey for me. My total was $17 rounded up save for tip without a drink. I understand that I got an additional dessert sandwich, but still, it's a bit too pricey for a routine lunch/dinner. The cashier was friendly, but only one person ordered before me and it took about 10-15 minutes for my order to come out. I think last time it was less than 10 minutes with a few more people in line so not sure if that was a miss this visit. Overall, I really love their flavors here, but it's a bit out of the way for me and a little too expensive for me to come here more often. Seriously though, get the Fluff n Nut with extra fluff!"}
{"text":"There aren't enough good things to say about my most recent visit to The Goodwich. I was offered exceptional service from a friendly staff. Any request I had was meet with a quick and joyous response and the interior decor helped settle my mood. I ordered the \"Cold Brown\", a sandwich I quickly made sure to make hot( I'm not sure if \"Cold Brown\" is just a name or really originally a cold sandwich either way making it hot was no issue). And there wasn't a better choice I could have made. My bread choice of marble rye was perfectly toasted and was an ideal companion on the rest of the ingredients. 
I ended my trip with a slice of apple pie, an even better decision then getting the Cold Brown. The crust held up perfectly against the tart sweet combination of the apple filling. A recipe that certainly will make many pie maker jealous. Will return soon."}
{"text":"SOOO GOOD!! This was my 1st time here for lunch and will definitely not be my last. I'm still craving this sandwich as I'm writing this!

1st love the contemporary chic decor inside! Small space with about 5 tables and tv but roomy. They also have outdoor seating for enjoying that Vegas weather. 
 
2nd the staff is very friendly,  everyone greets you with a warm \"Hello Welcome \" and \"Thank you for coming!\" 

3rd THE FOOD, I had the Pig O' the week- can't remember accrual name of sandwich but this changes weekly,  ( hence the name, lol). It had pork butt and belly, greens, grilled napales, radish, some sort of mayo and some other good stuff that I can't remember... sorry :(. But let me tell you it was sooo good!!!!! You can tell the pork is fresh and made in house.  None of that pre-cooked frozen thawed out crap. They also flash fried the pork on the flat grill to give it a nice crisp that made the sandwich that much better. The bread is perfect thickness to hold all those fixings that they pile high on your sandwich, I was surprised but very pleased to see that they didn't skimp on the fillings!  The outside was toasted to golden perfection and it was love at first bite so much flavor in every bite, it surely did not disappoint!!!!

Overall amazing food and concept, they change their menu often with very unique creations so you always have something new to try!!"}
{"text":"Most legit food in Vegas. If you want a gourmet sandwich at a great price. A most stop anytime you're around Vegas. The two owners were helpful and really into what the make and serve here.  Everything is made by them for the sandwiches and it makes all the difference."}
{"text":"Came hungry, left extremely satisfied. Bread was cooked perfectly. I tried the ham& with some curry chips on the side and a grilled cheese with bacon added for an appetizer. The food came out fresh and quick. 

Plenty of seating and everything was clean. Prices were good for the quality of the food.

I also had the pleasure of meeting one of the propietors, Theo (tay-o), who was incredibly polite and cool to converse with. I highly recommend eating here. I will eat here again before I leave Saturday!!!"}
{"text":"The radish sandwich wowzers it's yummy. A little salty but next time I will tell them to cut back a little which might be the cheese. 

Both pickles were fantastic but you gotta be ready for the salt and favors! The one with cloves was my fav had a little bite to it!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at Dino's Lounge and this spot is on the same lot. The simplicity of the menu is what I love. No need for fancy crap! Fantastic sammiches and the service is superb. Great people, small business. Coming back!!!!"}
{"text":"So happy to see their return.   Best sandwiches in Vegas and it's awesome that you can enjoy their food Inside in the comfort of their beautiful store although even on the hottest or coldest day at their trailer the food was always so good it was still worth it!"}
{"text":"The little shack on the corner of South Las Vegas Blvd. and Wyoming dwarfs in comparison to the Stratosphere which looms high in front of it.  But this little eatery is a reminder that size doesn't matter, it's what's inside (mainly the food they can make), that counts.

I did the \"Patty\" (minus the pepper jack cheese and bell peppers).  Although I'm a huge fan of trying things as they are listed on the menu, I went sans pepper cheese and bell peppers on this order because I was sharing with my wife (who isn't a fan of either those things).  You know what, I can't imagine this sandwich tasting ANY better WITH pepper jack cheese or bell peppers.  The meat was ground up real good and had a nice saltiness to go with that slight sweetness coming off the grilled onions (which were plentiful, and plenty appreciated)!  Add in the \"just enough\" creaminess and slight smokiness that smoked cream cheese gave to the sandwich combined with that grilled bread and I was already wishing I had ordered another \"to go.

I also ordered the \"Grill Cheese\", but did it \"Monte Cristo\" style.  They don't have a deep fryer in that little shack, so their version of the Monte Cristo is dipping the individual slices of bread in an egg wash and then grill them (kinda like a french toast). The result is thicker, fluffier bread.  I think I would have rather had the Grill Cheese on that same butter, crisp, bread that the \"Patty\" came on instead.

This place needs to stick around so I can try the \"Fried Egg\" sandwich (as well as some of the others). Til' next time Goodwich!"}
{"text":"Shared the fried egg sandwich and a grilled cheese with avocado and bacon added with a friend. We were watching the Game of Thrones Season 7 premiere next door and they delivered it to us. I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not a big egg eater but I enjoyed it. They were very simple and very tasty. I'd definitely come back when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great little sandwich spot! Sandwiches are made to order so expect to wait a bit. Perfection takes time. The flavor combinations and options for toppings here easily make these breaded big bits worth the wait and cost. And you gotta appreciate the service! Everyone is super friendly and makes you feel like a neighbor. Small shop feel, with big city flavor. Bread crunch is a hit, and the bread-to-sauce-to-meat-to-cheese ratio on point. I'm praying that Food Network never discovers this gem, so keep them in business and bring good friends you care about with you. Both the \"Cold Brown\" and \"Ham&\" are good places to start."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to go here,in fact i went twice in a week. The food is well prepared,you can tell they put high quality ingredients and love into their creations. I tried the falafel the first time and the second time was a ground beef and cheese sandwich. They were both very good. And Will who is the order taker is very cool. You can tell he enjoys serving great food and he is excited to make sure you are completely satisfied. Whoever owns this place needs to make sure they do whatever they need to do to keep this guy he is a major reason i returned the second time. Ok now to the 1 star deduction,the neighborhood sucks and there is no where to eat the food but on the trunk of my car. i could sit in a chair but i dont want crumbs all over me. I was half expecting to get shived at any moment,but hey what a way to go with a delicious falafel sandwhich in my mouth,right? lol..seriously i was half expecting to see dogs raping hookers in the alley...anyways besides the surroundings it was an excellent sandwich...good toast too :)"}
{"text":"This is one of if not my favorite lunch spots in Las Vegas. Everything they make is amazing and the owners and staff are super friendly. They also may have the best patty melt I have ever eaten! The pig of the week is also always ****ing amazing!"}
{"text":"We love the Goodwich. It is such a fabulous place to go when you're in the downtown/strip area, have a car, and have no desire for a chain or a sit-down restaurant. We have a strong tendency to come grab a goodwich whenever fate smiles on us, and we get an unexpected afternoon off, or are about to spend the afternoon adventuring and want a late breakfast/early dinner.

I am a rabid, drooling fan of the Reuben-ish. Everything on it, including the kraut and the beef is made in house, and that, that just makes it taste so much better. Mt grandma still speaks German, and we have saurkraut ceramic jugs, and several of those shavey-kraut blade-cubes. So please understand me when I say this kraut is as good as my grandmothers.

The Grilled Cheese just makes a shitty day better, and pretty much any sandwich is an easy picnic in one step. Two sandwiches, two drinks, and a wander around one of the parks in the area is an easy way to win your date night, and for the price, you can't beat it. You could get a shitty sub at smith's....or a goodwich. Is that even a question!?

The owner is quite often working, and he is a phenomenal guy. Very friendly, very real. The sandwiches are well crafted and amazing, but there is nothing about this place that's pretentious or jerky. It's just really good food, really good people, and an easy, walk up style restaurant. 

Skip the chain, skip the drive thru, eat local. Reward thyself."}
{"text":"My boyfriend brought me another sandwich by them today for lunch. The yummy goodness, toasted to perfection! Don't miss out on these delicious sandwiches. 

We came in yesterday, not many people around, when we placed our order the man said it would 
take about 15-20 mins. I wasn't too big of a rush my class wouldn't start for an hour; but when it getting closer to 30 mins I figured we may need to take this to go. As we are waiting I see one of the guys bringing catering bags back and forth to his car, therefore we could see they were swamped. Finally, the head cook came out with our sandwiches and was extremely apologetic and went above and beyond for us. Very wonderful customer service and the food is delicious, highly recommend it and try their homemade pickles!"}
{"text":"Yelp reviews led us to this treasure right off of Las Vegas Blvd. We were looking for a quick stop on the way back from Utah, and this is a nice break from the road. The service was fast and it gave us a chance to eat a quick meal. The restaurant is decorated in a cute retro vibe. The employee that took our order was very knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly. I ordered the tomato sandwich on white with cheddar. It was basically a fancy version of a grilled cheese, but it did melt in my mouth. It had an aioli sauce that was to die for, and made me want to figure out how I can re-create this delight at home. Ashley was super stoked to find out they had three types of pickled vegetables and was a little more adventurous than me with her choice of pickled watermelon. We were just back from a camping trip, so we couldn't pass up the s'mores dessert. It contains Nutella homemade graham cracker cracker crumb, and housemade marshmallow fluff. They sandwich this between two types of bread to make pure perfection. I could not ask for a better end to a tasty meal. The only reason they did not get five stars is because the area can be a little sketchy; the restroom is down an alley so be careful."}
{"text":"These sandwiches are bombastic!!! I tried their falafel and grilled cheese sandwich and loved both of them. If you are a cheese person...you must try their grilled cheese. It has an abundant amount of melted cheese that melt in your mouth! YUUMM! The falafel sandwich is also amazing. I think this is a great option for vegetarians. The falafel per se was hearty and plenty. 

The service was also great. The only thing is that we did wait a while for our order. We were the only people there and it still took a considerable long time to get our order. Is this a problem..? Not really, the food is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"My first yelp review ever but I absolutely had to for this place. I'm not typically a huge sandwich person, but this was literally the best sandwich I've ever had, this place is delicious. I had the sandwich with crispy chicken skin, arugula and cheese. The workers were also super friendly. This place was great all around."}
{"text":"If you want the best sandwiches in Vegas come to The Goodwich. If I lived closer, I be here way too often. Haven't had the homemade apple pie yet, but it looks phenomenal. I'm heading back up to the register to order a \"Rocketproof\" coffee for the road. To all concerned, I will be back and back and back....you should follow suit."}
{"text":"The Goodwich is phenomenal!! I was in the area for work on Tuesday, saw the great reviews on yelp and decided to try it out. I got the ham, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich on rye and it was so good! I loved it so much I took my husband on Saturday, and he loved it so much we went back on Sunday :). Three times in one week? A little crazy, but oh so good. 

Of the sandwiches we tried, the Reuben-ish was my favorite, followed by the chicken, or the ham & breakfast one. Also, I could eat an entire loaf of just their rye bread."}
{"text":"Sometime I wonder if some of the dope reviews patrons leave are just a matter of trend and conformity...hip new place opens up, everyone thinks its cool and different and viola! momentum is created for the new foodie item and simple, seemingly trivial components like honest service, politeness and efficiency are thrown out the window.

I mean, c'mon on. I am totally willing to wait in line for a delicious meal, even if it means standing outside on a seedy corner on the Vegas strip. I don't mind the wait times, especially if it means quality food. However, what I do mind is the promise of said food in a time-frame that couldn't be met. Here's the deal:

Friday night our party of 4 stops by the Goodwich after exploring the new Fremont street. I've been curious to stop by this place for months, having gone to the Arepa stand that used to be in its place. I've heard good things about the Fluff&Nutt and Ham sandwich with Arugula so I was excited to try the place out. What was even better was the 5-minute wait time the cashier assured me upon ordering both sandwiches and the offer to bring it to our car, all bagged up when it was ready. No one else was seemingly in line, so the prospect of eating a delicious sandwich in minutes had my mouth watering.

Sadly, it all went downhill from there. Ten minutes pass - no big deal. 5 minutes is no reason to get all worked up. Fifteen minutes pass - getting a little antsy. Twenty-five minutes pass - I walk up to the counter upon which the cashier is trying not to make eye-contact with me. Then, what I believe to be a random patron asks me if I've ordered yet as I'm trying to get the cashier's attention (keep in mind this is a TINY stand) and as I tell him I've already ordered and have been \"waiting for days\" he busts out with...

\"We try to think of ourselves as somewhere between Jimmy Johns and In-n-Out, so all our orders are made from scratch...you'll need to be patient\"

I told him that I'm ok with waiting for great food, but that I was simply irked by his employee's false promise and subsequent failure to acknowledge it. A big part of my dining experience out is the service - yes, I wasn't at a five-star restaurant but basic timing, let alone common courtesy, is not something that requires a michelin star to understand. What was worse was that he simply went back to his group of friends (employees, random customers? I don't know) standing to the side of the shop to hang out again, seemingly oblivious. No word to the cook, no mention to the cashier. Just a simple brush off as if I had come across the wrong side of the tracks.

Bottom line - by the time we actually received our sandwiches (which I had to come get myself despite his offer to bring it to us), I wasn't in any kind of mood to eat it. The Fluff-Nut was ok...a nice little dessert spin on the quintessential grilled-cheese, but I didn't even bother to try the Ham sandwich because of the bad taste the cashier left in my mouth. My friend said that it was good, but nothing special. 

Kind of how I was made to feel simply trying to buy a sandwich. 2 STARS"}
{"text":"The family and I made it to the Goodwich three weekends in a row - this is a huge deal for us because we definitely are not in that part of town very often.  So a trek this way for a sandwich must mean it's good stuff!

Our first visit we got: 

* Foie & \"foie gras mousse, crispy chicken skin, cabbage, almond\" ($9) - Rich, decadent, messy, and oh so good.  But probably best to share this one because it's a heavy sandwich for one.

* Le Pig \"belly, fontina, rocket, truffle vinagrette, chip bits\" ($9) - This has probably become one of our favorites as we've ordered this again.

* PBB&J \"peanut butter, bacon, rosemary, pepper jelly\" ($5) - I haven't had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in years.  Once you have this version, you won't be able to eat a regular PB&J sandwich again.  And bacon? Hello!

Subsequent visits:

* Span-ish \"chorizo, mortadello, manchego, olive, piquillo\" ($9) - Our picky eater, aka the Little Guy, was all over the mortadello!  As a result, he may never eat good old-fashioned bologna again!

* Chicken \"provolone, bacon, wilted greens, tomato, ginger\" ($7) - The chicken was actually still in the roaster, so they suggested using pork belly in the sandwich instead.  Pork belly, when is it not tasty?

* Grilled Cheese \"bread, american, bread\" ($3) - This was a pretty boring grilled cheese sandwich, it's literally just bread and cheese.  In retrospect, adding some bacon ($2) or foie gras ($4) probably would have taken this little sandwich to a whole new level.

What I love about the Goodwich is that it's fast food, but not.  Sure, it takes a little while to get your sandwiches made but that's okay.  We put our orders in and pay and then the food gets run out to our car.  So, we love that.  And service - I cannot say enough things about how important great customer service is and these guys know this.  They make small talk, they recognize and appreciate return customers, and they are flexible.    

And you can call or TEXT your orders in ahead of time!  How sweet is that?! 

They had a Mushroom Melt on their very first day and haven't had it since.  I've been asking and so far no luck.  But they said that if enough people ask for it, it may show up again.  Help a girl out!  Ask for the Mushroom Melt!"}
{"text":"I came here for the foie sandwich and somehow managed to try the Ruben-ish, the Span-ish, the Ham, the Patty, the Chicken, and the Le Pig x 2 instead. Luckily, it worked out for me since they ended up making a few changes to the menu. I can still get foie, but some of the other items have been replaced. The sandwiches are crafted with a unique combination of flavors and textures. They're moderately stuffed and I find them pretty filling. Order yours \"monte crisco\" style if that's your thing. I like crunchy bread so I started skipping out on the egg bath. The new version of the Le Pig was just ok. It sounded great in theory, but I wasn't a fan of the banh mi twist they put on it. Also the chicharone gets a little soggy. It's ok, I'll be back for the foie. For real this time!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong the food is fantastic!! I order here all the time! For my office and my staff! I've spent at least $500 a month there on sandwiches. So I could leave this review if I want to!  
 
 I've spent at least $500 a month there on sandwiches. But I just put in a phone order for $30 and had one of my staff pick it up as opposed to using Postmates, which is sometimes more convenient than calling the Goodwich... Heres why I give it 3 stars and not 4/5!! It really gets on my nerves,that guy that picked up the phone sounded condescending first of all, at 1:08 pm and is barely putting in the phone order 30 minutes later!! You had one job man!

Now because of your incompetence my staff and myself have to wait longer to get our food and eat, putting us late back on to work or a quick uncomfortable lunch. Then to compensate, he gives the employee I sent there a soda and a cookie. How about calling me back and apologizing for the delay or a discount?"}
{"text":"Goodwich supplied the yummy food for KNPR's Focus on Nevada Photo Contest reception at the Contemporary Art Center (right next door).

Everything was DELICIOUS--a hit with both me and my finicky husband. (Another Mikey. Anyone remember Mikey? \"Let's get Mikey to eat it: He won't eat it; he hates everything.\")

I tried the street corn side, the pickles, an egg salad sandwich, and a reuben-ish. Just typing this is making me crave all four.

I will definitely be back when I'm next in the area. Thumbs up to Goodwich for both serving excellent food and for supporting KNPR, our awesome local public radio station!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since it was little stand off of lv blvd and oakey. Always a fan and always satisfied. Just tried their nitro cinnamon spiced tea and it's amazing"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious.  Had their pork belly sandwich on rye and it was fantastic. First, the bread was amazing.  Had a good rye flavor and was obviously made by an experienced baker.  It's not the standard rye you get at the supermarket.
Pork belly was nice and tender with a good balance between meat and fat.  Topped with some tasty greens.  It's definitely a gourmet sandwich at a very reasonable price.  In fact, many of their sandwiches cost what you'd pay for a Subway sandwich only everything is made from scratch, fresh, and delicious.  
It's nice to eat a sandwich made by a real chef.  Highly recommended.
I ate it on the hood of my car but am told you can eat inside Dino's.  They'll even deliver it inside if you're in there having a brew or two or 8.
Oh yeah I forgot - I also had the house made pickles.  Fantastic and a nice side to go along with the richness of some of their sandwiches."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in the area and stopped by the Goodwich and had a sandwich.  They were wonderful and we plan on going back."}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yum!!! Goodwich the name says it all!

This place is located right in Dino's Bar's parking lot. Just a little stand with some tables and chairs. Sounds great to me! The staff really care about everything they make and put into the food. They are also super friendly and attentive. They have sandwiches ranging from $3 to $9 and you can also add stuff on if you'd like. After checking out the menu I ordered the Ruben-ish and Joel had the Patty and we shared a bag of bbq kettle chips.

I love how they brought the sandwiches out all wrapped in white paper and a goodwich sticker. Very retro! Love it! Now the food. Wow! All the flavors in the Ruben melted together perfectly. Lots of meat on toasted marble rye. Joel's was oozing with cheese when he pulled it apart. The meat and cheese mmmm they sure know how to pair ingredients. 

Goodwich seriously did not disappoint. I can't wait to go back to try all their other sandwiches. I forgot to mention that you can make any sandwich a monte cristo by just asking. They also change some of their sandwiches to fit the seasons. I really love that. I loved the whole experience. Goodwich is a can't miss spot for lunch, dinner or a late night snack."}
{"text":"Went to try breakfast.  Tried CB (corned beef) hash and eggs, and (fish) cake and eggs.  The corned beef hash was definitely home made but a little bland - needed some salt.  The fishcake was really good.  Portions were adequate but not enough if you're used to giant casino breakfast platters and buffets.  Still want to go later in the day to try the sandwiches that Chris V. raves about."}
{"text":"Came here after a long flight from Philadelphia. Though I came in ten minutes before they close, they were friendly and gave great service. As someone who waited tables and frequently got angry when fills came in at closing time, I greatly appreciate this.

This review is about the food. The Reubenish sandwich. I was impressed. I've had a ton of Reubens and this one is up there in my list now.

The bread was crisp and buttery, with a soft finish that respected the contents of the sandwich.

The sandwich had a balanced blend of kraut/cabbage, beef, cheese, and slighty spicy Russian/thousand island dressing. The ratio of the ingredients was intelligent, a bit less greasy than a classic Reuben.

The kraut on the sandwich tasted housemade. The cabbage still had a fresh crisp and proudly displayed hints of Caraway without being overpowering. 

The corned beef was seasoned well and had a fall apart bite. They chop up the meat and sear it to acheive great maillard surface area (the chef must follow Serious Eats). The balance of meat to fat was carefully thought out and added a savoury depth to the mouthfeel without overpowering the palate.

The sandwich oozes with a marriage of fully melted cheese and spicy Russian dressing. The flavors are fresh and unique.

Goodwich is definitely worth a short trip off the strip. They are serving intelligent and inventive sandwiches in a comfortable and contemporary environment."}
{"text":"Damn my friend for introducing this place to me so late. So I came here last night, with my buddy, and my girlfriend. Since it was our first time, we would like to try all different thing. Reuben, Patty, street corn sandwich.
Reuben sandwich was a basic Reuben sandwich, but adding more flavor to it with some cheese. I don't know how to explain, it was just good.
Patty sandwich is basically a sandwich that the inside is hamburger patty. They put cream cheese inside, which made the sandwich more flavorful. I really liked this sandwich the most.
Street corn sandwich was having very interesting taste. I got a recommendation from their worker, they asked us to put fried chicken add to it. Taste was really funny. I am not saying it was bad, but it really had interesting flavor. I really liked they way they toast the bread. And they had chips that they make their own seasoning, which was really good too. I highly recommend you getting curry vinegar flavor if you have chance to order one.

Overall, great experience, great food, I will definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"Omg I love this place!!!!! Everyone here is so friendly. This place is next door to globe salon in soho lofts.

Ive had a turkey sandwich here and also the Reuben! Both were super delicious and made with love. Everyone I'm sure loves their jobs here... Even the cooks who make the sandwiches are laughing and smiling the whole time which is such good vibes. Everything is fairly priced too which is a shocker because it's downtown.

They have a cool soda machine (the ones with millions of flavor options and soda) and water cups for water. Clean restaurant, nice location, and awesome staff! My fave sandwich place for sure :) I will be back."}
{"text":"I was excited to have a new food choice for our weekly ritual of \"The Downtown Triangle\" where we go eat, have a cigar at our favorite place, and then get some gelato afterwards. 

We were greeted by the menu to take our order. I kinda like that someone comes out to talk to you, it's more personal that way.

The BF and I shared : 

Ham & ( thick cut ham and daily inspiration which at this time was sharp cheddar, mostarda and greens). It was a nice balance of the smoky ham, the sweet mostarda chutney, the cheese, and the herbaceous bite of the eye. For $5 this is great value too. 

Le Pig ( pork belly, fontina, rocket, truffle vinaigrette, chip bits) I like that the pork belly has been crisp up so even the fatty bits can make a lover of someone who normally stays away from it. Again, its a nice flavor balance. Loved the buttery white pan de mie style bread.

We got some chips which is bagged chips by Tims and pickles which are homemade. Kinda reminds me of bread and butter in flavor and was really good mix of pickled cucumbers and green beans. 

You can pick the bread between a white pan de mie, wheat and a marbled rye. We asked them to pick which breads were best with each instead of pick. I really say get the Ham & with rye as it adds a unexpected dimension and brings down the sweetness a little. 

So this spot is so good, we came back after cigars for a snack! We shared a PBB&J on wheat. I was one of those kids who never ate PB&J and never acquired a like for them. This was a game changer for a doubter of peanut butter sandwich magic. The peanutty flavor with the red pepper, the rosemary and the bacon was awesome. I seriously went home and saw the black forest bacon waiting to be eaten in my fridge and wished I had bread and pepper jelly. 

Their moniker is \"stacked rite sandwiches\" and it was indeed stacked just right. The amounts of everything is in the right balance as well as the flavor play in a stack that stays put. Simple things like sandwiches sometimes fail so bad as a \"elevated\" item, but these are successful and smart creations. Makes sense as Jake and Josh have worked haute cuisine which I found out while chatting with Jake. I figured they were experienced as there wasn't anything I could fault. The menu is just right, the prices are competitive, the friendly service and efficient cooking isn't at the level a 2 week old business is normally at.... They are working out having someone prep more as they are running out of things during the day, but them alone couldn't keep up so it's not a fault, but perhaps a show of a success that they run out and always have orders in the queue. 

After this I feel almost hard pressed to not make the ritual be specific to eating ONLY at the Goodwich, smoke only at Cigarbox and get gelato only at Art of Flavors. The perfect day off triangle. Either way, I am absolutely in love."}
{"text":"Who doesn't love a good, honest sandwich in a good, honest city? Goodwich successfully stripped all that I previously knew about sandwiches and gambled with some ingredients to create some unique, but delicious concoctions. 

I did not expect for the \"restaurant\"to be a little stand in the parking lot of the \"last neighborhood bar in Vegas\" and was somewhat disappointed that it was not an option to sit and eat. My friend and I were driving through the city on a road trip and didn't  feel like finding a different establishment. After ordering, we waited for an oddly long time as I questioned the man who took our order about life in sin city. 

The falafel was pretty good - the kale salad was a tad bit overwhelming in its quantity. But my friend's chicken sandwich was great. And both were affordable. Few good decisions are made in Vegas, but eating a Goodwich is one of them."}
{"text":"I've had great sandwiches, but this was a great, unique and amazing sandwich place.  As an LA foodie, who travels to vegas a lot, I'll be making the Goodwich my new go to spot.

The falafel (yes that amazing chickpea Mediterranean staple) is an absolute must.  They make a flattened green chickpea falafel patty fried perfectly, with a kale slaw that tastes like a fusion of tabouli and heaven.  The bread is golden butter brown, the way an epic grilled cheese should be. We also tried an incredible curried cauliflower sand which .  I'm no vegetarian, but if this was in LA I could easily become one.  I can't wait to try the pulled chicken and pulled pork, and I hope you will too.

Thank you for an incredible experience and I can't wait to come back and try more things!"}
{"text":"No doubt the best DAMN sandwich place in the downtown area!!  GREAT SANDWICHES with healthy choices or NOT!  The staff is helpful annnnnnnd will help you match your delicious sandwich with a salad or soup!!  I stop here about twice a month to fill my sandwich craving!!"}
{"text":"A Geno's cheese steak.  A pastrami from Katz Deli.  A French dip from Philippe's.  A brisket and tongue from Carnegie Deli.  A godmother from Bay Cities Italian Deli.  A \"Fluff and Nutt\" from the Goodwich.  

Unfair compression?  If you're going to charge me $3.00 for something I can make at home for $0.50 or claim to serve foie de pate for only $9.00 you better be able to compete with the big boys.

A great concept, chef inspired twist on the classics but in the end, these are greasy, unhealthy, bizarre sandwiches.

- PBB&J (peanut butter, bacon, pepper jelly and rosemary).  Bizarre but it works.  Peanut butter and bacon, a match made in heaven is complemented by the herbaceous aroma of the rosemary.

- \"Ruben-ish\" (corned beef, Swiss cheese, thousand island dressing, fennel kraut) A paltry amount of somewhat dry, corned beef that initially pairs well with the anise flavor of the kraut.  The kraut quickly becomes overpowering with each bite.

- \"Foie &\" (Foie pate, crispy chicken skin, cabbage, almonds)  Chicken skin is excellent while the sautéed cabbage adds vegetal sweetness and almonds, crunch.  I doubt their claim that they are using pate de foie gras.  French law mandates the pate be made of 80 percent foie.  The mouth feel is off and the mineral flavor leads me to think this is chicken liver pate.

Supermarket quality white, wheat or rye breads.  All becoming dry from toasting.  Making them \"Monte Cristo\" (a dip in egg before being griddled) just makes them more greasy and less appetizing.

Excessive Yelp hype aside, in the end, just an average sandwich."}
{"text":"The looks and location of this sandwich stand can be deceiving, but please do not let it stop you from trying it out these guys know how make awesome sandwiches!!!

The sandwich price ranges from $3, $5, $7 & $9. 
They are home made ingredients and fresh off the grill. 
My favorite sandwich which the best I've tasted in Vegas is the REUBEN-ISH house corned beef, melted Swiss cheese, fennel kraut, 1000 island dressing. The key was the bread that was toasted perfectly and the right portion amount of corned beef. Simply Amazing!!!

Will (owner) is a very nice guy and was cool to chat with. I'll definitely be stopping by again."}
{"text":"It's no wonder this place is always packed.   The food is amazing.   The service is friendly and helpful.   For an amazing lunch or a light dinner,  you can't beat the Goodwich!"}
{"text":"This was a great find in Vegas.  A bit out of the way and just a tiny little place on the corner...  about the size as a food truck, but not mobile.
Staff was great.  Menu was pretty simple.  There are photos posted of them and the numbers on the side are the price you pay.
I think the menu changes often and always with interesting and fresh ingredients.  We got a loaf sandwich (made with like pork and lamb or something) a reuben and a grilled cheese for the kids.  
The car smelled heavenly on the way back to out hotel and everything tasted great.  I wanted to make it back here and try something else but we never did.  Maybe next time."}
{"text":"The Goodwich is one of my favorite places to eat, not just for sandwiches, not just in Vegas, but ever. The flavor combinations here are outstanding and delightfully creative. I love that the menu changes seasonally, so there's always variety, and an incentive to try the new items before they're replaced by something else unique and delicious. The staff always makes great recommendations and everyone is warm and friendly. I love taking my friends and family here. I hope this place stays open forever!"}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this particular place. 

Even though they are known for their sandwiches, I ordered the uber tuber salad with pulled turkey for $13. The pulled turkey was actually cut up deli meat turkey (false advertising). I ordered dressing on the side- which they obliged with, but even the small amount I used made my salad extremely salty. The potatoes were diced and scant.

Needless to say, I was disappointed after hearing all the hype and pretty irritated I paid $13 for it."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp! You helped me find this amazing sandwich shop!

I was in the area and had to see what 5 stars was about! 

Small menu, which is good. Nothing complicated. I got the Fluff&Nut and my Bf got the grilled cheese. Only 7 bucks for the two sandwiches! 

I talked to the gentleman that was taking the orders until the sandwiches were done. He was so nice and friendly. I think he was the owner? Not to sure, but I told him this business was going so far in the future. It was doing so well and I can't wait to see more sandwiches on the menu and a bigger place for them! 

The food was so good. Who would of thought that chocolate and marshmallow could work that well on a piece of buttered bread? I really want another one. I wish this place was on every corner instead of mcdonalds. It was just so simple, but had the right touch and flavor. 

I need to go back soon!"}
{"text":"The Goodwich is an unassuming walk-up, just a semi-permanent food trailer.  There's no customer seating, but plenty of parking so we sat in the car and dug in to our premium sandwiches.  These are not the sandwiches your mom makes unless she took the time to grill, deep fry, slow roast, and make almost everything from scratch.

We tried the Special of the Day which was a Pork Cutlet Sandwich with cheese, lettuce, tomato, and homemade dressing.  The sandwich had a nice crunch from the breading and was pretty mild in flavor despite having so much going on.

I was pretty excited about the Pate Sandwich because I love Vietnamese Pate Sandwiches.  The pate was course and firm and the ratio was a bit off with too much pate (did I really write that?!) and homemade pickle spread which made the sandwich a bit salty.

The hands down winner was the Reuben-ish.  We all agreed the sandwich had everything you wanted from a Reuben: tender, flavorful corned beef, and the perfect ration of cheese, kraut, and dressing.

The Owner/Order Taker is friendly, helpful and efficient and you can tell there is a passion for the food and the business.  Definitely give this place a try when you're looking for a fresh take on the humble sandwich."}
{"text":"This review is long over do as I have now become a regular at The Goodwich according to Yelp check ins. 

I first found out about The Goodwich from a friend. He tried numerous times to get me to go when they were just a stand on the corner. However, I didn't make it there until they opened in their current location. 
Upon entering you good a very welcoming vibe from everybody in the shop. Everyone that work there is so friendly and checked on my friend and I to see how we were enjoying our meal. I really like most of the decor, it is unique and fits the business
 The first time I came in, I ordered The Patty.. wholly deliciousness. This sandwich was just so good. Cheesy gooey goodness. I could totally see how this is their most popular sandwich. 
The second time I came in I ordered the Rueben-ish. I wasn't a fan of this sandwich. I felt the balance between kraut and meat and sauce was off. I could taste more of the 1000 sauce than I could of the meat and kraut. 
The third time I came in I had the Ham&... wholly deliciousness again.. this sandwich is soo good, perfectly balanced..the mostarda on it just gives it this flavor the is beyond words.. by far my favorite right up there with the Patty. 
The fourth time I came in I had the BLTG. I wasn't a fan of this sandwich much either. This was my first time having grits and I didn't particularly like them, I felt they kinda took away from the overall flavor of the sandwich... but this is a personal thing as my friend loved the sandwich. 
I will be back  as I am slowly working my way through trying each sandwich on the menu. I highly recommend this place to my friends and a lot of them have come to love it as much as I do."}
{"text":"Theo and Josh have crafted the absolute best sandwich spot in the city. They are also just great community participants. The food is always super fresh and their recipes are thoughtfully savory and modern. Their breakfast on the weekend is a must. If you can only have one lunch before you die, go to Goodwich."}
{"text":"While a sandwich shop, the menu has fancy names for different sauces, and seasonings. The food has a Middle Eastern or mediterranean style to it, and therefore has many vegetarian options, including delicious sounding salads. 
My wife had a falafel sandwich. It was SO very good! However, she had the marble rye. Normally, they toast all of their sandwiches. I would recommend either going with a different bread (they also have white and wheat), or getting untoasted, as the marble rye toasted is a bit hard.
I had the Pollo Cuermo sandwich. Chicken with spinach, cheese, and a bunch of fancy sounding stuffs. It was good, but alas, I had the toasted marble rye also, and it was hard.
They have a mini-Coca-Cola Freestyle machine, which is VERY cool, as well as unsweetened ice tea (free refills on both, of course). While the cups are smaller (12 ounces), they have fat straws. (The mini machine simply has fewer options than the full-fledged, such as no Mello Yello flavors)
We got a bag of their homemade chips. They have Vinegar-Curry, Sea Salt and Pepper, Dill PIckle, and Jalapeno-Sour Cream flavors. We got the jalapeno-sour cream. The texture was decent enough. For kettle chips, they weren't too hard, which is good. The flavor was very, very bland. Not quite just potato, but not much else. Certainly not spicy at all. I ate them all, but I think it was more about the crunch than the flavor.
We also had the strawberry pie. It was layered with cut up strawberries, with perhaps a little strawberry preserves holding it together (not really preserves, but homemade goo, sort of like thick strawberry shortcake goo). The pie crust was like a moist Pop Tart, but more flaky: well done. It was topped with homemade whipped cream, which was bland. Overall, the pie was good, but not very sweet, and not runny, which I prefer.
The restrooms are located next door in the lobby of the apartment building. You need a code to get in, and they were very clean, albeit slightly inconvenient. Just slightly. 
Pricewise, with two sandwiches, two drinks, a bag of chips and slice of pie, it was $32. Not horrible, but not cheap.
We will definitely be back. There are so many things on the menu, I want to try them all!"}
{"text":"Great finds like this is what Yelp should be all about!   I never would have found this dive if it wasn't for all those Yelpers out there who gave this joint its just due.  It's located near down town, so if you don't work in the area or were told by a regular, you'd never know it existed.  The menu is limited and has a weekly changing \"sandwich of the week\", so be sure to check back weekly.  Was dying to try out their Cuban-ish, but sadly not this week.  I had one of their recommended sandwiches, Ruben-ish, instead and it was AWESOME!   The corn beef was so soft that it practically melted in my mouth... and in my belly!   Can't wait to go back to try out the other \"goodwiches\".   Definitely top 3 sandwich joints I have ever been to.  Two big thumbs up that would rival the \"Fonz\"!"}
{"text":"Continuing a shift in catering to locally owned and operated Restaurants it was from soon-to-be-neighbor The Goodwich that lunch arrived on Monday, Director of Operations Nichole Hegge taking it upon herself to oversee delivery of two trays of Sandwiches, plenty of Mac n' Cheese plus Salad and Cookies.

Truly a story of building a brand out of nothing, Joshua Clark's stint serving \"Stacked-Rite\" Sandwiches out of a shack in front of Dino's Lounge now yielding a full-scale Restaurant inside the Soho Lofts with a second location coming soon at Buffalo and Warm Springs, it was precisely on time that Ms Hegge stepped out of the elevator with everything still warm despite a twenty-five minute drive, the finishing touches added in the staff kitchen where breadcrumbs were placed atop tender elbow Noodles. 

Adding quality plates, napkins, utensils and serviceware as part of the per-head cost, all signs of a Business who knows how to impress, it was with a modest tab which even impressed the sponsor that a diverse staff eyed items carefully before digging in, the Kale one inquired \"that's what they make Green Smoothies out of, right?\" popular amongst several thanks to its light and refreshing flavor even before adding Dressing provided on the side. 

Capable of being either healthy or gluttonous, Mondays adding to The Goodwich's allure with Chef's Choice Macaroni & Cheese which this week fortunately came gooey with Pimento-Cream Cheese plus Cheddar, it was with Crumbs settling in crisp juxtaposition that all but those with a low spice tolerance were impressed, the fact that nearly two whole trays went home as someone's family dinner entirely a result of more-than-generous portioning.

Moving next to three signature Sandwiches, self-selected on two styles of toasted Bread and quartered at the Restaurant's discretion, fans of Chef Clark's Patty Melt will be thrilled to know the house-ground Beef  travels well without becoming soggy despite melted Cheese and Sauteeed Onions, the same praise equally applicable to herbaceous Falafel that eats light, crisp and healthy as well as the Kentucky-inspired \"Cold  Brown\" that is available with  or without Bacon, though anyone omitting that crispy goodness is either of a religion where Pork is forbidden or simply foolish.

Rounding out the meal with two-dozen Brown Butter Chocolate Chip Cookies, arguably the best in town and delivered still slightly warm with a soft center, suffice it to say that anyone looking for a great spread without breaking the bank should definitely consider The Goodwich for catering, their addition to a growing monthly rotation guaranteed to be even more prominent when a location less than one mile away opens.

While it might take a little more effort and planning to cater from The Goodwich rather than Earl of Sandwich, Firehouse Subs or Panera the combination of ingredient quality, commitment and local ownership makes every extra second spent worthwhile and everyone from the well-traveled gourmand to those happy with Subway will be able to appreciate the difference"}
{"text":"Simply great sandwiches.  The roasted turkey and beef sandwich (with cream cheese) were excellent. Kids liked the grilled cheese. These sandwiches were like having a chef making you his afternoon snack. If you ever go into a professional kitchen the cooks make food for themselves and sometimes it's better than the food on the menu. This reminded me of sharing a great meal with the guys in the back. This place is basically a kiosk on the border of downtown LV. Easy to miss. But close to everything. Server/Cook was very knowledgeable and loyal to the brand. Be careful for lunch line during the week. Go on Sunday. Worth the trip...most definitely."}
{"text":"If I could give 10 stars I would!! The service is great--Will was super friendly and helped us work through the menu. I had the patty and my boyfriend had the chicken. We were both blown out of the water. I don't understand how anyone could NOT give this place a 5 star. The quality of meat is superb. They take their time to craft each and every sandwich. Truly this place is a gem. It's a MUST--nothing like any sandwich I've ever had. It truly is a goodwich!!"}
{"text":"Another among the downtown gems. During the summer they are only open till 2pm and hopefully that will change come fall. 

Sandwichs are very good. I wish they had not dumped their foie gras sandwich but alas....and their choice of bread and its quality is uninspired....so....

Next time you are in that area of LV Blvd trying to score an eight ball give them a try...."}
{"text":"After scaling the Stratosphere, all I could think of was coming to The Goodwich for lunch. I had it all planned the day before, however, I finished the climb waaaay sooner than I anticipated. I was texting my order to Jake (one of the owners of The Goodwich) while I was waiting inside Dino's Lounge. He even delivered it to me inside Dino's. Talk about service deluxe!

You can get your Sammie in white, wheat or rye. Get it done Monte Cristo-style for 50 cents. Add-ons start at 50 cents to $4: Chip bits, fried egg, bacon, crispy chicken skin and foie gras. For sides, they have: chips, pickles, pickled chips and pickled beets (not always on the menu so, ask). Drinks: water, soda, house infusions and shandy. If you're like me and want to skip lines, text your order in to 702-910-8681 and specify if you're picking up curbside or Dino's Lounge. Give them about 20 minutes to get your food ready depending on how much food you order and how busy they are. 

I was extremely hungry so I got 4 sammies: Le Pig, Foie, Span-ish and Fluff & Nut...all in wheat bread.

Le Pig:
Pork belly, rocket, fontina, truffle vinaigrette and chip bits. The pork belly chunks are fatty and the chip bits add saltiness and crunch to this sandwich. Lots of incredible flavors. My favorite out of all I've tried. 5/5

Foie:
Foie gras mousse, cabbage, crisp chicken skin and almond. Creamy and rich foie gras with a bit of texture from the cabbage and almonds. The chicken skin is crisp with a thin layer of meat. A close 2nd favorite of mine. 5/5

Span-ish:
Mortadella, manchego, chorizo, olive and piquillo. The olive and piquillo combination reminds me of giardiniera. Altogether, this sandwich resembles a muffuletta but with better ingredients and less layers. It's salty, tangy and delicious! 4/5

Fluff and Nut:
Nutella, marshmallow fluff and crunch. The marshmallow is ooey gooey. The creamy chocolate hazelnut perfection that is Nutella with a sweet-salty toffee crunch. It's sweeet. 4/5

Their hours are limited since Jake and Josh have day jobs. They're hipsters for sure. A great addition to this area. Their sandwiches are extremely amazing and it would take me a long time to get over it."}
{"text":"The Goodwich is dank. In the middle of a dive bar parking lot, across from a Strip Club, you'll find what looks to be the remnants of a 90s staple, the one-hour photo booth. Did I nail it or DID I NAIL IT?!?

Back to the important stuffs, The Goodwich is a unique sandwich oasis in the desert. I went with the thought that this can't be justified by the hype. Eh! Wrong. So wrong! 

The take something seemingly so basic (sandwich bread and add a touch of class with making the interior components of a higher calibre sandwich. They're out of the league of Subway and Capriotti's. They're borderline gourmet.

I've had the Cuban, the sinfully sweet Flutter Nutrer, the Porkie, the Reuben. It's all so tasty and have complex flavor profiles. The house made pickles also the dankness. Spicy and sweet. Definitely a must try if you're a pickle fan like me.

Also stepping up their legit game-ness, they sell upgraded colas. I'm such a sucker for speciality sodas. A few flavors of Izze and a few other brands are offered. Again, kicking it up a notch. 

You can call/text your orders ahead. On a hot summer's day, waiting in the 110° heat on top of black pavement can be brutal. Remember that and tip these dudes! Big fan!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I was not expecting a taste bud grenade thrown into my mouth on the first bite. Probably one the best and well put sandwiches  I've had. Customer service was a 10/10. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"Love love love this place!! Their sandwiches are so incredibly good that I literally ate here probably 3 days in a row! The customer service is always great and delivery is incredibly fast!!"}
{"text":"If you've not noticed by now, I am a customer service person all the way. The Goodwhich blows me away with theirs!! 
The owners, Jake and Josh, have created this high quality, fine dining sandwich restaurant, with incredibly affordable food. Downtown, in front of Dino's in a booth. It's sandwiches but they're \"stacked rite\" which means QUALITY. Josh is a genious when it comes to creating the best ingredients and combinations, that turn a sandwich into a SANDWICH BABY! The prices are great, starting at $3! 
Their staff is also just magnificent! Will is the really cute guy out front. But he really seems as though he's a top class server, and remarkable at customer service. He knows the menu, and you can just tell he's passionate about the company. Pat and Sam make the food up to par with Jake and Josh. Which is no easy task, to say the least. I'm a Goodwhich follower and proud. You should be one too! 

Great stuff Goodwhich. 
I hope you do great things gentlemen!!"}
{"text":"Excellent food with a unique twist on Mexican fare. Very creative options and welcoming staff that allowed samples and provided recommendations. No boring sandwiches here. Beer on tap is coming and would make it 5 stars."}
{"text":"The service was super kind and fun, but what really gets the place five stars is that the chef made me a vegetarian version of the chorizo and it was absolutely incredible."}
{"text":"I love this place I have been going here for several months now .Very friendly I am always greeted when I walk in the door .Always Fresh sandwiches"}
{"text":"This is my go to lunch place. I haven't had much on the menu but their Grilled Cheese (white bread & cheddar cheese) is the BOMB! 
My coworker gets the B.L.T & she loves it. Friendly staff & they know us as regulars now."}
{"text":"Drinking at Velveteen Rabbit can stroke up an appetite. Good thing Goodwich is only a few minutes away. Sometimes a sandwich just hits the spot. Even more so when it is a well crafted sandwich. 

Who thinks of doing a curry cauliflower sandwich with crispy rich and an onion fondue? How about a pulled squash with pepitas and sauteed collard greens? It is impressive when a place can cater to vegetarians and carnivores alike. The Goodwich is definitely a place that makes eating vegetables enjoyable. Besides our green friends, the Rueben-ish with the fennel kraut and the Cuban-esque are great sandwiches. There are few places were I feel like I have to give everything a try. For the prices, it is not too rough on the pocketbook either. All sandwiches range from $3-$9."}
{"text":"As a newbie to Vegas, one thing that has frustrated me to no end is the distinct lack of great, creative, local sandwich shops. Sandwiches are few and far between. But now...rejoice! This tiny little stand has arrived and clearly takes the title for best sandwich shop in Vegas.

Good sandwich shops usually pride themselves on bigger, larger more monstrous sandwiches with endless meat combinations. Not this one. These sandwiches are well portioned, affordable and will only set you back a few bucks. Even the simple $3 sandwiches (like the fried egg) are glorious, but as you go up the menu, the quality and creativity only grow, and even the most expensive sandwiches are only $9 (for sandwiches with Foie Gras or Truffles!).  Even the vegetarian Falafel sandwich is awesome.

If you live in Vegas and you like sandwiches...go here."}
{"text":"Wow! These sandwiches are AWESOME!! I was at the Millennium Fandom Bar next door and we walked over to order food from here (you can also place your order online and they'll bring it over). The cashier was super knowledgeable about the menu and very helpful. He informed us that everything is made in-house, right down to their sauces and spreads. I went with the Choke Heart Sandwich which was artichoke spread with spinach, a few more things I can't remember, and I added chicken. Omg was it amazing!! I also had a bite of a friend's Ruben which was also very good. We wanted dessert and all they had were 3 fruit pies and a lemon cake, so we settled on a pear pie. It was pretty good but nothing that special. I really wish they had some kind of chocolate cake, would have definitely preferred that. The prices are a bit high but not completely out of control. All in all I really enjoyed my sandwich and would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"The BEST Reuben Sandwich I ever had!!! I love the sauce, the meat, the sour kraut, I love it all!!!! Too good for words.  I couldn't even decide which sandwich I wanted off the menu, they had such good choices!!!"}
{"text":"5 star sandwiches and service. Great prices, fast and efficient dining that isn't McDonald's or some other crappy chain. T-shirts are available to buy from there which my husband did. Always clean, food is fresh. Location was somewhat hard to find as we are tourists to the area."}
{"text":"So rude for a place with nowhere to sit. I asked if they could make a egg white sandwich instead of regular egg... They're response \"No it's too much for us to have to separate the egg. If you want something healthy eat the carrot sandwich\" really? Cause I don't make sandwiches for a living and even I could separate an egg to make a sandwich. So pathetic.  Perfect example of people who get good yelp reviews and feel like they're unstoppable. I should've known, most of their 5 star reviews are from people with 3-5 reviews."}
{"text":"This place is very small and seating is limited. I believe there was only 1 or 2 vegetarian options. I had the street corn sandwich and it was amazing. Definitely worth a shot."}
{"text":"A dope ass sandwhich stand in the corner of a parking lot a little bit north of Stratosphere. Started by two down to earth, hard working dudes with experience working at some of the top restaurants on the strip; you can taste the love and passion that they put in their food and menu. This is the type of place where you know good food comes out of. Goodwich reminds me of something you would find in any foodie city and stands out with its eclectic ever changing unique menu. 

The 3 sandwiches I ate were the Pate, PBB&J, and Fried Egg

Damn I wish I had pictures of the 3 sandwiches I just ate but they were gone in a second.

Pate: Bomb.com...not for everyone as patte can be strange to some (mystery meat but usually cow, duck, geese, or chicken parts with fat and herbs & spices)...has a lot of flavor and is very refreshing...very herby with some tang...

PBB&J: Stands for peanut butter, bacon & jelly sandwich....surprisingly it works f'n well...similar to how that peanut butter crunch burger at 1842 is...

Fried Egg: Probably the most basic sounding sandwhich on the menu however you have to try the simple sounding food in order to gauge the quality of  work...this reminds me of some ish my mom would make and mom's are usually your favorite cooks as your growing up...it was done well..wish the egg was dobe over easy as the yolk gushing out would have been crack..

Overall this place is one of my new favorite food destinations. With an ever changing menu and a great price point this place has the potential to be a staple in the new Las Vegas culture."}
{"text":"Redefines the word \"sandwich\" for me. I have started ordering 5 at a time because I can't eat less than 2 immediately, and I get hungry really fast when these things are within arms reach. 

Don't forget to buy a fluff & nut for dessert because, holy omg wow"}
{"text":"Pocas veces pude probar menús como este, por lo general no soy tan fanático de comida como las de la carta, me han dejado de pie y aplaudiendo. Gracias."}
{"text":"Small store, but the sandwiches pack a punch. The staff was very friendly, I love how they genuinely asked how everything was at the end. 
You can't go wrong with any sandwich honestly. 
Just a little over priced would be my one and ONLY complain."}
{"text":"This place is great! I went here with a good friend, she and I had never been but had heard some good stuff about it and honestly it lives up to its expectations! I ordered their most popular thing on the menu named the \"PATTY\" and it was amazing . They don't actually have fries or ranch (which I love) however  they do give you the option of several sides and I chose the chips with a vinegar seasoning . The taste was great, the bread was amazing and the  beef had such a great taste. I loved this place and would deff go back if I'm downtown. Love the location very clean and everyone was great. The wait time was not long, about 10 min. I enjoyed my food in their outside seating area."}
{"text":"I saw some pictures of this place on instagram and decided to stop by on the weekend with a friend. We got a little lost looking for the place but you just have to look carefully for the sign. Try to get street parking if you can! We were greeted immediately when we walked in. To the left you'll see an open kitchen and to the right are tables. I stared at the menu for the little while, looking a little lost, so the cashier gave me a brief summary about each sandwich which was pretty helpful.

We decided to go with The Patty and Sea Smoked.
The sandwiches were a bit too oily for me which sort of gave me a stomach afterwards. The flavors were good but I had expected a little more. The Patty was quite heavy and made us full really quick - I wish there was more color added to it, like some sort of veggies.


Also, their drinks are right behind the register! I hope I'm not the only one who was confused about where the drinks were. The employees were very friendly and checked up on us to see how everything was.

I saw something about their \"secret menu\" on Instagram, so I'll come back another time to give that a try!"}

The Goodwich is located just outside of Dino's Lounge, and the food there is just another example of \"Sandwich Joy\", a rare place to visit, but the reception is wonderful.

The Missus and I went there for an afternoon outing, and while I can't remember what she got, the pate sandwich that I discovered was so rich and flavorful....  It was beyond good.

Best of all, Dino's allows people to sit at their bar and eat, so I brought in my food, ordered a beer, and just spent a blissful moment munching contentedly at this latest of finds.  Again, for what you get, the value is excellent.

I've become convinced that Vegas might be one of the \"Great Sandwich Capitals of America\".  There are enough excellent sandwich places here to placate all of my \"various foodstuffs between two pieces of bread\" needs.

Truly and highly recommended.  I wish this little business all the best of luck, because they have earned it.  And my repeat business."}
{"text":"Both the Patty and Reuben-ish are fantastic.  The wait is sometimes a little long but it's worth it since they make everything to order.  The sea salt and pepper chips are good, too."}
{"text":"BRICK AND MORTAR LOCATION... WOOT WOOT!

When I heard that Goodwich upgraded location was open I fell out of my chair... Okay more like stumbled. They are just that good. I was not a sandwich girl until this place, and now I can eat one of their sandwich without sides. Complete satisfaction from a sandwich... who knew? I have been a customer since the days of it being across the OG. And the sandwiches are still as good as they were back then. 
The new location adds the one thing I think many would agree needed... Air Conditioning! In all seriousness, the new space is amazing. Fun decor and plenty of seats. I salute you GOODWICH!!!"}
{"text":"Incredible!!! Just ate here and tried a variety of the sandwiches with my family.  The Reuben-ish is phenomenal.  Kids loved the housemade bacon!!  Sea smoke was incredibly flavorful.  Chix fix holy moly!!!  Nothing short of amazing.  Can't wait to come back!!!"}
{"text":"This place came recommended by the resident foodie at the Neon Museum. We told her we were looking for a sandwich shop, and she immediately got enthusiastic while telling us how awesome this place is. We ordered a BTLG (+fried chicken skins) and a Chix Fix sandwich, as well as an order of jalapeno sour cream chips. The sandwiches were very good! These are not your typical sandwiches, and not something I'd dare to make on my own because I know they would never turn out as good! The chips were just OK and quite pricey for the amount you get, so I would pass on them next time."}
{"text":"I can't stay away. Everything I have ever had here is amazing. They even have free bicycle delivery for downtown!"}
{"text":"This is more of a four and a half star rating than a solid four stars. I've been here quite a few times and tried many of the items on the menu. The quality of the food is solid and the service is great. The sandwiches are decently sized, but a little on the pricey side.  They are a couple of bucks less during happy hour, which is from 4-6 pm for dine-in only. The location doesn't have a bathroom. You have to walk over to the lofts right next door and use their lobby bathroom. You can usually find free parking on the street as well. Overall, pretty good food and service with prices somewhat on the higher side."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this spot forever and it was well worth the wait. The guys working this sandwich stand are super friendly, and the service is pretty fast considering they're whipping up some pretty fancy sandwiches. I had a bacon and cheesy grits sandwich with a tomato spread on rye that was mind blowing. When you take a bite literally explodes flavor into your mouth. I can't wait to come back and try everything else!"}
{"text":"omg, omg, omg, omg...yes, it really is this good here. Love the curbside location just behind the Strat tower...on the corner. The tastiest, hippest, coolest sandwich combos in the Valley, you cannot go wrong here. For my initial test, just to throw them a curve ball, I ordered a Radish Sandwich. Yes, you heard right! Okay, some a-youse are going ewww already! But man oh man, who knew that a frekkin' radish sandwich could be so scrumptious??? The Goodwich guys know something good and they are sharing it with fellow Vegans.....and Meaters too! There's something for every picky eater here for sure. I am excited to try the other items now! When the sun goes down in the high desert valley, I'll be heading to quell those hunger pangs at The Goodwich!"}
{"text":"I came here off of the word of many friends saying this was a great sandwhich joint. Immediately the staff was helpful and nice! I didn't know where I could park, and they told me where I could. When I came in, they greeted me, and asked if I had ever been there before, when I didn't the cashier smiled and gave me the low down on everything. Being as hungry as I was, I asked her for her personal favorite Sandwich and she pointed me in the right direction. THE SANDWICH WAS AMAZING, I must of gulped the whole thing down in seconds, and caught myself licking my fingers too (which I never do! lol). The staff was amazingly helpful, knowledgeable, friendly and fun. The decorations/design of the place is really nice. I ordered more sandwiches to go for later at home to enjoy. :)"}
{"text":"The best Reuben sandwich you'll ever have! Bread and butter pickles are fantastic!  Healthy homemade, everything! Daughter had a falafel sandwich on marbled rye, she says \"spectacular\"!"}
{"text":"Who would have thought we could find a gem in a little shack outside a dive bar, let alone a second one after the first moved to a storefront.  Well I am happy to say the Goodwich exceeds its predecessor at the location with a cutting edge menu and owners/staff who clearly enjoy their work.  Try the \"le pig\" sandwich, or the chicken provolone sandwich, both are excellent. I also really enjoy their \"patty\" which has just enough kick to make you happy inside.  I haven't tried their foie gras sandwich, mainly because they had served it all when I got there but it is next on my list.

The menu itself is pretty interesting as the number next to the menu item is the price, ranging from $3.00 to $9:00, all very reasonable.  The bread they use is excellent for sandwiches.

Don't be afraid to try their creative offerings as you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Service was friendly and quick and the sandwich was excellent. They have a changing menu so check before you go so you're not let down if they took the sandwich you like off the menu but otherwise they have my business."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches were the bomb.   El pig and sea smoke 2.0 are the sandwichs that I munched on.  Am staying at one downtown casinos so they deliver for free!  It was fast service and driver was friendly.  Check them out."}
{"text":"The Reuben is phenomenal. Rough chopped corned beef, the right amount of kraut, cheese and dressing. Get it in marble rye, toasted and you will be back again and again.
Also the nicest people ever, such a positive experience. Got the curry chips on the side, also delicious."}

{"text":"This little intersection is becoming quite the place to be.  I really think it all started with the OG.  Then, everyone followed:  the lounge, the arepas place, the gelato place, and now this sandwich stand right on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd. and Wyoming.  The Goodwich just opened so it's brand-spanking new, but word travels fast in our little town about everything and everyone, so I wanted to try this place out after hearing, yes, good things about it.  The menu is simple, with sandwiches that start from $3 (grilled cheese, fried egg) and go up to $9 (foie gras, pork belly).  Your bread choices are white, wheat, or rye, there are add-ons available for an extra charge (bacon, cheese, fried egg, foie gras, CRISPY CHICKEN SKIN) and you can \"Monte Cristo\" your sandwich for only $.50; that is, the sandwich is dipped in egg batter and then placed on the grill. 
Still kind of full from a late breakfast, I kept things simple with the grilled cheese on rye done Monte Cristo style since I've never had a sandwich prepared that way. With a bottle of water, my order came to a cheap $4.86.   Jake, the personable co-owner who looks just like Clark Kent, took our orders while his business partner manned the kitchen inside the stand.  I was there with a group of Yelp friends and as we waited for our orders on the corner in the sun, I noticed that there is quite a lot of foot traffic in that area.  There are several seats and business was brisk for a new place.  Our orders came out shortly and everyone loved their Goodwiches.  
I usually visit the gelato place every Friday afternoon for my fix with friends; I think the Friday Food crew has found a perfect complement in the Goodwich.  Welcome to the neighborhood, guys."}
{"text":"Sandwiches normally don't make my lunch wishlist, however, I thought I should try The Goodwich for variety's sake.  I'm glad I did--my sandwich was delicious.  Others sandwiches being carried by my table also looked quite appetizing.

There was a glitch with my order but they made it right--kudos to the team.  It's often hard to judge the level of customer service when things as planned.  Knowing how a cafe will address an issue when it drops the ball is important because, in my experience, about 1/3rd of the places will leave the customer assuming the risk.  Not this spot.

Great food and great service, excellent find. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. I looked up good local eats in Las Vegas and this popped up. Definitely love this place! Especially for the price and the quality of sandwiches. We tried the Reuben-ish and the chicken sandwiches. They were delicious! This is my go to spot for sandwiches now! :)"}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome! 

I will never get tired of their falafel sandwhich. But THIS time I added chicharrón to it!! 

Definitely have to try it if your a pork eater. 

The hell or high watermelon definitely was a good accompaniment to it."}
{"text":"*sigh*

I wanted this place to be good. I've heard the reviews and testimony from other colleagues who have experienced \"the Goodwich.\" Alas, it was not to be.

First, the location is something to be desired. I decided to wait for my meal in my car so I wouldn't be accosted while waiting. Seriously.

Second, ordering was a mess. I wanted something on the side and it was like pulling teeth for them to place it, a sauce, on the side. In the end, they forgot to even give it to me so I could try it!

Third: the sandwiches are bland. I could make a better grilled cheese with craft singles. The chicken sandwich had more flavor, but again, I didn't get to try the sauce because after asking for it on the side, I never even received it. The beef was better, but was the equivalent of a Philly cheese steak from Burger King, and was swimming in grease. I had to use four napkins to soak it all up...

I won't be back. I didn't appreciate this place, although I do have to give them props for generous, thick, Texas toast-style bread."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place ever since they were a little food stand on Las Vegas blvd. my fave was the Le pig bc of the chicharron but I didn't see it on the menu, so I got the street corn sand which and added fried chicken to it. It was really good a little different from what I know street corn to be but it was still yummy. I also got the potato salad street corn style although it had a weird taste like I couldn't figure out the flavor it was hard to stop eating. I love this place and drive clear across town to enjoy their sandwiches! I highly recommend"}
{"text":"How did I not know about or come to the place sooner?
Loved, loved, loved the food so many flavor profiles and choices. super clean prestige environment huge Jerry Misko mural on the wall - beyond friendly staff, very accommodating. Had the insanely flavorful El Pollo Cuervo sandwich with a side of potato salad with kimchi and daikon, scallion, sweet onion (yummm) - finished the meal with fluff and nut.. back off this one it is a sweet treat that is a meal in itself soooooooo good.

Looking forward to the return!"}
{"text":"As of right now, best sandwich shop in the city, however there's really no where to sit and chill and f*ck it's hot out there waiting for a sandwhich, but the customer service is second to none and I will gladly endure a little back sweat for their BLT with cheese grits sammich!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and friendly staff. I had their pig of the week sandwich, the 808, and my friend split his chive turkey so we got to try two different sandwiches. Both were phenomenal. I love the chive ricotta spread in the chive turkey. We also paired it with the curry vinegar chips then had their Nutella fluff dessert which pretty much exceeded all my expectations and writing about it now is making me crave it."}
{"text":"So glad this place is finally open!  I've been a long time fan of the stand and this opening was well worth the wait. 

There's a lot of additions including an expanded menu, a happy hour with craft brews on tap (coming soon), and delivery service with a mobile app. 

The space looks great and I have a feeling it's only going to get better."}
{"text":"The location was a bit off setting but once inside the decor was very modern. The customer service was excellent upon walking in from being greeted to asking if we had any questions about the Menu, which we did. The gentlemen at the register was very helpful and was great with recommendations. We ordered the Ruben and the patty melt added bacon and an egg to the patty melt, we ordered the corn slaw and the jalapeno sour cream chips.We felt the food was made with Love. The food was very flavorful and was not lacking at all.  We made an Excellent choice by giving The Goodwich a shot. We recommend this spot for anyone who is in the area and looking to an inexpensive place to eat with great food! Will be back soon...who knows maybe tonight lol:-)"}
{"text":"Best sandwich I've ever had!! At first I was a little skeptical of their location but also reminded myself some of the best food I've tried have been out of a street food stand or a food truck.  Both my boyfriend and I pretty much got a custom order with extras like jalapeños added and both sandwiches were delicious!! The sandwiches themselves are very well prepared and a good amount of size to fill you up. The staff was friendly and the cost for the both of us was under 20$ including drinks. We're definitely coming back and hopefully trying the fluff and nut sandwich we've seen in their reviews."}
{"text":"My go to spot for a delicious sandwich, but sometimes I just pass by to grab a slice of pie! The homemade pies are some of the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Damn good sandwich! I Totally satisfied
Definitely I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place has excellent food. It's a little different they add their own spin to their sandwiched which is exciting to switch it up a bit. They are really nice and have great customer service! The Ruben-ish is awesome, I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"The food is delicious here, but what really makes this place special is the Customer Service! I believe the cashier name was Will,  I only been here once before which was 3 weeks ago and the Cashier remembered my name! The Cashier at my corner store doesn't even know my name and I been filling my gas tank with her for the last year lol. The rest of the staff is very friendly and you are acknowledge by everyone once you arrive due to having the open kitchen. Keep up the great customer service! Le Pig was delicious!"}
{"text":"The Goodwhich name is an understatement.  Should b called \"the extraordinary GREATwhich!!\"   We got a patty melt and grilled cheese, so darn good!!   The bald white guy who works there is awesome and the overall quality is phenomenal. Great job, so glad we stopped here!"}
{"text":"I was in SoHo highrise checking on a property I manage there.  I stopped into The Goodwich to try them out.  What a blessing and a curse that was.  The sandwich was one of the best I have had!  Staff was nice, offered me a water, and a seat.  The only downside to my visit was that now I have to drive back downtown to get another sandwich!  Hope to see you guys in the Southwest valley soon!"}
{"text":"We're spoiled with options in this city. I've eaten restaurant food pretty much daily since moving to LV 2+ years ago and no business has gotten more repeat visits from me than the Goodwich. They don't need any more glowing reviews, although I feel obligated to make them my first published yelp review after years of lurking. 

Will has been the man since my first trip to the kiosk in Dino's parking lot. Not only does he break off knowledge about everything in the menu, he is a true foodie that will give you great suggestions for any culinary delights you seek in town. 

Since moving to the brick and mortar, I've seen the owners more often. These guys are world class entrepreneurs that find time to visit with the guests and are open to feedback. 

Food review portion, pretty sure I've eaten everything but here's an overview:

- Patty - my go to sandwich. I throw chopped bacon and mustard on it and get a side of dill pickles for a perfect meal. 
- Reubenish - any Reuben lover out there will appreciate this thing. 
- PBB&JJ - so cheap yet so fulfilling. They mix up the flavor of jam all the time. Get this on white. 
- Bratloaf - greatest sandwich of all time. It has yet to make an appearance at the brick and mortar. 

Thanks for everything, Goodwich!"}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for a pre-dinner snack after his long flight. I wasn't hungry, so I didn't order anything, but I ended up eating half his sandwich. Oops! Rude, I know, but after taking one bite of the cuban-esque, I needed more! This might just be the best sandwich I've ever had. The combo of the pork butt and belly with the ham, swiss and maystard is a must try. I'm normally not a big rye bread fan, but it pairs perfectly with the contents of this sandwich. 

I was here once before, and while I enjoyed it, I wasn't blown away like I was on my 2nd visit. The first time I had the foie sandwich - it was very flavorful, but it was pretty heavy to have on a whole sandwich. I also tried the patty, and the cream cheese was a nice touch, making it super a creamy, gooey topping for the meat. 

I'll be back to this little shack soon because that cuban-esque is calling my name! Hopefully they keep this one on the menu for a while, because I noticed they switched up the menu from the last time I was here."}
{"text":"I came here after seeing the cheese bomb on an Instagram feed. My husband had the cheese bomb and I had the Ruben sandwich. Both of the sandwiches were delicious. I think my favorite thing about the meal was how perfect the bread was toasted. The staff was friend and we found a spot in the 3 hour free parking easily on a Friday lunch time. The only thing I didn't care for were the sides. We got a side of dill pickles and a side of pasta salad. The pasta salad was just OK but I did not like the pickles at all. It was $2 so not bad BUT super small and they are sliced extremely thin. I think of sour when I think of dill but it was super sweet. I am a huge pickle fan and normally a small side of pickles is complimentary, so I was bummed about paying and hating them. I would absolutely come back and skip the sides."}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST sandwich shop I've ever been to! 
We drove out of our way to stop here on our way through town and it was totally worth it!! 

We ordered the grilled cheese,  egg salad,  Patty,  Reuben'ish and the Cold Brown.  We also had to tried the sides : b&b pickles,  jalapeño chips and the beets. 
Everything was killer,  like crazy good."}
{"text":"It seems I only write 5-star reviews, but the truth is I just prefer good food so I frequent the 5-star joints! My Dinner Downtown group had lunch here yesterday, and all 7 of us LOVED it! My Cubanesque was incredibly good. It was hard to watch others enjoying one of my favorites - the Roasted Cauliflower with Crispy Chicken Skins - but the sandwiches are so filling that I can't eat 2."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was amazing. Sandwiches have great flavor and the staff was very polite and attentive."}
{"text":"Tried their three different sandwiches and they are all great and delicious! Just remeber to pick up the food and leave. There is no way you can eat on the street or parking lots ( trust me... I tried already) you will know what im talking about when you are actually there ;)"}
{"text":"I have a soft spot for sandies.  I've been to most of the well known spots in LAS (Capriotti's, Earl's, etc), but this may be the best one so far.  What distinguishes Goodwich from other places is that they're so creative.  Grits in a BLT?  A cold hot brown?  I lurv how they're thinking!

I really, really should've just ordered one sandie to share with my husband.  We JUST had dinner.  But he doesn't eat pork (He makes up in our marriage in other ways;), and I really wanted to try the BLTG.  So I got that one, and my love got the sea smoke.

BLTG:  Never would I think to add grits to a sandie.  But make it bacon grits, and you've got the best worst-for-you sandie sauce ever.  I think that there might even be mayo...are they crazy?  The final composition was a little saucy for a sandie, but still very good.  7.5/10

Sea Smoked- Someone should tell me if this is anything like the whitefish salad in Jewish delis.  Never had it, but this is what I imagine it to taste, but smokey.  My hubs said that it was the best he's had.  The guy behind the counter rec'd it on rye.  Turns out that was very good advice.  8/10

I need to come back and try other menu items like the cold brown (highly rec'd by an employee).  Plus, the ppl here are very down to earth.  Thanks Yelpers for helping me find Goodwich!"}
{"text":"Every bite really is better than the last.

This food truck born, turned brick and mortar sandwich spot is one of my favorites. A few staples with a seasonal rotation of fresh bites, they make sandwiches that I won't say no to. The service is always top-notch. My recent visit even had me being served by one of the partners for this business. I love that. 

The storefront is tucked away off the hustle and bustle of downtown, but people find their way. I always manage to beat the crowds when I come, (lucky me) but I know my luck won't last. They always draw a crowd. 

The Reuben-ish is my tried and true favorite. I love the Egg-salad and most recently the RU Chicken. I'm blown away by how they squeeze so much flavor between two slices of bread. 

Their sides are a bit pricey, especially for the size, so that's the only thing I won't stand behind. That's okay though, I came for the sandwiches."}
{"text":"I bought 2 sandwiches, 
The \"Tomato\" with Jalapeños, Avo, Fried Egg & Chicken added
And The \"Street Corn\" with Avo & Chicken added
With 2 small izze drinks adding up to $28 !
The chicken didn't impress me either, for that price I'd expect a slice of roasted chicken or at least shredded and seasoned.
I suppose it wasn't a bad spot to visit and try. It really wasn't bad, just decent food but not worth what I paid."}
{"text":"Always one of my favorite go-to spots. always spot on with creativity & flavors. Besides who doesn't like a scrumptious sandwich in their life. If you have never been here I would suggest drop what ever your doing & go now."}
{"text":"Love this sandwich shop.  Love the hipster vibe. I am not a real sandwich person but I will eat a sandwich from here. They were nice enough to go off menu and make me something that I really liked. Great customer service every time. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"I really love the Goodwich. Great sandwiches, great prices, incredibly friendly employees! Every sandwich I've tried is amazing, not a bad one on the menu. 
There's definitely something for everyone here, and if you're vegetarian you have options other than grilled cheese! 
I wish I could eat here everyday for lunch, but then none of my clothes would fit me lol."}
{"text":"It is rare that I end up checking out a place twice before writing my first review. Well, after my first visit to The Goodwich I just couldn't resist coming back for more just two days later.

I came for lunch with some of my favorite Yelpers, one of whom is already a regular here. I shared a le pig and a foie sandwich the first time around. The sandwiches came out quickly and we settled down to eat. It was a windy afternoon and our food blew all over the place. Lesson learned for next time, if it's windy we will be taking our grub into Dino's or to go to save us the stress. There was one foie casualty during our meal, but The Goodwich guys were on top of it and a replacement sandwich was ready in no time.  The food was amazing. I'm usually 50/50 on foie gras. Sometimes I enjoy and sometimes I don't. Both sandwiches were great. The foie had a nice sweetness and crunch that definitely improved the taste and texture, taking the sandwich to a whole new level. The le pig was delicious as well. Perfectly cooked and really tasty. It was a close tie, so it's too hard for me to pick a favorite. 

Two days later, I came by with my mom to share the fluff and nutt Monte cristo style. I had heard so many good things I just couldn't resist. I actually don't normally enjoy marshmallow or Nutella but it was a nice combination with the added crunchies, making the texture very nice. There was a long line but it went quickly.

The guys who run this place are just great. They make everyone feel very welcome and are so hospitable and accommodating, it's hard not to root for them. Luckily they make a pretty darn good product on top of that so I will be back again really soon. 

Make sure to text or call to make sure they are there before you go. Even better, text your order in like we did so it's ready when you get there."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I did not actually go here, but my man brought me back a sandwich when HE went. He brought me \"Le Pig\" - anything with pork belly is really a winner in my book. So how can I rate it if I haven't actually been here?

+1 for a fantastic name that gave me a chuckle
+1 for presentation. My sandwich was wrapped so neatly and obviously with care. I imagine if they put this much effort into how a sandwich is wrapped, they must also have good customer service
+1 for a delicious sandwich that reheated fantastically in the toaster oven
+1 for benefit of the doubt.

Hopefully I will be able to go in person soon and give a more thorough review!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Great seasonal pics and delicious you're around options. Try the falafel!"}
{"text":"If you want the best salad on earth make sure you try their Cobbish Salad. It seriously is the best salad on earth! I come here often and no matter how busy it is they are always quick to make your food and do it with a smile on their face I love this spot I wish there was one closer to my house I would be there everyday!"}
{"text":"Always great sandwiches with even better service. Best thing is that they now have a brick & mortar location with AC and seating! Great for a quick meal on the way to go shopping at the outlets!"}
{"text":"Never a disappointment! I've been eating here since they their prior location. Delivery is always quick and easy."}
