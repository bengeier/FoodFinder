{"text":"Often go here for the DrivThru when I've had a long, hard day at work! The thought of a MacDonalds is usually better than the having of it I feel!


 Is it just me or how often have other people trying to get a quick hamburger meal to bring home get told, If you wouldn't mind taking a space in the waiting bay please! So, of course, you park up and you wait.and wait.. and wait!!!! DrivThu mean fast food does it not? Maybe I AM just becoming a grumpy auld git!


 However, staff are young, harassed, underpaid and generally, despite it all, quite funny! They can be pleasant and good natured too!


 I always enjoy the first few mouthfuls and then say to myself, Why did you get a MacDonalds? I just know I'll keep doing it too!


 But hey! I did used to absolutely love the BIG TASTY meal! Bring it back! Why do they have to stop doing the good ones?


 Thank you MacDonalds for when I can't be bothered!"}
{"text":"Needs lots of upgrades. Not as nice as other modern locations.  Service is OK. Place is small. But I prefer the locations that have all the new modern upgrades built in."}
{"text":"Fast food, service is something to be desired. Car park can be a little crazy - drive thru is a no go!!"}
{"text":"I agree with the above poster with regards to the Drive Thru in Airdrie. You are always told to wait in that parking bay which does go against the idea of fast food. I go to Macdonalds to eat a burger and fries in about 10 minutes flat and be on may way again not hang about waiting 10 minutes for it to be cooked. Food is okay though and branch is clean enough. Staff are nice enough in Airdrie branch as some of Macdonalds staff in other branches are shocking. Macdonalds food is quite addictive though and although you know it is bad for you, sometimes it is the only thing that will do. As I am typing this I have realised that I really need a Sausage and Egg Mcmuffin!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the most inefficient McDonalds I have ever been to.   The Manager Mike was chirping out orders to all his little minions.  Mike -- the level of stress you operate at -- you're going to give yourself a heart attack.  Deep breaths.  Bottom of the pot coffee too.    I probably will not return next time I have a craving."}
{"text":"Hard for me to rate as I'm a vegetarian...but we took a friends kid here and fed him while we had a shake.  Good service, play area and very clean."}
