I managed to finally make it to the last day of the fried chicken pop up shop by Chef Brandon Olsen. 

Brando's Fried Chicken is a two-week pop up shop project, formerly an Ali Baba's shawarma shop. There are absolutely no seats inside at all. I decided to take my food home. I told Chef Brandon this and he put an extra bag in and remind me to not eat and drive. Wise words because I totally would have.

The chicken was batter and fried right in front of me then lightly dashed with a bit of salt. A 2-piece order came to $7 and is served with a buttermilk garlic sauce and hot sauce. You can also make it a combo with slaw and a drink for $10. Or have the fried chicken on a bun served with slaw for $5.

I ordered 2 orders of the 2-piece and a side of slaw ($3). All four pieces of chicken were about the same size and it was crispy, juicy and tender (as fried chicken should be). The sauces were perfect. The slaw was crunchy, tangy and just awesome. 

My mum said I should have just got one order, but that's just crazy talk. I really hope Chef Brandon does open a fried chicken shop for realsies because as much as I just went for 1.5hr drive (there and back) for his fried chicken. I'd gladly do that again."}
{"text":"Incredible fried chicken. Perfectly breaded, crunchy, crispy, juicy, hot, delectable, finger licking fried chicken. We shared a 2 piece fried chicken ($7) and a fried chicken on a bun ($5). Maybe it was because my sweet kiddo was so enthusiastic (\"FRIED CHICKEN IS MY FAVORITE FOOD!!\"), but they threw in an extra piece of chicken and some side slaws as well. The chicken comes with perfect hot sauce and INCREDIBLE tangy buttermilk dipping sauce. The sandwich pairs the fried chicken with slaw, hot sauce, and buttermilk sauce all on a good squishy bun. Slaw is both creamy and vinegary yum. All said, this is a tremendous value for the cost, and sooooo dammmmnnnn tasty. This is a pop-up in a defunct schwarma shop, so counter service only, no place to eat. Service by Chef Brandon and co was efficient and cheerful. Get over there before Nov 28 - open til 3am Fri and Sat. Rumour has it this pop-up will be resurrected as a full-time joint, at this same location, in early 2016. Yum."}
