{"text":"WoW! the grilled calamari was out of this world.  I felt rather special here, the owner was super nice.  Had dinner there after a rough day at work and came out emotionally better and the meal was more than perfect.  I guess the friendly atmosphere and the food make me want to go for more."}
{"text":"This place is terrible compared to EVERY place around it!  We made a huge mistake by stopping our car right when we saw this Greek place, and didn't enjoy it at all..only to then drive down one more block and hit the REAL Greek food....PLEASE don't make our mistake.  IF YOU WANT THE BEST GYROS PITA go to Messini....it was the best we could find....and we tried many."}
{"text":"We've never actually eaten in Asteria but it's our go-to restaurant for Greek takeout. The restaurant is family run with a down-to-earth, unpretentious atmosphere and while the presentation and selection of food isn't as fancy as some other Greek restaurants, the portions are generous, perfectly cooked (never too dry or greasy) and delicious! Souvlaki with rice, potatoes and Greek salad is the classic dish, but the gyros is amazing as well."}
{"text":"Charming little old fashioned restaurant.  Delicious food.  good price. Friendly faces and good service."}
{"text":"Best souvlaki on the Danforth, HANDS DOWN. You can't beat this ridiculously delicious meat that is always juicy and spiced to perfection. 

Asteria is the best place to go for a no-fuss meal that is super yummy. The place is family-run and there's nothing fancy about the d√©cor or the menu, but they sure do know their Greek food. You can have your basic souvlaki (chicken or lamb) or gyro on a pita (with tomatoes, onions, and tons of tzatiki, of course!), or if you're feeling hungrier, go for the full meal which adds a Greek salad, potatoes, and rice alongside your choice of meat. I should note, too, that I'm very picky about my Greek salads (particularly the dressing) but Asteria gets this just right, also.

There are vegetarian options at Asteria, as well (I've heard that the moussaka is good!), but personally I've never tried any of them because I find it way too hard to stray from my beloved chicken souvlaki! The prices are very reasonable, and I always get a full meal's worth of leftovers when I get the dinner meal (and although I'm not a very big eater, you'll likely have at least some leftovers, too)."}
{"text":"Great Food and service.  Lost of new upgrades with new paint, floors and tiles. I try to eat here once or twice a month."}
{"text":"So just an update on my previous review-we have continued to get take-out from here because it is so close and have no time to sit down to eat. I wouldn't sit there anyway because it is always so drab and dark.
 I wont be going there anymore though because the owner (or who I think is the owner ) has charged me 3 different prices for chicken souvlaki. More expensive each time. She charged my husband less when he went to pick up the food. :/ funny but not"}
{"text":"Best place I've tried in Greek town. Very friendly service. Delicious moussaka, potatoes, and traditional Greek salad (no lettuce, large portions). They make you feel comfortable and at home even when just getting takeout. I'm very surprised there aren't more reviews. I'll have to go back soon and get some pictures to post :)"}

{"text":"When you're on the go on the Danforth and you want something quick and absolutely tasty, Asteria's chicken souvlaki on a pita hits the spot... and then some.

Amazingly soft warm pita filled with large chunks of juicy, tender chicken souvlaki and fresh tomatoes and onions.... oh, and smothered in garlicky tzatziki. You will be licking the sauce off your fingers every time! 

The service is always great and the pops on the grill are always friendly! I make a point of getting down to the Danforth every so often specifically for Asteria."}
{"text":"This has been my go-to Greek place on the Danforth for over 10 years! The food has always been delicious and I absolutely love the home-cooked feeling of the food."}
{"text":"Easily the best Greek food on the Danforth.  Pork souvlaki is juicy and flavourable, without being too salty. Side orders of rice and potato have a nice lemony flavour. Salad is always fresh. All delivered with garlic bread. What more can you ask for just $11.50!?!?

Avoid the fancier places on this street and check out Asteria... you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"When I'm looking for Greek food on the Danforth that's quick, good and cheap (under $10), this is one of the two places I go to.

The same cast of characters is always working here and there are a lot of regulars. No complaints about the food - it's good, honest Greek food. Like I said in an earlier review for a different place, there are Greek restaurants that get lineups and tons of hype, but this place is better.

Asteria is overlooked, maybe because it's east of Pape and the tour book writers and website reviewers haven't visited yet."}
{"text":"Last night, it was FREEZING cold in the Danforth.  Because we didn't have food in the fridge (whoops), we wanted a quick, cheap meal in the neighbourhood.  Our go-to Greek restaurant has always been Mezes but because it was slippery, we wanted to go someplace closer.  We first passed by the Combine Eatery but quickly left when we saw that they charged $15 for tacos.  (WTF - seriously???  I've been all around California, Texas, and Mexico and paying $15 for tacos goes against my principles).  

We then passed by Asteria Souvlaki place.  Now, we always walked by Asteria before but didn't bother going in because the exteriors looked, well, sketchy.  We've lived in the neighbourhood for years but Asteria never really looked that appealing from the outside.  When we did go yesterday, though, we realized just how much we were missing out on.  

First of all, while there is limited food selection, they cover all the staples that you would expect in a Greek diner.  You want a dip selection?  Check.  You want fried cheese?  Check.  You want souvlakis?  Check.  

Secondly, the prices were great.  For around $11, you could have a full dinner plate, complete with main and generous sides of rice, buttery potatoes, Greek salad, and buttery bread.  Thirdly, the food was impressive.  My partner ordered the lamb chop dinner and it came not with one, not with two, but with FOUR pieces of succulent rare lamb that he practically gnawed off the bone to finish.  Taste-wise and price-wise, how can you beat that?  My calamari dinner was ok.  I actually prefer my calamari with more breading but this was tasty.  I appreciated the generous heaping of garlicky tzatzicki that came at the side.   

As for the service, it was fine.   The woman who served us that evening was nice; she checked in periodically to make sure the food was good; she refilled our water glasses on the dot; she was competent!    I personally hate it when servers talk to you with faux friendliness TGI-Fridays style.  It was also abundantly clear that this was a neighbourhood joint because the servers casually chatted to their regular customers, giving the place a nice, homey vibe.  

Will I go back?  Hell yes!  And this teaches me never to judge a restaurant by its exteriors."}
{"text":"Just a great local place. Chicken souvlaki dinner, all great, super tasty, a little pricey at about $13 but great quality food. If you are in Greektown, eat here!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite Greek restaurant in the city. Amazing food, great prices and they treat you like family. I'd give more stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Pork souvlaki had the flavor and texture of solid rubber.  Salad was a soggy mess.  How can a place like this stay in business??"}
{"text":"There's not much to this place except the food and passion.  A fast food soul place to fill your hole.  Service is nice, food is great and prices are awesome.  4 stars for simplicity, speed and great tasting food."}
{"text":"Gyro was strange, came out hard and virtually granular. Pork souvlaki fared better, but still requires a good chew. I've had meals from Greeks before so maybe my standard is as expected higher. Can't complain about service. The food just sucks."}
{"text":"If you're looking for souvlaki on the Danforth this is the best I've had for the price. Great portions, very flavourful, fresh well-dressed salad with lots of cucumber, onion, tomato and feta. Very accommodating with substitutions (all salad no rice and Potatoes, for instance). Salads are made when you order them, unlike Pappas and Pantheon.

It is not a spot with any ambiance however, so consider yourself warned. Probably hasn't been updated in 30 years. We usually get souvlaki so I can't comment on much of the rest of the menu.

Service is somewhat surly but I've come to realize the server we always have maybe a little shy.

Love Asteria!"}
{"text":"I went today, and first the waitress was sitting with 2 other people talking. I was the only customer, so she wasn't busy. She popped a menu on the table then went back to talking, a drink order first would have been nice. I got my order in, and went to the  washroom. OMG my feet stuck on the floor everywhere. They need to do a reno or close down as it's pretty grungy. I used hand sanitizer right after washing my hands. The food was mediocre, and the waitress was unloading and loading dishes as loudly as possible. She also seems to be the only waitress I have seen there, and has the personality of a fish.  I will never go back there."}
{"text":"yummylicious... chicken souvlaki on a pita - charred nicely and juicy (I always get mine with extra tzatziki as I love that garlicky sauce)...  taste: 4.5/5. price:5/5. ambiance:2/5"}
{"text":"Was in the area and needed a quick place for take out and this place looked to fit the bill. Walked in and based on the old school look I had high hopes and wasn't disappointed.  Got a great gyros on a pita - perfect ratio of meat to toppings and sauce. Very filling and delicious.  Also very quick and friendly service.  Will return next time, and probably try their souvlaki which also looks good."}
{"text":"Meh- this place is OK as far as \"fake\" gyro goes.but that's about it and I probably wouldn't order for here again. By \"fake\" gyro, I mean those frozen beefy-tasting slices that some places substitute for actual gyro made on a rotating grill. I hate when \"Greek\" food places commit to serving this atrocity, and this case was no exception. Also, this sign outside- \"fast take out;\" is rather misleading as we had to wait upwards of 30 minutes for our takeout and all we ordered were a couple of gyros. The only reason this place even gets two stars is there tzatziki- although not quite authentic, it really tasted great-pungent and slightly sour, just how I like it. Basically, this place is alright in a pinch ONLY if you don're really appreciate authentic Greek gyro!"}
{"text":"The prices in here seem quite reasonable. I would not recommend the gyros here. Their combination of lamb and pork really nauseated me, I couldn't eat anymore of it after the first bite. I told the server this and she suggested I put some hot sauce on the meat to hide the taste. This is not the kind of place where you can send back your food, and for $6.50 I didn't expect it. But I definitely will not be coming back."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend and ordered the chicken souvlaki full dinner. She ordered the pork dinner. They both came with rice, Greek salad, the souvlaki, some potatos as well as some garlic bread.

The atmosphere is really nice and cozy. You feel like you are visiting a Greek family for a home meal. I really enjoyed the surroundings. They also have a patio which I didn't use during my visit.

The souvlaki was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  The potatos were very soft and delicious! Even the rice, which I usually don't like, was nice and flavourful! 

Prices are very good!  I'll definitely come back and sample some more of their menu!"}
{"text":"We had a great meal here before going to see a show. The service was friendly and efficient, and our meals were delicious - especially the calamari and the pork dinner."}
{"text":"My first time in Greek Town was last night.  The weather was miserable, rainy, and cold.  I wanted to explore this area of town and get a uniquely Greek culinary experience, which I certainly did at Asteria.  My original plan was to go to  Mezes after reading the reviews, but walking by, it was too overcrowded for me.  
What drew me to Asteria was while walking by, I could glance into their window and see the pork and souvlaki being cooked.   Mouthwatering.

Inside is not very flashy, and the decorations are subtle, but that is fine with me.  I go to a restaurant for the food and service.  They also have a remarkably large outdoor patio that would be spectacular if the weather wasn't terrible.

The two hostesses were very attentive throughout my dinner there, and so, there is not a problem with service.  The food was also moist and mouthwatering.  You get started with a large portion of garden salad and lightly seasoned toasted bread, while you're waiting for your  main course.  I got the quail, and to be honest, that is the reason this restaurant is not getting a 5* rating.  The birds were very small and bony.  I had to struggle to get to the scarce traces of meat concealed by the dry skin and bone.  The portion of quail is large, but I think I would find more meat on two standard chicken drumsticks, than the entire serving of quail.

Let me be clear that everything else that I got was absolutely wonderful, and that if I had ordered any other entree, this place would have likely received full marks.  I will definitely be back, and I will definitely be ordering something else from the menu.  Their prices are amazing for the service, and amount and quality of food you get."}
{"text":"I didn't keep coming back because it's cheap or they have friendly service, but i kept coming back for the perfectly cooked pork pita souvlaki. The pork is always juicy with the best sauce. I have never dine in, but i was never disappointed either. I have a few pork souvlaki around the area, including the well known spots, but this place is hands down the best I have ever had."}
{"text":"Came here yesterday for the large sloviki dinner ( I was hungry) ... It came with a 3 pieces of garlic bread to start, Greek salad, rice and two potatoes. So it was a good amount of food. The chicken Slovaki was nice, moist and not salty.  All this was for 17 dollars with tip. 

The service was also very nice , with the Greek waitress telling me to relax and not rush out after I paid my bill."}
{"text":"This is my go-to Greek restaurant! I've only ever had their chicken souvlaki but that's only because it is always so good and when I come back, I only want to get more. 

Food:
- the portions are generous
- the meat is well-cooked and never dry (the flame grill does its magic)
- love the Greek salad - does not skimp on the feta!
- the rice and potatoes are flavorful 

Atmosphere:
- no bells and whistles as this is a mom/pop type restaurant, but the space is well-maintained and has an old fashion charm that modern decor can never give
- they have a cute backyard patio opened in the summers. Check it out 

Service:
- a meal does take a bit longer than average to come out but that's only because they're cooking the meat fresh! 
- nice servers; polite, attentive"}
{"text":"I have always loved the chicken souvlaki here, one of the best on the danforth. Their rice is so buttery, their tzatziki sauce is fabulous, and they're super affordable. However, the inside of the restaurant could do with a renovation."}
{"text":"I'm shocked there is only one review of this place.  They have the juiciest and tastiest souvlaki, period.  Pork and chicken are both delicious.  They have great rice and really nice salad.  Portions are huge and value wise unbeatable.  A large chicken dinner is 13.50 tax in. And a small(which is probably a large anywhere else) is $9.50.  The husband and wife who own the place are really really nice and genuine."}
{"text":"I'm shocked at all the good reviews for this place and actually think many of the posters are confusing this place for the other Asteria east of pape.   The souvlaki was cooked well but lacked seasoning, and the potatoes looked amazing but fell well short.  They were pretty tasteless.  Overall I was extremely disappointed after reading all the good reviews of this place.  The girl serving us was very nice but the food doesn't stack up against all the other restaurants down here."}
{"text":"Haha I enjoyed this place. Even though the inside is dingy, the meat was too salty and potatoes not seasoned enough. The entire plate of food was greasy... it feels homey. The lady was super friendly, and I enjoyed my meal immensely :)"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! You feel like you're in Greece. Such a friendly bunch of people, they all seem like family. The waitress was like a sweet Greek aunt that we all wish we had in the family. Running around smiling, keeping an eye on things, making sure everything was perfect. A kind wink, and a smile goes a long way these days. Attentive, friendly, polite, and wonderful food. The hummus was so fresh and delicious. The chicken souvlaki was so tender and tasty. Highly recommend this little place to anyone. I'd bring guests here from out of town to show off our beautiful Greektown before I went to a large, chain-like place in that area. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"If I want soulvlaki dinner, this is my new go to place. I love food and typically only care about taste and price. A lot of the Greek restaurants in the area are about the same in terms of taste. The main difference is in atmosphere and price. Asteria is good for me because the price is on the low end, portion is good, and tastes like most other places. 

It's a family style restaurant. The woman serving me was so nice. Kind of like the aunt I never had. 

If you're not on a date (or if your date doesn't care about atmosphere), then come here. You'll get decent Greek food and keep your wallet will thank you. If you want take out Greek, you definitely should come here."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 

Nice backyard patio. Food was average, not bad and not outstanding. Our order took 25 minutes to arrive which was disappointing considering that we just ordered Gyro and souvlaki. Price was good."}
{"text":"Ain't nothin' wrong with Asteria! We literally ran off the street into here before catching a show at the Danforth Music Hall a few weekends ago. It was blizzardy and windy and cold outside, and not many places were open. We made a quick game-time decision to try Asteria and hope for the best food-wise. We were not disappointed! The chefs at the front were so cute and charming - singing old tunes to themselves while cooking up food. Our server was a very kind woman - we got the feel that this is a family place. She offered us some helpful suggestions about what to order and we ended up settling on the vegetarian plate (for me) and the chicken souvlaki plate for my friend. The food was just what we needed! Everything tasted fresh, authentic, and homemade. I particularly liked the greek salad and the rice and potatoes. Very, very yummy rice! 

We had no intention of going to Asteria, but boy am I happy we stumbled upon it. Next time I'm going to a show at the DMH, I know where to go for a quick bite!"}
{"text":"Great souvlaki and gyros. Truly great price too! Fabulous patio in the summer. Don't be fooled by the 1970's decor. The food is authentic and great."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's our go-to for Greek. Always order the same thing: chicken souvlaki dinner. Chicken is really moist, salad is fresh, and the potatoes have a special something that makes their flavour so delicious.

Other people we've taken there swear by their pork souvlaki too as the best in the Danforth.

Their saganaki (baked cheese with flaming ouzo finish) is amazing and we always order it as a treat when we take friends here for dinner.

And when we want a sweet treat, we have the baklava - delicious! Crispy filo pastry with lots of bits and dripping with gooey honey goodness.

One thing it's not is fancy. It's completely casual - diner-like and run by the same family for decades. The tables are standard and we tend to come in, eat our usual, and leave.

Oh - and in the warm weather, they have an awesome back patio!"}
{"text":"Asteria Sousvlaki Place: You want greek food?  You've found the right place.

Price: Affordable
The Food: Not bad - a lot of classic dishes.
Experience: A family style restaurant.  Takes part in the taste of the Danforth festival.  Decor could be nicer, but i didn't come here to to complain about ugly chairs / old fashion place.

Its simple cooking that has remained the same.  4.5/5"}
{"text":"We live in the neighbourhood and this is our go to spot for greek food. Its unpretentious, family friendly, affordable and delicious.  Can't beat the value for the lunch souvlaki or gyros plates which come with greek salad, potatoes, rice and garlic bread!"}
{"text":"5 star food, service, quality & value! My husband & I shared the fried cheese starter & Gyro dinner plate. More than enough food for both of us. We walked out very satisfied & looking forward to coming back. My husband said this is the best Greek food he has ever eaten."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good. I kept telling the crew it's the \"Greek Keg\", they left with a big smile and a happy belly."}
{"text":"The 5 is based on the criteria of a family restaurant. Friendly owner and family run. Great food, better than most on the Danforth and half the price. Charming and the food is great.  The Chicken Soulaki is awesome and the menu is full of the classics."}
{"text":"a bit WEST! of the busier section of Greektown, I think it's worth the few extra blocks, less busy.  Plus on weekends the bigger spots are crowded with lots of annoying kids and family outings.  The food is great, better prices than down the street, friendly staff.  The carpet is gross, needs to be replaced (flooring would be much better), especially the carpeted stairs to the washrooms.  Most importantly; GOOD FOOD!"}
{"text":"Meh. 
It's basically a few steps down from a 'Swiss Chalet'-esque restaurant that hasn't been renovated since the early 90's. (Being generous with that timeline btw).

If a restaurant could have a sad face, this one would. It's so tired and run down inside. The feeling is blah. The faux painted on cracks in the wall ... The painted on grape vines and faux marble painting job ... :((((((
 
The menu is basic. And you get huge servings of mediocre generic \"Greek\"
food (like the kind you get at the food court).

I ordered out tonight. Picked up, and got to experience this place first hand. *insert sad face
First time here. And the last."}
{"text":"We came here after planning to go to Athens and it was packed. Zorba's used to be our go-to for cheap good Greek, until I discovered it was gone - I've since learned it moved rather than closed, fortunately!

Asteria was quiet when we walked in, but we were greeted heartily and ushered to a seat in the back and quickly settled in with the menus.

Food came out quickly, and was in generous portions, well prepared, and delicious. Service was friendly - the server argued about how lamb should be prepared with my father, \"I'm Greek, I know lamb - it should be medium\" vs \"I'm not Greek, medium rare...\" Dad was convinced he was right at the end, but he did nevertheless enjoy the meal.

Overall totally happy, would return."}
{"text":"We had some time to kill in the area and we were hungry so looked up a place and ended up here. We walked in thinking it was a take out spot, but we were seated and had menus brought to us.  Small mom and pop shop. The owner was sitting at one of the tables doing their books,  and there are about 5 tables. So underrated! Love spots like this. The food was sooo good and cheap! We just had pita wraps but definitely want to come back to try a full meal. The couple behind us had a plate and it looked huge and so good. Must try!"}
{"text":"Okay, so not to be confused with the more touristy Astoria restaurant this little gem serves the BEST chicken souvlaki on the Danforth.  It's family run and has been here forever.  Their customers are super loyal to their succulent souvlaki and perfectly stewed lemon potatoes.  I don't know what it is but I've tried most of the souvlaki on the Danforth and there's just something perfect about theirs.  It's never over cooked and the seasoning is so flavourful but balanced.  The portions are generous and the service is always great.  They've got a great patio in the back that's nice and quiet and is just perfect in the summer time 'cause eating grilled anything is so much better outdoors."}
{"text":"I stopped in tonight because I was craving souvlaki and had heard good things about this restaurant. I ordered chicken souvlaki on a pita and waited while it was being made. I really liked that I could see the food being cooked, but I wasn't a fan of how much heat it put off into the restaurant. It was very warm in there, and I am so glad I took my food to go because I would definitely have been uncomfortable eating in that heat. 

There was a good amount of chicken and the pita was very soft. I was surprised by how bland it was, though. It didn't seem like the chicken was seasoned at all. There were also a ton of raw yellow onions, many of which i picked off. Using red onion or grilling the yellow onions would have been a nice touch. Overall, it was a pretty good value for the price, but I wasn't impressed and would probably only go here again if I needed something fast, cheap, and filling after a night of drinking."}
{"text":"Overall this place hit the spot and was what I was looking for.  Catching a show at Danforth Music Hall, I stopped in here for dinner.  The cook acknowledged me as a entered the restaurant and the server was friendly.  When I ordered my food the server offered to bring me tap water which I thought was nice  I got the pork souvlaki on a pita and a small Greek salad.  The salad was pretty big for a small. 

The food was good, reasonably priced, the service was fast and everyone was nice. My table was a bit sticky and the food wasn't very flavourful. I would eat here again before a show, but probably wouldn't make a trip out just for this place."}
{"text":"Great little spot. This isn't a place you're going to if you want stunning decor and fabulous service, but that doesn't mean it's not delicious. The prices are phenomenal for the portions you get, and the food is always great. The souvlaki is tender and flavourful, and the baklava is sweet sticky goodness!"}
{"text":"Been stopping in here for probably over 30 years
The foods always good and at the right price.
One thing about this place is it's always consistent.
I pretty well always order the chicken souvlaki dinner since it's by far the moistest and tastiest I've had anywhere
But I've also pretty well had everything on the menu over the years.
Some are better than others but over all it's all good!"}
{"text":"You're at Asteria because you like really good, simply prepared food.  You're not here because you're looking for superlative service.

Seat yourself, get someone's attention, order your food, get your food, dive in, enjoy!  The souvlakis are consistently good, dips are among the best on the Danforth, salads are basic and fresh.  

Good luck trying to get your coffee topped up, or a glass of water, or the bill, but again you're there for the food, not for the service.

Order everything you can imagine needing through the meal when you get the wait staff to your table.  You'll likely only get one run at this, unless you're immediate family.

Bathrooms - Danforth classic - down nasty crooked stairs - not disgusting, but don't go down unless there's no other option. 

If the chicken souvlaki wasn't so good, this would be a 2, not a 4.  Yes. That's how bad the service is."}
{"text":"Enjoyable yummy food Very friendly staff. Hubby and I had Saganaki and the pork Souvlaki. Nice plate, good food. Portions sizes were fine with the following exceptions: the Tazaki should have been about twice as much and most importantly, had the Saganaki been about 25% bigger and filled the plate I would have given Asteria a 5 star rating."}
{"text":"I got to try Asteria by accident. We were planning on a different lunch spot but it was opening late that day so we ended up at Asteria. I ordered the Chicken Souvlaki on a bun and fries. The chicken was nice and tender and grilled to perfection. The Tzatziki was nice and creamy but not too much garlic. The fries were nice and thick cut and fried to golden brown. Asteria is very affordable not only for lunch but I took a quick look at the dinner menu and it looks very good. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Pro's- Conviniently located in a good area on the Danforth, close to a lot of cute shops. 
Loved the patio at the back it was cozy. Food was alright, a bit greasy.

Cons- A bit pricey 1 greek pita and 1 souvlaki dinner cost $28. Small portions and interior was old dated. 

Overall, food was okay. But being in a very greek area I think I would try another greek restuarant in the area."}
{"text":"This small little Greek place is like the David of the David and Goliath of restaurants,with the huge Zorba's next door, and it's very easy to miss when you walk to it, as it's almost inconscpious. With the option of both take-out and eat in, this is one of the lowest priced Greek food places in Toronto, and they have a variety of items that are not available in many other Greek food restaurants, not even the more upscale ones. The service was quick, and the prices are excellent, myself, a friend, and my husband managed to keep the bill to under 40 bucks even though the other two people had two beers each"}
{"text":"I'm changing my star from 5 to 4 based on the fact that they take no debit and a bit of a surly attitude from my waitress. If you're sitting in front of the menu, at least get up to give me one! Come on! 

Still amazing chicken. This time I had the dinner. The greek salad has one, count em, one olive in it! Wow. Half the plate filled with salad, two roast potatoes and a small portion of rice with their delecatble chicken. It's still good value for $12 plus tax, though I'd like more rice or potatoes or even taziki and less \"salad\" (ice berg lettuce, three tomatoes and an olive with some Canadian feta does not a salad make)."}
{"text":"OG Greek

I've been eating here for over 15 years. The recipes, the love and care that go into the food has remained unchanged! Everything is reasonably priced but food is always of the best quality and cooked to perfection ;) the fried calamari gets me every time!

The service is also consistently efficient and friendly. The line cooks are always so warm :)

Looking forward to the next 15 years of delicious Greek food, keep up the amazing work :)"}
{"text":"Delicious and cheap chicken souvlaki made pretty quickly. Messini said theirs would take 20 minutes, these guys maybe took 7. Very good. $6.50 including tax. It was good chicken souvlaki. There was no one there except 1 table, 2 people. The service isn't friendly or welcoming. They seem tired like they work too much. Regardless of the service, the food is good and cheap. I'd recommend it for cheap Greek.

Their gyro was processed meat whereas Messini was real meat. Come here for chicken souvlaki and NOT the gyro (shawarma-like thing if you don't know.. Pronounced yee-ro). Chicken souvlaki = pretty satisfying."}
{"text":"My wife thought this was another place so I made her eat here anyway.  She thanked me for it. 

Food was fast and very good. The salad was amazing and the hummus and bread was fantastic. Even the rice had a little something extra that made it just a little better than normal. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. 

I wonder what is under that secret door in the floor in the back room..."}
{"text":"I come here whenever I'm at Pape & Danforth. The mom and pop who run this little Greek diner will look after you like family with generous helpings at a very reasonable price. If you enjoy lamb as I do, here you have your choice of New Zealand lamb chops or Ontario lamb chops, which cost a bit more. There are the usual offerings of Greek salad, roast potatoes and rice, gyros, souvlaki, and so on.  Just ask if you want extra helpings of tsaziki, olives, feta or bread, they are usually more than pleased that you're enjoying their food. This is a very old fashioned place where even pigeons feel welcome and at home. When I came in last summer, one pigeon was boldly walking in, going under the tables and cleaning up any dropped rice, then smartly walking out the door again. All of you will feel like family, even the pigeon :)"}

Get the pork souvlaki on a pita to go if you're on the run, usually lasts me two meals.
Great food very casual inside."}
{"text":"I was craving Greek food but didn't want to have Messini which is my usual spot when in the area. 

This is a mom and pop joint so the service was very personal and the owner made sure I was happy with the food. I ordered pork slouvaki small $8.75 came when a generous portion of fresh vegetables, rice and potatoes. The meat it self was juicy and succulent, combined with the taziki sauce, it was excellent! 

Will definitely return to try other items."}
{"text":"Didn't take everyone's advice to order the \"best\" chicken souvlaki. Unfortunately. Because we ordered the lamb chops from hell... grisley, tough, and greasy.  

Service sucked -- forget about service with a smile; more like service with a snear!

The dining room smelled funky -- mould? 

Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Awesome gyro and souvlaki

I loved my meal

I went back in Oct 2011"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever had a visit to this place where I wouldn't still feel hungry and/or not satisfied after eating the dinner."}
{"text":"Lovely, lovely, lovely barebones Greek restaurant in the heart of Greektown. The serving staff treat you like they've known you forever, the portions are good, and everything feels homemade. Enjoy the singing of the owner and her friends behind the counter, close your eyes, and enjoy the simple but delicious fare! 

PS: baklava was just perfect... Not sickly sweet and obviously made in house!"}
{"text":"local family run business.. its a great little place to grab a meal.  nothing fancy at all about this place. 

food is okay, not the best i have eaten but it satisfies the greek food craving."}
{"text":"My new go to for quick greek food on the Danforth.

The food aways tastes excellent - chicken is grilled to perfection.  

My only food complaint is that it's not the healthiest menu (as expected).  Oversized grilled hotdog buns as side 'bread' is a nice touch, but a bit heavy.  Rice and potatoes taste great, but are quite greasy and buttery.

I guess unless you are ordering a salad, you aren't going for healthy food anyway.

The wait staff can be a bit terse at times - inconsistent; sometimes friendly, sometimes hostile.

Decor is basic greek diner; unintentionally retro.  

It's definitely not the cheapest spot for quick sit down or take out Greek on the Danforth, but its always filling and delicious."}
