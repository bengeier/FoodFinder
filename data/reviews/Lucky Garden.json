{"text":"What a big let-down!  The food was really bland, except for what was seasoned with yellow curry.  Not very authentic at all.  I could make better Chinese food at home.  At least then my fried rice would have soy sauce! (as opposed to yellow curry)"}
{"text":"Do not order from their website because they don't turn their computer on to check their orders. I ordered through their website: http://www.luckychinesefood.ca/Login.aspx after an hour and a half, I called them to ask how much longer my order was going to be. I was told that their computer was turned off and to hold on a minute while they turn it on. I told them not to bother. I will not be ordering from them again. Why bother offering online ordering if you're not going to check your orders?!"}
{"text":"Really excellent food. Very tasty, really cheap and friendly staff to boot."}
