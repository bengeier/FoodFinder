{"text":"I've had a few of their pastries but I keep going back for their pastel de nata (egg tarts). They are the best in the area and compete with some of the city's best. R Bakery still has the best in GTA."}
{"text":"Love it! Love it! Love it! Really nice service and excellent pastries. Cakes are not too sweet and are always fresh. Price is reasonable compare to those in the neighbourhood. You must give it a try!"}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Markham!   This bakery does not get the justice it deserves because it is modestly hidden in the residential area in Greensborough, Markham. There is lots of variety and their goods are always fresh and taste fantastic!"}
{"text":"This location of Caldense Bakery for sure is well hidden.... It is located in a residential area North of 16th near 9th line.   Thanks for Caldense Bakery to open up a location up North, nothing much up here but Schools.. and houses.  No Menu! No Price Lists! No Description of the pastries I saw in the display cabinets!   Cappuccino ($2.52) with a Tarte de AmÃªndoa (kind of like a Almond cake which has a really texture) ($1.25) tasted great as a little treat, and 2 more cookies were given to me to go with my coffee....   Though I was a little disappointed as no signs of Portuguese egg tart?!  Caldense Bakery also serves cold cut sandwich, maybe I have to come back for some lunch specials?"}
