{"text":"\"Best things come in small packages.\"  Hands down some of the most outstanding Filipino food I have had yet! With simple yet flavorful dishes like lumpia and sinugba, Oming's Kitchen will definitely leave your taste bud satisfied yet craving more! You can find Oming's Kitchen food truck at First Friday and other Foodie and local festivals."}
{"text":"Best food truck ever. First tried them at the food fest,  it was the best decision ever. Pork Belly was mouthwatering. Went to Life's Beautiful and saw them there and all we had was their pork belly and lumpia. Both were amazing and and lumpia was crispy but still moist on the inside. we kept going back to Oming to eat!!! Just can't resist her food"}
{"text":"Mmmm mmm mmm pork belly is so good! Pork Belly Sinugba, is flavored and charred just right crispy on the outside flavorful on the inside! Couldn't get enough of it definitely a must if you're in the Vegas area YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED"}
{"text":"Came here for first Friday..... delicious!!!!! Pork belly, rice, and lumpia entree. Full of flavor. Loved every bite! Definitely would get more! And the portion is definitely big enough for two."}
{"text":"Oh my god this is the best Filipino truck in the history of Filipino trucks the staff so friendly the owner came out and talked us everything was wonderful I highly recommend following them on Facebook or Internet at WWW.omingskitchen.com"}
{"text":"This is the best food truck food I've ever had. Everything was totally fresh, the flavors were delicious, and even though I had this at the Sunset Park'd food festival and things were pretty darn busy, the food came out really quickly and was cooked to perfection. I got the chicken sinugba (the pork was sold out when I went - obviously it's popular!), and it was a fantastic choice. My friend got the lumpia and said that had an amazing flavor, as well. I would probably go out of my way to have this again; it's a great choice!"}
{"text":"Was at the life is beautiful festival and we had a pork belly combo bowl,  oh my gawd,  amazing!!! The lumpia was perfect and the pork belly was tender and juicy and the sauce was to die for.  I'm already searching where they will be next I'm craving thst bowl like crazy today!!!"}
{"text":"We were browsing the food truck line up at First Friday's on May 2, 2014 and there were so many trucks I didn't know where to begin! We didn't have any cash and luckily this cute little Filipino food truck accepted credit cards. We are so glad this was our first stop, since it was the best truck that we tried of the entire night. 

The BBQ pork belly sandwich sounded like it was right up our ally. The sandwich looked simple and there wasn't anything else inside the sandwich except for pork belly, but it was love at first bite! It was packed with delicious flavor - salty, sweet, really moist and tender like butta! It was satisfying and addicting. I enjoyed it! If sandwiches aren't your thing, you can totally get it on top of rice as well. 

We've also tried their lumpia which are Filipino egg-rolls filled with savory meat. They were bite sized and absolutely addicting! Hot, crispy and filled with bold comforting flavor. They also came with a tasty sweet and sour sauce to dip them in.

I would love to try their other offerings, their menu isn't big at all - probably 5 items at most.

The service here is like family! Oming (the chef) and Naz (runs the front) are super genuine and awesome foodies as well! We loved chatting it up with them about great local food finds and about where we've eaten since we moved to Vegas. Their passion of food shines through in their delectable bites that they offer on their truck! I even overheard customers eating in front of the truck saying their chicken adobo is crazy tender and flavorful. Definitely come check them out!"}
{"text":"After moshing in the pits at the Las Rageous festival I needed a pick me up. The pork belly with a side of lumpia was just what I needed. It was one of the best things I ever ate!! I can't wait to try this again."}
{"text":"They always seem to be parked right outside the library at UNLV and starting the semester, I would walk past it to go to class. Today I finally decided to give them a try!

They serve Filipino food and they offer good prices for the students at UNLV. 
I got my Pork belly combo with lumpia. The pork is cooked thoroughly and even has a char taste which I was surprised, I thought it would have been marinated in some sauce to mask the flavor of the meat but it was quite tasty this way! The bowl cost me around $12. 

Definitely give these guys a try if you walk past them here at UNLV. :)"}
{"text":"The company that I work for had this food truck come to our job place today and OMG! Was it delicious!!! I hadn't had good Filipino BBQ since moving here from California! I had the Sinugba Chicken Bowl which is served with jasmine rice. The chicken was full of flavor and perfectly cooked. I was very impressed and was left wanting to try out the pork belly they also offer, which I will definitely order when they come back again."}
{"text":"Damn their grilled chicken & pork belly was sooooo good!!!! How i wish they can travel to Cali too."}
{"text":"Never seen or heard of this food truck before but saw it on UNLV campus today. After being burned out on Burger Fest, Taco fest, sausage fest (the only food trucks that are ever on campus) trying this truck was a no-brainer. I'm glad I did, this is delicious! 

The only reason I didn't give this experience 5-stars is due to the price. The combos are $12 dollars ($13 if paying with credit) and are about the same size as a bowl from panda express. Options are pork belly or grilled chicken with lumpia and rice. I got the chicken and lumpia combo. 

Everything was delicious! I'm just not a fan of paying restaurant prices for street food."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken bowl but they assured me that I should definitely try the pork belly and they made my order half pork belly and half chicken. Both proteins were delicious and perfectly seasoned and cooked but the pork belly was just bomb..maybe it was the delicious fat. I would totally order the pork belly bowl again."}
{"text":"The Oming's Kitchen food truck came by my work today with a few other food trucks and from looking at the reviews this seemed to be the best choice. I got the pork belly bowl with lumpia and it was delicious. I would actually rate this as 3.5 stars due to the pork belly being a little burnt and missing a little sweetness, but I've rounded it up to 4 because I know they were busy and I can see what they were going for, and they were still delicious. I highly recommend this food truck!"}
{"text":"They had this truck at EDC and omg I loved it so much. The pork rolls are amazing and also the pork bowl was somewhat life changing. Tender pieces of meat and flavor fullness makes this place a must try. Reasonable pricing too you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Such a relief to see this food truck at the 2015 SEMA Show. A nice break from all the sandwich & burger options that were there. The lumpia & chicken combo hit the spot! Hope to see this truck again the next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Not sure if people even read food truck reviews on Yelp but here goes :D

+Legit Filipino food.  You can see the titas in the back cooking it up.  Don't expect anything fancy or anything crazy, there's only 2-3 different items.

+Lumpia.  Nice and crispy with sweet and sour sauce.

+Chicken entry and Pork Belly, can't go wrong with either!

+The food came out quick and hot even though there was a huge line.

It was the most comforting thing to have after a night of drinking at the Rise festival, so sad they're not in LA!"}
{"text":"This food truck is delish! I am new to trying noodles and I have tried omings twice and love it. Not too much flavor but not bland either"}
{"text":"While trying to pick out what truck I wanted to eat from on First Friday I remembered all of the positive thing I read and saw about Oming's Kitchen. Without hesitation I ordered the pork belly bowl that is served with rice and lumpia. The pork belly had some nice flavors and the lumpia we very good as well. The rice was there to suck up the flavors of the pork so a few bites of that went down well."}
{"text":"Great chicken and pork belly! Thanks for all the love! I enjoyed the grilled taste. Give the food a try, you will be happy that you did. Great work chef."}
{"text":"Such a rip off!!!! Twenty something bucks for a small bowl of white rice, chicken (that I saw come pre cooked out of a big plastic bag ) and tiny skinny lumpias.  I read a few of the other reviews and I guess they hack up the prices and rip people off for the magic trade show since the menu is in marker.  DEF will never get food from this truck again....spoke to  several other people who ordered food from there, and they were not satisfied either and were eager to complain."}
{"text":"Tried Oming's Kitchen this past summer and it was one the highlights of my Vegas trip. The service was quick, staff was friendly. I had the Pork Belly and it was BOOMMMBBB! I had to go back 2 more times while I was there cuz it was that damn good. If you're ever in Vegas, go look em up at UNLV campus. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"Pork belly is FIREEEE absolutely delicious. And their lumpia always hits the spot :) friendly staff. Wish they could open a restaurant lol only downfall is the portion for their price :/ overall, I'd still recommend anyone to try"}
{"text":"My boyfriend ordered the grilled pork belly combo that comes with rice and 6 lumpia that are about 3 inches long. He really enjoyed the glaze on the pork belly and ate all of the lumpia asap. They were super hot and fresh so he was mad because he wanted to eat them faster xD  

The glaze on the pork belly is very sweet. It needs something to cut through the thick sweetness, it's a very rich sweetness. Without the lumpia, he says, the taste would have gotten to be too much. It was $12 and my boyfriend was completely stuffed. He actually ended up taking some leftovers home.

The menu is basic but quality. The lumpia is delicious, addictive like most lumpia. We would come back but we wish it were a tiny bit cheaper. Good service though! :)"}
{"text":"Got to try this place at foodie fest... OMGGGG I got the pork belly bowl and it was amazing. Came with rice and lumpia , the flavor was so good and service was quick. It was a generous serving for a good price. I wish an actual restaurant was open for this place I would go all the time! My friend had the chicken bowl and it had a teriyaki BBQ taste and it was amazing as well! Can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"I thought I was trying them for the first time yesterday, but it was actually the second.

Oming's Kitchen is a Las Vegas food truck dishing out Filipino cuisine. They've been at Great American Foodie Fest several times, and my friend was interested in trying them today. I didn't even remember having them before, so I guess that's the kind of impression that they left at that point.

They didn't have the sandwich that I evidently tried last time, so it was pretty obvious that we had to get the Pork Belly Combo ($13 at event premium price). This is a rice bowl with their signature pork belly and six lumpia. The pork belly was still more chewier than it really should be, but it was tender enough that I didn't mind. The sweet sauce on the pork belly was excellent and carried the dish. The rice was cooked properly, which is to be expected if not demanded. As for the lumpia, they're tiny, thin and vegetarian, but they lend enough crunch and flavor that they're enjoyable.

This is a proper four-star rating this time for Oming's Kitchen. They're not perfect, but they're one of the better food trucks at Great American Foodie Fest and in Las Vegas in general."}
{"text":"Had the pork belly combo last weekend at Sunset Station Foodie Fest.  They give you lots of food and it is delicious.  Oming is definitely one of the top trucks around."}
{"text":"Thanks for coming to the Las Vegas Volleyball Tournament over the weekend. I've enjoyed the little lumpias, pork belly and chicken tacos and of course the rice bowl. I will be looking for your truck next year again. Cheers!"}
{"text":"I'd been eyeing this truck at The Great American Foodie Fest, but it took me until the last day to actually stop. Too bad! If I had stopped earlier I would have had time to return for more deliciousness. 

I went for the Chicken Combo which included chicken, white rice, and Lumpia. So simple and yet so flavorful. The chicken had a great marinade on it and the perfect amount of char. The chicken flavor and char worked it's way nicely into the perfectly prepared sticky rice. The lumpia was also very tasty and had a nice crisp on the outside. I really enjoyed the sauce that came with the lumpia as well. 

I'll definitely be looking into Filipino restaurants in town if this is what I've been missing!"}
{"text":"My workplace schedules a Food Truck day weekly, incorporating different trucks each time. I've tried several and have to admit that Oming's Kitchen is the one I repeatedly go to. Albeit small, the lumpia is good and I love the sweet chili sauce to go with it. I think it's pricey for 12 pieces - especially since the pieces are a third of the size of normal lumpia, but it doesn't stop me from ordering it. Last week I tried the pork belly for the first time and loved it! It kind of put me off since I really wasn't sure I wanted something that said it was from a \"belly\" but after someone explained to me what it tasted like, I decided to give it a try. Glad I did! I would like to see other entrées served - they typically only offer the pork and chicken when they come, but either way, I've eaten everything that have offered and loved it all They happen to be a repeat food truck here - and I've been told they'll be back again this week. Depending on the offerings, I may be another repeat customer!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food.  It is perfectly prepared and tastes sooo good! My favorite is the pork belly combo! Its the kind of food that keeps you coming back for more! The food portions are perfect and leave you happy and satisfied! :)"}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of eating this deliciousness a few times now at First Friday's and other festivals around Las Vegas. The menu is petty simple with the options of pork belly, chicken or lumpia. I also like that they give you the option to pay with cash or card. 

This most recent time I had the lumpia and pork belly combo which also comes with rice. The portion size was very generous especially for a price of $12. The wait was a little bit longer than usual, but I know they were pretty busy."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try the lumpia while the truck was parked at UNLV instead of trying the same tired options inside of the student union. I'm glad I did - went in-between classes so there was no one in front of me, the food came out fast and hot, and it was delicious! Great, quick snack in-between classes while on campus when you don't want the lines or mediocrity of the student union."}
{"text":"They were around the Las Vegas Convention center at the time we were looking for food. The Price was about $8 for a bowl of meat and rice. Maybe I was hungry at the time I was eating it but it was good. The sauce they used was sweet and its the same flavor for both the chicken and the pork. For $8, you get the same price or around the same price as other food vendors and because it is in the convention center area, there is no such thing as cheap. It was decently priced and the food was good. Better than the other choices available around honestly."}
{"text":"Enjoyed there delicious food today at the food fest ''Omg\" I'll follow her for life. Your Hospitality is hard to find thank you."}
{"text":"The fun thing with food trucks is also the worst thing about food trucks.    Their food is always amazing.   But then the realization hits you that you won't be able to find that food truck for another whole year (while you live in another state).   

While out in Vegas for SEMA, Oming's had a food truck outside of the arena, and we were smelling the marinade around... we made sure to try it out.   My friend had the chicken while I had the pork belly and lumpia.  The sauce was amazing... as I was diving into my first few bites... the lady who was calling out the order numbers started talking to me about their process for making the meals... how long that goes into maranaiding the meat, etc etc.   

All I could do was thank her.   Because it was hitting the spot at a time where there was nothign but hot dogs and pizza slices all around the show.    

The marinade reminded me of a sweet teriakyi jerk flavor, but also this had just a nice and subtle punch of heat and more flavor.    I believe that would be the 22 hours it was marinading though.   

Great stuff, make sure to check them out if you get the wonderful opportunity!"}
{"text":"Had the pork belly bowl and lumpia last night at the punk rock bowling show. I also had the pleasure of talking with the cashier and the owner for a few minutes. Not only were they super cool ladies, the food was absolutely delicious. The pork belly was awesome and perfectly cooked and the lumpia was crispy and super yummy. I'm definitely going to see if I can track this truck down again when I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Oming's has quickly become my favorite food truck. Always a solid choice. My go to order is the pork belly and lumpia but everything is delicious. It was definitely time for a review update. Highly recommend this place if you come across it during a festival or food truck event."}
{"text":"AWESOME FOOD! Stopped by for a late night chow. Pork belly and lumpia are the BOMB! Just hit the spot. Thanks ming and nas!"}
