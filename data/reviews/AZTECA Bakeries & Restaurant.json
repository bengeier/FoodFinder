{"text":"I wanted Chilaquillas , I asked if they had it and she said yes. I ordered it with green chilli and she she OK. I was obviously interrupting her texting session.  What I got was soggy chips under green chili. It was funny.  The green chili was good though.  Everyone else ordered burritos, I bet they were delicious.  Just stick to the burritos and you will be fine. Also don't ask for a small soda because all they have is medium and large and they will look at you like an idiot. Lol!"}
{"text":"Small Mexican restaurant. Great food, not much seating inside but they have more seating outside if it's a nice day out. Friendly service and great prices. You can even get fresh tortillas packaged up to take home."}
{"text":"Crazy affordable and crazy delicious! I got the carne asada and if was crazy juicy and the tortilla was probably made within the last hour or so. So fresh!"}
{"text":"I literally group up right around the corner from here and every time I go back and visit Phoenix this is my #1 stop :) I don't even visit my family 1st until I have grabbed a quick red burrito.  Very authentic and they cook their own pan (sweet bread) as well.  I also love their soups well actually I love everything they cook! #realmexicanfood"}
{"text":"I stopped in for the first time last week and had a great lunch! The shredded beef has a little heat to it...Tortillas are fantastic...Great rice and beans...An INCREDIBLE value for around $5.00. I will be going back quite a bit."}
{"text":"they have the best breakfast burritos.  they call em \"burro chicos\".  $1.99 I cannot get enough. tortillas made fresh there.  also you get chips and salsa.  their red salsa is the best in the state.  I wish they bottled and sold it.    call in your oder because it gets packed fast.  also get a large lemonade it tastes great and the ice they use is like sonics.    the service is also friendly and nice.  they keep that place clean."}
{"text":"Been going here for about a year.  Its great and on our regular rotation of places to eat.  The only 2 things I have had there is the Green or Red Burrito but its so good that I don't want to try anything else.  The ladies at the counter are ALWAYS nice and the food is ALWAYS great.  The burrito I get is 3.99 and they give you a cup of chips with salsa.  The best I've had in central Phoenix and we tried most of em."}
{"text":"Mediocre tacos.  I'll have to come back for the baked goods and see if they can earn more stars from me. Ended up there for lunch because some colleagues and I had a break from a training class and it was close. I was hoping to make a great find, but alas, they didn't impress. I figured a classic carne asado taco dinner would be a good barometer for gauging the place. The corn tortillas - now those were 5-star. the carne asada was so-so seasoned, not bad flavor, but somewhat bland, and quite tough. The mass of shredded lettuce on the tacos did nothing for it except make the lovely tortillas a bit soggy. Same for the blob of guacamole on the tacos. OK, but but so unpromising that I won't bother coming back for another meal. The baked goods on the other hand, I'll be back to try."}
{"text":"Highly disappointed today. BEWARE non BEEF and PORK eaters... Today, I ordered the 'combination 2 tacos' . Apparently, most food orders are for BEEF instead instead of CHICKEN. Needless to say, I don't eat beef or pork - their website doesn't specify BEEF or PORK -   And the kicker is, when I called their establishment to speak with a manager, I couldn't get past the young lady on the phone to leave my comment.  It was stated \"that the customer needs to specify CHICKEN with their order\". Granted, I take partially responsibility for that - how about not assuming that all customer's eat BEEF and PORK and ask them their meat preference.  Furthermore, when speaking with the young lady there was no recommendation to try to fix my order, no apology, no nothing to try to amend this.   Azteca update your website to reflect chicken/beef/pork or what have you instead of assuming that or a great majority of them eat BEEF.   You live and you learn huh! On a more positive note, my rice and beans were edible and quite delicious."}
{"text":"Food was good. Best tamales and tacos I've had Service was substandard. Cashiers was the rudest I've experienced in a long time. They would have rated 5 stars if it wasn't for that. We will revisit and recommend to our friends and family. However the next visit if service hasn't improved I will speak with manager."}
{"text":"I walked in and everyone eating there was Mexican, that's a good sign.  The food and soda were good and so was the service."}
{"text":"Nice place for breakfast. Good machaca w eggs. Friendly, clean. Didn't try pastries but looked good."}
{"text":"Delicious bakery and the Machaca is very tasty. Chico burros are the perfect size and the chips and salsa that come with are a great touch."}
{"text":"I have had better.. We ordered food and the flautas where a mess all broken apart, the carne asada was dry and did not have much flavor. The would only give red sauce and if you wanted green it was extra. Also they gave guacamole but put the container in the box on top of the hot beans and the guac. was black and hot by the time we ate. I would not recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent, fresh, old style Phoenix like going to someone's private home.  All from scratch, no processed food, homemade flour tortillas, lots of love in the food from the chef and the friendly, caring staff. Had huevos rancheros (no cheese)....heavenly."}
{"text":"The bakery is fantastic but so is their food. I worked briefly for a real shithole in downtown but the one bright spot was it allowed me to lunch at Azteca almost daily. I fell in love with their carnitas burros, which are HUGE and about 3 bucks if I recall correctly. One of the things I miss about being in California is how you can find those huge $3 burros just about everywhere, well Azteca is your place for that sort of thing.  Please go there and help support a great local restaurant and bakery."}
{"text":"This place makes very good food, and most of the time there are no issues. I do feel like every time I go in I'm flipping a coin though. There have been multiple times they overcharged me because of things like adding on cheese when it should have been included, however, that is a small difference in the cost but it still adds up over time. They also have gotten my to go order incorrect twice in the past, so when I'm in a hurry I end up sitting there 10 minutes anyway for them to make the right order. Today though, I went there with 2 friends for our lunch break, and I guess their \"machine\" was broken and they didn't put our order in to the cook until we asked what was going on 30 minutes later even though the 10 people who came in after we asked what was going on were getting their food right away. Then the waitress pointed out the owner, who did not come over to apologize and didn't even glance at us, I don't totally blame him because we were obviously angry, but the point is it took 40 minutes to get our food. No apology, nothing free, just an apology from the front desk lady who had no control over the situation. I will not be back, even though I do enjoy their food :( this is also my first and only post on yelp I have ever made, that is how bad this incident pissed me off."}
{"text":"The place has good food and friendly service. We were waiting in line while someone ahead of us was counting out pennies and taking a long time etc. No big thing to us we weren't in a hurry, but one of the ladies behind the counter came out and took my friend and I's order. I thought that was a nice touch. The food was good, plenty of it and they have dandy pastries. I don't know the names of all of them but they are good. What I really like it the atmosphere. I don't know great mexican food from decent but I do know when I am eating something I like. This place just makes you feel like you are getting the real stuff, whether you are or not. I ate there three times on my last Phoenix visit and will do so again this spring.  I recommend it, not that my recommendations on mexican cuisine are anything to write a book about."}
{"text":"When I work on Saturdays this is the place to get my breakfast burrito! Open from 7 AM to 2 PM on Saturdays! Also got  the shredded beef taco! Which was nicely seasoned shredded beef and very tasty!"}
{"text":"The tortillas are very good, but the quality of the meat that they place therein is a bit of problem.  The first time I went I had the carne asado burrito, and although the taste was good, I chewed the meat in that thing for an hour and half and my jaw hurt. So the second time I went, I got the chicken burrito figuring the meat would be more tender. It was, but still the quality of the meat was lacking.  Again, the taste was decent. The third time I ordered a egg burrito for breakfast, and I must say that the quality of the eggs they put inside the burrito are just great.  Really low prices and some nice baked goods.  I would certainly buy a bag of the tortillas they sell at the counter."}
{"text":"The most authentic and good Mexican food I have eaten north of the border!  Even better than Carolina's! They are not open for dinner."}
{"text":"I asked what the most popular dish was and got it: green Chile burrito with rice and beans. Although it was more food than I normally need, I was glad to have the rice to take the edge off the spice. Really tasty and would come back again next time I'm in town. Oh and delicious water infused with strawberry and citrus"}
{"text":"Great food with great prices. Very fast service and hot sauce is wonderful. Must come in on parking lot on the avenue side."}
{"text":"This place is sooooo fantastic!  Awesome food and baked goods at very affordable prices!  I like going early in the morning when they first open!  Their empanadas are fresh and fantastic!  A huge machada and potato burrito with cheese is only $3.75.  You would pay $10 for a burrito like that in Scottsdale!  Just one of those many great little places that we're blessed with out here in The Valley of the Sun!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise. I can't say I was expecting much based on the outside appearance. In fact, if you're coming up 7th Avenue from the south, you'd think this place is called Aztec. The \"A\" at the end of the name has been missing for a real long time.  The inside is pleasant and tidy (but not too tidy), with an array of pastries that would rival any supermarket bakery section.   The combos are a superb deal -- most under $7 -- and you get a lot of food quickly. The refried beans and rice are nothing to sneeze at (a subtle necessity to any Mexican cuisine in my book), and the slow-cooked machaca is deliciously tender and flavor-packed.  I really like the covered patio out front. There are some nice skyline views from the west, but it feels less stuffy than the indoor seating."}
{"text":"This place off 7th Ave north of Van Buren is my favorite Mexican food place for lunch since its the closest one to Downtown Phx that offers some delicious Mexican treats.   I have tried several things on their menu and hijole, todo esta bien rico, everything tastes yummy. My co-workers and I always recommend different plates from here to each others and each one of them has been a delight.  Let me start off with the fact that their flour tortillas are the best ones I have had in ALL OF PHX. They taste homemade and you can taste the authenticity of its flour mix, its just simply the best. Lets continue our tour of the food menu with the CARNE ASADA BURRITO, wow! The meat is seasoned to perfection and their lettuce is always fresh and so is their guacamole. I am NOT  a fan of burritos but this is one of the few places in which I WILL order a burrito because of its deliciousness.  The flautas plate is also yummy, the flautas are long and deep fried with shredded beef and they are delish.   A co-worker recommended that I try the Green Chile w Pork Quesadilla and add lime to it, and WOW, man, no words can describe the explosion of flavor that invades your tongue, its SO GOOD.   Furthermore, this place always feels warm and welcoming. The two girls that basically run the place always seem to know who their repeat customers are and they spoil us with our requests for more salsa and guacamole and one of them even has our drinks ready for us as soo as she sees us walk through the door."}
{"text":"Pretty standard Mexican fare to be found here. Had read about some great Chile Relleno's here, but they were not as good as the hype. The place is pretty ancient and they have a back patio that more closely resembles a small prison yard where the birds will steal your free chips if you venture back inside. That area could be nicer with some sort of makeover, but when is the last time a Mexican joint ever underwent a makeover? The food looked nice on the plate, but I don't need a small pile of lettuce/salad in this ethnic cuisine. The side cup of guac was good and both hot sauces had some kick, but the Relleno was marred by a mushy crust and the use of yellow, not white cheese, in the middle. The rice and beans were probably above normal quality, but the Relleno was just run of the mill for 7 bucks. Still a good crowd at 1:30pm, but most bakery items were sold out by then."}
{"text":"Wednesday at work has always been Mexican food day. Over the years, where we got our Mexican food has varied, but for the last year or two, it has been Azteca more often than not.  It is a favorite of one of my coworkers, and he was the one who convinced us to give it a try.  And, how thankful was I!  Their tacos are fantastic -- shredded beef with a bit of kick to their seasoning, in a crispy, thick hard shell. And, even their beans and rice are wonderful. They make it even better, in my opinion, by sticking some chips in with your beans and cheese. It's like a mini nacho surprise. Plus, they always add a small slice of orange with every meal. I usually don't eat it, but it always adds a nice touch and smell to your eating experience.   I've not ventured too much beyond my yummy tacos, but my fellow coworkers always rave about their chimmi's and burritos with just as much gusto as I do about my tacos.  Oh, and the other day, I tried a sampling of their breakfast burritos, and I must say they were muy delicioso. Eggs and potatoes and bacon wrapped in a fresh, homemade tortilla -- that is what I call a heavenly breakfast.  And, finally, of course, are their baked goods. Again, I haven't tried their whole selection, but in the past I've been lucky enough to partake of their empanadas, and I've never been disappointed.   All in all, Azteca is a fantastic Mexican food experience in the heart of downtown Phoenix. It is affordable, it is welcoming and the food is delicious.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"100% amazing.  As I made an early morning leave from Phoenix we popped in here for a breakfast burrito which was AMAZING, and some tamales that were absolutely perfect. The big winner here though.. the homemade tortillas I purchased and took home. I can't even begin to tell you how GOOD they were. I even had people in LA freaking out at how delicious they are and I must find out if they will ship me a bag or 2.  The place is pretty bustling in the morning and I would easily, EASILY go back here for more. Staff is great and the food is authentic.  but seriously.. buy their tortillas. I'm not even kidding."}
{"text":"Azteca has some great breakfast burritos, too bad they don't open till after I have to be at my desk in the morning.  My coworkers love this place, I think it's so-so. Their carne asada is small, not very flavorful and the meat is boiled not grilled. The place is super busy and small so if you sit in at lunch it's a circus. For carne asada that's much better hit another joint."}
{"text":"JACKPOT, again...  Azteca Bakeries, Inc is a few steps closer to my loft. PERFECT for a Saturday morning breakfast. I did the Waiter's Special (breakfast burrito) with iced tea. Their red or green salsa is spicy and delicious.   Downtown Phoenix is LOADED with TASTY restaurants, catering to ALL nationalities. If you're a foodie, dwnt Phoenix is your spot."}
{"text":"Machaca and egg breakfast burritos are the reason I wake up in the morning. I've been a few times to pick up breakfast on the way into the office for myself and my work mates. I usually call ahead by 15 minutes, order a few egg and cheese and a few machaca and egg burritos and request they cut em in half for me.  Just because they serve tasty Mexican food and breakfast burritos, doesn't mean you should forget they're also a bakery. I almost certainly will leave with a few extra pastries for the vegetarians in my life who don't eat meat; although, I've been reminded by a vegan or two that cookies aren't vegan. Hey, you can't cover everyone's personal diet restrictions when it comes to treating your co-workers to breakfast I guess. I don't think they have a fruit plate, bagels I've heard don't have egg in them..., just not from Azteca Bakery though.   8 burritos, a few cookies and pastries will run you about $45, which is enough for 15ish people to all get a half burrito and a cookie, it's a great way to say \"hey everyone, great job at work, now eat a burrito :-)\"  I've also been here on a weekend with my lady and her baby, she keeps saying he's mine and I keep telling her, \"just because he looks like me and the paternity test *claims we're related doesn't mean I'm buying him a burrito.\" He's just a baby and only has three teeth. The theme here for me has been breakfast, but they also serve lunch too, being open until 2pm and all.   I wouldn't come around for a brunch or anything, they're not exactly table service and you won't find bloody mary's, bellini's and mimosas on the menu. You won't be impressing anyone with ambiance and drinks, just good, delicious Mexican food.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, eat more machaca (aka: super delicious, spicy shredded beef) !!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Quality food, amazing tortillas and good prices. They have little baked good area to pick up fresh pan dulce, cookies and pastries... a long with great, fresh Mexican food that tastes home made. Fantastic and fresh made tortillas for hat you can buy to go and my husband gets their 2 taco plate for $6.85 EVERY single time we go. If you eat in they give you chips and salsa and hey have delicious flavored water on crushed ice as well!"}
{"text":"We had trading nearby a month ago so a coworker and got lunch afterwards! Let me just say I have dreaming about the shredded beef chimichanga ever since, it had a few jalapeños in the meat....yum!  Can't wait until next time!"}
{"text":"So the wife and I woke one morning and were dying for a breakfast burrito. We could only handle Einsteins and Gag-in-a-bag some many more times. We decided, what the heck, let's give Azteca a try.  After all, we had partaken in El Norteno and La Canasta (both really salty in our book) and were like, come on, we live downtown, there's got to be at least one place with a decent chorizo and egg burrito? Well, low and behold, Azteca is better than most. The tortillas are probably the best part in my book - really tasty.  My favorite is the Egg and machaca, although its like mostly machaca and little egg, not a bad thing. Don't forget to ask for cheese with it though, my preference for sure. My wife likes the egg, potato and cheese, and I have to admit its tasty as well.  Before you leave, grab some pastries - specifically the empanadas. I'm typically not a fan of mexican bakeries (they always seem bland in my book), but the empanadas have a little flair.  Not my choice for lunch this place, you can do better at Asadero Toro or America's Best Tacos in my book.  Give a shot, you'll have fun."}
{"text":"Old school great Mexican food with good customer service."}
{"text":"A veg burrito is not where it is at.  On my second trip I went for the vegetarian burrito $3.75 again it came with a small tray of chips and a lettuce garnish. The wait was a bit long this time. I felt the tortilla was far too large for this burrito creating large amounts of extra tortilla, and it did not seem that soft to me.  The filling of beans, lettuce , a few veggies and guacamole was not well distributed and lacked inspiration.  The hot sauce is still good but  I am in no rush to head back here."}
{"text":"I had a great breakfast on the fly here. I had found another place up the street on yelp but when I pulled up I decided I wasn't going to either as it looked very sketchy. Came up here and got a bacon and egg plate, price was reasonable and the food was good. The young lady at the counter was very helpful and nice as well. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I once was impressed but I have to say lately my last three visits have not been the best. What I had always loved about this place was not only was the food good but so was the service. The new staff or change in staff is not up to par. It is not a welcoming home town feel like the place was when I first starting dining here. My last three orders have been wrong. I am not ordering anything special or making major changes. Either they are forgetting an item or if I order a fajita taco I get a shredded beef taco. Not sure where the discount is. There has been other issues but it is disappointing when you really want some good Mexican food and your left disappointed."}
{"text":"This place has a serious problem with getting orders right. I have gone off and on for years and can not recall a single time where my order was right the first time. It's truly annoying. The food is actually really good but it would be much better if I could get the right food with my order. Please, for the love of God, correct this easily fixable problem so I can give you a better rating."}
{"text":"They have the best toco and burrito in town , o eat here for almost 10 years , the food taste the same every time , the best thing about t his store is they made their own red and free sauce"}
{"text":"Ambiance: Medium sized Mexican Restaurant (with small bakery for Pan Dulce). 11 tables in a covered patio and 7 seven inside. Lunch hour the place is packed. Fairly well taken care with a semi-authentic Mexican feel to it. Patrons are all ages and backgrounds.  Food: All your typical Mexican fast food dishes (burritos, enchiladas, tacos, tortas, flautas, tamales) are on the menu. The unique offerings are enchiladas style burritos where they cover your burrito with enchilada sauce, which is delicious option. Their chicken burrito with Mexican cheese cream is also great. The place makes their own tortillas which I appreciate.   Service: Although there is usually a small line they move the lunch rush pretty well. Was brought out our food promptly. They do up charge for all add ons.  Price: Pretty fairly priced although you will be up charged for any add ons.  Overall: A great Mexican breakfast and lunch option."}
{"text":"Food was good but this girl at the register (slim with glasses) hustled me for the difference in price between carne asada plate vs 2 taco plate hahahahaha. My girl ordered a carne asada plate then they came out and said sorry no mas carne asada. When I asked home girl for a refund on the difference she was really having a hard time shelling out that refund. Difference was like 2 bucks (no biggie) but she's like \"hey it's only like a dollar..still want that money?\" I said sure why not, then she's like \"ok it's only like .70....you still want that money?\" Hahahahaha we just left. I think they need donations or something here at Azteca"}
{"text":"I just had their burro chico with egg, beans, and cheese, it was heaven in my mouth!!! the best beans and green chili ever!!!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here. My sister had mentioned the \"Enchilada Style Burritos\" were good. I cannot deny the food is good. But the service can use some work. They forgot one of our meals, and when we went to ask for it 15 minutes later after all the other food came, they had totally forgot about it. So there goes another 15 minutes waiting for it to get to us. When it did come, it was all cold and poorly put together. Tortilla was stale and all. Of course, we asked what the issue was? And they couldn't even give us an answer as to why. THEN, the cook came out, with a plate of flautas, and placed it on our table without saying a single word. I guess that was their way of saying sorry?"}
{"text":"Quaint place close to downtown. After touring the heard museum we headed over here in search of authentic mexican food. The food was indeed delicious! They also had a selection of home made cookies and rolls and things like that in the 'bakery' section. My friend was absolutely in love with their salsa which you can buy in an 8 oz. portion for I believe 3 or 4.99 or something like that. I was a little concerned when the person ordering in front of us had their order taken completely in spanish. I have zero language skills other than english but was pleasantly surprised when it came our turn and the girl took our order in 100% fluent enlish. Would go here again if I was ever in the area."}
{"text":"I like the combination of pan dulce and breakfast or lunch burritos all in the same place. I can take a meal to go and some pan dulce for the next day! The food is very tasty, not the best ive tasted, but no where near 'not good'.  Only draw back was the salsa was a lil watered down, overall, i likes, i would recommend and would go back, I give 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Great place for Mexican Baked Goods (Pan Dulce). They have cochitos, churros, zinger rolls, Mexican wedding cookies, empanadas, and several other festive pastries.  I like to drop in on my way to the office when I'm feeling nice and want to treat my co-workers to a little culture. Unlike bagels and store bought doughnuts, these treats are always gone by mid morning and that's how I like it.  Also good for a hearty breakfast burrito.  Try the Chorizo, Potato, Bean and Egg 4-way. Que Bueno!  I can't vouch for any of the lunch/dinner combo meals but will return for the baked goods and burritos."}
{"text":"Best green chile and hot to boot. Tortillas are thick and hearty, you will leave full if you order a combo"}
{"text":"A good place to have some really good burritos. Place is neat and has a good atmosphere. Price is decent enough. Not much to expect here though."}
{"text":"Their breakfast burritos are amazing! I also love their chips and red salsa. The pastries are to die for!! I always call and order ahead and they have my order ready in less than 10 minutes. Overall, amazing food and service!!"}
{"text":"Great machaca!! It's a great little place to get good Mexican food and their horchata isn't bad either."}
{"text":"Super yummy.  I've moved to  Phoenix from the south east and thus I'm trying out Taquerias every chance I get. When I stopped in to Aztecas all the beer delivery guys were having lunch... you know if 6 or 7 local delivery guys are meeting there... it must be good. The machaca and potatoes breakfast plate was yummy and the tortilla it came with... although there was only one it was a foot and a half across. Good!!!! And inexpensive."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this restaurant while walking back to my AirBnb. It was a great find - the people working at the restaurant were super friendly and responsive to all of my questions about the menu. Furthermore, there were plenty of vegetarian options and the menu clearly stated that no lard was used in the frying process. Highly suggest getting a burrito - they are enchilada style burritos and the sauces are the freshest things I've ever tasted!"}
{"text":"First time getting lunch, called in a large order for some coworkers. At first, I was skeptical because the lady taking the order was very impatient and kept saying \"Okay, is that it?\" after each order, which was only 5 orders. However, when we picked up the food, it was amazing. The carnitas burrito was very delicious. Chorizo was a bit too oily but still good. Would be a 5 star rating if the lady taking the order was more welcoming and pleasant."}
{"text":"HIDDEN GEM ALERT. You'd never expect this to be good but their breakfast is absolutely amazing. We usually order a ton of burritos here for company events and they never let us down. Cheap and accepts card, give them a try if you're in the area. I would recommend them for breakfast (because that's all I've had there)"}
{"text":"Ugh! Second time there and never again. Order took 30+ mins to be made. The only explanation was \"the printer in the back messed up\". They kept making the food ordered after ours. Owner was there but never came to the table to apologize, nothing but a rushed \"I'm sorry, I'm not in charge of the back. I don't know what to tell you.\" from the girl working the front.  Too bad the service sucks because the food's not half bad. Can't justify more than the one star."}
{"text":"If my fiance were writing this review, she'd automatically give it 5 stars bc she's obsessed with their carne asada burro (i will admit it's damn decent)! We come here mostly for breakfast because I wake up every monday craving the macheca and egg burro! Two burros, chips and salsa, and a large pepsi comes out to about $10... which you really can't beat for how big they are!  This place isn't fancy, but their food speaks for itself. It gets really busy right around lunch hour because they're very popular with the downtown work crowd!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Grew up in So Cal and live in Tucson. I've had every kind of Mexican food possible. This place is way up there. Legitimate homemade style food that satisfies. Great sauces. The baked goods are also to die for. If you're around you should definitely try it."}
{"text":"I love that there is some authentic mexican food close to  downtown!  I just found this place and decided to give it a try. It was a little chilly that day and was really craving my grandmother's homemade soups. I ordered the albondigas soup. It was really good! Now, it was not identical to what I'm used to but it definitely had good flavor and they didn't skimp out on the meat! The broth had a very strong taste of spices which was not overpowering. The tortillas de harina (flour) were pretty good. They could work on their salsa but it wasn't bad. I'd definitely come back and try their other soups!"}
{"text":"I always come here for breakfast and order either the omelette or an egg & cheese burro.  It's not a fancy place, but the service is warm, the portions are huge and it's not going to mess up your budget. It's very inexpensive. $5 for a home style  omellette breakfast combo or the $3 egg & cheese burro. Both comes with complimentary chips and hot sauce. Definitely a nice clean, friendly Mexican joint, where the food is more important than the decor."}
{"text":"I'd give it a zero, it won't let me. Horrible service. Took 20min for one underwhelming asada taco ugh what happened to this place?"}
{"text":"Been a long time customer for years and they were pretty consistent until recently. I feel like their quality of food has decreased immensely, as well as the service. Before the burritos were immensely bigger and had a sufficient amount of chips along with it. This has changed to microwavable small burritos with only three to five tortilla chips. In addition, the amazing pastries Azteca has been known for have become dry. Now for the service that certainly has plummeted entirely. Many of the employees working behind the counter are BEYOND slow. Orders can be seen behind them piling up by how much they take their time or not giving the To-go orders in a timely manner causing them to become cold.  Please Azteca, I have seen you at your best. Fix your service and food because this is turning into just a mediocre restaurant at best. Bring back the authentic Mexican restaurant we love."}
{"text":"Good and bad with this place. The food is good and fresh and the service is fast. They have some really good Mexican cookies! The young latina who wears glasses behind the counter is so smoking hot. They also have a lot of super hot customers.  The bad: The homeless trash that use the patio as their bedroom. I had some lady who looked like she was drug through the kitty litter with two dogs not on leashes sit next to me. I'm a bug dog fan but IDK what my deal today was. I couldn't handle being licked by a strange dog while I was eating... totally ruined my appetite."}
{"text":"I'd like to start by saying that anyone who rates Azteca as three-star or lower is either a damn fool, or is not well versed in Mexican food. You know who you are.  This is about as it good as it gets for the Phoenix area. Everything is homemade and delicious.  The green corn tamales are absolutely stellar. This beauty comes out wrapped in waxed paper and corn husk to maintain the moisture and heat. It's like unwrapping presents at Christmas time, a pure delight! Top this bad boy with green sauce and dive in to find kernels of corn complemented by the perfect sweetness. The green chile is also superb and highly recommended.   The staples even stand on their own. Your meal begins with crispy chips fresh out the fryer! Throw a little salt and green sauce on them and enjoy. The consistency and flavor of the beans is just right and they are not offensively overwhelmed with cheese as so many other restaurants. The rice always has great flavor, but can range in moisture from slightly dry to very moist depending on the day (I'm assuming different cooks.) And lastly the flour tortillas. These goodies are concealed by foil to keep them piping hot. Every time I unwrap them I get a little giddy. The smell is just so damn good! There are few things better than flour tortillas with rice and beans. This is just about the best threesome I have ever had.   The only downside to Azteca is the limited daytime hours, and the large lunch crowds. If you love Mexican food, and have not eaten here you must make it a point to come. You will NOT be disappointed. I almost forgot it is also very inexpensive with most of the combos ranging from $5-6ish."}
{"text":"Ordered 3 dozen tamales for Christmas. Went to pick up at requested time and they were not ready. I was told to come back in 2 hours and was also told they would not be frozen (like they had agreed to). Returned 2 hours later and they still were not ready to go. Waited another 30 minutes and then the order was completely mis marked. We can't tell what's in each bag. It was total chaos and I won't be returning. While waiting they completely messed up another man's order. He was taking his tamales to Oregon so he ordered them frozen, and none of his were frozen. Bad customer service!! And I tried one tamale (it was green but in the bag marked red) and it wasn't very good. Too little meat -- it was practically all masa. Last Christmas at Azteca!"}
{"text":"I have to say that I have enjoyed this place. I found it by accident on the way to work one morning after another place would only take cash. Breakfast burritos are good, fresh tortilla and ingredients. I have been back a few times now, service and food have been great. Besides the bk burrito, I had a steak ranchero lunch special, tasted like home made beef stew in a burrito... Very good."}
{"text":"Was looking for Mexican breakfast and found this little gem. It was only $14 for 2 full size meals, they give you more than enough. The tortillas were very fresh and had that Nana taste loved them. I ordered the Machaca with egg, which is shredded beef with eggs. My gf ordered chorizo with eggs also good. Everything was freshly made. We went around 10am was not very busy and everything was fast."}
{"text":"Great mom n pop Mexican restaurant ! Not very friendly staff but the food is excellent I recommend the green chili and the chorizo"}
{"text":"Love this cute little local place! You have to know about it to go, but damn is it good! Huge portions, cheap, and good chips and salsa, I'm in!!  My dad discovered this gem a few years ago, and I love it when we go. Love the hole-in-the-wall vibe and the staff is really friendly.   Green chile burro=YUM."}
{"text":"Been going for to this place for years... the red chile and green chile burritos are the best... the pan is bomb a spot you should check out ....."}
