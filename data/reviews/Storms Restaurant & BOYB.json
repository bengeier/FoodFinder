{"text":"The food here is amazing, a co-worker and I go at least once per month for lunch. The new recipe for the Eggplant Parmesan is mouth watering and is bringing me back today for lunch a 2nd time in a week. The food here is delicious, the atmosphere is terrific, and the homemade white french dressing is exceptional. I would have given it 5 stars except I keep getting the same unhappy waitress. She isn't rude or anything, just not all that friendly and I am a super friendly person and like to see my waitress smile and say hello but the food is just too darn good to let that keep me away."}
{"text":"Excellent.  Always on the lookout for good Italian food and found it here.  The marinara sauce had perfect balance and the entrees we ordered - veal scallopini, chicken piccata and Scalo were delicious."}
{"text":"I see there are quite a few good reviews of this place, but my experience was quite the opposite.  

DO NOT get the Groupon/Livingsocial/amazon local deal to go here.  They will not honor it as it is written and as you have paid for, but will make up the terms when you get there.  Our deal CLEARLY stated an appetizer, entree, and dessert for EACH PERSON, and we instead were forced to share both app and dessert, and were only allowed to order off of a limited menu.  The night we went even the limited menu they were out of 1/3 of the items on it.  

My wife and I also felt that we were being rushed through our meal and out the door when we were done, probably because we were only there with the deal and not a \"full customer\"."}
{"text":"I'm still thinking about my meal from more than a week ago.

My sister has been going here regularly for years and I had the treat of trying it out recently. 

The bar tender/server that works there is so sweet and at the bar they have house-made kettle chips that are to die for. I almost dumped a basket into my purse and with each beer, let me tell you, it was hard to keep my self control!

The food is mainly Italian and amazing. We shared a bunch of apps including the fried zucchini which is ribbon thin and mouth watering and stuffed banana peppers. But best of all I got the chicken romano ... OH MY GORSH! I got three thinly cut chicken breasts that were breaded and sitting in a pool of the ... most ... amazing cheesy creamy sauce I have ever put in my mouthballs. I am still regretting not drinking the remainder of the sauce that was left after I finished the chicken.( Would go nicely with the chips in my purse, no?)

Someone else ordered the herb encrusted steak and it was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.

Definitely, definitely try this place."}
{"text":"Storms is an interesting Pittsburgh restaurant experience. We went with a party of 5 & used a Groupon. We had never been before & didn't know what to expect, based on some of the prior reviews. Yes, it is a basement restaurant (no windows, so no view). We had Happy Hour martinis (apple & strawberry), delish!   Ordered both appetizer choices, 2 on each plate (both tasty). Virginia Spots were very good (I think similar quality to what I've had @ the Duquesne Club.) Veal dishes (Picatta & Scaloppini) were both enjoyed. Tiramisu was fine, not the best we've ever had, but far from the worst! Salad was ok, could use an upgrade in variety of greens. Wedding soup was delicious. All in all we were very pleased, left a message of approval for Mr Storms, who apparently supervises the kitchen. Yes the decor is dated, yes it is in a basement BUT, yes our experience was good, yes our service was good (thank you Brittany) & yes our meal was delicious! So, if you go, don't expect a Big Burrito style of cuisine but do hope for tasty food with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal, highly recommend the banana peppers for appetizer and the daily specials are always a must!"}
{"text":"I only get the chicken parm because why fix something if it isn't broke? This meal never disappoints me. Even 45 minutes after picking it up, the chicken was still crispy and the cheeses and sauces mixed perfectly. 
I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who finds themselves downtown. It is fancy but not pretentious, the portions are generous, and the food is straight up delicious."}
{"text":"I would compared this place to a local Olive Garden or Chilli's with a little more personal flare.

Pro 
Food was very good nice size portions.
Close to parking garage
Plenty of food with the groupon deal
Presentation of food was great
Centrally located 


Cons
Wait staff doubled as bartender for the packed bar so they were not as attentive as possible.
The area did not feel the most cleanest. Don't get me wrong it was not filthy but it looked as if had be a long hectic day and the place need a little TLC.

Over all I would return for another visit."}
{"text":"My husband & I think Storms makes the best Italian food in the city.  We particularly enjoy their Groupon dinners.  Their bruschetta & zucchini are the best we have eaten in Pittsburgh.  It is a great place for lunch, but we enjoy the quiet atmosphere for dinner even more.  We travel to Italy,we frequent  Italian restaurants in the Burgh, & Storms  is our favorite.  Using a Groupon, 2 people share a large appetizer.  You then choose soup or salad with your entre.  My chicken Marsala with vegetables was excellent.  My husband loved his veal piccata with pasta.  Two people share a dessert, but most people won't need it.  Our cheesecake with strawberries was wonderful New York style cheesecake.  This is the best place to get plenty of GOOD food at a good price."}
{"text":"This place is hidden in the basement of a large building.  The atmosphere isn't much to write about- basement-chic, dark, bar-ish.  The service also isn't particularly great.  Hostess was not particularly friendly when I walked in and gave my name and told her I had a reservation.  The waiter was polite but had his head in the clouds.  He said the bread basket in front of my dining companion and put her salad in the middle where the bread should be.  He screwed up our checks, mixing our orders. When he returned with our credit slips and credit cards, he gave hers to me and mine to her.  
The food is surprisingly good.  The wedding soup was some of the best that I can remember ever having.  The flavor was just fabulous - I can't even explain it.  I had the spots.  There were three pieces of fish, making for a fairly sized portion.  It had a lemon beurre blanc sauce, which was really tasty. Unfortunately there was barely a drizzle of it.  The vegetable of the day was a zucchini/squash medley.  Cooked very nicely- not mushy, but not overly hard.  Unfortunately I thought they were very under seasoned and bland. They were delicious, however, whenever I used them to scrape the dish to get the beurre blanc sauce.
My prior experience with Storms was a work holiday party. From that, I recall the food being good but the atmosphere prison-like.  I will return for the food, particularly if meeting someone that works up in that part of town."}
{"text":"Everything here is fantastic, the zucchini is to die for, have not had zucchini like this in a long time, thin ribbons and a huge portion! I had Virginia spots with crabmeat with a side of pasta and wedding soup. My friend had Chicken Romano. Everything was better than exceptional. I will definitely return!!!!!!!!!! I am Italian and cook Italian food, so I am very particular, I guarantee you will love this place,  very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Storms is located in a nice lower level space downtown. The barroom can be a bit loud. However, the quieter dining area allows much more intimate conversation. The service is great and the food is fantastic and well-portioned, though the servings may be a bit large for some.  The prices are very reasonable, but alcoholic drinks can be expensive. Overall, Storms is a nice, moderately priced  restaurant perfect for a quiet date."}
{"text":"An awesome lunch spot with generous portions. The chicken parmigiana is amazing! If you are looking for a hearty lunch meal, definitely try this spot."}
{"text":"I got a great deal on Groupon so decided to give this place a try. Without the deal, I don't think this would've been something that's within my budget. The restaurant is located in Downtown Pittsburgh, but in the basement of some law building. It was kind of difficult to find and out of the way. I went on a Friday night for dinner and business was not looking too vibrant. There were a few customers at the bar area and a few tables taken. Not sure why they need us to make a reservation if business was so slow. 

The atmosphere was simple, but yet clean and warm. Service was on point and the food came out super fast. For appetizer, I had the zucchini and bruschetta duo with a side of marinara sauce. The zucchini was thinly sliced and lightly rolled in flour. It was not as crisp as I expected, but I like the texture. The bruschetta had large chunks of tomatoes and a layer of melted cheese. However, there was way too much vinegar on the tomatoes. The marinara sauce was a total sodium-filled nightmare. Storms need to watch how much salt they add into the marinara sauce! For the main course, I tried the veal scaloppini. They must have pounded the crap out of the veal because it was so tender that it almost tasted like chicken. The sauce was light with a hint of red peppers and onions. The main course would have been great, but that side of pasta with marinara sauce really killed it. Again, the marinara sauce was a nightmare. The meal ended with a giant piece of tiramisu--so rich, fluffy and satisfying. You can't go wrong with tiramisu.

Overall, I enjoyed the friendly atmosphere at Storms, but I don't think the food was superb enough for me to come back here again and pay full price. The food at Storms is light and simple, so for those with more modest taste buds, this might be the place. I expect an explosion of flavors and fireworks in my food, so I don't think Storms is a match for me. I did have a wonderful dining experience here and I thank you for that."}
{"text":"Did the Groupon thing with no problems.  Had an early dinner on a Friday night... the place was eerily quiet.  It's in a basement.  My husband kept suggesting that it used to be a morgue (too much Ghost Adventures, clearly).  The decor is straight out of a nursing home (seriously, it is pretty creepy - pink cushions and fake mirrors?  ick).  

Luckily we were there for the food, which we definitely enjoyed.  The zucchini strips were a bit too thin, and I thought there would be some shellfish options with the Groupon deal, but oh well.  What we got was good.  The tiramisu was homemade and delicious.  The pasta sauces were good (maybe a little salty).  I don't know if we'll be back, but it was an overall enjoyable meal (excluding the potential ghosts, heinous decor, and total deadness on a Friday)."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Great lunch spot. Great service. I have had everything from grilled cheese, to spots, to chicken Romano and it had all been delish! The only negative thing I can say is that for some reason it always takes a really long time to get your check and get cashed out."}
{"text":"My friend and I ate here this week. I am in no way being dramatic but that is  the WORST food that I have ever had at a restaurant.  In reading previous reviews, I'm not sure if we just happened to come in on a bad night but that is no excuse. We were started with stuffed bell peppers that were certainly not freshly made...more like they were made at least a day prior and sprinkled with cayenne pepper to cover the tangy taste of a day old meal. Our waitress just plopped our appetizer and our bread on the table without saying a word as she proceeded to run frantically from table to table. Then we ordered our main courses, chicken parmesan and eggplant parmesan.  Both dishes looked and tasted as if they had been quickly microwaved.  The mozzarella cheese was one thick, stiff layer of cheese on very thin cuts of chicken and eggplant.  The pasta accompanying the entrees tasted like they used a bottle of Ragu marinara sauce.  And the dessert was definitely not genuine Italian tiramisu.  That was definitely mass produced/store bought Sarah Lee tiramisu.  On top of their horrendously poor attempt at Italian cuisine, the house wine, Woodbridge by Robert Mondavi was grossly overpriced.  A bottle of that wine normally costs about $6-9....one glass here was $7.00.  

The place was drabby and dimly lit.  The previous reviews referring to it as a \"storm cellar\" or comparing the \"experience\" to that of dining on the bottom floor of the Titanic were dead on.  It was claustrophobic and even more so with all 3 servers literally running from table to table and back and forth to and from the kitchen.

These people desperately need help from Chef Robert Irvine from Restaurant Impossible.  I think I might make the call myself on their behalf.

This was a huge disappoint.  I now know never to eat at a restaurant with 5 reviews or less, especially when more than half of those reviews are probably written by the owner and employees or by friends of the owners.  If those were genuine reviews (which I find extremely difficult to believe), the writers clearly have never had real freshly made italian cuisine or are lacking in taste.....buds."}
{"text":"I ate at this restaurant yesterday. It was delcious. It is right next to the bruggers bagel in the law and finance building. The food was amazing! We had the zuchinni app and each of us order the shrimp scampi it was amazing!! All of their sauces and salad dressings are homeade! Their bread was delcious! The service was outsranding! Our waitress was on her game. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Had dinner with coworkers while visiting in Pittsburgh and was amazed at the high quality of the food.  Our server was so friendly and the meal was superb.  Highly recommending this place and will be back another day!"}
{"text":"This has to be the absolutely best Italian Restaurant in the Pittsburgh area.  The food is so exceptional I had dinner there twice, in 4 days, during a one week stay.  The fried zucchini was the best ever.  The dinners were amazing.  We had Chicken Picata, Chicken Romano, Veal Parmesan, Spaghetti and Meatballs and Spaghetti with Vegan Marinara and fresh Mahi Mahi.  All diners agreed that they'd like to lick the plate!  The service was impeccable!  It's a BYOB restaurant so that makes this a more affordable spot if you want to have a drink with dinner.  Without alcohol it's minimally priced for the quantity and quality of food served.  Do yourself a favor and GO!  To the owners:  Let me know when you want to open on Maui!"}
{"text":"4.5 starts for the food, price, and service.
Although my Livingsocial Coupon expired months ago, they still kindly offered the original deal to me: $28 for 2 people including appetizer, entrees, and a dessert!
This place is definitely a hidden gem. Located in a basement a few blocks away from all the Downtown crowd, Storms is the kind of place one can never find out without Yelp. But once I found it, I feel I'll have to come back again.
Just be aware that they close very early (Mon-Fri 7pm)."}
{"text":"There are very few things that need to be analyzed when dining out, first - the service. Our waitress (Kat) was awesome. She is funny, personable and honest about the food. When a server helps you make selections based on their knowledge of their menu it helps enhance your experience. She was fantastic. Second - the food. While not mind blowing, it is great, hearty Italian fare. The wedding soup, fried zucchini and  piccata were all well prepared and portioned. I was very pleased with my meal.  Lastly - the environment. Granted the location is not prime (the basement feel is very noticeable) it's not something that would keep me from going back. Overall, great service, good food, good pricing - happy customer. :)"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! I live right up the street and I don't know how I haven't heard about this sooner. It just recently moved from downtown and I'm glad it's so close, it's my new favorite Italian restaurant!! I came for lunch and saw they had shrimp scampi and thought it came with pasta, which it didn't, but the chef was happy to add pasta in it for me; it was the best shrimp scampi I've ever had!! We also order the fried zucchini and the batter so so light and delicious :) I would highly recommend Storms Restaurant!"}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Service was great and the food was excellent! The people complaining about time in between courses obviously haven't been to Italy or an actual Italian resturant! This place was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband used the Groupon deal for Storm's. The deal couldn't get any better, $21 with a $7 discount for an appetizer, two entrees, and a dessert. The food was divine! We started off with the delicious brushetta and zucchini appetizer. I ordered the Penne Scalo, which was a penne pasta with a spicy creamy tomato sauce and tender pieces of sausage with sauteed mushrooms. The sauce was so good I was tempted to even save the rest in a to-go box. My husband ordered the chicken picatta, which was just as good with vegetables. Our meals came with a side so I decided on a salad and my husband choose the beef barley soup. Plus, our waitress gave us some french bread and an oil to dip the bread in with our meal. By the time we finished our meal, we were stuffed to the brim and had to take our tiramisu in a to-go box. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who craves a place with superb Italian-American crusine."}
{"text":"I have had lunch at Storms several times and dinner only once. It is a great lunch spot for business people and town shoppers that know where to find it. Storms is located on 4th street, in the basement of the Law & Finance Building. 
I enjoy the Fried Zucchini, it's so light and crisp batter makes it a nice appetizer to any meal. I like the ranch dressing to the marinara. I also like ordering the Wedding Soup. I mostly order the salads for lunch. 
I like the Grilled Chicken - with the mixed greens, I am not a huge Iceberg lettuce person and I make sure they mean, mixed greens when ordering. The peppers and mushrooms and French fries are a wonderful addition to any salad.  I will also order the Chicken Caesar Salad and ask for a side of fries. I like the Walnut Apple Salad in the summer with the salmon and sliced apples. If you're looking for a great lunch salad, you won't be disappointed when ordering it at Storms. 
Storms offers lunch specials and discounts when you can find them. 
The service at Storms has always been great. Friendly and prompt no matter how busy the place may be. I have never had a bad meal or experience. It's a great off the beaten path out of the way place to relax with friends or co-workers for a great lunch. Prices are very reasonable. Highly Recommend !!"}
{"text":"Love love love the food and service. I've been eating here and catering outside business lunches for many years with Rob, Bill, Michelle and others and have NEVER been disappointed. There's a vowel at the end of my name that makes me an expert in Italian food. Believe me. Storms is the real deal."}
{"text":"Really great Italian food! It's BYOB which is awesome. The staff is super nice and friendly and your food comes out quickly as well. The restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"Good italian food. $14 sounded expensive for pasta at first but when i tried them they are not like one of those from olive garden. Had lots of flavor. Service was great too. The place was not too busy and it was nice atmosphere to relax w my GF. Will come back."}
{"text":"I have eaten here several times and they also cater many of my works events.  Every time I have had their food I have been very impressed.

The fried zucchini is the best I have ever had.  It is a very light batter, but has a great taste to it.  My favorite dish when I eat inside is the chicken romano.  Everything tastes fresh and is cooked to perfection.  The batter on the chicken is delicious.  You also get a hint of lemon flavor in every bite.

They also have great catering options.  Some of my favorites I have had at work events include the lasagna, pulled pork, and chicken tenders.  So much better than when we just get cold sandwiches for events."}
{"text":"A dear co-worker of mine was retiring at the tender age of 96 after 75 years of employment here. We had the retirement party down at Storms. Another employee who organized the party gave us options to fill out... soup or salad, 3 entrees to choose from and then cake.

For the appetizer, I had the wedding soup. For my entree I had the chicken picatta and sauteed veggies. For dessert, everyone had the chocolate mousse cake. Also, at the beginning of the meal, fried zucchini was brought out as an appetizer.

The main reason for my 5 star review is for the staff. There were 4 servers working on our party. Drinks were never empty, plates were cleared asap and they were always available if we needed something.

Everyone enjoyed their time and meal."}
{"text":"I don't think we ever would have tried this place (or knew it existed) if not for a friend buying us a groupon to try a three course dinner for two. 

The location of this restaurant is in the basement of a law office that only stays open until 7pm. So if you are hoping to get dinner, you need to be in the building by 6:45pm. 

The decor and overall feel of the restaurant is very dated but clean. 

It was only my husband and I and one other small group in the whole restaurant. This seems like such a waste with their nice size bar. I'm guessing they see most of their business during the lunch hours. 

Our dinner ended up being delicious. The appetizers were the stars of the show. The fried zucchini was perfect; lightly breaded and cut extremely thin. The bruschetta was also delicious but not what I normally consider as bruschetta. 

My husband had one of the three specials for his entree and I tried the English spots. I like that the chef includes the specials as an option when using the groupon. 

We only saw one employee the whole evening and she was great! Extremely personable."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time.  Came in at Dinner rush with no reservation and it was crowded.  I was seated right away and we were waited on quickly.  I had the pork chop which was possibly the best I ever had.  I also had the Italian Wedding soup which was the best I have had.  My wife had the chicken Romano and loved it.  We will be back often!"}
{"text":"Came here for a nice fancy dinner, of course with the Groupon like many others have. We had some weird issues with reservations--it's the holiday season so it's expectedly busy, but when we tried to call in to make a reservation they were somewhat rude and just hung up the phone and asked. Well then, we just decided to go when they opened for dinner and hope for the best. Unbeknownst to us, they do have a bar area which was partially open, and they also had a small booth which they gave to us without any hassle, which luckily made the trek worth it.

At the restaurant itself, service was generally nice and friendly and didn't show any trace of the rudeness over the phone, so things were fine with that. We went with the zucchini and bruchetta appetizer, which as others have noted was so crispy and savory. Think zucchini tempura but not in a cheese-coated and not so batter-y way. 

For the entrees, we tried each of the two veal dishes, one picatta and one scallopini. The meat was tender and delicious, and the sauce for both paired nicely. The accompanying vegetables (mushrooms for one, peppers and onions for the other) were great as well. Portion size felt a bit smaller than other restaurants of this caliber, but that was just as well since I was more than full at the end. For dessert, they sadly didn't have the tiramisu, but the chocolate mousse that they offered instead was a suitable substitute. Overall a perfect meal at a nice restaurant!"}
{"text":"First time here and definitely won't be the last!   Service was exceptional and food was over the top delish.   Only reason for the 4 stars is I just felt the ambiance was a little off .... no music and I think more sound buffers are needed because it was on the loud side.   But that was small compared to the service and food ... which is what you go out to eat for, right 
It's byob so we took our own bottle and they provided glasses and a chiller.   Had the fried zucchini for an app which was amazing!!!  The breading was so light and airy and the marinara sauce for dipping was tasty.   Hubs had the greens and beans and devoured them.  I also had the Cesar salad ,,, served like a wedge and full of flavor.  
For an entree, I had the veal Picatta .... my mouth is watering just typing this!   Sooooo good!   Hubby had half portions of each of the pasta dinners ~ spaghetti & Meatballs and the Diablo.   He was a fan of both! 
Can't wait to go back to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Loved the bread and fried zucchini appetizer, it was served very thin with a light coat for crunch. I ordered the Apple walnut salad with seared salmon, and it was amazing! I added blue cheese and it completed the dish for me. I came during lunch while at a conference, and I had no worries for time because they were on top of the orders."}
{"text":"To be honest, the more I come here, the more I love it.  And the more I love that it doesn't look like much.  

For $12 you get a salad, side of veggies and your entree.  The chicken varieties (with banana peppers, piccata, marsala) are all uniformally excellent.  

+1 star from last review."}
{"text":"I'd dare say this is one of the better kept secrets in downtown Pittsburgh.  As someone who's visited for lunch on several occasions, I find the prices reasonable, the staff attentive and friendly, and the food terrific!

I highly suggest the Chicken Romano.  You can get a decent portion with salad, veggies/pasta, and delicious bread for about $10.

The atmosphere is a little dark, but it takes me back to the little neighborhood haunt that emphasizes quality over ambience.  That's a tradeoff I have no problem making."}
{"text":"The atmosphere and hours of this place leave a lot to be desired, but the food makes up for it!  Everything is made from scratch in-house.  We buy the groupon for the 3 course meal every time it's offered and haven't been disappointed yet.  Their marinara sauce is amazing!  We keep bringing friends and co-workers with us each visit, and no one has been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"I ate here last night with my fiance for dinner.  Having never been to the restaurant before I found it to be in an odd location in the basement of the Pittsburgh Finance building.  We arrived at around 6 and were greeted by extreme quiet as we made our way to the hostess station.  Within a minute the hostess was there and greeted us asking if we had a Groupon or Living Social deal which we did not.  She then took us around to our seats where there was some more noise and people.  Since Storms is in the basement of the building, the lighting wasn't that great but the white table cloths and plants made it feel more inviting.  Don't expect to get any good cell phone service either which can be both a good and a bad thing depending on how you are looking at it.

For dinner I decided to have the Chicken Piccata with a side of pasta and a salad with balsamic vinaigrette while my fiance went with the Scoglio (Sauteed shrimp, sea scallops and chopped clams) and a cup of wedding soup.  The soup and salad came out quickly along with some bread and butter.  My salad was decent enough with the dressing being good but I really enjoyed the bread.  It was rustic, hearty and dense which was perfect for dipping into the leftover sauce from dinner.  As we were finishing our starters, the waitress came over to my fiance and informed her that she was just told by the cooks that they were out of scallops.  She was exasperated by the fact that they hadn't told her until after she had put in the order but reassured my fiance that she would get extra shrimp in her meal instead of the scallops.  After only a short wait our food was delivered.  My chicken piccata was solid with a nice semi tart lemon sauce with capers and mushrooms.  The pasta (penne) that I received was ok as well but it was nothing special. Even though I did not ask my fiance if she enjoyed her meal I could tell that she did as she ate all of the pasta sauce, even after the pasta was gone.  Since I finished before my fiance the server cleaned off my plate and then things at the table behind us got a little weird.  From what I gathered the lady had an expired groupon and ordered two meals expecting to be able to use the full value of the groupon.  Whenever she was not able to, she stood up and went to the front.  Our server went there to help her and then I am not really sure what happened.  The reason that I am mentioning this is that we proceeded to wait about 20 minutes before our server showed up again which was frustrating as we were long done with our meals by then.  She did apologize and while I do not put the whole blame on the server, I do think that she could have managed it and us in a more timely fashion and wish that she would have.

The bottom line for me is that I would probably stop back here again in the future.  While there was nothing spectacular about the food, it was solid Italian food and on its own would have garnered 3 stars.  The issue with waiting for quite a long time after we were finished bumped down the overall rating for me as it was an experience I hope to not have repeated again."}
{"text":"I'm going to stay I think 4 stars for an Italian restaurant means it's some pretty good Italian food. Maybe my grandma spoils me, but the 4 star rating for this place is kind of extreme. 

We came in with a party of 13 for a work lunch. It's a pretty large space and they aren't new to the game so enough staff shouldn't be a problem. It kinda was, my drink was empty 85% of the time and when they would fill it with water they just kept putting more and more ice till it was an entire thing of ice and so little water i would be out after one drink. It wasn't only me, the majority of the table was lacking drinks the whole time. Yes it's a big party but again, this isn't new to them. 

For the meal, I will say I liked the flavor of my Chicken Romano but the portions were SO off. 5 of us got the same thing and none of them were even close to the same size. Mine was half the size of my coworkers so we ended up swapping one piece of each other's. I get that chicken is different sizes but I mean they shouldn't be that different when everyone's paying the same thing. 

I very much enjoyed the appetizers of zucchini and stuffed banana peppers, those were probably the best part. 

Decor is super dated and not in a homey Italian type of way. 

I'd probably go back for appetizers during lunch or something, but I wouldn't say it's anything to write home about"}
{"text":"Took our office coordinator here for Admin Professional's Day (a day late....oops!) and was pleasantly surprised.  

Storms is kind of off the beaten path.  You don't exactly see it at first as it sits between a law office and a parking lot and the door is to the right instead of straight off the street.  Open the door, walk down a flight of stairs, and you're in a basement restaurant!  I imagine back in the days where number writers ruled the streets this was probably a cool place to slip into.

My meal of choice on this visit was the chicken piccata.  It came with a side of veggies or pasta (I had the squash) and soup or a salad (I chose the salad).   The side salad was nice and the squash was well, squash.  I can't get too excited over squash.

I'm pretty satisfied with my choice of chicken piccata.  Honestly, it was cooked to perfection with a delicious wine sauce and sprinkled with capers.  A lot of food for lunch, but worth it.

I shared a piece of \"Death By Chocolate\" cake with my colleague and we both enjoyed it immensely.  I'm now in a food coma, but a happy one."}
{"text":"This is always a work favorite. They do take out too. I always get the farlanese which is a creamy plum sauce. Just get it trust me. There eggplant parm is always crispy and so flavorful. The portions are bigger, I can not ever finish it all. It's a heavy lunch as well."}
{"text":"I also did the Groupon thing one Friday night, and did not have any problems.
As others have stated, the decor is something to be desire, but I feel the service and food make up for it.
Our waitress was great. Attentive and had a good knowledge of the menu. On her suggestion we tried the stuffed banana peppers and was not disappointed. 
Both of our meals were delicious. Definitely no complaints about the food.
I will definitely be back here. I think this is a little gem that is judged too harshly for decor."}
{"text":"The chicken Parmesan was uh-may-zing! Chef even made a fantastic veal malanaise for my friend, even though it wasn't on the menu. They may not spend much on decor, but whatever they're saving, it must go straight into the deliciousness that is their food. Plus, our waitress (Billy) was just as excellent."}
{"text":"There are restaurants that haven't changed in twenty or thirty years that make you happy they haven't changed a whit....take you back to warm fuzzy memories and a happy tummy.  Sadly, Storms is not one of those. Dingy, dark, freezing cold interior, in the cellar of a drab gray downtown building, maybe that was the inspiration for the name of Storms.... a storm cellar?

Despite the name change, this is still the old Scoglio's with a new name in the same old place...emphasis on old.  Not a lightbulb, not an artificial flower on the table, not a piece of flatware, not a fresh coat of paint or mirrored wall has changed since the seventies. Depressing, folks.

Now the food.  On the positive side, fellow diners enjoyed the fried zucchini starter.  And that is where we probably should have stopped, at the start.  Salads were  small plates of a few slightly limp spring greens mixed with a lot of iceberg lettuce, a few shreds of carrot, two thin purple onions rings, half a wrinkled grape tomato and five (yes, I counted them) garbanzo beans.  

My lemon chicken with peppers consisted of two tiny, thin pan sauteed chicken breasts topped with what I actually believe were warmed, jarred, pickled banana peppers in a pile on top of the chicken with a lemon cream sauce over all.  Not completely objectionable, but not something I would order again.  Ever.  It came with a side of oily, dilled, bitter zucchini.  The other dishes at the table were received similarly and nothing but the fried zucchini appetizer drew comments above mediocre.  

I guess it is true, you can't go back again.  The only reason I would go back would be if I were walking by and actually needed a storm cellar.  Then, and only then, would Storms be my port in a storm."}
{"text":"I just visited this restaurant for the first time.  It used to be located downtown but relocated to the suburbs recently.  A friend of mine asked if we could meet there for lunch.  It is located in a very small plaza that I had never been to before.  Let me say first and foremost that the best thing about this restaurant is the service.  It was hands down some of the best service that I have ever received in a restaurant.  The menu looked very promising.  It had a lot of entrees that I really like.  Then I heard the specials and knew exactly what I wanted-the Salmon Piccata.  I chose to have wedding soup along with it.  First to our table was a nice basket of bread.  I nibbled on it until my friend go there.  It was very fresh.  My friend recommended that we order the Fried Zucchini as an appetizer.  When it came to the table it was a mountain of zucchini.  It was fried in a very very light breading.  It was crispy and the perfect consistency for the zucchini.  We were also given a bowl of marinara sauce.  It was very good.  It was a nice blend of seasonings.  It didn't require any tweaking with salt, pepper, or anything.  It wasn't too tomato-y.  It was perfect the way it was served.  The portion was so huge that we only ate half and took the rest to go.  Unfortunately I took the picture after we had eaten a bit of it so you don't get to see how big it really is.  I would definitely recommend it as well as order it again.  My wedding soup came and it was a great temperature-hot but not too hot to eat.  The stock is very flavorful.  Again, no need to add any salt or pepper.  There were a lot of little meatballs and bits of shredded chicken.  I would order it as part of my lunch or dinner.  It's a definite winner in my book.  Then my salmon came to the table.  It was not cooked as a piccata.  Instead it came out prepared differently.  My server offered to take it back and have it remade but it looked nice so I decided to eat it as it was prepared.  The salmon was cooked nicely.  It was a bit much with the amount of roasted red peppers it had so I pushed some of them to the side.  We didn't have dessert because we were too full.  I will go back soon to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"Hidden little gem in downtown. Only open M-F until 7 pm so it's challenging to do dinner. Pasta dish was really delicious and the service was quick and friendly. Tasty Italian food."}
{"text":"The best kept secret in Pittsburgh!   Don't tell anybody.......but the food here is fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"I was just here today on a whim...felt like eating down town so I chose this spot again...of course I had a groupon so me and my hubby went..this experience was much better than the last..

The atmosphere was a lot better, quieter, the folks at the bar weren't as loud as they were before so that was nice..this time I ordered the eggplant diavlo which comes in a red sauce with spicy hot sausage sliced and with peppers and onions..it was supposed to be eggplant part but I spiced it up a bit. My dish was such a large portion. So of course I couldn't finish it all but the eggplant was crispy and not over saturated plus the extra toppings made it more of a hearty meal than just veggies and sauce. 

My hubby ordered the veal scallopini as seen in the picture...the sauce was very good, had a classic Marsala flavor too it...the veal was very tender just like chicken and it was moist...I enjoyed my dish a little better only because of how hearty it was..the veal should have had a little more veggies to go along with the sauce.

This time for dessert I ordered tiramisu instead if cheesecake which was great!! They have a layer of lady fingers topped with nearly 2 inches if thick whip cream and chocolate drizzle. It was so soft and creamy , not too sweet and so delicious...we loved it sooo much that my hubby tried To convince me I didn't like it so that I woul stop eating...too bad the groupon was only for one dessert otherwise i would have ordered another.

The food prep definitely changed my mind and the service was good as well..our waiter was very kind not to mention he also prepared our drinks..I had a White Russian and he had a Cosmo...hey some men like sweet drinks so don't judge.

Definitely check this place out if u get a chance...it's a warm environment that's pretty peaceful with good quality food and service.."}
{"text":"Terrible food, service and no windows because you're in the basement.    I went for lunch with two co workers and food was average or below average (my first two choices were 'sold out').   Service was terrible - my co-worker never got his cheese and pork soup (fine by me, sounds really gross).   Table linens were cheap.   I wouldn't go back if it was free."}
{"text":"Well, I loved it!  All woody and cozy down in the basement. Good Italian maybe I should say Pittsburgh Italian. Anyway, the kind I like. Decent smallish wine list. Truly great chicken piccata!!  Nice salad. Side of pasta. Attentive wait staff after an bit of a wait at the front. Everyone seemed pleased. I'll bet that lovely bar is a fun place to be at lunchtime!!  Certainly plan to return. Wish they were open a little longer in the evening."}
{"text":"I visited Saturday night with a group of 8. Our reservation was for 8 o'clock but we got seated at 8:50 PM and the restaurant gave us fried zucchini and sausage casserole to compensate which was outstanding. I got the veal piccata which was the best I've ever had. The food was outstanding and the service was efficient.  We were all pleased.  Don't miss this place. Probably best to go during the week as it is busy on weekends. The place is small.   I'll return for sure. Best thing, it's a BYOB with no cork fee!!! So your bill won't shock you."}
{"text":"I decided that I needed a little pick-me-up lunch around the holiday time so I treated myself to a lunch at Storms Restaurant.  I'm old enough to remember when this same space was the Three Lions Restaurant back in the 1980's. Whew!  The Three Lions Restaurant was memorable because it was one of my first exposures to a \"white tablecloth\" restaurant and I thought that I was ballin' and shot callin\" by going there.

Fast forward  and I have been to a few restaurants since then and I know what \"true\" white tablecloth restaurants are now,  Storms ain't that, but it is a comfortable \"My house is your house\" restaurant.  You know that type of place where the waitress calls you \"Hon\" and you don't mind because that's the way they roll...

I decided not to eat in one of my employer's cafeterias one day and decided to go to Storms for lunch.  Chicken Marsala, pasta side with olive oil and garlic, side salad and Italian bread.  Nothing fancy, just solid \"ole school\" Italian mom and pop food.  Everything was served promptly, hot and without much ado.  I appreciated that and the food cost less than a comparable meal at my cafeteria.  I actually enjoyed my meal without pretenses.  Some times, that's just all that you need."}
{"text":"Used the WPXI hot card and could pick anything from the Dinner Menu- 
after 5 the parking drops to $5 at nearby garages.
Food was great.  Not crowded at all for dinner. Will definitely we back for a low key evening.
I had the spots (fish) - delicious.  Price do-able with discount.

Warning- closes at 7."}
{"text":"Outstanding food. Make sure you have a reservation because it is on the smaller size. Portions fair sized. You won't  leave hungry. One of the better sauces we have had. Will go again."}
{"text":"Stumbling in from the cold night Alison and I were kind of confused when we first stepped into the Lobby of what couldn't look less like a restaurant. But a door to the Right leads you down the stairs and before you know it the left side opens up to a dark wooden bar facing across to what is an otherwise bland looking restauraunt. We were seated in a booth and quickly brought menus. The beer menu was not impressive so I went with a Gin and Tonic which was delicious. Alison went with a glass of house wine I don't like wine or know anything about it but it was white and she seemed happy with it. 

We got the Fried Zuchinni and Bruschetta as our appetizers. The Zuchinni was the best I have ever had, lightly breaded and crisp. You could tell the ingredients were fresh. The bruschetta was also quite delicious but it was definitely overshadowed by the Zuchinni. As soon as the plates were empty they were removed and my broccoli cheddar soup had arrived. The soup was okay, fresh but a little too thin I like my soup creamy. 

Again the service was impeccable as my Chicken Marsala arrived within 15 minutes of sitting down. The pasta side dish was very good but the chicken was just okay. The sauce was on the sparse end and the chicken a little dry. 

We finished the meal off with Tiramasu and my inner foodie was satisfied. We had the groupon so our meal cost $28+drinks and tip. Leaving with a bill under $50 made paying for downtown parking a little less painful. I will definitely return to this hidden gem and next time sit at the bar. Look for that groupon it's a semi-regular feature."}
{"text":"This was my first lunch visit with a girlfriend. I checked Groupon and noticed that the online deal is for dinner only and is for an Italian meal.

Upon entry into an office building you turn right and then head down a long staircase to get to the restaurant. Reservations are a must and when I arrived I could see why. The place was packed! Fortunately we did have a reservation and we seated across the bar in a booth.

I would say the dress code is business casual since I saw some professionals along with others without suits. We were given prompt and courteous service. I learned that the spots were the popular menu choice so I opted for that along with the soup of the day which was wedding and a zucchini tomato blend as a vegetable. My girlfriend had the eggplant Parmesan covered with shrimp and chicken.

The soup was good and the spots were covered with crabcake-the real deal! The meal wasn't too filling and they served bread on the side. They made sure our drinks were always filled and cleared away our finished plates promptly. 

They specialize in Italian food but they have other items such as the spots I really enjoyed.  They do have a bar but no Wi Fi. Reception is not the greatest but no big deal when you are dining with friends.

I truly enjoyed my luncheon and will return again."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre.  Actually, it tasted like a really good Italian Lean Cuisine.  But what I'm really interested in discussing is my waitress/bartender.  She scared me.  I mean...she caused me such unreasonable apprehension I lost my appetite.  I don't believe in discrimination, but if you're gonna hire former heavy weight wrestlers as servers, the food should be amazing.  And it wasn't.  

It was....Ok.

Also, I felt like I was dining in the bottom floor of the Titanic.  The restaurant is a dimly lit, cheesy cruise ship type feel, with no windows. 

We didn't sink though."}
