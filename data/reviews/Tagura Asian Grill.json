{"text":"Decent Japanese/Korean fast food. Similar in style to Chin's, although a tad more authentic. If you're out shopping at Greenway Station, this would be a good place to stop for lunch (it's across the street from Bucatini and TGI Friday's)."}
{"text":"I love it! Seems like \"healthier\" chinese food. I always get shrimp fried rice with the brown rice, and YUM! Not greasy at all. Cheap, generous portions. My kids love the chicken teriyaki with the two side choices of fruit (melons, grapes) and veggies (green and red pepper chunks, broccoli, carrots slices).  I just love the choice of brown rice. Tastes great, and much better for you...."}
{"text":"One liner:  Overpriced small bowls of Asian food.  Ordered the Pad Thai. The noodles were overly cooked and completely broken.  It was a disaapointment at best.  The other thing I had issue with was the price.  Way too high for the small bowl of food I got for it. The woman at the counter was very nice and very cheerful.  If not for her, this would have gotten a 1=star."}
{"text":"Where to start...?  I read reviews for this place on other sites and most people said it was atrocious.  Prepared for the worst but still enticed by the thought of quick Korean food and a sense of adventure.  Overall, it's not as bad as others have made it out to be and I will go back.  The food is a combination of Korean and Japanese and there is a limited number of menu choices.  Think McDonald's as far as breadth goes.  You can either get an entree which is a big portion of meat and double rice or a bento box which is a single portion of meat, rice, and two sides.  Otherwise you can get stuff ala carte.    I tried the Bulgogi Beef Bento box.  The brown rice was pretty blah.  They don't cook it with salt.  The vegetable gyoza were not that good.  The filling had the texture of paste and didn't taste like any vegetable imaginable.  They are fried not steamed BTW.  The gyoza sauce was good.  It was a little spicy and the flavor had depth.  For my other side I tried the miso soup.  It was good and refreshing but unlike most miso soups found elsewhere.  It was too seaweedy and the tofu was mushy.  The different elements didn't blend as well as should be the case in miso soup.  Still good and refreshing though.  The bulgogi beef is one of their three specialties.  I've had bulgogi beef in Korea and this was close.  There wasn't much sauce and it was a little spicier than what I had in Korea but the flavor was very good.  The quality of the meat, however, was atrocious.  Very low quality and they didn't bother removing sinews and tendons.  Ugh.  The lack of quality in the meat was something also mentioned in the other reviews I read.  Service:  The person who took our order was very friendly and courteous.  She took the time to answer questions and was knowledgeable about the items on the menu."}
{"text":"I hate to give a bad review but I tried this place twice.  My first visit included a variety of appetizers. I had the crab ragoon, a sushi roll and a side salad. It was decent, nothing I couldn't live without, but checked out the rest of the menu and planned on coming back. .   The second time I purchased the galbi to go. I was disappointed with the amount of meat on the beef ribs as well as the lacking of a distinct flavor.     I will not return unless someone drags me."}
{"text":"Their fried rice probably gets five stars (they actually make the best fried brown rice I've ever had); their Korean specialties aren't bad; skip everything else."}
