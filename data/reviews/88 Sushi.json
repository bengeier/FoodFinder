{"text":"Good place. We tried seven or eight different dishes and shared them all so the both of us could get a good idea of what the chefs could create. We were not disappointed with any of them. I am a sashimi lover and the next time I am in the neighborhood I check out their offerings on that side."}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, wonderful service in a clean modern establishment. The all you can eat is a great deal, but a la carte is reasonable as well. It took less than 10 minutes to place my order, pay and have it ready to go. 

I dine here almost every weekend, and if not eat in I take to go or order delivery"}
{"text":"Service a little slow and not many items on menu but all that is made up since it is cheap.   Place is nice and clean and we'll decorated.   Another bonus,  they don't add additional fees for weekend or holidays."}
{"text":"Went here recently since I heard a lot of great things about Hockey Sushi.  We went for dinner.  Pop was included with the meal. What was great about the pop was it was in the can, not the watered-down fountain type at most AYCEs.

I'm wary with most AYCEs; the fish quality is normally terrible because of the price points.  Hockey's fish was really good.  The cuts of fish for sashimi are generous.  

I didn't try any of the makis, but had the spicy tuna and salmon sushi. Those were really good.

My husband hated the fried scallop (tasted weird apparently).  The beef rolls (two types green onion and enoki) were great.

The shrimp tempura was freshly made, which also had the right amount of batter.

My husband who loves pork katsu really like the one they had."}
{"text":"So i went today to try it out as a lot of my friends said it was really good and the reviews seem decent..but what i got was something that made me never want to go back. Here is what is wrong with this place:
1. Service is horrible. Usually i would be able to take bad service but this place was just rude. The waitress are rude with their dirty looks and the way they put down plates as well as how they clean it up. Every 5 minutes all u here is *bam bam* as plates get thrown on to tables and into cleaning carts. seriously it made u think they had anger issues or something
2.Sushi was not good. Now when is sushi I do not mean the sashimi I mean anything that had rice. especially the rolls. I would never go back here to eat their roll, they barely fit into my mouth and they were just badly made. You could see the clump of space that was just taken up by rice in the roll. Just bad and filling the the wrong way.
3.Tempura was just nasty. Usually i do not expect much from tempura but this was just not good...cuts of vegetables were huge and the aftertaste that i got from it just told me that they used old oil to deep fry it. Also it wasn't crispy after 5 minutes. It got to the point that i didnt care if they charged me for wasting, i just couldnt stomach anymore.
Now there were some good things like some of their appetizers and teh dessert (but its not like they made the ice cream so u know...) but they were enough to make me want to go back."}
{"text":"The service was absolutely mortifying!!!! The meal was mediocre so you'd expect the service to help supplement for the mediocre food. No, not the case at all. The treatment was so poor and the staff made you feel like you were an inconvenience when in fact if it wasn't for the customers they would have no place of business. They need to fix their disgusting attitudes as I'm sure eventually people will go to another sushi restaurant down the street for the same price just for better service. I see no reason for me to return again. 
Price of food: overpriced for quality
Service: below standards
Atmosphere: nothing special
If I could give the rating a zero I would but yelp forces you to at least give a one star rating."}
{"text":"My wife and I went here for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon around 130 in the afternoon so it wasn't very busy at all. I would estimate approximately maybe 10 to 12 people there so that means but 5 to 6 tables are occupied so by no means was it busy. Now I have to be upfront first and foremost the service here ranks in the bottom 10% of all restaurant I have ever been to. First off none of the  employees that we had dealt with appeared to be happy. This included the greeter, the waitress, the server, or the cashier. However I can't speak to the sushi chefs whom I didn't turn to look at. Now to the good part.

The food what impeccably fresh. The sushi was fresh, the sushi rice was cool and not hot like in some other all you can eat places, the tempura was so fresh and fluffy, that it was incredibly filling.

In regards to the food though my issues were : anything that was traditionally supposed to be grilled  was deep fried.  an example is the chicken skewers which I take as chicken yakitori . Now don't get me wrong it was tasty however I'm use to grill chicken as opposed to deep fry chicken without batter. Another example what's the grilled salmon belly it was deep fried is well but it was still pretty good although a little greasy. The other issue I had is that the ran out of sushi items mainly surf clam and red snapper. I mean what kind of restaurant runs out of items in the middle of the day? 
 
 I would like to give this restaurant a much higher rating probably around 4 stars. However due to the poor service (you honestly feel unwelcome the way the staff treats and looks at you), the deep frying of traditionally grilled items, the unavailability of  common sushi items in the middle of the day bring this down to 2 stars. 
 
One additional note to save money; if you go on to their website you can print a coupon for 10 percent off the total bill provided that you pay in cash (debit not applicable).  As of today the coupon online is good until December 2013.

Cheers and happy eating!"}
{"text":"The price is low but it's still not worth it. 

The menu isn't that impressive but it does have some interesting items like the golden California roll. I had called in advance to confirm if there's holiday pricing and was told that there wasn't but they still tried to charge extra and we had to nearly walk out to get the regular price we'd been told.

The service is abysmal, we were actually the only customers with the servers and after 10 minutes we got up and went to the counter to get a pop. 

They make the food extra filling (tiny slice of tuna with a lot of tempura in the spicy tuna roll) and everything is watered down to the point that the wasabi is barely spicy. The pop is canned though so at least that isn't a disappointment.

They are getting new management so maybe things will change but with the plethora of great sushi places in the area, pay the extra dollar or two to go somewhere better."}
{"text":"Bought voucher from wagjag.com thinking that it would be basicly $19 for two adults per table. Upon showing the voucher they said voucher would only be for 8 dish. We had bought 3 vouchers for our family. Referred another for my cousin. So basicly we argued with the manager for awhile, spoiling the dinning mood for our family get together. We ended up paying for additional 3 AYCE. Dishes were brought out in different orders, ie: salad came near the end, several dishes were forgotten and we had to request for it. This restaurant is nothing compared to Wasbe in Markham. We came back a second time and they served our orders all mess up again. Portion from a la carte were meant for someone on diet. I requested no onion for one dish and it came full with it. My toddler end up eating the seafood udon fried by himself."}
{"text":"AYCE sushi: Great food, excellent quality, reasonable prices. $35 for two for Saturday lunch incl. 20% tip."}
{"text":"Food is not bad * I enjoyed the curry chicken skewers, spicy salmon and tuna, siumai, and a few other things. I loved watching one of the owners running around the restaraunt * it was like watching amazing race during a challenge. 

The customer service was a little cold as per usual with sushi places * and I noticed people getting a bit confused and annoyed, but the waitress did apologies at the end saying they were short of staff 

Great place to spend $14 for lunch and get your eat on 

...as I'm writing this, the dude is still running around. You're basically getting lunch and a show"}
{"text":"Best sushi and chicken teriyaki in all Brampton, they changed their name to 88 sushi but trust me it is the great same old sushi"}
{"text":"Went for my birthday after seeing an amazing coupon for \"birthday diner eats free with party of 4 or more\". Upon completion of the meal (mediocre rolls served with warm rice and about 1.5 inch HUGE diameter) went to pay and presented the coupon...

The manager said \"we took that promotion off the window 2 days ago\" and that they no longer honour it. But the coupon was still available on their website. 

After about 10 minutes of talking to him he made it quite clear that he would not go or the coupon or do anything to make up for it. I notice that there was also a 10% off if you pay in cash policy online. But he wouldn't honour it without a printout of the coupon.... Showing him it on our phone was apparently not enough.

I will never go back to this location as there are much higher quality sushi places in the area for the same price with MUCH better management."}
{"text":"After a frustrating 15-minute wait and being turned down at Prince Sushi as they were too busy to accomodate, Hockey really saved the day for me. I visited for the 3rd time and was not disappointed.

 Despite it being AYCE, the price is really reasonable (especially on a weeknight) and the sashimi is not fishy (especially salmon, it was fresh... yay!). I am also a fan of their avocado salad, dragon and spider rolls (esp. black and green dragon), and their udon comes in a reasonably-sized bowl (not a giant bowl to fill you up as other AYCE establishments have done). I also like that their rolls come in 4s and not 8s which makes it easier to finish and easier to try different menu items. Oh yes, extensive menu list with many choices - which is always great for AYCE.

Some downfalls though are: the breaded scallop was not favourably received by my party, ordered red tuna sushi and found the tuna extremely fishy and nasty (might be because its not commonly ordered..?), service was a bit inattentive as I had to constantly flag the waiter for more tea, the rolls have packed on more rice since I first went to Hockey...

Overall, quite satisfied every time I went and felt for the price, the food lives up to standards. Will return, especially on a weeknight."}
{"text":"Thought I would try Hockey Sushi today. The food was OK and was significantly better than the disastrous meal I had at Tokyo Maki Sushi on the weekend. Everything I tried was edible. The spicy crab roll came as advertised. Unlike TMS, the kitchen items were not overcooked. The menu was not very adventurous, but they had the basics covered.

The service was OK. The interior design is OK. There is nothing special about the place; however I can't say anything bad either. Overall, it is an OK neighborhood sushi joint."}
{"text":"Food was good and so was service. Nothing special though. The flavours are just better at other places. Lots of seats and parking."}
{"text":"not impressed.

the service sucked 
the server wasn't nice
there was a bad smell where we were sitting 
you get poor service when you do an a la carte option 

I will not return."}
{"text":"Best word to describe this establishment is ~confusion~. Previously named Hockey Sushi with Cantonese-speaking staff that stopped by to chat a bit. Now named 88 sushi with a Mandarin speaking staff who mostly hide behind counters chatting amongst themselves but kind of awkwardly look your way to see whether you are suffocating or still alive and normally eating.

I think the staff and new owner here is still quite confused as to whether they are still Hockey or now 88. It feels like its a blend of both, tbh. They still use the old reward card, with a totally not noticeable (lol) sticker slapped on it, the same website, and on said website, and the same 2015-stamped 10% cash coupon they have totally neglected to update. Btw, they told me about my coupon being expired when I went like yesterday, and I tried explaining that I had used the coupon before. They seemed to not believe me, but my Mandarin-speaking friend explained it in Mandarin and maybe he was super charismatic or something but they were clearly convinced and suddenly my coupon related problems had been solved. That wasn't the first time they looked at my coupon in complete confusion, as if it was written in Latin or something.

Well, let's talk about food. Salmon, I noticed this time (in my salmon sushi) was very thinly sliced. So much that you had to eat 2 - 3 pieces of sushi to taste the salmon once. Well I was unhappy about that since I came to satisfy my deep craving for salmon, but honestly there's no place I could find cheaper and with better quality and I was already there so like any other human I just consumed more salmon sushi to compensate for the lack of salmon on each piece. Hopefully next time my salmon isn't transparent and actually has a bit of thickness so there's something to bite. Other foods eel sushi, tonkatsu, chicken teriyaki, chicken skewer (which looks and tastes like barbecued pork but it's chicken lol), chicken wings, miso soup, salads, and other stuff are all good. Meat is lean, flavor is strong, taste is good. BTW, do yourself a favour and don't eat the kimchi, it's super sour (unless you like that sort of thing).

Main reason I continue to come here because its cheap ($16 or $15 I forget, with a 10% off coupon, and with points you can redeem to get a free lunch or dinner) and excluding this time, the food is good and the salmon sushi is tasty (yes my life's major concern is salmon). If there were a cheaper or thicker-sliced-salmon place in the area, I would definitely go there, but there isn't, so I'm here. I don't want to sell this place short though, the food is really good. I'll continue to come back unless I just get fed up with thin salmon at sushi restaurants and decide to live in the ocean to eat salmon fully raw like a savage. That or if something better comes along."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worse customer service that I have EVER experienced. The waitresses were rude and unprofessional. As a group, we arrived at 2:50 and some are expected to arrive a little bit later. When we sat down. the waitress said friends that are arriving later would be charged with dinner price which was not a problem at all. Few minutes later, another waitress came over and said because we are paying for lunch, we have to order everything in 5 mins and cannot order again, or we will have to pay for dinner instead of lunch. Ok, so we decided to go for dinner. Couple friends arrived later, the waitress who was taking order walk out in the middle of the conversation, without saying a word or came back to apologize. Hours later, the waitress came over to ask if we wanted ice cream, I ask her what flavor do you have, she threw me the menu without saying a word. How polite.She came back a few minutes later and asked if we finished eating, we said yes and she went, \"we will charge you for original price for everything that left on the table\", which was like a few pieces of sushi. My friend said we are still working on it then. The waitress went on and said,\" By the way, the seating time is limited to 1.5 hours and you guys have been here longer than that\". It is usual that all you can eat limit the time, but the place was completely empty, we were not ordering insanely, we were just chatting. So I asked her why didn't you tell me when I sat down. the waitress pointed at the menu and said, \"it's written here\". I looked at her and said,\" Do you have to be that rude?\" She didn't say a word, looked at me, and walked away. When we went and pay our bill, I asked the cashier, \"who is your manager?\"
\"He isn't working today.\" (With a frighten look on her face)
\"So can I have his business card?\"
\"He doesn't have a business card\"
\"He doesn't have a business card? Okay so when is he working next?\"
\"Oh... He went back to China and he won't  be coming back anytime soon\""}
{"text":"I'm giving them four stars because as average as their sushi may be, I find myself going back there every few weeks and enjoying other things on their giant menu.

Their seaweed salad is amazing, I always start with that and get some more for round two.

Their California roll and rainbow roll are kind of average for sushi in Brampton.

All of their tempura is good, except the squid. You see it and think \"awesome! calamari!\" then you order a plate of it and find out it's more like an inedible onion ring that takes forever to chew.

Their gyoza dumplings are delicious, and I would fill up on those if there weren't so many things on the menu left to try."}
{"text":"Every roll was 95% rice and 5% fish. Truly the smallest cuts of fish I've ever seen. Weekday lunches were also terrible, multiple multiple tables did not receive their food for up to 30-40 minutes.  They were severely under staffed."}
{"text":"Took Mom here for Mothers day because Wok of Fame was packed to the point of no walk Ins allowed. I was surprised by how empty it was, tried hard not to ruin my experience by reading reviews. Overall, a okay experience. Not a fan of the sushi, sashimi was okay. Service however was amazing, and quicker than we had anticipated. They gave my mom and I carnations for mothers day. Moms happy, so I can't complain. Can't say id come back for anything specific on the menu, but Im sure glad I didnt spend over $30pp to get full."}
{"text":"The service here is very good and attentive. The food is mediocre though, nothing special compared to other sushi places. I usually go here for lunch and their sushi rolls are pre rolled and taste like theyve been in the fridge for a bit. Their chicken teriyaki is good, along with their udon noodles. Salmon belly is good as well. Ice cream was delicious (strawberry/mango)."}
{"text":"This is an AYCE Sushi Restaurant that is pretty decent.  The seaweed Salad and terriyaki beef are really good.  The rolls are decent and not the best but also not the worst either.  The udon soup is good and so is the tempura.

Go to Hockey sushi if you feel gluttonous and need to eat a school of fish. You can also bring people who do not eat sushi and have them order chicken wings and noodles too.

Hockey Sushi is cheap and do not go there expecting \"good\" service. The servers are all rude and will do the  bare minimum to serve your food. If it is really busy make sure you order all at once because you will not see the server for another 15 minutes.

Other than the horrible service, the food and prices are decent.  

As always when it comes to Sushi, you get what you pay for.  Go here if you are planning to eat lots expecting to pay very little."}
{"text":"The food is alright for a Chinese run Japanese restaurant, however the service isn't too stellar. I would rate this restaurant higher if their service is friendly. Nice decor though."}
{"text":"We came here for the lunch buffet. I had been here years ago for the dinner buffet, heads up the dinner menu is much more inclusive (ie more rolls ans sashimi). Also compared
to a few years ago they have really upgraded the interior,
dont judge a book by its cover. Parking is a little difficult. But back to the sushi, I would give the actual food 3/5 stars, great bang for your buck, but limited in quality and variety. I would
give service 3 stars. But the price and value definitely 5 stars."}
{"text":"My favourite AYCE sushi place in Brampton for sure. The sushi is delicious, the menu describes the food pretty well and has a great variety and everything seems to always be fresh and delicious.

Also, canned soft drinks. Soft drinks in a can are the BEST.

The service is laughably bad at times. They kind of grudgingly saunter to your table and ask you what you want. You might have questions about the menu but they ain't exactly gonna give you friendly detailed answers. The service has never been bad enough that it actually affects my experience in a negative way; they just really, really, really don't get the concept of hospitality. But this is true of most sushi places."}
{"text":"Eaten here twice now for lunch.   I normally keep it quite easy for rolls.  Enjoyed some miso soup, gyoza, spicy California, and dynamite roll.   They topped it off w a green tea ice cream.   Friendly servers.   Always seem to be smiling.   I will be back :)

** update: Feb 9/13: had dinner there last night.  Still quality sushi, but, the rush / no love from the servers was kind of funny.  I'm still a fan, but, some better Customer Service (or even a half smile) would have been nice.....LOL.  Oh well......"}
{"text":"I don't typically have a high opinion of AYCE sushi, but I have to say, Hockey Sushi blew me away. The first thing I noticed was the variety. Beyond the normal sushi and sashimi, Hockey Sushi has a variety of donburi, yaki, noodle dishes, and various stir fries. You could easily have a full, varied meal here and not touch an ounce of a fish. I was surprised to see katsu on the menu, along with other Japanese favorites (no oden, unfortunately, but a guy can dream!). 

As for the sushi... the rice was excellent, and in my opinion, better than that of Sushi House just up the street. The fish was fresh, and though some cuts were certainly better than others, I didn't get the sense that they were pulled straight out of a refrigerator, as you'd find at many other AYCE sushi places.

I come to Toronto on business regularly, and going to Hockey Sushi is quickly becoming a ritual for my coworkers and me. The service is fast, the dishes come quickly and well presented, and the loyalty card is a great icing on the cake. Go here."}
{"text":"Wow! This place is FANTASTIC! And for AYCE?!?! Even more so!

Chic, modern decor... Clean, large dining room... Plenty of free parking... Pop music in the background... Efficient and friendly-enough staff... Great prices... Can't complain about a thing!

I really love their dinner menu. It contains a number of their speciality rolls and a much wider selection of sashimi, maki, and other items than the lunch AYCE. Apparent freshness and taste were very good to great for most of the items I've tried. 

The lunch is fine too. Actually, it's great. If I'd not tried the dinner before coming in for lunch I would not know that I was missing out on anything. Seriously, the lunch AYCE has a wide selection of items - just no speciality rolls - and offers more than any of us need to eat at one time.

This is one of my new favourite places for sushi!"}
{"text":"I've only done delivery from this establishment and find that food quality is hit or miss. One order will have teriyaki sauce the other won't. One time they will send sashimi with the rolls another time just salmon rolls... it's kind of upsetting... especially when you say no shrimp in the Beef Summer Bento and they take out the shrimp, crab and gyoza from everyone's order, very silly.... paired with poor communication it makes for a bad experience. One positive, the beef ribs are very tasty.

I will give this place a chance in the future for AYCE but I'm leary about ordering delivery again."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I love this place.  I'm pretty much a sushi noob who sticks to stuff like salmon & shrimp based items but there's plenty of other variety on the menu too which keeps me happy towards the entire meal.  

I only wish they had some better dessert choices. The banana tempura pieces are small and drizzled with chocolate sauce and the ice creams don't really do it for me.  I mean they're \"okay\" but it seems like a really weak way to end the meal IMO.  This seems to be standard to all AYCE sushi places though so I won't hold it against them

Good that pop is included as well"}
{"text":"I'm not a huge sushi fan, so when my colleagues wanted to come here for lunch, I was not too excited.  I am sure glad I came though b/c it was delicious!  There were LOTS of options - even on the all you can eat menu - for people who didn't like sushi.

There was a 4 page list of items that were included in all you can eat - wow!  And all of it was made fresh while you wait.  For lunch $12.95 all you can eat is a steal!  Everything came out fairly quick.  

From what I can recall, I had the shrimp tempura, spring rolls, chicken teriyaki, beef fried udon and green tea ice cream.  So tasty!  

I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I finally don't have to drive so far to experience my favourite sushi restaurant in the GTA. 

Now if you want a review on the food go to my page on Hockey Sushi Thornhill. 

The food is roughly the same which is the one thing I was worried about b/c some places may have the same name but the food might not be the same. Thank goodness this place is not part of that rule, the foods great! Although I do have to compare, the spicy salmon sushi, and spicy salmon and spicy tuna maki rolls are not as crispy and tasty as the one in Thornhill. However this place has a bigger selection when it comes to food but even with the bigger menu I still have my favourites.

The one waitress that works there use to work at the hockey sushi in Thornhill and she actually recongnized me too. So I knew right away that the service was going to be good and it was! 

My one little complaint is the lighting in the restaurant in that there was barely any. During the night I understand that you may want to set the mood for couples going to this restaurant but when you're with a bunch of friends or family I don't want it to be dark I want light. I wasn't the only one who felt this way either my friends said the same thing and people at other tables also were saying the same thing.

This is a definete must go to place for all you sushi lovers.

Items to definetly get

- acadia roll
- red dragon roll
- salmon sashimi
- shrimp skewers"}
{"text":"Used to eat here when I bought a coupon book that gave me 50% off on ala carte lunches and dinners

Sushi was fresh, but rice to fish ratio was more rice than fish. 

Tempura was good and serving size was decent.

Service not good, not attentive and aloof. 

But how can you complain? When you only pay $65 for $130 worth of food for 6 people - it more than compensates for the lack of service.

Will be back ... if and ONLY if there's a coupon."}
{"text":"I am only a fan of the prices (and the food); not of the servers all that much. They probably have the rudest servers in my experience. 

Experience 1: I went over with a friend on a snowy, cold day for lunch. The whole restaurant was empty-ish. But the server suggested we sit right in front of the door. I politely asked her if we could get a spot around the corner (and from where I was standing I had a clear view of the restaurant and its emptiness) and she had the FUCKIN audacity to say it was full. Instead of walking out on delicious droolworthy $11 AYCE sushi, I insisted that I can see a quiet empty spot there (and I pointed at \"there\") and well she wasn't happy about it but she moved us to that spot. \"There\" was also farthest away from the kitchen; I made sure of it so that she would have to keep walking up and down. Revenge is sweet. 

Experience 2: Took my Dad out for a Sushi lunch at Hockey. The server refused to let us have 2 menus. Keep in mind that we had to order from the menus (unlike most other AYCEs). And I just didn't want to keep passing a menu between myself and my Dad; when I take him out, that's not the kind of service I give in to. So, instead of walking out from delicious, cheap AYCE lunch, I tried arguing and convincing her but she switched to a higher pitch in either Chinese or Japanese. Thank god my dad is a typical Indian Dad who would have none of that. And he took over. And well. We had 2 menus on the table.

Verdict? Their prices are too amazing to not love Hockey. And the food."}
{"text":"Worst AYCE sushi experience so far. The server was not welcoming at all and kept rushing us although there we practically no customers there at 6pm in the evening (not a great sign). The sashimi had a weird lemon taste to it and the seaweed salad was slimy and tasted gross. Will not be returning back to this place at all."}
{"text":"i have to take down on star , i went there at the end of Nov, it was a bad experience. service was  fine, but food was bad, sushi rolls were really bad. rice was very dry and hard, not fresh at all. also way too much rice than filling , i am talking about 70% rice , dry , hard rice. i could not eat at all. cooked food was fine. sashimi was not fresh either, hubby had to send it back. 
i was really disappointed, consider i am not a picky eater. its food was not consistent at all."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I finally got a chance to see what all the fuss was about for dinner today and i was really impressed. When I walked in it was very posh with some awesome music in the background. There was a wide selection of sashimi, maki, sushi rolls, everything you would want at a sushi ayce spot! They are also family friendly which I loved. Alot of sushi places I've gone to didn't have high chairs for my daughter and this place did so that was a plus! Great place great prices, I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Bland, less than average sushi, served in the size of hockey pucks...which only tells me \"inexperienced chefs\". This place is not for ANY fan of sushi."}
{"text":"Whenever I'm having sushi in Brampton, this is my go to place. Why? 
1) Decent food, decent service. 
2) Decent price (People claim that Hockey Sushi is much cheaper than 168, but really, the only difference in price are the children prices and the lunch price - which is $1 more)
3) They have a points card! You collect 500 points for every $10 you spend. Free lunch costs 8000 points. Free dinner costs 12,500 points. Who doesn't love free food? I believe this is the only AYCE sushi place within the Peel region that offers a points program.

As for the food; I feel as though they have made the portions a little smaller (I'm not complaining though, because it used to be HUGE and my friends and I were so full afterwards that we couldn't try other dishes). Rolls are neat and don't fall apart when you pick them up. The filling to rice ratio is decent, not like those other sushi places where they just load up on the rice to make you super full, really fast.

In regards to service, I've never had to wait very long for a table whenever I go there. I've gone for weekday lunch and dinner and weekend lunch and dinner - the longest wait would be maybe.... 10 minutes? 
I guess my only problem is that the service is somewhat of a hit or miss. There are times when I get a very friendly server that clears our table within a reasonable amount of time; then there are the days where I get a server that sort of disappears and stays far, far away from her designated tables. Also, from time to time, I find myself ordering the same dish multiple times because they keep on forgetting my salad or edamame.


Atmosphere and Surroundings: Tables are clean, so are cups and plates which everything is served on. For anyone that likes booths, they have booths that are big enough for 4 people to sit comfortably. 

Overall, if you're ever in Brampton or Mississauga and you want sushi - I recommend you go to Hockey Sushi"}
{"text":"Food generally are of good quality and has a LOT of choices...168 of them not including drinks and dishes that comes in two forms (bento/udon) are only counted once; however, the servers seem to be new at serving. For example, orders were wrong (ordering sweet potato and shrimp tempura, got squid and yam tempura then told us that's what the last server said we ordered), took three requests for them to get us wasabi that didn't come with the sashimi dish, took us three requests to get the bill and THEN were told we have to go to the counter to pay because the portable credit card machine is in use, and I don't even want to get into asking for tea refill.
NONETHELESS, they were very polite, so it doesn't deter us from going back."}
{"text":"I loved hockey sushi. I took my mom and boyfriend there last week Tuesday. I loved all the rolls we ordered (mostly salmon), my mom is a huge fan of sashimi which she loved there, the staff was good on refilling our drinks, the food came out in a timely manner. The portion sizes were good as well (not as large as Tokyo Maki Sushi) so we got to try a bit of everything. 
I enjoyed the soup and of course the ice cream. I got red bean and chocolate and my boyfriend got mango and green tea (red bean and chocolate tastes surprisingly good mixed together).
This is one of my favourite AYCE Japanese restaurants in Brampton/Mississauga.

I will most definitely go back."}
{"text":"My first time here for lunch on a weekday.   Got here early so plenty of seats. The food came as large dishes so be careful when ordering too much.  The service was great. The food was alright. When I was leaving that was when the rush came and people were lining up to be seated. Very busy on a weekday lunch."}
{"text":"Arrived 5pm. Not that hungry so instead of paying dinner buffet price, we decided to do per order basis.

Decided to order a bento box.
and surprised with the amount of items I got for only $12.99 + tax

My bento includes: RICE, SALAD, MISO SOUP, CHICKEN TERIYAKI, VEGETABLE TEMPURAS, SALMON ROLL (6pcs), SALMON SASHIMI (3pcs) , and SHRIMP TEMPURA (2pcs- not incl in the pic)

However, my food generally taste bland.. lacked of teriyaki sauce and same with yam tempura.

left the place feeling full, but not satisfied."}
{"text":"The rolls are not rolled properly and the service is so bad it makes you uncomfortable to be a customer. They make you feel as if you're doing something wrong even though they are messing up the orders

 Ok I always have philadelphia sushi. The first time I went, they put avocado in it, and the menu doesnt say avocado is in it. I'm allergic to it, so I sent it back. The second time I went, they MESSED UP MY FRIENDS ORDER. She sent it back, and the gave it to her with an ATTITUDE. I waited 15 minutes before I got mine. 

They gave her more than she asked for, and when she told her they gave her more than she asked for and she didnt want anymore, the waitress had an attitude and threw the food away and started SLAMMING THE DISHES in the cart behind my friend. 

Then the waitress asked my friend if she wanted to pay while I was in still in the middle of my meal that they brought late, and she said she would pay after I was done. SHE DIDN'T RESPECT OUR REQUEST. She still went and got the machine and made my friend pay. While I was in the middle of eating, she asked me if I wanted to pay, and I said not now. 

When I was done eating, SHE IGNORED ME SO I COULDN'T PAY AND LEAVE. She walked by my table 5 times and didn't come over. She intentionally made me wait. Her coworker kept looking at my empty plate and didn't come. I had to ask her co-worker to let me pay. 

One of the waitresses there is a complete beeyotch and needs to be fired. I'm telling everyone about their terrible service. I'm never going again. Don't go there"}
{"text":"YES YES YES Y'ALLLLLLL!!!!! I am very happy this place is open. My wife and i went with another couple and we ate so much Sashimi that i actually tested out my swimming skills later that evening. I swam the entire length on the credit river!!!! 

$20 dinner AYCE is a great deal with pop. 
The fish was extremely fresh. 
The rolls were Terrific. 
Huge fan of the Sushi Pizza. 
Salmon Sashimi was amazingly fresh. 
Service was great. 
They have a loyalty card which is also a great feature. 

VERY IMPRESSED!!!!"}
{"text":"So I've been to this restaurant now a total of three times and all three times have been absolutely horrible horrible customer service that was the last time I will ever go back to that restaurant. The food is decent but the service is terrible and the prices are horrific"}
{"text":"I had waaaayyy better sushi. I don't know what all the hype is about and the service that the lady gave us was highly lacking she just acted like she didn't care and barely spoke English! The chef seen the look on my face from the kitchen and then after that she stopped serving us and he ended up serving us. Which was way better because he was nice and attentive but I honestly did not like this place, I just moved to the Brampton area from Toronto so hopefully I find a go to sushi place. How the heck do you not have soft shell crab? Ugh."}
{"text":"This place is the textbook definition of a 3/5 dining experience. Well priced for all you can eat- and the food is pretty good. But the service is just a joke unfortunately. I've been here at least a dozen times over the years and its always the same. The owner/manger that wears long sleeve shirts is the only one that speaks any english. And although he's helpful it doesn't make up for the staff that makes  a lot of mistakes. Food thats ordered doesn't end up coming (main problem) Overall: Food= 4/5 Service= 3/5 Atmosphere= 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Rush was the theme of our lunch there.

We stopped for lunch there today because there was one parking  spot near its entrance - we decided that if it is busy inside food would be good. The place was packed with one spare table. A guy at the cash seeing how we hesitated at the entrance rushed to our side to explain the workings of all you can eat a la cart as this concept was foreign to us. Like most we eat with our eyes first and having to order from the menu put us off a bit. 
The guy was friendly enough but rushed me to make up my mind faster even before I had a chance to read the menu. I ordered couple miso and rolls to start with but he did not give me a chance to continue the order later but wanted the complete order now. Pretty much under duress as the guy stood there waiting impatiently I ordered at random. He did not write it down. Minutes later a harried, unsmiling waitress brought what looked like half of  the order to the table. Our table was instantly covered with multiple small plates of food which rapidly got cold. 
Miso was okay. Hand roll spicy tuna and spicy salmon were greasy and there was no difference in taste - it was not spicy either. Chicken teriyaki was to die for while beef teriyaki was hard and cold by the time we get to it. Tempura never made it to our table in the first round. Seafood and beef soup were tasty although we ordered thin noodles and received thick ones. 
Then nothing was happening for a long time until another waitress came to collect dirty plates. I asked what happened to the rest of our order and she started that really loud and long dialogue in likely Chinese with the first waitress across the entire restaurant. In the end the first guy came over ready to collect payment. He appeared surprised that we did not receive everything that was ordered - mind you - he never wrote it down. We re ordered some more stuff. The guy told me to be sure I don't order more than we can eat !!! I was quite put off by that. On their menu it does say that if you leave your order uneaten they'd charge you for it but telling me point blank to be careful with my order was just rude. 
Tempura was very greasy. 
I have mixed feelings about this place. Food was okay and $12.99 for all you can eat sushi cannot be beaten. I definitely prefer an open buffet where I decide how much of what I take. Having all food on the table at once is not a good concept as it gets cold really fast. Not writing down the ordered items and forgetting some in the process was a put off. Rushing me to order everything at once was another put off. Letting me know that I should not order more than I can bite was rude. Food was for the most part fresh and tasty. 
Overall impression - we went there twice - first and last. I did not care for being rushed and I did not like the a la cart ordering process at all."}
{"text":"*RUNS TO THE WASHROOM!* That's exactly what happened to me today. 

Me and my internship friend decided to have our last internship lunch at Hockey Sushi. Man....should we have went somewhere else. Service was fast and the rolls tasted okay. We only ordered the spicy salmon rolls, dynamite, mango, and BBQ eel. There was barely any mango and eel in the rolls because it was mostly filled with cucumbers. I tried about 3 spicy salmon rolls...the only raw thing that I ate that day. Did you know that they charge 75 cents more if you order Nestea instead of another pop beverage? That does not make any sense to me. I asked the waitress but her english was limited so she had no idea what I was asking her. 

Please read below on how I got sick:

As soon as I finished lunch I felt a little off since the sushi wasn't sitting well at all. Six hours passed when I decided to go for a run on the treadmill. At this time the sushi was still just sitting in my stomach. After a couple of minutes my stomach started to hurt until the point that I had to stop my workout. I was about to drive home but I was in so much pain that I had to call my dad to pick me up (that's how bad it was...imagine yourself curling into a ball in your car). I'm not sure if it was food poisoning because I feel alright right now. However, the symptoms were very similar to food poisoning but it only lasted the night.

Good luck if you decide to try out Hockey Sushi."}
