{"text":"As many have said the service is horrid.  After 20 minutes of zero service and watching the staff lounge around and occasionally serve friends we just decided to move on.

Too bad, because it looked like a cool place and had great atmosphere.  College St. has far better options.  Until these guys figure out how to run a public bar I'd suggest you try some of them."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks and good beers. We went on a Wednesday and it get pretty crowded after 10PM, unfortunately the barman was alone and the food took some time to reach the table but it was totally understandable."}
{"text":"Fast becoming my fav bar!  real drinks freshly/properly made   a 5$ 5-7pm cocktail special.  light menu (sandwiches primarily).  And nick is one of the fastest/friendliest bartenders I've chatted with in a while.  Ambience is 'comfortable'.. your parents basement kinda vibe.  highly recommend"}
{"text":"Great patio, great service, and great pricing.. 

Love the atmosphere, at least on the patio!

Great got predrinking or bar hopping 


5 shots for $20"}
{"text":"Such a great place for a chill bar night! Music is great and their mojitos are perfect."}
{"text":"The front of this bar is like somebody's living room -- cozy couches and hangouts. The back is more like somebody's rec room, the kind people used to build with a proper bar so they could feel fancy. That sounds awful, but it's really not. It's surprisingly big, so they do hold events here -- the MothUP storytelling series comes to mind.

It was quiet when I stopped by, so I got excellent, friendly service from the bartender. My old fashioned was okay.  Properly muddled with fruit, but I couldn't taste the booze at all. It's a cute bar, though, and I'll definitely be back to try more of their drink menu."}
{"text":"No One Writes to the Colonel, eh?
Well, no one writes to the psychotic hitchhiker who haunts the Highways between Chicago and San Diego either, but you don't hear me complaining!
Come to think of it, no one wrote to Jim Halsey after he spent time in jail for shooting me to pieces. And I'm damn sure no one wrote to Captain Esteridge to commiserate him for all the cops, cop cars --not to mention a helicopter-- that he lost in the fray. But hey... he's doin just fine.
Oh, and while I think of it... this bar absolutely sucks!"}
{"text":"It's a beautiful space and good cocktails but like so many bars, I find it too loud."}
{"text":"I came here for a late lunch on a weekday afternoon, and even though the two of us were the only people in there, the vibe was so nice! I love the cozy but spacious living room feel of this place, and the large island of a bar in the middle of the room looks great. I don't know how busy this place usually is, but I thought lunch was really great value for the money - $11 gets you the sandwich, soup, and coffee beverage of your choice. Everything was really fresh and healthy. Our server was sweet and attentive. And it really is a cool space - I want to come back at night for drinks just so I can hang out there."}
{"text":"I really love this bar.  Super trendy and lots of cool drinks to try.  Order the mojito!  Drinks are a little bit on the pricey side but we drank there and then hit up sneaky dees for some late night nachos and cheap beer"}
{"text":"Amazing mojitos! I love the staff as well. Our server David was so attentive and knowledgable about the drinks. I came in later on a holiday and he was energetic and very personable. I will definitely be back and will hope to see David again. A must if you're looking for an amazing atmosphere and tasty drinks with great service."}
{"text":"Drinks are meh. Atmosphere is cool, but drinks and service are lacking. There is also no food here at all."}
{"text":"I've been to Nobody Writes to the Colonel a few times and enjoyed each time I've been there. Yes, it's a little hipster, but I feel like it's a good mix of unpretentious hipsters, UofT grad students, and random groups of friends that stumbled upon it or couldn't get in to Sneaky Dee's on the opposite corner.

The bartenders work their asses off to serve everyone leaning on the large rectangular bar in the centre of the space. I watched as the one bartender skilfully made my two mojitos quickly, but with care, while many other patrons waited on a drink. You may have to wait, but everyone's patient because it's worth it for a well-made cocktail.

It's a cool place if you're looking for something different without having to go out of the core.

Important note: cash only."}
{"text":"I am managing a group of people. Going to different bars across Toronto in winter time and summer time.
Bringing them 10 to 20 people every Wednesday. One day, they - the management - decided to host a comedy show. I asked them if it was ok the get my group here and chat. Despite the fact that they agreed , they treated us like a dog when their so-called comedy show started. We left and went to the Nirvana around the corner. I will never trust and tip such a bad management , after so many weeks being loyal and polite. 

The kitchen is almost non existent. I must say that the bar atmosphere is pretty nice and the location excellent."}
{"text":"Came here for drinks late one night. Bartender was amazing - there were only two tables filled in the place and he let us sit and have an alcohol-fueled debate about French politics and Gabriel Garcia Marquez until he had everything closed up. Props. Beer selection was small but good and the shots were great."}
{"text":"I threw a private party there in March 2011, and had an amazing time. The service was fantastic, the drinks were unique (Mint Mojito Shooters, if my memory serves me correctly), and the atmosphere was fantastic. 
Excellent service, great decor. There was no food there, so I can't comment on that, but it's one of my preferred spots in College West, and Toronto in General."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere! It's a comfortable little bar that feels relaxed and clean."}
{"text":"This is a cool bar.  The interior makes you feel like you're in someone's home.  They usually have a dj spinning eclectic house and electronic music.  It can be a bit loud and isn't always the best place to go if you want to have a great conversation with someone, but their mojitos are on point.  

Also, I'm pretty sure they only take cash, which is kind of a bummer for folks who prefer paying with a card.  

But, overall, this is a cool and unpretentious bar with a cool ambiance."}
{"text":"We sat for 20 minutes before someone came out to the patio to bring us menus, and then it took another 20 minutes for the server to return to take our order. When we tried ordering, we were told they were out of what we wanted. No big deal, we'll get something else. Out of that too. All we wanted was a drink, and they had exactly one type of beer even though the menu listed several. The server disappeared to \"check something,\" and we ended up leaving after nearly an hour without even ordering."}
{"text":"I was quite impressed by the ambiance of this place. Its a nice lil spot to hang out with friends. They play some good numbers without being too loud. They have a good selection of mojitos as well. The price level was good and the service was quick for a saturday night!"}
{"text":"I've only been once- but I'll be back! Great decor, atmosphere, like someone's living room, only nicer.

On Mondays, they host the Short and Sweet film evening- 8 great short films, with free popcorn, starts at 8. But it's only in the back of the bar, so if it's not your thing you can still be in the bar without the movie night.

Also on Mondays: 2 for 1 cocktails til 8 p.m.. And these cocktails are no joke: fresh fruit blended into daiquiris, mojitos with loads of freshly crushed mint and limes with good cane sugar. They are $8 regularly (worth it), and with 2 for the price of 1, it's a steal!

There is no patio (YET- they're set back from the street so it's got serious potential), but come chilly times, this is going to be THE place to be. And I'm willing to sacrifice some evening sun for that mojito, no problemo."}
{"text":"NO ONE WRITES TO THE COLONEL. 

Haha that's how I read it first, intense. This is a bar/lounge with intense swag. You walk up a couple stairs and everyone's hanging out in so many different areas. So many different chairs. But everyone is really happy. And that's quite the accomplishment coming from the diverse group of people that came out on this Friday night. No seriously, I ordered my drink based on a recommendation of a 60+ woman sitting at the bar beside me. 

This drink! It was a long island iced tea that she promised would, \"get me\". It didn't completely, but was surprisingly drinkable given the fact that about five different hard liquors are being used together. It was harmonious! 

I recall some throwback music, very fun. There was a DJ going in the back but no one was dancing. Too cool. 

The coolest were the bartenders. Just some super nice guys, one with a sweet hat a patron that night insisted upon giving him. When they ground up fresh mint for mojitos, you could smell it from a mile away! It was heavenly and clearly, they know what their doing. They doled out some free shots as the night went on. Very fun."}
{"text":"Arrived here early on Saturday night for drinks.  The music was loud and there weren't many people seated but shortly after 8pm the place filled up.

I love the cozy and relaxed atmosphere as well as the fun combination of furniture, accented by candles.  There was also an eclectic combination of patrons in the bar which was nice.

I ordered a caipirinha to start.  Not sure what the back story is on this but it was the only item in red text on the entire menu, perhaps that's what piqued my curiosity.  It was delicious.  Lots of muddled lime and the right amount of booze, served in an unpretentious plastic cup and worth $8.50 in my opinion (I was feeling a little buzzed afterwards). I had a couple of beers following that but what was a bit strange was that they kept taking the drink menu away, perhaps they only have a few copies for circulation. Who knows.  So I don't recall how extensive their beer list was but I think they have a fair bit of cocktail selection.

I enjoyed it and would come back again.  I'm not sure what the vibe is like later in the evening but it's a good starting off point for dates, singles or groups."}
{"text":"This review is basically a warning. If I had written it last year, like I meant to, I would have given this bar 4 stars (I was in love with the mid-century decor and the excellent drinks). But I went back recently and something very bad's happened to this place. I suspect they changed owners? The decor is the same but the staff has been changed and in place of the gracious and competent guys and girls who worked there before we were treated to a parade of amateurs: a waitress who didn't speak English (we eventually had to mime what air conditioning was, that it was 13 degrees outside and that it was deeply uncomfortable to have it blasting), a bartender who didn't know how to make a simple drink from their menu and had to start over twice, a manager (I think?) who plopped his unwashed hands in a jar of pickles to fish out the garnish for a Caesar (which previously came with a classic, crunchy celery stalk like it's supposed to, not a slimy manhandled pickle). The drinks were so horribly mixed that, despite my aversion to wasting perfectly good alcohol, I left behind a nearly full glass. We were also overcharged by the same bumbling bartender."}
{"text":"I come here a lot and I love it.  The cocktails are good and the place is cozy and clean ; )"}
{"text":"LA-LOVE this place!!  Such a great hideaway on College St.  With funky music and such a groovy decor!  The bar tenders serve up some seriously delicious martini's.....Mmmm."}
{"text":"The handwritten sign outside said 'this is the place' so we stopped in to ask what place?? Obviously, so new, the whole place still smelled like sawdust - but not in a bad way... more like a 70's wreck room meets cabin in the woods kind-of-way. 

The decor mixes wood, brushed metal and textiles perfectly. It looks like a showroom for that vintage furniture place in Kensington, Bungalow; the back wall featured a floor to ceiling grid of records and the fireplace in the front was filled with white pillar candles. 

The space is large and loungey, the DJ booth in the back suggests that this place has the potential to be awesome. The bartender said he'd never made an Amaretto Sour before, but it was perfect. Good instincts and good taste can't be faked like this."}
{"text":"Fab music, trendy customers, and some of the very BEST (or at the very least, biggest) mojitos around (at a great price!). Super relaxed and chill atmosphere, with ample comfy seating makes it a great spot to relax after work or classes with friends."}
{"text":"Bar spécialisé pour ses mojitos, on vient ici avec son groupe d'amis ou son date pour pouvoir discuter dans une ambiance musique electro brazil ou jazzy. Ambiance intimiste et relax très appréciable dans le quartier de College et Bathurst.

// This bar is famous for their mojitos, you come here with your group of friends or your date to chat in an electro brazil and jazzy atmosphere.
Very cool bar in the College and Bathurst area."}
{"text":"What a cool spot! Low lighting, comfy seating and chill music make this a relaxing spot to have a few drinks and talk. 

Their drink menu has a little bit of everything; beer, cocktails, shots, etc. Very reasonable pricing(only $7 for a pint!). The bartender was great. He stopped in to check, but not too often, and he didn't rush us for the bill or even mention it.

Good times! I'd love to go back!"}
{"text":"great music. great martini  great mojito, cute set up, fun art on walls, little nooks to sit with friends, very hipster- reminded me of ferndale mi . would definitly go back when in toronto."}
{"text":"I came last night for a bday party. The dj was playing music at a level low enough that we could talk without yelling. 

The bartenders were incredibly fast and made a tasty tequila mojito. 

I didn't care much for the decor and ambiance. But all in all I had a good time here."}
{"text":"came to watch Karl at the MothUp and was impressed by the homey feel of the place. There's a few comfy sitting areas that remind me of tiny living rooms and a big bar in the middle. Service can take a little while when there's 50 people jammed up against the bar, but that's to be expected. 

The tall cocktails seemed to be a big hit with everyone, but at 1.5 oz. and $8, seemed a bit steep to me. 

They had a few St. Ambroise beers on tap, which I enjoyed.

I'd like to come back on a regular night and see what the crowd is like. I love bars that feel like a nice old couples' living room."}
{"text":"I went there on a Thursday night, when we first got there there was a strange museum networking event going on, I said strange cuz they were actually wearing armours and fighting with swords! It was interesting to watch though! The staff had no idea about what was going on either! Great vibe after the event was over and more people started to show up. really decent prices on drinks. very chill set up, its a great hangout place. The only downside was that they don't offer any snacks other than tortilla chips and salsa. great space for hosting events. 

they have a pretty good selection of cocktails."}
{"text":"I went to this bar to check the Short&Sweet film festival that they're hosting every monday night. 

The venue has a very relaxing ambiance. There are couches and cozy booths(my fave in any bar!). A tiny stage with pull out screen and DJ stand. 

Very cool decor (like vinyl discs all over the walls) to booth.

When you step in - you get a feeling as if you left city borders and dived into a cottage vacation life. I think the only thing that's missing for that to be a real cottage within the city is a fireplace=)

the bar in the middle of all this awesomeness serves all the drinks possible (just $5 for cocktails-and oh amazing Mojitos - which are claimed to be the best in the city=)) and also some snacks.

Oh I also loved the washrooms' design=)) hahaha=) very colorful=)

I'm definitely coming back again if not just to enjoy the drink then for sure to visit one of the cool events they're hosting on a regular basis(so far I only know of short&sweet on mondays and mothup storytelling on monthly basis)."}
{"text":"I'm so confused as to why everyone loves this place. I HATE this place. I roll my eyes and swear every time someone invites me to a Friday or Saturday night birthday party here, because there is a line-up to get in at least 80-85% of the time and it's always one-in-one-out starting relatively early in the night.

This in and of itself is not why I hate it; I hate it because once you finally get inside, you realize that you could, as my mother would have said, \"shoot a cannon through it,\" meaning, it's effing empty.

I suspect this is a zoning/licensing thing related to the fact that they have tables and chairs and couches (so a seated, tables + chairs patrons limit.) But on Friday and Saturday nights, they drag most of these out of the way and everyone is standing anyways.

Perhaps I'm soured by the fact that on Hallowe'en 2012, I told some smug white guy that his \"I'm African\" costume was vaguely racist, got into an argument with him over it, and then got chewed out by his insecure girlfriend who sidled up on the conversation thinking I was pulling his metaphoric schoolyard girl pigtails and hitting on him... She sucked, he sucked, this place sucks."}
{"text":"Any bar that has a photographic book of Saskatchewan is alright in my books.  I saw it on the mantel and had to take a look...cuz seriously, is there really that much to photograph in Saskatchewan??  

I really like the vibe of this bar, it's nice and laid back, the service is good - and the mojitos are fantastic!  I had a mango mojito and it was delicious.  My SO, who is a mojito fanatic, said it's the best he's ever had.  We sat in the couch area near the front, which was a great spot for a group like ours.  

All in all, good service, good drinks, and interesting browsing material make this a great option for a casual bar night with friends."}
{"text":"The prices have changed somewhat since I've read Sgt Pepper's review of $5 dollar drinks.  The specials have been now escalated slightly from almost 3 years ago to about $6.25 for all 1.5 oz mixed drinks during \"happy time\".

Coming here on a Friday and having mixed drink specials in a laid back place is alright by me.  I came here with Colin and we must have stayed an hour or so.  You know it's a good day when you're not really paying attention to the time nor did it really matter.  

I don't really drink mixed drinks but when I do (LOL sounds like the most interesting man in the world reference) I like to not have only one drink nor do I want to have the same drink over and over again.

I ended up having 3 drinks and each was different.  I started with a mojito then to a margarita then to a Cuba libre.  If these drinks don't make you feel like you're on vacation then what will besides actually going south somewhere where alcohol is cheaper than bottled water?

My crawl buddy (Colin S) also had 3 drinks and between the both of us our 6 drinks added up to $37.50 as the $6.25 per drink includes tax.  That's sort of cool and completely unexpected.  We ended up leaving 45 bucks.

For a really nice selections of drinks at some pretty good prices even on a Friday this place is pretty good for that.  The inside seems a little hipster and even entering the place feels like a house but it's a little different and very reasonably priced for \"happy time\" prices.  That being a Friday too?  Not bad at all...

Cash only."}
{"text":"Had my birthday party here on Saturday October 22nd. My friends brought me a present that was stolen. It was in a Mac shopping bag with 2 lipsticks and a birthday card inside. This really upset me and I'd love to have it back - especially the card. If seen, pls message me!

Other than that, the place is great and staff were easy to work with and were very accommodating. Service was friendly too!"}
{"text":"Happy hour 5 to 7 pm, 2 for 1 is great if you want a good deal ! They have a variety of cocktails. It's a cute little bar with lounge space."}
{"text":"This is a great bar. It's cozy and warm. Comfortable atmosphere, a big bar and seating all around. Personally, I like sitting at the bar. The bartenders are super nice and talkative. Tip them respectably.  
I usually order whatever they have on for specials that particular day (Friday being my fav), whiskey sours are good here.

Its a nice place to bring a date after dinner or movie or whatever you do nowadays during a date. Overall, I always feel comfortable and relaxed sitting at this bar. I can't complain, and there's always Sneaky Dees across the street if you get hungry."}
{"text":"This place has changed a lot in the last few years and, in my opinion, not for the better. What used to be a cozy, quirky and relaxed bar has re-branded itself as some pseudo-lounge establishment, which just feels 'off.' I went last night with a friend and the bar was dead and yet, we still got terrible service from the bartender/waiter who seemed annoyed that we weren't ordering any of their fancy cocktails. The whole experience just felt cold. I won't be counting this as one of my regular go-to spots in the city anymore."}
{"text":"Great place for a first date. Cool vibe, solid music, and delicious mojitos. 
They have a few different themes/events on different nights (karaoke, choir, etc). Not sure if it's a set schedule or just once in a while but FYI"}
{"text":"The problems begun when we walked in and the entire place smelled like a headshop.  Overpowering incense that was almost enough to make me leave.  We had heard good things about the cocktail list, and having both worked as bartenders my bf and I decided to stay and check it out.  First problem...table service.  This might just be a personal preference, but I'm a firm believer that a bar with no need for servers (no food) should be a pay at the bar kind of place unless you want a really high end lounge. Table service prevents mingling and makes for a stuffy bar.  Maybe other people prefer it, but it isnt for me. I especially don't understand the point when on delivering our drinks the waitress asked whether we were planning to order more (before we'd even had a sip!) when I said I wasn't sure she said \"that will be $15.75 then\".  Seriously, what the hell is the point of having sit down service if it is run like that?  We definitely weren't going to order a second round after that.  

Oh and then there are drinks...like I said my boyfriend and I both know cocktails.  He has a bartender blog featuring new takes on classic cocktails and has spent years working as a high end bartender.  So I feel pretty confident in telling you that these bartenders have no clue what they are doing.  Watching them free pour drinks that require precise measurement made me shudder but not as much as when I tried his drink.  First, it didn't come in the correct glass.  The zombie is a specific drink with heritage, it has a glass. Second, it bore only the slightest resemblance to a zombie.  It was all pineapple juice and an overpour of almond syrup.  I had ordered the Fresh Balsam, their signature.  Of course they were out of the liquor used to make it...

.With such a great cocktail culture springing up in Toronto I had hopes that this would be a great place to get tiki lounge style drinks, something other bars arent touching..  Hopefully they get rid of the incense, hire bartenders who know what they are doing and make it bar service.  The space is great and I'd love to see it improved."}
{"text":"Loud Music with Good Taste!
Huge Bar so You'll have tons of options.
Cute couches for couples to cuddle.
Overall, nice local bar to drink and have fun."}
{"text":"Various selections of St Ambroise on tap, signature mojitos, and generous servings of wine. Very good lighting and decor: cozy but cool yet not pretentious. There is a patio out front on College street enclosed by some brushes and trees. Very nice! Gets loud on weekends and can get quite hot in there but the music is good and sometimes people dance. I like it!"}
{"text":"Nice plays with great music and atmosphere. The service is very friendly as well as the prices. Just double check the prices on the menu with the prices you are getting on the bill..."}
{"text":"Went to a birthday party that was held there last night, and I had an absolutely great time! The bar has a great setup, so you're able to order your drink from three different sides. The staff were great, serving drinks quickly and doing a great job cleaning up, when drinks were spilled, which happened a number of times, last night. Drinks were flowing. 

They only have St. Ambroise on tap, but four different types it, I ordered the pale ale for most of the night. The setup and decor were nice and inviting and most importantly, the washrooms were clean! Drink prices were reasonable ($5.50 for a pint if the pale ale) and at the end of the day, I will be going back."}
{"text":"I will begin this positive review on a down note; I miss the lunch hours here something fierce. Walking in shockingly hungover at 1 pm to have $4 breakfast sandwiches, continue drinking, and flirt outrageously with the bartender only to have her laugh at me was an absolute treat. Unfortunately, few people seem to know how outstanding this place is, so, the lunch hours are no more. Brunch, yes, also awesome.

The ambiance is fantastic here. It's very relaxed-rock star and makes you feel like you're invited to an in-demand house party at Lew Ashby's. Bartenders are (almost) all quick, knowledgeable, and the kind of energetically hungover which gives even more confidence to the clientele. The saying 'don't trust a skinny chef', adapted to, 'don't trust a sober bartender'. They're funny, intelligent, and just cool to hang out with. Bar tabs are surprisingly low, too, even after seven Pimm's Cups with a splash of J&B and a grapefruit garnish.

Food is very good, considering the price point. It's in direct competition with Nirvana and Sneaky Dee's, so it has to aim for the cheaper end, and definitely hits.

So, great room, great bartenders, great food, great price...why four stars? Way too many douchebags go here. Once it starts filling up I am only too glad to leave. Things overheard during busy hours: 'So what can I get that's really cheap here?' 'Why's that jerk at the bar wearing pink?' (from a jerk wearing pink) 'Man, I used to like Nirvana, but then that one guy died and all and they were really lousy after that'. 20-year-old broke college students who think they're cool come here after 8, from the floozy energetic girl to the arrogant Lacoste polo wearing dickheads to guys who actually stand in the stairwell comparing their own LP collection to the one on the wall. I know it's unfair to judge a place by a small sampling of its clientele, but it also stinks not being able to go to one of my favorite bars in the city past a certain point of the day."}
{"text":"I love this place, and it's easily the best thing to come to College Street this year. I've never tried the food, but stopped in for drinks many times and love what they are doing. 

the place is decorated tastefully with a variety of cool art and murals, and the lighting is good and comfortable. it seems easy to stay for a long time without getting bored or uncomfortable.

the drinks! oh the drinks! they have a fantastic apricot wheat beer on tap, and the mixed drinks are all made to order and include top notch ingredients including fresh fruit blended to perfection, and they were pretty strong too which always bodes well.

the music seems pretty varied but consistent in the fact that its good music to chill, drink, and converse too. I've heard everything from jazz to hip hop (good stuff, not commercial rap), to funk, to rock and probably a few places in between. not the type of place you should go to if you want to hear requests or radio hits, but thats part of the appeal for me.

overall, this place is awesome and I imagine will continue to get better as it gets its feet off the ground. I've been told they are working on getting a patio too! w00p! 3 cheers for the Colonel!"}
{"text":"What a cool place! Lives up to its odd name!

I will 100% return here. Its a great place to bring those out-of-town friends, who are eager to try something different because they are in Toronto!

The ambience is so cool and relaxed. Its pretty loud in there, so meaningful conversation can be limited at times. Not as bad as a club...but imagine a packed bar with lots of loud conversation. Seating was also limited! I was jealous of those who came earlier and snagged the cool looking seating areas (we got there around 11pm on a Friday). Ended up sitting at the bar, which worked fine. 

I had a margarita under the advice of a friend that they were fantastic. She was right! Made with fresh strawberries, I loved mine. 

I loved the back wall of records. Who designed this place? Seriously well thought out style, from the barstools to the little knick knacks scattered here and there."}
{"text":"Ive been here for drinks before a night out (Hello 5 well shots for $20) and been back here for  girls night and date night. 

My experience changes each time...depending on the time I go and the servers. I've had really cute and awesome bar tenders who really seem to enjoy what they're doing and knows their drinks. Then I have people who don't even ask to take your order for 20 mins while chatting to each other behind the bar and there are 3 tables in the whole bar. 

So I think it depends when you go. But, they have really good drinks and very well priced. I've have their wine and it's decent, they also have a good long island ice tea and will make different creative drinks if you ask them to. They have the proper ice for your Old Fashioned if you ask for it ;) 

The atmosphere is nice, it does get louder as the night goes on but with good vibes. It also has a somewhat enclosed patio, so that's a plus!

Would definitely hit them up again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Fantastically funky bar, well laid out, beautifully decorated. Lots of different spaces to unwind in. Cocktails can take a little while to prep, but they're worth the wait! Great live music/brass jazz!"}
{"text":"If you're tired of going to Sneaky Dee's every time you want to have a drink in the College-Bathurst area, No One Writes to the Colonel is a great option.

NOWTTC has many tables (hence, accommodating of larger groups) and has a good-enough selection of drinks. It definitely skews towards the younger crowd (like many other bars/pubs in the area) but just as long as you're not in the mood for anything fancy, this place should suit you just fine."}
{"text":"Things that are amazing: drink prices ($5), the mojitos (ON POINT), vibe (very nice bar that has a mini dance floor with live DJ for those who want to boogey down). What needs work: the service (we got rushed to pay our bill long before we were ready to settle) and CASH ONLY BAR WITHOUT A WORKING ATM INSIDE THE VENUE!!!! It's 2016 - credit card is a necessity. The service and cash only bar result in a 3 star review."}
{"text":"The bartender tonight (August 5, 2015)  looked pissed. He also didn't seem to either a) like working there or b) like humans in general. He seemed put off and unwelcoming. So, I turned myself right around and left. Who the heck wants to sit and bask in that nasty energy? Not I!"}
{"text":"The Raconteurs performances were a blast... I look forward to returning...
Drinks were reasonably priced... seems like a nice crowd..."}
{"text":"Went back to take part in, what turned out to be, the final MothUp story telling night at this venue. The Moth is one of the most popular podcasts on iTunes. Each week it features 1 or more 5-7 minute \"it happened to me\" stories. The show gets its material from MothUps held all across North America. MothUps have been taking place in Toronto since May 2010 but despite being a fan of The Moth I was unaware there were even Moth shows in Toronto. Thank you Yelp Events for helping me notice. 

The show started at 8 pm. I was told, as a story teller, to arrive at 7 pm. I got there about 6:40 and found the place packed already. It was standing room only 30 min before show time. The MothUp was well run and well organized. They had a great stage and good sound system. No technical glitches. 

Downsides:

Ideally I like to smooth myself out with a couple beers before getting in front of a crowd. They only had two bartenders trying to serve a capacity crowd. It took a good 15 minutes in line to get a simple beer. An extra bar keep or two might have helped. I did manage to down a beer and a portion of the wonderful Elaine K's beer before I went up as first story teller of the night (the sacrificial lamb slot). 

I've just discovered The Moth's Toronto venue and this will be the last time NOWttC is hosting it. NOWttC will continue with their own non-Moth branded story telling night. I wish them luck. They certainly have the technical and organizational chops but when you consider as a story teller you're getting, via The Moth, a chance to share a virtual stage with story tellers that range from a-list actors, headliner comedians, to Nobel prize winners, a little home-brew story fest might not have quite the cache.

Moth or no Moth, do check out this place for any future story telling nights."}
{"text":"Great bar! Second time going for drinks here and it was wonderful. The overall ambiance here hits the mark, relaxed yet fun. 

Drink selection is great their mojitos are perfect some of the best in the city! They also have a fun winter menu with hot drinks like mulled wine and a few other creative items. 

Saw they had a happy hour from 5-7pm will try to catch that the next time I go!"}
{"text":"A relaxed bar with the ambience of hanging out in a friends living room, if said friends own a fully stocked bar and know how to make a mean cocktail. A drink here will run you around $10 at regular times, but happy hour is 2 for 1! 

The location is a little hard to find since there was no signage out front when we came. Look for the metal Dr sign with the words 'This Is The Place' outside some residential houses. Walk up the stairs and grab an open table! A great place to relax and hang out with friends."}
{"text":"I stumbled into this bar with a couple of friends on my first night in Toronto. The place itself, while on a large street, has a tucked away vibe-- the sign is so subdued you could walk right past it without noticing (if it wasn't for the \"This is the place\" sign, I wouldn't have believed anything was there). Inside, the atmosphere is laid-back and put-together. The little cushioned booth-tables are great for conversation, and the bar is pretty big. You can see where the living room used to be when it was a house.

The drinks are really good- I had a long island iced tea that was actually made by the bartender, as opposed to being made from a pre-mixed bottle, and was made well. Our server was attentive and the prices were reasonable. 

If I ever come back, this is going to be one of the first places I'll come back to!"}
{"text":"Really poor service. Stopped in and the place was dead. It still took the server over twenty minutes to prepare our cocktails and when we went to leave the bartender, Chris, gave us a terrible attitude saying he was making our drinks. Beyond rude."}
{"text":"Do not go here. We had a work function at this place and were not allowed to take advantage of the drink specials they had on b/c we had made reservations in advance. This isn't such a huge deal, but what was really annoying was the Russion/spanish bartender kept yelling at everyone reminding them that we cannot use the drink specials! Calm down...we all know now relax. He was super rude and condescending. Made a big deal when asked if we can split the bills. Really awful customer service.

For the location, there are a million other cooler bars one can go to in the area. I would skip this pretentious bar and go anywhere else next time. That or DON'T make a reservation, then your group can take advantage of the drink specials. (which is what the bartender told us in a very condescending manner).PASS ON THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Came to the colonel on a 2nd date, luckily there was a lot of seating for us as it was a Thursday night. The seating that is available was really uncomfortable as most of the seats don't have any backing. The drinks are reasonably priced for what you get. I had the Mojito as that is what most people on Yelp stated that was the drink to try. I found it refreshing until I got to the end then it was really salty. Afterwards I had the old fashion which tasted like most of the old fashions I have had in the past. Overall I enjoyed my time here and would go back again. 

Also they have a promo for 5 shots for $25."}
{"text":"5-STAR WORTHY MOJITOS!

Seriously, the raspberry mojito was the best mojito I have ever ever ever EVER had. Still drooling til this day lol they also have a deal on shots sometimes ($20 for 5 or something), they are more like shooters but still worth. I got the apple pie one and it was pretty good. 

No One Writes To The Colonel is a great chill spot, with good atmosphere. Love the music, seating area, the drinks (the mojitos !!!!!!!!!!). Just great vibes all around. 

Don't come here hungry though as they don't really have food except for like nachos and a few small finger foods. The cheese nachos I had were super simple (nachos, melted cheese, with salsa on the side) good I guess... how can you fuck up nachos anyway? I didn't feel good paying for it though since it's something I could easily make at home for less. 

Next time I come, I'll stick to the drinks. Oh and almost forgot to mention that they are cash only, so bring cash or use the slow ATM in the basement!"}
{"text":"Great ambience. Friendly bartender. Surprised it wasn't busier. The mohjitos werent that's great and Bonspiel failed to show up."}
{"text":"I thought all the hipster vibes in Toronto congregated on Ossington, but the Colonel proved me wrong

Came here for a Paint Nite event and loved the feel of this place.  Pretty chill bartender made everyone's drinks pretty fast, I enjoyed their strawberry mojito but didn't like the cosmo or orgasm very much, too strong

Also liked the little charcuterie board my friend got at the end of the event, obviously not the same quality as other restos but for the nice ambiance and drinks, 4 stars, would come here for chill drinks but probably not food"}
{"text":"I love this place. This is a neighbourhood gem and is by far, my favourite place on College St. Dim and soft (complementary) lighting, tables, sofas, bar stools and low boots allow for ample seating however if you wanna dance, the dj spins real vinyl. again... real vinyl.

Each time I've been (only evenings, for drinks) the vibe's been great: good music... the kind of stuff your parents would play on road trips (i.e. Paul Simon, Graceland), the service has been pleasant and on-point, and the drinks.... OHHH the drinks!! I love beer but I can't resist a cocktail when I hit this joint. As others have mentioned, the mojitos, at $8.00, are among the best in the city, and other concoctions made with fresh ingredients are equally delicious.  They also have a good selection of bottled and draught beers.

This is a great, energetic, place to go to with one person or a small group of friends if you're looking for a good place for drinks and spend time chatting or people-watching at the bar.

It's not a big place but it's roomy and they make sure it's comfortable without being over-crowded. It's casual and friendly. A previous reviewer called it a 'hipster' venue, but I don't find that. It's very unpretentious and in fact, you can weed out the fakes by noticing if they know the lyrics to whatever random tune the DJ's got going on.

If you go around 10:30-11:00pm, expect to wait in line. This place is popular but if you show up a little later (12:00-1:00am) you will likely get in, no problem. The door staff is pleasant which I find is so rare among door staff and security.

Have fun!


UPDATE as of Feb 2013:
Apparently their pendant lamps are very expensive or very sentimental. My friend touched it and the little jerfkace bartender came over and told me they were going to kick me out. Whaaaa? Anyway, he was being a total dick and I'm not going back. There are enough fun places in the city worthy of my repeat business. For anyone else, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing cocktails with very reasonable price. Like the quality of their cocktails can easily beat some of the fancy downtown restaurants/bars that charges you big bucks for a cocktail. Atmosphere is great too, especially the cute patio!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of any place that suppies blender drinks on Friday night for $5 each. Fancy! The drinks are not strong but orders come fairly quickly. I like how the decor here feels homey without getting too \"lived in\", like a few unfortunate dive bars. There's a funky vibe going on with mantels and chesterfields and such. A-okay!"}
{"text":"Great vibe, decent prices on drinks, chill set up. There's lots of cozy seating and also movable tables and chairs for groups. Went on a Thursday night and it was fairly busy. Drink prices are reasonable and the service was good. The St Ambroise stout tap kept me happy while most of my friends indulged in cocktails that they all enjoyed.

My only critique: Music from the DJ got louder as the night progressed so we were pretty much shouting by 10 pm to have conversations. 

I can't believe I've never noticed it before! Diagonal from Sneaky Dee's I must have walked by it a million times. It's easy to find but easy to miss if you're not looking for it. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Does anyone have an email or phone number for this place?  The number on here is not correct"}
{"text":"Dear Colonel: a love letter

Dear Colonel,

You are charming and moody, with skillful drink-slinging prowess and attentive barstaff. I vote myself least likely to be out on a Monday night, but you were the perfect companion for starting the week off right. Here, the bartender will never \"run out of mint\", and the mojitos flow plentiful. The cocktails are amazing, as are the most lounge-y of low benches and tables, the lighting, and the washrooms that are authentically dive bar yet spotlessly clean. Throw in a chatty old man NPC and it felt like the perfect local watering hole to share only with those you enjoy. 

Señor, could this be amor? It's not your eyes, it's the mojitos."}
{"text":"You know for those kids born pre 1988 lets say, the green room was the place you could get into, off the beaten track, get a cheap drink, and probably not be bothered by the fact that maybe most ppl were underage. 

As this genre of kids grew up, No one writes to the Colonel became a decent enough substitute as the barrage of douche bars took over. 

I love that it's a cheap place to drink, you don't have to worry about what you're wearing, you can casually plan to make your way down there and enjoy being right at the border of the annex and little italy. 

This place has become a regular spot for me, and i'm happy to see that the bouncers (who i have to say are really friendly) take capacity seriously now. It was annoying for a little bit this past year when they would cram up the place. But that seems to no longer be an issue."}
{"text":"I live close to this place and honestly this is my favourite bar since the drinks are so good. They taste great but are secretly very strong. It has a small patio out front if you want to drink outside. There is plenty of seating inside. It's also generally not super busy thus a good place to hang out with friends and talk without having to yell over loud music. I would recommend the Friday zombie."}
{"text":"We went here the first time to celebrate my husbands birthday and we really liked the place. There were 8 people, and we had our own table, great time.

6 months later, we went there to celebrate my birthday. I reached at 6.45 pm on a Friday and my friends were all still reaching. I requested for a set up for 12 people and one staff member started putting the tables together. In the middle of this a senior staff member came to me and said \"Just because you are 12 people does not mean you can all get to sit. Its Friday night and its busy and we cannot give all our tables to you. What will I do when other couples come, they will go away. You cannot hold tables because you are early' !?

I have never seen such rudeness or weird logic. We were paying clients after all, and the time we get in is our prerogative So we walked out, went across the street to Sneaky Dees which was crazy crowded and they actually requested a smaller group to move so they could give us a table. We had a blast. Try the 'Destroyer'"}
{"text":"VIBE
I give this place 4 stars for ambiance but 1-2 stars for drinks. I'll explain later. Lots of hidden spots filled with mismatched furniture odd decor items that makes for a great conversation starter. 

Ambiance is definitely hipster twenty somethings. Some in groups. Some in dates. A good mishmash of people. 

Service - um, not so great. A server should explain whether or not we order at the bar or if we'll be served. This one did not. 

This brings me to the drinks...

WE DRANK
Companion got a martini with three olives floating around in it. Care for a toothpick? 
I got a gin and tonic. Apparently, you can screw up a GT - more tonic than one would want. 

Then I made the mistake of getting a mojito. If you want a mint tree and ice in a glass, this is your place. 

It made for a very hearty laugh! 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Someone needs to write to Colonel about the inexperienced staff and awful drinks. Otherwise, it was still a fun time."}
{"text":"Beautiful, intimate atmosphere with wonderful cocktails. Bar that opens at 5pm. 
Checked in around 6, menu still had summer specials which were 2 for 1. 

Had David (bartender) make what he drinks, a combination of gin and milk - odd combination but turned out to be delicious. A neat bar with interesting art pieces that played eclectic music."}
{"text":"This is a great solid bar to spend time at. In the early evening it's quite a relaxed place, but in the evening the music gets a little louder, there's a live DJ and the lights get a little more colourful. 

The age-range of the patrons also seems to change depending whether it's the summer or not. So if you don't feel like hanging out with woo girls, aim to be there in the early evening. 

Also of note, is their mostly (or all?)  attractive male staff that seem to appeal to every possible taste you could have. So while I see people have brought dates here, I probably wouldn't recommend the same. 

The drinks are also very delicious and there are some pretty good daily drink deals. However the food is not. I had the charcuterie and the nachos with my friend, and it honestly looked and tasted like deli from a 7/11. 

So enjoy the drinks and the atmosphere, but skip the food"}
{"text":"Fairly cool place with very cool name. 

Came here for yelper Renata's birthday festivities. It was early (7pm on a Friday) so I managed to grab a happy hour cocktail ($5 mojito!) just in time before drinks went back to their normal $8 price. The mojito was HUGE but not especially boozy or great. 

The server here was helpful in dragging out extra tables to accommodate our large group. She did table service but it got slow once the place started to fill up a bit more.

Cool decor here, quite homey as others mentioned, sort of like being in an oversized living room. The bathrooms (downstairs) were neato too!

Don't think I'd rush back but it's definitely a cool place if you're in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"NOWTTC is the first and only \"TTC\" containing entity that puts a smile on my face! What really makes this a wonderful relationship is the fact that you are pretty much guaranteed a good mojito, LI Iced Tea or Riga Black Balsam specialty drink ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balsam_(drink) )

The setting is a weird mix of what looks like retro Brit pop decor, mingling with what would look like a modern lounge in Brooklyn! Overall it allows for a pretty cozy atmosphere that is chic without being pretentious. There are some really low chairs set along the wall that are best avoided by patrons who are over 5'4\". Instead, you may find comfort on the cozy couch by the fireplace (probably the Colonel's spot), or in the patio out front.

Overall a great place to catch up with friends over some refreshing drinks as long as you avoid the community choir nights and the low chairs."}
{"text":"Don't worry Colonel, I'll write to you!
Actually I believe this place may have been named after the title 1950's book by Gabriel García Márquez... or inspired by a lonely bartender.

I stumbled onto this place while waiting for a friend at College and Bathurst. I decided that after our meal we would go check this place out.
It was a Sunday night around 7pm and the place was empty which didn't bother me as I just wanted a latte and a seat in some comfy chairs.

The atmosphere is very cozy; sort of like hanging out in someone's cool basement. My latte was good and the barrista (who may have actually been the owner) brought us a plate of assorted cookies to dip into our caffeinated beverages.

The venu is also a full bar, features a DJ area (though we were listening to Radiohead a la Jukebox) and has a food menu."}
{"text":"Asshole management. 
Avoid this place. The manager is awful. We held an event here and the couch broke. The bartender said it was already broken, however at the end of the night the owner/ manager bullied us into the paying for the already broken couch. He was such  a mean man."}
{"text":"I fell in love when I walked inside No One Writes to The Colonel!! And I know 'This is the Place!\"! 

Live DJ on Saturday night pumping out lively music just at the right volume. I didn't need to yell at my Yelp Drinking Buddy to get my message across.. but maybe I just want to yell at him?? 

Staffs were attentive and polite. Drinks are reasonably priced... I love my Strawberry Mojito ($8) though it gave me a sugar high just from drinking that. 

Those armless cushion seating aren't the most comfortable but they do looks really cute. Their WIFI password is one of the most complicated I encountered, I don't know if people can type that in properly after a few drinks. 

I know I will be back... No One Writes to The Colonel is the Place!! BTW, it is right next to an Ashtanga Yoga Studio....."}
{"text":"Hands down the most hipster bar I've ever been to. I came for a special Paint Nite event so perhaps my experience wasn't the most accurate, but the environment at this place seems like it would be pretty cool and laid back. They have a pretty extensive drink menu, and their mojitos are quite popular with the clientele. They have different flavours, so I tried a strawberry mojito ($9) and it was quite delicious. They also make their long island iced teas ($10) super strong (there is a separate section on the drink menu for strong drinks), and I watched the bartender throw like 4 shots into my drink. Still really tasty though. The bar is cash only, but there is an ATM downstairs. I thought the bartender there when I went was a little sullen, but perhaps the attitude comes with the territory. Wouldn't mind coming back here for a low-key night out."}
{"text":"Cash only bar.. or pay $3 + other bank fees to withdraw your money downstairs (they got me twice). I really liked the Al Capone cocktail - best I've had, and only $8! Prices are reasonable. Only prob I had is that I've come here on separate occasions and the drinks were not the same each time, so quality is dependent on who's working the bar... but that can be said about anywhere I guess. Regardless, it's still worth grabbing drinks at this cool spot"}
{"text":"Just about every other bar on College street is the size of a minivan and rammed like fourteen pencil crayons in a box of twelve. (YA KNOW what I mean?) Not this place. Maybe it's the ungainly name, or the fact that you have to climb a short flight of steps to get in, but No One Writes To The Colonel is rarely packed. I call this Good News.

NOWTTC is illuminated at date-level lighting so feel free to bring your Plenty Of Fish trappings here. You could take a seat at the long softly illuminated bar, or one of the cosy armless benches adorned with pillows. There's a wall of LPs at the back and houndstooth drapery and spherical light fixtures. I've heard the decor described as your mom's basement in the 70s -- maybe if your mom is some kind sexual predator.

I came here for \"comedy\" night and if I could make those quotes thrice the size and asterisk them each, I would. It was the premiere of a \"sitcom\" (again, 3x + *) which was actually two sitting men taking turns talking into a mic on a stand. When one of them pulled out a guitar and punctuated the act with some musicomedy, we literally left our seats and moved to the furthest reaches of the bar.

But we didn't leave. That's how cool this place is. Cash only.

Obligatory Title Pun: The COLONEL is POPPIN'!

Menu Readability: I think it was written on a chalkboard.

Need to mention: McAuslan's beers on tap.

What this place teaches me about myself: If I grew up in the 70s I would certainly dwell in basements."}
{"text":"Cool spot. Drinks are good and the layout of the place is unique too. My only complaint is that they don't take debit or credit. I usually like to start a tab so it was odd not to be able to do that. It may have just been the night j was there that their machine was down but I'm no sure."}
{"text":"I love Bonspiel - I had several of the performers as teachers  at 2nd City - and they perform here the last Sunday of every month.  The fact that they host Bonspiel is a significant part of the 5 star rating.  If you get a chance to check them out, do; they are hilarious and fantastically talented.  http://www.bonspieltheatre.com/

On the bar itself, its as hipster as the name implies but is comfortable with really interesting decor and seating.  One day I'll come back for more than the show and explore it more."}
{"text":"$5 Whiskey Sours on a Friday? And they're good? Word.

Last Friday I met some friends by the fire at No One Writes To The Colonel (poor Colonel, PS, at least shoot him a text) and it was a warm cozy chit chat get-drunk-before-dinner fest. 

The notoriously late-for-everything Matt M was early and he had arranged for entertainment in the form of a baby crawling on the floor towards a fire. I am always a fan of babies in bars, but here it seemed particularly bold, as she was literally crawling towards fire. Adorbs.

The cocktails are all really well crafted and the beer list is boss. I'm going to be back and try some of those snacks. They looked Yummy! The ambience is near perfect for a winter night; it's cozy without being pubby and the decor touches of mis-matched yet comfortable pieces really do it for me. 

PEPPER POINTS: For a flipping fabulous name."}
{"text":"I loved this place. Came here with a friend on a Monday night. It was chill, the bartender was friendly and the royal mojito was amazing. Definitely  recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is clean - that's what I kept thinking as I sat there drinking my apricot beer (I had three - the first one tasted like something else but I didn't know until I had the second and third, that actually tasted like apricot...so not sure wtf I drank the first time).  

Anyway, clean and nice decor.  I came here on a Friday night with a few people for a birthday, and it was cool...the music was good too.  It wasn't very crowded though (actually it was pretty empty), and the vibe was kind of dull after...but if you're looking for a chill place then I'd recommend it.  

Only complaint is that our server forgot to bring the birthday girl one of her drinks, and was standing around chatting to the bartender...no big deal but when the drink came the glass wasn't even full :*(  

I didn't eat any food so I can't comment on it, and I won't...but I thought the random items were pretty funny sounding and worth a future try.

Anyway I don't know if I'd bother returning here as it wasn't groundbreaking by any means, but if I lived right in that area I think I would go back for another round."}
