{"text":"First time I went to this place I was so happy with the BBQ dock which was so tasty and crispy so I decided to invite some friends the week after. But second time, I had a bad experience. The food was good which was sweet and sour chicken while the service was AWFUL!! The waitress was so unfriendly and even she collected the dishes while I wan not done with my food and not apologizing at all!!!! she just said sorry and went! while half of my dish was still full and I was eating!! so overall I really don't like to go to a place where they do not treat you as they should!"}
{"text":"One of the best places to go for authentic Chinese food in Montreal in my opinion! Affordable prices, quick service, and consistent food! Everything is very tasty and I keep coming back for more...PM is where I go when I need comfort food. 
Their Japanese tofu with eggplant is one of my favourites, along with Buddha's feast!"}
{"text":"Has been my go to place for years. Super friendly, fast and delicious. Would definitely recommend this Chinese place for a casual night out or great for takeout! Never disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in Montreal. My bf and I always go there when we find ourselves downtown together. Our favorite dish, no competition, is the General Tao Eggplant. Sometime general tao is hit and miss, with some restaurants creating sauces that are all sugar and almost translucent. But this place makes the best sauce I've had in mtl. also, I often see g.t. Chicken or tofu, but this version, with big pieces of deep fried eggplant, is a different take on the dish that I really appreciate. The eggplant is always cooked perfectly so that it just melts as you chew. Besides this one dish that I am obviously crazy about, everything else on the menu that I have tried has been good. The portions are generous for the price and the service is fast and friendly. The restaurant isn't very interesting decor-wise, but it's clean and not overpacked."}
{"text":"Good overall Chinese restaurant. It's the kind of place that you look for in every new city that has the good Chinese food. The lady on the phone who answers take-out orders is extremely friendly and helpful, and she'll give you suggestions in a very cheery manner. Take-outs are fast and very convenient!"}
{"text":"I went there after hearing a friend rave about the authenticity of their Chinese food. There was also that one dish I wanted to try after reading some great reviews about it and I wasn't disappointed in the least. 

I highly recommend ordering their minced pork, Japanese fried Tofu and eggplant casserole. It is absolutely a favorite of mine. I would have it again any day. I don't know where they get the tofu but it was amazingly flavored and melted right in my mouth. I cannot emphasize how good it was and I am very hard to please.

We also got their sweet and sour soup which was agreeably balanced with maybe a touch too much vinegar.

I went again during lunch time at some point and ordered from their lunch menu. The food wasn't exactly bad but it came nothing close to the casserole. Get the casserole! 

The price was good. The portions are generous and very fair. Our waiter was very friendly and actually replaced water by tea free of charge when we asked for something hot to drink.

5 stars for the casserole. 4 stars for the service. 3 stars for everything else."}
{"text":"This place is very fast!!!

Order and five minutes later you get your first dish!! My friend recommended the japanese tofu and eggplant dish, which I ordered. I liked it but it wasn't the best, the tofu is silky and all but I could use more sauce.

One dish we ordered that was superb was the steamed chicken with ginger sauce, the chicken was fresh and moist, cooked just right, yum it was so good. There was three of us and it was under 15$  per person, what a deal.

The hot and sour soup was a bit runny but it tasted right. The chow mein is is not so crispy but the sauce is perfect. Aside from the chicken, everything else seems a bit off, but the price and service more than makes up for it.

The staff is super friendly and efficient. Love this place and will be back often :)"}
{"text":"So I thought this was a another french bistro on Mont-Royal, but it's a bona fide through-and-through Shanghainese restaurant that runs with the best of them. 

You walk into the usual predictable \"decor,\" and I use that term loosely. Tables, chairs, white walls, a photo or two of the motherland, a few tchotchkes on or around the cash register. 

The food, though, is incredible for two things: One, you order and it nearly instantaneously comes out of the kitchen piping hot. My first reaction was that I was just screwed into eating a reheated pile of leftovers sitting around, but it was, in fact, totally whipped up on the spot. Two, the food is bloody good. Beijing duck, hot chicken pot or whatever it's called, sesame beef, spicy eggplant, it was all excellent and totally delicious. And cheap too - four people, $62 tax in. Not bad at all - when's the last time you ate well for under a twenty in this inflation-riddled city?

The discerning Chinese guy in our group of friends gave it a big thumbs up. If that's not an endorsement, then I don't know what the hell is. Enjoy! Well worth the trip!"}
{"text":"meeehhhhhh!!!!!!! Very average at best, much betta options out there."}
{"text":"Maybe I'm outgrowing my love for deep-fried foods, but the last few times I've ordered my \"usual\" here (general Tao chicken), I've been disappointed by the hard-to-find pieces of chicken under the very thick coating of batter. I'm a creature of habit and wish they would just make my \"favourite\" like they used to, rather than me try to find a replacement on their menu. There are too many other consistently good restaurants in mtl to bother."}
{"text":"Yum. Went here on a date. Service was friendly, I did not feel rushed or pressured for additional tip. The food was great. What a gem hidden in the depths of the Concordia area! I will definitely go back again. I ordered the crispy noodles with beef and found them to be cooked to perfection. 

I will try to see if they offer take out as well because it is so good and affordable. Forget thai express!"}
{"text":"Just came back from a rainy day wine tour, we were very hungry and cold, as we walk towards a restaurant that we found at Yelp, here comes these big Chinese words on the window of Restaurant P.M. \"? ? ?\",  take one look at the menu and decided to go inside.  We were not disappointed.  We had three very authentic Cantonese dishes and they were delicious."}
{"text":"Food is delicious with large portions and friendly waitstaff.  Highly recommend the general tao's chicken-- very crisp and tasty."}
{"text":"After reading some good reviews, we decided to give it a try.

I had the Singaporean rice noodles with chicken and shrimp, extra spicy. The portion could easily fit 2 or even 3 people for a very fair $10 including tax. It tasted quite good.

Service was excellent which is extremely important in my book, will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Bon et pas cher! Excellent pour aller manger entre amis(es) au dîner où tard le soir."}
{"text":"I've ordered from PM probably 10 or 15 times and I think I'm finally finished with them. The first few times I had their food I was really pleased with it. Reasonable prices, good flavors, and big servings. But as I ordered more and more times I find that I'm happy with the food I get maybe 50% of the time. Sometimes there's just a weird taste- especially on the pork dumplings which I believe are microwaved. They have sort of a leathery skin on them sometimes. 
The last straw for me came when I placed a phone order and came in to pick it up. I experienced some truly horrible customer service. I described my order to the guy at the counter, who said it wasn't ready yet (I came at the time I was told on the phone) and I should have a seat. In the meantime, he charges me for the food ($13, sounded low to me) and asks me to have a seat. After about 10 minutes of waiting, he came over to me, and told me that he was going to have to re-do my order and charge me a higher total because he made a mistake. Oh, and my food had been ready since I got there and he didn't realize that either. So I went home very angry, with cold food. Done with this place. I'll miss the wonton soup, but not enough to justify giving them any more money."}
{"text":"Snake soup and Japanese tofu with fungus? Don't mind if I do! Great dumplings, too. This place never disappoints, delicious and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Since I've moved out for school, I've had a longing for Chinese food. My friend heard very good reviews of this resto. We decided to take a visit today as a post-exam celebration. Sadly enough, it did not live up to our expectations. The food wasn't as good as other places and was almost room temperature. However, that was fine, I didn't expect authentic Asian cuisine. The pinnacle of this downfall spiral was the bill. As the night progressed, service was relatively okay - they refilled our glasses very quickly and were friendly and polite. 

However, when we went to pay the bill, two things happened. Firstly, the manager refused to take my credit card, even though they took Interac and had a VISA/MasterCard sticker on their counter and window. So I opted to pay in cash. When she was getting my change, she clenched it tightly hovering over my hand and struggled to mutter that my bill didn't include the tip. I nodded at her and waited for her to drop it in my hand, but she kept clutching onto it for the next minute until another customer came through the door.

I'm not picky on service, but withholding someone's change out of self-entitlement ruins any night. I still tipped her, but definitely never going again. I ever find myself forced into this restaurant again under these circumstances, I would take all my change and leave. 

Furthermore, although they may had been polite while speaking to us in English. I couldn't help but overhear them gossiping about my friend and I in Cantonese while we were finishing our meal. 

A really big bummer, to say the least."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, very reasonable prices, slightly spotty service.

I have nothing but good things to say about the food. From the hot and sour soup to the chicken with ginger, it was all delicious. The portions were huge, and the food was of the highest quality.

This would've easily been five stars except for the service. Despite not being very busy, I was seated at one end of a six-person table that had a couple (apparently on a first date) sitting on the other side. Awkward. 

When I went to pay my check ($15), the owner refused to accept my debit card, despite a sign that stated \"credit card minimum: $30, debit card minimum: $5\". He insisted that my debit card was a credit card because of the Visa logo and would not be swayed, not even by me pointing out the word \"DEBIT\" printed on the card. When I paid with $20 cash, he would not give me $1 bills so that I could leave a proper tip. 

Quirky service happens. The food is too good to not go back. Next time I'll bring small bills."}
{"text":"Unhappy waiter throws the plates to the customers during lunch. Worst service. Don't order spicy egg plant. Not even spicy, just weird Chinese pickle on top. Not edible. Waitress didn't explain, nor did she bother to change the order. Some dishes were good here, but sorry, I won't betray my favourite Chinese joint ever again."}
{"text":"Right near the Guy-Concordia station, this is a good restaurant with fairly diverse offerings of Chinese, Singapore and Thai dishes. Service was quick and efficient on a busy Saturday afternoon. I had the Singapore curry beef which was quite good, the beef tender and the veggies crisp. The price was quite good for the amount of food--$11."}
{"text":"I was asking a friend who owns a Japanese restaurant to recommend the best hot and sour soup in Montreal, and she stated that, hands down, PM has the best in the city. She's absolutely right! Positive aspects include, obviously, the soup, but the food in general is excellent. I'm a vegetarian and there is a HUGE selection of vegetarian fare at PM. Furthermore, if you can't find what you're looking for on the menu, they'll modify a meat selection to suit you. I highly recommend their salt and pepper crispy tofu, as well as their General Tao tofu. Their noodle dishes are great as well; I like the finer noodles and they are always crispy and flavourful. The vegetables are fresh and the sauces thick and savoury (I'm getting hungry thinking about it)! They're open late, which is awesome but (and this is a bit of a downer) they tend to give you the bum's rush if you're there too close to closing time. The only negative thing (and it isn't a bad thing if you're in a rush) is that if you order several different dishes, they all come at once, i.e., you'll still be working on your soup and your two or three other dishes will be sitting on the table getting cold. But this is a minor thing. The food is good, prices are good and service is quick! It's my go-to Chinese place in Montreal."}
{"text":"Quite good chinese-american food but far from being the best I've had in Montreal. However, it's quite cheap and plates are big and come with rice. Delivery was fast."}
{"text":"I kind of stumbled over this place while walking on ste catherine. I tried the salted crispy tofu & calamari as well as dumplings in peanut butter sauce. They were all ok but nothing out of this world. It's an ok place to dine if you are feeling like eating chiniese food but if you are looking for the real deal in authentic chinese cuisine, you probably will need to look elsewhere."}
{"text":"Your average Chinese restaurant. The waiters are friendly and the service was great.

The food was alright, and the portions were fair. The dishes came out of the kitchen really fast, so this is a perfect place to go out for lunch."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant in dtown, the service wad very good also. We ordered 1 pad thai(10$)  and the general tao(10$) and both were sooooo good!"}
{"text":"Did I ever tell you how I feel about Chinese food?  Let me be frank (I feel like we're there) it is never my first choice.  In fact, I almost never sugget it.  My budgie Cracker hates it...so does my dad.

Anyway, after a long day of biking and walking around, my sister and I headed over to Kazu for dinner.  We got there at 9:31pm.  It closed at 9:30pm.  Sad...so sad. (N.B. It may been 9:01 and 9:00...but you get it.)

I was hungry.  My sister was hungry.  We no longer cared what we ate.

My sister suggested P.M.  She said it's the only Chinese restaurant in downtown Montreal that she and her friends will eat it.  

When it comes to ambience and environment, a Chinese restaurant is like the average girl.  You do one, you've done them all.  Sorry, was that too brazen? 

P.M. is no different.  It had the usual white table cloth and that subtle clean but unclean feeling.  Nothing some tea can't fix.  Service was just as quick-quick, but friendly.  I ordered up my favourite dish: \"gong chow how woah wow\" (my Chinese friends are REELING right now...I totally butchered their language, meh).  The waiter knew what I was saying - beef fried rice noodles, and eggplant and tofu.

The food was good, a little better than average.  I didn't take photos because when my sister asked if I was going to post about P.M. I said \"no...it's Chinese\".  But then...random friend of a friend asked me if there were good Chinese restaurants in Montreal.  Ding, ding, ding.  I always forget that there are people out there who love them some Chinese. 

For me, the best thing about Chinese restaurants is that you tip small, leave full, and your wallet's still heavy."}
{"text":"Pret-à-Manger is the best Cantonese cuisine I could find in Montreal. The chef from Hong Kong has more than 30 years experience and has worked in the famous Yung Kee Restaurant in the Oriental Pearl.

This restaurant makes typical Cantonese foods, light and fresh. Their chicken series, chow mien series and seafoods are my personal favorites. If you are a fan of oriental spicy foods, try the Szechuan Hot Mien with Beef there, it will fly you to the sky."}
{"text":"Pretty good chinese food but unfortunately for them there is a better alternative right next door in Kanbai. PM's food pales in comparison and often feels too \"fried\", fatty and bland in taste. Initially PM was one of our favorite spots but it seems like the competition in the city has increased tremendously as more and more south-east Asian and Chinese students are coming here to study."}
{"text":"I have to say, I've ate in this restaurant for many times , those 3 stars I only give as reference . I ordered  an delivery yesterday , it's a way worse than before when I ate at the restaurant , the seafood soup taste like water , eggplant has no taste but the tofu on the top is super salty ? It's  like they forgot to put salt after cooking , so they just put some salt on the top ?  Only the black pepper shrimp taste normal , finally taste like a Chinese food instead , lol . 
 So I am not sure if it's because delivery or they are just getting worse , however , I'll never ask delivery from PM anymore !!!"}
{"text":"As a student in the area for the past few years, I've eaten at PM quite a few times. This place has a VERY long menu and they make all kinds of Asian dishes. Their Singapore noodles and general Tao chicken are fantastic. However, the service has been questionable at times."}
{"text":"This is the go to spot for amazing, tasty, affordable Chinese food on St.Catherine... Flavors never disappoint... I love their general tao eggplant... Actually battered and fried to perfection.. And their honey garlic short rib... No words!!!!!"}
{"text":"They have jellyfish! (My fave:)). Had the jellyfish, hot n sour soup, pineapple chicken, chicken stir-fy, and mushrooms with veggies. The pineapple chicken was crispy and juicy and was probably my favorite part of the meal. The decor is of a typical Chinese resto and service was good. Portions were medium sized and the prices were just right. One of the best Chinese restos in the area."}
{"text":"Good chinese style food with decent prices, like the ambience and proximity to metro so you can easily get there. Overall a good place to munch"}
{"text":"I just love the Chinese food of Montreal. And now I know why. It seems that the northern regions are inhabited by, you got, it Northern Chinese. Hunan and Scheuan dishes abound and it's not the kind we have back home in the South. 
   Today I had the hot and sour soup though thick with ingredients was surprisingly not that hot or sour. The cumin beef however was wonderful. Salty yes, as some have commented but when you enjoy it with the plain white rice and shredded iceberg, it's perfect! 
  Love to go back with a crowd and try more items on the menu. I would shoot for the specialties and anything with a chili next to it."}
{"text":"All things considered, especially this being Montreal, this place is pretty good. I was pleasantly surprised, and was delighted that there's Chinese food on St. Catherine St."}
{"text":"Have been order from them for ages, then today whoever picked up the phone decided I no longer lived within their delivery area. I politely told him that his website clearly states that my area falls within the limits but he refused to take my order. 

Change your website."}
{"text":"Vraiment, vraiment très bon!

Comme il a été dit par d'autres, le service n'est pas toujours excellent (tout dépend de qui nous sert)... la barrière linguistique est souvent présente."}
{"text":"A nice place to have lunch in between classes. 
The service is fast, the food is inexpensive (they have lunch specials for 8$ includes soup and meal), and they accept cards.

I got the general tao chicken with a won ton soup and Adam got the sesame chicken with the spicy soup.

The spicy soup was too spicy! I recommend getting the won ton.
Both of our meals were good. The little salad on the side was the only thing that looked a bit bleh. It was just lettuce on a plate so nothing appetizing about that.

I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Been there countless times for their pan-fried dumplings and eggplant hotpot.  Otherwise, a perfectly fine cheap-Chinese restaurant."}
{"text":"PROS:
1. The food is authentic Chinese and realllyyy delicious. I ALWAYS get the eggplant & tofu dish (best!!!), 

2. Service is quick and food comes out in a blink! 

3. Personally I'm not Chinese and usually prefer to avoid Chinese restaurants because I am not a fan of generic general tao and fried balls but PM's food offers AUTHENTIC cuisine which I think also caters for everyone's taste buds. 

4. Complimentary dessert of either: taro & tapioca or sweet red bean soup

CONS:
1. The food is verryyy oily... but I suppose that's where the flavor and texture comes from? 

2. I would give PM 5 stars if the decor was nicer and the service was a taaad friendlier.

OVERALL:
-PM's a good place for quick, casual eats with friends & fam.
-Get the Eggplant Tofu dish. You will not regret it!
-This is my Go-To place for Chinese food."}
{"text":"The food quality is excellent and authentic.  The portions are pretty big.  I really like the hot and sour and corn (egg drop) soup.  It's very tasty.  My fiance likes the corn soup there.  We normally order the spicy calamari and eggplant tofu for us two.  I made reservations for my family of 11 people and they gave good ambiance and fast customer service.  My family like the food and service so much we came back again 2 days after.  We order a lot of different dishes and they were amazing.  First dish finished was the Chinese broccoli and mushrooms.  Favorite dish was the beef stew and orange chicken.  They kids ate the chicken fried rice with no soy sauce.  All 9 dishes was finished!  The price is reasonable and fairly inexpensive.  We loved it."}
{"text":"In all honesty, it's been quite a few years since I've had Chinese food. Mostly I got tired of eating out at the greasy dives back home. We were wandering around the neighborhood and figured what the hell, we're on vacation and the reviews on Yelp were encouraging.

It was crazy busy on a Friday night, but we only had a quick 10 minute wait for a table. Just be ready to share a table if there aren't many open spots. The staff was friendly and attentive and took time to answer our questions despite how busy they were. The hot and sour soup was amazing. We had some peppered beef and chicken with broccoli, pretty simple dishes but both were flavorful and very good. I walked out of there feeling full and satisfied and not like I just ate a big greasy meal. Which for me, is a sign of good cooking. Like Jackson Z. mentioned below, we were handed two menus one with more familiar dishes and the other with chef's specials.

Great spot with reasonable prices and hospitable staff. Recommended if you're in the area and craving some good Chinese grub."}
{"text":"Randomly went to this restaurant for lunch and had the Pad Thai and I was amazed by the portions as well as the consistency. It was delicious! Would recommend it to all. Service is very nice and my server asked me for any allergies. It's a hidden gem but the food is good."}
{"text":"Not recommended at all. The service is disappointingly poor. I found dried shrimps and chicken feet in my order. I ordered shredded pork but instead I received the items above. I fought for a refund, which I received after a lengthy argument with the management. The management was being aggressive, rude and made racist comments regarding my ethnicity. The food got delivered one hour later after being ordered. The other dishes were cold, blend and tasteless. The food was definitely not worth the price of purchase. I would not recommend anyone order from or dine at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Open til 11 pm on this happening part of Ste. Catherine Street, the trilingual (Chinese/French/English) menu has all the standards.  Many lunch specials for around $6 (tax included).

The fried tofu with oyster sauce was the highlight, but the other two dishes (chicken with ginger & shallots) and the Cantonese chow mein were great too."}
{"text":"It was a Sunday, it was late, and I was desperate. After my first 3 choices (including Kazu- insert sad face) were either closed or unfindable, I stumbled upon this place. I asked an exiting patron how the food was. She said it was good, cheap, and recommended the eggplant dish. I entered. I had the eggplant dish (#36) and steamed dumplings. The dumplings were mediocre. I've made better tasting ones at home. The eggplant dish was fine, but again, I've had much better Asian eggplant dishes. It was a large serving with huge chunks of fried tofu. I found the sauce to be bland. The service was cut and dry at first, but he eventually warmed up a bit. With all the other great options around here, I would not eat here again."}
{"text":"Ownership/management changed a while back.  Food not as good as it once was.

The wait staff are pretty good, and as others say - service is very FAST! 

Nothing to go out of your way for, but one of the better Chinese options in the area.

Some dishes are far too oily (and I hate to think what type of oil they use).  Would be great if they would address this issue."}
{"text":"We were the only non-Asians during dinner time and the staff spoke little English or French - it's that authentic! We ordered the Chicken Hot Pot, Beef ChowMein & Dumplings for about $24 total. Superb food & amazing value!"}
{"text":"3,5 star
Staying at Le Nouvel Hotel. Very fast delivery, nice delivery guy.
Food is good but not great , classic menu, 
Noodle were good but a bit too dry
Soup was thick but pretty tasty
Vegetable mix was average...
White rice is ok


Good solution for quick dinner at a fair price"}
{"text":"Above average Chinese fare.  Bonus was $35 (didn't order drinks, though) for 5 people.  Amazing value for money especially in d/t MTL."}
{"text":"super génial!! love this place!! we had the Japanese tofu with the eggplants and minced pork sauce! amazing, not too fat or salty and great service! I will for sure be back"}
{"text":"This has been my go to place for Chinese food near the Concordia area for so long that I'm surprised I haven't reviewed it yet! The food is quite good and if you know what to order, there are definitely certain dishes that are absolutely amazingggg. (Hint: try the japanese tofu w/ eggplant). 

The staff have always been super friendly and the prices are very reasonable. Is this a perfect place for date night? Definitely not. But if you're out with a bunch of friends and craving some Chinese food where you actually want to sit-in and eat, I'd definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"I'm quite fond of this Chinese restaurant. Located in the heart of downtown, its surrounded by stiff competition. I actually used to go to WOK cafe down the street for all my chinese needs but had a change of heart after trying PM one day. Its lunch special is unmatched! At 7.99$ for your choice of wonton or hot and sour soup with your choice of main plate from black pepper beef to general tao chicken (generous portions), yet not too much food, the deal has me coming back time and time again. They even honour this price for take out during the lunch hour. This restaurant is also great for groups. They have several large rotating round tables that allow for groups to order several dishes to share. Just don't expect a fancy type restaurant cause its not, but it is worth a visit for a casual Chinese lunch. Their delivery using the \"Just Eat\" app is however terrible. Both times we ordered and specified that the delivery time be for 8pm, both times, they brought it for 6:30 pm, which is completely unacceptable."}
{"text":"We went there as a group of 12. The food was delicious and the sauce was unique, especially the XO sauce.

However, the service is terrible there. Sure they pour out the beer in front of us, but that doesn't do anything if the rest of the service is slow and takes several minutes between dishes to come out. It just left most of us hungry and impatient.

The icing on the cake is that they have the gut to force us to pay 10% in an extremely unfriendly matter. Because the service was slow, I tipped very little, but she kept insisting I have to pay more even though it was apparent I was reluctant.

Anyways, suffice to say, they have good food, but they focus too much on money and not the service itself."}
{"text":"BBQ Duck and Sesame Beef are to die for ! Very reasonable! Great Value!"}
{"text":"We ordered their food online front the website which is not really user friendly. The website is full of pictures which is really nice and straight forward. But when we try to check out, the page just crashed TWICE !!   On the 3rd time, we finally got our food ordered and received a confirmation email.  The delivery took about 50 mins to arrive for 3miles distance. 

The satay beef bowl was delicious but the tomato beef rice bowl was a letdown. The rice is not fully cooked!! The side rice came with satay beef is okay. We are not sure why there was a huge difference between two rice dish."}
{"text":"Reservations done easily through Yelp and table was ready at the correct time. Very busy and noisy place - you definitely should consider reserving to save a seat. Quick and courteous service. Reasonable prices though portion sizes are quite smaller than what'd I am used to from Chinese restaurants in other areas (Cote des Neiges). Very delicious food, however, and excellent selection. Worth checking out."}
{"text":"I came on a Saturday night for supper and it's not too busy, the restaurant is set up with round and rectangular tables that you can choose. The food is decent, the portion is fair, and the staff is friendly overall."}
{"text":"This is a nice inexpensive place, perfect for lunch or quick dinner. The service is very friendly and nice and it can get busy on Thursday early dinner time. The dishes are okay, but then again I'm a Chinese food snob so the dishes did not impress me that much. Still, it was a good experience, solid 3-3.5 stars for me."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant, the option of having soups in small, medium and large is particularly appealing and the Tom Yum was oh so very good indeed! Dou Miao is one of my favorite Chinese vegtables and PM did it the best so far in my experience, not salty at all with a light garlicky flavor that was simply scrumptious. The egg rolls were a little disappointing, quite bland, so I wouldn't order them again. Table service was very responsive; food arrived quickly from the kitchen and the price point was inexpensive imo. This little resto will stay on the rotation for sure when I am visiting the city again."}
{"text":"Went for supper with friends after a gym session. We had General Tao, seafood soup, japanese tofu with eggplant and pork, shrimp mayo, and salt and pepper pork chops. It was not my first time going to P.M, since it is really close to school and relatively cheap, I often go there for lunch. Waiters are usually really nice, they speak english and french, which is rare for a chinese restaurant, and are able to answer any questions about the menu. 
Most of the dishes come in great portions, from the one we ordered, only the general tao and shrimp mayo disapointed us in size (usually, I am satisfied with the portion given). 

Most of the dishes I had today were good. Soup was nice and hot, perfect for a winter night. Jap tofu had a really smooth texture as always, I always go for it whenever I got there. They gave us a really big serving of salt and pepper pork chop, which also tasted good. Shrimp mayo had a bit of a mushy texture (maybe because we didn't eat it fast enough). The general tao was the only thing I did not really like, it was just too sweet, and not spicy (my white friends like it though). 

As always, it was a good experience. Will come back."}
{"text":"I ordered from here for delivery one evening. Delivery was quick, and the deliverer was very polite. The restaurant accommodated my requests, which was great. Although I only ordered Chinese broccoli, and steamed rice, it was very good! Prices were also reasonable. I would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Fast delivery and very friendly delivery driver. However, the food, for how pricey it was, was really bland. The beef was really tough, and had the consistency of shoe leather, and the fried rice was dry and flavorless. The soup was just heated water. Perhaps they were having a bad night, but thoroughly disappointing."}
{"text":"After hearing a friend rave about their one dish, this minced pork, fried soft tofu, and eggplant casserole kind of thing, which he had some time back with his family, and c'mon let's be honest it sounds too good not to try, I was immediately convinced and had to try it. So we went and ordered just that, plus a hot n sour soup, and some rice, which ended up filling us... The portion size of the casserole dish is that generous. Soo anyway, according to him it wasn't as good/tasty as it was when he had it a couple of years ago, and yea the eggplants could've been more flavorful (it seemed like it wasn't well marinated/cooked enough) however I enjoyed the dish nonetheless. The tofu was very soft and went well with the meat and eggplants. If you're into tofu and eggplants like I am, I still think it's a dish worth trying, maybe they will cook it better another day. :)"}
{"text":"After months of being bugged by a friend, I finally gave this restaurant a shot. 

We had the 'japanese tofu with eggplants and minced pork' and the 'half BBQ duck with special sauce'

Japanese tofu: Good food, but I've tasted much better ones in other restaurants. This one simply lacked flavor all around. It seems like the flavors didn't come out due to unknown reasons, I haven't seen it being cooked so I can't tell what went wrong. Same ingredients, same dish, but lacking flavor. 

Duck with special sauce: I've also had better duck in sketchy chinatown places. The 'special sauce' mainly consisted of hoisin sauce. It was average tasting.

Overall impression: very average tasting food. It's food that can be cooked by almost anyone with a palate and a bit of experience."}
{"text":"Before I go into the review, some tips at eating at a Chinese restaurant, hopefully will add more to your dining experience.  Trust me, I have been a Chinese for over 32 years, I know a bit about eating at Chinese restaurants.

1)  If you seek authentic Chinese food, it's a good sign when you see lots of Chinese people eating there.
2)  Most authentice Chinese restaurants have two menus, one is filled with westernized Chinese food (think orange chicken, egg foo young), the other contains \"real\" authentic Chinese dishes.  In some restaurants they will hand you one menu as opposed to the other, depending on if you are Chinese or non-Chinese.  In some places they will hand you both, which is what they do here (or was it because we had a \"mixed\" party, with myself and two non-Chinese people, hmmm...)  At this place, the booklet menu is the western one, the oversized one-page menu is the Chinese one, and contains more adventurous dishes like steamed whole fish, so choose accordingly.
3)  Family style dining is what Chinese people typically do.  That means we order for everyone and we share all the dishes, instead of each person having their own plate of food.  Try it, it's fun.

Now, for the review.  This is an acceptable Chinese restaurant, which by my high standards means it's decent, especially considering that there's not as big of a Chinese population in Montreal, at least compared to other Canadian cities like Toronto, Vancouver, or San Francisco in the U.S., where I live.  I was really keeping my expectations low, because it's also in a very touristy part of town.  That said, I was just relieved that the dishes were not overly oily and sugary, which tends to be the case in many restaurants that cater to western taste.  They have a decent selection of authentic Chinese/Cantonese dishes, including steamed whole fish, boiled chicken, stir-fried lobster in a ginger scallion sauce, etc.  I also had a bowl of shrimp wonton noodle soup here another day, which has wontons stuffed with fresh shrimps and ground pork, along with nice and firm egg noodles.

Again, not great by my high standard, but OK enough that I would eat here whenever I'm in the area, which is saying a lot.

P.S.  Fortunes from the cookies are funnier if you add \"in bed\" at the end."}
{"text":"Its good enough for me for last minute nibble. Many tables, smile service. Many choices. Fast."}
{"text":"This place is just okay. It's family style, so think huge portions, not very subtle taste, loud restaurant and questionable cleanliness."}
{"text":"I came here with a Chinese friend who eats here all the time.  We were a large group which was great as it allowed us to try a lot of different dishes.  My friend ordered and chose a really good variety of dishes: oyster mushrooms with some kind of greens (I didn't try this), eggplant with tofu, fried halibut, chicken and ginger, lamb with cumin and some kind of green pod thing and baby bok choy.  I really liked the eggplant-tofu dish; the tofu was very silky and the eggplant soft-textured and deliciously garlicky.  I loved the lamb; it was a unique preparation that reall worked.  The fried halibut was really good; the sauce had a carmelized flavor that wasn't sweet and very good.  The bok choy was excellent, very tender but still crunchy.

The best part was the price: roughly $18/person including tax and tip."}
