{"text":"Nice friendly staff and welcome environment, great food! Definitely recommended if you stay in Scottsdale area. Great location and the place has free wifi which is a plus for family with teenager kids"}
{"text":"Good food, reasonable prices and friendly staff! Would recommend it if you're nearby."}
{"text":"My family came to the opening of this new restaurant -- a variant of the \"Good Egg\" and \"U.S. Egg\" theme, though unrelated -- and REALLY liked the menu, the atmosphere and most particularly the service. 

The waffles are HUGE and tasty.  Their omelets are fluffy and filled with interesting combinations (they'll custom-build yours if you like) ... their Eggs Benedict are amazing.  I haven't tried everything on the menu yet, but everything sure looks good, and each has a little creative twist that takes it out of the ordinary.  They serve different strengths of coffee in carafes; I prefer the \"bold\" flavor. 

Our business networking group used to meet Thursday mornings at the IHOP a mile or so to the west, until food, management and service at IHOP became so awful we had to look for another place.  We found it at \"The Egg I Am\", which has been our regular meeting place for several weeks now, and a five-star experience for every one in the group.  

(Why do they not use the name \"The Egg and I\" like the rest of the chain?  I guess because that name was already copyrighted to another entity in Arizona.  So they chose a name that sounds kind of Dr.-Seuss-ian ... and just BTW, our regular server's name is Sam.  They might even make green eggs.  You could ask.)   =D"}
{"text":"Normally give this place a 4 . But today was do bad my wife ordered French toast no powder sugar got 1/2 piece of toast took over 1 hour 30 mins."}
{"text":"I was delightfully impressed on my 1st visit to The Egg I am.  The owner, Robyn was greeting everyone; the regulars and new customers, like myself, as if we were family. Even other customers were eager to have conversations with me. I felt very welcome, the staff was kind & prompt and the owner took time to visit with me. I ordered a sandwich & salad; very well plated & delicious. I recommend this place to anyone. thanks, you made my day. :) Jen G."}
{"text":"Honestly this place is beyond amazing, service is amazing and staff members are excellent. Place is sometimes slow but who wants to be in a crowded, loud place all the time!? I heard it was hard for when they first opened but now two years later they are greater than great. I love it. Food is amazing and waitresses are very understanding and listen for your requests. Food is taken out fast and you are never rushed. There is a beautiful patio outside that has an amazing view of E Via Linda. The manager is very loving and she notices everyone. This place is the best breakfast place I have ever been to! Highly recommended(:"}
{"text":"Dont eat here unless you want mediocre food and terrible service. The owner or whatever woman is in charge is extremely rude, and extremely unprofessional. So is the the service staff, but you could expect that from teenagers, not grown adults."}
{"text":"Well now I know why 'egg' is in the name. They have omelettes and skillets which is fine. But what if you don't want eggs? Well there's French toast, oh wait that has eggs. Well what about pancakes, no eggs again. That's ok i'll just have a waffle-EGGS. The food was good, waffle was a bit dry but there are eggs everywhere. You can ask for it without but if you didn't know it came with eggs, you'll get an eggy pancake. I'm surprised there isn't egg coffee! If you want eggs, great! If not maybe try somewhere else."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times and have enjoyed every meal.  The portions are generous and the prices are fair.  I don't think it's the healthiest food around, but if you want a good breakfast, this should definitely be on your list.  My dad also liked this place and he doesn't like eggs, so it's hard for him to find breakfast places that will cater to his aversion.  He asks for an extra english muffin instead of eggs, and the waitress was very accommodating."}
{"text":"Presentation was good. Food was way too salty and lacked flavor. The fruit platter was one of the better ones seen in a while. Our side of salsa took 10 minutes to get here which was about enough time to finish our meal. 

We did walk right in and get a seat. It's quite and service was good (besides the salsa which didn't seem to be her fault)"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for the first time this morning.  She ordered the Mushroom Hash and enjoyed it; I ordered a Mediterranean Frittata which was quite tasteless; upon paying for the meal, I suggested to the hostess that they add Greek olives or something to give it flavor... the owner went to the kitchen and came back to tell me that the eggwhites make it tasteless... she could have said thank your to your suggestion; but instead defended her chef and the food... like I want to go back to get argued with? not!

I'm glad I didn't tell them that it was over cooked to the point of being rubbery and that the use of precooked frozen chicken bits adds a cardboard taste... if the chef defended that preparation of bland stuff; he/she has never experienced the flavors of the Mediterranean.

I would have given it less a rating but she only made me mad enough to not go back... and my wife seemed to be ok with her food"}
{"text":"One of my all time favorite breakfast places. Their eggs Benedictus is the best! Pair with a side of pancakes and you can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"*UPDATE- I was contacted within an hour of leaving my initial 3 star review by the owner of this restaurant with his personal phone number to call. Sean was not only apologetic for what occurred but completely sympathetic and is willing to have us back with the meal on him. While this was in no way my intention THIS is how you earn the respect of your customers. Thank you! 



Was excited to get a buy one get one free entree in the mail advertising new ownership for the restaurant. Had first been a couple of years ago and wasn't overly impressed with the food so I hadn't been back even though it's in the neighborhood.
I took my 4 year old daughter on Saturday morning, restaurant was full but we were sat quickly by the friendly hostess. Our waiter was at the table in a matter of seconds even though you could tell he had a lot of tables he was covering. My daughter had the waffle off the kids menu and I had the two egg breakfast. The food came out incredibly fast, when your with a toddler that is always a good thing. Everything was plated beautifully and you really get a lot of food for the close to $10 price tag so that was great! Taste wise I feel that the breakfast potatoes were soaked in so much oil I really couldn't eat them and everything else was only \"ok\". We unfortunately didn't see our waiter again to refill drinks and when he did come back he had to ask if he had already dropped off the check (?). Went to pay the girl at the front who was the same hostess who sat us. I gave her my buy one get one coupon and she was unable to apply and went to get another young lady who told me I could not use for the kids meal...she said it was only valid on two full size entrees but I could use it next time and actual save more money by doing so. The math just doesn't add up. Why in the world they would prefer to write off a $10 entree compared to a $6 kids meal is beyond me. I have looked the coupon over and over and no where does it state that. I am a single mother, I rarely get to go out to eat and when I do I have my child with me. So the ploy that got me through the door is the same one that will prevent me from coming back. 
Overall I really liked the idea is this cute neighborhood restaurant but I think my experience may have been a customer service fail."}
{"text":"Had the best chicken salad sandwich ever today! I had the most friendliest server. Thank you Adam for being so detailed oriented with my lunch and making sure it came out perfect. I'll definitely be back and ask to have Adam as my server again!!"}
{"text":"Love love love! My boyfriend and I were in town to visit family and decided to stop here for breakfast on our way out of town (8-12-16). The service was great our waiter was friendly and informative about the back ground of the business (I wish I could remember his name) and one of the owners even came out and introduced herself to us. The food was delicious, hot and fresh! We are definitely planning to come back next time we're in town! Keep up the great work guys!"}

{"text":"The service is friendly and fast. The food is fresh and flat out good!! I look forward to going to The egg I am because it is very consistent. Everybody is happy to help to ensure you have a pleasant meal."}
{"text":"Exceptional service and great food. Try the berry berry smoothie. I couldn't believe how clean everything was...even the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome. Great service. Very friendly and comfortable. Very clean. Crab cakes Benedict were perfect. Crab cake stood up to the hollandaise and egg without turning mushy, and you could taste the crab. Need one if these in Ahwatukee!"}
{"text":"Had a nice breakfast, I tried the Mexican Omelette and it was very good. I recommend getting the salsa on the side as my omelette had a lot of salsa on it. They had fresh squeezed lemonade which was really good as well. If you need to get some breakfast this place was great since it's in a nice location."}
{"text":"Visiting from So. Cal.  I had the spinach mushroom omelette and my wife had the wild mushroom frittata. Prepared very nicely and did not skimp on ingredients. We also shared a bowl of green chili chicken soup. EXCELLENT!!  Vivianna was our server. Very personable and attentive. WELL DONE!!!"}
{"text":"Just finished a great breakfast. First time to Egg I Am and we plan on returning. I had the Mexican Omelet. Just the right spicy taste from the churizo. My fiancé had the egg-eptional which is said was deli ious and full of fresh ingredients. Nice clean atmosphere ."}
{"text":"Have been to this place several times; last week was the absolute last! Poor service, mediocre food (how can you get eggs wrong??), and pricey. Owner was out of town and the place was run by a bunch of kids. This is the kind of place that should be overflowing with people from the neighborhood, but there is hardly anyone ever in there. I know why. Too many other eggeries to choose from."}
{"text":"The food here is amazing! I consider my boyfriend and I to be regulars since we have been coming here for about 1 1/2 years. We live down the street and the location is absolutely beautiful. My boyfriend and I have no complaints and we have recommended The Egg I Am to friends and family. Not sure what the complaints from other users regarding the owner, Robin. I think she is a fantastic person overall, very well-respected and has been nothing, but kind to me since I have been coming here. I feel sorry for the other users who cannot see that she is running a business and do not know what it's like to run a business. Great food and great service."}
{"text":"The manager is rude no only to customers but to her employees as well! Save yourself the money and make breakfast at home!!!"}
{"text":"I always love to try new places for breakfast so I met my girlfriend at the recently opened \"The Egg I Am\". Not quite sure why they didn't stick to the franchise name of \"The Egg and I\" as it is listed on line under that site. 

I had no expectations whatsoever. I'm tired of going to new places with high expectations and then being so disappointed. I walked into a very lovely brightly lit dining area with ample, but not crowded, seating. They have lots of booths (always my first choice for seating). Unfortunately, the place smelled a little \"eggy\" but they wore off shortly after I was seated (within a couple of minutes). 

Our waiter was very friendly . . . he had a big smile and a fantastic attitude. He explained the various types of coffee they serve . . . including a Rainforest Blend (Rainforest Alliance Certified) which was deep, bold and delicious. I had the Athena Scramble which was yummy. I hate when eggs are overcooked and these were just perfect! The asparagus, Portobello mushrooms and feta cheese were plentiful -- no skimping here. The ranch potatoes were okay, not bad, not great. I picked out the crispy ones which were the best of the lot and wished I had asked them to burn them . . . then they would have been just right. My friend had the raisin french toast which she enjoyed, but then wished she had ordered the pancakes. I have to say, the raisin french toast smelled so good with its dollop of cinnamon butter. I can still smell it now. 

Both the breakfast and lunch menus have many choices, both decadent and healthy, and the prices are extremely reasonable. I have a feeling I'll be going back often."}
{"text":"This place is now out of business.  I has been replaced by another breakfast spot in the same location.  No surprise there. Let's see if the new place fares any better."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular, just the usual eggs, pancake, soup, salad, and sandwich spot.  The owner is very friendly.  The waiter we had was overly so:  calling the men at the table buds and buddies.  A word to the owner, and they were sirs and gentlemen on his next trip to take an order."}
{"text":"Been many times and always enjoy. Staff are friendly and they never rush you. Great for gals who meet to share a meal and catch up as we can talk at length......The fresh fruit cup is good and the eggs Benedict-come in many tempting variations ,never had a bad meal!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bfast while daughter was playing tennis nearby at SRP. Had corned beef hash and eggs. They were quick, courteous and reasonably priced...especially for Scottsdale. Probably wouldn't make it a destination given all of the cool restaurants in The Phoenix area but I would definitely go back if in the area!"}
{"text":"IHOP has nothing to worry about.  That's where I tend to go to breakfast when I want a good quality breakfast for an average to good price.  However, on Sunday they tend to have long lines and a long wait.  So I chose \"The Egg I am\" as a second choice.  Never been there before so I tried it.  
Ordered The whole wheat pancake that came with two eggs and two strips of bacon.  The poached eggs came with some water on the dish so I soaked it up with a napkin.  Bacon was good, not too salty.  The whole wheat pancake was uneventful.  I don't know what I disliked about it the most but I would never order it again and it doesn't light a candle to IHOP's Harvest Grain whole wheat pancakes.  OOPs, did i mention IHOP again?  
Hubby, who always watches his svelte figure, decided that he didn't want anything that came with meats--so he went as an \"independent\" so to speak---a la carte as they say in the restaurant business.  He wanted two eggs scrambled, rye toast, and home fries.  Sorry, no home fries here (he loves home fries---his heart must have been broken, but he didn't say a word because \"Eggs I am\" was my choice) .  Did I tell you IHOP makes excellent home fries?? Oops. They offered him Ranch potatoes instead.  What the H... are those, we wondered and soon found out.  Ranch potatoes are these pale cubes of tasteless potatoes.   Couldn't you put a crisp on those potatoes on the grill right before you are going to serve them to your clients who got out of bed, brushed their teeth, showered, combed their hair, got dressed, and gassed up the car just to get to you for breakfast on a Sunday morning???????? 
BTW, Mr. Slim and Trim (hubby) asked for the scrambled eggs to be made dry --meaning no butter.  So when they arrived, I asked if I could taste them.  And then the revelation:  These tasted like an egg mix not real eggs.  Just like they do in Las Vegas buffets.... they have a mix that they add water to and voila scrambled eggs.  We asked Carol our waitress and she said they were fresh eggs.  Deny, deny, deny.  I have tasted these \"paste\" eggs before and I can tell the difference.  Hubby poured a bunch of jalapeño hot sauce on the eggs and was able to eat them with his toast.  Did we say toast?  The definition of toast is that bread is darkened on both sides.  This rye bread did not enter the crevices of any working toaster.  It was so light that I asked him if he wanted real toast, but hubby being the gentlemen that he is said that the toast was OK.  Do we go out to have food that is OK???  I can make better than OK food (at least for breakfast).  This is why standards in restaurants go downhill because people like Mr. Slim and Trim say it is OK.  
To top off the experience, I checked the bill and it had other items added to it.  Did I have iced tea?  Nope.  Did I have coffee? Nope.  Nothing like a padded bill to top off a bad breakfast.  Oh, excuse me.  I don't want Mr. Slim and Trim to be offended---an OK breakfast."}
{"text":"Had breakfast for Fathers Day with a party of 12.  We were seated and served promptly.  The food was at our table very soon after ordering and it tasted great.  I really liked this place.  The hostess and waitress were great!  I will return!"}
{"text":"Love this breakfast spot! 
 -Coffee: There's different FLAVORS like Vanilla Nut and Hazelnut and Regular
(free refills)
-Great place for a meeting or just to have breakfast/brunch with friends
-lots of parking
- don't forget to pick up a frequent diner's punch card!"}
{"text":"Wanted to give this place a try as the newest breakfast place in Scottsdale and was not impressed at all.  Three adults one child $48.00.  I ordered the biscuits and gravy with three eggs (medium) the eggs came cold with hard yolks.  The gravy was good as I like alot of pepper however the potatos were also hard and you could tell they had been cooked some time ago and then overcooked in an attempt to reheat.  I actually pick one up and dropped it on the table and it bounced like a marble.  My daughter had the french toast and stated that it was good although it too came cold.  We were there at 10am on December 12 and it was not even 25% full yet our food was very sub par.  If anyone thinks this place is a standout they are simply mistaken even the hard wooden benches and decor are a copy of The Good Egg.  I found no feel of home cooking in this place and will certainly not be back anytime soon.  On a positive note the service was decent to bad the cooks couldn't team up.

Update:  I originally gave this place 2 stars however my wife went here a couple days ago and really enjoyed the food so to be fair I am adding a star and will give them another chance.  She said the food was fast, fresh and the service was good.  Ill let you know how it goes."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times.  It's pretty basic, but it's not very pricey and it's pretty good food.

I'm really impressed by the Bacon, the size of the Pancakes, the Egg-Ceptional Omelette, and the very fast service.

I wouldn't say it's better food overall than \"Breakfast Club,\" \"Orange Table,\" or \"Morning Squeeze,\" but if you're in the area, you could do worse than \"The Egg I Am.\""}
{"text":"This was our first time here, so I don't know how it was before, but we had a wonderful breakfast! The service was prompt and everyone was very friendly. You can tell they are really trying to make sure their customers are happy!
As for the food... It was so fresh, well prepared, and delicious!  You can tell it's fresh,  good quality food. 
The restaurant was very clean and the decor is very welcoming and inviting...not \"dinery\" feeling like a lot of breakfast places. Great prices too!  We will definitely be back"}
{"text":"First timer, went for Sunday brunch. I ordered the Bacon Avocado Scramble and the Cambridge Skillet, both were outstanding. Delicious, well-prepared food. Pleasant and prompt service. Manager regularly made rotations around the room checking in on patrons. Strong menu with more appealing options than I was able to try in one sitting. Will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"What is bad about the food at The Egg I Am? Nothing! Food is just simply delicious. We live right down the street so, have gotten some big investment into this little breakfast place. Yum!

Now the service, it could get slow pretty often unfortunately. One time we sat right in the middle of the restaurant and...our waitress didn't even know we were there until...some 20 minutes later when we decided to speak up...But that happens everywhere so, can be forgivable. 

As long as they keep your food good, I am fine!"}
{"text":"well we did enjoy the place..food was good..noise level contained.  Then we went back (Nov. 2017) and found the place is now EGGSTACY ..no more THE EGG I AM..and now way too healthy for us.  If I want to eat bark bits and gravel I shall dine on the ground"}
{"text":"Breakfast is wonderful ! Our first time here loved it as we walked in the door. & was welcomed by the owner Robin . I had chile relleno & eggs YUMMY. My man went for the healthy breakfast oatmeal w fruit which was really good . We are coming back to check out the lunch menu . We are hooked. ."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and moderately priced. Everything we had was great. Staff was very friendly. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"I ventured here for a good breakfast a couple weeks ago and got WAY more than that. 

I came by myself but felt like I walked into a family when seated. The hostess was so kind and welcoming, the food was incredible, and don't even get me started on my waitress who made me want to change the world for better.

I was hungry... like really hungry so I ordered not only an egg white omlete with fruit but a huge apple granola pancake as well. You guys... I was maybe like 7 bites away from finishing it! The omlete was cooked perfectly topped with avocado and the fruit was fresh. And, the pancake - oh my gosh so good. The granola inside the pancake was such a great unique twist.

You have a few options for the kind of brew you want for your coffee and they bring it to you in a huge caraf for refills galore! This made my heart flutter.

As I mentioned, I had the ultimate waitress named Michelle. Want to smile and feel nurtured with love? Ask to sit in her section - trust me! She was the best part of my experience here."}
{"text":"I actually think this breakfast place deserves a 4.5 star rating but there isn't one here. There are a lot of breakfast places in Scottsdale but they all sort of taste the same - except for this one. And it's not just that the whole wheat pancakes with blueberry compote are moist and delicately delicious - my son had the scrammies with turkey sausage and potatoes and the eggs were delicately flavored, the sausage was generous and well seasoned, and the potatoes were crisp - not mushy like many places. 

There is plenty of wait staff around and everyone is extremely pleasant. You get the impression that these folks really like their jobs. The atmosphere is friendly neighborhood - not commercial establishment.

I got take-out a few weeks ago and it was a s good as the dine-in. This place is great."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the chicken hash with pork verde. Very healthy portion but I finished it all. I had ordered a side of salsa which didn't show up until the near end of my meal. Wasn't the end of the world as the verde sauce was very good. Our server was friendly and service was quick. A friend had ordered a Spanish dish and requested the verde and salsa on the side but, it came out with both items on his order. Our server at least acknowledged the mistake and would have corrected it but he was fine with it. Overall I enjoyed my meal and the atmosphere and would have given 4 stars if not for the mistakes made."}
{"text":"Very nice breakfast/ brunch place. Low key and the food is very tasty. Love it. Staff very friendly too."}
{"text":"Although we had been to the restaurants around this place we had never been here before today. That is partly because when we drove by at breakfast time there were always prospective customers waiting outside for a table. We got in today. We were happy with our experience. We noticed immediately that there are a lot of regular customers...one even ordered by telling the waitress he wanted (his name)'s usual. The breakfast menu is large though not overwhelming with several Benedict's, several skillets, several egg dishes, several Latin themed egg dishes, a build your own omelette option and more.  I settled for the Texas skillet and my wife had a Breakfast burrito and both were well prepared and tasty. The waitress was attentive and checked back often. The hostess (manager?) made the rounds too. The difference between 4 and 5 stars is that the lobby setup is confusing, that is departing and arriving customers have to cross each other to pay and get seated, also our waitress pushed us for an order when we were still figuring out the menu and we also had to ask twice for a water refill.   Nothing major and we will be back."}
{"text":"I visited for the second time today and the service was unbelievably bad this time.  The hostess greeted and sat me promptly but then I was left for many minutes without even an acknowledgement from my server.  Once she finally did arrive all I got was \"are you ready?\".   

I ordered the \"Eggceptional Omelet\" which was piping hot and delicious, thankfully.  Another gal dropped off the food and continued snubbing me.  Placing the plate on my table and promptly turning her head to spot some people at the table next to me.  She recognized them and went over to chat for several minutes.  Never asked me if I desired anything else.  A few minutes later my server returned to and ask if everything was okay.  I requested a refill of water.  She brought a small carafe of water and the check.  It was wrong.  The check was for a group of 3 when I was dining solo.  No thanks, I don't care to pay for their meal.  It was easily remedied of course, but still, such a mixup shouldn't happen when the place is so quiet.   

Seems you have to be a regular to get some decent attention at this place.  Or at least a group of more than one."}
{"text":"Hmmmm, I love the name of this place. I have a friend that I meet every month for breakfast so we can catch up with each other's lives. . Every month we pick a new, different place. Sometimes they're just okay, other times it's on our list to return. Egg I AM is a place we plan to meet again our next visit. It was clean, the staff was extremely kind and attentive and it was a place that we could easily chat and not strain to hear each other. (some places are not conducive to conversation). I had a great experience and the food was excellent. The potatoes are called ranch potatoes and were really tasty. I thought it was a great choice...I suggest you give it a try for yourself.  I loved it!"}
{"text":"Arrived at the restaurant at around 11 a.m.  Had to wait a couple of minutes before being seated next to a large group of kids with a few adults supervising.  Coffee was brought to the table immediately, but because of the table with kids, was extremely difficult to talk to the waitress.  The order came out promptly.  The food runner (not the waitress) brought me an order that included a meal with salsa.  I had ordered a Wisconsin omelet which wouldn't include salsa.  I asked the runner if this was the Wisconsin, and he mumbled something about it being a salsa verde ( I couldn't hear him that well because of all the noisy kids at the table next door) and that he would check.  After 10 minutes of waiting and no return of the food runner, I flagged the waitress that had taken the order and asked her. She took the plate away, as it obviously was not what I had ordered and she would get me the correct order.  Well, my partner finished his meal before I got my 'rush' order.  Yes, the food was hot, but it should not have taken 30 minutes to fix their mistake.  When the waitress came back, she said she had taken the coffee off of our bill because of the mistake, a very feeble gesture at best!  The food runner should be trained to know what he is bringing to tables and to be able to offer customer service as well as the waitress."}
{"text":"After much prodding from my Sister in Law, we went.  Awful.  The eggs on my plate were overdone, while my daughters plate was raw.  My husband's omelet was wrong and we didn't even get a sorry.  

We felt rushed to eat and leave."}
{"text":"Stopped in during a recent 3 day stay for the Phoenix Open.  Ended up eating here every morning.  Great service, food, coffee.  I'm not a heavy breakfast person, but the variety here gave plenty of choices.  Had the Artichoke Benedict Florentine first day, and then got hooked on the dressed up oatmeal (granola, blueberries, raspberries on top, fruit on side) next 2 days.  Great breakfasts, filling and healthy choices, and the price was right.  Our servers were friendly and fast every day.  (Wed, Thu, Fri)  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I love breakfast and will eat it three times a day if I have the chance. I also love being able to walk to a restaurant so if I stuff my piehole full of food I can bask in the delusion that that little bit of exercise will burn the food off. The Egg I Am offers breakfast deliciousness (until mid-afternoon) and within walking distance!

My husband and I are creatures of habit and once we find a good thing we rarely deviate on the menu. My husband is a Benedict man and I have never been disappointed with the build-your-own omelette. I really like that they offer turkey sausage for those of us that don't eat a lot of mammals. 

I will keep coming back as long as they are there."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place, good breakfast setting in the nice neighborhood of Scottsdale Ranch.  They offer several choices for Eggs Benedict including a vegetarian choice.  However, the cook has a tendency to overcook the poached eggs...  But if you say someting about it to your server, they are very gracious and will replace it immediately to make things right.  They have a variety of coffee flavors, bottomless of course!  Healthy choices are available for the sportsminded or those who like to fill up on protein.  Good choices for the vegetarian eaters and yes, kid's meal is available too.  For those who are not big egg eaters, they have other choices too.  Lunch choices is on the menu. Service is good, super friendly staff.  Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"Good utility breakfast.  They have an excellent Tortilla soup.  My father in law had Philly Cheese Steak Eggs Benedict with hollandaise  on the side.  I opted for one of their skillets.  Now that Dragon fly closed down  I'm bummed, but this place definitely hit the spot.  Service was also great!"}
{"text":"The new Egg I Am is so awesome. Food was perfect and fresh. Great coffee too.

Atmosphere is nice. A bit generic, but what more could you want from a breakfast/lunch joint?

Service is great too. Our server Thiery was friendly, engaging, and very helpful. 

10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for a less crowded breakfast place that competes with (if not tops) the best around town."}
{"text":"Good breakfast food. Had a business meeting there and it was a good place to do that. I had the veggie Benedict and it was really good."}
{"text":"My wife and I thought this was a nice place and the owner even came over and introduced herself. As we were leaving, we saw the owner at our table and she grabbed a piece food off my plate with her fingers and popped it into her mouth. We were stunned. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Was at Mayo for Dr. appt. Found on Yelp. Great choice. Everyone smiles. Coffee great. Had Colorado Jack- even salsa warm. Food excellent. Coffee never empty. Service fast enough. Start of great day."}
{"text":"My first time visiting this place and I really liked it. Service was really good, but more important the food was excellent. I ordered their salad, soup & half sandwich combo. I'm not a potato soup lover, but I really enjoyed their version-- topped with bacon and chives...YUMMY! I didn't expect the sandwich to be as good as it was. Lots of good turkey meat with fresh avocado, bacon, tomato on sourdough. I even really enjoyed the side salad because of the delicious balsamic dressing. 

I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Guys, please don't waste your time or money coming here... I order their supposedly \"Parisian egg Benedict\" that costs $10. So disappointing.. The poached eggs are still half, the bacon is like a piece of cardboard, and don't even get me start on the croissant underneath... Even the side of fruits they gave was terrible!! I mean, how could you mess up on fruit?? I have been ordering from this place many times and the reason I keep coming back is because the first time I ordered from there the food was divine. But it has only gotten worse ever since. The quality of their food has dwindled. I won't be coming back again."}
{"text":"Located at the corner of Via Linda and Mountain View, The Egg I Am is an unassuming gem!

My daughter and I went for a late brunch today. The restaurant closes at 2:30, so, by the time we got there at 1:45, we pretty much had free reign of the place. We noticed a sign saying that the patio was open for seating, but surprisingly, it was too cold for us to sit there today, as it was completely shaded when we were seated. Instead, we opted to sit by one of the large windows that overlooked Via Linda.

The owner seated us, and gave us each a menu. Now, having a toddler, I'm accustomed to seeing kids menus with crayons to placate the children as they wait for their food. However, The Egg I Am does't use crayons, they use colored pencils. I know that probably doesn't sound very earth shattering, but it was different, and a nice touch. It's nice to see a place try and do things a little differently.

The food itself is fantastic! My daughter ordered off of the children's menu, as everything there is just under $5.00. She opted for the kids' cheeseburger with fresh fruit. I had to do a double take when her plate arrived, because the burger was huge! It was easily 1/4lb. Needless to say, my three-year-old could only finish about a quarter of the burger during our visit. It DID make for nice leftovers, though.

I, trying to maintain some semblance of a healthy diet, opted for the Vera Cruz Chicken and Avocado Omelette http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/G9r4WJwmrNbt75kF3Fnxtw?select=ggmQxiCJgJM41S3nWZuijA#gXr_sj61JYixeVVAZkn_Vw. This is an egg white omelette with diced chicken, tomatoes, onions and green chiles, topped with cheddar and Monterey Jack cheeses and fresh avocado, served with a side of fresh fruit and a small bowl of salsa. It is nothing short of spectacular, imho http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/G9r4WJwmrNbt75kF3Fnxtw?select=ggmQxiCJgJM41S3nWZuijA#FA7aEbJm-oAuPt2xptQ8ww. It's one of those meals, that no matter how large the portions may be, you'll always wish there was just one more bite!

Interesting side note: as we finished up our meals, two ladies sat behind us, and started asking questions about the menu. I happened to overhear that the restaurant makes their soups fresh each and every day.

This is a great place to come for breakfast, lunch, or brunch. One note of caution: be mindful of the hours of operation. The Egg I Am is never open past 2:30 in the afternoon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/G9r4WJwmrNbt75kF3Fnxtw?select=ggmQxiCJgJM41S3nWZuijA#3PIa9nVtZc5NOcTf2dWcZw. So, plan accordingly, and ENJOY!"}
{"text":"A perfect way to start the day!
Just had breakfast here and it was great! Staff was friendly, owner was available and attentive. Did not feel rushed to get out like at so many local breakfast places. Noise level was very low (again, not like other places that assault your ears first thing). Food came out fast. Caraf of coffee and water (so appreciated!) Prices were great! We had french toast - great! With REAL warmed maple syrup. And eggs benedict - yummy! Cooked to perfection. I love that it is locally owned and the owner is there making sure things go ok."}
{"text":"Another excellent breakfast! I know they have other food, but I can't get past the green chili chicken hash. It's delicious! Service was great with a lovely table out on the patio. Can't say enough about how great this place is."}
{"text":"Good breakfasts and each time we've gone the servers have been pleasant and wonderful!"}
{"text":"Extremely good.  Our waiter Justin was perfect...friendly, helpful, and attentive. My Hash was on special and had a chipotle tomato hollandaise that was fantastic. My eggs were cooked perfectly and the combination of kale, crimini, mushrooms, onions, sausage and potatoes with the hollandaise was awesome. Even the coffee was good. This was my first time here and I can't wait to come back. Nicely done!"}
{"text":"Standard breakfast place. 

Came here on weekend morning for late breakfast, if you are in the area, not a bad place to have breakfast.

Hostess was very friendly. Server was good, not overly great, just good.

I tried spinach mushroom bacon omelet. I debated wether to have egg benedict or omelet, this particular omelet is served with hollandaise sauce, so I thought this dish will satisfy my both needs. Breakfast is served with fresh green salad, felt sort of odd to have salad for breakfast but I guess it was almost lunch time.

Nice patio is available, pretty clean overall. If I am in the area, I would come back again"}
{"text":"If you love eggs this is the place. Nice owner, great food, relaxing place. Food is always good! Accommodates groups in private space."}
{"text":"Actually. I gave it a one-star only because the food is fairly good. Too bad the owner treats her customers and employees in such a rude and disrespectful manner.  For the life of me I don't understand why anyone would want to work at this establishment.  

The owner is totally clueless that it's her customers who are responsible for her having a successful business.  She obviously doesn't care if she treats you rudely, as she knows there are plenty of people who will accept such shoddy treatment. 

If you want to spend your hard earned money on a business who really doesn't care if you patronize the place or not, I say \"you get what you pay for.\""}
{"text":"If you like flat tasteless omelets then this is the place for you.  

Normally you pour eggs in a hot pan, then lift the edges while cooking which creates a light and fluffy place to put yummy fillings.  Not here.  Instead, they slop some eggs in a pan then drop a few measly ingredients directly into the raw egg mix, flip it, fold it over and call it an omelet while resembles a folded over egg disc.  Since this method will only hold minimal ingredients without falling apart that is exactly what you get, which saves money for them and cheapens the product for us.  In addition, they most likely cooked it on low heat based on the results, you don't have to monitor it, it just congeals, hence the FLAT egg cake.  Again, saves time for them, crappy product for us.  No thanks!  Because I was visiting some acquaintances, I ended up going here two days in a row.  I actually asked the second day for a regular omelet with fillings inside, was told \"okay\" and got the same cheap omelet again, not to mention some other issues that happened with my food.  Anything out of the norm and they fall to pieces there.  

I don't know how this place is so successful serving eggs like this.  YUCK!"}
{"text":"It's not fancy but it is good. The Egg I Am is under new management. They have kept the same menu but have tweaked it a bit.  One things that is great and better than expected is the kale cooler which is a juice drink.  Very refreshing.  I can't wait to try the pineapple tonic. The breakfasts are terrific with artfully prepared egg dishes and GOOD pancakes. Their sandwiches are carefully prepared.
 I urge anyone who would like to try it or try it again....please do not hesitate."}
{"text":"The hazelnut coffee here is amazing!  I wish I could say the same about service.  My two children and I waited almost two hours to get our food.  We were told that the waitress dropped the plates the first time so they had to remake the food.  I am not surprised because I have never seen so many dropped plates and spills.  It was a comedy of errors.  The waitress spilled cream all over our table and then had an attitude with the kids when they asked her to clean it up.  She actually left cream on the chairs, in my bag, etc.  Not a good experience.

To make it worse, the owner was there and never once came to our table to apologize for the delay or make an effort to smooth things over.  It is not easy keeping a 4 and 8 year old quiet when they have to wait so long for breakfast.

The food was below average.  The pancakes were very dense and dry.  There are much better breakfast places in Scottsdale which is a shame because the coffee is really good."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast:
Absolutely fresh greens, wonderful flavors in my Holiday Hash!
My daughter had a crab cake benedict: fresh crab, beautiful combo!
Didn't have to add anything to my dish, and that's saying a lot in my case!
Top notch customer service and friendly, pleasant staff!
Thank you Spencer for making our first time at Egg I am great!
We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"There are much better breakfast places in the area. Food is mediocre at best. This is the third time I've been for breakfast. Wait staff is nice enough. Ordered corn beef has and poached eggs. The hash was blackend (burnt) and the poached eggs were hard poached. The place wasn't busy at all. Not impressed."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed breakfast here.  Food was delicious and wait staff was friendly .  I've been looking for a place in Scottsdale that understands that green chile is a must-have breakfast condiment, and I've finally found it!  When the meals arrived they were hot, perfectly cooked, and large portions.  Two minor quibbles:  the food was a little slow arriving (almost 30 minutes from the time we sat down), and I like my coffee a little stronger.
  
Overall, an enjoyable dining experience, terrific food, and we'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast spot.  Love the food and friendly staff.  I would definitely recommend this place.  

Scott"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place two stars only because my burger actually tasted pretty good when it arrived.

The place had just been opened for a couple of days when I dined there, so hopefully they've sorted out some of their issues.  There was a very eggy smell to the whole place, and several flies kept buzzing around our table.  It was a hot day, but it usually is in the valley and I cannot remember ever eating in any restaurant with flies bothering me so much.  There were a couple of very friendly and attentive servers in there, but neither of them were mine.  It took way too long for my server to come and take my drink order.  When he finally did, he seemed a little lethargic and uncertain--maybe he was new to waiting tables and trying to figure otu what to do?

 I ordered a burger and chips.  I ordered a kid's meal for my child--eggs, sausage, toast.  I noticed a hair on the sausage.  Yuck! I told the waiter and they replaced the meal, and the manager took it off the check--good practice, but not good enough to make me want to eat there again.   The whole experience just felt kind of icky."}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect from the Egg I Am (aside from eggs). The menu is quite large; I found myself debating between breakfast and lunch.  

From the breakfast side, the whole wheat pancakes looked yummy, as did the omelets and \"Egg-ceptional\" dishes.  Yet the chicken spinach salad was tempting...same with the grilled chicken sandwich (I'm partial toward chicken).

My final decision?  An egg white and veggie omelet from the \"healthy options\" section. It was fresh, fluffy and all-around delicious.   

They're still working out some of the kinks in the kitchen (a few of our dishes were missing a couple components), but the energy and promptness of the staff make up for this.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their meal and it was nice that no one was waiting too long for their dishes (it gets tricky serving 20 people at once...).  All around a solid choice for breakfast."}
{"text":"This is one of those restaurants you'll treat like your hair stylist.  You'll keep their location to yourself so they don't get too busy.  Believe me, they can handle the rush.  Mom and pop owned, you'll feel like you're at home with consistently good food and a large selection to choose from.  I have been coming here for years and have never had a bad experience.  I chatted with the owner \"mom\", Robyn.  She is thoroughly concerned with every person having a positive experience and treats all regulars like family.  Very enjoyable, among the best breakfast restaurants in the state for sure."}
{"text":"Food is super good. Service is great! Nice clean friendly atmosphere. 
Also, great hangover food"}
{"text":"This place is like 'Good Egg', but on steroids. Service is friendly and quick. Their omlettes, pancakes, and waffles are really good for breakfast.

For lunch, get their iced tea - it's made in house and delicious. Their sandwiches are very tasty, and never disappoint."}
{"text":"Great food but a bit of a wait to get seated looks like short of wait staff. I had the Parisian Benedict and it was delicious. Friendly owner and staff. Nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this breakfast joint! The service is always prompt and the place is very clean.  I enjoy their skillet breakfasts and the french toast isn't bad. I also like that they have different kinds of coffee."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here after the re-grand opening and it was great! Jordan was our server and she was so helpful and informative!! I got the cinnamon apple pancakes and they were delicious! I highly recommend the kale juice as well :)"}
{"text":"Comfortable setting, good menu, main courses tasty.  Two requests of \"the egg\".......step up your coffee - it's too weak.... and..... syrup for pancakes is watery and tasteless.  Overall.....good enough to give you another chance."}
{"text":"I'm sorry my wife and I have been there three times now and its three strikes and you're out I don't know what other people expect but I need the serving staff to have some training and I need the meals do not look like they have set under a warming light bye bye finally when you go to the trouble to arrive at the restaurant ready to pay a willing patron and the restaurant is less than half full maybe 1/3 I don't expect to sit in the waiting chairs and then be ushered to a table that is the closest one to the kitchen noise and the farthest-away from a view to the outside.  treat the people that are there with respect and the best choice don't save it for somebody who may not even show up this is not engender return visit impetus"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! My boyfriend and I went there looking to try a new breakfast place. They looked a little busy but not in the weeds at all. We walked in and waited to be seated and stood there over 10 minutes without being acknowledged by the hostess who was helping people pay their tabs or by the servers who walked right passed us multiple times. We eventually walked out and went somewhere else. We will NOT be returning to try their food!!"}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast with prompt, pleasant service. Seems there can be a bit of a wait during prime time bit we just barely beat the crowd at 10:15am on a Sunday. 

The oatmeal are real slow-cooked steel cut oats!

The dressed greens are fresh and cold (AND IN A COLD BOWL!) and everything else cake out piping hot. 

5/5, will return."}
{"text":"We had dogs with us and they were very accommodating! The Manager was super nice and obviously a dog lover! Service on the other hand was average. Server was nice but not great. She did tell us it was her 2nd day, which is fine but she forgot our toast as a Side and didnt put sour cream on the side. Just a bit annoying. We left without ever receiving the toast yet it was still on our bill which was a hassle to take off. 

Food was average. Omelette was small and seemed like something out of a carton. And a little bland with the favors. I don't think I'll ever be back, simply based on the fact that I wasn't amazed and there are so many other great breakfast places in the area. 

At least I gave it a try..."}
{"text":"Ive  been here a couple times because it's pretty close to my girlfriends house.  I do enjoy their food and the service is good.  Not a whole lot to say.  It's a good breafkast spot!"}
{"text":"I went to The Egg I am for breakfast. The service was great and food fabulous.I would go again in a beat"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place because a. It's across the street from my house, b. I love breakfast food and c. The complex itself is awesome. But unfortunately, the food was mediocre and the hostess/manager was really rude to the staff that surrounded her. My boyfriend and I went there for my birthday breakfast and she was yelling at the other hostess and doing it loudly enough that we could hear her. I am a firm believer in treating employees fairly and with respect, and she showed none. As far as the food goes, like I said...mediocre. I won't be going back there anytime soon, regardless of its awesome location and my love for breakfast food."}
{"text":"SO HAPPY this place underwent a reno and has new owners. We live right across the street but didn't come here as much as you would think, due to really spotty service and just a general \"grimey\" feeling. The food was always great, but everything else was so blah. We came in for breakfast this past Saturday and this place has improved, immensely!

Gone is the general frantic feeling at the host desk, the hit-or-miss service and the gigantic menu. In their place is a well-oiled breakfast machine with a streamlined menu (keeping the favorites and adding a few dishes/fresh juices/etc.) and great staff. 

The new owner stopped by our table and others throughout the dining room and made sure everything was great. And it was! It seems like this place is going through the First Watch-ish transition that a few Good Eggs have gone through, and it is a major upgrade!"}
{"text":"pretty good place for breakfast.  The eggs and waffles were cooked just right and hit the spot.  The pancakes are real big and can be eaten by themselves of with butter and honey.  Great taste and not dry, plus they make them from scratch they do not use a mix and they crack their own eggs.  The wait staff is nice, nicer when the place is not crowded. I like this place better then the good egg."}
{"text":"Excellent menu - check.  Food prepared properly - check.  Friendly and efficient staff - check.  Cheap prices - check.  Yes, I am a fan.  Even though I've lived a mile from here for the past year, I hadn't yet tried the place.  What a mistake.  We thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast this morning - and, because my \"skillet\" was so large, will enjoy the leftovers yet again.  We won't be strangers any longer, that's for sure."}
{"text":"If you are looking for great food every time, you must try this place. They do it better than any other breakfast place around. The surroundings are inviting and the staff is top notch. They even have a meeting room!"}
{"text":"Just got back from this breakfast spot and had to write something about It. You know, the name of he game is hospitality... I am not upset about cold Eggs Benedict (I would not suggest cold hollandaise sauce to anyone), or long wait for service, nor the wrong food that was delivered, nor waffle without syrup.... What  gets me is the lack of interest to care for their patrons. Lack of HOSPITALITY. This is what will keep me away from places like this. Everyone is allowed to make mistakes. What happens afterword  is what matters. In this place  what happens after mistakes is ... Nothing! Now, I am not talking about comping meals and free food for that does not do it for me. It is same as doing nothing. Sincere apology and attention from the moment the issue has been identified is what I expect. This is so I can continue having a decent meal with my family and not fight waiters and managers. 
This restaurant does not have anyone to , first notice an issue , and then secondly  provide direction to their team on how to handle it once identified. This was my second and last visit to this restaurant."}
{"text":"It's what you would expect from any regular breakfast place basically - comparable to IHOP. The food was good, not great. The wait staff and host were very nice. The location was great, and I had a coupon mailed for a BOGO so checked it out this morning. 
Ordered the French toast meal (something like $9.50), and added strawberries (+$1), had my eggs scrambled but asked for egg whites (+$1) but they were pretty runny which freaks me out. That may be my fault for not specifying I need them well done. You get a choice of sausage or bacon with the meal. Sausage was pretty decent, just greasy but what you would expect. 
Not sure if other people care about this, but I definitely noticed it - the water they give you tasted like I was drinking right out of the hose. I really wish all restaurants filtered their water. Seems so basic. I was so thirsty leaving and wish I had brought a bottle of water."}
{"text":"The best, the best.  Really know how to scramble and cook!! Coffee is amazing.  The  owner Robyn is great!!! A must for anyone!!!"}
{"text":"I'm angry giving this place ONE star.

Yesterday morning, my boyfriend and I wanted to try a new place for Sunday brunch. We called at 10:55 and were told there was no wait, so we drove to The Egg I Am. 

We arrived and were told there 4 parties ahead of us waiting to be seated (wtf?) which is fine given it was a Sunday morning - but why lie about that on the phone? Okay, whatever.

We were seated after about 15 minutes at a booth right behind the host stand. I felt like I was on a cruise ship, because the guy sitting behind me was fidgeting and it shook our entire table. I figured I wouldn't say anything about it since I would be focused on eating my food in just a few minutes.

Our server came by; she was friendly and took our order. I got the daily special - a \"BTO\" croissant. While we were waiting for our food, the couple sitting behind us left and two workers came by to clean up their table. They proceeded to bitch about how messy people left tables and how customers would leave their own kitchens in the manner in which they left restaurant tables. Okay, it is COMMON SENSE to not bitch about your job/customers around other patrons! Like, I understood their frustrations, but seriously..m professionalism please?

So we get our food. My sandwich was SOGGY, meaning the croissant was previously frozen and microwaved. Ugh. The food was completely lackluster, unmemorable, and average at best. Little egg/meat, tons of greast, canola oiled potatoes. We get our check and are ready to leave when I notice I was overcharged for my meal.

The special was listed as $8.79. I was charged $9.99 plus $0.99 for substituting egg whites. Nowhere did it say egg whites were extra, but whatever. So I go up to this counter and explain to the apathetic 16 year old hostess that I was overcharged. She called over her manager, who looked at my bill, rolled her eyes, and mumbled to the girl \"This is a $0.20 difference\" as if to imply that I was some cheap idiot wasting her time. I pointed out that actually I had been overcharged $2.20, NOT $0.20. She rolled her eyes, fixed my tab, and walked away.

Seriously lady? Even if it WAS only $0.20, then YOU can pull the change out of YOUR pocket to pay my tab. I was appalled at the rudeness of the staff at this \"establishment.\" I can honestly say it was the first meal/restaurant to leave a sour taste in my mouth.

Whoever owns this place needs to clean house and hire competent staff. In an economy like ours, I seriously wonder how these people have jobs."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. New ownership does not accept any coupons. The ONLY reason we went today was because we had a buy one get one free coupon and thought we would give it a try. Ordered some things we normally wouldn't splurge for only to be told we couldn't use our coupon. Food was alright but we won't be back unless the new ownership tries to fix this."}
{"text":"Very poor customers service. Very slow to bring out the food and drinks . The worst part it wasn't busy at all !! I am taking my business to IHOP a much cheaper and more efficient place to get breakfast !"}
{"text":"I was really surprised by this eatery. Not exactly close to home, but well worth it. The staff was very welcoming, the food looked and tasted very fresh at a price you can't complain about. I had the bacon and avocado scramble, with a side salad and English muffin and it was wonderful. 

My first friend had the corned beef hash with eggs and my other friend had the Denver omelette with hash browns and English muffin and loved it.

The service was very prompt, efficient and friendly. Very likely to come back."}
{"text":"Since they have such a big following they treat the customers very indifferently. I am a senior and picked up the tab for my sons family. I did not eat since I have strict food restrictions.  They refused to give me the Senior discount since I did not eat a meal. 

In very poor taste.  I live across the street and will not go back not will my family."}
{"text":"Bonus points for a cute name. This Egg I Am is one of only two Arizona locations. It's a locally owned franchise of The Egg and I (not nearly as cute of a name), a small Colorado based company. That's local enough for me.

I have not eaten here much. I had very good customer service today, unlike complaints in some other Yelp reviews. Greeted promptly. Coffee offered promptly. Order taken promptly. You get the idea. The food did take a while to arrive at the table, but it was hot and fresh when it did arrive. Everything was fine. Nothing we ordered wowed us. It strikes me as very similar in vibe to The Good Egg.

I plan to come back and be a little more adventurous in my ordering next time. Perhaps sit outside on the small patio. I'm also curious to see how they do on a busy Sunday morning. It's not a particularly large restaurant, which I like. It may deserve another star.

FYI, The Egg I Am is more of an egg establishment than a pancake place, thus the name. Whole wheat pancakes are the basic offering, made edible, however, by really good warm pancake syrup."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today.  I found the staff to be available and attentive.  It was around 10:30 and very few tables were full. 

I ordered a greek salad, without the chicken.  It was good, but small.  When I got the check it was for the full amount of the salad (with chicken) and it was $9.95!!  I inquired about the pricing since I did not have the chicken and the reply from the waitress and the hostess was, that is the price either way.  Okay, I get that, but it was not a lot of salad and for the price I felt it was too much.  

I order things all the time without meat and usually the price is adjusted reflecting the lack of meat. 

Oh well, just so so and had to go home and forage some more, as I was still hungry.

Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Our family just moved to Scottsdale from Chicago and we absolutely fell in love with this place. The service is always great, people are so friendly. The food is VERY good and they have great healthy options as well. Someone previously commented it is comparable to IHOP? I couldn't disagree more. I have had so many different meals and its always great. Their prices are reasonable as well. They also have kid options - always a plus especially for us with a 5 year old. Try their new pumpkin pecan waffle that they only offer during the fall - it is to die for! Try this place, you wont regret it!"}
{"text":"Highly don't recommend this place.. The food is just okay. They do not have a pet friendly patio, kicked my dog out to sit in the car, and the only reason we chose to go to this place was because there was a patio area. I've never been more upset by the service. Couldn't finish my food either because customers at the restaurant complained that dog had to be in the car."}
{"text":"Stopped here one day after a Facial while on Vacation.  When I called in my to go order I asked \"What are Ranch Potatoes\".... I'm on Vacation remember & from Chicago. How do I know what the H*ll Ranch Potatoes are? The girl started laughing on the phone and said \"I don't know. I guess just cut  up potatoes...she yelled over....Hey XXX do you know what Ranch Potatoes are?... They are potatoes with Ranch Seasoning on them.  \"Ranch\" could have just been a name for cubed potatoes not like Hash Browns. ;-(. 2 young girls working here on a Friday Morning. Not a good thing. No eating utensils included in Eggs & Ranch Potatoes order? Seriously will pass by this location next time I am in town.I must have missed the Ranch Seasoning taste & I have extremely sensitive taste buds."}
{"text":"Stopped by as searching for breakfast while in the area for business.   Definitely will not go back.  Cold potatoes, not very warm eggs, cold English muffins.....guess you can say its a \"cool\" place.    Also the waiter didn't seem to have a personality nor care if he was waiting on us or not.  Plenty of other good breakfast places to spend my money on in the valley."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for breakfast, service was quick and friendly. And all of our food was nice, hot and was prepared beautifully."}
{"text":"The best part of going to The Egg I Am is DiLynn. She was just delightful. At the end of our meal she asked our names. The next day we came back for kale juice after a hike and she remembered our names. 

Our meals were delicious too! I had the huevos rancheros and they were outstanding. You have to get the green pork sauce...oh my. Flavorful, just the right spice. My husband had the breakfast burrito and was equally delish. And their potatoes were really yummy. 

If we lived in the area, this would definitely be a go to spot!"}
{"text":"I had a most delicious brunch today of apple pancakes bacon and eggs. Kristina was our server and Greg heads up the kitchen. It is a beautiful spot only open til 2 but no one herds you out if you dtay beyond that time. The coffee comes in a pot very very good!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times when I have friends in town this is always the breakfast/brunch place I take them to.  On this particular visit we noticed that on the special's board they had a Salted Carmel Mocha hot chocolate so we all decided to give it a try.  Let me just say... OMG!  Rich chocolate carmel-y heaven in a glass!  The consensus around the table was... This is dangerous. 

I ended up ordering the Florentine Benedict with the Ranch Potatoes. The Benedict was really good, but I tend to like my eggs a tad bit runnier than what came out. Really though it wasn't that big of a deal because taste wise it was still really good.  Those ranch potatoes though, you must give them a try.  Seriously, they are always seasoned perfectly every time I visit, and are crunchy on the outside / soft and warm on the inside.  Haha there wasn't a single potato on anyone's plate when we left, they are that good. 

So if you're on this side of town and are looking for a breakfast/brunch type place... I'd highly recommend The Egg I Am."}
{"text":"My prime spot for eggs Benedict. Outstanding staff. Delicious food. Great atmosphere and music. Keep finding myself coming back all the time but never writing a review. I strongly recommend everyone to try this gem out. I'm sure you will find yourself coming back as well."}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast joint in Scottsdale! I came here last week and the food was so good, I had to come back. Fluffy omelets, good Hollandaise, crispy potatoes, lots of unique menu options. My only complaint is the syrup, which tastes more like Mrs. Butterworth's and less like real maple syrup."}
{"text":"Polite service and food arrived fast on my visit, but food was unremarkable.  Always have high hopes for local places like this because they have greater potential to stand out over some of the breakfast chains that are peppered across the valley."}
{"text":"Came here while vacationing in Scottsdale and it was delicious! Great clean atmosphere, friendly staff and great selection! I got the Colorado scramble and it was so good! Fresh, eggs cooked just right! Highly recommend coming here!!"}
