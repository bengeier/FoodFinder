{"text":"Love this place! It's pretty far out for me but I don't mind making the drive to eat here. A place that offers a mix of Korean and Japanese foods is all I need in life. The staff is super friendly and I love how they can remember my order! The beer selection is fantastic, the edamame is Better than most, and the spicy soondubus are amazing! 

Update: they recently changed their name to K Sushi!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Food was delicious. 
We came on a Thursday during happy hour. Everything was so cheap! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"New management or something..? Only reason i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 was because the sushi is bomb. Apparently theyre not affiliated with K Sushi Bar and Grill but is using their franchise name? The waitresses seemed that they couldnt be bothered to do anything and were giving rude impressions. Poor service is not my cup of tea when going out to eat. I might as well stayed at home to eat then. If anyone decides to go here give the sushi chef tips, i feel sorry for that guy working in that environment."}
{"text":"We don't go to Koi often. But we know the sushi is safe and usually good. My only complaint is that they automatically add gratuity to everyone's tab. I don't know how they can legally do that. The service is ok. Sometimes you get a decent personable sushi chef, sometimes you don't. Sometimes you get a friendly server, sometimes you don't. We love their sushi tho... Spicy tuna, spicy philly roll, spider roll and some of the State named rolls."}
{"text":"Been to this place twice now. First time, the sushi chef let everyone in the restaurant have samples of his newest creation. Then the owner gave us 10% off coupons and gave us complementary sake! 
Second time here, the food was amazing,  chatted with the cook and waiter and the service and food did not disappoint.
Hidden Gem FOR SURE"}
{"text":"First time here. Very good food,service,music, and just a good vibe. Good fresh fish. Very clean also. Deff will be coming back here!!!"}
{"text":"I just went a few days ago. I'd seen this place a lot since I got out of the Army, and wanted some good local sushi. I was very surprised to find that it is a relatively classy place in this part of town. I've also read the reviews and seen that people were irritated by the added gratuity; they removed that.

All that aside, I found the host to be playfully sarcastic. Being ex-military, I enjoyed being ribbed a little about not knowing what to bring home to my mom when I told her I was doing so. \"You don't know what your mother likes?\" I thought it was funny.

We're in Arizona, so there's no fresh coastal fish, but that didn't seem to hurt the quality of the food at all. I saw some really good specials in the place, and a very nice menu selection. The 50 States Rolls option is pretty cool.

I got the Las Vegas roll and my Mom got the New Mexico roll; we both loved it. This place holds its own. I'd recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Every time I come here the food is great; Considering that this place is in a strip mall-esk parking lot. I love the sushi and the Spicy Ramen, always my go-to whrn I come here."}
{"text":"Not bad. A tad overpriced for the food you receive. They seem to use the same ingredients for all the rolls. I've only been here twice, and it never sticks out in my mind. It is in a convenient location since it is right across the street from the Harkins movie theater. There are definitely better restaurants around in the area."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since it opened and I always leave happy. I wish this place was here when I was in high school! They are so fast. My waitress, is always the same lady and she is so funny. I always catch her making her own lyrics to the music in the restaurant. Ha hs. They are awesome here!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice, the food is pretty good but nothing spectacular. I've had way better sushi for less money; but, I'm new to the Phoenix area so maybe their prices are relatively standard for this area. My low opinion of this restaurant is not the food, it's the service. The wait staff does not coordinate who serves which table so both times I went there, three different servers asked us what we wanted to drink, and after that the attentiveness dropped. The servers don't come back to check on you or ask if you need refills or anything else. It also takes FOREVER to get your food. The last time I was there my dad completely finished his chicken teriyaki dinner a solid 30 minutes before I even got my food... and I ordered sushimi. Seriously?! How hard is it to slice a piece of raw fish and stick it on a plate? Their service seriously leaves something to be desired, and honestly the quality of the food isn't good enough to justify continuing to go there."}
{"text":"I would give this place a NEGATIVE 20 stars if I could!!! Seriously yelp, you should implement a negative start feature for places people should NEVER patronize. Lets start off by saying, my BFF and I were craving sushi and looked up a place that was close for both of us to meet, looking back in retrospect I REALLY times a billion, wish we would have went elsewhere!!!! The only \"server\" there was an older Asian lady. She was rude from the beginning, so that was the first red flag, she was talking to guests whom were sitting at the only table in the entire place and we stood waiting for a minute and she didn't even acknowledge us, so my friend opted to take a seat and we chose a table. She then shouted out at us, \"that's a cold table I don't know if you want to sit there\" we didn't know what she meant but sat down and waited for her to come over and then she said the vent was overhead, but the air was off so we said we didn't mind, she gave us menus and took our order finally. The food took forever to come out and the same table that was there when we entered was the only other table, this place was a ghost town. So we couldn't understand why our order took so long, she didn't even talk to us or check on us once, her focus was on the other table the entire time, we had to flag her down or catch her as she walked BY our table to inform her if we needed anything. Then we noticed that the air was running, and it was chilly, she came over to us to bring us another order of miso soup and when she noticed it, she started to laugh and say \" oh, now you're cold\". Um, I'm sorry, but I was under the impression that when people came to your establishment they were your GUESTS and you would value them and their support for your business, so why in the world would you laugh at their discomfort????  Then at the end, our checks came and she had added an automatic tip, which was not explained or any notice given about it, which she claimed there was, and when my friend inquired about it, this lady literally started to YELL at us. No joke. No exaggeration. Like, who does that? If a customer has a question, why are you yelling at them?! You act as if this place has a year long waiting list for a table or something, and even if it did, that's no excuse for being treated rudely and with such disrespect. I seriously cannot believe how badly we were treated here, and I was really looking forward to having a good meal and writing a stellar review for a new place I had found, but no such luck, :(."}
{"text":"Always good sushi and the fried rice is amazing too! It is literally 3 lbs of food and comes with miso soup and a fresh salad. The happy hour is hard to beat. I recommend the sushi combo. It has a miso soup, salad 8 pc roll (few to choose from) and 8 pic combo sushi/ sashimi   For I think 13 bucks. Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"DISGUSTING-the cucumber in the roll was thick along with the spicy tune being slathered on the top of the roll was too thick-Just DISGUSTING. Also order the chicken friend rice-the carrots were crunchy not cooked-Just DISGUSTING-We order honey glazed chicken which was actually good but the fact that they ADD gratuity doesn't make sense when it was just my partner and I-Will NEVER go here againg and I suggest you dont either its DISGUSTING!!!"}
{"text":"Talk about a diamond in the rough!  You are always well taken care of here.  Esther was our server and was a delight to work with.  She was very accomodating and knowledgable about food allergies that customers may have and made recommendations accordingly.  The spicy tuna was just the right amount of spicy, (subjective, I know) and the combination sashimi plate was amazing.  The kawaii nigiri hand-drawn on a sticky note with our reciept was the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming to this sushi restaurant for many years.  There is a wide variety of sushi rolls, and my favorite is the eel roll.  We have friends in California who visit us every December, and they always ask us to take them here for dinner. Last week, I brought a friend here for dinner.  She had never tried sushi before so we didn't order anything too exotic.. California roll, salmon, tuna and, of course, eel.  She is now a fan!  Prices are average for a Japanese restaurant.  It's the food and friendly service that keeps us coming back."}
{"text":"Need to hire a waitress and actually take care of your customers...sitting here for 35 minutes waiting for a to go order, can't pay, see my food sitting getting cold behind the counter while the owner runs around like a chicken with her head cutoff and the dude that's supposed to run the register is too busy telling her about our commenting on the crappy service instead of serving us our food...seriously BAD BUSINESS!"}
{"text":"Best roll i've had at a sushi bar, Nebraska roll.....sooo good!

They have a roll named after all 50 states plus all the traditional rolls.
$24.95 all you can eat deal, which is a deal to me after i ordered 6 different rolls....

Service was great, waitress was nice, quick and helpful.

I don't know the happy hour prices, sake bombers were $7 when i went.

I will go back and try and make happy hour."}
{"text":"I've been to numerous sushi restaurants and I have not had such a horrible experience until I visited this place. First of all, they yelled at us to \"Sit down\" even though there was a \"please wait to be seated\" sign. We chose a booth and noticed that there was a gratuity included and didn't think much about it. Everytime we asked for something, the waiter would question why we needed it, such as more wasabi and then roll her eyes and get it. Extremely rude despite the fact that we were extremely polite the entire time. When we got our check, we asked for separate checks. She irked back and said that we should have told her in the first place so she doesn't have to go back and forth. The problem with included gratuity is that they don't have to put in any effort to earn it. Never again."}
{"text":"The reason for this review is horrible customer service. My friend's ginger was left off her plate and the server was busy. She waited for the chef to be finished with what he was making and asked him for a small plate of ginger. He yelled \"I can not understand what you are saying, go talk to her.\" And pointed to the server. He yelled this is better English than I could have. No one apologized for him yelling at my friend who was being really polite."}
{"text":"Just wanted something quick and gave this place a try.
It was ok because I was hungry and service was good.
Still cant beat the sushi at takamatsu which is only yards away down the street."}
{"text":"Great prices, high quality sushi and rolls and fantastic service!  Try the Mississippi Crazy Roll...Great job Eunice!!!"}
{"text":"I used to love coming to this restaurant I would go there for dinner when I was doing night classes at GCC 10 years ago. They had an amazing sushi chef that would make new rolls for you to try and it was a wonderful atmosphere with great employees and amazing food. I literally went on a weekly basis. Last month I went with my son because I remembered how great it was and wanted him to see. The sushi chef has changed and the food is disgusting now and the wait staff is insanely rude. It took 15 minutes to get a order taken because the waitress was talking with her friends across the room completely ignoring the customers. As we tried to continue with the evening the way just continue to ignore customers including ourselves she seem to think speaking with her friends was more important than doing her job. When you did get her attention she treated you like it was such an inconvenience to pry her away from her conversation. I literally had to walk up to the cash register each time we needed something to get her attention. Unfortunately because of the changes to this restaurant the incredibly rude wait staff and change in food I will unfortunately never go back."}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out for a late lunch on a Monday. The place wasn't terribly busy, just a few other patrons. There were two sushi chefs on duty, more than adequate for the number of people in the place...and yet, our first rolls took 15 minutes to get to our table. Our last roll didn't show up until about 30 minutes after we ordered and they almost completely forgot our Unagi pieces (which I found odd considering the waitress had highlighted all our selections on the order slip to make sure the chefs didn't forget anything). 

They have an all-you-can eat deal for $25 per person. But we were thinking we didn't want that much, so we just ordered off the regular menu, it still ended up costing us $50 for two! Now spending $50 on sushi for two is all fine and good and pretty common. But you expect a little something more when all you ordered was a couple of rolls and a few pieces. Plus, you expect quality...while the sushi wasn't HORRIBLE, it wasn't GREAT or even very good by any means. It was just plain blah! Even the special roll we ordered was boring (I don't remember which state it was named after because all the names seemed to have been assigned arbitrarily and this was all just too gimicky even for me).

They automatically charge a 15% gratuity no matter the size of your order or party. Now, I suppose from their point of view, it was a good thing they did when we were there because we would have leaned more toward the 10% or lower mark. I'm sorry, but tips are given based on level of service and quality, neither of which were supplied in abundance by Koi. My advice? Sushi Eye! Still by far the best sushi I've had since I moved out here, the best price and the best special and original rolls!!!"}
{"text":"This is hands down our favorite sushi restaurant. My friends and I have been coming here for over 8 years and have never been disappointed. Can't beat an all day happy hour Mon-Thurs. Great food, service, and the prices are reasonable!"}
{"text":"I have been to this place a handful of times. The sushi is always great as is the service. They have a pretty good happy hour too. Don't let the outside discourage you from going in, it is well worth it!"}
{"text":"I give it 3. I loved the Utah roll. I don't like any place automatically adding a tip to your bill though. That along with the tip jar on the sushi bar itself makes it confusing just who it is you are actually tipping on the bill. The kitchen? Waitress? Chef? All?"}
{"text":"This place is awesome they don't always have the best service but the employees are always nice and the sushi is fresh and always good. I have been to a lot of sushi around Phoenix and this is by far one of the best"}
{"text":"Horrible place! Took my son out for dinner there ordered him a overpriced chicken dinner and myself a few sushi rolls. The sushi came first. After a while i inquired about the chicken. The staff scrambled to find out when it would be ready. Needless to say i was done picking at the disgusting sushi they served me and it still was not out. I was not offered a apology. Hated my experience. Thought everything was overpriced for the quality. I will not EVER go back. I recommend Yen sushi or Takamatsu over this place any day."}
{"text":"Love!! Love!! Love!! Just got done from eating their Crunchy California Roll for the third time this week! Lol Did I forget to mention how fresh and awesome the flavor was. Everything was made fast and the customer service was great. Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"When I first walked into Koi, I wasn't impressed with the atmosphere, but that wasn't going to stop me from giving the place a chance.

 We had a pretty large party that night, so we were seated in the party room. First thing I noticed was the service, it was taking our server forever to get us some waters, and to bring us our food. I guess the reason why the service was so bad was because the place only had two servers that night. 

Now for the food, the sushi was good enough to eat, but I have had far better. One of my friends seated at the table looked on the menu and saw a picture of this dish piled with meat along with some vegetables on top, well when his dish was served he got the exact opposite, a pile of veges with meat on top. Not only was his dish totally different from the picture but the meat was extremely dry. 

Now for the bill, what we ordered ended up being  outrageously overpriced. Now I always tip well, usually 20 or even 30 percent, so tipping isn't a problem for me at all, but I hate the fact that they have a rule that you have to pay 15 percent gratuity no matter what, even if the service sucked, which in this case it did badly. We ended up being forced to leave an 18 percent gratuity tip to service that did not deserve it. 

Oh and they have other rules too, as if where in some kind of Nazi concentration camp, we are not to leave to go outside to have a smoke or anything else for that matter until the bill is paid. So in conclusion, this place is not worth the cost due to mediocre food and bad service."}
{"text":"Longest Happy Hour in sushi! The quality of food is not the only reason so many people are here on my first visit. The atmosphere is wonderful because the staff is so warm and inviting. I could tell many of the diners are long-time customers because they have a rapport with the staff. I ordered the largest salmon skin salad I'd ever seen. It was good. I tried one of their 50 state rolls. Good too. Enjoyed some raw salmon and tuna also. Very satisfied."}
{"text":"FRAUD ALERT! This will be posted on both K Sushi and Kio Sushi. Why? Because when you google for all you can eat sushi Kio Sushi pops up. So we drove 20 minutes to eat there. Upon arrival we opened the menu and it said \"we will no longer offer all you can eat sushi\". We asked the server what gives. \"We haven't offered all you can eat for over a YEAR!\" Then she claims we looked at the wrong web page and its a \"different sushi place\". Funny how both addresses are the exact same,have exact same sign out front. So they lure the all you can eat crowd in hoping you'll stay anyways. Rip off. We left. We don't do business with crooked people."}
{"text":"This one is a 3.5 stars rounded down to a 3. Mostly because not every place can be 4-5 stars, and I'm not so sure this place quite deserves 4 yet. It's a nice place in a so-so neighborhood. Honestly, if my girlfriend hadn't recommended it I'd never have come here. 

The sushi's pretty decent. They have a neat concept where they have a roll for every state. We go there for girl's nights, so we all pick a few rolls and devour them together. The rolls are nice- nothing amazing, but good enough! The nigiri is a bit better. I split the hamachi with a girlfriend the last time, and that was pretty darn decent.

The drinks here are great. We always go and get the apple saketini. They pack a punch and taste delicious, and the price tag is very reasonable. My girlfriend is a regular though, and I think because of that we get taken care of very well. The server Jade is a hoot, expect to be sassed and taken care of all at the same time! She's great.

Overall this is a nice place. Decent, with pretty good food and drinks. Don't go for the ambience, but if you live nearby and are looking for a fairly inexpensive sushi meal, why not?"}
{"text":"I don't know why people here claim that you don't know sushi if you give this restaurant a good review. i have been coming to this restaurant for over a year and I come for sit-down lunch or dinner or get take-out sushi 1-3 times per month.
The sushi is fresh and tasty, the rolls are original and imaginative (try the Rhode Island roll!), and the service is friendly and efficient. Some of the sushi chefs do add too much rice to some of the rolls, but it's not stale by any means. Some restaurants are more generous with their sashimi, but it's still reasonably priced. I don't find the prices to be any more expensive than other places, and their sushi is very good. I take friends and family here all the time and they are always impressed, whether seasoned sushi fans or beginners. I have never had a bad roll or piece of fish here. I still recommend this place and will continue to do so.
No idea why the reviews for this place seem to be hit or miss. I have always had good experiences at Koi."}
{"text":"THEY AUTOMATICALLY ADD GRATUITY, even for small parties.  WATCH OUT!!  I find that to be very LOW CLASS!!  It irks me because I overlooked it and tipped them double one time.  I'm sure that happens often, and that's why they do it.  They should at least inform you of the added gratuity.   Sad thing is,  it USED to be a great restaurant with good, friendly servers.  Don't know what happened to those employees.

."}
{"text":"My husband won't eat Asian food, but he will eat her... if that means anything. He loves their garlic shrimp. The sushi is good, but I'm not always in the mood for it and am not super adventurous with it. The sesame chicken is good but a little sweet. We really like the place but don't judge a book by its cover. The joint isn't much to look at but the food is good and the service is great, which is the most important part of a restaurant."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi.. Great price. Decent casual atmosphere.. Love the Mississippi roll!! Gratuity tip is automatically added in your bill"}
{"text":"Myself and a small group of friends have become regulars here.

I've always had great service, with maybe 1 exception (a waitress I haven't seen in a long time...).

What's the key? TALK to them. They're a great group and if you're friendly, they're friendly. Any good sushi bar I've been to is social. If you want quiet and intimate, go to one of the snotty overpriced Scottsdale restaurants.

Jade is about as good as they come. We've had such a blast with her - she's even taken sushi from our table and given it to others, which then got us all laughing and talking. And since it's all you can eat, so what?

Yes, there are rules, but every a-u-c-e sushi place has them. There isn't anything unreasonable and if you've been to any of the other ones (I can only think of 1 that is still around in that general west-valley area), it's one of the least restrictive. Trust me, you can get belly-busting full without breaking any rules.

As others have mentioned, there is an automatic gratuity. I'm also not a big fan of this practice, however, I justify it in my mind that you're not just tipping the server, you're tipping the sushi masters. I never leave without adding additional tip anyways, so it's a become a non-issue for me.

Go to get stuffed, or go to try an assortment of different sushi without worrying about paying for something you don't like - it's all good.

If someone in your party doesn't like sushi, they have a regular menu that's pretty typical - teryaki chicken and the like. Enough that it shouldn't stop a non-fish eater from going (but who'd like those people anyways??? LOL!)"}
{"text":"Worst restraunt experience I've ever had in my entire life. I went there with my family and the waitress was extremely rude. I got a beer and instead of asking for my ID the women just held out her hand palm up and didn't say a word. It was extremely rude but I handed her my ID she gave it back and stormed off. Ignored us for awhile and came back with my drink and took off. Five minutes later she returned to take our order. As I was ordering off some paper that she gave me she rudely just started pointing at the paper and again not saying a word. I figured she was talking about some deal that they had for the sushi but I didn't care. I told wanted one roll not two and I'll pay for whatever the cost was. Again she was freaking out and telling me no. I lost my temper and I I yelled back at her. She was being extremely disrespectful. After this happened she kicked me out and started cussing me out. Which you know, I was fine with leaving. I didn't want to spend my hard earned money at this place. Never have I been treated so badly at a restaurant. Definitely would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"The staff at Koi are a delight -- they each have a unique personality that they don't shy from expressing, and after a few visits, you'll feel like your dining with friends, not staff.

The sushi is top-grade, in my opinion.  I've lived in the Phoenix valley for 35+ years, and tried more sushi houses than I care to count, and the variety, quality, and price of Koi is first class.

Visit today!  If you see me there, say hello!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The ramen, the sushi, and the service is all at an unbelievably reasonable price. It's definitely a go to if you're in the glendale area"}
{"text":"This is my favorite sushi place! We go during happy hour and spend only $38 on 4 rolls and veggie tempura. Not only do they have awesome sushi but the sesame chicken is to die for!"}
{"text":"Awesome sushi!  Best in town!  Try the spicy tuna roll."}
{"text":"Love this sushi neighborhood joint. Super friendly service and an extensive selection of fresh, delicious rolls."}
{"text":"I've tried out many sushi joints and this be far is the best sushi I've ever had! I'll definitely be back. If you like semi fried try the New Mexico. Also had the Alaskan. Also a plus is the service! The waiters are friendly, my waiter was a sweet girl. Another plus not expensive at all. I have to say I'm very satisfied."}
{"text":"Salmon skin salad, there was more skin than lettuce on a 12\" plate.  Was excellent had to share so large.  Egg rolls and sushi was excellent!   Will definitely be back.  Waitresses are excellent and engaging.   We will return this time with friends."}
{"text":"Always delicious, amazing service! Every roll you could think of compared to any other place and then the 50 state rolls, ever one I've tried is great! I lived in Okinawa for 2 years and this is the closest to good, top quality sushi your going to find in AZ and it doesn't come with the hefty price tag others try and charge for subpar fish. Very affordable, I've eaten there every week or two for over a year now. Everything about the place is fantastic!"}
{"text":"There isn't a restaurant I'd be happier to see go out of business. The staff is terrible, they add gratuity, so there's nothing to work for for them. Food is ok, but the staff is the reason I would never.come.back."}
{"text":"We love Koi!   EVERYTHING they make is top notch!  You'll love it!  Ask for Jade and she'll take REALLY good care of you... just don't let her pinch you or tickle you while eating!  Let her know we said HI!"}
{"text":"Does anyone work here anymore? Used to come here alot and then the rolls started getting sloppier and sloppier....not quality anymore.. we chose to try again as I wanted some Ramen. Came in and there was one waiter, couldnt give me a drink because they were doing mainenance on the drink machine. The waiter never came back to indicate when we would have our drinks or order our ramen which we were already decided on. We finally just got up to leave and he came walking toward us. We just said we wanted to leave since we couldnt even have a drink and he nodded like he understood our frusteration. Im done trying at this place. Theres basically no staff, theyre always hiring for kitchen and it takes too long for service when its basically empty."}
{"text":"They have the best spicy tuna! Best sushi place so far in Arizona."}
{"text":"The ownership has changed and we no longer go there for Sushi.  I was so disappointed the last time we went in there, the wait staff is very unorganized and they forgot part of our order.  Service was slow and the food not the same flavor or quality."}
{"text":"When this place opened up, I was stoked. Finally something in my 'hood that wasn't: a) a chain  b) fast food c) Mexican (don't get me wrong, I love some Mexican food!).

For months, I drove by Koi, and gazed longingly. I wanted to stop in, but I needed to cook for my family. They do not care for sushi. So dining there wasn't an option either. Finally, yesterday, an opportunity arose where I could dine there with some friends. 

We decided to hit up Koi for a late lunch / early Sunday dinner. As soon as we entered, we were cheerily accosted by a very enthusiastic Korean lady. I'm not sure what she said, but she seemed really happy to see us!

There were maybe 2-3 other tables in the place that were occupied. Not bad for a Sunday afternoon. Upbeat 80s pop beeped and booped throughout. 

We were seated and presented with some very embellished menus and a HUGE glossy menu of 50 rolls -- one for each state. Hoo boy. They seemed to each feature the same 4-5 ingredients (tuna, salmon, avocado, cream cheese, jalapeno, masago), in different configurations. There was also a regular sushi menu. The fancy book-like menu contained Japanese and Korean salads and entrees.

I opted for the Hawaii rolls (tuna and avocado). My compadres ordered the gyoza, tempura veggies, chicken yakitori, an avocado salad, and california rolls. While we waited, our super-cheery server brought some pretty typical miso soup. 

When my rolls arrived, the first thing I noticed was that they were pretty stingy with the tuna. It appears that one piece was used for the entire 6 rolls. Many of the rolls contained no tuna whatsoever. 

They were also very large and loose, making them quite a trick to eat. The rice was pretty bland and the tuna was OK. My friend's california rolls were one step above Safeway quality.

The tempura was pretty good. Light, and not greasy. The veggies were crisp. The gyoza was fried, and I suspect they were pre-made. I usually like mine pan-fried and then steamed. The filling had cellophane noodles, which gave them a weird, gooey texture.

The avocado salad was definitely on the \"will order again\" list. It featured a generous portion of ripe avocado served on crisp lettuce, with a tasty, spicy dressing. The chicken yakitori also got nods for being decently good.

While we were eating, or server kept the drinks coming, and cleared our plates often, which was awesome. She also stopped by with some rather yummy berry wine and gave us each a small shot, and encouraged us to toast loudly when we slung em back.  

My verdict is, while I'm glad Koi is here, don't go there for the sushi. Go there for a cool place to hang out -- for something different in Glendale, that's neither shady nor overblown. The atmosphere is just right -- fun, friendly, and low key. Have some drinks and maybe some fried things or a salad, and toast loudly.

Update! 07/09/07:
I visited Koi again a couple days ago, and decided I needed to come back and give them another star -- just for their delicious, tangy / spicy / sweet octopus salad and their even MORE outstanding service and attention.  

My sushi judgement got a little mellowed out. I had only ordered maki before, and didn't care for it. But one of my dining companions ordered tako sushi, and he found it quite decent (but not great). We did however, have another great time."}
{"text":"Third time was definitely NOT the charm here.  We gave them an honest try.  Hubs went there first several months ago; being a sushi virgin, he thought it was ok.  I tried it with him, and said, \"Meh, just average.\"  We tried again - same thing:  the rolls were unremarkable and the nigiri mackerel (my benchmark for a new place) was just ok.  

We drove by the other night and the restaurant sign was different.  Hmm, we thought - new management??  We gave it a try.  Well, it was obvious when we walked in it was the same place, new sign.  We should have just left but, no - desperate for a decent sushi place close to home, we stayed.  

Ok, so I have NEVER ever, EVER left sushi on my plate.  Ever.  These rolls (softshell crab, and eel) were awful.  I bit into one, and my teeth just kinda stuck in the rice.  I could hardly chew it.  The seaweed was like rubber.  I ended up picking out the middles and eating them, and left 12 empty rolls of rice glop on my plate.  To add insult to injury, they automatically include a 15% tip for any size party eating there, and charge tax on the tip.

Never again.  Takamatsu just down the street at 43rd and Dunlap is way better.  Sorry, Koi, you had your chance."}
{"text":"Really love this place, and I've been many times. I miss the all you can eat sushi they used to have, but their happy hour deals are more than reasonable. A few of the 'state' rolls are going to run you about $10 each and they could easily fill you up.

Happy hours are all day on certain days, and others at very reasonable times. The deals you get on them are phenomenal for both drinks and food. The staff is attentive and like to joke around with you especially if you're a regular. Definitely recommend a visit."}
{"text":"So, I had to spend another 4 days in PHX last month. One of my highlights of my last trip here was Kio Sushi and their killer Happy Hour specials, that I had to re-visit to see if the magic was still there. 

So, it has been 2 years, I know a lot has happened in the world in 2 years, I understand inflation has happened, but was not quite prepared for the increase I found here at Kio. 

So, yes, they have changed their Happy Hour offerings and prices in the past 2 years. -----in fact, I calculated  what my prior happy hour meal from 2010 would cost in the 2012. Well, they have removed the fancier Roll offerings, ---but just for the Nigiri menu, my $20 2010 meal, would now cost over $54 with their current menu----gone is the $1 Nigiri---it is now $3-4 per piece! 

They still had the Tempura for $3.99? --which I ordered 2 of them and I will admit the tempura was still great and they still have the killer dipping sauce----which is a ginger/sweet soy concoction which is so good, I would drink it is they offered it as a bowl of soup

I ended up spending $30 and a meal which was considerably smaller than my 2010 visit-----

All in all, If I ever have to return to PHX, I will keep Kio on my go to list, but next time, will not wait for Happy Hour as it has lost much of its prior glory"}
{"text":"Came in around 10:20 PM the waitress told us the restaurant is closed for the night.  The restaurant advertised there open hours were till 11 pm. When asked why are they closed so early on a Saturday,  they said we are out of supplies! What type of business is out of ALL supplies on a Saturday? Do they not expect to have any customers at ALL? The waitress could have been little compensating and could have said we are out of \"blah,  blah,  fish but we have so and so available is that okay?\" definitely not recommend this place as far as service goes and the environment was very dull, and not clean."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in a month or more but my wife & I have visited this restaurant many times. I alwys leave a bit poorer and we are normally stuffed to the brim. 

First off whenever you walk in everyone greets you. 

My wife & I love the SIZE and fresh flavor of Koi 's Sushi & Sashimi. The quality cannot be beat The balance between rice and fish was perfect. The freshness of the fish was incredible and the rice was just the right consistency and temperature.

Every time we have come here we were seated as soon as we checked in and handed our menu.The menu offers a wide variety of dishes. The ambiance of the place is casual.  The service is spectacular and friendly.  Our glasses were never empty nor did we have to ask for anything we needed since it was provided to us even before we asked for it.  The price was very reasonable for the amount, taste, and quality of food that they serve.  

This place is great!!  The food is always tasty and fresh. I love all of the creative rolls they have but I also really enjoy the simple sushi or sashimi dishes. The menu has a large variety and so most people should be able find something that they would like on it.

However NOT every sushi we have tried there was \"mind-blowing\", BUT everything we've had there was all absolutely top notch and enjoyable.

Service is extremely efficient. You feel completely taken care of throughout your meal. EVERYTHING WAS SO DELICIOUS, IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE

{"text":"Sushi was less than mediocre. The all you can eat is actually for tempura rolls. Nigiri and maki rolls have certain rules such that you can have one roll any 5' pieces of nigiri but even then it lacks execution and not very well done . They also add in 18% gratuity no matter if iris one person or ten. So for $40 you can go lots of better places for sushi than this place."}
{"text":"Service is great and food is fast and delicious! I recommend the Denny roll and the New Hampshire roll."}
{"text":"Freshest Sushi in Glendale. I love their rolls they are fresh with great spicy sauces to enhance the flavor. They also treat you well. The Teriyaki Chicken is a perfect sweet and savory and Asian salad is a good accompaniment.  There Miso Soup is very flavorful and cleanses the palate preparing you for the main course. Their spring rolls were good but tasted like something I would get in the freezer section of the Costco or Sam's. They weren't bad just nothing special. But considering that their State themed sushi is on point, fresh and flavorful I have no complaints they are my go to when I want Sushi without the fusion."}
{"text":"I was here on Thursday and the food was ok but the waitress made the experience horrible. She first took a long time to bring us water and then she got our order wrong. My son accidentally dropped his apple juice and we asked for a rag and she just left it there and didn't offer us a new drink when we asked for the receipt she sat in a table with her friends and we walked to the register to ask for a receipt when she decided to tell the cashier she was about to get it. I am beyond disappointed in the service."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of AYCE sushi places and this is one of the worst. First, you only get FIVE (5) pieces of Nigiri (i.e. fish over rice), which isn't exactly AYCE... then, while all AYCE places are \"rice heavy\", this one is like triple rice heavy with half the amount of fish... Finally, and importantly, the fish didn't look or taste fresh at all... and the Nigiri was almost inedible...."}
{"text":"This place exceeded my expectations for the area.  Service was excellent and friendly, sushi was reasonably priced and VERY tasty.  I thought the fish was very high quality for the cost of the rolls.  We had to order the miso soup, but it was some of the best I've had in a while.  Nice chunks of tofu and lots of green onions in a uniquely flavored broth.  Yum!  I'd like to come back and try their ramen - I saw some at other tables and was lusting for it, but I was too full after my rolls. 

I'm not so sure about the concept of the 50 state rolls, since the majority don't match the state they're from in any way.  However, if you're going to come up with arbitrary names for the rolls anyhow, this seems like as good an idea as any."}
{"text":"K Sushi deserves a way better review! It sounds like all the bad reviews come from people who can't take a joke, or are too cheap to give tips. The staff is ridiculously friendly compared to any other sushi bar I've been too! The chefs always cook us up a special treat, and it is always delicious! You people need to get out of your angry bubbles and live a little..."}
{"text":"This is my second time to this place it's just keep getting better and better.   My friend and I enjoyed the sushi and our salads.  Everything was prepared perfectly and looked amazing.  For those who knock the service down, remember theses guys cater to the American palate and some rolls take longer to make.  So just sit back and enjoy each other's company and wait for some awesome food."}
{"text":"Was my first visit here after and I have to say I was blown away!

Service: Amazing! Promptly greeted, seated and appetizered.

Food: Delicious and the sushi rolls were so good! 

Atmosphere: I felt like I was an honored guest in a clean home. I loved how everyone was having a good time. 

Overall, I am blown away, thanks again!!! Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I have never left a sushi bar so angry and exasperated in my life!
Koi has more rules than a elementary school cafeteria at lunchtime!

They don't let you go outside for ANYTHING once food is on your table... not until you pay the check. 
They tack on a 15-18% gratuity even if the service is sub-par, and normally at places where gratuity is automatically tacked on to the bill it is. 

I was included in a party of 15 for my friend's birthday party and part of the desire to give our patronage to Koi was the All-U-Can-Eat Sushi (which a portion of this party has indulged in on a previous visit). 

When we were seated the waitress told us that a portion of our party couldn't order the All-U-Can-Eat Sushi, it had to be all 15 of us or none of us. 

We were contemplating just getting up and leaving, and we should have. I had a feeling this wasn't going to end well and it didn't. 

The birthday girl decided to stay and we ordered. Then we were informed that they wouldn't accept certain coupons from the Arrowhead Koi... this is like a disenfranchised franchise. The owner seemed to be creating his own rules. It didn't even say Arrowhead on the coupon... it just looked like one they didn't take... according to the waitress. 

The service was slow... very slow and we waited to get drink refills. Then the waitress came back to tell the birthday girl that someone took her order... so she had to wait for it to be remade. 

All the sushi rolls looked the same. There was no artistic value to the food. I couldn't tell the spicy tuna tempura apart from the tempura calamari roll, and the taste reflected sameness. Quite disappointing since sushi is an art form when done correctly (or just done better).

The waitress left dishes and empty glasses on our table for the entirety of the meal, and when she did finally clear things away she dropped dirty soy sauce chop sticks right on the birthday girls lap. Yes there was an apology on the part of the waitress, but it shouldn't have happened.

According to the friends that have come to Koi before they raised their prices... and they don't take American Express and they don't have a Happy Hour - the large beers were $6 - at Yen I could get the same for $3. 

We ALL decided that we are not going to Koi ever again, tonight they just lost 15 customers. 

Pretty pathetic."}
{"text":"Unimpressive is the word I would use for this place. Mediocre food with a disorganized staff.  The price was not worth the food.

We also witness them delay and mess up several to go orders while we waited for service. I will not return with amount of quality sushi in the area."}
{"text":"If you paid for half my tab - I would still have paid too much. I love sushi. Favorite food out there, without question. Having said that, I am not a sushi snob, in fact I am very open as each sushi restaurant has their own take on sushi based on the various chefs abilities and styles.

Getting back into the review of Koi, I came about this place via restaurant.com. Paid $2 and got a $25 gift certificate. Had to spend $50 between my girlfriend and myself, so that seemed easy enough. 

Upon entering Koi, it seemed like many other Sushi places that I have been. Place was dominated by a large sushi bar that travels the length of the restaurant, with tables lining the wall.

Since we order a lot, we choose the tables. Everything was going good, the rolls were really priced low. 5.50 for your average roll, wow! Sign me up. Also, they have their own take, in which they give each state their own roll. After reading through most of them, a lot looked tempting, but I played it safe, ordered the Kentucky roll (Jalapeno, Cream Cheese, Spicy Tuna). Along with that I placed an order of ebi, a couple spicy tuna's and various tempura rolls (as it seems like for every roll - they have a tempura counterpart).

Spicy Tuna arrived first. Looked down, and instantly noticed that it looks like any other roll I have ever seen, more suitable of a grocery store than a sushi restaurant. Not too much spicy tuna, not too much spice, and the rice was without question stale. If I were to guess, I would have to assume they make a load of spicy tuna rolls each day, and keep them in the fridge until ordered - it had that kind of taste.

Soon after, the rest of the order arrived. Which was fine, except there was literally no distinction between the various tempura rolls. To find out which roll - you had to dig it out underneath a bed of tempura flakes. (I love tempura flakes as much as the next guy, maybe more so, but this was on a whole different level). After identifying the roll, I went about eating it - and that's when it happened. The realization that every roll on my table was covered in eel sauce, EVERY SINGLE ROLL - doused in eel sauce. Others had a spicy mayo with EEL SAUCE, or a Sriracha sauce also WITH EEL SAUCE. I love Sriracha - so much so that I always ask for a side of it to dip some sushi in it instead of/or with my wasabi wash.

Anyway, the eel sauce, on everything, coupled with amorphus poorly made rolls, all with stale rice, made it nearly inedible. I say nearly, because I ate way more than I should have, meaning I had at least one piece from every roll.

Moving onto the Kentucky roll, it was done poorly also. In a nutshell, me and my girlfriend decided it was a jalapeno popper with a tuna Pâté shoved in there. I like jalapeno poppers, but not with tuna Pâté. Since it was by far the most expensive roll I ordered in a while, I tried to stomach another one and went back for a 2nd piece, it tasted the same. It wasn't horrible - but it was not what should have been served. They had a chance to do something with this roll, and they screwed it up, because they cooked with what I assumed was spicy tuna, before they dropped it in the deep frier. Meaning, what arrives at your table is a cooked \"sushi\" roll, with cooked spicy tuna which resembled nothing short of day old cat food (Gray, dry, and not awesome).

I could describe each roll and how bad each one was, but I wont, because nobody will read that much. I will just stop there and say, if there is good sushi at this place, I missed it. Maybe I went on a bad day, but I doubt it. Mainly because as I was sitting there, I was watching the chefs, and damn near every plate that came out was covered in some combination of eel sauce, spicy mayo or sriracha - always eel sauce though.

Both my girlfriend and I decided enough was enough, cut our losses, and asked for a box (not to be a dick) and our check. I would easily say that more food ended up in the box's than our mouths. Which I never do. In fact, I can't remember ever giving up on a meal so thoroughly. In fact, the box's of left over sushi never made it back to my car, as I dumped them in the trash as soon as I left.

Anyway my bill came out to $66 before the $25 restaurant.com discount, that included the gratuity, so I got out of there $41 poorer. However, I did learn my lesson, and that is - when in the Phoenix metro area, do not go anywhere but Sakana sushi, as anything else will always be a disappointment.

On a side note, my girlfriend said that the ebi tasted like ebi, but was quick to point out that it is nearly impossible to screw that up, so maybe sashimi or nigiri is the route to take.

The service was fine, and my Iced Tea tasted like Iced Tea. The atmosphere was fine. So I give it one star, but it's a restaurant, and if the food is that bad, I don't care how good the ancillary aspects are.

Do yourself a favor, and go somewhere else. I am not sick yet, but that doesn't mean you will be as lucky."}
{"text":"Their food is the best sushi I have had in this area. The server was so sweet and a big help when I was ordering my food and the first time I tried sake. I had a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Slow service, pieces are so large, legitimately the size of my palm. Not in a good way either, it was so uncomfortable trying to eat it made for a bad experience. Told there was happy hour pricing over the phone but was charged full price for everything, waste of money."}
{"text":"First time going there, I had good time sitting/eating at the bar. The Chef and server were nice, gave good services. Sushi was great during their happy hour! I would come back again and try other rolls!"}
{"text":"***For anyone looking for Jade and the rest of the old K Sushi staff. They have a new place called Sushi Plus on 59th Ave & Thunderbird. We went tonight and it's everything you remember from the old K Sushi.***"}
{"text":"This place is okay. The only reason I would ever go here is because my boyfriend sometimes wants sushi and it's near his house... I personally don't like it all that much. It's just mediocre sushi. As for the ambiance, I don't mind hole in the wall type spots, but I just don't really like this place, the service is kind of crap as well."}
{"text":"Was looking to try something new last night so cheated on my old favorite Mr. Sushi/Akaihana. 
First thing I learned after reading lots of reviews and settling on this place: their reverse happy hour from 8-10pm is only monday-thursday. The 3-6?happy hour is 7 days a week. Oh well. 
Ok so Service was great with the exception of the Green Mussel special we ordered which I think the sushi chef may have forgotten about because it wasn't until about 5 minutes after we'd finished all our other food that our server yelled at him in Japanese?... and our mussels promptly came out immediately after.
The bf ordered a small Kirin, I ordered a glass of the plum wine ($6).
We ordered 
-a spicy tuna roll ($6), 
- the \"Maryland\" roll ($9.95) which was shrimp tempura and cucumber inside the roll with a spicy crab mixture on top, 
-a california roll, basically, with river eel and eel sauce on top($11.95) which I can't remember the name of (all of their specialty rolls are named after states).
-the Green mussel special ($4.95) which was 4 mussels baked with sweet, spicy, creamy sauce and topped with green onion and masago

All were really good with the exception of the spicy tuna which was only so so.

As other reviewers have said, there is a 15% gratuity added to the check. I think it's a little weird that people get so upset about that... having been a server in my younger years, I almost always tip 20%+. And I always calculate tip based on the after tax amount (bill totals 10 bucks, you leave 2 for tip for a grand total of 12. what's the problem?) But that said, because the service was good, we left more than the base 15%. They also have a sign on the door that says they no longer accept AmEx, fyi.
There were many positives about this experience. Next time I will come during Happy Hour to see what their specials are like."}
{"text":"Wow. Before I decided to cheat on my old lunchtime standby- Japan Express- I read the reviews. None seemed too bad and I was prepared for all the rules ahead of time (not being allowed to go outside for any reason, and tip added).  The shrimp tempura was very tasty. I should have stopped there. They offer rolls named after each state (??) I settled in on the Kansas roll- seemed harmless enough- crab, shrimp..When it was served it was so slimy and pale, I KNEW I shouldn't eat it. I did and boy I will tell you, I had to run to the bathroom straight away! Ruined the rest of my day :-(  The service was charming, I will say that! But cheat on Japan Express?? Never again!!!!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I are sushi junkies. She introduced me to Koi (isn't this how you really spell it?) about a year ago. We loved it the first time we went and because it's near our homes, we figured it would be our go-to-place for sushi and happy hour.

We were wrong. The second time we went, we had brought another girlfriend along. All of a sudden, the sushi went from amazing to bleh. The servers didn't pay attention to anyone in the restaurant, and there's an older lady who appears to be miserable to work there. 

Then, our bill came. I tip generously everywhere I go, so I don't need a restaurant to add an automatic 18% gratuity to my tab. If it was great service, I would understand... but since it's lousy service, why would I tip 18%? That isn't even realistic. 

Honestly, reading this over, I should give them one star."}
{"text":"I eat here at least 3 times/month. I LOVE the sushi and they are quick to place your order. The family is so friendly, to the point of my 2-year old has been calling the lady grandma! HAHA. The food is great and they have great customer service. I HIGHLY recommend. 

The outside looks off putting but the food is DELISH!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service don't bother coming here, & if you do check your bill, I ALWAYS order water & Everytime they charge me for tea, it takes forever to get your bill cause the waitresses are idiots, it's like watching Laurel and Hardy. And the last time they didn't even take it off my bill cause they already changed me!!! We are going somewhere else from now on"}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place their portions are huge. We usually share an entrée and an appetizer and we're completely satisfied. The flavor is fantastic. But most importantly we love our server Eunis she takes the time to get to know you by name and your preferences and is always in a great mood (if she isn't she doesn't show it). We are avid sushi eaters and this is our go to place now."}
{"text":"Still have been coming here about once a month for happy hour.  The boy and I love this place.  Jade is always so funny, Don, one of the chefs always makes us a special roll, which is so generous of him.  We love it.  It's our typical date night location for us, or our friends.  Definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi for the price. Awesome happy hour, but I would only go when it is happier. Full price is very expensive."}
{"text":"Soooooo good!!!!! Best sushi my husband and I have ever had!! The service was great which made it that much better!!!"}
{"text":"The price they charged me was not the prices that were on the menu and they were not going to give me the price on the menu either.

It wasn't until after I was loud and people started looking that they changed my bill. I wonder how much extra money they make by overcharging people. 

The food is not bad but if you go make sure to check your bill. Mine would've been almost eight dollars more than what I had ordered. Not to mention a six piece roll I had gotten in the past came as a four piece roll. 

Major disappointment"}
{"text":"Beat sushi I have ever tasted. $25 all you can eat sushi. Great food and drinks."}
{"text":"This place is good!! Very good service.. Highly recommended! The muso soup is to die for."}
{"text":"This place was ridiculous tonight. Got here at 6:30 and it took 30 minutes to get our drinks but they were wrong.  We ordered 3 rolls and an order of shrimp tempura (4 pc).  The shrimp arrived at 7:30, an hour after we ordered. We finally walked out at 8:00 because we still did not have our rolls.  We have come here many times during the day and everything always went really well and we received our food quickly. 
The only helpful and nice employee was a girl working here first night."}
{"text":"Great service. I've gone a few times and must write a review. We always get the spicy ramen and its sooooo good. Rich spicy flavor and full of noodles and veggies, we add chicken. The rolls are fun and taste amazing. The rolls are much larger portions you can find at other sushi bars."}
{"text":"I've only been here during happy hour so as far as happy hour goes, this place is my favorite sushi bar! The Korean lady and the gentleman behind the sushi bar are hilarious!! She scares me a little but overall it's a great time! The menu is HUGE! How fun is it to pick a roll for every US state?!  The Arizona is super yummy with the perfect amount of spice to it. The portions are more than enough and that happy hour price is unbeatable. Oh my goodness and the spring rolls are delicious too! 

The area is a little sketchy and looks run down but don't let that deter you! You will not be disappointed with the quality and freshness of the food!"}
{"text":"K Sushi is flawless. It is the Beyoncé of sushi. Amazing lunch special and the freshest fish in town."}
{"text":"Soooo good , chicken teriyaki was the best I've probably had ! SUSHI WAS Bomb.com! Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"}
{"text":"Really good sushi the best is Mississippi roll."}
{"text":"I came for lunch on my day off and it was a great experience. The service was kind and speedy. The atmosphere was my favorite part. It was clean and fresh. Earlier this week I went down to Mr. Sushi and it was too crowded and noisy for a relaxing lunch. I liked this setting much better.

I had green tea, which had a nutty flavor to it. The tea was freshly made and served in an individual tea pot.  I also had the spicy salmon with cream cheese roll and a eel and cucumber. Both were delicious.  I liked that I could get a piece of octopus sushi. It was interesting & different.

When my family comes to visit Phoenix, I will be taking them here!"}
{"text":"Literally the best sushi and best spring rolls I have ever had! I'm normally not big on sushi, I have to be in the mood for it, but we went in because my boyfriend wanted ramen and got seated at the bar so it felt like we should order sushi if we we re gonna sit right in front of the chef. Order a few mild rolls, nothing fancy,  but damn were they good. Also got a small order of spring rolls... ugh, I can't express how good they were. Cook perfectly. If nothing else had been good, I will still come back for the spring rolls. Yum."}
{"text":"We used to come love coming here for the all-day happy hour. But it is definitely not the same anymore. The food is still delicious, but unfortunately it takes forever to get it. They are definitely short on wait staff and cooks. The waitresses try to hustle as fast as they can but cannot handle the amount of guests. We ordered appetizers,  6 rolls, a bowl of Ramen, and chicken teriyaki. Everything came out at different times. And our chicken teriyaki was never given to us. Our waitress was very apologetic, and we knew it wasn't her fault. If they don't change things soon, they will be losing a lot of business."}
{"text":"Fantastic service. The Sushi chefs here are hilarious and the food is amazing!! The happy hour pricing is available almost all the time, which has me buying way more than I can eat with my little family. 5 enthusiastic stars for this little gem."}
{"text":"Used to be our goto place for Sushi, as it was a new place that was quite easy to get to. Had good attentive servers, decent prices for the rolls, and overall an enjoyable expierence.
Haven't gone back since the time they suddenly added their own tip.
Wouldn't have bothered me so much until our normal $30 lunch turned into $50.
For Koi sushi we now enjoy the one at Arrowhead. Smaller, but great service and sushi rolls."}
{"text":"Great customer service-delicious vegetarian sushi! Got my food very very fast! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was excellent. Eunice is the hardest working waitress I have ever seen in America! I made sure to let her know she did an awesome job. I sat at the sushi bar and watched her wait on myself and about eight other tables (one of them was a party of 10 people). She seats everyone when you walk in, gets everyone all of their food quickly, drinks, refills and keeps smiles on everyone's faces, then she hustles around and busses all of her tables. I had to give the five stars based on her effort alone. The other two waitresses wandered the dining area at half speed doing I'm not sure what but Eunice definitely has the whole restaurant covered."}
{"text":"Trying to remain a bit positive about this place. I really do think the food is above average. They have such a creative choice with their rolls. And the chef has some serious skills. But the service just sucks! Tonight, I would have had a couple of beers and a few more items had I been able to get anyone to assist me. With the selection of other sushi places in the greater West valley, I see no reason to ever try this place again. And that's a shame."}
{"text":"Gratuity is ALWAYS added, so be careful!

That \"tip\" is what is most important here.  I mean, it's a sushi restaurant in Arizona.  That's about a 6-hour, over-the-speed-limit drive to the nearest ocean.

Oh yeah...one more thing: the all-you-can-eat-sushi limited menu is rice HEAVY.  I wonder why.  :P"}
{"text":"My heart is sad. We used to love coming here but the change of staff/management has definitely helped with the decline of our beloved sushi parlor. I miss old our girls. Food is okay. .. not spectacular like we're used to getting."}
{"text":"We stopped by for a quick bite last Sunday at noon. Service excellent. Great prices. Place was clean, clean, clean. My husband used the restroom and said even it was impeccably clean. Food was delish. I love cold Sake, and they have an excellent assortment. Best I have actually ever seen. Even Sake cocktails. Yum all around. We will DEFINITELY go back."}
{"text":"A friend and I recently went on a busy Friday night. The location leaves a little to be desired, in a shabby strip mall, and from the outside doesn't look promising at all. Once you're inside though, it's all good. Considering how busy it was (no empty seats at the bar, no empty tables) the service was attentive, friendly and reasonably fast. 

As mentioned by the other reviewer, the glossy menu offers pretty much 50 different variations on the same theme. My friend and I had the New York roll (I think would've been better off as the Arizona roll, it was pretty damn spicy), the Alaska roll (the smoked salmon on top was of good quality, better than I was expecting) and split 2 orders of salmon roe nigiri and 1 order of scallop nigiri. For the price, the nigiri orders were a little on the skimpy side but quality was good. The rolls were also a little on the expensive side, but ours were well made, not stingy with the fish at all and quite tasty.

Overall, not a bad little spot. 4 stars as 3 is not doing them justice, but lacked anything special to put them over the top."}
{"text":"Always extremely friendly. I enjoy coming to this location. Happy hour has good prices as well. Very mom and pop feel."}
{"text":"Always delicious! So many different rolls to choose from. Tasty sushi for a great value."}
{"text":"The first time I went here, they had quality sushi, then the rest of the gazillion times I went, they some how only had mediocre sushi. The only reason I keep going back is because they are close by.

The little lady who serves comes off rude but I think it may just have to do with her being foreigner. She told me i used too much SOY sauce one time(Im a freaking paying customer! Ill use all the soy sauce I want lady!)!

They add 18% (or 15%) tip to bill regardless of how little you order or how awful the service was. ew! 

They do have a decent happy hour though!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Jade is the best waitress ever!!  Food is always good!!!   So many good rolls.  Best neighborhood spot around!!"}
{"text":"Koi is decent sushi with a bit of variety, and something I enjoy often.

Just don't go to this location! There's a mandatory gratuity, so the staff loves to be slow, and rude. Good luck on getting your drinks refilled, or even seeing that snappy old lady in a kimono crack a smile!

I cannot emphasize enough that everyone who works here is a ****ing jerk. They seem to get away with it because there aren't really any other sushi bars in the area. I don't care that I have to travel almost ten miles to eat at another Koi, I'm never going to this place again!

And neither should you."}
{"text":"It's hands down the best sushi in Phx. Amazing happy hour, incredible service, and tasty rolls!"}
{"text":"I was taken to Koi and thought it seemed like a nice place.  The food was good, I enjoyed the tempera dinner.  The size of the apps and dinner meal was more than enough for my girlfriend and I.  The sushi list was large but I would not recommend this place if your just looking for sushi.  

Not so sure why all the hate towards Koi, the place seems nice. yet I would not give it a four star review, Nothing was over the top.  

It seems like the people that came here for group outings were not that pleased.  Its a small place that does not seem to get packed maybe this is a good place for a few people or just a couple."}
{"text":"I've never had a bad time at Koi, I don't know why it seems so many other reviewers hated it. Yes they do add a 18% gratuity but I appreciate that cause I don't have to tabulate a tip. I love their sushi, specifically The Minnesota I think it's called. It comes out really hot with yummy spicy mayo and it is to DIE for. There's a older asian lady who works there who is a hoot! She has a great sense of humor, you really must talk to her."}
{"text":"I stopped in on a Saturday night, and sat at the sushi bar.  Very popular place and I see why. Extensive roll menu, with a roll paired to all 50 states, with pictures.  I don't recall the state, however, the fried tempura salmon that came on top of my roll was unique and made the roll.  I also order the crispy fried shrimp that came in some sweet spicy sauce.  Hand dipped and huge.  De-vein and large portion for $15.  

You can't get a better combination of quality and price.  I am glad this restaurant survived.  I have seen it for many years, but this was my first visit.  

Check out their happy hour. I will on my trip to the valley."}
{"text":"I like this place.  The rolls are large and filling.  They also have great happy hour specials."}
{"text":"This place is laughable.  I laughed and one angry sushi chef geve me the dirtiest look.  \"So fresh.  So good.\"  Ha! Ha!

I guess anyone who gives this joint a high rating doesn't really know what sushi is.  Or what quality sushi is.  They have fresh enough fish and they do make it look like sushi and they do fool those who don't know any better.

This is I think what happened to make Koi so bitter and to have such stringent rules:  

1. The neighborhood is poor.  I know, as grew up not far from there and the area has just \"gone down\".  They are close to some cheap crops of condos, apts. and houses that, if aren't occupied by older family homeowners, by younger renters.  Apollo Highschool is nearby, and so my point is, that they are freqented by lower income folks that just don't know what sushi is.  They have never had real sushi.  

2.  Koi must get ripped off a lot.  They get left with ZERO tip from kids or maybe by someone who DOES know what sushi is and realizes that they have just stepped in to what has to be the poorest, most stingy excuse for sushi that was ever served to them.

3.  Sushi is expensive and that is just a fact.  Places can't offer cheap sushi and this place is trying to fool customers into thinking that it exists.  It's not cost effective for them to buy sushi grade fish and then to try to sell it at a discount.  They'd lose money.  People probably leave without paying their bill/tipping.  They fill up on the \"all you can eat\" and then leave for feel like they've been had so they leave with little or no tip.  That is sad, as we tip 15% no matter how we've been treated.  Husband and I went about a year ago and each ordered the $30 all you can eat.\"  Right away they tell you all of the rules or you read them on the menu or find out in the middle of the meal.  The kinds of sushi is limited.  Only 2 orders of nigiri so that you can't have all of the sashami that you like.  That was my first thought.  Hey, $30 for a bunch of sashimi.  NO WAY.  Others must have tried that.  Customers may NOT take the fish off of the rice!  If they find rice, they told me that they will charge separately for nigiri.  Jeesh!

4.  Okay, so they are all about the RICE.  Rice is cheap right?  Now, they have thought of a way to make some money, even if people are disappointed.  But then again, they won't know any better will they?  Seriously, the slices of nigiri were almost paper thin.  Not quite, but almost.  Thesushi  rolls, constisted of a pencil sized piece of fish (again, fresh enough) surrounded by a one of those mini powdered donought sized amount of rice and seaweed wrapping.  Really, THAT much rice.

Somehow around 3:30, we forgot how awful Koi had been when we were trying to go for happy hour yesterday and Mr. Sushi (Akaiahana - similar neighboorhood - not exaclty quality but better than nothing in this area - but Mr. Sushi is another story,,,) was closed until 4:00.  We were hungry/short on time and didn't want to drive far so we decided to give Koi another try. 

We sat at the sushi bar.  Smelled like moldly floor mat.  Waited for about 5 minutes to be asked for drink orders. and they weren't busy.  Strange weak iced tea came.  Only hot sake available.  Ilk!  This is a rotten part too - Both soy sauces were watered down!  That was just ridiculous.  I wasn't surprised that they tried it with the light, but even the regular was WATERED DOWN!  They get away with this for those who don't know what soy is supposed to taste like.  How cheap can they get?  

I poked my spicy yellowtail and spicy white tuna out of my \"rice ball\" rolls (I was allowed this time as we paid regular price, not all you can eat).  Peeled my salmon and white tuna off my my giant clobs of rice.  We ate the shrimp tempura and spring rolls.  Not too bad.  Small long shrimp with LOTS of tempura.  The sauces weren't horrid.  Just \"from the bottle\" and watered down again.  Nothing special.

Got a strange tea refill that wasn't what we'd originally ordered. 

BIll was about $30.  At that time, I didn't look closely to find that I may have been charged gratuity already (I'd forgotten about that from last time and until I visited Yelp), so I tipped 20%.  Maybe the included grat. is for all you can eat.  If I tipped 30-40% without realizing it for this cheap meal, I'm going to cry!

So when the server came to clean plates up, she noticed, Oh, you do not like the rice?  I just responded, not THAT much rice. Kind of funny. Besides the dirty look, the service was just a little bad.

Anyway, I thought it'd be interesting to some of you to understand WHY I think Koi are the way they are.  They've been wronged.  I'm not sticking up for them.  I think they suck and they should be cool to get treated  cool.  Just because others screw them they shouldn't punish everyone!

CHEAP!  Not normal sushi.  Stingy.  Not friednly.  Not cool!  Save your money.  Travel a bit if your'e in this area!  Nothing good around here:("}
{"text":"We've been eating in almost every sushi place around Glendale , K- sushi is our favorite place at this time, eating there once or twice a month. I brought my mom from Russia about 2 years ago she never had sushi before, we took her to K - sushi first, she loved it, tried a few other onece ( by ocasions  ) she never liked it anywhere els. Me and my daughter , we both have gluten allergies and waitresses always paying attantions to requests. I love this place. Food is very good, best plum vine in the area, funny sarcastic lady who usually serve out table is the best one."}
{"text":"They have lots of different rolls (50 states worth and more!) All innovative, large, and delicious. I enjoyed all 3 rolls that I ordered. I even loved the all the other rolls that I taste tested off of the rest of my party's rolls too! The price is pretty average for sushi: about $10-13 a roll. But I think its worth it because of the taste and size of the rolls. 

However, the service was so disorganized and a little rude that left me with a so-so impression. I understand the \"blunt old asian lady\" stereotype, but its in full effect here. It also took my table over an 30 minutes to get our check and it was incorrect. Plus, AFTER we just paid and stayed at the table to talk a little more, the servers asked us to pay for a check we already paid for. 

I want to come back for the food, but I don't want to go through the same service experience again. 

Environment: 4/5
Food: 4/5
Price: 3/5
Service: 1.5/5"}
{"text":"The Mississippi Roll. DO IT. So delicious.

The fish wasn't the freshest, but all in all this is a nice little Sushi joint that has a good happy hour. Friendly waitstaff.

I got sick the night I ate here, but I'm pretty sure it's because one of the rolls had avocado (I'm allergic), and I wanted to try the roll so I just took it out. There must have still been a sliver of avocado in the roll...oops!

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"~  Winner of the \"Worst\" dining experience ever goes to.... K Sushi Bar & Grill.  An excruciating two and a half hour $hit $how.   Years from now we may look back and laugh at this fiasco, but for now heres some friendly advice, don't waste your precious time or money."}
{"text":"Saw this place on my way to Camelback Ranch Stadium, and i made me grin, i love sushi, and i love to grub!

After the game,my friend and i stopped in and once we walked it, you are greeted, not sure what they say(maybe hey, you eat then get he hell out) or welcome, i say welcome.. Service was great, they explained how the All You Can Eat Menu works, or you can choose a regular meal, I told myself, Self !, you like sushi, save a buck while eating please, so my friend and i choose the AYCE and enjoyed all three rounds, i say rounds cause you have three times to eat, so choose wisely and eat everything on your plate as you were told!

The have a huge sushi bar or you can pick a side seat, the fish was good,fresh, and i never waited longer then 5 minutes for my orders to arrive, i was impressed by their service.

They have a menu on the table, its 50 states(choices really) of rolls, pretty cool, just make sure you read the small print, cause what you might think is this type of roll,they have somewhat renamed it.

Will return once i am in Phoenix area again, oh and they have a room/bar that seems really cool, not big or small, just right, will try it next time i am in town.

Try it for yourself, and i hope you enjoy a nice meal for yourself.

Takecare"}
{"text":"I am sitting at Koi at the moment and wanted to make sure not to forget to review it so that no one is ever fooled into thinking that this restaurant offers quality sushi.  I'm having real trouble placing my finger on the exact problem but this sushi is WRONG.  I feel as if I may become ill were I to finish it.  I ordered a spider roll and the crab was clearly deep fried in old oil and then stuffed inside stale rice and served to yours truly.  I stopped at this restaurant because it was between two appointments that I had scheduled.  This was a mistake!!
On the other hand I feel that I must mention that the staff was very friendly and expedient, unlike the service that was apparently experienced by some other yelpers.
So, if you want fast, friendly, BAD sushi, Koi is for you. (Not me)"}
{"text":"Read some reviews and went with my brother to try it out. The atmosphere was a little bright and a little dated. But our host was very sweet. I wish they had all you can eat. The menu had a lot of variety, probably too much which probably explained why it was a little slow. They also seemed to be understaffed which resulted in people waiting at the door then leaving. If you are patient and understanding this is a good place."}
{"text":"Before this place i was afraid of eating sushi, just the thought of raw seafood wrapped in seaweed disgusted me.  Then my friend showed me this place and demanded i give it a try.  I was blown away, and now im a fan of sushi thanks to this restaurant.  The quality and variety of sushi from this place is hard to match and their other entrees are excellent as well. If you or you know someone that is skeptical about eating sushi, take them here, they will change their mind about it.  Totally exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the first time. I got the Shrimp Tempura Roll, the Las Vegas Roll and the Salmon Sashimi. It cost around $29.00 which for the quality, I thought was a bit pricey. The sashimi was good but the rolls were not. The rice was very thick and gummy and lacked flavor. Each roll was covered heavily in sauce which I feel takes away from the great taste a roll can have. I only ate about 2 pieces from each roll because I just couldn't get past the texture of the rice. Service was great though. The staff was very friendly and I was greated right away. There was only one other couple in the whole place and this was around 5:30 pm so I would have thought there would be more customers. Even though they offer happy hour from open to close Monday through Thursday I don't think I will be returning any time soon."}
{"text":"Fresh fish, cool chefs, and happy hour with an unbeatable price. Can't get any better"}
{"text":"This place is a few blocks from our house.  We don't come often but it is always good.  

Although they get you on the happy hour..sushi for $1 really means one piece of sushi for $1.  Not really worth it.  You are better off getting the 2 rolls for $8.95 or something like that.

They automatically add gratutity to their bill.  How can you fight it?  I mean, sometimes they are worth 15% tip, but most of the time they are not.  This place is a hit or miss."}
{"text":"Looking for a new place to get sushi & made the drive to try K Sushi. Everyone is super friendly & the atmosphere is very relaxed from the second you walk in. Tried the shrimp tempura, California rolls, chicken teriyaki rolls, and the Maine rolls. All were so good and we're already planning on coming back! Awesome experience from presentation to the food itself."}
{"text":"Visited Koi for the AYCE special to celebrate a friend's bday. The menu is extensive, but the rolls are all more or less the same. The items came out slowly, sometimes with too much rice packed on so I wadded up some of it in my napkins. I felt guilty for wasting, but I didn't want to get charged for leftovers on my plate.

It's kind of tacky how they ask for proof when celebrating a bday, but I guess it's necessary to weed out the fakers. My friend got a free dessert and they gave us some wigs & boas to wear for our Polaroid picture that they posted on the wall. 

I wouldn't return since it wasn't that great of a deal and the food was mediocre. I could go to a real sushi restaurant and pay $30/person to get higher quality sushi."}
{"text":"This sushi joint in West Glendale was a complete roll of the dice and we went in with low expectations and serious hunger.  Coming out, we were stuffed and pleasantly surprised.  If there is such a decor as a sushi dive bar, this place would be it.  Nothing fancy and a woman who we assumed was the owner was not afraid to call my friend out for ordering a Corona in a Japanese restaurant.  She even mocked him for ordering a small one.  Gotta love it when a restaurant challenges your order!

Was the fish the freshest?  Well, we are in the desert, so I'm not holding my breath.  But everything tasted good and the chef even made us one of their daily special rolls on the house.  If you are in the area, I would give them a shot.  And make sure you order a Sapporo!"}
{"text":"This is the best sushi and the best price!!! If you want really good sushi forget the major chains and Scottsdale scene and take the drive and I promise you will be very pleasantly surprised!!!

Tonight we ordered my favorite their spin on the calamari as well as the Arizona roll, a salmon tempura roll and the amazing spicy tuna tempura roll!!

In heaven and didn't break the bank for our little Tuesday date night!"}
{"text":"Did the change hands?? Had been there several times, but last visit was blah city. The calamari tempura was a store bought and breaded generic. Veggie tempura was thick cut and not cooked completely. Hawaii roll had thick cut chunks of cucumber and minimal tuna and avocado on top. Disappointing after having had good experience there before."}
{"text":"The first time I went here the food was great but the service sucked. I had to hunt our server down only to find her hiding behind a register on her phone. She then took forever to return with my card. 

This time I couldn't tell you if the food was still good, we sat there for a good 20 minutes and weren't even acknowledged or told they were busy. We eventually left and went to takamatsu down the street."}
{"text":"ALL DAY Happy hour Monday thru Thursday. Unbelievable! Friday- Sunday, their HH runs from 3-6. Very friendly service, the servers are pleasant and always smiling. 
I ordered 2 rolls (raw, as I'm not a fan of fried or cooked rolls), an order of spring rolls (6 mini rolls) and a Kirin Light sake bomb- $17!!! Delicious Bargain!! My only negative feedback would be that the dipping sauce for the spring rolls was really salty. It made me squint and ask for water. Otherwise the sushi itself was fresh and delish, service was nice. I tend to be a location snob, but places like this are changing my ways; I've learned that location isn't always everything. Some of the best hidden food wonders I've found are in divey strip mall locations.
I'll definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"4 fresh, delicious rolls, 1 sake bomb, 1 tea for S31.00 on happy hr today. this place should be full all the time."}
