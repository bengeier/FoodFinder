{"text":"I have had a couple of good meals here but tonight's experience left a sour impression. After walking up to the counter at 9:25 pm (they close at 10 pm on Saturdays), I was informed that they had already turned off the grill (????) and thus would not make any beef kebabs, chicken kebabs, grilled chicken thighs, etc. That is, they basically would not make the best things on their menu even though there was still 35 min until close. I was further informed that they were out of rice, which is a huge component of all their plates.   I mean, if I had arrived 2 minutes before close, this would be understandable, but there was still over half an hour left! None of the (few) available remaining items sounded good to me, so I left without getting anything. A wasted 25 minute drive there and back.  The only reason I didn't give 1 star is that I know that this place makes very good food. That being said, the situation tonight was truly disappointing."}
{"text":"The best gyros I've had in a long while, the meat is crisp and juicy, greens are fresh and their tzatziki sauce is really nicely seasoned, super yummy.  The bread is doughy and tasty as well, and they make a nice baklava too. Super friendly service, convenient location, tucked inconspicuously near the AZ Humane Society Thrift Store in the Fiesta Mall district. Plenty of room for wheelchairs/powerchairs. Definitely coming back and soon!"}
{"text":"Not impressed with their food at all. I had the chicken schwerma which was super dry, chewy, and chopped up into little bits. It came with a poor serving side salad which was mostly tomatoes. Their garlic paste/sauce had too much garlic, to the point it was overwhelming to smell much less eat. My boyfriend had a chicken alsham rack that was $10 which contained more dry chicken and some pickles. Needless to say, it wasn't worth the price. It was my first time here and sadly my last time. Pita Jungle is way better! At least Pita Jungle makes their own pitas, this place certainly does not."}
{"text":"Friendly, clean and delicious. Meals are large and come with a baklava for dessert, who could want more? Been several times and each visit doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Poor customer service! Walked in at 7:55pm on a Sunday to grab a quick bite to go, and was told that I would not be served because they're closed. Sign on the door says they close at 8, and there were other people sitting down eating inside the restaurant. I won't waste my time returning. Unfortunate because I love Mediterranean cuisine and they're right down the street."}
{"text":"Hands down, this is the BEST Mediterranean Restaurant I have ever eaten at. Everything is fresh, and very well made. The service is outstanding. I have seriously become addicted to Green Corner!"}
{"text":"Ordered the falafel plate, hummus, and chicken shawarma... everything was delicious. Quick and friendly service as well. They even gave us a couple of pieces of baklava on the house! Sure wish we lived closer to this place.... no doubt we'd be regulars."}
{"text":"As good as it gets?  You bet!  This is the best mediterranean food I have had here.  In fact it was about the best meal we have had in years.  It is not fancy, it is ethnic but everything is super.  Even the salad was made with care - very fresh romaine, light dressing, real Kalamata olives.  I had the gyros plate.  They let me sub Baba ganoosh for the rice (I figured with pitas I did not need another starch - until I tasted my wife's rice, so good)  This rice is not the run of the mill yellow rice you usually get.  It is distinctly flavored with spices (some what like garam masala).  Gyros was of great quality, loaded with flavor and very tender.  A lot of it too.  Portions are very large.  Hummus was great too, lots of flavor.  My wife had the chicken shwarma which I do not usually like - I really liked this.  Like the rest of the food, it is richly flavored and a very large portion. It is made in the traditional way on a vertical spit - you can see it.  The top 10 reasons to go here  1 - great food 2 - large portions of great food. 3 - great service.  They are always helpful and extremely pleasant. They clearly care about how you are doing. 4- nice ambiance - no, not fancy, but restful and quiet, with comfortable seating  5- great hours (open from late morning until late in the evening) 6 - easy and plentiful parking (it is in the strip mall on the north-east corner of Southern and Alma School - near the center) 7 - They just might give you free baklava - I noticed several people commented on this and they did give some to us.  It is great - strong fresh walnut flavor, flaky pastry and a modest amount of honey - not overwhelming as it often is. So tip generously.  8 - clean, and they clear the tables quickly.  9 - an excellent value ($27 for two plates with drink - it is dinner) 10 -go there - we want this place to stay open a long time because we plan on going often!  Now it is my wife's turn - I had a lot to say until he pinched all my ideas!  On the other hand, he's real picky about his mediterranean/middle eastern food, so the above is actually about a 10-star review.  As for me, I have a lot of food sensitivities, and they were cheerfully willing to accommodate them in every way possible.  The result:  I ate each bite I could squeeze in, and pita-d the plate clean!  And brought home enough for another whole dinner!  What a wonderful change from \"Yeah - sorry - pretty much everything has pepper in it.  Except for the desserts.\"    So, outstanding food, value, service, and experience!  Please help them stay in business - you won't regret it a bit!"}
{"text":"I gave it a second chance, but for me, between it, Haji Baba, Princess Market...Green Corner is a distant third.  My first attempt was to order and pick up. It takes about 20 minutes or so to get there. That's at the upper end of how long I want to drive for take out. I arrived a few minutes after they said it would be ready. When I got there, they told me it would be another 15 minutes. I didn't really want to wait and I didn't want the food that was already done to sit there, then sit on the way home. They said I could have it for free. But I just passed.   Tonight we gave them a second try. This time we ate at the restaurant. The workers were very nice and gave us free baklava since it was our first time.  But the food was light on meat, heavy on rice and lettuce. The rice tasted great at least. The meats were dry. I also tried a gyro sandwich. The gyro meat was also dry, but also crunchy because it was burnt. I asked if that was intentional. She said it was, that they cut it into little pieces so it cooks faster and sometimes that makes it crispy. Maybe I'm confused about how gyro meat is made, because I didn't understand that at all. But ok, maybe people like crunchy burnt gyro meat. Just doesn't happen to be my taste.   But still confused I asked another employee. He said that he would ask. He came back a few minutes later with a mound of gyro meat (and another mound of rice). This meat was pretty good...but it wasn't IN a gyro sandwich. I told him I didn't want it. He said he'd get a box for us to take it home. Then went away and didn't actually bring back a box.   The food took a long time to get to us, the bread was dry, the meat was dry and/or burnt.   Rice was great, baklava was good. Stuffed grape leaves were mushy and fell apart. Employees were very nice or at least tried to be."}
{"text":"Excellent food, I tried the falafel and beef shawerma and truly one of the best I've ever tried"}
{"text":"My husband and I were very hungry by the time we got to the restaurant. Unfortunately, there was some sort of glitch and after 20 minutes our food still hadn't arrived. We both ordered shawarma; one chicken and one beef. After a while an employee noticed we were waiting for food and our order was rushed. The rice and hummus were tasty, but my beef shawarma was quite bland. My husband's was fine. After a few minutes with our dishes, the manager came over to apologize for the initial delay. He also asked how our food was. I shared that my shawarma was unseasoned (and visibly so) and the manager immediately got me a menu to try something else. A few minutes later I had a delicious dish of tender, juicy lamb kafta kebabs. He also brought over a couple of pieces of baklava for us to enjoy. Even the best restaurants can have an off day. For me the most important thing is that a mistake be acknowledged and rectified, and this manager did a great job of doing both."}
{"text":"We are here last night. What a great meal. Best I ever had. Lamb kabob came with 3 optional sides. We chose tabouli, hummus and baba ganoush. All the food is made from scratch on site by the staff who served you. Real treat."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Best Mediterranean food I have ever had! Service and staff were above average! Delicious! My new spot!"}
{"text":"The food and service was exceptional!  Best hummus I've had.  Good quality ingredients."}
{"text":"If they had more than 5 stars to give I would give it  Food is awesome and you get a ton of it. I had the beef Sharma meal and i highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Super impressed! I don't usually believe a five star restaurant review but this place earns every one. Friendly service, great food, good prices, and large portions. It's definitely one of the best places I've eaten in the East valley."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean Greek food had the combo plate and everything was delicious. Would have fed 3 adults. Portions are huge! It is in a empty strip mall but very clean and easy to order menu. Give this place a try."}
{"text":"I have never eaten at a Greek restaurant before this restaurant is fantastic. The portions are generous and the staff and management went out their way including samples of some of the entr√©es. Best baclava in Phoenix! Price very reasonable"}
{"text":"I love when the service and friendliness of the staff is as good as the food. I wish I lived here as I would visit often, but I'm an out of towner. The amount of food for the price is outstanding. My vegetarian plate with falafel, hummus, tabouleh and baba ganoush was delicious. We also had some of the homemade baklava, you can't beat homemade baklava! Real authentic food, homemade! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"We chose this restaurant because of the other reviews. We were not disappointed. The service is amazing. The guy running the place was on point. He was very friendly. My husband ordered the GC plate combo. As we were being served, he let us know that one of the kababs was burned out of the 3 served. He replaced it shortly after with 2 kababs. My husband said the flavors were amazing. I had the chicken shawarma plate (includes fresh salad, rice, and hummus), and everything was delicious!! They also gave us dessert... deliciously FREE baklava. Good price, healthy tasty food, and amazing service...We Couldn't recommend this place more! We will come back the next time we fly into PHX."}
{"text":"I can't praise this place highly enough.  My standards for Mediterranean food are very high, and Green Corner Restaurant met and surpassed them.  Oh. Em. Gee. The food is amazing.  For such a humble-looking little place, and the low prices, you wouldn't necessarily expect a lot, but the food quality is simply astonishing.  There were a few of us in our group last night, and we each ordered different things.  I tried a little of everything, and NOTHING was even slightly disappointing.    I usually judge a Mediterranean food place by its falafel, since it's really hard to get that right.  Wow.  Green Corner knocked it out of the park.  Crispy on the outside, soft and crumbly on the inside, tasty but not too spicy...  This is a good sign.  And like I said, everything else was fantastic as well.  We will definitely be going back, and I'm telling all my friends.  I'm not usually one to be effusive about a restaurant, but this place is a gem."}
{"text":"I suppose 5 stars is getting boring by now, but there's nothing higher to select. The food alone deserves it. But the friendly people and excellent service are also wonderful. This is a very casual atmosphere with 5-star food! Have you been on Check Please yet? If I were an interior designer, I would offer my services for free. I would do something with the walls to paint some greenery on them or put hanging plants around the room. Then cover the tables with lovely green and white print table cloths with glass covers for that touch of class that this restaurant deserves! But what do I know? The patio is lovely and the sun screens were a great idea for this intense Arizona sun. I would love to see this restaurant succeed in a big way! Dinner was superb this evening! Best to you from a totally unknown fan!"}
{"text":"Fantastic lunch spot! The plate portions are huge and the salad (included) is fresh. The salad is made with real greens and it's loaded with large pieces of cucumber, tomato and bell pepper. The humus and baba ganoush are delicious as well. Try the kifta, you won't be disappointed. If you're lucky, they might drop off a free slice of the baklava for dessert.  I have taken both white collar and blue collar associates here and everyone loves it.  Try it!"}
{"text":"Attentive service and delicious food with large portions! We came in on New Year's day and were offered complimentary baklava. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and super nice staff. We tried the beef and chicken shawarma and the gyros and they were all fantastic. The Greek fries are to die for!"}
{"text":"Beautiful food collection so dalicious so clean Best customer service  This restaurant is my favorite"}
{"text":"Tonight we tried this restaurant because of the reviews and the fact that we love Mediterranean cuisine. We figured it was good as we followed several Mesa Police into the restaurant.  Police officers always seem to know where great food is. Also the place was packed with all ethic groups represented. The staff was kind, attentive and gave us Baclava for free because it was our first time eating here.  I had the Giro plate which was delicious and lots of food and my husband had the chicken wings plate with tabouli salad.  Tonight was our first time here but will not be our last."}
{"text":"A really nice find. A little place in a strip mall. We walked in and were greeted right away. We explained that we had never been there and the young lady explained the menu to us. She was very pleasant and helpful. I had the gyro plate. It was very good. Lamb, fries, and some fresh salad with pita bread. Very tasty. My wife had the Greek salad with chicken. It was large enough that she shared some with me. while we were eating, the young lady who greeted us came over to the table and gave us two pieces of baklava. They were very fresh and delicious. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"I live down the street from this place, yasss. I ordered a Greek salad and hummus plate. Everything is extremely fresh and was presented so well in my to go containers."}
{"text":"Came here because of the Yelpers!  We had chicken souvlaki platter with rice and extra rice because I hate peas and the other options lol.  This was sooo delicious and the service is excellant!  What a nice crew of people!  Also, at the end of dinner we were presented with two pieces of Baklavi that was scrumptious!!  We will definitely be back!  Thank you!!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mediterranean food I have EVER eaten. Short wait times, clean, friendly staff. I will come back to eat here again. Go for the Green Corner Combo its like $14 and so worth it!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and the food was very good I don't live in AZ, but if I did I would be a regular  The girls working there are super nice and helped decide what was ok to eat since I have dietary  restrictions"}
{"text":"Dinner.  I would have never known this was here if it was not for Yelp and the 5 star reviews I would have never tried it. We have been doing our Mediterranean run for a few weeks now and for my first visit to Green Corner, A+.  I walked in thinking I would go basic with a chicken kabob but when I saw the stack of steak and found our it was rib eye and that is their choice of meat for the beef kabobs I quickly changed my mind and glad I did! First and foremost the steak was not over cooked. Everything had great flavor rice, salad, the hummus.  I can truly say this was the best beef kebab I have had so far and I will be back.  Minus the baba ghanouj it was burnt. But overall it was great very friendly staff and it was very clean even though I flung half of my plate of rice onto the floor while I was taking the meat off the stick.   Great find."}
{"text":"The food is so delicious, the hummus and fatoush are every time favorite. The staff is friendly as well. And it is cheap compared to other middle-eastern restaurants."}
{"text":"First time I ate here was a few months back, and it was decent, but not 5 stars.  Ordered tonight and was very surprised to see the high reviews (seemed inflated).  Tonight we spent $35 on a gyro, gyro plate, and the chicken shawerma.  Gyro was the only edible thing.  Gyro plate sucks, soggy salad in same container as hot meat, and little sauce to cover up the dry pita..  Chicken shawerma was also supper dry, and unedible so we just threw it away. How would I describe ther Baba ghannouge? Well it' in the trash. I love eggplant, and love bab ghannouge.  It was super skunky and tasted rotten.  Only thing we ate was the gyro (can't go wrong with these) and the french fries were good too.  Stay away from their entree's.  Service felt like I was rushed as soon as I stepped in the door and I called in take out.  Much better Greek in East Valley."}
{"text":"Saw the great reviews on yelp and decided to give this place a shot. Not disappointed. We had 4 people and spent 50 bucks on dinner and drinks. I ordered the kabob combo and it was excellent. Hummus was amazing...the salad was very tasty and main course and rice-all excellent.  Was crowded, but they had a buffet going on which was clearly drawing in the crowds. My bf got the buffet and he was very pleased. All around-thumbs up. Very casual."}
{"text":"I completely missed the Pokemon gym, however!...I went in to try out their Greek Salad.  Talk about rustic awesomeness!!!  Giant pieces of fresh tomato, fresh green pepper and cucumber and fresh lettuce.  The dressing is spot on as well, tangy and everything you'd want from a Greek Salad.  I was ecstatic to see the size of the salad for the $5.99 price.  In the area, it's a steal!    Only downside, I thought the tomatoes could have had more flavor....darn you Green Corner!!! Take it up with the gods!!!    Given that minor disappointment, the unsolicited baklava (which, might I add doesn't count to today's calories...because I did not order it)  was like heaven.  Perfectly buttery, light and nutty....so good.  I'm glad it was a small piece, I would have eaten the whole sheet!      Bonus plan, part two....there's enough for tomorrow's lunch as well!  Woohoo!"}
{"text":"We came to the green corner for a business lunch and the food was delicious. However it did take a long time to get to our table so I wouldn't recommend it if you are in a hurry"}
{"text":"Boom! Outstanding lunch. Ya gotta try the Falafel and the salad!  Oops, I forgot; the baklava too.  Will definitely be back. Thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"From walking up to the building you could just smell the food and immediately i began to salivate. Opening the door then increased said salivation. I ordered a gyro plate and everything was more than expected. Food came out quickly, tasted great, and the service was awesome! The portions were rather large as well, definitely a good bang for you buck.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"We found the Green Corner to be delicious!  We four each ordered a meal, which we didn't need to do because one meal would have fed both children easily.  The portions were large, and the food was delicious.  What I ordered takes a bit of time to prepare and the young lady at the counter was quick to let me know.    We look forward to going back to try some different menu items.    (I will say that I see another review mentioning 'complimentary baklava' and we were not offered/provided any baklava.  I'm not sure we could have eaten it if we had - we were stuffed after the meal.)"}
{"text":"I'll keep this simple... The food is amazing! My favorite is the Beef Shawarma. Another important thing is that it is consistent. High quality meat and fresh vegetables. And the prices are low for what you get. And lastly, the staff is super friendly and accommodating. I haven't one negative thing to say about this place and that is rare. I drive from ahwatukee often to eat there... and I always bring new friends and family so that they can enjoy this great establishment."}
{"text":"This place is legit! My husband and I both got the gyro plates to go and when I got home I was surprised at the amount of food for such a reasonable price. Best gyros I've had anywhere. They also threw in some free baklava because I said I had never tried it before! I'll definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST chicken shawarma plate I've ever had.  Staff is friendly and service is quick.  I would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Best little gem for healthy and authentic middle eastern food! Fast, friendly service and clean too!"}
{"text":"You know you've found authentic when only three tables in the place we're speaking English! Amazing flavors, thoughtful, attentive staff. The Tabouli the best I've had in the states! And the baba...smoky and YUM! Falafel flavorful and not overdone as most places"}
{"text":"I love this place.  Quick healthy meals.  Really great staff.  Generous helpings and reasonably priced.  The free desert was an unexpected treat.  Best hummus around!  Love the vegetarian plate."}
{"text":"We have visited this restaurant several times... everything is outstanding!! Chops, falafel, rice, etc. No way to go wrong with the menu. Service is also nice. Free dessert."}
{"text":"Decided to check them out for Father's Day lunch, since my dad loves Mediterranean food. Great portion sizes and combinations (for example, you can get combo items here that include hummus and tabbouleh, which isn't necessarily the norm at Middle Eastern /  Mediterranean restaurants). Our family of four got plenty of pita bread to share with our combos, the dishes were flavorful, and, like a few of the other reviews mentioned, they even came by and gave us a few slices of baklava on the house. Not sure if they only do that for groups, or for certain occasions, but it was a very simple gesture that left a great impression. My dad, who loves great deals as much as he loves great food, was so happy with all of this that he went up to the counter after the meal and waited for someone to walk by so he could tell them that \"everything was great!\" We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Honestly probably one of the best experiences I've had in a long time. Kind, generous and attentive.  That's just the service.   The food, put ever other mediterranean restaurant a few pegs down.  The plates are huge and everything has amazing flavor.    Will be back several times!!  Wish more places like this where around!!!"}
{"text":"Got the Greek salad and stuffed grape leaves. So delicious and fresh. Then got delicious dessert. Best random lunch drop in. Definitely will come back. Veggies were very crisp."}
{"text":"Wow. Fantastic food, perfect falafel, hummus.  You may want to share a plate, really good portion size."}
{"text":"I would like to give it four stars but the atmosphere is just blah. The food is very good, the employees very nice, I enjoyed my meal and I would go back again but I wouldn't go out of my way to do it. If you're in the area give it a shot. The flavors are authentic but the room itself takes away from it."}
{"text":"Second visit. We ordered the chicken shawarma plate and the chicken kabob plate.  The flavors are so good.  Everything is fresh.  They make it to order, so it took about 15 minutes, but well worth the wait. The first time we went, the pita bread was just ok.  Today, the bread had been grilled, and the edges were crispy.  What a difference!   We loved it.  The portions are very large, and we took about half the food home. The same guy took our order both times we've visited, and he is incredibly polite.  Just very likable. This time, they brought us baklava at the end of our meal.  We didn't order it, so I think they might have added this as a nice touch at the end of dine-in meals.  The restaurant is very clean, but the ambience is a bit stark.  Maybe some plants or those strings of lights with the large bulbs, or something else (?) would make it more inviting. That aside, the food is wonderful.  :)"}
{"text":"How did I not find this place sooner?   Amazing!   Casual little place with awesome food.  Big portions and so flavorful.   Definitely one to visit."}
{"text":"Best food u can find in mesa and its good for you. Friendly staff. Fair price. I eat here at least twice a week."}
{"text":"The gyros plate was delicious and came in a large plate and wasn't even able to finish it. Good value and quality, definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and delicious. Chicken kabob took 10 mins but it was worth waiting for fresh and moist chicken. Staff was friendly and delightful. Looking forward to second location in Chandler which will be more convenient."}
{"text":"Great tasting food and nice staff. Plan about 15 min for their kabob meat because they grill each order fresh. My husband and I now enjoy eating here about every week. The baklava they bring out for dessert is a nice treat too."}
{"text":"Great food, I don't know if it's possible to beat the food quality for the price of this. It's a good value and the taste and overall quality is great. It seemed like care went into making it.  There are healthy options on the menu. The plates come with a meat + 3 sides. The default combo plate is meat + 1 side of salad + 1 side of hummus, + 1 side of rice.  It's nice that you can mix up the sides how you like.  I went for 2 salad sides and 1 hummus. I don't normally enjoy greek salad much, but I wanted to eat healthier so I made this decision. Turns out, the greek salad was actually delicious, as was everything on the menu.  That's saying something, because I tried a lot of food here.  I was with a group of 6 and we ordered a variety. Everyone loved it.  We also receive an unexpected complimentary walnut dessert pastry from the owner/manager at the end. This too was very good.  The owner/manager (not sure he was actually just the manager or both) was friendly and hospitable. He checked in on us to see how we were doing a couple times and also came over to clear our table at the end, even though this is typically a place where you order at the counter and bus your own table. I suspect/hope that there will come a time when he's too busy to give this type of personal attention, but it's great that he does this while having some downtime.  If you're in the area and looking for a quality meal, Green Corner is a solid choice."}
{"text":"200+ reviews and a 5star rating?   Had to try this place.  While 5 stars might be a little too high it was really good.  Great friendly service.  Free baklava at end of the meal was a nice touch.  Had the chicken shawarma plate.  Good chicken.  Great hummus.  Too much rice and not enough salad(That might be my only complaint).  Wife had the gyro plate, Chicago style.  Good gyro meat and great fries.  Lots of cucumbers, onions, and tomatoes.  The gyro plate came with warm and slightly toasted pita while the rest of our plates came with non-toasted pita, I ate my wife's toasted pita, much better."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great service and supper clean location. Will definitely recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Best Greek food in town. Everything on the combo plate was amazing.  Service was pleasant. This place is authentic.  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"From the lady at the cashier who is suuper sweet and friendly, to the uber delicious food, to the clean sunny interiors...love it! My bf had the mixed schwarma plate and I had the gyro plate - both amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't know healthy eating could be such a treat for the taste buds! Ordered the chicken kabob plate and lentil soup. This was Mediterranean food at its finest! The plate came with greek salad, hummus, pita bread and tabouleh. The ingredients used were undeniably fresh and the preparation was richly flavorful. Reminded me of mom's home cooked meals using kitchen garden produce!"}
{"text":"Great location, big portions. Great value and service. Very attentive. Nice to have a Mediterranean restaurant in the area. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Go at least 2x a week Great prices. Great portions.  And the baklava is really good"}
{"text":"I really love this place! The food is crazy good and they ain't stingy with it! If you go here you will get great food from friendly people and the place is clean...what more can you ask for???"}
{"text":"Well, I don't  know how many restaurants average 5 stars but I am pretty sure they are  very few. Mediterranean food great. The service is key and I am quite sure this is the reason for so many Positive  compliments!!! Counter service but with a genuineness that translates all the way to the table"}
{"text":"I absolutely love the food.  The best falafel and baklava I have ever had.  My co-workers and I have gotten lunch there a few times, and everything is great.  The portions for the meals are generous."}
{"text":"I don't like writing negative reviews but the gyro sandwich I had yesterday was one of the worst I've ever had.  It tasted like ground beef and the texture was very crumbly like ground beef...no hint of the distinctive taste of lamb anywhere.  Based on my first experience, I won't go back.  I would recommend going across the street to Zoe's Kitchen or down Alma School a mile to Pitta Souvli or a little further to The Ivy for much better gyro meat and gyro plates."}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff! The meat was tender and food flavorful. Complimentary baklava was a fun surprise and tasty! Love the freshness of the food."}
{"text":"Really good food, clean, and very nice manager!   Chicken shawarma was killer, lamb kebabs were a bit skinny.  Will be back"}
{"text":"Get the chicken shawarma plate and you will know why I rated them so highly. This is really good quality delicious food for a fair price."}
{"text":"Great food and excellent service. We had the gyro plate and hummus deluxe plate. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wow! What more can I say! The Chicken Swarma was the best! Had baba ganoush, tab oil and hummus. All excellent. The staff must of been watching because when the pita bread ran out, they came over with another plate of pita. They also gave us complimentary baklava. So nice! Definitely going back."}
{"text":"Excellent food, and great service. Ive had the gyro sandwich and the chicken shwarma plate. Both were very good. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant is absolutely amazing! The food is some of the best I have had and the service was fantastic. Would highly recommend this for anyone wanting a great Mediterranean lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I tried this place on Saturday after a search on yelp, it was amazingly delicious.  We had a hard time deciding, since everything in the menu looked so good.  We ended up with the al sham beef sandwich and the falafel appetizer.  The falafel was the best I ever had.  Perfectly seasoned and SO, SO good... yum yum yum!   The sandwich was also delicious and the meat had an amazing flavor and the beef was so tender.  I could eat there every day if it was closer to my house!  The only thing that would make it better is if they served alcohol.  The people were also so friendly.  We could tell they really cared about their customers experience.  After our meal, they brought us some baklava on the house and of course that was delicious as well.  Love this place!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not always a vegetarian/vegan but when I am, this is my spot.  I don't know how they make the food incredibly delicious that it even fools my tastebuds. This place does not disappoint, even my husband that's a meat and potatoes guy loves this place. That should mean something.   I even recommended this to people when they visit. It's a great place for everyone. And to this day, I haven't had anything that made me question the ingredients or the quality of the food. Do your body some good and get yourself some of this incredible food."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Wholesome fresh food thats affordable.  All of my family members (and I) have found the new dining hot spot for quick delicious food that's good for the Health, and your wallet!"}
{"text":"We were looking for something close to home and found this place on yelp.  We love Mediterranean food so decided to check it out.  This is way better than expected!! Employees are so helpful and nice.  Suggested a few items.  I got mix shwarma while my husband had go to plate.  We also had to try the kibbeh as it is a favorite of ours.  Huge portions, such diverse flavors.  Just delicious!!!  We were approached part way through our meal with inquiries of how our meals were.  She then said I'll be back with your baklava. I informed her we didn't order any when she said it was on the house.  So very nice and sweet after a sumptuous spicy meal.  We highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. The location is a bit weird but the food is soo good. I got the chicken shawarma plate which came with salad, salad, shawarma, pita, hummus and some delicious rice and it was 8.99!!! I cant recall if this includes the drink but either way they are free refills.  Everything was so fresh and very tasty. The hummus tasted alot like it did when I visited the middle east and was smooth as butter like it should be. The portions are HUGE, I honestly dont think I even ate half before i was stuffed. The staff is also extremely nice and very attentive. They actually messed up my bf order (added tomato when we asked to exclude) and they came to us once they realized it and made him a whole other pita and were so apologetic. This is what customer service is all about (p.s. he had already finished the one with tomato lol).  Give it a shot if you like mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"The food is fresh and perfectly seasoned , the workers are super nice and keep checking on you, and the prices are reasonable. I don't believe I've had a better kebab in my life ! Amazing Mediterranean"}
{"text":"Amazing food at affordable prices! We took our family of four here and ate for about $50 including dessert and leftovers for at least two of us. The customer service was friendly and the portions were so generous!"}
{"text":"Wow. ..they certainly deserve their 5-star rating. I had the hummus Deluxe plate with gyro meat and chicken shwarma and it was tdf. My husband had the gyro sandwich  fries and they were equally as good.  Everything is fresh, plentiful, tasty and great prices... what more could you ask for?  The baklava melt-in-your-mouth, best I've ever had. AND employees are super friendly."}
{"text":"After checking out the reviews, we decided to visit this place. We ordered the beef shawarma plate, Greek fries, mixed kafta and kabob platter, hummus. There was a misunderstanding on which shawarma plate we had specifically ordered but the staff gladly took the plate and shortly came back with the right order. The food was definitely worth the visit with huge portions, pretty affordable and the staff were great!!"}
{"text":"This place is a little hard to find, but well worth seeking out.  The food was delicious and the people could not have been nicer.  The baba ghanoush was excellent and there was attention to detail with every dish, even the rice, which was delicately flavored.  We were happy to discover this hidden gem and are already planning our next visit."}
{"text":"the place best around love it go 1 time a week no complaints hope stays in area long time"}
{"text":"I used to live up by the other location in Mesa and was sad when I moved ONLY because I was going to miss Green Corner. I was so excited to see this new location. I love many different things on the menu here and so do all my guest that come to visit."}
{"text":"Delicious food, some of the best chicken kabobs I've ever had.  Great, welcoming service and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Staff was great. Food was ok--a little dry and the chicken was just ok. They charge 50 cents for a tiny condiment size of tzatziki sauce which we needed because the meat was so dry. We usually love Mediterranean food but this was just ok. But the place was clean and the staff very nice.  I added a couple stars because the manager contacted me and apologized that we were disappointed in the food. Great customer service."}
{"text":"The Falafel was the best I've eaten in years, crispy and So tasty!  I will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"Friendly staff, good flavors but the meet is dry and over cooked. I like that they use spices and not too much salt for flavor."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the Phoenix area.  Absolutely love the mixed shwarma plate.  The salad, hummus, meats, and pita are all delicious and it's quite a sizeable portion.  Strongly recommend."}
{"text":"One of my top 5 meals in Phoenix.  Love the mix shawarma plate.  Salad and hummus are also fantastic.  Recommend the Baklava as well."}
{"text":"I wish I took a picture of my gyro, it was AMAZING!! You could really taste the quality of the meat. Very impressed!  Probably one of my new favorite places!"}
{"text":"I don't have to say I really want to love this place when you come here for lunch I expect a weight cuz it's really busy first off the customer service at the counter it's kind of shity guys not rude but not friendly either kind of going through the motions I ordered the lentil soup and the beef shawarma sandwich they're pretty quick and getting the soup out lentil soup was not good at all super watery no texture really had no flavor at all in that little tiny bit of onions in it skip the lentil soup mainly and went there for the shawarma this is where I'm not too sure about I ordered the 12in and it came out on a plate in like 6 pieces which I did not like at all cuz you you try to eat it it all falls apart and goes everywhere no longer sandwich now it's a big plate of mess only pieces you could really eat are the in pieces I don't fall apart have never experienced this before the sound is always wrapped up tightly so I could add your hot sauce and need it by normal without making it messy everywhere overall the flavor was good but the messiness disappointed me so you couldn't really enjoy it I may go back and try it again and make sure to tell them not to cut the sandwich so far as service and presentation of the food that's why I gave it three stars even though the flavor of the sandwich was a 4 maybe 5"}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food so try new places as often as I can. The place is clean and the staff are very freindly. The portions for the price is fantastic!! The bocliva was a little dry but very tastey (hard not to be). The gyro was savory and tasty. The Greek salad was fresh and good flavors. The humus was smooth, but could have been a little tastier.... all in all a good place"}
{"text":"good Middle Eastern. Food very well spiced and not over salted. Home made baklava a  treat. Thinking about it, and having returned several times, not everything is as stellar as that first meal. The chicken kabob was dry. Some of the meat was overly salted. The gyros are still  good and crispy. The tzatziki and the garlic sauce are not the same. I have yet to figure out which is which. One is good, the is thin and watered down.  We are returning because my husband loves the food here. As long as I'm careful ordering I'm happy too."}
{"text":"Cool place, great food, good prices, with good portions. Every meal I have ever eaten from here has always been a good meal.  I think they deliver too.... let's assume they do."}
{"text":"We try to go to this place every weekend. It's our favorite Mediterranean food in the east valley. The prices are excellent, as we usually split a meal for $10. The chicken, rice, and hummus are excellent."}
{"text":"I never liked baba ganoush until I came here. It is delicious. The hummus is also delicious and the sauce that comes with the chicken skewers is wow! I love this place and will come back every chance I get! The employees are also super nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time during lunch.  The place serves fresh, well seasoned, fast Mediterranean food. I ordered the humus with chicken shawarma plate that came with pita bread for scooping. My friend had the vegetarian plate that he loved so much. The chicken shawarma was seasoned so good it was a perfect pair to the humus. The bread was fresh and hot and perfect vessel for the chicken humus. If your ever in mesa you need to drop by."}
{"text":"Nice little local joint. Really thought the flavors were outstanding. Nice portion sizes and good service. Young lady at the front counter was super friendly. Would definitely go back. Would have given 5 stars but the mixed swarma plate, which had excellent flavor, was however a tiny bit on the dry size. All side dishes such as the salad and hummus were spot on awesome.... go here and support your local restaurant, these are worth the trip."}
{"text":"The best Baba Ganoush ever.  The Hummus is also exceptional.  I am a vegetarian and my husband is a meat eater, and both of us have many choices here.  Husband LOVES the lamb shank and the lamb kofta...and oddly enough, he says the french fries are the best.  The spinach pies are really delicious too.  Save room for the baklava, homemade and not the syrupy over sweet versions you sometimes find.  Very good value and friendly, helpful staff, clean surroundings."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious food. Generous servings. Great customer service. Will continue to visit."}
{"text":"Super glad that the Chandler location has finally arrived! This location is 2 miles from my house so I don't need to make the drive up to Mesa anymore.  This location is a bit bigger on the inside, although it looks like there's no outdoor seating so the total seating area is about the same. Everything else is pretty much exactly the same, including the massive portions, great flavors, and exceptional friendliness by all the staff members. My usual order is still the beef shawarma with everything, greek pita instead of arabic pita and garlic sauce instead of tahini. I'll also steal a couple pieces of gyro and some fries from my wife's Chicago style gyro plate, or in the case that I go alone (shh, don't tell her) I'll get a side order of the fries - they're so good!  I've taken a couple people to this location now and they've all agreed that it's some of the best food they've had in a while. Looking forward to eating my weight in shawarma for the foreseeable future!"}
{"text":"At the moment, Green Corner is my favorite restaurant in the valley. The food is insanely tasty, light, and fresh, the service is top notch, and the value can't be beat. The Green Corner combo is a good sampling of items, and I enjoyed each component on the plate. The falafel is the best I've had ever - crisp on the outside but not heavy or oily and it's packed with a ton of flavor. The gyro meat was fantastic, it appears they slice it and then crisp it up a little bit which gives you some crunchy bits which I love. Each plate is a ton of food for ~$10, one plate could easily feed two people but it's so good that I have no problem eating one by myself. They're opening a new location in Chandler soon, when that one opens I'll probably be stopping in weekly because it's dangerously close to my house."}
{"text":"Super good mediterranean food. They give you good portion of food enough for 2 people. The workers are super nice and attentive to the customers. And the best part is they gave me a complimentary dessert that was super amazing! I would definitely recommend this place and I would definitely revisit."}
{"text":"Great small new place, hard to find but tasty! My husband had the beef shawarma plate, the meat had real good flavor. I had a large chicken shawarma sandwich (had leftovers!) and some fries. The staff was attentive and friendly! Definetly a must-try in an otherwise unexciting strip mall."}
{"text":"I was on the road for work and wanted a sandwich. With the name Green Corner, I was thinking it was just an ordinary soup/sandwich shop but I was wrong. Turns out it's a Greek place which was a surprise but I was game to try it.   Damn! The gyro was so fire and moderately priced. The cashier was super friendly and some guy who I am guessing is the manager asked about my food which was great. If you are in the area and in need for lunch stop by here."}
{"text":"I just stumbled across this place a few days ago while in Mess. The name was deceptive but figured I'll give it a shot and I am glad I did.  Fantastic food and authentic middle eastern. I tried the Chicken Shawarma plate both times I was here and it is great. So are the hummus, salad, the saffron basmati rice, hummus and baba ghanouj.  Very hospitable owner and staff and most of all great food at reasonable prices. I am a fan now and will visit them again repeatedly.  Owner told me they are opening another one in Chandler in a few months.  Green Corner will not disappoint you. Great food and must try if you like middle eastern food."}
{"text":"Hubby and I just stopped there, saw the 5 star reviews on Yelp. Just the kind of place we love to find on our travels. Kind of a hole in the wall with wonderful, home cooked food. Had the lamb kebab dinners. The salad was yummy, the saffron rice was delicious, the lamb was perfectly seasoned, pita, hummus and sauces were fabulous and we really went over the moon with their baklava! Everything was just SO GOOD. Last of all the staff were very, very pleasant and accomodating. Definitely a must try restaurant for great food when ambience isn't important. We loved our lunch visit!  Almost forgot to add the portions were huge. We took home half our plates for dinner tonight. Great value!"}
{"text":"I was blown away by the authenticity of the food here. Several places claim to be Mediterranean or Middle Eastern food. But when you have it, it's completely Americanized. This place wasn't one of those places. Being Middle Eastern myself, it tasted like my mother's cooking. Very true to the culture. And very reasonable prices for the amount of food you get. I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Big portions. Great service. Reasonably priced. One of my favorite Mediterranean spots!"}
{"text":"Great food, superb service, a lively bustle--a great combo for a fun, inexpensive lunch outing. We ordered at the counter, waited briefly for a table, and within a heartbeat our food arrived.   While a while back and the details have become hazy in my mind, we loved the food. It was fresh and hot, colorful and flavorful.   We just loved the place. The customers, the staff, and the down-to-earth, sincere, energetic owner all together signaled to us that this is an unusually good establishment.   We had a chance to speak to the owner and urged him to open a branch near us in Scottsdale! That's how much we liked it!"}
{"text":"The Green Corner is a simple and clean restaurant with very friendly and helpful staff.  You go to the cashier and you place your order using the photo menu above you or the colorful, folded menu. They then give you a number to put on your table.  The staff brings you the food once it is ready.  We ordered the large combo that included one lamb, one beef and one chicken skewer.  These were accompanied by delicious, light and fluffy basmati rice, humus, a greek salad, and one piece of falafel.  The beef pieces needed more marinating and less cooking.  It was totally cooked through which made it a bit tough to eat.  The chicken and lamb were both delicious.  We loved the humus, falafel and the greek salad.  I wish the dressing had less sugar in it.  You can actually taste the sweetness.  I guess people love that, but cutting down on unnecessary sugars is a good thing.  A little olive oil would have done the trick.  They served a garlic sauce with the platter which was a little strange in its texture.  It was almost like a white margarine but if it is to be garlic sauce it should have a stronger garlic taste.   They gave us free baklava at the end which was very generous of them. We really enjoyed the food, atmosphere and customer service."}
{"text":"This place really is as awesome as everyone Rates! The lamb shank on Friday's only is to die for, get here quick because it sells out fast! The hummus is great the rice the stuffed grape leafs, and the gyros plate were all amazing! I highly recommend this place if your in the area!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, fantastic food....  awesome prices, great service, clean, delicious lamb chops, hummus, salad..., AND free Baklava dessert...  what more could you ask for"}
{"text":"Food is so good! Fresh and delicious! Shared the Chicago plate and it was the perfect amount of food, staff is also super friendly. The baklava was also good. Definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"Vegans rejoice! Order the vegetarian plate and ask them to veganize it for you, and voila, you'll get a wonderfully delicious and large portion of great food. I'm always impressed with good falafel; it needs to be perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside; Green does a great job with this. We went during the dinner rush but service was still excellent, the food came out quickly, and the line for the register moved briskly. It's located at the edge of a large shopping center so there's plenty of parking. It's starting to get hot out, but there's a outdoor patio if you want fresh air to accompany your meal. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy I found this place! Staff was extremely friendly and welcoming right off the bat. The food was phenomenal and portion size was a lot considering how affordable it is, I had the Lamb Kafta Kabob. The hummus that came on the plate was one of the best I've ever had and they even gave me a free baklava dessert (I let them know it was my first time in)! Amazing service and quality food, I'll keep this as my #1 Mediterranean food spot!"}
{"text":"So delicious! Everything at this place is SO good. I've tried almost everything. My favorite is the gyro plate (Chicago style). The customer service is top notch too. Everyone in there is friendly and attentive. The complimentary baklava is the cherry on top!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this place only 2 stars for one reason, brown lettuce!  The each and every piece of lettuce was trimmed in brown. I ate the delicious Gyro meat on top of my Greek Salad and helped my husband with his equally delicious Chicken Shawarma Plate. The help came around and handed out a wonderful complimentary baklava.  The people that work there are super nice so I decided to mention to the nice young man about the brown lettuce. He actually believed it was normal. I suggested they might keep it a little dryer and maybe it wouldn't get so brown. I know that this is a huge pet peeve for me but I eat lettuce every single day and  have eaten it in numerous restaurants and I may have had to pick out a piece or two but never has the entire salad been brown.  Other than that I would have given them a 5 Star review."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Food is great and the portions are huge. I have been here several times now and it never disappoints. The other day I was there and completely forgot to order my gyro without the sauce (I'm allergic). They made me a new one free of charge even though it was entirely my fault and I offered to pay them for the new one. Great customer service!"}
{"text":"This is the best middle eastern food I have had in Arizona. Its authentic. With every bite, it took me back to my trip to the middle east. The hummus was so delicious and smooth, like hummus should be. I had the chicken shawarma, the combination with the greek salad is perfect. Portions are really big too. Place is nicely decorated and the staff was great too."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a meal with a generous portion of food at a reasonable price then Green Corner Restaurant is a great option! I saw this place come up on Yelp when Mark R. reviewed it, and I've had it bookmarked ever since. It was a bit out of the way for us but we decided it would be worth a try.  The restaurant itself is located towards the back of a parking lot; It would be a hard find unless someone is actually looking for it (I did see that there's a Pok√©mon gym located nearby, however, so maybe that makes it a little bit easier). There were a few tables inside for different size groups, but overall, nothing fancy which is perfectly fine. All orders are placed at the front counter and food is brought out to your table.  We ordered the Chicken Shawarma Plate and the Gyros Plate which both came with a side of rice, salad, and hummus. It took a while to get the food, however we could tell everything was made fresh after we ordered it!  My favorite thing on the plate was the rice as it was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. It tasted great with bits of the chicken shawarma and garlic sauce. The salad was full of lettuce, cucumbers, bell peppers, tomatoes, kalamata olives, feta cheese, and dressing. I personally didn't enjoy the hummus as much as my fianc√© did just because it was a little bit more lemon-y than I prefer. Next time, I would ask if I could get something else instead.  We agreed that this restaurant would probably become our go-to for Mediterranean food because of the price as well the food itself. I would definitely recommend stopping by and giving this place a try when you're in the area!"}
{"text":"Super excited to see Green Corner has opened up a location much closer to us and their food seems much tastier as well. We have been to the Mesa location a few times for dinner in the past; this restaurant is much more modern & spacious, and the staff is friendly and helpful. The only confusion we had was with their hours because the two signs on the door had different information. One read open until 9pm and the other read open until 6pm. But as we came to learn, this is still their \"soft opening\" phase so the hours are a little bit more condensed.  The food here is amazing, definitely a must-try. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma plate. As you can see from the photo I posted, the size is very large. It comes with plenty of chicken, rice, Greek salad, as well as hummus & pita. I enjoyed everything on the plate but the Greek salad with chicken was my favorite, I might get just that next time! My husband got the Gyro pita combo which came with the sandwich, fries, and a drink. I had only a bite (that's all I could sneak in), which was delicious. Their fries were super crispy as well!  Overall, a really good option for lunch or dinner. Their menu consists of multiple sandwich options, a few combos, and also larger plates. As previously mentioned, the staff is really friendly and helpful, definitely ask them for recommendations if you can't decide what to have! That's what my husband did & he really enjoyed his meal. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Stopped by today for lunch after reading the excellent Yelp reviews. I had the chicken kabob plate and my husband selected the chicken thigh plate. The plates come with well seasoned rice, delicious creamy hummus, pita bread and a tasty fresh Greek salad. Both of our chicken entrees were very good - the chicken was juicy and I enjoyed the grilled vegetables that accompanied my kabob. The service was quick and friendly and we were given a complementary dessert plate- yum! We plan to return soon!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice and the food is great. We love the grape leaves and my wife is a tough grader, but we had them on both visits. The  baba ganoush is smokey and wonderful. Reasonable prices, nice people. If you like mideastern food please give this a try."}
{"text":"On a whim, we headed over to Green Corner for lunch on a random Thursday. And, now I shall be making the journey all the time as it completely warrants the drive! The food was super fresh and tasty while being very well seasoned. Plus, the portions are huge so you'll be able to take some to go! The lamb kebabs were delicious and the mixed shawarma plate could possibly feed an entire family. I would pretty much happily eat the garlicy shawarma sauce on anything savory. I really enjoyed the baklava as well as it wasn't too sweet or overly saturated in honey. Service was super friendly, and food came out really promptly."}
{"text":"The platters are delicious. The lentil soup is a must! Great value for the amount of food without compromising taste."}
{"text":"Amazing food and fast service. We had the Greek salad with gyro meat and the meat was delicious! The babaganoush and Greek Fries were also equally as good! Definitely going back and highly recommend! The portions are huge so easy to share!!"}
{"text":"Just another glowing review for the best shawarma restaurant in the east valley. Every plate is two meals for me and my wife - so much goodness. The chicken is moist and nicely spiced, the hummus I can eat with a spoon, and rice and salad as the sides.   You can't go wrong - enjoy!"}
{"text":"Green Corner was so good! Their food was fresh and full of flavor. The girl at the counter was so sweet and gave us complementary baklava with our order. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We came here after a long day of work. The food was amazing and the customer service was wonderful. The host was knowledgeable about everything on the menu and offered to give me a sample of the smoked eggplant to make sure I'd like it."}
{"text":"Excellent reasonably priced Mediterranean food. We had the green corner combo plate which had a fantastic steak Kabob chicken kabob and lamb kebab. The steak was so tender I could not believe it. It was really good steak. Everything else was fantastic including the baklava the hummus and the salad. Employees were all really friendly and we will definitely be back pricing was reasonable period I can't really complain about anything except that I'm not a fan of the green paint they use on half the restaurant. The high number of high star reviews are totally deserved."}
{"text":"What an awesome new find for our family!!! We love Mediterranean food and Green is absolutely delicious and very authentic. We ordered the beef plate with rice, salad and hummus, chicken shawarma and falafel. The falafel is best I've had in very long time most places the falafel is bland or dry but not here! Beef and rice were cooked and seasoned to perfection also the portion are generous. Keep it up I'll be here every week"}
{"text":"Just ate here for lunch. The food & service was great! I had the gyro plate & my co-worker had the beef shawarma plate. Portions were big, quality excellent and salads were fresh. Highly recommend. Great value."}
{"text":"This place is YUMMY!! I always order for carry out, however, it's clean, bright and pleasant inside. I've never gotten anything that wasn't spot on. The hummus, grape leaves and salad are delish...I love falafel and it can be DRY w/a capital D if it's not done correctly and there's is perfect, the kabobs are tender moist and very flavorful, the best part is the crew are family and I really, really love that. So, check it out...it's in the old strip mall where Black Angus and the movie theater used to be, I mention it because I took a minute to find it the first time I went..."}
{"text":"Great food for a great price.  The gyro sandwich is delicious, although that was the only thing I've had.  If it ain't broke, I'm not going to fix it.  As I walked in a young lady at the counter named Heaven welcomed me warmly and provided great service.  As I enjoyed my gyro I watched her warmly welcome everyone that came through the door and as each of them left she genuinely thanked them and wished them a great day.  That moved me to write this review.  Great service goes a long way.  Thanks for great value, Green Corner!  I'll be back."}
{"text":"The chicken Shwarma plate was ample, quite delicious, and reasonably priced, the staff is very friendly and the restaurant is clean. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Wow! Food was excellent. Large portions. Service was superb. Will definately be back."}
{"text":"Place was worth the drive. Heard good things about this place from Co-workers. A few of us came today for lunch. Food was awesome, the service was friendly and prices great. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"My husband and I both had a gyro sandwich and it was the best we have ever had! The meat was moist, not dry. The pita and all the other ingredients were so fresh. We were going to another restaurant to get gyros, but I think we found a much better place. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Our now go-to place to get Mediterranean grub. Great selection, delicious, and their portions are huge. My super picky boys even love this place. One of the best baklavas I've ever had. Friendly service. It's perfection."}
{"text":"A+ for the food and service quality. Great little Mediterranean restaurant in a strip mall. In the past I've gotten the deluxe hummus platter which is huge! I've also tried the chicken shawarma platter. This plate is big enough to share if your are not starving. There is also an outside patio area for extra seating. The mixed platter comes with rice, chicken and beef shawarma, salad or fries, hummus and a white garlic creamy sauce. The salad is delicious, it's got a tangy sweet dressing on it topped with feta cheese."}
{"text":"BEST FALAFELS IN TOWN! It's super hard to find good falafels and this place has them. I haven't gotten anything here that hasn't been amazing. My favorite is the chicken schwarma plate with hummus and rice. Great prices and VERY clean establishment. Would come here everyday if I could."}
{"text":"I love the people that work here! Everyone is nice and super helpful. I am Vegan and they told me how to order the Vegetarian plate to make it Vegan, and allowed me to choose my substitutes. My boyfriend is a meat eater and this is also his go to place for Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"This place has delicious food. They have a variety, and it is cooked perfectly. The hummus is always fresh and made there  The staff is extremely efficient  and friendly. The place is always spotlessly clean."}
{"text":"Very delicious food.  Especially  chicken shawarma. And very nice stuff. My favorite restaurant in tempe"}
{"text":"I loooved this restaurant i will definitely become a regular !! I am from Lebanon and i was craving a chicken shawarma sandwich i went there to try it and it was so great !! I love the bread they use it is A+. This is a place that makes it easier to be away from home for sure will be my go to place for sure !"}
{"text":"Friendly service, clean and bright.  MediterraneanISH.  HUGE portions, but the chicken sandwich was $10 with no sides!!  Sugar in my Greek dressing - WTXXX?  Beef and chicken gyro, but no lamb.  Everything precooked and heated or kept warm.  The tomatoes were actually red and tasty.  Next time may share mixed shwarma plate.  Fast casual service with no beer or wine - boo.  Overall, meh, but will not rush back especially since they messed up my Greek salad... com'on guys!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is so good! The Greek fries are the best ever!   You can't go wrong with any food choice here, plus the customer service is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Great food, fast service, and super nice staff. Huge portions at good prices. I've eaten TONS of mediterranean food, and Green Corner is very near the top of my list!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to check this place out for the last few weeks after seeing there reviews on yelp. I picked up a to go order to bring home for my wife. She had the chicken shawarma sandwich and I enjoyed the mixed shawarma entree. So good! We are already planning what we would like to try next."}
{"text":"Just happened to stumble across this place with the \"nearby\" button on my phone. It showed a hot new business and it was very close to my work. On top of that, my new Yelp friend Leslie A. from Scottsdale just happened to be checking in there and she gave me the big thumbs up.  This is a locally owned business with the owner and his team working side by side to deliver some very delicious and tasty mediterranean food. The inside is very clean and the food always comes out fresh and packed with flavor.  Ordered the Chicken Shawerma Plate on my first visit and was very pleased with the giant portion of food. Decided on the Green Corner Combo Plate for my next visit and was blown out of my mind. It was huge and had a nice combination of Lamb, Chicken, Beef, Falafel and it was served with Hummus, Greek Salad, Rice and Pita bread.  Their menu has a great selection of healthy choices and the prices are very reasonable. I was amazed at how good everything tasted and it cost less than your typical fast food chain restaurants. Nice!  Service is very friendly and the food is cooked fresh and on demand. Can't wait to go back over there and try some of the more unusual items that they offer. Even managed to turn my co-workers on to this place and they love it too.  Located back in the middle section of the complex next to the dollar store and Big Lots. See ya there during the week for an early lunch and chances are my mouth will be too busy eating to have any type of conversation. Maybe I can squeeze in a few words? HAPPY DANCE!  4.75 STARS"}
{"text":"My lasy two time was not good, the food quality has dropped a lot.  It's really sad, we really liked this place but that is not the case anymore. I hope they fix those issues."}
{"text":"I had to come here after seeing all the good reviews this place had. When we were looking for parking we took a glance at the restaurant and it was packed to the max. The only seats available at the time were outside and it was 100 degrees outside and we had a baby with us so that wasn't an option. The thought of going somewhere else passed our mind but we figured if the place is that full then it must be good so we ended uo going in and giving it a chance. After I ordered a fallafel with rice, fries and hummus, a table opened up. I almost got the vegeterian plate but after asking what everything included in it was I realized all I liked in that plate was the hummus and fallafel. The lady said I could substitute whatever I didn't like but I was limited to what I could substitute each thing to and it was a little confusing. She convinced me to get the fallafel cause then I could choose any 3 sides I wanted. While waiting for my food I read a review or tip on yelp that said this spot was a top 100 restaurant in the entire United States. My dish came out sooner than expected. I got it about 2 minutes after ordering it and I was told beforehand that it would take 15 minutes to make the rice but I guess I got whatever was left of the rice cause I didn't wait that long. The rice had a really good flavor to it and the fallafel and hummus was good, especially after adding the red sauce to it that comes in a bottle on almost every table. The fries were fine. I was a little suprised to see my pita bread cut up into 4 pieces and served on the side. I ended up making a little sandwich out of each piece, even putting fries in them. It tasted amazing! I was a little upset when I saw my girls plate come out like 15 minutes after I got mine with a whole bunch of rice on her plate, I'm talking like 70% more. I would have waited the 15 minutes if I knew it would get me more rice. The free baklava made me feel a little better about the rice thing, it was too good! So good I had to order 2 more and I somehow managed to eat them before I left. I really like this place and will be coming back. I just hope I get more rice next time. Really good food. I want to try their greek fries and lentil soup."}
{"text":"The girl who took our order was super sweet and friendly. I ordered the chicken shawarma. The flavor was good but the chicken was dry. My husband ordered the gyro plate which was tender and delicious. They even gave us complimentary baklava at the end of our meal which was the star of the show. Super delicious! We will be back but I'll stick to the lamb."}
{"text":"First visit. Impressed. Gyros sandwich without Pita was more than I could eat. Tasted great. Wife and I shared an order of Greek fries which was a huge order and delicious. Order taker very helpful and server was great. Topped off with 2 small baclava. Prices are good - soda only $1.79 WOW  Would recommend and will return. Very clean."}
{"text":"What a great find on a week where I didn't have time to cook and needed something healthy and nutrient dense to get us through the week! You can taste the freshness in the food and the prices seem reasonable. My husband ordered the gyro (pita/sandwich... I don't remember the exact name) and I had the vegetarian plate with a cup of lentil soup.  Everything tasted amazing. By far the best falafel and baba ganoush I've ever had.  I normally don't like stuffed grape leaves, but somehow always convince myself to give it another shot, and am so glad I didu this time! This is the only stuff grape leaves I actually enjoyed!"}
{"text":"Oh my Lord. Perfection in Greek food. Despite the seemingly blank store front and vague name (it's not really a restaurant, more of a fast food setup), as soon as we walked in the door I was floored. Warm greeting, very friendly, patient ordering. Fair prices, huge portions, clean setup. But the food.... Ugh, I had the chicken shwarma and gyro plates and I could eat that food every meal for the rest of my life. GET THE BAKLAVA! Best I've ever had. We were even thanked by every single cook behind the counter on the way out!   No guys, thank you. I'll be back as many times as I can make it there, as should everyone else in the Phoenix area. Wow."}
{"text":"best food in this area, Sham Chicken shawarma is unbelievable, dont forget to try their fresh Kenafah and Beqlawa. dont want to forget how friendly were the owner and staff"}
{"text":"Good Greek fast food, served in large portions. They need to provide more tzatziki sauce, or at least not charge you for extra. that would earn that 5th star"}
{"text":"I've been here four times. Every time I come they mess up my order or don't have something or are super slow. Today I came to give them one last chance.  I asked for an extra single skewers of chicken which has about four pieces of chicken on it and they told me it would be four dollars. Four dollars for 4 ounces of chicken. What a rip off. I'm never coming here again. I will not recommend this to any of my friends. Don't come here unless you want to get crappy food that takes forever that is too expensive."}
{"text":"I went to the chandler location and had the veggie plate. It was so flavorful and delish. The staff was friendly. I think the location is new because we were treated to baklava! It was the best Mediterranean food I've ever had. Definitely give this place a try because you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Came by today with my family after reading the reviews. We ordered the mix shawarma plate and gyro plate. The portions were huge and came out quick. The food was delicious and the place seemed to be quite popular too. We even got free baklava since we were first time customers. Aaliyah (*sp) at the front counter was super sweet and friendly. Honestly, even if the food wasn't good, I would give 5 stars just for the service!"}
{"text":"Best customer service I have ever received at any restaurant in my whole life. The beef Shawarma was very tasty the gyro meat is fantastic I got the beef Shawarma plate. And my wife got the gyro plate. Holy smokes this thing was loaded down with meat and food. The staff kept checking to make sure everything was okay make sure we had enough pita bread and even gave us some killer baklava. We spent $25 in total we also got chicken tenders and fries for our daughter overall some of the best Mediterranean food we've had and the best bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the food is spectacular. I recently went to the Green Corner Restaurant and placed a to go order(definitely want to call it in..), and was told the wait will be about 10 minutes. I sat there for 30 minutes wondering where my food was. I should of got up and asked why it's taking so long but didn't. While looking at the chef's and front counter, it seemed like no one had any idea what was going on and confused about the orders or something.. I saw at least one to-go bag sitting on the counter... While the hostess/front counter lady stood there waiting for what looked to be a second order. This order was for a gentlemen that came in about 5 minutes after me, ordered the same schwarma plate. After waiting for all this time, the person working the front counter who gave me an ETA of 10 minutes, walks over to the gentlemen that ordered clearly after me. She then gracefully apologizes to the gentlemen that somehow receives his order before me. I became quite frustrated in that and explained to her that I clearly ordered before him and wondering why my food took so long and how in the world the other customer was served first. I noticed, what looked to be the manager walking around and looking at the woman bringing my order. The manager never came over to apologize or anything, not even sure why I had to pay for the food honestly. I hate to write this kind of review about a restaurant I want to love and do love their food. But I was very frustrated after that. I usually just read yelp reviews and go to places that are highly rated, but I strictly signed up to write this review. I'm not sure if I will be back. I'll give it 2 stars just because of the food."}
{"text":"Had lunch here today it's in a cute little spot great patio for an outdoor lunch. The employees were so nice and even gave us free baklava at the end of our meal! Will definitely come here again"}
{"text":"This place is DELICIOUS!!! By far in my top three Mediterranean places in Phoenix. Tucked in a strip mall, Green Corner provides a variety of menu items and both indoor and outdoor patio seating. Ample private lot parking. If you order the chicken kabobs you'll be forewarned of the 15-20 min wait, but we asked for the sides to come early and they did. Tried the chicken kabob and gyro plate, both delicious and large food portions. They also gave us complementary baklava which was very good! Highly recommend, and yes, make the drive here to try it out if you don't live within the vicinity. Hopefully the area will turn around and repopulate to support this restaurant. Go here, leave happy."}
{"text":"It was my lucky day when Yelp showed this place in my search. Great food and a wonderful staff. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great meats and Veggies!  Baba ganush is tasty!  The meals are delicious and filling. They were quite busy on Sat night, and for good reason. There doesn't seem to be competition for fast, real food in the area at this price range. Will happily return when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Wonderfully cooked & flavored foods  We eat this types of food often because it is healthy - grilled meats, salads, beans, etc.  We got a gyro plate and a chicken thigh plate, no rice but extra salad instead.    The chicken was very moist with nice flavors.  The gyro was cooked well with a nice flavor.  Neither were under or over spiced but a nice flavor throughout the meat without being overbearing.  I loved that the dressing was not drowning the salad but just enough for good flavoring.  If you like more I am sure they would give you some more.  The hummus had a great flavor, a little different than typical hummus in taste and texture which was nice.  The kind you want the recipe so you could make it at home.  They included mayo with the gyro and tzatziki with the chicken.  Now we know, we would get  tzatziki with a gyro also.    The only item not outstanding was the baklava.  It was kind of ordinary after all the other food that was outstanding.  We will definitely  be back."}
{"text":"Glad to have a healthy, tasty option close to home. Was quick and easy to call an order in and then pick it up"}
{"text":"I have never been into the restaurant- I found them in a food dealer very service. But- OH MY! SO GOOD!  My go to order for the house is: gyros (3), large tabouli, and large hummus. Rarely are there leftovers!  The flavors are so crisp, fresh and delicious. This is one of my favorites to order from- I need to go into the physical place!!  Did I mention affordable? Because it is. I can get all the food mentioned plus the app delivery fee for under 40 dollars. And when feeding growing people- that is affordable!"}
{"text":"First time in but definitely won't be my last, place was clean and the staff were great! Advised me it would be about 20 minute wait for the food and it arrived about 15 minutes later. Portions are Very Generous for the price point and everything was Great! They even came by and have me a free baklava dessert. Would recommend to anyone looking for a friendly Mediterranean place to have great customer service and food."}
{"text":"Good food, good service. The food that stood out was the hummus and what hooked us to go back forever was for some reason they gave us a free baklava. And it was amazing! Well played sir because now you have us trapped forever in your delicious, flaky and nutty but not overly sweet, with a good balance of flavor claws that are your baklava."}
{"text":"This place has been my weekly go-to joint since I started going a couple of months ago.  The salads are always fresh, crisp, with big chunky cucumbers and tomatoes, and just the right amount of dressing. The gyro meat is to DIE for. Literally, since I may soon explode from eating it en masse. The chicken schwarma is excellent too - but I normally feel like being a bad girl so I go for the gyro meat. The falafel is crisp on the outside, tender on the inside and is nutty and just exotically flavorful enough to make you want to slap your mamma. The owner and the chef here are sweethearts - I eat low carb and they accommodated my needs by replacing hummus and rice with the Greek salad for me every time I asked. I bring new people here each week, and every single person has LOVED this place. For a treat I will occasionally bring my family home the gyro platter. Who am I kidding. By the time it gets to our house, it's not so much gyro and much more platter. Their baklava is gorgeous - nutty, honeyed, and flaky. (Like many of my friends, come to think of it) Baklava is given away more often than not.  the hummus is SUBLIME - just a hint of garlic but mostly a rich nuttiness that makes you long for every next bite.  Do yourself a solid and come here. They are amazing. And the place is pristine - bathrooms are sparkling clean and I am a MAJOR germphobe. The fastest way to get me to run out of your place screaming is for me to see any hint of roachiness.  I heart Green Corner."}
{"text":"I love this place. They give you a lot of food for a really fair price and the quality is fantastic. I used to go to \"it's all Greek to me\" but the prices and food here are much better especially the humus. Also the customer service is great everyone here is always in a good mood. The patio and inside are clean and the piano music adds to the classiness of the joint. So glad I gave this place a a chance!"}
{"text":"I usually go with the combo plate and it is delicious!  Everything tastes very authentic including the baklava.  Make sure to order a few extra pitas."}
{"text":"FYI, This restaurant is OPEN SATURDAYS UNTIL 10pm! Yelp got the hours wrong! So don't get discouraged!  This restaurant is a true gem! The food here is delicious! I ordered the steak kabob plate and my boyfriend got the chicken shawarma plate. They serve you huge portions and it's mainly all healthy! The staff there are all so kind and offer great service! You can tell they really care for their customers. We will definitely be back for some more awesome food; we recommend this place to everyone! P.S. the restaurant is OPEN SATURDAYS UNTIL 10pm! Spread the word!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just Wow. Clean, fresh, affordable. Everything was fantastic. Gyro meat was tender and hot. Shawerma chicken plate was a huge portion and the rice was perfect, just a little curry. My daughter was eyeballing the baclava on the counter and raving about how much she liked it and they GAVE us enough enough for the whole table! These guys absolutely deserve to be successful, everything about our experience was top notch. From the service to the French fries. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great tasting food and a lot of it.  Lamb kebabs we're so tender and tasty.  They even brought out a free dessert for us."}
{"text":"Ate here today for the first time for a co-worker's birthday. It was very good. My only complaint would be the Chicken dishes need to be all chicken breast. I don't like dark meat. Other than that, it was good. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We ate here and thought the food was very delicious and fresh we will be back again looking forward to it"}
{"text":"Food is very, very good and boy do they give you a lot! Wow... I was impressed with this hole in the wall. Was there on Sunday 4-6:30 pm and the place was packed. People apparently like to come her for Sunday night get-togethers with friends/family. I can certainly see why. Yum."}
{"text":"Very fast, pretty inexpensive, not bad Greek food. I like the falafel sandwich, but I haven't had a bad meal here."}
{"text":"A feast to be had, two chicken Shawarma plates for under $20. The hummus was creamy with olive oil on top.  Just the way we like it.  Chicken was  yummy crispy and adequate in quantity.  Rice had a hint caramom, ate it all. We swapped garlic sauce for tahini, just a preference as the garlic sauce is a little too thick.  The baklava was almost the best ever, not too sweet.  We will be back again, probably more then once."}
{"text":"Well you certainly get a lot of food.  We went to the Mesa outlet once and it was very good but not convenient.  This is my second visit to this outlet; just two miles from my new house.  The seating is definitely better and the place is generally more comfortable.  My first time it was noisy on a Friday lunch hour.  The chicken is really good.  I could eat double.  The cinnamon on the rice a nice touch.  Could not eat the salad, too much dressing.  Next time I will ask for salad without vinager dressing.  I love the hummus, made creamy without olive oil, traditional Middle Eastern.  I will be back many times.  Did not eat the bread."}
{"text":"The customer service was amazing, but the food was not worthy of the reviews this restaurant has received. My wife is Lebanese, so I may be a tough critic, but it seemed like run of the mill middle eastern food with awesome service. There are several other restaurants in town in this category that have better food."}
{"text":"Amazing in every aspect! Love being able to get Mediterranean food at a respectable price and in large portions! For under or around $10 you could easily feed two people. The meat was so tasty and had such an amazing smell that it left my buddy's vehicle smelling like the delicious food for a couple days. The Baklava we got on the side was also extremely delectable. The staff was very friendly and they had plenty of inside and outside seating. Will come back whenever I'm in the area, probably will find some excuses to drive over here just to get it!"}
{"text":"We had the chicken shwarma plates and baklava. I'd have to say top 10 best things I've eaten. Huge portion sizes and affordable. Recommend!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my husband. We ordered the hummus, Gyro Chicago style plate, and the Chicken Kebab plate. We had no complaints about the food and enjoyed everything. The meats were juicy and flavorful, rice was well seasoned and cooked perfectly, hummus was good, and the salad was also delicious. Can't wait to try some of the other meals in the future."}
{"text":"Excellent customer service, huge portions with lots of flavor, and affordable. Free baclava with an order! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best middle eastern food restaurants that I've ever visited. On top of that, they gave us a free Baklava! I do highly recommend their chicken shawarma."}
{"text":"Everything I've had here is amazing.  This is Middle Eastern food done right.  I recommend the lamb & beef Kafta, and the beef or chicken shawarma.  Also, the Falafel is done perfectly - fluffy inside, crispy on the outside.  Service is also great.  Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely amazing! I have not stopped thinking about my meal and have told everyone about it. I went there with a friend and we both had the chicken schwarma platter. The chicken was seasoned perfectly and everything was fresh and delicious. The portion size was tremendous so I had lunch AND dinner all for under $10.00. The service was great and they even brought out Baklava for dessert at no charge...and it was delicious! Even though I live nowhere close to here, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and delicious food! Huge portions. Highly recommend the gyro sandwiches and baklava! I can eat here everyday"}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place. Food is excellent, portions are generous, and staff is helpful and friendly.  It has become one of our staple \"go to\" places."}
{"text":"5 stars for green corner. I went there with some friends and the everything was great! We were greeted as we walked in with someone happy to take our order. The food was very tasty and fresh. We order took our seats and our food was brought to us in a timely matter. The portions are large and well worth the price! Someone checked up on us to make sure we enjoyed the food. We did very much! At the end they brought us some really good baklava free of charge. The beef shawarma was very good along with the humus and sauces. I will be back for sure!  ."}
{"text":"Ok, the music was some classical blah. Walking in the door-had some dessert sitting in the open-like the gal sweeping-for sure dust was all over that! The food was mediocre. The Falafel was ok but the tahini sauce was right consistency but flavorless. Need to change the music and add some TVs or something to the green bare walls. Must keep up with the bathroom cleanliness since you only have ONE BEDROOM! So disappointed. Hope you fix the issues before moving to queen creek"}
{"text":"So this is a bit overdue, but better late than never. ;-)   This little place is tucked away in a HUGE strip mall type location, but DO NOT let that fool you on bit! The inside of the restaurant is super clean and has a patio, so there is plenty of room for several guests. The decor is bare, however I love that the restaurant and restrooms were so clean. You could also see into the kitchen and Ive gone a few times at about 1:30 (after lunch rush) and it was still CLEAN.   The service was very nice, I'd really give 4.5 stars if I could but they are more deserving of  5 than 4. It is counter service (reason for my 4.5 ) but they were VERY polite and timely. The first time I came here I let them know and they were super helpful.   I had the Hummos and the texture was smooth and on point. It's served with a little well of olive oil that makes me really really happy and lots of warm pita. I also tried the greek salad and the dressing was very tasty and well seasoned. The veggies were all cruchy and fresh, lots of cucumber, tomato, green bell pepper, red onion and kalamata olives. The star of the show was the Shawarma. Holy cow was it so well seasoned, not dry at all and very delish. This place is a fantastic value for what you pay; the servings are very generous. Finally, they gave me some dessert to try on the house and it was so darn good. It was a great investment as I stop there for baklava every time I remember...haha  Def give them a try if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Very friendly service. Food was outstanding! The only problem was the lamb shank was tough. Loved everything else! Will return."}
{"text":"Food and service are top-knotch. I'm a big fan of the  Chicken Kabob platter. The only down-fall is there is a 20 minute wait for this dish, so you might want to call ahead! The platters come with generous portions, almost enough to share. The upside is the free baklava."}
{"text":"Good portion size and tasty chicken shawerma. Got my plate with hummus and extra salad. The lettuce and veggies were fresh and crisp. Very friendly staff--will definitely go back. In the back of a shopping center surrounded by empty stores so was pleasantly surprised by the quality."}
{"text":"Always awesome. Everything on their menu, always tastes fantastic. Always fresh, always filling.   Love this little place, great customer service, very affordable, very filling.  How can you beat that? Will happily keep coming back.  If you haven't been here, you need to check it out asap, or you're missing out."}
{"text":"This place is actually pretty good, the food smelt great. Next thing would have to try would be their lamb chops!!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best. It's rare to find a 5 star restaurant with over 400 reviews and this place definitely is all it's cracked up to be. Highly recommend! I've had many things off this menu and nothing has disappointed so far, plus they throw in baclava when you eat in! Fattosh salad! Shawarma! Gyro! Kabob! Falafel! All so good."}
{"text":"Small place with great food! Great hole in the wall atmosphere. Has an outside seating area with shades to reduce the glare of the setting sun.  Very quick service as well. Staff is also very friendly. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great portions. Friendly, good service. Excellent quality/ fresh. Relaxed atmosphere. Take a look at the other customers' plates and see for yourself.  A true gem."}
{"text":"We've been searching for a medi food & we finally found the perfect place! We had shawarma & since it was our first time the owner gave us a free baklava, what an awesome experience we had, we will definitely be back. Awesome people plus awesome food equals great experience!"}
{"text":"Love this place! So inexpensive and the portions are VERY generous."}
{"text":"I just happened to be in Mesa to check out the Arts Center on a recent evening and what I discovered was one big bedroom community with shopping plazas and strip malls a-plenty. I was looking for a healthy dinner in an unfamiliar suburb and found this Mediterranean fast-food spot on my Yelp app. Little did I realize this was #85 on Yelp's just-published Top 100 Places to Eat in the entire country (link: http://bit.ly/2sN4Qsa). It was an admittedly quirky list of non-Michelin-starred eateries, but I can see why Green Corner would have a devoted following. It holds a dominant position in - surprise! - a small shopping center with a huge parking lot (photo: http://bit.ly/2EJqWNK). It was a compact spot and fairly busy with families having taken over the booths.  I read that their spit-roasted meat was made in-house and tasted amazing, but I attempted to stay healthy and went with the $8.99 Vegetarian Plate which featured three good-size falafel balls nicely crisped, a very fresh hummus, baba ghannoug, tabouleh salad, a pair of dolmas, and tahini sauce with a lot of pita wedges in a separate basket (photo: http://bit.ly/2ony6RN). If I was feeling more calorifically inclined, I would have gone for the &13.49 Green Corner Combo Plate which offered chicken, beef, and lamb kafta kabobs plus a falafel ball. However, I was happy with my sensible choice, and the staff was kind enough to serve me a complimentary slice of their Baklava (photo: http://bit.ly/2CCtOKq). How could I resist that?  FOOD - 4 stars...real home-style Mediterranean that tastes fresh and flavorful AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...just a fast-food space but well maintained SERVICE - 4.5 stars...stellar...and they give away baklava TOTAL  - 4 stars...is it the 85th best place to eat in the country?...who am I to argue with my Yelp brethren?"}
{"text":"holy tits yall way too good the gyro's should be a  scheduled 3 narcotic"}
{"text":"This place is almost invisible in it's little corner of the strip mall.  Has a small outdoor eating area which is pretty nice.  Inside it is unremarkable and plain.  However, it is clean, and the employees are nice and professional.  I have tried several things here and I have enjoyed it all except the Baba Ganoush, which tasted fine but the texture is not for everyone.  The food is wonderful, fresh and presented nicely.  The fries are the bomb as is the hummus.  Here it is all about the food and it passes with flying colors."}
{"text":"Best place ever! Excellent baklava baked fresh daily.  Rice has perfect amount of time tic- yum!!!"}
{"text":"Not as great as I expected after seeing everyone else's review.  It was okay, but really I have had better.  This is located in a strip mall, with no ambiance (which doesn't affect the food quality).  It is definitely a fast food kind of place.  My husband had kabobs and rice, and he said he had better kabobs.  Tried his rice, and it had a bit of a funky taste as they used too much sumac.  I had the vegetarian platter, and I have definitely had better grape leaves and hummous.  The falafel were way overcooked, making them very hard on the outside and not tender on the inside.  It's not bad - but it's certainly not great.  Also, why the weird little puffy pita triangles?  I expect regular pita bread if you authentic."}
{"text":"Well 1st off if you are in a rush or like HUNGRY NOW I suggest you call/order ahead they actually make their food when you order it and it's not really pre-made which in retrospect is a good thing. When I walked in I notice the pleasant smell of their food being cooked for the other guest which instantly made me even more hungry. The cashier informed me about how long it will take for my food to be ready which was actually very accurate he also offered me a cup for water while I wait. While waiting I saw all of their staff either cleaning or greeting incoming and seated guest which is a plus for any business. Mohamed was the employee that brought out my food and was very courteous. The food was VERY good in my opinion i ordered the chicken kabob and it tasted delicious and the Greek salad and rice paired well. It did taste lemony/zesty but it was not overwhelming at all. The person that prepared my food knew what they were doing to say the least. As I was eating I was greeted by a young lady (didn't get to catch her name) she was very nice and asked me how my food was and if she can do anything to make it better. Once I finished my main meal Mohamed brought out a size of baklava which was actually very good, it was definitely sweet and I'm not normally someone that enjoys sweets but it was enjoyable. Over all I enjoyed my 1st time in Green Corner and I'll be back to taste some other dishes. Definitely will recommend to people."}
{"text":"So this place is a complete home run for some things... a bit light in a few spots that I typically look for.  But it is such a screaming steal for absolutely great Mediterranean food that I'm willing to give them 5 stars despite the few short comings.  The great: The food, the food, and THE FOOD.  we tried a variety of their food, and everything was absolutely fantastic.  My only comment would be that the baklava was a bit heavy, but ridiculously flavorful (what spice was that???) The service... eager to please and make sure the customer was happy and the food was to our liking.  In fairness it was pretty empty when we went, but the attitude was evident and I doubt that would change with a more full restaurant.  food was ready pretty quickly, but again, the restaurant was pretty empty. Prices...  $25 for two for dinner including appetizers, full meal, drinks.  Extremely reasonable. Portions... took about 1/3 of our food home and were totally full.  The good: The atmosphere... a bit industrial and spartan.  Concrete floors make the dining area a bit echoy and empty feeling.. Location:  up North of the 60 just off of Alma School, not the greatest neighborhood.  but everybody's gotta be somewhere.  NET:  All in all, if you are looking for great Mediterranean food and don't care much about atmosphere.. this is the place.  My favorite from that perspective was Princess a few miles south, but as of this review, I've got a new favorite when I've got a hankerin'.....  Normally the knocks I've mentioned above for atmosphere would be enough for me to drop this to 4-stars, but the food was so over-the-top good that I've made an exception here.  Just know what it's getting the 5 stars for and if that's what you're after, this is the place."}
{"text":"We had the food delivered to the hotel we were staying at in the Mesa/Phoenix area. Everything we ordered was scrumptious, except for the Baba Ghannough. The Baba Ghannough was okay, and I would not order it again. The meal was quite filling, in fact, we had it a second time for dinner. Everything was very fresh, and we think made to order. If/when we are in the area again, we will take the opportunity to visit this restaurant."}
{"text":"Love the food, shawarma is to die for. Hummus was delish. Over all everything was really good and very inexpensive. I will definitely be back. And totally worth the drive."}
{"text":"When we don't know what to eat, this is our go to stop. Now that they have one in Chandler, we're happier. I ALWAYS get the lamb chops. Well worth the 20 minute wait."}
{"text":"I am glad I have found this place.  Every single item on the menu is top-notch. They deliver high quality food with equally great service. These folks take their food seriously and have great etiquette.  I hope they open a branch at Chandler location as well but I don't mind 30 mins drive since food is the worth and these folks never disappoint us."}
{"text":"Some differences between here and Haji Baba, my other go-to eastern Mediterranean place: The rice served with combos is a beautiful, better-tasting yellow color; the shawarma sandwich is wrapped in a flakier grilled bread than a pita; there is a Chicago-style gyros plate (the guiltiest secret pleasure of any true Chicagoan); and each dine-in order gets two free baklava (at least if you get a plate combo). Great price and friendly service. New favorite"}
{"text":"Another place my wife and I live down the street from. Again, lucky us! This is our go to 'Mediterranean food' joint. We're in here probably at least once a week. I've had just about every item on the menu and I ALWAYS order a side of kibbeh with any and every meal but it's ALL good. Atkins friendly too if you forgo the pita bread and substitute the rice for tabouli but they give us free baklava EVERY SINGLE TIME! (Please don't stop, and I'm sure we'll see you guys again this week.)"}
{"text":"Great customer service, lamb kofta, chicken schwarma, falafals, rice salad and hummus was delicious."}
{"text":"The friendliest and tastiest little Mediterranean corner restaurant you will find in Mesa. As soon as you walk in, everyone greets you with a smile, and when you leave, it's the same warm customer service.   The food portions are hearty and the food tastes great. My daughter and I had lunch-me the chicken with Greek salad and she had a gyro plate. Had plenty of leftovers and it hit the spot.   The prices are affordable too, so order everything on the menu if you're starving! I like that you can customize your plate and substitute things for healthier (or not) options. Fresh baklava for dessert perfectly tops off any meal, so sweet and flaky. Very casual dining setting--its kind of set up similar to a Subway restaurant--a few booths, couple of tables, main place to order, and a drink station.   While I would've come back here just for the food (yes, it's very good!)  the real kicker is the hospitality and kind attitude that pretty much everyone who works here shows to its customers. So many places have drones and zombies working for them, but Green Corner Restaurant is a breath of fresh air!"}
{"text":"I am glad we found this new Mediterranean restaurant close to my kids.  Food was fresh and tasty. You get a lot if food and the pricing fir 5.99 you get a big bowl of hummus.  Wish we got more pita.   Service is friendly.  The inside is fresh and very clean.   I look forward to our next visit"}
{"text":"We discovered this gem last night. Mediterranean food is my favorite cuisine in the world. I have been fortunate enough to visit Turkey for almost a month and while there, I never had any food that was not superb. Anxious to try this after reading good reviews, we were not disappointed. I had the chicken shawarma plate while my husband had the gyro plate. I also had a bowl of their lentil soup.  Everything we were served was incredible, I particularly loved their tabouli and the lentil soup.  Both meats were prepared beautifully and the rice had a lovely subtle flavor.  I have never really liked baklava but their version was magnificent. I realize I have used many superlative adjectives but that's how good this place proved to be. If you love really good quality, well prepared food with a Mediterranean flavor, you will love this place."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Lots of options even if you are on Keto diet.  Owner, manager, and staff were super friendly even when we called in an order 5 minutes before close.  We watched a few plates come out and the portions were huge. We ordered a large salad and combo entree and that was enough for 4 adults."}
{"text":"So so excited we found Green Corner! Thank you Yelp! Reviews were great so we decided to try it.   We went in at around 8:00pm or so, there were a couple of occupied tables. Soon after that more and more ppl started to poor in. Some ppl ordered take out, others decided to dine in.   We ordered the beef and chicken shawerma meals. I was particularly interested in the thin bread, this is called Arabic Shawerma were the sandwich is rolled up and cut into about bite size pieces. I really loved the chicken shawerma, it was very similar to the shawerma I used to have from a place called Sultan Dubai. The beef shawerma was pretty good too but I felt the Taheeni sauce could have used some more lemon juice and the sandwich could have used more vegetables. They were very generous with the meat!   The portion size was great and the price was reasonable. The service was excellent and the food came out fresh and in a short amount of time. The dish is served with fries, coleslaw, the sauce it goes with and a drink.   I am definitely going there again and recommending the place to family and friends!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible. The staff is very friendly. They're always willing to help with any questions you have about the menu. For the amount of food you get the price can't be beat. I have been now maybe 10 separate times and I've never been disappointed once. The chicken Al Sham is great. I work with three Iraqis and all them say this is the most authentic they've had. Don't miss out on the baklava."}
{"text":"This place is mine and my boyfriends FAVORITE place ever. Like seriously. The food is over the top and the service is amazing. I normally don't leave reviews because I don't care but this place deserves it. Five stars and then some!"}
{"text":"We are Mediterranean food lovers!  The most delicious meals and friendly and courteous staff! A perfect experience!"}
{"text":"After eating at several Lebanese friends homes, several Greek families himes, I have to say this reaturant was like heading to a family dinner on Friday night.  Their portions are huge for the price.  The wife found them to try something different.    I had the lamb kifta, with rice, hummas, and salad while My Wife tried their mixed kabobs.  We split (i inhaled) a plate of Dolmas.  All of the food was done to perfection.  The baba ghannoug was a bit flat for my taste.  Now, on our second visit we ordered Gyro plate, large hummus with extra pita, Dolmas.  Even with 2 people eating this, we had leftovers! As with our first visit, the food was beyond what you could hope for.  The staff.  All I can say is the kids are so sweet and friendly. They go out of their way to get to know their customers.  Even a \"Redneck\" looking white boy who does not blend in with majority of the customer base.  Some of the younger ones do not known the food by the tradtional names.  So be prepared to order off the menu by discrption ie Stuffed Grap leaves (Dolmas).  For desert, be prepared for some of the best baklava this side of the dead sea!   They do make Knafeh.  If you want this bit of heaven, you need to order it the day ahead."}
{"text":"Everytime I go back, I try to get something different, and everytime I get something it gets better and better! The falafel sandwich is my new favorite. The babaganush or however you spell it is SO authentic with strings of real eggplant. I love it all, once again. Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"This place is just terrific!! The food is just superb, hubby said it's the closest he's had to authentic since visiting Greece!!! Meat was tender, veggies fresh, all just delicious!!! Service was wonderful too, staff were friendly, helpful, and really cared about our dining experience..... and let's talk about the complimentary baklava.... yummooooo! We'll be regulars, for sure!"}
{"text":"Hard to find good Mediterranean / Greek food in El Paso, so when we saw the ratings for this place, we just had to stop! Husband had been craving the schawarma he got used to while working in Canada (huge immigrant population = amazing food!). He got the mixed schawarma ate, which came heaping with meat, a salad, a healthy portion of hummus and saffron rice, as well as a big pita to scoop it all up with! Delicious! He's a big guy and this filled him up (I took care of that pesky healthy salad for him). They also brought two complimentary slices of baklava, a touch I've never seen before! Getting the food took less than ten minutes, and it definitely seemed fresh. It was so good and the husband has.l been missing that type of food so much we ended up going back again for takeout for dinner to take back to the hotel. Any future trips to Mesa / Phoenix are likely to feature a repeat visit here!"}
{"text":"So many good things to say about this place.  I've been several times and it never fails to impress me.  Staff is excellent - friendly, grateful, attentive, fast.  It's an order a the counter type of joint, so very casual but top notch. Food is amazing. Huge portions.  The gyro meat is insanely good.  My fave is the shawarma chicken and shawarma beef plate (ask them for half and half, they'll do it).  I've taken out of towners here twice, and everyone has raved about one thing or another (garlic sauce, hummus, meats, etc).  An absolute must try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Greek food I've ever had. The chicken shawarma is SO good and the service is so friendly and helpful. I could go on and on about the food, atmosphere, timeliness, etc."}
{"text":"We actually visited this place specifically because it had a good Yelp review and we were craving Gyros. We were absolutely blown away by the friendliness of the staff. The food was cooked to order. It was piping hot and so flavorful. They even gave us baklava after we finished our meals.  I think that I had the chicken schwarma meal and I would highly recommend it. It was enough for 2 meals though. I had to get a to go box because it was just too much food to eat all at once. The hummus is delicious too.  My family will definitely be back here again.  If you like gyros and schwarma, this is a must go place."}
{"text":"This place rocks!!! Lamb shank platter was amazing! Meat falls off the bone. Salad,  hummus the perfect flavors. Their portions are big, so we enjoy the leftovers next day. Perfect Mediterranean food, and staff are wonderful. Best thing is baklava for dessert. You leave with a sweet taste in your mouth."}
{"text":"Every so often in life we come across a food that reminds us why we even have taste buds. This place has some of the best Mediterranean food I've ever had. The food is seriously amazing, and the baklava is total perfection. The staff was extremely happy and helpful. The place was clean. The ambience was on point. Congrats on winning the food game."}
{"text":"We love this place. Food is healthy and plentiful enough to share plates. We drove 20 miles to have dinner there today. Our 3rd visit while visiting the Phoenix/ Scottsdale area.  We've tried the falafel, chicken shawarma, gyros and vegetarian plates. And the baklava is quite tasty!"}
{"text":"I still love this place as much as when my boyfriend and I first stumbled upon it.  The food is always cooked perfectly, generous portions at affordable prices, and even complimentary baklava (that we ordered extra of anyways because my man is obsessed). Not to mention the food comes fast and the workers are so nice! We are always impressed by the quality all around  at Green Corner.   So like I stated before, if you haven't been here before, come. ASAP."}
{"text":"Sl delicious! Our first visit and everyone in our family was impressed.  The best hummus I've ever had but everything our family ordered was fantastic. The chicken shwarma is a must try.  The lamb shanks were also marvelous. On top of it all, the owner's customer service is above and beyond what I expect for any restaurant.  We'll be visiting often!"}
{"text":"We ordered, went to our table, waited for our food and once the plates arrived they were a generous portion. Place was very clean, food was tasty and flavorful. When we were eating one of the girls gave us a taste sample of Baklava, which was freshly made and tasted heavenly. We liked the restaurant and definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"This spot is a hidden gem!  When I'm in phx for work from Dallas, this place is a must stop and eat!"}
{"text":"Q:  What the halal is an 'al sham beef sandwich'?  (A)  a middle eastern beef burrito; (B) a cumin beef roll; (C) a flatbread stuffed with flavorful beef, lettuce, tomato, and pickles with a white (garlic?) dipping sauce alongside; (D) the tastiest and most satisfying lunch experience I have enjoyed in Mesa.  Answer:  all of the above!  I really liked Oma's Place when it occupied this spot - but Green Corner is even better!  When I walked in the place the kitchen dudes were roasting eggplants on open flames for their baba ghannoug.  Like Rene Zellweger famously said - they had me right then (at 'hello').    Clean.  Well-run.  Great menu of middle eastern favorites.  I got my 'al sham beef' as a combo which came with fries, a dollop of coleslaw, and a bottomless fountain drink (about $12.40 incl tax).  The 'sandwich' is a generous portion of two beef rolls.  Lots of cumin.  Beef juicy and slightly rare - just right.    I'm already plotting my return...  My new go-to spot in Mesa"}
{"text":"Bright, clean and fresh restaurant. Food is excellent, had chicken shawarmas so far the best we have ! Servers are polite and attentive very nice addition to south chandler area."}
{"text":"The tastiest middle eastern food I've had in years. You order at the counter and the wait staff brings your food. The place is clean as well. I bring friends from the east coast regularly to sample this delicious food."}
{"text":"Delicious Middle eastern food, afordable prices and good service. It is a little bit small inside and can get crowded and loud but you can try the patio if you are uncomfortable inside."}
{"text":"I never really tried Greek food but I think I love it it was awesome girl in the front was very informative and explained everything well I will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"This place is great I'm so glad we found it! Tons of food. Great staff. Free baklava! This will be a go-to favorite! Go hungry!"}
{"text":"Unable to take photo. Food was ready in 10min, it was so delicious. I got a Gyro 1/2 Beef shawarma combo plate.   Salad was so Amazing I wish I ordered more, the Gyro was nice and moist very flavorful and the beef shawarma was Tasty also still moist. Most places over cook or burn the meat and this place has is PERFECT! the Hummus was Amazing fresh tasting and They give ALOT! I also ordered a Gyro sandwich with fries also Huge portion and Very Hot fresh fries ! All this for under $20.00   They also cater I believe, I asked before I left. I am very pleased with the food.   The place itself is very very clean. The staff is friendly. I called and ordered ahead good thing I did there was a line behind me when I walked in to pick up my food."}
{"text":"So I decided to take a leap of faith and try Green corner per review in Mesa location.  It is new to Octillo area.  It is a new neighborhood restaurant.  I was very happy I did.  The General  Manager is very nice and helpful.  I was pleasantly surprised how with how good and fresh the food is.  I had a great Chicken Kabob with Greek salad.  It was FRESH AND FULL OF FLAVOR.....the hummus was the best I've ever had.  It's a nice healthy alternative in our neighborhood. Will be regular for me and portions are large.....recommended others to take the leap also..."}
{"text":"I had the chicken shawarma.  It came with salad, rice, pita, hummus and baklava.  I have never had Mediterranean food before.  I was absolutely delicious.  The salad was so much more that just lettuce.  It had chopped tomatoes, cucumber, olives and feta cheese.  It tasted very fresh. The seasonings in the chicken and hummus and rice was wonderful.    Also the place is very clean and the staff have excellent customer service skills.   This is my new favorite."}
{"text":"Was a good food, just was not happy with a 30min wait for our food. But they did make it up with the baklava."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing service. Great value. They even brought a complementary baklava. Liked it so much went back the next day."}
{"text":"Tried this place out today in the new Chandler location. It was very clean and plenty of seating. Staff was super warm and friendly. Do look at the menu before going if possible. So many yummy choices. Prices are comparable to other Greek restaurant from about $7-15. However, portions are huge. We had leftovers.  Best part is they give you complimentary baklava at end of your meal. Delicious!!!! Definitely try it!"}
{"text":"I thought my review had posted before, but I was mistaken! So I wanted to take the time to post another one, because as a girl who appreciates amazing food, I feel this place deserves it. First of all... The service is incredible! The guys who run this place are so sweet and helpful. But let's get to the good part... The FOOD! The chicken schwarma is TO DIE for. I can't even explain the flavor of whatever they cook this stuff in, but it is incredible. The steak/beef hummus is amazing. I would eat that shit every day if I could. And the green corner combo is a great little sample of all the different meats, but on a skewer. I personally like the flavor of the schwarmas better, BUT all is incredible. To end the meal make sure to get the baklava. I literally cried tears of joy after taking my first bite. I love green corner."}
{"text":"My favorite entree is the chicken kabab plate but I substitute hummus for baba ghanosh. Fantastic!!! I also love their falafel. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Mediterranean perhaps?! This place was absolutely delicious!! Added feta cheese to the gyro to add some more umph! And the most important part? FREE BAKLAVA! I could not believe that I've never been to a place that gave out free delicious baklava! If I could give this restaurant 6 starts I would!"}
{"text":"This was a very pleasant surprise.  We came for an early lunch after running an errand in the vicinity.  It's a hole-in-the-wall in a very sad little plaza.  But the ratings seemed good, so we walked in.  At first glance the menu is pretty typical of a Mediterranean place.  Shawarma, gyros, tabouleh, kababs, etc.  The table ordered a shawarma, some lentil soup, and a gyro plate (Chicago style, meaning it has fries instead of rice).  Everything was really good.  The lentil soup is perhaps the best I've had anywhere.  They gryo plate came with pita, tatziki, cucumbers and tomatoes.  I made little gyros from that and it was excellent.  The fries were well-cooked and did NOT need ketchup (I assume a light seasoning was present).  And I tried the rice someone else got...it was excellent also.  Looks can be deceiving.  I didn't really expect much when I walked in, but everything we had was outstanding.  Not just \"for the price\" or \"for what it is\".  It was outstanding all the way around.  As good or better than any I've had before.  It's right on the cusp between $ and $$.  Some items are $, but some of their plates are $$, so I specified $$ in the questions section."}
{"text":"I will literally never get sick of eating here. My husband and I come here at least twice a week. Best food and the nicest people!!"}
{"text":"We have loved eating at this spot. Their menu is authentic and well-prepared. Their staff is friendly and attentive. Plates are enough to share, or plan on taking home! Plan on a delicious piece of baklava for dessert, complimentary!!"}
{"text":"I had the beef shwarma plate. Meat was cooked very well and had good flavor. The rice was also very tasty but the best part was the Greek salad. Very fresh and fulfilling. In addition the restaurant gave us free baklava which was awesome and my daughters favorite item of the day. Very nice and welcoming people, definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"this place is seriously AMAZING! I have had the chicken shawarma and the veggie plate and they were both sooooo good! HUGE proportions and EXCELLENT service! I was introduced to this place by a co worker recently and I can't stop going back!"}
{"text":"Came in after night classes and was pleasantly surprised at how friendly the staff was. I told them I couldn't have any dairy and they brought my lentil soup and Greek salad out with no cheese and dressing on the side. The lentil soup was some of the best I ever had and the salad was VERY fresh! Towards the end of my meal the girl working brought me a free piece of dessert which she said had no dairy. I will be coming here again, needless to say:)"}
{"text":"We just moved from out of state, so we're trying to find all of our new favorite restaurants! On the list was Greek/Mediterranean.  We came here after boyfriend found it on yelp with high reviews and high stars. Done.  We drove in and were pleased with the menu, the service, and the friendliness of staff - I would come back just to say hi and wish them a good day!  As we were waiting, we overheard a gentlemen go up to the counter and say the food was phenomenal. WIN. couldn't wait to try ourselves!!  Baklava was free with out order - TAKE ALL MY MONEY!  The baklava was so delicious and yes, previous gentleman at the counter, this food was phenomenal. I had never had baba ganoush (I totally spelt that wrong, I know) before and everything was just superb.  We cannot WAIT to go back!!"}
{"text":"Wow we found this on several websites including yelp,well worth it, excellent prices even better food the flavors the freshness I can't say enough about it and extremely pleasantly surprised Yum Yum treat yourself to come here. We ordered the shawarma combination it was huge shared it with the baba ghannoug and tabouleh it was deliciousI don't usually brave as much is this about food I would come here all the time if I lived in the area were here for Chicago cubs Greentree I will definitely go back and fix this place often again treat yourself to some wonderful fresh food"}
{"text":"My wife and I really enjoy the food and the friendly people.  We go there At least once a week."}
{"text":"Drove 10 miles to try it out just based on their yelp reviews. Have to say they DID NOT disappoint. The food was fairly priced and good. The service is too notch ! And we even got free dessert which is AMAZING! The place is clean with easy access if coming from somewhere other than Mesa. I don't usually write reviews unless they are deserved!"}
{"text":"Husband was really craving feta cheese, so he ordered the Greek fries. The order was enough to feed 4 people and he said they were amazing! So, he ate the whole thing! I ordered a gyro, great cuts of meat, fresh tomatoes, spot on tzitski sauce, and warm yummy Pita. Great service,  super clean, and was served some pretty yummy baklava for free!"}
{"text":"I've hardly eaten Shawarma plates before where every single item on the plate was top notch. The rice, the meat, hummus, puts, even the salad was sooo fresh. It's a great restaurant. I do feel the baklava was not up to mark, I've eaten better baklavas elsewhere. But, keep up the great work you guys!!"}
{"text":"My best friend and I came here for lunch and the food came out so fast! The workers are so nice. Even gave us a sample of Bahklava and it was so good I bought more."}
{"text":"Mixed review here:  Gyro meat: 5.0 stars Hummus:   3.0 Baba Ghannouj: 3.0 Tabouli:         4.5 Greek Salad: 3.0 Gyro Sandwich: 4.0 stars Lentil Soup:       4.5  I will come back."}
{"text":"You know a restaurant is very good when they do the \"small\" things that improve the food and experience. Green Corner exemplifies that after enjoying my first meal there today. Simple order of Gyro plate Chicago style. First off, food was fabulous and the portion large. Gyros was excellent as were the fries, Pita bread and tzatziki sauce. They even gave me complimentary baklava.   Here are the small things that put this over the top. Not only do they have too notch Gyros meat but after slicing from the pit, they grill it up to create some wonderful crust. I also judge Greek food by tzatziki sauce and this place crushed it. You could see the finely diced cucumber in there and it was bright with fresh dill. Plus did I mention free baklava!!  When you get this type of effort you know you're dealing with people who care.   Only small item I would suggest changing is if you're going to do Chicago style, use white onion slices vs red onion. That's how they make it back home. We will be back!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh food healthy large portions. A must for the lunch list. Free tea sweet and unsweetened. And complementary delicious dessert. Gluten Free. Low Carb."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices. The staff are very nice as well. We almost always get the mixed shawarma plate and split it with and extra pita and baklava. It's definitely enough for two and the food is wonderful. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant that serves Shawarma. I think it is the best in AZ. They have nice place and friendly service."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice and gotten the vegatarian plate both times. It's close to my home so that's a plus. The staff is friendly and the food seems fresh. My boyfriend got the lamb and said it was just okay but I thought it was tasty, the meat was tender and well seasoned."}
{"text":"Congratulations to the new branch II and wish you all the best. We tried and tried the collection of food, we found good taste, cleanliness, care and good handling. With customers we hope this level remains upscale for this lovely restaurant We learned that Green Corner is the most authentic restaurant in Arizona and we recommend that customers try this place"}
{"text":"Just had dinner here for the first time and wow, what a treat! Great staff, very helpful. The food is awesome.  I had the chicken kabab with hummus, fries and baba ghanouj. My wife had the gyro plate and loved it. Then some baklava to top it off. We highly recommend GCR. See you again soon."}
{"text":"Delicious small Hummus with cucumbers and red tomatoes instead of pita bread.  Excellent food and price.  The homemade baklava is amazing. I'm bringing friends back here.  The small greek salad is wonderful too.  They may make a vegetable plate off the menu for vegetarians.  At lunch on Thursday, the restaurant was almost full. That's a good sign.  Baklava (/bklv/, /bklv/,[1] or /bklv/;[2] [bklv]) is a rich, sweet pastry made of layers of filo filled with chopped nuts and sweetened and held together with syrup or honey."}
{"text":"Ordered from here through postmates .. order was fast and food was amazingly good... too much for me to eat in one sitting ... so happy I choose this place"}
{"text":"I met two friends here for lunch and the three of us agreed that it is a true gem. I ordered hummus as an appetizer, and the portion was huge. Plenty of pita with the order, and it was delicious.  I had the chicken shawarma and it was very good.  Will definitely order again.  My teenage friend had never had lamb chops, so she decided to venture out of her comfort zone and order them.  She loved them!     My other friend is on s restricted diet so she had a salad and was quite satisfied.   Portions are large, food is very good, and prices are reasonable.   Our service was quite good as well."}
{"text":"Very best Mediterranean / Middle Eastern food!  I get the Chicken Kabab plate with Tabouleh and it is always make fresh and excellent!  Chicken is never over cooked and spiced just right.  The Tabouleh is also excellent with not too much Bulgur Wheat in it.  I also hear the Chicken Shawarma and Lamb dishes are excellent. I can't wait to try them all at this new location!  They don't skimp on the portions either, they are huge!  I highly recommend Green Corner if you like Mediterranean / Middle Eastern food!  It is the best around!!!"}
{"text":"Very good Lebanese food!  I get the Chicken Kabab plate with Tabouleh and it is always great.  Chicken never over cooked and spiced just right.  The Tabouleh is also excellent with not too much Bulgur Wheat in it (I don't like it when they do that!).  I also hear the Chicken Shawarma is excellent. They don't skimp on the portions either, they are huge!  I highly recommend Green Corner if you like Lebanese food!"}
{"text":"High quality meats, veggies and spices. Creamy hummus, great combination plates. Generous portions. Free baklava for dessert! We will be back soon."}
{"text":"I came with my family, gave 20% tip as I paid. Ordered a vegetarian plate which is simple to make and it was forgotten about completely. They also didn't give me the bread with it until I asked four times. Very poor service and the food wasn't all that impressive, just standard Mediterranean food without a huge menu. They did end up giving me a refund of the vegetarian plate in the end so they got two instead of one star. I'd not recommend going here.  There are much better places in the valley."}
{"text":"Wow!  I can't believe I didn't know about this place before!  Turns out it's right across the street from where I work too.   The baba ghannoug has a wonderful smoky  flavor from the roasting of the eggplant.  The texture is perfect - not too thin and still has pieces of eggplant also.    The stuffed grape leaves with tzatziki are amazing and the seasoning of the rice is delicious.    Thanks Green Corner - you have a new regular customer!"}
{"text":"Seriously the BEST Mediterranean food around!! I dream about their falafel when it's been too long since I've had it. EVERYTHING we've had is absolutely amazing from their Green Corner Platter, to the Chicago style gyro, to the chicken and beef schwarma, even the hummus, turmeric rice and fresh salad is to die for! You won't be disappointed to stumble upon this little hot spot! The owner and all employees are a pleasure to be around..oh and FREE baklava!! What!!"}
{"text":"Every single time I have been in here it has been amazing. Its always fresh. Portions are a great size. Hummus is the best I have had anywhere. I mean anywhere. Gyro is very good. Falafel is very fresh and crispy. The oil they fry in tasted very good with no after taste. They get the food out quick. I cant recommend this enough!!!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite Greek food that I have found so far.  Would definitely come back here again.  I ordered the gyro plate, which comes with rice, salad, hummus, and pita bread. They forgot to give me to Taziki's sauce, but I went back to ask for it, which is crucial and what I like as well.  The gyro was really good, juicy, moist, just overall good. Combined with the hummus and the tzatziki sauce, it was wonderful. Rice in the salad were both decent and works well with everything else.  Pricing was pretty good and I would say cheaper than other Greek places, was around $9 for a plate.  Came here after they open and it was already starting to get busy. But their service is pretty quick and they get the order out pretty fast as well. Although it was getting busy, there was always tables open and people were coming in and out. They also have an outdoor patio seating as well for good weather.  Parking is nice as they have a big parking lot. Inside is pretty clean as well.  So much other stuff to try out. Will need to come back in the future.  The free baklava at the end was also pretty good. Finish the whole thing.  PS. A ton of quantity, could not finish the entire plate, ate a second meal out of it. You may consider splitting a plate with somebody if you want to finish it on the spot."}
{"text":"Dropped in for dinner after reading a decent review in the AZ Republic and we weren't disappointed. This place is causal where you order at the counter, get a number, and the food is brought out to your table.  The staff was friendly and the food came out in within 10 minutes.  This place is closer to our home but won't take 1st place over HajiBaba.   The lamb kofta kebab and beef & chicken shawarma plates were delish.  Both plates came with a generous portion of flavorful & moist meat, tasty hummus, rice, and salad.  Other reviewers mentioned receiving a baklava as well, but that wasn't happening on the night we visited."}
{"text":"I have been to this place at least half a dozen times. I am never disappointed. I like ordering the chicken kabobs plate. It takes a little longer but it's yummy. My husband always gets the gyro combo. There food is so fresh and so plentiful. I have noticed the prices have gone slightly up but the food quality is still there. I wish these friendly business owners much continued success."}
{"text":"I'm honestly speechless. The food was incredible. There was so much of it and I couldn't stop eating so I left 5 lbs heavier and still had left overs.   I have dreams about the Greek Fries. They are crisped to perfection and tangier than Tang.   The people who work there are also cool. A+ service. I'm moving to the Mediterranean."}
{"text":"This is the best Mediterranean food I have had in a long time! The Baba Ganoush had chunks of roasted eggplant mixed in and was absolutely delicious.  The employees were very nice and even offered a free Baklava for my first visit."}
{"text":"Our work group came to Phoenix for a business trip and we wanted a quick lunch so we thought we would try that Green Corner Restaurant. They were very highly rated and the experience lived up to the reviews!   The six of us were stuffed and ordered a sampling of the menu. I had the Gyro, and others at the table had the salad, schwarma, and kebabs. All were exceptional and everyone was more than satisfied with the experience. One of our dishes came our a little late and they brought us complementary Bakliva at the end of the meal. Highly recommend to anyone in the are!!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Found this place while shopping and have been back 3 times. The food is fantastic and the help and owner even better. The gyro is second to none in Phoenix. If you want authentic Mediterranean Food this is the place."}
{"text":"Dis place be da bomb!!  The food is perfectly seasoned. The falafel (aka, Mediterranean hush puppies) is incredible. The tahini sauce, rather than being overpowering, is perfumed. The beef shawerma is tender and succulent then, for a sammy, it's wrapped in a thin, crispy bread. Even my soda -- a delicious Fanta Orange, in a bottomless cup -- was carbonated to perfection, i.e., throat-ripping refreshment. Do not pass Go. Do not collect $200. Head thee straight (or gayly forward!) to this fantastic joint."}
{"text":"The food is really delicious and the portions are huge. The service was great as well. They were quite busy when we visited but they kept checking on us every few minutes. They gave us complimentary baklava, which was delicious. The one thing that might not mean much to many, but a key for many Muslims is this place is Halal. Great to see more cuisine options in Chandler."}
{"text":"Ordered the green corner combo. 20 extra minutes of a wait. Ok, it will be fresh, right? Ugh, no. The rice was dry and hard, not what I expect from a Mediterranean style dish. The salad was so drenched in dressing that it was inedible. The lamb kofta and one falafel were good but the chicken and beef tasted exactly the same. I mean I couldn't tell which was beef or which was chicken. The pita served after having to request it was a flat bland as thin as a cracker. Pita is supposed to be fluffy. Did they forget to let it rise. The hubby ordered the gyro plate, he left the rice too. Yuk! The gyro meat was just ok. Nope, not again!"}
{"text":"A burst of flavors I had never  before in my mouth. I truly enjoyed the my meal. Even with the raw onion inside and the pickle, only one bite made those flavors pop out, to where all you taste was either onion and or pickle. Which is just too much. After that, it all works seamlessly together before and after that one bite."}
{"text":"I went in on a Monday and was the only one there. Based on the reviews I questioned if I was at the right place. Well I was. The service was quick, food fresh, and very tasty.   This place is a little gem and sort of hard to find if you're not looking for it in the strip mall. I'll be back when I'm back in town!"}
{"text":"I moved to Idaho and I really miss this place.  The food is great and they just give you a big ol' heap of food for the price.  It has a really unfortunate location, a lot of good places have failed.  The last restaurant was Oma's, a German place.  The food was good but the horrible location doomed her.  Hopefully Green Corner avoids this fate.  I've had multiple dishes there and everything was always great.  There's no way I could pick my favorite."}
{"text":"Best beef and chicken shawarma anyone could ever have. I went to Green Corner yesterday my husband and I ordered Al Sham beef and chicken combo plate with everything. The meat, spices, garlic and tahini sauce EVERYTHING was PERFECT , taste exactly like back home. I highly recommend this place for anyone who is craving  shawarma, you would feel like you are back home. Not to mention the service, we were seated and got our orders in no time, they checked on us and made sure everything was just like we want.  Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"I was in town with my mother to sign some documents. I looked up healthy restaurants in the area and couldn't decide what to eat. When I saw the ratings this place had, we had to give it a try.  The staff was friendly and eager to help you. We both ordered the mixed shawarma plate with all the fixings.  The food is out of this world. Everything is so fresh and seasoned beautifully. So much flavor in every bite.  If that was enough, the staff brought out complimentary baklava, which was also to die for.  We live 45 minutes from here but it looks like we will be making the trip up here because this food is the best I've ever had. A must try, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Ok my review is based on only one visit and I'd like to try it again the the future. I really wanted to give this place five stars based on all the other reviews but I couldn't. Maybe my expectations were too high. I had the gyro sandwich combo with fries.   Value = 5 My meal included drink and fries for under $10  Service = 5 I was promptly greeted and the staff was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable.  Cleanliness = 5 The restaurant was very clean and orderly.  Food = 3 My gyro was greasy and the meat was in small chunks instead of the longer strips cut from the cone. The tatziki was on the runny side and overly seasoned.  The fries were well cooked but not salted. I don't care for the style of fries they use.  Overall I'd return and recommend this place to people. They have a huge menu and other food coming out of the kitchen looked very good."}
{"text":"I had a Greek salad with gyro meat and my wife had the Greek salad with chicken shawarma. Both salads were excellent and both meats had lots of flavor. Portions were large and a great value for the $. I can see why others have given this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"I wanted to join the chorus and give this restaurant five stars - but the food didn't blow me away.  The meat was on the dry side, and the flavors didn't the same savory intensity that I have enjoyed at other Mediterranean eateries - or, more specifically, the halal food trucks in Philly :).  On the extreme plus side, though, they added complementary baklava to our order. Certainly a good meal, but perhaps a victim of its own Yelp-hype for me."}
{"text":"First timer but I'll definitely be back when I'm in town. I ordered the chicken kabob plate which comes with some of the best hummus I've ever had. The rice tastes fresh and isn't dry and they provide slices of pita bread to either make tiny little sandwiches or for dipping into the hummus. The tzatziki sauce isn't that great to be honest, it didn't have much flavor and tasted more like sour cream. Restaurant is tucked into a nice plaza in Mesa near MCC and there's a hookah lounge right next door. The staff is friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"The absolute best Mediterranean Cafe I've ever eaten at!  The fattosh Salad was huge and delicious!  I had the combo kabobs and the flavor from the chicken and lamb was surreal!    Mesa has a huge winner here...which is obvious by the 438 5 star reviews!  About to be 439!  I'll be back in 2 weeks!"}
{"text":"Best entire lamb and rice platter I have ever had in my life. I hosted for a party of 50 and we still had left over food. They make the best nuts, lamb and rice platter that melts in your mouth. Their salad and hummus is amazing too! Definitely the best lamb shank and rice I've had in Arizona!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Green Corner for the first time last night.  We saw the great reviews they got and I have to say they are all true.  The food was great and the baklava was amazing. I might just stop in for more of that when I want a snack! What I really appreciated was the service. Everyone was very friendly and I could tell that they cared that we had come in.  They even substituted menus items for me because one thing in the combo was not on my diet.  I will be going to Green Corner again."}
{"text":"I really love this place. It looks like a fast food joint but eats like a nice restaurant. The staff is incredible and the food is too. I haven't tried anything that I didn't like but recommend the beef shawarma and the chicken kabobs! Their rice is the bomb too! Great place for a lot of food at decent prices. On a final note... the Greek salad dressings is the best I've had."}
{"text":"Great hidden gem. Good food and the staff is very helpful with advice on what to try."}
{"text":"This place is amazing the food is always fresh and awesome price is very reasonable and your service well they're awesome it always pleasure to be there, and the FREE piece of baklava well that's a great added bonus!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place! You get so much delicious food for your money. They weren't very busy when I went in and this place deserves much more business. It's definitely worth eating at this place!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Great food and friendly staff. Don't leave without trying the baklava!"}
{"text":"I read the other reviews and decided to give it a try... I wasn't crazy about the food. The place wasn't neat and clean like everyone said. The tables outside were dirty and some even had bird poop caked on them. A real downer.   I"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food all around! I have not had a single thing here that I did not thoroughly enjoy. I think their hummus is top notch! My favorite treat for myself is definitely the Lamb Chop plate combo, finish the meal with one of their perfectly made baklava. My husband loves the gyro combo with fries. The gyro again is delicious, but there is no way we can pass up the fresh and delicious fries that they make here. Highly recommend! In fact, I think I need to swing by and order myself a plate of Al Sham chicken sandwich!"}
{"text":"With all the 5 star reviews and some from my favorite Yelpers, so I had to come try this place.  The place is in the middle of a large strip mall and can be missed.  It is locally owned and the staff is very very friend.  The place is very clean, slightly small dinning area.  I got the chicken shawerma plate (hummus, rice, and french fries).  I thought it came with pita bread or they forgot it?  The chicken was very flavorful!  The hummus, rice, and fries was very good too.  The amount of food was HUGE!  Can you actually share a plate so you have dessert.  This is a 4.5 star overall rating, because looking at the other pics they did forgot to give us pita bread."}
{"text":"This place is legit. Best Mediterranean food hands down. First off, everyone is so pleasant and helpful. You can tell they really care for their business and it's guests who come in. The food is beyond amazing and so fresh. You fill up quickly because they are over generous with their portions but you just keep eating it's that good! It's very clean and welcoming each time you walk in. My boyfriend and I can't get enough of this place!!! You will not be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"As soon as you walk into the restaurant the smell of grilled chicken captivates you and you become automatically hungry. The restaurant itself is very casual and great for a quick bite to eat. If you order kebabs or lamb chops it takes about 20 minutes, a little bit longer than other dishes due to the grill time. We ordered a chicken shawarma, Greek salad and alsham chicken sandwich wrap. The the portion sizes were decent, lots of meat in the sandwich and the shawarma plate. I thought the chicken was tender but wished it was slightly more flavorful. The hummus was creamy but a little too lemony for me. The Greek salad had a balsamic dressing that was a little on the sweeter side. They added complimentary baklava which was a nice touch. Overall it was definitely a good place to get a potentially healthy meal on the go, none of the dishes we tried were greasy. I will definitely return to try the kebabs."}
{"text":"I had the vegetarian plate and my husband had the green corner plate.  The beef was moist and the baba ghanoush was FANTASTIC.  There was lots of food and the prices were very reasonable.  We will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Everything was absolutely perfect, I was pleasantly surprised! I will be returning as often as i am able to! Delicious fresh food and awesome service and smiles from the staff, my new favorite Mediterranean food spot by a long shot."}
{"text":"Wooooow!!! I stopped in here last night with my girlfriend after searching for somewhere to eat and my god, we definitely made a great choice. This place was incredible!! I ordered the chicken shawarma with rice, salad, and hummus, she went with the kebobs..oh man were we excited when they brought our plates out. For how little we paid, they brought us out sooo much food. All beautifully laid out on the plates to, like it looked GOOD! Amazingly, it tasted even better than it looked. Seriously, without a doubt I'm coming here again, and again, and probably a few more times hahaha! It's that great. Not just the food too, but the service we received was terrific. They girls at the register were beyond nice, and they helped make some recommendations on what to order. On top of all of that, they even brought us two pieces of baklava which was so delicious and fluffy. I see why this place has such perfect reviews, they honestly try and definitely succeed in giving a warm, welcoming place with stellar food and wonderful service. 10/10, definitely coming back as soon as I can."}
{"text":"The service was very good, they gave free dessert,  the food was amazing (especially the Greek fries), and inside was very clean and cute! Loved everything!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place is soooooo good!! Fantastic Customer service and great food! I love coming in for dinner, the portions are huge and totally worth the money. Love coming here and enjoying their chicken kabob dinner. I opt for extra salad with no rice and it's perfect! Will keep coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I was surprised to find such a delicious Mediterranean restaurant so close to home that I had neglected to discover in the two years I've lived in the area. I ordered the beef kabob plate with rice and salad and my hubby ordered the chicken kabob plate.  The sauces that each plate came with were pungent and delicious.  I loved the dressing on the Greek salad as well.  You get a ton of food for a good price."}
{"text":"I found this delicious place thanks to Yelp! I don't live nearby but I will definitely be making the drive to get food here sometimes!  Went today and everything was delicious. Portions were huge, the place was clean, and service was fast AND friendly.   I got the mixed shwarma plate and it's enough food to be three meals or so for me. Yum.  Weird to point out, I'm sure, but the soda from the fountain was on point. I got a Dr. Pepper and it was definitely better than average. Love when that happens."}
{"text":"Me: Where the hell are we?  Craig: Start with that.   Me: Right. Green Corner. So I thought this place was good.   Craig: It was good.   Me: Great service, good prices, great portion sizes, and all-around decent food. Plus the staff are just super obliging: baklava on the house, careful about my allergies, etc.   Craig: Mexican coke--great feature. Crispy fries--bonus. Cock sauce on the table.   Me: Wait, what?  Craig: Also known as sriracha sauce.   Me: Ahh, weird. But the food, though good, didn't blow my mind. Good flavor, but not amazing.   Craig: Agreed. Perfectly fine, but nothing extraordinary. Now I have a good spot for Mediterranean food, but it's not something I have to have all the time.   Me: Yeah, not like that taco place. I have to have those.   Craig: Exactly.   Me: So 4 stars for the food, 5 stars for everything else?  Craig: Yes. Should we add what we ordered?  Me: Yep.   *We had the chicken shawarma and the gyro plate. Both good: good hummus, good rice, good meat, good salad, good fries, good baklava."}
{"text":"Amazing food! But the customer service in this place is over the top. The owner is very kind and everyone greets you with a smile. I'm definitely coming back to this place"}
{"text":"Best authentic Greek Food in the Mesa/Phoenix area!  I have eaten Greek food at many places, but this is as good as it gets.  Went there with people from work and they all agreed this is our new favorite lunch spot.  Prices are reasonable and the amount of food they give you; I have a 2nd meal for later there was so much.  Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"I stopped here, kind of on a fluke, just to see if all of the reviews were accurate. After being stationed in Turkey and Saudi Arabia, my thoughts of Middle Eastern food are very particular. After getting the chicken kebab plate, an order of falafel and an order of the stuffed grape leaves... I wish I could give it 10 stars!!!!! I also sampled the chicken shwarma, which I am extremely picky about the flavors and it is absolutely amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The palce is good and good service as well.The staff is polite and helpful.we ordered chicken shawarma .The rice was dry as well as the shawarma.However,they provided us the bakhlawa which was on the house btw,and it was the best I ever had."}
{"text":"I was skeptical of all of the 5 star reviews, but this place really deserves it. The food is delicious and you get a lot of food for your money. Is it the best Greek food I have ever eaten? If I'm honest, no. But it is pretty darn good and it is a serious bargain. The baclava is probably the most mediocre of the food there, but they give it for free with your meal. You will never catch me complaining about it and I will always eat free food and gladly give my patronage for it."}
{"text":"Wow! We went here because it had 5 stars with over 280 reviews. The people have spoken. The portion sizes are ginormous and the beef shawarma was amazing. Their hummus was absolutely amazing. The staff took care of us and we even were brought some baklava samples. Absolutely tasty dessert! I am not always a huge fan of Mediterranean food but I absolutely loved the food and I agree this place is a 5 star joint out here in Mesa. The salad dressing was great but I would do without the rice next time and perhaps get mine Chicago style with battered fries instead! Those looked delicious! I will definitely tell my co workers and friends about this place and come get some great tasting food!"}
{"text":"We dined at Green Corner this evening based on the very high Yelp ratings. We were very impressed with the delicious fresh food and the outstanding service. We had the chicken shwarma plate, gyro plate, falafel appetizer and baklava desert. The plates came with wonderfully fresh green salads with tomato, olive and feta, in addition to generous sides of hummus and baba ghanoush with pita. The restaurant and kitchen is very clean. The service is very friendly and attentive. We must say they have earned all their high ratings. We will return!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic! Big portion and very flavorful. We had the gyro plate Chicago style and the flavor is amazing! Come try and you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!! So full of flavour wish I live closer I'd done here OFTEN  I forget to take pictures food smell so good I woof it dont. New favorite spot KEEP UP GRRAT WORK AND AWESOME FOOD"}
{"text":"This restaurant is probably my fav! I go there at least twice a week! If you are in the area, definitely go in and try the kabobs!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to break the 5 star rating and wanted to throw off the average. BUT I CANT! IT IS GOOOOD. You get a lot of food for your money. And it tastes really great. It may shave a slight spice to the meat. But it is not too bad as my wife ate it and she does not even do pepper. Oh and too top it off, I got free baklava for my first time I am assuming. That or cause I said I was going to break the 5 star streak."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! Wow this food reminded me of the delicious shawerma and kabab we had in Jordan! Hummus, taboule, salad, the French fries, everything was WOW! Very authentic and flavorful!! The price is great! The service is amazing! Very nice and respectful people! We loved it! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We really love this restaurant! They always have the biggest portions and the freshest ingredients. Love that they always offer a free piece of baklava after every meal."}
{"text":"Amazing better then any others including Baiz which is one of my favorites , I enjoy this place and location"}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. Good price. I recommend enjoying a meal here.        Yelp won't post this because it is not a long enough review. It's a good restaurant, try it. Nobody wants to read a giant review."}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The best gyro meat I have ever eaten. My buddy told me about it and I drove from Chandler to come eat their food.     Their service was amazing and the manger \"Ash\" was Amazing.  It's great to go to a family business that truly cares.   It's a must visit place.  It's simple, clean and amazing culture of their staff.   Dave"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The girl who took our order was as sweet as the baklava (which is one of the best I've ever tasted, melts in your mouth) My girlfriend wasn't sure what she wanted and this young lady helped her through the menu. The portions are generous, the food is very fresh, and most importantly the entire experience lived up to...no surpassed the five star rating. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"This place was absolutely awesome! It's very close to mcc so me and my boyfriend came here this afternoon because we've seen it before and wanted to try it. The chicken shwarma and beef shwarma plates were fantastic. Only cost like 20 bucks for two giant meals and a drink. The workers were very friendly also."}
{"text":"The gyros here are fantastic! The customer service is always excellent and the atmosphere is very laid back. I would definitely recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"AMAZING Greek food at a great price. Large portions and the humans is some of the best I have ever had. Staff was also super friendly."}
{"text":"Love this place! Wish it was closer. Great service, felt family owned. Gyros were the best Ive had in a long time. Very authentic, highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots. The staff is always welcoming. I have tried a lot of the menu and have never been disappointed with anything. Portion sizes are very large and well worth the price. The decor and location is all a bit strange but doesn't impede on a great meal."}
{"text":"Very good service.  Very good food.  This place is great Mediterranean all around.  The atmosphere is in line with the price point, but the food is quite above."}
{"text":"I met my wife here for a mid week lunch date. They have a pretty large patio area and plenty of seating inside as well. The restaurant is clean and fresh. The two guys behind the counter were very nice, got on my order right away, and had it ready within a few minutes.   The portions are good sized and the food is tasty. If you're in the area, this place won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Wonderful find. Huge portions. Delicious food--- had the chicken schwarma plate. Friendly service.  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of Greek food, on two different coasts. This is by far the best gyro meat I have eaten. The staff is lovely, they are attentive and helpful. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been having Mediterranean vegetarian foods at various places in the US and Canada. This is one of the best I ever had. Highly recommend their falafel plate for vegetarians. Staffs are very friendly."}
{"text":"My wife and I are in town to see family for a long weekend and were craving something local, so we consulted The Yelp and found Green Corner Restaurant.  It was nearby, not expensive, and had very good reviews, so we headed there for dinner.  The location isn't anything amazing, but the outdoor seating looked inviting and was quite comfortable.  I ordered the chicken shwarma plate and my wife had the gyro special.  Both were excellent.  We've eaten gyros in at least 4 countries on two continents, and we agreed that we liked the gyro from Green Corner as much as anything we've tried anywhere else.  Served hot with warm, soft bread, juicy meat that was a perfect consistency, and the right mix of veggies and sauce.  Perfect!  The chicken shwarma plate was also very good; I especially liked the rice and hummus, and the salad was nicely balanced.  Two excellent meals for less than $20 - can't beat it!  We may skip one of the family meals and see if we can't get some cousins to join us for a trip back...:)"}
{"text":"Tasty food, great service, clean place, and always on time. I wish there is a location on the west side of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Seriously the best meal I have had in a longgg time. Their hummus and pita bread is to die for! I'm so content with the costumer service I got AND the food. Chicken was served very hot as well as the rice. I recommend the chicken shawarma plate and to keep the sides how they are. Hummus, rice, and salad! All so so good.... I will be back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, had the gyro sand which and the chicken shawarma plate. Service is wonderful, you walk up and order but they come and check on you multiple times once you have the food. If you're hungry for yummy Greek food this is the place to go. They even gave us a little baklava to finish off our meal, also amazing. Will definitely be coming back in the future!"}
{"text":"Best Schwarma around !!!! Always great food.  Their selection is really good and with your entree you get baklava.  I never liked hummus until I tried it here - now I have it every time.  My wife loves this place and raves of the hummus.  The staff is always polite.  Our \"go to\" place :-)"}
{"text":"Excellent food, good prices and great service! Recommended: chicken and beef shawarma! Expect lots of flavor, generous portions and a full tummy at the end."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I had the chicken plate, damn good!! You can sub out the rice for extra salad or extra hummus. The salad is fresh and the dressing is yummy! My husband got the beef kabobs and they are worth the 20 min wait, they make them fresh! Thought I couldn't eat another bite, then they brought over some baklava. Spoiler: turns out I could! Delish!! This is a new favorite !! Thanks for a great meal Green Corner!!"}
{"text":"Tabouleh doesn't have enough parsley and the tomatoes aren't juicy. Chicken shawarma is a bit dry. The falafel is right on point though!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing place! The food was spectacular, the service was amazing and the restaurant was immaculate."}
{"text":"YUM! I met up with fellow Yelper Karen W and I was excited to meet her and try a new restaurant together. It took me a bit to find it, as it is not close to the road but rather in the middle of the shopping complex. We came around noon on a weekday and we're lucky to get a table, it was busy with the lunch crowd.  I love that there is a \"Halal\" stamp on the cover of their menu, makes my decision easier. I went with the chicken shawerma sandwich and ordered a side of fries at the counter. Our food took about 10 minutes or so to come out and it was clearly made fresh to order. My sandwich was delicious, the bread used for the wrap was flaky and crispy and the chicken was marinated well (you can see it and the beef shawerma spinning grillers/the spit behind the counter when you order). The fries were surprisingly good, I just wanted more food but they were better than I thought.   ***Also how could I forget to mention the complimentary baklava, I took it home with me and had it a few days later, still tasted delectable! A hospitable touch for a restaurant that clearly values its customers and prides itself on their food and service.   Overall, great food at a great value. I'm so glad we came here and I hope to make it out more in the future."}
{"text":"I eat at this place at least once a week!  I have a usual order but everything I've tried here has been great!  Staff is always super friendly, hummus is awesome, I've never been dissatisfied, not once."}
{"text":"ATTENTION ALL MEDITERRANEAN FOOD FANS!! This place is amazing!!! My best friend is from Jordan, and his mom used to always cook up some awesome Arabic eats, and I went out to Jordan for a few weeks and had amazing food. I've been trying a bunch of spots here in the valley, AND THIS IS THE BEST REPRESENTATION OF HOW GOOD ARABIC FOOD IS AROUND!   I had the chicken shawarma plate and it's tons of food, the salad is bomb, the hummus is the best around, the chicken is delicious and even the rice is good!  The service is awesome, they are very quick and friendly there and will take good care of you.   I also had some baklava that was seriously amazing, and I can't wait to have more people with me so I can order a full on tray of k'naffah!  Seriously though, stop what you're doing and go here. Thank me later."}
{"text":"As a middle eastern person I will give this restaurant a 1000 stars not just 5, because the quality and the real taste of the Arabian cuisine. My best restaurant in Arizona not just tempe or messa. Clean restaurant and nice patio if you want to eat outside. Super friendly stuff and I like when the owner takes your order, that shows that he care a lot about his costumer and his restaurant. I don't know why there is few people give lower stars maybe they are not used to a middle eastern food....What a great experience for me . i wish they open another one in Tempe."}
{"text":"Great halal food, generous portions, very helpful and friendly staff. I've been twice so far and on my second visit I couldn't believe the cashier who had helped me the first time remembered me. It was very nice to be recognized and acknowledged and welcomed back in."}
{"text":"I still really love this place and have eaten here so many times both because I wanted to and at the request of my fiance.  The only bummer is they used to give you free baklava with your order - dine in or to go- but now it doesn't seem like they do that anymore.  It was a nice little added perk, but the food here will still keep us coming back."}
{"text":"A must have if you're looking for a healthy affordable meal! The staff is super friendly and attentive and they even give out free desert. Highly recommend and I'll definitely be coming back:)."}
{"text":"I love trying Greek food places! The chicken swawarma is absolutely to die for! The staff was so friendly and kind that I will definitely be back to try different items on the menu!"}
{"text":"This my favorite middle eastern place. They have an awesome and friendly service. You can never go wrong with anything in their menu, I have been there many times and never had a bad choice. My favorite dish their is the Al Sham chicken and Al Sham beef shawarma dish."}
{"text":"Usually this place is pretty good but the last few times they have screwed up my order. The last time they totally overlooked my order and kept me waiting for more than 30 mins. Food is good but the cooks seem to be arguing all the time and a little careless."}
{"text":"Food was good Greek food, the music was better than most places and up with the times. Everything was clean which is very important and staff knew exactly what they were doing and were very friendly.  I would absolutely recommend stopping in here if you like Greek food although it is more like fast food Greek with a dining twist."}
{"text":"The portions are large and the staff is nice. There was so much food that we didn't even need to order the extra meal for our 3 year old. My vegetarian meal and my husbands chicken were both excellent.  Each meal gets complimentary baklava, which is generous. That being said- this baklava is probably the worst I have Ever had. The bottom was Very soggy and there was not enough filling after the first few layers. If you are a fan of puff pastry though, you may enjoy it.  I will be back again, but will probably turn down the baklava."}
{"text":"Very yummy! First gyro meat I've ever had that was juicy and not dry! The flatbread/pita was warm and fresh! Hummus was delicious! Big portions, very friendly staff! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"If you think that all the 5-star reviews for this place are fake or paid for, let me assure you, they are not.  We love Mediterranean food. So we were super bummed when Sahara closed and the owners retired, because we went there nearly every month for their fantastic hummus. I despaired of finding a replacement close to my house. Because while Pita Jungle has nostalgia, it's hummus really doesn't make the grade.  This place has fantastic food and even better service. I don't think I've ever had a single complaint about the service. Not only that, I think they've actually impressed me every time with how nice and quick they are.  Competent staff and a clean restaurant is rare enough, but the food here really blows most other places out of the water. I've had nearly everything on the lunch menu, and it's amazing.  Their falafel is the best I've had, bar none. You should never settle for dry, tasteless falafel ever again since this place exists. They generously spice all their meats, and you can taste the cinnamon on the lamb. The hummus is properly creamy and savory, and comes with a very generous helping of pita to help you eat it. Also, their side salads are awesome. They put huge chunks of crisp, fresh vegetables in them and never over-dress the salads. Their house dressing is impressively tasty without being overpowering. I don't know what the technical term is for that garlic yogurt sauce, but they make it really awesome here. It's overpoweringly garlicky, just like it should be.  The portions are absolutely massive, especially if you order off the dinner menu. I can usually manage to stretch mine to three meals, and it still tastes fantastic when it's a couple of days old.  We eat here regularly, and will continue to do so for years in the future!"}
{"text":"First visit, tried the beef shawarma sandwich, so delicious, served wrapped in warm flatbread with pickles, sliced tomato, tahini sauce and red onion. Ordered the small size, plenty of food to satisfy. Also tried the baklava, very moist, sweet, delicious. Service was prompt and polite. Eat inside or outside. Clean, worth returning to, especially if you love Mediterranean food. Also went to the nearby Shamy bakery and market, few doors down from the Green Corner Restaurant. This is a small market stocked with middle eastern items for your pantry. They do have a food counter but didn't try it. 9"}
{"text":"Ordered the gyro combo, no distinctive flavors gyro and fries tasted the same, the cucumber yogurt sauce never stood out in the gyro sandwich.  Big portions, and reasonable prices....glad to have tried it but will be moving to the next gyro shop?"}
{"text":"This place is a pretty simple unassuming little spot but they deliver some pretty great tasting food. I followed the lead some of you gave and ordered chicken shawarma and my husband ordered the green corner combo. Both tasted great, fresh, and had generous portions. We took half home. I wanted to try their baklava so we ordered a couple of pieces near the end of our meal.  The woman at counter refused our money and said they were on the house.  Add to this they have sweet tea on tap.  All employees were kind, helpful, and busy organizing or cleaning when not assisting customers.  We visited on a Saturday afternoon so it was not crowded but still had several customers.  The prices are very reasonable considering the large portions. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We were looking for gluten free options near the Mesa Hilton for a lunch with our daughter-in-law and her friend both visiting from Colorado. We saw the Yelp reviews for Green Corner so decided to try it.  To start out, just so you know, the restaurant is an \"order & pay at the counter\" type and I'd give it only 3 stars for the outside seating because the chairs, although comfortable, don't quite put you aligned correctly with the table since you end up sitting too low. However, the food was quite good hence the 5-star rating.  Everyone enjoyed their selections and we had plenty left over to take home... including the free baklava. When I tried that the next day I was so impressed I knew I had to write a review. I typically don't even bother ordering baklava anymore because at most places it's so sticky and over-sweet its sickening. Theirs was so good I'd give it 10 stars for the baklava alone!"}
{"text":"Authentic delicious food, the employees were very welcoming and the baklava was so fresh, perfectly sweet and flaky."}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of Mediterranean food but we came here as a family for dinner and their hummus is fab! I had the chicken shawarma plate and their serving sizes are huge! So much food for an amazing price. And the food is just as amazing! Like I said, not a huge fan of Mediterranean food but my family said the gyro meat was some of the best they have had. Recommend getting it Chicago style for the fries, but you need to get hummus for sure"}
{"text":"Yelped were right. New Times and Arizona Republic was right. Green Corner is really good. You don't generally gush over salad dressing.  You are going to gush about the salad dressing, the velvet that is their hummus, the toasty warm pita, kabobs.  There's a gyro in my future with this place and most definitely more baklava.  Great work, spot on recipes and good vibe!"}
{"text":"Randomly saw this place and decided to check it out. Everyone was very nice and helpful. Chicken was very good and loved the seasoning. Prices were very reasonable for the amount of food. Employees were great and genuinely interested in what we thought of the food. Definitely will go again. I hope more people discover this place! I will be sure to spread the word."}
{"text":"Don't know why this place has only 4 1/2 stars , they should have 6 !!! Very warming when you walk in all the way til the courtesy baklava they give you on the way out ! Very legit, best Mediterranean I've had in awhile especially in Arizona don't go anywhere else but here !"}
{"text":"Went here for a quick bite after reading reviews. Had the chicken schwarma combo plate. The food was delicious and the portions were very generous. The staff were super kind and even brought out a free piece of baklava as I was finishing up my meal. Delicious hummus, nice chicken schwarma, really tasty salad. Rice was a titch over-seasoned, but really great place. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This restaurant is still very good. I come here and i always like the food. Al sham beef combo"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting too much from the initial look of the place, but holy cow was it amazing. Everything tasted so fresh, and the portions are so much more than what you pay. They got really busy while I was there, but to make up for having to wait for our extra pita the owner gave us free dessert. And let me tell you, the dessert was just as amazing as the rest of the food. I will absolutely be returning here, probably within the next couple of weeks."}
{"text":"Love this place! I'm generally not too much of a fan of Mediterranean food but this place is definitely a hidden gem! This is my boyfriend's favorite place so we will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"So much yum! I love Mediterranean food, and this place is definitely on my A list. The prices are very fair, and the portions are well suited for my burning hunger and muscular thighs. Protein!!"}
{"text":"Was not impressed with the food at all  after all the great reviews I could hardly wait to eat the green corner combo plate. The salad had to much dressing on it the chicken was dry and the lamb meat didn't have any savory flavor to it at all. To me everything tasted the same.  Yes it took at least 20 minutes to get the food and was happy to wait mainly because of the yelp reviews. I just thought everything on the plate tasted the same. I needed a more savory, more appetizing flavor."}
{"text":"My husband & I lived in Greece for 9 months & I LOVE this place!!! Amaziiing food (even if it's not the best vibe/ambiance) it's totally worth it for the tastebuds/food!!! Go here if you want authentic Mediterranean!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out last night.  Decor is decent. Food, serving size, and customer service is excellent!  Prices are good as well!  We'll probably come here more instead of Tasty Kabob since the food is better priced and service was quicker. :)"}
{"text":"Great food , clean facility , and nice service staff . The portions are large and the quality of the food was excellent . The chicken shawarma came with salad , hummus , rice and pita . Took half of it home and can't wait for the leftovers . :)"}
{"text":"If you come to Green Corner Restaurant you can expect delicious Mediterranean food accompanied by exceptional customer service. The food is made fresh and they offer a wide variety of entrees. Throughout our entire dine in experience the staff was extremely accommodating from friendly greetings to checking on us half way through our meal. What I like most about the people working here is that they anticipate your needs, which is rare nowadays. I came into this place for a quick lunch and ended up finding a gem of a restaurant that I will definitely come back to.  Food we ordered: Lamb Kifta- came with pita bread, hummus, rice, salad, grilled tomato and dipping sauce; the lamb was juicy and had great seasoning in it! The hummus was smooth and had a satisfying mellow taste that complimented everything on the plate.  Gyro Sandwich- the tzatziki sauce was refreshing and the gyro meat was tender and juicy.  Baklava- sweet with a little crunch and it's the perfect portion. They sell each triangle for only $1! Amazing!!"}
{"text":"When I thought I had already found a great Mediterranean food restaurant I found this place here on Yelp. They the best Mediterranean food I have had so far. I've ordered to go twice now and it's been great. Good portions at affordable prices. Love this place!!"}
{"text":"Wow. Great food, friendly staff, great prices and large servings.  Love this place after eating here over a dozen times now.  The guy working the register is always friendly.  I'll be going to this place for a long time."}
{"text":"If you are looking for competent food from the Eastern-Mediterranean in a gleaming American fast-food setting then you will like this place.  And it is likely one of the best alternatives for people that are in that neighborhood for the JUCO or hospital. I wouldn't hesitate to go back if found myself over there and needed a good quick lunch.  I find it hard to believe that anyone would rate it as one of the top 100 restaurants in the country given the nearby alternatives like Princess and Baiz. Their food offer a few more extra ingredients to suit their clientele. But they don't look like prototypes for a franchise chain. So some people might not feel comfortable visiting."}
{"text":"Great Greek food. I ordered Greek fries which were amazing with the flavor and feta. The entree's are pretty big so watch out for sizes. I ordered chicken Kebob and mix shawarma plates which were huge but with great Greek salad and amazing hummus. Great baklaya as well!   Probably recommend to try at least once if you are craving Greek.  Friendly staff, regular seating and good food."}
{"text":"Big portions, freshly made meals, speedy service and reasonable prices are the key selling points of Green Corner.   Had lunch here with the delightful Haneen O. We both had never tried out this place before but we excited to eat here based on the reviews. I decided to go veg for lunch and got the vegetarian combo which includes 3 falafel, baba ganoush, hummus, tabbouleh, grape leaves, and pita bread. It was a ton of food! It was also served to me seemingly in the blink of an eye it was that fast. My favorite part of the plate was the baba ganoush. It had a deep smoky flavor and had a more neutral taste vs. super acidic/lemony versions I've had at other restaurants. The hummus with smooth and well balanced, the tabbouleh fresh with a light lemon flavor, and the falafel had an intriguing flavor due to the incorporation of whole coriander in the filling.  As if my mountain of food weren't enough, they were nice enough to give us free baklava at our table. I was so full I ended up taking it home, but I thought it was really well executed when I finally ate it. The layers were crisp, buttery/flakey, and the filling wasn't too sweet.  The one major negative for me at least was that this small space doesn't get really good ventilation so it felt really warm to me when we were dining here. There was A/C but it didn't seem to be circulating throughout the whole restaurant well.  Overall it was a pleasant experience with great company. I'll be back!  EDIT: The owner messaged me saying they fixed their A/C system so there's cool circulating air to welcome you if you go there to eat now!"}
{"text":"These guys nailed it!  The service is excellent, the establishment appears spotlessly clean, and best of all, the food is outstanding.  I was talking to the manager the first time I was ever in here and was quite taken by him and his fellow staff's pride in their ability to prepare a quality product.  They even sent us home with samples of other items just out of kindness and such a belief in their food.  This is most definitely a place anyone should try!"}
{"text":"Good stuff, great portions. Smiley, happy service! I had the gyro plate and a piece of baklava. Comfy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Awesome place!!! Check it out!!! Love the place! I love their hummus and shawarma! Also, the people there are just very nice."}
{"text":"Just had lunch here. Ordered takeout the night before. Really tasty food. You get so much, the plates are huge. The staff was super friendly, the gall that greeted us was really respectful, and the young gentleman who wears glasses was extremely polite. I definitely recommend this place and will be back."}
{"text":"Wow that's good!  Juicy well seasoned meat. Great salad. Now here's the surprising part, good hummus, I hate hummus normally. Be prepared for a stuffing."}
{"text":"I got their green corner plate and chicken plate to go. The restaurant is clean and staff were very helpful. The food was very fresh an tasty. Their dessert was very yummy too. Overall, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Excellent! We are always searching for a new, local spot with awesome food. I wish we would have come here sooner! Portion size was excellent and all of the food was fresh and flavorful. The staff was very friendly and even brought us baklava for dessert. We will definitely be back and hopefully become regulars!"}
{"text":"This place is simply awesome. It was packed, and as soon as the food came out, I understood why... Best Med Food in the Valley!!! I had the chicken shawarma. Lots of food w a side of humus, salad and med rice. Everything was great, and customer service was outstanding   Even after the meal was served. At least three visits to our table to make sure our meal was great. After the meal, we received complimentary baklava.  A little too sweet for my taste, but the wife and kids love it. Thx"}
{"text":"This place is over the top awesome! They hit a home run from friendly and quick service, clean and new decor, and incredible food and portion size. For $10.99 I ordered the chicken and beef shawarma- it's served with Greek salad, basmati rice and hummus with pita bread. This could easily feed 2 people or be great for left overs!! To make it even better, they unexpectedly delivered a piece of baklava for dessert at no charge. Go check them out!!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Green Corner Comb, included beef, chicken and lamb kebabs.  My meat was over cooked.  Asked for some serano chilli peppers and they didn't have anything to spice up the dish.  The flavors were blan and the food was luke warm.  The pita bread had no flavor.  The worst part was waiting 20 minutes for the food. This restaurant lacks identity, it's branded as a Mediterranean restaurant but the flavors are bland."}
{"text":"Excellent Mediterranean food!  The chicken shawarma plate was huge!  The hummus is creamy, the falafel was crunchy and the rice was aromatic.  I will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"We found this place using google and we are so happy we did! The food was delicious and surprisingly light. You leave feeling great and not heavy at all even though they give you a TON of food. The saffron rice was so beautiful and great tasting. I think this was the quietest date we have ever had because the food was so good there was no time to talk! We will definitely be recommending this place and coming back again.   We ordered: Falafel appetizer (try it layered with the pickle and sauce) Chicken, beef, and lamb kebob plate  Chicago style Gyros plate"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying, order the Greek fries!   Clean restaurant, friendly/ attentive staff, and delicious food. I've been here three times so far and the service has been consistent. Great portions for what you pay for."}
{"text":"The best food and customer service around! The place really does live up to all the 5 star reviews it has earned! The owner/ manager and all of the staff are the sweetest. The quality and consistency of the food is what's most impressive! I work nearby so I eat there probably3- 4 times a month and I've NEVER had a bad experience!"}
{"text":"My dad and I came here because we were super hungry and wanted some quality food with large portions. Well, that is exactly what we got! The food was absolutely delicious and visibly fresh. I ordered the Green Corner Plate Combo and was pleased with the assortment of food on my plate. Flavorful, fresh, and a great value. What more could I ask for?! On top of that, the staff is so sweet and friendly. Definitely makes me want to come back for more!"}
{"text":"This is my go-to local Mediterranean/Middle Eastern eatery. The windows covered in advertisements of various menu items and the location next to several currently vacant storefronts may be slightly off-putting, but the staff is very friendly and the restaurant itself is well-kept.   I've tried the falafel sandwich, gyro sandwich, and the vegetarian plate, all of which were good. I especially like their stuffed grape leaves (dolmas). If you order one of their plates (which are an impressive amount of food), they are very flexible and allow you to substitute anything you don't want for something else. On top of all that, complementary baklava is served along with most orders!"}
{"text":"Very casual dining atmosphere... But exceptional service and some of the best Mediterranean food I've eaten. The customer service and food quality rivals many fine dining restaurants I've experienced.  Very friendly and helpful staff. Would recommend."}
{"text":"We were very happy with this restaurant!  My personal opinion the meat was a little over cooked.... but everyone else was very happy with everything!!  My husband is Middle eastern and this place was pretty close to the way he makes it!  (Different middle eastern countries use different spices etc.) I would recommend this place to anyone that loves ethnic foods! BYE THE WAY: They open at 10:30 or 11:00a NOT 5:00pm!! (In case it says differently as it had when we were going it said 5p-2:00a)"}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in Mesa. Maybe the whole valley. Great service everytime. Everyone always leaves happy and stuffed. Well done."}
{"text":"My husband was craving Mediterranean food and we wanted to come back to Green Corner because we remember it being good the last time we came here for dinner. Tonight we ordered the same thing: Mixed Schwarma Plate and the small Chicken Schwarma Wrap. The mixed plate came with beef and chicken schwarma, yellow rice, salad, a generous portion of hummus and a side of 3 pita breads. I took a bite and it was bomb. I even told my husband I was in food heaven. The chicken Schwarma Wrap was really really good too. I went up to order a slice of baklava and the staff was really sweet and told me they were going to give me and my husband two complimentary baklavas for dessert. This is definitely one of our favorite joints for dinner. Their food is consistent and tastes amazing every time and the service is friendly and quick. Glad they're doing well and are opening a second location in Chandler!"}
{"text":"Good middle eastern food. Friendly staff. Space inside the restaurant is a bit tight but doesn't deter from the great food. Thanks guy"}
{"text":"Service was fantastic. We were treated to free frys and dessert. The falafel was the best I've ever had. My chicken schwerma plate was excellently flavored. My boyfriend had the gyro plate, which he loved and I stole a few bites from. I will definitely come back. All in all, a great experience."}
{"text":"I will be back here again and again. You know it's good when you wake up the next morning and you start thinking about the food you had the day before. Before I even had my morning coffee I was in the refrigerator and had some of my leftover gyro meat and hummus and pita bread. Mmmmmmmm.  I had the hummus plate with gyro meat. OMG, the gyro meat was some of the best I've ever had. Perfectly seasoned and just melted in my mouth.  My husband got the kifta, which comes with rice, a Mediterranean salad and hummus and pita bread. The kifta was delicious and perfectly seasoned.  Portions are very generous and prices are inexpensive. Service was over the top. Everyone was very pleasant and helpful. I have to put a shout out to the person that took our order. His name was Ash(sp?), he said his uncle owns the restaurant. He made our visit there even more special. You just don't find employees like him that go above and beyond the way he did. He checked in on us several times while we were eating to make sure everything was okay and if we needed anything. He even gave us a sample of the baklava to try. :)  We will definitely be back again. Can't wait!!"}
{"text":"Excellent middle eastern food.  We were there on a Saturday and they were busy.  Kabobs cooked to order and were perfectly seasoned.  The lentil soup is excellent.  Servers were very friendly and helpful.  We will definitely return.  Prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday with my boyfriend. It is in a plaza with lots of parking and a Pokemon gym! We ordered the chicken entree plate and beef entree plate for $22. The customer service is super friendly and we didn't have to wait too long for it. The entree was generous so we had to ask for to-go boxes. The dishes come with pita bread which goes well with everything we ordered :) I personally like the chicken dish more than the beef, it was a bit crispy and not dry. The beef has a hint of flavor that I was unfamiliar with, but it wasn't bad but I prefer the chicken. Recommend eating here :)"}
{"text":"First time here and so many choices! I end up ordering the small Greek Salad (because I love Greek salad) with chicken. So flavorful, I just love the dressing. Glad I ordered the small because portions are huge. Staff are super friendly. You can either order to go and or eat in, if eating in, they serve the food to you while you wait at your table. Definitely will be back to try others in the menu. Had a little treat from the staff...BAKLAVA baby!!! It was O-Mazing! Thank you for a great experience I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall place. Food was tasty and the portions were large and reasonable. Its scary how creamy and amazing their hummus is. I would go back for sure."}
{"text":"First time Customer and I'm not impressed at all, I ordered the Chicago platter and my meat was in little cut pieces and the meat was dry and hard. Meat was not fresh at all. The place was empty and it was right after lunch time, not sure if I will be going back, I was really hoping the food was going to be good based off of the ratings and comments."}
{"text":"I like this place because its cheap and they offer large portions of food. The portion size does not take away from the quality of food. The chicken shwarma sandwich is my favorite menu item. The fries that come as part of the combo are homemade. meaning they are made on the spot. They are not processed and never greasy. The fries has this distinct fresh flavor to them and they are some of the best I had since."}
{"text":"Finally stopped by this place for lunch .. wow! Yummy and a huge portion!   I had the chicken kabobs, flavorful, big portion, rice was ok compared to the flavor of everything else.. the hummus was especially good with the pita bread, good salad (perfect amount of dressing)..  This could be split into two meals or ask for a Togo box..   Place was busy for 2:00 after the lunch crowd..   You can't see this place off the street, it's next to the Big Lots.. will definitely be back .. thanks yelpers for another good food find!"}
{"text":"I visited with my bf about 1pm today and had the biggest and best chicken shwarma plate ever! Everything included in the platter was flavorful and fresh: the greek salad, the chicken, the pita, the hummus, the delightful garlic sauce - all ahhhmazing! You get a lot of bang for your buck, which is pretty awesome. It was really great Mediterranean food in a nice and clean atmosphere. I generally only care enough to talk about the food, but I must say, everyone who worked there was really nice and had a smile on their face- probably because they know how amazing this food is and can make people so happy. The baklava was perfect and not too sweet. Bravo Green corner!"}
{"text":"So I had a bad experience here my first time simply because they had a big party and weren't manned for it and for their other customers. But I've come back several times and they are always friendly and helpful. The food is really good too"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mediterranean restaurants in the East Valley! This place is just as legit and authentic as the Mesa location."}
{"text":"Delish! Everyone is friendly, food is excellent!! A very generous portion for the cost. Go hungry."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Excellent price! Miss Heaven (yes that is her name) and her crew were outstanding. Great customer service."}
{"text":"In an area that is a Mecca for processed franchise places to eat the Green Corner is an oasis of halal food. Portions are large, the staff is friendly and the price is right. I had the Green Corner plate combo that is a variety of meats on kabobs served over rice with a fresh green salad on the side. At $12.95 the combo plate is an excellent value especially if you bring a big appetite. If you know Halal Guys, the Green Corner is a close match."}
{"text":"STOP LOOKING AT THE REVIEWS FOR EVERYWHERE ELSE & EAT HERE. THANK ME LATER.. (: Tried this place out with my mom because of the 5 stars it already had on YELP. Their staff is friendly, polite, & answered all of my questions. The establishment is clean. We weren't sure where to put our tray/dishes and the young man at the register kindly took them. The hummus had a bit more lemon juice than I'd like but it was still delicious! My mom even enjoyed it and she doesn't care for hummus. The beef gyro meat was full of flavor! I like that their meat is cooked on the rotisserie thingy.. Yes, I said thingy. I grew up in Germany where all the best gyro places cooked their meat this way. So glad to have found this gem in Mesa. Also, my mother lives 3 hours away and has decided we will be eating here every time she is in town.. This speaks volumes for me. Lol"}
{"text":"Excellent food and so much of it!  We tried the appetizer plater, yummy!  Gyro platter is excellent, the rice is so good. Lots of meat on the gyro.  The staff is great!  And we got free Baklava!  Great place!"}
{"text":"On a scale of 1 to belly dancer, I would say get your face veils ready. Portions are large. Had the combo plate. Beef was delightfully delightful."}
{"text":"Wow ! Five stars is not even enough. The food was so fresh and absolutely delicious. Even my son commented that the tomatoes were yummy. We had the gyro and the chicken kebabs. Both perfect.  We had to go there another time during our trip we liked it so much the first time. And it did not disappoint. Again, the food was absolutely perfect.   Now back in California, we are unable to find a place that comes even close :-("}
{"text":"If you want a food explosion of flavor in your mouth and don't want to spend much money, this is the business .  I prefer to get my meal to go with an extra side of humus and pita and I always get two meals from meals it.  If you don't know anything about Mediterranean/ middle eastern food, this place will get you hooked.  Quality food,  great price and friendly customer service, what more do you want. Check it out."}
{"text":"Another home run for Yelp. . .correction--another grand slam.  This is a small, unassuming place with non-descript decor that has absolutely knock out Mediterranean food.  It's got the general type of menu that you see at all of these spots (gyros, kabobs, etc.), but be prepared for intense, delicious flavor and LARGE portions.  Did I mention FREE BAKLAVA with your entree?  We had to take a minute looking for the place, but it was worth it--apart from the food, there are really friendly folks here and the joint has a nice atmosphere.  It's hard to maintain a five star average rating, but this place has amazing food, and you get a lot of it for a good price.  That's what does it.  If you didn't know about this place before, now you do.  GO there."}
{"text":"This place is truly a hidden gem. I have been craving Mediterranean food for so long and I'm so glad I came here for my fix! It's a little hole in the wall place in a strip mall but what it lacks in size it makes up for in flavor. I got the chicken Shwarma plate after asking the owner which was better... That or the gyros. He said the Shwarma. He wasn't lying. It was BURSTING with flavor. Some soft pieces, some crunchy. Amazinggg. Great garlic sauce and awesome, super creamy humus. The salad dressing was great too. Super good value for your money. The plate and a drink cost me about $11 and it was worth every penny! I'm stuffed and I normally don't ever feel full. He was a doll and even brought me out a baklava. I will DEFINITELY be back. I'm not a huge fan of Mesa... But I think Green Corner may have made me turn the corner about this city. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing."}
{"text":"We eat at Green Corner often. Their food is delicious and the staff very friendly and accommodating. Every time we bring people from out of town here, they insist on returning when they are back in town."}
{"text":"My new Favorite place!! My family and I went here for lunch on a Saturday. I found it on Yelp and had never seen so many excellent reviews. They absolutely deserve every one! The food is fresh and delicious! Our food came out fast, even though they were packed!! We will definitely be going back again and again!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the flavors. They were slammed when we arrived so our order took some time to review. I expect speed to get better as the crew gets more experience. I'll be back again."}
{"text":"The workers here are the best! They're so nice and friendly. The gyro doesn't disappoint. It's not salty, it's soft and flavorful. Rice is really fluffy. The hummus is better than most places. All reasonably priced. I'm going to have to come back and try some of their other plates because this one was beyond perfect."}
{"text":"It was okay, nothing special.. service is awesome. Foods is okay .. nothing to write home about, baklava is very weak. Service is outstanding but the food is fast food Mediterranean."}
{"text":"Amazing! So much amazing food for such a good price. Service was fantastic. We even got free desert! Definitely coming back. Very impressed. My group got a falafel plate and 2 gyro plates. Both amazing!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious! And the staff was so attentive! The lamb plate and gyro were both more than we could eat! Yummy baklava for dessert!"}
{"text":"Best chicken shawarma wrap, hummus and greek salad with gyro meat I've ever had!  I stopped in to this place the first week they opened, the owner was extremely nice and service was great and he had us try a couple of different items.  Everything was unbelievable, the hummus had incredible flavor and the shawarma wrap was incredible including the pita wrap itself.  I didn't want to eat the whole thing with all the food we had but I couldn't stop!  The greek salad was huge and everything was super fresh.  The whole restaurant was spotless as well so good job to the staff on that.  Great new restaurant and can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Woow!! What a find! This hidden gem is got amazing food with great friendly service ohh and did I mention the huge portions!  I definitely will be coming back and will recommend this place to everyone. Attached picture is the beef shawarma plate."}
{"text":"We were looking for a place with healthy eats, Green Corner was perfect! Everyone we've talked to there has been helpful, sincere and very friendly. Had the Chicken Shawarma Plate and it was delicious. My wife just ordered a small Greek salad and helped me with the chicken and the hummus. We still couldn't finish it all! Very reasonably priced. One of those places where I hope they charge enough because I really want them to stay in business and grow."}
{"text":"I used to work down the street from here. This place is awesome. The gyros come loaded with meat and are delicious. I usually order the Greek salad and gyro meat, they don't skimp on any of the portions. Love this place."}
{"text":"This is seriously our whole families favorite restaurant! They are so kind! And the food is far beyond anything else we have found here. We always get the gyro plate and add tabouli and falafel. I can't recommend them enough!!!"}
{"text":"I am so impressed with the consistency between your 2 locations. We got some food to go from the new Chandler spot and it was 100% as amazing as the Mesa one and I just kept saying \"it's overwhelming how good this food is.... I just can't stop eating it, it's beyond amazing\" ... And HOW do you make the meat so good? Because why can't anyone else make their meat that good?! It's whole other level. We've never ever had gyro meat so juicy and flavorful, not an ounce of dryness... And I added a greek salad with chicken to our usual gyro plate order today and when I opened the box I couldn't even believe how amazing it looked and how much chicken and toppings you include! Best greek salad I've ever had. GC continues to be our favorite joint in AZ! Congrats on another amazing location! You should be super proud of what your family has built, you filled such a void in the community and the service is always sooooo good, kind, and friendly and inviting. We just adore you all! Thank you again!"}
{"text":"For fast food, this is the place to go. The portions are almost too big. Everything we ordered was excellent. If you like mid-easteren cuisine, do not miss this restaurant."}
{"text":"First time leaving a review for a place, but the green corner is so good it'd be selfish not to share. Moved back to Arizona from Long Island NY recently. This place is the best Mediterranean food anywhere, not just Phoenix."}
{"text":"This place is GREAT! We found it on Yelp and came in due to a few good reviews and being close to my office. The service was great - very friendly and welcoming. The restaurant was clean and spacious. The food was FANTASTIC! Large portions, great flavors, and excellent prices!"}
{"text":"Their lamb chops are the best. I haven't had that good of lamb chops anywhere else in the  Phoenix area. Everyone's super friendly and the price is pretty reasonable compared to the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Love this place and you can eat here gluten free!  Always tastes fresh! Reasonably priced too."}
{"text":"Wow, just wow! This place was great. We had fattosh salad, lamb shank, pita and hummus, gryo plate, chicken shawarma and baklava. Everything was made fresh, hot and delicious. The lamb fell off the bone it was so tender. The baklava was the perfect amount of sweet.  I wasn't expecting much from the generic building front, but they surprised me with great food, service, and prices."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and excellent, clean environment. I wish these guys the very best."}
{"text":"We have a lot of Middle Eastern restaurants in Detroit.  And for the most part, they are excellent.  Yet, somehow Green Corner Restaurant has managed to edge them all out.  The baba ganoush was made with real egg plant and was nothing less than divine.  The hoummas, chicken and beef shwarmwa were seasoned fantastically.  I can readily see this place does not need my 5 star review as they have accumulated so many of them, but I am just compelled to write this place a 5 star review and tell you just what a wonderful experience and food quality that we had.  I whole heartedly recommend this place.  P.S.  My wife who said \"How many ways are there to make hoummas?\" sarcastically before we visited, ate her hoummas and her words.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Had a great lunch here. Greek salad with chicken added. They have a nice fully shaded outdoor area that catches the breeze. They gave us a free baklava for dessert  - super friendly staff."}
{"text":"I appreciate how accommodating they are with substitutions. I asked for no rice and extra salad on my mixed schwarma plate and then veggies instead of pita. Super nice and the food is delicious too!! They deserve the high rating."}
{"text":"I always wonder, is it really a 5 star place? Yes! This place is legit! Very good food. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Delicious.  The chicken shawerma and the baklava  is amazing.  Second time back in a week."}
{"text":"The food was really good and everyone that worked there was nice. Not a lot of tables and half of the empty ones were dirty. I got there shortly before noon on a Tuesday and definitely beat the lunch rush. Ordered the falafel plate and it was a generous amount of falafel, salad, rice, hummus and pita. Added a drink and total was $11ish. I wasn't blown away by the flavor but it was clean and fresh tasting for sure. Baklava sounded good too but there was one sad tiny piece in the case up front that looked like a reject from the day before so I skipped it. Willing to return and try more on the menu. Always enjoy a good lentil soup."}
{"text":"Used to love in a Greek village in Florida, and honestly, as good as I've ever had. Maybe the best."}
{"text":"Their food tasted just OK. I ordered the mix shawarma plate. There was barely any meat in the plate. So disappointed based on their star ratings."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their veggie plate is amazing & everyone who works here is so nice! My fav Mediterranean spot."}
{"text":"Amazing place amazing food.  This place is clean, staff is friendly, and they don't shy away from the amount of meat they give you.  My new favorite place."}
{"text":"Food in this place is great.I enjoy the food it's  fresh and clean.will keep going there"}
{"text":"Perfection. I cant stop thinking about the garlic sauce even days later. The food is so fresh and flavorful. Ash is the best and will make you feel at home every time you go. I cant get enough of this place .. its perfect and so inexpensive for the quality and the feast provided!! The best of the best in every way! I love it!! It doesnt matter what you get... youll be satisfied!!"}
{"text":"We had our Holiday party catered by Green Corner food was fresh, salad crisp and all delish!  We also were given free baklava.  Thank you Ash and team for a wonderful meal!"}
{"text":"They serve large portions when ordering the plated dinners. The food is very tasty.   The salad dressing was excellent    The food is Halal. Free baklava when eating in."}
{"text":"This place is a no brainer! You won't be disappointed with any menu option and the food is always fresh and delicious. The staff are great and the restaurant is always clean with plenty of seating indoor and outdoor. You'll never go wrong eating at green corner. I can always count on this place for a healthy meal!"}
{"text":"I love this spot. Friendly staff, amazing food, always fresh tasting. What's not to love about this place. I always hey there gyro. Full of flavors and tenderness. I decided to try something new gyro salad. The salad had a huge portion of the gyro, lots a yumi tomatoes and onion. What I was disappointed about what it berly had any feeta cheese and olives..the Greek dressing was delicious (best of ever had) aslo there tiziki sause. I think I'll stick with the Gyro's plate. That's the best thing that I have tryed so far."}
{"text":"So so so good.  Already craving it and can't wait to go back. I normally don't care for chicken shawarma.  Theirs is soooo good.  So much flavor and so juicy.  I got the sale that starts with  Flavash (spell) and added chicken shawarma because the dressing is so good.  My husband got a chicken shawarma plate and the chicken shawarma pita sandwich to go. Both were incredible.   The servings of the salads and plates are 2 meals.  So you can eat your lunch then take the rest home for dinner.   Tell your friends and post on social media.  Businesses hardly last in this area and we need to keep them busy.   This one did it right with amazing food to come back to but being that we work directly across the street and never saw it or knew about it until it was open for 7 months and I found it on Yelp and only came because of the great reviews, they need the word of mouth.   If anyone has anything negative to say about this place or any business. Be a responsible person and tell the manager directly. Bad reviews put businesses out of business (I personally won't try a place with enough bad reviews).   If your review is warranted for a bad review fine post it.   If you want to complain about something random then still give them 5 starts and provide your feedback direct or swillow it and save a local business."}
{"text":"Come here about once a week! Amazing food and service! Definitely one of my favorite Mediterranean places."}
{"text":"Authentic Mediterranean at its best. They even shared some free baklava on the House. Did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Five stars with 312 reviews, sounds inviting!  My friend recommended this place. It was our first time here. The prices are affordable and the portions are large! It took a photo compared to my hand.  We both ordered the chicken shawarma place. It came with rice, hummus, pita and salad with garlic sauce. All for $10.20 with tax.  We stopped in for lunch, didn't think we would be having an early dinner.   The employees were friendly and recommended the chicken shawarma and gyro plate.  They also gave us complimentary baklava, which was nice. I love my baklava.   They are located in a complex that doesn't have a lot going on and kinda of hidden. I wouldn't have found it, if it wasn't for Yelp. Stop in for some yummy food!"}
{"text":"The people here are super friendly. The strip mall that is located in is dark and a little bit gloomy but the restaurant is very simple. The people here really make it worth coming back to you.  The pros:    Greek salad, Gyro meat is excellent, hummus and takizi sauce is very good.  Rice is saffron and wonderful   The Bad:  Chicken Schwarma. Was really dry and unfortunately we had a chicken Schwarma a plate and ordered double meat.  My recommendation would be that they don't car too much chicken off of the spit at one time and leave it sitting and then cook it again in order.   We eat it quite often and the best in town is still Haji Baba. Schwarma is what you're looking for then I would probably skip this place only because it was so incredibly dry. Maybe we went on a bad night. We went on a Thursday at 7 PM."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place. Perfect lunch spot. Large plates. Good prices. Amazing baklava!"}
{"text":"Bomb food! Amazing service! I ordered the chicken schwarma plate and it was a huge order but so delish I couldn't stop eating! The pita bread they served was warm and super yummy! The staff is also very friendly and kind! Made us feel very welcomed!"}
{"text":"Very new location with excellent portions! I ordered the beef schwarma plate (served with rice/greek salad/hummus/pita) great price for it and took home some for leftovers.  The crew that I was with ordered greek fries, falafel plates, gyro pitas. They just opened so service is extra peppy and attentive.   Good lunch spot, looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Smooth and creamy hummus with delicious chicken, clean and inviting atmosphere combined with a friendly staff. What more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"4th time here and I am impressed with this place. Very clean. Portions are big and price compared to similar places is fairly cheap. The gentleman upfront is patient and friendly. I've had the shwarma, hummus, lamb, baklava, fries, and grape leaves are all excellent. Can't wait to try everything else!"}
{"text":"Definitely the best Mediterranean restaurant in Chandler. The portions are huge and you get free baklava with your meal."}
{"text":"Very very good. Went here for lunch and service was great. Food came out fast. Perfect for a work lunch. Large portions. I ordered the combo shawarma plate. It came with salad, rice, and hummus. The dressing on the salad was super delicious. Hummus was creamy. Everything was so good."}
{"text":"Amazing find!!! Reasonable prices for lots of flavor. Fries are cooked nice and crispy to perfection. Gyro meat was moist, tasty and well seasoned. Kabobs were well marinated an cooked perfectly. The staff was friendly and courteous. Complementary baklava, amazing flavor and crisp to it.  Will definitely come back for more, worth the 40 minute drive for sure. We had the Chicago gyro plate and the green corner combo, tons of food, definitely a big enough portion to share or just as left overs for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"So a few weeks ago I stopped in here with a friend for dinner and proceeded to post a 3-Star review. Management immediately reached out to me apologizing for the experience I had and wanted to invite me back to gain my trust and show how good they really are. First off, I find that highly commendable and second it speaks volumes to the character of the company; this is how you get and keep customers for life. I came in the following weekend for dinner and spoke with the manager; we talked about what happened and he asked me what I would like to have. I chose the mixed shawarma plate with a side of gyro. The food came out promptly and I was shocked at the portion size of the meal - my first visit I had the gyro so I was unaware of what I was getting myself into. Two types of meat (beef and chicken shawarma), a massive helping of hummus with two full pita breads, rice, and a Greek salad was overflowing the plate. Than a huge plate of gyro shavings and some tzatziki sauce - which I have to say is probably the best I have ever tasted. The amount of food I got lasted me three meals over the weekend. The flavors are really good, too. I enjoyed the seasoning on the meats, the freshness of the salad, and the overall presentation was excellent. This restaurant has gained my business and I will be back."}
{"text":"I was in Gilbert for the week visiting from San Diego. I checked yelp for some 5 star rating restaurants that were in the neighborhood (my hubby and I like to do this when we travel) The Green Corner came up with 5 stars so I decided to give it a try.  Being raised in San Diego, you are exposed to many diverse restaurants. Mediterranean/Greek is what I grew up eating and absolutely love it today!  I went in with high expectations from all the Yelp reviews. And let me tell you, they did NOT let me down! It all was fabulous!! Including the service.  I ordered the chicken and beef shawarma plate, delicious!! The freshness and quality shined through. The salad dressing, garlic spread and hummus were a delight! My 5 year old had the gyros and loved it.  And they save the best for last... the baklava!! Incredible! (Buy a few extra pieces, you'll want it)  Next time I am in Phoenix, I will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"The food is great, delicious, clean and healthy. The owner is super nice and he cooks himself. They are very courteous and the place was clean. We have been multiple times and we will go again. It is affordable, healthy, and delicious eating."}
{"text":"The food here was AMAZING! You can literally taste the freshness in the food. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant if you are looking for fresh and healthy Mediterranean food. This is my new Sunday lunch spot."}
{"text":"Love this place! Service is fast, everyone is extremely friendly, and the food is delicious - not to mention massive, portion wise. I've tried the chicken shawarma, lamb kabob, and falafel entree plates. All three were amazing. The entrees have three sides (salad, hummus with pita, and rice), and they serve a slice of baklava with every meal. Prices are reasonable, and the place is clean. Oh, and it was named #85 on Yelp's Top 100 Restaurants of 2018 list!"}
{"text":"Looking for fresh, interesting food. Wanted something convenient. Found it! Nice casual spot with friendly staff. They asked if it was our first visit, then comped us the baklava. The lamb kebab was terrific with interesting seasoning perfectly balanced. Loved the rice and salad. Generous portion made plenty for my next meal too. Then had the baklava. It is perfect! Just sweet enough with crisp buttery layers. Will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean food in Phoenix, really love their beef shawerma. Don't forget their amazing falafel. Wonderful staff and management. Literally the best :-)"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good. I think the gyro meat is some of the better I have had. Nice location, clean place. It is great bang for buck. I got the gyro platter, which was about $10, and it was absolutely enough for 2 people."}
{"text":"This place deserves the five star rating. If you are looking for good middle eastern food, you will not be disappointed here, at all. Also the gyro are thick cut which is how  it should be!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!! Wonderful place for middle eastern food, the taste is delicious and the workers are all kind. I always come here when I'm craving \"Home food\". It tastes like Home and feels like you're sitting in someone's house being served their food. It doesn't have that \"restaurant mass production\" taste. Definitely love this place!!"}
{"text":"Just added another 5 star review to the already 369 reviews...   This place is delicious with good portion sizes and prices. You can't go wrong with the gyro or chicken and the salads are very fresh! I've only visited once but can't wait to go again because it exceeded my expectations."}
{"text":"I ordered from Green Corner through yelp because of all the great reviews I read on here. However, once I opened my salad, it wasn't what I was excepting at all. First, I had \"special instruction\" of no olives, there were olives. Okay human error. Then I was surprised it didn't come with pita bread. All the places I've gone include pita bread. Lastly, I ordered my salad with chicken and I did not like the taste of it which in the end ruined the salad. I was not pleased at all with my order."}
{"text":"Excellent food, huge portions and the staff was really nice. They even gave me dessert on the house. I would come back again."}
{"text":"My family ordered a chicken Greek salad which was alright. The chicken was a bit dry. Also ordered a platter with gyro because they sold out of beef and some other things. The owner was really friendly and we will definitely be back to revise the review."}
{"text":"Wow!!! It really deserves the 5 stars. Good food at great prices and good portions. Definitely I will be back !!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Sorry I have no photos, I will post them when I definitely come back again. We had the chicken shawarma plate and some baklava. The chicken shawarma was great! Rice, hummus, salad, everything that came with it was very good. The baklava...was amazing!   I've had a lot of baklava, but after having theirs I feel like I'm actually tasting it as it should be for the first time. (This coming from someone who has no personal experience, culturally, with it...still) hard to explain...you just need to come hear and taste their delicious food and their amazing baklava! You guys rock! We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Yes!  Drove all the way across town to eat here and it didn't disappoint. It was FABULOUS!  The spot is shiny clean and the staff welcoming. We even got a free dessert. My friend and I both had the Chicken Shawarma plate and it was adorned with creamy hummus, a veggie filled salad, some yellow rice and delectable Chicken Shawarma. The Chicken was perfectly spiced and caramelized. Everything about this lunch was perfect. My only suggestion is that the Pita Bread was more crispy than tender. But a small thing in relation to a tasty lunch!"}
{"text":"With all the yelpers review, I had to check it out...I was very impressed with the food. Since then I've been back with the family numerous time. So far everything we've tried (chicken and beef shish kabob, shawarma and gyros) we're all good but the Greek salad and the hummus are my favorite and the baklava are to die for."}
{"text":"I highly recommend trying this place! I have gone multiple times and loved it. The food is very good and the people working there are extremely nice! The best Mediterranean food I have had in a long time."}
{"text":"We ordered the Gyros Plate - delicious! Hummus was tasty and the pita bread was fresh. Meat was great tasting and the staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"Had a delicious al sham chicken sandwich combo.  So much food I barely could walk out.  My wife had a beef and chicken shawarma plate which was also excellent.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best gyro and shwarma we have had in AZ!  Reasonable prices and excellent service. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service. VERY filling huge portions. Free refills on drinks. Friendly staff. Daily specials. Great for taking someone out to lunch. Not the easiest to find so I called. They are next to Dollar Tree. Happy to answer all questions."}
{"text":"Yes, it's that good!  Clean, casual place.  You order your food at the counter and they bring it to you.  The outside patio is nice, and there are screens if needed.  We ordered almost all of the appetizers, and they were all delicious.  The felafel was crispy/not greasy, the grape leaves nicely spiced.  Baba Ganoush was deep and smoky, and hummus was fresh.  The lentil soup came with pita croutons.  Home run!  Complimentary baklava came at the end of the meal."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in a strip mall with the most delicious food and best service. We LOVE this place."}
{"text":"Went to their  soft opening today (opening fully on Monday) and really loved it....since I lived a good few years in the Middle East... they come pretty close to the food I have eaten there....:ordered Chicken Shawerma since they had limited menu.... but it was tasty /delicious and the service was amazing... gave us some Baklava on the house and it was very nice of them and was delicious ... since we live close by, might just be our favorite go to Middle Eastern Food... keep it up guys and best of luck. Really love the place"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews online, some friends and I decided to check this place out. We ordered the Gyro combo which comes with fries and a drink for around $7-$8, and a large portion of hummus.  The service was so great, everyone from the cashier to the cook.  They were smiling and very pleasant to talk with.  Our hummus came out first and \"oh my good gravy\", it was fantastic.  The zesty lemon flavor along with the oil and spices that surrounded the chickpeas were wonderfully complimentary to the pita bread (which was refilled upon our request).  Our Gyro combos were quickly delivered to our table, each perfectly made with a special request (no tomatoes, extra sauce, etc.). Everything from the complex ingredients in the gyro to the lightly crisped french fries tasted excellent.  I gotta say, I've been to a few Gyro joints in the area and they truly do not compare.  The amazing portions, the robust flavors, and the personal customer focus are more than enough of a reason to make this place a go-to for fast, friendly, and delightful food.  (Side note: Thank you for the delicious baklava that was brought at the end of our meal)"}
{"text":"Definitely go if your into gyro. The Chicago style is platter is what I had. Fries where cooked to perfection and the gyro on top was plentiful, moist, and flavorful.  Everyone who worked there was very nice.  I come back the next I'm in the area."}
{"text":"So excited that this restaurant chain is expanding this is one of our favorite places in Mesa  so super happy they have another even closer location in Chandler. Amazing food, great service, and very friendly people."}
{"text":"Twice in 2 days this place is amazing. I love a good gyro and this place has one of the best I have ever had. And the baklava is amazing!!!!!!!! The staff is very friendly and willing to chat."}
{"text":"This place was sooo yummy! I got the falafel wrap and it was something else. Being able to actually get a bite of falafel each time and the flavor was fantastic! Customer service was also great! Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Absolutely incredible food. Staff was so friendly and they even brought by complimentary baklava --so thoughtful! The Greek feta fries were amazing, and the platters were so delicious. Wish we lived closer, we would be back all the time!"}
{"text":"We ate here a while ago but remembered how good it was so when we wanted to cater an event with Arabic food we made a phone call.  I worked with Ash on the phone who was extremely helpful.  I placed an order, confirmed a few days before the event and paid. I had a friend pick up for me. Everything was ready and delicious.  I would definitely recommend them for a meal out or to cater your party."}
{"text":"I came across Green Corner when was looking for a place to eat before a meeting and Yelp showed me this 5 solid star take out place.  They gave me chicken and beef shwarmna to taste but both were too dry for me to wanna order.  Flavor was very good though.  I really had my heart set on the lamb shank I saw on the online menu, but upon arriving, they said they only serve lamb shank on Fridays.  The manager, named Ash, nephew of the owner, is very personable and I give him 5 stars for service!  When I checked email receipt, it defaulted to the checked \"I agree to receive promotional offers from....\" and I was unable to UNcheck it in ti,e.  So Ash called the company and got them to remove me from receiving \"the junk\".  He also got me online using their free WiFi, so here I am telling you about my experience.  I ordered the combo kabab plate, but I found all items also \"two dry\", especially the chicken kabab.  Chicken was sooooo hard and dry, it was burnt black in many places.    When Ash came to ask me how my food was, i showed him how dry the chicken kabobs were, by pressing on the meat, and it was mostly charred black.  He told me that he has to cook it that way because it is \"chicken\".  I sorta understood and did not mention that I had read the review in the \"Not recommended section\" that these people wrote, how sick they got eating the food here.  But instead I told Ash, that the best kabab chicken I ever had was at Kyber Halal, moist, tender and yet has charbroiled taste.  But Ash never heard of Kyber Halal (at SW corner of Indian School and 24th Street, Phx).  I never order chicken when I go out, soley because of \"too dry and hard\".  Few restaurants can cook white meat otherwise, and Kyber Halal is one.  Scottsdale Conference center is another.  Indeed the New Times Review of Green Corner, framed on the wall says Green Corner's chicken is dry, and even says the same thing I do \"which is hard and dry chicken seems to be ubiquitous and usual\".    I give 3 stars for the food I ate, and 5 stars for the service I got from Ash, so overall 4 stars.  I will give this place another chance, and when I come again, I will have the lamb chops.  Seeing my MeetUp post, another eating buddy came here by himself.  He had chicken shawarma sandwich which he loved, and says he was coming back the next day.  I think he is eating there several times a week, now."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great meats and baklava that is light and flaky and holds together. Just perfect!  My favorite is the deluxe hummus plate. You get to choose the meat on it and comes with pita for just $7.50. I get a side of lentil soup or falafel if I'm really hungry. Everything has been delicious I've had here!"}
{"text":"Really good food and great portion sizes, customer service is super friendly, restaurant was really clean and maintained. Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Our favorite go to restaurant on a Sunday afternoon. Little place with some outdoor seating and indoors feel clean and less frequented. I've ordered the chicken shawarma plate and wrap a few times and it has always been fresh tasting and great! The rice has a nice cinnamon flavor to it, meat is flavorful and garlic sauce+hummus are great. My husband is a big fan of their fresh Baklavas and even took 10 baklavas to go after lunch today!  Portion sizes are easily for a meal+ to go. So try and share a full meal if you're heading here!"}
{"text":"Beware if you eat here once you will most definitely eat here multiple times after that. Every time I've gone they've been busy. I've gotten their gyro sandwich and hummus deluxe. Both are fantabulous."}
{"text":"RECOMMEND 1000%. This is the best place to come! Whether you're moderately hungry or very, they have a great menu to choose from. The staff is VERY friendly, it feels like you walk into a HOME not just any business. They call you by name by your second visit and are extremely nice -always! Not to mention the speed of service. This place needs to make it huge, they deserve it!!! Great job to the Green Corner Restaurant team."}
{"text":"Delicious mixed schwarma plate! I get it every time. The flavors exceed Haji Baba's own, and the customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"I've eating here weekly since finding the restaurant months ago. I bring friends and family and always have the same response when I asked what they think of the food. Words like incredible, amazing, delicious. Every time. Friendly staff that always makes genuine conversation, too."}
{"text":"Good food.  Had the gyro with fries.  They serve their gyro in a slightly different presentation than other places...biggest thing was the addition of thinly sliced pickles.  Food came out HOT...like almost too HOT to pick up.  Recommend caution."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I were looking for a healthy,  inexpensive place for a birthday lunch,  and boy did we find it.  This place is simple,  but clean.  The customer service is excellent,  and the food was delicious.  Such a great value for the price!   There are a few of us who frequent George's Gyros near downtown Mesa,  and they said it was comparable or better.    Between us,  we had the chicken shawarma (entree and sandwich), gyros,  hummus,  and Greek salad.  Everyone loved what they got,  there were no unsatisfied customers!   A little taste of baklava for dessert....  The best I've ever had.  Not too sweet,  not sticky or messy, just perfectly light and delicious!   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Clean and great value with the portions.  Thank you fellow Yelp reviewers.   I enjoyed the Gyro plate!  Wonderful flavored and very tasty humus!   I came for dinner but I think it would be a super lunch spot!  Cheers !"}
{"text":"This will be a welcome addition to the area.  If they had table service and beer and wine I would rate it a 5.  Like many newer casual restaurants opening today, you place your order at a counter and they bring it to you.  I had the chicken shawarma plate which was excellent.  The portions were large but the taste of everything on the plate was really good.  The plate consists of the delicious chicken, rice, a Greek salad and fantastic humus.  There is more than enough to share.  The staff was attentive and friendly. The dining area is attractive. If they maintain the standards I experienced today, they will be a big success."}
