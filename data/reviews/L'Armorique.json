{"text":"I went there on a nice afternoon with my mum and my dog they gave her some water since it was hot out. The table was nice. They seem to have a great menu too, but i only had a crepe which was plenty.

I had the crepe bono which is a chocolate and strawberry crepe, it is quite big for a dessert crepe. My mum had the chese and bacon crepe it was very good, not to salty keeping in mind that it is bacon. 

The waiters were really nice and the service was average 10-15 minutes. A crepe is quite expensive, mine was 11$, but everything here in St-Sauveur is expensive. 

All in all, it is a good restaurant. I will go back and i might try other things then crepes."}
{"text":"Question qualité de l'assiette : c'est plutôt bon. La fondue au fromage est vraiment bonne, le pain et l'assiette de légumes servis avec sont de bonne qualité également, on s'est régalés.

En dessert, les profiteroles étaient pas mal, le chou un peu sec mais la glace, la sauce au chocolat et la crème fouettée très bien. C'est très copieux et bien que les prix soient assez élevés, je trouve qu'on en a pour son argent.

Question service par contre... c'est vraiment très mauvais. Je comprend que ce soit difficile de servir un restaurant plein un samedi soir, mais ca ne justifie pas cette attitude. En dehors du fait que c'est désagréable d'avoir quelqu'un qui passe en courant non-stop à coté de votre table toute la soirée, ne rendez pas les clients responsables de vos difficultés !

Pas un sourire, pas un mot aimable et une serveuse qui passe son temps à se plaindre auprès des clients. J'ai eu le droit à un commentaire exaspéré parce que j'ai mis plus de 2 secondes à sortir ma carte de crédit au moment de payer... Nous avons attendu nos plats longtemps sans nous plaindre, c'est assez déplacé de nous reprocher notre lenteur pour simplement quelques secondes.

Pas sûr d'avoir envie de revenir si l'occasion se présente... Il y a probablement mieux ailleurs à Saint Sauveur."}
{"text":"1. C'est dispendieux par rapport à la qualité.
2. C'est dispendieux par rapport à la portion de l'assiette.
3. Ce n'est pas appétissant par rapport à la fraicheur des ingrédients.
4. Le service n'est pas leurs points forts."}
{"text":"We were doing a day trip through the mountains and stopped to walk around Saint Sauveur. We were hungry and L'Armorique looked good. We had a savory crepe which was solid but nothing special. The French onion soup was average."}
{"text":"Okey dokey. This place is a standard stop during our trips to St-Sauveur. The service is ok, not great, but not bad. The food is also pretty good. I've dug deep into crepes in France, and this place stacks up. They're not very accommodating about modifications to the menu items. There's nothing that \"stands out\" as a must-have, but I think the food is alright.

One thing is that they seem a bit disorganized. This is tied up with the spotty service, but in general it's got a feeling of confusion about it."}
{"text":"I feel like I'm in the twilight zone!

I read the reviews going here and was VERY worried! My wife wanted to try it and so I went hesitantly.

This place was INCREDIBLE!

Food was great, ambience was phenomenal, service was impeccable, and location unbeatable.

With your food (which you get a ton of) they bring fresh squeezed juice shots, a bowl of fruit, homemade jam, and fresh maple syrup.

They may have changed since the other reviewers but I find this place unreal.

HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"We used to come here almost every weekend in the winter. this place went downhill, service was the worst we ever had, food was served cold, our plates was removed before we finished our food. What a disappointment! We will never come back!"}
{"text":"Very ordinary but it's a historic house at the corner of the main and the Church. The ladies had the Chinese fondue and the guys the crepes au gratin. 

The fondue liquid was lukewarm and even with the little heating candle underneath the po, it never brought the broth to boil. Meat was scarce and there was about 4 regular sized shrimps. Ladies weren't impressed.

The crepes were very hot having been in the oven to melt the cheese. The white béchamel sauce was average, a bit on the salty side. I had the ratatouille crepe and I liked it, but also on the salty side. What's with these cooks? The plates were quite small for a main course dish. Guys weren't impressed either.

The waiter was doing his best to keep everyone happy on that hot Sunday evening.

All in all, I wanted to eat a crepe, I did and I'll go somewhere else now. This restaurant's attraction is the deck and the view, not the food."}
{"text":"After sitting down and looking at the reviews at this place I got worried. But it was not as bad as it looked. The food was actually 4 stars, service a little slow but still OK. What bothered me was that this is a tourist area and no effort was done to be spoken to in English. In fact there was nothing in the whole town english. How the ^%$#@ do they expect to attract customers from anywhere. This is typical Quebec thinking. Just being in france that was not the case. I spoke French they replied english.
Anyway back to the food. 
Raclette was great and so was my onion soup. The house was stunning and famous from what I understand. 
Would I go back?? maybe"}
