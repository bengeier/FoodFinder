{"text":"Had takeout for the first time here today.  The chicken is SO GOOD. Tender and moist, the rice and potatoes were good as well.  Pretty cheap, next time I want to try the ribs and other sides they have! It was busy so they obviously have returning business."}
{"text":"Farol has a take out place that I will go anytime. Been coming here for many years and have never been disappointed. Service is fast and stay very helpful to the point they offer to help you carry food to your car because containers are very hot, fresh from the frill,  Ordered two grille cut up chicken, potatoes, stir fried veggies, rice and the shrimps. Order came to $45 and satisfied 7 people and one vegetarian. Will not go anywhere for churrasqueia. Also ordered veal escaloppini from Bairrada with mushrooms and gravy. One of the best dish. Total cost for a great and wonderful dinner - $67 including tax that fed 8. How can you go wrong! Kudod to Farol, will be back many times.  Staff absolutely great!"}
{"text":"This place is right by my house, and you get your money's worth when you come here. The chicken was juicy to me however I found that the spicy chicken that day lacked flavor. The \"hot\" sauce wasn't spicy at all however it was a good spice. I've had their food catered at a party before and it was delicious. Only thing I would say is say is that their spicy is not spicy at all, otherwise the food is very good!"}
{"text":"I didn't love it. I thought it was bland.   Kids liked it.  So it wasn't a waste of money."}
{"text":"This is not a sit down restaurant, it is a Barbeque Chicken Take out place.  That being said the chicken is delicious!  Order half the potatoes that you think you need the portions for potatoes is huge!.   Delicious bbq chicken, great price, take it to go."}
{"text":"Most people talk about the chicken however I rarely get it since the hot table is what makes this place special and worth it. Everyday there are 4 fish options and 4 meat options, and the menu changes every day! The fish could be different cod dishes, grilled whole fish, fish steaks, squid etc The meat could be beef, pork, rabbit, lamb or chicken dishes.  The food is like homemade  They also have salad choices and fried snacks such as sardines, shrimp, and cod cakes to name a few. If I had to use one word to sum this place up it is VALUE"}
{"text":"We walked in there at 6:15 to buy chicken. There was a 10min wait for chicken. There was just one customer there. While waiting others walked in. In the hot table they had fish which looked old and dry. But I was there for the chicken rice and potatoes. It was all fresh and worth the wait. This meal was so good this might be the best Portuguese chicken in the GTA. Great service from the guy there. I will return. Just a note get there before 6pm  They close at 7pm Make sure it's all fresh."}
{"text":"Genuine and delicious Portuguese Chicken!!! Many other great Portuguese dishes as well."}
{"text":"While the prices are acceptable,  the food is hit or miss. It is usually good, but I get burned here every so often. I usually get the 1/2 chicken with 2 sides for $10.  The hot sauce is acceptable. I prefer making the trek out to Mario's BBQ versus going here for the most part."}
{"text":"The prices are great.  I usually get the quarter chicken with 2 sides for $6.  As someone who does not like sauce on their rotisserie chicken, I do find their chicken a bit dry.  I have been spoiled by places like George's downtown who serve mouthwatering juicy chicken, but as someone who lives in the Applewood area, options are limited.  Decent for the price."}
{"text":"The food here is not the greatest, I've had a lot better. The worse thing is about this place is you get attitude from the employees, and they can't get a simple order right. I've been there a few times,and  they got my order wrong. I just came from there and I ordered chicken with potatoes and rice. I got the chicken,and the potatoes  were under cooked, but instead of rice I got broccoli. The two words don't even remotely sound the same. Maybe I should have ordered in Portuguese instead, I would have had a better chance of getting my order right. I'll never go back to this place. I rather drive to Brampton to another Portuguese chicken place I know. The service at this place is great. Your greeted by the owner who always has a smile on her face and the food  is so much better."}
{"text":"Sunday is NFL day and I just happen to live close to Farol's.  Today it is Piri Piri Chicken with roasted potatoes and lots of extra sauce.  I love their sauce, just the right amount of heat and lots of garlic.  Honestly these guys do not need a review as they are always busy."}
{"text":"Farol's chicken is absolutely amazing. While I don't consider myself a churrasqueira expert, this is hands down, by far, the best Portuguese chicken I have ever had.  At $12 for a whole chicken, there is enough meat to feed 3-4 people. They chop the chicken up right in front of you, and give you a choice of mild or hot sauces (personally I prefer the hot one, and it isn't too spicy).   In addition to their chicken, they also offer a vast range of other dishes that are prepared and ready to buy. I've had the fish and the squid, and they too are very good.  This is a purely takeout place, where the lines can stretch outside the front door at times. Be prepared for a wait, but don't worry, the service is quick and the lines move fast.   That pretty much summarizes this business to be honest. Go there for the chicken, get other dishes to accompany it, and enjoy! Believe me, you will."}
{"text":"Mind blowingggg! Pooof***   How have i not heard of this place?? I've driven by it numerous times. Thanks to Yelp, I think I just found my new Portuguese go to place!    This chicken is ridiculously yummy, moist, fresh and authentic! The hot sauce is soooooo good! I want to slather that stuff on everything! Everything I tell you! It's not that spicy either. The potatoes and rice were perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection and the salad was fresh! I got a family meal deal #1 to go for $23.... It Included a whole chicken, small rice, medium potatoes or fries, medium salad and their piri piri sauce. Amazing value for what you get and the quality is outstanding! My husband thinks it's better than our precious Brasas chicken.... He may be right .... Do I smell leftovers? Drool**  P.S. I called in advance to order my family meal deal and they cut the chicken when I arrived so that it stayed moist... I think they always do this since the gentleman in front of me also pre ordered and had to wait for his chicken to get cut as well. This is how it should be my friends! Makes a huge difference!"}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Mississauga for Portuguese food. I have driven past this place so many times without ever considering stoping in, but today I wanted to try it out and I am pleased that I did. The food is authentic Portuguese food and they have all the fixing too. I recommend getting the chicken with rice and potatoes as that is a classic and what they are know for. I wish the hot sauce on the chicken was spicier but the favours were really good.   I was a little disappointed with the service though, the staff seemed to be a little pushy, even though no one behind us. Also they really don't have anywhere to eat except a couple small tables outside.   Overall, the food was great, but don't expect to stay there long."}
{"text":"been going here for a while now and the chicken was really good until they expanded their store and hired more people, since then the chicken has been salty, the rice and potatoes, sometimes hard and under cooked or mushy and over cooked (no Inbetween) although Farol has great staff, always friendly!!"}
{"text":"If I was rating Farol based on value, it would be a 5*.  However, based on food alone, it was a disappointing 2-2.5*.  First of all, lemme give you an idea of how much food you get for the Family Combo #1 - $23: 2 - Lg Rectangular takeout containers (1 full of Parisian potatoes, 1 full of steamed veg) 1 - Lg Square styro for 1 Portuguese chicken (chicken appeared flattened and was cut into smaller pieces upon request) 1 - Sm Square styro of Rice  I'd say that there was 5-6 servings in total, so it's A LOT of food.  Very good for a quick dinner for a family.  Whole combo was pulled together in a coupla minutes, so it's fast.  No doubt about that.  HOWEVER, where Farol disappoints is that it's unfortunately NOT the \"best Portuguese chicken in Mississauga\", as per their sign, at least not during my visit.  Chicken was dry and bland, despite the added 'spicy' sauce.  Potatoes, veggies, although plentiful, were bland as well.  Rice was slightly more seasoned, but I'd say still on the bland side.  What got me was the sheer and utter DRYNESS.  Bland, I can fix with a salt shaker, but I cannot fix dry once everything is already cooked.  I'd give this place another try, as the counter staff was really nice and efficient, maybe the cook/chicken just had an off-day."}
{"text":"SO GOOD.  We ate here once while on a recent trip to Toronto, and regretted not trying it til so late in the trip - we could have easily eaten there every day!  The service was friendly, the food was reasonably priced (cheap, really), and SO good.    The only negative is that they're a full 2 day drive from our home!"}
{"text":"Prices have gone up slightly over the past years but they did renovations and serve so much more food. Owner is so niceans the chicken is always fresh. The sauce is to die for and for a little over $10 for a whole chicken you can't go wrong. Love these guys. Been a regular for over 10 years"}
{"text":"Food here is really good. Very tasty and very fresh. Only thing that I wish is that they would use hair nets :("}
